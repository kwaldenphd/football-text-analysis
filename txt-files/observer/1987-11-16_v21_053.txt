Criticism of today's youth mounting but unfair 
It is no secret that American youth of today take a beating at the hands of i~tellectuals and journalists. Very little is admired of today's youth. Mostly it's a story of corruption and decadence. 
Of course every generation has thought that its descendants were in some sense worse than they were. But recent publications assessing the quality of American education indicate that today's younger generation, ages 12 to 22, ex­cedes previous limits of ignorance, self­gratification, and barbarism. 
But is it in fact true that America's youth cares only for sex, drugs, and money and is therefore the worst it has ever been? Or are these accusations only superficial understand­ings of an age group whose ideals have always been an easy target for academic attack? 
Among the many charges directed against the newer generation is the claim that television and popular music have had too powerful an influence in shaping their minds. As a result of this mass media programming most members of this age group are believed to have attention spans of around thirty minutes, the length of a usual sit-com show. And because most songs last from three to five minutes, this figure is taken as the length of time an individual is able actually to listen to a single voice or argument. 
Television is also held accountable for the decline in moral values evident in the youth. It is said that today's adolescents can only act out the roles they have seen on the tube. They are as superficial and as scatter-brained as the characters they mimic out of soap operas. The supreme concern with material satisfaction and sexual gratification, which are taken as hal­lmarks of this generation, are values programmed from impersonal sources. They are not the result of self-seeking, exploration, or imagination. 
Perhaps the strongest indictment of the younger generation is that imagination and creativity have been replaced by mechanical role playing. The critics need only point to the debauchery of collegiate spring breaks at Fort Lauderdale or the lyrics of such songs as Madonna's "Material Girl," or the Beastie Boys' "You Gotta Fight for Your Right to Party" to establish the superficiality of these roles. Under such conditions they argue, true love vanishes and passions are drowned out by sexual promiscuity. 
Finding fault with popular culture and in par­
ticular the foolishness of the young is an easy 
task. For some it even seems to be a favorite pastime and career. Allan Bloom's recent, well­publised work The Closing of the American Mind offers one such indictment of the influence popular culture on the minds of the young. 

You do not have to look far to find verifica­tions for such theories of moral decline. Every­thing from Walkman cassette players to the introduction of Spuds Mackenzie as the original party animal can be used as evidence that today's youth has sunk to the lowest levels of mental activity. The theory is seemingly con­firmed by nearly everything on television and radio, and even by such things as the popularity of fast food and the logos printed on clothing. Little or nothing is admitted as counter evidence. 
The picture presented by such observers of social thought is not a flattering one. It presumes that at any given moment the mind of the average youth is likely to be occupied with one of four thoughts, sex, drugs, rock and roll, or money -all of which are immediate concerns of an entirely self-centered and super­ficial individual. The plastic brain of today's youth of course stands in implicit contrast to the truly youthful and noble mind of some golden era, but when this was no one seems to know.

Fear of failure spurs federal budget deficit talks 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Deficit re­duction talks between the White House and Congress are into their deadline week with participants confident of suc­cess -because they can't per­mit a failure. 
''The whole country views it as a test of whether the presi­dent and Congress can really govern," Rep. Leon Panetta, one of the negotiators, said this weekend. 
The talks nearly collapsed on Thursday, scaring not only the people in the room but those outside. 
"Not only didn't we like the taste of it, but clearly the signal from our fellow members (was) they wanted something significant done," Sen. Pete Domenici, a negotiator and senior Republican on the Sen­ate Budget Committee, said this weekend. 
On Friday, the talks res­tarted. Taped on the wall was a full-page newpaper ad from business and civic leaders call­ing for "Decisive Action: a bi­partisan Budget Plan." 
After less than two hours, the House, Senate and White House staffs were sent scurrying for a weekend of numbers­crunching. The bargainers will need the details this week to flesh out a plan to reduce the deficit by $75 billion or more during the next two years. 
The goal of the talks, begun three weeks ago after the Wall Street collapse, is to reduce the fiscal1988 deficit by at least $23 billion to an estimated $144 bil­lion, as required by the Gramm-Rudman law. That would avert automatic spend­ing cuts under the budget­balancing law, which without agreement would take effect Friday. 

The bargainers go into the week with the outline of an agreement that for fiscal 1988 would: 
-Raise taxes about $10 bil­lion, plus add some new fees for government services and step up enforcement of income tax laws. 
-Allow the Pentagon about $285.5 billion to spend this year, more than last year but far less than the $297 billion Reagan re­quested. 
-Restrain inflation growth in domestic agency budgets, to save about $2.8 billion, and cut costs in Medicare and farm subsidies by up to $5 billion combined. 
Those items, along with con­current savings in debt pay­ments that result, would satisfy Gramm-Rudman. 
Stretched into fiscal1989, the program would cut that deficit by $44 billion to $50 billion, in­cluding $19 billion in higher taxes. 
Passenger jet flips over, killing at least 19 people 
<\ssociated Press 
OKLAHOMA CIY, OK -A Continental Airlines jet with 81 people aboard flipped on its back while taking off from Den­ver's airport in a snowstorm Sunday and skidded along the runway, killing at least 19 people and injuring 54 more, authorities said. 
"We counted 18 dead outside the plane, and there are several dead in the fuselage," said Stapleton International Airport spokesman Richard Boulware. Twenty-one people walked 
away from the crash, officials said. 
The DC-9 twin-engine jet, Flight 1713, was carrying 76 passengers and five crew members from Denver to Boise, Idaho, said Continental spokesman Ned Walker. Walker said the flight originated in Oklahoma City, and the crash took place shortly after 2 p.m. MST. 

Rescue work was hampered by falling snow and ice, visibility was poor and some survivors were still trapped in­side the plane more than four hours after the accident, aut­horities said. 
National Transportation Safety Board chairman James Burnett and nine Washington­based investigators will fly to Denver to investigate the Sun­day night crash, NTSB spokes­man Ted Lopatkiewicz said. 
At Denver General Hospital, Dr. Peter Pons said there were 19 confirmed deaths.

decision. "This is a great lost opportunity," said W alshe. 
The Anti-Apartheid Network is planning a boycott of Coca­Cola products to begin next se­mester, said John-Paul Check­ett, treasurer of the network. 
"If the board won't divest, then we won't consume the products made by the companies which are still doing businesses there," he said. 
Checkett said Coca-Cola did sell its shares in its beverage firm in South Africa. But the firm, operating under a differ­ent name, still sells Coke and Coke products and gives money to the South African govern­ment. 
"This is kind of like the stu­dents divesting from the com­panies," Checkett said. 
He added that the boycott is unrelated to the fact that Donald Keough, head of the Coca-Cola company, is also chairman of the Notre Dame Board of Trustees.

Investment merely fortifies apartheid 
Editor's Note: The following column was received before the Board of Trus­tees' decision of last week. 
When we look at South Africa there is one thing we can all agree upon. Apartheid, the institutionalized ex­ploitation and degradation of black South Africans, is repulsive. 
Gregory Maggetti 
guest column 
Under the system of apartheid blacks are denied virtually all political, eco­nomic, and social rights; they are legally denied the right to vote, to receive a proper education or decent employment. Eighty-seven percent of the land is set aside for whites, while thirteen percent of the land, the poorest land, has been formed into bantustans or "Homelands" where Mricans are forced to live. These homelands are not economically viable so men and women must go to "white areas" to find work. Apartheid prohibits Mrican families from living together in "white" cities, so supporting a family entails destruc­tion of black family life. The health sit­uation is appalling with a serious shortage of doctors and medical ser­vices for blacks. As for education, suf­fice it to say that it is free and compul­sory for whites while blacks must pay and their children are not required to attend. 
It has been argued that foreign in­vestment in South Africa is a positive force for change and that it can lead to the dismantling of apartheid. Between 1960 and 1981 U.S. investment in South Mrica increased ninefold. What were some of the positive changes that oc­curred during this 21 year gestation period? Many black political organiza­tions, including the African National Congress (ANC) which was established in 1912, have been banned. More than 
3.5 million blacks have been forcibly removed from "white areas." In 1976, 600 children were killed and thousands more wounded for peacefully protest­ing the government's insistence on using both English and Afrikaans as languages for teaching. Foreign firms have provided the investments and technology needed to build up a strong police and military force which not only keeps black South Africans in their al­lotted space but also insures that neigh­boring states remain sufficiently de­pendent on the South African economy to prohibit any independent develop-

\ 
ment. And finally, despite changes in petty apartheid, the systematic denial of political, economic, and social rights to blacks is as firmly entrenched as ever. 
In light of these results, advocates of foreign investment in South Africa realize that investment alone is not au­tomatically a positive force for change. Definite steps on the part of foreign companies had to be taken to improve the situation for blacks. So in 1977 Rev. Leon Sullivan, a member of the board of General Motors,. devised a code of conduct for foreign firms. This code consisted of six principles: desegrega­tion of the workplace, fair employment practices, equal pay for equal work, job training and advancement for blacks and improvement in the quality of workers' lives. These principles are laudable in themselves. Yet when we consider that the "Sullivan principles" don't come close to the core of apar­theid (disenfranchisement, population control, removals, detention and ban­nings) and that even if all U.S. corpo­rations in South Africa strictly adhered to them it would only affect one percent of the black work force, we see that they are not simply ineffective but ir­relevant for tearing down apartheid structures. (Interestingly, Rev. Sul­livan has come to recognize this fact and now urges all U.S. companies to get out of South Africa altogether.) 
When we consider the words of John Vorster, former South African Prime Minister--"Each trade agreement, each bank loan, each new investment is another brick in the wall of our con­tinued existence" --we begin to see that foreign investments are the very bricks that build the apartheid prison. 
How can we help free black South Africans? We can help tear down the walls of the prison by refusing to invest and ceasing all business in South Africa. Economic sanctions threaten the very existence of South Africa's apartheid system. In the words of South Africa's Director General for Finance, Chris Stals, "if the world banking com­munity should effectively exclude South Africa from international trade and payments systems ...it would put us on the barter system overnight." If the world stopped doing business with South Africa altogether the economic foundations of apartheid would effec­tively be shut down. 
So we have two theories about foreign investment and apartheid. Foreigners say that investments in South Africa will bring about an end of apartheid.

White South Africans say investments will keep apartheid strong and disin­vestment will threaten its very exis­tence. What do black South Africans say? As far back as 1959 they called for international economic sanctions against South Africa. Nobel Peace Laureate Albert Luthuli, president of the ANC at the time, saw the full im­plications of such actions--"the eco­nomic boycott of South Africa still en­tail undoubted hardship for Africans. We do not doubt that. But if it is a method which shortens the day of bloodshed, the suffering to us will be a price we are willing to pay." African leaders continue to call for economic sanctions as the one alternative that might reduce the bloodshed resulting from black emancipation in South Africa. 
Now here is a disturbing thought. Despite the fact that history has shown that investing in South Africa supports apartheid, and the fact that South Africans, both black and white, have stated the same, Notre Dame has con­sistently argued that the University should not divest from South Africa. 
The irony is that an institution renowned for teaching principles of peace and justice has been a promoter of injustice in practice. If this support were unwitting it might be excusable. But the fact that Notre Dame has main­tained its investments in South Africa, despite the fact that conditions there have deteriorated beyond the point where our own investment policy calls for disinvestment, is damning indeed. 
The next Board of Trustees meeting is on the weekend of November 13 and 
14. Once again they will review the policy of investing in South Africa. It is inconceivable that the members of the Board could still be ignorant of the real effect of our continued participa­tion in the South African economy. Therefore, we can hope to see a decision to divest from companies doing any business with South Mrica. Anything short of this would continue to under­mine the struggle for justice in that country.

P.O. Box Q 
Apartheid may harm nascent labor force 
Dear Editor: 
The Notre Dame Board of Trustees is about to make a decision of far reach­ing consequences. Will they or will they not disinvest all assets with ties to South Africa? The issue is complex. Even though there can be no hesitation in con­demning the immortality of the politi­cal practice of apartheid, the proper reaction on the part of morally sensi­tive individuals and institutions presents a far more complex situation. Any movement in the sphere of eco­nomic decisions necessitates great cau­tion. 
Where is the wisdom when, in at­tempting to achieve a good, one adopts a policy of walking out and abandoning the very position from which one may, sooner or later, exert an influence for good? 
On Sept. 17, the New York Times had a very interesting article, "South Africa Trade Now Led By Japan." An excerpt from this article may be worthy of consideration: " ...Japan has made significant inroads into the busi­ness once held by American com­panies ... The biggest Japanese advance in recent years has been in areas where American products once dominated: mainframe computers ... chemicals and automobiles ... " 
The labor movement in South Africa, an enormous potential power base, is now in an infant stage of positive de­velopment which is just beginning to reflect a sense of self awareness. It is an undisputed fact that the South African economy cannot exist without black participation. Imagine the influ­ence one could exert if, instead of aban­doning a position, one used it to provide further encouragement to this emerg­ing labor force? 
Divestment may be a satisfactory ve­hicle by which one may express pas­sionate opposition to an immoral sys­tem, but to what effect if that same vehicle proves to be a crippling obsta­cle to the very means by which black South Africans may better themselves.

The architecture program: 
'It's a way of life' 
SUSAN HRACH accent writer 

1\ rchitecture majors are mys· I1.terious people on this campus. Unlike the stereotypi­cal "Arkie," who is non-social, artsy and rather nocturnal, most Notre Dame Arkies are actually disciplined and well­rounded students who appreci­ate aesthetic beauty as well as a good party. 
The Architecture program 
involves majors as early as the 
freshman year, when would-be 
Arkies experiment with the dis­
cipline's demands in a studio 
course. Committment increases 
during the sophomore year, 
and it is then that some stu­
dents, still unsure about their 
decision to become architec­
ture majors, opt to leave the 
program. The third out of five 
required years takes place In 
Rome--an exciting change of 
scenery and lifestyle for the 
majors. 
Notre Dame is one of 
only three universities in the 
country with a full-year Rome 
program. Arkies receive out­
standing opportunities to travel 
and experience first-hand the 
work of the masters, not to 
mention the pasta at 
Giuseppe's, a local hang-out. 
Calvin and Hobbes 
The demanding fourth and fifth years require students to maintain a healthy sense of competition. "It's not cut­throat," explains fourth-year Arkie Joye Reno, "Everybody has their own talent." Stephen Kromkowski, another architec­ture major, adds that studying architecture at Notre Dame is extremely rewarding. "We don't deal with hypothetical, utopian projects," he says. 
As a fifth year student, Krom­kowskl is now working on his thesis project. "Design is end­less," he comments. His work entails restructuring a section of an actual city or town, right down to the plumbing and electricity. 
Venturing Into the Architec­ture Building, these students' "home away from dorm," one discovers why the Arkies enjoy their major and each other. City maps cover the walls of the upstairs studios, contribu­ting to the relaxed, lived-in aura of the building. Drawing tables are piled high with books and sketches; a radio plays from some unknown lo­cation under some papers. 
The Arkles wandering around this maze-like arrangement of rooms create a general feeling of comfortable friendship. The group, after all, Is part of the Arkie experience. "We're kind of in our own little world," Reno explains. 
Rome is only one of several unifying traditions for the Arkies. The Beaux Arts Ball, 
. held each semester, is "something totally crazy and radical for Notre Dame," as Reno describes it. Definitely one of the more unique events on campus, the costume ball is known for its flair and out­rageous atmosphere. It's likely that the Arkies owe their curious reputation in part to the Beaux Arts Ball, which Is always a much anticipated event. 
l;he Architecture building is currently housing "Expo Roma," an exhibit of work done by the students while in Italy. The Expo Is attended by visit­Ing architects and professors from around the country. All Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students are encouraged to view the visually exciting work while sipping some real Cap­pacino. 
One architecture student sums up the dedication Arkles feel for their major: "It's a way of life; it's a profession. You've gotta love it."

Seniors 
continued from page 16 
But in this year's final game at Notre Dame Stadium, nobody in the Irish locker room was wondering what it takes to win, and nobody had to feel sorry for the seniors who had played their last home game. 
Saturday's 37-6 trouncing of 11th-ranked Alabama was a far cry from the disappointments of previous years and Holtz left little doubt as to who deserves the most credit. 
"This squad and what they have done is really rather amazing," he said. "That goes back to our seniors and their leadership." 
Football theory states that games are won on the offensive and defensive lines. It just so happens that seniors dominate these groups on the 8-1 Notre Dame squad. 
Four of the five Irish offen­sive linemen are playing in their final season of eligibility and six of the seven starters of the Irish front seven on defense are also seniors. 
Holtz put the veterans in charge of erasing the frustra­tion of years past at the begin­ning of the season and instilling a new outlook. 
"It all began with Coach Holtz," said co-captain Chuck Lanza. "The staff called on the seniors right from the start. "We have followed through on that challenge. We made an ex­ample to follow and the younger guys have done a great job of coming through." 
"This team started to play with pride, confidence and a really positive attitude," said co-captain Byron Spruell. 
The effect of the seniors showed in many areas. Ala­bama and Notre Dame each had 70 yards worth of penalty yardage, but with the exception of the unsportsmanlike conduct infraction on the first drive that led to a Tide field goal, the Irish were able to overcome the mis­takes on a regular basis, Ala­bama wasn't. 

Evidence two key plays that helped the Irish take control of the game. A first-quarter hold­ing penalty put the Irish in a first-and-20 position, but Brown quickly hauled in 22-yard pass to keep a touchdown drive alive to erase the error. 
But in the second quarter, Al­abama was caught offsides on a Ted Gradel field goal and the Irish turned it into a touch­down. 
Another intangible area is the mental approach, the pride that has filtered to the other team members. Evidence junior linebacker Ned Bolcar on winning all five home games for the first time since 1980. 
"The coaches and the older guys keep telling us this is our stadium and we shouldn't lose here," he said. "Everyone says it's so great to play here, well, we don't want it to be fun for them at all." 
Most of the Irish seniors tried to put the importance of the game above sentiments of the last home game -with mixed results. 
"We tried not to get over­emotional," said fifth-year nose tackle Mike Griffin, who had five tackles. "It's hard to step back and think about it ­you have to prepare for the present. It's a big win for the team." 
"It's great to go out a win­ner," said Brandy Wells, who played both cornerback and free safety. "But it's really im­portant that we beat a good team today. We're playing the best teams, but everyone's doing the job, and that's what it takes to win." 
"We were thinking that the emotions would come after the game," said Tim Brown. "But they came before, and it's tough to hold them back. But one we kicked off. we put it all behind us and thought about the game." 
The result of the attention was exclamation point to an un­beaten home season. And after experiencing the worst of times, filled with frustrations and near-misses, this year's seniors can look back at their last performance on the home turf with pride. 
''(Today) we had the right scheme and the right inten­sity," said Spruell. "It's the greatest. way to go out." 
"It's a special feeling," said Brown. "One that we will all probably be able to appreciate more when we are away from this place." 
"It's really an emotional high," said Lanza. "I can't think of a better way to end.

The last time the Crimson Tide lost by as wide a margin was in 1957, when Auburn shut out its state rival, 40-0. 
The seventh-ranked Irish upped their record to 8-1 with their fifth-consecutive victory. 
The Notre Dame defense forced Curry to use three dif­ferent quarterbacks in· the game, and allowed only a pair of first-half field goals by Phil­lip Doyle. 
Tide starting signal-caller Jeff Dunn left the game with 28 seconds left in the first half, after he was knocked out of bounds by Irish outside linebacker Darrell Gordon and suffered a minor head injury. 
"We (the Irish defense) just played well fundamentally and with a lot of intensity," inside linebacker Wes Pritchett noted. 
Bobby Humphrey, Ala­ba!Da's all-America tailback, gained 94 yards on 14 rushes and had 214 all-purpose yards. 
"We knew they would try to give the ball to him," Pritchett continued. "We didn't change anything. We just did our jobs and it worked out." 
Outside linebacker Cedric Figaro led Notre Dame in tackles with seven, while de­fensive back Brandy Wells and inside linebacker Ned Bolcar added six apiece.

scored on four of its first five possessions and opened a 20-6 halftime lead. 
Rice dashed into the end zone from 12 yards out on a second­quarter option play to give Notre Dame its first lead, 10-3. He then completed his first career touchdown pass later in the quarter on a fourth-down play, a three-yard loft to tight end Andy Heck that made the score 17-3. 
The remaining Irish touch­downs were enough to make the Notre Dame fans wish they had a few Florida orange trees with them in the stands. 
Junior tailback Mark Green, who gained 149 yards on 18 carries for his third straight 100-yard game, struck early in the fourth quarter. Green took a pitch and burst through a big hole on the left side, racing down the sideline for a 74-yard 

Irish coach Lou Holtz. Green held that record for a whole six minutes. 
Freshman tailback Ricky Watters improved on Green's mark by one yard, sprinting left, weaving through defenders and cutting back to the right side en route to a 75­yard touchdown with 4:01 left to play. 
Ted Gradel made good on all three Notre Dame field-goal at­tempts and all four extra points to account for the rest of the scoring. The senior was accu­rate from 49, 21 and 22 yards. 
"It's like I told Bill Curry after the game," Holtz said. "I said, 'Bill, you just picked a bad day to play us in South Bend.' We were very emotion­al, and our defense was ab­solutely tremendous." 
Holtz expressed concern before the game that his of­fense might have trouble

"This football team has to­tally amazed me," Holtz con­tinued. "This was a total team effort." 
It appears Notre Dame is bound for Dallas and the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1, to play the win­ner of the Southwest Confer­ence (either Texas or Texas A&M). Representatives of the Orange Bowl said they have not decided which school will receive a bid to play the winner of this Saturday's Oklahoma­Nebraska game in Miami on New Year's Day. 
They said they are looking at Miami, Syracuse, Florida State and Notre Dame. With bids coming out in less than a week and no bargaining under way between the Orange and Cotton Bowls, however, it ap­pears likely that the bid will go to Miami before Notre Dame gets the chance to play the Hur­ricanes on Nov. 28. 
"If we go 10-1 with the schedule we have, I definitely think we deserve the right to play for a national champion­ship," Brown said. 
EXTRA POINTS -Gradel's 49­yard field goal in the first quar­ter was the longest of his career. His previous best was 44 yards against both Michigan and Purdue earlier this season ... Sophomore cornerback Stan Smagala suffered a minor con­cussion in the first half, but is expected to practice as usual this week ... Notre Dame was penalized 15 yards when the student body was charged with unsportsmanlike conduct for throwing oranges. The crowd was first warned.

Farley began the scoring on its very first drive. After quar­terback Carol Elliott com­pleted two big passes, she then ran an option in from the three­yard line to put the first points on the board. The conversion was successful, making it 8-0. 
The rest of the first half 
belonged to BP, as it scored two 
touchdowns. 
The first TD came on a 16­yard pass from running back Ann Curoe to Carolyn Burke, a play similar to one the team used last week against Lyons. The conversion was good to make the score 8-8. 
After a punt by Farley, BP was at it again, this time with quartrerback Teresa Coombs connecting with Carolyn Burke for a 31-yard strike. With a suc­cessful conversion, the score was 16-8 in favor of BP, and

INDIANAPOLIS-K.C. Jones isn't satisfied that the Boston Celtics are off to their best start since 1972. 
"We've got to be more con­sistent. We took some bad shots out there and shot selection really worries me," Jones said after the Celtics beat Indiana 103-98 Sunday to bring their record to 6-0. 
Larry Bird scored 11 of his 24 points in the first quarter, when the Celtics took the lead for good. 
Boston, off to its best start since it opened with 10 victories in 1972, made 10 of its first 13 shots and shot 68 percent (17­of-25) in the first quarter.

Irish do it all, bounce 'Bama, 37-6 
Dillon goes to the air to stomp Stanford, 24-0 
ND dominates 11th-rated Tide 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame student body was a little premature Saturday afternoon, hurling oranges onto the field in quest of a bid to the Orange Bowl. 
But you would never know it from the way the Irish threw an inspired defense and a big-play offense at nth-ranked Alabama, routing the Crimson Tide, 37­6, at Notre Dame Stadium. 
''After beating Alabama like we did today, we can go all the way," said Irish flanker Tim Brown, who caught four passes for 114 yards and compiled 225 all-purpose yards on 14 touches of the ball. 
"The only thing to say at a time like this is that we were whipped," Ala­bama head coach Bill Curry said. "We were beaten by a vastly superior foot­ball team. That was obvious. 
"Had we responded at our very best, I doubt seriously we'd have beaten this Notre Dame team today."

Was it Joe Montana? No. Was it Tony Rice or Kent 
Graham? 
Well... maybe not. But Dillon Hall's quarterback Mike Brammer weaved a little of his own magic on the grass of Notre Dame Stadium Sunday afternoon, as the Big Red stunned Stanford, 24-0, to cap­ture the men's Interhall foot­ball championship. 
Throughout the season, Dil­lon has relied on a powerful running game to compile a 7-1 record and a berth in the cham­pionship game. Sunday, though, the Big Red went to the 

:} air early and often, and stayed !j, there. Brammer passed 20 times in the game, completing 11 of those for 164 yards. Add to that 
1', 
a 31-yard option pass, and Dil­lon piled up nearly 200 yards in the air. 
"Our offensive coordinator Ross Perri decided this week to go with the pass," said Dillon coach Jeff Morgan. "(He did so) basically because he felt we've been slighted all year. Everyone knew we could run, but he knew we could throw the ball. Our offensive line played incredibly too." Dillon wasn't 'supposed' to win. 
The Studs dominated the reg­ular season and entered the final game brimming with con­fidence. 
"There's no reason for us not to be confident," said Stanford coach Al Martin last week. 
But within minutes of the opening play, Dillon was leading 3-0 and the Studs were reeling. Stanford started the game with the ball and went nowhere (four plays, nine

Seniors get win in home finale 
By RICK RIETBROCK Assistant Sports Editor 
Two years ago it was a case of bewil­derment. 
"I feel bad for our seniors, but the way we lost it, I feel bad for our whole team," said tl)en-junior quarterback Steve Beurelein after another tough loss, a 10-7 heartbreaker to LSU in the final home game of the 1985 season. "We played well but it just wasn't meant to be. 
"It makes you wonder what it takes to win." Last year it was just plain frustra­tion. 
"We had our chances and didn't win," said Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz after last season's 24-19 bitter loss to Penn State in the home finale. "This loss affects us -especially our seniors -very deeply. Other teams have made good plays against us and sometimes

yards). Dillon took over on downs in Stanford territory. One first down and five plays later, Brammer nailed a 40­yard field goal which could easily have been 50. 
The first half seemed like a continual repeat of those two series -Stanford stopping itself with an ineffective passing game, and Dillon using its air attack to pile on the points. 
Dillon's most impressive drive of the game came late in the first quarter. Five first downs moved the Big Red 69 yards, and an eight-yard run by Tim Murphy made the score 10-0. 
The prime receiving threats for Dillon in the half and in the game were Steve Murphy and Bill Celebrezze. Murphy caught five passes for 123 yards and one TD, while Celebrezze matched that with six catches for 60 yards and a touchdown. 
, 
Leading 17-0 at the half (Celebrezze's TD being the third score), the Big Red settled in to hold off the Studs' potentially explosive offense and add a few more points. 
They were successful. 

"We wanted to shove it down their throats," said Morgan of the second half strategy. "They ran it up a few times during the season. But we also wanted to get all of our players in.'' 
Though Stanford's offense was more effective in the second half than in the the first, the Studs were stiil stymied by their own mistakes and the Big Red 'D'. 
Stanford quarterback AI Martin began to heat up early in the the third quarter. The senior signal-caller completed four of five passes on Stan­ford's first drive of the half, but a bobbled pass wound up in the hands of Dillon's Tim Murphy, 
BP takes IH title with 24-16 victory 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
In what was a highly exciting and competitive football game, the Breen-Phillips football squad edged out Farley for the women's Interhall football championship by a score of 24­16. 
The game was played at Notre Dame Stadium, where the fans saw the BP football team snap Farley's three-year domination of the Interhall league. 
Farley was attempting to capture a fourth-consecutive women's title, a feat that has never been accomplished in the history of Notre Dame, but and the Studs best scoring threat was thwarted. 
A defense ("completely new," according to Murphy) specifically designed by coach Ted Rolff to stop Stanford's passing attack apparently worked, as the Studs were held to just 98 yards in the air and just 106 overall. 
Senior co-captain Buzz Eck­elcamp led the Dillon defensive line with two-and-a-half sacks and innumerable pressures. Martin was on the run all through the game. 
The Big Red's final score was its most exciting. Early in the fourth quarter, faced with a fourth-and-two, Brammer dropped back and dumped a pass to Steve Murphy over the middle. Murphy snaked his way 36 yards through the Stan­ford secondary, and Dillon had the trophy. 
Breen-Phillips had a different feat in mind. 
Last year, these two teams met for the championship, and Farley emerged the winner. This year, BP and Farely met in the regular season and BP established itself as the "team to beat" by edging Farley 24-22. 
Breen-Phillips followed through on that reputation in the title game. In what was a very passing-oriented game, the BP passing attack was a little too strong for the Farley secondary. All three BP scores were in the air, and all were scored by wide receiver Carolyn Burke.

CENTER FOR SOCIAL CONCERNS 
1983-1988 
The doors of the Center were opened for the first time in January 1983. In 1988 the Center will celebrate its Fifth Aniversary with a variety of special programs and events for students, faculty, alumni, and staff. Details will fol­low. 
PLEASE NOTE! 
Although we are well into the FalJ Semester, there is still time to par­ticipate in many programs at andbr through the Center. These include many of the Service-Social Action Groups, Seminars, Summer Ser­vice Projects, etc. Ifthis semester's schedule is full, check out now details on a program or group which interests you and begin to partici­pate at the beginning of the Spring Semester. 

Center challenges students 
Do you ever feel that your academic work is challenging you to ponder the mysteries of life without any clues? The Center for Social Concerns has some clues to offer. We believe that seeing life outside the University and encoun­tering people of different experiences and backgrounds will give students a new way to approach the important questions that are being presented in the classroom. 
The Center for Social Concerns works with approximately twenty-five stu­dent organizations that enable their members to encounter life from a new perspective. Some groups are organ­ized to do service in the South Bend community --from visits to the elderly to caring for young children. Other groups are organized to help students face hard issues in concrete ways. These groups deal with issues and act on what they learn. Amnesty Interna­tional and World Hunger Coalition are two such groups. 

Students who want to continue their education during the summer and school breaks can participate in Center for Social Concerns programs that give them an opportunity both to learn and to serve. These include trips to Wash­ington, D.C., and Appalachia during Fall and Spring breaks. Summer Ser­vice Projects allow students to spend eight weeks getting to know new people and serving in a variety of communit­ies. The Urban Plunge gives students a revealing glimpse of urban life. 
Our challenge is to gain insight as we pursue knowledge. The mysteries will never be solved, but the clues that come from new experiences and reaching out to others will, without doubt, shed some light on the big questions that we encounter in our search. Kathy Royer Coordinator,ServicetSocialAction 
Summer service: 'Beyond abuse' 
" ...Each time our women attended a mandatory support group or parent­ing class they met other women who were struggling like themselves and some who had broken free. Every talk she shared with us she learned some­thing new about herself. Each time she faced a new challenge, applied for public aid or a driver's license, she gained confidence in her abilities. Regaining one's self-esteem is difficult for anyone -a growing process that can frighten some to return home to the familiar. But compassion is well rewarded. Because I was there to help, showed an interest and allowed them to trust me, women told me things they had never told anyone before, ex­pressed fears that they had never ad­mitted to themselves. I came upon the best way to counsel them quite easily. As they talked it became quite obvious that they knew the source and the answers to their own problems and, when given a chance to hear them­selves talk, they could clarify their mixed and often conflicting emotions themselves. While we worked with the victims to prevent the crime from recurring, we also struggled to break another cycle -the continuance of domestic violence with each genera­tion."

'Crucible of experience' 
"As has always been the case, the best theory is forged in the crucible of experience. Thus, we at Notre Dame have structured opportunities for concrete involvement in the so­cial, political, and ecclesial orders. Through internships and summer study, through foreign study centers, and through the umbrella of organ­izations affiliated with the Center for Social Concerns, we provoke the awareness of faculty and students alike. The mission of service begins in the activity of some among us. 
But their experience of the plaintive cry of the poor and disheartened returns to the classroom and re­search project to seek a better and more just way. 
In the commitment to justice and peace, in efforts at spiritual and moral renewal, Notre Dame has a mission to society and the Church." Father Edward A. Malloy, C.S.C. President From the Inaugural Address Sept. 23, 1987 

returned to campus this Fall after 8 weeks of service throughout the U.S. in placements ranging from shelters for abused wives and neglected children to Indian reservations. The students are now taking a theology course, sharing their experiences, and attempting to understand more fully the meaning of service. 
Social Concerns Scholarship tuition credits up to $1200 are awarded to the students who apply and are chosen to take part in the SSP Program. The proj­ects are underwritten by Notre Dame Alumni Clubs and the James F. Andrews Scholarships. Contact the Center for details on the 1988 Summer Service Projects.

THE OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT NETWORK 
Overseas Development Network <ODN) is a nationwide student organization working to respond constructively to the problems of world hunger and poverty. 
Notre Dame-St. Mary's ODN works closely with other social action groups to organize our two main events. Third World Awareness week is a week long educational series featuring lectures, films, and dis­cussions about issues in the Third World. The Hunger Cleanup involves students from both schools donating a few hours to clean-up projects in South Bend as a fundraising effort to benefit both the local and overseas community. ODN meets every other Tuesday at 7:00p.m. at the Center for Social Concerns. For more information call Liz Durkin (287-3876) or Tony Lee (283-4489). 

The Notre Dame-St. Mary's World Hunger Coal­ition was founded in 1974 with the purpose of educat­ing our community on the issues related to the tragedy of world hunger. A second purpose is to actively participate in the fight against world hunger, and thirdly, to foster spiritual growth among the members of the coalition. 
Our largest undertaking is the Wednesday lunch fast each semester, where hundreds of students for­feit their lunch symbolically. The cost of the food is donated directly to various hunger relief and developmental programs. Other }VHC programs in­clude bi-weekly meetings and speakers, visits to local soup kitchens, participation in World Food Day and Third World Awareness Week. 
The WHC is always open to energetic suggestions and enthusiastic members. If there are any in­quiries, please call Lorie Konwinski (283-2959) or Ron Burkhart (283-2195).

NORTHERN INDIANA STATE DEVELOPMENT CENTER 
Northern Indiana State Development Center is a small residential facility for mentally retarded children and adolescents. The residents of NISDC go to special education classes in schools throughout the South Bend Community. Their education does not stop in the schools, however, as the children also participate in a variety of training, therapy, and recreation at NISDC. 
Please consider a volunteer experience at Nor­thern Indiana State Development Center. Our facility is close and convenient for students. Our residents would really enjoy having you come.
