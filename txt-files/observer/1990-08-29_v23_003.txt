Hussein will free women, children 
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -Sad­

dam Hussein, in what Baghdad 
said was a sympathetic re­
sponse to hostages' pleas for 
their children's safety, an­
nounced Tuesday that foreign 
women and children would be 
allowed to leave Iraq. 
The dramatic announcement 

came hours after the Iraq 
president met with a group of 
foreigners who were trapped by 
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of 
Kuwait. 
The official Iraqi News Agency, which carried the an­nouncement, said Saddam was moved by the foreign families' fears over their children's plight. 
"We hope it's true," State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said of the announce­ment. But, he noted, "We have seen promises and statements by Iraq in the past that have proven false." 
He said the department had received no official word of the Iraqi decision and was seeking more information through its embassy in Baghdad. 
Britain's Foreign Office, too, said it was seeking official con­firmation that women and chil­dren would be freed. "We would love to hear it," said a spokesman, who by custom was not identified. 
About 3,000 Americans and 3,300 Britons are among the 21,000 trapped Westerners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. 
Saddam has vowed to use them 
as human shields against at­
tacks on Iraqi installations. 
British and U.S. officials say 
Iraq has moved more than 150 
Britons and more than 60 
Americans from Kuwait to 
strategic locations. 
A statement from the Iraq's 
ruling Revolutionary Command 
Council said the decision was 
made "to preserve the Arab 
humanitarian image," the offi­
cial Iraqi News Agency said. 
The agency, monitored in Ni­
cosia, said the Iraqi president 
decreed "that all women anrl children who are foreigners in Iraq are allowed to move freely in Iraq or to travel whenever they want starting tomorrow, including the families Iraq is hosting." 
Saddam has consistently re­ferred to the captive foreigners as guests, not hostages, and has told them their presence would help prevent all-out war from erupting. 
The news agency repeated that view. saying the foreigners were "prevented from traveling on humanitarian grounds aimed at fending off the fires of war and deterring those seek­ing to start it." 
But, it said: "We opted to preserve the Arab humanitar­ian image" by freeing the

Hesbur~h ad for Philip Morris Inc. prompts complaints about his endorsing smoking 
By MONICA YANT 
Assistant News Editor 
A recent advertisement spon­sored by Philip Morris Companies Inc. featuring Father Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus of the University, has sparked com­plaints from people who view the ad as an endorsement for cigarette smoking. 
The full-page ad, which ran in publications such as Newsweek, Time, and the New York Times, is actually supporting the National Archives' celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. Hesburgh's photo runs alongside quoted material in which speaks of "the unfinished business of the Bill of Rights." 
Philip Morris Companies Inc. includes Kraft Foods, Miller Brewing Company and Philip Morris U.S.A., which produces Marlboro and Virginia Slims Cigarettes. 
Dick Conklin, director of Public Relations and Information, said his office re­ceived "a couple of complaints," and did not know how many Hesburgh received. 
Hesburgh is out of the coun­try until Sept. 4, his office said. He could not be reached by telephone for comment. 
The Observer received a letter from Dr. Richard Sandler, an assistant professor of Pediatrics at Rush Medical College in Chicago. 
Sandler's letter, dated July 3, expressed his concern about the context of the ad, and the implications that Hesburgh's association with a tobacco company raises. 

"On the face of it one can ar­

gue the moral correctness of a 
pre-eminent person such as 
Father Hesburgh speaking of 
'the unfinished business of the 
Bill of Rights," he wrote. 
"However, he is a man of great intelligence and wisdom. He knows well the importance of the context." 
According to Conklin, "the purpose of the endorsement was the Bill of Rights, not ci­garette smoking." 
Conklin described Hesburgh as "a man who's shed a lot of blood for the Bill of Rights in terms of his work on the Civil Rights Commission, President Ford's Amnesty Commission, and immigration issues." 
Sandler's letter outlined his complaint against the Philip Morris Company: that the to­bacco industry uses the 'First Amendment as argument against groups trying to limit the use and advertisement of its products. 
In a telephone interview with Sandler. he said, "the Bill of Rights is used as a pillar of their {tobacco companies) ra­tionalization and public rela­tion efforts to justify smoking." 
The fact that Hesburgh would appear in the ad also bothered Sandler. 
"Clearly. by permitting the use of his name in an adver­tisement on first amendment rights to be prominently spon­sored by a tobacco company, Father Hesburgh is lending his voice (and by extension that of the Church and of Notre Dame) to those of the nicotine drug companies," his letter said. 
"Their efforts, and now his, service to thwart critical public health endeavors." 
When interviewed, Sandler said, "it's a triple whammy to have the good name of the Church, Notre Dame, and Father Hesburgh be misled in this manner." 
According to Conklin, Hesburgh's appearance in the ad is not a University issue. "They were quoting Father Hesburgh, not the University," he said. 
Sandler also sent his letter to Hesburgh, he said, and received a response dated July 23. According to Sandler, the letter from Hesburgh said, "My only purpose was to promote the Bill of Rights as I have been doing most of mv life." 
"As to smoking cigarettes, I quit them 20 years ago," Hesburgh's letter said. 
Conklin said that the com­plaints his office received were aimed against cigarette smok­ing primarily. 
"The underlying motivation for all of them was that these are people who are against smoking and thought that Father Hesburgh's appearance in the ad was an endorsement of smoking," he said.

droolers, because Art Director only some of us are. My hall and its storied tradition are both in trouble. 
Late last year, rumors began flying around the Big Red about alleged renovations that were allegedly supposed to take place over the alleged summer. We were all pretty stoked about this, because the place had been virtually unchanged since the Leahy era. The dirt floors were kind of a homey touch, but when blood started seeping from the walls, our rector, Father 
Carey, decided it was time for a change. 
A crack team of master craftsmen was brought in for the job of bringing Dillon into the 1990's, or, at the very least, the 1950's. From what I've heard, they got the "This Old House" crew, as well as a special hole-digging unit from the University. Have you seen that canyon out by the stadium? I used to be able to park there, instesad of deep in the jungles of Mishawaka, but that's a different column for a different day. 
When I arrived on campus last week, these busy beavers were still there, putting on the finishing touches. Big ol' janitor butt dudes are always welcome in Dillon, and we were particularly glad to see that these guys were working so hard. The only problem was that they turned my building into a depraved cross between Pasquerilla West and Club Med. Don't get me wrong, it looks nice. It just doesn't look like Dillon. We have pretty purple carpet in the hallways. We have pretty new fire doors. We even have those little peg boards with our room number on them. 
Thankfully, the old spirit of Dillon lives in the ghettos at the back of the building. These sections of our home were left untouched over the summer, because they have bigger plans for next summer. They haven't decided whether they want more social space or a multi-level petting zoo. Some of my pals live in these ghettos (read: slums) by choice. The few poor freshmen who got stuck in there are subject to unmerciful ridicule from their classmates. Suggestions abound that SAT scores and/or sexual prowess determined freshmen room placement. 
Instead of publicly whining, I guess I should take pride in how my dorm looks, even if it is pretty.

Saint Mary's student Baer dies in bicycle accident 
By KATIE MOORE 
News Writer 
Elizabeth Baer, a sophomore­to-be at Saint Mary's College, died the morning of Friday, June 9, from head injuries sus­tained in a bicycle accident. 
Baer, 19, and a friend were riding their bicycles to meet a high school friend of Baer's the evening of Thursday, June 8. Baer was riding down a hill when she was distracted and collided with her friend's bicy­cle. Baer's friend was un­harmed. 
Despite efforts to revive Baer, she was pronounced brain dead the next morning at Munson Medical Center in Traverse City, Michigan. 
Nancy Boehuer, who was to be her roommate this year, de­scribed Baer as " A blast, a riot. She was always up. She worked hard for everything." 
A crew member of Dance '90, Baer also had plans to join The Observer this year.

Sacred Heart receives facelift, opens for mass after 15 months 

By L. PETER YOB 
News Writer 
Students returning to school this week found a newly opened Sacred Heart Church. which had been closed for 15 months while undergoing a $7 million ren­ovation. 
The church's reopening on August 16 was marked by a mass celebrating the 102nd anniversary of Sacred Heart's consecration. 
Those who haven't yet vis­ited the church this fall can expect to see "quite a drastic change," according to Don Dedrick, director of physical plant and maintenance cen­ter. The main focus of the project was to "try to re­store the church to the pe­riod when it was built," he said. 
Original construction on the church began in 1870 and the cornerstone was placed in 1871. Mass was first celebrated at Sacred Heart in 1875 and the Church was concercrated in 188 8 by Bishop Joseph Dwenger of Fort Wayne. 
Dedrick said that the cur­rent renovation has been a two year project that in­cluded replacement of the

roof and the addition of new slate on the steeple. 
There was also a restora­tion of the wall and ceiling paintings, exterior frescoes and decorative plaster. New pews were added as well as new stencils on the ceiling. The interior of the church contains new guilding and stenciled ribs. 
The stained glass is still being restored and should be finished by Christmas, he said. 
The church aiso has a new heating and air-conditioning system, a new sound system and increased fire orotec­tion. Dedrick said that Sa­cred Heart now has a new "computerized lighting sys-tern to highlight the ceil­ings." 
Ayad Al-Shaikh, a law stu­dent who remembers Sacred Heart as it was before the renovation, praised the changes. "I think they did excellent work restoring the church to its original Gothic style," he said. "The added guilding and the details on the pews restore the grandure of the church." 
"Now, the themes are not mixed, but are consistent throughout the church," he said.

Father Daniel Jenky, the rector of Sacred Heart Church, explained the church's Gothic Revival style. "The idea is, when you wor­ship on Earth you get a taste of heaven," he said, refer­ring to the ornate guilding and awe-inspiring paintings. 
Jenky said that the church has the largest and most well preserved collection of 19th century stained glass in the world. 
The church is "not the kind of Gothic church you would see in Europe," he said. Ac­cording to Jenky, the Sacred Heart Church differs from those in Europe because of the material it is made out of, not stone but instead mud bricks. Some people refer to this style as Prarie Gothic, he said. 
Despite the ornateness and grandure of the newly reno­vated church, Father Jenky stresses that it is used for worship. 
"Worship and God are a priority at Notre Dame em­bodied in that building," Jenky said, referring to Sa­cred Heart. "As important as that building is, what is important is the worship that occurs there." 


Jet crash kills 10 on way to Iraq 
WEST BERLIN (AP) -A huge 
U.S. Air Force plane that was ferrying equipment to U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf crashed and burned early Wednesday at the Ramstein Air Base in West Germany, a U.S. military spokesman said. Ten service members were con­firmed dead. 
Air Force spokesman Doug Moore said the C-5 cargo plane was part of the round-the-clock deployment of U.S. troops and supplies to Saudi Arabia and the gulf to deter Iraqi aggres­sion. He did not elaborate. 
Moore said that there were ten confirmed deaths among the military personnel on board, while two people were unaccounted for several hours after the accident. He said five people were in the hospital. 
Another Air Force spokesman, Capt. Ed Worley, said: "There were some deaths and some people are in the hospital, but we don't have the numbers sorted out yet." 
He said the cargo plane, headed to Frankfurt's Rhein­Main base, crashed and burned one-quarter mile from the run­way at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday. 
"It crashed in a field right off the west end of the runway," Worley told The Associated Press by telephone from Ramstein, about 300 miles southwest of Berlin. "We don't expect any civilian casualties." 
Worley said the C-5 belonged to the 60th Airlift Wing at Travis Air Force Base in California. He said it was flown by a crew from Kelly Air Force Base in Texas. 
The C-5 is the largest trans­port plane in the Air Force fleet. A military reference book. Jane's All the World's Aircraft, says the C-5 can carry up to about a quarter-million pounds of cargo. 
Worley said he did not know what kind of cargo it was car­rying and added that a boarrl of officers will investigate the fiery crash.

Smoke 
continued from page1 
Sandler shares a similar view against smoking. His letter 
said,  "Tobacco  smoke  kills  
more  people  in  this  country  
than  any  other  identifiable  

cause-some 350,000 deaths each year from excess strokes, heart disease, and cancers ac­cording to the Surgeon General." 
According to Taggarty Patrick, a Philip Morris Companies Inc. consultant for the Bill of Rights campaign, Hesburgh and others appearing in the ads were offered a "small honorarium" which they could accept or donate to charity. 
While Patrick could not reveal the amount of the honorarium, she did say that Hesburgh "definitely accepted for a char­ity." 
Conklin confirmed that Hesburgh donated the honorar­ium to a Notre Dame institute. 
Other prominent figures ap­pearing in the campaign include Lech Walesa and Charlton Heston. 
Patrick said that her office has received no specific com­plaints about the Hesburgh ad, but that she has seen "a few ed­itorial comments." 
The ad campaign was gener­ated from the National Archives' invitation to several companies to help celebrate the anniversary of the Bill of Rights. According to Patrick, Philip Morris Companies Inc. was the only company to re­spond. 
According to a press release from Philip Morris Companies Inc., the phase of the ad cam­
paign in which Hesburgh ap­pears "uses personal stories to convey the enduring value and impact of the Bill of Rights in 1990." 
"These individuals have lived extraordinary lives. Their sto­ries embody the Bill of Rights as a living document-as rele­vant today as it was 200 years ago," the press release said. 
Each of the ads offers a free replica of the Bill of Rights through an 800 number. Patrick said that the company has received three million re­quests for a copy of the docu­ment. 
Philip Morris Companies Inc. is the largest consumer pack­aged goods company in the world, Patrick said.

Local Osco slayings remain unanswered 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) ­Police offered little hope Monday for a quick arrest in the slayings of three Osco drug store employees, saying they have no suspect and just speculations about the crime. 
Detective Michael Swanson nevertheless called the case "extremely solvable" and said investigators were pursuing a thick stack of tips. 
Crime scene technicians spent a third day searching the westside store for clues, and may spend several more days there collecting evidence, said Police Chief Ron Marciniak. 
"We're taking our time and in essence, we're going from floor to ceiling in that building," the chief said. "We don't want to leave any stone unturned while we have control of the building." 
Pharmacist Tracy Holvoet, 24, of Mishawaka, assistant manager Scott Dick, 26, of Granger, and clerk Connie Zalewski, 43, of South Bend were found shot to death in the store Saturday morning. 
The fatal wounds were caused by a handgun which has not been recovered, police said. 
Police said cash, though not drugs, was missing from the store but otherwise released few details and declined to speculate how the crime may have occurred. "The evidence tells a lot of stories," said Swanson. 
Investigators have already received "numerous, numerous" tips, he said. "We're getting a lot of random information. Hopefully some of that will jell." 
Mayor Joe Kernan said the slayings "sent ripples of disgust and sadness" through the city. "I cannot describe the sorrow that is felt in this community because of what happened on Saturday," he said. 

Arctic could yield oil Exploration a possibility 
RENO, Nev. (AP)-Oil explo­ration in an Alaska wildlife refuge could help boost domes­tic production in response to the Persian Gulf crisis, U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Tuesday. 
"There is no reason why we should not explore in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge," Lujan said. "It's self-defeating not to have production." 
"The less production, the more tankers you have. Oil spills are due to tankers collid­ing," said the secretary, who was making a working vacation swing through the West. 
A number of spills, including one in 1969 off Santa Barbara, Calif., and the 1987 Pemex spill in the Gulf of Mexico, have come from offshore oil rigs, and others have involved pipelines. 
Lujan said one possibility was limited exploration in 1 million acres of the 18 million-acre refuge in Alaska's northeast corner east of Prudhoe Bay, the site of North America's largest oil discovery. 
Alaska's top elected officials also have endorsed exploration in the refuge following the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. 
At a U.S. Energy Department hearing on long-range energy planning in Fairbanks on Monday, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, a Democrat, and Republicans Sen. Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young testified in favor of granting leases for oil exploration in the refuge. 
The refuge was established in 1960 and enlarged in 1980 to protect caribou and other wildlife species. When Congress expanded the refuge, it post­poned any decision about oil exploration. 
Environmentalists said drilling in the refuge is not the solution to the nation's appetite for foreign oil.

Mellon Foundation gives ND $385k for research 

Special to The Observer 
The University of Notre Dame has received a $385,000 grant from the Andrew Mellon Foun­dation for its Helen Kellogg In­stitute for International Stud­ies. 
The funds will support an in­ternational research project entitled "Social Policies for the Urban Poor in Southern Latin America: Welfare Reform in a Democratic Context." 
Under the direction of 
-Guillermo O'Donnell, academic director of the Kellogg Insti­tute, participating scholars will analyze past, present and pro­posed social policies· relating to poor people in major countries of South America, particularly in Chile and Brazil. 
"We are grateful to the An­drew Mellon Foundation for this benefaction and proud of its recognition of the estimable reputation which the Kellogg Institute enjoys both here and in Latin America," said Univer­sity president Father Edward Malloy. 

Father Ernest Bartell, execu­tive director of the Kellogg In­stitute, emphasized the urgency of the research made possible by the Mellon grant. 
"At a time when the fragile new democracies of Latin America, while burdened by in­ternational debt and increased economic competition, must strive to realize the expecta­tions of previously repressed populations, the best mix of policies to alleviate poverty and meet basic human needs has yet to be determined," he said. 
The Kellogg Institute, estab­lished at Notre Dame in 1981, conducts research and aca­demic programs on a variety Of international development is­sues with a special emphasis on those of Latin American coun­tries.

Etzel wins Fulbright for 1990-91 
Special to The Observer 
Michael Etzel, professor of marketing at the University of Notre Dame, has been awarded a Fulbright Scholar grant for 1990-91. Etzel will use the grant to support his lecturing and research at the University of Innsbruck in Austria from September of this year until January, 1991. 
Etzel is one of the nearly 1,000 American Fulbright scholars who will go abroad to lecture or conduct re­search during the 1990-91 academic year. 
Established in 1946 under Congressional legislation introduced by Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, the Fulbright Scholar program is intended "to increase mutual under­standing between the people of the United States and the people of other countries." Program grants are awarded to Americans to lecture and conduct research abroad and to foreign schol­ars who wish to teach and study in the United States. 
More than 25,000 Ameri­can scholars have partici­pated in the Fulbright pro­gram. 
Etzel, a member of the University's business faculty since 1980, was graduated from the University of Port­land in 1964 and received master's and doctoral de­grees from Kent State Uni­versity and the University of Colorado, respectively. Be­fore coming to Notre Dame, he taught at the University of Kentucky and Utah State University. 
In 1985, he published, with John Gaski, associate pro­fessor of marketing at Notre Dame, a widely read article in the Journal of Social Be­havior and Personality asserting that there is no correlation between athletic success and mnnf1t.ary dona­
tions to universities.

DeKierk vows to investigate police role in recent killings 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -President F.W. de Klerk told church leaders Tuesday he would investigate charges that police sided against supporters of the African National Congress in recent township violence. 
Black leaders have blamed police for fueling the two weeks of savage street fights in black townships around Johannesburg that killed more than 500 people. 
Police said two black men were killed in unrest Tuesday, but the townships were peaceful for a fourth straight day following a government crack­down. 
Also Tuesday, police raided the headquarters of South Africa's largest labor federa­tion and arrested its secretary general, Jay Naidoo, and two others. The three were charged with kidnapping, robbery and assault. All three were later re­leased on bail, and Naidoo de­nied the charges. 
The raid followed a news conference at Naidoo's Congress of South African Trade Unions, where officials presented a man they said had been spying for the police, the 

independent South African 
Press Association reported. 
A delegation of church lead­
ers, including Anglican 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and 
the Rev. Frank Chikane, head of 
the South African Council of 
Churches, met in Pretoria with 
de Klerk and Adriaan Vlok, the 
law and order minister. 
After the two-hour meeting, Chikane told journalists the president had pledged to inves­tigate charges that police aided Zulu-based Inkatha supporters in the fighting against Xhosas and other blacks loyal to the African National Congress. 
ANC leader Nelson Mandela, Tutu and other anti-apartheid figures have said police bias toward Inkatha inflamed the situation. They accused police of disarming and scattering ANC supporters while allowing Zulus to carry crude weapons considered part of their tribal heritage and costume. 
Government officials have denied the charges. De Klerk has previously said individual officers may have acted im­properly, but the police force as a whole followed orders to be impartial.

Liberty 
closed by 

activists 
NEW YORK (AP) -Black ac­tivists Tuesday pitched tents on Liberty Island, forcing the clos­ing of the Statue of Liberty, to 

· mark the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech. 
They also said they want to rename the city for the slain civil rights leader. 
Separately, black construc­tion workers drove a honking caravan of trucks and backhoes to City Hall in a demand for more jobs. 
The Rev. AI Sharpton, a flam­boyant and controversial ac­tivist, and Lenora Fulani, who is running for governor on the New Alliance Party ticket, led about 100 people from City Hall down Broadway to Battery Park City, a skyscraper devel­opment at the lower tip of Manhattan. 
"We want to rename New York City Martin Luther King City," Fulani said at a rally at Battery Park City. "We want to reclaim the city for our people." 
They later headed out to Liberty Island, where Sharpton and an estimated 40 to 80 sup­porters forced the closing of the Statue of Liberty, said spokesman Manny Strilmp of the National Park Service. The demonstrators pitched tents there in support of the home­less, said Sharpton ally C. Vernon Mason. 
Strump said city police, na­tional park police and members of the Coast Guard were on the island, but no decision had been made as of late afternoon on dealing with the protest. 
He said the island was closed for the remainder of the day ­it normally closes at 5 p.m. ­and tourists who were on the island were taken off.

Differences abound between recent inVasions 
In recent weeks, a number of George Bush's critics have claimed that Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait was the same as George Bush's invasion of Panama. Thus, say the crit­ics, Bush's attacks on Hussein are hypocritical; the pot is call­ing the kettle black. While this argument is superficially logi­cal, it is wrong for at least three reasons. 
On the surface, the American invasion of Panama and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait are a lot alike. A large and militarily strong country launches a lightning invasion of a smaller neighbor and quickly gains vic­tory. The large country ignores criticism from abroad and sets up a friendly government in the small country. Meanwhile, the small country's weak neighbors look on in frightened silence. The similarity, however, ends here. 
The first major difference between the invasions of Kuwait and Panama is that America showed a great deal more respect for the Panamanian people than Iraq did for the Kuwaitis. The American invasion reflected the will of the Panamanian people (92 percent supported it, ac­cording to a Gallup poll). The Americans scrupulously avoided killing civilians. The Americans promptly placed in power the democratically elected leaders of Panama. 
The Iraqi invasion, on the other hand, clearly went 
In My Opinion Rick Acker 
against the will of the Kuwaiti people (e.g. the numerous anti­Iraqi demonstrations by Kuwaiti expatriates). The Iraqis, according to one Western diplomat, "littered the streets of Kuwait city" with dead civilians. The Iraqis de­posed the undemocratic, but popular, emir of Kuwait, mur­dered his brother and replaced him with a brutal puppet regime loyal to Baghdad. 
Second, America had a legit­imate national security problem in Panama, while Iraq could not have asked for a better neigh­bor than Kuwait. General Noriega provided arms to anti­American guerillas in El Salvador, provided numerous services for South American drug kingpins, and repeatedly threatened to use military force against Americans living in Panama. Kuwait, however, gave Iraq $8-10 billion in war loans, was Iraq's steadfast ally in the Iran-Iraq war and offered Iraq dirt cheap leases on Kuwaiti oil terminals. 
Third, America respected the national sovereignty of Panama, while Iraq has not re­spected Kuwait's. When America invaded Panama, it did not seek to extract any conces­sions from Panama, such as a new lease on the Panama Canal

DOONESBURY 

or a new military base. In fact, America responded to the inva­sion by giving Panama over $100 million in aid. Iraq, on the other hand, raped and then swallowed Kuwait. According to one foreigner who escaped after the invasion, Iraqi sol­diers stole "everything that wasn't bolted down: cars, household goods, computers, everything." Iraq recently an­nounced that all the deposits in the Bank of Kuwait ($3-4 billion) were being "given to the motherland (Iraq)." 
Within a month of the inva­sion of Panama, most American troops had gone home. More than a month after the invasion of Kuwait, not a single Iraqi soldier has been pulled out. According to news reports, the Iraqis have actually been send­ing more troops and weapons into Kuwait. Moreover, Panama is still an independent nation, not a part of the United States. 
Kuwait, though, has been "irreversibly and permanently annexed" by Iraq. 
The facts are clear. The American invasion of Panama was fully justified in its goals and execution. The Iraqi inva­sion of Kuwait was, in President Bush's words, an act of "naked aggression."

'Fiatliners' see the face of death and live to tell about it 
ELIZABETH VIDA 
accent writer 

In a summer filled with blockbuster movies such as "Total Recall," "Dick Tracy," and "Die Hard 2," none offer as fascinating and horrifying a premise as Joel Schumacher's "Flatliners." 
Five ambitious medical stu­dents set up a chilling and dan­gerous experiment to see the face of death and live to tell about it. They are led on their experiment by Nelson Wright (Kiefer Sutherland). They take turns stopping their hearts un­til the monitors reading their vital signs indicate nothing but flat lines-no brain or heart ac­tivity. After a length of time spent experiencing death, the other team members attempt to revive the dead member.

Mets win, gain on Pirates as Braves obliterate Pittsburgh 
NEW YORK (AP) -David Cone pitched a five-hitter and set up New York's offense by drawing a 14-pitch walk Tuesday night, leading the Mets past the San Diego Padres 4-0. 
Cone (10-7), second in the National League with 179 strikeouts, fanned just five. But he walked only one in his sec­ond shutout of the season and fourth complete game in 23 starts as the Mets got within two games of first-place Pittsburgh in the East Division. 
Calvin Schiraldi (3-7) lost his fifth consecutive decision and fell to 1-5 lifetime against his former club. The Mets beat San Diego for only the fourth time in 11 games this year. 
After Cone's walk in the third, he took second on Benito Santiago's passed ball and moved to third on Daryl Boston's single, with Boston taking third on the throw home. Dave Magadan followed with a single for a 2-0 lead. 
Braves 9, Pirates 0 
Charlie Leibrandt pitched a five-hitter for seven innings and Greg Olson drove in four runs with a double and a homer, carrying Atlanta over Pittsburgh. 
Leibrandt (6-8), who lost five of his previous six decisions, did not walk a batter as he handed the Pirates their fourth consecutive loss. 
Atlanta, with the worst record in the league, jumped on Pirates starter John Smiley (7­
7) for three runs in the first in­ning, chased him with three more in the fifth and got the fi­nal three on Olson's seventh homer. 
Reds 2, Cardinals 1 
Cincinnati continued its dom­inance of St. Louis as Jose Rijo pitched five innings and drove in the go-ahead run with a bunt single. 
The first-place Reds, 9-2 against St. Louis this season, have outscored the Cardinals 41-21. 
Rijo (10-6) allowed only one run despite giving up six hits and four walks in five innings. Relievers Tim Layana and Randy Myers finished the game, with each pitching two innings and allowing one hit apiece. Myers earned his 26th save in 30 chances. 
Rijo's second-inning bunt single also brought in what turned out to be the decisive run against Joe Magrane (8­15). The left-bander gave up just five hits in eight innings, retiring 10 in a row in the mid­dle innings. 

Cubs 5, Astros 2 

Ryne Sandberg's fourth-in­ning home run made him the first second baseman in history to have consecutive 30-homer seasons, and Greg Maddux pitched his seventh complete game in the Chicago's victory over Houston. 
Sandberg, who also had a sacrifice fly, led off the fourth with a homer over the left field fence, the Cubs' first hit off Bill Gullickson (8-12), who lost his fourth straight game. Sandberg, who had 30 homers last season, is the ninth second baseman to hit 30 or more in a season. 
Maddux (12-11) didn't allow a runner past second base until he surrendered two runs in the ninth.

No. 1 Stefan Edberg upset in first round of U.S. Open 
NEW YORK (AP) -Stefan Edberg, a victim of tennis burnout after a summer fling in the No. 1 spot, succumbed to his U.S. Open jinx and the rock­eting returns of a young Soviet star. 
Alexander Volkov, the Kaliningrad Kid, wielded a bright red racket "under a bril­liant sun and methodically took apart a surprisingly slow Edberg, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, Tuesday in the first opening­round defeat of a top-seeded man here in 19 years. 
Andre Agassi, who completed his rakish look with a dangling earring, scraggly beard and white bandana around long, black and blond hair, put on a show of power tennis in one of his best efforts since reaching the French finals. 
Jennifer Capriati, too young at 14 to worry about burnout, and fashionably dressed by her multi-million dollar sponsors, saved a set-point in the first set and won her Open debut as a pro. 7-5, 7-5, against a very tough 15-year-old, Anke Huber. 
Ivan Lendl, aiming to regain the top ranking that Edberg took away Aug. 13, five weeks after winning Wimbledon, 
easily  won  his  first-round  
match.  
Volkov,  a  left-bander  who  

switched from a two-fisted style about five years ago, excels at return of service and is able to handle with his fore­hand the kick on Edberg's serve that torments many right-ban­ders. 
Martina Navratilova, well-rested, had little trouble beating Federica Haumuller 6­4, 6-0 to advance to the second round. 
Zina Garrison, seeded fourth, advanced easily with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Beate Reinstadler, and Gabriela Sabatini, seeded fifth, beat Kathy Jordan, 6-1, 
6-1. 
Edberg, 24, won a career­best 21 matches in a row, starting with Wimbledon and running through three other titles, including the ATP Championships in Cincinnati. He reached the No. 1 ranking for the first time on Aug. 13, but now is in danger of losing it by year's end to Lendl or Boris Becker. Mats Wilander, another Swede who lost in the first round, had the shortest reign as No. 1 when he took over the top spot for 20 weeks after winning the U.S. Open in 1988. 
Despite Edberg's loss, he will remain No. 1 on the ATP com­puter rankings when they are released next on Sept. 10, the day after the U.S. Open ends. 
Edberg, knocked out in the fourth round here the past two years after reaching the semifi­nals in 1986 and 1987, has never won the Open. 
He looked sad and bewildered but he still managed a rare joke as he thought about his loss to Volkov. 
He said it was nice not to have airplanes buzzing over the courts, but quipped, "I sent up a lot of balloons instead." 
Volkov won the first four points of the tie-break and won it easily as Edberg

Fiery Mac mellows in comeback 
NEW YORK (AP) -He is unseeded now. An afterthought in the draw of the U.S. Open, trying to feel his way through the malaise that has gripped his game. 
And yet, John McEnroe still lights the fires of the fans at the National Tennis Center. 
They packed the stadium Tuesday to watch Johnny Mac fight a nearly three-hour battle for survival, barely beating Javier Sanchez . 
Was he generally happy with his game? 
''I'm generally happy nn:still in the tournament," McEnroe said. 
Hardly the kind of fire and brimstone you might have once expected from tennis' onetime enfant terrible. Times have changed though and Johnny Mac is the first to admit it. 
"I don't think any player wants his whole being based on 
whether  he  wins  or loses  a  
match."  
Can  that  be  the  same  

McEnroe who once routinely raged at line calls, who threw tennis tantrums at the slightest provocation? 
There were a few complaints in the Sanchez match, but it was almost as if Mac delivered them because they were expected. But he never was moved to rip ofT his loud, broad bandana and throw it to the court in anger. 
This is a kinder, gentler McEnroe, his face smeared with zinc oxide to fight ofT the sun. The old Mac would have scorned the sun, not protected himself from it. The old Mac might not have been as blunt about his chances. 
"I don't really like them," he said. "It's not like it's out there potentially. It's a question of all things coming together. I've progressed. I'd be happy to pick up another notch here. There's a lot of rust to get out. It's a long term project. Anything I do here is a bonus if I do well." 
A year ago, McEnroe's first tennis recovery had carried him to No. 4 in the world. Now he 
has drifted back down to  No.  
21.  
It  all  comes  down  to  

concentration, he said. "I didn't feel total concentration then," McEnroe said. "That's what I mean by 'being there.' If it doesn't come, the decision is easy."

Ware breaks in with Detroit 
PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) ­Andre Ware is a rich rookie. But he's still a rookie-and on his first day in the Detroit Lions' camp, he got the treat­ment reserved for rookies. 
When Ware entered a team meeting at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, an hour late because he had to take a physical examination, nobody spoke to him -except one crusty veteran who told him to take off his cap. 
"The purpose of a rookie quarterback is to blend in with his teammates," offensive tackle Lomas Brown said after two hours of practice in 95-de­gree heat. "By the same token, the team also has a duty to blend in with the quarterback, no matter who he is." 
At the moment, the Lions' quarterback is still Rodney Peete. But Ware, who ended his holdout Monday night when he signed a four-year contract worth $4.6 million, plus a $2 million signing bonus, will get plenty of chances to earn the job. 
Coach Wayne Fontes said Ware might play as much as 
half  of  Detroit's  exhibition  
game  Friday  night  in  
Cincinnati.  

"I look for Andre Ware to 
play a lot on Friday," Fontes said. "He might play a half. It depends on how Rodney and Bob Gagliano are going. He'll run the patterns he's comfort­able with. We'll call them for him." 
Peete, who has been very !>harp in leading the Lions to a 3-0 exhibition record, seized the moment to request a pay raise. Peete, the Lions sixth­
round  draft  choice  in  1989,  
signed  a  two-year  contract  
worth only $215,000.  

"There are a number of guys we know we've got to talk to and I intend to do that," said Lions general manager Chuck Schmidt, who joined the large knot of media, photographers and fans who showed up to record Ware's first practice. 
Out on the practice field, Ware got a crash course in the Lions' version of the run-and­shoot offense from assistant coach Mouse Davis. Davis would show Ware a diagram on a play sheet and Ware would watch either Peete or Gagliano run the play. 
"He's not familiar with spe­cific plays but he knows the ba­sics," Davis said. "He's not as far behind as your average rookie because he's been in the 

offense and he's been to our minicamps." Later, Ware began running a few plays. 
"I think he's way behind," Fontes said. "He thinks this is the same offense he ran in col­lege, but it's only similar. It's not the same. I would think right now he's got an uphill battle. It's unfortunate, but he'll have to sit a while." 
Ware set 26 NCAA records at the University of Houston, where he won the Heisman Trophy last season. He decided to pass up his senior season and made himself eligible for the NFL draft. 
Fontes said Ware would have to show he's better than Peete. 
"The best player will play for the Detroit Lions, regardless of position and regardless of where they were drafted," Fontes said. "You can put that in big print." 
Ware said he felt comfortable but wished he could have run more plays. 
"You won't be able to tell much about my ability after Friday, no matter how I play," Ware said. "If I have a good game, they'll say, 'He's not far behind.' If I don't, they'll say I am." 
Alzado's comeback comes up short 
EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) ­Lyle Alzada's dream of return­ing to the NFL at the age of 41 ended Tuesday when the Los Angeles Raiders announced his retirement.

tained his high school squad. "Basketball helps with my concentration, catching the ball and conditioning." 
His all-around athletic ability notwithstanding, Dawson gained national recognition for his pass catching. Rave reviews came from all sides despite Federal Way's consecutive 4-5 seasons. Dawson was rated one of the top 100 incoming fresh­men nationally by USA Today, Football News, Dallas Morning News, SuperPrep and Chicago Sun-Times. 
Losing records are something Dawson should not have to worry about at Notre Dame. The Irish have compiled a 24-1 record the past two seasons and strong recruiting cam­paigns the past several years should keep them near the top of the college football heap.

Naturally, one of the benefits of joining a top-flight program such as Notre Dame is that a player has the chance to prac­tice against some of the best athletes in the country.

Alzado was unavailable for

He went on the reserve­

other players were released to 
get down to the roster limit. 
"It's a good thing to have someone like Todd Lyght push­ing me every day," said Dawson. ''I'm bel!inning to learn how to read defenses. I have to learn how to adjust and they (the Irish secondary) really make it hard sometimes." 
Just as he makes it hard for Holtz to leave the practice field.

He's putting in the overtime 
Freshman Lake Dawson working for a starting position 
By FRANK PASTOR 
Associate Sports Editor 
Daily practice routinely ends around 6:30 p.m. for the Notre Dame football team, but for freshman wideout Lake Dawson, the pursuit of perfec­tion requires a little bit of over­time. 
Long after his teammates left the practice field Monday, Dawson stayed to field punts with a few players selected by Coach Jay Hayes and then worked on crossing patterns with receivers coach Skip Holtz and flanker Raghib Ismail. 
"You've got to run these guys off the field," marvelled Head Coach Lou Holtz, who post­poned his own exit long enough to take in the show. 
Dawson's intense work ethic and appreciation for the fun­damentals of the game have attracted the attention of both teammates and coaches, plac­ing him in the thick of the race for the starting wide receiver position. 
Dawson is an anomaly in today's high-profile world of sports. Heavily recruited out of Federal Way, Wash., Dawson gives the impression he is fran­tically fighting for a roster spot when, in reality, he is perhaps

the frontrunner for the starting receiver spot. He takes nothing for granted and works in earnest to master the technical aspects of big-time college football. 
"He is a class act and a class person," raved Holtz. "He is a dedicated player and a very tal­ented individual. He belongs here." 
The emergence of Rick Mirer at starting quarterback and Notre Dame's new emphasis on the passing game were both important factors in luring Dawson to South Bend and away from Pac 10 schools Washington, Washington State, Stanford and California. 
"Coach Holtz said Notre Dame still would run the ball, but there would be a more hal-

Relegated to third place in the 1990 NCAA Fencing Championships, the 
~~t;~~~~~::~::~:/~:: s~~~~;r:f t~; 
unlikely spot of Bruno's Pizza in west­ern South Bend. 
Head Coach Mike DeCicco addressed his fencers in his customary post-year way, trying to bring out the positive aspects of a season in which the team expected to win the national champi­onship but came up short. 
~ 
f~, ~' 

Scott Brutocao 
Irish Items 
About the only spirit that was still soaring when DeCicco took the podium was that of Jubba Beshin, who surprised everyone at the national championships by winning the indi­vidual epee title in his first year of collegiate competition by beating Dan Nowosielski of Princeton in back-to-hack bouts, 5-4, 5-2. 
But this was the team's day. DeCicco covered many topics in his speech, elaborating on the fact that finishing third in the nation is no small feat and that winning the national championship next year would take commitment and sacri­fice. 
Then the 29-year fencing coach shifted direction. All of a sudden he was making predictions about the next season. No, it wasn't piffie like, "We could do very well next season if we work hard." And it wasn't, "We are going to finish in the top three again next season." 
No, DeCicco went so far as to tell his friends and challenge his athletes that Notre Dame would win the 1991 national fencing title. 
There were stirs from the audience. Undoubtedly some stomachs, filled with pizza and pasta, turned. 
"It was one of those Pat Riley things," observed Beshin. 
Beshin looked at his friend, James Taliaferro, and knew nothing needed to be said. 
"When he said that we just kind of looked at each other, and though we didn't say anything we knew what was about to happen," said Beshin. "The team knew that they would have to follow through. It was for the honor of our coach, you know?" 
This sort of tacit understanding of things to happen has been inside Beshin ever since he started fencing. The confi­dence in being able to beat anybody on any day is common among most nationally competitive fencers, but Beshin is one up on the rest of the collegiate epeeists around the country. He followed through. 
"Fencing is like a balance," said Beshin. "You have to be on for that particular day. The day before (the individual championships), for the team championships, I wasn't fenc­ing to my best ability. But the next day, I was on. You've got to grab those days."

It also promises to open up the Irish passing attack. A four year letterman at Federal Way High School, Dawson led the South Puget Sound League with 46 catches for 634 yards and 14 touchdowns last season, numbers which earned him league offensive MVP honors. 
Dawson also lettered in bas­ketball and track, compiling district records in the 110 high hurdles and 300 hurdles. He has run the 110 high hurdles in 13.09. 
"Hurdling helps with my quickness and coordination," said Dawson, who twice cap-

Athletic Director Richard Rosenthal announced that Notre Dame football will now be seen on television in six European countries via a London-based cable company. 
Crossina another boundary 
NO announcesfootball package deal for European T.V. 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) ­Finally, the Irish will get to see Notre Dame football. 
A changing European televi­sion market has given Notre Dame a "window of opportu­nity" to sell its football broad­cast rights to a London-based sports channel, athletic director Dick Rosenthal said Tuesday. 
The Fighting Irish have a tentative agreement to have their games televised in six European countries -including Ireland -for three years beginning this fall. 
The deal, which was reached Monday, would allow London­based Screensport to use the feeds from Notre Dame games being televised in the United States, according to Rosenthal. 
Screensport is an all-sports satellite channel that reaches most of northern Europe. 

Rosenthal said a growing number of private television channels in Europe have opened the market for programming, but the market is still small. He declined to disclose terms of the agreement but said Notre Dame's earnings would be small. 
"I made it very clear we have gotten an agreement on it only verbally, but we have every con­fidence there will be a final deal," he said. 
In February, the Fighting Irish, whose television rights were held by ABC and ESPN, broke from the 64-team College Football Association to sign its own five-year, $37.5 million contract with NBC. 
NBC will have exclusive televi­sion rights to Notre Dame's 
home games for five seasons 
beginning in 1991. 

In Tuesday's editions of USA Today, Rosenthal said the idea of expanding Notre Dame's visibility to European television has been in the works for some time. 
"We've kind of looked at this for a couple of years," Rosenthal said. "I think it will be a major entry into the TV market in Europe." 
Overseas broadcasts will be live and tape-delayed, depend­ing on starting times and mar­ket demand, the newspaper said. 
England, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy and Ireland are the countries tar­geted to receive the broadcasts.
