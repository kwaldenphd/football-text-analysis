While everyone else is trying to put com·

The game is not for people with low frustration levels. If you want to pick up a book and the computer is programmed to respond to "get book," it won't give it to you if you type "take book." Most players who can cope with that sort of thing seem to enjoy solving the puzzk, says Skapura. -The Observer

Stock prices lapsed into a sharp decline in late trading yesterday as traders awaited President Reagan's State of the Union message. Analysts said the selling was prompted by speculation that Reagan might pull a surprise in the next few days and decide against running for re-election. The White House, however, said shortly af­
ter the market dosed that there had been no change in the plans calling for the president to announce his intentions for his political future on Sunday night. -AP

Woman SBP must promote controversy, not cooperation 
Women have attended Notre Dame for more than IO years, but a woman has never been elected student body president. 
As the deadline for student body president applica­tions approaches, one can only hope that a strong woman candidate will enter the race. 
Wh y? 
Male student body presidents misunderstand their 
roles -instead of serving as cattle prods to keep ad­
ministrators honest, they generally cooperate with Uni­
versity officials for the sake ofunity. 
Take the present student body pn:sident as an example. 
This time last year, The Ob$erver made a grave mistake -it endorsed Brian Callaghan for student body president. 
As far as dedication to the students goes, no one can doubt Callaghan's sincerity. Callaghan has been influen· tial in changing the laundry

Callaghan, however, entered the dispute last November, not to support the principle of the paper's fight with the administration, but to bring together both sides as an arbitrator. 
A student body president, unlike a politician, has no re-election campaign to fear -making enemies should be Callaghan's least worry. 
As such, conflict should be Callaghan's middle name. There are many burning issues with which to eon­front administrators. And kegs on campus is not a bur­ning issue.

each other as opponents," stid Callaghan. "As a result students fail to listen to and understand administration policies. Furthermore, the administration claims that students don't seem to con­sider the effects of their (administrators') programs over a long period of time. 
"We (Callaghan and Prevoznik) plan to eliminate these feelings by dealing directly with the administra­tion face-to-face. This avoids issues being blown out of proportion. Both sides must be open-minded. With such cooperation and communication, we can ac­complish our goals." 
One might suspect any critique of Callaghan by The Observer to be a knee jerk response to his failure to stick up for the paper In its fight with the administration. And in large measure such an observation is correct. 
As a student voice on campus, The Observer is a watchdog of all University affairs. But more important­ly, The Observer represents Notre Dame's loyal opposi­tion. 
As a man, it would seem 
quite logical for Callaghan to support cooperation within such a male-dominated household. 
Notre Dame women, on the other hand, are the bas­
tards of the Notre Dame family. They know what dis­
crimination is first hand. 
Only one woman, Assistant Provost Sister, John 
Miriam jones, is an upper-level administrator. Also, only 
20 percent of the family are women. 
As a member ofan oppressed group at Notre Dame, a woman student body president would best kno~ how to serve as leader of conscientious students who are tired ofpassively cooperating with a sexist University. 

Until a gutsy woman becomes student body presi· dent and openly confronts administrators about press­ing issues, students can expect little change in lhiversity policy. After all, confrontation brings issues out into the public. And administrators sure hate looking bad in public.

clubs to list members 


IWORLD BAZAAR! I
By MICHAEL). CHMIEL 
StaffReporter 
Each of Notre Dame's 174 clubs is 
being asked to submit a roster of 
dub members and their student 
identification numbers to the stu­
dent activities office by the end of 
this month. 
Student Activities Director James 
McDonnell, who made the request 
last week at the Notre Dame Presi­
dent's Dinner, said this information 
will serve as "concrete data to make 
statements about student involve­
ment at Notre Dame." 
With this information in its new 
computer system, McDonnell's 
office hopes to to direct programs 
toward involving all segments of the 
Notre Dame community in univer­
sity life. 
McDonnell said his office will not 
cite individuals for lack of participa­
tion, but will study "classes and col­
leges proportionately under the 
average level of involvement," and target programs toward these groups. 
"Right now we a<.·t on 
myths,"explaincd McDonndl,"thc 
computer will help us come up with 
important litctual information." 
"It <.'ould assist in planning 
programs and activities while allow­
ing us to come to an understanding 
of where we are at Notre Dame," 
continued McDonnell. 
Many schools across the country are now developing activity transcripts on each individual stu­dt·nt, similar to academic transcripts such as those found in the school's registrar's office. According to McDonnell, this is not the goal of this project. 
Instead, McDonnell's office has devised this system to study, for ex­ample, how many students from the College of"X" take part in dub "Y" or arc there significantly less "Z" yc:ar students involved with com­munity groups than the overall average should indicate. 
"New identifi<.·ation cards with all 
kinds of uses" will bt· introdu<.·ed 
next rear, explained McDonnell. 
The new cards will help the Univer­
sity dt·ttrmine how many students 
participate in specific events such as 
the number of "Z" }'t'ar students to 
atlend a concert, dance or lecture.

. selPhelp sessions starting,Jan. 30 
By RICH INGRASSIA 
News Staff 
How to cope with the tensions and aggravations of college life will be the topic of self-help sessions being made available to members of the Notre Dame community by the Free University program. 
Sponsored by the Student Health Center, the sessions will begin Jan. 30 and will be led by Luis Valdez, a counseling psychology graduate of Texas Tech University. 
The program will include a num­ber of self-help and Out Reach groups and will be open to students, staff, and faculty of the Notre Dame community. 
The Out Reach groups will address the problems confronted in everyday dealings with people and events. "The groups really have no­thing to do with illness," said Valdez, "nothing to do with serious psycho­lbgical problems, only with general coping with day-to-day issues. The program is wholly devoted to the 'normal' student." 
The sessions offered this semester 
:!re in three concentrations. The

first, beginningjan. 30, will focus on stress management. On Jan. 31, a group on building self-esteem will start and finally on March 26, there will be an assertiveness training course. Each group will meet for two hours, once a week for 4-6 weeks, at the Student Health Center. Valdez was the coordinator of a 
similar program at the University of 
Texas at Austin, which experienced 
considerable success the two years 
he worked there. In fact, such Out 
Reach groups are offered at most 
American Universities. 
As in the past, the program at 
Notre Dame will be run by a profes­
sional staff of doctorate level psy­
chology professors as well as Notre 
Dame psychology graduate students 
presently at work on their Ph.D.'s. 
Valdez emphasizes the program is for "anybody and everybody." Last semester there was a slight publicity problem, which resulted, Valdez ex­plained, "in small, yet very workable groups. We would like to see a big­ger turnout this semester." 
He said he would like students, 
faculty and staffto understand exact­
ly what the groups do, and what kind of unique interaction is possible be­tween intelligent, concerned people focusing on building and fortifying their characters. 

"The groups are quite structured, yet experiential and very education­al, based entirely on the exchange of ideas and experiences of the par­ticipants," said Valdez. "The first week ofeach session will be devoted to clarifying some definitions of es­teem, assertiveness or stress and thei: associated terms and concepts, and for everyone to get to know each other.·· 
For the remaining weeks, Valdez said the groups will concentrate on "what factors in your own day-to­day ordeals contribute to your inter­pretation of the personal pratfalls you may have. Finally. the groups will discuss what you say inwardly 
to yourselfas a guide to your feelings and behavior." 
Sign ups for the Out Reach groups will be conducted in two ways: first, through the Free University registra­tion from January 23-27 at the LaFortune Ballroom, or by going directly to the Student Health Cen­ter and contacting Luis Valdez.

So what if Mondale can't be stopped 
The aficionados of politics these days are putting the wrong question to the sooth­sayers. They keep asking, "Can Mondale be stopped?" The real question that cuts to the bone is "Can Reagan be beaten?" If he can't, then much of the puffing and panting of 
Max Lerner 
The Max Lerner Column 

Mondale and Glenn and the rest will turn out to be an academic exercise in the political rites ofpassage. 
The answer, of course, is that Reagan isn't invulnerable. He has hurt many and has in­flicted wounds on himself. Conceivably he can be stopped. But it would take a viable can­didate who isn't there, and a philosophy of government that the Democrats haven't yet develope' , and a popular sense ofconfidence that none 
fthe party leaders seems to inspire. 

If we assume that Mondale will be the nominee it follows that the Democratic game plan will be the economics of the AFL-CIO, the educational programs of the National Education Assn., the "social issues" of the NOW (National Organization ofWomen), the foreign policy of the Democratic liberals in and out ofCongress, and the defense policy of the anti-defense and nuclear freeze groups. 
Ifthe speeches based on this strategy were delivered by an impassioned Ted Kennedy, whose exit from the race cleared the way for Mondale as front-runner, the Democrats would stand a chance of winning. Delivered by Mondale they will generate widespread en­nui. 
Ifwe talk not of particular programs but of broad strategies, then the election strategy of the Democrats -whoever runs -has narrowed down considerably. The economic focus used to be on the jobless, but the Reagan recovery has undercut it. What the Democrats have left is the swollen Reagan budget -and they don't know what to do about it. 
The vanishing of the big economic issues 
has brought a shift to an attack on Reagan's 
foreign policies. Given the success ofGrenada 
and the stubborn refusal ofNATO to give in on 
the Pershing missiles, what remains for the 
Democrats is Beirut as a symbol of a possibly 
treacherous quagmire. 
The third element in the Democratic strategy will be a constant barrage against Ronald Reagan himself, as "mean" in his lack of concern for the poor while he hobnobs with the rich, and as "trigger happy" in a nuclear age. 
The Republican game plan will also be a triple strategy, but the difference is that the Republicans will point to visible accomplish­ments -the Reagan recovery in the face ofall the Democratic attacks, and the new note of resoluteness both in foreign and defense policy. 
The third axis of the strategy will be the popular appeal of Reagan himself. Even politi­cal scientists who are lifelong Democrats at­test, however reluctantly, to the way Reagan has come through surprisingly as a leader­figure who has reawakened American con­fidence and resolve. 
No one -not even the various entities and nonentities who have endorsed him -. will say that about Walter Mondale. 
The fault rests only in part with Mondale and the others. It rests with the internal intel­lectual climate within the Democratic Party itself, which has become a number ofpressure group fiefdoms associated only loosely with the party, operating on the principle of give and take, not in money but entitlements. 
This has squeezed both passion and prin­ciple out of the party and cut it off from the people themselves who gave it strength from FOR through LyndonJohnson. 
Thus barring some unforeseen folly or foreign policy disaster my guess right now is that Reagan will win the second term. Whether he will throw it away later, as Republican presidents have generally done, is another question.

Kerr assassination not just another attack 
Editor's note: This is the first of a two-part series on the assassination ofMalcolm Kerr, president of the American University in Beirut. 
When Malcolm Kerr fell to an assassin's bul­let last Wednesday morning, the only indica-

tion of a mishap was the sound of books that dropped from his hands to the floor. The gun­man had equipped himself with a silencer to muffle the explosive crack of his 7.65mm pis­t~l, ~ut Plid no ~eed to what his unsuspecting vtcttm w:ls carrymg. 
Thus tfe first portent of this tragedy for 
those on he third floor of the Administration Building t the American University in Beirut was not he peal of gunfire, to which they were grimly accustomed, but what seems less alarming, the clatter offalling books. 
Even amid the absurdity ofthis misdirected violent act, a shed of meaning survives. For it well befits this special man that at his death, it was not a shot, but this heavier noise that should be heard around the world. 
Inevitably, the publicity accompanying this event has tended to lump it with other recent disasters visited upon the official American presence in Lebanon. But to draw such a con­clusion is too easy and regrettable a misper­ception. 
In fact, this lates\ act of terror is 
extraordinary. It stands quite apart from the 
carnage inflicted upon diplomatic and 
military targets. _ _ 

To ignore this~ential difference is to grant, although unwittingly, a high degree of respect and even rationality to those who carried out this senseless and brutal slaughter. To call loud attention to this difference, on the other hand, is the humblest debt ofhonor due 
to the memory of this man and what he represented. The explanation for this crime as stated by the anonymous caller who claimed to speak 
for the killers was that Kerr "was a victim of the American military presence in Lebanon." 
But this claim so sorely distorts the whole character of the person involved that to assert it only discredits their own cause and it exposes them to plain view as merely desperate and fanatical men. 
From all the bloodshed brought on by this shadowy group known as Islamic Jihad, there is certainly no one who can doubt their in­tense zeal. 
But if the shortsightedness displayed by their earlier attacks has provoked such retalia­tion, it only proves their lack of political responsibility. This cold-blooded killing of Malcolm Kerr now destroys any credibility for their alleged religious idealism. 
Over the recent months, the sobering reservations that many expressed about the advantages of dispatching American and Allied troops to Beirut in the first place has grown in scale and in measure ofconviction. 
There is steady and increasing pressure on 
Washington from practically every quarter to 
arrange quickly for damage control rather 
than prolong the costly illusion of a 
reconstituted Lebanese state in the near 
future. Evidence in Congress, the State 
Department and the Department of Defense 
abounds. 

It is in this same light that the great masses 
of Americans will almost automatically inter­
pret whatever the daily press informs them is 
occurring over there. 

These murderers, for all their dangerous confusions are nonetheless fully aware of this obscure perception on the part of the American public. Their attack on Kerr was deliberately calculated as an act of propagandaand intimidation. It has probably in some narrow sense succeeded.

Irish once again paced by Sluby in 59-56 OT win over Davidson 
By CHUCK FREEBY 
.\jmrts Writer 
Throughout 13 years ofcoaching, Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps' hair has become grayer and grayer. Last night's game against Davidson hdped spt><:d up the process. 
Bdtind 22 points hy senior cap­tain Tom Sluhy, tht· Irish struggkd to a ';')-56 overtime victory over the upset-minded Wildcats hdort· a nowd of I0,61-l...., at the Athletic and (:onvocation Center last night. For the Irish, it was their I Oth win in the last 12 games and raised their overall n.:cord to I 2-';. Meanwhile, coach Bohhy Hussey's young and scrappy Davidson duh falls to 6-I I on tht: yt·ar. 
After playing every other night for the last WtTk, Phdps realized his duh was showing signs of fatigue. "I think it was obvious we were a little tired tonight," noted tht: Irish men­tor. ··wt·'vt· played three gamt:s in five days, hut we have to do that he­t·aust· you play t:vt·ry other day in post-season action." 
Phdps may ht looking ahead to tournament play, hut he knows the h ish will have to turn in ht:tter pt:r­formam:es down the stretch than they did last night. Notrt: Dame shot a mist·rahle 40 percent from tht: floor on the evt:ning, including a dis­mal 9-for-27 first-half performance. Poor foul shooting continued to plague the Irish as wdl, as they only connected on 66 perct:nt of their ef­forts from the charity stripe. 
Nevt·rthekss, on this t:vening tht: Irish wt·re able to get hy, thanks to strong dforts hy the flu-stricken Sluhy and Tim Kempton. Sluby onct: again came through time after timt: with the game on the line, scoring seven ofNotrt: Damt:'s nine points in ovt:rtime. Meanwhile, Kempton continued his resurgence during the second half of the seao;on, nt:tting 14 points and collecting I I rebounds 
while playing the entire game. 
Tht· visiting Wildcats did their best to give the game away in the first half, committing IS turnovers in the first twenty minutes. Unfor­tun:ttdy, the Irish were unabk to convert and needed six straight points from Sluhy to break away to a 2';-I H lead with four minutes left in the half. Davidson managed to close the gap to thrt:e when tht: Wildcats' leading scorer. Kenny Wilson, scort·d his first points ofthe night on a jumpt-r with 2:05 left in tht: half, 
hut a Kempton tip-in along with an imprt:ssive slam dunk hy the Irish centt:r widened tht· margin to 31-24 hy halftime. 
"We forced 15 turnovers in the first half, which should have meant a 16-to-1 H point lead, not a seven­point lead at half," said Phelps. "If you have that kind of lead, it's a dif­ferent kind ofgame." 
However, the Irish couldn't handle the prosperity of the lead tht:y had. Davidson chipped away at the lt:ad in the second half, trailing hy only one at 38-:P when center Jim McConkey threw home two of his 20 points with a jumper from the ldt baseline. The Wildcats finally <:aught the Irish, when Chris 
Heineman, who guided Con­nt:rsville High School to the Indiana state prep championship lao;t winter, converted a three-point play to tic the score at 44. 
After trading baskets for the next five minutes, Davidson's senior for­ward Kenny Wilson gave the Wildcats their first lead since early in tht· first half hy tipping in his own miss with exactly four minutes left to make the score 50-48. Notre Dame knotted the score at 50 when reserve guard Joseph Price sank a pair offree throws at the 3: I 7 mark. 
Following a Davidson miss, Phelps pulled his offense out to halfcourt in an attempt to pull the Wildcats out of their zone. "It was my decision to play for the last shot at the end of regulation," said Phelps. "I thought Uoe) Howard had the shot." However, "Small Wonder," who earned his first start due to an injury toJoJo Buchanan, had his jumper fall short, and Davidson called timeout with five seconds remammg. Heineman let a jumper fly from 25 feet with three second!i left and missed the mark to send the game into overtime. 
It was time for Sluby to take over, as he connected on two jumpers to give the Irish a 54-SO lead. Following a Wilson rebound goal, the Irish sank pressure free throws, taking ad­vantage ofthree Davidson turnovers in the final two minutes. Jim Dolan connected on both ends of a one­and-one to give Notre Dame a five­point lead at 57-52 with 16 seconds left, hut McConkey answered with a jumper from the top of the key with 12 seconds remaining. Sluby iced the game when he wa'i fouled on his way to the hoop, and then converted both free throws. Wilson's dunk at 

The omcrver/Thorn Bradky 

the buzzer only served to close the final margin. 
"We played poorly, but we won and that's the important thing," commented Phelps. "I was disap­pointed in our offensive and defensive rebounding, (but) that's what happens when a team is tired." 
On the other hand, Davidson coach Bobby Hussey had plenty of praise for his young team. "Our guys played awfully hard," said Hussey af­terwards. "We made a lot of mistakes, hut that's what happens when you have a young team. I looked out there when there were three minutes left and saw we had two sophomores and three fresh­men on the court and thought we must not he doing too badly." 
Next for the Irish is a date with fifth-ranked Maryland Saturday after­noon in the ACC, and Phelps knows his team will have to be at their best. "Saturday will he a typical Notre Dame moment," said Phelps. "There's no pressure on us; we'll go out there and have fun. Maryland is a Final Four team and I say that be­cause they have the hest shooting and the best rebounding team in the country." 
With that being the case, Digger might want to invest in some Grecian Formula stock before Satur­day. If the Maryland game is any­thing like last night's contest, the veteran Irish coach will have a white coiffure by the end ofthe weekend.

Bowie first started skating at the age ofthree, and didn't begin playing organized hockey until he was six. He was a center and left wing until his final year ofhigh school when he started playing defense. 
"I was recruited hy Michigan State and some Ivy League schools. My frrst visit was down here," he says. He finally decided to go to Notre Dame because of its "prestige and reputation for good sportsmanship." 
Next year Bowie plans either to go to work in his home town of Toronto or to play hockey in Europe. Coach Smith is helping him apply for a visa. "He'd give you the shirt off his back," Bowie says of Smith. 
Bowie has little to complain about of his four years at Notre Dame. 
"It's been a good experience. meeting new people and being away from home. Sometimes it's been tough to keep both academics and hockey up, but it's got to he done."
