South Shore Rallroad may have to eliminate South Bend service 
ByDAVIDT.LEE 
News Stoff 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu· dents who usc the South Shore Rail· road to travel to Chicago soon may have to find a new mode of transportation. 
The South Shore, plagued by million-dollar debts, may eliminate its passenger service to South Bend If it Is unable to obtain further income from the Indiana legislature, according to john Robbins, a senior analyst for the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District. 
"It's premature to guess at this point, but there's a possibility that South Bend may be eliminated (from passenger service)," said Rob· bins. "The solution will likely Impart ... a reduction in services." 
Such a reduction, he added, would mean that services-would run only from Chicago to Michigan City, Ind. 
The South Shore has a S4.8 million deficit, according to Robbins. Operating costs for the railroad amounted to approximately Sl7.6 million, while passenger fares and the state of Indiana provided only U 3.9 million in income, he said. 
Skyrocketing electric and In· surance costs are part of the problem. "liability insurance has gone up substantially," said State Representative D. Patrick Bauer, D· South Bend, "(which has) tremen· dously increased costs." 
A recent fare increase of 10/ will be augmented by another 5/ In· crease on February 1. "It'll be a por· tion of the solution," said Robblns,"but as long as there's no stable revenue from the counties themselves, the service Itself will be in jeopardy." 
The Indiana legislature has been reluctant to ball out the railroad. Bauer, who estimates the deficit runs at only S1.5 to S2 million, believes the NICTD "has to come In with better figures." He added that "If they can substantiate the evidence ... they may put In a loan." So far, however, the NICID "hasn't convinced the Indiana legislature." 
The NICTD, which operates the South Shore's passenger service, Is required by contract obligations to provide the necessary revenue to administer the service. One plan Included the usage of Income generated by the Toll Road, which is operating above costs. But the plan was not accepted by the legislature. Additionally, residents of four In· diana counties, including St. joseph County, have rejected a plan propos· lng a gasoline tax, which would be used to fund the railroad. 
Even If the railroad does receive additional funds to stay alloat, there is no guarantee the same problems will not arise next year, Robbins said. It will "always be a long term problem, given a lack of local sup· port," he added. 
He said as a . result, the railroad may curtail Its service or eliminate the NICTD altogether.

ND trustee discusses social life, alcohol use 
By FRANKJ. MASTRO 
Senior StoffReporter 
The issue of social life on campus is too Important to overlook, ac­cording to Board of Trustees mem­ber Terrence Keeley. 
"'lllcse party rooms arc not being used and the students are displeased with the social life. Creativity Is being stifled," said Keeley, who sought Input from the student senate at a Saturday afternoon con­ference. 
"I sec this as a valuable oppor­tunity to see that some of the issues students fcc:l Important are raised," said Kec:ley, one of two board mem­bers under the age of 30. 
Much of the talk about the social 
life on campus dealt with the im­
plementation ofthc alcohol policy. 
"Drinking on campus was a 
problem," said Keeley, "A serious 
change In the rules had to be made 
and the Board was completely sup­
ponlvc of the effort." 
"There arc occasions where 
mature drinking should be per­
mitted, but those situations have not 
yet arisen In the minds of the ad­
ministration", said Keeley, who 
serves on the Academic and Faculty 
Affairs Committee. 
The belief that the heavy drinker 
has been forced behind close doors 
was expressed by many Senate

SMC administrator settles into new post 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI 
Senior StoffReporter 
Although she has had the job for only one week, Saint Mary's new director ofstudent activities already Is planning one of her first projects. 
The new director is Mary Ellen Smith and one of her first projects will be Improving fresh­man orientation, she said. 
Smith plans to establish a fresh­men orientation course that she said has been used succesfully at many colleges nationwide. The course would help students as­similate Into their new environ­ment and would help freshhmen get to know themselves and their new community, she said. 
Now, however, Smith said she is trying to get used to the new post. 
"It's an Incredibly big job. There are many responsibilities that I wouldn't have Imagined," she said. 
"I'm just trying to get It all In and straightened away. I want to keep up with what's already going," she said. 
"I'm trying to meet people and get a grasp on procedures and policies," Smith said. Soon, however, she said she hopes to begin work on spring com­mencement, the senior trip and fall orientation. 
Smith replaces Mary Ann O'Donnell, who left the student activities department in good shape, Smith said. 
She said a visit to Saint Mary's inftuenced her decision to take the job. "I was so totally Impressed by the students and faculty," she said. "The students care and take action about what happens to them now and In the future. 
"It was a real refreshing atmo­sphere," Smith said. "I like the energy you feel on campus." 
Smith said she is also Impressed by Saint Mary's view towards women adminlstartors. "The administration has a real high regard for professional women. There Is a commitment here," she said. That commit­ment Is lacking at some othercol­leges, she said. 
For the past three and a half years Smith has worked In the admissions department of In­carnate Word College in San An·

Stephen Kertesz, professor emeritus of government and inter· national studies at Notre Dame and former Hungarian minister, died . yesterday morning at his South Bend home. 
Kertesz had suffered a heart attack earlier In the month. He was 81. Funeral services will be Tuesday at 10 a.m. in Sacred Heart Church. 
Kertesz joined Notre Dame's political science department in 1950, and for 25 years was respon· sible for much of the University's 
development  of  classes  and  
programs  In  the  international  
sphere.  

As a Guggenheim fellow ( 1958· 
59) and grantee of the Rockefeller Foundation ( 1965-66), he studied the new methods and problems of contemporary diplomacy In Wes· tern European countries. He received the Lay Faculty Award In 1963 and a Special Presidential Award In 1975. 
He was the Director of the Program ofSoviet and East European Studies for fifteen years, Chairman of the Committee on the International Relations and Director of the In· stitute for International Studies until his retirement in 1975. He held an honorary doctorate of law from In· diana University. 
He recieved diplomas from the Universities of Budapest and Paris; studied as a Rockefeller Fellow at Yale, Oxford and Geneva and was a docent in International Law at the University in Budapest.

In the Hungarian Foreign Mini· stry, he belonged to the group ofof­ficials which tried to keep Hungary out ofwar and later, In contact with the Allied Powers, to conclude an early armistice. After the Nazi coup d'etat In Hungary he was arrested and passed through prisons and con· centration camps, and was court· 
martlaled and accused oftreason. He

effective International protection of 
national minorities. 
In 1947 he was appointed Mini­ster to Italy. When the Communists forced the resignation of the Prime Minister, the government ordered Kertesz to return to Budapest. At the same time Newspaper headlines In· formed the Hungarian public that he would be the new Foreign Minister. After conferences with Western -diplomates, he realized that ef· fecth:e Western support was not forthcoming for free democratic developments In Hungary and decided to refuse to return to

Long search for social life will end with new attitude 
When Charles Dickens died in 1870 he left the world with a mystery -that of Edwin Drood. The English novelist had penned Master Drood's death in six of 12 contracted installments, but he was unable to reveal the murderer to his readers before natural causes claimed him. 
On the New York stage this season, director Rupert Holmes and his cast are bringing the puzzle to the public. Each night the actors perform Holmes' adapta­tion of Dickens' novel, until there is no more novel ­then they turn to the audience for a vote. Who killed Drood? Was it the demure, blushing Rosa Bud? Or the respectable Rev. Crisparkle? Or the dashing foreigner, Neville Landless? Once the audience's votes are tab­ulated, the cast finishes the play according to its patrons' wishes. 
At Notre Dame a remake of "Edwin Drood" is in production. On this off-Broadway stage, the victim is not a young Englishman, but the long-suffering Social life. As for the culprit, the

Not all students take notice of the growing structure just west of the limestone columns. A gang of under­graduates lies by the edge of the stage with their heads slumped on their hands.

policy." 
As the executive assistant to the president stands resolutely and mumbles something about respon­sibility and liability and the law, a senior stoops to ex­plain to a few curious freshmen about Dillon beer baths, with Old Milwaukee flying and Domers tottering. 
Meanwhile, Joni Neal, director of student activities, crumbles under the pressure of glaring students. "We give!" she sputters. "What kind of activities do you really want?" (She repeats this col)fession in a letter to the editor, January 16.) Clenched in her fist is an in­creased budget she received from boosted student ac­tivity fees. 
Just then a group of students -most of them class officers and several cowering SAB chiefs -throw their arms into the air in frustration. Some wanted to stomp off the stage right then, but a few die-hards put their shoulder to the grindstone in an attempt to revive So­cial life. 
"Hey Domers, this is your university; this is your life. Take it into your own hands and have fun." 
With such inspiration the stage soon would be alive with excitement, because attitudes are contagious. Sud­denly Neal stops stammering and works with students to plan activities and events. Students wake up to take responsibility for their own social life. 
Then, as strains ofthe Victory March float up from the orchestra pit, the now-glowing Social life leaps to her feet. But no one seems to notice, because they have realized that Social life was never really an individual character to kick around, spill beer on, or complain about. Social life is a part of each and every character. And each character can decide what to do with it. He or she can make the most ofit, or stay locked in his or her dressing room.

"They (the administration) have not taken the most creative ap­proach," said Keeley, "We need more creative responses to the problem." 
Keeley also pointed out that the Board of Trustees is concerned about all aspects ofthe University. 
"The Board is supporting growth in the library, computerization of the school, and the situation with minorities and bright students who can't come to Notre Dame", said Keeley. 
Daley Plaza, renamed Bears Plaza for the day. 
"All the real Bear fans are here," said 7-year-oldjeremiah Winns, who carried a teddy bear wrapped in winter clothes as protection against a wind chill that registered at 36 below. 
At one point, the crowd reached nearly 1,500, but it began to thin as the game progressed and the cold took its toll. 
Shopping centers closed early. Refrigerettes cheerleaders -as un­abashed about their bulk as 300­pound defensive tackle William "The Refrigerator" Perry -rooted for their team at a downtown fitness club. A high school band staged a parade. 
Thanos Grigoriou, 36, of Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Jo Anne Baboulas of Chicago began their wedding ceremony at the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church just as the game kicked off. "I didn't realize it was a Super Bowl Day" when the wedding date was set four months ago, Grigoriou said. 
In suburban Bloomingdale, Shel­don and Barbara Sherman faced the same problem at their wedding. 
Rabbi Arnold Kalman, who kept an eye on his 2-inch television, said he had hoped to time the service to coincide with halftime. "It was the pre-game festivities that threw me off," he said. 
Most Chicagoans count 1963 as the year of the city's last major sports championship, when it captured two. Loyola upset power­house Cincinnati 60-58 in overtime in the NCAA basketball final. Then the Bears defeated the New York Giants 14-l0 in the NFL title game. 
In pre-game festivities Saturday night, Bears fans jammed Rush Street, where police early yesterday arrested 30 people on diS<>rderly conduct charges. All were released on bond. 
"There is a very large committ· ment to new scholarship funds. Scholarship money is high priority", said Keeley. 
"Generally, I was impressed by the caliber of individuals on the Board," said Keeley, "There are great business leaders, great politi­cal leaders and people who really want to do the best thing for the Uni­versity." 
Keeley also emphasized that the Board is composed of many people who care about the University and want direct input. 
"The Board is much more liberal than the student body thinks," said Keeley, "I think that the Trustees are excellent stewards of the Univer­sity." 
Keeley pointed out the strength of the Board saying that the Board will be extremely influential when it comes to choosing the next presi­dent of the University. 
"The Board does run the place," said Keeley, "It selects the president, it has incredible influence on the direction ofthe University." 
"The next president will be elected without pressure from the present administration," said Keeley. 
Keeley also reflected on his ex­periences and what he has gotten out ofhis years of Notre Dame. 
"We have to cling to our most im­portant identity which I happen to regard as our Catholic identity," said Keeley.

He said the arcs are about 30 to 36 miles long, all outside the nine rings discovered from Earth in I977 and a 1Oth ring whose discovery by Voyager was announced Saturday. 
Burton Edelson, associate ad­ministrator for space science for the National Aeronautics and Space Ad­ministration, said earlier that Voyager "found evidence of 10 addi­tional rings . . . with indications of many more to come." 
But Lane said scientists don't yet know if the arcs extend around the planet as complete rings. 
The arcs were invisible to Voyager's television cameras, but were detected with a device called a photopolarimeter, a light-sensing device that measured changes in starlight when the rings and arcs were between the spacecraft and a distant star. The technique allows the detection offine, dark particles. 
Voyager, which also has dis­covered I0 moons in addition to the five major ones that were dis­covered from Earth, sped away from Uranus on yesterday at more than 33,000 mph and will be more than 2 million miles from the planet bv this 
morning. It approached within 
50,679 miles of the seventh planet 
Friday. 
Incoming pictures of Ariel, Oberon and Titania -three of Uranus' five largest moons -showed broad valleys, a mountain four miles high and numerous impact craters, some with dark material on their floors that geologists believe flowed from within the planet. 
Edelson said geologists will be busy for years analyzing the pictures of the moons, especially the amazingly detailed photos of the 300-mile-diameter Miranda. 
The moon has deep canyons; a gigantic, oval-shaped formation resembling a racetrack; an area that looks like it was swept by a broom; and a huge, highly unusual, square­cornered features that looked some­thing like a bird's-eye view ofa tilled farm field.

Working in admissions did not allow Smith to work as closely with students as she would have liked, she said. Admissions work is more of the business side of college administration, she said. 
Smith said she took the student activities director job so she could work closer with students. "I had been used to working with students in residence halls," she said. "You don't get to work as closely with them in admissions. I want to stay more in touch with students than admissions work allows."

Libyans protest U.S. policies 
TRIPOLI, LIBYA -Ubyan politi­cal science students massed yester­day outside the Belgian Embassy, which represents U.S. interests in Ubya, and chanted "Down, down U.S.A.!" 
The hundreds ofstudents shouted themselves hoarse, calling on "the aggressor Reagan" to go home and yelling anti-American slogans. Their enthusiasm lessened when a light rain began to f.ill. 
The students were not violent and made no attempt to storm the Bel­gian Embassy, on the third floor of a crumbling apartment building near the harbor. Members of civilian "people's committees" wearing offi­cial armband~ kept order on the fringes of the crowd. 
A Belgian official said the students "have once again missed their real target. They don't seem to know that the embassy's American interests section still operates inside the old American Embassv." 
The old U.S. embassy, in Tripoli's Dahra Section, has been closed since 1981. It now flies the Belgian flag and few Ubyans seem to know that Belgian officials carry on American consular business there. 
Before their demonstration, the students met for two hours yester­day with Western reporters in a clas­sroom at Tripoli University and discussed what the students called "American imperialist threats" such as the current U.S. 6th Fleet naval and air exercises offof Ubya. 
Ubyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy has said Ubyan suicide squads would be let loose in U.S. cities if Reagan mounts a retaliatory attack. 
"The Libyan people are ready for death," student leader Ahmed el­Hadi, 22, told reporters yesterday. "We are prepared to fight back against American aggression even though we know America is a super­power. We are prepared to die for our cause." 
Nun claims police recruit children to picket Bishop Tutu's return 
JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA -An anti-apartheid black Roman Catholic nun says police tried to recruit young blacks to picket Bishop Desmond Tutu when he returns from a tour of the United States, it was reported yesterday. 
The Sunday Star of Johannesburg said Sister Bernard Ncube told of children from the black area near her home in Kagiso, west ofJohan­nesburg, complaining that police tried to enlist them to heckle the bis­hop when he returns home. 
Tutu, Anglican bishop of Johan­nesburg and winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, has been touring the United States, speaking out in Washington, New York and other cities in support of stronger U.S. sanctions against the white-led South African government. 
The nun, head ofthe mostly black Transvaal (Province) Federation of Women, said children told her police promised to drive them toJan Smuts Airport, 40 miles east, when were to be supplied with placards criticizing Tutu. Tutu is expected home soon, but it was not clear yes­terday exactly when he planned to arrive in Johannesburg. 
Tutu  arrives  home,  The  Star  
reported.  
The  paper said  the  youngsters  

Apolice spokesman denied the al­legation, saying, "The police just do not do those sort of things. It is not their job." 
Based on letters to the editors on newspapers, Tutu's criticism of South Africa appeared to have an­gered many. The Johannesburg Daily Star reported that many white callers in a telephone call-in poll believed Tutu "should be locked up or shot." But black callers said Tutu's positions accurately reflected black thinking. 
South Africa issued a stern war­ning over the weekend to Botswana, the last of South Africa's neighbors believed to be used as a staging base for violence by anti-apartheid guer­rillas. 
On Saturday night, after Lesotho evicted 60 supporters of the African National Congress guerrilla force, South Africa threatened to send troops into Botswana to chase the ANC from that usually placid South African neighbor. 
"That infiltration route (Botswana) will have to be closed, or the defense force will take ap­propriate action," said Foreign Mini­ster Roelof Botha. 
The reply from Gaborone, Bostwana's capital, was swift. The office of Botswanan President Quette Masire issued a statement saying: "we have always said that if anyone knows of any bases or in­filtration routes in Botswana, he is free to come and show them to us. Mr. Botha's threat to send the South 
African  Defense  Force  into  
Botswana  is  completely unwar­ 
ranted."  

The military seized power in landlocked Lesotho a week ago and promptly agreed to South African demands to expel the ANC. South Africa alleged the ANC used Lesotho as a springboard for sabotage inside this racially segregated, white­dominated country. 
Pope visits as 'pilgrim of peace' to unify Catholic Church in India 
NEW DELHI, INDIA -Pope John Paul II, making the first official papal trip next weekend to the Hindu homeland of Mahatma Gandhi, visits a nation divided by piety, poverty and bitter sectarian conflicts. 
Invited by the Indian govern­ment to tour this nation of750 mil­lion people, which approximates the size of the world's Catholic community, the pope said yester­day from the Vatican that he will visit as a "pilgrim ofpeace ... a pas­tor sent to confirm among brot­hers of the faith an ecclesiastical unity." 
Christianity, however, is regarded with suspicion in India as a colonialist ideology. Sometimes the Virgin Mary is depicted in a sari as Indian churches have attempted to shed the image of a foreign church and adopt Indian customs. 
Christian missionaries are criticized for converting un­touchable Hindus and im­poverished pagan tribals, for stirring the lower classes to demand their legal rights. The Vatican to many Hindus represents a foreign Catholic minority that makes up less than 2 percent ofthe population. 
Pope John Paul will travel through India for 10 days under tight security, including a bullet­proof limousine. His tour of 14 cities starts Saturday in New Delhi and includes stops in Calcutta, Madras, Goa and Bombay. 
Hindu zealots have declared the pope unwelcome and demanded he cease conversions. They have planned anti-Catholic demonstra­tions in New Delhi and Bombay, and two death threats against him have been reported. 
Militant slogans, spray-painted In Madras, say: "there's No Hope, Pope, Go Home" and "The Pope Is A CIA agent." 
In the Indian Catholic com­munity, there is dispute over "liberation theology" In a nation of overwhelming poverty, sickness, illiteracy, inequality and dis­crimination. "Untouchable" Chris­tians, like Hindu outcasts, have been protesting discrimination against them In Madras. 
Activist priests and nuns have been criticized and transferred by the church for demonstrating on behalf of poor fishermen In the state of Kerala, and for supporting landless untouchables oppressed by Hindu landlords and moneylenders in the state ofBihar.

Faith in Christ helped woman through 'Dark Ages' 
Fifty-one years ago, on the feas~ ofthe Epip­hany, a book called "The Mystical Body of Christ in the Modern World" was published in Ireland. The author, a distinguished theologian and philosopher, was Father Denis Fahey. The book received a Nihil Obstat -a declaration that the Church's magisterium found no error in the work -and there is a glowing forward written by the Most Reverend J. Kinane, bishop of Waterford and lismore. The book, which is on loan to me, is from the collection ofCatholic arcana belong­ing to an old friend in South Bend. 
Ann Pettifer 
guest column 
My friend, who is fast approaching 80, is connected to Notre Dame through her hus­band and sons, who are alumni. But her deepest connection is all her own. During what she calls the "Dark Ages of the Church," (by which she means the 1940s and 1950s,) she was active in the liturgical renewal move­ment spearheaded by Notre Dame's Father Michael Matthis. 

Through this participation she anticipated some of the reforms which would arrive on the universal Church scene after Vatican II. What has long fascinated me about this woman is that she is the product of the same epoch of the Church that produced both the author and the promoter of "The Mystical Body ofChrist in the Modern World." 
It is ages since I have read anything so dis­turbing; it is a horrible, wicked book and it demonstrates vividly how desperately the Church needed Vatican II. The author begins and ends by peddling every mendacity about Jews that he can lay his hands on. His evidence for Jewish machinations, "The Protocols of Zion," is that same spurious tract that Hitler was to use to justify his final solution. 
While Fahey hews to a traditional Catholic social justice line, which is to say he con­demns capitalism and communism, he traces both systems to a Jewish conspiracy. Jews, he opines, have turned money into a commodity and Jews plotted the Russian Revolution. Bet­ween them, these Jewish systems finally will enslave humanity, destroying God's plan for creation. 
Fahey's reading of God's plan represents an age-old temptation of Roman Catholicism, namely triumphalism, which holds the right order will prevail only when the hierarchical Church has imposed its control over the world, creating a global theocracy. The notion that the Church's role should be that ofsuffer­ing servant, learning from the world as it helps to transform it, is alien to this Thomist. After sifting through this book I wohdered, not for the first time, whether Thomism should be retired: the angelic doctor's metaphysics seem so open to abuse from people whose agenda is power. 
If rabid anti-Semitism is far and away the most vicious aspect of this book, (and con­sider how works of this sort would have fanned the flames, five years on, of the Nazi holocaust), a nasty secondary theme surfaces. Tilis time it is the demonic nature of the Protestant Reformation. 
There is no mention of the ecclesial abuses ofthe Catholic side, which were at the root of the Protestant revolt. Instead, Martin Luther, who is portrayed as Lucifer's point-man, is held entirely responsible for sundering Chris­tendom. 
After reading Fahey's book, chills ran down my spine when the newspapers reported that at the recent extraordinary Synod, held in Rome last November, Cardinal Ratzinger, a powerful German Thomist at the Curia, had been all set to demote the Ecumenical Office at the Vatican. It is worth keeping in mind that Ratzinger never has hidden his admiration for the pre-war Bavarian Church in which he grew up -that same Church which enjoyed cozy relations with the Nazi state. This is hardly the man to be making decisions in a sensitive area like ecumenical relations. 
"Plus ca change, plus ca meme chose." In his book "The American Pope: The Life and Times of Francis, Cardinal Spellman," John Cooney reports that Spellman said of John XXIII, "He's no pope; he should be selling bananas," adding, "No change will get past the Statue of Liberty." Spellman is gone, but his most recent successor in New York, John Car­dinal O'Connor, of Ferraro-bashing fame, is out of the same stable; I doubt if his theology differs one iota from Spellman's. 
The Holy Spirit must have worn herselfout trying to get a change of heart among top people in the Church -John XXIII was her last gasp in that direction. Maybe She now is trying to zap those ofus who are at the bottom ofthe ecclesial pyramid. Itwould be a sensible move on Her part because people who do not hold office; in the Church are much, much freer to critique the deformities of the institution. They are unlikely to be hauled in front of Roman Inquisitions to account for their views. 
Which brings me back to my octogenarian friend, the owner of the cursed book. She has lived through some of the worst times in the history of the modern Church, yet her fidelity to Christ had given her the independence to resist institutional insanity while remaining faithful to the Body of Christ. She never has made an idol of the Church and she is no Sun­day Catholic, either. 
On the contrary, she preaches the Gospel unsanctimoniously and unself-righteously every day ofher life. A third order Benedictine for many years, her simple, cultivated life leaves her wonderfully free to serve her neighbors and to bring Christ to her world.

Network television bas little to offer viewers 
There are two varieties ofevery college stu­dent's Christmas experience: heavy food con­sumption and bad television. During this festive vacation, we have both the time and lack of energy to melt into the couch, drink a bottle of Coke (not diet), indulge in the chip and dip, and absorb oneself into the alluring world ofbad television. 
john C. Dettling 
outofline 
While once a "Brady Bunch" regular, I now have trouble stomaching most of what net­works offer. But it happens again, time after time, vacation after vaction. Weary of the barrage ofcable movies, intellectually drained from school and PBS, I am seduced by bad television. Simply, I indulge in prime-time net­work inanity. 
Most shows reek ofinanity. While there are few good ones, the list ofthe inane is endlessly awful. Reeking of bad taste, bad acting, bad writing and appalling distortions of reality, this entertainment cesspool magnetically lures more people into wasting their time since "Bad Film" with Ronald Reagan. 
From the allure of "Dynasty" (where the rich are miserable and the poor have been ex­pelled from Denver) and ridiculous sitcoms, we learn about ourselves and our society. But I am convinced that the TV commercial can tell us much more about the politics and predilections of our society. 
Once, after hearing a lecture on the ex­ploitation of women in advertising, I became acutely aware of the actual severity of this problem, the ignoble instincts that many ad­vertisers cater to, and the grand seduction that transpires every time the tube sucks us into its world. Who's really in control when images flutter across the screen? 
Is it the materialistic values that commer­cials flaunt so powerfully that they are in­tegrated into our psyche? How vulnerable are children to the distortions and inanity that television in general portrays? How has TV weakened our attention spans and engen­dered irrevocable damage to the written word? Are we, as Dick Postman conjectures, "amusing ourselves to death?" 
We see beer commercials following anti­drunk driving ads. And on the somewhat lighter but inane side, we learn, to our utter amazement, that people of all ages clap their hands in a mad frenzy when they order at McDonalds. (I contracted food poisoning the last time I ate there. What should I do next time I order?) And ofcourse, we've been sub­jected to so much sexual imagery that many of us probably have become numb to its stagger­ing prevalence in TV advertising. 
At a close glance, we might learn two relatively new trends from TV advertising. First, fragmentation has become the rule in commercials. In fact, even programs have sue­cumbed to this tendency. Measure how long one angle shot is maintained. Probably not more than a few seconds. In commercials, we frequently are bombarded with as many images as the time spot can hold. Beer and automobile commercials try to compress a rapid plethora of appealing images, most ir­relevant to the product. 
The flashing of suggestive images isn't as disconcerting as the actual manner in which they are presented. If this trend continues ( MTV is the greatest program offender), how much will the attention span of the next generation be debilitated? People are watch­ing TV much more than ever. Are we becom­ing conditioned to constantly expect another image rather than reflect on one or a few images? The chronic TV watcher will expect life to move in the same pattern as the images presented to him: fastpaced, little attention to detail, and fragmentary. 
Patriotic imagery saturates TV commer­cials. The pride is back. In what? Most ads are catering to a nationalistic fervor latent in all us, a nebulous, superficial pride that glosses over the substantial and profound under­standing of our way of life that we should possess. Much of it is hot air. Again, there are preposterous associations: Has your town been annihilated by a tornado? No problem. Just get your Miller beer and build the thing together again. 
Ifa war is in the waiting, we're certainly get­ting mentally prepared. War is selling a lot of nice things. Hilton uses jet fighters to convey its message. One firm shows a tank and a cal­vary about to engage in battle. More impor­tantly, the use of sheer power is a prevalent theme that merely reflects a society enamoured with power, force and war. 

And then there's the Wendy's ad. Yes, the Russian fashion show. It portrays Russians as fat monotonous automatons. Critics believe that it hinders Americans from empathizing with the millions of Russians condemmed to live under its government, that it gives us another reason to hate them, and that it bloats our nationalism. 
A closer look reveals that it is mocking the Soviet system. Of course, Russian women want a choice -if they had one. The ad is damaging because many will disdainfully mock the Russian characters while few will reflect on the Soviet system. 
The Politburo isn't too happy with our general portrayal of Russians in our entertain­ment genres. These are the same people who say the Boy Scouts are card-carrying capitalists who are taught the finer points of free-market theory and military machinations. 
While watching bad television one night with my little brother, he told me about a visit to his school by a Boy Scout leader. "The leader said that we'd learn how to fire a rifle, an automatic, and other army stuff," the sixth­grader gleefully recounted. 
Alot has changed since "The Brady Bunch."

The legacy of Dooley is remembered by few today 
This week macks the 25th anniversary of the death of Dr. Thomas Dooley. Dooley was known throughout the wocld and especially in the jungles ofSoutheast Asia in the 1950s as one who treated those preventable diseases that otherwise meant death to the rural population living fn the area. He was an out· spoken man, impatient with those who did not understand his call to help thelc brothers "halfway around the wocld." 
Larry Skendzel guest column 
Many found his manner egotistical and his anti-Communist rhetoric distasteful. Dooley did capture the imagination of the American ' people in his call for aid to those who "ain't got it so good." He helped raise millions of dollars for medicine and personnel toward his cause. 
Yet the legacy Dooley left the wocld often ha..ti been forgotten since his death at age 34 of cancer. His letter to Father Hesburgh is posted at the Grotto, but few Notre Dame students know of Dooley's life. In an effort to reverse this trend, the University has erected a bronze statue next to the Grotto to commemorate the life of one of Notre Dame's finest in­dividuals. 
The Tom Dooley story began in St. Louis, Missouri, on Jan. 17, 1927, with his birth. He quickly grew into a handsome young man, popular with the gicls and endowed with an energetic personality. He chose to attend Notre Dame and began his pre-medical train· ing there in 194 3. With the outbreak ofWocld War II, Dooley enlisted as a corpsman in­volved as a medical aide. 
In 1946 he returned to Notre Dame, where he continued to impress people with his ener· getic personality. He rode horses well, played the piano expertly and jitterbugged like a professional. He bragged about becoming a "society doctor" back in St. Louis. Dooley finished his pre-medical course of study as a junior and was accepted into the St. Louis·Uni­versity School of Medicine. Dooley was known for his nonconformity to schedules in medical school and often skipped class if a more pressing matter came up at the hospital. Ue wa.~ reprimanded often for this, but managed to graduate in 1953. 
Dooley joined the Navy and spent several months on the West Coast for his internship before being sent aboard the U.S.S. Montague stationed in Japan. In May 1954, there began for young Dooley an experience which was to change the whole course of his life. The Mon­tague was one offour ships assigned to help in "Passage to Freedom," an evacuation of those who wished to flee Communist-held North Vietnam after the French Indo-China War. Dooley was in charge of processing the refugees before they were evacuated, to prevent epidemics and the infestation of the ships used for transport. 
More than 600,000 refugees were processed and cared for. Dooley came to wit· ness firsthand the degree of preventable disease festering in this undernourished, suf­fering society. He rose to the challenge. As a result of his extraordinary effort in this opera­tion, he was awarded the Legion of Merit, be· coming the youngest officer in the history of the U.S. Medical Corps to receive it. 
Dooley left Southeast Asia to return to the United States, convinced ofthe need for aid to this segment of humanity. In 1956 he became a civilian and wrote a book, "Deliver Us From Evil," describing his experiences with those suffering not only from deplorable physical conditions, but also from the yoke of Com­munism. With the proceeds from the book, plus generous help from pharmaceutical com· panics, he returned to Southeast Asia with a 
small staff and obtained permission from the 
Laotian government to establish a small 
village hospital. It was located at Nam Tha, five 
miles from the border of Communist-held 
China. 
At Nam Tha, Dooley ministered to the needs of the people in an educational as well as medical capacity. He set up the hospital only on the condition that it be taken over by a Laotian staff in the future. Dooley was con­vinced that the negative propaganda used by the Communists about Americans was best fought by example. 
He lived with the people, knew their lan­guage and participated in their community, in hope that this exhibition of caring would become a symbol ofAmerica and its commit· ment to freedom and world peace. In late 195 7, Dooley turned the hospital over to the Laos government and returned to the United States. 
Dooley's second best seller, "The Edge of Tomorrow" was published in May 1958. Proceeds from this and a lecture tour helped finance his plans for an overseas operation called MEDICO, committed to aid of under· developed areas. He returned to Laos to es­tablish another hospital in the remote village of Muong Sing. By the end of 1960, MEDICO had 1 7 projects in operation in 12 countries. MEDICO established such projects only at the invitation of the host government. 
In August 1959, Dooley learned he had a highly malignant cancer (melanoma) and flew to New York to undergo surgery. The opera­tion was filmed by CBS for a three-hour documentary narrated by Howard K. Smith on current techniques for the treatment of can­cer. After a few weeks of rest, Dooley started on a nation-wide lecture tour which raised nearly a million dollars for MEDICO. 
People marvelled at his energetic plea that each American could make a difference in the life of some stranger, but still a brother, in Asia. He then returned to his Muong Sing hospital and began working at his usual pace, which often kept him going 20 hours a day. 
In early 1960, Dooley's thicd book, "The 
Night They Burned the Mountain," was 
published. It told of his fight with cancer and 
the constant threat of Communist invasion 
that hung over the region. Despite personal 
danger, Dooley refused to evacuate the area 
insisting, "I am a doctor, that is the root ofme. 
Everything else is second to that." 
He received many tributes for his inspira­tional work. One came from President Dwight Eisenhower when both received honorary degrees from Notre Dame on June 5, 1960. Departing from his prepared text as com­mencement speaker, the President said, "There are few, if any, men who have equalled Dr. Dooley's exhibition of courage, self· sacrifices, faith in his God and his readiness to serve his fellow man." 
Others continued to criticize Dooley's work. Many questioned his medical tech· niques and others complained ofhis rudeness. Volunteers often felt the brunt of his Irish temper if things were not done his way. He readily admitted to being somewhat of a tyrant at the hospital. Others disliked his con­stant use ofthe mass media to obtain contribu­tions. 
Dooley insisted that this was not self-aggrandizement. "If you are going to be a humanitarian today, you've got to run it like a business offail as a service. You've got to have press relations, television, and radio." Many remember him best for his witty remarks on "The Tonight Show" or on Arthur Godfrey's program. 
As 1960 progressed, Dooley began to feel increasing pain in his lower abdominal region. He continued to work his usual schedule, but on Nov. 30 entered a Hong Kong hospital suf· feeing from "extreme fatigue and exhaustion." He left the hospital in a few days wearing a 
brace to support his back and attempted to 
resume his work. 
The pain, however, became progressively worse, and he finally gave in to the persuasion ofassociates and journeyed back to New York for a new examination. He arrived on Dec. 27, 1960, and entered Memorial Hospital, where he spent his last days attempting to organize his foundation MEDICO to survive after his death. 
On his bicthday, Cardinal Spellman adminis· tered the last rites and one day later, on Jan. 18, 1961, Dooley died quietly. The world mourned its loss. Congress approved the Presidential Award which was given pos· thumously, and the king ofLaos presented the Order of a Million Elephants and White Parasol, his nation's highest honor, to Dooley's mother at the funecal. 
In the New York Times, Norman Cousins wrote, "On a non-medical basis, Dooley had the book thrown at him becauSe of his per­sonal manner. They said he was a little too flamboyant and was not above self­advertising. What is Important about Tom Dooley is that he tried to meet the highest need ofhis age, which is for a sense ofconnec· tion between man and man. Even if Dooley's mission in Asia was a total failure, which it was not, he would have valid claim to greatness because he rescued thousands from cynicism. He could have been the world's most temper· mental man and this would not have detracted by the thinnest sliver from the magnificence ofhis ideas and his work." 
Dooley doled out his life for humanity · to men and women with whom he had no direct relationship · but he fought for them just the same. Many found things to criticize. So be lt. There Is also much to praise... and that Is why we at Notre Dame come together this week, to remember this man and his life. 
We should not judge on unfounded hearsay 
Recently, I was jolted from what I call an intellectual or "all-too-knowing" pedestal. After participating in an Urban Plunge this past break, I have found many beliefs I had held as basically unshakeable now are stand­ing on very shaky ground. 
Carol Brown 
in these times 
I always had held a very conservative view concerning American poverty · a view based on heresay, the news, my environment, school · in other words, a view based on not· bing but indirect sources. Prior to the Plunge, I never had had any real contact with poverty. Consequently, now, after the Plunge, and after experiencing this problem in a more real and direct way, I find myself re-evaluating many of my beliefs. More importantly, I am re­examining these issues from a more educated and enlightened perspective; a perspective which rests on some real experience, not merely my own intellectual speculations. 
Here is the point. Having been knocked-off ofmy "all-too-knowing" pedestal, I have come to understand the great injustice we do In for· ming our opinions from unsubstantiated su· perficialities and what often amounts to heresay. 
The key is direct experience with a situa­tion and a sincere attempt at understanding before we form any judgments. 
This idea is not only relevant when talking of major life issues, but also in the judgments we make in our daily experience. We can all think of first impressions that went wrong, that interview when we totally froze-up and lost all human speaking capabilities, that first date with that god-like life form when we regressed into being social dwebulites for the night ... and the list goes on. It is pretty ob­vious that none of us would like opinions formed of us based on these awkward situa­tions; situations which are totally (or at least hopefully) off-base with the great people we really are. 
Unfortunately, because ofhuman nature we all probably have been misjudged in some way or another based on nothing more than superficial misunderstandings. And it is falc to say we have all at some time mistakenly made rash judgments based on the same type of nonsense. 
The cost of such quick, narrow-minded judgments often is much higher than we

would like to think. It could cost the loss of a 
job, entrance Into a university, or even a 
friendship. As an example, I clearly remember 
a time at the onset of my freshmen year · a 
prime time for first impressions · when be· 
cause of my possibly overly-gregarious and 
outgoing disposition I was written off by 
someone, who Is now a great friend, as a boy­
crazy socialite. In reality, I was just a scared 
little freshman looking for friends like 
everyone else. Case In point. 
In my honest intention of meeting people 
and making friends, I was mistakenly judged 
to be someone all too unlike myself. In the 
same way, because of my friend's reaction to 
me I, in turn, judged her as being cold and 
unfriendly. Needless to say, within a couple of 
weeks as we got to know each other better, 
our first bad impressions dissolved and we 
became the friends we are today. 
Certainly, this is a very common and not too 
significant son ofsituation, but hopefully it iJ. 
lustrates a point of how we can easily fall Into 
this rash, unjustified sort of judgment. If we 
recognize this, perhaps we will become more 
aware of how we relate to others, and we will 
attempt understanding before judgment. 
We must be particularly careful in forming 
judgments about those who have made 
mistakes. We all share at least one thing in 
common, our humanness. And an innate and 
unavoidable quality ofour humanity is our fal· 
libility. We have all made mistakes. We all 
have regrets about things we wish we had not 
done · things which are out of sync with our 
character. These are things on which we 
would not like to be judged. 
So before judging others from our self· righteous thrones we must first humble our­selves to remember our own weaknesses. We must ask ourselves: Do we wish to be judged in the same way we judge others? Do we offer others Christian understanding and accep­tance or rather cold stares and petty gossip? 
Think about it. 
We must give people a chance. We must grant others the benefit ofthe doubt and make a sincere effort to search out all that is good in them, rather than base their worth on petty faults. If we do this we will experience the genuine goodness of people. If not, we arc no better off than the old biddy school teacher (oops · I really shouldn't judge) who told our parents that we were "unruly and disruptive" when all we really wanted was some atten· tion.

The Snite Museum -5 years of culture at ND 

features writer 
S 
o you think the pinnacle ofart on 
the Notre Dame campus is the 
renovation ofLafortune Student 
Center or your own "special" 
sculpture consisting ofseveral 
dozen beer cans and some Silly 
Putty? Well, those things just may 
hold some importance tbr selected 
Domers, but when it comes to true 
art, the Snite Museum ofArt can't 
be beaten. 
One ofthe top college museums 
in existence, the Snite is celebrating 
its fifth anniversary under the dis­
criminating eyes ofMuseum Direc­
tor Dean A. Porter. Over the years, 
Porter and his staffof 12 full-time 
employees have operated the 
museum to pedorm two functions ­as a museum for the student body and for the local community. 
As a museum for the student body, the Snite offers curriculum­structured tours and flexible visit­ing hours. The sophomore core courses are all being introduced to the museum through structured tours, and any tour can be arranged to fit an instructor's specific needs. For the Michiana community, the Snite presents a cultural escape by offering concerts, films, and lectures, all ofwhich also are available to students at reduced rates or for free. 
The Snite's briefhistory began with the ground-breaking ceremony on Dec. 3, 1976 and the official opening on Nov. 7, 1980. As for its background, the museum's namesake is Frederick B. Snite, a successful entrepreneur and Notre Dame supporter. Nicknamed "the Colonel;" Snite donated J2 million and 41 Old Master paintings to the art gallery. 
Although "the Colonel" never saw the completion ofthe museum, the Snite family association con­tinues in two ways. His sister, Mary Loretto Dillon, is a member of the advisory council tbr the museum, and the beautiful "Madonna and Child," on display in the atrium, is dedicated to Snite's son, who lived in an iron lung for 18 years ofhis life. In a sense, the Snite Museum is a memorial commemorating the generosity ofthe Snite family. 
There are 15 galleries in the Snite, each one offering a different type ofart. The main specialties of the museum include nineteenth century and ethnographic art, the concentrations ofcurators Stephen Spiro and Douglas Bradley, respectively. Famous works in the museum include etchings by Rembrandt, Picasso, Remington and 
C.M. Russell. 
Because the acquisition fund for the museum is very small, most of the artwork in the Snite has been acquired through donations from philanthropic collectors. Artists-in­residence at the University have also made generous contributions to the gallery holdings. For ex­ample, Ivan Mestrovic resided at Notre Dame from 1955-62, and his works are on display in the gallery bearing his name. One of Mestrovic's religious works, "Christ and the Samaritan Woman," was cast in bronze and displayed at the Vatican Pavilion exhibit at the World's Fair in New Orleans. The original piece is on display outside O'Shaughnessy Hall. 
The success ofa museum sometimes can be measured in terms ofits attendance. In this respect, the Snite has consistently finished with high marks. Recently, overall attendance at the museum ranked sixth out ofall reporting college museums in the nation. The Snite fell short of the Harvard and Yale museums, thought by some to be the best college galleries in the country, but the attendance figures look promising, considering the relative youth of the Snite. 
To celebrate its fifth anniversary, the Snite is displaying a recent donation of70 Rembrandt etchings,

So when you get bored ofyour beer can sculpture or looking at LaFortune's ugly skeleton, take a walk over to the Snite and take in some truly fine culture. In the words of Porter, "Just as every great city needs a museum, a great uni­versity also needs a museum." The Suite Museum of Art is Notre Dame's great museum.

t's not often that one can go see a 
play and, at the same time:, donate 
money to help African famine relief, 
but In this age of Uve Aid and "We 
Are the World," anything is pos­
sible.

Mass Appeal_;.--~ 
"Mass Appeal," which played Friday and Saturday nights in Was­hington Hall, was produced by Actors for Africa, Inc., a non-profit group which Is raising funds to feed the hungry In Africa. All proceeds from the: play go to the Benedictine Missions in Africa. Costumes, microphones and other necessities were: donated by Indiana businesses. Through special ar­rangement with the: publisher and Bill C. Davis, the playwright, Actors for Africa, Inc., Is able to produce the: play free ofcharge. 
The play deals with the relation­ship between Mark Dolson, a young, idealistic seminarian, and his advisor, Father Tim Farley, an aging parish priest who appears com­fortable In the subservient role he ha!j fashioned for himself within his afDuent parish. Naturally, the two clash right from their first encounter. 
Farley defends the way he caters to his pompous parishoners, saying, "Well, I like being liked. It gives me a warm feeling inside. You know, that and wine are the only warm feelings I get. And I'm not about to give up either." Farley also dislikes Dolson's "kick-ass" sermons, but the brash Dolson counters, "Better that than to kiss it." The two seem headed for collision, but the unjust decrees of a mutual opponent, Monsignor Burke, unite: them. 
A two-man show can have problems maintaining interest, but this production manages to pull it off. The play opens with Farley, played by Jim Shildmyer, giving a dialogue sermon to the audience, which serves as his congregation. Dolson, played by Harvey Fries, enters from the rear ofthe theatre, answering Farley's call for ideas. The audience becomes part of the production, not merely silent ob­servers. Telephone conversations also increase: the number ofcharac­ters in the play, and keep the audience's interest high. 
· The play was directed by Mike Shildmyer, who also counts "The Front Page" and "Deathtrap" among his directing credits. Performing the play for charity was his brainchild. He was responsible for casting his father, who has had leading roles in Marion Civic Theatre productions, as Farley. Fries just happened to be in town at the time, visiting from New York, where he did "performance art" in various East Village nightclubs. 
The group has also performed at Ball State: University, Indiana Uni­versity and in some church base­ments. As for the group's aspirations, it simply hopes that live theater can do its part to assist famine relief efforts, as the music industry has done. That kind of attitude is worthy of"mass" atten­tion. 
Childhood friendship ends with a simple diamond ring 
Dave Dvorak 
Out of the lunchbox­
W 
hile I was home for Christmas break, I ran into my old childhood friend, Pete. Pete and I were the best ofbuddlc:s In high school. We played running bases, traded base:ball cards, threw snowballs at cars, climbed trees, and lit firecrackers together. 
But our futures took us down different paths. We attended different high schools and saw each other only occasionally during those: four years. 
Then Pete went away to Illinois State University; I came to Notre Dame. Now that we're both college seniors, it's pretty clear that we've drifted apart. 
In fact, when I ran into Pete outside my house over break, it was the first time we had seen each other in more than a year. It was good to see him. We were able to catch up on lots of news about college and old friends. 
We just stood there in the snow, talking, laughing, reminiscing. 
In a weird way, it was as if nothing had ever changed. Then a terrific idea entered my head. "Hey Pete," I said. "Remember, when we were kids, how we 
used to go tobogganing at Beamis Woods?" "Yeah, sure," he said. "Those: were some great times. Why do you ask?" "Well, I was thinking. Why don't I pull the old toboggan out of the garage and we'll hit Beamis Woods? Sort oflike old times!" "I'd love to," Pete replied, "but I've already got plans to see Debbie. You remember her, don't you?" "Yeah, sure, I remember Debbie," I said. "You two are still seeing each other?" "You might say that," Pete said. "As a matter offact, we're engaged." 
"Well, tell her you have to go tobogganing and that ... "I stopped, stunned, as if somebody had just clubbed me over the head. "You're what?" 
"That's right," Pete said. "We'll be getting married in july. In the meantime, though, I've got a thousand things to do-wedding invitations, the marriage license:, tuxedo fittings ...." 
I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This is the guy I used to race Hot Wheels and watch "Spiderman" with. In those: days, words like "wedding" and "marriage license:" were never even part ofour working vocabularies. The only tuxedo we knew ofwas worn in a cartoon by a penguin nanttd Tennessee. 

Pete noticed that I was shocked, pale, paralyzed. "Hey, you're looking at me like I've: got leprosy or something," he said. "What's the problem?" "Oh ... nothing," I said. "It's just that ... I never pictured you getting married ... so soon." 
"Look, I'm 21. My parents were married and had two kids by this age. Besides, Debbie and I have been going out for four years now. We're sure this is what we want." 
"Well, congratulations," I said as I shook Pete's hand, though I'm not sure I really meant it. I felt more like consoling him. 
"You're still looking at me funny," Pete said. "What's the matter? Doesn't anybody get engaged back at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's? I can't believe the social life is that bad." "Well, sure, people are always getting engaged at school," I said. "I know ofquite a few couples who have cuddled their way through the last few years of college and who are now getting a piece of the: rock." 
"See what I mean?" Pete said. "It's not so unusual. And I bet there'll be plenty more engagements there before the year is up." 
"Yeah, I'd imagine so," I said. "I've heard that during Senior Formal weekend in April, diamond rings fly through the air like Frisbees." 
"Isn't it kind of exciting?" Pete asked. 
"I don't know," I said. "I guess it's pretty neat when you walk into English class one day and a bunch ofgirls are crowded around their newly engaged friend, oohing and ahhing at the stone on her finger .... 
"But then I get depressed when I think about the poor guy who's probably abstaining from Domino's pizzas and who didn't get basketball tickets this year so he could afford the thing." 
"I think you're missing the whole point," Pete sighed. "A diamond ring is a beautiful and meaningful symbol ofa man's love for a woman." 
"It's also the smallest handcuff In the: world," I reminded him. Pete sighed again. I think he was beginning to get annoyed. 
"Hey listen," he said at last, "I've gotta run; Debbie and I are looking at apartments this afternoon. Thanks for the tobogganing offer. Maybe some other time." 
As I stood there in the snow and watched Pete walk away, I knew there would be no "other time." I realized that our childhood days were officially a thing of the past. Now there would be only memories. 
I guess I'm happy for Pete, as long as he's happy. I realize that engagements and marriages are special events that come to different people at different times. 
But does anybody out there still want to go tobogganing?

Gophers b-ball fate still unclear 
MINNEAPOUS · The fate of the 
University of Minnesota basketball 
program remained uncertain yester­
day as the Gophers forfeited their 
scheduled Big Ten game with 
Northwestern in the wake of the ar· 
rests of three players on allegations 
ofsexual assault and the resignation 
ofCoachJim Dutcher. 
Dutcher resigned Saturday, the day after Minnesota forwards Mitchell Lee, Kevin Andre Smith and George Williams were arrested in Madison, Wis., following an alleged sexual assault on a woman at a motel where the team was staying. 
"I think the program needs new direction," Dutcher, 52, the Gop­hers' head coach since 1975, told a news conference. 
"You can always look at where you are and where you want to be, and where you're heading and I'm not pleased with the direction we're heading," said Dutcher, who guided the Gophers to the Big Ten cham­pionship in 1982. 
"I was convinced for my own mental health at this point, this was the thing that had to be done," said Dutcher, who will be retained in another capacity in the university athletic department at least until the end ofthe school year. 
However, Dutcher told the St. Paul Pioneer Press and Dispatch that he will not abandon the three players who are to be arraigned Monday in Dane County Circuit Court in Madison. 
"Those are my players, men I brought to Minnesota from hundreds of miles away. They are away from their lilmilies. Maybe I can't monitor their every move but I can still be there when they need me," Dutcher said. 
He said he planned to be in Madison for the arraignment and will stay as long as he is needed.

Pro wrestling comes back to ACC; Santana defeats the Macho Man 

By MIKE CARDINALE 
Sports Writer 
Leaping Lanny Poffo, poet laureate of the World Wrestling Federation, set the tone for Saturday night's card at the ACC by reading a poem in which he accurately described the focal point ofthe main event before his match with Rene Goulet. 
"Tonight the Macho Man Randy Savage goes after Santana's belt, but Elizabeth's such a hot number, I'm afraid the gold will melt," recited Poffo. 
Elizabeth, Savage's stunningly beautiful manager, certainly upstaged the Macho Man's perfor­mance, as the more experienced Tito Santana handily defeated Savage to retain his Intercontinental Heavyweight Belt. 
Elizabeth's entrance roused the biggest cheer of the evening, as she appeared dressed in a sequined red tank top and blue miniskirt. Savage entered clad in an impressive black, red and gold cape, but was met with a chorus ofboos. 
Santana had the upper hand early in the match, and Savage quickly ducked out of the ring to escape the champion's onslaught. When San­tana pursued him outside ofthe ring, the Macho Man resorted to hiding behind Elizabeth for protection. 
Savage could not stay out of the ring forever, however, and when he returned, Santana went to work on his head with a series of elbow smashes and a devastating dropkick. Savage seemed to tum things around with a desperation eye poke, but after surviving a couple of pin at­tempts, Santana put him away with a vicious clothesline. The pin came at the 11:5 3 mark ofthe match. 
The most exciting match of the evening was a renewal of the fierce rivalry between "the Dragon," Ricky Steamboat, and "the Magnificent" Don Muraco. The 267-pound Muraco, a native of Sunset Beach, Hawaii, was accompanied by his manager Mr. Fuji. Steamboat, a mar­tial arts champion and an incredibly agile wrestler at 238 pounds, en­tered the arena to the music of "2001: A Space Odyssey." 
The early minutes of the match proved to be a struggle between the two wrestlers for possession of Steamboat's black belt. Steamboat used it first to strangle Muraco, but then the Magnificent One wrested 
Hal Sutton captures Phoenix Open tournament title; Sills, Peete fail to rally , finish two shots back in 2nd 
PHOENIX, Ariz. -Hal Sutton, un­der pressure from Tony Sills, played a courageous shot over the comer of a lake on the 18th green that nailed . down the title in the Phoenix Open GolfToumament yesterday. 
Sutton, the leader all the way this hot, sunny day, needed only a round of par 71 as Sills and Calvin Peete were unable to sustain a challenge in the occasionally gusty winds. 
Sutton, a former PGA titleholder, gained this sixth victory of his five­year PGA tour career with a 267 to­tal, I 7 shots under par on the Phoenix Country Club course. 
The victory was worth $90,000 from the total purse of $500,000 and pushed his earnings for three tournaments this season to $137,967. 
Sills, 30, not yet a winner in three full seasons as a touring pro, recorded his career-high finish with a 68 that tied him for second with Peete, the defending titleholder here and a runaway winner two weeks ago in the Tournament of Champions. 
They were at 269, I 5 under par ­one better than Peete's winning to­tal last year -and two shots back. Each won $44,000. 
Peete also had a 3-under-par 68 despite an erratic putter. 
"I had a chance to put some heat on him but I just couldn't keep the putter hot. I missed short birdie putts on the 12th and 15th and that just about did it," Peete said. 
Dan Forsman, who scored an eagle-3 on the final hole, was next at 66-270 but never really got in the title chase. 
He was followed by Don Pooley and Australian Greg Norman, tied at 
271. Norman had a closing 70, 
Pooley69. 
No one else really was in it. 
Sutton, now the winner of three official events and a team title in the last six months, had a two-stroke lead over Sills going to the par-5 18th. 
But Sills put the pressure on him when he ran a long-iron shot over the sun-baked fairway, onto the green and to within six feet of the flag: He had that putt for eagle-3. 
Sutton, in the fairway, never hesitated. Playing it safe, laying it up, he said, never entered his mind. 
He, too, took an iron, a 2-iron from 246 yards, started it out over the comer ofthe lake. 
"I played it toward the left bunker and it went there like an arrow," Sut­ton sald. It kicked off the grass of a mound facing the bunker, kicked onto the green and ran through to the fringe, some 15 feet away. 
That did it.

yards were the fewest in a Super Bowl since the Oakland Raiders allowed Minnesota 119 in 1977. 
So Chicago won the NFL title with 18 victories in 19 games, including three playoff victories in which they beat the New York Giants, Los An· geles Rams and the Patriots by an ag· gregate of 101-10. 
The Miami Dolphins won the Super Bowl in 1973 to cap an un· beaten season. But perhaps no other team · not the four-time Super Bowl· champion Pittsburgh Steelers, not the Green Bay Packers, not the 18·1 San Francisco 49ers last year -ever had such a dominant season as this year's Bears. 
Excluding their only loss, a 38·24 decision in Miami, the Bears won eight games against teams with records of 1 0-6 or better by a total of 245-40. 
About New England's only con· solation was that it became the first team to score on Chicago in the playoffs, on Tony Franklin's 36-yard field goal following a fumble

just about everything else went right for the Bears. They even got points on what the league admitted was a mistake by Red Cashion's of· ficiating crew, which allowed the Bears to kick a field goal after they were penalized at the end ofthe first half. An McNally, the NFL supervisor of officials, said the half should have been allowed to expire. 
New England's day lasted exactly one minute and 19 seconds. 
The 10 1/2-point underdog Patriots picked up where they'd left off in their three playoff victories on the road, when they forced 16 tur· novers. 
The 17th came on the second play of the game, when Garin Veris stopped Walter Payton in the back· field, shook the ball loose, and Larry McGrew recovered for New England at the Chicago 19. It was the third game in a row that the Pats had gotten a turnover no later than the second play. 
After Tony Eason threw three straight incomplete passes, Franklin kicked a 36-yard field goal, the first points scored against Chicago in the playoffs. Coming just 1:19 into the game, it was the earliest score ever in the Super Bowl. 
But that was it for New England. It took the Patriots more than two full quaners after that to get more yards than they had points. 
The Bears came back to tie on But· ler's 28-yard field goal 4:21 later. It was set up by a 43-yard pass from McMahon to Willie Gault, who beat Ronnie Lippett on the play. 
Chicago's swarming defense set up the next two scores, which came 
1:03 apan and gave the Bears a 13· 3 lead at the end of the period. So overpowering were the Bears that New England didn't run a play that gained yardage until Craig James ran for three yards on the final play of thequaner. 
First Hampton recovered a fumble forced when Perry, Dent and Steve McMichael swarmed Eason at the New England 13. That set up Butler's 24-yard field goal with 1:24 left in the period. 
The highlight of that possesion came when Perry entered the game with the ball on the five-yard Hne. He took a pitchout from McMahon, raised his arm in the air and was sacked for a one-yard loss, a punish­ment he's more used to administer· ing. 
On the first play after the kickoff, James was dumped and fumbled, and Mike Singletary recovered at the 
13. One play later, Suhey took a pitchout, cut back inside and went 11 yards for the game's first touch· down with 23 seconds left in the 
period. 
The next time, it was the· offense 
that did it, going 59 rards in 1 0 plays 
to make it 20· 3. 
McMahon got the touchdown on 
an option play, faking to Perry, then 
sliding into the end zone from two 
yards out as The Refrigerator 
obliterated McGrew and Tim 
Wrightman threw another key 
block. 
New England finally got a first 
down with four minutes left in the 
half after Steve Grogan replaced 
Eason at quanerback. On that series, 
Grogan also threw the Pats' first two 
completions after Eason had gone 
zero for six, been sacked three times 
and fumbled once. 
Chicago made it 23·3 at halftime 
on Butler's 24-yard field goal on the 
final play ofthe half after a drive that 
began at its own 20. The key play 
was a 29-yard completion from 
McMahon to Ken Margerum. 
But Butler never should have 
been allowed to kick. 
With the ball at the two, the clock 
ticking toward zero and the teams 
milling about, centerJay Hilgenberg 
snapped the ball and McMahon 
threw it out of bounds. A flag was 
thrown and illegal procedure called 
on the Bears; three seconds showed 
on the clock and Butler took the 
kick. 
McNally, however, said later that because the Bears had no time outs left, 1 0 seconds should have been run off the clock before the play. That would have ended the half wit­hout the kick. But since it had aJ. ready happened when the mistake was discovered, the score had to stand. 
If the game had been closer, it would have led to one ofthe biggest controversies in Super Bowl history. As it was, it mattered not at all. 
Chicago made it 30·3 on its first possession of the second half. 
Stuck on their own four by Rich Camarlllo's 62-yard punt, a Super Bowl record, they moved with a 60· yard pass from McMahon to Gault. McMahon capped the 96-yard, nine· play drive by diving over from the one for the score. 
One minute and six seconds later came another TD, this one on the in· terception by Phillips, who plucked a Grogan pass that bounced off New England tight end Derrick Ramsey and rambled 28 yards to make it 37· 3. 
Wilber Marshall's recovery of Cedric Jones' fumble set up the final ID, a one-yard run by Perry, a defensive starter who scored two touchdowns rushing and one receiv· ing during the regular season. 
Waechter, a reserve defensive tackle, sacked Grogan in the end zone with 5:36left in the game.

Bears devour Patriots in Super Bowl rout, 46-10 
McMahon scores twice in most lopsided game 
NEW ORLEANS -The Chicago Bears completed one of the most dominating NFL seasons ever with the most dominating Super Bowl, crushing New England 46-I 0 yesterday behind the clutch quarterbacking ofJim McMahon and an overpowering defense that turned the fatriots' offense into a retreat. 
McMahon, whose sore buttock and off-the-field antics dominated the week befOre the game, scored on two short runs and completed 12 of 20 attempts for 2 56 yards before leaving the game In the third quarter with a sprained left wrist. 
And William "The Refrigerator" Perry, the 300-pound lineman, ran for a touchdown after being sacked in his first pro passing attempt. 
The score might point to an offensive game, but it was the defense, with seven sacks and a safety, that brought the Bears their first NFL title since 1963. 
Led by ends Dan Hampton and Most Valuable Player Richard Dent, the "46" alignment that often puts eight men on the line of scrimmage limited New England to minus-19 yards in the first half, as the Bears moved to a 23-3 lead on three field goals by Kevin Butler and TD runs by McMahon and running back MattSuhey. 
The Patriots gained yardage on onlyone oftheir first 16 plays from scrimmage and failed to complete a pass for 25 minutes or get a first down for 26 as Chicago registered six sacks. 
In fact, New England didn't raise its net yardage total above zero until Chicago was far ahead. The Bears had opened it to 44-3 by the end of the third quarter on one-yard TD runs by McMahon and Perry and Reggie Phillips' 28-yard interception 
return. A safety by Henry Waechter, tackling Pats' quarterback Steve Grogan in the end zone as he tried to pass, capped the scoring. 
That was the major factor in Super Bowl records for most points and largest margin of victory. The Patriots' 123 total

Dent named game MVP, leads Bears' defense 
NEW ORLEANS-Richard Dent was one ofthe quiet members ofthe Chicago Bears football team through the week leading up to yesterday's Super Bowl. 
But he made the most of his opportunity to talk after being named the game's most valuable player. 
While linebacker Otis Wilson was predicting "goose eggs" for the New England Patriots, and quarterback Jim McMahon was occupying the headlines with everything from ac­cupuncture to mooning passing helicopters, Dent was relatively low key. 
On Sunday, he accepted the MVP trophy on behalf of a defense that held the Patriots to minus yardage for the first 30 minutes of play, did not allow any kind of gain on any play for the first quarter and didn't allow a first down until the final 2:40 ofthe first half. 
But Dent said the Bears' big day started off a little rocky. 
"On the first play, John Hannah (New England's perennial All-Pro guard) hit me pretty good· knocked me on my butt," Dent said "He let me know he was serious. 
"I had to retaliate. I've never been hit that hard in my life." 
The shutout that Wilson predicted and the rest of the team wanted disappeared less than two minutes into the game when New England converted a fumble Into a field goal. 
Still, Dent said, he knew after that score that Chicago had the game won. 
"We were hoping for a shutout, then with the offense giving them the ball, that went right down the drain," Dent said. "We didn't get the shutout, but we didn't give them any yards, and at that time we knew that we had them." 
Dent, who was outspoken about his unhappiness with his current contract with the Bears, refused to talk about that last night. 
"We'll just let that take care ofitself."

North Carolina, 21·0, did get plenty of scoring help from point guard Kenny Smith. Smith put in a game-high 20 points, 14 in the second half. The Irish also did agood job of breaking Carolina's trapping, or "scramble," defense. Notre Dame turned the ball over only 11 times in the game.

Physical inside play marks game 
ByJEFF BLUMB 
Sports Editor 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. · Following their 73·61 win over the Irish, North Carolina players and coaches would have had you believe that the Bears­Patriots matchup later in the day wasn't the only football game being played. 
"I didn't think the Super Bowl started until 5, but it was out there," said Tar Heels center Brad Daug­herty. "Notre Dame played hard, and they played physical." 
But Daugherty also suggested that the Irish would have had at least a few penalty tlaS" thrown their way had it been a football game. 
"They really were holding on to us," he said. "If they weren't grab­bing our jersey, they were hookinhg our arms. There is a way to play physical without doing that. 
"Usually there's one individual on a team who's the so-called hatchet man, but today everybody on their team was doing it." 
Arid North Carolina coach Dean Smith already had a plan for when his team visits the ACC next January for a return game. 
"We're going to take tear-away jerseys when we go to Notre Dame next year," he said, "so that when we are held, the jersey will tear away and we can break free." 
While he will have graduated, Carolina's Warren Martin thought Smith just might have the right idea. 
"Tear-away jerseys might be the answer," Martin said, "because every time you'd take a step past them, the Notre Dame players would hold you." 
Numerous blows were ex· changed between players on both sides. Martin was hit in the eye in one pileup and on at least two occa· sions, Carolina's Joe Wolf could be seen dishing out forearms on Jim Dolan ofthe Irish. Dolan also was hit in the face once on a player control foul by the Heels' Dave Popson. 
After one whistle in the first half, an official pulled aside Daugherty and Dolan. According to Daugherty, both players were told to calmdown their physical play or he would sit the two ofthem down. 
Coming in, the Irish knew Carolina was slightly bigger than them and that they would have their work cut out for them. 
"We knew we'd have to work hard. The whole week we con­centrated on defensing their big men inside because we knewwe had to do that to win," Irish center Tim Kempton said. " ·At any one time today, you'd have five or six big guys out there poundingon each other. It wasa clean, physical game, though." 
Daugherty, however, disagreed with Kempton's assessment. 
"I guess the refs were out to lunch," he said, "because there were so many things they didn't call. 
"I was diappointed with Notre Dame. I expected so much more from them. This was not the same team we played last year in the NCAA Tournament." 
No matter how much the Tar Heels complained about the physi­cal play of the Irish, Notre Dame did come out ahead in at least one way. The Irish outrebounded Carolina 24-23 to maintain the distinction of having outrebounded every op­ponent but one (American Univer­sity) this season.
