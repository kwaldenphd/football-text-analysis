The sun was setting like a flare across the Illinois 
River, as we fmally managed to start the campfire. We 
had ridden 90 miles that day and were exhausted . 
Gralfuation was two days away, and having com­
pleted our last set of finals, we had two days of freedom 
to tour downstate Illinois. As we sat around the 
campfire, burning Fritos and marshmellows, we talked 
about our fuur years together in high school and what 
the future held for us in college. At the time none of us · 
knew what we wanted to do with our lives or what 
careers we would pursue. 

It seemed our lives were just beginning; a vast void lay ahead of us, and it was we, not our guidance coun­selors or parents who would decide how to fill that void. As the fire burned down, we decided our first priority in life was to have fun -that was the bottom line. We were going to enjoy ourselves and do what we 
wanted. We felt we could conquer the world and could do anything ifwe worked hard enough. 
During high school, life was easy. We always had enough money, we never had to work too long or too hard, and school was just an inconvenience to endure until the end of the day when we went to practice ­the only reason we bothered to go to school. After school , we went home to talk on the phone , watch television and maybe, if we had time, do some homework.

the main criteria for choosing a career was to find a job we would enjoy as much on the day of our retirement as we did during our first year. 
Now our first questions about a career are: "What is the starting salary? What are the prospects for advance­ment?' ' These seem logical questions, but two years ago we did not consider them the most important factors. 
As high school students, we did not think quality of life should be dictated by position or salary. Rather, we thought happiness should arise from activity we enjoyed and at which we were good. We thought our jobs should be recreation, not hard labor. 
In the last two years, we have awakened to reality. We have discovered photography is not the path to ridtes, and that if you want the house on the top of the hill, coaching track may not be the ideal career choice. In the real world money talks, and it is a safe bet that if you want job security, a nice place to live and a month-long vacation every year, you will have to throw out the no-

Spring Break is still fresh in our minds and our tans have not surren­dered to the South Bend climate, but already plans for the next tropical as­sault have been made. 
The class of '86 senior trip has been in planning stages since janu­ary. For those who want to attend the October break escape to Nassau, the Bahamas, the time to register is now. 
The $150 non-refundable deposit must be submitted by April 12 to reserve places for the excursion. 
Total cost of the trip is $460, which includes round-trip airfare from O'Hare, plus a week's stay at the Sheraton British Colonial, a beachside resort in Nassau. Special arrangements have been made to return the seniors on the Friday night before break's end, in time for the USC game the following day.

juniors decide where they'd like to go," said junior Paul Kolano, one of four trip coordinators. Montreal; Cancun, Mexico; and Nassau were the locations under consideration. 
Approximately 500 juniors an­swered the survey, making Nassau the most popular destination by far. Explains Kolano,"In choosing a site, we were looking for a place that would provide both a change in climate and a good night life. Nassau had the best ofboth." 
Kolano said he expects approxi­mately 350 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students from the class of '86 will attend, but foresees potential problems because of the early deposit necessity. 
"The problem is that this is a ter­rible time to collect money from people,"said Kolano. "Everyone is either broke from spring break or will be by Easter, but when they have some extra cash this summer, they'll wish that theyhad signed up." 
The early deposit is necessary to secure some special advantages in

The symbol of the project will be the Quetzal bird which represents the forces ofgood against evil. 
This educational program will in­clude an inaugural lecture, four films, a panel discussion and two prayer services. 
Throughout the week, the 
Peacemakers' Issues Board will be 
located at various points around 
campus. This board will provide store for the sun worshippers. For example, First Source, the travel agency handling travel details, will have a tour representative in the Bahamas to plan events during the trip. Delta is also giving one free flight for every 25 tickets sold. 
"We will raffie off the free flights when students bring their deposits to the first-floor desk at LaFortune between April 9 and 12," said Kolano. This will save the winners approximately S250 off their vaca­tions. 
"Our biggest problem is momen­tum,"said Kolano. "Once word of mouth spreads, the trip's popularity will snowball." 
The coordinators have had in­formational meetings in every dorm, and have displayed posters as well as put out a newsletter to stir up inter­est. Kolano said he knows many people will be excited to go, but that it is vital to plan for the trip at the present time.

Court denies pregnancy lawsuit 
Allsodated Press 

ALBANY, N.Y. · A mother who became pregant after undergoing a sterilization procedure cannot sue the doctors and hospitals for the costs of raising her daughter, New York's top court ruled today. 
"In view ofour society's acknowl­edgment ofthe sanctity oflife, it can· not be said as a matter of public policy that the birth of a healthy chlld constitutes harm cognizable at law," wroteJudge MatthewJasen for the state Court ofAppeals majority. 
The 6-0 ruling narrowed the kind of damages Brian and Susanne O'Toole may seek in their suit against doctors Benjamin Green­berg and Arthur Leber as well as the Jamaica Hospital and Family Practice Center. 
No trial has been held yet to deter­mine whether the doctors and the hospital were negligent. If the couple can prove negligence was in· volved, the couple may seek dama­ges for expenses incurred for the pregnancy, delivery and other medi­cal expenses. 
At the center of the controversy is the accidental conception of the O'Tooles' daughter, KellyAnne 
Grain dealers feel farming pinch 
Allsodated Press 
GARY, Ind. · Grain elevators, many of which sell seed grain, chemicals and fertilizers to farmers and then buy their crops of corn, soybeans and wheat, have felt the pinch ofa weakened farm economy, an agriculture agent says. 
"They're facing the same credit 

problems that farmers are," said 
Harold Eubanks, Lake County agent 
of the Purdue University Co­
operative Extension Service. 
In northwest Indiana, at least 

three grain dealers have filed for 
protection in recent months from 
creditors under federal bankruptcy 
laws, the Gary Post-Tribune re­
ported. 
"If the farmer is suffering, the elevator is not going to be in clover," said Don Harrell, manager of the Farm Bureau Co-op in Crown Point. 
The filings have left dozens of creditors, including many farmers, to wait for approval of plans to reor· ganize the grain businesses and free thousands of dollars in cash and grain assets frozen by the courts. 
Ed Hein of rural Lake County said he was issued a S41,000 check in January for I '5,000 bushels of corn brokered through Ag-Consultants Grain Division Inc. of Lowell. The check bounced after he had written about 2'5 of his own checks against the deposit, Hein said.

or products not received by tne gov· 
ernment, nor for excessive pricing," 
he said. "Rather, the matter involves 
complex contractual and account· 
ing procedures. GE has fully 
cooperated with the government 
during its four-year investigation." 
"It's entirely possible that during 

the course of performing these 
multimillion-dollar contracts, charg­
Ing errors did occur," Vaber said. 
"However, there was no criminal 
wrongdoing on the part of the com­
pany or its employees." 
A Pentagon official, who spoke on 

condition of anonymity, said an in­
dictment of GE "will almost 
as.o;uredly be the largest defense con­
tractor ever charged on criminal 
counts." 
The GE work was performed at the company's Re-entry Systems Op­eration division here, since merged into GE's Space Systems division, which employs more than 6,500 people In Valley Forge and Philadel­pbla, said John Terino, product in­formation manager forGE. 
If convicted, GE also could face debarment proceedin~ aimed at all or part of Its Pentagon contracts. The company and its subsidiaries received more than S4.5 billion in military contracts in fiscal 1983, fourth among defense contractors, according to the most recent statis­tics available from the Pentagon. 
General Electric's 1983 contracts included supplies such as washing machines and light bulbs, as well as nuclear-missile warheads and engines for the B·1 bomber and the F-14, F-15 and F-16 fighter planes. 
Early this year Brett Ellis of Lowell, the owner ofAg-Consultants and Ceres Farms Inc. filed under Chapter 11 of the federal bank­ruptcy laws. Court records show the companies hold assets of S700,000 and liabilities of S2.1 milllon. 
Neither Ellis nor his attorney could be reached for comment. Ellis' wife, Ann, when reached at home, said she had been instructed not to comment. 
Two other area grain elevators Marie O'Toole, a 3-year-old, blue­eyed, strawberry blonde. 
Both parents have said they love their daughter but brought the suit to raise a point: "It's hard bringing up too many children," O'Toole said recently. The couple has four children. "This is something that 
never should have happened." Does someone significant to you have a drinking problem? Does It affect you? Maybe we can help. John Bonina, the O'Tooles' attor-Call 239-5085 ney, said he had not read the deci-1',_..._,.,.__....,~,..~1\---~-..-·,__..,'-"'_....,.j~--.fl.

creditors, according to the Post­
Tribune. 
Eubanks said slow collections of bills, coupled with high interest rates, were responsible at least in panfor the financial troubles ofeach of the three elevators. 
"They have to purchase (their) goods and they generally have 30 to 60 days to pay for them," he said. "If they don't collect from the farmers, who are drawing out their debts, then interest costs can be very

Many of them, however, do gripe about being put in branches for which they did not apply and being denied opportunities to immedi­ately pursue graduate education plans. And in the final analysis one does wonder about many of the Pentagon's decisions. 
These days, it seems that my entire decision-makingprocess has begun to operate by default. A specfic example being my deci­sion not to go to law school. I did successfully take the I.SAT but when it came time to fill out those applications I just couldn't bring myself to compose a personal statement. I took this as a sign that I did not want to go to law school but it may have been pure procastination. 
Adding to my problems is a pep talk I often hear in one ofmy classes. The professor in this class, a dynamic and invigorating lecturer, repeatedly provides enlightening philosophi­cal digressions on what it takes to be success­ful. Doing the work for his class is, ofcourse, a prerequisite but he also offers examples of former students who took his philosophy to heart and have gone onto great heights in the academic and business worlds. After describ­
ing the accomplishments of these past stu­
dents he lets the class know, if they work hard 
enough, they too can reach that enigmatic 
plateau commonly referred to as success. 
After one of these classes my current deci­
sion to stay around home for a year and work 
before (ugh) deciding where to go back to 
school and what to go back in seems wimpish. 
A part of me wants to change my laid back 
ways to that ofa marauding Yuppie whose ul­
timate goal in life is to take over small com­
panies, but such a change would involve 
making a major decision. 
The best solution appears to be to go home and watch television and to wait for those mil­itary recruitment commercials. "Be All You Can Be," seems to be the best advice to follow when faced with those tough choices.

cation seem to desert me when it comes time to make the big choices. And senior year seems to be full ofbig choices. 
Throughout my life I have had the decision­making ability ofa child in a candy store. Now the complex choice ofwhether to buy a grape or cherry sucker has multiplied tenfold into decisions concerning going to grad school or finding a job. And once a decision has been made the ultimate result is the opening of a whole range of new situations where choices have to be made. 
Part of my problem undoubtedly stems from having a bunch of overachievers as friends. Talking to any of them makes me question any current decision I have made about my future. When I talk to one friend who is having his own difficult time deciding between Harvard and Stanford law school, I want to go to law school. Talking to other friends who have secured lucrative jobs makes me want to find gainful employment. Finally, discussing the future with my Rhodes 
Scholar buddy makes me wish I had studied a little harder during my four years under the Golden Dome. 
I am almost to that absurd point where I envy all of my ROTC friends. After all, they at least have the military making sound and com­petent decisions about their futures for them. I hear constant speculation about being sent to basic training camps in such exotic and seemingly fun-filled places as Fort Benning, Georgia and resort-sounding places in Texas.

Where's the beach? 
Florida-the land ofclear water, blue skies, open beer cans -it represents everything Notre Dame is not. 
In Florida, one can drink the water and guzzle the beer without fear of poisoning or arrest. 
In Florida, the air does not reek like a pile of basketball players' socks left after the NCAA Touranment came to town. 
I have developed Murphy's Laws on Florida (called an Irishman's guide to finding a pot of gold):

so it goes 
For the trip down, rent the smallest car 
available and find the fattest people to ride 
with you. 
Never, but never, stop at McDonald's, when 
you can go the whole way without eating. 
Save your money for Florida. 
Bring more luggage than Nancy Reagan would for a week at her ranch. Don't bring a cassette player when you can listen to Phil Collins 48 times on the radio. 
Be friendly with the other riders -you may not be on speaking terms with them on the way back. 
Once in the Sunshine State, act like a native, not a savage. Those who reside in Florida do not generally eat their empty beer cans. 
Do not refer to Florida as the land where -as a friend says -old people go to sweat. 
Allow yourself enough time to get to the 
beach, since your ocean-view hotel is always a 
minimum offive miles away. 
Do not talk to young ladies with purple hair 
or young men with tattoos on their arms of 
young ladies with purple hair. 
Remember, Florida is America's micro­
wave, and you are its frozen dinner. 
Finally, take lots ofpictures because none of 
your (jealous) friends back at school will 
believe you had the incredible time you will 
sayyouhad. 
On the ride back, don't roll the windows down. Keep the air conditioner on maximum since that is the only thing that will keep you from breaking out in sun blisters. 
And finally, when you get back to Notre Dame, stop the car (or at least bring it to a slow roll) and get out and kiss the muddy South Bend ground. It may be wet and chilly, but it's home for four years. 
Uike many of you, had to learn these laws 
the hard way last week I am printing them 
before I forget them, and so that next year you 
can have a road map to the better way of life 
that is Florida. 
Spring break is part of college, but it is not 
college. Four days have past since I left, but I 
still find myself on the beaches (baking in the 
sun). The time has come for school, for work, 
Garry Trudeail 
for what we, the young and restless, call 
"hell." 

Still, there is a purpose to what we do here at Notre Dame. Florida must wait; now is the time to learn. I was tempted to stay in Florida (and had I had my dad's credit cards I may have), but Florida will always be there. We, hopefully, will only be at Notre Dame for four short years. 
In today's world, a college degree is almost 
a prerequisite for success. If we did not 
believe that we would not be here. Most ofus 
seek success material; some of us seek spiri­
tual success. However we define success, all 
of us believe Notre Dame will help us find it. 
Otherwise, we would all be in Florida. 

I wondered how people can go to Florida 
and see how peaceful life can be, and then go 
back to their work with all the pressure that 
goes with it. Work is one long massive heart 
attack, but it is a matter of survival. People 
leave Florida, not because they want to, but 
because they must. 

Accepting the pressure and doing the work make the fun times seem so much more fun. Responsibilty comes with age. Oh, many ofus still called our parents to let them know we arrived safely in Florida, but more and more we are on our own. Vacations now are much more appreciated than vacations as children. Then, life was one constant vacation. 
Oh, I am not saying we have to go to Florida to relax (PadreIsland is nice too). Rather, I am saying that we should make a part ofeach day a vacation. Relax, as Frankie would say, or you'll die young before you have a chance enjoy life. 
And I am not saying pressure always follows 
hard work and that hard workleads to an early 
death. Look at Ronald Reagan. But it can. Re­
member Ernest Hemingway, Judy Garland, 
and Peter Sellers. They either could not cope 
with the pressure or overextended them­
selves. 

I have another law, Murphy's Universal Law, 
which states that you just do the best you can 
where you are; anyone can do less than his 
best. 

And so, I say at a time when the memories of spring break are fried into your being and the hope ofsummer springs forth in your soul, to be patient. Your season in the sun will come. For now, study, study, study. 
Nothing replaces persistence and hard work. Talent will not, nor will beauty. Hard work and determination make all things possi­ble, but do not let the pressure get the best of you. Ifyou do this now, later in life when you are old you can go to Florida (and sweat). I'll be there. Until then, hang ten and ride the waves oflife as a born surfer.

Velvet Underground's sound-timeless treasure 

Tim Adams 
Record review 
T
he Velvet Underground. You've probably never heard a song by them. Then again, you've probably never heard of them, for that matter. But without the Vel­vets, today's music scene would certainly not be the same. 
They never sold many records, but their influence on thousands of bands is, and has been, felt in ~ kinds ofmusic, from avant garde to punk. The Velvets were never the 
most technically proficient band, 
but nonetheless they gave proof 
that inspiration, imagination, and 
succinctness were all that great 
music required. 
To commemorate the 20th an­
niversary of the Velvet Under­
ground's formation, PolyGram 
Records has re-released their first 
three albums, The Velvet Under­
ground and Nico, White 
Ught/White Heat, and The Velvet 
Underground. In addition, the com­
pany has also issued I 0 previously 
unreleased songs by the Velvets, 
recorded between February, 1966 and October, 1969, on a new album called V.U.. 
V.U. is immediately striking be­cause of its very high fidelity. Obvi­ously, much care went into the process of mixing and engineering the 10 songs; they sound as ifthey were recorded yesterday. Ifyou're familiar with the Velvet Under­ground's songs, you'll be startled at 
how good the group can sound 
when produced well. 
Not that the production makes the album; the songs themselves are the stars. Two ofV.U.'s songs feature bassist John Calc, who departed in September, 1968. "I Can't Stand It" is one ofthese, a resonating ditty which displays the group in peak form. Calc's rumbling bass, the dual frenetic guitar work ofSterling Morrison and Lou Reed, and Maureen Tucker's solid drum­ming all choogle along, with Reed, 
in his Brooklyn accent, singing, "I can't stand it any maw, maw." The other song which features Calc is "Temptation inside Your Heart." Bongo-spiced and a little nutty, "Temptation" is a hip, fast-paced 
composition that cannot be 
resisted. My only regret is that it 
isn't any longer. At any rate, these 
two songs are quite good. 
In fact, V.U. does not contain a 
bum song. Even with the variety 
represented here, the Velvets have 
shown that they can handle it all, from hard rockers to romantic 
ballads. Surprisingly, lots ofVelvet 
Underground fans think that the 
Velvets' ballads are some of their 
best songs. From the robotic yet 
effective singing ofGerman chan­
teuse Nico on "Femme Fatale" to 
Lou Reed's touching, restrained 
vocal performance on "Pale Blue 
Eyes," this "wimpy" outlet has proved to be a pot ofgold for the 
Velvets. 
On V.U., "Stephanie Says" and "I'm Sticking with You" similarly join the ranks ofclassic 60s ballads. The former is simple and beautiful. From the soft, tuneful backup sing­ing to the delicate instrumentation (featuring xylophone and viola), this song gives the listener a really good feeling. "I'm Sticking with You," the other ballad, ends the album in grand fashion. Sung mostly by Maureen Tucker (who makes up in directness what she lacks in vocal strength), this one will remind you of another old Mo Tucker vocal piece called "Afterhours." Except on "Sticking," Tucker receives help from the rest ofthe band towards 
the end, as they build up to a low crescendo. It's a glorious ending, one that signifies fidelity to a friend, lover, or both. 
Lou Reed, who has gone on to a solo career of some note, sings the rest of the songs on V.U.. He gets aggressive, as does the guitar playing, on the hard-rocking "Foggy Notion," but then he rattles off the child-like lyrics on the funny We have a good chance to win. 
Marquette is our closest rival.'' 
Gioffre commented on the Rock­
Alike contest, ''We have some good 
participants. It is the final major 
event. We need the full support of 
the student body in order to make it 
a success.'' 

''Beingour last major event, we hope people will come out and support it,'' Gioffre continued. ''We hope the student body has enjoyed the events. We appreciate the par­ticipation given. This is one last 
contribution. '' 

Following this weekend, the official ND Millions Against M S contribution will be sent to the New Yorkofficeofthe National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Gioffre requests that all organizations and donns deliver their money as soon

fall," says O'Sullivan. "Being named 
to the all-conference team has 
proven his skill." 

The spring trip tournament was 
played on Miami's Fountainbleau 
Course, a par-72 championship­
calibre site with a 73.5 course rating. 
"I wouldn't know what to do with­
out spring trips," O'Sullivan com­
ments. "They're a necessity. We'd be 
in the intramural leagues without 
them." 

The Irish begin their spring 
season Saturday with the Tri-State 
meet. "Our goal is to try and break 
the course record of 359," says 
O'Sullivan optimistically regarding 
the 13-year-old mark. 

Sunday is a triangular meet against 
Xavier University (Cincinnati) and 
Detroit's Wayne State. Both meets 
are scheduled for the Burke 
Memorial Golf Course. 

This weekend's play also marks the beginning of the season for the Irish blue team, the second squad. "This could very well be the best blue team ever," says O'Sullivan. The No. 1 player for the blue team is junior Tim Hanlon, followed by sop­homores Tom Ryan and Mike Cul­ver, and freshmen Joe Hills and John Parker. Junior Blake Garside, who O'Sullivan calls the "true" No. 1 on the blue team, will be out for the spring season after having hand sur­
gery. 

O'Sullivan is confident that the success in Florida will serve as a for­midable springboard for the spring. In addition to the two home dual meets, five 54-hole tournaments lie ahead for the Irish in which they will face teams representing the Big Ten, the Mid-American Conference and major independents, among others. 
''I'm going to enjoy this season," O'Sullivan says. "I really am. The rap­port, consideration and respect be­tween the players has been wonderful. 
"We hit a pretty good thing down there in Florida. It can happen again."

Referee Bain sues over 
Piane named coach of the year 
Notre Dame cross country coach Joe Piane was honored by being named District IV coach of the year along with Gary Wieneke of Illinois at the NCAA Indoor Track Championships in Syracuse, N.Y. The 37-year old Piane guided the Irish to their most successful campaign in his 1 0 seasons with a nineteenth place finish at the NCAA cham­pionships. 
"It's a tribute to the kids and 
not to me," offered Piane upon 
hearing ofthe award. "Thi~ year's 
teain just did an excellent job. All 
along I knew they had the poten­
tial to qualify for the NCAA's and 
they did it in one of the nation's 
toughest regions." · 
Piane's tenth edition of Irish cross country swept through the regular season with an unde­feated slate and then placed fourth in the District IV cham­
pionships behind Wisconsin, Illi­nois and Michigan. During the course of the year, Notre Dame captured its second 

disputed T -shirt design 
title for the first time in 19 years.

damaged his career, reputation and peace ofmind. 
Bain's lawyer, David Dutton of Waterloo, claimed in his closing statement that Gillispie created aT­shirt showing B;tin being hanged in effigy for the purpose of capitalizing on a storm of protest Bain created with a late foul call at a March 6, 1982 basketball game between Iowa and Purdue. 
In that game, Bain called a shoving foul on Iowa's Kevin Boyle as _time elapsed. The late call allowed Purdue's Dan Palombizio to make two free throws with no time left. 
they never threatened after tying the score, 1-1, early in the first quarter, the Irish played better as the game progressed. 
"We wanted to make sure that we kept improving during the game," said O'Leary. "We wanted to end the game well and everything worked out favorably." 
Unfortunately for the Irish, though, they were not able to dupli­cate their performance against Duke and New Hampshire, two teams that had more talented players than Notre Dame. The Blue Devils blew open a close game in the final minutes of the first half, while New Hampshire took the Irish out of the game early by scoring nine of the first ten goals. 
"I'm disappointed because, if we had played as well against Duke and New Hampshire as we did against Loyola, we would have won at least one more game," says O'Leary. "The teams we played were better than us, but I feel the scores were not in­
dicative ofour team. 
"We did get a real good assess­ment of the team, though. We knew we were going in over our heads in the Loyola Tournament (where the Irish played ·both the Greyhounds and New Hampshire), but we learned just how good we are compared to the teams of the East. 
"We're able to sit down now and better evaluate the individual talent and develop an offense that our tal­ent is capable of running," adds O'Leary. 
Offense does seem like the major weakness of the Irish after the trip. Trocchi (five goals, five assists) and Joe Franklin (nine goals, one assist) played well on the attack, but the midfielders failed to show much scoring punch. 
"We're going to have to change our philosophy a little," says O'Leary. "We thought we could score in settled situations by creat· ing offense with our middies. We concentrated a lot on that in practice, but we couldn't do it against the teams we played, and we hadn't practiced in an unsettled sit· uation which was our strength last year. Now we'll try to do both so we can get a good offense."

tor. 

The Irish coaches are now hoping that through this move they can prevent the potential crisis of not having a capable quarterback to run the offense in the event of an injury to starting quarterback Steve Beuer­lein. Last year's backup, Scott Grooms, will graduate in May, leaving only the three freshmen to fiJI his role. 
"(Hudson) felt there was just not 
enough time to do the job he wanted 
when it came to working with the 
young quarterbacks as well as coor­
dinating the ideas of the offensive 
staff." said Faust when he made the 
announcement of the coaching switch. 
Although Hudson will be relin­quishing the role ofoffensive coord­inator, Faust will still look to him for help with the offensive philosophy. 
"We want to be able to go into the fall with confidence in our backup quarterbacks, and that's going to re­quire all of Ron's attention this spring and in the fall," continued Faust. "But when it comes to plan­ning the offense, the quarterback coach is going to be just as involved as anyone else." 
The official task of coordinating the offensive philosophy now will be thrown to pass receivers coach Mike Stock. Stock will continue to serve as pass receivers coach, al­though his other duties, that of special-teams coach and recruiting coordinator, have been reassigned 
to fellow assistant coaches Mal Moore and joe Yonto, respectively. 
Stock, who is in his third year of a second tour of duty as an Irish assis­tant, is no stranger to the offensive coordinator role, as he held that ex­act job for three seasons at the Uni­versity of Wisconsin before moving on to be head coach at Eastern Mic­higan for five years. 
Stock feels that his role will be to basically synthesize the ideas of the Irish coaching staff into a successful offensive philosophy.

Lacrosse team gains experience on Eastern road trip over spring break 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 

Nobody said that Spring Break '85 was going to be easy for the Notre Dame lacrosse team as it headed to Baltimore to take on four East Coast teams. And the trip was indeed as tough as expected as the defending Midwest Lacrosse Association champs struggled to a 1·3 record. 
The trip featured the best compe· tition the Irish should see this year as they took on Duke, Vermont, New Hampshire and Loyola ( Md. ). AI· though the results will not help the team's record, Notre Dame coach Rich O'Leary hopes that the tough opponents will be good preparation for the Ml.A schedule which begins today with a game against Lake For· est College at 3:30 p.m. on Cartier Field. 
"I'm worried because I now know how badly we can play, but I think the adjustments that we made over the last few games have made us a better team," says O'Leary, who has 
been leading the Irish since lacrosse became a varsity sport five years ago. "Ifwe keep improving, we shouldn't be an easy game for anyone and we could win them all." 
The Foresters should serve as a good yardstick to measure Notre Dame's improvement. Last year they gave the Irish a tough fight, taking an early lead and staying even through three quarters, before O'Leary's squad exploded for six unanswered goals to take an 11-5 victory. 
Both Notre Dame and Lake Forest find themselves in the same division of the MLA · the Great Lakes Lacrosse Association · which also in· eludes Ohio State, Michigan State, Ashland College, Wittenberg and Mt. Union. The main goal of each team, though, will be winning the Midwest championship since there is no MLA championship game. The league champion will be deter­mined by a selection committee of judges. 
"I'd rather not start out the Mid­western part of the season with a conference game," explains O'Leary, "but we've played some real good teams now. The teams we'll play the rest of the year aren't as good as Loyola or New Hampshire, but we still can't afford to let down." 
Loyola and New Hampshire, as well as Duke, showed the Irish that they are still well below the level of play of many of the Eastern teams as they repeatedly took advantage of Notre Dame's mistakes to move out to big leads. The Irish were able to handle Vermont, 8-6, to start out the trip, but dropped the last three by fairly lopsided scores · 18-4 (Duke), 13·7 (Loyola), and 12·3 (New Hampshire). 
Although the Irish played well for most of the Vermont game, the win over the Catamounts was not the highlight of the trip · the loss to

Finishes third in Florida tournament 
Irish golf team starts spring season 
By MARC RAMIREZ 
Sports Writer 

Normally the Notre Dame golf team's spring trip to Florida is used primarily as preparation for the spring season. But following a good fall session, Coach Noel O'Sullivan 
was convinced his players had the right mental attitude and prepara­tion going into last week's Florida In· ternational Tournament not only to take part, but also, as he put it, "to be competitive." 
lbe right stuff paid off as the Irish came away with a remarkable third­place finish in Miami, finishing be­hind host Florida International University and Boca Raton. 
"I was very pleased," says 
O'Sullivan. "Not just with the team's 
performance, but also with the 
players' preparation, sportsmanship 
and manner. 

"To go south and take part in a 
tournament where five Florida 
schools are participating and come 
out third is a fine accomplishment. 
But it doesn't mean we're all that 
powerful yet." 

The Irish finished with an overall score of 984, while FlU earned a score of 925 and Boca Raton 9T5. Yale came in fourth at 988, with Bis· cayne College and Salem State ran flfth and sixth with scores of 1001 and 1002, respectively. 
Team captain John O'Donovan led Notre Dame, posting a 242 score that was good enough for seventh place out of a field of 60. As well as being captain and No. 1 player ofthe golf team, O'Donovan also is captain and No. 1 skier for the Notre Dame ski team. "He's only the second player in my 13 years as golf coach that didn't have an 80 in the fall round of our schedule," O'Sullivan says of the Ada, Mich., resident. "That's superb · a sign of a highly 
skilled performer." 

Freshman Rich Connelly of Per­rysburg, Ohio, came in second for the Irish with a score of 246, which gave him 11th place overall. Con· nelly had only one fall score in the 80s · and an 80 at that. "Rich is the only freshman to make the first team and make it with a lot of thunder," says O'Sullivan. "He's an excellent player from tee to green. He missed conference honors by only one stroke this fall and that's some way for a freshman to make his mark." 
Finishing just behind Connelly was juniorJohn Anthony, with a final tally of 247 and 12th place overall. The Ft. Worth, Tex., native is a second-year member of the squad, and according to O'Sullivan, is get· ting his chance on the first team after a fine fall season. "John can score some consistent rounds with his outstanding putting stroke," O'Sullivan says. "His future is now." 
Lon Huffman, from Roseville, Calif., scored a 253 for Notre Dame. A third-year letterman, Huffman is expected to make a solid contribu­tion to the team this year. 
Finishing fifth for Notre Dame was sophomore Chris Bona, with a score of 254. "Chris' confidence is build­ing after a strong fall season," says O'Sullivan of the Western Springs, Ill., resident. "He has a great deal of potential." 
In sixth place for the Irish was 
junior Steve Fuhrer of Oakmont, Pa.

Brent, Billy and their use of cliches 

Chuck Freeby 
Irish Items 
Hello again everybody! 
If you have now seen so much basketball that your eyes have Spalding imprinted on their corneas, if you constantly hum the opening song of CBS basketball telecasts, and if you know that the Ugabee Travel Agency is the "official travel agency of the 1985 NCAA basketball tournament," you have become a basketball junkie. You can appreciate the topic of this column. 
But even if you don't know a high post from a lamp post, a 2·3 zone from a tow-away zone, or Jim Bain and Patrick Ewing from Conrad Bain and J.R. Ewing, this may hold some interest for you. For if you have watched even one telecast ofthis NCAA tournament, you could be the next Brent Musberger or Billy Packer. All you have to do is remember a few cliches. 
These are the familiar utterances used more often than we would 
like to admit by sportswriters and sportscasters, even by alleged 
ones such as yours truly. They are convenient, time-worn crutches 
which take up time and space and say absolutely nothing. So if you 
think you want a job in the media, just remember a few of these: 
"He's 
a player" . This would be fine if every time the camera showed somebody the announcer told us his occupation. For in­stance, you never hear "she's a cheerleader," "he's a tuba player," or "he's a welder." I can see he's wearing a uniform, so I assume he's a player. If he's not a player, then what is he? THAT would be telling me something. · 

"He's 
some kind ofplayer"· Well, that's as obvious as the preced­ing one. Ofcourse he's some kind ofplayer, but what kind ofplayer is he? He could be a terrible player, and still deserve the title of"some kind ofplayer." Use any adjective in place of"some kind of' and you say something meaningful, and thus lose every right to be read or heard. 

"He.c.,,e 
to play" -1 certainly hope he came to play, because ifhe didn't he's in the wrong place. What else did he have in mind in that get-up if he didn't come to play? Just once, I would like to see the camera get a shot of some walk-on who never plays and have the announcer say "He came to sit the bench. He has no intention of · playing." 

"Cinderella 
Team" · If you hear the name Villanova used this weekend without this phrase following within the next 15 seconds, consider yourself fortunate. Somehow I can't picture a short, balding Italian man like Rollie Massimino wearing a glass slippe·r, going to a ball with a prince and talking to a winged creature. He looks more like the Keebler Elf than Cinderella. So, please don't call the Wildcats the "Cinderella Team." 

"They 
need a basket" · 'lbank you, Dick Tracy. Of course, they need a basket. In fact, if a team is trailing, it's going to be kind of difficult to win unless it gets a few baskets. On the other hand, if a team is ahead, it doesn't really need a basket. It might want a basket to make things easier, but all it really needs to do is stop the op· ponent from getting a basket. So, on one hand this is stating the obvious and on the other hand, it's just wrong. 

"There 
is no shot clock and there will be next year" · If you have watched one game in the tournament, you know this by now, so it doesn't need to be said again. If you haven't watched a game, you probably don't care that much, so the absence ofa shot clock doesn't make any difference to you. In either case, the fact that the Kukamonga Conference used a shot clock all year but doesn't havt. one here but will have one next year if they get to the NCAA tourna­ment doesn't matter. That doesn't mean it won't be said, though. 

"He's 
deadly from there" ·This can only be said ofBernard Goetz on a subway. Bernard is definitely "deadly" from there. However, the fact that Chris Mullin can make a jump shot from the corner 90 percent of the time does not make him hazardous to your health. As far as science knows, a good jump shot is one of the few things that does not cause cancer, and thus it is not deadly. 

"They've 
shown a lot of heart" · This is great if you have a team made up of William Schroeder, Barney Clark, and Murray Hayden and have it coached by Dr. William DeVries. These guys have shown a lot of heart in the past few years. Unless I'm misinformed, not too many people have. 


So you now have the basics to do your own broadcast this weekend. Turn down the sound, and pick which announcer you want to be. If you want to be Brent, drool over Georgetown, call everyone a key player, tell how wrong it is to malign the deities of John Thompson and Patrick Ewing and get a haircut. If you want to be Billy, explain why you wouldn't do any of these coaching manuevers, extol the virtues of ACC basketball despite the fact that no teams from that conference are in the Final Four and lose a lot of hair. 
On second thought, just turn down the sound. There's no sense making a fool out of yourself. 
Pick of the Week. .. Making plans to go out to the Burke Memorial Golf Course this weekend? Guess again. The Irish golf team holds domain over Burke this weekend with their only two home matches of the season. On Saturday, Notre Dame entertains Tri-State, while on Sunday the Xavier Musketeers pay a visit. 
Ofcourse, that doesn't mean you should stay away from Burke. Go on out and give some support to the Irish linksters. Maybe you can even talk coach Noel O'Sullivan into giving you a free tip or two. If your game is like mine, it couldn't hurt.
