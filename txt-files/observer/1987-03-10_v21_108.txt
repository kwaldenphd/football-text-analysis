This Arkansan explains origin of 'Southern paranoia' 
A new magazine called Southern began publishing last year out of my home town of Little Rock Arkansas. It's a major publication, chock full df glossy full-page ads from the likes of Sears Ford and Eastern Airlines. It's debut issue fe~tured a series called An Insider's Guide to the Species which covered such topics as "The Southern Mind," "The Southern Body," "The Southern Heart" and "The Southern Soul." 
If anything, the magazine demons~rates that the South sure thinks a lot about 1tself. The South is a region with a historic inferiority com­plex that continues today --something Souther­nenrs can't escape even when they're aware of it --which contributes in a large part to what my roommate once called my "Southern 
paranoia." . . 
A person afflicted by Southern paran01a 1s immediately sensitive to any derogatory remarks about the region. Or he may go over­
board on the Southern thing. I've even met Southern paranoids who've lived years in the North and claim they'll never go back to their origins, yet somehow they hang on to Southern accents thicker than how they used to speak. 
When I was nine I remember reading Charles Portis' novel True Grit, which was set in Arkansas and underlining all the references he made to my state. On a car trip to Florida the summer I was eight I wrote a song aout Arkansas because we were leaving it for other states. When my family would go skiing in Colorado with other Arkansans we kids would call the Hogs on the slopes --that means we would yell out "Whoo, pig, sooee!," the cheer for the Razorbacks --because we were proud of our home and sensed somehow we had to defend that pride in other parts of the country. 
Freshman year a friend of mine from Mic­higan heard I was from Little Rock. "You're having some bad racial problems down there, aren't you? I read about that high school in my history book." She shook her head disparaging­ly. "When are they going to let blacks into your schools?" She was speaking of Little Rock Central High, which made international news in 1957 when Governor Orval Faubus called out the National Guard to prevent integration. But ignorant comments like that perpetuate South­ern paranoia. What about Jones Beach, New York? That's a much more recent and equally repugnant example of racism. But here was this student from Michigan who had attended a practically all-white Catholic private high

school reproaching me, who was a minority in my public high school that was 58 percent black, about integration. 
In Arkansas we have a saying: ''Thank God for Mississippi." And we only mean it half fasci­ciously. Without the state of Mississippi, our neighbor to the east, Arkansas would be dead last in every demographic category worth brag­ging about and dead first in every category worth laughing about --laughing, that is, if it's not your state that has to worry about the prob­lem. We are usually only first in things like killer tornados. On paper, the state cuts a tragi­comic figure. But the rest of the country sees only the woeful statistics; it doesn't see the state's beautiful lakes and mountains and the rich delta farmland where the blues were born. The rest of the country laughs where Arkansas and all Southerners--have immense pride, and therefore we become paranoid. 
This about this next time you make fun of someone's Southern accent.

Judicial Council discusses plans for improving hall judicial boards 


By ROB HENNIG Senior Staff Reporter 
New approaches to using the judical boards more effectively in each dormitory were dis­cussed at Monday night's Judi­cial Council meeting. 
According to Judicial Coord­inator Maria Cintron, some judicial boards were not active this year. The purpose of the meeting was to share informa­tion with hall rectors as well as judicial board chairmen. Ap­proximately five rectors atten­ded the meeting . 
Father Gerald Lardner, rec­tor of Grace Hall, spoke about the the role the Grace board plays in hall discipline.

fense is an offense against resi­dents." 
Lardner added that he vi­olates du Lac by not allowing students to be punished by him. "I simply do not let them come to me," he said. 
Lardner said once the board has chosen a penalty, he will not challenge it. "I will not overrule a decision," he said. 
Grace Judicial Board Chair­man Chris Simms said the board emphasizes punish­ments involving an offender's time. 
"We don't deal in monetary fines because there are a lot of students here that monetary fines won't touch," Simms said. 
According to Brendan Judge, Keenan board co-chairman, the Keenan judicial board does not just function as a discipli­nary agent. 
"We also see the J-board functioning in terms of counsel­ing," Judge said. 
Some concern was expressed about the need for secrecy in board proceedings. Lardner said he did not think confiden­tiality was presently a prob­lem. He added that punish­ments should be a matter of public record. 
"I personally would prefer that you post J-board deci­sions," Lardner said. 
The nature of the judicial boards as they relate to each dorm was also discussed. Ac­cording to Lewis Rector Chris­tine Mengucci, the boards in the female halls are used dif­ferently than in the male halls. 
"I don't think that women's halls have the same type of of­fenses that (men's) halls do," Mengucci said. 
"I think that each dorm needs to develop and see how (each) judicial board can be used," said Cintron. "Just the idea the students have the place to go if they want," she added.

Women riot when male strip show is cancelled 
Associated Press 
MONROEVILLE, Pa. About 600 women who paid $10 each to watch a male strip show turned into an angry mob when the performance was canceled, officials say. 
"They just went ape," said Public Safety Director John Danzilli. 
Women hurled bottles from the bar, and one woman was injured when she fell trying to hit a doorman at the Ritz nightclub, at the Monroeville Howard Johnson's, Danzilli said. 
He estimated damage in the Saturday night melee at $500 in broken glass and chairs. 
According to Danzilli, the promoter of the Manpower Revue canceled the strip show after club operator AI Monzo refused to pay him in cash. 
The promoter "told him there was going to be a riot. He went on stage and told those women the show was can­celed," Danzilli said. "He said 'If you want your money back, you can sue AI Monzo. That's what we're going to do.' " 
State troopers and police from five departments were called in to restore order.

2 teens charged with fatally stabbing priests 
Associated Press 
BUFFALO, N.Y.-Two teen­
agers have been charged in the 
stabbing deaths of two inner­
city Roman Catholic priests 
who were slain 12 days and less 
than a mile apart. One of the 
young men confessed, police 
said Monday. 
The deaths had prompted 
warnings that priests should 
not let strangers into their 
homes. 
Investigators arrested Mil­ton E. Jones, 17, in Buffalo late Sunday, Police Commissioner Ralph V. Degenhart said at a news conference. 
The second defendant, Theodore Simmons, 18, also of Buffalo, was picked up early Monday in California by San Diego police after information was obtained from his family on his whereabouts. 
Homicide Chief Richard T. Donovan said robbery was the motive in the slayings of the Rev. A. Joseph Bissonette, 55, in the rectory of St. Bar­tholomew's Church on Feb. 24, and of Monsignor David P. Her­lihy, 74, in the rectory at St. Matthew's Church. Herlihy's body was found early Sunday. 
After his arrest, Jones "provided the homicide bureau with a confession to both priest murders," Degenhart said. 
Simmons and Jones were each charged with two counts of second-degree murder, two of first-degree robbery, and third-degree criminal posses­sion of a weapon. 
Dennis Vacco, an assistant district attorney of Erie County, said he was filing papers to arrange Simmons' extradition. 
Both priests had been stabbed repeatedly in the chest. The rectories are less than a mile apart on Buffalo's East Side. 
"These were cold-blooded 
killers," Chief of Detectives 
Angelo Alessandra said. He 
said a considerable amount of 
money was taken in the rob­
beries, but declined to say how 
much. 
Priests at St. Michael's had met Sunday and decided not to allow any strangers into the rectory late at night. Degen­hart had urged other priests not to let strangers into their homes. 
"There's a big sense of relief," the Rev. John Sturm of St. Michael's Church said after the arrests. 


Fugitive killer Dallas found; harbored by two cowboys 
Associated Press 
LOS Angeles -Two cowboys have been arrested on charges of harboring Claude Dallas Jr., the fugitive killer of two game wardens who was recaptured after roaming in disguise from Oregon to Mexico for nearly a year, the FBI said Monday. 
RichardT. Bretzing, the FBI chief in Los Angeles, said aut­horities succeeded in catching up with the trapper, who fled the Idaho State Penitentiary last March 30, because they knew he had a past association with one of the cowboys and kept him under surveillance. 
FBI officials said they also arrested Gregory Brent Davis, 35, a cowboy from Perris, and Dan McCurry Martinez, 35, of Riverside, a cowboy and a welder, on charges they "knowingly harbored, transported and supported Dal­las." 
Both were arrested Sunday night at Martinez's home in Riverside. 
"We set up a web around Martinez to catch Dallas," Bretzing said, adding that Mar­tinez had been here for only a matter of weeks or months and that Dallas arrived in just the past few days. 
Bretzing said Martinez had known Dallas for some time before the 1981 shooting of the game wardens. The FBI cannot yet trace all of Dallas' path since his escape, Bretzing added.

Buddhists to enthrone 2-year-old 
Associated Press 
KAPAN, Nepal-Tibetan Bud­dhist lamas are seeking an auspicious date to enthrone a 2-year-old Spanish boy they believe is the reincarnation of the leader of a major monas­tery. 
The Buddhist parents of Ozel Iza Torres brought him to India last month and are planning to take him to the Kapan monas­tery, where he is to take the seat of the late high lama Thub­ten Yeshe. 
But disciples in the monas­tery 10 miles northeast of Kat­mandu said they didn't know when he would arrive. 
Owen Cole, 37, a disciple from Perth, Australia, said several lamas would decide the date of the ceremony and ap­parently are looking for an auspicious occasion. 
The boy's mother, Maria Torres, 33, came to Katmandu three weeks ago with her four other children to make sure Ozel, her youngest child, will have no problems adjusting to his new home. 
"Ozel is still in Delhi," Torres said Saturday. "I was waiting here for the child to be enthroned as the head lama of Kapan monastery. But I don't know whether the ceremony will take place here or in Dharamsala." 
Dharamsala, in northern In­dia, is the home of the Dalai Lama, the leader of Tibetan Buddhism. 
Torres said the Dalai Lama has confirmed that Ozel, born near Granada, Spain, on Feb. 
12, 1985, is the reincarnation of Yeshe. 
Y-eshe visted Spain several times as he traveled around the world to open Buddhist teach­ing centers. He died in San Francisco on March 3, 1984. 
The Kapan monastery operates the Mount Everest School for Buddhist Studies, where 70 young monks and 60 visitors from all over the world are undergoing training. 
Before leaving Spain, Torres told the Madrid newspaper Diario 16 she did not know if her son would ever return to Spain. She said her biggest problem with him is having "a son and a master at the same time."

Ozone chemicals linked to 'epidemic' of cancer 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Prompt in­ternational action is needed against widely used ozone­destroying chemicals that are indirectly causing skin cancers at an almost epidemic pace, scientists warned a House hearing Monday. 
"At the current rate, about one in seven Americans will develop (some form of) this disease during their lifetime," said Dr. Darrel Rigel, a re­search physician from New York University Medical Cen­ter 
"The rate of skin cancer in the United States is increasing at a near epidemic pace," Rigel told an Energy and Com­merce health and environment subcommittee hearing on depletion of the Earth's stratospheric ozone layer. 
He said physicians believe the major cause of skin cancer is the ultraviolet rays of the sun, which are filtered by stratospheric ozone. Other wit­nesses said that while there is still scientific uncertainty, it appears that the ozone layer is being destroyed by chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons. 
Rigel said the estimated number of cases of malignant melanoma -the skin cancer type most often fatal -has risen eightfold in the last seven years, making it the fastest rising type except lung cancer in women. 
He said five years ago New York University researchers estimated that one in 250 Americans would develop malignant melanoma during their lifetimes and projected an increase to one in 150 by the year 2000. 
The recent surge in skin can­cer rates, Rigel said, has forced revisions -the lifetime risk is now one in 135; the year­2000 projection is one in 90; and for 2075, it is one in three. 
He told the subcommittee that not only is the skin cancer rate rising, the disease is being found in people of increasingly younger age. 
"Five years ago, it was un­usual to see persons under the age of 40 with skin cancer," Rigel said. "Now we will often see persons in their 20s with this disease." 
He said although many fac­tors have been linked to skin cancer, "the generally ac­cepted most important factor is exposure to ultraviolet light. 
One would expect skin can­cer rates to increase as the ozone thins." 
And that, other witnesses warned, is exactly what is hap­pening around the world, both in the much-publicized ozone hole appearing several months a year over the Antarctic but also to a lesser extent in warmer latitudes. 
They said that although the exact cause is not scientifically proven, the situation probably stems from emissions of ozone­destroying chlorofluorocar­bons, which are used as aerosol spray propellants, refrigerants and industrial solvents and in some foam packaging. 
"There is now compelling ob­servational evidence that the chemical composition of the at­mosphere is changing at a rapid rate on a global scale," said Dr. Robert T. Watson, act­ing manager for upper atmo­spheric research at the Na­tional Aeronautics and Space Administration.

College students losing sight of world issues 
The purpose of "Dialogue on Educa­tion" is to raise constructive discussion on the meaning ofuniversity education today and its role in society. This column is the first in a series on this topic. The committee for "Dialogue on Education" invites all students, staff, and faculty to contribute to this dialogue by expressing their views on the questions posed in this column and on other issues related to university education and society today. 
Is college education nothing more than glorified vocational-technical training? Is it simply a route to a better career and higher income? Has the American dream been reduced to a quest for riches, a search for El Dorado? 
Gregory Maggetti 
guest column 
A number of recent reports and sur­veys of American colleges have con­firmed many people's suspicion that today's students have lost a sense of social responsibility. The annual sur­vey of the University of California at Los Angeles and the American Council of Education shows that 73 percent of college students listed "being very well-off financially" as a top goal of their education. 
The same survey found a steady in­crease in student concern in being af­fluent and a decrease of altruism and social concern. The Carnegie Founda­tion's report on college education in America tells that careerism, creden­tialism and vocationalism have sapped higher education of its sense of social purpose. Degrees in business are on the rise. A liberal arts education, once the dominant program on college cam­puses, is regarded as inappropriate for today's job market. 
But is preparation for a career the sole mission of colleges? Traditionally, university education was meant to pro­vide a breadth of vision that enabled students to understand their contempo­rary society in the light of history and the ideals of justice and liberty. There­fore, liberal arts education, with its focus on philosophy, literature and his­tory, among other fields, was always very important. 
The Carnegie report, "College: The Undergraduate Experience in America," however, has found that the overarching problem in higher educa­tion today is the loss of interrelatedness between universities and the wider so­ciety. The authors of the report note " ... a disturbing gap between the college and the larger world. There is ... an in­tellectual and social isolation that reduces the effectiveness of faculty and limits the vision of the student." 
You don't have to look far to see why the social and civic aspects are being drained from college education, and why it is largely viewed as an individual investment. To a large extent, the withdrawal of public resources for edu­cation has forced students to believe that their education must pay off in higher future income if it is to justify the high cost. 
Also, the political rhetoric of recent years has put individualism and signs of economic prosperity above a real commitment to social justice. 
It's quite a long leap, however, from the notion that self-interested in­dividualism will increase gross na­tional product to the assertion that it will also lead to a more just society. We cannot ignore the fact that in the United States, the showcase for demo­cratic capitalism, the past decade has seen a drastic deterioration in the stan­dard of life for many people. 
The U.S Catholic Bishops, in their pastoral letter on the U.S. economy, have enumerated some of the more prominent challenges to economic and social justice that . our system has proven impotent in dealing with, and which in part were engendered by the system itself. Some of these include : the degrading situations of unemploy­ment and homelessness experienced by many; "dwindling social supports for family stability; a driven pace of life among the successful that can sap love and commitment;" the problems of American farming and the situation among migrant farm workers; and the overshadowing problem for Third World poverty. 
These issues are only some of the con­temporary problems which we must confront. Some others are: the tension between super powers with the under­lying threat of a nuclear confrontation, and the resources used up in defense industries and the use of f)ther peoples as pawns in the geopolitical power struggle; the ethical dilemmas caused by the seemingly autonomous expan­sion of technology; the cultural poverty resulting from consumerism; ques­tions concerning the ethical use of mass media, with the constant, but yet often unrecognized threat of their being used as tools for propaganda; and the ap­parent meaninglessness of life that

haunts many people. 
Given the complexity of these prob­lems it is hard to believe that self­interested individualism is the appro­priate social virtue to preach. The world's ills will not go away by magic. Rather, the resolution of today's press­ing problems requires a conscious in­volvememnt on our part. It requires an ability to discern these problems clearly within the wider context of human life and society. Indeed, our par­ticipation in the process of creating a more human and just society rests on our ability to respond to the moral chal­lenges we face, and this ability depends on our discernment and breadth of vi­sion. 
When considered in this light, educa­tion for individual affluence is educa­tion for civic and social impoverish­ment. At a critical moment in human history, we must ask whether the pres­ent crisis in education isn't undermin­ing our future capacity to meet the chal­lenges facing us. Are we blindly ignoring the questions which we must eventually confront? 
Although Notre Dame has always pledged its commitment to provide an education that emphasizes civic and so­cial responsibility as well as academic excellence, it would be naive to believe that this campus has not felt the impact of the contemporary wave of excessive individualism, narrowness of vision, and short-sightedness which has swept over the nation. 
We are at a moment in the history of our university, our nation, and our world when we must re-examine the purpose of university education. 
We are a university rich in tradition of social and civic responsibility. And there are resources available to us here that provide a wealth of potential for the future. But we need to look at how integrated our classwork, research, and extracurricular activities are and whether they reflect a spirit of commit­ment to the common good. 
We have the Center for Social Con­cerns. How many students, faculty, and staff make use of it? How many of us are aware of the programs and organ­izations operating from the CSC? Are we involved? 
What is the role of student organiza­tions in promoting a well-rounded col­lege education? What part do the Peace Institute, the Kellogg Institute, the Cen­ter for the Study of Contemporary So­ciety and other institutes and programs on campus play in the educational ex­perience? How many of us take advan­taghe of these resources? 
How do the various departments en­deavor to foster open-mindedness, critical-inquisitiveness and reflection on social issues? 
These are some of the questions that need to be raised if we are to begin a realistic appraisal of the larger social issues and our role as a university com­munity in confronting these issues. The authors of the Carnegie Foundaiton report state that "what we need today is a constructive debate about the meaning of the undergraduate college and a willingness to make this part of the educational enterprise a more vital, more enriching institution." 
Such a debate needs to happen right here at the University. We need to ex­amine what is right and what is wrong at Notre Dame. What are the signs of hope for the future? Where is the po­tential for our playing a more dynamic role in creating a more human world? How can we, and how do we get in­volved? 
Indeed, are we nothing more than a glorified voc-tech institute, or do we have an obligation to become open­
minded, well-informed,  and critical  
citizens of the world?

Irish baseball squad heads for San Antonio after three tough losses 

By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame baseball team will attempt to rebound from three close losses to In­diana last weekend when they head south over spring break to Texas. 
The Irish opened their season with the three defeats despite strong pitching performances from a young staff. 
"It is very difficult to start out 0-3," said Notre Dame head coach Larry Gallo. "We could have won three games this

By PETE GEGEN Assistant Sports Editor 
The Irish indoor track team ran to an impressive, though not totally satisfying, 17th­place finish at the IC4A Indoor Championships at Cambridge, Mass. 
The meet was won by Penn State, followed by Villanova, George Mason and Geor­getown. 
Four members did all the scoring for Notre Dame. Fresh­man Glenn Watson placed fourth in the 55-meter high hurdles with a time of 7.44, and junior Tim Brown took sixth in the 55-meter dash with a 6.43 clocking. 
Freshman Tom Kraus finished sixth in the shot put with a toss of 52-8 314, and soph­omore David Warth also placed in the 1000-meter run. 
"It was just a great track meet," said Head Coach Joe Piane. "It was the best IC4A's I've ever seen. The track was great and the depth of compe-

"We didn't get the points we needed when we had the ball at the end of regulation," said Peters. "After they jumped ahead in the OT, we couldn't tition was unbelievable." 
For example, the distance medley relay's time of 9:57.0 would have been good enough for second place last year, but this time around the Irish did not even place. The relay was comprised of Brown, senior co­captain Robert Nobles, fresh­man Mike O'Conner and soph­omore Ron Markezich. 
Others who qualified for the meet but did not place in the finals include Rick Muench in the triple jump and Chris Mat­teo, who was injured in the preliminaries of the pole vault. 
"We could have done a little bit better," said Piane. "Timmy Brown finished sixth, but he's better than that. Wat­son could have had second, and Kraus needed just an inch more." 
In a season of inches, the Irish indoor track team must be looking forward to the metric world of the outdoor season. This meet marked the end of the indoor season for the team, as no member qualified for the NCAA Championships. 
"The whole year we were inches away from a superb season," said Head Coach Joe Piane. "Consider Tim Brown and Tony Ragunas. They missed qualifying by just one one-hundreth of a second. Glenn Watson was just three one-hundreths of a second short of qualifying. And David Warth was just several tenths of a 
second short." 
But Piane has reason to be optimistic about the future. Of all the runners who ran at the IC4A's, only one is a senior. And the team is much more evenly balanced this year, a change from past seasons where the distance runners dominated. 
"We're a much better team than last year," said Piane. "We only had one senior at IC4A's, so the future is looking bright." 
The team has a two-week layoff ahead before moving outdoors. 

day but lost, 3-0. We didn't score any runs for him, but he threw as well as anybody I've seen as a freshman." 
The Irish fell behind early in the weekend's first game on Saturday as the Hoosiers took a 3-0 lead into the top of the eighth inning. Notre Dame's Steve Skupien and Pat Pesavento started a rally with a double and triple, respective­ly, and Dan Peltier, Chris Flynn and Scott Rogers punched consecutive singles to tie the score at 3-3. 
The Irish could not hold on to the lead, however, as Indiana scored the winning run in the bottom half of the inning to take a 4-3 victory. 
Both games of Sunday's doubleheader featured pitch­ing duels, but again the Hoosiers came out with the wins. Notre Dame's Kevin Chenail and Indiana's Scott Zimmerman both turned in complete games, yielding only five hits each. The game was tied 1-1 in the top of the seventh

The second game of the doubleheader was another bat­quieted Irish bats and sealed a 3-0 shutout for his team. 
"The first three games of the season were very good games," said Gallo, noting the closeness of the contests. "Both teams were fairly even as far as hitting and pitching. They happened to get a few more runs than we did." 
Indiana registered only two 
more hits than Notre Dame in 
the three games combined, 
holding a 21-19 edge. 
"We lost a lot of ballgames like this last year," added Gal­lo. "It kind of dwells on the returnees but we're going to be involved in a lot more of those games and we're going to win some. 
"We've got to go down south now and play some teams that have probably played 15 or 20 games already. That's just a fact of baseball that when you go down south the teams will have a jump on you. But in no way should that ever be used as an excuse." 
The Irish begin their annual spring trip with a doubleheader on Saturday with Screiner Col­lege. They will also face St. Ed­ward's, Southwest Texas State, Incarnate Word, Baylor and St. Mary's. Baylor has moved into the Top 20 in recent weeks and will be the toughest challenge in the already difficult eight­day, 10-game trip. 
"It'll be an interesting trip," said Gallo. "We've got to get something going. We're 0-3 so we have no place else to go but up. We're gonna win some bal­lgames and surprise some people. We play a darn good schedule so the kids have to be ready to play every time out. 
"The other team hears those two words, Notre Dame, and they think they're playing the football and basketball teams as well. It's a big game on the schedule of everyone we play." 
The three losses are on the books to stay for the Notre Dame baseball team, but that certainly isn't getting Gallo down. 
"Those three losses are over and done with," said Gallo. "Baseball is a great game be­cause you have to come out to the ballpark with a smile on your face because tomorrow is another day. 
"I'd walk to Texas right now if it meant we could play to­morrow, and I think I'd have 25 guys with me."

Robinson is chosen unanimously > in 86-87 AP All-America selections 
NEW YORK -David Robin­son, the 7-foot-1 center who has been responsible for Navy's sudden success over the past three seasons, is the only unan­imous selection on the 1986-87 Associated Press college bas­ketball All-America team an­nounced Monday. 
Also chosen to the first team were Steve Alford of Indiana, the only repeater; Kenny Smith of North Carolina, Reggie Williams of Geor­getown and Danny Manning of Kansas, a junior and the only underclassman. 
The team was chosen by a 10-member AP panel of sports writers. 
Robinson, an outstanding shooter, rebounder and shot­blocker, led the Midshipmen to the Colonial Athletic Confer­ence title three straight years and into the NCAA playoffs each year. Last year Navy made it into the NCAA final eight, showcasing Robinson, and this season carry a 26-5 record into the tournament. 
Robinson, who averged 59 percent from the field, averaged 27.5 points, 11.8 rebounds and blocked 142 shots, the best in the nation, this season. He is the only player in NCAA history to score 2,500 points, grab 1,300 rebounds and shoot 60 percent from the field during his career. 
In four seasons, he has scored 2,619 points, 1,301 rebounds and compiled a 64 percent field-goal percentage. 
"I'm the only one who can stop me from scoring," Robin­son said this season. 
Alford, a four-year starter, is

third-ranked Indiana's all-time scoring leader with 2,300 points. A member of the gold­medal 1984 Olympic team, he led the Hoosiers to a 24-4 record and a share of the Big Ten Con­ference title this year, making 86 three-point goals (51 per­cent) while averaging 21.8 points. 
Overall, the 6-2 guard made 49 percent of his field-goal at­tempts and 89 percent ot his free throws. 
The 6-3 Smith, another four­year starter, used his quick­ness to lead North Carolina in scoring with a 16.9 average, run the offense and play a key de­fensive role. 
Smith made 51 percent of his field-goal tries, including 75 three-pointers for 41 percent from long range. He led the team in assists (5.7) and tied backcourt partner Jeff Lebo for the team lead in steals with 45. 
Georgetown Coach John 
Thompson calls his fourth-ranked team "Reggie and the Little Miracles." He adds, "Without Reggie, there would be no miracles." 
The 6-7 Williams, only senior on the squad, carried the offen­sive load in leading Geor­getown, 26-4, to a share of the Big East Conference's regular season championship and to the postseason title .. 
The Big East scormg cham­pion led the Hoyas in scoring (23.3), rebounding (8.7) field goal percentage (49 percent), foul shooting percentage (79 percent) and three-point goals (67). He also holds the Hoyas' single-season scoring mark. 
Manning, a versatile per­former who played forward, center and guard, led the 20th­ranked Jayhawks, 23-10, in scoring (23.7) rebounding (9.7) and field goal percentage (62 percent). In the Big Eight tournament he scored a record 79 points in three games and was named the most valuable player although Kansas lost in the final. 



UNLV hangs on to top slot in poll; Irish ride recent win streak to 18th 
Associated Press 
Once-beaten Nevada-Las Vegas, the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament's West Regional of the NCAA tourna­ment, was the unamimous choice Monday as the nation's top college basketball team in the final Associated Press poll. 
"We're extremely pleased that we've had the ranking most of the season," Head Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "I think the kids deserved it be­cause they played super bas­ketball in Los Angeles last week." They won the Pacific Coast Athletic Association tournament with victories by 35, 34 and 24 points. 
"We know the rankings won't mean that much when the regionals begin because that's where we've got to prove our­selves all over again." 
The Runnin' Rebels, who used the 3-point goal to their advantage all season, meet Idaho State in the first round of the NCAA tournament Thursday at Salt Lake City. 
"If the ball bounces right for us, I feel we have a chance this year," Tarkanian said. " we play real good defense. Our in­tensity and our defense have just been super. If we shoot well, we'll be OK." 
UNLV rebels, 33-1, received all 65 first-place ballots and 1,300 points from the nation­wide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. During the season, they were ranked No.1

in the first round of the NCAA Tournament Thursday after­noon. 
The Irish coaching staff has a large volume of tapes of teams from around the country, but the Blue Raiders are not one of them. The Raiders, who play in the Ohio Valley Conference, did not receive much television expo­sure, and consequently Phelps and his staff had no video to watch in order to disect the Blue Raiders style of play. 
If this situation sounds familiar, it's because the Irish staff had no tape of Arkansas­Little Rock heading into last year's NCAA Tournament. 
"There's nothing much to say about Middle Tennessee," said Phelps at a press confer­ence at noon Monday. "We don't have any tapes. This is two years in a row that we haven't had tapes of the first opponent. I've got stats which show five players in double­figures, but that doesn't help me. I want to see them play and how they go the 86 points." 
By later that afternoon, Phelps and his staff had managed to find tapes of the Blue Raiders from December, but still were trying to locate more recent video. All this made preparation difficult at best. ' 
"We have to leave (Tuesday) night because our practice time is at one in Charlotte," said Phelps. "All we've got to do now is go over our stuff with­out knowing what to expect or what to see or what to do. That's one thing I don't like to do because I've been able to prepare this team for every game. As I look at it right now, there's nothing to do.

The Blue Raiders floor leader is 6-4 senior guard Duane Washington. Washing­ton has dished out 248 assists this season while scoring 10.4 points per game himself.

IRISH ITEMS -The annual basketball awards banquet was held Monday evening. Senior captain Donald Royal won six awards including the co-MVP from the Notre Dame Monogram Club, Rebounding Award (along with junior Gary Voce), Best Defensive Player, Most Accurate Shooter and the Captain's Award with Scott Hicks, who also won the Most Inspirational Player Award. 
The co-MVP along with Royal was junior guard David Rivers. Rivers also received the Assist Leader Award, a 1,000-point club plaque and the Father Tom Brennan Award for free-throw shooting. 

Voce won the Most Improved Player Award, while Mark Stevenson won the Offensive Efficiency Award. Sean Con­nor won the Notre Dame Club of St. Joseph Valley Student Athlete Award.
