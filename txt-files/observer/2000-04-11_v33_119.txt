Hesburgh to receive Hold Cross degree 
By SARAH RYKOWSKI 
SJint 'Aary·s News Lditor 
Father Theodore Hesburgh has received more honorary degrees than anvone in the world, with a total or"141. To receive his next honorary degree, how­ever, he won't need to travel far from home. 
He sb u.r g h, Notre Dame president emeritus. will receive the first honorarv degree award·­ecl by Holy Cross College, as well as address the Class of 2000 at Holv Cross College's 33rd-annuaf com­mencement ceremonv. 
"The college has ·been in the process of researching the expe­riences and traditions of other two-year colleges regarding the granting of honorary degrees," said Beverly Bradley, director of the Office of Community Relations at Holy Cross College. "The Board of Trustees decided it was appro-priate for us at this time." 


Ilesburgh was chosen by the administration and IJoard of Trusters to receive this du al honor because of his past service to Holy Cruss. Hesburgh was pre­sPnt at the founding of Iloly Cross and was a friend of Brother John Driscoll, the first Holy Cross pres­ident. Tlesburgh also aided Holy Cross as it sought to obtain the recognition and credit standing necessary for its survival. 
"I am grateful for the support and encouragement I have felt personally from Father Hesburgh over the years -not only as a president, but as a fellow C.S.C. member," said Brother Richard Gilman, president of Holy Cross. 
Hesburgh, who was president of '.'lotre Dame for 35 years, will be granted a Doctor of Humane Letter. 
Hesburgh has served under four popes and been awarded 15 presidential appointments. Hesburgh is also a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor for his lifetime commitment to public service. 
Hesburgh is a founding member of the first private foundation allowed to organize in Russia, the Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity. His longstanding interests in peace and d1welopment issues are reflected in his principal involve­ment with two Notre Dame insti­tutes, the .loan 13. Kroc Institutle for International Peace Studies and the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies. Ile is a board member of the U.S. Institute for Peace. 
Hesburgh has also just complet­ed six years of service on the Harvard University Board of Overseers, the last two as presi­dent of the organization. 
As for the future of the hon­orary degree at Holy Cross College, Hesburgh's award may not become commonplace, but on it is not entirely out of the ques­tion for other honorary degrees being granted in the future. 
"Although it may not be an annual tradition, Holy Cross College may choose to offer this honor to others of this caliber in the future, as the occasion aris­es," Bradley said. 
Commencement exercises at Holy Cross College take place on May 13, in Saint Joseph Chapel, on campus. 

ACE offers opportunity to give back, earn master's 

By NICOLE HADDAD 
News Writer 
As many seniors anxiously pre­pare to leave for new careers after graduation, Ann Pangilinan and Cameron Gunville will be leaving the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame communities only to return nine days later. They are among 80 students who have been admitted into the ACE (Alliance for Catholic Education) program. 
Based on three pillars -pro­fossiona I teaching, rommunity liv­ing and spirituality -ACE is a two-year service program where Notre Dame and Saint Mary's graduates serve as teachers in southern Catholic schools without adequate resources. 
Throughout the two-year com­mitment, ACE teachers pursue a master of education at Notre name through eight-week sum­mer sessions at the University. 
"ACE participants embody Christ's person and learhings, both to the students they serve and the peers with whom they live in intentional Christian com­munities," said Mary Jo Adams, associate director of ACE. 
Adams explained that the heme­fits are long-tasting and abundant for both parties. 
"First and foremost, ACE teach­ers are able to give their own tal­ents and blessings to as many of our applicants desire. For two years of servic<', an ACE teacher participates fully in the role of an educator, counselor, friend, men­tor, doctor, coach and community member," she said. 
ACE teachers receive a fully­funded master's degree and are eligible to become certified teach­ers in Indiana. Additionally, ACE participants receive an annual education award from the Corporation for National Service to repay federal loans or to finance future graduate study. 
Next year, Pangilinan will teach high school seniors chemistry and religion in Montgomery, Ala. 
"At the beginning of my senior year, I koew I really wanted to teach," said Pangilinan, "but I had not completed the education pro­gram. The ACE program, howev­er, would provide me with teach­ing experience and I would get to live in a different environment with different people." 
"I was initially planning on going to medical school. I was working towards the MCAT at the end of my junior year and was offered an intr.rnship in the sum­mer to do research," said Pangilinan, "but something didn't foe! right." 
Pangilinan explained how her experience as a teaching a.._<;sistant helped her to realize her passion for working with students. 
"As a chemistry TA, I was devising and teaching labs. I r.njoyerf seeing thn students' faces and I·could relate chemistry to

The right to choose facts 

We live in an ever-inr.reasing "cost-benefit" age. to use business jargon, one that places a premium our "needs." Individuals weigh the morality ofan act based on its effect on our cherished lives. This Sf'lfish line of thinking has given rise to many of the premises of the pro-choicA side of the abortion debate. 
Onre we examine abortion statistics, we realize that tl1e ra~/inccst argument is not proportionally valid to sup­port the entire industry, and pro-choicers are left \\ith the realization that they must support what amount to thou­sands ofconvenience abor­tions. Jn other words, ifit is not convenient for me to raise a child, J have a right to an abortion. Or, to romanticize this logic, I am sparing this unborn child a life with me, aparently un~illing to change my lifesl.yle. 
The brushstrokes can paint the issue in so many broad colors, but they create the same picture. Oops! 1don't feel like having a child; I can't support it; I have a ri){ht and an obligation to l.errninate il at once. This is amoral selfishness at its best; or rather. at it's worst. There is a good reasou ror the continuation of thi> abortion debate. other than the failure to correlate sexual activity with pregnancy. And you thought Al Gore was naive. When logic and personal responsibility evade the pro-choice movement, it happily crawls to the nurturing shel­ter ofits closest ally, anecdotal evidence. 
What is this evidence that justifies terminating a pregnancy? It often consists of horror stories of broken homes and neglected children. At best, this rhetoric gives a license to kill to the poor and dys­functional. I'm glad my parents didn't "spare me from a life of hardship," otherwise I might have aspired to nothing more than a footnote from a Saturday night of Bee Gees and wine spritzers. "Geez, we had a close call back in '78, but luckily we had access to plenty of Planned Parenthood pamphlets." 
This logic leads to plenty of presumptions, none of which include the notion that a life is being ter­minated. First, we must assume that all children born into economic hardship or other rough situa­tions have no ability to better themselves in life. Second, we have to lend support to the argument that it's "immoral" to bring children into these unwanted situations, a veritable "Get out ofpar­enthood free" card for the poor and horny. 
½'hat business does a person have in going through the motions if they cannot possibly fathom a pregnancy? This isn't out of touch -this is reali­ty. Otherwise, what prohibits me from murdering my toddler to "spare them a harsh life"? 
Pro-choicers are correct when they assert that women have a choice in whether or not to have a child; they just don't understand when the decision should be made. I suggest the bedroom, for starters. So the argument evolves into a deter­mined struggle for a "woman's right," and it would certainly make the utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill proud. My right to terminate the preg­nancy is paramount; the fetus has no rights; they are at best secondary to my rights. This idea is prevalent in our culture. And so a very large, vocal portion of American society continues to support a second-rate medical practice using third-rate logic.

Purdue hunger strike ends in compromise 
After 11 days of a hunger strike by five campus activists, Purdue l.iniversity agreed to join the Worker's Rights Consortium by the end of September if provisioned cri­teria are met. 
ThB WRC is a fledgling agency that monitors factories abroad that pro­duce collegiate merchandise. The organization works to ensure that official apµarel is not made in sv,eat­shop conditions. 
Purdue Students Against Sweatshops, one of many such activist groups on colleg<' campuses nationwide, reached a settlement with the administration about midnight Thursday. The compromise was ham­mered out after a marathon negotia­tion session with Joe Bennett. vice president of Purdue University rela­tions. 
The hunger strike, initiated by six

commitment that we wanted. 
Obviously, no one wants Purdue

Bennett said, while the administra­

"We had a lot of issues to resolve 
bBcause of Purdue's concerns about 
tlie WRC and the students concerns 
about the University's intentions," he 
said. "In Urn rasc of the WRC, Purdue's concerns are the lack of information about the organization's operating methods, its source of sup­port and its future goals." 
The eight provisions put down by Purdue University include guaranteed exemption from legal liability and a review of its accounting.

James Madison student arrested for abandoning infant 
HARRISONBURG, Va. 

A James Madison University nusing student was arrested Friday in Harrisonburg after she allegedly left her now deceased newborn in a portable toilet at a rural Delaware construction site. Freshman Abigail Caliboso, 19, of Woodbridge, is being charged as a fugitive by the Harrisonburg Police Department, and with manslaugh­ter and second-degree conspiracy by Delaware State Police. Also charged was Chantilly resident Jose Ocampo, 18, Caliboso's boyfriend and alleged father of the baby, Delaware State Police said. According to Delaware Police spokesman Cpl. Walt(w Newton. Caliboso and Ocampo rented a motel room in Fairfax County on \'larch 26, where Caliboso allegedly gave birth to a baby. Later that day, the couple reportBdly drove north on Interstate 95 to Delaware.

COB students defy trends, stay in school 
. Web companies lure students away from college 
By STACEY KAPLAN News Writer 
Troy Murphy may not be the only Domer turning down mil­lions in order to stay a few more years in the land of the Irish. 
A recent trend has shmvn stu­dents, both at the MBA and undergraduate levels, dropping out of school to pursue fame and wealth on the wavo of the lnterrncit revolution. l\cc:ording to a recent joint issue by Newsweek and Kaplan, the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania lost 25 of its 765 students dur­ing the 1 ()98-99 school year. .Business school applications are down, as dot-com start up com­panies snap up some of the nation's best and brightest. 
"Everyone's going to have to get a lot more creative, not only in recruiting students, but in retaining thPm," said Cheryl Crowe!, assistant director at the Doermer Family :\IIBA Career Development Center. 
Against all odds, Notre Dame has seen an opposite trend. Business school applications soared 32

Matta continued. "What people pay for in the end is the ability to execute on the business plans that you have. People want to look at the skill and the educa­tion level that you have." 
"The Notre Dame stud,mt is very entrepreneurial," said James Davis, director of the Gigot Center for entrepreneurial studies. "Ile doesn't want to be thP passengPr on the ship; he wanl'i to be the captain. We are very conscious of the trends. I taught an MRA 1mtrepreneur­ship class last semester and I would say that two thirds of the business plans wnro for dot-corn companies. Jt"s been a struggle to keep them in house. It's easi­er than ever before to get fund­ing." 
Although most Irish entreprn­neurs have elected to stay, there are a few who have vP.ntured out from under the Golden Dome. Three Ph.D. candidates left last year to start a company called Nuron. 
"We remain in contact, and they're doing great. They make enhanced video graphic cards. Intel and Micron are interested and it's created a heck ofa lot of excitement, " said Davis. 
Davis, however, does not advocate this path for everyone. "It's such a personal 
ever been. We have a fabulous retention rate (99 percent)," said Brian Lohr, the MBA program's assis­tant director of admission. 
Much of the reason for the positive numbers lies in a recent push towards entrepreneurial and e-commerce studies. The MBA program recently expand­ed to include tracks in e-com­merce, e-consulting and e­entrepreneurship. 
"There is a lot of hype sur­rom1ding the Internet," director of MIS programs Khalil Matta said. "People fail to recognize that for every venture that suc­ceeds, nine others fail. Here stu­dents can use our expertise as faculty. It increases the proba­bility for success." 
"Almost everyone has a good idea. Ideas are a din1e a dozen," 
denl'i have a greater probability of success." 
To improve even more on this probability, the Gigot Center is planning to launch a program next fall called Irish Angels. The program would use the exten­sive Irish alumni network to put entrepreneurial students in con­tact with funding opportunities. 
"Our primary goal is to launch Irish Angels next fall. There has been a lot of' interest in it and we are really excited about the work," said Theresa Sedlack, program manager at the Gigot Center. 
The Gigot Center hopes to be able to provide students with not only faculty resources, but also funding and mentors for their particular projects. 
"We're matchmakers," Davis said.

Cassidy, director of the Student Activities Oflice. The survey generated 1,136 student n~sponses beyond the randomly sam­

were for uses which included eating, individual or group studying, socializing with friends and computer availability." said 1999-2000 Student L'nion secretary Luciana Reali, who chaired the social space subcommittee. 
Larortune rated very poorly as a recreational and entertainment facility, Reali said. Of the 1,136 free respon­dents 1,018 said they would not consid­er the current student center to be an entertainment venue for a weekend night. Students suggested the addition of a movie theater, a bowling alley, a nightclub or more large screen televi­sions as possible remedies to this con­cern. 
Students did, however, give LaForiunc some favorable ratings. Most considered the center's food service operations "good or fair," according to Reali. The most frequented areas inside the build­ing are in the Huddle Mart and the basement. 
But the majority of the 1,136 free respondents did agree that there should be more fast food restaurants in Lafortune, Reali said. Manv also rec­ommended a restaurant with table ser­vice. 
Reali said most students favored LaFortunc ·s current location but feel 
that the best solution to LaForlune's inadequacy is to erect a new stud1mt center or to make large scale renova­tions to the current center. 
"Many of the prohlems that were illustrated by the survey, such as the lack of adequate recreational space and the need for more 24-hour space, are self-evident on this campus," said Reali. "Howtwcr, the overwhelming student response we recci\'ed served to high­light the urgency of these problems and the necessity for student leaders to work with the administration to solve them." 
But Heal.i cautioned that although the administration has been receptive to student opinion in this matter, "we may not see major renovations to I.aPortunc or construclion ol' a new student center for the next fow vears." 
She also said ·that this represents the first time that Notre Dame students have heen consulted on a construction initiative. 
The issue of campus social space l'irst surfaced two to thrPc years ago, l'ollow­in g a University self study, Cassidy explained. He said these self-studies arc designed to effectively expose and address current cqncerns on the cam­pus. University self-studies are ccmduct­ed every 10 years.

students," she said. 
Pangilinan didn't feel as though her Saint Marv's status was a dis­advantage fo; her acceptance in ACE. 
"I don't know if this is a rumor or fact, but I know it is a huge pri\i­lege and a great honor," she said. 
"Going into the interview, the people were warm and inviting. 1 was viewed as a person, not just as a Saint Mary's student," Pangilinan said. 
According to Pangilinan, the aspect of her application that helped her most was her teaching experience and her sense of being well-rounded. 
"l worked with non-majors, tutored many students, and was a TA in a lecture setting," she said. "ACE is a rigorous program in a foreign setting and looks for stu­dents that can adapt well," she said. "My flexibility helped." 
Additionally Pangilinan's firm religious convictions will help her succeed with ACE. 
"My spirituality and deeply rooted faith will allow me to contributo to this progrnrn," P angili11an said. 

Gunville will be returning to Notre Dame this summer to attend education classes before leaving for Baton Houge, La. to teach high school science and religion. 
''The big thing was th1) service opportunity and being able to inllu­cnce the lives of kids," Gunville said. 
Like Pangilinan, Gunville was planning on attending medical school after graduation. But. he dis­covered that medical school and teaching are quite similar. 
"Both doctors and professors have a sole goal of bettering the lives of other people," said Gunvillc. "A masters in education can only help you down the road when you're working with other patients," he said. 
Gunville also feels that faith is an important aspect of the ACE pro­gram. 
"As a person, I feel this is a big challenge," Gun ville said, "I will grow as a person as well as spiritu­ally." 
"It's really exciting to try and tackle something new and to be able to sham my faith with other people at the same time," Gunville said.

While Cassidy was iuvolvnd in facili­tating research on tho social space situ­ation. he said that the Student Activities Office will not be using the findings to implement campus changes. That job, he said, will be left to the Office of Student Affairs. 
"It's sort of a 'now that we have the results, what do we do?' situation," Cassidy said. "Student Affairs has all the information from the surveys, the focus groups and the hirnd consultants. It's up to that onice to do or not do any­thing with the results." 
No representative from Student Affairs was available for comment.

"This  is

"She would be a star of tlw quality that has not hecn seen in the Sonato since Bobby Kennedy was (Jl1!ctml sonator from tht; statP of New York. 
"Many of us believe that in a sc(rnario if IVice !'resident All Gore lost and she is elected to tho Spnatn, she'd be running for the presid1rnt of' the United States," McCain said. 

Clinton has said that if eloctecl she will serve her full six-year term and that sh1i is not int.nr­estcd in Lhe presidency. 
J\sk(id to clarify his remarks about Clinton, Mc Cai 11 said. "I bnlievo shn'd be vory lilrnra.l

In your view and others, he probably has not do11n well nnough IH1cause I havn heard similar comments to yours. But I hopo hn will in tho fut.urn rnpair that situation.'" 
But McCain also crPdited Giuliani with turning tlw city around. "When I canw to tlw city 10 years ago I couldn't. walk in tlw street," Im said. "I couldn't go into Central Park. I couldn't oven rid!) in a cab without foar of sonrnbody jrrk­ing op0.n tlw door and yanking mn out.."

KUWAIT 

Six traditionalists attack wolllan 
. Student whipped for not wearing scarf 
Associated I'ress 

KUWAIT 
Authorities said Monday they have arrest­ed six Muslim tradil.ional­ists suspected of attack­ing a woman last week, reportedly because she did not abide by Islam's strict dress code. 
The Interior Ministry distributed photos of the bearded men, ages 21 to 35, with a statement say­ing a seventh suspect was still at large. 
A ministry spokesman declined to provide details of the Wednesday attack before the investi­gation is complete. 
Newspaper reports said the 19-ycar old Kuwaiti student was walking to her car in a college park­ing lot when three men approached and asked her why she did not cover her hair with a scarf. 
When she told them it was none of their busi­ness, they whipped her on the back with an elec­trical wire, cut her hair and took away her cellu­lar phone before nccing, the reports said. 
Most Kuwaiti women wear long clothes and cover their hair, but Islamic dress is not man­e.lated by law and is not imposed on forr,igrrnrs. 
The Interior Ministry said the suspects have not only insulted the girl and her family, but also the whole community that "rejects this kind of behavior." 
The statement said investigations were under way, along with other similar attacks that apparently were not reported to the police. 
Kuwait's traditionalists, who arc represented by some 20 lawmakers in the 50-seat Parliament, want to fully implement Islamic law, or Sharia, in this oil-rich state. Their influence has grown, especially among the young, since the end of the 1991 Gulf War that liberated Kuwait from a seven-month Iraqi occu­pation. 
Several leaders denied any connection to the attack. The Cabinet has asked the National Security Agency to "study all aspects of the issue" and recommend ways to prevent it from happen­ing again.

Keeping the faith in law school 
U.S. News has dropped Notre Oame Law School from 21st to 26th. So what? 
There are more important measures of a law school. For example, Notre Dame has earned preeminence for decades as a law school which encourages students to integrate the study of law with morality and faith. And now vindication of that effort can be seen in the emer­gence of three new Catholic law schools, two with a Notre Dame connec­tion. Imitation is the sincerest form of l1attery. 
Barry University took over Orlando School of Law and held its first graduation this past January. 
The University of St. Thomas will open a law school in St. Paul, Minn., in August 2001. The founding dean is David Link, who retired in 1999 after 24 years as dean of Notre Dame Law School. 
Ave Maria School ol'Law, which will open in Ann Arbor this August, is practi­cally a Notre Dame outreach. Dean Bernard Dobranski is a Notre Dame grad who taught at Notre Dame from 1977 to 1983. Five of the founding faculty am grads of l'\otre Dame Law School. Professor Gerard Bradley and I arn on the Board of Governors. 
The new schools make sense in light of the failure of most of the 24 existing Catholic law schools to offer an cnective response to the secular American legal culture. In 1978, Dean Roger Cramton described "the ordinary religion of the law school classroom," as "a moral rela­tivism tending toward nihilism. a prag­matism tending toward an amoral instru­mentalism, a realism tending toward cynicism. an individualism tending toward atomism and a faith in reason and democratic processes tending toward mere credulity and idolatry." 

Over the past two decades the situation has worsened. A utilitarian positivism recognizes no moral limits on what the law can do. The implicit dogma of American legal education is that reason is incapable of knowing objective moral norms. Affirmations of objective morality and especially of God are considered nonrational and irrelevant to academic discussion. 
The patron saint of this denial of the intellect is Oliver Wendell Holmes who wrote, "I wonder if cosmically an idea is any more important than the bowels." Ilolmes defined truth as "the majority vote of the nation that could lick all oth­ers. I see no reason," he wrote, "for attributing to man a significance diner­ent in kind from that which b1\]ongs to a baboon or a grain of sand." 
Notre Dame Law School, of course, offers a different view. Notre Dame. how­evnr. has room for only a relative fi,w of those who want a legal education which integrates morality and law in light of the Catl-iolic tradition. The new schools can rill that need. 
"What does Ave Maria mean for Notre Dame?" asked Dean Link. "I can think of nothing but good. The attPntion being paid to the opening of Ave Maria will help all religiously based law sr,hools (including ours) to maintain their ... mis­sion. We don't all need to do this in the same way, but each of us needs to remain true to ... fundamental principles including (in tlrn case of Catholic law schools) the natural law. Tho presence of former and current NDLS !'acuity mem­bers in leadership roles at other law schools will help expand the inllmmce of' our different kind oflaw school ... The competition and the interaction or faculty and deans will make all n)ligiously ori­ented law schools stronger." 
As Ave Maria Dean Dobranski put it, the new schools ''arc not competitors with each other or with other Catholic law schools. The more of us who are try­ing to offer an education that integrates law and morality, the better." 
Judge Robert Bork, an Ave Maria fac­ulty member, said its founding "is a great thing for legal education in general." Ave Maria, he said, "will be more like the law schools of 30 years ago, before they became so highly politicized." 
Supreme Court Justice Clarnnce Thomas, who delivered the school's first Ave Maria Lecture last November, said the school is "trying to bring back what's lost. That's very important." 
In keeping with its motto, Fides et Hatio, Ave Maria will integrate the law with faith and reason. Ave Maria fully accepts Ex Corde Ecclesiac, the Apostolic Constitution on Catholic universities. Its curriculum will focus on the "nuts and bolts" of the law. 
But it will move to a new and higher levPI that no other law school even attempts. It will combine open1rnss to free inquiry with a systematic study each year of the moral and social teachings of the Church as they relate to law and poli­cy. Ave Maria aims to produce warriors, not bystanders, in the cultural war. 
The answer to the "culture of death" lies in the moral and social teachings of' the Catholic Church. America needs lawyers who are technically competent, who arc solidly formed in those teachings and who live their faith in Christ. Notre Danrn Law School continues to serve the nation uniqunly and well in encouraging its students to Jill that rn1ed. 
And the idea is catching on. Maybe somebody will tell the editors of U.S. News about it.

Men's silence concerning rape is condoning 
Choice for Elian is easy, obvious 
It is tragic that 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez has become the pawn of the walously anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Florida. The psychological impact of making this young boy a celebrity is but one negative effect being perpetu­ated by the anti-Castro zealots. Elian's Miami relatives have even suggest­ed that Castro will eJ<ecute the child if he returns to Cuba. 
In preparation for civil disobedience, the fever pitch has afTrctod tlrn mayor of Miami-Dade County who initially opµosnd Fndera.1 intervention by threatening to prrvent local police from supporting Federal mar­shals. 
I cannot think of a b(!tter description for the anti­Castro exiles' antics than to use a phrase telPvision's Judge Judy often employs to summarize a series of actions in her C()Urtr()om. Judge .Judy regularly char­acterizPs bizarrl' conduct such as that which is c-ur­rnntly on display in Miami as, "Stupid, stupid, stupid!" 
Stupid #l: The U.S. relatives of young Elian are wrong in their actions and thinking. 
First, rather than plarc the boy in a foster home, the government temporarily put the boy in a home with relatives. That temporary custody does not auto­matically give those relatives the right to keep the boy, nor docs the custody validate the family's cre­dentials for permanent care. Their insistence that they will not hand over the child to his father is part of an appalling internal family feud. 
Stupid #2: 
Anti-Castro exiles arn so hateful and defiant, they employ any means, including disrngard· of U.S. law and the exploitation of a innocent 6-year­old boy, to demean and overthrow Fidel Castro. While freeing Cuba through the downfall of Castro is an admirable goal, using hate to blind one's common sense and family decency is not healthy. 
For the mayor of Miami-Dade County to join the family's resistance and defiantly oppose the Attorney General, like George Wallace did when he stood in the Alabama schoolhouse door, panders to mob mentality. The mayor's actions also violate his oath to uphold the laws of the United States and invalidate the rule of law. It is that principle that is the strength of the American system and supposedly the reason the family wants the child to remain in the U.S. in the first place. 
Stupid #3: 
The harsh stand by the Miami-area exiles has actuall:y strengthened their Communist opponents. The exiles' actions have reinvigorated Castro and his supporters in Cuba. The hot-headed confrontation and hard-line resistance by Cuban exiles has rallied Communists in Cuba like no other issue in decades. 
Young Cubans identffy with their brother Elian who is being held from his father and sec this as a fight against the oppressive, giant United States. 
Their greatest joy, hollow though we consider it, will be when young Elian lands back on his native soil. 
!\nd young Elian will eventually land on his native Cuban soil. All law ­family. immigration, juvenile -sides with the father's rights. The boy is too young to know what he really wants, so he cannot make a judgment to ask for asylum. Every parent wants custody of the children when a spouse dies. Courts ran only prevent that scenario when abuse or neglect can be determined. 
If one were to use the Miami family members' logic that this country is prosp11rous, frne, and life here is in the best interest for the boy, then our immigration laws would be unfair and void. The U.S. returns illegal Cuban refugees -which Elian is -who do not reach land unless the aliens can show that they qualify for political asylum. If the U.S. was to alter its laws to keep Elian, we would have totally open borders and quickly be overrun by Cubans as well as other refugees from most of the Third World. 
Further following the flawed logic of the Gonzalez family in Miami, it wuuld be our government's obligation to infiltrate American-based hate groups, cults, militia groups and other "harmful" organizations and rnmove those children from their parents. The question becomes, what should our government consider when assessing the quality of life for Elian or American children'? 
Should it consider the politics, the living ronditions, the opportunitif's or the abundance of wealth? Why should Elian be given special consideration just because Fidel Castro is a Communist who is hated by a large commu­nity in Miami? Are Neo-Nazis living within our U.S. borders not as harmful to their children? 
The tragedy !'or the Cuban exiles is that they are using Castro-like tactics lo "save" Elian. To them, the boy must remain free in the U.S. regardless of the law. They arc running in a circle as long as they arc consumed by their hate. Granted, most of them are currently without a homeland. Someday Castro will no longer rule lhc island, and maybe these exiles can return home. Maybe many of them will opt to remain in the United States or bring their remaining family members from Cuba. But that day has yet to arrive, and Uiey am not the dictators of young Elia.n's fate.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

1would like to take this opportunity to commend all the women on this campus and at Saint Mary's who have taken a stand and chosen to speak out. against the horror that is rape. At the same time I would like to call upon all the men on this campus to also take a stand. This silence coming from the male portion of this community is reprehen­sible. While not all men are rapists, 98 per­cent of all perpetrated rapes are committed by men. 
These women that are violated are some­one's daughter or maybe someone's girl­friend ... or maybe someone's sister. Notre Dame men, we have it within our power to condemn rape on this campus, to weed out those among us who think that if she says,

According to Christ, the Old Testament law was created to govern our actions before we had faith. After accepting Jesus, we became sons of God by faith (Galatians 3:26). 
We gained our own faith through the Bible and the teachings of Jesus that allowPd us to abandon Old Testament law.

"No!" she's playing hard to get or those 
among us who justify rape by saying, "We 
were drunk." 
There is nothing more disturbing or more disgusting than rape, especially on a cam­pus founded upon and dedicated to the teachings of our Lord and Savior, .Jesus Christ. It is not enough to simply shake our heads in disgust at reports of rape, you must shout it from the rooftops, "RAPE IS WRONG!" 
Who is worse, the man who rapes or the man who condones it with his silence? 
Christopher Reyes Senior, Off-campus April 9, 2000 
This faith compels us to forgive those who have wronged us. Jesus himself forgave criminals (Luke 23:43), an adulteress (John 
8:11) and even a tax collector. Jesus himself 
forgives His executioners and does not call upon His apostles to avenge His 
that Jesus taught us ,would mean nothing. Currently our legal system is based on revenge not justice. There is no mercy in tho killing of an individual created in the image of God by another human being. There is no forgiveness of the accused in stato-sanctionod murder. Thero is no justice in capital punishment.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Cincinnat's Griffey hits No. 400 in losing effort 
Associated P r~ss 
Ken Griffey Jr. became the youngest player to hit 400 career homers, but the Colorado Rockies beat the Cincinnati Reds 7-5 in their home opener behind two-run homers from Mike Lansing and Todd Helton. 
ThP ne,.v-look Rockies, with jusl 10 players remaining on the roster from last year's open­er. got six strong innings from Holan do Arrojo (1-0). who became the first Hockies starter to win this season. 
Griffey tied the game at 1 in the fourth with an opposite-fielrl homer off Arrojo. It was Criffey's second homer of the season and second in as many days . 

.. 
At :-HJ years, 141 days. Griffey beat the previous mark, set by Jimmie foxx. who was 30 years, 248 days old. Griffey is fifth on the career list among active players. trailing Mark McGwirc (525), Barry Bonds (447), Jose Canseco (431) an<l Cal Ripken Jr. (4031. 
Griffey's historic homer came on the 50th birthday of his father, Ken Griffey Sr. It was the fourth time he has homered on his father's birthday. 
Arrojo left after deflecting a double-play grounder with his pitching hand, a play that ended the sixth. X-rays were negative, leaving him with a bruise on the middle finger of his right hand. He allowed two runs and six hits. 
Colorado returned to Coors Field following a shakeup that saw new GM Dan O'Dowd over­haul the Blake Street Bombers, who hit home runs but failed to make the postseason since 1995. 
Brewers 4, Marlins 3 
Geoff Jenkins homered and Milwaukee's bullpen had anoth­er strong outing as the Brewers beat the Florida Marlins in County Stadium's second final opener. 
A crowd of 53,509 braved game-time temperatures in the 40s and biting winds to wel­come the new season in Milwaukee. The game was the 48th opener at ramshackle County Stadium, the Brewers' only home since 1971. 

Shiny new MillPr Park, rapidly approaching completion 100 feet behind the current field, will open in 2001, a year behind schedule following a crane acci­dent last July 14 that killed three iron workers. 
Jenkins' solo homer put Milwaukee ahead in the second, and the Brewers then capital­ized on wildness by Vladimir Nunez (0-1) in tho third. 
The right-hander loaded the bases by walking Henry Blanco, Marquis Grissom and Mark Loretta, and Jeromy Burnitz hit a two-run single under first baseman Kevin Millar's glove. Jenkins' sacrifice fly scored Loretta. 
Cubs 4, Braves 3 
Forget Tokyo, St. Louis and Cincinnati and a long tiring trip to start the season. The Chicago Cubs opened the home portion of tht1ir season with a dramatic win. 
Shane Andrews hil a game­tying three-run homer off Kerry Ligtenberg in the ninth inning and pinch-hitter Jeff Reed sin­gled in Damon Buford with the game-winner as the Cubs stunned the Atlanta Braves in their frosty Wrigley Field o.pen­er. 
Andrews, whose throwing error allowed the tying run tu score in Sunday's 8-7, 11-inning loss to Cincinnati, drove a 1-2 pitch from Ligtenberg into the left-field bleachers for his third homer of the season. 
Ligtenberg (0-1), the Braves' closer until John Rocker's sus­pension is over April 17, then allowed a single to Buford and was replaced by Luis Rivera. 
Joe Girardi sacrificed Buford to second and Reed slapped a single down the left-field line, sending the Cubs out of their dugout to celebrate. 
Mark Guthrie (1-1) who pitched the top of the ninth, got the victory in Don Baylor's debut as Cubs manager at Wrigley. 
Royals 6, Twins 5 
Johnny Damon homered lead­ing off the ninth inning, and the Kansas City Royals beat the Minnesota Twins after wasting a two-run lead in the top half. 
Jacque Jones tied it at 5 with a two-run homer off Ricky Bottalico (1-0), who relieved Dan Reichert starting the ninth. Corey Koskie was on base after hitting the 10th double of the game. 
Damon's home run off LaTroy Hawkins (0-1) was his first of the season. 
Jose Rosado allowed three runs and five hits in six innings, and Reichert struck out four in the next two innings. Minnesota starter Sean Bergman gave up four runs and 11 hits in 5 1-3 innings 
Damon doubled leading off the game and scored one out later on Carlos Beltran's infield out. 
Phillies 9, Mets 7 

Mike Lieherthal hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the fifth inning as the Philadelphia Phillies overcame a four-run deficit and beat the New York Mets in their home opener. 

With white towels swirling in Veterans Stadium, the Phillies got another terrible outing from starter Paul Byrd. 
The bigger news came from Clearwater, Fla., where ace Curt Schilling struck out nine in four scoreless innings of a rehab assignment. 
That was far better than both starters fared in this game. 
Byrd and Mets starter Bobby Jones both were chased in the fifth inning. 
Schilling continued his impressive comeback from shoulder surgery, allowing two hits and no walks in a Class-A game. 
He wants to come back now, but is scheduled for a return to the mound in late April or early May. 
Diamondbacks 8, Padres 4 
The San Diego Padres' home opener turned into an Arizona Diamondbacks' homerfest. 
Erubiel Durazo hit two home runs, including a three-run shot, and Jay Bell, Steve Finley and Kelly Stinnett also connect­ed to match the club record of five as the Diamondbacks spoiled San Diego's home debut with a win. 
Todd Stottlemyre {2-0) was hit on the right knee by Ryan Klesko's line drive in the first but stayed in the game, holding the Padres to three runs and seven hits in six innings. 
He also made -a nice defensive play in the sixth, catching Eric Owens' liner and doubling Ryan Klesko at first. 
Durazo had just two singles in 17 at-bats and no RBIs coming in. He went 3-for-4 with a walk, a career-high 4 RBIs and had his second two-homer game.

Celtics 99, Hawks 94 
Antoine Walker scored 26 of his 34 points in the second half. including a 3-pointcr with 25 seconds left to cap a game-end­ing 11-0 Roston rally, as the Celtics beat the Atlanta Hawks. 
The win snapped Boston's 10 game-losing skid. its longest since 1997. The Celtics' last vic­tory was March 18 against Dallas. 
Kenny Anderson was the only other Boston player in double figures, with 24 points. 
Jim Jackson paced the Hawks, losers of seven in a row, with 27 points and 10 rebounds. Atlanta hasn't won on the road since Feb. 25 at Seattle, a 12­game drought. 
Jackson's basket with 3:02 left gave the Hawks a 94-88 lead, but Atlanta didn't score again. 
Paul Pierce's three-point play cut it to 94-91 before !\nderson 's twisting layup sliced it to one with 1:47 left.

Timberwolves 102, 
Pistons 100 
The Minnesota Timberwolves lost their cool, their coach and their cushy lead, but recovered to defeat the Detroit Pistons on Kevin Garnett's buzzer-beater. 
Garnett, who scored 25 points, sank a 10-foot jumper at the horn, then ran around the court with his arms out like a little kid prntending he was an airplane. . 
Terrell Brandon added 16 points for Minnesota, which tied its franchise single-season record with its 26th victory at Target Center. 
Grant Hill scored 36 points and was 17-of-18 from the foul line, including the go-ahead free throws after Flip Saunders was ejected in the third quarter for clashing with the officiating crew. 
Hill. playing on a tender left ankle, dunked with 16 seconds left to pull the Pistons to 99-98. After Wally Szczerbiak hit one of two free throws a second later, Hill drove the lane to tie it at 100 with six seconds left. 
The Wolves called timeout at 

2.4 seconds, and Sam Mitchell inbounded the ball to Garnett, who was closely guarded by three players as he stepped into the lane and let loose a 10-foot floater that fluttered the net at the horn. 
Knicks 83, Pacers 81 
Patrick Ewing made a turn­around jumper with two sec­onds left after apparently redi­recting Larry Johnson's 3-point­er into the basket, leading the New York Knicks to a victory over the Indiana Pacers. 
On a night with all the ten­sion, drama and excitement of a playoff game, Ewing scored nine of the Knicks' final 12 points and appeared to have a hand -or at least a couple of his fingers -in the other three. 
Johnson was credited with a 3-pointer with 21.7 seconds left, although replays appeared to show Ewing getting a hand on the ball and directing it into the basket as it was heading for the rim_ The Pacers argued franti­cally but to no avail. 
Heggie Miller tied the game at 81-81 on two foul shots with 
15.7 seconds left. 
The Knicks then got the ball to Ewing in the low post, and he sank one of his trademark fade­a way shots from the baseline over the outstretched arm of Dale Davis. 
Bucks 104, Magic 87 
Ray Allen couldn't be guard­ed, Sam Cassell couldn't be silenced and the Milwaukee Bucks finally looked like a play­off team. 
Allen scored 33 points, and Cassell added 18 points and eight assists as the energized Bucks beat the Magic, moving Milwaukee one game behind Orlando for the Eastern Conference's final postseason berth. 
The ninth-place Bucks and eighth-place Magic both have five games left.

"I have a lwart where (';Verv­one in my family is withiu it. It's going to be a comfortablP feeling to know that I will have a chance to help all of them." 
His announcement was no surprise. 
Fizer's NBA stock rose throughout the season as he followed one big game with another in leading Iowa State to the Big 12 regular season and tournament champi­onships. The 6-foot-8, 265­pound forward is projected to be one of the top picks in the June 28 draft. 
"The timing's right." Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy said. "He's certainly a lottery 
pick." . . Fizer has not hired an agent and said he was leaving open the possibility of returning to Iowa State next s0ason if he felt that would improve his position in the draft. Eustachy was not counting on that happening. "lle's not coming back," Eustachy saiu. "Ifs just hard for him to tell everybody this is it." Fizer averaged 22.8 points and 7. 7 rebounds and shot 58 prrcent from the field as Iowa State set a school record for victories in finishing 32-5. The

sairl. "I didn't think he'd ma,ke 
so much progress. But hn

such a force. 

"I thought the turning point in his sr11tson was when he struggled against Orake and we really, really challengnd him. Then he found out he could play right with Kenyon Martin i11 th,~ Cincinnati game. I think he just kept making progress from then on out." 
Fizer scored 2h points on 12-of-19 shooting in a 75-60 loss to Cincinnati on Nov. 28 in the championship game of the Big Island Invitational. Martin, the national player of the year, scored 22 points in that game and was the only player to receive morn votes for the All­Anrnrica team. 
"Se\fishlv, we'd love to have him back,1' Eustachy said. ''I'd look like a much better coach. But it's not the right thing to do. The right thing for him to do is move on. I'm behind him all the way." 
Fizer said he was grateful for Eustachy's support. The two shook hands and embraced as thev traded places on the p~dium at Monday's news conference. 
"I really didn't know what to Pxpect when l met with him when he and I had our talks," Fizer said. "When he told me he was encouraging me to go for the draft, that he thinks the time is now, it really touch!1d my h1\art to see this guy is putting me beforn his own interests anll his needs."

The No. 21 Irish improve to 29-9 overall and 5-1 in the Big East after the weekend play. 
.Junior Melanie Alkire kicked off the Irish 9-0 win in game one with a single up the mid­dle to drive in a run. Alkire then scored as freshman Andrea Loman slammed a homerun to left field to give the Irish a 3-0 lead after the first. 
Notre Dame completed the scoring in the second with doubles by Jennifer Krisch and Jennifer Sharron and an infield single by Andria Bledsoe who drove in two runs. 
Sharron earned her 15th win as she combined with Alkire to allow just one Villanova hit, striking out six of the 11 Wildcats she faced. Loman and Danielle Klayman both had perfect games with Loman finishing 3-for-3 at the plate while Klayman finished at 2-for-2.

BOOKSTORE BASKETBALL XXIX 
Former Irish quarterback Rice seeks first title 
By KERRY SMITH Spores Editor 
ln 1988. Tony Rice led Lou Holtz's Irish to a national cham­pionship. 
!\ow. 12 years later. he's back on campus looking for anoth('r title, one that narrowly eluded him when he was a student -a Bookstore Basketball titl0. 
Rice teamed up with Matt McKenna, Jeff Joseph, Steve Recepero and Jason Garza to form four Chumps and a National Champion in the first day of Bookstore action Monday. 
"Matt invited me and I had some free time so I thought it 

would be fun," said Rice. "I thought we did well. lt was our first time playing together. It takes a total team effort and these guys were great. I guess they wanted an old guy like me out here, you know, it's just great to be playing." 
l'vlcKenna l'ollowed Rice's career when Hice was a student at Notre Dame and thought it would be fun to team up with the former Irish quarterback. After running into him in an air­port earlier this year. McKenna figured he'd go out on a limb and ask him to be part of the team. 
"l just Pmailcd him out o[ the blue," said McKenna. "I followed him as a football player and knew he was good at basketball too, so I thought I'd take a chance and see if he wa11ted to play with us." 
Four Chumps and a National Champion easily advanced with a 21-11 win uver Who Shot the Couch. with Brian Travers, Gregg Murray, Paul Stinson, Joe Loscudo and Dave Zachry. 
Bookstore basketball success is nothing new to Hice -his teams finished in second place two years in a row when he was a student. But winning isn't the reason why Rice is back on the court. 
"Bookstore is all about having a good time," said Rice. "If you can't play with a smile on your face then you might as well not be playing." . 
Having a good time was the focus of many gamPs Monday, and the gamn featuring the Mushroom Tip !ns and the Hookers was no exception. 
~Lnd by its pimp Brick Maier, who doubled as a coach, the Hookers, with Julie Heising, Alison Healy, Jean Lantz, Stephanie Newcom and Molly O'Rourke tested its moves against the Mushroom Tip Ins' Brian Kolle. Dan Henn, Tim Keller, Joe Smith and Jim Maclnerney. 
"It was a hotly contested game," said Kolle. "It got real 
physical near the end." 

The Ilookers led for most of the game with cheap moves, but the Mushroom Tip Ins came from behind at the end for the preliminary-round win. 
"We may play down and dirty," said ()'Rourke. "But that's what we're paid for." 
In more serious Bookstore action, Next Time bring Your Sister, You Hump with seniors Andy Meirose, Dave Whelan, Hich Bein. Sean Smith and Greg Eich just edged out Porter's Five Forces in a closo 21-19 contest on the Stepan courts.
