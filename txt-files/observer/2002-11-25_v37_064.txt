Law students protest decision 
By HELENA PAYNE New,; Editor 

A group of law students held a protest Friday to denounce Notre Dame's decision not to allow third-year student Jenning Wong to spend her last semester at the New York University School of Law to be with her fiance, former Notre Dame law student Rich Kohlberger. 
"A Catholic University that espouses traditional family values would not have a policy that would keep people apart," said third-year law student Aaron Bernard, who orga­nized the protest. 
He and other students in the Law School are planning to challenge a section in the school's Hoynes Code that allows the dean to waive the six-semester requirement for law students who were not transfer students. 
"The bottom line is that the law school basically requires that courses be taken at the school for the purposes of earning a law degree," Notre Dame spokesman Matt Storin said. 
Section 4.5.2.2 of the Code gives the dean power to waive the requirement in "extraordi­narily compelling reasons," which Wong and Kohlberger thought included the reuniting of spouses. 
Julissa Robles, a second­year law student who attended the protest, said she and a group of friends have wrilten letters and plan to press the issue until the law school reevaluates the clause. 
"A lot of students are so busy and the administration knows we're only in transi­tion," Hobles said. "They expect us to be really compla­cent and to not make any waves." 
Following Wong's July engagement to Kohlberger, the couple asked law school Dean Patricia O'Hara if she could spend two semesters al NYU and still get a Notre Dame law degree. Initially, Wong wanted O'llara's approval so the couple they could spend more time togeth­er and have an August wed-

Libraries integrate online systeins 
By KATE DOOLEY 
Nc:ws Writer 
The Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Bethel College campus libraries have imple­mented a new system that allows users to renew materi­als online. 
The three schools and Holy Cross College, which plans to implement the system in the future, formed a cooperative through a system called Aleph that connects to each school's online catalog. It uses the ID barcode as well as the last four digil'l of your social secu­rity number lo process the renewal. Administrators hope the new system will help to streamline the process of using materials through the libraries. 
"The reasoning behind the renewal system is to offer stu­dents, faculty and staff the convenience of renewing books online," said Kate Ward, collection manager and systems librarian at Saint Mary's...This service allows you the comfort of renewing your book at three in the morning while sitting In your dorm room wearing your pajamas." 
The system allows patrons to sec what they have current­ly checked out on their record and then renew materials or cancel any hold requests that are no longer needed. Brochures are available at all the libraries that explain the online renewal process step by step and provide the Web addresses for each of the libraries. 

Each school's system keeps track of its own collection individually so students must go to that specific library's online catalog to renew mate­rial. said officials. Most stu­dents' materials will be renewed for 28 days, whereas faculty and graduate students have a longer time period for renewal. 
Ward said public libraries have offered this service for some time now, but use in a university setting is a relative­ly new concept. They had to make sure that people's record would be secure and private. Ward instructs users to change their verification pin to something other then their social security number as well as logging out when done to protect your privacy.

Jaguar displayed at Notre Dame 
By CHRISTINA CEPERO 
News Writer 

As part of a presentation on changes in the automotive industry, one of the eight Jaguar XKRs used in the recent James Bond movie, "Die Another Day," was on display at the Mendoza College of Business last Friday. Mike O'Driscoll, president of the Aston Martin, Jaguar and Land Hover North American division, gave a talk about recent changes and industry developments in his company. 
O'Driscoll discussed the increasing recent democratiza­tion of luxury. Among the newest changes in the automo­tive industry include aggressive growth of premium car sales in the past seven years, brand pro­liferation, broad product portfo­lios and the strengthening of dis­tribution networks, where auto­motive dealerships have become full-service destination points, said O'Driscoll. He also explained how the merger of three separate companies has affected his company. 
"We put Aston Martin. Jaguar and Land Rover together to take on the competition," said O'Driscoll. 
Luxury vehicles are also more affordable now because of con­sumers' increase in affiuence and willingness to take on debt and leasing, said O'Driscoll. Luxury automotive companies have in turn aimed to promote brand awareness, publicity and media exposure, answer con­sumer preferences, create prod­uct extensions and enhance product performance. 

"If you could take one car to your high school graduation, this would be it," said O'Driscoll. 
The other three major auto­motive companies are BMW, Mercedes Benz and Lexus, explained O'Driscoll. The demand for different categori.es of luxury items has also increased rapidly, and these brands face many of the same challenges. 
The challenges of brand democratization include pre­serving authenticity, perfor­
mance and striving for a balance between the business growth attained by volume and the brand integrity achieved by exclusivity, said O'Driscoll. 
O'Driscoll also explained how company has evolved from Lyons' Swallow Side Car Company in Coventry, England to one of the world's largest lux­ury automotive companies. Jaguar will launch the newest model of Us XJ flagship brand next year, according to O'Driscoll.

Iammyhometown's expert 
I've successfully made it through the flrst three months ofmy college career. And as Thanksgiving approaches, I reflect on this semester and the classes I've had, the things I've done and the people I've met. And one thing has Maureen really stood out to

me, besides the 
fact that professors 
always seem to News Wire 
hand out the big Editor 
papers and exams 
on the days that 
have already gone really badly. 
Everyone, no matter who they are or 
where they're from, becomes an expert 
on their hometown or state when they 
enter college. 
Think about it. When you meet some­one in a class and ask them where they're from they will come up with some sort of trivia to qualify their home­town. For example: "Where are you from?" "Dayton, Ohio. You know, Martin Sheen is originally from Dayton.~ 
My friends and I are no exception. Through various late-night conversa­tions, I have discovered that Emily knows all about the Minnesota Twins, Sarah can tell me the places various Hollywood stars hang out in Los Angeles, Meg is the resident expert on the Mafia in New Jersey and Nora has become our very own South Bend sage. Want to know a great place to eat or shop in South Bend? Ask Nora. Which crime family had each of its wives mys­teriously die while washing windows? Meg knows. 
Being from Chicago, I myself have become a meteorologist ofsorts for the area surrounding Lake Michigan. My forecast never changes: it will always get colder. No matter what the temper­ature is now, it will always get worse. While my friends from warmer climates huddle in their big winter coats, I am determined to boycott my own winter coat until snow accumulates on the ground (which, by the way, will not be until early December). 
I think that we do this because each person. when they enter college, wants to show that their hometown is just as interesting as everyone else's. Either that or we just enjoy one-upping every­one else's stories. 
Now freshmen, I'm going to bet that the same thing is going to happen when we go home for Thanksgiving this week. All those friends that we haven't seen since August are going to come home with all sorts of stories about their own schools. And we, in turn, will become experts once again, but this time on Notre Dame history. dorm life, off-cam­pus parties and everything else about life here. And ifit turns out that we are just trying to one-up each other, we have the consummate line to one-up friends from almost any other school. 
Just ask them what their football team's record is.

Gill discusses religious art 
 Religious art aids in understanding the divine 
By MARIA SMITH 
News Writ~r 
In tho last talk of tho College of Arts and Letters Saturday Scholar Series. Meredith Gill, assistant pro­fessor or a.rt at Notre Dame, discussed religious inspiration in various artworks in her talk entitled, "Art and the Hcligious Imagination." 
Gill explored the methods used in religious art and what meaning lay behind the artists' endeavors. 
"Thomas Merton once said that a saint is a sign from God. The saint is a sacramen­tum, a sign of mediating grace," said Gill. "Can a work of art operate in the same way, as a sign of mediating grace?" 
Gill emphasized the special role artists have in making religious experience more accessible to their audience. "Artists offer us a way to imagine the unimaginable," said Gill. "Artists can

es." 
Gill dis­cussed two main meth­ods -identification and vision -for creating art that connected viewers with a reli­gious experience. 
"llero the Roman martyr, Sebastian, is located in the Arno Valley of Florence, the artist's home town," said Gill, when describing Italian 
, 
Antonjo del Pollaiuolo's art­work "St. Sebastian" which depicts the saint being pierced by arrows for the crime of being a Christian. "Seeing this evoked quite lit­erally on one's own doorstep had to allow the viewer a way into understanding this gruel­ing death,'' she said. 
Gill also discussed the paiut­i n g "St. Augustine in His Study," a depiction by tho Italian artist Vittore 
Ca.rpaccio of the Catholic theologian and saint as a scholar. 
"In this painting, he appears not as [a] theolo­gian so much as a profes­sor in his study," said 
"Bernini has represented the purely invisible and the purely physical means . .,

Gill. "Here, I think that identi­fication has to do with imag ining an Augustine for the times." 
Gill said insights such as these were a positive aspect of identification in religious art. 
"The departure from histor­ical truth tells us about the continuities 
giving us new stage sets and new kinds of heroes," said Gill. 
However, she also emphasized the more dis­

turbing side of identification in art. 
"There is a deeper aspect to identification which plays into a very deep theme in Christianity," said Gill. "A work of art can prod us to imagine the worst of tor­ments, torments worse than 
death itself." Gill referred specifically to

German artists Matthias Grunewald's painting "Temptation of St. Anthony," which shows the saint suffer­ing from the disease known as St. Anthony's Fire, a fungus which caused lesions and gangrene. The painting hung in a ward for patients suffer­ing from the disease, said Gill.

"A lot of people don't real­ize that and don't look beyond fences and streets," said Carnegie. "They go where they need to go with­out realizing that they are so close lo people who need so much." 
Susan Almeda, a student manager at Dalloway's, said she is pleased with the results of Dalloway's food drive and with the generosity being shown throughout the Saint Mary's community. 
"I feel that every little bit helps because the Food Bank of Northern Indiana is in such desperate need of food," said Almeda. "Any contribution that we can make can help, and because there are other food drives going on for the Food Bank of Northern Indiana, the college is doing a really good job of collecting food as a community." 
Carnegie added that the Food Bank of Northern Indiana would accept both food and monetary donations. Every $500 raised brings in a truckload of food worth approximately $6.000 of donated food, she said.

The work stands in a richly paint­ed alcove in the Italian Church, while light from a hidden window above the alcove illuminates the scene. 
"Bernini has represented the purely invisible and the purely spiritual through pure­ly physical means," said Gill. "I think that we really could say, here, that we have a work of art as a sign of medi­ating grace," 
Bill Carnegie, director of the food bank, said they are running out of food everyday. 
"The big picture is we pro­vide food to over 300 local charities, and they have basi­cally cleaned us out of food." said Carnegie. "We are being forced to turn away agen­cies." 
The Food Bank of Northern Indiana serves about 90,000 people per month in 10 coun­ties in northern Indiana, said Carnegie. He pointed out that many members of the com­munity are unaware of how many people in the local area

ding, but they changed the date to December because of the delay it took at the begin­ning of the year to talk to deans in the law school. 
"We didn't want to get mar­ried and be separated," Wong said. 
In their letter to O'Hara, Wong and Koh!berger explained how they had grown accustomed to studying with one another before Kohlberger's transfer to NYll for his second year of law school. Even after the two were separated, they traveled every other week to visit one another, which they said put a financial and emotional strain on them, 
Kohlberger said he began talking with people at NYU about Wong's chances of acceptance while Wong began consulting with deans Vincent Rougeau and John Robinson about leaving Notre Dame.

said. 
The library hopes that the sys­tem will serve the patrons as well as cut back on their late fees. Earlier in the semester, Saint Mary's library began to e­mail late notices as opposed to mailing them. 
Now, coupled with the renewal dent affairs of NYU's law school, said NYU has to get the permission of the school where the visiting student will receive his or her degree. 

"It's more Notre Dame's decision," Bravo-Weber said. 
Wong and Kohlberger both argued the reuniting of spous­es would merit an exception, but after attempts to meet with Robinson, the two were finally rejected in separate meetings with Robinson and O'Hara. Wong also claimed that both Robinson and O'Hara said they were "comfortable with keep­ing a husband and wife sepa­rate." 
Robinson would not com­ment on the situation and O'Hara did not return phone calls left by the Observer. 
"This is a Catholic school. Of all the places [where} mar­riage should be supported and embraced l thought that Notre Dame would support me in my wedding," Wong said. 
At this point, Wong said there is no guarantee that she would be able to register for the two classes she needs to graduate even if she did get Notre Dame's permission to go to NYU. However, she and Kohlberger have not changed their December wedding.

Priest returns to his former parish 
Associated Press 
NEWTON, Mass. 
Monsignor Michael Smith Foster made an emotional return to his former parish Sunday for the first time since he was cleared of child sexual abuse allegations. 
"By your prayers you clothed my spirit. By your concern through letters and calls and action you wel­comed me into your lives when I felt like I had been cast into prison," he said. 

Foster was one of the high­·est ranking clergy members accused of abuse since the crisis erupted in January, when court documents revealed that the archdio­cese shuffled abusive priests between parishes. He is the presiding judge of the arch­diocesan tribunal that han­dles annulments and canon law issues. 
The Mass at Sacred Heart church was packed with those who steadfastly sup­ported the priest when he was accused of sexual abuse and twice suspended before being reinstated last month. 
As he made his way up the aisle toward the altar. shak­ing hands and greeting parishioners, the congrega­tion broke out in applause for about 30 seconds. 

"You stopped what was happening in your lives and gave your time and support to me. I am overwhelmed by your loving support," he told former youth group members and altar servers, who coun­tered the abuse allegation from a former altar boy. 
The archdiocese is "delighted"to have Foster back in full ministry, said spokeswoman Donna Morrissey. "We're going to work together to make sure we maintain and respect his good name," she said. 
Foster's case revealed deep wounds within the church, spurring accusations from both clergy and laity that the archdiocese mishandled Foster's case and has failed to protect its priests. 
In August, former altar boy Paul Edwards accused Foster of sexually molesting him in his rectory bedroom at Newton's Sacred Heart parish between 1980 and 1985. 
Foster then took a leave of absence and was suspended from his pastoral duties. But the charges were placed in doubt after acquaintances of Edwards pointed to factual errors in his account.

The postponements pushed the shuttle flight into normal daytime working hours and because of that, the astro­nauts said they felt in better shape. "Physically, I think the delays helped us," Bowersox said.

Despite the 2-inch bruise near the shoulder of the 50­foot crane, it operated fine in orbit, although a wrist joint was sluggish. Mission Control said recently applied lubri­cant may not have had a chance yet to work its way into that joint. 
The arm will be used Tuesday to lift a giant girder from the shuttle payload bay for installation on the space station. 
Endeavour will spend a full week at the space station and return to Earth, with Whitson and her two station crewmates, on Dec. 4. 
Bowersox, Pettit and Russian cosmonaut Nikolai Budarin will remain aboard the orbiting complex until March.

IRAQ 
Iraq claims U.N. resolution has unfair pretext for war 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD 
In a point-by-point proLest, the Iraqi government com­plained to the United Nations Sunday that the small print behind the weapons inspec­lions beginning this week will give Washington a pretext to attack. 
The new U.N. resolution on the inspections could turn "inaccurate statements lamoug] thousands of pages" of required Iraqi reports into a supposed justification for mili­tary action, Foreign Minister Naji Sub ri said in a letter to 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. 
"Them is premeditation to target Iraq, whatever the pre­text." Sabri said. 
llis lengthy letter, a detailed commentary on the Security Council resolution, was not expectnd to affect the inspec­tions, which resume Wednesday after a four-year suspension. Iraq had accepted lhe rcsolulion in a Nov. 13 let­ter from Sabri to Annan. 
Preparations moved steadily ahead on Baghdad's outskirts Sunday, where technicians at the U.N. inspection center worked to establish a "hot line" with liaisons in the Iraqi gov­ernment. The first working group of 18 inspectors arrives Monday on a flighl. from a U.N. rear base in Cyprus. Their numbers are expected to swell by year-end to between 80 and 100 at a time in Iraq. 
In seven years' work after the 1991 Gulf War, U.N. experts destroyed large amounts of chemical and bio­logical weapons and longer­range missiles forbidden to Iraq by U.N. resolutions, and dismantled Iraq's nuclear weapons program before it could build a bomb. The inspections were suspended amid disputes over U.N. access to Iraqi sites and Iraqi com­plainls the United States insert­

teams.  
A new focus on  Iraq by the  

Bush administration led to adoption of Resolution 1441 and the dispatch of inspectors back to Iraq with greater pow­ers of unrestricted access to suspected weapons sites. Washington alleges Iraq retains some prohibited weapons and may be produc­ing others. 
The resolution, adopted unanimously Nov. 7, demands the Iraqis give up any chemi­cal, biological or nuclear weapons. or face "serious con­sequences."

Israeli troops occupy West Bank mosques: 
On the firsl Sunday since Israel reoccupied Bethlehem, troops barred Christians from worship­ping at the Church of the Nativity, one of Christianity's most sacred shrines. Soldiers in anoth­er part of the West Bank searched four mosques for suspected militants. There were no signs that the Israelis were near an end to the operation in the bib­lical town, despite a State Department call for troops to leave as soon as possible, with Christmas just a month away. Christian tradition holds that Jesus was born in a grotto under the Bethlehem church. Israeli forces rolled into Bethlehem, in the West Bank just south of Jerusalem, early Friday after a Palestinian suicide bomber from Bethlehem blew himself up on a Jerusalem bus a day before, killing 11 passengers and injuring more than 40 other people.

Senate urges probe on money trail: 
Lawmakers pressed for answers Sunday on a possible Saudi money trail in the Sept. 11 hijackings and said regardless of whether one exists, the kingdom must stop its "duplici­tous" coddling of terrorists. Saudi officials spent the weekend having bankers pore over the records of Princess Haifa al-Faisal, wife of their ambassador to the United States, to see how thousands of dollars from her account might have ended up in the wrong hands, said Saudi foreign policy adviser Adel al-Jubeir. But he said it was "crazy" to sug­gest she had done anything intentionally to support terrorism. Lawmakers said the FBI's investigation should pull no punches, and the Bush administration should be open about the findings, despite the risk of offending an important ally with whom relations already have been strained. 
Shelby predicts al-Qaida attacks: 
Sen. Richard Shelby, an eight-year veteran of the Senate Intelligence Committee, warned Americans on Sunday to expect another major attack from al-Qaida terrorists. "Oh, absolutely. It's going to happen," Shelby said on NBC's "Meet the Press." Ile said he based his opinion partly on a warning of a spectacular attack contained in an audiotape, broadcast Nov. 12 on al-Jazeera television in the Persian Gulf emirate Qatar. U.S. intelligence experts attributed the tape to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born fugitive who leads the al-Qaida terror network. "There were several mes­sages there," said Shelby. "One, to all of his support­ers, and to us, that he is alive, and he's kicking, and he's going to be around. And I think ho also sent the message he's going to attack us and attack our allies." Shelby, R-Ala., who is leaving the intelligence commit­tee in the new Congress convening in January, has been known for years as a leading Senate authority on national security.

I I Mold in schools 
draining budgets 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. 
To protest a menace in their school, nearly 1,000 students at East High School in Memphis skipped homeroom one day. 
Across the state, another 1,000 students spent a month at Bristol Motor Speedway not watching NASCAR races. but studying in the skyboxes while a threat was removed at Sullivan East High School. 
In each case, the problem was 
the same: mold. 
Nationwide, school districts are finding allergy-inducing mold in walls, on carpets and near ventilation systems. While one report blames aging build­ings and mold-promoting con­struction techniques, one expert says it's due to a lack of proper ventilation in newer schools. 
"It's a growing problem, and it's one of the more high-priority issues that schools are dealing with," said Ericka Plater, indoor air quality manager for the American Association of School Administrators. 
Mold has forced some admin­
istrators to shut down schools 
and make millions of dollars in 
repairs. Others face lawsuits 
from students and staff who 
claim moldy buildings caused 
long-term health problems. 
In Austin, Texas, voters approved a $49.3 million bond issue in February to pay for mold removal and preventive maintenance in 91 schools. In Fort Myers, Fla., several teach­ers sued county school officials last week, accusing them of fail­ing to fix mold problems. 
In Tennessee, just before the Bristol students were forced out of their school, teenagers at Heritage High School about two hours away in Maryville got an unexpected four-week vacation when mold was found there. The repair estimate: $1 million. 
Memphis school board mem­bers called an emergency meet­ing after hundreds of students there refused to enter East High, which some parents described as a "mold-infested hazard." 
About 600 students received medical screenings after Donald Criss Mister Jr. 17, died Nov. 16 following an asthma attack. So far, no link has been found between the death and mold in the school, but the school board hired an environmental consul­tant, and federal inspectors with the Environmental Protection Agency will tour it Monday. 
Sonji Wright, the mother of a student. told Superintendent Johnnie B. Watson that bringing in experts wasn't enough. 
'-''My baby is on a respirator. Mr. Watson," she screamed through a white mask that cov­ered her nose and mouth in a sign of protest. "She cannot breathe, and what are you going to do about it?" 
Mold problems usually go unnoticed until people become 
ill. No federal agency regulates or monitors air quality in schools, and few states inspect for it. 
In Tennessee. no state agency monitors mold in schools. 
"It's really everybody's prob­lem because it's such a new issue," said Judith Morgan. the state Education Department spokeswoman. "That's why it seems to be falling kind of between the cracks." 
Tennessee's education depart­ment sent e-mail to school offi­cials statewide Friday and directed them to an EPA Web site that offers guidance on air quality issues. 
Plater said a federal report suggests old. dilapidated schools might be more susceptible to. mold. Others say the Gypsum wallboard and carpeted floors that replaced plaster and wood make newer schools a greater target because they soak up more moisture. 
David Weekley, president of Knoxville-based Environmental Consulting and Testing, said the 1970s energy crisis prompted construction of more airtight schools. Less natural ventilation is part of the problem, he said. 
Another factor is the tendency of cash-strapped districts to delay maintenance and patch leaks, he said. 
Mold occurs naturally and can grow almost anywhere that's warm and damp. Experts have identified more than 100,000 species of mold; at least 1,000 are common in the United States. 
While the most common molds generally aren't haz­ardous, some types are blamed for headaches, fatigue and res­piratory problems. 
Sullivan County Schools direc­tor John O'Dell said the Bristol high school was shut down for about six weeks and $600,000 worth of repairs after children became ill and several class­rooms tested positive for black mold, or Stachybotrys char­tarum, which can cause breath­ing problems. 
The mold there was primarily around poorly insulated pipes that carry cold water through­out the building to cool class­rooms. The pipes created con­densation that dripped onto porous ceiling tiles, providing a breeding ground for mold. 
"I think we're all more sensi­tive to it now," O'Dell said. "We've told the principals and custodians to keep an eye out for any discolored tile and then replace it immediately."

Their leader, Alfred Gusenbauer, had expressed confidence that his party would win at the polls, and it was unlikely that he would allow the People's Party to dictate coalition terms from a much stronger position.

When Haider's party came to power in 1999, the European Union imposed seven months of diplomatic sanctions on Austria. alarmed by then party leader Haider's anti-foreigner stance, veiled slights of Jews and open admiration for some of Adolf Hitler's poli­cies. 
Israel recalled its ambas­sador and hasn't yet returned him. 
But EU officials·now con­cede that sanctions were a mistake that only strength­ened Haider among those convinced that the rest of the world was against them and that Austria was being pun­ished for making a democra­tic choice. 
The Freedom Party's suc­cess turned out to be the harbinger of a trend in Europe that saw right­wingers and anti-immigra­tion mavericks make gains in France, the Netherlands, Denmark and elsewhere. 
But the Haider-instigated infighting which led to resig­nations of several popular Freedom Party ministers from government and Schuessel's call for elections more than a year ahead of schedule left the party in chaos.

IN BRIEF 
Qantas gets part of Air New Zealand 
Qantas Airways will acquire 22.5 percent of Air New Zealand In a deal that caps nearly a year of talks between the two airlines. 
The deal announced Monday calls for Qantas to invest as $550 million New Zealand dollars ($272 million) into the New Zealand airline. which is 82 percent owned by the gov­ernment after a bailout last year. 
The Qantas purchase will allow the airlines to rationalize their operations and interna­tional services to form a strong Australasian airline group, Air New Zealand said. 
"This is a major decision that will shape the future of Air New Zealand ... and an initiative which will bring tremendous economic gain to New Zealand," Air New Zealand chairman John Palmer said. 
The combined operations would be con­trolled by the New Zealand carrier. Qantas will assume two seats on Air New Zealand's board. 
Kentucky nursing home fights closure 
Lawyers for the nursing home whose owner had an affair with Gov. Paul Patton go to court Monday to defend the facility against state efforts to shut it down. 
Attorney Fred H. Simon said he would call employees of Birchtrec Ilealthcare and rela­lives of the home's residents to testify about the quality of its care. He also hoped to have results of a private inspection. 
"This is the first opportunity to dispel al! the innuendo about 'immediate jeopardy' this facility has supposedly placed its patients in," Simon said last week. 
The state's Cabinet for Heallh Services has compiled a thick dossier on the nursing home, with allegations of alleged deficien­cies that include for conditions that alleged­ly put residents in jeopardy. 
The state is trying to revoke Birchtree's license for "continued and substantial fail­ure" to meet minimum requirements for a nursing home.

Ramadan is in its second week as I write this. It is now the long middle of the month. During the first few days of Ramadan, everyone is excit­ed because of the change, kind of like the start of the holiday sea­Maite Uranga son. People talk about who is fast ing and who is

not. The 14-, 15­and 16-year-olds who are fasting for the first time feel grown up. The little kids like it because after about two in the afternoon they can get away with everything because their parents and older siblings no longer have the energy to control them. The Koranic students who go from house to house begging for food get more food this month than during most others for the same reason soup kitchens have extra food around Thanksgiving. 
And I like it because it is refresh­ing to see a culture and people devoted to something without taking into account the financial implica­tions or lost work hours. Do not mis­understand me: Ramadan is hard. I fasted for three days last year and was content to never do it again for the rest of my life. The middle two weeks of the month are painful because the end seems so far off. Despite this, I see the benefits that Ramadan provides and think it would be amazing to see what would happen in the United States if Americans fasted for even a week. 
Americans always complain about lack of time for themselves and their families. This fasting period would allow everyone to slow down dra­matically. After-school soccer prac­tice, happy hour, late afternoon classes and any other late afternoon or evening activities would be can­celed for the duration of the fast. People would leave work or school around noon to go home. Because of low energy levels, no major activi­ties could take place and families would sit around and talk to each other. 
Malls. corporations, police services and grocery stores would cut their employees to the bare minimum. Most importantly. all this would be done without the guilt that many Americans have when they do take time for their families and them­selves. All this was done in respect for God or some other force greater than themselves. It would be blas phemous to calculate the dollar value of lost work hours or worry about the effects of lost school hours. Families would get hours to themselves. People would have time to think. Life would slow down. 
Realistically, of course, this would never happen. Long ago, most Christian religions abandoned the practice of fasting because it no longer fit within the Western cultur­al context. Simplified down from an extended fasting period, I think it would also be interesting to imagine if Americans adopted some form of the Muslim practice of praying five times a day. When I first arrived in Mauritania I found the five-times·a­day prayer excessive. Five times a day, the mosques scream out over their microphones for people to stop what they are doing and pray. 
The entire act of praying takes anywhere from five to 20 minutes. It was not this time that bothered me; it was the fact that meetings would stop at sundown for everyone to pray and then resume. I did not understand why they could not just wait five more minutes until the meeting was over to pray. As my life pace transitioned from American speed to Mauritanian speed, I began to appreciate these daily interrup tJons in routine. The religious aspect is obviously very important. But because I am both an outsider to the religion and a former anthropology major. I see the importance and · benefits of the process. 
Five times a day people stop what· ever they are doing. They wash their face, hands and feet. The actual act of praying is similar to a stretching exercise. They start by standing up really straight, then bend at the waist for a few seconds, then go to a sitting position. bend at the waist again with their head to the ground and then stand up to repeat it between two and four times depend· ing on which prayer it is. This is repeated 17 times throughout the day. 
Yet again, this would give Americans the time that they so des perately want. They would stop everything they are doing, thereby realizing that what they are doing is not as vitally important as they think. Then they would refresh themselves by washing their faces and hands and finally doing some stretches. For a minimum of five minutes a day. five times a day, no one could interrupt them, they could not answer the phone or respond to e-mails. Most likely. I know, even this is too much for most Americans, including myself. Now I appreciate Ramadan afternoons and the call to the mosque.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Homosexuality presents problem to priesthood 
I was disappointed, though not sur­prised, to see Richard Friedman's Nov. 21 article attacking the Church for reiterating its teachings on the priesthood and reiterating the posi­tion that the Sacred Congregation for Heligious pronounced in 1961 that homosexuals should not be ordained as priests. This is not a new policy, only the reiteration of one that has been mostly ignored for the last 40 years. I am sure that I will draw the ire of some in the Notre Dame com­munity for this letter, but I think it important for some clarification. 
Let's start by understanding that the very nature of the priesthood is sacrifice. Priests are not supposed to be glorified social workers. Their pri­mary duty is to administer the sacra­ments. Their life is a sacrifice in ser­vice. Contrary to popular belief, no one has the right to be a priest, not even heterosexual men. The priest­hood is a service you are called to, by Christ, through a bishop. 
No one can be positive they have a vocation to the priesthood until a validly consecrated bishop, in com­munion with the Church through the Pope, lays hands on the candidate and ordains him. The Church did not create the priesthood, it is only the custodian of the tradition which Christ founded. This is why the Church has always stated that it docs not have the authority to ordain women. The Church has given a form to the fundamental, but it has not created it. She must be careful to guard it against distortion, and can­not add or subtract from its meaning. 
The priesthood is also a position of teaching and therefore authority. This does not mean that the priest has power, but rather responsibility to be an example and an educator of the teachings of the Church. It is here that homosexuality is most evi­dently a problem if allowed in the priesthood. 
The fact is, no one who under­stands the issue blames homosexuali­ty for pedophilia. However, most of the cases in the current scandal are not pedophilia but rather sexual acts with teenagers who had reached, at least biologically, sexual maturity. A 17-year-old being abused is not the same situation as a 7-year-old being abused. 
Most of the perpetrators of sexual abuse that have been brought to light have been cases where adult homo­sexual men, from 25 to 50 years old, have shown a preference for teenage boys. The most unfortunate part of' the scandal has been that a clerical culture where homosexuals make up a significant minority has encouraged sexual immorality and covered up its most atrocious instances. 
I am not trying to say that persons with a homosexual orientation neces­sarily advocate sexual immorality. However, any time people who are inclined to a particular activity find themselves in the company of others in like mind, the activity tends to occur. This is why you can go to the Rock on a weeknight and find your­self participating in a pick-up basket­ball game if you arc so inclined. The tradition of Alcoholics Anonymous has the same understanding. 
When a group of people who are trying to deny their learned inclina­tion to drink get together, they can encourage each other in their restraint. But they must avoid situa­tions where drinking occurs, or that they associated with drinking previ­ously. until they can be sure the pressure will not be too much. They also are encouraged to find ways to relieve their lives of stress, since a high-stress life tends to discourage the healthy pressure to reform their lives for the better. 
Courage, a support group for homo­sexuals trying to live chaste lives, strongly advises against a person with a homosexual inclination enter­ing a seminary to become a priesl. Homosexuals cannot escape the temptations of the world by becoming priests. The priesthood is not a place to run from your problems. 
It is not an easy way to live out your life chastely. It is not something you do because you can't do some­thing else. The priesthood, by its nature, is not equipped to deal with a significant number of men who suffer from the same serious afflictions. This is why alcoholism has been such a problem for the priesthood and often priests have to spend many years away from their duties to learn how to live sober lives. 
It's also why former alcoholics, or recovering alcoholics, are carefully, and sometimes painfully, scrutinized before they can become priests. And even then it is an exception, not the rule, to ordain such a person. Still, if an alcoholic were to succumb to the bottle it is not the case that his action would likely result in the scan­dal and pain of something as serious as what we have seen over the last year. 
Unfortunately, I think it can be said that we have seen over the last year the effects of a homosexual subcul­ture in the priesthood that has destroyed the lives of many people. The problem, even then, is not per­sons with a homosexual orientation. It is the unfortunate culture of dis­sent that holds a strong sway in the Church. 
It has become commonplace for priests to disagree with that or another teaching of the Church. Not only have "little ones" been led astray by this, but some have also been terribly scarred. I find it hard to imagine that this problem of ped­erasty would have had such a strong effect if faithfulness to the teachings of the Church and fraternal account­ability had been the norm rather than "hush-hush cronyism" and dis­sent from teachings on sexuality.

GUEST COLUMN 
Macho man attitude perpetuates stereotypes 
Ile stands tall with his shoulders spread wide. Ile inhales deep breaths and exhales loud grunts as he scratches him­self. He watches football by day and drinks beer by night, all the while staring intently (and lustfully) at beautiful women or wrestling with his buddies in the mud. 
This is the picture of the stereotypi­cal male. John Krasting 
We sec it day in and day out. Television programs such as Tim Allen's "Home Improvement" and Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla's Daily Targum "The Man Show" arejust two quin­tessential examples ofwhat the typi­cal man is supposed to be like. Their shows illustrate the love of power-tools, flannel shirts and girls on trampolines. These shows. along with other fonns of media like Maxim magazine, promote male bonding and pride. 
This sense of pride dates way back. The American man ha5 always stood for independence and defiance, even from the days of the revolutionary war. We were a bunch of dis­sident rebels who took charge and settled this country. 
While that war was fought with muskets, today's power struggle is waged with testosterone. Some men aspire to be leaders controlling their surroundings with excessive dis­plays of aggression and force. The quest to be the most powerful male is often referred to having an "Alpha Male Complex." 
Experts argue that this emphasis on power and control is a natural instinct governed by that primitive limbic system that subconsciously makes us belch in an attempt to make our presence known. 
Being an Alpha Male in today's society, however, is a tough gig. It requires constant supplies of alcohol and sports channels. All of these external influences give us pause to think how much of the male dominance is actually influenced by our culture. 
What happens when men don't fit the stereotype of the genital-adjusting dude in a tight white T-shirt? To put it bluntly: he is often walked all over. 
Some individuals even find it hard to be socially accepted among other men and have a diffi­cult time gaining their respect and attention. More sensitive men may be labeled shy, weak or gay. 
This is a com­plete fallacy. There are many men in America with passive personalities who just don't think a good beer is their thing. If an individual doesn't fit into the category of a typical male, it is absolutely no indication ofhis strength, goals or sexuality. 
There are also some men who take their testosterone well beyond the legal limit -and I mean that quite literal­ly. The truth is that this excessive display only leads to problems. Men seek psychological highs when they attempt to control women or commit crimes. The Beltway snipers are prime examples of t.wo men who enjoyed controlling the police and the American people with criminal acts and intimidation. These men have issues that deal with insecu­rity and believe that they can find the answer by playing 
the role ofa dominant male. There is no doubt that this nature versus nurture contro­versy has solid arguments for both sides. While there is a biological link to the excessive displays of"manli­ness," there is also an obvious and clear influence from within our society -what is perceived to be the normal expected 
behavior for men. Keep in mind, however, that there 
are many more ways to be a leader and stand out from the crowd-and being a leader is 
not dependent on a person's sex. 1 know countless women who are strong and fearless, and they demonstrate those qualities in a very dignified and classy way. If you're a man, explore your sensitive side 
-listening to people can often achieve just as much respect and admiration from others. Unless there is a burn­ing uncontrollable urge from within, try to keep the macho man to yourself.

Scene Wricer 
Music blaring. Lights flashing. Hearts pounding. Twenty-four dancers are on stage, each tapping out quick complicated rhythms with their feet touching the floor at exact­ly the same time. This is Michael Flatley's rock dance fusion "Lord of the Dance," a spectacular experience of an accelerated version of tradition­al Irish Dancing that showed Friday and Saturday at the Morris Performing Arts Center. Although the show's original creator no longer per­forms as the lead, the dance goes on. 
The mystical performance begins with a troubled dream of the Spirit, a magical fairy, who senses an evil presence that has come to challenge the Lord of the Dance. In a vague good versus evil plot, the Spirit trav­els through time to help the Lord of the Dance protect his mythical people from the Dark Lord. A series of dance numbers introduce each main char­acter and their dancing followers who represent each moral extreme and work their conflicts out through dance. 
An evil temptress dances with a sexy suggestive flair, while the pure and fair heroine glides through the air with a delicate elegance. But the show is at its best when the entire company is out on stage dancing. The age-old elements of an Irish cel­ebration stim­ulate the audience with an adrenaline pumping combi­nation of infec­tious Irish music and energetic danc­ing. 
"Lord of the Dance" combines traditional choreog­raphy to light jigs and beautiful pat­terns of customary group dances with glittering costumes, thunderous sound and fluorescent strobe lights to create a modern frish spectacle that invades the senses. Sometimes the glitz is overwhelming and the hard shoe taps are so suspiciously over amplified that they sound pre­recorded. 
The dancing numbers are bro­ken up with Celtic songs per­formed by a woman who has a beautifully clear voice. But her songs take away from the momentum of the show and do not contribute to the plot at all. In fact, they seem completely random. Another musical break in dancing features a pair of violinists who play to taped supple­mental music that dis­tracts from their talent­ed performance. 
The story comes to a climax with a dance off between the Lord

of the Dance and the Dark Lord. Of course. goodness prevails and the Lord of the Dance magically repairs the Spirit's flute and banishes evil. The incredible "Planet Ireland," a celebration of dance, caps off the show. 
At one point during the show. the dancers tear off costumes that resemble traditional dresses to reveal skimpy black tops and spandex shorts. This dramatic gesture sym­bolizes the show's departure from the rigid traditions of historical Irish dancing. Michael Flatley, the show's creator believes that Lord of the Dance brings a new passion to Irish dance. A passion that he felt was missing in the contemporary Irish Dance scene. The immense public response proves that his vision is a magical triumph. 
Today, Michael Flatley is a world superstar. But even before "Lord of the Dance" he had a history in the spotlight. A Chicago native, he became the World Champion Irish Dancer in 1975 at age 17 -the first non-European to win the title. He broke the world record for fastest tap dancer with 35 taps per second. A featured dancer and flutist, Flatley traveled with the famous Irish musi­cal group The Chieftains in the early nineties. But Flatley was destined for massive mainstream success.

The offense's turn 
Irish explode for 28 third-quarter points in rout ofRutgers 
By JOE LINDSLEY Sports Writ~r 
The Irish offense finally had more fight than fright as No. 8 Notre Dame slammed 1-9 Rutgers 42-0 Saturday at Notre Dame Stadium. 
Carlyle Holiday tied a Notre Dame school record with his four touchdown passes as the Irish notched their tenth win of the season, making head coach Tyrone Willingham the win­ningest first-year coach in Notre Dame history. 
"You don't get many shutouts in your career," Willingham said. "So being able to start with a shutout and ending at home with a shutout its special when that day comes and you sit down and 
,. . 
reflect on it. Our team carries an understanding of what we can be and our team is excited about the 
,. 
brand of football we have been playing and that we are having fun." 
With his team now 10-1, Willingham surpassed Terry Brennan's and Ara Parseghian's previous first-year records of nine wins in a season. However, the freshman Irish coach did not wish to discuss that. 
"I can't talk about that," he said. "That is not anything about Tyrone Willingham. it is about our team -our assistant coach­es and our players." 
Under Willingham. this Irish squad made the biggest one-sea­son turnaround since 1964, when Parseghian transformed a previ­ously 5-6 team into a 9-1 power. 
The offense took time to get started in the first quarter against a lowly Scarlet Knights squad that had entered Saturday's game allowing 198.1 rushing yards per game. 
In the second quarter. though, Notre Dame put its first points on the board after Holiday's 38-yard touchdown pass to Arnaz Battle. Then Shane Walton gave the Irish their eighth non-offensive touchdown of the season as he followed a disputed interception of a Ryan Hart pass with a 45­yard return to the end zone. It was Walton's seventh intercep­tion of the season. 
Replays showed Walton trapped the ball on the ground, and Hutgers coach Greg Schiano vehemently protested the touch­down. 
"That was huge for us," said linebacker Mike Goolsby, who made seven tackles for the Irish. "The defense. the whole team, prides itself on displays like that. 
That's what we've been doing all year. It's good to finally get hack to it." 
The third quarter was when Notre Dame gave reason for its high-ranking. During the second play of the half. Battle scored his second touchdown of the season after catching a 63-yard pass from Holiday. 
The Irish went on to score on their next three possessions. with Holiday throwing touchdown passes of 37 and 26 yards to Omar Jenkins and Maurice Stovall, respectively, and with Ryan Grant running 28 yards into the end zone. 
It was Holiday's first career four-touchdown game. 
"I said that I believe that at some point the offense would begin showing some of its poten­tial," Willingham said. "Today it did that. The passing was excep­tional in that stretch in the third quarter, really for the whole game to he quite honest about it. I thought that they did a great job in playing in a way that I think they can play." 

While Willingham said he did not say much at halftime, the players said he challenged them to step up their efforts. 
"We came out Coach Willingham presented a chal­lenge to us at halftime," Jenkins said. "We answered the chal­lenge. basically we saw what can happen when we execute fully, and that's what happened." 
While HoJiday said it was the offense's best performance of the season, he still acknowledges that there is work to be done before the Irish take on No. 6 USC next Saturday. 
"I don't know if we're back on track," Holiday said. "I know we came out second half how we wanted to play and how we thought we could play, but this should carry on for the rest of the season and until the bowl game, we just have to keep that there." 
Saturday's domination of the Scarlet Knights still serves as a confidence boost for the Irish, especially after the near-loss to Navy and the upset by Boston College. 
"It's a big momentum builder," Holiday said. "It shows we can put points on the board, put our game together, what we can do those kind of things for our team, it's a big confidence booster for us." 
The Scarlet Knights' coach acknowledges the improvements the Irish offense has made. 
"If Holiday can throw like that and they can run routes like that, they are going to be pretty tough to beat." Schiano said. "Because that has been something that hasn't been a big part of their offense, and certainly it was today." 
While the offense showed its potential, the Irish defense remained strong as ever, with second-string players entering the game in the season's final game at Notre Dame Stadium. 
"I think that we added some offense to it makes it impressive," Willingham said. "Our defense has been extremely consistent all year in not giving up a great deal and today is no difference."

Battle and Walton better try to get a copy of that picture. A picture of the Irish Guard dancing with 42-0 shin­ing on the scoreboard. A picture of two grinning Irish seniors who helped a 5-6 team turn into a 10-1 squad. 
A picture that captured their last moment on Notre Dame Stadium, with thousands of fans roaring their approval. 
After the game, the pair said they weren't crying. But they might have been before, each added with a smile. 
"Before i.he game, I felt a little teary-eyed," Watton said. "But now it's done and il's over." 
It's over. 
Most would kill to get the chance walk-on Dan Novakov had, to take a handful of snaps in garbage time with a gold helmet on your head and 80,000 fans cheering you on. Most would give both arms and both legs to run out of the tunnel before every game. Most would cry tears of happi­ness if given the chance to play one year for Notre Dame. 
What Battle and Walton experi­enced in college defies explanation. They couldn't have imagined what would happen when they first entered Notre Dame, Battle as a quarterback. Walton as a soccer player. 
But five years, three coaches, two losing seasons and one return to glory later, neither could have imag­ined a better way to walk out of Notre Dame Stadium. 
At one point in Saturday's 42-0 thrashing left the Knights scarlet for that matter, couldn't have script­ed a better home finale for Notre Dame's seniors. 
None of them wanted to start the game on the bench. Yet none of them seemed to mind that they finished the game on the bench, watching Tim O'Neill run rampant over Rutgers. 
"That was definitely the way I wanted to go out," Battle grinned. "It was nice to see other guys get the ball." 
The seniors aren't finished yet. Even as Tyrone Willingham praised them for the tremendous leadership they demonstrated this season. he reminded them they still have mote work to do.

Holiday, offense exceptional in victory 
By JOE HETTLER 
Associate Spoirs Edi1or 
The coaches said it would take time. The players said it would tako time. They all said the Irish offense would take time to click with a now system. 
The time finally came Saturday against Rutgers. 
Carlyle Holiday and the Notre Dame offense had their most impressive perfor­mance of the season, gaining 468 yards scoring 42 poinls in a shutout victory over the Scarlet Knights. 
"We believed that at some point this season our offense would show its true potential." coach Tyrone Willingham said. "Today our offense did exactly that. Obviously, Carlyle Holidays performance passing was exceptional in the third quar­ter, and truthfully, throughout tho game. Our offense did a great job of playing the way I think they can." 
Holiday was 13-of-25 for 270 yards passing and a Notre Dame record-tying four touchdown passes. He also Jed the Irish to four third quarter touchdowns in less than 10 minutes, with three of those drives taking a combined 100 seconds to finish. 
lloliday credits his improvement to learning the now West Coast system more each week. 
'Tm at a stage right now where I know what I did wrong or I know what I was supposed Lo do and I think [offensive coor­dinator Bill Diedrick] sees that and he laughs about it sometimes," Holiday said. "Ile sees it as a good sign and I do too. It's just more comfortable to know that when you had something there, you can just go back and know what you have the next

determination to achieve perfect.ion. Hut ho has also been criticized for being a strict authoritarian and a power hungry egomaniac. 
This reputation emerged when he left tlrn Irish dance phenomena "Hivcrdancc" in which he was a lead dancer and choreographer. "Hiverdancc" exploded on the world scene as a seven-minute piece in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1994. But Flatley had lo share the spotlight and after six months he left the show blaming issues of arlistic control. Ile claims the producers of' "Hiverdance" wanted to incorporate all different nations into the show, while Flatley believed that an all Irish show could stand on its own. Unable to agree on any settlements, Flatley sued the pro­ducers or "Hiverdancc" for a percent­age of the revenues that he believed were right!'ully his. 
When Flatley began to envision his own project, he knew that he wanted the successor to "Hiverdance" to be more of a rock concert than a the­atrical performance. Wilh an origi­nal score by Honan llardiman and talented Irish dance champions from all over the world. Flatley began to see his detailed vision come to life. With his name above the title in "Lord of the Dance," Flatley became the star of the show -oiled, bare-chested and per­forming as the hero and savior of Irish dance with two beau­tifu I women competing for his attention in a flashy, 
male fantasy world. 
Since its world debut in Dublin on .July 2, 1996, "Lord of' the Dance" has met extreme international success. It broke London's famous Wembley Arena's performance record, selling out 21 shows. Opening in the United States at Hadio City Music Ilall where it sold out its f'irst 13 performances. "Lord of the Dance" went on to per­form at the 1997 Academy Awards. As a result of the success of the show, Flatley can afford to get over any hard feelings he had for "Hiverdance" since he has his own revenue sensa­tion. In 2000, with an exhausting schedule and rumors of failing health, Flatley performed in a final show of his tour "Feet of Flames," a magnified version of "Lord of the Dance" he created to draw attention to his final performance. 
Today, Flatley serves as artistic director and continues to oversee all aspects of the show and the numcr­
o us "Lord of the Dance" troupes. There arc two permanent dance troupes. one is currently touring Europe and the second is touring the United States. Flatley also recently signed a $250 million deal for the show to remain in The Venetian hotel and casino in Las Vegas. With an incredibly successful video and soundtrack CD, as well as overpriced merchandise -a dinky program costs $15 -total gross for Lord of the Dance is fast approaching $100 million. 
While Flatley has lived his life with an attitude of extreme confidence, he has introduced the world to the power of Irish dancing. lie is a hero for many Americans as a purveyor of Irish pride. Flatley awed the world and carried the show to its extraordi­nary success because of his incredi­ble talent, but without his command­ing stage presence as Lord the show seems to become nothing more than an extravagant mon­
eymaker.

Lions' odd coin toss call helps Bears to OT victory 
. Detroit wins toss and goes with wind; Bears get ball and Edinger kicks game-winning FG 
Associated Prrss 
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. Detroit took the wind and Chicago got the win. 
Sore-armed Jim Miller came off the bench to rescue the Bears, who benefitted from Detroit's unconventional over­time strategy Sunday to beat the Lions 20-17 and end an eight-game losing streak. 
Miller, playing with a sore right elbow. led the Bears to 10 points in the final 2:33 of regulation, featuring two great catches by Dez White, and Chicago (3-8) forced overtime on Paul Edinger's 22-yard field goal on the final play. 
After winning the coin toss to start overtime, the Lions (3­
8) decided to play defense first with a strong 17 mph wind at their backs instead of taking the ball. 
But given the ball first, Miller moved the Bears from their own 35 to the Detroit 22, hitting third down passes of 14 and 15 yards to Marty Booker and then connecting again

Irish blowout Bucknell, 73-42 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Sports Writer 
The way Torin Francis looked at his performance Saturday, the Irish freshman was just doing his job. 
But if his job includes setting freshman records, the Irish won't mind making sure Francis gets more work 
Francis grabbed 20. rebounds against Hucknell, the most any Irish freshman recorded since LaPhonso Ellis grabbed 18 in 1989, as the Irish rolled to a 73-42 victory Friday night. 
"That's just part of the game," said Francis, who fin­ished with 11 points. "It's just something you have to do." 
It was the third straight game the Irish played where their defense completely shut down their opponent, but it helped that they were facing a team that was horribly out­matched. Bucknell struggled to find the basket all night, only making 21.1 percent of their shots. 
The 42 points Notre Dame allowed were the fewest since 1999, when they gave up 42 to Valparaiso. And over their first three games, the Irish have allowed just 135 points, the fewest they allowed in the first three games of a season since 1947. 
But it helped that the Irish played a team that made more free throws (15) than field goals (12). 
The Irish were never seri­ously challenged, scoring the game's first seven points. Bucknell only got as close as five points with seven minutes left in the tirst half before the Irish reeled off a 16-point run to pull comfortably ahead. 
"I do like what we're doing defensively," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "We're working on that end and trying to defend." 
The game was a coming out this season for Chris Thomas, who seemed to be much more noticeably absent during Notre Dame's first two games. Thomas scored a game-high 20 points, the most he's scored all sea.son, to key the Irish offense. 
Thomas was fearless coming out of the locker room at half­time. scoring eight of Notre Dame's first 10 points to stretch a 40-21 halftime lead to a 50-24 lead. 
"I just felt like the last couple of games I've been passive," he said. "There's nothing wrong with that, but tonight as a team, we struggled offen­sively." 
Torrian Jones also had his most prolific scoring perfor­mance of the season. The junior guard finished with 13 points in 21 minutes played, often scoring on penetrating drives or when his teammates found him flashing underneath the basket. 
"I was patient, and it was a night where my drives were there," Jones said. "Guys were turning their backs on defense and I was picking my spots and finding them." 
Matt Carroll added 13 points and Dan Miller chipped in 12. 
Tom Timmermans returned to the Irish lineup after sitting out the first two games with back spasms. He played nine minutes, grabbing three rebounds and failing to score, and Brey said the Irish center wasn't quite back to 100 per­cent. 
The Irish have another quick turnaround, as they prepare to face Furman in the semifinals of the Guardians Classic tonight at 9:30 p.m. The Irish will then face either Creighton or IUPUI in the final or conso­lation round Tuesday night, depending on whether or not Notre Dame wins tonight. 
By Tuesday, the Irish will have squeezed in five games in 10 days. 
"Playing the games is great," Brey said. "But the slippage you get is you haven't prac­ticed much in the last week."

Irish expect strong finish at NCAAs 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Sports Writer 
For the first time in school his­tory, the Notre Dame womens cross-country team has a chance to finish in the top 10 in the NCAA Championships. 
Led by sophomore Lauren King and freshman Molly Huddle, the Irish have qualified for the national championships for the fourth time in the pro­gram's history, and their depth and performances this year have earned the team its place as the fifth ranked team in the nation. 
On Monday, at Terre Haute. they will attempt to conclude the season in the same manner they have run each of their previous races. 
"We're going in there on a p1·etty high note," Irish coach Tim Connelly said. "I thought our kids ran their best race of the season at [the regional finals in West Lafayette, Ind.]. We believe we have a shot at plac­ing really high.'" 
The team has seen steady improvement throughout the season, both in their races and workouts. 
"We know that the team is working really well and has 
been really good," King said. "Everyone's fit. The workouts have been going great. We know we're ready for this level of competition." 
Unlike past years, Notre Dame has expected success from the outset of this season. 
"I might not appreciate it as much as some of the upper­classmen. who know what the team has done before and how it's such a big improvement compared to where we've been," lluddle said. "The fresh­man class, our first season all we know is the best Notre Dame has been so far." 
Huddle is one of throe fresh­men that will run for the Irish today. 
"If you ask anyone of those freshmen, they"ll tell you that they expected tu be in the NCAAs when they decided to come to Notre Dame," Connelly said. 
Veteran Irish runner Jen Handley is the lone senior among the team's competing top runners. 
The Irish are fresh off the program's first victories at the Great Lakes Regional and the Big East Championships.

"Bill had some nice offensive play calls," said Siegfried coach John Torgenson. 
Bingle, Torgenson notes, has a keen knowledge of the game and calls all of the plays from the line of scrimmage. 
Alumni scored first on its second drive of the game. Running back Alex Roodhouse broke a 50-yard run on first down from the Dawgs 9-yard line. Roodhouse, who had 86 yards rushing and 14 yards receiving on the day, ended the drive with a 2-yard touch­down run. putting Alumni up 7-0.

receivers," said Ratchke. "He's a great quarterback." 
Alumni coach Steve Keppel saw an opportunistic Siegfried team that would not quit. 
"I think it was just them making big plays," Keppel said. "They were driving the ball on us [in the first half] but our defense was able to stop them. They just made some amazing catches towards the end. And their defense stepped up in the sec­ond half." 
Like its defense, the Alumni offense struggled as the game went on. 
The Alumni offensive output of the day more or less ended with the first-half touchdown. Bingle and Siegfried's offen­sive took over and kept the Dawgs offense off the field. When Chris Cottingham and the Alumni offense returned to the field, the Ramblers defense entered the game well-rested and shut the

Siegfried elected to spread the field and throw. 
"I was kind of surprised how easily we could pass," said Bingle. "They've been shutting everyone out, and we haven't been throwing quite so much the past couple games. Our receivers made some real good plays. Jack Kaup, Nate Ratchke, and Mike Wall, they're all over the place." 
Kaup, Bingle's go-to-guy all season, caught a 17-yard strike from Bingle in the back of the end zone to tie the game at 7 -7 in the third qu ar­ter. On the drive, Bingle com­pleted five of five passes, including three to Kaup.

A holding call on Alumni's first drive and a clipping penalty on the punt return to set up the Dawgs' final drive proved crucial to the game's outcome. The Siegfried defense buckled down after the first touchdown and did not let up. 
"We should have won by a lot more," said Bingle. "We pretty much dominated the game. We punch those first couple in and I don't think they'd have been around at all."

defeated Mia.mi 30-19, 31-29, 27­30, 30-19 to win i1S third consec­utive Big East Tournament title. 
"We absolutely wanted to play Miami for the title," outside hitter Emily Loomis said. "They really fired us up with their comments at the banquet." 
Loomis capped off the confer­ence season by winning the tour­nament's Most Outstanding Player award. Against the llurricancs, the sophomore from Fort Wayne, Ind. recorded game­highs in kills with 21 and hitting percentage of .462. 
The Irish (23-8) got off to a fast start, hitting an incredible .606 in game one and committing only one attack error. Loomis led the Irish with eight kills in the game. 
Alter dropping the first game in Saturday's 3-1 semifinal win over Connecticut, Notre Dame coach Debbie Brown knew her team needed to start strong. 
"It was really big for us to come out and_play well in game one after dropping the first game [against Connecticut]." Brown said. "rt was a confidence boost for the team. To hit .600 in one game is amazing. We were really on." 
Keeping the pressure on in game two. the Irish held a com­fortable margin throughout the game. The Hurricanes were down 29-25 and facing a 2-0 dis­advantage. Gelting a block, two kills and capitalizing on an Irish passing error, the Hurricanes tied the game at 29. 
But the top blocking team in the country used two of its 10 blocks in game two to win the last two points and take a two games to none lead in the match. 
"The blocking was huge at the end of game two, especially if you look at the way we won the game," Brown said. "Ten blocks in a game is another amazing sta­tistic." 
In game three, the Irish found themselves down 18-15 after a three-point Hurricane run. Closing the gap to one point three times, the Irish could never break through and were forced to a game four. 
Wanting to avoid a decisive game five, the Irish jumped on the Hurricanes (25-5) quickly scoring the game's first eight points and built a 20-8 lead. Miami forced Brown to use a timeout by scoring the next four points. 
Out of the timeout, the Irish scored five straight to regain con­trol of the game. Loomis closed out the match with her 35th kill of the weekend. 
Freshman middle blocker Lauren Brewster recorded a dou­ble-double against the Hurricanes with 15 kills and 12 blocks. Fellow freshman Lauren Kclbley had her second straight 15-kill match against the Hurricanes. 
The Irish used their imposing front line to force the Hurricanes into hitting .158 for the match. Big East Player of the Year Valeria Tippiana had 11 kills for the Hurricanes but hit only .025. 
With the win, the Irish qualify for their 11 th consecutive NCAA Tournament. which begins in two weeks.

having fun." 
Even when Kelhley makes one of her rare mistakes, she doesn't get mad. Instead she walks back to the team huddle with a smile. Brown doesn't yell at her players and get mad at them for making a mistake. She challenges them. In game three on Sunday, the Hurricanes built a five-point lead and looked to be running away with the game and grabbing the momentum. 
But Brown got off the bench and asked her team. "Are we gonna get this kill?,., 
While the Irish lost the game, they got that kill and stayed con­fident and happy. 
"The team is out there having fun and the captains have been a big part of that," Brown said. 
Maybe the smiles come from setter and captain Kristen Kinder who had to be told to set­tle ~own on the court by Brown numerous times because she was getting too excited. Maybe this confidence comes from the team seeing Brown questioning the officials on a debatable call and not jumping off the bench and earning a yellow card as two Miami coaches did Sunday. 
Maybe the smiles came from the fact ·the Irish saw Connecticut players with the deer-in-the-headlights look as the Irish won the last three games Saturday by 13. eight and 12 points. And when they accepted their Big East Tournament Champion T-shirts and plaques for the third straight year, the smiles got even bigger. 
'Tm just having some much fun out there," Loomis said. 
The Irish hope to continue having fun and gel past the sec­ond round of the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1995. And if not, there's a good chance Loomis will still be smiling.

MENS SOCCER 
Garcia scores 2 in 3-1 rematch victory over Akron 
By BRYAN KRONK 
Sports W rircr 
Rafael Garcia has been getting scoring opportunities all season long. For some reason, he just hasn't been able to con­vert them. 
Until Friday, that is. 
A senior playing in what may turn out to be his last game at Alumni Field, Garcia scored two goals for the Irish and fellow senior forward Erich Braun added a late insurance goal, as the Irish advanced into the second round of the NCAA Tournament with a 3-1 victory over Akron Friday night. 
"It was probably my last home game here, and I just wanted to come out and show them what I had and end it on a good note, and help my team advance to the next round," Garcia said. "I just wanted to come out here and win the game. Whatever it took ... I'm a team player. Tonight was my night to put the goals in and take us to the next round." 
With the two goals Friday night, Garcia doubled his goal output on the year. 
Notre Dame opened the scoring just under 15 minutes into the game, as Greg Martin drove down the left side of the field and booted a cross pass directly in front of the net. Garcia found the ball, and headed it on the ground towards the net. The ball bounced low to the ground and squirted between Akron goalie Dan Pinho's legs to give the Irish a 1-0 lead. 
"I think when he got that first goal he got a lot of confidence," Notre Dame coach Bobby Clark said. "He played a terrific game tonight." 
After an Akron goal 15 minutes later tied the game heading into halftime, the Irish took the opening kickoff of the sec­ond half and headed directly for the Akron goal. A breakaway for the Irish led to an Akron defender clearing the ball across his own net and nearly into the net, almost giving the Irish a lead 
WOMENS SOCCER 
just 15 seconds into the half. 
Both goalies were tested, as both Pinho and Irish goalie Chris Sawyer faced a barrage of shots on net. Halfway through the second half, a shot by Akron after a Notre Dame foul deep in its own end needed an acrobatic tip-out by Sawyer to prevent the Zips from taking the lead. 
"That was a phenomenal save," Clark said. "That's the difference. because suddenly, you're 2-1 down, but instead of 2-1 down it's still 1-1." 
Pinho finished the game with 10 saves while Sawyer grabbed six. 
With just under 22 minutes to play, the Irish broke the stalemate. Chad Riley sent a pass from along the left side to a charging Justin Detter down the middle of the field. Detter passed to a streaking Garcia in the right corner of the field, who fired a low shot past a charging Pinho and into the net. 
"It was amazing," Garcia said. "1 just saw the goalie slip and fall as the ball went [past the goalie and] into the side netting." 
'Ibe Irish added to that lead less than 12 minutes later. After an Akron turnover deep in the Irish defensive side of the field, the Irish mounted a break­away. After bringing the ball to just past the midfield line, Detter booted a pass to Braun, who slipped past an Akron defender and chipped the ball over Pinho -who was caught out of position and well away from the net. The ball eventu­ally rolled into the net to give the Irish a 3-1 lead. 
"[Braun] was very cool and calm [on the play}," Clark said. "I know it looked like an easy opportunity. but anyone who plays soccer knows that's not an easy one. He did that well, and it took the pressure off coming down the line, because if it had stayed at a one-goal game, it was going to be very hectic, and that kind of took the wind out of their sails." 
Braun's goal was his 11th of the sea-

Stanford's womens soccer team came into their third­round match with Notre Dame 
having allowed only four goals all season and the No. 1 ranked Cardinal showed why Saturday night, ending Notre Dame's

season with a 1-0 victory. The under­dog Irish 
played evenly with Stanford for 80 minutes thanks to brilliant play by goalkeeper Erika Bohn and gutsy play from a short­handed Irish squad. But Stanford's Marcia Wallis scored the game winner for Stanford with nine minutes left in regula­tion. 

Notre Dame lost All-American candidate Candace Chapman from the defense early in the first half, while junior midfielder Randi Scheller was forced from the game in the final minutes as the Irish continued to suffer

from the injury bug that has hurt the team all season. 
"Candace is a very spe­cial player who adds so much of a different dimension," said Irish coach Randy 
Waldrum. "When she went out of the game, that was a big blow for us. 
We were just piecemealing the group together at the end, and the depth just caught up with us." 
Freshman Maggie Manning replaced Chapman in the lineup. 
Manning entered in the midfield with sophomore Mary Boland moving back to the defense. 
The Irish came out in a differ­ent formation in the second half, dropping one of the forwards back into the midfield to make up for the loss of Chapman. 
"If we could have kept playing with three up front, we felt like we could throw something at them that they weren't used to seeing," said Waldrum. 
Despite the injuries and strong opponent, the Irish, who came out in green jerseys for the first time since the 1999 College Cup semifinals, battled Stanford equally throughout. The Cardinal held only a 6-5 advan­tage in shots on goal, with a 7-4 advantage in corner kicks. 
Stanford's score came off an Irish goal kick. Midfielder Callie Withers passed to Wallis who hit from 16 yards out. 
"If they did get shots, they were from pretty far out," said junior defender Melissa Tancredi. ''That was our game

Once again, the Irish defense stepped up as the clock ticked down, preventing any last-minute letdowns. Kevin Richards knocked away a potential last­minute goal opportunity for the Zips, and preserving the two-goal margin of victo­ry. 
"I thought all the seniors stepped up [tonight]." Clark said. "I thought [mid­fielder Justin Ratcliffe] had been strug­gling in the last few games, but he really had a very good game, and of course 
With the win, the Irish, after not achieving a victory in their first eight matches with Akron, have defeated the Zips in both matchups this year.

Stanford will ride a 14-game winning streak into the quarter­finals, having recorded 12 shutouts during that streak. 
"Stanford has a great team that is capable of winning it all," said Waldrum. "We have gone through an incredible year with as many as six or seven key peo­ple out ... and for us to make a run at the end of the year like we did, I'm really proud of our kids. They have been incredi­ble."

INTERHALL FOOTBALL 
Pyros, Ramblers bring home titles 
. Senior QB Coons leads PE to 7-6 victory over

Cavanaugh 
By HEATHER VAN

Sports Writer 
Senior quarterback Abbey Coons led Pasquerilla East out of the tunnel on Sunday and then led her team to vic­tory on the field. 
Coons was 13-of-23 passing for 135 yards and a touch­down to lead the Pyros over the Chaos 7-6 in an exciting interhall finale Sunday that went down to the wire. 
PE's only touchdown was scored by Kathryn Lent in the first half, who made an out­standing grab of a pass that was batted around in the end zone. Leslie Follmer caught the extra point. 
"It was a play that was drawn out very well," Coons said. "I had great protection from our offensive line, and I was waiting for something to open up. Kathryn slipped behind the defense, and luck­
.. 
ily she caught it." It took more than luck to beat a Cavanaugh team that didn't give up after the first half touchdown. And after

. Bingle leads Siegfried over Alumni, 14-7 
By PAT LEONARD 
Sports Writer 
Siegfried would go where Bill Bingle took them. He took them all the way. 
Bill Bingle dismantled the well-respected Dawgs defense and the Ramblers finished the season unde­feated with a 14-7 victory over Alumni to win the 2002 mens interhall cham­pionship. 
The Siegfried Ramblers threw the ball for over 150 yards and scored 14 points on an Alumni defense that had given up only 13 points all season. 
Bingle, who played wide receiver and back-up quar­terback last season for the Ramblers. captained the offense this year and took control of his team's des­tiny. 
He threw for 161 yards on 13-18 passing in the decid­ing game with Alumni, and his seven rushes for 50 yards were also crucial, and two scrambles of 21 and 22 yards jump-started separate Siegfried drives.

At the Big East awards banquet Friday night, a Hurricane volley­ball player told the crowd "the better team won" when her Miami team ended Notre Dame's 43-game Big East regular season winning streak last weekend.

PITTSBURGH 
In Saturday's Big East Tournament semifinal similar to the regular season match-up between the teams, the Irish dropped game one to Connecticut and gave the under­dog Huskies a chance to pull the upset. 
But the Irish were smiling. 
"We knew after game one that we Sports were better Columnist than them 

. Irish stay calm, have fun in winning 
in all aspects of the game," Big East Tournament Most Outstanding Player Emily Loomis said. 
Loomis led the Irish in kills and smiles this weekend. 
Every time she recorded one of her 35 kills, she turned to her teammates, threw her hand in the air and smiled. 
But Loomis was also smiling when the Irish couldn't make the block, committed a service error or when Irish coach Debbie Brown replaced her with defen­sive specialist Keara Coughlin in the back row. 
This smile comes from the atti­tude the Irish have built since day one. 
"The captains set the tone for us when we came in." Big East Rookie of the Year Lauren Kelbley said. "We are out there
