Saint Mary's increased recruitment boosts freshman enrollment 
By ANNELIESE WOOLFORD Saint Mary's News Editor 
After employing a new tactic to boost enrollment numbers, Saint Mary's College welcomes a freshman class of more stu­dents with better academic cre­dentials to its community this weekend. 
The Admission Office received 1,014 applications for admittance and accepted 828 students, 403 of which are offi­cially enrolled to begin their first year as full-time students. In comparison to last year's class size of 376, enrollment is up by seven percent, said Mary Pat Nolan, director of admis­sions. 
"In fact, we exceeded our goal," Nolan said. Four of the 403 women are international students, repre­
senting Guatemala, the Ivory Coast, Latvia and Uganda. One transfer student from Northern Ireland will also begin her studies at Saint Mary's this fall. The minority population of the freshman class is an estimated eight percent, with Hispanic students constituting the largest percentage. 
The Admission Office utilized a new tactic to engender such an enrollment jump. It pro­duced a series of "V-Mag" mag­azines delivered via the Internet to all accepted stu­dents. The series highlighted successful alumnae of the College, financial aid and affordability, the nature and benefits of a Catholic women's college and the relationship between Notre Dame and Saint Mary's.

Surruner reading required for ND frosh 

By JOE TROMBELLO News Writer 
In between internships and reality television, the Class of 2007 had another task to occu­py their summer vacation: required reading. 
For the first time, incoming Notre Dame freshmen complet­ed assigned reading in prepara­tion for an academic convoca­tion titled "The United States and the Middle East: Do We Face a 'Clash of Civilizations?'" Saint Mary's and Holy Cross Collngn did not require the assignment or a similar task for their freshman classes. 
Scott Appleby, professor of history and director of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, will moderate the Sept. 23 convocation discussing Seyyed Hossein Nasr's book "The Heart Of Islam: Enduring Values for Humanity" and four supplementary articles. 
Appleby said the reading requirement and convocation will introduce incoming fresh­man to how scholars analyze issues such as the tension between the United States and the Middle East. 
"The idea behind the summer reading requirement and acad­emic convocation was not to provide even one percent of the knowledge of the Middle East that professors ... provide in their courses -that would be impossible in so short an 



Transfers welcomed during orientation 
By CLAIRE HEININGER News Writer 

As 2,000 freshmen deseend on campus this weekend, about 160 transfer students will be familiarizing them­selves with campus and, for most, their off-campus hc)LJS­ing as well. 
Each transfer student enters with sophomore or junior status, depending on their previous college experi­ence. This semester, 159 transfers plan to enroll at Notre Dame -106 as sopho­mores, 52 as juniors and one as a first-semester senior. The total number of incom­ing students inereased by about 20 from last year, said Michael Gantt, the University's coordinator of transfer admissions. 
"Our transfer students come from all over," Gantt said. "It's always fun to see where they eome from ­community collegns, four­year schools and schools whieh speeialize in one par­ticular thing. Wn also get

INSIDE COLUMN 
Frosh-0 for Dummies 
Cut the next 500 words out and hang it right by your desk. Despite the insuf­ferable horde of 
brochures, speech­es, lectures and pamphlets you'll receive this week­end, this is your defmitive guide to life at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
First, right now, before you do any­

thing else, find an Andrew Soukup adhesive piece of 
paper. On it, please inscribe your Editor in Chief name, hometown 
and dorm, then affix the paper to your shirt. Putting the name of your intended major (also known as the academic discipline from which you intend to change) is optional. See how well you can interact with your fellow freshmen without having to ask for the answers to those four questions. 
Second, who do you think probably enjoyed their college experience ­someone who spent hours in the library studying minutiae to get a 4.0, or some­one who took time to talk with profes­sors to actually learn. the material? You're here to get an education, not to get good grades. There's a big differ­ence. 
Third, by going to school in South Bend, you unintentionally became a member of the illustrious Midwest. In this land of rolling hills and lovely win­ters, you'll quickly discover that we play card games called "euchre" and drink fluids called "pop." If you don't like it, get used to it. 
Fourth, figure out what you like to do, and then join the organization for that activity. Getting involved with a group outside your dorm is the best way to meet people. And it gives you some­thing to do besides playing solitaire on your computer. 
Fifth, ifyou haven't already, down­load AOL's Instant Messenger. There's nothing quite like sending messages to your roommate who is sitting four feet away from you-it preserves the vocal cords for Notre Dame football games. 
Sixth, congratulations on being vale­dictorian/class president/National Merit Finalist in high school. Just remember that yours is the most selective class in school history, and the person you're tooting your horn to is probably just as qualified to be here as you are. 
Seventh, please vacuum your room once in a blue moon, please take your laundry out of the machine within a minute after it's done 'and for the love of God, please flush the toilet. Your dorm mates (and the janitorial stam will thank you. 
Eighth, you're a freshman. That means you're entitled to make all sorts of silly mistakes. not know where build­ings are and preach from your soapbox. Don't worry about us upperclassmen silently chuckling in your direction; you'll be joining us in a few years. 
Ninth, you're on your own here. Your parents might want you to spend lots of time studying, but you don't have to. Your friends might want you to party eight nights a week, but you don't have to. You're in college now, which means you're supposed to be independent and responsible. 
Finally, make your own friends, and don't seek out the cliques that you loved as a high school student. Learn how to do things on your own, not have Mom do them for you. Pick a major you like, not one you think you need in order to make a six-figure salary. And ifyou don't know something, feel free to ask any question of anyone. 
Just don't ask why we call it pop.

software and other techniques to

The Blaster worm, which exploits a vulnerability in the lat­est Microsoft operating systems, has the potential to infect com­puters that have not been patched once they connect to the Internet. To respond to this threat, Notre Dame has prepared a limited number of patch CDs that will be available. 
Keith Folkes, director of infor­mation technology at Saint Mary's, said the College's tech­nology orientation will also address the issue of lile sharing. 
Notre Dame's session will not 
directly discuss illegal lile shar­
ing but will instead address the 
security implications of installing 
peer-to-peer file-sharing applica­
tions. 
The Recording Industry Association of America has begun to issue subpoenas to determine the identity of persons who arc using illegally-obtained, copyrighkd Iiles. with the inten­tion of filing lawsuits against these users. 
In the past, both schools have been issued "cease and desist" orders, which rcquin~ that users possessing copyrighted files delete them. In these cases. a student's identity was not dis­closed. However, a subpoena requires that the school turn over the name of the us1~r. which would put the oll'ender at risk of legal action. 
Notre Dame chief information oiTicer Gordon Wishoi1 said that. while the University's responsi­ble use policy has not changed. the climate of the music .industry targeting file sharing has changed. 

"We arc advising all students to think very carefully about the degree to which they put them­selves at legal risk by download­ing or sharing copyrighted Iiles." Wishon said.

Ethnic minorities compose 21 porcent of the incoming class with 4.5 percent, 8 per­cent. 7.5 percent and 1 percent being black, llispanic, Asian and Native American respec­tively. 
Saracino said Notre Dame's freshman classes are histori­cally strong with academic 
~ 
ability and geographic diversi­ty, whereas ethnic minority diversity was an area where Notre Dame has been weak. Minorities accounted for 17 percent of Notre Dame's undergraduate students in the spring 2003 semester. 
"We are great in so many areas but ethnic minority isn't where it should be," Saracino said. "Being a residential cam­pus, education is not just limit­ed to the classroom."

quite a few from lloly Cross and Saint Mary's." 
Similar to applicants for the incoming freshman class, transfer applicants must endure the rigors of the appli­cation process and meet climbing admissions stan­dards. 
"Transfers have high grades," Gantt said. "Typically, it's the students who have a 3.5 or higher." 
Unlike an applicant for the freshman class, transfers must apply to the colleges they want to enter. Gantt said the college makes a decision based on the compatibility of the transfer's courses to the college's cur­riculum. Transfer students must then complete at least half their degree requirements at Notre Dame to earn a diplo­ma. 
Recently, the most challeng­ing part of the transfer process has been the search for local housing. The steady increase in the size of the freshman class, as well as the trend of fewer juniors and seniors moving off-campus, combined to make most dorms at or very near their capacity. 
"The housing office has done everything they can," Gantt said. "They've turned study lounges into dorm rooms. Unfortunately, most of the transfer students will still be living off-campus." 
The Office of Residential Life and Housing attempts to assist the transfers who must seek off-campus living arrange­ments by referring them to University's off-campus hous­ing department. Mark Witschorik, a student transfer co-commissioner at Notre Dame, said the housing crunch is often the most diffi­cult thing to explain to arriv­ing transfer students. 

"They expect to live on cam­pus, and it's always a disap­pointment to tell them other­wise," Witschorik said. 
Witschorik and Ashley Bentzlin-Smith, a student transfer co-commissioner, designed an orientation pro­gram to ease transfers' adjust­ment to life on campus and selected a committee to run activities that is comparable to a typical dorm's Frosh-0 itin­erary. 
"Our major activities are called Huddles, which are mixers that help make the scramble to meet people a lit­tle mor-e focused," Witsehorik said. 
Transfer students also attend scheduled programs with their advisors, as well as a parent-student luncheon in South Dining Hall on Thursday with University President Father Edward Malloy and other administrators. 
"They explain what the Notre Dame environment is all about," Witschorik said. "We hope this whole weekend will help smooth the transition ­give transfers a home base right away to relate to." 
lloly Cross and Saint Mary's also will welcome 26 and 22 transfer students respectively.

During their search for Sharon, police discovered a Madison Center employee who may have talked to Sharon outside the hospital around 4 a.m. the morning after his disap­pearance. The employee said that an individual closely matching Sharon's description asked for directions to the nearest conve­nience store. The hospital worker directed the student to a local 7­Eleven. 
The investigation expanded to include searches of the area and the nearby Saint Joseph River, using dogs and helicopters, but turned up few additional leads. 
University officials offered a $25,000 reward, which was later increased to $50,000 with the help of local businesses, to encourage anyone with information about Sharon to come forward. 
Sharon's parents visited campus in January to meet with investiga­tors and students who might have been unwilling to speak with police. 
The search ended when local construction workers found a body floating under the Angela Bridge that was later identified as Sharon's. Though the river had been searched. police speculated that the body had been dislodged from elsewhere in the river by high winds the day before. An autopsy and blood tests later revealed that Sharon's blood alcohol content was 0.224, although it could have been lower at the time of death, and that foul play was likely not involved. For Sharon's family and friends. these unfortunate developments finally brought some closure to months of uncertainty, and hun­dreds of members of the Notre Dame community joined the Sharon family for a memorial Mass in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart February 25. 
Saint Mary's president retires 
Saint Mary's President Marilou Eldred officially announced her retirement March 5. 
Eldred became the 1Oth presi­dent and first laywoman president of the College upon her inaugura­tion in 1997. 
Since then. she helped to improve Saint Mary's itself, along with its relationship to the local community. 
With Eldred's supervision and initiative came the development of the College's Strategic Plan to improve the curriculum, technolo­gy and diversity of campus. 
Eldred also headed the develop­ment of the Master Plan, a renova­tion and construction effort to update facilities and meet the growing needs of the college com­munity at large. 
Eldred secured a $12 million grant loan from Lilly Endowment, Inc., which provided crucial fund­ing for the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership that opened in 2001. The Center is believed to be the only of its kind in colleges and universities across the country. 
Efforts such as these helped Saint Mary's earn the reputation as the nation's premier Catholic women's college. The College has received a number-one ranking for Midwest Liberal Arts Colleges by "U.S. News and World Report" for five of Eldred's six years at the helm of the College. 
"My experience at Saint Mary's has been fantastic," Eldred said. "It has been a privilege to lead this College to the next level; to work with our faculty and staff to pro­vide the highest quality education possible for the talented students who come to [Saint Mary's)." 
Eldred agreed to hold her posi­tion at the College until the Board of Trustees names her successor, which is expected to occur at some point in the 2003-04 academic year. 
Saint Mary's Reading Day 
After a 10-year student.govern­ment-led struggle, Saint Mary's Academic Affairs Committee finally approved the proposal to add read­ing days to the College's finals schedule. 
The approval will now allow Saint Mary's students the opportu­nity to work on projects, meet with professors and prepare for exams the Friday before finals week. 
War In Iraq 
While New York, Chicago and London erupted in anti-war and opinions. as well. 
Several students traveled to New York and Chicago to participate in protests while others organized forums and demonstrations on campus. 
Hundreds of students and faculty members. including Father Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus of Notre Dame, signed an anti-war petition started at Notre Dame. 
Pro-war, anti-war, pro-troops and pro-peace voices could be heard on both campuses. 
Though it is unclear whether anyone from the Notre Dame or Saint Mary's communities died in Operation Iraqi Freedom, several Notre Dame professors were sent to fight. A 2000 Notre Dame gradu­ate, Dustin Ferrell, was severely injured in a humvee accident in Iraq and is recovering in the United States. He was awarded a Purple Heart for his efforts. 
Scully resigns 
Following a reported leadership crisis in the University, Father Timothy Scully resigned as execu­tive vice president at the May Board of Trustees meeting. A com­mittee formed to investigate Scully's behavior was scheduled to deliver a report at the meeting. 
His resignation followed a January incident where he accost­ed a reporter and cameraman from WNDU-TV in the Fisher Hall parking lot before a Mass for then­missing freshman Chad Sharon. WNDU-TV is owned by the University and Scully was director of operations for the station. The cameraman said Scully smelled of alcohol when he approached them and told them to move their vehi­cles. Reporter Bonnie Druker filed a report with NDSP and later with­drew her complaint after Scully apologized. 
Scully will remain as a political science professor at Notre Dame.

"It's something we're seri­ously considering doing again," Nolan said. "In terms of other things we did, I think that was the most unique and cutting­edge. There was one other col­lege in the country that used the strategy, and that was Georgetown, so we were very excited to be able to participate in the project." 
In Nolan's opinion, the maga­zine was well received by both students and parents of the class of 2007, and Saint Mary's is looking forward to welcom­ing the class into its communi­ty. 
Ten women in the class of 2007 were the valedictorians of their high school graduating classes and six were salutatori­ans. 
The median SAT verbal score for the class ranged from 500 to 61 0 and the SAT math score was between 510 and 610. 
The average high school grade point average for the class was 3.69, an improve­ment from last year's 3.(J6. 
The incoming students repre­sent 35 states, with 29 percent concentrated in Indiana and 72 percent concentrated in the Midwest, including Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. 
"I think this group of women represent a geographic diversi­ty that will demonstrate a wealth of experience," Nolan said. "There is a wide range of gifts and special talents in these women and we're very excited that they're all here."

Of'fien of Undergraduate Admissions aeenptnd the same numbE~r of studnnts as last year but expnrienend a confirmation ratn of 59 pr~rennt-the highest in the pm;t fi~w years, Hiley said. Morr~ students are choosing to attend Notre Dame than ever

"Down the road, the University will have to look at housing and decide if thn present configuration will accommodate this if we have four years in a row," Chamblee said. 
But even with just two larger classes, the housing situation has been tight. Dormitories have had to convert study lounges into rooms and force triples, and more transfer stu­dents have been denied on­campus housing, said Scott Kachmarik, associate director of Hnsidence Life and Housing. 
"The raw number of people living ofT campus is higher than it has been, say, four years ago," Kachmarik said. "But if they weren't living ofT campus, I don't know where elc;e there is. 
Maintaining the community in terms of numbers is one thing, but maintaining the community in terms ofquality is another." 
Kachmarik said occupancy has been near or at 1 00 percent in recent years and University is looking into a strategic plan that includes the construetion of additional dorms within the next few years. 
But housing and residential issues are not the only aspects of thn UniversitY affected by ris­

Welcome to college. By now you are supposed to have moved into your dorm and "settled in" (with the exception of that poor guy whose belongings flew off the top of his par­ents' minivan on the Ohio Turnpike). 
Of course, being settled in just means that all of your things are in one room and that you have sheets on your bed. By the end of the year, that room will feel like home and you will have adjusted to all its quirks, whether that be coming to terms with the fact that it is smaller than a prison cell, learning to coexist with the 500 ladybugs that invade it or being able to ignore the bird that repeatedly flies into the window at six every morning. 
But what is supposed to happen between now and then? Obviously college is a learning experience ­otherwise your parents wouldn't have shelled out more than 30 grand for you to come here. Sure, you will have taken around 30 credits of classes, but a year of college is about much more than learning in the classroom. 
By the end of the year. I'd wager that most of you have learned other lessons. You will have learned how to live with another person, how to deal with conflict, how to deal with failure for the first time when that first math test gets returned to you.

and how much alcohol you can drink before you get sick (sorry hall staff. but it happens).

This is your college experience. Use these four years to find out what you want to do and what you like. Don't feel that you have to follow the paths that those before you set. The worst thing that could happen in your four years here would be for you to leave with a major that you don't like and hating the time you spent here (I promise these people will be in the minority). The best case scenario would be for you to have loved your four years here and be excited to enter the work force, but of course sad to leave.

Best of luck in the next four years. It will be a journey mixed with bumps, bruises, joy and elation. Keep on trucking through it all and cherish every minute. You'll be a senior before you know it.

The best time of your life 
There are two things that an incom­ing college freshman inevitably hears before he or she ever steps foot on cam­pus: 
1. "College is the best time of your

2. "These next four years will fly

Whoever gave you this advice­whether your par­ents, a friend or a random person you can't remem­


ber at your grad­AnneIiese uation party -is 
Woolford 

right. Add me to that list. 
I don't quite Saint Mary's knowhow and Editor when it hap­pened. but some­where along the way I found that I am having the time of my life and could barely catch my breath to realize it before entering senior year. 
I can still remember my first day at Saint Mary's like it was yesterday­meetingmy roommates and deciding whether or not they looked anything like the pictures they sent, unloading bag upon bag of bulk food after my mom went a little overboard shopping at Sam's Oub, the first meeting with Rebecca, our RA, and wondering "what are parietals?" No wonder my parents were so eager for me to go here. 
Later that night, a group of guys from St. Ed's clad in yellow T -shirts escorted about 50 of us to Stepan Center for "Domerfest," where I met one of my now best friends as he dragged me over to dance with him. Aside from visiting my brother when he went here. it was my first real Notre Dame experience ... one I could call my own. 
It's funny how the smallest things can stick with you, but they stick with you for a reason. Of all the memories accu­mulated over the past three years, both good and bad, I wouldn't trade a single one. 
It's impossible to know what these next four years of your life have in store. It's impossible for me to tell you. You can try to map out your entire col­lege experience. but I guarantee it'll turn out to be something completely dif­ferent. 
My best advice is to savor every minute and to take advantage of the opportunities that come your way. Trust me. there will be plenty. Go out on a limb and meet new people; experi­ence new things. The South Bend com­munity-more specifically Notre Dame and Saint Mary's-will become home for four very important. challenging and 
exciting years of your life­four years that seem like 
one. So what your parents and 
everyone else said is true. Things hap­
pen differ­ently for dif­ferent people, 

but college will be the best time of your life and it will fly by. Hopefully you can take my word for it until the day comes three years from now when you can admit it yourself.

SMC w-illing to help 
On behalf of the Student Government Association and the entire student body-wel­come to Saint Mary's. 
Orientation weekend is undoubtedly one of the most exciting and monumental weekends of your life -andalso incredibly hectic. You are beginning your college career and also learning your way around a new place. You have already received, and will continue to receive, lots of information and paperwork. The most impor­tant thing to remember is that every single per­son here at Saint Mary's, from your fellow Belles to the faculty and administration, is always will­ing to help you out with anything. 
You may contact your Student Government representatives in lots of ways -by calling the office at 284-5373, visiting the office in 304 Haggar College Center, e-mailing us at bog@saintmarys.edu, instant messaging at SMCBOG or by just stopping us around campus. We are hard to miss in our polo shirts. 
We invite you to become fully immersed in campus life. Involvement at Saint Mary's extends from the classroom to the athletic field and from clubs and organizations to attending our many plays, lectures and performances. Doing well in class is recognized as being very important here at SMC, but even higher regard­ed is the integrated learning experience that comes from being actively involved on campus. Activities Night on Wednesday, Sept. 3 is a per­fect opportunity to get in on the action. 
Please feel free to approach either of us at any time with any questions you have or just to say hello and introduce yourself-we look forward to meeting each and every one of you.

Beware ResLife 
You will dread it. You will despise it. You will come to fear .... the Office of Residence llie and Housing. And not just because they won't let you triple bunk. 
You have dreamt for 18 years of that distant world of individual freedom, that world where laundry did not have to be done, where money was not a problem-not one that you would acknowledge, anyway -and where the 

only responsibility you had was to have fun.  Pat Leonard  
Well, it's here. You have  
the power to do whatever you want with your life.  Sports Writer  
Want to lift weights?  

There are two athletic facilities. Want to study in a quiet place for that big test on Monday? Go to the Hesburgh library. Want to go to a Flipside event? Don't. They aren't fun. 
Flipside is led by admirable students who believe you can have just as much fun without alcohol in a social setting. Sobriety is cool. 

As much as I would like to support this cause due to its moral soundness, most students would and do "respectfully disagree." 
So this is where ResLife (many students' affectionate name for the organization} comes in. 

They agree with Flipside, wherein lies the problem for many drinkers, or, in their words, "raging alcoholics." Watch your back and keep ­a copy of duLac handy at all times. You never know when you may be breaking a rule, cross­ing the line or-gasp-having fun.

So be yourself 
Bienvenue! Willkommen! 
Many of' you haven't the slightest clue as to what these words mean. llave no fear, you will soon learn. The University requires most of you to take three semes­ters of' foreign 

language dur­David Barrett ing your tenure here, business and Viewpoint engineering Columnist majors being the exception. Those who do have to take the stan­dard three might be fortunate enough to have already earned credit towards them by scoring well on placement tests. Kudos to those fortunate few. Hegardless, you will graduate from Notre Dame with a debatable level of proficiency in some unnamed foreign tongue. Bienvenue? Willkommen? Well, I don't speak French or German. But luckily enough, devoted study to beginning and intermediate level Espaiiol has taught me their Spanish equivalent, Bienvenidos. Bienvenidos amigos. Welcome to Notre Dame. If all goes as planned, you will learn many great and not so great, quite pointless in fact. things dur­ing your years here. One of them is the absolute butt­pain that is nine credits of language. Clearly, the administration takes seriously ·its language requirenwnt. In my opin­ion. this most ghastly initia­tive is probably in response to the administra­tion's complete inability to lure true diversity to these lush lawns and hallowed halls. They thus compensate for this lack of diversity by creating their own in turn, substituting the real deal Spanish caballeros with aspiring Spanish speakers like myself. If only they carried it through. On my first day of introductory Spanish, my maestra told me and my fellow classmates that we would learn just three things that semester. First, we would learn how to make a most delicious salsa. Next, we would learn how to dance a most delicious salsa. Finally, we would learn lots and lots of vocabulary such that we might be able to simply sit there and talk about deli­cious salsa. And did we ever. Whew, we did. So yeah, you'll learn at least one great thing here. It might be Spanish. might be Latin, or might just be salsa, but it will be great. Another thing you will learn here will carry you far beyond the fine aroma and intoxicating rhythm of deli­cious salsa. It might take you a few years and might sound a bit cliche. but if you are lucky, you'lllearn how to be yourself. 
l remember those last few weeks before freshman year. I thought a fresh pair of cargo khakis, or perhaps a pair of faded, ultra-hip flair jeans would assure me unparalleled popu­larity amongst my freshman peers. I'd be the cool kid with the sweet jeans. You may have already noticed. but trendy clothes aren't going to set you apart. Your all-American looks and values won't either. No, here we're all great looking and God fearing. Take a look around. or at least this way. Right here, yea, what's happening? Call me sugar. 
You have to find something else to set you apart. Or better yet, hold onto that something else that always has. Doing your own thing is probably a large part of what got you here. It wasn't just the 4.0. the 1500, or the legacy, it was the extra-curriculars and the intangibles. Whether it was playing the flute or prancing around in a little tutu, whether you liked it or you hated it. Try not to lose it. 
Feel free to throw away the flute if you can't play it like you used to or get rid of the tutu if it just doesn't fit you anymore. Just make sure you do it because you want to and not simply because everybody else is doing it. Be yourself-you are a lot cooler that way. 
It took me a long time to finally realize 
that being "cool" is simply doing your own 
thing. There's something cool about that kid who volunteers and volunteers and volunteers. 
There's some­thing cool about the kid who 
writes poetry and the kid who stays up all night playing guitar. There's even something slightly cool about the kid 
who plays the flute. I stress slightly. So. from language 
requirements to salsa to being yourself, you are going to learn a lot about your­
self and a lot about your school. It is both easy and fun to nitpick about the school's few shortcomings, but now is not the time. 
Now is the time to get psyched about Notre Dame. It is time to skip classes, slam beers and stumble home. It is time to go to the chapel. ace your tests and help the homeless. Not the time to nitpick. 
I love to nitpick, but Notre Dame is totally awesome. It's easy to say, tra­dition, religion and so on. But it is so much more than that. It's the whole package, language requirements and all. Take any of that away and it's no longer Notre Dame. You'll see. You're going to love it. Just be yourself.

In four years you won't be the same person. That dynamic change begins now. 
You hit the ground running as a freshman. You break away from the tragedies and glories of high Andrew school and find 
DeBerry 

new ways of connecting to old friends and Viewpoint family. You're Columnist freer to be an individual and to focus more on your character than yourreputation.Theindependence can be disorienting, and students at Freshman Retreats describe similar struggles finding their way, whether in studying, activities. dating, party­ing or prayer. 
This is a key year to ask the bigger questions, to ask why often and dig deeply to determine even one's pur­pose for living. Scripture says simply that our ultimate purpose is to love God and each other. But determining how can be more difficult. 
Underclassmen are challenged right off to choose a major. Three questions must be asked. What are you good at? How can that bring you joy? And how can that be used to help others? The world has never had you before. You are needed to bring together unique talents and passions in a way never seen before. 
You may find many of your answers early in the Center for Social Concerns. The CSC is one little build­ing with a global reach. Discover inside life-saving work that satisfies the heart by joining diverse volunteer organizations that come together at the CSC. Find support for an activity you want to pursue. Learn about opportunities for student leadership. Or check out the service-learning immersion experiences over school breaks. Drop in for a visit, even if you don't think you're "into" service. Too many seniors graduate regretting not having been more involved at the Center. 
The spirit of this place will also leave an indelible mark on you. You quickly learn that no school can match the Irish spirit. That energy takes root in our school's unshakable faith. During good and bad moments, on momentous and ordinary days, in times of decision, worries, fierce anger, or delirious happiness, sit in the quiet of a chapel or the Basilica and listen to the secrets God whis­pers through the peace within. Or take refuge in the heart of our cam­pus, the Grotto. Discover why Doctor Dooley's words on plaque nearby, taken from his 1960 deathbed letter, asks, "Do the students ever appreci­ate what they have while they have it?" 
The Grotto is also where you will meet with your class one last time four years from now on the Thursday night before Graduation. In that gathering are likely to be friends you'll keep for life. friends who may be in your wedding and maybe even the one for whom you'll say, "I do." 
Parts of life here you don't like will shape you also. Generations preced­ing you complained about the weath­er, the administration, rules, a lack­ing cultural diversity, a difficult dat­ing scene and the infamous p-word. Yours will too. 
Maybe you will find inspiration in Notre Dame's own beginnings. Father Edward Sorin dared parching frosts. malaria, cholera, food short­ages and financial problems in begin­ning. Then a 1879 fire reduced most of his lifework to ashes. One account recalls Sorin's reaction: "There was absolute faith, confidence and resolu­tion in his very look and pose. 'If it were all gone, I should not give up!' were his words in closing. The effect was electric." 
In another account Sorin says, "I came here as a young man and dreamed of building a great universi· ty in honor of Our Lady. But I built it too small, and she had to burn it to the ground to make that point. So, tomorrow, as soon as the bricks cool. we will rebuild it, bigger and better than ever." 
Now our university is a renowned bastion of education and values. Our mission statement declares that the University seeks to cultivate in its students "a disciplined sensibility to the poverty, injustice and oppression that burden the lives of so many." 
If we graduate with a primary focus on having a successful career and a comfortable life. we arc not worthy to call ourselves alumni of Notre Dame. The founders and lead­ers have worked too hard, hoped too much and given too much life to the character that is the cornerstone of this University for us not to follow. 
As Gaddi Vasquez, the director of the Peace Corps, recently said, "You can be the generation that makes service to others a way of life and not a condition of having extra time on your hands. You can be the architect of hope for those with the greatest needs in our society and throughout the world." 
In you, the Class of 2007, is the power of mind and soul to make this happen. May God's passion fill each of your days here and may His pur­pose drive your every step.

One of the most important things to learn after eating the food at the prestigious dining halls of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's is where to go for some real food. We eat very well for college students who don't mind hav­ing three-day old cold pizza, but when you want to try a little more familiar fare, you need to know your options. Between South Bend and Mishawaka, there are plenty of places other than the dining hall to get some nourish­ment. 
The Staple of Any College Diet 
Pizza is as important to a college student as getting good grades, and many of your old favorite establish­ments have shop around here. 
Bruno's Pizza: A local joint, Bruno's is in both South Bend and Mishawaka and is a great place for both din­ing out and ordering in. They serve dinner from 4 to 10 
p.m. Sunday through Thursday and Friday and Saturday from 4 to 11 p.m. For delivery, make sure to call at least a half an hour before closing. Call (57 4) 273-3890. 
Domino's Pizza: Of all your options, this is the closest to campus. Until Sept. 1, they deliver on Mondays through Thursdays from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m., Friday from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m., Saturday from 2 p.m. to 1 a.m., and Sunday from 2 p.m. to 12 a.m. As of Sept. 1, their schedule changes and they are open an hour later every day, except for Sunday. Call (574) 271-0330. 
Marco's Pizza: With great cheesy bread and decent subs, Marco's is more than just a pizza place. They deliver Monday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 
11:30 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., and on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Call (574) 243-1122. 
Papa John's: This is the most popular pizza place to your average Notre Dame or Saint Mary's student. You'll likely find at least one in your dorm every week­end. They've got the latest hours in the area. an obvi­ous plus for late-night snacks. They deliver Monday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m., Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m., and Sunday from 12 
p.m. to 1 a.m. Call them at (57 4) 271-1177. 
Pizza Hut: As classic as they get, Pizza Hut is familiar to just about everybody. They claim to have "the best pizzas under one roof." They'll deliver from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to 12 
p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Call (574) 273-9944. 
Late-Night Cravings 
Nothing helps better on those late nights than keeping up your strength. And even if you get your homework done by six every night, sometimes it's fun to get out on the town and exercise your freedom. When it seems like most of the world is asleep, there are a few places 

Stepping ou 
An incoming student's survival gu · 
still going strong to offer you a place to hang out. The Huddle is open until 2 a.m. and Recker's is 24-hours, but when you want to get off campus, where do you go? 
Denny's is well known for serving breakfast at any time, but they have a broad menu over­all. The local Denny's is at 52626 US Highway 33, just north of Saint Mary's and the toll road ramp. Steak 'n Shake is on the cor­ner of Grape and Douglas, just a few miles east of cam­pus. It's well known for its thick shakes and famous "steak burgers." Denny's and Steak and Shake are both open 24 hours. 

Nick's Patio is also open 24 hours a day. It specializes in American grill food, has a nice atmosphere and fairly decent food.

serves as not only an airport, but also as a bus and train station. With flights to Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Atlanta, getting out of the Bend to wherever one needs to go is not difficult. 
For all the breaks, one can take a taxi to the airport, get a nice friend to drive or take a direct bus from campus to Chicago, making holiday transportation easier and, many times, less expensive. 
The local bus system is called Transpo and students without cars can utilize it to get to the mall and other places throughout the city. Maps and sched­ules are posted at the bus stops across cam­pus. 
Shopping 
Incoming students who are accustomed to big-city shopping will find South Bend sadly lacking in this area, but most students who aren't used to picking out clothes in Mall of America-type shopping centers will find the Bend more than ade­quate for average store runs. You'll find all your basic needs such as gro­ceries, dorm room sup­plies and furniture, drinks and SYR gifts.

Road Trips 

If you've already adopted an apathetic attitude toward classes by the time the first study days of your freshman year roll around, some road trips may be in order. There are also options close enough to be man­ageable as weekend trips on non-football weekends, for activities like concerts or legal drinking for 19-year­olds. 
The possibilities in Chicago arn endless and inelude parks, shopping, restaurants, museums, music and nightlife. The drive is less than two hours on 180-90, or you can take the South Shore Train if you don't want to worry about parking. Speaking of the shore, there's even an accessible beach for those missing the water. A trip to the Dunes is only an hour away, and you can even stay to camp for a small fee. 
Farther away but just as full of possibility, if not more, is Windsor. Two years until you're legal? Take a trip to Canada for gambling and nightlife, where the legal drinking age is 19. There are also more cultural attrac­tions like galleries, monuments and amus1~ment parks, all only four hours away. Also quito a drive, but well worth it for thrill seekers, is Cedar Point. Located in Sandusky, Ohio, Cedar Point has roller eoasters that put other amusement parks to shame, and the park stays open on weekends well into the fall. Check for times before heading out, at www.eedarpoint.com.

Should you need· immediate medical attention, the closest hospital is St. Joseph's. Most likely, the on-earn­pus University Health Services will be able to meet your needs. The Health Center is open at all times, while physicians are available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday through Friday. The Health Center, open 24 hours, is located near the main building.

Nowhere else but Notre Dame 
There are several places to worship on Notre Dame's cam­pus -in the dorm chapels, at the Basilica and inside Notre Dame Stadium. It's at these cher­ished grounds that Notre Dame's student body gives thanks to their sav­iors-Jesus Christ and Knute Rockne. From Notre Dame's first football game -a loss to Michigan in 1887-Irish fans have been obsessed with the pigskin. This is a place where the for­ward pass and four guys on horses became part of college football history. A place where opponents enter as No. 1 but 
.leave with dashed hopes and a blemished record. A place where football means more than a 100-yard field and two goal posts -it means tradi­tion. 


Just look around campus and you'll see how football has meshed itself into many ' aspects of Notre Dame. 
The library's mural was sup­posed to depict the Word of Life, with Jesus teaching his disciples on the 132-foot building. But when Notre Dame students looked at the mural, with a huge picture of 
J.C. and his hands raised, fac­ing the end zone of Notre Dame Stadium, it became too clear-The Savior of the World also did a side gig as a referee. Hence, "Touchdown Jesus" was born. 
Jesus isn't the only Biblical figure that has roots for the Irish. Directly beside the library is a sculpture of Moses created by Josef Turkalj. The sculpture is supposed to be Moses chastising the Israelites who had fallen into idolatry in his absence. Therefore. Moses' hand is pointed straight into the air to proclaim there is only one God. But the fact that he's facing Notre Dame Stadium disproves this theory. Instead, Irish fans know what Moses is really proclaiming-Notre Dame is No.1. 
Only at this place does a dri-ving wind die down for Irish kickers Gust ask Harry 0). Only here can you find a priest calling for a fair-catch (Corby Hall) or see where Reggie Brooks caught the game-win­ning 2-point conversion in the famous "Snow Bowl" in '92. And only here can you see the steps where George Gipp sup­posedly caught pneumonia (Washington Hall). inspiring Rockne's timeless "Win one for the Gipper" speech. 

It's here where you can walk between the Joyce Center and Notre Dame Stadium and take a picture with a man that didn't lose a football game for more than four years. Or go across the street to sit beside Mr. Notre Dame himself. Moose Krause. Inside the Joyce Center, you'll see the Walk of Fame with everything from bowl trophies to classic pictures. 
It's here where dorms have tryouts and cuts for their respective interhall football teams. Where these teams play in full contact, usually have at least one coach and several referees at games and compete for a chance to play the championship game inside Notre Dame Stadium. Every Sunday, hundreds of students flock to the interhall fields to watch their friends and room­mates knock each other around. mous with the words Notre

NOTRE DAME OPPONENT PREVIEW 
Michigan offense is strong, but questions persist on 'D' 
Associated Press 
ANN AHBOR, Mich. Michigan hasn't played in the Hose Bowl since Jan. 1, 1998, when they beat Washington and earned The Associated Press' national championship. 
If Michigan doesn't go to the Hose Bowl this season, it will have gone six years without a trip to Pasadena, Calif., for the first time since 1965. 
Michigan's offense is expect­ed to be dominating. 
Four returning starters on the offensive line will be in front of quarterback John Navarre, a 29-game starter. running back Chris Perry, coming off a career year. and receiver Bray Ion Edwards. whose production matched his talent last season. 
If Michigan can find service­able replacements for tight end Bennie Joppru and fullback B.J. Askew, it could have one of the best offenses in team history. 
There are question marks about the defense, however. 
Carl Diggs is one of the many linebackers coming off injury, and just four starters return to the defensive line and sec­ondary. 
Safety Marlin Jackson, cor­nerbacks Markus Curry and Jeremy LeSueur along with defensive end Larry Stevens will be counted on to be stand­outs. 
Another question on defense is how-or if-Jackson will be punished by Michigan coach Lloyd Carr for pleading guilty to aggravated assault earlier this month in a plea agreement. 
The Big Ten's preseason defensive player of the year, who moved from cornerback to safe­ty, was accused of striking a man in the right eye with a bottle. He said he punched the man, but did not strike him with a bottle, and Carr said a lie-detector test supported Jackson's claim. 
Michigan State 

Michigan State hopes this is the year of the comeback for the Spartans. 
The team is coming off a horri­ble season on the field and an embarrassing one off it. 
Quarterback Jeff Smoker is back as the starter after a sub­stance-abuse problem cut short his junior season. And running back Tyrell Dortch hasn't played in nearly two years after break­ing his right leg in gruesome fashion. 
The Spartans started last sea­son with hype and high expecta­tions, with some even believing they could wind up at the Rose Bowl for the first time since 1988. 
Michigan State was ranked 15th after a 2-0 start, but fin­ished 4-8 overall -its worst record in 11 years. 
Coach Bobby Williams was fired with three games remain­ing as his program collapsed against opponents and was in internal disarray. 
Smoker was kicked off the

usc 
After six years of uncharacter­
istic med iocri ty, Southern 
California suddenly returned to 
national prominence last season 
as one of college football's elite 
teams. 
The Trojans appear to have 
the talent and depth to stay 
there. 
But as always, there arc ques­
tions, especially at quarterback, 
where they have to replace 
I Ieisman Trophy winner Carson 
Palmer. 
And recent history says Pac-10 
teams without significant experi­
ence there fall short. 
Third-year sophomore Matt 
Leinart is expected to start Aug. 
30 when the eighth-ranked 
Trojans open at No. 6 Auburn. 
Leinart hasn't thrown a pass 
that counts since high school, 
but as USC coach Pete Carroll 
put it: "Matt comes in as our 
leader. It's his job to lose." 
The Trojans were 11-2 last season, winning their last eight games after a 30-27 overtime loss to Washington State that cost them the Pac-1 0 title. 
Before the winning streak, USC was 9-8 under Carroll and 40-37 since the beginning of the 1996 season -a major comedown for a school with eight national titles and 28 Rose Bowl appearances. 
The Trojans demolished UCLA. Notre Dame and Iowa in the Orange Bowl in their last three games and finished fourth in the final Associated Press poll. 
Fourteen starters return 
including six on a defense that 
figures to be among the nation's 
finest. 
Florida State 
Media favorite Bobby Bowden hasn't been quite as approach­able lately. 
The 73-year-old Florida State coach has endured the gambling trial of former quarterback Adrian McPherson, been swin­dled out of $1.6 million by his eldest son and taken hits by some who believe he's. lost con­trol of the storied football pro­gram-on and off the field. 
Bowden even told his secretary he wasn't returning calls -for the entire summer. 
How about his team, which has lost a total of nine games the last two seasons and been bumped from the list of perenni­al Top 10 teams? 

The Seminoles have won 10 of 11 ACC crowns since joining the league in 1992, but the domi­.­nance appears to be ending. North Carolina State, Maryland and Virginia should challenge Florida State for the league championship in 2003. 
Florida State's inconsistency the last two seasons has come on defense and from the quarter­back position, two areas where the Seminoles have excelled for most of Bowden's 27 years in Tallahassee. The defense will see 10 starters return this year.

"They have to rise from the bottom to the top, and that's not a bad thing," Willingham said. "They have a chance to turn a momentary negative into a positive." 
For now. however. freshmen scramble to earn time on a practice field that belongs to a team gearing up for its Sept. 6 season opener against Washington State. 
Last year, only receivers Maurice Stovall and Hhema McKnight saw action as fresh­men. A man who says the best players will play, Willingham said he expects some freshmen will see playing time this fall, but he's reluctant to discuss specific players. 
Still, the Irish have a talented crop of recruits entering Notre Dame this fall. Olsen was one of the nation's most sought-after tight end recruits and Dublin, Ohio, quarterback Brady Quinn was ranked 20th on ESPN's list of the top 100 national recruits. 
Other freshmen who could 
see some playing time this year include defensive linemen Victor Abiamiri and Trevor Laws and defensive backs Freddie Parish and Tom Zbikowski. 
"It's tough for every freshmen coming in, no matter where you go and what you're like coming in here," Olsen said. "It's a whole different game from high school, from the speed to the size of the guys to the complexi­ty of the ofTense.

Notre Dame returns six experienced players from last season, in addition to Jeneka Joyce and Monique Hernandez. Joyce sat out last year with nagging injuries, while Hernandez did. not participate on last year's team, after being on the roster the previous two years. 
"We're really in a good situa­tion," McGraw said. "We don't have to rely on the freshmen immediately and I think the freshmen are going to push the veterans for playing time ... This is as much depth as we've ever had." 
Senior La'Tania Severe, juniors Jacqueline Batteast, Katy Flecky and Teresa Borton and sopho­mores Megan Duffy and Courtney LaVere will make the Irish an experienced club. All six of these players played signifi­cant minutes for the 2002-03 Irish and each started on numer­ous occasions. With the addition of three talented freshmen, McGraw can't help but be excited for the start of the season. 
"We really saw our potential at the end of last season and it real­ly gave us a shot of confidence," McGraw said. "There's a lot more excitement. But nationally, there's a lot of good teams out there so we really have to get our work ethic and work hard towards our goals."

This Irish team looks deep on paper, but so did last year's squad. Injuries took their toll on the Irish in the 2002-03 season, but Waldrum believes that adversity may have been a good thing. 
"There were several time-s throughout the season where our team could have just quit, but they didn't," he said. "I think that shows a lot of our charac­ter." 
Injuries and bad luck could still play a factor for the Irish this season, but Waldrum believes his team is much more suited to deal with such problems now. 
"The problem with last year was that we just didn't have the depth," he said. 
But with a mix of both accom­plished veterans and anxious youth, depth shouldn't be a problem any more.

MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY 
Healthy Irish return six of seven top runners in 2003 
ByJOE LINDSLEY 
Spons Writer 
After losing only one of their top seven to graduation, the Irish harriers are planning to be in Cedar Falls, Iowa, for the national championships come November. 
Last year, the Irish finished 22nd after just barely qualify­ing for the NCAA title race. 
"Our expectations are that we return to the NCAAs, like we did last year. We graduate only our seventh man off of that team [John Keane]," Irish coach Joe Piane said. 
Piane, who is entering his 28th season at the helm of the Irish, believes the team has several promising prospects for the empty slot among the team's top runners. 
Junior Sean O'Donnell, who has "trained exceptionally well," according to Piane, posted an 8:25 performance in the 3,000-meter run at the Big East track championships last spring. Additionally, Kaleb van Ort looks to be another contender for Notre Dame. 
"[Van Ort] had a very nice track season, but struggled in cross country, frankly because he was sick" Piane said. "One of those guys cer­tainly can replace our seventh man." 
The Irish have one very promising incoming freshman who is expected to compete with the team's best talent. 
Freshman Kurt Benninger, a two-time member of the Canadian national cross coun­try team, competed in the world cross country champi­onships and was a silver medalist in the recent Pan Am Junior Championships, during which he completed the 1,600-meter race in 3:49. 
Irish All-American Todd Mobley, after suffering an injury last fall that seemed to have a negative effect on his teammates morale and per­formances, is completely healthy as he enters his senior season. Mobley fin­ished 80th, and 61st in team scoring, at the NCAA Championships last year. The Irish will also count on sopho­more Tim Moore, who led the Irish at nationals last year with his 63rd-place finish. 
"I think we'll have a much better year when everyone knows that you have a healthy Todd Mobley, Tim Moore and Kurt Benninger up front," Piane said. "That's got to inspire everyone to run well. As a team, we're going to do exceptional." · 
Another reason for a posi­tive outlook for the upcoming season is the fact the Irish will be competing for the Big East Championships at Van Boston, while they have cap­especially competitive event, Cortland Park in the Bronx, tured several conference titles Mobley, Moore and Benninger

Brey eager to work with incoming freshman class 
By MATT LOZAR

Mike Brey hasn't seen his three incoming freshmen par­ticipate in on-campus summer scrimmages, but the reports from his team captains leave court contact with his team Brey eager to begin practices. over the summer. Notre Dame's And this year, the fourth-year four captains -seniors Tom head coach of the Irish will be Timmermans and Torrian allowed to participate in those Jones and juniors Chris Thomas practices sooner. and Jordan Cornette -kept

how the new blood fit in with the returning players. 
This season, Brey will start practices with his players a month earlier than usual. Once every four years, the NCAA allows a school to participate in a foreign tour. Over the October semester break, Brey and the 
Irish will be off to Barbados for their first trip abroad since 1996. 
"The nice part about doing the foreign tour during the school year is that the incoming freshmen are here so we can take them on the foreign tour," Brey said. "If it was during the summer, then [freshmen Colin[ Falls, [Russell] Carter and [Omari] Israel would not be able to attend it. Usually, I can't watch our team until mid­October." 
Brey knows what he has in his core players, but the September practices will allow Brey and his staff to do a num­ber of things -experiment rebounds {569). Last season, Falls averaged 25.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists a game. 
"I think Colin Falls really impressed our captains with his overall feel for the game. Then you add that he is a really great shooter with deep range," Brey said. "There is certainly a need for that after losing Matt Carroll. I think a guy like Colin can become very important for us as the new face we need the most." 
During the summer sessions, Falls felt the biggest on-court difference between high school and college was an obvious one -the pace of' the game. 
"It was a really good experi­ence to meet all the players and get to play with them," Falls said. "I knew what kind of role l would play, but the players are faster, bigger, stronger and quicker. I kind of knew it was coming, but that was definitely 
the biggest 
change."

participated in the summer scrimmages, including junior Chris Thomas, who enrolled in summer school and came back to the Irish after withdrawing his name from the NBA Draft on June 16. 
To replace senior captain and dead-eye shooter Matt Carroll, Brey is looking to the 6-foot-4 Falls from Loyola Academy in Park Ridge, Ill. Falls left Loyola as the school's leading scorer (2,045 points), and at the top of the school's record books in three-pointers (209), free throw percentage (.840) and

3.4 assists as a senior. 
"I think it was a good break­

think he learned how to play at 
this level, with the intensity," 
Brey said of the summer prac­
tice. "He isn't the No. 1 option 
anymore as he was in high 
school. 
"He has an athletic body, sim­ilar to a Jones, can really defend, and has the ability to score. He scored a lot of points in high school." 
Israel is the third freshman from the Class of 2007, but Brey is considering putting Israel on a five-year plan simi­lar to sophomore and similarly­named sophomore Omari Peterkin. Israel tore his anteri­or cruciate ligament in January and missed the remainder of his senior season. Brey will determine what to do with Israel when the team practices next month. 
As practice is scheduled to begin in a month, Brey will have more time to find replace­ments for Carroll and departed guard Dan Miller's outside shooting. Meanwhile. the fresh­men will have more time to get ready for when the games real­ly count. 
"One of the new faces is' going to have to be in there whether it is Russell or Colin. I don't know if they have to start. We asked a lot out of Chris Quinn last year and he delivered," Brey said. "Whether he played 20 minutes one night or six, he always came to play. We need one of our freshman stars to have that maturity level and give us that. 
"Maybe two of them will give that to us over the course of the season, and I think that is where the foreign tour helps us. it allows us to pick up some experience. It almost gets them a season under their belts before the season starts."

SMC SOCCER 

Nevv head coach, returning players have high hopes 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's soccer team returns its leading scorer and brings in a new coach to open the 2003 season. The new blend of coach and players will meet its first test on Aug. 30 at Marietta College versus the State University of New York. 
Coach Peter Haring, in his first year as head coach of the Belles after working as an assistant at Valparaiso University, has an impressive resume that includes leading the girls MSA Mystique Premier U-17 team to a 20-7-2 record in two seasons. Haring was in charge of "keeper train­ing, recruiting and strength and conditioning" at Valparaiso. 

''I'm definitely excited," Haring said. ''I'm coming into a good sit­uation because the team has so much depth with so many returning players." 
The Belles return their top offensive players from 2002. First team all-MIAA forward Jen Concannon tallied a team-high 30 points and 12 goals last sea­son. 
"A player like Jen Concannon is going to add a lot of leadership and bring a new level of intensi­ty," Haring said. "Returning players bring experience." 
The Belles lose second-team all-MIAA sweeper and "field gen­eral" Lynn Taylor to graduation, but they return numerous starters and have solid talent in the incoming class. 
"With Taylor leaving, [sopho­more] Carrie Orr [ten points, four goals] will be taking over that role," Haring said. "That will be one of the more impor­tant roles on the field this sea­son. as Carrie tries to fill some big.shoes." 
Other returning players include second-team all-MIAA senior forward Wendy Irvin (19 points, nine goals) and junior midfielder Emily Wagoner (nine points, three goals). 
Despite the positives created by many returning contributors, Haring says the most significant addition to this year's team is its depth. 
Incoming freshmen like out­side midfielder Megan and attacker Carolyn Logan are mak­ing an immediate impression. 

Ashley Hinton and Colleen Courtney will add much needed depth to the defense. 
"Now we just have to piece all this together and make it work," Haring said. "The team has a lot of potential to do a lot of good things and make a strong bid for the conference title." 
The Belles finished below .500 overall .and in league play with a 7-10-2 record (5-7-2) last season.

Belles train in off-season, add transfer from Marist College 
By PAT LEONARD Spores Writer 
Saint Mary's coach Julie Schroeder-Biek could have frowned on her team's 7-21 record last season. 
She could have worried over its 1-13 MIAA conference record. 
Instead, the Belles' coach is all smiles over her players' off-sea­son work ethic. 
"Last year we were still in the early stages of rebuilding the program," Schroeder-Biek said. "The focus was on improvement, and we did not pay as much attention to the record. But we made big improvements individ­ually." 
Aware of-but not haunted by-the results of the 2002 sea­son, the team is now more focused than ever. 
"The returners showed great commitment over the summer. They came back in great shape and ready to compete," she said. "Now, the incoming freshmen are following their lead and working at their pace." 
It has been quite a pace. 
In fact, a handful of freshmen e-mailed their summer workouts to Schroeder-Biek as proof of their dedication. In particular, incoming freshman Kristen Playko has impressed the coach. An all-state outside attacker and state champion from Norwalk, Ohio, Playko has entered presea­son practice "really strong." 
Perhaps the most significant addition to the team is that of sophomore transfer Michelle Turley from Division-! Marist College. Turley will play several different positions in practice before coaches decide where she will play when the season begins.

The team plays first on Aug. 30 at the Saint Mary's College Triangular, a round-robin tour­nament between Saint Mary's, the University of Chicago and Goshen. 
While the freshmen and trans­fer become acclimated to team play, the returning starters must take charge as they have in the preseason. 
Outside attacker Alison Shevik led the team last season in kills 
(180) and digs (350). She and players like 5-foot-1 0 Ellise Rupright, the team leader in attack percentage (.205), aces 
(45) and total blocks (88), will be the leaders. 
Not returning to the team is assist leader and setter Bridgette Wakaruk, who had 554 assists last season but plans to transfer to another school, according to Schroeder-Biek. 
The main focus, then, will be replacing Wakaruk. 
"[Junior] Stacey [Stark] filled that role last year. She had never played setter before, but she has very good control," the coach said. "This year we are trying to use her in the right side attacking position."

Huddle, King lead pack of returning, experienced runners 
ByJOE LINDSLEY Sports Writer 
After a season in which the Irish achieved their best-ever performance by claiming third at the NCAA champi­onships, Notre Dame has high expectations for the approaching fall season. 
Especially promising for the team is that out of the top f1ve runners at that race, only one or them, Ana Morales. was a senior. The Irish will retain, among oth­ers, their top duo ol' Molly Huddle and Lauren King. 
Huddle earned her first and King her second All­America honor at the nation­al title race last year in Terre Haute, Ind. as they led the Irish with their 6th and 14th place finishes, respec­tively. Throughout the '02 season, Huddle and King were atop the Irish lineup, though not always in the same order. 
Huddle's finish at the national championships, just 12 seconds behind individual champion Shalane Flanagan of North Carolina, was the highest for a female Irish runner since Joanna Deeter's third place finish in 1996. Like Huddle, Deeter was a freshman at the time. 
King also had impressive accomplishments last fall. including her victory at the Big East Championships, which was the first Irish individual title in that event 
since 1995. The duo, along with Stephanie Madia, Katie Wales and Jean Marinangeli, gave Notre Dame women's cross country its first ever Big East conference title in the program's 16-year histo­ry. 
The Irish still have a few weeks before their fall sea­son is inaugurated with the Valpraiso Invitational Sept. 
5. Notre Dame will likely have its first taste of national championship caliber compe­tition Oct. 3 at the Burke Memorial Golf Course when the Irish host the Notre Dame Invitational. Last sea­son, the Stanford Cardinal, who finished second at the NCAA Championships, took the title at the annual Irish Invitational.

"That's what other people see," Clark said. "We've built up our stock, and now people think we can be good, but we have to keep making deposits." 
Keeping with the head coach's metaphor, midfielder Greg Martin would perhaps be the team's accountant. Martin, a senior, will hold the duties of captain for the third straight year.

The Irish open the season Saturday with an exhibition match against No.11 Saint Louis and then begin regular season play at the adidas/IU Credit Union Classic in Bloomington, Ind., on Aug. 29 against Alabama-Birmingham and Aug. 30 against No.17 California.

In addition to Martin and the six other seniors, junior goalkeeper Chris Sawyer will also play an important role on the team. Sawyer was named the Big East preseason goalkeeper of the year. 
Last year, Sawyer started 16 of the 21 games in goal for the Irish, and collected a 0.99 goals against average and .754 save percentage, allow­ing 16 goals and making 49 saves.

Irish looking to rebound from last year's disappointing finish 
More experience, new faces hope to take Irish to the next level 

By MATT LOZAR 
Associate Sports Editor 
After ending its season in disappointing fashion by los­ing in the second round of the NCAA Tournament at the Joyce Center. Notre Dame coach Debbie Brown only lost two seniors to graduation and gained one new face for her 2003 team. 
Last year, Brown needed to give two of her six freshmen heavy minutes on the front line. The experience gained by Lauren Kelbley and Lauren Brewster. who each started all but three matches throughout the fall season. and by other current sopho­mores in the spring season gives Brown a more experi­enced squad right from the start in 2003. 
"It's huge, and that's impor­tant." Brown said. "I think in particular. Lauren Kelbley and Lauren Brewster come in with significant playing time, Meg Henican played in pretty much every match in a lot of different pressure situations. Kelly Burrell and Carolyn Cooper played a lot in the spring and Carolyn improved a lot. All are coming in much better players." 
The only freshman joining the team this year is Danielle 
Herndon from Plant City, Fla. Even though Brown only has one new face on a team returning almost all of its players, she isn't shy about her plans for Herndon. 
"We are going to throw her right in there," Brown said. "She plays libero for us. There are obviously some changes, but she has adapted well. She is really fast. and I feel she can be put in right away." 
In 2002. Keara Coughlin and Janie Alderete primarily played the libero position for the Irish with Henican and Jessica Kinder also seeing

FOOTBALL 
Playing by the rules 
New regulations make all players report on same day 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
Greg Olsen arrived on cam­pus two weeks ago, carrying plenty of advice on what to expect in fall football camp from his older brother Chris. 
But when Chris -now a sophomore backup quarterback -came to Notre Dame last fall, he and the rest of his freshman class practiced for three days before the rest of the team arrived. 
During that time, the elder Olsen had a handful of prac­tkes where he could attempt to digest the 400-plus-page play­book before getting thrown into the fire and toward the bottom of the depth chart. 
!lis younger brother, a tight end, did not have that luxury. 
A series of NCAA rule changes designed to prevent heat-related problems involving athletes went into effect this year. While most of the changes dealt with the amount of time a team can spend practicing in a day and the number of two-a­day practices that can be held, one clause removed the tradi­tional orientation period for freshmen football players. 
So when Greg Olsen and the other 21 freshmen first stepped onto a practice field Aug. 4 wearing a gold helmet, they were joined by their upperclass teammates -each of whom had a much better understand­ing of how Notre Dame football worked. 
"Your adrenaline was kind of pumping because you were thrown in there with the other guys, and it was like it was going 90 miles an hour, just trying to figure out where you were supposed to line up that first day," Olsen said. "It was kind of hectic, but it was also exciting at the same time." 
Irish coach Tyrone Willingham has adopted a wait­and-see approach before voic­ing an opinion on the new prac­tice regulations. 
But he acknowledged that the new rules hamper freshmen participation in practices and make it tougher for them to play snaps in practice. 
"At least before, there was a pari where they had a chance to improve themselves on their own before the rest of the team arrived," Willingham said. "Now, you don't have a chance to gain some of that confi­dence." 
The NCAA did allow for teams to hold one three-hour practice for freshmen separate from the rest of the team -a far cry from the four practices previous freshmen enjoyed. 
But in trademark Willingham fashion, the Irish coach believes the adversity the cur­rent crop of freshmen faces may become advantageous in

Waldrum optimistic about season 
ByJUSTIN SCHUVER Sports Writer 
In 2002, the Irish may have hurt their bodies, but they didn't hurt their postseason chances. 
Last year, the team overcame a slew of injuries -players missed 64 games due to injury -to advance to the NCAA Tournament, only to lose a heartbreaker to top-ranked Stanford in the third round. The game was tied until Stanford scored in the 81st minute to earn a 1-0 win over the Irish. 
That kind of determination didn't go unnoticed. 
Notre Dame comes into this season ranked 10th in the National Soccer Coaches Association of America presea­son poll, partly due to a recruit­ing class thai was ranked fifth in the nation by Soccer America. 
"This class has been great," coach Randy Waldrum said of his 10 freshmen. "They've got us all very excited around here." 
Waldrum especially lauded the play of Illinois natives Jen Buczkoswki, Kim Lorenzen,and Jill Krivacek. 
The three were part of the Illinois team that won the 2003 Olympic Development Program national title. Interestingly enough, the Illinois team defeat­ed a team from New Jersey, which featured another Irish freshman this year, midfielder Lizzie Reed. 
Waldrum said that Buczkowski "can play any­where," and that Lorenzen can also play several positions with skill. 
"When you're versatile," he
