Rossie Asks Admin. To V·oid Directive 
By JOEL CONNELLY 
Student Body President Rich­ard Rossie last night asked Rev. Charles I. McCarragher, CSC, Un­iversity Vice President for Student Affairs, to revoke a set of dem­
onstration rules issued Monday by Notre Dame Dean of Students Rev. James L. Riehle. 
Rossie also drafted an exec­utive order for use if McCarragher or Riehle do not revoke the directive. According to the Stu­dent Body President, the order "states the official policy of student government and revokes the directive." Rossie, however, made clear that no action is planned until he sees Riehle. However, Action Student Party 

Chairman Jon Sherry stated that is action is not taken immed­iately a test demonstration will be held. 
Emerging from an hour long meeting with McCarragher,Rossic stated "lt was a run-around". The Student Body President also said "He asked that I talk to Fr. Riehle before I did anything else." As to the origins of the directive on demonstrations, Ros­
sie remarked "I asked Fr. Mc­
Carragher what prompted the 
necessity for a policy on dem­
onstrations now. He said there 
is the May 7 demonstration and 
Fr. Hesburgh's order that there 
be a policy on demonstrations." 
Commenting specifically on 
the directive, Rossie contended: 
"If the Administration denies. 
a student's rights, we would in 
turn have to observe the Admin­
istration's right to require us to 
register 24 hours in advance to 
protest their denial of the student 
of his rights." 
Reflecting further on the 24 
hour time limit, Rossie remarked 
"If Eugene McCarthy or Robert 
Kennedy were assasinated, we 
couldn't hold a demonstration 
of sympathy on a few hour's 
notice. We could not have held 
a demonstration of sympathy 
for Martin Luther King if this 
directive were in force." 
Student activists were equally 

sharp -in their reactions. Sherry, -Senator from Lyons, introduced 
a Senate bill reaffirming the right 
of anyone to demonstrate at 
any time if the demonstration is orderly and peaceful. In ad­dition, Sherry drafted a state­ment of principle "to protest the hypocrisy of the Adminis­tration." The statement, to be endorsed 'by the presidents of campus organizations, contends that Riehle's directive is too restrictive and was drawn up without students being consulted. 
The Sherry motion will be con­sidered at tonite's Senate meet­ing. 
Fr. Riehle's directive, pub­lished Mon., gives three regu­lations to be followed "in order to make student demonstrations meaningful and orderly." The first, besides that demonstrations be peaceful and not interfere with activities, classes, or traffic· forbids demonstrations in Uni­
versity buildil).gs or "specifically 
designated off-limited areas." The 
second regulation requires that 
demonstrations be registered with 
the Dean of Students 24 hours 
before they are held. The final 
rule is that only members of 
the University community may 
take part in demonstrations. 

Anti-ROTC Bill To Be Introduced To Senate 
Legislation sponsored by Off­Campus Senator Paul Higgins, former Student Body Vice-Pres­ident Tom McKenna, and Lyons Senator Jon Sherry calling for the disestablishment of ROTC programs from the University and for the prohibition of any 
secret research contracts and war research contracts being under­taken by the University will be introduced at tonight's Student Senate meeting. 
The anti-ROTC measure calls for the disestablishment fklr at three ROTC branches from the 
University and asks the Faculty Senate and the University Aca­demic Councils to consider sim­ilar proposals. 
Bill co-author and Action Stu­dent Party chairman Sherry said yesterday that his bill does not call for the prohibition of ROTC 
on campus, but instead seeks to "separate ROTC from the aca­demic curriculum of this Uni­
versity." 
Sherry said that the bill's four main points set forth de­tails for a "more appropriate relationship between ROTC and Notre Dame." 
The first of the measure's pro­visions is that no academic credit be given for any ROTC course. This provision also states that grades received in ROTC shall not be figured in the University 

grade point average and provides that no student shall be penalized by the University for overcutting any ROTC course. 
The second of the bill's point is that "the University shall not punish any student for infrac­tions of any rules in any ROTC program nor cause any punish­
ments for such infractions to be listed on the student's disciplinary record." 
The bill's third provision is that teachers of ROTC courses not be members of the Univers­ity's staff or faculty and that they not receive recompense from 
the University for any ROTC duties. 
The fourth point is that the University shall neither encourage nor discourage participation in any ROTC program. 

The Sherry-McKenna-Higgins bill on Military research con­tracts gives three reasons why the University should not con­tract for military or secret gov­ernment research. Sherry exp­lained the bill's purpose as that of "making us decide whether we're a university or a military research and development agen­cy." 
The first of the three under­lying principles included in the piece of Senate legislation is the contention that "the open nature of the university precludes se­
cret research with classified re­pons factory," is the bill's second and Christian" dimension, ques­sults." principle of rationale. tions of research on weapons of

Rossie: It's Our Student Center Now 
Student Body President Rich Rossie announced yesterday that the management of the LaFor­tune Student Center would be returned, after several years ab­sence, to a House Committee, which is comprised of students. Rossie obtained confirmation of 
the transferral of management from Vice President for Student Affairs Rev. Charles I. McCar­ragher' esc' and will make the official announcement at toni­ght's Senate meeting. 
The new policy is actually a reactivation of one passed by the Student Senate and approved by the Vice President several years ago. There will be several student managers of the center subject to the directives of the House Committee. The control of finances will also be returned to students. Rossie said the de­cision concerning who will actu­ally sign the checks pertaining to the Student Center will be left to the Student Senate. It is 
believed that the authorized signees will be Rossie of the chair­man of the committee. Rossie said that auditors would be called in every -four to six weeks to 
check the books. 
Current Student Center Man­ager, Brother Francis Gorch, esc, will assume a supervisory position. Rossie believes that this will place responsibility for "pa­trolling" the Student Center in the hands of the student mana­gers. Although the old Senate bill does not state that the stu­dent managers run the Student Center, Rossie believes the first order of the House Committee 
will be to empower the managers to regulate the Center. 
There will also be a change in the hours of the Center. The doors will be open until 12:30 on weeknights and until 2:00am on Fridays and Saturdays. 

Rossie asked Fr. McCarragher to make a decision on the pro­posal after the Student-Faculty­
Administration Committee on Student Life endorsed the reso­lution from the General Assem­bly on April 3. 
When he was contacted by the Observer, Bro. Gorch said he h?d not been informed of Fr. 
McCarragher's decision and hml no knowledge of the House Committee. Bro. Gorch said, "No committee is able to run the Student Center. A committee has no knowledge of what it takes to run it. The people that work here have to manage it." 
He also said, "I don't care what they do. I've done my duty. When I came here three years ago, the center was run down. The Social Commission isn't the only organization which has missing money. I have stud­ents working for me, and every year we have money missing." 
"All these students want is power. The students give every­thing to their buddies and if anything is left over for the clubs and other organizations, then they get it. Most students don't care about Rossie and the other students in power."

Humphrey, Men To Organize 

A committee has been formed on the Notre Dame campus in support of Vice-President Hu­bert Humphrey for the Demo­era tic Presidential Nom ina tion. Leaders of the movement, "No­tre Dame Students for Hum­phrey" have reacted to what the chairmen calls "a spontaneous plea that the Vice-President take up the fight for the nomination." 
"There has been a growing movement throughout the Uni­ted States to show the Vice­President that indeed he is the only possible candidate whom the Democratic National Conven­tion could naturally turn to, to continue in the fight for the progressive principles of both the Kennedy and Johnson Adminis­tration," said chairman of the group, Breen-Phillips Freshmen Richard Hunter. 
Commenting on the early lead built up by Senator Kennedy, a spokesmen said, "signs that the Kennedy bandwagon has failed to materialize are everywhere. Even delegates in his own state sense the Senator's lack ofquai{:

An unusual twist has two Bayonne, N.J., lads leading the Irish in pitching and hitting. 
Junior center fielder Bob Kocmalski was leading Irish regulars with a .485 average through the first five games. In 33 times at bat, he has 16 hits, nine RBI, two doubles and two home runs. 
Kocmalski, a Marist High product, lives on 22nd Street in Bayonne. Twelve streets away is the home of sophomore lefthander Mike Karkut, a Bayonne High grad. 
Karkut is showing the way with 2-0 hurling record. His first victory came against Cincinnati in the second game of an April 13 doubleheader. Karkut allowed only three hits, two of them infield safe­ties, in the 7-1 triumph. In his second out­ing, against Detroit Thursday, Karkut wnet 6 I/3 innings, then watched reliever Jim Phelps put away the last eight men in a row for a 4-1 victory. Mike's log shows 13 1/3 innings pitched, one earned run permitted, 17 strikeouts and a 0.68 ERA. 
Kocmalski is receiving support in the hitting department from second baseman Nick Scarpelli (.347, one homer, one 

Tennis Future Uncertain 
Whatever the outcome of the 1968 tennis season for the Irish netters may be, it should prove to be a surprise. Coach Tom Fallon says that, right now, this year's team is a big question mark. The performances of numerous sophomores sh­ould tell the story. 
Coach Fallon welcomes back 3 mono­gram winners from last year in Jasjit Singh, Carlos Carriedo, and Gerald Murphy. How­ever. Murphy has come up with an infec­tion on his hand, so he, like the season, will be questionable. Before the injury to Murphy, these men were planned to be used in the first, second and third posi­tions, respectively. Besides the possible loss of Murphy, the team has lost Dennis Nigro with an injured knee and Jim Barnett who has rl:opped out of school. Barnett was the ~·ourth man on the team last year. 

Sophomores will have to replace these vacancies. Some of the more promising yearlings are Jay Cusick, Bob Breerton, Bob O'Malley and Tim Whiting. Help may also come from Mike Petersmith. He was the eighth man on the '67 squad. 
The schedule for this season has chan­

ged very little since last year. ND will face, for the most part, Mid-American and Big Ten conference teams. 
In the past the tennis team has always come up with a very respectable squad. This has always been with the help of only one scholarship per year to aid the team. With a strong effort from Singh and Car­riedo (this year's captain) and a little bit of

triple), left fielder Frank Orga (.333,one homer, I 0 RBI) and right fielder Dick Lucke (.333, 9 RBI). Third baseman Bob 
Kuechenberg was a terror at Cincy with 
5-for-5 in the first game and six hits 
straight including his first trip in the 
nightcap. First baseman Dick Licini smash­
ed one of his two homers, a three-run job, 
in the opener against Purdue. 
Mound mainstays Nick Furlong and 
captain Tom Cuggino have found the go­
ing tough; both are 1-2. The other starter, 
Dave Celmer, is 1-1. 
Furlong has pitched well (2.57 ERA) 
but poor defense has hurt him. Yester­
day's game was typical. Michigan State 
took a 3-0 lead with a trio of unearned 
runs in the early innings. But Nick was 
knocked out by six Spartan runs in the 
fifth. Phelps finished up. 

Rugby 

At last report, the rugby team was 1-1 on its Ireland tour. The Irish blanked the Limerick Rovers 8-0 in the opener~ but bowed to University of Cork 23-8 in their second encounter. 
Tennis 
The NO tennis team is 3-6. The season opened last month with the Cherry Blossom Classic in Washington D.C.; the Irish won their opener, but dropped the

next two. After a two week layoff, they topped Ohio State and Wisconsin State by identical 5-4 scoresApril 13. 
But a four-match losing streak began 
shortly after Easter. The netters fell to 
Bradley 5-3, to Northwestern 7-2, to 
Northern Illinois 6-3 and to Indiana 
8-1. 
Ace Jasjit Singh missed the· early matches with a back injury and has re­turned to the courts lately at less than 
100%. 
Football 
Spring football practice took on a 
new look Monday after the coaching 
staff scrutinized films on pre-Easter prac­
tice. Freshman Pat Mudron, 6-0, 240 
pounds, displaced veteran Eric Norri at 
defensive tackle and reserve quarterback 
Coley O'Brien experimented in the de­
fensive backfield. 
The top defensive line now shows Mudron, Mike McCoy, Chick Lauck and Ed Vuillemin. The linebackers remained 
intact with Tony Capers, Bob Olson, John Lavin and Larry Schumacher. O'Ifrien 's appearance in the secondary scrambled it beyond recognition. 
The offensive line has Jim Seymour and Jim Winegardner at ends, George Kunz and Chuck Kennedy at tackles, Ed Tuck and Jim Reilly at guards and newcomer Chuck Holzapfel at center. Terry Hanratty, Bob Gladieux and Jeff Zimmerman are established in the back­field. Ed Ziegler, Frank Criniti, Jim Sheahan and Denny Allan are still batt­ling for the other hall'back slot. 

Track 
The Irish track team made a sweep of Buckeye state meets. Previous to a strong performance at the Ohio State Relays Saturday, ND dominated the Ohio State Relays, April 13. Bill Hurd won the I00 and 220, Ed Broderick took the high jump and the mile and two-mile relay teams were victorious. 
Hurd did the I00 in : 10.2 and the 220 in: 20.6 before teaming with Ole Skarstein, Bob Timm and Bob McCann for a 3:24.0 mile relay. Broderick's winning leap was 6-7 3/4. The two-mile quartet of Mark; Walsh, Kevin O'Brien, Chuch Venom 
and  Pete  Farrell  returned  a  7:36.8  
clocking.  
Athletic  director Edward  (Moos~..,  

Krause named an assistant hockey coach last week for the sport's first varsity season, 1968-69. Tim McNeill will serve under head tutor Charles (Lefty) Smith. Both men are graduates of St. Thomas College (Minn.).
