A naked man ran into St. Patrick's Cathedral on Wednesday night and attacked people with an iron prayer bookstand, killing one man and injuring a police officer before being shot to death by other officers, authorities said. The man entered the church about 8 p.m. carrying red carnations and walked to a front alter, where he removed the prayer bookstand and repeatedly struck an usher before attacking a woman praying in a pew, accor­ding to police and witnesses. The man was shot and killed by police after he attacked an officer trying to subdue him, said police spokesman Raymond O'Donnell. ­

Remembering Kelly: Kindergarten revisited 
Dear Kelly, 

I passed by our old school the other day. It 
was recess, and the playground was packed. 
The schoolyard teemed with 5-year-olds jump­
ing from the jungle gym and skipping through 
the hopscotch squares. 

It didn't seem that long ago that you and I 
were freckled faces in that crowd. 
You were my best friend back then. We 
shared everything from crayons to coat hooks. 
We placed our carpet squares side by side every 
nap time, and you always saved the green one 
just for me. ·~ 

We both agreed that "Tinkertoys" were a gift from the gods, and we spent every extra minute on the monkey bars at recess. We always sat together during milk and cookie break -you liked oatmeal 'n raisin, and I always picked chocolate chip. 
Remember when we pulled the chair out from under Tommy Ewald and had to spend recess in the coat room? Or how about the first time we walked home from school by ourselves? It seemed like 20 miles, even if it was only three blocks. And I'll never forget the day we begged my mom to take us to the school carnival and then cried when we were put on opposite teams at the tug of war. 
We stuck together, no matter what. You liked me even when I didn't color in between the lines and my "Garanimals" didn't match up. Even our imaginary friends were "best buddies." 
It was pretty traumatic when I transferred to the neighboring Catholic school in first grade. We cried for weeks, and I thought I'd never find another best friend. 
But I did. 

And pretty soon, those old kindergarten days were just memories, shoved to the back of my mind, somewhere in between my first valentine and my first bike. 
Once we'd left Mrs. Bray's morning kinder­garten, our paths didn't cross much. Mter a while, we were so caught up in swimming les­sons and spelling words and other "big kids" stuff, pink ribbons and popsicles just didn't seem that important anymore. 
Then, halfway through first grade, a group of men came to school during recess one day and constructed a fence between our two schools. I saw you even less after that. They built up lots of barriers when they erected that wall. 
We lost track of each other somewhere down the line. By the time I graduated from grade school, you were··just another face behind the fence. 
I don't know if you'd recognize me now, Kelly. A lot's happened since those pre-lunch box days. I've gone through braces and boyfriends and curfews and college. 
I don't worry about getting lost in the grocery store anymore, and I can read the Dr. Suess books all by myself now-even the big words. 

This week: Enjoy three nights of dancing­

Then on sunday it's: SPORTS SUNDAY 
presenting: _ The Notre Dame vs. Purdue game replayed for your enjoyment 
Don t forget to visit the HIDEAWAY-a Theodore's exclusive Drin~< special this week: FUZZY IRISHMEN 

And I'm no longer afraid of the dark .... well, not really. I'm still a Iitle scared of monsters under the bed, only we call them "cockroaches" now. 
I'm about two feet taller than when you knew me, and scraped elbows and loose teeth don't make me cry anymore. And I can drive and vote and even stay up past 9 o'clock. You'll never believe this, but I actually LIKE going to bed early now! . 
But ya know what, Kelly? Being big tsn't everything it's cracked up to be. I don't have much time for "The Electric Company" anymore. And -don't tell anybody -but I still get scared sometimes. But now I worry about different things -like chemistry tests and gov­ernment grades, instead of flashcards and thun­derstorms. And job security instead of security blankets. And SYRs and GREs insted of ABCs. 
My mind's cluttered with "big people" thoughts, like presidential elections and alcohol policies and Green House effects .... 
I remember when college seemed light years away. We never thought we'd get "that old." Gosh, now we're almost all grown up! Well.... not quite. 
Under all the big person pretense, I still love the monkey bars. And even though I cut off my pigtails long ago and my baby teeth are all 
gone,  I  still  pick  the  onions  out  of  my  
hamburgers,  and  green's  still  my  favorite  
color.  

I still think about you sometimes, Kelly. And if you were here, I know you'd be munching on an oatmeal cookie and saving the last green carpet just for me.

Sophomore, senior offices broken into over weekend 
By MIKE O'CONNELL 
News Staff 
The Senior Class Office, Sophomore Class Office and the Adworks Office in the LaFortune Student Center were broken into and robbed last weekend. 
Large amounts of cash were taken from the Senior and Sophomore Class Offices, while Adworks suffered a loss of only $75, according to Adworks Vice President Mickey Seymour. 
Senior Class President Tom Tisa and Sophomore Class President Rob Pasin refused to comment on the incident be­cause the investigation is still in progress. 
Notre Dame Security has been investigating the larceny since it was first discovered last Sunday. Lt. Bill Hedel of Notre Dame Security has been assigned to the case. 
"We're in the very early stages of the investigation right now," said Hedel. "At this time we are interviewing people who had access to the office, janitors, people with keys to the office --it's still too early to draw any conclusions." 
Security declined to release the exact amount of cash stolen from the offices or what the money was to be used for. 
"I came in on Sunday after­noon and saw the cas}) box which is usually kept in the Of­fice Manager's desk left open on top of one of the desks. Luck­ily we had just made a large deposit in the bank earlier that week," Seymour said. 
''The door to the office was not pried open, and whoever broke in just took the cash and left all of the checks behind," 
~-----~--· Adworks controller Max
Verkamp said. 
"Security did not dust for prints like they did for the Sophomore and Senior Class Offices, because of the number of people who handled the box after the theft," Verkamp said. 

"To my knowledge, nothing of this magnitude has hap­pened here before," said Ceil Paulsen, assistant director of Student Activities, who also su­pervises LaFortune.

House Speaker tells of CIA Nicaraguan action 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON-Congres­sional conservatives voiced outrage Wednesday over House Speaker· Jim Wright's disclosure of a purported U.S. covert operation in Nicaragua. 
President Reagan referred to Wright's comments as a "violation" and said the speaker had been indiscreet in telling reporters Tuesday that the CIA hired operatives inside Nicaragua to stir up demonstrations against the leftist government and damage peace efforts. 
The administration stead­fastly refused to either confirm or deny Wright's report.

member of the House Intelli­gence Committee, called Wright's assertions "San­dinista propaganda." 
"It's appalling," Hyde said of Wright's disclosure, which the speaker said was based on CIA testimony. "It's a no-win situation for America. God help Americans down there (in Nicaragua), that's all I can say." 
Hyde said he could neither confirm nor deny the dis­closure, but added: "What he said is news to me, and I serve on the Intelligence Committee . .. I sure as hell want to know who that testimony is from and under what circumstances he got it." 
Hyde said GOP house leaders would meet Thursday with the Wright matter "high on the agenda." Asked whether there would be a call for an ethics probe, he said: "I think there will be." 
House Republican leaders late Wednesday formally asked the House ethics com­mittee and the Intelligence Committee to investigate Wright's conduct and recom­mend "appropriate action." 
Wright already is being in­vestigated by the committee on unrelated allegations. Sanc­tions for unauthorized dis­closure of classified informa­tion can include removal from committee membership, cen­sure, or expulsion from the House. 
Aspokesman for Wright, Wil­son Morris, said the matter had been blown out of proportion and that Wright had violated no rules in talking about the CIA activity. 
"CIA involvement in Nicaragua has been admitted by the CIA and the White House," Morris said. "It's been repeatedly documented. It's all in the public domain."

Candidates prime for coming debate 
Associated Press 

Presidential rivals George Bush and Michael Dukakis plunged into preparations Wed­nesday for their first debate, poring over fat briefing books and getting tips from media and political advisers. Dukakis took out time to propose a "Healthy Start" program guaranteeing basic medical care for poor women and children. 
"When children and their families have needed a helping hand, Mr. Bush's administra­tion has given them a cold shoulder,'' Dukakis said during a visit to Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, where he met with two new mothers and their babies. 
"When the time came to stand up for our children's health care needs, George Bush was nowhere to be found," the Democratic nominee said. 
Bush also was the target of criticism from an unexpected

Outbreak of riots follows shooting 
Associated Press 
SHREVEPORT, La.­Hundreds of angry blacks burned stores and rioted in the streets after a white woman fa­tally shot a black man, and black leaders warned Wednes­day against a recurrence of vio­lence. 
"We're sitting on a powder keg," said state Rep. Alphonse Jackson, who called for a bira­cial anti-crime committee. 
"People want protection," said Jackson, who is black. "I call on citizens to restore law and order." 
His plea followed a meeting of city officials and macK leaders to discuss the rioting that persisted nearly five hours, unti13 a.m. Wednesday, and which officials said was related both to drugs and racial problems. 
Stores were looted and burned, and rioters threw rocks and bottles at whites. There were reports of racial slurs and chants of "Hot Bis­cuit," the restaurant where a white teen-ager killed a black teen-ager on Aug. 4, an incident that set off racial tension in this northwestern Louisiana city of 250,000, the state's second larg­est after New Orleans.

Man registers .5 blood alcohol 
Associated Press 
PERU, Ind.-A man who registered a .50 percent blood alcohol level regained con­sciousness Wednesday and was in stable condition at Dukes Memorial Hospital's intensive care unit, police said. 
Ivan Archuleta, 35, of Peru was found unconscious on the seat of his father's pickup Tues­day night and taken to the hospital when he could not be awakened. A blood test was or­dered. 
A blood alcohol content of .10 
is legally drunk in Indiana. First Sgt. John Forbes of the state police said death can oc­cur in the blood alcohol content range between .40 and .50. 
Charts measuring how many drinks it takes in a time period for a person to achieve blood alcohol levels don't read higher than .40. 
Miami Circuit Judge Bruce Embry estimated a person weighing 180 pounds would have to drink about 28 shots of whiskey or about 28 12-ounce cans of beer in two hours to at­tain a .50 content.

Archuleta was found in a pickup belonging to Fructuoso Archuleta, who was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and public in­toxication. 
Ivan Archuleta was charged with public intoxication. He currently is on probation on a previous public intoxication charge after pleading guilty in circuit court on Aug. 11.

Motor, fired Aug.18)," said Ed Snow, a Morton Thiokol spokes­man at Ogden, reading a prepared company statement. 
"The forward nose ring per­formed satisfactorily. The er­ror was discovered during reg­ular post-test examination and analysis of the part. NASA and Morton Thiokol are working to discover how the error was made and how it can be prevented in the future," the statement said. 
Medal said he believed the mistake was discovered within the last day or two. 
"We fully believe the correct parts are in the flight set," company spokesman Rocky 

Raab  told  the  Associated  
Press.  "We  and  NASA  are  
researching  the  record,  the  

documents, to make sure they are the correct parts. Even if they were not, they would not affect the safety of the flight." 

Raab said the discovery was made during X-ray analysis of the part after the test firing. "There is no visible difference between the two parts," he said. 
The Aug. 18 test, the fifth full­scale static firing of the redesigned booster, was con­ducted at Thiokol's Wasatch Operations plant 25 miles west of Brigham City under NASA and Thiokol supervision. 
Mter the test, engineers dis­assembled the rocket and began a lengthy process of ex­amining it. NASA later pronounced the test a success and certified Discovery for launch. 
Most of the booster redesign was aimed at making the rocket safer. A faulty 0-ring seal on one of the booster seg­ments was blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.

Invitation of Stevens degrades University 
Supreme Court ;Justice John Paul Stevens will be the featured speaker at the dedication, on Friday, Sept. 23, of the Courtroom at the Notre Dame Law School. The choice of Justice Stevens for this honor is inappropriate. 
Charles E. Rice 
guest coLumn 

Although he was not a member of the Supreme Court in 1973 when it decided, in Roe vs. Wade, that state prohibitions of abortions were unconstitutional, Jus­tice Stevens is one of the four Justices now on the Court who uphold Roe and apply it rigorously against attempts by the states to regulate abortion. In the 1986 Thornburn case, the Court held un­constitutional Pennsylvania statutes restricting abortion, including one re­
r quirement that, in post-viability 
r"' abortions, the physician must use the care and techniques that would "provide the best opportunity for the unborn child to be aborted alive" unless that technique "would present a signif­icantly greater medical risk to the life or health of the pregnant woman." Chief Justice Warren Burger, who had voted with the majority Roe vs. Wade, dissented in Thornburgh. As a result, the Thornburgh case was decided by one vote. Justice Stevens, however, voted with the majority and wrote an opinion enphasizing the non­personhood of the unborn child. Justice Powell, who voted with that majority, has since been replaced with Justice Kennedy. Justice Stevens, it is true, has voted and argued at times against the Court majority and in favor of state requirements that parents give their consent or at least be notified before a dependent minor obtains an abortion, as in Danforth in 1976 and Matheson in 1981. Nevertheless, he is generally an indispensable member of the four-
Justice Stevens, how­
ever, voted with the

unborn child. 
Justice bloc which has continued the rigid application of Roe, as seen in the Thornburgh case. 
We may assume that Justice Stevens is "personally opposed" to abortion. And undoubtedly his motivations are noble. However, the inappropriateness of this invitation arises from the transcendent importance of Roe vs. Wade. In that case and its companion case of Doe vs. Bolton, the Supreme Court ruled that the unborn child is not a person at any time before birth, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment which protects the rights of a "person" to life and to the equal protection of the laws. The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment did not spe­cifically consider the status of the un­born child, but they clearly intended that all human beings would be per~ sons. This was a reaction to the Dred Scott case in 1857, in which the Supreme Court held that freed slaves were not citizens and said that slaves were prop­erty rather than persons. 
In Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court said that it would not decide whether the unborn child is a human being. In­stead, the Court held that he is not a "person" and therefore his right to life is not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The mother's privacy right to have an abortion (a right which the Court discovered in its own rulings since 1965) prevails over the non-right of the non-person in her wgmb. The Court went on to spell out, in effect, a license for elective abortion at every stage of pregnancy until birth. 
In Roe vs. Wade, the Court held that whether or not the unborn child is a human being, his is not a person. The decision is thus the same in effect as a frank ruling that an acknowledged human being is a non-person and has no rights. It is a resurrection of the spirit of the Dred Scott case. And it is precisely the principle that underlay the Nazi extermination of the Jews, that an innocent human being can be declared to be a non-person and sub­jected to death at the discretion of others. 
Of course, if the unborn child can be treated as a non-person so as to be killed at the discretion of others, so can his elder, retarded brother or his grand­mother. I(a human being can be sub­jected -to death at the discretion of others, he is to that extent a non-person. The ethic of depersonalization is reflected in the now prevailing rule that permits withholding of food and water, with the intent to cause death, from retarded infants and incompetent adult patients including some who are con­scious and not terminally ill. We tend to call this compassion. A more realis­tic view would call it murder. But the institutionalization of murder is not surprising in a society which accpets legalized abortion. For the irreducible reality is that every abortion, at whatever stage of pregnancy, causes the death of an innocent human being. 
We have no right to judge the internal culpability, or lack of it, of anyone in­volved in abortion. But, in the objective moral sense though not in the technical legal sense, every abortion, as the deliberate killing of an innocent human being, is a murder. Leo Alexander, M.D., who wrote the seminal analysis with respect to the American situation, "It is much like Germany in the '20s and '30s--the barriers against killing are being removed." (see Joseph R. Stanton, M.D., The New Unter­menschen, Human Life Review, Fall, 1985, 77, 82) 
In this context the invitation to Justice 
Stevens by this Catholic law school is 
inappropriate. I am sure that the invi­
tation was not intended as an affirma­
tion by Notre Dame that his view on 
legalized abortion is correct. However, 
by this invitation we tell our students that abortion is merely one consititu­tional issue among others and that it really does not make all that much dif­ferenct whether a lawyer or judge sup­ports the depersonalization of innocent human beings. We imply that the im­portant thing is to be a "competent" lawyer; yet it hardly vouches for one's professional competence if he is unable to see the centrality of this issue as of Dred Scott. We encourage our students to show "compassion" to the poor and

helpless. Yet the poorest and most help­less victim of all is the child who is murdered in the womb; society's an­swer to the difficult pregnancy should be, not to kill the baby, but to help the mother and the child, before and after the birth, as long and as fully as nec­essary. We encourage our students to serve the cause of "peace"; we would do well to remind them, as Mother Theresa has often said, that "The greatest destroyer of peace in the world is abortion." And we encourage our stu­dents to work to build a just moral or­der. We might remind them of what Pope John Paul II said at the Capitol Mall in Washington in 1979: "If a per­son's right to life is violated at the mo­ment in which he is first conceived in his mother's womb, an indirect blow is struck also at the whole of the moral order, which serves to ensure the in­violable goods of man. Among these goods, life occupies the first place." 
The invitation to Justice Stevens, I am certain, was well intentioned. But surely there were other suitable per­sons who could have been honorea with this invitation wother than a Supreme Court Justice whose one vote has kept the regime of legalized abortion intact. The invitation disserves our students and degrades the University.

P.O. Box Q 
Pro-lifers guilty of hypocrisy 
bear Editor: 

In the four years that I have been at Notre Dame, the moral righteousness of those opposing abortion has never failed to amaze me. Recently we have seen articles by them alongside others praising the role of the military or ROTC. I have often wondered what the crossover is between these two groups, 
i.e. how many of those who support the military are also anti-abortionists? I am sure the figure would be of interest to many. How many anti-abortionists do you think would protest if an army general were to give a talk at Notre Dame instead of an executive from a pharmaceutical company. 
Why have the anti-abortionists cho­sen to focus on this particular aspect of "violence to humanity" when there are many more instances of violence in the world around us? There is no ambiguity when a poor peasant is killed in Central America, very often by U.S.­made guns or bombs. This is a loss of real human lives, not a group of cells that is often not even visible. There is no ambiguity when 35,000 die of starva­tion every day (compared to 30,000 aborted fetuses, as another letter in The Observer informs us). These are real flesh and blood people with fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers who weep for them even if the anti­abortionists do not. Or the hundreds dead in Africa or the Middle East due to political violence. Ask yourself how many are being killed and do you really care? It is hypocritical for the anti­abortionists to portray themselves as defenders of human life when all they really are are religious fundamen­talists, unable to look beyond their dog­matism. Some can even bomb clinics while claiming to be pro-life. 
We were given a quick course on pros­taglandins by Mr. Rothfus in his Sept. 12 column although he forgot to mention that birth control is not their only use. Prostaglandins belong to a large family of compounds that are produced in many tissues and apparently have a va­riety of functions in the body. Even the prostaglandins he mentions have clini­cal uses in the management of miscar­riage and in the induction of labor at term. He also forgot to mention (again?!) that while Upjohn did develop these products, they no longer conduct research on the reproductive functions of prostaglandins, focusing instead on the treatment of ulcers and cardiovascular diseases. 
Mr. Rothfus even quotes feminists in the column, when they have been con­sistently pro-cboice. He would also have us believe that he is concerned about third world countries! Depo­provera, the drug mentioned, is the least of their problems. In any case these countries have often been used as testing grounds for new products by western pharmaceutical companies, this did not start with the use of Depo­provera. Or were the anti-abortionists aware of that?

'Prosperous' era ignores harsh facts 
Some supporters of George Bush claim to talk economic facts in defense of the economic record of the ReagawBush administration. We agree that it is essential to look at the eco­nomic facts of the last eight years; the trouble is that Reaga!YBush defenders tend to forget some facts. 
Kathryn English Kimberly Lane 
guest column 

Are you better off now than you were eight years ago? The answer might be yes if the only people questioned were in the top five percent of this country's wage earners. It is certainly true that this small minority has enjoyed sub­stantial financial growth. However, ac­cording to a recent report published by the Economic Policy Institute, the fact is that the workers in the bottom 60 percent are actually worse off than they were eight years ago. It reports that since the ReagawBush Administration took office "more than 3 million workers moved down the ladder from jobs with mid-level earnings to jobs with low-level earnings." The rich got richer while the poor got poorer. Real hourly wages for males (as adjusted for inflation) actually dropped seven percent during the Reagan Administra­tion. Would these people say that they are better off today than they were eight years ago? Doubtful. 
ReagawBush defenders quote the statistic that "3 million people less are now living below the poverty level than in 1982." However, they fail to acknowl­edge the fact that from 1979-1986 the number of full-time year-round workers who earn less than the poverty level actually increased by more than 600,000. In fact, according to Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, "poverty levels are far higher than the (1978) 11.4 percent figure and 8 million more Americans. are poor today." Another fact: More than one seventh of our country's pop­ulation was living below the poverty level last year. 
Some also applaud the ReagawBush Administration for creating "18 million jobs," over half of which they describe as "good jobs" that earn over $20,000 a year. Yet the fact is that this same administration cut spending on educa­tion and training, making these "good jobs" inaccessible to the majority of the now unemployed. These jobs may be good news to a Notre Dame student, but the average American is not able to attend a prestigious university or indeed, receive any post-high school training at all. These $20,000 job oppor­tunities are simply not a reality for them. Related to this, another fact of interest is that the average number of business failures each year of the ReagawBush Administration was ap­proximately double the previous high and nearly triple the post-war average, as cited in an economic report by the Budget Committee. 
Some accuse Governor Dukakis of using "smoke and mirrors" to create the illusion of a balanced budget. What are the facts of the ReagawBush budget? Reagan was elected on a prom­ise to: one, balance the national budget; two, reduce taxes; and three, increase military spending. "Smoke and mirrors?" Did it work? No. He reduced the tax burden of the best-off. He spent more on the military. He did more to worsen the deficit tha·n any president in history. His tax cut was never intended to help balance the budget. David Stockman openly stated, when it was all over, that the "tax less-

spend more" plan was intended to create a deficit so bad that Congress would be forced to cut spending on so­cial programs. Congratulations David; your plan worked brilliantly. The tax cut has not been vindicated. The recent so-called economic boom has been financed by an irresponsible federal spending spree paid for with borrowed money. What is truly outrageous is that Reagan and Bush, who borrowed it, are not going to have to pay it back. Who will? We will. The percentage of the budget going to pay interest on the def-

icit was roughly doubled under Reagan and Bush. We are going to pay higher taxes for the rest of our lives because of Reagan and Bush's "voodoo econom­ics." 
The evidence continues. The Reaga!YBush administration doubled the merchandise trade deficit during its first term, averaging $64.9 billion a

year. The figure during the second term is even more appalling as it skyrock­eted to $151.1 billion. In 1985, for the first time in history, this country be­came a debtor nation in total balance of payments. As quoted from AFL-CIO News, this debt has risen past the $400 billion mark this past year. The ReagawBush administration did raise taxes. Of course, these tax increases (things like reducing or eliminating deductions for medical expenses and casualty losses) hurt the middle class more than the wealthy. It is true that, as a group, the elderly are better off than ever before. Why? Because the Democrats made it politically impossible for Reagan and Bush to tamper with cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security benefits. The only reason the deficit is not even worse is that Democrats in Congress prevented Reagan and Bush from reducmg taxes of the wealthy even more than it did and from spending even more than it did on the military. 

Facts are stubborn things. The bot­
, tom line fact is that the ReagawBush economic policies justify retiring both of them in November. We cannot afford four more years of Bush's "voodoo eco­nomics."

London trip opens new dimensions 
As I write, I am overlooking bustling Piccadilly Circus, the heart of London's theatre district. Similar to New York's theatre area, Piccadilly radiates with bright neon signs, majestic theatres and hordes of excited people. Yet Pic­cadilly, and this city as a whole, exudes an elegance and civilty of which New York can only dream. 
Michael Schadek

From the moment I set foot in Lon­don, it was obvious that I was to expe­rience a brand new lifestyle. From the bright red double-decker buses to the old-fashioned black cabs, city transpor­tation is but one small facet of the vast differences I have encountered here. Although I have been on the London Program for scarcely more than a few weeks, adjusting to the changes has been easy, and more importantly, fun. No longer do I become angry about the fact that I have not figured out the cur­rency, and no longer do I concern myself with the fact that cars and buses are heading directly toward me from the right rather than the left. I have also accepted the fact that London's fast food restaurants charge 5 pence (almost a dime) for ketchup. I have resolved myself to accept all tlie differ­ences and "live, learn and love Lon­don." I'm beginning to sound more and more like a tourist representative, I fear, but love London is precisely what I do. 
Within the short time I have been here I have gazed at Big Ben and Par­liament at night from a boat cruise on the Thames. Although our disc jockey knew we were Americans and thus felt compelled to play five Michael Jackson songs in a row, the cruise was a fan­tastic opportunity to see the city at night. We have also experienced the legendary London theatre by way of three plays, and some students han already made use of their plastic at Harrod's. 

The next three and a half months are certain to be an educational period un­like any I have ever experienced. I have already been challenged in some of my most fundamental beliefs. For in­stance, last Sunday an Iranian gentleman tried for 45 minutes to con­vince me that the United States is the greatest terrorist organization in the world which savagely destroys inno­cent Iranian citizens aboard commer­cial .airliners. This man was a fixture of Speakers Corner in Hyde Park where every Sunday any individual can speak about anything they wish while the huge crowd heckles and jeers. It is all very interesting, very hip and very Lon­donesque. 
I never realized education--real education--could be so exciting, but the London Program is proving the fact. Living and studying in London provides a broad new dimension of the world, and that must be good. So, while I miss the campus and beautiful South Bend, I'll stay in London a while longer. Be­sides, Big Ben keeps much better time than the Sacred Heart clock.

Air Force's 'Tops in Blue' returns to NO 

DAVID DESALLE accent writer 

S 
ynthesizing art, music, special effects, and choreography is the prime characteristic of an award winning Broadway show. It is also the key to the perfor­mances of "Tops in Blue," the U.S. Air Force's top en­tertainment touring group. 
This troupe of specially talented military personnel will be giving a free ninety­minute performance at 8 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 22, at the Stepan Center. Last year, the performers rocked the Joyce ACC before a crowd of over 5,000 students. According to Nick Rossi, the Cultural Arts Commissioner for the Student Union Board, a comparable audience is expected for this year's performance of "The Magic of Imagination" which will combine comedy, dan­cing, singing, and the modern sound of the Heavy Blue Ex­press, the group's guitalikeyboard based musi­cal accompaniment. 
The show tells the story of Kay, a lonely young girl who lives on Swing Street and joins a group of neighborhood kids in search of adventure. They are drawn to "The Magic of Imagination," the town's toy shop where they enjoy mischievous childish fun. That is, until Old Man Irwin surpises the group, causing it to scatter with Kay left behind. Irwin recognizes that Kay needs a friend and helps her to use her imagina­tion. She learns she has the ability to face life with both realistic goals and her own dreams in mind. 
The cast of "Tops in Blue" is selected from over 250 tal­ent contest finalists who are chosen from thousands of par­ticipants in the annual Air Force worldwide talent con­test. These finalists are sub­ject to more than a week of interviews, intense competi­tion, and auditions. The "Tops in Blue" candidates then have a month of rehear­sals at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. Eighteen-hour

theme and content of the 
show and after that grueling 
month, the cast is ready to 
begin its worldwide tour. 
Since !953, "Tops in Blue" has provided professional en­tertainment to both Air Force personnel and members of the civilian community. Leonarda J. Sarinas, a ''Tops in Blue" vocalist, said that the biggest reward is the op­portunity to be part of some­thing that does so much for so many people. The group has appeared on television on numerous occasions, notably during the 1950's on the Ed Sullivan Show, and in 1985 when a 52-member cast and 1,000 volunteers performed in the half-time show of Super Bowl XIX. In 1987, it helped to coordinate production for the "Bob Hope Birthday Spe­cial." 
"Tops in Blue" usually ap­pears at Air Force bases, but according to Captain T. DuPre, assistant professor of aerospace studies, "They look for unique opportunities to perform. Originally Colonel year that "Tops in Blue" has Dave Woods, come to South Bend. professor of aerospace studies DuPre said, "Anybody will , invited 'Tops in Blue' to per­be generally surprised by the form here through his friend, show.

RICHARD THORNBURGH accent writer 

"The Rime of the Ancient Roadtripper" It is an ancient Roadtripper Who corners me at the bar With long gray beard and glittering eye He has journeyed from afar. 
The Lansing crowd is merry As the Irish await the game. The domers file into Dooley's To cheer the Irish fame. 
He tells me of his pilgrimage: And I cannot choose but hear; And thus spoke on that ancient man, The bright-eyed Roadtripper. 
"Two weeks ago we left South Bend With a six-pack for the road, Legs soon cram·ped, an empty tank, Unsure of where to go. 
Michigan State was somewhere north, At least that was our belief; The cold ones went down quickly But bean fields gave relief. 
Three days thus we journeyed Not knowing where we went; 'Is this Lansing?' I asked a man: 'No sir, this is Flint.'

Through the cornfields our car did fly Until it sputtered to a stop: The gaskets blown, transmission stripped, The radiator shot. 
Our trusty craft we left behind And journeyed forth on foot; Our legs grew weary, our sight grew dim As miles behind we put. 
Then lo, a sight of wonder 
Amazed our tired eyes: From beneath those noble corn stalks John Cougar did arise. 
'Howdy, folks. Lookin for State? It's just around the bend.' Then the prophetic saint of farmers Vanished in the wind. 
This eerie sight inspired us all To set forth once again. We finally arrived in Lansing Seeking pubs and an Irish win." 
Thus spoke the ancient Roadtripper, Haggered from his plight. I ordered another and pondered his tale As he danced away the night. 
'Tis a strange tale, to be sure, One I never sought, For I have nev.er heard one speak in rhyme, But the habit is rubbing off.

-Growing up in a well-structured family seems to be taken for granted by most of us. Yet. physical and mental abuse is an everyday thing for the children I encountered at a school we visited. 
-A simple comment about the type of food at the dining hall would never enter your mind if this were the only meal you and your family would have today." 
From Shane O'F/aherty, The Ohsener, 1/88 

Early this year 288 students took part in the Urban Plunge--a 48-hour immersion into the kind of life most Notre Dame and St. Mary's students have never seen. This year's Plunge will occur sometime during the week of January 6-13. Its purpose: 
-To experience injustice, apathy and poverty; -To increase awareness of people who are working to improve these situations; and -To witness and reflect on ways to address Gospel concerns regarding the oppressed.

Associated Press 
OAKLAND -Dennis Eck­ersley recorded the 61st save of the season Wednesday for the Oakland bullpen, establish­ing a major league record, as the Athletics beat the Min­nesoti Twins, 6-3. 
The old record of 60 saves in a season was held by the Cin­cinnati Reds, who reached that total in 1970 and 1972. 
Bob Welch, 16-8, allowed five hits and he retired 13 consecu­tive batters after giving up a run in the third inning. He left in the eighth after a leadoff single by John Moses. 
Eckersley got the last three outs for his 43rd save. 
The A's, who have clinched the American League West, moved 43 games over .500, with a 98-55 record, for the first time in Oakland history. 
The A's were down 2-0 at one point but scored three runs in the third and three in the fifth off Bert Blyleven, 10-16. 
Ron Hassey broke a 2-2 tie with an RBI single in the third, and Tony Phillips had a two­run triple in the fifth.

Ojeda cuts finger, is lost fo-r season 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -New York Mets left-bander Bob Ojeda un­derwent successful surgery Wednesday after he nearly severed the upper one-third portion of his left index finger with an electric hedge clipper in a gardening accident at his Long Island home. 
The Mets said Ojeda under­went five hours of microsur­gery at Roosevelt Hospital. The surgery was performed by Dr. James Parkes and Dr. Richard Eaton. 
Eaton said the tip of the finger was reattached includ­ing damaged arteries, tendons and nerves. 
Parkes said that the acci­dent, which occurred at 11: 15 a.m., nearly severed the finger at the joint.

CHURCH, STATE and FREEMASONRY IN AMERICA

Behind The Lodge Door lifts the veil on the subterranean war waged against Church and State by the Masonic Fraternity for over 200 years -even in­fluencing U.S. Supreme Court decisions.

"Microsurgery in the hand is very effective," Parkes said. "The nerve is back, the artery is back and the finger is stabilized." 
Parkes said the clippers slipped and Ojeda could not control them. 
Parkes said it would take fuur to six months for Ojeda to recover. 
"It is a blow," Mets general manager Frank Cashen said. "We planned to use him in one playoff game and a World Se­ries game if we got there."

Men's tennis team hopes to gain respect at Navy tourney 
By BOB MITCHELL Sports Writer 
The climb to the top of the collegiate tennis world is a long and difficult ascent, yet Irish head coach Bob Bayliss believes that the best place to start is against top teams. This weekend, the Notre Dame men's tennis team will receive a crash course in nationally ranked talent at the Navy Na­tional All-Conference Tourna­ment in Annapolis, Md. 
"There are nationally ranked teams in Annapolis and this will give us a chance to play some top competition," said Bayliss. 
Top competition is just what Notre Dame will get when they set foot on the courts of the Naval Academy. Also converg­ing on this site will be Kansas, Arkansas, West Virginia and Texas A&M. All of these schools are ranked in the Top 25 in the country with the nazorbacks possessing the highest ranking at 10. Round­ing out the tournament combatants are the host team, Navy, Illinois, and the Deacons of Wake Forest. 
The tournament will be con­ducted as an individual compe­tition, grouping all the number one seeds toghether and put­ting them against one another. This grouping will be done from the number one seed to the number eight seed. The doubles competition will be conducted in the same manner. 

Bayliss, who coached Navy from 1969-1984, is convinced that this tournament is a step in the right direction for the men's program. 
"This tournament will show that we can play at this level and will make Notre Dame more attractive to recruits," said Bayliss. 
However, looking at the pres­ent situation, Bayliss thinks that this trip will help develop the team on an individual basis as well as a whole. 
"Personally, I hope everyone plays as well as they can," said Bayliss. 
On the team, Bayliss com­
mented that "it always benefits 
your team when you test your 
metal against the top teams." 
As a result of the influx of 
new talent, the men's team has 
undergone some reshuffling of 
the lineup. As of the present, 
Dave DiLucia, a freshman 
from Norristown, Pa., holds 
the number one position as a 
result of being the victor in a 
challenge match against Brian 
Kalbas. Kalbas, a senior and 
the number one player last 
year, assumed the number two 
spot. 

-DiLucia recently played doubles at the United States Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows, New York. 
His experience in national com­petition is sure to aid the Irish bid for national recognition. He and Kalbas should duel throughout the season for the top spot. 
Walter Dolhare, a junior transfer from Austin Peay, grabbed the third seed. Dol­hare is suffering from a sprained ankle and will not be 100 percent, but will play. Junior Mike Wallace, the second seed last year, holds the fourth seed. Sophomore Ryan Wenger, the third seed last year, plays in the fifth spot. Dave Reiter, Paul"Odland, and Mike Brown earned the sixth, seventh and eighth seeds, respectively. 

Irish offense features new faces in new places 
Almost overshadowed in the second-half success of the running game last Saturday against Michigan State was the presence of some new faces both on the line and in the backfield. 
Sophomore Tim Ryan, who had been the second­string center, started ahead of Winston Sandri at guard. In the backfield, following the first-series injuries to fullbacks Braxston Banks and Anthony Johnson, second-team tailback Tony Brooks gained 66 yards on 11 carries after replacing the tandem. 
With Banks out four to six weeks and Johnson doubtful for Satutday's game at home against Purdue, Brooks is listed to start at fullback. Ryan also is expected to continue his new guard assign­ment in a starting role. 
"Tim Ryan was moved to offensive guard last Monday (before the Michigan State game)," said Head Coach Lou Holtz. "We did not expect him to start in all honesty... we planned on playing him part of the time. He played well for his opening start." 
Offensive guard is Ryan's third position since ar­riving at Notre Dame last season. The sophomore from Kansas City, Mo., saw limited action at inside linebacker last season, then was listed as a center during the spring and fall practices. 
Senior Ted FitzGerald switched sides from de­fensive line to offensive line, where he was expected to replace Ryan as sophomore Mike Heldt's back-up center. But FitzGerald suffered a knee injury during Tuesday's practice, which leaves freshman Gene McGuire of Panama City, Fla., as the second­team center for the time being. 

"Gene is adjusting and learning constantly," said offensive line coach Tony Yelovich. "It's unique for 
Steve Megargee 
Football Notebook 
a freshman to have the opportunity as quickly as he has, but he keeps improving. Every day he gets better." 
Brooks figures to see double-duty in the backfield, keeping his old job as second-team tailback behind senior Mark Green while also starting as fullback. Brooks did play fullback in last year's Michigan State game following injuries to the regulars. 
"He's learning a new position in a week, and remembering his old one," said running backs co­ach Jim Stron . "He's learnin two game plans, from the tailback spot and the fullback spot. We don't like to do it, but Tony has good football aware­ness. "We've really zeroed him in on fullback this week. We're trying to get him as many reps there as possible. The execution and assignments are to­tally different (at tailback and fullback)," contin­ued Strong. "Johnson and Brooks have taken about 1,000 snaps on each particular play since I've been here, so they can be polished in that situation. We're trying to knock the rust off a guy and polish off the rough edges." 
Brooks also is still suffering from a partially frac­tured foot, which has the Tulsa, Okla., resident wearing an orthopedic shoe. 
"We had his foot X-rayed, and there was no change on it," said Holtz in his Tuesday press con­ference. "I would like to think he'd be able to go the rest of the year that way. To have played on astroturf (at Michigan State) and have practiced without having it digress, we're encouraged, though something could happen on any play." 
Sophomore Ryan Mihalko and freshman Rodney Culver also figure to see action in the backfield. Mihalko, also a javelin thrower on the Irish track team, moved to fullback in the fall after working 
on the defense in the spring.
