In anit-American protests 

Mob storm.s etnbassy 
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) .. Some 2,000 Libyans chanting support for Iran stormed and ransacked the U.S. Embassy here yesterday in the lrotest of a wave of angry anti-American protests 
in the Moslem world, U.S. officials reported. 
None of the embassy staff was injured, but the Libyan government accused the· Americans of having seriously injured several of the attackers by firing military-type "toxic gasses" at them. 
Libya's official JANA news agency said this "confirmed that the embassy's employees are military personnel." It did not say whether this meant the government planned to take any action against the Americans, who had to scurry for safety through a back door and went to their homes after the attack. 
State Department officials in Washington said an automatic tear-gas security system had activated when the embassy was stormed. 
The JANA report said the protesters set fire to an American flag and effigies of President Carter and the deposed Shah of Iran. U.S. officials reported serious fire damage on the first f1.1or of the four-story building. 
An embassy source said the consular section was badly damaged and there also was damage on the second floor of the building. theC arter administration immediately filed the "strongest possible'' protest with the government of Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy over the attack and implied that it believed the Khadafy regime supported the attack.

UN Security Council prepares for second debate 
UNITED NATIONS (AP)-Security Council members held private consultations yesterday evening to prepare for a second round of public debate on the U.S.-Iraman crisis. The debate in the 15-member council was expected to resume at about 7:30p.m. U.S. Ambassador Donald F. McHenry said during a television interview earlier yesterday he expected "the council will act (on a resolution) ... sometime tomorrow or the n("xt day. In Tehran Forei~n Ministry spokesman said Iran would be sending a Jow-rankmg admimstrative officer to til~ United Nations, but he would not be an envoy empowered to undertake diplomatic discussions. 
Hostage begs release ofshah on smuggled tape 
LOS ANGELES (AP)-A tape recording by one of the Americans held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran calls for the United States to surrender the deposed shah oflran so the hostages can be freed. Tfie seven-minute tape of the voice of Jerry Plotkin, from the Los Angeles suburb of Sherman Oaks, was obtained last week by Los Angeles radio station KNCP newsman Alex Paen in Tehran from students holding the embassy. "In the name of God return the shah and free the hostages," Plotkin said in a steady voice. "Let the world know no tyrant or dictatc.Jr can ever find safe harbor in the U.S." 
Officials link bu~ldings to sickness in Carmel 
CARMEL, Ind. (AP)-The mysterious illness that has troubled the faculty at Orchard Park Elementary School may be part of a nationwide surge in sickness related to new buildings, health officials say. "We've had so many of them lately that we could make 'buildings' a full-tjme job," says Dr. Philip R. Taylor, a physician assigned to cover New York state for the National Center for Disease Control. "They all seem ro deal with the air," he said. Orchard Park Faculty reported more than half their numbers were stricken with an unknown illness this year. The symptoms included eye irritation, headaches, nausea, dizziness and fatigue. "As we start to build buildings tighter to conserve energy, we can expect more of this," he said, citing a case on New York's Lon~ Island of an "air-starved building," where improved vemtlation had to be added. 
Native Americans to receive millions in grants 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The U.S. Office of Education announced yesterday 170 grants totaling $24.3 million to improve education for Indian children and adults. Nearly $4.4 million went to tribes and Indian-controlled school boards operating 28 schools in a dozen states. Some $14 million was awarded to tribes and other Indian organizations for teacher training, curriculum development, preschool programs and similar projects. Adult education programs for lndtans received $5.9 million. All the funds were granted under the Indian Education Act. Earlier this year, the government awarded $47 million to local school districts based on the number of Indian children they enroll.

Iranians cast votes; favor newconstitution 
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -Iranians began voting yesterday on a new constitution that would make. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ruler for life. Over­whelming approval was ex­pected in the two-day referen­dum, despite strong criticism from the left and center that it would give the religious leader "dictatorial powers." 
Some Western observers be­lieve that once K.homeini is constitutionally installed, he may adopt a more conciliatory approach to the deadlock over the 50 American hostages being held by militant students at the 
U.S. Embassy here. 
But Iranian sources reject such conjecture.. They maintain the Iranian leadershtp reflects the people's angry determination to bring the deposed Shah Mo­hammad Reza Pahlavi back to Iran for trial. 
The balloting went relatively smoothly, although there were reports ofminor disturbances in provincial areas where non­Persian ethnic groups have been agitating for greater auto­n?my from the Khomeini re gtme. 
Men and women over the age of 16 filed in separate lines into Tehran's voting stations to make their simple "Yes" or "No" choices with non-secret balots, often aided by Mullahs -Moslem priests-at the ballot boxes in mosques. 

Operators man . switchboard ; provide student service 
by Mike Lewis Executive News Editor 
All of the telephone calls from, to, and within Notre Dame go through a complicated maze of electronic equipment in the basement of the Memorial Library. 
Two operators man the switch­board there from 7:30 a.m. to 
11:30 p.m. each day. Janice Love, one of the operators, said her primary duties are to correct misdialed numbers and provide information for callers, not all of which has to do with the phone system. 
Operators are often asked to provide correct numbers, or report a malfunctioning tele­phone. But they are also asked to settle bets, relate game scores and offer help to oft-confused Notre Dame students. ~ 
"One time a student called me and asked how to cooK a roast," said Joan Krarrier, one of the operators. 
Love added that she was asked to settle a bet earlier this semester. 
''Will you tell this fellow that no girls are allowed on '"ht Notre Dame campus?" :;:~ caller asked. The caller "''as very disappointed with her reply, Love recalled. 
Both operators said their job would be a little easier if students would consult their own books rather than call them for numbe..... The operators' phones are wired so they will not register a busy signal, and 
twelve caUs wd1 "pile up:'~h a 
time. According to Love this 
results in many hurried mo­
ments in the switchboard 
room. 
The switching equipment sits behind the operators' room. Jon Giiroy, a Bell technician assigned to Notre Dame, said there is  'probably enough wire in there to stretch from New York to Los Angeles." 

The equipment is set up to form a "step system," as calls literally progress from one end ofthe room to another while the connection is made. Students dialing long distance are trans­. ferred automatically to an off-
campus operator. 
The system also features 
devices that monitor the flow of 
calls and the amount of traffic 
on N,)[r:: Dame lines. A special 
machine is attached to the 
system and the statistics are 
transmitted to Indianapolis, 
where the results are tabulated.

backs are used in courses. 

More of our books are used at 
Harvard than at Notre Dame," 
he added. 

In addition to the use of the 
University Pressjaperbacks in 
other colleges an universities, 
all books published that carry 
Notre Dame's name are also 
published in England and sold 
1n many parts ofEurope. These 
books are not just books written 
by Notre Dame faculty mem­
bers. In fact, two-thirds of the 
books are from authors outside 
of the Notre Dame community. 
Unlike most university presses around the country, Notre Dame's is self-supporting. It receives no direct subsidizing from the University. "Fewer than ten universities in the country break even,'' said Langford. "We attempt to break even, but we're not here to make a profit." 
Langford cited three immedi­ate goals of the Press. "We plan to sponsor an annual lecture series by world famous people," Langford said. At the present time, the University Press is negotiating with Carlos Fuentes, Mexico's most famous novelist. 
A second plan is to invite national leaders to the univer­sity for a week to give lectures under the sponsorship of Uni­versity Press. "The lectures will ~row into a book that we'll publish," Langford said. 
"We also hope to launch a kind of book club," he said. This club would inform the public of what the Press has to offer and would deal primarily with Notre Dame alumni'. 
"Bookstores are generally lo­cated in shopping centers and they only carry the ten best sellers in fiction, and the ten best sellers in non-fiction. They don't carry more serious kinds of books," Lan~ford said. 
"Most alumni look back and would like to have a continua­tion of the sort of values that they discovered here," Lang­ford said. "Their main connec­tions with the University after they graduate are through re­unions and the Notre Dame Magazine. But there isn't a real consorted sort of continu­in~ education where important thmgs are being brought to their attention." 
The book club would keep in touch with the alumni' and let them know about books that might be interesting to them, what books the press publishes and other books published by other publishers, and it will make it easy for the alumni to order them. 
Notre Dame's Board of Direc­tors of the Alumni Association voted unanimously to encour­age and support the idea. However, the club is still in the planning stage until adequate financing can be found. 
One possibility for financing might be through the expected sales for this year. "We're hoping this year to get sales in the area of $600,000,'' Langford

sity out to the world in aca­
demic circles. The UniversitY 
of Notre Dame Press reflects 
the academic excellence ofwhat 
goes on in the university.'' 
Notre Dame's press started in 
194? and became a major press 
in ~ 1961. The early press 
printed The Scholastic and the 
~otre Dame Ma~azine, but it 
no longer does pnnting. All the 
printing is done in Michigan 
and Harper and Row does all 
the warehousing. 
The Press is located on the 
fiftn floor of the Memorial 
Library and it employs about 
twelve people. The staff is 
small but they do a great deal of 
work. About 800 manuscripts 
are reviewed in a given year 
and out of those, thirty to 
thirty-five of the best manu­
scripts are selected to be pub­
lished. ~ 
The Notre Dame Press pub­lishes a certain kind of book. "It exists to publish books that are deserving of publishing, which commerical publishers (such as Double Day and Har­per and Row) won't publish," Langford said. Landgord cate­~orizes these books as "seri­wus,_ non-fiction," about impor­tant ISSUeS. 
The Press restricts itself to five or six strong areas that it knows it can publish well. Most of these books deal with hu­manities, ethnic studies, philo­sophy, theology, literature and political science. "It you can concentrate on JUSt a few are­as,"· Langford said, "you can build a strong program.'' 
The Notre Dame Press ranks about twenty-fifth out of seven­ty"Seven university presses lo­cated in the entire country in the number of books reviewed and the level of sales. In terms ofrecognition and reputation, it ranks considerably higher than twenty-fifth. For example, Notre Dame was placed in a category with five other univer­sity presses, five times as large, that were included in a New York Times feature story. The profile also included Harvard, Princeton, The Ur :versity of Chicago, Joh Hopk ns, and The University of Caliiornia. "Our program has given the Univer­sity a lot of recognition,'' Langford said. 
Notre Dame's press sells many books to college, univer­sity and public libraries around the country. "There are about 130 colleges and universities

A Church Losing Faith 
Fr. Bill Toohey 
"The church seems bent on making a horrible mistake. It appears poised to 
take a giant leap backwards towards a position of promoting a static concept of 
faith that will be catastrophic to the Christian community." 
These words, shared with us by a bishop last week, carried a punch, not just because they came from a church leader but because this particular bishop, unlike many of his colleagues, is well schooled in the theories of religious educarion and evangelization. 
He was referring to the fact that the church's current catechetical direction is ~...ontrary to the recent renewal of the church, which had been recapturing the correct understanding of faith. · 
In an earlier time, if we were asked the question, "What ill revelation?" many of us would have been inclined to say that revelation is all the truths God has revealed -the teachings, dogmas and doctrines of the church. Faith, then, we thought, is the acceptance of these truths. 
Unfortunately, this is exactly what revelation is not; precisely what faith is not. Revelation has always been, until for involved historical reasons culminating about the 12th and 13th centuries it became distorted -­revelation has always been, not a collection of data or information and truths about God, but the experience of God meeting men and women; an exchange between persons. Consequently, faith is not an acceptance of facts or information, but a response to this Person. It is the total and complete giving of oneself not to some thing but to Someone. 
The failure to clearly understand this has led to great pastoral tragedy in the history of the Catholic Church. It meant, as Newman pointed out, that you had a lot ofpeople who knew the content of their faith (the catechism answers) but whose lives were unchanged. I would call it the "Walter Cronkite problem." _,. 
A lot of people are willing to use the language of faith about Walter Cronkite. They will say: "I believe in Walter Cronkite. I believe he is fairly objective in his news reporting, and that what he tells me is true. I believe in him." 
The problem is this: It's possible for these same people to go no further with Jesus Christ than they have with Walter Cronkite. It's posstble to accept what Jesus says as true, to give him intellectual assent. But this is a far cry from biblical faith, which is not a question ofcerebral acceptance of truths but a total surrender to a rerson. 
A famous writer o a few years ago, Gerald Vann, once shocked his 

Christmas Sarah A. Lanman 
Renaissance style 
It is the Christmas season; the holiday spirit is in the air. Some­where in southern England, in the latter part of the Renaissance, friends are jotning together for a feast and celebration of the sacred occasion. A fire is blazing, while the smell of roast beef, glazed carrots, roast potatoes, and bread fill the great hall. 
A fanfare of trumpets announce the arrival of the guests and the com­mencement of the festivities. 
Thus the atmosphere was set for the beginning of the eighth annual Madrigal Dinners, held at Saint Mary's on November 29, 30 and December 1, 2. The Chamber Singers, the collegium musicum, Opera Workshop, and a score of dancers worked and performed under the direction of Dr. Raymond Sprague and Ms. Caroline Knell (both members of Saint Mary's Music Department) to produce and Elizabethan yuletide banquet. 
As the fifteen to twenty couples danced to a sixteenth-century pavane during their entrance procession, one could see the brilliantly-colored and uniquely-patterned Renaissance cos­
tumes of the guests.  The lord and  
lady  of  the  house  issued  their  
welcome,  while  the  court  jester  

delighted in the excitement of the event. The evenins was a perpetual celebration: begmning witn the welcoming ceremonies, continuing through the meal, and finishing with an after-dinner concert, the enter­tainers provided an endless variety of music and dancing. 
Traditional English tunes, such as the Wassatl Carol and the Boar's Head Carol, signaled that the feast was about to begin. The Christmas punch (or wassail) was a mixture consisting of wine or ale, spices, and baked apples and served 10 a large bowl. The drink was "well received" by the guests, who kept the dozen costumed servers busy throughout the evening. Cries of "Wassail!" were frequently heard, since the word was also an early English toast to om... 's health 
' ... t. ............... ·~· ... ,. ·~ .  ... .  -""}  
After the appropriate blessings over the food were made, assorted forms of entertainment continued through­out the meal. Several French branles (or in English, brawls) were perform­ed by the dancers: these independ­ent popular dances in duple or triple meter date back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Throughout the Medieval and Renaissance eras wandering minstrels often provided their songs in exchange for food and lodging. This tradition was reflected in the arrival of a minstrel, who sang traditional Christmas carols with guitar accompaniment. Michael Praetorius was generally known in the sixteenth century for his Syntag­ma musicum, a treatise of music that described the various instruments of the period. But Praetorius was a composer as well as a theorist: several of his works, such as ]Dseph, Lieber, joseph Mein, were perform­ed by the collegium musicum, a SMC instrumental ensemble consisting of recorders, tambourine, violin, cello, and harpsichord. 
The final fanfare of trumpets an­nounced the upcoming after-dinner concert. Sing We and Chant It, performed by the Chamber Singers and written by Thomas Morley, an Elizabethan composer, typifies the English madrigal of the time. Other works by Morley included April is in My Mistress' Face, Shoot, False Love, I Care Not, and Dainty, Fine Sweet Nymph. Several dance compo­sitions by Tielman Susato (who was better known as a publisher of chansons or songs) were featured along with Cesare Negri's dance, So Ben mi ch' a Bon Tempo. This composition included Renaissance choreography created specifically for the work. 
The lively dancing, the Renaissance musical compositions, the elaborate costumes, and the abundant food all contributed to the authenticity of the evening's festivities. The Madrigal Dinners successfully captured the spirit of an Elizabethan feast, while creating a unique atmosphere for the rpl,,.ht"~ · of the Christmas season. 
contemporaries with the kind of shock we need again today, when he said: "I don't believe in the dogmas, doctrines and teachings of the Catholic church. No, I ~~lieve through them in the living reality beyond -in the person of Jesus. 
God Himself, as Aquinas insisted, is the reality for the believing person. The current trend towards a static concept of faith, with its over-emphasis on memorization of the ''deposit of truths,'' fails to appreciate what authentic faith is all about. 
There is a content of-revealed truth, which is protected and transmitted through the church. And this cognitive element, this knowledge content of faith, is very important. But it is completely secondary and supplementary to the experiential, to the actual experience of encountering the Lord, who calls us to covenant and discipleship. 
The current crisi'> of faith comes from stressing the cognitive without respecting the experiential. We are in danger of perverting revelation, once again, into a thing --a collection of information, a mere body of facts. Churchmen onct> ,!.gain seem to be on the brink of forgetting that revelation is an event wherein God himself personally communicates to us throu~h various means (e.g., scripture, sacraments, historical events and especially other people), to establish and deepen a relationship of faithful love. 
It is in the personal experience that is revelation that Christ encounters us, speaks to us, shows us who we are, and propos~s that we drop what we're doing to follow Li{ll. The fact that the current trend concentrates on information about God rather than on promoting occasions to actually encounter God is the reason why informed people like the bishop I referred to are becoming so alarmed. 
''A. static concept offaith," the bishop told me, "has always led to tragedy Confusing faith with mere doctrinal knowledge made it possible, for example, for Catholics in Nazi Germany to have the best catechisms in the world and to be the most effectively instructed Catholics all the time Hitler was destroying the Jewish people.'' 
This same differentiation between theological literacy and authentic faith, between intellectual information and spiritual formation, means that it could be possible for someone to have a straight 4.0 in theology courses and be, in fact, an atheist. It is one thiug to know facts; it is quite another to live a totally differen~ kind of life because of a transforming encounter with the living God. 
ND!SMC Costume-Making A Full Scale Production 
As preparation for the play The Herress entered its final stages, the staff of the SMC/ND costume shop 
-meticulously put the finishing touch­es on their creations. These uniquely fashioned outfits were donned on opening night. The costume shop personnel consists of eight work/ study students, five drama students and two volunteers. Involvement is not limited to d.rama majors, but is open to anyone interested in costume design. There are a variety of activities in which to participate. Theatrical accessories, for instance, such as make-up and wie-s as well as the basic costumes, are fashioned' at the shop. . 
Dee Hawfield, a~sistant professor of Speech and Drama at SMC, designs the apparrel and oversees preduction. Along with her shop duties, Hawfield also teaches courses in Costume Desi_gn and Fashion at SMC. Before begtnning to design the costumes for a particular play, Haw­field sets aside two or three weeks to research the historical context of the play. The study includes influences such as the artwork and embroidery of the time. In designing cos{umes for The Heiress, Hawfield even investigated the etiquette of the 1850's. 
According to Hawfield, however, costumes must suit the personalities of the characters, not just the era of a play. For this reason, she believes that costumes do not necessarily have to be precisely historically accurate. For instance, in The Heiress, hoop skirts are worn by the actresses, though historically, this type of skirt is not introduced until about six years after the date that the play takes place. The theory at work behind the use of the hoop skirts is that a costume may influence the mood of an actress, and hence, her approach to a character. The skirts, in allowing greater freedom of movement, lend 
Kathy Murray 
themselves to a more spontaneous 
performance. 
One problem encountered at the 
costume workshop is high worker 
turnover rate. Many student workers 
cannot cope with the intensity of the 
two week production schedules. And 
many would-be workers are unaware 
of the costume shop's existence (in 
the basement of Moreau Hall). 
The costume shop houses all of the 
costumes worn in previous SMC/ND 
theatrical productions. Occasionally 
an outfit is reused, though the 
number of ready-made costumes is so 
small that most must be made from 
scratch. Costumes are loaned to the 
Saint Mary's Srudent Government 
and to the Music Department for 
school functions such as the Madrigal 
Dinners. In addition, they are some­
times loaned to local high sthools. In any case, strict loan procedures are adhered to, to insure that costumes are returned in good condition. 
Just as previously used costumes are orgamzed according to their historical period and stored, the patterns used to create them are also filed for reuse. For Dee Hawfield, designing costumes involves not only mixing and matching patterns,! but relying on improvisation in creating gowns, petticoats and suits. 
It stands to reason, that making elaborate clothing might prove very expensive. Through buying the need­ed materials in bulk and soliciting the generous contributions of local cloth­ters, expenses are held at a mini­mum. Naturally, some productions are more expensive that others, and while the costumes for The Heiress only cost about eight hundred dol­lars, the costumes for Hamlet, cost about fourteen hundred dollars. If seeing beautiful, creatively made garments interests you, go to see The Heiress---better yet, go offer your services at the costume shop!

The Heiress -A Striking Study 
The Heiress, a play by Ruth and Augustus Goetz, (based on Henry James' novel Washington Square), is a striking study of subtle cruelty between parent and offspring, and between lovers. Directing such a play on stage is no easy task; and exploration of the cruelty, and its outcomes, must be presented both sensitively and revealingly for the play to be successful. For the most part, Frederic Syburg's ND/SMC Theater's production, which opened last Friday, at Saint Mary's O'Laugh­lin Hall, succeeds. 
The entire action of this seven scene play occurs in the handsome parlor of one Dr. Austin Sloper's home in Washington Square in New York, in the nineteenth century. Sloper is a bitterly di~illusioned map, having lost a beauuful young wtfe upon the birth of their daughter, Catherine, who is now a gentle but unexceptional young woman. Know­ing she will never have the beauty or grace of her mother, Sloper does not hesitate to remind the girl of the fact. And when a forcune-hunting gentle­man, Morris Townsend, breezesin to woo and win Catherine and her inheritance, Sloper relentlessly strives to expose Morris' motives, at the expense of his daughter's feel­ings. By the end of the play, Catherine has been jilted,and is cooly a stony woman, which enables her to revenge herself against Morris with stingy subletly 
Sophom.orf' John Davenport per­forms superbly as the disenchanted doctor, obssessed by his daughter's lack of startling qualities. "Help her to be clever," he icily instructs Lavina, his sister. When she indignantly responds with "She's

Apocalypse Now is the $31 million 
doUar, three years-in-the making 
masterpiece about war. It is tenuous­
ly based on Joseph Conrad's novel 
Heart of Darkness. An awesome 
movie experience, it is quite possibly 
the finest cinematic undertaking of 
all time. Lampooned by some as 
being a monument to his vibrantly 
expansive ego, Cop~ola' s Apocalypse 
Now is a rare treat tn both narrative 
sophistication and orgiastic visual 
imagery. 
Superbly screenwritten by Michael

throughout. ~:>rotagonist Cap~ain 
Willard's narrattve echoes reflecttve­
ly as he ascends the Nom River in 
search of the legendary outlaw, 
Colonel Kurtz. In addition to the 
directorial genius of Coppola, virtuoso cinematographer Vittorio Storaro and production designer Dean Davoularis combine their formidable talents to create a movie that rarely spills over into dramatic exce~s, bombast or 
ludicrous st~reotyptn.$. . 
The stunnmg openmg scene IS a visual extraction from the eschato­logical images of St. J.ohn's !3ook of Revelation. -Demomc hehcopters circle the jungle like infernal ~agon­flies even vultures, searchmg for uns~specting prey. Their buzzing evokes the childhood terror of Wells' War of the Worlds. We know these are machines made by men, yet somehow they possess a spirit infus­ed by an alien consciousness, a destructive UFO invader coming to ravage and obliterate. The nightma!­ish aura is enhanced by the eene 
wails of "Jim Morrison, dead lead

clever.'' Davenport maintains this brittle attitude until at long last the doctor sees Catherine's love--and Catherine has little left to give him. In this powerful scene, the doctor is reduced to a pathetic shadow of his former, domineering self, and Cath­erine assumes his previous persona1i · ty. "You are cruel," he implores h.er, to which she replies, "I have been taught by masters." 
At first, Cathy Hurst, as Catherine, was more stiff than painfully shy, b~t she soon settled into her characf!et and admirably developed her from a trembling girl who "disappears into the pantry'  whenever company ar­ives, into a cooly assertive woman. She is most appealing as the early,

a sleazy hotel in downtown Saigon: 
Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) ts 
rapidly moving from despondency to 
madness, saying ''Everytime I wake 
up, I think I'd be bac~ ~n ~he jungle." 
He receives a new mtsston: to find 
the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon 
Brando) and "terminate with ex­
treme prejudice." This chilling order 
crystallizes the icr. amorality of 
warfare whereby military and politi­
cal adv~ntage supercedes all ethical 
considerations. 
Kurtz, meanwhile, has supposedly 
gone insane in the jungles of Cam­bodia. He leads a wacky, but fiercely devoted army of AWOLs who join with the indigenous POJ?Ulation to establish a cult, whose Idol is the . demi-God Kurtz. Willard knows strange adventures await him: ''I was going to the worst place in the 
world, and I didn't know it yet."

reminded me of the neutron btvnb 
controversy: buildings over peopk 
This time it was a puppy over 
persons. Another intense scene 
involved the men looking for man­
goes, who found a tiger mstead. It 
jarred me with fright, reminiscent of 
those scenes when the nefarious 
people-eater of jaws swallowed half 
of Martha's Vineyard for a snack in 
1976. 
Included were equally moving 

scenes involving the juxtaposition of 
two totally disparate cultures--Amer­
can and Asian--tragically interlocked 
in a war that none of its doomed 
performers understood. A USOshow 
conjured up afloating Caesar's Pal­
ace. The USO show ended 
antically, with the· pretty ladies' 
gyrations precipitatins a forceful· 
uprising of randy soldiers eager for 
action of a non-military nature. 
Herr's screenwriting excelled dur­

Wtllard's subordinates said: "we're

The dazzling displays of neon and

the shame of America's cavalier 
gaudiness in the midst of this 
hellhole of a war. A carnival in 
Hades, methought. Yet, without the

euphoria, how could anyone have 
es~;aped that madhouse alive, with 
bodY., soul and mind intact? Even 
devtls need to sins, however grating 
and moribund thetr song. 
The confrontation with Kurtz is 
disappointingly anticlimactic. This 
denouncement suffers from over­
tones of moral murkiness and phil­
isophical vacuity. Horror and evil are 
gallantly sought, presented and ex­
plicated. But Kurtz is not a 
convmcing ogre, nor the epitome of 
evil. To his people, he is "a

tic conclusion. No such dilemma in O'Laughlin Hall; the audience .was delighted with revenge, as he ts an easily dislikable, overly-flattering blackguard. O'Brien is more con­vincing when he is quarreling rather than courting,-as in the scene where Dr. Sloper learns of their engage­ment, and the two men exchange a 
verbal volley of irate accusations. 
The play ts not without its lig?ter moment, which are mostly provt~ed by Sloper's one-lif_le;' a~d by Lavma Penniman, Cathenn s wtdowed aunt, played by Christine Foy. Foy ~ret;zes through her role as the stghmg, swooning, isn't-love-wonderful busy­body aunt, and has a fine sef_lse of comic timing and expres.siOn. When Catherine :>,nd Morns are planning to elope, Lavina pouts "Oh, I so wish I could go with you.  In the play' slighter moments, Foy steals the show. 
Other brief but noteworthy per­
formances include Theresa Rebeck as 
Marie, the Irish maid, Anne Patter­
son as Catherin's kindly Aunt Eliza­
beth, Kate Goerner as her ever-beam 
ing daughter, Marian, and Brian 
Wolfe as Arthur Townsend, Marian's 
fiancee. Lisa Jaquez plays Mrs. 
Montgomery, Morris widowed sister, 
who valiantly tries to protect her 
brother when Dr. Sloper barrages her 
with questionsabouthis character. 
An impressive array of hooped 
skirts and gowns bonnets, and men's 
suits, stiched by Diana Hawfield's 
costume crew, along with a well­
furnished set, adds to the ninteenth 
century atmosphere of the play.

carnage of his benevolence in the decapitated heads and lacerated bod­ies hanging from bamboo trees, I did not get the feeling that he is a genume monster. I mean, how bad can anyone be who elucidates the poetry of T. S. Eliot as well as Brando? Or a man whose vision is deep enough to ascertain the incipi­ent horror, and genius, of an enemy without feeling, morals, or reason? 
The horror which Kurtz describes (th~ Viet Cong hacking off the vaccinated arms of children, one by one) is authentic. However, the impression made is somewhat muf­fled, misty, even uninspiring. It doesn't galvanize that gut-level feel­ing ofoutrage and existential nausea, the kind felt when confronted nakedly with the blackest evil or an irredeem­able atrocity. I do not fault Coppola or' Brando, but attribute this short­coming to the intrinsic limitation of film itself, a medium wt.kh attempts to capture those cavernous depths in the soul of humanity, and do it in a way that is dramatically comprehen­sible to a mass audience. 
Near the end, the film magnificently depicts the ritualistic cult slaughter of a bull to parallel tht .simultaneous termination of Kurtz at the hands "Jf Willard. 
As the credits are shown, the film culminates as spectacularly as it began. A search and destroy mission extinguishes the remnani:s of Kurtz's hamlet. This glowing, polychromat­. ic spectacle is a breathless repre­sentation of the Pentagon vs. Angkor Wat, of B-52s vs.wooden arrows, of insanity vs. intractability, of power vs. peasantry, of West vs.East.

... Meredith 
[continued from page 12] 

Meredith assisted on Devine's goal, but scored the final two to ~ive Notre Dame its first victory m nine games in Madison. With Wisconsin's Jim Scheid off for interference, Meredith scored his first goal on a deflection of a ] eff Brown­schidle slapshot from the right point. The Irish captain beat goalie Roy Shultz at 8:31 of the second period to give Notre Dame a 3-2 lead. 
Then at 13:28 Notre Dame's John Higgins and Badger Dave Speer erupted into a fight after Speer had hit Higgins across the back with his stick. Both rlayers were disqualified from the ~arne, and Higgins received a mmor penalty for roughing. 
Wisconsin took advantage of the power play with a goal by Todd Lecy at 15:51 to even the score at 3-3. Todd had taken the puck on a pass across the 
and had plenty of room to slip it by Irish goalie Bob McNamara. Meredith scored the game winner at 6:17 of the third period when he grabbed a rebound of a Brownschidle slapper, skated to the right of 
Schultz and backhanded it over the sprawled Badger goalie. 
McNamara played superbly for the Irish in the third period, stopping all 12 Wisconsin at-

ND takes Taylor Tournament 
by Mark Hannuksela Sports Wn'ter 

It's always nice to open the season with a win. Two wins rnakes for double pleasure. So v.hy was coach Sharon Petro not overly elated about the Notre Dame women's basketball team's pair of opentng 
victories? 

"I guess it's because I'm worried about Michigan (this Saturday's opponent)," stated Petro, in her third year as coach at Notre Dame. "We were in 
an up-and-down phase this weekend, and we just can't co11tinue to be that inconsistent and expect to do well against a team ltke Michigan. We will definitely have to work on that this week." 
From a statistical standpoint, Petro has to be pleased, because her team came home Saturday night as the champ­ions of the Taylor University tournament. They opened with a 68-60 win over always tough Marion College, and then went on to defeat Cedarville College of Ohio in the finals, 73-60. In both contests, the Irish played their !>trongest basketball in the first half. 
Against Marion, a team which beat the Irish in last year's regular season, 65-63, Notre Dame built a 34-26 lead by halftime, and then played to a 34-34 standoff in the second half. 
Two centers, freshman Shari Matvey and sophomore Tricia McManus, led the way for the Irish. Matvey, in her debut as a Notre Dame player, scored 21 points, pulled down 14 rebounds, and added six blocked shots to lead the team in all three catagories. McMan­us added 14 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. Senior co-captain Molly Cashman was the only other player in double figure~, as he chipped in with 11 points. 
Jane Polttiski, who set a team scoring record when she fired in 29 points in the two-point loss to Marion last year, was not as effective this time around, scorin~ only six points and grabbmg four rebounds. 
In defense of her 5-11 center, Petro said "Jane really didn't feel well all weekend. She was battling a terrible cold, and I'm really surprised that she was able to play as well as she did under the circumstances. Saturday she came back and had an outstanding game, and she still hasn't fully recovered.'' , 
Outstanding might be the only way to describe Politiski's _per­formance against Cedarvtlle, because the senior co-captain scored 18 points, and added eight rebounds to help the Irish to their 13-point win. Again it was a case of the Irish jumping out to an early lead. They outscored their OJ?ponents 3 7-22 in the first 20 mmutes of play, only to be outscored 38-36 in the second half. Thirteen turnovers contributed to the second half drop.

MADISON, Wis.-Overall, the memories the Notre Dame hoc­key team carries from the Dane County Memorial Coliseum are not good. 
That is not surprising when you consider the record the Irish post there against their oldest Western Collegiate Hockey Association rival, Wis­consin. In 24 games at the Dane "rumble rink," Notre 
''I wish I knew how to correct turnovers, because that's one thing that has plagued us for each of our three years,'' Petro stated. ''For some reason, they don't phase our players too much, but maybe that's because we don't get burned on them enough. Of course I hope it never comes to that, but it still worries me." 
One thing that does not worry 
-[continued on page 11] 
four. 
But for now, the memories the Irish have are not so bad. The reason is win number four, which Notre Dame collected via a 4-3 victory over the Badgers Saturday night. That win followed a 5-2 Wisconsin tri­umph in the series OJ?ener Friday, and gave the Insh a split in their last WCHA series before Christmas break. 
Notre Dame finishes up the first half of the regular schedule this weekend with two non-lea­gue contests, one at Bowling Green Friday and the other at home versus Western Michigan Sunday afternoon. The Irish take a 5-5 league record into exam week, and are 8-5 overall. 
Wisconsin is 6-6 in WCHA play and 7-6 overall. 
"You're never happy when you lose one,'' said Notre Dame coach Lefty Smith. "But when you consider the misfortune we faced, I've got to say it was pleasing to come back for the win Saturday." 
Most si~mficant among the absent Insh Friday night was senior captain Greg Meredith, who missed the game because of a Rhodes Scholarship inter­view back in his native Toronto. 
He flew into Madison Satur­day afternoon in time enough, however, to pace the Insh victory with two goals and one assist. Included in those two scores was the game winner. 
"I don't want to take anything away from anyone else,'' said Smith, "but special recognition certainly should be paid to Meredith, and also to Tom Michalek. Both players were just outstanding. Michalek had to carry the leadership burden Friday. ni.ght alone when Greg was m1ssmg. 
''Then Saturday night both players logged an incredible amount of ice time. For them to perform as they did has to pick up the rest of the team. The vah(e of Greg to our club was shown in the goal scoring column as well on Saturday."
