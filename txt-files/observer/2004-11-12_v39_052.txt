E-mail warns students of cab driver threat 
By ANGELA SAOUD Saint Mary's Editor 
Students at Saint Mary's received an e-mail Thursday warning them of a cab driver or cab drivers soliciting students to pose for pictures in hotel rooms. 
According to the e-mail, sent by Vice President of Student Affairs Linda Timm, the driver or drivers solicits Saint Mary's students to pose for pictures by offering them various amounts of money. The e­mail noted there "have also been requests for other sex acts with groups of individuals so that encounters can be videotaped." 

The e-mail stated that one spe­cific driver has been identified and was issued a no trespass order, forbidding the driver to come onto the Saint Mary's campus. 
Saint Mary's Security is monitor­ing the situation, as are other appropriate authorities in the sur­rounding communities, the e-mail said. 
The e-mail also noted the amounts of money offered for sex­ual acts have been "significant and intentionally enticing." 
In her e-mail, Timm warned the campus of the dangers of an activ­ity like this. 
"The technology that exists today will allow pictures and video such as is being requested to be sent out over the Internet. It is hard to know just how far such pictures will travel and in whose hands they may arrive," Timm wrote. "Pictures such as these often have a way of surfacing later in one's life when it is least expect­ed. Do not place yourself in this type of situation. The money may sound attractive, but the conse­quences can be dangerous, some­times fatal." 
The e-mail said any student who feels uncomfortable with anything a cab driver says or does should have the driver bring her to Saint Mary's and call security immedi­ately. 
Saiut Mary's Spokesperson Melanie McDonald said all the information Saint Mary's has was released to students in the e-mail.

Seniors bid farewell to football 
Band, cheerleaders cherish memories 
By EILEEN DUFFY 
News Writer 
One hundred two marching band members will play their last notes and 13 cheerleaders will veil their last cheer in Notre Dame Stadium on Saturday afternoon. 
"It's really hard to believe that Saturday will be my last time marching out of the tunnel and onto the field," Sarah Paulson. president and four­year member of the band, said. "The marching band has been a huge part of my experience here at Notre Dame, and I don't think that I've realized yet that after Saturday it's going to be ending." 
Assistant drum major Dan Ferretti recalled some memo­rable experiences made possi­ble by being in the band. 
"I have had the opportunity to perform in some of the greatest venues in college football ­Doak-Campbell Stadium at Florida State, Neyland Stadium in Tenne.ssee, Michigan Stadium and of course Notre Dame Stadium," he said.

Leprechaun Legion T-shirt. 
By PETER LEAHY News Writer 
Taking a cue from the famed Shirt, the Leprechaun Legion shirts declaring "No shirt No shoes No tie No prob­lem" are on sale at the book­store for the first time, with profits from the $15 purchase going to charity. 
According to Leprechaun Legion president and Knott senior Brian Tracy, the T-shirt used to promote Notre Dame basketball was not always student designed or sold to the general public. 
"Sports promotions always made a student T-shirt," Tracy said ..

Class of 2005 looks back at game traditions 
By BETH ERICKSON 
News Writer 
Three years ago, the Class of 2005 sat together in the far reaches of the student section, looking forward to what then seemed like endless Saturdays of gridiron and tailgates. But this Saturday, these students will be rooting on the Irish from the stu­dent section for the last time. 
As the final home game draws near, the seniors are anxious for a win. 
"I just really hope we win, and I hope it's a memorable game," senior Erin Phillips said. "I can't believe it's our last game." 
Some come for the thrill of the athletics, others for the atmos­phere. 
"There's nothing better than actually looking forward to wak­ing up at 7 a.m.," senior Joe Swiderski said. "I'll miss the ran­domness of it all. The unexpected is always the best, like when we came back and beat Michigan this year." 
Others come for the Stadium experience. "I will miss the Stadium hot

Notre Dame students restricted from spring travel to Cuba 
Theology class nixes trip due to new law 
By MADDIE HANNA News Writer 
Due to tightened U.S. govern­ment restrictions on travel to Cuba, a group of Notre Dame students will no longer be able to make Cuba their spring break destination in March. 
University General Counsel Carol Kaesebier informed the­ology professor Father Robert Pelton Oct. 27 that his "From 

.Power to Communion" theolo­gy class could not proceed with their third-annual Cuba trip, scheduled for March 5-13, 2005. 
"Am I surprised and unhappy with this development? The answer is yes," Pelton said. 
The new law, announced June 30, permits student travel to Cuba only if the trip lasts a minimum of 10 weeks and entails a structured education­al program, formal courses of study or teaching at a Cuban academic institution, said Kaesebier. 
Students may travel to Cuba for less than 10 weeks, but must be either conducting graduate research specifically related to Cuba, sponsoring a Cuban national to teach in the 
U.S or organizing and prepar­ing licensed educational activi­ties. The Cuba service trip will be one of the main University programs affected by the poli­cy change. 
Despite these allowances, Kaesebier said travel to Cuba WOIJld be strongly curtailed. 
"Our ability to take trips with students is going to be severely limited," she said. "It [the trip] has to meet the new guide­lines, which is very difficult to do. Most trips aren't 10 weeks." 
·Also, Kaesebier said only Notre Dame students or faculty could be authorized to use the University's travel, a change from the past when students from other institutions were free to participate in any Notre Dame programs that involved travel to Cuba. 
Despite the strict restric­tions, Pelton said. he was confi­dent the travel situation would improve at some point. 
"My personal opinion is that there will be a change that will take place in the near future, next year or so, since there is so much pressure ag~inst it [the new restrictions]." Pelton said. 
According to Pelton, the class will be taught as usual with a new focus on bringing Cubans to Notre Dame. Lecturers will visit throughout the spring semester. 
Even though undergraduates will no longer be able to travel to Cuba, students have still shown strong interest in the class, said Pelton.

One last chance 
It's all over Saturday. 
The Notre Dame Stadium lights will be shining down on our cold bodins as wn look out onto the field for our last time as students. 
The team will 
have already saluted us with thnir gold hnlmets and the rest of the fans will have left thn Stadium, but some of' us will just be sitting there in thn frenz­

ing Novnmber Matt Lozar 
1wening, .with 
tears rolling 
down our cheeks, Editor-in-Chief 
not wanting it to 
end. 
Unfortunately, it will have to. 
Notre Dame football did have an 
impaet on my college decision. I 
could have stayed at home and got­
ten a scholarship to a very good 
school. Knowing I would have 
passed up the opportunity to spend 
four y1~ars at the University I had 
watched on TV sinen I was 5 years 
old would have haunted me forever. 
The nwmories aren't overf'lowing 
in my mind about Notre Dame games 
from our youth. I rmnnmher wearing 
my I CJSS national championship T­
shirt and watching Shawn Woodnn 
knock down Charlio Ward's pass in 
thn Came of the CPntury. 
That's why this wnnkend will be so 
dil"ficult. That's why I avoided talk­
ing, thinking and writing about it for 
wonks. · 
It took me IS years to get to Notre 
Damn Stadium and nJJw in what 
sun~ly didn't snmn like three and a 
half y1mrs, it's almost over. 
My first Notre Dame homn football 
game was Sept. 22, 2001 against 
Michigan State, 11 days after tho 
9/11 tnrrorist attacks. Combining the 
emotions of that first gamo along 
with SO.OOO people holding 
American !lags chanting "U-S-A" is 
something I didn't appreciate at the 
time, but do so now. 
Our four years weren't storybook. 
The team didn't win a national title. 
We'll remember Boston College as 
that team we never beat and always 
hate. The only thing that was consis­
tent was the inconsistency. 
The two field-storming wins over 
Miehigan, the road trips to see state­
ment victories at Florida State and 
Tennessee and the Heturn to Glory 
are just some of the good memories 
that will be brought up years from 
now. 
The ushers will give us extra time, 
but at one point it must be over 
because, as painful as it is for me to 
write this, we do have to move on. 
The next time we watch a Notre 
Dame game in the Stadium, we will 
be alumni. We'll be the ones hosting 
the tailgates, inviting students and 
trying to feel young again. We won't 
be standing for four hours, tailgating 
like champions or doing push-ups. . As students, Saturday's our last chance. Take your time leaving the Stadium. I know I will.

Judge says squirrel can live with couple 
HARRISBURG, Pa. -Nutkin the Squirrel can live out her later years hunting nuts indoors with a Pennsylvania couple, a court has ruled. 
The gray squirrel, which was born in South Carolina where there are no rules against domesti­cating wild squirrels, may be kept by a Schuylkill County couple despite state laws that prohibit keeping wild animals as pets, a Superior Court panel ruled Friday. 
Senior Judge Joseph Hudock, in an 11-page 
opinion, had fun recount­ing Nutkin's early years ["Then one day tragedy struck: Nutkin fell from her tree nest!"] and relo­cation from South Carolina to Pennsylvania in 1994 ["Dark clouds began to gather."]

SMC virtualtnagazine "Welcotnes prospects 
By APRIL THOMAS News Writer~ 
Prospective Saint Mary's stu­dents ean now experience the col­lege's campus without leaving home. 
Saint Mary's free virtual maga­zine-V-Mag-has been added to the College's homepage, inviting prospective student..<; to go on a vir­tual tour of the building~ and grounds. 
According to Nick Farmer, Saint Mary's director of marketing and communications, V-Mag was ini­tially ollercd only to accepted stu­dents and not publidy display~d on the college's homepage. 
"This year the program is offen~d to prospective students, before the application process even begins," Farmer said. 
The first issue features the guid­ance of two current student host­esses and seeks to give an accu­rate portrayal of the school's aca­demic, spiritual and social atmos­phere. 
Junior Anna Bauer, one of the hostesses, _got involved with V-Mag through student government. 
"I think the best part about the process was the student involve­ment from the very beginning," Bauer said. "The producers made it a point to use real student inter­views. stories and perceptions in writing the scripts." 
NewGame Communications cre­ated the V-Mag to appeal to today's teenagers. In V-Mag's first year, the company employed both Saint Mary's College and Georgetown University as initial test subjects. 
Mary Pat Nolan, Saint Mary's director of admissions, saw poten­tial in the idea. 
'The admissions staff was look­ing for 'a cutting-edge, technologi­cally savvy way to communicate with accepted student<;, a way that would present the benefits of a Saint Mary's education from our most credible sources -Current students, faculty and alumnae," Nolan said. 
Now in its third year, the newly enhanced virtual magazine has been helping differentiate Saint Mary's from other colleges and reduce traditional marketing costs. 
Despite its success, the virtuaL tour is not meant to be a final step in decision-making. 
"The V-Mag is not intended to be a replacement for the campus visit ... rather, it is an exciting invita­tion to learn more," Nolan said. 
Bauer said producing the Saint Mary's V-Mag gave her the oppor­tunity to share her enthusiasm for her school. 
"This was one of the best experi­ences during my college career thus far," Bauer said. "It was so much fun to get to share this place with prospective students and hope that my story can help therri come here and love it as much as I do."

Law students help immigrants 
By PAUL SPADAFORA 
News Writer 
In an effort to help citizens of foreign countries apply for res­idency in the United States, law students are volunteering ~to help those in need file their applications to the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program. 
The Diversity Program is a government lottery that selects 55,000 of the applicants for legal permanent resident visas. Law students are helping pre­pare the applications of any willing participant that wishes to apply. 
Anne Egan, a third-year law student, said the services the . law students provide help those with no access to a com­puter fill out the exclusively online application. 
"Since the program stopped using paper applications two years ago, we've been running this program," Egan said. 
The law students set up com­puter kiosks at the local Robinson Community Center and guide applicants through the process. 
"There are really specific requirements necessary, so we take the applicants picture and go through [their application] step-by-step," Egan said. "It's especially helpful if there are language barriers that would make applying difficult." · 
Volunteers at the program take the required digital photo of the applicant, and then help the applicant complete their application. 
"We go through the basic forms, country of origin, etc," Egan said. 
Volunteers also aid those who are filling out applications for their entire family. 
"We also try to file applica­tions for their spouse and chil­dren, but it's more difficult because they need to bring dig­ital photos of all the members who are applying," Egan said. 
Egan said that the pro­

options for immigrants 
"One of the purposes of the immigration law is to help pro­mote diversity, by helping countries that are traditionally underrepresented by immigra­tion in the United States." 
· Hosty said. Egan explained who the law applies to. "There are two main caps for eligibility," Egan said. "The !irst is that immi­grants from

According to Katie Hosty, a third-year law student, the program is an extension of a class on immigration law. 
"It's part of the class that you do [an immigration] project within the community, because throughout the semester you're learning how the immigration laws in the United States work, along with the various pro­grams that people can use to ticular country." 

Despite the lim­itations, Egan said the program is an excellent stepping-stone to full citizenship. 
"As a legal permanent resi­dent, you can apply for citizen­ship after five years of resi­dence." Egan said. "This would almost always be the first step that an immigrant to the U.S. takes ... it's their first step on the road to full citizenship." 
This year, law students will be running the Robinson Community Center kiosks on Nov. 18, from 6 to 8 p.m. and Nov. 20, from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.

Despite the ups and downs of the team's record during the past four years, students have faithfully descended upon the stadium dressed for the Sea of' Green for every home game. 
''I just remember the four years of' games as being really fun, I don't re<!IIY remember which games we won and which ones we lost," Phillips said. "I just have an overall feeling of pride at all thfl games."

The Leprechaun Legion has already become a popular organi­zation on campus, and is on pro­bationary club status right now, with expectations to achieve offi­cial club status next year. 
As with football's 'Sea of Green', the Leprechaun Legion s.hirt serves as a symbol of unity for fans and support for the team, Tracy said. 
Student opinion on the shirt is mixed. Pasquerilla East freshman tory, most seniors agree that rush­ing the field after the two home match-ups against Michigan made for the best football experiences during their time at Notre Dame. 
"My favorite home game memo­ry is either the Michigan game from sophomore year or the Michigan game from this year," Meehan said. "I think it's the Michigan game from this year because it was so unexpected and provided a great start to senior.

Although the Class of 2005 faced many troubles with ushers this season, most feel that the tradition­al senior marshmallow tight will go on undeterred this year. 
"[fhe seniors] better do it," sen­ior Jenna Linder said .. "It's going to be wild, it's going to redefine all my moments at Notre Dame." 
In the past, the ushers haven't been as strict at the last game as they were earlier in the season when enforcing the rules concern-
Tamara Buretz said the shirt is acceptable. 
"I like it. It's kind of plain but it's nice," she said. "I don't get Ithe back of the shirt], and I think it's dumb." 
On the other hand, Steve Przywara, a Keough freshman, said he really liked the shirt. 
"The textile manufacturer who created this fabric, I believe there is no word to describe this genius," Przwara said. 
In years past, the Leprechaun Legion used to make money off its own shirt sales, while students who bought tickets received the shirt designed by Sports promo­tions. As a result the Legion has enough money in the treasury to support itself until it receives Notre Dame funding as an official

Humors are that the ushers usu­ally give seniors the go-ahead for their traditional marslmmllow war, though that stands unconfirmed. 

''I've heard that the uslwrs haw said they understand that it's a spe­cial smlior tradition and they have no problem with the seniors stay­ing longer," senior .Joanna Cornwell said. 
Seniors will most likely be the first to arrive and the last to leave the stadium Saturday, but when the day comes to an ond the nostal­gia will begin.

Palestinians grieve for Arafat 
Successors quickly named, but questions remain unanswered after leader's death 
Associated Press 

HAMALLAH Palestinians at home and abroad wept, waved flags and burned tires Thursday in an eruption of grief at the death of Yasser Arafat, the man they consider the father of their nation. The quick appointment of suc­cessors did little to dispel the huge question marks now hanging over Mideast peace efforts. 
Although Arafat's death at 75 led some world leaders to talk about the possibility of a new era, the outlook was also shadowed by fears of a chaotic transition and a strengthening of Islamic militants. 
The burial arrangements in themselves showed how disrupted the region is. The international funeral was to be held in Egypt, because few Arab l(;laders would travel to Israeli-controlled Palestinian land; Arafat was to be buried in the West Bank town of Ramallah because Israel refused to approve interment in .Jerusalem; and most mourners from the Gaza Strip would be barred from traveling across lsrae!i ter­ritory to Hamallah, a securi­ty official said.

Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -A senior CIA offi­cer who has become an outspoken critic of the fight on terrorism turned in his resignation this week, citing a desire to speak more freely about problems in the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the debate over intelligence reform. 
Current government officials are rarely as vocal as Mike Scheuer, who wrote "Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror." But he called the decision to leave the agency after 22 years "entirely my own." 
"I have concluded that there has not been adequate national debate over the nature of the threat posed by Osama bin Laden and the forces he leads and inspires, and the nature and dimensions of intelli­gence reform needed to address that threat," Scheuer said in a statement sent to reporters Thursday via elec­tronic mail. 
Scheuer's CIA assignments includ­ed running the bin Laden unit from January 1996 to June 1999. He hopes his experience and views will produce a more substantive debate. 
This week, Scheuer ignored agency orders and began granting interviews about shortfalls in the hunt for bin Laden, the findings and recommendations of the Sept. 11 and the intelligence community overall. 
During a wide-ranging interview Sunday evening, Scheuer was highly critical of the Sept. 11 Commission's "refusal" to point fingers at senior government officials whose actions contributed to the attacks. Rather than changing the structure of gov­ernment, as Congress is considering, he said a signal must be sent that people will be held accountable for their actions. 
"No one seems to be capable or inclined to find anyone responsible for 9/11," he said.

Prist calls for end to filibusters 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON -Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist on Thursday urged Democrats to stop blocking President Bush's federal court nomi­nees and hinted that he may try to change Senate rules to thwart their delaying taetics. 
"One way or another, the filibuster of judicial nomi­nees must end," Frist, H­Tenn., said in a speech to the Federalist Society, a conser­vative legal group. 
The Democrats' ability to stall White House picks for the federal bench was one of the most contentious issues of Bush's first term. Despite the GOP majority in the Senate, Democrats used the threat of a filibuster to block 10 of Bush's nominees to federal appeals courts. The Senate did confirm more than 200 of the president's choices. 
Hepublicans hope their gain of four seats on Election Day will discourage Democrats from using fili­busters again. But in a Senate next year with 55 Hepublicans, 44 Democrats and a Democrat-leaning independent, Democrats still will have the 40 votes neces­sary to uphold a filibuster. 
Frist said filibustering judi­cial nominees is "radical. It is dangerous and it must be overcome. The Senate must be allowed to confirm judges who fairly, justly and inde­pendently interpret the law." 
"The Senate cannot allow 

the filibuster of circuit court nominees to continue." Frist said. "Nor can we allow the filibuster to extend to poten­tial Supreme Court nomi­nees."

"The Senate now faces a choice: Either we accept a new and destructive practice or we act to restore constitu­tional balance," he said. 
To block some of Bush's nominees, Democrats have used procedures that required Hepublicans to come up with 60 votes to advance the president's choices. It takes 60 votes in the 100-member Senate to break a filibuster, meaning some Democrats would have to

Board rejects $9.2 billion takeover 
SAN FRANCISCO -PeopleSoft Inc.'s board of directors rejected Oracle Corp.'s $9.2 billion takeover bid Wednesday and vowed to contin­ue its staunch resistance even if a majority of the business software maker's shareholders decide to accept the ofl'er. 
After more than a week of deliberation, PeopleSoft's board unanimously concluded Oracle latest $24-per-share bid is inadequate. It marked the fifth time the Pleasanton-based company has snubbed its bitter rival since the takeover battle began more than 17 months ago. 
"We absolutely believe PeopleSoft is worth far more today than at any point since this process began," said George "Skip" Battle, the lead director on PeopleSoft's transaction com­mittee. 
Many analysts disagree, saying PeopleSoft's market value has been propped up by Oracle's takeover bid. If Oracle withdraws its bid, some analysts fear PeopleSoft's stock will plunge by more than 30 percent. 
PeopleSoft's shareholders theoretically could override the board's recommendation by offer­ing their shares to Oracle by a Nov. 19 dead­line. 
Should a shareholder majority side with Oracle, Battle and other board members said the directors still intend to use whatever measures necessary to force the issue to a final vote at PeopleSoft's annual meeting next spring.

Blockbuster offers to buy rival 
Biggest retailer. in movie-rental industry wants Hollywood Video for $700 million 
Associated Press 

DALLAS -Blockbuster Inc., facing new attacks from big retailers and online operators, has offered $700 million for rival Hollywood Entertain­ment Corp. in a bid to com­bine the two biggest players in the movie-rental indus­try. 
Blockbuster, the biggest in movie rentals, said Thursday that it had com­municated its interest to No. 2 Hollywood Entertainment but that there have been no substantive talks on terms of a deal. 
Hollywood Entertainment is already in a deal to let its chairman and chief execu­tive and a buyout firm take the company private. The agreement, however, allowed Hollywood to solicit other bids, and the CEO said he welcomed Blockbuster's offer. 
The deal would give Blockbuster, which already has 9,000 outlets world­wide, more than 1,920 Hollywood Video stores and 600 Game Crazy specialty stores. But it could also raise antitrust questions.

Senior Kendall Krische said she has never had any problems with cab drivers, but will now be more cautious when using cabs for transportation. 
"I usually take a cab somewhere at least once a week," Krische said. :.I guess from now on, if I have to go anywhere, I'll try to go with a lot of people." 
And while others agree with Krische, some students said they wouldn't be afraid to take a cab in the future.

"Yes, I'd feel uncomfortable, but I would still take a cab if I needed one," she said. "I don't think this should deter people from taking a taxi, espedally when they're doing it for safety masons like getting transportation to and from bars."

JAPAN 
Officials try to identify n1ystery subn1arine 
Associated Press 
TOKYO -Japan's military on Thursday shadowed an unidentified submarine that entered its territorial waters the day before, but officials said they had not yet figured out which country the intruder was from. 
Tokyo put its navy on alert Wednesday after spotting the submarine off the southern island of Okinawa and sent a reconnaissance plane and destroyer to follow its move­ments. 
The submarine, which spent two hours in Japanese waters before leaving, was heading north Thursday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Iliroyuki Ilosoda said: 
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said the govern­ment was trying to confirm the vessel's identify, but he added that sometimes it helped to be vague. 
"There are security issues involved. Sometimes it is better to not say things very clearly," Koizumi said. 
Asked if Japan's navy was having trouble identifying the vessel, Koizumi said: "No. It's good to have advanced abilities, but sometimes it's better not to know how advanced those abilities are." 
He added Japan would take "appropriate action" when it confirmed the 1fiYS­tery sub's identity. 
Hosoda refused to confirm media reports that defense officials believe the vessel is from China, saying: "We don't have enough conclu­sive evidence to make a determination." 
He said it would take time to identify the submarine because it had not yet sur­faced and did not appear to be heading toward a specific country. Hosoda said Tokyo has not confronted any countries about the incident. 
Japanese public broadcast­er NHK said defense officials suspected it was a Chinese Han-class nuclear subma­rine, based on an analysis of the sounds it was making. 
In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said she did not know if the vessel was Chinese. 
"The Chinese side is now paying close attention to this issue and I do not approve or encourage any random suppositions on this ques­tion," Zhang told reporters at a regular briefing. "As to whether this is a Chinese submarine, I do not know and I cannot provide you any information on this." 

MEXICO 
City residents debate art exhibit 
Shack perceived as too similar to real poverty 
Associated Press 
MEXICO CITY -A squatter "shack" that bulges like a tumor off the outside wall of a Mexico City museum is an experiment in living -or an eyesore, a waste of money, an affront to the country's millions of real squatters, depending on whom you ask. 
Whatever it is, Hector Zamora's work of art is hard to ignore. It crawls down the side of the Carrillo Gil art museum about 30 feet above street level, reachable from the sidewalk only by a rickety wooden stair­way. 
Zamora, 29, says the red cocoon-like shack is a three­month experiment in living in a public space, a technical explo­ration of lightweight buildings and an opportunity to "spark a discussion." 
"People have left me angry notes in my mailbox saying, 'I hope someday you live in real poverty,' and 'Now I know where the arts budget is going,"' said Zamora, a design­er who builds canopies and pavilions. 
Residents of San Angel, the colonial-era suburb of man­sions around the museum, hated it so much they forced Zamora to do what nornial squatters don't do -battle for months to get construction per­mits. 
It's not just the insults. Passers-by have barged unin­vited into the red, tarpaper shack. One real squatter stopped by and offered tips for imi?rovement. 
Zamora says his wood­floored dwellingplace -a par­abolic steel frame supported by cables strung from the muse­um's roof-mimics the precar­iousness and lack of privacy that real squatters suffer. 
He often has to sleep with earplugs as trucks roar by out­side his plastic-sheeted win­dows. The conclusions from the experiment? "This is a livable space," he says, but he gets out on Nov. 28 and is quick to add that when he builds his dream house, "it will not be in the city." 
Zamora says the work, titled "Revolucion 1608, bis," is meant to reflect the inventive­ness of real squatters, who often build shacks in swamps or 45-degree hillsides. He is proud of the lightweight, inex­pensive materials like corrugat­ed cardboard insulation, and

Some, however, think Zamora didn't go far enough. 
"It's a magnificent effort, but I don't think it's provocative enough," said Graciela Schmilchuk, a contemporary arts researcher for Mexico's National Fine Arts Institute. "Perhaps it would have been more effective if he had invad­ed part of the sidewalk, or the street." 
That's what real squatters often do -turn parks, nature reserves and vacant lots into shanty towns. The city's main bike trail is blocked at three points by squatters' camps.

dents since 1980, reality would have set in. It has not. 
Dissident Poetry 
When former President Clinton entered office, eight of nine Swpreme Court justices were Republican appointees, but Roe was still the law of the land. What a high-stakes wager it was this year, reelecting a president responsible for the largest budget deficit in history and a fiasco in the Middle East. Pro-life Republicans bet the house. I wager they lost. 
A recent study indicates President George W. Bush's first term brought an increase in abortions. Economic problems arid rising health costs ren­der it likely we can expect the same in years to come. Meanwhile, abor­tions dropped by nearly 200,000 annually under Clinton. Such statis­tics make little difference to those who prefer ineffective absolutist moral posturing to actual change. One can be so tied to a cause he forgets the effect. 
I took a somewhat perverse pleas­ure in the firestorm that resulted when Sen. Arlen Spector, the likely new Republican Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, warned Bush of the obstacles a court nominee who might overturn Roe would face in the Senate. Religious conservatives, aware of the major role they played in reelecting Bush, were up in arms. Some declared Spector unfit for the post. 
This controversy between a socially moderate Northeasterner and the religious right reveals a growing ten­sion in the GOP. The famously-unified Hepublicans might soon develop the kind of in-fighting Democrats have made famous. 

For the past few decades, Republicans have succeeded by bran­dishing a clear vision while Democrats remain mired in what strategist James Carville calls "lita­nies, not a narrative." The Republican vision in this election was of tax cuts, privatization and a more bellicose international presence. Democrats failed to ade­quately convey an alter­native. To paraphrase "The Big Lebowski:" "say what you will about the tenets of the Republican Party, as least it has an ethos." This ethos is, however, undergoing a perhaps divisive transforma­tion. 
Bush (really Karl Rove) has recast the Republican Party, much as Clinton shifted the New Democra..tp to the center. Bush moved to the right, the reli­gious right in particu­lar. He has abandoned traditional Republican posi­tions -fiscal responsibility, gov­ernment accountability, concern for the middle class and a reliable, cau­tious foreign policy. The assertion that he is the heir apparent to President Reagan did not convince the many conservative individuals and publications that chose not to support his reelection or endorsed Sen. John Kerry. They saw an administration that is soci<dly conservative and eco­nomically indecipherable, and whose neo-conservative foreign ·policy has hindered America's ability to lead on the global stage. ·The American con­servative denounced the influence of the Christian Right on foreign policy and their unqualified support for Israel. Interestingly, Evangelical 
Christian leader Pat Robertson's major cri­tiques of Bush have centered on the presi­dent's support for the road map for peace in the Middle East, which "could put the United 
States at cross-pur­poses with 
God." 
Robertson, along with Jerry Falwell and James Dobson, 
represent an element of the 
Republican Party that has received much 

attention since the election. On the other end of the spectrum are the key speakers during the recent Republican Convention: Governors Mitt 
Romney (Massachusetts).. Arnold Schwarzenegger (California) and George Pataki (New York), as weP as current and former New York City Mayors Michael Bloomberg and Rudolph Giuliani. Some of these men ate potential 2008 presidential candi­dates. All are pro-choice and socially moderate to liberal. Their major roles in the convention compelled more than half the Republicans in the House to send a formal letter of com­plaint to Bush in July. They ques­tioned why pro-life speakers were not given a more public role during the convention. Makes you wonder, does­n't it? 
The most prominent pro-life speak­er was a Democrat (at least in theo­ry), Zell Miller of Georgia. Sen. John McCain, another speaker, is also pro­life, but for many the renegade seH'a­tor has always appeared more fiscally than socially conservative. He faced strong opposition from religious con­servatives during the 2000 primaries. What to make of a party with a pro­life platform headlining its most prominent pro-choice politicians? Perhaps one should question their commitment to the cause. One must admit the Republicans are at least more receptive than Democrats to the minority view in their party on abor­tion. Fortunately, pro-life Democrats, often ostracized, might find some hope in their new Senate minority leader, pro-lifer Harry Reid of Nevada. 
Republican supporters like the Center for Reclaiming America (for Christ) would likely actively oppose Giuliani or Pataki should they seek the 2008 nomination. A fault line might develop over the next decade or two between the religious right and the "Traditional Conservative" (main­ly Northeastern) wing of the party. This is good, not for Democrats, they still need to get their act together, but for our political process. Who thought a viable third party might come from the right? Unfortunately, unless he makes a few changes, Ralph Nader is not likely to receive their nomination.

communities and an increased availability of healthcare for all Americans. In the wake of President George W. Bush's clear vic­tory I, like many Democrats, have trouble seeing a definitive path towards my hopes for this nation. 
However, there is a bold and clear move the Democratic Party must make sooner rather than later -move the party's platform from a pro-choice to a pro-life stance on abortion. 
It is politically impossible to take a middle of the road position on abortion. The Democratic Party should cre­ate a platform opposing abortion except in cases of rape, incest and the mother's health. The Democratic Party should continue to welcome pro-choice members but insist on pro-life leadership. Roe v. Wade is now destined to be overturned, leaving abortion up to the states. At that point, if the Democrats are still the "abor­tion party," Republicans will sweep to power in at least 30 state legislatures and governor's offices in order to outlaw abortion at the state level. Sen. John Kerry was not the only loser. On Nov. 2, the pro-life movement struck a fatal blow to the pro-choice position. The sooner the Demoeratic Party realizes this, the better. 

Abortion is a unique issue which is not central to the basic principles of the Democratic Party. Contrary to the opinion of many, abortion is not a critieal component in the ongoing fight for I remember one time discussing politics with a friend, I noticed 
her views were very decidedly left of center. However, when I asked her for whom she was going to vote she instantly , replied, "George Bush" and then, automatically acknowledg­
ing the inconsistency in her position said, "Bryan, I just can't vote for someone who won't end abortion." People 
like the ones from my hometown are the lower-middle class~ economically progressive voters who provided Bush with a wide margin of victory in rural areas due to 
Bush's pro-life stance. Although I firmly believe single­issue voting threatens our democracy by allowing a small part of the electorate to decide policy, there is no feasible way to end the practice. 
I realize distancing ourselves from the pro-choice position will not instantly create droves of converts to the Democratic Party. However, by supporting the pro­
life movement we will open the minds of millions of Americans to the Democratic arguments on various issues. I look forward to the debate about Democratic 
principles, we are the party of civil rights, economic and 

educational opportunity for all and, albeit cliche, we are indeed the party of hope. I believe we can win a debate in this country about core Democratic values. Let it be known to all who wish to look to the future that while the pro-choice

hen you look at Moses Pendleton's work, you wouldn't think it all started showing dairy cows at the Celdonian County Fair. 
The internationally famous choreographer has come a long way from his family farm in northern Vermont. Since he first started touring with danen company Pilobolus after graduating with a degree in English from Dartmouth College, Pendleton's work has benn featured all over the world, from Paris to Munich to New York. He has created choreography for ballets, operas and music videos among other projects. 
Dance enthusiasts have another rare opportunity following on the heels of "Swan Lake" performed by the renowned Moscow Ballet at the Morris Performing Arts Center on Thursday night. On Saturday MOMIX, Pendleton's famous danee company, will take the same stage with a performance that is unlike anything else in the world of dance. 
The performance was arranged by tlw staff' at thn i>PBartolo Center for tlw Performing Arts. University-spon­son~d diseounts havP lowered student tit·kd priens to $7, f'ar below what would normally be eharged f'or a MOMIX pnrf'ormancn.

dancing, but does not stop there. The group uses hammoeks, trapezes, poles and other indescribable props to nxpand the possibilities of dance. Incorporated elements of gymnastics make the group one of the most ath­lntic in the business. The inventrve and technically excellent dance troupe has earned the praise of professional dancers and amateur fans alike. 
"Opus Cactus," the group's newest touring performance, was inspired by the great saguaro cactus of the American southwest. The choreogra­phy is based on the unique 11ora and 
fauna of the desert. Dances pieces reflect tumbleweeds, lizards, rat­tlesnakes and desert blooms. 
MOMIX was created in 1981, a year after Pendleton choreographed the closing ceremonies for the 1980 Winter Olympics. The group is named after Pendleton's solo piece "Momix" which he also performed for the games. 
Ovnr the past 2.0 years the group has performed in more than 20 countries. The group's more famous performanc­es inelude "Bad Habits," a show creat­ed to celebrate the opening of the San Franeisco Giants' new training park in 1992, and a performance featured in the 3-D IMAX l'ilm "Imagine."

Keenan's Laumann leads team with' his experience'' 

By TOM STILES Sports Wri rer 

Keenan's sophomore quar­terback Eric Laumann is not your average football player. 
Laumann will be playing in the biggest game of the inter­hall season on the biggest stage Sunday when his Keenan Knights take on the Jugger" knotts from Knott. 
The pressure and excitement surrounding this game is unlike any other considering famHies of players will be fly­ing in to see the championship, including Laumann's. 
With friends and foes attend­ing the game, they will almost certainly make up the largest crowd either team has played in front of all year. 
Although anxiety will be an issue for most of the players, Laumann is not "most play­ers." He has been playing foot­ball since the fifth grade up to his senior year at Kettering Alter High School in Dayton, Ohio. After becoming the· start­ing quarterback his sophomore year, he took his team all the way to the state semifinals both his junior and senior year. 
"We played in front of about 15,000 people, which is one of the largest crowds for a high school game in Ohio's history. So, I really don't get nervous," Laumann said. "Before games I take it easy and let the defense get pumped up. I just get in my own frame of mind and try to stay focused." 
Laumann has remained one of the most versatile players in interhall based upon statistics alone. 
Laumann has already had three games in which he has 
thrown and rushed for over 200 yards this season. This is in addition to throwing and rushing for at least three touchdowns in each of the con­tests. 
"We like to run a balanced offense, and Eric is a huge part of it because he is versatile enough to execute on running plays designed for him and he can really tuck it and run on the broken ones," Keenan cap­tain Patrick Downey said. "As any good quarterback, you have to have leadership quali­ties, and Eric does. He just has that knack for making big plays, especially on third downs. We are very confident when the ball is in his hands." 
Laumann attributes this con­fidence to his many years of experience. 
"I think the biggest thing that I bring to the offense is experience. I can read routes well, and I'm better at pro­gressions than most quarter­backs in this league," Laumann said. ''I'm athletic enough to be able to make something happen if people bust through the line. Plus, I have a great receiver to throw to in Dan Zenker." 
In addition to the Keenan receivers, its defonse has been a dominant presence all sea­son long. 
The Knights defense has recorded three shutouts and hasn't allowed an opponent to score more than seven points all season. 
"The key for a win on Sunday will be the line. It all starts with the offensive line," Laumann said. "Then the run­ning game will open up the passing game." 
A successful passing game 
and making few mistakes is a pressure Laumann places upon himself. 
"For me, the big thing is no turnovers and just making the plays that are called. We are good enough where I don't have to be spectacular," Laumann said. "I know they have a good running back, but our defense hasn't given up a touchdown in the playoffs. It'll be a hard fought game." 
Despite being confident in the team's abilities, Laumann knows what is at stake. lie also knows what a great achievement it is to get all the way to the Stadium. Last sea­son, the Knights reached the semifinals, only to lose to Dillon 13-6. Laumann and the rest of the players from last year's team haven't forgotten how close they came to reach­ing the Stadium. This time around though, Keenan looks to relish the experience. 
"Last year was a giant tease," Laumann said. "We were so close and we got a taste. But the loss fueled the lire, so we really got to work early this year." 
Laumann is also hoping last year's mistakes will help the team to be successful on Sunday. 
"I would like to treat this like any other game, but I know the feeling of being on that field will be unbelievable," Laumann said. "But we as a team want to be remembered by everyone there watching. My whole family is coming, so I really hope it will be an expe­rience that they will remember as well."

WOMEN'S INTERHALL FOOTBALL 
Chaos and Wild Women set to face off in final 
. By BRAD WALLACE Sports Writer 
Before the leaves changed 
and one could still go outside 
without a parka, Cavanaugh 
and Walsh met in the first 
game of the 2004 interhall sea­
son. They played to a 0-0 tie. 
Eight weeks later and 30 
degrees cooler, the Wild 
Women will butt heads with 
the Chaos once more, but this 
time, there will be no tie. 
The scenery will likely be the 
biggest change Sunday when 
the teams make their way to 
the Stadium for the 12 p.m. 
game; it will be a battle of pro­
lific offenses and smothering 
defenses as this season's best 
will put it all out there in hopes 
of being the 2004 women's 
interhall football champion. 
After winning close semifinal games, neither team will need much pumping up before Sunday. For senior-Walsh cap­tain Carrie Campbell, the idea of playing in the Stadium is more than enough to get her juices flowing. 
"Our last game against Welsh 
Family was really exciting, and 
it definitely got us pumped up 
for the championship," she 
said. "This is our first time in 
the Stadium -we got beat in 
the semis my freshman and 
sophomore years, so we're 
really excited to get the chance 
to play in there." 
Feeling the same rush after 
defeating Pangborn in her 
semifinal game, Cavanaugh 
Caf!taftl'\,Smlft..r6iUoon is, r-eady 
for Sunday's game but is going 
into it looking for one thing. 
"We had a really tough game 
against Pangborn, and the win 
really gave us a lot of momen­tum," Gilloon said. "We were in the Stadium two years ago and got beat by PE, so the juniors and seniors on the team know what this game is all about. Getting there isn't enough for us this time. We're better pre­pared than we were then, and we're here to win." 
But Gilloon and the Chaus know how difficult that goal will be to realize, as it was the Wild Women who handed them the only blemish on a near­perfect record. 
"I think the tie can be attrib­uted to their tough defense, but at the same time, our offense wasn't up and running the way it is now," she explained. 
Campbell agrees the first game was well-fought on both sides, but feels Walsh has made a lot of progress since then. 
"We felt like we morally won the first game. Cavanaugh was ranked first, and we did a good job of shutting them down," Campbell said. "I think both teams have improved a lot since the beginning of the sea­son. I know we feel a lot more confident, and our offense has really begun to click in the sec­ond half of the season." 
Over the last eight weeks, both Walsh and Cavanaugh have developed what they con­sider strengths, but both are extremely well-rounded teams exhibiting impressive skills on both sides of the ball. 
"As far as our play goes, defense has been our greatest strength,'!. Campbell sai~ "Qur corners have been solid, and we've held all of our opponents to few or no points. We've also got a very athletic offense that makes big plays." 


Walsh quarterback Mary Sullivan feels that her team's biggest asset comes off the field. 
"One of our biggest strengths is our unity," Sullivan said. "It doesn't matter who is on the field. When we play, it's always about the team." 
The indiscriminate talent of the Wild Women will be evenly matched Sunday by the far­reaching abilities of the women of Cavanaugh. 
"We've got a really strong offense that makes big plays," Gilloon said. "We've got a lot of great receivers, and our quar­terback, Lisa Ruffer, is getting more accurate every week. Our defense has also come up with several interceptions at crucial times, and they've made a lot of key stops." 
Each team is aware of the other's strengths and will go to ·great lengths to make sure that it comes out on the winning end. 
"Cavanaugh is a great team. They have a very talented offense, and their quarterback is very athletic," Sullivan said. "But I have a lot more confi­dence in our defense than I have in her, and I know they can shut her down." 
As Walsh and Cavanaugh are so evenly matched, it is likely this game will come down to who wants it more. 
"It's going to take the combi­nation of momentum and play­ing our hearts out to win this game, but I know we're going to do it," Gilloon said.. 
Sullivan feels representing her dorm will add the neces­sary motivation to take the Wild Women to the top. 
"We just want to take advan­tage of the opportunity and bring a little glory back to Walsh Hall," Sullivan said.

MOVIE REVIEW 
'The Grudge' is standard but scary 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN Assistant Scene Editor 
Haunted house movies are a staple of 
the horror genre, and "The Grudge" 
proves to be an interesting and decent­
ly scary addition 
to this elassic vein 
of films. The pic­
ture is a remake of 
a Japanese l'ilm, 
"Ju-on: The 
Grudge," and 
whiln it isn't 
extrmnnly original, 
it dons provide a 
good number of 
scares and main­
tains an aura of 
suspense for a 
good part of the 
movie. Thn movie fol­lows a non-linear plot structure, so it jumps back and forth bntween var­ious characters and timelines. It focuses primarily on Karen Davis (Sarah MicheHe Gellar), a young exchange student who moves to Japan in order to be with her boyfriend, Doug (Jason Behr). Shn works for a nursing care center, 
and she is called to a house after the priJ!tary oaregiver mysteriously disap­pears while she is working. Karen slowly begins to discover the eerie hauntings of the house, as well as the reasons behind why they exist. She quickly l'inds that death awaits all those who enter the house, and that the agel)ts of the curse will track down 
all those who have stepped foot within its doors regard­less of where they are. 
Through the use of flashbacks, cut­backs and some other narrative devices, the film manages to pro­vide scares and a story without giv­ing away too much too soon. The fact that it is based on a Japanese film is evident in how the story is told, as well as how it is resolved, and in this way it .does offer a slightly dif­ferent perspective on what constitutes a scary movie. 
The film's use of 
sound is perhaps the most effective means of creating suspense and startling the audience. The creak of doors, the swell of music, the howl of a cat and especially the eerie, guttural creaking noise that pre-

cedes most of the attacks all help to create an overall mood of antiCipation and terror. Watching the film with the mute button on would seriously detract from the overall experience, and it would definitely make many of the piv­otal moments much less frightening. 
The house in the movie is another major source of scares, and it actually ends up being one of the most important 'characters' in the film. The claustro­phobic atmosphere created by the Japanese home immediately cre­ates a sense of tension before any major aetion has taken place, and the eamera makes use of the cramped quarters to great effect. 

As the film pro­gresses, the doors begin to open on their own, myste­rious shadows appear in mirrors and windows, and a sinister sensation is evoked whenever a character merely enters a room.

more than enter the building. The film doesn't exactly revolutionize the horror movie genre, but it does uti­lize manyof the major tropes of classic movies, such as hands popping out of dark corners and grabbing someone, to 
create a good scary atmosphere. Although the movie does rely heavily on the "Don't go in there" moments that are frequent in scary movies, a few of which will really have you wondering about the character's IQ, it does manage to usually make you ignore implausibil­ity with some kind of shock or scare. 
Like so many other horror movies, it "leaves the door wide open for a sequel, and with four films in the Japanese "Grudge" series and a number one box office opening for the film in the

Dissenters: Joe must go 
Is Paterno's time running out as coach at Penn State? 
Associated Press 
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -The 
coaching legaey and goodwill 
that Joe Paterno proudly built 
for live decades at Penn State 
an1 slowly unraveling with each 
humbling loss. 
The days of scanning the 
schedule for gimme victories 
are over-just ask Big Ten 
foes Purdue and Northwestern, 
which this season got their first 
wins in Happy Valley. 
Paterno hardly needs his thick, smoky glasses to see he's losing more than games: Thtlusands of seats at Beaver Stadium have been empty at recent home games, and Paterno is no longer impervious to the criticisms routinely reserved for coaches with less­er pedigrees or without mputa­tions as community patridans. 
The message is dear -and getting louder -from the grumbling dissenters: Joe must go. 
Paterno, whose 341-116-3 record puts him second in earner victories in Division 1-A behind only Florida State's Bobby Bowden, is listening. .Just dof!'t expnct him to deeide his future basnd on the whims of lickle fans. 
"If' you think that I am going to back out of it because I am intimidated, you are wrong. If' you think I am going to stay when I think I am not doing a good job, you're wrong," he said. "Those things have to develop, they havp, to evolve. Hight now, I think we can get this thing done and do a good job." 
The numbers give little rea­son for hope. 
The Nittany Lions (2-7, 0-6) are the only Big 10 team with­out a conference victory enter­ing Saturday's game at Indiana. They havn lost six consecutive games, ineluding a school­record tying three straight at home. 
Penn Statn has four losing seasons in the last five years and the senior class will leave having played in only one bowl game. When asked about his f'uturn, the 77 -year-old Paterno often turns cantankerous, using his 55 years on the staff as a sensn of entitlement to dismiss his critics. 
llis dntnrrnination (or stub-bornness'?), his unyielding belief (or hope?), and his four­year contract that will keep him on the school's payroll past his 80th birthday give little rea­son to expect anyone but the coaeh affectionately known as JoePa will be on the sideline next year. 


"I am looking to get this pro­gram back to where it belongs and if I can't get it done in a certain amount of time, I have to sit baek and say, 'IIey, turn it over to some other guy and ean I help'?' That is the way it will be," he said. 
And that time is'? 

"I haven't got the slightest idea," he said. "I don't see any reason to say, Tm going to get out of here this year, next year or what year.~ I don't mean that to be coeky, stubborn or any­thing like that. I am just trying to do what is right." 
What to do with the fading legend seems to be tearing at the conscience of the Penn State community. Has Paterno, who's donated millions to the school in addition to his football success, earned the right to decide his own fate'? Or should university officials give him a nudge out the door? 
"I think he'll never step down," said f!>rmer Penn State defensive end Miehael Haynes, now with the Chicago Bears. "Right now we're having some issues, but it's still all fixable." 
A bronze statue of Paterno greets visitors to Beaver Stadium. There he is, looking spry, pointing toward the sky with his jacket flown open and tie whipped around as if hit with the wind of another brisk football Saturday. 
Engraved near a wall of plaques to the left of the statue is a Paterno quote: "They asked me what I'd like written about me when I'm gone. I hope they write I've made Penn State a better place, not just that I was a good football coach." 
Those stories will eertainly be written one day. But JoePa most certainly ean 't like what's being written now. 
One alumnus paid $350 to take out a half-page ad in the student newspaper's gameday edition which read: "The tal­ent's there. The coaching is an abomination. TIME FOH JOE TOGO." 
"All I was trying to do was focus some of the dissent I'm hearing all over the place in a way people can see it and read it readily," said Joseph Korsak, who said he's been to every home game since 196 7 except for a three-year stint in Ohio. "A few have said it was too harsh, but the vast majority think it's time for a ehange. A lot of people have been more forgiving and say he should go out on his own terms. Whatever goodwill he's gener­ated ran out at the end of the '02 season."

NEW YORK -As joyous fans celebrated by honking car horns in Caracas, Johan Santana sounded overwhelmed. He became the first Venezuelan to win a Cy Young Award, and not only that, he was a unani­mous choice. 
"This is like a dream come true," he said after earning the American League honor Thursday. ''I'm a little surprised that I ended up the season where I ended up the sea­son." 
The Minnesota Twins' left-bander received all 28 first-place votes in ballot­

Santana, who went 20-6 and led the AL with a 2.61 ERA and 265 strikeouts, became the first unani­mous Cy Young winner since Arizona's Randy Johnson two years ago and the first in the AL since Boston's Pedro Martinez in 2000. He is the 18th unan­imous winner overall, the seventh in the AL. 
Curt Schilling, 21-6 with a 3.26 ERA in his first sea­son with the Red Sox, received 27 second-place votes and one third for 82 points. Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees, 
IN BRIEF 

Arizona State set to honor 
Tillman Saturday 
TEMPE, Ariz. -Pat Tillman used to climb the light towers over Sun Devil Stadium to meditate. He was a fierce Arizona State football player and an honor student who graduated in 3 1/2 years. 
The school will honor the fallen hero, killed in combat in Afghanistan last April, and retire his No. 42 in a halftime ceremony of Saturday night's game against Washington State. 
Jake Plummer is scheduled to be among the former teammates who gather on the field for the ceremony, the second one at the stadium this season. 
The Arizona Cardinals retired Tillman's number at their home opener on Sept. 19. 
Tillman was the Pac-10 defensive player of the year as a senior in 1997, when he and Plummer led the Sun Devils to an 11-0 regular season and the Rose Bowl. Tillman, an academic who led the major leagues with a career-high 53 saves, received the other second-place vote and 24 thirds for 27 points. 
''I'm surprised this has been a unanimous deci­sion," Santana said. "I thought this was going to be a real tough race." 
Santana traveled Thursday morning from his hometown of Tovar Merida to Caracas. President Hugo Chavez planned to congratulate him Friday. 
"It's on national TV," Santana said. "Hopefully, in a couple of hours I'll be addressing the country and letting them know how

They go to dinner together and hang out at each other's houses. Their wives talk constantly on the phone. 
On Saturday night, they'll fight for the IBF heavyweight title. For a few rounds, at least, friendships will have to be put aside. 
"We tried to avoid this for a long time," Byrd said. "But McCline is the mandatory for me. I had no other choice."

Irish face conference challengers Pitt and WVU 

By MIKE GILLOON Sports Writer 
Their hopes of an undefeated conference season were swept away by Boston College last week. Notre Dame (14-7, 7-1 in the Big East) now looks to regroup with home matches_ today and Sunday against Pittsburgh and West Virginia. 
With Pittsburgh (19-6, 7-1), Notre Dame and Syracuse all tied atop the Big East stand­ings, these matches should help breakup the conference. 
"We were down after [the loss to Boston College]," Notre Dame coach Debbie Brown said. "But we're eager to play again. The team is determined to get a win." 
Today's match against Pittsburgh will begin at 4 p.m. in the Joyce Center. With the football pep rally set for 6 p.m. Brown expects a lot of Irish fans in attendance.

Despite all the talent Pittsburgh brings to the match, Brown is most concerned with the Irish executing and playing a complete match. 
"We have to be smart in how we're trying to defend them and things like that," Brown said. "But I do think the bulk of it is taking care of our side of the net." 
Sunday's match against West Virginia will begin at 2 p.m. in the Joyce Center. 
The Mountaineers are 18-11 overall and 4-4 iri the Big East. Despite not being particularly strong offensively, they make up for it with a stout defense that ranks second in the con­ference ·by limiting opponents to a .157 hitting percentage and leads the league in digs per game with 18.35. Senior Alison Zemanski is the main reason for the success as the middle blocker leads the Big East in blocks per game with 1. 50. Outside hitter Aurora Ebert­Santos is averaging 4.64 digs per game, third in the league.

ladies this year will be fresh­man Megan Gray, along with sophomores Allison Beyer, Meaghan Herbst, Meghan Murphy and Ashley Oberst. Hisa Zander will be the lone senior competing for the Belles. 
The 2004 season hasn't exactly been an easy road for the team. After an injury hurt the team's position in the MIAA Jamboree, Saint Mary's was put in a difficult position for the conference champi­onship. The fourth-place spot that the Belles had hoped for eluded the team as more ail­ments and injuries prevented a few of the top runners from achieving their highest per­formance at the meet. Since the Saint Mary's Cross Country team has primarily b~en focused on improving its conference standings -the Belles finished in sixth-place -the regional race is not a principal concern for the team. Coach Dave Barstis has said in the past that the regional meet is mainly a cool down for the training that the team does for the critical con­ference competition. 
For the majority of the team, Saturday will be one last opportunity to improve as a group and look ahead to prepare for next year. Zander, who will wear her Saint Mary's uniform for the final time, looks at her last race as an opportunity to have a strong finish to a memorable experience with the team.

Irish increase intensity for crucial dual meet

several players throughout the preseason, although just 
returning  starter  J aci  
McCormick  will miss to night's  
contest.  

The Redbirds had their first winning season in seven years during the 2003-04 campaign. They return three starters from last season's squad as coach Robin Pingeton tries to rebuild a program that has struggled in recent years. 
Meanwhile, Notre Dame hopes to begin its season bet­ter than a year ago, when the Irish were just 7-6 in their first 13 games before finishing the season at 21-11 with a Sweet 16 berth. 
"It's critical for us to get off to a good start," McGraw said. "We played a lot of tough teams on the road [last year]. Obviously it was tough, this year I think we have a few more home games, so hopeful­ly that will prepare us a little bit more." 
McGraw knows her team should have an easier time getting into the flow of the 
game at the Joyce Center-a place Notre Dame didn't lose at last season. 
"We have great fans," McGraw said. "We love our fans because they're so into the game and they're so knowl­edgeable about the game. They just seem to have a sense of when we need them~" 
The Irish will start the same five players as they have dur­ing their two exhibition game victories -Megan Duffy and Breona Gray at the guards, Jacqueline Batteast and Courtney LaVere at forwards and Teresa Borton at center. 
Batteast has already received all kinds of national acclaim and preseason awards. The returning all-American aver­aged 16 points and 8.6 rebounds per game last sea­son. She will be a leading can­didate for Big East Player of the Year and is being men­tioned by many as the best all­around player in the country. 
McGraw doesn't downplay Batteast's abilities, but is emphasizing other scoring options from her team. 
"[Batteast is] probably going to see a lot of double teams," McGraw said. "We're just expecting her to play like she did last year, same kind of game. We hope to help her more. The rest of our players, I think, need to step up and give her a little more help." 

Notre Dame will not only rely on Batteast and the other returning players, but also on 
. a talented and athletic fresh­man class. Guard Tulyah Gaines averaged over 20 points a game as a high school senior in Nevada. Fellow guard Charel Allen also had an impressive high school career and averaged 26 points her final season. Center Melissa D'Amico was a New York all­state selection her senior sea­son. All three should see play­ing time early on this season. Whether freshman or senior, Notre Dame's players should be ready for opening night, although McGraw knows with that added anticipation comes more mistakes. "I think the first game you're always a little bit excited and a little bit nervous," McGraw said. "It's certainly not going to be fundamentally the best game we're going to play this year."

The Irish (3-1) are gearing up for what has been dubbed their most crucial dual meet of the season against No. 17 Pittsburgh and Michigan State. 
In anticipation of today's meet, coach Tim Welsh said the swim­mers have intensified their workouts and are looking race­ready. 
"If you ask the guys how prac­tices have been this week, they'll tell you they've been really hard," Welsh said. "We need to outwork people who have beat­en us so we can outrace them." 
Welsh said he expects close races in each event, especially in diving and distance freestyle events -traditionally competi­tive areas for the Irish. 
"These teams are strong where we're strong," Welsh said. "We'll have to be at our best in all events to win. I think we'll see the fastest times of the fall from all three teams." 
Notre Dame showcased its tal­ent last weekend, upending Iowa 176-118. Sophomore Ted Brown led the Irish with victories in the 200-and 500-yard freestyle races, finishing with times of 1 minute, 42.30 seconds and 
4:35.46 respectively. 
The 500-yard freestyle race featured a 1-2-3 finish, with Brown finishing first, junior Patrick Davis following up with a 
4:36.63 and freshman Jay Vanden Berg close behind at 4:37.73. 
Vanden Berg and sophomore Louis Cavadini each collected 
- 
first-place finishes as well, with  
Vanden Berg clocking a 9:27.84  
in the 1,000-yard freestyle and  
Cavadini registering a 46.68 in  
the 100-yard freestyle race.  
Additionally, sophomore Tim  
Kegelman won the 200-yard  
butterfly wHh a 1:52.42 while  
freshman Andrew MacKay fin­ 
ished in first in the 200 individ­ 
ual medley with 1:53.83. The  
200-free relay, which consisted  
of senior Frank Krakowski, jun­ 
ior Tim Randolph, Kegelman  
and Cavadini, added to the list of  
first-place Irish finishes.  
The Irish swept the diving por­ 
tion of the competition, as Iowa  
chose not to enter divers in the  
meet. Sophomore Scott Coyle  
claimed first place in the· 3­ 
meter competition with a career­best score of 321.45 and fresh­ - 
man Sam Stoner won the·1­ 
meter competition with 307.65  
points.  
Michigan State (1-1) is looking  
to build on the momentum it  
gained after last weekend's meet  
against Iowa. The Spartans  
defeated Iowa 164-125, claiming  
victories across the board.  
Pittsburgh (2-0) also c;lBters  
today's meet fresh off a win over  
Syracuse 177-66. The undefeat­ 
ed Panthers garnered 12 first­ 
place fmishes against Syracuse.  
The team is looking for a Big  
East Championship again this  
season, after establishing itself  
as an annual champion in more  
recent years.  
Although the Panthers' repu­ 
tation precedes them, the Irish  
aren't intimidated.  
"This is the strongest team  
we've ever had," captain Matt  
Burtke said. "We might surprise  
some people this weekend."

Welsh agreed. 
"We have to keep out ultimate goals in sight and not get lost along the way," Welsh said. "Swimming against Pitt is moti­vating-not intimidating. 
"Bring ii on. Let's strap on our goggles and see who's fastest." 
The Irish are set to host the meet today at 4:30 p.m. at the Rolfs Aquatic Center.

COACHING 
Willingham and staff found a way to beat another top-1 0 team last week, this time on the road. The offense contin­ues to struggle, but the defense has been as solid as ever. This team has been inconsistent all sea­son, and that could be attributed to coaching. 
Harris has been known for his great receivers in the past. IIe has coached Larry Fitzgerald at Pittsburgh, David Boston at Ohio State and Antonio Bryant at Pitt. Harris has a so-so record at Pitt (49-43). but is highly regarded around college football.-
Willingham has the better career record, and has not lost to Pittsburgh while at Notre Dame. Harris is 1-4 against the Irish, includ· ing last year's loss at home, 20-14. Harris is a solid coach. but Willingham get the edge because of his record against the Panthers. 
QUARTERBACKS 
Quinn struggled against Tennesee, throwing for just 118 yards on 12­for-23 passing. How­ever, he didn't throw an interception. Quinn is still young, but his tal­ent has shone through in a few games. He just needs to find consisten­cy. 
Palko has put up impressive numbers in the past two games, throwing for 660 yards and completing 67 per­cent of his passes in that period. Sure, the oppo­nents were Syracuse and Rutgers, but those are still impressive num­bers. 

IRISH RUSHING 
Last week, the Irish ran the ball eflectively and scored as a result. Walker was solid off the bench, and Grant was effective as usual. The offensive line is corrring into its own toward. The Irish must run the ball for the offense to be effec­tive, and they are starting to sojustthat. 
Pittsburgh gives up 125.6 yards per game on the ground, a solid run defense. However, they have not faced a solid run team just yet, with the likes of Furman and Boston College. The Panthers have held three teams to under 100 yards rushing this season. 
Notre Dame has been able to run the ball enough to win lately. Pittsburgh has a tough run defense, but don't count on them to com· pletely stop the Irish attack. It is Grant's last game at Notre Dam.e Stadium. Look for him to have asolid game. 
IRISH PASSING 
Quinn didn't throw li1r a extraordinary amount of yards, but he got the job done, not turning the ball over. The Irish pass­ing game has been solid for the most part, but it isn't the key to-the offense. When the Irish pass a lot, they usually lose. 
The Panthers give up 256 yards per game in the air. They have been able, however, to create interceptions, picking ofT four passes two weeks ago against Hutgers. The secondary is solid, going up against good wide receivers every day in praetice. 
Quinn and the lr.ish average just over 225 yards per game in the air. They should be able to pick apart the Panther secondary, provided that Quinn makes good dHcisions and the Irish receivers come through . 


This senior class won't Jose on Senior Day.

PANTHERS PASSING SPECIAL TEAMS INTANGIBLES 
Notre Dame's rush defense is the strength of the Irish unit. The Irish gave up just 56 yards on the ground last week against Tennessee and Cedric Houston. The Irish also had nine tack­les for a loss and domi­nated the big Tennessee offensive line.  The Irish secondary con­tinues to struggle. They gave up 269 yards in the air at Tennessee, includ­ing 120 yards to the third-string quarterback Clausen. Missed tackles have plagued this unit all season, and they must play well for the Irish to win.  Fitzpatrick is the best spe­cial teams player for Notre Dame. He averages 42.3 yards per punt, good for 32nd in the country. Last week, with Hoskins out on kick returns, Shelton and Anastasio struggled to fig­ure things out. Holiday con­tinues to be solid as a punt returner.  It's the seniors last game in their home, Notre Dame Stadium. If they don't get excited for this game, some­thing must be wrong. Grant, Holiday, Goolsby, Curry and Budinscak are just a few key seniors on this team.

Molly Huddle captured the 2003 individual title at the Great Lakes Hegional but will sit out this year to rest a sore foot. Despite the critical loss, Connelly feels confident the n~maining squad will perform well.

With a 15th-place finish at last year's regional and sixth place at the Big East, Tim Moore looks to be the top run­ner for the Irish men. Kurt Bnnninger, Kaleb Van Ort, Sean O'Donnell and Vincent Ambrico make up the rest of the team's top live. 
Without Huddle, the Irish women will rely on strong efforts from Lauren King, Stf~phanie Madia and Kerry Meagher. Madia came in lOth place at the Big East behind Huddle.

FENCING 
Irish to face rival Nittany Lions 
Penn State, last year's No. 2, will host tournament 
By MATT PUGLISI Sports Writer 
The Irish look to obtain a first-hand scouting report of a key rival while concurrently testing their own preseason form when they travel to State College, Penn. to participate in the Penn State Max Garret Open Saturday and Sunday morning. 
In the NCAA Championships in March, Penn State (160) edged Notre Dame (153) for second place. Both squads fin­ished behind national champion Ohio State (193). 
"We are going to the place of a big rival [in Penn State]," coach Janusz Bednarski said. "We would like to make a good recognition of their new roster, and additionally, we would like to show them that we are strong. This is a bit of a psycho-· logical trip." 
Like last weekend's World Cup Event that saw five Irish fencers place in the top 10 ­Olympic gold medalist fresh­man Marie! Zagunis took first in women's saber, sophomore Amy Orlando finished eighth in women's epee, freshman Greg Howard placed ninth in men's foil and sophomores Matt 
Stearns and Valerie Providenza 
took tenth in men's and 
women's saber, respectively­
this tournament is also individ­
ual in nature dual meets don't 
begin until the Irish challenge 
New York in late January. 
While the level of competition 
isn't likely to match that of the 
NCAA tournament at the end of 
the season, the Open neverthe­
less figures to boast top-notch 
fencers from around the coun­
try. 
"The tournament is open to 
everybody from the whole nation," Bednarski said. "It's not a team [competition] -it's individual -but individuals are from almost all universities. I believe that it will be very strong, maybe not so high-class . like the NCAA final in March, but it will be very close to that level, especially because Penn State is close to New York and in New York there are a lot of 
good colleges. 
I know people from the West 
are coming because they like 
this competition -this is the 
only competition to check out 
the form after the preseason 
work. So it's like midterm 
exams." 
Although some of the nation's 
top collegiate talent will be on 
display at the Open, one notable 
Notre Dame fencer who will not 
making the trip to Penn State 
this weekend is Zagunis. 
Exhausted from a number of 
international tournaments and 
requiring no additional work, Zagunis will instead take a few days off and be acknowledged for her Olympic achievements this past summer during half­time of the Notre Dame­Pittsburgh game Saturday afternoon. 

"The reason for [Zagunis not competing] is that she's loaded by international starts," Bednarski said. "She's really engaging in too many competi­tions -higher caliber than col­legiate competition, and there is no need to check her form~ We are .giving her more free time, and in addition, she will be honored on the field during the Pittsburgh game as an Olympian." 
Given that the World Cup 
Event marked the first time 
Notre Dame has fenced this 
season, the Irish wiU presum­
ably have some rust to shake 
off this weekend. Bednarski, 
however, isn't concerned. . "We are not yet in full form 
except those fencers who com­
peted in the World Cup -they 
started already, a little bit earli­
er than others," Bednarski said. 
"Always at the beginning of the 
season, we are not in the best 
form, but I think that [other 
fencers] have the same prob­
lem." 
The men take the strips . 
Saturday morning at 8:00 a.m., 
while the women bout at the 
same time Sunday.

Belles look to keep the success coming 
By JUSTIN STETZ 
Spans Writer 
The Belles look to extend their success this weekend at the University of Chicago Maroon InvitationaL Saint Mary's is com­ing off its first victory of the sea­son as it defeated Rose-Hulman by a score of 155-117. 
Last year, the Belles beat the Maroons 124-77. In the meet, Kelly Nelis placed third in the 200-yard freestyle and 500-yard freestyle, while Sarah Nowak fin­ished first in the 1 00-yard breast­stroke. She was also second in the 50-yard freestyle as well as the 100-yard freestyle. 
Bridg~t Lebiedz will look to improve upon her fourth-place finish in the 1 00-yard butterfly. In the 1 00-yard backstroke, Katie Dingman who finished first last year, will be a key swimmer for Saint Mary's once again. Lebiedz and Nelis, the only two players left from the 2003 squad, which won the 200-yard freestyle relay, will aim for another successful finish. 
The University of Chicago is currently 2-1-1 this year over its first four meets. In the second competition of the season, they defeated Rose-Hulman 112-97. If this final score gives any indica­tion to this year's match against the Maroons, Saint Mary's should 
have a pretty good idea where ­they stand following the event. After hitting her head on the ·board in her first dive last meet, 
Megan Medlock came back to 
earn Saint Mary's some valuable 
points in both diving events 
against Rose-l-lulman. 
The first-years have made 
quite an impression so far this 
year. They have meshed very 
well and haven't had too many 
problems adjusting to the college 
level. Coach Gregg Petcoff has 
stressed the importance of the 
freshman swimmers for the con­
tinued success of the Belles. 
"They are essential to Saint 
Mary's chances for victory," 
Petcoff said. 
The swim meet will consist of 
the 100 and 200-yard back­
strokes and breaststrokes, as 
well as the 200-yard freestyle 
and 200-yard butterfly. Three­
meter diving will follow the 1­
meter, and the match will con­
clude with a 400-yard freestyle 
relay. 
The meet begins Saturday at 
10 a.m. at the University of 
Chicago. Following the event, 
Saint Mary's will have more than 
three weeks to rest and improve 
upon their times. They will not 
take the water again until the 
Wisconsin -Oshkosh Invitational

0) in a two-game road series this weekend. 

The Irish have not won a con­-ference game this season. They jumped out to a 3-0 lead against Bowling Green on Nov. 5, only to watch that lead dis­appear and the team barely survive with a 4-4 tie. The four Irish goals in that game were a season-high, as Notre Dame's offense has been anemic to start the season. The team averages just 1.67 goals per g<}me. The Irish are off to their worst start since opening the 1995-96 season with a 1-8-0 reeord. After losing six seniors from last year's class, the team expected to struggle out of the gate, but this kind of start was not what coach Dave Poulin had in mind. Even so, the coach has seen things in recent prac­tice and game situations that excite him. "I think that our offense will improve because we've been having better practices," Poulin said. "Confidence grows in practice, and then transfers usually onto the ice; I think we're really starting to come up with some line com bina­tions, as well. "After losing so many guys, we weren't sure what our lines would be coming into this sea­son, and now five weeks in I think we're starting to see some combinations really develop."

Athletic Department: Jasinski on administrative leave 
Fourth-year head coach led team to up­and-down fall season

"Coach Jasinski is on admin­istrative

Heisler said, declining to make further comment on the issue.

Jasinski

Whitten, and several team players also declined to comment on the situation. 
The news comes just a week after the Irish wrapped up their fall schedule, in which Jasinski piloted them in an up­and-down season. 
During Jasinski's more than three-year tenure, the Irish had already made major steps to becoming a force in the col­legiate golf world. During the 2003-04 season, Jasinski coached the Irish to the Big East Championship and their first NCAA Regional berth since 1966. They where they finished 12th and just missed a chance to compete in the NCAA Finals. 

Jasinski greatly improved the strength of both the Irish schedule as well as its lineup. He recruited strong classes and his incoming freshmen have routinely made an impact on the team. 
Jasinski, who is the fifth head coach in the 75-year his­
tory of the program, has been committed to Notre Dame for the long haul. In June, he signed a contract extension to continue coaching at the University, and he founded the Irish Golf School, where he, along with Whitten, provided teaching sessions to Irish friends, family, alumni and supporters.

Team sets 2005 schedule 
By MATT LOZAR Sports Writer 
For the second consecutive season, the Irish have moved an October road game to Labor Day weekend. 
The Oct. 8, 2005 game between Notre Dame and Pittsburgh was moved to Sept. 3 in a mutual agreement between the schools announced in a press release Thursday. 
The game was rescheduled to ensure the teams would play in a nationally-televised contest on a network to be determined. 
That game also allows the Irish to play before traveling to Ann Arbor, Mich. to take on the Wolverines, who play Eastern Michigan on Sept. 3. 

Notre Dame also announced Thursday the signing of an eight­year contract with Pittsburgh to resume their series in 2008 after a two-year layoff in 2006-07. 
The game in 2008 will be at Notre Dame Stadium with the teams alternating as host of the games until2015.

Numbers don't tell entire story 
Looking at the numbers during the 
past four or five years, Notre Dame's sen­
iors didn't rewrite Fighting Irish history 
by any means. 

They had two losing seasons. 
They went 1-4 
against Boston 
College. 

They never won 
a bowl game. 

 But, sometimes, the numbers lie. What the Notre Dame seniors did­n't get done on the field in terms of wins and losses, they certainly made up for in how they played the game and carried themselves on and off the field. 
Some Irish fans, alumni and outsiders 
will look at this class now -and in years 
to come -as never achieving greatness. 
They never won a national title. They 
never returned Notre Dame to a consis­
tent football powerhouse. 
But those people make a grave over­
sight. This group of seniors has shown an 
uncommonly high degree of character, 
resilience and toughness that anyone 
associated with Notre Dame should be 
proud of-and all qualities head eoach 
Tyrone Willingham preaches and teaches 
to his team each day in practice. 
Derek Curry described the senior class 
best during interviews earlier this week. 
"We have a group of seniors that are 
just phenomenal," Curry said. "Our fifth­
year seniors, I love those guys with 
e'verything because they give it their all, 
week in and wm~k out. summer in and

Dame, you arn playing fbr tim family, you

think that's one thing that's helped 
bneause the guys that arn stepping in for

what they arn playing for."

description is Carlyle lloliday.

QUOTING THE IRISH 
''I'm certainly glad I came to this place and played for this University. I'm happy to have gone here and I don't have any regrets." 
Kyle Budinscak offensive lineman 

But the very next season, Holiday and the offense struggled. As the losses mounted, the criticism rained down on Holiday. Rather than blame the inexperi­enced offensive line that never gave him time to throw, or ch<lstise the ineffective running game that forced him into unde­sirable passing situations, or rant about the inconsistent wide receiver play, Holiday said nothing-and meanwhile, put all the blame on his own shoulders. 
He never complained, never pouted. When students made tasteless T-shirts saying, "The Holiday is Over, Quinn to Win," the quarterback said nothing. Instead, he carried himself as a true champion by doing all he could to help the team, while at the same time sacrific­ing his own personal gain. 
Holiday had played quarterback since he was six, yet he never flinched when asked to change positions last season. When he came back in 2004 as a fifth­year senior, Holiday hoped and expected to play significant minutes. Instead, he's been stuck returning punts and playing sparingly on offense. 
But, through it all, Holiday has never wavered. 
"I think when you look at Carlyle's character and what he has gone through in the tenure that he's been here, through both the ups and the downs ­to go through that and be the man that he has, I think says a great deal for him, and it's helped the program through some tough times," Irish offensive coordi­nator Bill Diedrick said. 
Then there are guys like Jared Clark. 
Another quarterback, Clark asked the eoaches ifhe eould change positions in 2002. A<>suming he would bn on defense, Clark was surprised when the Irish coaching sL:1.fT penciled him in as tight end, a position already full or talented players. 
But Clark did not complain. lie just worked harder, moving up the depth chart to eventually become the team's fifth-leading rnceiver in 2003. 
Then at the beginning of the 2004 sea­son. Clark was pass1~d up by players that had played the tight end position their whole lives. Instead of seeing the field as a fifth-year, Clark now sees the b!'nch. But Clark does his best to hnlp the younger players and keep thn locker room atmosphere light. lie's the guy that makes his teammates laugh, even when times get tough. 
"lie did a lot fi11· me. especially early in 
"7b go out with these guys andfight every week has been great: I've seen a lot ofgreat things. " 
Ryan Grant running back 
my career," fellow tight end Anthony 
Fasano said. "He helped me along and 
showed me the ropes along the way." 
Players like Holiday, Clark and defen­
sive end Kyle Budinscak have made the 
Notre Dame program better during the 
past few seasons, even irthe number or 
wins say otherwise. 
Budinscak has set an example for 
other players, compiling a 3.6 GPA while 
also keeping an upbeat and positive atti­
tude. 
Asked at practice this week what he remembers during his five years as a Notre Dame football player, Budinscak talked of many experiences. A reporter then asked him, "Is there anything you'd really want to forget?" Budinscak paused for a moment, then said, "There's plenty of those too, but they only make you stronger." 
When Notre Dame lost to Brigham Young to open the season, it was Budinscak who was a leader in not allowing the Irish to give up. This team had worked too hard, Budinscak said, to let it all slip away because of one bad performance. 
Notre Dame's seniors have taken excessive amounts of criticism at times throughout their careers. Some ofitjusti­tied, some not. But through it all emerged a group or 36 guys that have defined what a Notre Dame athlete should be. They've been through so much together-two coaching changes, numerous blowout losses and many peaks and valleys-yet thny have bond­ed tognther and battled through it all.

Dunn said of his days as a pre­ferred walk-on in August of 2001. "II tried! to li~-,rure out what was going tm around me -it was def­initely a learning experience." 
The Miami resident grew up rooting for the Hurricanes and wanting to attend an Ivy League college. llownver, the combination of academics and Division-! ath­letics tipped the scales in favor of Notre Dame -that balance, and an emotional family connection to the University. 
"I honestly didn't know any­thing about Notrn Dame football bnlim~ I got here." said Dunn. "It was just a whole new experience for me and that's probably been tho best part of this experience fiw me. eoming in horn not know­ing much about tlw history of Notre Dame football." 

lin did know that his grandfa­ther grew up a diehard Notre Dame fan, watching the games on television throughout hi<> lifetime. 
"I never met my grandfather but it was a place my dad always held in high esteem because [my] grandfather loved it," said Dunn. "I applied there just on a whim." 
Dunn saw some reps and limit­ed action at practice team for offensive guard and offensive tackle. His opportunity to take the field came after his sophomore year, whp,n the long snapper posi­tion opened up. 
Since Dunn took over at long snapper during his junior season, the Irish have been grateful for that whim. lie has yet to be cred­ited with a bad snap, going over 140 consecutive plays without a missed ball. For someone who snapped in just one game in high school, it has been a road of tran­sitions. 
"I basically picked (long-snap­ping] up in the off season, through spring practice, then two-a-days my junior year I was able to win the long-snapping job," Dunn said. "That was my opportunity to get on the field and play and I took the opportunity and ran with 
it... 

The change from offensive line­man to long snapper involved los­ing weight, gaining speed, learn­ing to block immediately after the 
punt and learning a new mental attitude. "It's physically somewhat chat­
lenging, snapping the ball and blocking at the same time is tough to do," Dunn recalled. "[But] I'd say it's more mentally challenging in terms of always wanting a per­fect snap and get the ball back there to the punter so he can get the ball off. I remember when I first got the job everyone was like 'You picked that job? If you screw up everybody's going to know.' You can't screw up, ever." 
But Dunn has done more than just snap well and execute blocks. This September, he catapulted into the public eye when he recov­ered a fumble in the home-opener against rival Michigan. 
"Recovering that fumble was. incredible -for sure one of the best experiences of my life so far," he said. 'There's nothing that can describe standing up with the ball raised above your head and 80,000 people going crazy espe­cially against a team like Michigan ... at Notre Dame Stadium, a stadium filled with his­tory, it's surreal." 
This season will mark the last time Dunn steps on a football field as an athlete, as he moves on to medical school after graduating with a degree in the College of Science's Pre-Professional Studies. As he moves on, the for­mer Zahm resident will take with him the storied Notre Dame expe­rience from academics, football and life on the Notre Dame cam­pus.

RYAN GRANT 
Picking up where he left off· 
A year after backing up Julius Jones, Grant has experienced a rebirth as a running back 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sporrs Edi-tor 
As a sophomore, he was the man. and there were 1.085 reasons (or yards) why. 
Thnn that title went to Julius Jonns in 2003. Then it went to Darius Walknr ­until the original got healthy 
again.  If  
there  was  
ever  any  

doubt what Hyan Grant means to the Irish football team. it was washed away when Grant returned from his hamstring injury this season. 
With Grant in the game this season, the Irish are 5-1; with­out him, they are 1-2. If Irish fans haven't recognized the importance of this senior just yet, then they are missing out. 
Just ask Irish coach Tyrone Willingham. 
"I think it is [easy to look over what Grant adds to the offense!." Willingham said. "First of all, you have to take into account the role of the sen­ior. and the role of the senior is not just on the field. It's what he provides off the field and in the locker room and the kind of play that we have got now with Ryan has been very solid for us in all areas. It was almost easi­er for many to forget that two years ago he was a 1 ,000-yard rushe~" · 
Willingham added that Grant's low-key personality might overshadow his accom­plishments on the field. 
"It's easy to overlook," he said. "I don't know if it's his personality or the way he car­ries himself, but you have that tendency. But he adds a great deal to our football team in terms of pass protection and in terms of understanding pass routes where he can go, where he can't go." 1,000 yards to being a back­up 



As a sophomore, Grant became the seventh player in Notre Dame history to reach the 1 ,000-yard rushing mark in a season. He finished with 1,050 yards and was the first Irish rusher to achieve that mark since Autry Denson did in could finish in the top-five of 1998. For Grant, it was quite all-time leading: rushers at the season after an elbow Notre Dame. injury had sidelined him just a "My initial goal going into the year before. season, if things would have

It is 1hat unselfish attitude that has earned Grant the respect of his teammates and coaches alike, even in injury. 
"I think Ryan has been spe­cial bee a use in the manner in which he has had to work through this year," Willingham said. "Great expectations com­ing into the season and then sufferin5 the hamstring injury, having to fight back, partially out. Hi~; leadership has been speciaL'' 
Thus far, Grant has played in six games, rushing for five touchdowns and 354 yards. He has just 83 carries on the year, but he mmains more concerned with his team. 
"Part of me being a leader on this team I have to make sure all the other guys are mentally sharp," Grant said. "I can't worry about not getting the ball because I can't let other guys on the team see that, feed off that. I have to make sure who­ever's in is taking care of busi­ness. So I feel like that is part of my role on this team." 
Willingham has always acknowledged the importance of Grant to this Irish team, despite ~he ups and downs of his career. 
"What Ryan has done, and I think what he might say, if I could sav it for him, is that the Notre Dame experience has helped make him a man and it's helped mature him and learn to really understand the ups and downs of football and hopefully he can take that into life," Willingham said. 
And Grant remains the con­summate team player. 
"There wer.e other ways I found I Meded to help the team !after I got hurt]," he said. "I want to get wins more than yardag£, so the frustrating part is maybe not having the sea­sons more than [yards]. I want to contribute in any way to the team." 
One last time 
For Grwt and the seniors, Saturday is the last time they will get to play together at Notre Dame Stadium. Grant said he wants this win more than anything. 
"I feel like with everything I've gone through, it's gone fast, my career here," Grant said. "But I still feel like I'm mature and I am ready to move on and take that next step. 
"I feel like I have taken advantage of the time I've spent with these guys -the· good and bad. I appreciate the times I've had with them, and I lay it on the line for them ­they're my brothers for life." 
Grant also said he has really enjoyed the four years he's spent at 1\otre Dame, as it was everything he hoped for and more. 
"It's bee 1 great, even with all the ups and downs of the teams I've played on," Grant said. "To go out with these guys and fight every week and the sweat that goes into playing on Saturdays has been great. I've seen a lot of great things and a lot of great people, and I appreciate everyday I ve had with them."

MATT HASBROOK 
Walk-on lineman transfered to ND fo~r its acaclemics 

By MATT PUGLISI Sports Writer 
The future rarely unfolds as planned. Just ask fifth-year senior defen­sive tackle Matt Hasbrook. A nine-time wrestling All­American 
fresh off an undefeated (49-0) senior year that saw the Indiana­polis, Ind. native take home the 


state title in Hasbrook the 215­pound weight class, Hasbrook was rewarded with a wrestling scholarship by Michigan State and never looked back -for a couple years, that is. 
After being red-shirted as a freshman wrestler, Hasbrook traded in his headgear for a hel­met and tried his hand on the gridiron. 
While the Cathedral High School grad saw action in four games his junior year and was named an Academic All-Big Ten honoree, Hasbrook ultimately decided that Michigan State wasn't quite the fit he had expected and traded in his Spartan green and white for Notre Dame blue and gold. 
In the end, Hasbrook's decision to leave Michigan State was root­ed in a number of factors. 
"There was a multitude of 
things [that went into my decision 
to transfer!," Hasbrook said. 
"Between [Bobby Williams] get­
ting fired at MSU and the team 
was kind of in shambles, and I 
had dropped my wrestling schol­
arship to play football -I was 
already paying out-of-state 
tuition. 

"Coach Willingham had just had 
a great season at 10-3 so I thought why not come to the best football program with the best . academics in the country. I want­
ed to get a better education." 
Per NCAA rules, Fl.asbrook was 
forced to sit out the 2003 season, 
leaving him in a tough position to 
not only earn a spot on the roster, 
but also a starting job. 
"I was on the travel team [at 
MSU], and then I came here and it 
was a pretty humbling experience 
because I had to walk on," 
Hasbrook said. "I think if I look 
back I probably would have 
applied to come here right off the 
bat, because it's so hard to earn a 
starting job as a walk-on in just 
one year." 
Equipped with the unique expe­
rience of having attended two 
major universities in the past 
three years, Hasbrook has little 
trouble identifying the factors that 
separate Michigan State from 
Notre Dame. 
"It's night and day," Hasbrook 
said. "There are 50,000 wild peo­
ple at Michigan Sta~te and there 
are parties all the time and it 
seems like school's just a second­ary option to why you're there­it's pretty much a party school. 
"At Notre Dame everyone's more focused on academics, and the people are a lot closer ­there's a lot more school spirit and it's just a better atmospherP at Notre Dame." 
While academics and atmos­phere certainly contribute to an individual's university experience. of predominate importance arc the fostered friendships. 
"It's been incredible," Hasbrook said. "J'v,~ made so many close friendships with the other fifth­year seniors. I live with Greg Pauly and Billy Palmer and we have a n ally close relationship with Mikn Goolsby, Jared Clark and Kyle Budinscak-we're all really tight. I'm so happy I made the switd because of the friend­ships I've made." 
With thf' senior's collegiate foot­ball careers quickly drawing to a close, Hasbrook looks forward to one d~y bf:ing his own boss. 
''I'd likf. to Tun my own busi­ness, but first start off in the financial sector or sales to earn a little capital," Hasbrook said. "Eventually I would definitely like to own my own company." 
While Hasbrook's plans appear firmly in place, if his collegiate experien ~e is any indication. there's no telling where the talent­ed student-athlete may end up.

Along with tho 1:~ touchdowns and 93S rushing yards lw tallied, Laux was also nanwd to the Academic All-State Lnarn. Dnspitn his prep success, l.aux did not receive any recruit­ing interest from then-Irish head coach Bob Davie and did not take tlw handful of offers from smaller eolleges seriously. 


"!Playing college football! real­ly wasn't a priority for me in high school," Laux said. "Academics was the big thing in my family. So I wally didn't give it much thought until after I was donp, !with high school!." 
Cole's father Chris graduated from Notre Dame in 1979 so it wasn't diflicult for the second­oldest of the six Laux children to deeidn whem to go to college.

Though he has mainly played fullback for the scout team, Laux occasionally lilled in at running bark and tight end to help the first-team defense prepare for Notre Damn's next opponent. But his versatility is not what Laux is most proud of. 
''I'm most proud of my work ethic," he said. "I think I've worked pretty hard and maybe some of that has rubbed off on some of the other guys. Maybe they've stepped up their atti­tudes coming into practice by watching and seeing what I've been doing." 
Laux came back to Notre Dame for a fifth year to finish up the requirements for his finance and history double major and to enjoy. one last season playing football for the Irish. 
"My favorite part of playing has been the camaraderie with the other guys on the team," he said. "Just building relationships with the guys that you're always spending time with day in and day out. Getting to know them and working out with them at 6 
a.m. on Saturday mornings and hanging out with them on a Saturday night. It's been a lot of fun. There are a lot of good guys on the team."

JARED CLARK 
The odd man out 
Clark has been a team player in his role as backup tight end this season 
By JOE HETTLER Sports Writer 
Jared Clark didn't know what to do in thn spring of 2002. 
lin was struggling at quar­terback and had little chance of seeing the l'ield. lie didn't enjoy play­ing football anymore. 
So Clark decided to take a chance: 
"I actually approaclwd one of the ]graduate assistants] and asked kind of out of the blue if there was interest in me playing at another position because I was struggling so bad at quarterback," Clark recalls. "It was really getting to the point where it wasn't fun at all. ]The graduate assistant] said 'Absolutely there's inter­est in you at another posi­tion."' 
"So hP went to the coaches and I aetually asked eoach ]Tyrone] Willingham if it'd be alright if I switched positions and he said, 'You can be a tight end."' 
Switching was no easy task

BILLY PALMER 

No regrets

By MATT LOZAR

With two regular season games left in his Notm Dame rarHer. the Wyntrne llcathrow, Fla. native only has four earner catehes for 44 yards and zero t'ouch­downs. 
lin gots lost in the shuffle behind j u n­ior Anthony Fasano who has broke onto the scene this year, sophomore John Carlson who is naming more playing time by the week and even eonverted linnbackPr and fifth-year snnior .Jnroml' Collins who was making strides hefon~ suffering an injury against Stanford. 
But what Palnwr brings not only to tlw tight Pnd position, but also the Notrn Dame ofl'ense is sonwthing that can't be sef1n on the linld. 
"I think above all he brings a great deal of leadership and stability to the position," Irish offensive line. and tight ends coach MikP Denbroek said. "lie's bnnn around the world more than onee and lends a great deal of experience not only to the position but to the other guys that are there. 
"lie's rnally donn a great job of leading our whole entire offense let alone our tight ends." 
That might not translate into filling out the stat sheet, but with a total of six tight ends eompeting for valuable playing time, Palmer has found his role with the Irish in his fifth and final season in South Bend. 


"I feel if you just do your best and work your hardest, they'll lind a spot for you," he said. 
Coming to Notre Dame 

Palmer was born in Ottawa and played rugby through his sophomore year of high school. Team Canada selected Palmer to be on the under-18 team for rugby, but his family moved to Florida, and Palmer concentrat­ed more on football. He played offensive tackle with former Irish All-American center and current Cleveland Brown Jeff Faine as a junior in 1998 before Palmer transferred to Lake Highland Prep in Orlando for his senior year. 
Palmer caught eight passes his senior year as a tight end to go along with 50 tackles as a defensive end. 
That's when college decision time came. 
And for Palmer, just like many other high school seniors, whether they play football or not, it was something unex­plainable that swayed the final decision to choose the Golden Dome. 
"It came down to Michigan, Ohio State, Florida, Georgia Tech and Notre Dame," Palmer said. "I really felt comfortable here and everyone talks about the combination of academics and athletics, but for myself, it was the special feeling I had." 
Former Notre Dame coach Bob Davie and his stall' reeruit­ed tight ends to play a different role in the offense from what current coach Tyrone Willingham's ofl'ense uses tight ends for. Davie's tight ends were used as blockers and were an afterthought as a pass receiver. 

In his last season in South Bend, Davie's tight ends caught a combined eight passes throughout the entire year. 
This year's team has 38 catches through nine games. 
For Palmer, it's been diflicult, but worthwhile. 
''I'm very grateful for the pre-vious stafl' for bringing me here and very grateful for the cur­rent staff for developing me as a player," he said. "Every time you go through transition, it's not an easy thing, but I was for­tunate enough to grasp the offense and they were confident enough in me to play, so it was a positive transition for me." 


With Willingham and Irish offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick incorporating more of a pro-style offense, the tight end is obviously used more. Willingham recruited tight ends to fit his system that were more complete players where oppos­ing defenses couldn't guess run or pass based just on personnel. 
With six players at one posi­tion, the competition at tight end became intense, but worth­while. 
"I think every eoach demands of his players to be a complete player," Palmer said. "Definitely with this many tight ends, you had to work that much harder to be a complete player" 
"That type of competition only makes you better. I've been blessed with some great guys. It's friendly competition, but there definitely was some com­petition in the offseas-on and during the season, but it's helped us all." 
'The Bachelor' not for him 
Many people make the con­nection with Palmer and his brother, Jesse, who was "The Bachelor" during the show's spring season and is a backup quarterback for the New York Giants. 
But Palmer jokes about not following his brother's foot­steps. 
"Too ugly," he said. 
One family member Palmer in the Canadian Football League. In the 2004 CFL draft, the British Columbia Lions selected Palmer in the fifth round. 
"It's definitely an honor. Being a Canadian citizen, there's a certain amount of pride," Palmer said. "Being selected by the B.C. Lions was definitely an honor to me, and I'm very proud to be Canadian and very proud of the CFL and might be something I pursue down the road." 
Palmer's dad, jnst like throughout his life, hasn't pres­sured his son to play in Canada. 
"My father has always been very happy with me in letting me do what I want to do, so long as I'm successful and work hard at what I do, he's happy," Palmer said. "If that's the case, it just might be it." 
!lis position coach thinks if Palmer wants to play profes­sionally, the CFL is a viable option. 
"I think it's up to him," Denbrock said. "If that's some­thing he chooses to pursue, I think he's got that type of abili­ty." 
Palmer hasn't had a career filled with lots of receptions or touchdowns, but that hasn't develop~1d any ill feelings about his decision to attend Notre Dame for the past five years. 
For Palmer, it's about realiz­ing what an opportunity the past five years have bnen. 
"You know what, I've been extremely fortunate to be here and play with some good foot­ball players, and I've enjoyed my experience no regrets," Palmer said.

STAN REVELLE ­
Scout team quarterback has enjoyed the Irish experience 

By ANN LOUGHERY Sports Writer 
Stan Hevelle sounds like every eoach's dream. 
His team-oriented attitude makes him the kind of player coaches can rely to keep the t e a m 
focused and inspired. 
"When you're prac­ticing day in and day out in the cold and the rain, you find that 


a lot of peo-Revelle pie aren't motivated," Revelle said. "I just kind of convince them that they're an important part of the tnam." 
In his four years at Notre Dame, the unassuming senior walk-on quarterback has risen from an inexperienced freshman to a leader and prominent fea­ture on the scout team. 
A native of Poplar Blufls, Mo., Hevelle comes from a storied high school football career. The all­time leading passQr in Poplar Bluff high school's history, Revelle totaled 370 eompletions for 5,730 yards and 59 touchdowns. Revelle also holds the school record for passing yards with 411 in a game. 
But his accolades didn't end there. 
A.'i a senior, Revelle was named all-state and received the College Football Ball of Fame/National Football Foundation Scholar­Athlete Award and Scholarship as valedictorian of his class. That year, USA Today also recognized the standout Revelle's achieve­ments, dubbing him USA Today Missouri Player of the year in 2000. 
Despite a high school career characterized by glory and achievements, Hevelle remained uncertain whether or not he could find a place on the competi­tive and prestigious Irish team. 
"1 didn't really think it could happen to me, and then it just kind of all fell into place. It was never really something I dreamed about or expected because I did­n't think it was within my reach," Revelle said. 
Hevelle's doubts vanished as he watched a highlight film at an awards banquet. He realized that his love for football was so ingrained in his personality that playing football at Notre Dame was something he had to do. 
"At that moment, I knew I would miss football if I didn't at least give it a try," Revelle said. "I guess I just love to throw the ball. I love to see a good spiral." 
Hevelle joined the team under then-coach Bob Davie in 2001, weathering a rocky 5-6 season. The Irish saw more success Revelle's sophomore year, earn­ing a trip to the Gator Bowl after a 10-2 regular season, but last year, the Irish were 5-7. Revelle described his experience witness­ing the team's progress. 

''I've seen the team evolve from coach Davie through good sea­sons and bad seasons," Hevelle said. "!After Davie], there was more a charige in attitude in the coaches than in the players. They've kind of focused on a per­son being a more of a total pack­age -a great student, great ath­lete and a great person spiritual­!y." 
Hevelle added that each of the .players walk away from the team as stronger individuals prepared to face any challenge. 
"I think being on the team is something that's really going to help me in the working world because it's taught me how to be mentally tough and find unique ways to motivate those around me," Revelle said. 
Revelle will graduate -this year with a degree in electrical engi­neering, and says he hopes to pursue his love of football. 
''I'll probably try to get involved in a social league or a club team," Hevelle said. "It's going to be a hard transition leaving [Notre Dame]. With football, if you put this much time into it, it's not just something you can stop."

But Campbell's greatest value has appeared on .special teams, where Notre Dame has strug­gled but relies on veterans like the Hampton, Va. native to prevent breakdowns. 

"He's a very important part of our special teams, particu­larly at gunner in gunner con­trol on punt return teams," Wilks said. "Those two [gun­ner] positions are very impor­tant to what we're trying to do, and you've got to have guys with speed to plays those posi­tions so no question." 
Regardless of the position he is listed at, Campbell -and coaches-know he has speed. 
The senior also competes on the Irish track and field team as a sprinter, posting a 2004 indoor best of 7.27 in the 60­meter dash last season. 
"He also adds a lot of speed," Wilks said. "He's a track guy, as well, so I think he has a lit­tle bit of both, w be a bound­ary and field corner and a gun­ner. 
Campbell displayed his speed on the big scene in 2003 when he returned a fourth quarter Boston College fumble for a touchdown. Notre Dame would lose the game -its first loss of the season -but the play rep­resented the epitome of Campbell's college career. 
"I would say my sophomore year Lwas most memorable], coming in with the new coach then going in winning eight straight games [and] being on the verge of winning a champi­onship," Campbell said. "Of course, it didn't end like we wanted it to, but that's the year I'll probably most remember." 
Save a few big plays, Campbell feels he did not accomplish the goals he had set coming in as freshman. All the same, the senior has no regrets heading into his final game at Notre Dame Stadium agaim.t Pittsburgh on Saturday. 
"Th111gs happen for a rea­son," Campbell said. "Of course, I didn't have the career I wan :ed to have, but I don't think I had a bad one either. There was always an injury here o ~ there or something like 
that,  but I have  no  regrets  
about anything."  
Head  coach  Tyrone  

Willingham said the loss of Campbell and his classmates, as it happens every year to a group ,Jf seniors, is not cause for despondence. Instead , it is an indelible ritual of college football. 
"It's one of those special acts ­that take place in college foot­ball that you don't get any place else," Willingham said. "That you get to have guys sometimes with four, five years and thon to see them go off and hopefully on to pro careers and beneficial to them and their families. 
"It really doesn't hurt. It's a joyous moment."

Fourth-year seniors 
JUSTIN TUCK 


Justin Tuck made history this sea­son. breaking the Notre Dame career sack record against Tennessee. llis 2:~.S sacks at the tirnn broke the record that was hHid by Kory Minor, and Tuck would latPr add another sack to increase his mark. 
The dofensiV(1 lineman from Kellyton, Ala., was ignornd by largP SEC schools and has been an absolute force since lw lirst came to Notre Dame. Tuck's 6-foot-5, 260­pound frame has been nothing less than a challenge for opponents to block this season. Irish opponents have often been forcnd to double or triple team Tuck, allowing other members of the Irish defense to pressure opposing quartnrbacks. 
Tuck has thP choiee to return to the Irish in 2005 as a fifth-year sen­ior. 
Pat Dillingham 
i\ fornwr walk-on, Pat Dillingham has proven himself a snrviceable backup quarterback tlw past two 
S(~asons. 
Dillingham has S(Wn limitnd action in 2004, but has bonn sueenssful in the four gamns in which hn has part­cipatnd. Tho Portola Vallny, Calif., nativn has eornplnted all three pass­ns hn's attemptnd this season, good for 2H yards. lin saw minimal action against Stanford after an injury knockml start()r Brady Quinn out for the last few minutes of the fourth quartnr. 

Dillingham has two wins to his eredit, inc.luding a 2002 miracle over Miehigan Statn. If hn returns, lw will serve as Quinn's backup again. 
Mark LeVoir 

Onn of the team's veteran lineman, Mark LeVoir has latehed on as the starter at right taekle. After missing . the last three weeks of 2004 practice with an injury, he has bounced back and been one of the team's top linemen this year. 
In 2003, LnVoir startnd all 12 games at left guard, and led the team in play­ing time with 311 minutes, 4H seconds. The Eden Prairie, Minn., native was a first-team pick on the USA Today All­America team. He was a successful tight end in high school, but changed his position to otl'ensive taekle when he arrived at Notre Dame as a freshman. 
LeVoir should return in 2005 as one of the team's most"experienced line­men. 
D.J. fiTZPATRICK 
Former walk-on D.J. Fitzpatrick has come out of nowhern to be one of the most-consistent members of Notre Dame's spncial teams this season. Fitzpatrick first saw action in 2003, after starting kick­er and punter Nicholas Setta went down with a season-ending injury. 
A local product, from Marian High School in Granger, Fitzpatrick has a 75-perc<'nt (9-for-12) suc­cess rate on field goals this season. and a punting aver­age of 42.3 yards per kick. Fitzpatrick has proven reli­able in clutch situations, including a last-minute rield goal to beat Navy in 2003. 
Corey Mays 

Corey Mays has proved himself as onn of the team's most reliable spe-. cia! teams players, seeing action as a backup linebacker capable of playing all three positions. 
Mays has 12 tackles in nine games so far during the 2004 season, with th11 bulk of those coming on special teams. lie played in 12 games in the 2003 season, finishing 1Oth on the team with 26 tackles. He also col­lected a sack, two blocked kicks, a 
fumble recovery and  a  forced fum­ 
ble.  
If Mays decides  to  return, he  

should be a competitor for one of the linebacker spots left by graduat­ing seniors Mike Goolsby and Derek Curry. 

D.J. Fitzpatrick attempts a field goal against Boston College. 
Josh Schmidt 
Irish fullback Josh Schmidt went from a successful interhall football player for Zahm to a walk-on that saw significant action in 2003 and this season. 
Schmidt proved himself as a receiving threat out of the back­field last season, colleeting 13 passes for 125 yards. lie also was serviceable as a blocker for the Irish running backs. 
The Notre Dame rushing attack in 2004 has used the tight end as the primary blocker more often than the fullback, limiting Schmidt's playing time. lie has caught one pass for 14 yards. 
Schmidt has the option to return for a fifth-year in 2005. 
BRANDON HOYTE 


Brandon lloyte's not your typical football player. In addi­tion to his roln as one of tlw team's most-punishing hitters,. lloyte has found time to write and recite pontry and to par­ticipate in eommunity snrviee events.

Darin Mitchell came into the 2004 season as a player whose role was expected to be bigger, but that outcome has not mate­rialized. 
The veteran offensive lineman was a reserve guard his first two seasons, and has continued in that role for the 2004 season. Mitchell has made one start in his career, filling in for an injured Sean Milligan against Michigan State in 2003. 
Because the Irish are not los­ing many linemen, and because of the emergence of young play­ers like Ryan Harris, Mitchell might not see much action if he returns next season. 
Irish fullback Rashon Powers-Neal has shown himself to be a versatile back so far this season. The 6-foot-2. 243-pound bruiser has been used in short­yardage situations in addi­tion to his usual role as a blocking fullback. 
Powers-Neal has also been one of the team's more-con­sistent receivers out of the backfield. leading all backs with eight catches for 51 yards. The St. Paul, Minn., native has a running tom:h­down and a receiving touch­down so far this year. 
Powers-Neal should return in 2005 to give the Irish an additional option on offense, both when running and when passing. 
Zachary Giles 
Zachary Giles has spent most of the 2004 season as the back­up center behind John Sullivan. Giles played in six games in 2003, starting one game (against Michigan State) and finishing the Florida State game at center after an injury to starting center Bob Morton. 
Giles, from Marshfield, Mass., was a Parade All-American and a second team on the USA Today prep All-American team, but has not yet clicked in the Irish starting line. 
With Sullivan returning, it might be difficult for Giles to find playing time at center if he decides to return for 2005.

Jeff Thompson 
Offensive lineman Jeff Thompson has shown him­self to be a versatile player who can play guard or cen­ter, and has served well in a backup role for the Irish this season. 
Thompson is a local prod­uct, p .aying high school foot­ball at Penn High School in Mishawaka, and helping his team to the class SA state title. Thompson has seen action in two games in his Irish career, in addition to making one special teams appearance. 
Thompson has an option to return for a fifth year. 


DAN STEVENSON 
Stevenson has been one of the team's most-consistent linemen in the 2004 season, starting all games so far at right guard. 
The 6-foot-5, 293-pound line­man from Barrington, Ill., has always had football in "his blood. 
His father Mark played for the Detroit Lions, brother Tony played at Arizona State and brother Joey played at Arizona Western. 
Stevenson was one of the top linemen in the country coming out of Barrington High School. He was rated the top offensive lineman in the Midwest by the Chicago Sun-Times, and was a Parade Ali-Americ~n. 
llis first start came in a big game for the Irish in the 200<~ season, when he started at offensive guard against North Carolina State in the Gator Bowl. 
Stevenson has bounced back 
-

successfully from an injury in the Flodda State game in 2003. lle then missed the next two games and returned against Stanford to help Julius Jones rush for 218 yards. Stevenson made 12 special teams appear­anced in 2003. 
Stevenson has been a critical part of an offensive line that has helped quarterback Brady Quinn put up career numbers. 
He should return in 2005 as one of the team's more-experi­enced linemen and help anchor an improved offensive line.

One win six times equals one championship 
By MATT MOONEY Sports Writer 
Cliches are a journalist's nightmare. 
As the type of people who are sup­posed to have some creative ability in the realm of the written word, we sports writers get our jollies from the creative sound byte. 
Muhammed Ali, Dennis Hodman and Shaquille O'Neal are notable wellsprings of quotable gold. 
So when several team members told me early in the sea­son that they were 


just "taking one  Matt Mooney  
game at a time," I  
nodded, smiled and  
tried to rephrase the  Sports Writer  
question to get a dif­ 
ferent answer.  

But when that same axiom kept rearing its head week after week, even from the coach, I was beginning to doubt my ability to ask an effective question. 
The realization soon dawned on me that the generic answers were not a result of bored interviewees (or so I hoped) but rather the product of a team which knows first-hand the dan­gers of looking ahead. 
The ghosts of the 2003 meltdown still haunt Notre Dame. Last year, the Irish reached the heights of a No. 2 ranking with an 18-0-1 record during the regular season only to tragically falter in three of their last five games. 
A Big East semifinal loss to Boston College and two losses to Michigan, once in the regular season finale and again to end the season in the second round of the NCAA tournament, left Notre Dame with no titles and only bitter memories of an otherwise sweet season. 
Therefore, "take one game at a time" became the team's mantra for the 2004 season. To safeguard against a letdown, coach Randy Waldrum broke down the season into small chunks, the non-conference games, the Big East conference schedule and finally the post-season. Each of those segments breaks down into the indi­vidual games, essentially giving the Irish 21 one-game seasons. 
Thus far, the formula seems to have worked. Notre Dame hit No. 1 in the collegiate polls for much of the sea­son. The Irish finished the regular season unbeaten for the fourth time in program history. Connecticut had to come from behind to defeat them in the Big East Championship game. 
But Notre Dame is at the point in its season where one slipup can mean only a long, cold South Bend winter to ponder what could have been. To avoid this, to instead bask in the Caribbean-like glow of a national championship, the Irish will need to break down each game so as to halt a resurfacing trend. 
During the loss to Connecticut, the Huskies had only two shots on goal but converted both into scores. Similarly, in their two postseason losses last year, the Irish only allowed four total shots on goal but three found the back of the net. The Notre Dame offense provided little support, only combining for two goals in the three games. 
The Irish stars will have to step up to turn this trend around. The post­season is the time when National Player of the Year candidates Katie Thorlakson and Melissa Tancredi need to back up those nominations. They need to be the first to embrace the challenge put before them and set an example for rest of their team­mates. 
After all the regular season success, this team is under tremendous pres­sure to win and to avenge last year's failure. The stars and the leaders are the ones who can turn that pressure into an equally large opportunity, a chance to show the nation the extent of their greatness. 
This is chance for the Irish to be great, but they can't look past anyone. They should just go out there and have fun, remembering that there's no "I" in the word "team" but only as long as they take one game at a time.

Irish refocused to begin NCAA tournament 
By MATT MOONEY 
Sports Writt·r 
Short-tnrrn memories an~ at a prmnium as national fintrth seed Notre Damn ( 19-1-1 l kieks ofT iL<> first ganw of the NCAA tourna­ment tonight at Alumni Field at 
7:30 p.m. against Eastern Illinois (13-5-2). 
The Irish nnter the 64-team tournament havingjust blemished thoir perfect record after losing the Big East Championship game to Connecticut 2-1 on Sunday. The loss conjured up memories of the end of the 2003 season when the sears [rom the loss are nothing if not motivational. · 

"We'll never forget about losing in thn second round last year and we don't want that to happen again," she said. "That's constant­ly running through our minds. It'll stiek with us and help us to play harder so it won't happon again." 
Eastern Illinois, a team familiar with playing in South Bend, will be first to test that commitment. Notre Dame hosted the Panthers in iL<> second game of the season, a contest the Irish won easily by a 3-0 maq..,rin.

in a 1-0 upset. The pain from those losses still lingers, but has also taught valuabh~ lessons to players and coaches alike. 
"We can't look ahead," coach Bandy Waldrum said. 'This week we have not wen talked about the other two teams that are here this weekend. Everything has been focused on Eastern I Illinois]. I think maybe that's where we failed a little bit a<> a stall" last year and as players, trying to look ahead and who you may get down the road." 
Senior Kate Tulisiak feels the players, the early 

season is a distant memory compared to where they are now. 
"A game like Eastern Illinois was so long ago that we kind of forgnt," Schefter said. "Honestly, it's kind of like we never really played them. I couldn't tell you who we played three weeks ago." 
As for the present, the four teams playing in South Bend have a higher combined win total than any other site. Waldrum refuses to underestimate any team, regardless of previous match ups. 
"Obviously they went on to have a pretty good year again, winning their conference. The one thing that we've tried to emphasize to the kids is that they've now been in the tournament four years in a row," he said. "Each year you're in it you gain more experience, and you learn to handle it a little bit better. I don't think it's going to be that easy of a time for us." 
Now that the Irish are entering their last stage of the season, there is a tension as players try to stay focused in the present while still maintaining the drive to achieve their larger goals. 
"We knew that we would have a team that was qualified and capa­ble of winning a title," Schefter said. "Pieces are fitting together and if it doesn't end up that [we win a championship! everyone will be very disappointed." 
Meanwhile, the coaches contin­ue to stress that the focus must remain on the game at hand to prevent a letdown similar to the 2003 postseason. 
"We just have to take each game and go from there, win each game and keep going," Tulisiak said. "Coach is always saying that, every practice, every game, all the time. It's always running through our heads." 
The winner of tonight's game will advance to the second round on Sunday against the winner of the Dayton-Wisconsin game. The first two rounds of competition for these four teams will all be played at Alumni Field.
