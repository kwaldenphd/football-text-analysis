Students react to rules 
by Zenon Bidzinski Staff Reporter 
The release of proposed revisions of the student manual concerning the use of alcohol and parties has aroused intense reactions of dormitory students. Reacting to Vice President for Student Affairs Phillip Faccenda's statement that rules will be enforced more strictly this year, students seem to be, according to the various comments, somewhat fearful of a university crackdown. 
Boris Jeleric, president of Zahm Hall, stated, "The students in my hall are very cynical of this policy. They are upset because they feel students weren't adequately represented on the student affairs committee which wrote up the guidelines." 
Steve DeCoursey, president of Cavanaugh Hall, also spoke against the gudelines: "The guidelines are totally unworkable and basically would just inhibit the social atmosphere of the dorm." 
Speaking for his hall he said, "Our students are completely upset, wanting to know who's making the policy and why." 
Coletta Miller, presidential candidate of Farley 
Hall, said, "These guidelines seem like they would 
have been better suited to a Notre Dame of five or 
ten years ago. Notre Dame today is trying to 
establish a highly academic, coeducational com­
munity, but the Administration expects the students 
to submit to a discipline both outdated an inap­
plicable to the intellectual mr. writy of the 
students." 
"The girls," she continued, "agree that we should 
have the freedom to organize social ev·ents, with or without alcoholic beverages, with approval by the rector but without official permiSSion necessary from Student Affairs." 
Two resident assistants in Flanner Hall were also questioned on their views. Because of their af­filiation with the university they could not take a stand, but they did offer some possible results of the revision.. 
Eric Zagrans, tenth floor RA, stated, "Officially.! · see no reason to comment on the guidelines until they are passed by the SLC. Personally, I can foresee problesm whether the guidelines are passed or not because I believe students will attempt to see how far they can bend those guidelines or the existing ones before they will snap back to strike them." 
Dan Novakov, ninth floor RA, took a more definite position, somewhat agreeing with the philosophy behind the polciy. 
"Basically, the idea is a good one," he said. "The moderation they want to achieve is a good thing. 
''Big hall parties did result in a lot of damage," he continued. "But the thing I don't like is that there are limited alternatives." 
Commenting on the possible results of an ap­proved revision, Novakov stated, "I thinkeveryone's life is going to be a little more difficult. The students are going to have to be more conscious of thier social activities and the RA's more conscious of thes~> specific guidelines. 
"Many rectors may even be forced to reevaluate their views and efinitions concerning hall parties," he added.

Text of guidelines 
The Student Life Council will meet again this afternoon to 
act on proposed revisions for the Student M . .;ual. The SLC 
Monday suspended usual procPdure to ''andle these 
revisions. Tie ~ ·gency was in ~·art dcen ~d necessary 
because the main revisions concern tht controversial 
issues of parties and alcohol in dorms. 
""The use of alcoholic beveranes in maceration is ac­cepted at this University. Studunts are permitted to drink in their private rooms, but not in other rooms i·· the halls or elsewhere on campus except in accord with guidelines established by the Office of Stud Affairs. A small private room obviously does not have '"" facilities to hold many people; nor can large pa~ties in living areas of the halls remain isolated enough to allow others to study or rest. We must challenge one another to find more creative ways of socializing.when people come together the use of alcohol must always be seccndary to t• ~ir personal (nteraction." 
The guidelines referred to in the proposed revision were 
also submitted to the SLC on Monday. Partially released 
before, they arP reprinted here exactly as released by the 
Office of Student Affairs: 
GENERAL AND RESIDENCE HALLS: 
No social gathering of any size will ever be of a character 
that is degrading to any of the participants. Therefore any 
drunkeness, boorish behavior or damage to property will 
never be tolerated. 
The I iving quarters of our residence halls are primarily placesforliving and study, and as such cannot physically accommodate social gatherings of any size. Even when an individual hall has adequate recreational facilities, the events that are sponsored there, must always be in character with the home like and academic atmosphere of the place. Events commonly known as "parties" (where the consumption of alcoholic beverages plays a prominent if not dominant rolein the theme of the event) do not con­form to these requirement and therefore may not be con­ducted. 
Examples of sme possible kinds of gatherings which may beconductedin the residence halls would be: Hal\ or section dinners, receptions for guests or lectures ; discussion and seminar groups, etc., where the drinking of wine and beer is obviously incidental to the main activity. 
All social gatherings in the Hall must have the approval 
and the active involvement of the RECTOR AND STAFF. 
The Rector will inform the Dean of Students at least five 
days in advance,stating the nature and place of such ac­
tivities. 
Students are allowed to drink in their private rooms, but also only in a manner that is in harmony with the character of a residence hall. 
Therefore social gatherings in private rooms are to always be private, that is they do not attract undue at­tention, by noise, commotion or numbers, and always are confined to the host's room. 
Again, hospitality and sociability is the emphasis, alcohol 
is secondary. 
OUTDOORS: Th"e public nature of any gathering increases as soon as it is outdoors. Special precautions must be taken to insure the control of attendance and behavior. 
FACILITIES OUTSIDE THE RESIDENCE HALLS: 
The Student Affairs Department will attempt to establiSh 
one or more facilities on the periphery of the campus, 
which may be used by the residence halls for social events, 
which cannot be accomodated in the residence hall. Some 
of the sites under consideration are the Classroom Gym 
Facility behind Holy Cross Hall and the similar structure 
behind Carroll Hall. The use of these facilities by the staff 
and students of the residence halls requires that, (a) the 
events conducted therein be appropriate to an academic 
community and, (bJ conform to reasonabile limitations 
designed to maintaiu order. The former requries that­
1) The host for any event shall be a designated residence hall. but may be limited to one of its regular divisions such as a section, or floor, etc. Attendance at the event must be Iimited to residentsof the host hall and their invited guests. 
2) The number of persons attending the event Shall be limited to the maximum stated capacity of the facility. 
3) The event must have a dominant theme or purpose which is easily recognizable. The consumption of alcoholic beverages must always be secondary to this purpose. 
4) While residence halls may wiSh to conduct such events in a manner that will insure a profil to the hall, no in­dividual orgroup'f individuals may de!"ive a financial profit 
Qf any kind from such events. 
5) The event should be considered out of the ordinary, thus for example, scheduling by the same hall of similar events every Friday evening would be considered inap. propriate. 
The latter requires that: 
1 l Thedate, tme and site for the event must be approved by the Rector of the Residence Hall and the Dean ofStudents Office at least five days before the event. 
2) A request to the Dean of Students for the use of a facility by a Residence Hall shall include a statement of the purpose of the event, the number of persons attending from the residence hall, the number of invited guests, the quantity and type of food and beverage. 
3) The event should not be adve!"tised beyond the host residence hall since such action would encourage violations of the privacy required of such events. This will also, of course, limit the number of females (token or SMCl to the 
event. 
4) The Dean of Students must be informed the names of the students Who will be in charge of the event an Which members of the hall staff will be present for the entire event. This will, of course. cut down on the number of "events" since no one will want to take the blame for any 
damage that might occur. 
5) The residence hall must make adequate preparations . for the cleanup of the facility following the event. TheDean~f 
Students must be satisfied that the hall's plan is adequate before the event may be scheduled and the Dean of Students may require a caSh deposit to insure that the facility is restored to normafcondition. 
6) Good order appropriate to an academic community must be maintained throughout the event. Behavior Which

Student Life Council meets with SBP Dennis Etienne. 
SLC, Etienne zneet on party proble:m 
by Carol Guckert Staff Reporter 

The Board of Commissioners of the SLC met informally last 
night with the president of the student body De 
nis ~tienne, to discuss the p~esent controva-sy of on-~mpus 
pa_rties. Th~ purpose of the meetmg was to clarify any points which 
might be raJSed at the 4:30meeting today with the SLC. 
The purpase of last night's meeting was to revise last year's student manual party rEgulations. Copies of the revised manual will be pr?~ided for those !nvolved at today's meeting. No details of these revJSHilS may beprmted due to the fact that this was a closed meeting. 
. H-Man is hopEful that today's meeting will "clear up a lot of 1~sues and set a definite direction toward the im}J"ovement of social hfe at NotreDame" When asked what he would consider to be a successful meeting, he replied, "One in which everything we discussed tonight is passed." 
Objections raised 
by Jim Donathen Staff Reporter 
"My biggest objection to the proposed guidelines is that they wipe rut all spontaneity. If the guidelines were enforced after a 
N.D. vi.ctory over Southern Cal, it could crea~e an ugly situation," accordmg to Jude Bremer, SLC representative. 
"Macheca's idea of developmental discipline is excellent," she said. "When we leave Notre Dame, we should be mature in­dividuals who can think for wrselves. However, people have to make mistakes in order to learn. H we create a false atmosphere that is too protective, it will not aid our maturation." 
Ed Rahill, anotha-SLC representative, emphasized that parties are a social necessity at Notre· Dame. Although the administration has the responsibility and right to prevent damage in halls and the abuse of alcohol, they must not take away tre right of stwents to socialize. 
"Notre Dame shwld give students more credit for their 
maturity," said Rahill. 
Both Jude Bnmer and Bob Connoly believe that the idea of 
"consistent discipline" lies behind the party guidelines. 
"However, if there are differences in hall facilities for holding 
hall and sectiooparties, it impossible to judge all halls the same," 
said Connoly. 
Faccenda's suggestion that parties in private rooms be "quiet 
enough to be unnoticed by someone passing in the hall" is likely to 
be a point of controversy in tonight's SLC meeting. 
"It's simply unrealistic, "said Mike Hess. "Since life is centered 
in the hall at Notre Dame, the dorm can't have a library at­
mosprere. The hall is a place in which to live." 
Itseems unlikely that the student representatives of the SLC will approve Faccenda's first draft proposal. "If Faccenda's proposal is approved, it will threaten the right of sections and halls to have a party and violate the concept of stay dorms and hall life," said Hess.

Yesterday's lead article on the initial SLC meeting contained an error in statements attributed to Prof. John Roos. 
Prof. Roos claims he said, "A community can and must legislate morality on its basic values, as in civil rights. At Notre Dame, drug abuse and alcohol abuse are fundamental values. The spirit of the rule revision is an appropriate way of dealing with the problem."

Off The Field 
Saturday, ti1e l'ighthg Irish •)pen their 1973 football schedule h•Htle aga:nst North­western. It's not that different from the many )ther home openers that the ND stadium has seen. Except for one thing. 
Hopefully, at the halftime mark of this opener, the stadium won't be the sce:1e of a mad demonstration. 
Athletic Director Moose Krause has sent a letter to every student who picked up a season football ticKet concerning whc ~ has become an annual halftime occurrence...students mobbing the field. 
Originally, the students rushed the field to form an exuberant tunnel through­which the team proceeded to the bench. It was meant to inspire them. Now it onl:, bothers them. 

The team has specifically asked if the tunnel can be discontinued. The coaches have asked this, the athletic director has asked it and the band has even requested iit. 
The tunnel serves no function anylonger. Ithas simply developed into a nuisance for the players, coaches, musicians and everyone else involved. It often destroys the quality of the field and generally makes things difficult for everyone. 
So on Saturday, let your enthusiasm abate itself in the stands. Give everyor.e a break and stay off the field.

Phase II 
We are now faced with the new Phase II guidelines of the current Administration's Disciplinary Stabilization Program. The program started two years ago when Hesburgh & Co. released a series of proclamations concerning parietals and parties. After several SLC meetings, one of which was attended by over six­hundred students, Phase I slowly diminished into a memory. Now, two years later, the Ad­ministration is attempting to revive the program with the newer Phase II guidelines. 
The actual effect of the new 
Phase II plan on the moral 
economy of the campus still cannot 
be ascertained. Phase I died after 
the students strongly opposed the 
Administrative action. Seemingly 
it's the Administration's hope now 
to impliment the Phase II controls 
before the students will be able to 
show their discontent with the new 
guidelines. The central question 
arising from the directive of the 
Student Affairs office is whether 
alcohol is of primary or secondary 
concern. To me this queston is 
rather acdemic. The real question 
lies within the scope of the Ad­
nlinistraton's ability to impose 
controls on the students. In effect. 
will the new controls inhibit the 
dev<>lopment of the students' lives 
rather than aid in that develop­
ment as the Administration con­
tends? 
The immediate result of the Phase II guidelines will be a crucial shortage of dorm parties. The motives behind the Ad­ministration's actions which will

pointin time. Some feel that it is an 
attempt to persuade students into 
moving off-campus in order to 
relieve a shortage of dormitory 
rooms. Still others feel that the 
guidelines were put !forth in a mere 
attempt to squash social life on campus. No matter what the motive is, though, the students are caught on the short end of the stick. 
After the failure of the Phase I 
controls we can only hope that 
Phase II will follow the same path. 
Otherwise, we had better prepare 
for a return to the days of hand­
,11ade brick and lights-out. The 
l 1niversity has come a long way 
since then and now is notimeto step 
backward The Disciplinary 
Stabilization Program should look 
toward the future and create a 
better social on-campus life rather 
than restricting the limited one we 
have now.

Papal Award 
Father Theodore M. Hesburgh today announced that His Holiness Pope Paul VI has sent word to the university president that Notre Dame has been nominated for the annual "Defender of the Faith" award, given to outstanding universities throughout the world. 
The Pope said that Notre Dame is an excellent example of what the Catholic Church has long strived for-absolute faith in the teachings of the clergy (or any reasonable facimile thereof, e.g. a Dean ot Students). The Pope cited the recent decision "'y the SLC to accept the decision handed down

portance in social functions. 
The Pope also told Father Hesburgh personally that he favors ~otre Dame above any other institution for the award since by this action, he hopes to get more money from rich Notre Dame alumni. 
In a separate dispatch to the student body of Notre Dame his Holiness warned that winning this award was up to them. He stressed that the award would be forfeited if any students was caught with an alcoholic beverage not previously approved by the Dean of Students as a secondary condieration.

I was walking along the quad in deep meditation the other day <which is a nice way of saying I was counting cracks in the sidewalk), when I overheard the following conversation: 
"Hey, didja hear Cat Stevens died?" 
"Oh, really," came the answer. "Again?" 
It was then I knew that the season was upon us. The rumor season, that is. You see, Notre Dame may suffer from a lack of good weather, decent bars, and fast women, but it literally thrives on rumors. Father Burtchaell nonwithstanding, at duLac, rumor 
is king. 
Psychologists and sociologists have spent years investigating rumors. Why do people repeat such things? Why do they listen to them? The answer, of course, is simple: rumors are fun, and they are easy. Just say something outlandish, and then claim no responsibility for it. If you preface a rumor with, "Listen, some guy in one of the towersswearsthis is true,"your story has all the veracity a rumor demands. And, no matter how much fun it is, it's almost a person's solemn responsibility to the community to repeat every rumor he's heard. Rumors are much like chain letters. They may be sillv, but it's best to pass them on, just in case. 
All of which brings me to the heart of this column. I am well aware of how hectic the first few weeks of school can be. What with fixing up rooms, meetings new people, and even some feeble at­tempts to stave off the exam week rush by studying, a good many of you have probably lost out on some particularly fine rumors. It is for you, then, that I present a select few of my favorite rumors, collected during my salad years at Notre Dame. The next time you meet a friend, pass one on: 
--Everybody in Walsh hall is engaged. --St. Mary's will collapse in two years without Notre Dame. (A very popular rumor about two years ago.) -You can always judge someone's importance in hall govern­ment by whether or not he has a john in his room. --Ara Parseghian will convert to Catholicism when we win a National Championship. ~ 
--The fourteenth floor of the library is stocked with Playboy bunnies and boxcar load of booze, all for the use of selected members of the faculty and administration. 
--The Beatles are back together and cutting a record in <London, Los Angeles, Memphis) right this very minute! --Father Hesburgh will retire in a year. <This particular rumor was originally mongered in 1955.) --Notre Dame has installed one hundred thousand dollars worth of sprinklers, merely to keep people off the grass. -The dining hall puts saltpeter in the mashed potatores every weekend. 
--Juneau, Alaska gets more sunshine than South Bend. 
--If security catches a streaker, they will ask for his I.D. 
As with any rumor, I can't really prove that any of the above are true. Whether or not you believe them is up to you. All I can tell you is that some guy from Flanner swears by that one about Alaska.

SUPPLEMENT TO UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME OBSERVER-cOUNTRYMAN'S PRESS 




UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME 
The University of Notre Dame, located in Notre Dame, Indiana, near South Bend, was founded in 1842. The campus is 1,250 acres and presently holds 8,557 students and approximately 650 faculty members. Because it is surrounded by two lakes and countryside, the campus lends itself to a unique separate i­dentity. This, combined with the excellent self-governed boards within the University, leads to a strong solidarity among the mem­bers of this academic commun­ity. 

The University maintains 20 residence halls, of which four are used by the new female population. Women were first allowed into the 130 year-long bastion last year. Each hall governs itself within a larger structure of representation in­side the University. All fresh­men must live on campus un­less they live at home in South Bend. 
The academic organizations consist of a freshman program, four undergraduate colleges, a law school, varied graduate re­search centers as well as a graduate business school and graduate program in four div­isions. The four undergraduate colleges are: College of Arts and Letters, College of Busi­

ness Administration, College of Engineering and College of Science, totalling 35 potential bachelor degrees. 
One noteworthy building on the Notre Dame campus is the Mem­orial Library. Standing 13 stor­ies high and housing over a mil­lion volumes, the building is the largest university library in the world. Other exciting buildings are the Athletic Convocation Center, a double-domed arena, and Stepan Center. Across from the ACC is the stadium. 
Among other events, Notre Dame students present plays, concerts and lectures each year. They also print a daily student newspaper.

THE 



TEAM 
by Vic Dorr Observer Sports Editor 
In three days, Notre Dame and Northwestern will play a foot­ball game. 
Like any other played during the course of any college foot­ball season, the game will be a significant one for head coach Ara Parseghian and his blue and gold-clad legions. It will give them a chance to move up in the national ratings (the Irish are currently the nation's eighth-ranked team). 
It will give Parseghian a chance to become a first-game winner for the tenth time in the past ten seasons. 
And it will give the Irish a chance to keep their '73 ledger (now 0-0) unblemished on the right-hand side. 
But Saturday's Notre Dame-Northwestern clash will have more than the usual significance 
a year more mature, and a year more experienced. " ...we're a far better defen­
sive team now than we were a 
year ago. There's no question 
that we're quicker and that we're 
reacting better. Notre Dame has 
been a leader in team defense seven of the nine years I've been here, and we hope to return, this year. to our usual quality in team 
defense.·· 
And with seven defensive start­ers returning from last year's 8-3 squad, Parseghian's Irish may do just that. 
In the defensive backfield par­ticularly, experience may well be the by-word during the '73 sea­son. Defensive co-captain Mike Townsend (6-3, 183), who led the nation in interceptions last sea­son. senior Tim Rudnick (5-11, 187), and junior Reggie Barnett (5-ll, 188) own three of the four positions in the deep defense, and the fourth belongs to a freshman, Luther Bradley (6-3, 190). Mike Parker, Bob Zanot, Pat Sarb, and Tom Lopienski are coach Paul Shoults' backup strength. 
The linebacking unit, the core of Notre Dame's 4-3-4 defense, is built around two juniors and a senior. Drew Mahalic (6-4, 220), the hero of last year's 42­16 victory over Pitt, Sherm Smith (6-2, 210), and fourth-year man Gary Potempa (6-0,234), are holding down the first positions for coach George Kelley's line­

ahead. We're a year older now, Clements, who piled up 258 minutes of playing time in 1972, proved himself a daring, durable performer. But his back-up, Cliff Brown, is no less capable. Brown saw less than 20 minutes of playing time last year, but in 1971, as a starter for seven games, he completed 56 passes in 111 attempts. 
Protecting Clements andBrown, and opening holes for the likes of Penick, Bullock, and Best, will be an offensive line which has had more than its share of adversity this fall. 
Guard Frank Pomarico, a pre­season All-American and NO's offensive captain, tore a ligament in his right ankle three weeks ago, and will not see action in opener. Pomarico has been in a cast since the first of Sep­tember, and won't play again un­til the early-October battle with Michigan State, at the earliest. 
Team captain Dave Casper, switched from tackle to tight end during the spring, has just left the disabled list, and is still nursing an injured shoulder. And Casper's back-up at tight end, junior Ed Bauer, suffered torn ligaments in his knee (Bauer's injury occurred just minutes af­ter Pomarico's) and has been sidelined for the duration. 
But with the multi-talented Casper (6 -3 ,252) back, the Irish do have a solid nucleus around which to build an offensive line. Joining Casper is another return­ee, junior guard Gerry DiNardo (6-1,242), and they, along with receivers Pete Demmerle (6-1, 
196) and Willie Townsend (6-3, 
196) give the offensive line most of its seasoning. 
Mark Brenneman (6-4, 240) has entrenched himself in the number one center's position, and one of two senior guards. Dan Morrin (6-3, 240) or Tom Bolger (6-2, 239) will replace Pomarico for the first third of the campaign. A pair of jun­iors, Steve Sylvester (6-4, 248) and Steve Neece (6-3, 245) have earned the first-line tackle pos­itions. 
Two other players, both spec­ialized, complete the team Par­seghian will send against the 'Cats on Saturday afternoon. Senior Brian Doherty will han­dle the punting chores for the Irish, though his day most suc­cessful if he never has to leave the bench. It's the other way around, though, with Bob Thom­as, NO's dead-eye place-kicker. Thomas clicked on every one of his 34 extra point attempts last season, and hit <>n seven of 11 field goal tries as well. And last year, in the 37-0 season opener against Northwestern, Thomas booted three field goals --one from 47 yards--and four PAT's, 
The Wildcat's "rookie" coach, Johnny Pont, certainly hopes to see less of Thomas than did his ,Jredecessor, Alex Agase, and to do that he'11 try to keep the ball away from the Irish offense-­by hanging onto it himself. 
Northwestern's attack may not be geared to a ball-control, grink-it-out style of play this year, but it may well be an ex­plosive. big-play attack. Junior Mitch Anderson, the Big Ten's leading passer last season, will spearhead Northwestern's "I" formation offense, but he won't be called upon to do it alone. 
He'll have ample receiving targets in tight end Steve Craig (6-3, 222), and wide receivers Bill Stevens (5-11, 180) and 
Steve Harris (5-10, 165). The 
Wildcat backfield, featuring tail­back Greg Boykin and fullback Jim Trimble, will also be strong. Boykin, a second team all-con­ference pick last year, was one of the nation's finest frosh run­ners, and Trimble gained 339 yards, including two 100-yard efforts, despite missing five games because of a shoulder in­jury. 
Northwestern's question mark is its defense. Two seniors, linebacker Mike Varty (~-2, 230) and safety Greg Swanson (5-10, 
175) have assumed leadership of coach Pont's anti-touchdown pla­toon, but there is youth in the middle of the defensive line, des­pite the presence of two veteran performers, senior George Pet­rak and junior Joe Verzino at the tackles. 
But Pont, like Parseghian, has been encoaraged by the way his "D" has developed during the fall. "The defense is looking muchsbetter since last spring,·· he said. "They've come a long way and have gained some very valuable experience.'' 
The Wildcats may have c.:>me a long way since Pont first rook over early last spring, but the Irish, with a more urgent voal in mind, may well have noade still longer strides. The 1wo clubs will settle that question on Saturday afternoon. 
But Notre Dame will have one 
big advantage in in the contest.

Pass-fail system reviewred 

by Tony Proscio Staff Reporter 
Students taking courses under the pass-fail option next semester may be allowed to change that decision up to one month before completeing the course. A proposal before the Academic Council would make that choice possible, Assistant Provost William Burke said. 
The proposal, which would permit students to accept a grade from a course previously taken pass-fail, has been awaiting consideration for over a year. Fr. Ferdinand Brown, associate provost and council secretary, says the matter will be on the agenda for th council's October meeting. 
Its chances, sources say, are hard to predict. The idea began in the Council of the College of Arts and Letters in th Fall of 1971. It was passed at the Spring me•:-ting by one vote. 
The purpose of the new p·:>licy would be to allow students who chose pass-fail, which registers credit but no grade, to change their minds. If a student takes a course proposed to the university Academic Council by Arts and Letters Dean Frederick Crosson. 
It has been stalled there for two reasons, Burke explained. First, the council's agenda for both meetings last year was taken up with revision of the faculty manual. The second reason is that the pass-fail option itself was passed on a trial basis and will be reviewed at the council meeting this fall. 
"We accepted pass-fail for a two­year periodwith a third year used to formulate statistics and present 
a  report,"  Burke added.  "That  
was in the  Fall of '69."  
He  said  the  reporlt  seems  

positive. It is accompanied on the agenda by a proposal to allow pass­fail courses in the sophomore year and by the AL Council's proposal. 
The two-year study was con­ducted by Burke's Subcommittee on Grades. Its report is ba5ed on the numbers of students using the option, types of courses involved, the performance of students in pass-fail courses, and the success of similar programs around the country. 
The date of the council's October meeting is still uncertain. 
Minority plans announced 
b) Denise Crov. iey Staff Reporter 
Joe Moskowitz is the newly appointed Minority Social Com­missioner of the Student Union. The office was created to provide movies, concerts and lectures fo: minority students. 
One of the first functions of this commission is a free movie, "Soul to Soul," on Sept. 25 in Washington Hall. It's an African rock festival which celebrates the fourteenth anniversary of Ghana. Some of the stars are Roberta Flack, Santana and lkf' and Tina Turner 
·"I'll be trying to bring in events and speakers that are outstanding contributions to the world and the members of their race," explained Moskowitz. Black exploitation films like "Shaft" and "Super Fly" won't be shown, he added. 
The idea of a Min;;rity Social Commissioner was first brought up last year by the SLC, but it was dropped. This year the assistant director of the Student Union. Pete Bolander, appointed Moskowitz the commissioner. 
"I think it's a tremendous idea for the black community," said Moskowitz. "I hope other minorities that haven't gotten along with blacks, here or anywhere, will also offe;·

Food p',rices uniforJn 
by Ken Bradford Staff Reporter 
A survey of prices at area grocery stores shows little variance in prices of food. 
Of the nine stores checked, the difference in price of milk, eggs, coffee, peanut butter, eigarette5, and crackers is minimal. The price of milk, for example, ranged from $1.18 to $1.23 per gallon. 
Bread, apples, cheese. ice cream, and hamburger showed larger ranges in prices, due mostly to differences in quality of the merchandise. A three-pound bag of apples sells for $1.19 at Wilt's Supermarket and forty-nine cents at the Ayr-Way Thrif-T-Mart. 
A twenty ounce loaf of bread sells for twenty cents at Mersit's Grocery and forty-seven cents at Wilt's. Hamburger varied ac­cording to content and quality.

Hall residents douse fire 
by Pete McHugh Staff Reporter 
Only twelve hours after the burning of the red barn, two Morrissey Hall residents prevented a trash bin fire from spreading to their dormitory by extinguishing it themselves yesterday. 
At approximately 5:30 p.m., Bart Pollock and Jed Eide entered their basement roomto see flames jumping toward their window from a large "dumpster" in the Morrissey parking lot adjacent to Lyons Hall. After alerting the rest of Morrissey's basement "Dirty Thirty," they untangled their floor's fire hose and stretched its length to the receptacle. In fifteen minutes the two students had brought the flames under control. 
As smoke billowed into the Morrissey basement, a large number of Morri~sey and Lyons residents Yiewed the actin from the comparative salt ty of the upper floors. The nearby n•oms suffe~ed 
only mmor smoke ana fire damage. No cause was given for the blaze. 
Eide comn.ented, "We weren't even sure the old hose would work, but we had to give it a try."
