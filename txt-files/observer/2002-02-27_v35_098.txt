College begins new transfer system 
. Saint Mary's improves system for Holy Cross transfer students 
By SARAH NESTOR 
News Writer 
In an effort to provide coopera­tion between Saint Mary's and Holy Cross Colleges, an agree­ment has been signed that allows students who receive an associ­ates degree to make an easier transfer into Saint Mary's. 
"This articulation agreement has been the d~sire of the two institutions and their presidents for many years," said Saint Mary's Dean of Faculty Karen Ristau. 
"It has taken careful review during the development stage and is now finalized. It may result in a small increase in our enrollment but actually since it is a benefit to Holy Cross students, they may see it as a positive mar­keting strategy for their college." 
Students at Holy Cross who wish to transfer to Saint Mary's for a bachelor's degree will be able to do so with a minimal loss of credit. The agreement notes that Saint Mary's does not accept courses from two-year colleges to substitute for 300 and 400 level courses and that this holds true for Holy Cross. 
Students who wish to transfer must assume that courses beyond the introductory level will count as general electives. A grade point average of 3.0 is also required of Holy Cross transfer students and applicants must submit an official transcript, a recommendation from an advisor and an essay. 
"It was our intention to make the transfer process a bit smoother by giving prospective transfer students from Holy Cross, a clearer understanding of the admission process, which courses would transfer and what grade point average would be required," said Saint Mary's admission director Mary Pat Nolan. 
This articulation agreement does not affect the Saint Mary's­II o ly Cross College Linkage Program. The Linkage Program is for one year only and during this year students take four courses at Holy Cross and one course at Saint Mary's, while residing on Saint Mary's campus. To be admitted as a full-time Saint Marv's student a GPA of 
3.0 i.s required.

Protestors attempt to deter play-goers 
By KATE NAGENGAST 
A,sociatc News Editor 
Two members of the Pro-Life Action League of Chicago were removed from the lobby of DeBartolo Hall by Notre Dame Security/Police Tuesday night for distributing fliers to people about to enter a performance of the "Vagina Monologues.'' 
Joe Scheidler, a 1950 Notre Dame alumnus and his com­panion, Monica Miller drove from Chicago despite snow­storms to represent a group of "concerned Catholics [who believe] the Vagina Monologues promotes a false view of wom­anhood and human sexuality. " according to their press release. 
Scheidler and Miller attempt­ed to dispense two fliers to hundreds of people waiting to be admitted to the Monologues performance in Room 101 DeBartolo Hall. One flier fea­tured the word "Integrity" and described how thev believe the Monologues is steeped in vile sexual language, denigrates heterosexual love and mar­riage and is verbal pornogra­phy that donates its proceeds to pro-abortion groups. 
The other flier read, "Is THIS What You Want?" beneath a picture of the Golden Dome with the Virgin Mary erased from the Dome's peak. 
"It's unthinkable to have something like this at an insti­tution that claims to be Catholic," said Scheidler, the uncle of David Scheidler, for­mer rector of St. Edward's Hall. "It's dirty. It's promoting lesbianism, masturbation and pedophilia." Miller pleaded with ticket holders to "stop wasting the money you've spent on a Catholic education" as she was escorted out of the building. 
"[The Monologues] degrade human dignity," ·Miller said. "I don't care how good the cause is, this is verbal pornography. 
It denigrates everything a Catholic university should stand for." 
Scheidler and Miller also con­tacted members of the Knights of Columbus. including Grand Knight and Notre Dame senior Nathaniel Hannan to request support. Hannan and fellow Knights of Columbus member. Kevin Haley, a Notre Dame junior, prayed the Rosary while Scheidler and Miller distributed fliers. 
"We consider this equivalent to a play sponsored by the Arian nation at a Jewish uni­versity," Hannan said. Hannan has read the Monologues script four times and opposes the play as a violation of the core teachings of the Catholic Church, he said. Hannan also denied rumors that the Knights of Columbus had purchased tickets to the Monologues in an attempt to keep people from viewing the production. However. the Knights of Columbus is considering future programming, such as public speakers to combat the Monologues message. 
"I saw the show in London and feel like [these protesters) are distorting a lot of what is in it," said Becky Luckett. a Notre Dame junior who saw tho show again Tuesday. 
"It's really funny, but it's also very serious and it causes you to think about a lot of things women are afraid, or at least have been taught not to think about." Kerry Walsh, director of the Monologues, opened the show with a reference to Scheidler and Miller's flier. 
"Is this what you want for Notre Dame? Hell yeah," she said to a packed audience. Walsh's "V-Day" programming continues through Wednesday with a Talk-Back session from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. in LaFortune's Montgomery Theater.

The dining halls at this University are a social

single tables to the side. 

Aside from being open later and having a greater variety of food, South is obviously better than North. To fully under­stand the dining halls we must first examine the people who spend the most time there: the work­ers. Even more important than hours of opera­tion and quality of food, South Dining Hall work­ers arc far more bizarre and in effect more entertaining than the 'Northies.' However, there is that one young feller at North with the obnox­ious face piercings who walks around like there is nothing odd about his appearance. He's my favorite. 
When South employees eat they are out in the open with their clique for all student.s to witness. The 'Northies' always hide out in those intimate little rooms immediately to the right and left of the card scanners. 
The people who scan the ID cards are also an enclosed community predominantly made up of the more ... how can I phrase this non-offensive­ly... "Senior" employees. These people always bring a smile to my face because there are some that won't even look at you, and others who always give me a warm "How are you?" whenev­er I give them my card. I always return with, "Fine thanks," or my more saccharin, "Boy, it's cold out there!" They smile at my response, even though they make the same query of every stu­dent and hear basically the same response every time. 
I don't really see much interaction between the scanners and the more disgruntled workers who put the food out. The food attendees give you dirty looks when you spend too much time at the condiment table when they are about to replenish it. 
The students that frequent the dining hall are as diverse as the staff that works in them. There's the, "early bird" that shows up right at 
4:30 p.m. for dinner in order to beat the evening rush. This particular group should own stock in Papa John's because they are the one's who are always ordering breadsticks at 11 at night because they can't go to sleep hungry. 
Next is the dining hall "celebrity" who walks in an entourage of five to ten at the most con ­gested dinner hour. They're usually overdressed and love to take up the most visible table that the North and South eateries have 'to offer. Half the time they are not even hungry. They're main goal is to be seen by others and socialize in pub­
lic. They're travel from the front table to the food line is a runway walk where they stop and chit ­chat with other dining hall socialites. When they eventually do get back to the table, they do not sit down but rather stand there cackling and pre­tending like this particular dinner outing was better than last night.s. 
I am a member of the group of dining hall patrons known as the "closers." We stumble in after 8:30 p. m. and we usually don't leave until the clean up crew turns on the stereo to rock out as they clear the tables of debris. 
I know many ofyou will be eating lunch or dinner when you read this. The dining hall is a melting pot ofthe different personalities that make up this great institution. Some of the more eccentric and colorful characters stand out more than others, but who in the hell wants to go to a school where everyone looks exactly alike. Take a look around. Remember the various dining hall faces because I am sure that they point and talk about you just as much as you talk about them.

BEYOND CAMPUS 
University of Illinois initiates action after hate crimes 
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 

A Muslim student was attacked Dec. 16 at the corner of Fifth and John streets; the weekend before, sev~ral men attacked an Asian-American stu­dent at Third and Green streets. Both victims claim their attackers used racial slurs. 
"We don't know if the assault was a hate crime because it's still under investigation," said Kush Bambrah, National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium staff attorney, in regards to the incident at Third and Green. "In light of the backlash fol­lowing the terrorist attacks and in light of the fact that the victim was South Asian, you can't be too care­
ful." 

These are the latest in a string of attacks that have been tagged hate crimes, including an incident earlier 

last semester in which a University of Illinois student started a fight at a campus bar when he allegedly called a 19-year-old Hindu student a "ter­rorist" and assaulted him. 
The most recent alleged hate crimes seem tied to racial tensions following the Sept. 11 attacks, but 
hate violence crimes committed 
because of someone's ethnicity, reli­
gion. sexual orientation or gender -is 
nothing new to campus. 
Racially motivated crimes of the 
past few years have motivated stu­
dent groups, University administra­
tors and campus police to educate 
students about tolerance and to work 
toward preventing hate violence. 
State legislation on hate crimes also 
has become more stringent in recent 
years. 
Although no campus hate crimes 

were reported in 2000, according to University police statistics, three were reported in 1998 and 1999. One of the three was racially motivated; the other two were based on sexual ori­entation. 
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY 
Summer internships more scarce 
EVANSTON, Ill. 

When McCormick junior Sai Krishna went to the Chicago Universities Bioengineering Industry Conference Career Fair, he said he found about five companies there. But only one was looking for sum­mer interns. Disappointed that there weren't more internship opportunities, Krishna said he decided to apply for several campus research positions instead. "I know that an internship is different from a job, but the state of hiring scared me and made me more interested in research," Krishna said. Northwestern University has seen a 25 to 30 percent decrease in the number of summer internship recruiters this year. Particularly hard hit have been consulting, finance, information technology and engineering, said Thy Nguyen, an internship coordinator for University Career Services. On-campus recruiting also has decreased at Stanford and Princeton uni­versities, according to career services staff at both schools. 
UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA 

Funds not affected by Sept. 11 
PHIIADELPHIA 

Although last fall's struggling economy forced many schools into a tailspin, administrators say University of Pennsylvania has come out relatively unscathed. Speculations the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks might impact fund raising at universities nation­wide were confirmed earlier this month in a report released by the Association of Fundraising Professionals. According to the study, educational orga­nizations saw a 37 percent decrease in fund-raising efforts last October compared to the previous year's fig­ures. Penn saw a similar drop in returns from its fund­raising campaign in October; however, administrators said this was due largely to the University's decision to postpone sending out fund-raising solicitations immedi­ately following the attacks. "On the annual fund, it dipped immediately after Sept. 11 because we didn't think that it was appropriate to be making phone calls," said Virginia Clark, vice president for development and alumni relations.

James LaBella, general manager 
of food services at The Huddle. 
"The honest people are having to 
pay more because of the dishon­
est people," LaBella said. Cameras have been installed in the Huddle, granting visu­al access to areas previously obstructed under the former svstem. · LaBclla, who is extremely pleased with the new system, and who is responsible for first confronting the stu­dents, says that he will never approach anyone unless he is sure. However, he maintains, "We've always had theft in the Huddle. and we've always caught people, but now (with the new system) it is just a lot easier." Though there has been no specific trend to the theft in terms of items stolen, or the time of day at which the theft occurs, offenders are obvi­ously more likely to steal higher priced items such as cough and cold medicines. After many students have 
been caught, their common response is that these items are high cost items towards which they did not want to use their Flex points, said LaBeHa. 
However, an interesting trend that was also acknowledged by the head of Campus Security, Rex Rakow, is that "people that take things almost always have funds on them to pay for the goods." 
This trend seems to indicate that the theft is often done for the thrill of the act, or simply because people feel that they can get away with it. which is most often the case in an open envi­ronment such as the Huddle, according to Rakow. 
The policy of The Huddle, according to LaBella, is to prose­cute offenders. If a student is caught stealing, campus security is immediately contacted to come and arrest the student. From there, the offender is inter­viewed by security and then sent on to the office of Residence Life.

Senators said they didn't believe him. Former coHeagues continued to contradict him. Yet, ever the salesman. former Enron Corp. chief executive Jeffrey Skilling defended himself at length and combatively before Congress. 
Putting himself at potential legal risk for the second time this month, Skilling testified Tuesday at a Senate hearing and domi­nated the scene during a five­hour appearance with an Enron vice president, Sherron Watkins, and President-Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey McMahon. 
McMahon acknowledged that, with massive shredding of fman­cial documents said to have occurred at Enron's Houston headquarters, "I don't believe we know what records are destroyed." 
Watkins, separated from Skilling at the witness table by his lawyer, told the Senate Commerce Committee she had no doubt Skilling was aware of the problems posed by Enron's use of partnerships that were largely buttressed by company stock, contrary to normal accounting practices. 
Sharply disputing Watkins, Skilling denied he had misled 
"I never duped Ken Lay," Skilling declared, using Watkins' wording. 
Watkins characterized Lay in harsher terms than she had at a House hearing earlier this month, saying Tuesday that he missed an opportunity to "sal­vage" the company when she warned him of problems last summer. 
Skilling maintained he was unaware of improper financial transactions with a web of out­side partnerships that kept more than $1 billion in debt off the energy-trading company's bal­ance sheet and eventually brought it down. 
Skilling, who cashed in $66 million of company stock, resigned abruptly in August around the time that Watkins was warning Lay of potentially serious accounting problems. The company. which was ranked the seventh-largest in the coun­try, crumbled Dec. 2 in the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. histo­ry. 
Watkins says Skilling; along with Huron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, and its outside legal advisers, misled Lay and Enron's board of directors.

CARACAS 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, in an inter­view published Tuesday, dismissed growing calls by military officers for his resignation. But a U.S. official said Venezuelan officers have raised the possibility of a coup. 
Chavez told the French daily Le Monde that the dissident officers "are dis­satisfied for personal rea­sons" and that risks of a military coup are "zero." 
"Venezuela has a gov­ernment that was legiti­mately elected and enjoys popular support. I might even say that it enjoys more popular support than any other country in the American continent," he said. He claimed the news media were "putting on a show" with the offi­cers. 
Adding weight to the dis­s id ents' argument that they speak for a silent majority in the ranks, a Bush administration offi­cial said Tuesday that some Venezuelan officers have sounded out U.S. diplomats about how Washington would react to a coup. They were told the 
U.S. stridently opposes any s.,ubversion of Venezuela's democratic process, the official said on condition he not be identified. 

In Washington. a State Department spokesman said the United States has made no secret of its con­cerns that Chavez has tried to stifle dissent. 
"We believe that all par­ties should respect democ­ratic institutions," said the spokesman. Richard Boucher. 
"That applies to whatev­er direction the attacks on democracy might be com­ing from," he added. 
Chavez, a former army paratrooper who led a failed coup in 1992, was overwhelmingly elected president in 1998 on an anti-poverty, anti-corrup­tion platform. His current term expires in 2007. 
Already locked in a ver­b al war with business, labor, the news media and the Roman Catholic Church, Chavez has strug­gled for weeks to play down perceptions of mili­tary discontent. Those efforts suffered another blow Monday when a fourth military officer demanded that he resign. 
Air Force Gen. Roman Gomez Ruiz urged other colleagues to speak out, citing alleged government corruption and what he called Chavez's politiciza­tion of the armed forces.

DAMIETIA 

Multicolored party lights were still hanging from Heba Maamoun Orabi's balconv Tuesday, strung out for what was meant to have bMn a wed­ding celebration. Instead, they were a macabre backdrop for a funeral. 
Orabi was one of 22 people killed Monday in the collapse of an aging, Nile-front building that housed. among other things, a hair salon that was popular with brides. At least five women preparing for their weddings died in the four-story building. 
Hundreds of people converged on mosques around the town of Damietta, 105 miles north of Cairo, to pray over coffins. All but one of the 22 dead were women; 25 other people were injured. A mother of one victim screamed wildly and beat her fists on the door of an ambu­lance covered with flowers. The vehicle bore the coffin holding her daughter-17-year-old jour­nalism student Basma el-Efny. 
"She was an angel, she prayed all the time, she used to kiss me all the time. Who is going to kiss me now?" said the woman, who only identified herself as Manal. 
Mana} said her daughter had been at the salon ·with bride-to­be Shireen Said el-Sarta and el­Sarta's sister, Rasha, when the building collapsed. All three died, the mother said. 
At another funeral procession, the coffin of 18-year-old :Vlarwah el-Khouli was draped with a white satin sheet. A relative said that was a sign both.of a wed­ding and of a bride-to-be who dies prematurely. 
"We were preparing for a wedding. now we are having a funeral." said Orabi's uncle, who identified himself only as Ahmed.

ZIMBABWE 
Treason claim condemned 
. Government charges opposition candidate in plot to kill president 
Associated Press 
JOHANNESBUHG 

Foreign governments and human rights groups on Tuesday condemned Zimbabwe's decision to charge the opposition presi­dential candidate with trea­son as an attempt to disrupt the March 9-10 elections. 
Zimbabwe's government on Monday charged Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, in connection with an alleged plot to kill President Robert Mugabe. On Tuesday, party secretary-general Welshman Ncube and law maker Henson Gasela were also charged, said their lawyer, Innocent Chagonda. 
Tsvangirai was held for two hours and then released. The two others also were released after being charged. 
U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said government officials have yet to provide proof that Tsvangirai and his two aides engaged in treasonous activi­ties. 
"This appears to be another blatant example of President Mugabe's increasingly authoritarian rule and his government's apparent deter­mination to discredit, intimi­date and repress the opposi­tion in the approach to the presidential election," Boucher said in Washington. 
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Tuesday that the charges "lack credibility." He threat­ened to ask the Commonwealth, an associa­tion of Britain and its former colonies, to withdraw its elec­tion observers if Tsvangirai is imprisoned before the elec­tions. 
"They are not real charges. I don't think in the real world you can charge people with treason and then let them go free," said Lovemore Madhuku, head of the National Constitutional Assembly, a civic group that helped defeat a government­backed constitutional referen­dum in 2000. 
The charges "are an act of desperation," Madhuku said. "If they were convinced of winning the election. they would not do this." 
The charges against Tsvangirai stemmed from several meetings he had with a Canadian consulting firm that was secretly working for the government. 
In a videotaped meeting, repeatedly broadcast on Zimbabwean state television, Tsvangirai and the consul­tants discussed Mugabe's "elimination." 
Police say Ncube and Gasela accompanied Tsvangirai to earlier meetings with the consultants. Tsvangirai denied plotting Mugabe's assassination and said he had only planned to hire the firm as lobbyists. He said the snippets of video shown on television had been taken out of context. 
The charges came amid a bitter and violent election campaign that poses the greatest threat to Mugabe's rule since he led the nation to independence in 1980. 
Even before the charges, many Zimbabweans had given up hope for a fair poll after nearly two years of vio lence and intimidation, main­ly blamed on ruling party mil­itants. 
Police have banned most opposition rallies, government employees have been appoint­ed election monitors, and army officers have been named to the body supervis­ing the elections. 
State-controlled television and radio, the only sources of news for Zimbabwe's mainly rural population, have pre­sented Mugabe as a liberation hero and Tsvangirai as a ''ter­rorist"and a "tea boy," or ser­vant, for the country's whites and for European powers. 
The state media have given nearly nonstop coverage to the assassination claims since they first surfaced iwo weeks ago. Andrew Moyse, project coordinator of Zimbabwe's Media Monitoring Project, called the coverage a "tidal wave of propaganda." 
"For people who don't have alternative sources of infor­mation, like the rural folk, they are likely to tend to think there is some grain of truth in (the charges)," he said. 
The United States and Britain have condemned the treason allegations. 
"Coming just days before the presidential elections, it looks like yet another attempt by the Mugabe regime to obstruct the conduct of the election and the ability of the people of Zimbabwe to choose, freely and fairly, who should lead them," British Foreign Minister Jack Straw said Monday.

Tunnel under U.S. embassy inspected 
Associated Press 

ROME 
U.S. security experts descended into a tunnel under a street flank­ing the American Embassy on Tuesday to inspect a stretch of 
underground Rome marked on a 
map found during a probe of sus­pected terrorists. 
Flashlights in hand and wearing white baggy protective jumpsuits, the experts-two from the State Department and a third from the 
U.S. Embassy-climbed down a manhole on Via Boncompagni, just off the fashionable Via Veneto. 
With police deployed in the street, Italian paramilitary Carabinieri police joined the American inspectors in the tun­nel, which carries electricity and telephone lines to the embassy compound and other nearby buildings. 
In raids this month on the out­skirts in Rome, Italian police picked up eight Moroccans, most of them illegal immigrants, and seized nearly nine pounds of a chemical compound containing cyanide. 
Also found were a tourist map of Rome with the embassy circled and a map of utility lines running through tunnels under streets near the embassy, U.S. officials said. 
Also circled on the utility-line maps were the locations of pipes carrying water to the embassy, although these pipes lie several yards from the tunnel inspected Tuesday. 
Of particular interest was near­ly 2-foot-high breach someone had made in the top-of a thick concrete wall that divides the tun­nel from the next stretch of tun­nel. 
Italian news reports have said the hole is suspicious because it was chiseled out after the last regular inspection by city work­ers. But embassy officials have said it is possible the hole simply wasn't noticed previously. 
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday that the experts "found nothing that would lead them to believe the hole was connected to terrorism." 
Any link to terrorism was "very speculative," Boucher said. While the inspection found "nothing sig­nificant," he added that "we are at the early stage of looking at this and we should not speculate." 
Earlier, an embassy statement said: "It would be premature at this time to draw any conclusions about this matter, which is still under investigatfon." 
~Q!P~:~~s~~.fll't:/1~~,a/~rii 

Carabinieri Col. Gianfranco Cavallo said Italian police would continue to study the tunnel for the next few days. He said it was too soon to say when the hole was made. U.S. officials have also described the Italian investigation as so far coming up with only "circumstantial evidence" that a plot was being hatched to attack the embassy. Italian news reports have said the purported plotters might have been trying to poison the Americans' water supply. 
The State Department experts came to Rome last weekend after news of the hole came out. They made no comment as they headed back inside the embassy. On Tuesday, a judge in Reggio Calabria, in southern Italy, ruled that a ninth Moroccan suspect should remain under arrest there while the probe continues. 
In the ruling, Judge Angelina Bandiera said Mohamed Ikbal was suspected of participating in a "terrorism association specifi­cally constituted to carry out acts of violence. even indiscriminate violence," the Italian news agency ANSA reported. 
Italian news reports have said the Moroccans are believed to be part of an Algerian-based group linked to Osama bin Laden's ter­rorist network. 
Seven Tunisians arrested last year in Milan are also allegedly members of the same organiza­tion, the Salafist Group for Call and Combat. 
Four of the Tunisians were con­victed this month of being part of a criminal association that tried to obtain explosives. chemicals and arms. The trial of the other three continued Tuesday in Milan.

Army training game turns deadly 
. Police deputy mistaken, shoots green beret 
Associated Prcss 
ELDORADO, N.C. 

The Special Forces troops are led blindfolded into a forest cave. Their eyes are uncovered, and they see a flickering candle jutting from a human skull. 
Standing before them is Col. 

Tomcat, the deposed ruler of 
war torn Pineland. The troops 
have been told he is a mean 
alcoholic, a soldier who takes 
no prisoners. He is the man they 
have been sent in to restore to 
power. 
But "Pineland" is really a swath of North Carolina back­woods, and some of the forces Tomcat and his men will face are just local farmers, librarians and forklift operators playing assigned roles. 
The game, called Robin Sage, is the 19-day final exam stand­ing between Army soldiers and the coveted green beret. 
The Army strives mightily for realism, with soldiers trained to treat every person they encounter as part of the maneu­ver. 
And that is apparently what got a soldier killed last week­end. The soldier was shot to death after tangling with a deputy sheriff who apparently did not realize it was all a game. 
"Everybody was taking it seri­ously," says the colonel, aka Tommie Cato, a former Marine and one of the soldiers' trainers. "It was supposed to have been." 
Moore County Deputy Randall Butler was patrolling a country road Saturday when he spotted a pickup truck with three men in it. All three were wearing civilian clothes; Butler was sus­picious because one of the men was riding in the truck bed in 40-degree weather. 
Butler pulled the truck over and noticed a duffel bag with a disassembled M-4 rifle inside. 
When one of the three men in the truck came at him, Butler tried pepper spray. When the attack continued, Butler opened fire. 
First Lt. Tallas Tomeny was killed. Sgt. Stephen Phelps is listed in fair condition. The civil­ian driver, who has not been identified, was unharmed. 
Local and Army officials call it a tragic breakdown in commu­nications and say no charges will be filed. 
Military officials from Fort Bragg say they did not notify Moore County officials of the exercise because they figured they would not be involved. 
But locals are having a hard time understanding how the deputy couldn't have known the exercise was going on -and why the soldiers let things get so out of hand. 
In "Pineland," the 4,500­square-mile staging area that covers much of eastern North Carolina's rural sandhills, Confederate flags compete with American ones and camouflage seems the unofficial native dress. 
It is not uncommon to round a curve and find men with M-16s blocking a bridge. 
Area police have been known to take part in the Green Beret training exercise, setting up roadblocks so commandos can stage running gun battles and 
even offer their homes as "safe 
houses" or targets. 
Melinda Cagle, who owns a general store where officers do a lot of their planning, says she is informed by Fort Bragg months in advance of Robin Sage. The origin of the name is unclear, but the area lore is that it is the name of a daughter of a former Special Forces comman­der. 
Locals have become almost inured to the sound of automat­ic weapons fire and small explo­sions from nearby ridges. Raymond Lucas. 85, did not even flinch when a plainclothes soldier walked out of the woods and asked if he could hide out in his basement for an hour or so. 
"We fed him his supper," Lucas says nonchalantly. 
Bruce Reeves remembers doing reconnaissance work for the soldiers as a teenager, scouting dams and other "tar­gets" on his four-wheel­
er. "Everybody was taking continue to its The sol­{the training game] conclusion

traded the civilian 
men some deer meat for a bayonet. 
"They called us indigenous troops," says Reeves, 31. 
But the soldiers also know that every local contact is a potential trap. 
Once, Cato had his daughter and a girlfriend dress in shorts and stand by the side of a road he knew the soldiers would be using. Cato and his troops had pushed the girls' car into a ditch and were hoping the opposing force would take the bait. 
They did. 
"We confiscated everything and drove off and left them," says Cato, who has played the role of area commander for 11 years. 
Such a lapse, or a combina­tion of them, on the part of a trainee can lead to failing the exercise and being forced to take it again.

in 1977 and has since taken part in two dozen exercises as an instructor. 

As realistic as things could seem sometimes, Squier says a stark line was drawn at causing actual physical injury. Soldiers received in-depth training on how to know things were out of control, he says, and pepper spray in the face should have been a warning to the soldiers that the line had been crossed. 
"I would have put my hands on my head and told him, '"Look, let's stop right here,"' says Squier, a veterans services officer. "Thev had to realize that he was a real deputy." 
In all the years he took part in Robin Sage, Squier says, the worst incidents were honor code violations: wives trying to sneak food to their husbands, soldiers stealing food off peo­ple's porches or trying to bum a hot shower and warm bed for the night. 
For now, the

clothes, and 

civilian law officers will not take part in role-playing exercises. 
Also, military officials will have face-to-face meetings with local law enforcement in areas where training is going to occur. 
An Army internal investiga­tion of last weekend's shooting could suggest more changes, officials say. 
At the country store down in Eldorado, Reeves can already imagine the clamor to end the exercises. 
He hopes it doesn't come to that: He and others take pride in knowing that they helped prepare some of the soldiers who are fighting terrorism in Afghanistan. 
"This is real important for these guys. It's important to all ofus, actually," he says. 
"Because they're the ones going out there and putting themselves in harm's way, and it's pretty serious business if you ask me. I took it serious." 
Witness testifies Yates was insane 
Associated Press 

HOUSTON 
Andrea Yates suffered from schizophrenia and didn't know right from wrong when she drowned her five children in the bathtub in June, a psycholo­gist testified Tuesday at her capital murder trial. 
"Mrs. Yates was severely ill and in the course of an acute psychotic episode," Dr. George Ringholz said in his second day on the wit­ness stand. "She did not know the actions she took on that day were wrong." 
Ringholz, a neuropsychol­ogist from Baylor College of Medicine testifying for the defense, said his determina­tion was based on research culled from her medical and family history and tests he conducted on the 37-year­old woman. 
The testimony of Ringholz is key to the defense, which must convince jurors Yates was insane when her chil­dren were drowned one by one on June 20. Prosecutors argue Yates was sane at the time of the killings. 
Yates is on trial for two counts of capital murder. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the deaths of 7-year-old Noah, 5-year­old John and 6-month-old Mary. Charges eventually could be filed in the deaths of Paul, 3, and Luke, 2. 
On Monday, Ringholz said Yates's schizophrenia began during childhood and sur­faced initially after giving birth to her first son, Noah, in 1994 when she consid­ered grabbing a knife and stabbing the child. 
Yates told him she felt Satan's presence shortly after Noah's birth and "heard Satan's voice tell her to pick up the knife and stab the child," Ringholz said. 
The symptoms of the schizophrenia didn't resur­face until Yates' fourth son. Luke, was born in 1999. Medical records show that Yates attempted suicide twice that year. 
Jurors were told the men­tal illness is characterized by a significant impairment in functioning and symp­toms like delusions, halluci­nations. incoherence and isolation. 
Defense attorney Wendell Odom asked Ringholz if Yates had ever been diag­nosed with schizophrenia before. 
"Not that I'm aware of," Ringholz testified. 
Earlier Monday, Dr. Melissa Ferguson, who interviewed the Houston mother in jail the day after her children were drowned, said Yates considered stab­bing her five children but decided it was too bloody and that drowning was a bette,r way to end their lives.

ISRAEL 
Sharon willing to meet with Saudi officials 
. Saudi plan calls for full peace, full withdrawl 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM 

Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told an EU envoy Tuesday he was willing to meet Saudi offi­cials, publicly or behind the scenes, to explore their propos­als for an overall Mideast peace, the European diplomat said. 
-The proposals floated by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah have gotten a warm response from the Palestinians, some Arab nations and some Israeli otlicials -including the foreign and defense ministers. Sharon's aides, however, say they want more details. 
Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign affairs chief. announced that he was making a previously unscheduled trip to Riyadh on Wednesday to hear details of the Saudi peace plan firsthand from Abdullah. 
President Bush "praised the idea," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Tuesday, but he said the Saudi prince's pro­posal was not a breakthrough. 
Israeli officials said at this point, the initiative had not for­mally been placed on the table by the Saudis. The outlines of the plan were first disclosed in a column in The New York Times by Thomas Friedman after an interview with Abdullah in Saudi Arabia. 
According to the Friedman report, the entire Arab world would make peace with the Jewish state if it withdrew from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem -land captured leader George Mitchell. in the 1967 Mideast War. "It doesn't, in and of itself,

Linkage year, they become Holy Cross students," Nolan said. "As such, when they apply for transfer admission to Saint Mary's, they will be evaluated by the Saint Mary's Admission Committee under the terms of the articulation agreement." 
The agreement is a help to admission counselors because it lists what Holy Cross course may be transferred and gives a clearer direction to students who wish to transfer. The Saint Mary's admission office will provide materials such as the college bulletin and will schedule meetings with prospective students and with faculty to provide information regarding transfer opportuni­ties.

End the corrupt regime of Grab 'n' Go 
I've held ouL for a long time, but I want to incite a food revolution. 
When Iwalk into South Dining Hall's Grab 'n' Go room. I feel like a weary nomad stumbling upon a bountiful oasis after years of wan­dering the desert.

Fitter,
snack food lines the shelves. Is today a Happier ... 
Sour Cream n' Onion day, or a Tangy Cheese day? Either way, I can't lose. 
At North, however, I face a limited number of snacks. I bitterly remember days when, trying to instill a new consci­entiousness for my health, I wanted pret­zels but had to go with greasy corn chips or cheese popcorn. Beware ofthe cheese popcorn -it's a veritable heart attack in a bag. 
At South, the coolers are stocked with dozens of fine sandwiches, which I am allowed to browse with impunity. If upon hefting the roast beef and cheddar I decide that turkey on wheat is more my taste, r can replace the sandwich and choose a new one. I can even select the choicest turkey sandwich of the bunch, opting for one without that weird lun­cheon meat slime, if I can find one, that is. 
Compared to South, the sandwich sys­tem at North represents nothing less than outright tyranny.ram required to select the name of my entree from a sometimes barely legible menu on a marker board, often under pressure from my fellow stu­
dents and the lunchroom attendant. 

If Iorder peanut butter and jelly and the attendant snatches the sloppiest sand­wich in the cooler for me -I trust you know what r mean -the sandwiches with goopy peanut butter oozing out of the bun and moreover you just know the jelly is going to slime out when you take a bite -what should I do? Tell them I want a sandwich with less nastiness? I hardly think so. The attendants work hard, and they probably dislike the system a.c; much as rdo. 
Perhaps the most startling aspect of Grab 'n' Go at South is the fresh fruit and pastry section. What wild and exotic fruits appear before me! Plwns, pears and kiwis are established regulars in South's fruit stand, while over at North a meager, dusty pear occasionally makes a cameo showing. 
At South, bagels, cookies and delicious fresh-baked pastries spill out of the rustic bins. But look closer. I have seen up to four varieties of bagel, rice crispics treats and cookie bars while North's tiny bagel bowl and shelf of hockey puck cookies pale in comparison. 
From this briefsummary ofgrievances. anyone can see the woeful inequality between North and South Grab 'n' Go. I have often imagined that South Dining Hall is better stocked with food and drink because it is the food service's mother ship, while North has become a mere satellite cafeteria. What is to be done? Why not simply transport more goods to North? I will personally volunteer to carry a box of potato chips or a crate of fruit from South to North, if that's what it 
takes. 
But I've got bigger fish to fry. I wonder who established the magic number of four sides and one sandwich for Grab 'n' Go. Why four? Four was a very important number for ancient Mediterranean cul­tures. but r seriously doubt that explana­tion. ls it some kind of sick reference to the food groups? "Let's see, a milk for dairy, a juice box for fruit, a cereal con­tainer for grains, a bag of nacho cheese chips for a second dairy and a turkey wrap for meat and, hey, there's even some lettuce in here." The Grab 'n' Go diet is not healthy, and I don't recom­mend supporting oneself on it for extend­ed time periods. 
Now imagine the same meal supple­mented with extra pieces of fruit. a bagel or a yogurt and one of those midget water bottles. Sounds good. right? Maybe not, but it certainly represents a leap in the right direction. Maybe sometime in the distant future, when the historical condi­tions align themselves, the great unwashed mass of Grab 'n' Go regulars will rise up and overthrow the corrupt regime. So keep shrinking the juice boxes. capitalist swine. You sow the seeds of your own doom.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The price of my dream, and yours 
Carl Brashear had to wait outside the gate of Navy Diving School quite a while. The sentry had refused him an entry. 
An African-American by birth, Brashear had grown up in a very poor background in the rural South. But right from his childhood he cherished his dream of pursuing a career in the 
U.S. Navv. His dream did become a reali­ty, but he had to face a lot of hurdles because racism was pretty widespread then. 
It was not the Navy he had dreamt of ... until the day he saw Chief Billy Sunday diving into the sea during an underwater operation and ended up attempting to save the lives of a few of 
Sebastian Abraham 
What's My 
Shade? 

his drowning compatriots. Brashear knew then that deep-sea salvage diving was "the call" of his life. He decided to ask for a transfer to the Navy Diving School. Though his commanding officer was pretty sure that an African-American wouldn't be permitted inside the school in spite of his recommendation, Brashear was determined. And permission was granted. 
At the school, the sentry wouldn't let him in, so the predic­tion of the officer came true. As he was standing outside the gate, an alert Brashear saw a car approaching from the school. Envisaging a senior officer, he readied himself to salute. 
To his surprise he was saluting Chief Billy Sunday. The chief was serving a term as an instructor in the school. He stopped to inquire what brought Brashear to the school. Brashear expressed his desire to become a diver. Chief was more than amused. No African-American had ever gone beyond a particular rank in the Navy, let alone become a diver. 
The chief asked him to return from where he came. While the chief thought that he had given his piece of advice to the young man and had gone his way, Brashear stood there. He couldn't feel the sweat trickling from his brow; his knee wouldn't tire of standing. All he knew was that he wanted to become a diver and that only joining the school would take him to his goal. 
The day was done but he stood. The chief returned to the gate after his long trip. Brashear showed no sign of fatigue as he saluted him cheerfully -and he continued to stand. Seeing a determination of rare kind, Chief was left with no choice but to ask the sentry to let Brashear in. 
Like Brashear, my goals cannot be redirected, controlled or altered by circumstances or people -unless I let them do so. In that sense the control of my destiny lies in my hands. While most people think that a lot of things in our lives depend on others and circumstances and some even go to the extent of believing in fate, in actuality a huge amount depends on me. While I am approaching my goal the key question to ask myself is: Do I lose focus when I encounter hurdles? 
While l face obstacles, can I maintain the same spirit (to achieve the goal) as when I began? If need be, am I ready to re-charge myself? 
If a hindrance can stop you from pursuing your goals then perhaps you didn't want to achieve it badly enough. Criticizing the circumstances, fate or people involved would be the cheapest and least effective resort to reach the goal. It is in my hand not to let anyone's remark or action direct my move. I know my path and I will walk it come what may. 
The primary criteria to achieve anything in this world is whether you want it badly enough and whether you are pre­pared to pay the price. 
I was inspired to write this article after seeing the movie "Men Of Honor" directed by George Tillman Jr. It presents the real~life story of Carl Brashear, the first African­American, deep-sea salvage diver in the history of the U.S. Navy. Amidst racism, military bureaucracy and losing his leg Brashear braved his way to show that you can achieve your dream if you want it badly enough and if you are ready to pay the price.

Unilateralism handicaps 
U. S. foreign policy 
In his Monday column, Mike Marchand assaults Europeans for their concern over President Bush's "axis of evil" statement during his State of the Union address. The statement resonated with the American public because of the obviousness of the repressive regimes that currently control those nations. 
The complaints of the United States' European allies stem not from a disagreement over the relative nature of evil but over the approach to be taken in ending that evil. While certainly ~

Their complaints about American unilat­eralism and oversimplifi­cation of foreign policy not only are justified, but also should be reiterated and reviewed by Americans. The failure to integrate our efforts and policies with allies across the globe can lead to failure not only in Afghanistan but also in our efforts to reduce the "axis of evil." It is impossible for the United States to implement its long-term policy goals without the support of our allies in Asia and Europe. 
This was all too evident in the president's visit to Asia. During his visit, Bush assured Koreans that his statements did not forecast war and that he supported the engagement or "sunshine" policy of Kim Dae Jung. Shortly after these statements. Bush arrived in Beijing, 
which surprisingly escaped participa­tion in the "axis of evil" despite its record of human rights 
abuses. political and reli­gious oppression and aggressive mili­
tarism. Marchand and Bush have seemingly for­gotten the downing of an American surveillance aircraft less than one year ago. 
By mocking and belit­tling the contribu­tion of the 
Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos 
and Europeans in the global 
fight against terrorism and evil, Marchand 
and other propo­nents of prideful American unilateral­ism utterly fail to under­stand the reality of global politics and history. We have 

won few wars without allies and have lost a few when our allies failed to support us. Evil exists far beyond the axis that bears its name and United States foreign policy requires allies to defeat it.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Seek a truly open mind 
Have you ever had the feeling that you're being discriminated against by a person who is pro­claiming his or her open-mindedness? 
Jesse Daniel Schomer in his letter Friday enti­tled, "Agree to disagree," implies that all Catholics are closed-minded in his statement. "What I would like to see is Catholics trying to understand those other viewpoints before they start into the dogmat­ic criticism." I will gladly call myself a Catholic and in fact am a theology major. I am also a feminist and I do not find these two aspects of myself oxy­moronic. 
I too gave up cootie shots and ghost stories as a child, and quite frankly I am proud to state that I will never cease to have fun on a swing set -and I question its relevance to Sclwmer's argument. 
My faith neither suggests that I am superstitious, nor does it entail that I have the intellectual devel­opment of a child. l feel extremely insulted by these assertions. In Mr. Schomer's broad general­izations, he has excluded while he proclaims to include. He also clutters his argument with affronts that anger more than they provoke thought. 
Before Schomer labels me a "knee-jerk conserv­ative," however, I would also like to respond to Peter Zavodnyik's letter on Friday entitled, '"Free speech limited."' I reject the notion that "The Vagina Monologues" are a "carnival act" and have purchased tickets for one of the performances. Like Schomer, whom he appears to contrast, Zavodnyik implies that all who will attend are chil­dren, although he does so in a slightly subtler manner. 
That the University can with any certainty deter­mine what will "expose students only to paths that lead them to understand themselves, their world and their maker" seems dubious at best. In addi­tion, I would argue that the Monologues do aid in an increased self-understanding, both for men and for women. Scripture states that God created man and woman in God's image and likeness. In an increased sensitivity toward what it is to be a woman, one can gain a greater understanding of the divine and who God created all of us to be.

Scene Writer 

The Not-So-Royal Shakespeare Company's production of "The History of King Henry IV, part I," will change the mind of anyone who believes that Notre Dame lacks cul­ture. The entirely student-run play offers a welcome interpretation of Shakespeare's classic history. 
Re-founded in 1993 as an effort to bring Shakespeare to the Notre Dame student body, the NSRSC has built strong support and appeal, regularly selling out its shows and gaining support from student gov­ernment. 
"We want to be as loyal to Shakespeare as possible in the text," stage manager Lindsay Updike said. "But Not-So-Royal is also intent on giving its shows a lot of energy and attitude." 
The play follows two plots: one concerning the strained relation­ship between King Henry IV and his son Prince Hal (the future Henry V) and the other concerning the rebellion spear­

In the begin­ning of the show, Prince Hal has taken up a lifestyle of vice hardly befitting his royal status. Ile drinks in a mangy tavern filled with highway robbers and criminals. Falstaff. one of the regulars, evolves into a father figure for Hal; he also provides a great deal of the play' s comic relief, often making light of his obesity. FalstafT's lifestyle, how­ever, appalls Hal's real father. 
King I lenry IV wants to reform his son so he can follow in the path of his ancestors. Ilis desire strength­ens as a new crisis forms with the Percy f'amily that was largely responsible !'or King Henry IV's ascension to the throne. The king refuses to ransom one of' his lords captured in battle, Mortimer, whom he believes is a traitor for marrying into the family of' the Welsh rebel leader, Owen Glendower (played by sophomore Justin Williams). 
Mortimer's cousin, the youthful and up-and-coming Henry Percy, who is also called "Harry" or "Hotspur," is beguiled by his uncle, the treacherous Worcester (played by freshman Ellen Kennedy) into joining forces with Glendower in opposition to the king. 
Hotspur's quick temper provides a daunting and powerful challenge to the throne. He attacks the king's forces and a final confrontation between Hotspur and Hal ensues. 
The stand-out technical side of the production provides a sense of renewal to the timeless play. The characters adorn contemporary costumes that break from the grandiosity of the period in which Shakespeare initially wrote the play, but they connect the audience to the story surprisingly well. The set design also follows this trend. 
"We were going for something simple but effective, wanting the set to bring out the intensity of each individual scene," Updike said. 
A single throne is present for vir­tually every scene, drawing atten­tion to the power struggle that tran­
scends both 
plotlines.

The true source of delight in "Henry IV," is the splendid acting from both the principle and sup­porting cast members. The four most complex characters, King Henry, Prince Hal, Falstaff and Iiotspur. function to tie the text into a masterpiece on stage. 
King Henry IV (played by senior JJ Marler) is a static force that is torn between the conflicts facing his kingdom and his relationship between himself and Prince Hal. At times, he can retain his composure and provide a firm but rational response or course of action to his visitors. However, his son pushes him to the edge as the reign of his dynasty is at stake. 
"The King wants to show Hal the nature of a leader," Marler said. "His biggest problem isn't llotspur.

but his strained relationship with his son." 
Marler keenly plays up the harsh confrontation between the king and the prince. The powerful scene rips at the audience's emotions as the two forces struggle to coexist. 
Prince Hal (played by junior Chris Nygren) is the young man strug­gling between his inevitable reign and youthful urge to enjoy life to its fullest. 
"Hal is the paradigm of any 20­something," Nygren said. "He's going through the process of matu­ration, struggling to assert himself, but because he's royalty, the strug­gle is even more intense." 
Truly, Hal knows where he is and where he will be, so his only outlet is rebellion and the domain of the tavern. Nygren has other opinions regarding the character, particular­ly when he realizes the gravity of his unruly behavior. 
"A lot of people try to present Hal as heroic, but he feels as much anguish as anyone because of his lifestyle," Nygren said.

I<'ederico performs Falstaff's ensuing expla­nation of the events with a twisted rendition of the story. The charac­ter also competes as the father fig­ure of Hal, who requires a guiding force in whichever lifestyle he chooses. Falstaff remains true to the prince through the last battle. 
"He's lovable hut also keeps a lot of vices," Federico said. 
Hotspur {played by sophomore Adel Ilanash) is perhaps the most complex character in the play. He initially appears to be hot-tempered and a clear antagonist in the story, but his nature is wider. His view of the world is terribly idealistic, but he recognizes his fault. 
''I've fallen in love with the char­acter because he's so real. so essentially human," 1-lanash said. "I vvanted to bring out his innocence because i1 's very easy to play him as fiery, but that takes away from his essence." 
Bringing every element together was the show's director, junior Dan Fisher. His intricate vision for the play was fully understood by every cast member. 
"A good director knows what he wants but lets it evolve and get bet­ter and that's what Fisher did," Hanash said. 
Fisher had equal praise for the cast. 
"They're all young, but they offer a degree of professionalism that is very reassuring and helpful for the creative process," Fisher said. 
With an immense understanding of the text, Fisher sought out to rep­resent the central ideas of the play. 
"The lines between good and evil are nebulous and virtue is defined by each of the individual charac­ters, so there's an element of ambi­guity that speaks of all humanity," Fisher said. "If you hold a mirror up to nature, as this play does, you will see that idealism doesn't always win in the end."

FROM THOUGHT TO FINISH.TM 
Notre Dame was out of its offense early in the first half, dropping to a seven-point lead after three consecutive Irish turnovers. They went into the locker-rooms at halftime with a one-point lead and they waited. 
"They're incredibly patient and they're smart," McGraw said after the game. "They don't beat themselves ... They shoot the ball extremely well from the three-point line ... They're just really disci­plined." 
In the second half, the Irish had their chance. 
They took an early lead in the second half but in the final minutes of the game, Villanova snuck op and took that lead away. It was Riley again who gave Villanova the chances it needed to get ahead, hitting four shots in the last four min­

utes. 
The Irish didn't take advan­tage of their chances. The Irish missed five shots and only hit two of the six shots they had from the foul line. 
Then, in the final seconds, Villanova made gave itself one more chance and Notre Dame watched its final chance blow away. 
With 13 seconds left, just as the shot-clock ran out, Riley grabbed a key rebound to give the Wildcats one more chance to win the game. After she missed a one-and-one, Flecky grabbed the rebound for the Irish and they had their last chance. 
And they only got one. 
The seconds ticked away and the Irish couldn't get the ball to their 3-point shooters. With 
1.3 seconds left McGraw called a time-out and stopped the clock. But it was too late for her team to take more than one shot. ­
They had one chance at a 3­pointer to tie the game and they missed. 
"I thought they key at the end was the rebound they got," McGraw said. "They have one second to get a shot and they get the offensive rebound." 
The Wildcats got a second chance on that rebound and made sure the Irish did not.

In a game that featured nine lead changes and six ties, Notre Dame looked like it could pull it out until the game's final minutes. A Ratay lay-in with 5:24 remaining put the home team up 43-40, before Riley's lay-in pulled the Wildcats within one.

Bushey earns honors 
Giambi, White 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Da.me senior tri-cap­tain Andrew Bushey has been honored as the Big East Conference baseball player of the week, after bat­ting 6-for-9 in last weekend's action at t h e University of New Orleans Classic. 
Bushey, who start­ed at both catcher and third base during the tournament, collected his six hits against Missouri and hosL UNO before missing the Southern Illinois game due to an injury. His many stellar defensive plays included a strong throw to nail an attempted basestealer in the UNO game. 


Bushey became the eighth Notre Dame player in the eight-year Paul Mainieri era to post five-plus hits in a game, batting 5-for-5 in the heart­breaking 8-7 loss to the host Privateers . He hit a first-pitch double to right-center in the 2nd inning of that game before stroking an RBI single up the middle in the 4th for a 3-3 tie. Bushey then greeted reliever Brandon Migues in the 6th with a leadoff home run, tying the game at 4-4 by driving a 1-1 pitch over the rightfield fence his first home run since 2000 and the sixth of his career (he also homered in a game at UNO in 1999, as part of ND's record-tying seven-HR output). 
His big game versus UNO also included a leadoff single through the left side in the 8th and a 1-1 single to left-center in the 9th. plating Kris Billmaier for a 7-5 lead. 
The 5-10, 190-pound left-
handed hitter is one of four current members of the Notre Dame baseball program who

have been named Big East 
player of the week during the past three seasons, with the others including: senior cen­terfielder Steve Stanley jl!nior leftfielder Brian Stavisky and senior catcher Paul O'Toole. 
Bushey's breakthrough 2001 season saw him earn 1st team all-Big East honors as a third baseman, after batting .335 with 36 RBI and 17 doubles. He also ranked second among all 2001 Big East players with 
a .425 conference batting average and 27 RBI in confer­ence games. 
Bushey has appeared in 162 career games as a four-year starter with the Irish. with his career stats including 169 hits, 36 doubles, 73 RBI and 51 walks. He averaged 17.58 at-bats per strikeout as a sophomore in 2000, represent­ing the 10th-best ratio at Notre Dame since 1969.

The New York Yankees welcomed back one expensive free agent on Tuesday and 
almost  immediately  lost  
another.  
First  baseman  Jason  

Giambi, nursing a sore left hamstring, missed his second straight intrasquad game but took part in pregame drills. He is expected to play in an exhibition game either Friday or Saturday. 
"It feels a lot better today," said Giambi, who signed a seven-year, $120 million con­tract in the offseason. 'Tm trying to be on the safe side and not overdo it. We just want to keep it getting bet­ter." 
Just as Giambi returned to work, Yankees outfielder Rondell White strained his left Halladay to start the first four games of the spring. 
"You can read anything you want into it," Martinez said. "It just sets up that way, that's the way we're going to start the spring. These guys have all thrown well and we 're anxious to see them on the mound against other teams." 
The Atlanta Braves are try­ing to sort out a crowd at first base. The incumbent is Julio Franco but Wes Helms is bid­ding for playing time wtth 
B.J. Surhoff. 
"I'm going to show the Braves I can start at first base, and they will feel com­fortable with me there," said Helms, who hit only .222 in his rookie season last year with the Braves. "That's what I'm going to do."

"I think we'll homers know tomor­Yankees first baseman and 11 
row," Torre said. "A rib cage [injury]. it really shuts you down. It eliminates throwing and swinging." 
White, who signed a $10 million, two-year deal, has been on the disabled list eight times during his major league career. and has played in just 189 games the past three sea­sons. 
In Haines City, Fla., the Royals said outfielder Mark Quinn probably will open the season on the disabled list because of a cracked rib that will sideline him for 4-to-6 weeks. 
"He told me he fell back up against an edge of a chair," general manager Allard Baird said. "Obviously, it is very frustrating for the kid." 
Spring training has barely begun but new Houston Astros manager Jimy Williams already has set his pitching rotation. 
Williams picked 16-game winner Wade Miller as his opening day pitcher against the Milwaukee Brewers on April 2. Miller led the Astros in victories, starts (32). innings (212) and strikeouts 
(183) last season. He finished with a 3.40 ERA and pitched six or more innings in 28 of his 32 starts. 
Behind Miller, the Astros will use right-handers Roy Oswalt, Shane Reynolds and Dave Mlicki. Carlos Hernandez and Tim Redding will compete for the fifth spot with Hernandez set to start the exhibition opener Friday. 
Toronto manager Buck Martinez won't commit to a rotation yet except to say Roy Halladay will get the start against the Yankees on Friday with Chris Peters, Scott Eyre and Bob File fol­lowing him. 
Right-handers Brandon Lyon, Chris Carpenter and Luke Prokopec with follow RBIs in 
2 5 games. Surhoff, playing left field, batted .271 last season with 10 homers and 58 RBIs. He has been shunted to a backup role after the Braves acquired Gary Sheffield and Vinny Castilla and moved Chipper Jones from third to left. 
Helms had only two at-bats in September -a walk and a strikeout. 
"I don't look at numbers," he said. "I go out there to play hard and help the team win. Hitting 10 home runs with 36 RBIs in 200 (216 to be exact) at bats, you can't complain with that. Average­wise, I don't look at the aver­age because I didn't play every day. I know when I do 
play every day and get in a groove, I'll do better than that." . 
The Los Angeles Dodgers are looking forward to the arrival ofstandout Texas run­ning back Cedric Benson, who is ready for some baseball. 
Benson, the Big 12 Conference offensive fresh­man of the year last season when he gained 1,053 yards and scored 12 touchdowns, will play in the Los Angeles Dodgers' minor league orga­nization this summer. 
"He'll come in here mid­March, whenever spring break is, just spend a couple days, maybe suit up," Bill Bavasi, the Dodgers' director of player development, said Tuesday. "He'll be back to play in mid-May, whenever school's out. He'll be with us until early August, when he reports to Texas' football training camp." 
Benson batted .361 with four home runs and 14 RBIs in his senior year of high school. The Dodgers drafted him in the 12th round ­

Underdog Miami tops Boston College 
Associaced Press 
CORAL GABLES, Fla. 

Miami's Sheila James blocked a 3-point attempt by Amber Jacobs with six sec­onds remaining, and the Hurricanes held on to upset No. 18 Boston College 60-57 Tuesday night. 
James, who scored only five points, made two free throws with 4. 9 seconds left after Jacobs made one of two foul shots to bring the Eagles within 58-57. 
Clare Droesch missed a desperation 30-footer for Boston College. 
Kathryn Fowler had 11 points and nine rebounds for Miami (.17-10, 10-6 Bi.I{ East) Meghan Saake added 10 points and five steals, giving her a school-record 110 for the season. 
Jacobs had 15 points and Kim Mackie 13 points and 10 rebounds for Boston College (21-6. 12-4). 
The win was Miami's third over a ranked opponent this season. 
Rachel Byars hit a layup with 17:08 left to start a 15-5 Boston College run to a 43­38 lead. But the Hurricanes countered with a 6-0 run to take the lead with 12 :02 remaining. 
Then there were five ties and eight more lead changes. 
No. 1 Connecticut 89 West Virginia 60 
Asjha Jones scored 17 points as No. 1 Connecticut secured its third unbeaten regular season in eight years with a victory over West Virginia. 
Swin Cash had 16 points and 13 rebounds for Connecticut (30-0, 16-0 Big East), which put the Mountaineers away with an 18-0 run midway through the second half. 
Maria Conlon added 14 points for Connecticut. Diana Taurasi and Jessica Moore each scored 11 points, and Sue Bird added 10. 
Sherell Sowho scored 22 points and Yolanda Paige had 18 for West Virginia (14-13, 6-10), which has dropped 11 straight games to Connecticut. 
The last time the Huskies came to Morgantown two years ago, West Virginia absorbed the second-worst defeat in league history, 100­28. 
Things were different this time. The pregame rifle shot by the Mountaineer mascot that rattled the UConn play­ers wasn't the only surpr.ise. 
Having tucked away its ninth straight Big East title and owning the top seed in next week's league tourna­ment, Connecticut allowed West Virginia to keep the score respectable for much of the game. 
The Mountaineers, who had been outscored by a 3-1 mar­gin in its three previous meetings with Connecticut, became the first team in six games to score more than 50 points against the Huskies. 
But West Virginia went scoreless for more than 7 minutes in the second half while ~,mlin hit a pair of 3­pointers and a layup during the decisive run for a 78-48 lead with 6:56 remaining. 
Connecticut didn't take the lead for good until Conlin made a 3-pointer with 12:32 left in the first half, giving the Huskies a 17-14 lcad. 
West Virginia kept the score close until it began to force shots, and Connecticut used a 14-3 run late in the first half to build a lead that didn't fall below double dig­its again. 
The Mountaineers scored as many points in the first half as they did in a 97-34 loss to Connecticut last sea­son. 
No. 13 Texas 61 
Kansas 46 
Stacy Stephens had 16 points and 10 rebounds as No. 13 Texas beat Kansas, making the Jayhawks the first Big 12 team to go win­less in the conference. 
The most recent victory by Kansas (5-24, 0-16) was Dec. 29 against Morgan State. Marion Washington, 15th all­time among women coaches with 540 wins, is having her worst season in 29 years with the Jayhawks, who have lost 16 straight games. 
Texas (19-8, 10-6). which lost four straight games at midseason, has won five of its last six. Included were victories over third-ranked Tennessee and No. 5 Oklahoma. 
Tia Dillard had 12 of her career-high 15 points in the first half, but Texas led only 28-26 at the break. But the Longhorns wasted little time establishing dominance in the second half, posting an early 13-2 run. 
Stephens recorded her 13th double-double of the season, and her league-leading 10th double-double in Big 12 play. 
The last Big 12 team to go winless in conference play was Iowa State which went 0-14 in 1983-84 in the defunct Big Eight. 
No. 11 Colorado 84 Nebraska 60 
Jenny Roulier scored 17 points, and No. 11 Colorado hit eight of its first nine shots for a 22-4 start in a victory over Nebraska in the final regular-season Big 12 game for both. · 
Colorado (21-8, 11-5) also got 16 points from Mandy Nightingale, 13 points and 10 rebounds from Tera Bjorkland and 10 points from Eisha Bohman. 
Nebraska (12-13, 4-12) put together an 8-0 run to cut the Colorado lead to 2 2-16 on Greichaly Cepero's jumper with 11 :05 left in the half. But the Buffs held the Cornhuskers to just one more basket the rest of the half and led 46-18 at the break. 
Colorado shot 68 percent in the first half to just 26 per­cent for Nebraska. The Buffaloes outrebounded the Huskers 23-7 during the half. The Buffaloes cooled off a lit­tle in the second half, but Nebraska got no closer than 19 points.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
East Carolina topples No. 46 Marquette 
Associated Press 
GREENVILLE, N.C. It looks like March Madness is starting a few weeks early. 
Ea.st Carolina pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the col­lege basketball season Tuesday night, holding No. 9 Marquette to six points over the final 12 1/2 minutes to stun the Golden Eagles 51-46. 
Marquette (23-5, 12-3 Conference USA) had won 12 straight prior to a last-second loss four days ago to No. 4 Cincinnati. But the heavy underdog Pirates (12-16, 5-10) used a 2-3 zone defense to turn the Golden Eagles' offense into a bunch of jump shooters. 
The East Carolina students stormed the floor after the final buzzer sounded on Senior Day in the first win over a Top Ten team since the program began in 1960. 
Travis Holcomb-Faye was the hero for East Carolina, scoring 12 of his 15 points in the sec­ond half as the Pirates held Marquette to 35 percent shoot­ing in the final 20 minutes. 
Dwyane Wade led the Golden Eagles with 19 points, but he was held to just four in the sec­ond half. Fellow guard Cordell Henry. who was averaging 
19.8 points over his last four games, was 1-for-11 from the field for two points. 
East Carolina never led and fell behind by 12 points with 
12:37 to go before going on an 11-0 run to throw a scare into Marquette. 
Jon Harris then scored on a layup and Odartey Blankson hit a 14-footer on Marquette's next two possessions for some breathing room and it appeared the Golden Eagles would be on their way to a win. 
But Holcomb-Faye hit a 3­pointer and then a runner on the baseline with 4 :29 left to tie it at 44-44 to set the stage for the final few tense minutes. 
The Pirates, who beat Louisville here and played Cincinnati to a 10-point game, didn't back off after the final media timeout. 
Moussa Badiane made a layup and his block of a shot in the lane by Henry led to a fast­break hoop by Kenyatta Brown and the Pirates went up by four. 
Marquette closed to 48-46 with 36 seconds left, but Holcomb-Faye hit a free throw and Badiane pulled down a key rebound after Scott Merritt missed the front end of a 1­and-1 to set up a dunk by Brown to seal it. 
l\farquette hit seven of its first 10 shots over the opening 9:08, but didn't do much the rest of the first half as East Carolina switched to the zone. 
While good on defense. the Pirates managed just nine points in the opening 13 1/2 minutes to fall behind by dou­ble digits before pulling within 27-20 at halftime. 
Wade was 7-for-12 from the field for 15 points while the rest of the Golden Eagles were 5-for-16. 
No. 22 Miami 81 Providence 65 
Darius Rice scored 21 of his 30 points in the second half to lead No. 22 Miami to a victory over Providence. 
Providence point guard John Linehan became the NCAA's career steals leader. His fourth of the game gave him 377, one more than Eric Murdock, who played for the Friars from 1987-91. 
In the final home game of his career, Linehan had all four of his steals in the first half. He finished with 10 points on 2-of­8 shooting.

BENGAL BOUTS 155 POUNDS -160 POUNDS 
Middleweights move to North Dome

By PAUL CAMARATA 
Sports Writer 
On the eve of the Bengal Bout semifinals, roughly a dozen members of the Notre Dame Boxing Club were scattered across the workout room in the basement of the Joyce Center. .lumping rope, shadow boxing and attacking the heavy bags hanging throughout the room, they all tried to polish their technique before their next match-up. 
Of the 133 fighters that began the tournament, only 40 still vie for the championships of their respective weight classes. The semifinal round will again cut that number in half, and send two boxers from each division to the finals Friday night, as the Bouts move from the Joyce Center Fieldhouse to the Arena in the north dome. 
155 Pounds 
The semifinal bracket in the 155-pound division includes the top four seeds in the weight class. Senior captain Brock "Landers" Heckmann will look to keep the momentum he gained over the weekend, when he won two unanimous deci­sions to advance. Heckmann is in search of his second· consec­utive Bengal Bouts champi­onship after winning the 150­pound title last year. 
Wednesday he will face Chris "Third Time's a Charm" Pettit, who is in the midst of the most successful tournament in his three year's of boxing. 
"At this point I feel like I've got nothing to lose. I actually felt less nervous in the quarter finals then I did last Friday," he said Tuesday. "Hopefully [tonight] I'll be even more calm." 
Pettit used an aggressive left hand in his early round victo­ries, both unanimous decisions, but said he hopes to use a more even tempo on Wednesday. 
"When I go in there I have to stay back a little bit more than I have been so I don't get gassed at the end of the third round," Pettit said. " ... Other than that I just have to take advantage when he leaves himself open." 
Heckmann hasn't looked vul­nerable in early rounds, using f1uid footwork to control the pace and movement of his fights. By working his oppo­nents onto the ropes and into the corners, Heckmann has combined mastery of the ring space with strong straight punches to dictate the rhythm of his two fights. 
Sophomore John "The L­Dizzle" Nowak, the second seed in the 155 pound class, used a variety of strong left­handed punches to pound his way through two unanimous decisions into the semifinals over the weekend, Nowak found success in both the pre­liminary and quarterfinals by keeping his shoulders square and utilizing fast hands. His arsenal of lefts includes both a quick hook and a powerful overhand. 
A second-year boxer fighting in the semifinals for the first time, Nowak said he is both excited and anxious about Wednesday night's match up, 
'Tm definitely a bit nervous, because it's farther into the tournament and now I'm fac­ing a better fighter than the last two guys," he said. 
That fighter is Mike "The Militia Man" Melby, a junior second-year boxer who uses his height and long reach to remain on the offensive during his fights. His preliminary round fight was stopped by the referee, who had to issue Melhy's opponent four stand­ing-8 counts. In the quarterfi­nals, Melby threw his long, quick jab in speedy combina­tion with his right hand to score a unanimous decision. 
''I've seen Melby fight, just before me in the prelims and the quarter finals," Nowak said. ''I've never sparred with him before so I just have to go out there and see how it goes. He's a lot taller than me and looks good, but we'll just see what happens." 
160 Pounds 

Chris "Can't We All .Just" Kitalong is a skilled. athletic fighter and the top seed in the 160-pound weight class. Kitalong throws a variety of punches. from a crisp jab to a strong overhand right, and depends on combinations to drive his opponent backwards. 
His barrage of punches in the preliminaries prompted the official to stop the contest 18 seconds into the second round. On Sunday, he scored a unani­mu us decision. Although Kitalong has shown a tendency to fight with his hands lower than it is typically prescribed, his speed and ability to shake off punches have helped him dominate each of his two matches. 
While Kitalong has the rare combination of speed and power that every boxer wants, his opponent, John "The Chris fleid Shamrock Express" Murphy attacks with the fervor that every fighter needs. Murphy, a third-year law stu­dent and native of New Ross, Ireland, says that his nickname is a tribute to his friend Maureen's brother, a former light middleweight who died of cancer last year. 
A fighter without quit, Murphy has disrupted oppo­nents by forcing them to con­tend with his brawling style. Murphy persists in fighting the match along the ropes and on the other boxer's body. a strat­egy that helped him score a unanimous decision in the first round and a split decision in the quarterfinals against a fighter who was bigger but unable to deter his attacks, 
In the other semifinal match up, the second seed and local product Pat "The Beast from the Bend" Dillon, takes on star freshman Mark "Donkey Punch" De Splinter. After watching De Splinter fight, Dillon, who has already won two unanimous decisions. praised his physical condition and speed. 
"He looked really impressive, he's got a good strong jab," Dillon said. "He throws it quick out there, is in great shape and he can throw a lot of punches." 
De Splinter scored a unani­mous decision in the prelimi­naries and won a split decision victory in the second round. He said he has seen video tape of Dillon's fights, and from that viewing knows he'll have to use his jab to fend off the sopho­more's charge. 
"He's a strong fighter, throws real hard punches," De Splinter said. "l just have to stay away from his 1-2 combinations and try to use my long jab to stay in control of the ring."

Fuller was knocked down, but rallied to win against Alumni's Jon Pribaz in the quarterfinals. 
"First, he's a southpaw, and he's a real good young fighter," said Harms. "He's proved in his last fight that he's got a tough chin. Hopefully I can capitalize on my quickness and my experi­ence."

Staying outside plays into Brandi's plan to use his reach advantage but Kaakua's inside attacks worry Brandl. 
"He's got those quick hands which is scary," Brandl said. "But the fact that he stays back plays a little bit into my advantage. I just can't let him use his quick hands to slip inside." 
Heavyweight 
The two heavyweight favorites step into the ring for the first time tonight. 
Carlos Abeyeta and Stefan Borovina received byes into the semifinals and will face football walk-ons Jeffrey Campbell and Eric Nelson for a spot in Friday's finals. 
"It's a little bit frustrating because you've see everyone fight," Borovina said. "The wait­ing is the toughest. You just want to get in the ring and go." 
Borovina will have a height advantage against Nelson but Nelson said he is used to battling taller fighters since he is the shortest fighter in the weight class. What Nelson lacks in reach, however, he makes up for in toughness. 
"He is a tough kid. He has a hard chin. He can really take a punch," Borovina said. "I am going to keep him away with my reach."

In the other 180-pound semifi­nal, senior captain Mark "Bright Lights, Big City" Criniti continues his quest for three titles against senior Keith "Little Ball of Love" Arnold. Arnold, one of the hard­est punchers ip the division, overcame the reach advantage of Kevin Conoscenti in the quarter­finals to score a unanimous deci­sion win. 
In Criniti, he faces another taller boxer who throws punches nearly as strong as Arnold's. Arnold said he tries getting his

Arnold will also have to adapt to Criniti's left-handed stance. He has yet to fight a left-handed fighter this year. 
"Last year I practiced with one of my buddies who was left hand­ed," Arnold said. "Hopefully I can work on some stuff so that I can stay away from his power."

John Lynk and William Zizic should both get a better chal­lenge tonight when the two fight­ers meet in the semifinals of the 190-pound weight class. Lynk and Zizic both had their quarter­final wins stopped early by the referee. 
Zizic knows he will be in for a much tougher bout against Lynk. however.

MEN'S BASKETBALL 

Graves ready for record-setting trip 


By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Associate Sports Editor 

The only thing that can stop David Graves from mak­ing history is if he misses the plane to New York. 
When Graves steps onto the Madison Square Garden court for tonight's game against St. John's, he will officially have played in his 125th college game, breaking Elmer Bennett's 11-year-old Notre Dame record for most games playod in a college career. 
"I had time earlier this week to reflect on what I've accomplished," Graves said. "It's kind of a time to be self­ish. I'm taking it in. Of all the players that have played here, to play more games than anybody, it's something I've worked hard at." 
It's certainly been a roller coaster of a career for Graves, who started the first 18 games of his career. In his first two seasons. Graves began games on the bench three times. 
That changed under coach Mike Brey. When Graves hit a midseason shooting slump the last two seasons, Brey moved the forward to a sixth-man role midway 
through the season. 

But whenever the season was on the line, Brey put 
Graves back into the starting lineup. He started in Notre Dame's first-round NCAA Tournament game last year against Xavier and in a must-win game last week against West Virginia. 
"He came in when the pro­gr am was way down, and he's helped put us back on 
the map," Brey said. "He's going to leave as a part of two NCAA Tournament teams and being thought of as a winner." 
Graves has quietly moved up the list of Notre Dame's career scoring leaders. He needs to make just three 3­point shots to break Ryan Hoover's seven-year old record of 248 for most 
I career 3-pointers and has to 
I ' score 49 points to move into seventh place on Notre Dame's top career scorers. He has never been named to an All-Big East team and yet opponents still create game plans specifically designed to eliminate Graves' offensive capabilities. "He's kind of the guy that keeps them together," West Virginia coach Drew Catlett said last week. "He is kind of a guy who has gone through Notre Dame and our league unnoticed." 
"I've surpassed everything I thought I could do here," Graves said. "The first day I came on, I never thought I'd be top six or seven scoring, or the best 3-point shooter. But it's all hard work. I've come every day with focus and determination and I've just played hard, and that's all I try to do." 
The pressure has shifted off Graves and the Irish after their win Saturday against Miami. Notre Dame (19-8, 9­5 Big East) is virtually a lock for the NCAA Tournament, while the Red Storm (18-9, 8-6 Big East) are a bubble team desperately in need of a win. 
While St. John's has only lost one game at home all season, Notre Dame is one of the best road teams in the Big East. The key for Notre Dame, Brey said, is to keep the offensive pressure going at all times. 
"That's the most important part of our offense," he said. "It gives us some easy looks and gets Chris Thomas in an attack frame of mind, which is key for our team." 
Tonight's game is impor­tant for the Irish because it will have an affect on where the Irish are seeded in the Big East Tournament. While Pittsburgh has the West Division title all but locked up, Notre Dame is tied with Syracuse for second place. However, the Orangemen have the tiebreaker because they swept the Irish during the season. The first and sec­ond place teams earn first­round byes in next week's Big East Tournament. 
While Brey said he hopes to finish the season on a posi­tive note -the Irish lost their final two games of the regu­lar season last year -he feels enough that the Irish have locked up their bid to the NCAA Tournament. 
"The Miami win eases the urgency a little bit," he said. "St. John's probably needs the win more than we do, to be honest. We feel we've made some great deposits in the NCAA tourney bank." 
Notes: 
. Matt Carroll, who sat out all of Notre Dame's win against Miami on Saturday with a foot injury, will return to the Irish lineup against St. John's tonight. 
"They didn't need me out there," he joked Saturday night. "So I decided to take the night off."

. Wildcats end 51­game home win streak, defeat Irish 48-45 
By NOAH AMSTADTER Spores Editor 
On Dec. 12. 1998, Notre Dame topped Villanova 63-62 at the Joyce Center, a victory that began a string of 51 consecutive home victories for the Irish. Then-sophomore Ruth Riley pulled down a key rebound as the clock ran out that night to secure the victory. 
Tuesday night in the Joyce Center, that streak came to an end. 
Once again it was the Wildcats of Villanova topping the Irish 48-45 in both team's regular season finale. And once again a Riley was in the middle of it, this time senior Villanova guard Mimi Riley, who scored Villanova's last eight points to pull the Wildcats ahead after Notre Dame led 43-42 with just under four minutes remaining. 
"I thought it put a lot of pressure on us really," Irish head coach Muffet McGraw said of the win streak. "I thought the young kids just really just couldn't take the pres­sure. We didn't talk about it all year but coming into the final game it had to be on everybody's mind." 
Notre Dame (19-8, 13-3 in the Big East) shot just 33.3 percent from the field. Alicia Ratay scored 22 points for the Irish, but the rest of the team combined for just 23 points on the night. . 
Ratay was the only Notre Dame player to make more than two field goals. 
"The whole game, we just never were in sync offensively," McGraw said. "I thought Alicia played a great game, but we forced her to do every-

. Wildcats make sure Irish don't have second chance for revenge 
Irish head coach Muffet McGraw said it all following Notre Dame's 48-45 loss to Villanova on Tuesday. 
"They played smart. They don't give you second chances." 
The Wildcats don't give second chances. They don't give second chances on shots. They don't give second chances on defense and they certainly don't give second chances to revenge a loss. 
Earlier this season the Irish dropped a heart­breaker when guard Mimi Riley hit a last second jumper to give the Wildcats a 60-59 victory. Heading into this game, the Irish were look­ing for a second chance to prove that they could cage the Wildcats. But Villanova was not willing to give them that chance. 
The Wildcats played their game on Notre Dame's home court; they took the Irish out of their offense and set their own up. They took away any second chance Notre Dame might have. 
The Wildcats scored 12 points on second-chance points. The Irish scored five. Notre Dame had a total of 12 offensive rebounds. The bench, which has been Notre Dame's strength all season, couldn't

Brock "Landers" Heckmann is a leader when it comes to the Notre Dame boxing team. And he will gladly yield to fel­low senior captains Mark Criniti and Matt Fumagalli when it comes to teaching the finer points of technique. While the latter two are pure boxers, Heckmann will stand toe to toe and out-punch his opponent. As such, he sees his niche as a Bengal Bouts cap­tain as that of motivator. 
"I try to get in here a couple hours early See Also and makes sure every­

th in g's page 20-21 alright," said Heckmann, who comes from Rancho Mirage, Calif. ''I'd say my role in the whole thing is making sure every­body's here, everyone gets 
upstairs at 4:00 on time, get­ting our calisthenics, our push-ups, sit-ups, and jumping jacks all out of the way before we really start coaching. But Mark Criniti, Matt Fumagalli, those guys are more the tech­nical, masterminds of the box­ing scheme." 
In the Bengal Bouts all is not lost if a fighter is not a pol­ished tactician, as Heckmann's title last year in the 150-pound division proves. As just a sec­ond year fighter, he slugged his way through three bouts, the last of which was perhaps the most thrilling fight of the 2001 finals when he outlasted Chris Matassa. 
"I'd definitely throw myself in the 'brawler' category. though this year I've been try­ing to work on the technical fighting more," Heckmann said. "Last year I had three fights, and every one of them was a brawl. I fought Matassa at the end, and that was the biggest brawl of my life. One thing I guess I could say is, I've got three older brothers, so fighting with them at home everyday after school, was a good way to get the brawler mentality going at an early age. My older brother Scott. he's 15 months older than me. He was always a lot bigger than me, so we used to get into it quite a bit."
