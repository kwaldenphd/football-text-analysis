Representatives of the Nestles Corporation--the world's largest food conglomerate--met with 75 students in Madeleva hall at St. Mary's yesterday to confront the charges of unethical business prac­tice levelled against them by the national group INFACf (Infant Formula Action Committee). 
According to representatives of the ND-SMC World Hunger Coali­tion (WHC), the organization whcih sponsored the three and a half hour meeting, this marked the first time that Nestles has sent -corporate executives to deal with the issues raised by the group responsible for the national Nestles boycott. 
Riots break out 
TEHRAN, Iran [AP) • Prime Minister Jaafar Sharif-Emami sub­mitted his resignation to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi last night authoritative sources said, as mobs shouting "Death to the shah!" rampaged through Tehran. 
The soruces said Sharif-Emami resigned during a meeting with the shah but it was unknown if the shah had accpeted the resignation. 
An opposition coalition demanded that Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlave abdicate, further tightening the politcal vise on the man who has reigned over Iran for 37 years. 
One anti-shah religious leader said the current campaign is aimed at ending "American domination" of Iran, and another said a • 'holy war" against the shah might break out if a solution to the crisis is not found. 
Hundred of tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled into Teh­ran as rioters stormed through the capital's streets virtually 
The meeting was a part of a WHC forum entitled "Third World Bottle Babies: Medical Advance or Corporate Windfall," which in­cluded four speakers and two movies that addressed the issue of infant nutrition in the Third World. 
Audience members watched two films--"Into the Mouths of Babes," a CBS News documentary, and "Feeding Babies: A Shared Re­sponsibility,'' a film financed by Nestles. 
According to the CBS film, aired last July, American companies interested in expanding their share of the baby formula market are at least partially reponsible for high rates of infant mortality and malnu­trition in the Third World. 
The one year old Nestles boycott is the result of charges made by . INFACT that Nestles, along with other producers of baby formula, is marketing an overly expensive prodcut in underdeveloped nations. The group claims that, because of 

....

advertising and kick-backs to members of the medical profes­sion, more Third World mothers are switching from breast to for­mula feeding, which in turn is causing high rates of malnutrition and infant mortality. 
Jerry Raffe, general manager of Nestle's United Kingdom and Southeastern Asian concerns, and Jeffery Casso, a representative of Nestle's Office of Corporate Responsibility, called these charges "an oversimplification."

unchecked. 

About 500 demonstrators forced open the gate to the British Embassy and burned down the four-story main building in the downtown complex. The U.S. and Iraqi embassies in the northern part of the city also were threadened, but rioters were driven back by soldiers and tanks. 
Sharif Emami, 69, had been appointed prime minister by the shah on Aug. 27 in an effort to stem Moslem opposition to the govern­ment. 
Unofficial reports said former Prime Minister Ali Amini appeared to be the most likely successor. But there also were rumors that the shah might seek a military solution to the month of bloody street fighting by nammg a general to form a government. 
In another politcal blow to the shah and his government, tow Cabinet members, the minister of education an higher educations, resigned in protest of the army's 
Nation to select Congress 
WASHINGTON [AP] . -The nation elects a new Congress on Tuesday, and by all accounts voters are ready to give the Democrats continued sway in the era of Proposition 13. 
But Americans weary of politi­cans' promises and uncertain what difference their vote makes seem likely to stay away from the polls by the tens of millions. 
The leaders of both parties agree that economic issues -inflation, taxes and government spending ­are uppermost in the mind of the voter. 
And predictably, the leaders of each say their candidates can deal most effectively with the issues. 
"TheAmericanpeople just don't trust the Republican Party" to deal with the. economy, Democratic Party Chairman John White said yesterday on ABC-TV's "Issues and Answers." 
GOP Chairman Bill Brock, ap­pearing on' the same program with White, said, "You've got to change faces in Congress if you're going to see anything better." 
Brock predicted modest Republi­bloody suppression of a student demonstration in Tehran Saturday. The government said three persons were killed and more than 80 injured, but student groups said the death toll was much higher. 
The rioters yesterday, urged on by Shiite Moslem holy leaders and opposition politicians, also called for the ouster of Prime Minister Jaafar Sharif-Emani. 
The dissidents are generally orthodox Moslems opposed to the shah's Westernizing of this tradi­tional Islamic nation, but many also 
seek  domocratic  reforms  in  the  
government, freedom  for  politcal  
prisoners  and  an  end  to  martial  

law. The government has promised to free most politcal prisoners next month and has taken 1,000 lives. 
Efforts toward a politcal solution of the Iranian crisis appeared to have faltered as the National Front, the opposition coalition, announced it had united with holy man Ayatnllah Khomaini, exiled leader 
can gains when the balloting is over, with White declining to make specific predictions. 
For his part, President Jimmy Carter campaigned strenously for Democrats in recent weeks, assur­ing voters he can deal best with the problem most on their mind. "Stick with me" was the presiden­tial theme. 
Thirty-four Senate contests are on state ballots, with voters also choosing a new 435-member House of Representatives. 
There will be gubernatorial elections in 36 states · where Republicans seem : to have the best shot for significant gains -and contests for thousands of state and local offices. 
In the continuing saga of Propo­sition 13, the tax rebellion spawned in California, voters in 16 states will decide whether to accept plans to limit taxes or spending. 
This is also an election with gambling, sex and booze on the ballot. 
Floridians will decide whether to make gambling legal and voters in two states 'Yill decide on homo-of Iran's predominant Shiite Mos­lem sect. 
In a statement issued in Tehran after several days of consultations in Paris between national Front leader Karim Sanjabi and Kho­maini, the oposition accused the shah's governemnt of "repeatedly violating the constitution and imposing cruelty, expanding cor­ruption and surrendering to foreign policies.'' 
In Paris, Khomaini said the • • goepolitical situation of Iran is favorable for the department of the shah" and urged unity among foes of the monarch. 
"The present fight is a fight between the shah's regime, which seeks to keep Iran under American domination, and those who want their country to be independent of all foreign domination," he said. 
As street violence continued, Iran's economy was beset by strikes by oil and communications workers and by the national flag airline Iran Air. 
sexual rights proposals. 
Michigan's voters will decide whether to raise the legal drinking age to 21 while in Montana the question is whether the legal age should be raised to 19. 
The polls show that the public sees little difference between Democrats' and Republicans' abil­ity to deal with rising prices, their top concern. In an Associated Press-NBC News poll, about 48 percent of those responding said their lives will be no better or wo .. ~e no matter who wins the election. 
There are 155.5 million voters eligible to cast ballots, but only 36 percent ofthose eligible in the 1974 mid-term elections voted. 
With estimates that this year's turnout may be even lower, it is difficult to predict the results in races where the candidates appear to be running even. 
In the House of Representatives, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill says Republican~ may gain between 12 and 18 seats in the elections, despite a historical pattern of large opposition party gains in off-year balloting.

There were no fresh reports of fighting from the battle zone. Amin announced last week 1hat Uganda had annexed 710 square miles of Tanzanian territor:r north of the Kagera River, claiming the move was in response tu an earlier Tanzanian invasion of Uganda. Tanzanian officials denied invading Uganda. It had been reported Saturday that Tanzauian mortars positioned in the town of Kyaka on the Kagera River hit Ugandan positions on the northern side of the river and destroyed two Ugandan tanks. On Friday, the Ugandans reportedly bleiV up the main bridge crossing the river.

Complete results from Austria's ftrst plebiscite since World War II showed that the anti-nuclear outcome hinged on a mojority of merely 29,469 votes -less than 1 p1:rcent of the total of 3,183,147 votes cast. The plebiscite was pr1:ceded by an emotionally and increasingly political debate on the merits of nuclear energy.

Meany dooms Carter's plan 
WASHINGTON [AP] • AFL-CIO 
President George Meany repeated 
his belief yesterday that President 
Carter's anti-inflation program will 
not work. But he said it is up to 
local union leaders to decide whe­
ther to go along with it. 
"I don't think it's going to work ... I don't know anybody who's for it," Meany said. "On the other hand, every union has to make its own decision. We haven't gotten any word from anyone as to what they're going to do." 
Meany rebuked Carter last week, saying the president's anti-infla­tion plan would be unfair to labor because it would hold down wages while having little effect on prices. He repeated those charges yester­day and again called for Congress to enact mandatory wage and price controls. "This is the responsibi-
Polls to open on campuses 
Voting in state and local races for tomorrow's election will take place on both the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses. At Notre Dame, booths will be located at the west entrance of the old Fieldhouse lobby; at Saint Mary's, a voting machine can be used at Augusta Hall. Polling places are open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
WHC holds Nestles forum 
[continued from page 1] They cited statistics released by the united Nations that claim a 50 percent drop in infant mortality rates in Third World countries in the past 20 years. The Nestles film detailed the defense of baby formula producers by claiming that the formula is much safer than "traditional sup­plements to breast feeding, such as flour and water or starch gruel. Dana Raphe!, an anthropologist and director of the Human Lacta­tion Center, was both a consultant on the Nestles film and a speaker at 
"lity of Congress," Meany said. 
"This is not the responsibility of 
two or three men appointed by the 
president and who have failed 
before." 
But in another interview yester­
day, the administration's top infla­
tion fighter urged Iaber to give the 
program a chance and maintained 
that it could succeed. 
Alfred Kahn, chairman of the Council on Wage and Price Stabi­lity, said the program can work if people can get behind it. 
"We're not asking labor to bear the brunt of inflation," Kahn argued. 
Kahn was interviewed on NBC's "Meet the Press." Meany ap­peared on CBS's "Face the Na­tion." 
Kahn said, "I don't blame the American working man for being 
concerned. However, he adde 
"The president is determined t 
enforce this program fairly,'' ap 
plying to prices as well as wages. 
Kahn predicted that the Team sters union eventually will agree t a wage settlement within the percent voluntary wage and benefi limit Carter has proposed, becaus of increased competiton in th trucking industry and "the recogni tion by the Teamsters that we're al in this together." 
The Teamsters are scheduled t negotiate a new contract with th trucking industry next spring. 
Besides limiting wage and befefi increases to 7 percent in 1979, th anti-inflation program calls fo businesses to restrain their price under a formula that would gener ally limit these increases to 5.7 percent.

Kovach searches dorms for support 
·" by John Ferroli 
Indiana state Senator Robert L. Kovach visited some Notre Dame dormitories over the weekend to campaign for support in tomor­row's election. 
In a private interview, Kovach emphasized his role as a proponent of education in the 11th district, which includes Notre Dame, South Bend and Mishawaka. Kovach, who has been a member of the South Bend Community School Corporations for 13 years, feels that he is "one of the strongest advocates in the Senate for educa­tion at all levels." 
Kovach, the Democratic caucus chairman in the Senate, also cited his involvement with special educa­
tion programs. He explained tha Indiana has a "weighted system for special education, in which institutions for the handicapped receive much less money per capita from the state than public schools. 
Kovach has sponsored bills which "guarantee" funds for the education of the handicapped and provide "transfer tuition" for trans fer students. 
The 37-year old senator has a special relationship with Logan Center, due to his sponsorship of a bidget amendment to increase funding to that institution. He led the effort of 200 local students in countering a 1977 state budget agency attempt to cut appropria­tions to Logan Center by SO percent. 
Kovach stated that he also plans to propose a bi11 in the next session to initiate a summer school pro­gram for the mentally retarded. 

On the college level, Kovach has fostered state scholarship 'Free­dom of Choice' grants, which assists students in both public and private schools. The former Mish­awaka Common Councilman said that he also intends to propose a bill creating a "Hoosier Merit Scholarship," which would aid the "top 2 or 3 students of an area, regardless of need." 
Kovach mentioned that he has "very much contact" with U.S. Congressman John Brademas who, like Kovach, is a member of important education committees. Kovach said that he "implements" Brademas' legislation on the state level. As an outgrowth of a

Kovach said that he feels that his

Kovach, who is completing his

very close, and that his reelection

is very strong, and that his legisla­tive record fosters this support. He cited his roles in promoting a "landlord-tenant bill" which assists off-campus students and in sponsoring budget increases for the Michiana Regional Airport "which will make it a better and safer facility." The senator also noted that he is in favor of lowering the drinking age in Indiana "to 19 or even 18," but he said he has "reservations" about a local-option

Roll up 530 yards 
Irish trounce Midshipmen, 27-7 
Ferguson leads potent ND attack 
by Tony Pace Editor-In-Chief 
CLEVELAND~Two years ago when Notre Dame played Navy in Cleve­land the Middies played valiantly but fell just short on a last minute touchdown drive and lost 27-21. On Saturday they did manage to score a touchdown in the waning moments of the game, but that was their only bright spot as Notre Dame mauled the eleventh-ranked and previously unbeaten Midship­men 27-7. 
Going into Saturday's contest, Navy had the top ranked rushing defense in the country, having held Pittsburgh to negative rushing yardage the previous weekend in Annapolis. Those defensive records were tarnished by a 375­yard rushing performance by the Notre Dame offense, including an all-time Irish single game record of 21 '} yards by Vagas Ferguson. 
The Irish defense set up the first two scores with fumble recoveries. On the second play from scrim­mage, John Hankerd stripped Navy quarterback Bob Leszczynski of the ball and Jeff Weston recovered it at the Middie 46. From there Irish quarterback Joe Montana directed the Irish to two first downs and, on third and ten form the 20, he fired a sideline completion to Kris Haines. 
Haines shook off a Navy defender at the ten and raced into the end zone with Notre Dame's first six points of the afternoon. Chuck Male's conversion made the tally 7-0. 
Four plays later defensive end Jay Case scooped up a Larrv · Klawinski fumble at the Navy 44-yard line and the Irish offense was again in scoring position. A 29-yard run put Notre Dame deep in Navy territory, but a holding penalty pushed the line of scrim­mage back beyond the 20-yard line. The Irish settled for a 38-yard Chuch Male field goal to booost the score to 10-0. 
The second Notre Dame touch­down came on the first series of downs in the second period. The Irish marched 80 yards in 11 plays, with Jerome Heavens hulling three yards over left tackle for the score. Heavens was the workhorse on the drive, carrying six times for a total of 51 yards. Male's point after touchdown increased the lead to 17 points. 
Later in the quarter after an exchange of punts, Notre Dame had the ball on its own 20-yard line. On second down halfback Vagas Ferguson took a handoff from Montana, broke away form several Navy defenders and raced 80 yards

down the left si•leline for a touch­down. It was the longest run by a Notre Dame bac:r since Eric Penick ran 85 yards f<•r a score against USC in 1973. Male again' made the placement ~.nd the Irish were running away 2•1-0. 
Notre Dame had two ' more opportunites tc pad their lead before the first l.alf ended, but both drives were tltwarted by turn­overs. Heavens fumbled at the Navy one-yard line on a second­and-goal situati:>n which had been set up by a 41 -yard drive. And Montana had a pass intercepted at the Navy five-yard line in the closing second! of the half. The Irish took a 24-0 lead to the lockerroom. 
Neither team was able to gener­ate much off•:nse in the third quarter. The :earns traded punts and Irish cornerback Tom Gibbons intercepted a pass, but neither team threatened. When the fourth quarter openec Notre Dame began to mount a dri' e. A Navy punt had slithered out of bounds at the Notre Dame two-yard line. Montana used 12 consecutive running plays, with Ferguson, Heavens and Pete Pallas carryir g the leather, to march all the way to the Middie 25-yard line. The drive stalled there and Male came on to hit a 42-yard field goal. Those were to be the final Irish points of the afternoon and they made the score 27-0. 
Notre Dame: had another oppor­tunity to score with just over two minutes remaining in the game but a fourth down Montana pass fell · incomplete. Navy took over on its own two-yard line but failed to gain a first down and had to punt. Randy Harrison fumbled an at­tempted fair catch of the punt and the Midshipmen recovered at the Irish 35. Four plays later Navy backup quarterback Rob Powers completed a 13-yard scoring pass to split end Phil McConkey to spoil the shutout. The Navy score came with only 0:12 remaining in the game. 

Navy coach George Welsh was duly impressed with the Notre Dame display of power. "I think they were just better than us. They kicked the heck out of us physical­ly. They controlled the line of scrimmage and they were stronger," Welsh said. 
The Irish offense rolled for 530 total offense, including the 375 yards on the ground. Besides

Ferguson's record-breaking per­formance, Heavens gained an even 100 yards on 21 carries, Pallas barreled for 24 yards on two runs, and David Mitchell picked up 18 yards on four attempts. When Notre Dame coach Dan Devine was asked what the Irish did differently to run for so many yards against the normally stingy Navy defense, he responded with one word "execution." He elaborated, "We were as prepared as we could be. We executed extremely well-that's the key to any offense." Offensive guard Jim Hautman concurred, "we worked well together and we drove hard right at them. We wouldn't let up on our blocks." 
Ferguson and Jay Case, who had two fumble recoveries and several big defensive plays, were named the game's outstanding players. "This was one of the biggest games I've had," said Case. "It was a real good team effort. I only wish we had gotten the shut-out." 

Did I say Navy would fumble a lot and ND would win by 17? Oh, I meant to say 20. 
Saturday's game proved one thing that many people suspected all along, Navy is not all it was cranked up to be. A simple explanation of their undefeated status going into the game can be f.mnd by looking at the claibre of teams they had played. Besides Pittsburgh, the Middies hadn't faced a respectable team and even the Panthers were down after a loss to Notre Dame (this week they barely pulled out •m 18-17 win against Syracuse). One could argue that Navy looked lil:e its real self in the second half when they outscored the Irish 7-3 but tile statistics won't bear this out. Notre Dame blew a scoring opportunity when Joe Montana was intercepted at Navy's 1 ftve yard line. In addition Navy scored its lone touchdown due to the carelessness of ND as Randy Harrison fumbled a punt that he had to run onto the field from the sidelines to catch. 
Even Navy head coach George Welsh admitted, "Notre Dame just physically handled us. They were a better team." Welsh's squad fell ll"'art because they could not handle the running combination of Vagas n:rguson and Jerome Heavens. Ferguson, who gained 217 yards thus topping Heavens single game rushing record, was simply too fast for the Middie linemen. When Navy spread out the defen ;e to handle Ferguson, Heavens would run right over someone. Navy was too light last year and that proved to be the problem once again. The rumling backs fumbled like they have all year but this time there was a talented team on the other side of the line to make them pay for it. 
Ironically, Navy's offense played better than expected as they accumulated 358 yards despite scoring only one;~ 1.the effect of tumovers prevailed). Steve Callahan, Phil McConkey and Bob Leszczynski showed that they could play with anyone in the country. The lrish defense was less than scinitilating but came up with the big play as they have in the last six weeks. It was obvious that Dan Devine wanted that shutout when he sent the starters back in when the Middies got close but to no avail. Navy started the drive from their own three yard line with less than three minutes remaining and never should have put those last seven points on the board. It keeps the day from being perfect which is what the Sugar Bowl scouts wanted to see in Cleveland on Saturday. Navy mentor Welsh said something else that rings true and will keep the big bowl scouts coming to watch Dan Devine's team. "Notre Dame played well and continues to improve every week." 
After an 0-2 start, there was no way but up and the Irish are continuing to climb up the top twenty list. So far that escalation has been slow but after next week's lineup pitting the elite twenty against each other, a jump is inevitable (assuming the traditional Irish upset is not pulled oft). 
The Irish continue to play as well as necessary which is the mark of every winner. The offense and defense perform better each week, much like the progress shown by last year's team. That progress must continue because Southern Cal is waiting for the regular season finale. Team confidence is essential if Notre Dame is going to be up there in the rankings come early 1979. But with performances like Jay Case's and Ferguson's, Devine has to feel that any of his players can make the difference in a game. With three tough games left, more than the twenty two starters will be called on to make the big play. Their success will inevitably decide how the season ends. 

Irish tactics anger Middies 
by Paul Mullaney Assistant Sports Editor 
CLEVELAND -Navy quarter­back Bob Leszczynski just stood there, gazing in no general direction. He must have been trying to put together the pieces of his team's 27-7 setback at the hands of Dan Devine's bowl-thirsty Fighting Irish. 
"We played a helluva game against them, I thought, in the second half," lamented the red­head who threw for 142 yards in a losing effort. "All the mistakes we made in the ftrst half were "too much to come back from." 
Then Leszczynski, as if suddenly coming to life, looked straight into the eyes of those reporters stand­ing in a semi-circle around him. 
"When they put their first team defense back in, and when they were throwing the ball on the last play, I thought that was kind of poor on their part," he firmly noted. 
"To impress the bowl people, I guess that's what it was. It didn't look that good to me. Our team would never do something like that, and I don't know why they would do something lilte that. " 
The Irish brought a number of first line defensive players back into the ball game late in the fourth quarter, attempting to stifle a driving Navy club from scoring its first points of the day ... all of which didn't settle very well in Leszczyn­ski's stomach. 
Those defensive substitutions didn't fare so well, however, as the Midshipmen marched downfield and scored on a 13-yard pass from backup signal-caller Bob Powers to captain Phil McConkey only 12 seconds before what would have been Notre Dame's second straight shutout. 
McConkey was knocked out on t.boe reception, and had to be carried off the field. But that didn't stop the senior split end from letting known his feelings after the game. 
"I don't know who the hell they

In a cleanly-skated affair, it appeared that both squads were headed to the locker room scoreless after one period. The Irish, however, decided to dent the scoreboard with only 29 seconds left in the stanza as Ted Weltzin, assisted. by Steve Schneider and Greg Meredith, slapped one home past Pioneer goalie Scott Robinson. 
But more amazingly, it took only 18 seconds before the Irish tallied again, this time by Meredith with help from Tom Michalek and John Schmidt, giving Notre Dame a 2-0 ftrst period lead. 
The Irish then matched Denver goal-for-goal throughout the re­mainder of the contest. Denver goals by Darrell Morrow and Mark Davidson, sandwiched around Michalek's first of two goals for the evening, brought the Pioneers to within one, 3-2, at the end of the second period. 
Michalek's second goal of the evening, assisted by freshman Jeff Logan, and Denver's score from Vince Magnan made the score 4-3 with just over 12 minutes remain­ing. 
But a move by Notre Dame's Bill Rothstein caused the bottom to fall out for Denver. The freshman from Grand Rapids, Minn., left one defenseman totally twisted at the blueline before moving in on Robinson. He faked the gaolie to his left, and put it home past Robinson's right, putting the Irish ahead by two at the 13:00 mark. 
A Denver goal by Alex Belcourt a minute-and-a-half later brought the [continued on page 7]
