INSIDE COLUMN 
Do you know vvhat I knovv? 
A personal e-mail. An emotional conversa­tion. A heated debate. A private moment shared between you, your significant other, 
and -the guy from the Office of Information Technology? In the words of the famous "Sesame Street" song, one of these things does not belong. 
It has come to my horri­fied attention that the University is reading and screening personal e-mails and abusing its access to them. One student has been recently expelled for possession of marijuana, but the only way the University knew about it was through its monitor­ing of tho student's per­sonal e-mail. Apparently 


Colleen Gaughen 
Viewpoint Editor 

the OIT people can and do read both incoming and outgoing e-mails from all accounts on the 
University's server. 
I don't know about you, but I find this highly disturbing. 
The University would claim that because it owns the server and pays for the transmission of e-mail, it should be entitled to such a blatant invasion of privacy. I say, we pay a hefty tuition that includes such services and should be enti­tled to a little respect. Our personal e-mails should be protected from this outrageous intru­sion the same way our old-fashioned, snail mail is protected. The United States Postal Service is prohibited by federal law from opening, tam­pering with or in any way intentionally mishan­dling letters and packages; what makes the University of Notre Dame Office of Information Technology exempt? 
Is nothing private anymore? It's bad enough that we have watchdogs in our dorms, dining halls and in the student section at the Stadium, but now they are monitoring our personal. pri­vate thoughts and feelings sent through e-mail. That letter I sent my sister about our family issues? They read it. That beautiful forward about friendship and women from my old roommate? They read it. And that sexy e-mail I sent my boyfriend?-Yep, they read that too. 
I feel completely violated. 
Although not the most romantic means of communication (I grieve the untimely death of the hand-written letter), e-mail is nevertheless by far the most effective. I understand that Off needs to monitor the volume of e-mails because a severe increase in volume would create seri­ous systems problems, and I also understand that they scan to prevent solicitors from obtain­ing our e-mail addresses. But just because they offer a great service at a good price doesn't give anyone license to invade people's privacy. Once again, the University is hiding behind legitimate reasons to mask its illegitimate and feeble attempts to create a totalitarian state. 
Ironically, one of the official conditions of OIT use prohibits the violation of privacy. I wonder, do they apply this same rule to themselves? Forget that Big Brother is watching. I'm more concerned about the University and its OIT. 
Today is the feast ofjolly old Saint Nicholas, a time of giving and judgement. I was going to put my shoe out, but I know the University would have checked its contents first.

G~orgetown bookstore sues VarsityBooks.com 
WASHINGTON 

The Georgetown University Bookstore, as a member of tho National Association of College Stores has filed suit in Federal District Court against VarsityBooks.com, alleging that the company's discounts are "false and without factual basis." 
The suit alleges that VarsityBooks.com. an onlinc text­book retailer, falsely claims on its Web site that it offers textbooks at a 40 percent discount while, in reality. selling only a fraction of their books at the advertised discount. Further, the suit alleges that the firm's adver­tisements falsely imply that college bookstores overcharge students. 
The suit does not ask for monetary damages, but instead seeks that the court forbid VarsityBooks.com to promote discounts unless they iden­

Bomb scare shakes Washington State 

PULLMAN. Wash. 
Firefighters responded to an alarm last Thursday and found a bomb threat posted in a hallway next to a fire alarm location. The Fire Department closed the building and police arrived on the scene along with students from parking services to restore order and keep the area clear while the building was searched. WSU police found no hint of a bomb and reopened the building. WSU police Capt. Mike Kenny and police Chief William Mercier were unable to provide details about where the note was placed or what it said, or if they had any suspects. Monty Cobb, a deputy prosecu­tor for Whitman County, said if the person who made the threat is caught, the perpetrator could face a charge of felony threat to bomb. The person could be fined up to $20,000 and sent to jail for as many as 10 years. "There is also a statute that says that even if it is a hoax then they are still guilty," Cobb said. Twelve classes were in session during the fire alarm and 25 classes were unable to meet as a result of the threat.

Jon Kaplan, vic.e president of com­munications and strategic planning for VarsityBooks.com. denied the allegations made by NACS. 
"The lawsuit that NACS has filed is completely without merit," Kaplan said."VarsityBooks.com has adver­tised up to 40 percent discounts, and we will continue to do so." 
Kaplan declined to go into the details of the case because of the ongoing litigation but did further assert that VarsityBooks.com would not change lts practices as of now. 
"What we [VarsityBooks.com] have brought is competition, choice, dis­counts and convenience VarsityBooks.com is going to contin­ue to do this," Kaplan said. President and CEO of VarsityBooks.com. Eric Kuhn also expressed his concern with the law­suit.

A grainy black-and-white photo depicts an interra­cial couple walking hand in hand with the bold head­line, "Hey, white girl! Race mixing is a crime." The National Socialist Movement. a Nazi group posing as a University of Minnesota student organization, post­ed two letter-sized leaflets on a campus bridge this week. The leaflet implied the student group was a registered campus organization by listing a St. Paul Student Center address. Although the Nazi group has a mailbox at the student center, the group is not rec­ognized by the University. June Nobbe, director of the involvement center, said the U.S. Constitution requires the University to allow all groups regardless of ideology to become student organizations. "We have to abide by their freedom of speech and First Amendment rights," she said. "As long as they com­ply with the criteria, we must register them." Little is known about the group, except that at least one per­son involved is a University student.

Senior art exhibits open at SMC 
. Projects reflect personal triumphs, tragedies 
By NELLIE WILLIAMS 
News Wri,er 
Saint Mary's art majors Keri l.anchswocirdl and Mary Hobinson prPsPntnd !lwir snnior comprnhnnsive nxhibition Friday at the Mornau CcnL,w for tlw Arts. dnmonstrating their capacity l'or visual p11rceplion, imagination and nxprnssion. 
011 hugn l'rumcs of canvas, Lanchswe,irdt expressed tho l'ar-rnaching power of diseases in her family. 
As a child. Lm1chswm:rdt was ulTcctcd by hnr father's arthritis in that it prevenled lrnr from playing somn sports with him that ollwr children might nor­mally havn played with their fatlrnrs. 
"All distiases my family [have] affucted me in somn shape or form," said Lanchswcerdt. ''I dncidcid to do large paintings lrncausn the disnase ii.; small und microscopic, and the huge paintings rcprcsnnt the power of the disease. I used oils because I like the way they blend. They don't dry as easily. I wanted to get a l()t of emotion [in my pim:nsl. I hope tho pieces am pow11rful." 
Hobini.;on tried to rnflect on her lifo choices in her exhibi­tion, which coni.;ists of several garmnnts and outfits she put togethur. 
"Some [choices] were good, some were bad," she explained. "But even the bud choices I gained from." 
"In these garments I'd like to present both positivo and nega­tiV(1 role choices. They're called symbolic garments to represent roles that have been taken -­mother, father," said Robinson, whose father and husband wrro alcoholics. 
"I raised my children by myself:' Hobinson said. "[The. art j>rojectl brought up a lot of bad nrnmories. Evtrn after reflecting, though. I realize I'll never be a weak or defeated person." 
This close relationship the artists have with their work maku this a very important part of their lives, said Johnson Bowles, director of the Moreau Center. 
"They work very hard. This is vory important to them and tlrny typically have an emotion­al contact with their piece of work," he said. "The best part is how much of themselves they put into it. It's unique to have your own show as an under­graduate." 
Each student submitted a proposal to the art department the semester before exhibition. 
The materials, method and content of their artwork are all presented in a short paper and a "maquette," which is a small scale version of a piece of art­work, demonstrating propor­tion technique. 
When the proposal is accept­ed, the students work with an advisor. 
"They also spend some time talking with me in the gallery about presentation and profes­sional criteria of how to show work," Bowles said. "It is a solely individual project." 
The art department wants the students to be educated on how to be professional with their work. The department makes contracts with tho students and treats them as if they are pro­fessional artists. 
"Some students have even shown their senior composition projects in professional gal­leries, said Bowles. 
"It was a lot of time," said Lanchsweordt. "Each painting took roughly 12 hours. I built everything myself. It took everything from going to Lowe's to buy the wood to building the structure. It was an e-xpensive project." 
Robinson, meanwhile, spent time finding garments of cloth­ing and making garments com­pletely from scratch. 
"l dyed fabric, applied tex­tures and [did] surface design," said Robinson. 
Both Robinson and Lanchsweerdt have plans for what they would like to do after they graduate this semester. 
"I would like to either go into advertising o·r web design and do my painting on the side," said Lanchsweerdt. 
"I'd like to work on ceramics and photography," said Robinson, who also one day wants to be an art teacher and work in a gallery.

'Zero tolerance' gets controversial test 
Associated Press 

fourteen-year-old freshman Branden Pieratt got a taste of Lakeland High School's "zero tolerance" policy against alco­hol abuse this fall when she took a drink from a friend's Gatorade bottle at a football game. 
Tho drink was spiked with alcohol, and Branden was expelled for a semester, despite her argument that she didn't know the booze was there. 
Her case illustrates the con­troversy surrounding this pop­ular approach tu school disci­pline: Some school adminis­trators and parents say public concerns about student safety require an unbending approat::h to students who vio­late certain roles. But others say common sense has disap­p_eared from the process. 
"The types of school vio­lence in the last two to three years has shaken all of us, especially administrators and school boards. We weren't I ready for that kind of vio­t· lence," said Russ Skiba, an 
I 
associate professor of educa­tion at Indiana University. "We look for things we per­ceive are going to solve the problem quickly." 
Branden, a cheerleader, was caught when she went to ask for bottled water from one of her coaches. The coach smelled the alcohol on her breath and alerted police, who performed a Breathalyzer test. 
Pieratt's mother, Holly, said her daughter's blood-alcohol content was 0.004 percent, well below the 0.10 percent . required to be legally intoxi­cated in'lndiana. 
Lakeland Superintendent Russell Hodges declined to 
talk about individual student 
disciplinary matters, But he 
said the LaGrange County 
school is "up front" about 
offenses and students arc 
aware of "the rules and 
expectation." 
Another problem cited with 
"zero tolerance" is inconsis­
tencies in how the policy is 
applied. 

In September, Jennings County High School volleyball player Ashley Riordan had a sHcond violation of the Panther Code of Conduct, which bars the use of tobacco. alcohol and drugs by athletes. 
She was suspended from the 
volleyball team but reinstated 
after an appeal to the 
Jennings County School 
Board. In her appeal, Ashley 
presented the results of a lie 
detector test, which showed 
that although she was at a 
party where akohol was 
served, she· did not drink. 
Some parents in the school 
district complained Ashley 
received preferential treat­
ment because her father, 
Steve Riordan, is the school's 
principal. 
Kerry Wisner's son Trent 
was suspended from the 
school's soccer team after also 
twice violating the code. 
Wisner's son wasn't allowed 
a second appeal to the School 
Board, and she isn't sure why 
Ashley got one. "All kids can 
say, 'I wasn't drinking,' " 
Wisner said. The bottom line 
with zero tolerance, despite its 
name, is that "some kids get ·punished and some kids don't," she said. Riordan refused to talk about his daughter's case. 
"She's been drug through 
the mud enough," he said. 
"She's 18. As a family, we 
want to move on."

President Fidel Castro demanded Sunday that the United States return a boy rescued at sea to his father in Cuba within 72 hours, warning that the Cuban people were losing patience and soon would begin mass demonstrations. "There will be millions of people in the st.rcets demanding the bov's freedom," Castro said, according to state radio and television. "It is

difficult to hold back the population with the state of irritation" generated by the case of 5-yea.r-old Elian Gonzalez. 
Castro accused the U.S. government of kidnapping Elian, who was found cling­ing to an inner tube float­ing off the coast of Florida. He promised a "battle for world opinion" to bring the child home. In an unusual move Sunday, the Cuban government stationed sev­eral dozen soldiers outside the U.S. Interests Section in Havana -the American

The pro­testers gathered in a uni­versity courtyard. Some had their mouths taped

NEW YORK 
E-retailers are turning to live online chats and other interactive customer services for the holidays as more shoppers abandon the mall for the Web. But it's hardly the warm-and-fuzzy experi­ence some people crave. 
Online shoppers fed up with e-mails that go unanswered and 800 numbers that eter­nally ring busy are demand­ing instant assistance at the click of a button. 
"People get frustrated with the level of customer service available," said Seema Williams, an e-commerce analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "They're in a hurry." 
Two-thirds of all cyber­shopping carts are abandoned before transactions are com­plete. she said, so Web opera­tors that wero preoccupied with getting sites up and run­ning a year or two.ago are now honing in on customer service. · The apparel giants Lands' End and Eddie Bauer are among the largest sites that use interactive software con-church members at Corinthian Baptist Church, touting his goals of extending benefits to 44 million Americans without health insurance, building ·after­school programs for children 
and creating an 
administra­tion that would put r a c i a I progress at· the forefront. 
The for­mer New J c r s e y senator said he w o u I d m a k e diverse 
appointments at the federal level, support affirmative action and create an admin­istration that would help eliminate racial division. 
''I'm going to do that by the tone i.n the air of the admin­istration," Bradley said. "If I'm president and you want to please the buss,. you're going to show that in your life, in your job ... you'll pro-
feel it is tacky, and I suppose intellectually it is," said Carla Johnson, professor of com­munications at St. Mary's College in Notre Dame, Ind. "But from the standpoint of thev have a message that they want to get to as many people as they can ... it's a really good idea." 
The church expects about 10,000 people to take the 15­min ute drive, said Jane Krutz, a member of the church's board of directors. 
Since the church started the tradition 12 years ago, the five-day exhibit has grown to about 140 costumed characters and a stable-full mote racial understanding." 
following his speech, Bradlev took questions from church members who asked him to make improvements in education and after-school programs. 
Bradley's speech was part of threo:day campaign swing through Iowa. where he plans to spread his message on health care and labor issues. 
In an interview with The Associated Press, Bradley said his ideas were driving ·the campaign and resonating with voters, prompting criti­cism from Gore. 
"He's in attack-mode but 
his attacks are getting a 
counter-reaction from those 
who want a politics of posi­

politics as usual, where you 
end up with an election 
where instead of voting for

said. 
"I think they're demon­strating a deep lack of confi­dence in some of their poli­cies and positions," he said. 
Church offers 'drive-thru' holiday 
of animals, from donkeys to hens. 
Motorists pass through nine scenes illuminated with can­dles, each telling a part of the Christmas story. In a scene where shepherds watch their flocks by night, an angel is suspended in the air. 
Many churches have had to turn to secular-style market­ing efforts to attract a crowd, Johnson said. 
"They're using the channels that people are comfortable with. They're giving you something you want to see and at the same time getting the message across," she said.

No word from Mars 
probe for third day 
Associated Press 
PASADENA, Calif. 
NASA antennas listened in vain Sunday for a signal from the Mars Polar Lander and mis­sion ot'ficials acknowledged that, after Lhrce days of silence, time was running out in the effort to contact the craft. 
"Clearly lhe team is getting more frustralPd. certainly. and more tense about all of this," said operations manager Hichard Cook. 
The $165 million lander was supposed to have signaled immediately after Friday after­noon's touchdown about 500 miles from the Martian south pole. 
Fa-ilure of the Mars Polar Lander would be a double blow to NASA's Jct Propulsion Laboratory, still smarting from the September loss of its sibling spacecraft, the Mars Climate Orbiter. 
Mission managers worked on eliminating simple failure sce­narios one by one. Rut they conceded if contact has not been established before mid­week, it was increasingly unlikely to have success with what would then involve more complex failure scenarios.

definitely in extra time," Cook said. "We're not there yet. I think we will be, come Tuesday morning." 
Sunday's first communica­tions window opened at 10:50 
a.m. PST and closed 10 minutes later without any transmission from the surface of the Red Planet. 
The lander, if working prop­erly, was supposed to have switched radios to relay a signal through NASA's orbiting Mars Global Surveyor. But the map­ping spacecraft only sent its own data and none from the lander. 
Sunday's only other commu­nications opportunity. using the original radio, was scheduled for 9:40 p.m. PST to 11:55 p.m. PST. 
Lack of any signals since shortly before Friday's sched­
ulod landing left mission offi­
cials with hope only that the lit­
tle craft survived the touch­
down and, on its own, was lak­
ing steps to establish contact. 
Mars Polar Lander could have gotten into trouble simply by .setting down in diflicult terrain. 
"Landing on Mars is vory 
hard -and it's the part whero 
you're landing that's really 
hard,'' said Cook. "It doesn't 
take much to have problems." 
Two tiny probes designed to 
fall separately from orbit and 
plunge into the surface also 
failed to send signals. Sarah 
Gavit. the project manager for 
the probes, said that if tlrny did 
not make contact by late 
Sunday night it would bu 
unlikely to believe communica­
tion would ever be nstablishcd 
with them. 
Controllers contimrnd to oper­
ate on the assumption that the 
landing was successful because 
the spacecraft was in exccllont 
condition just prior to entry and 
analysis showed its trajectory 
was good. 
Engineers have theoriznd that 
the craft set down in a position 
that has kept its dish antnnna 
from pointing at Earth, or that 
it settled into a soft surface. 
Sunday's first communication 
window was based on a contin­
gency pro­
gram car­
through a 
directional 
dish anten­na. But its programing included instructions in case there was a failure of the power amplifier for its "X-band" transmitter ­the one intended for Earth com­munications. 
The program required the lander to switch to a non-direc­tional UHF radio if it had not received instructions from Earth by Sunday. The orbiting Mars Global Surveyor was lo listen for the UHF broadcast and relay it to Earth immedi­ately. 
NASA said that if the commu­nications blackout continued past the weekend, commands would be transmitted lo instruct the lander -if it was opera­tional -lo begin switching between redundant systems lo try to signal Earth.

Debunking the h Ype 2K 
Every week on my radio show on WVFI, l do what I call a "Millennium Update," during which l talk about some weird, strange or otherwise idiotic thing that has to do with the year 2000. For the half-dozen . or so of you who've actually heard my show, you know. For the rest of you, here's a brief primer. 
Calling this impending New Year's "the dawn of the new millen­nium" is wrong on two counts. The millennium begins in 2001. I won't get too purist on this, since we find 2000 more special because ofthe fact that it will be the first time in 1000 years that the year won't start with a 1, and plus, we love round numbers. It's a moot point, anyway, because we know have scientific evidence that whoever first dated Christ's birth at the year 0 was off. Jesus was actually born in 4 or 5 Before Christ, which means we're get­ting all stoked to ring in the year 2004 or 2005. Kind of takes some of the · starch out of it, doesn't it? This is also why it's moronic to think that 2000 will be the year God destroys the earth. If it were, we wouldn't have lived past 1996. 
But enough of that. Let's get on to the dumber stuff. The year 2000 has been, more than anything else, a huge mar­keting ploy. M&M's have been declared "the official candy of the new millenni­um" for almost two years now. 


Cheerios is making a millennium spinoff in which they have 2's in with the O's. Wait, did I say "Cheerios"? I meant Spaghetti-O's. No, I meant both. There's Millennium Twinkies, Millennium Fruit Loops, the Mi-loony­um at Subway and Act II Microwave Popcorn, "the microwave popcorn of the new millennium." What, is the pop­corn Y2K-compliant? If it were, you wouldn't need a microwave, would you" 
Ah, yes, Y2K. Did you see "Y2K: The Movie" on NBC a couple of weeks ago? That's okay, no one else did, either, except me. It won't be as bad as that irresponsible film says that it will. I have reasons why I believe that Y2K is a lot of hYpe-2K. 
First, I bought a computer in 1992. It has Windows 3.1. It sucks. About three or four years ago, I got curious as to whether or not it would accept dates after the year 2000, unlike my VCR. (Don't worry, that VCR has made its trip to the great Radio Shack in the sky.) I reset the date to 11:58 p.m., Dec. 31, 1999, and in a couple of minutes. it read 12:01 a.m., Jan. 1, 2000. Now, if my computer, which probably would get whipped by an Apple Ile, is Y2K-compli­ant, I imagine most of the computers in the world are. 
Second, Bill Gates is estimated tu be worth $70 billion. Problem is, most of it is tied up in Microsoft stocks. If, on Jan. 1, 2000, almost every Microsoft comput­er in the world does nothing but state "Abort, Retry, Fail?" Gates' fortune will be vaporized. I have a feeling he'll spend a little quid if that's what he needs to do to get the job done. 
Third, here's a short list of all the 
things that are Y2K-compliant: most of 
the U.S government, including the j2 
Pentagon and the State Department, the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service (damn it, if there was just one thing that Y2K could wipe out); the New York Stock Exchange; and Meijer, where I am so privileged to be employed. Therefore,. we will all have a world tilled with basic human necessities. Now, I do have a worry or two that we might have a dip in stocks because computers in other nations may nut be as Y2K-compliant. But I don't think that the global finan­cial market will suffer a meltdown because the Pakistani market has a blip. 
However, there are still some people who are pushing the panic button. Some jerk has been incessantly spam­ming my e-mail address for almost three months, saying that Y2K is the end of the world. Apparently, he's the only one who's seen some verse of Revelations that says that the world will end. He also believes that he's the only one who truly understands the uni­verse, therefore he should be made the head of NASA. If I had my way, I would put him in a straightjacket in a rubber room and watch him go insane on New Year's, but that's just me. 
Those are just some of my pet peeves. I don't write this to try to be a buzzkill. By all means, go nuts on New Year's Eve. Party like it's 1999. We've earned it for putting up with all of this stuff.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Martinez's 'arrows' miss the mark 
Martinez a danger to academia 
I hopu that most students who read Gabriel Martinez's recent r.olumn. "Be Aware of the Signs You Send to Men" (12/2). are intel­ligr.nl enough to recognize how offensive and ignorant this column is. This article is not only an affront to women, to whom Mr. Martinez addresses it, but tu men as Wflll. 
First. it may surprise Mr. Martinez to know that not all women choose their clothes with men in mind. My hope is that most women on this campus, whether they wear "beautiful clothes that don't rnvmLI anything" or "tight, revealing clothes" (or sweat pants. for that matter). do so because these clothes are comfortable. func­tional, ur just fun. Thal is. I hope women wear clothes because they lik<l them, n()t bocause they antidpato a certain reaction from mnn. Purthtir, rPgardless of how women dress or why they dress in certain ways, Mr. Martinez and other men remain responsible for any assumptions Uwy might make and feelings they might have ahuut the "signals" these women are sending. 
SHr.oncl, just as I hope that women on this campus would recog­niw that the "good girl/bad girl" dichotomy with which Mr. Martin!'z prt!sents th!)ln is false, I would also hope that the men on Lhis campus would rncognize that the "good guy/pig option" is no less insulting. 
Finally, and mosi importantly, I would like to add that as a fellow gra<luato studont, I am horrified by the thnught that Mr. Martinez may be in a position to grade tho paperi; of, or even to teach, fomalfi stud1mts. I cannot imagine how the views of women which he presents in this article do not affect tho way in which he assess­es the performance of female students in class. Images of women that am as stnreotyped as those presented by Mr. Martinez (the age-old virgin/whore dichotomy to hr, precise) continue to make it dillicult for wonwn to be treated fairly and r,qually in the class­room and in their professional lives. If Mr. Martinez does have any grading or l!mching rnsponsibilitios, his viows, expressed in such a public forum, should be a serious concern to his department and a caution to any future employers. 
Maria Malkiewicz 
Ph.D. Candidate, department oftheology December 3, 1999 

There are more kinds ofmen than 'pig' and 'good guy' 
In onn fell swoop, Gabriel Martinez could send gender relations at Lim University of Notre Dame to the Dark Ages. His column did nothing but pnrpetuute every gender stereotype I have ever heard. In the future, I would hope that Mr. Martinez would stick with his clear-cut (lCOnomic analyses rather than ignorantly dab­ble in an twalualion or gender rnlations. 
llere is why. As a man, I am offended by Mr. Martinez's classifi­cation systmn. In his column, men can be identified only as party­ing pigs or church going. wife-seeking "good guys." I know a lot of guys who go to parties and talk with girls dressed to the nines without thoughts of sexual activity. They do not walk around hunting for a girl who is sauced to take home. These arc the same guys who have no problem hanging out with the same girls the nnxt day when they are in baggy sweats sans makeup. Guys can go to dorm parties, drink if they choose, llirt with and compliment girls and still go to church the next morning with a relatively clear conscitmcn. Not all party animals are pigs, and not every good guy wants to put a ring on the lingm of the lirst good girl he meets. Colfog!, is an important time to meet people and establish friend­ships, friendships that can grow into meaningful relationships. It is not just a hunt for the future husband or wife. 
My other problem exists with Mr. Martinez's classification of wonwn. One would think that Mr. Martinez would have better scmsn having brnm raised with sisters. The mere use of words like "sluttish" a11cl "damaged goods" to describe a woman, any woman, is 1111s11itable. Additionally, his analysis of the party scene is remiss 011c1, again. Why shouldn't a girl go out in what she feels cmnfortable in'? Why does he make the assumption that guys see all girls who arn dressed up and having a drink or two as "slut­tish." What is tiven more disturbing is his classification of expm-i­nncmf girls as "damaged goods." Not everyone can be perfect; them am drivos that pm1ple have problems disciplining. Is an alr.oholic "damagod goods"? 
I don't purport lo bo an expert on rnlationships or gender rela­tions, but I rncognize lhat when it comes to love and friendship, you lnarn as you go However. I fear that Mr. Martinez's search for pcrfoGLion will most likely leave him sorely disappointed. Our human naturn assurns that no one can ever be perfect. I, for one, plan on sptncling my time with someone I enjoy passing it with, rngardliiss of whnthcr she parties or prays, and any llaws there might be b1\twe1111 us could be worked out. 
I am afraid when it comes to gender relations, Mr. Martinez's arrows urn off tho mark.

Excerpts from more letters 
. We live with t~ese ~uys for four years. We eat with them, attend classes with them, study with thorn, go to parties with them and form relationships with them. Roughly 65 percent of us typical­ly _marry_ th~se men after we graduate. f-!ow are we to know which of them support sexist and m1sogymst 1d~~s when many of us remam unaware of the undercurrent of sexism and misogyny that has trad1t10nally plagued our campus? Gabriel Martinez's column greatly concerns me in this respect because of its insistence upon only seeing and labeling women either as saints or as whores. This kind of thinking contributes to the culture of rape, sexism, and misogyny which has traditionally beep espoused by peoples all over the world. · . Blaming women for "the pig's" sexism and misogyny simply represents a way of skirting the real issue at stake here -that people set limits and restrictions on women's sexuality in response to our culture's traditional espousal of sexism and misogyny. 
Stephanie Andre Junior, Farley Hall 

Mr. Martinez has latched onto the misperceived notion that these "easy" women are responsible not only fo~ their acti~ns but somehow responsible for the actions of any men who may gaze upon the_m; The issue here is one of bl~me. To classify a woman because of the way she acts and dress­es 1s igno_rant. To lay blame of this classification upon the shoulders of women surpasses the ~ealm of ignorance to that of stupidity. The problem lies not with "easy" women, but with men, hke Mr. Martinez, and their arrogant belief that they r.an classify women based on "signs." 
Christopher Reyes Senior, OffCampus 

This is the most offensive column I have ever read in The Observer. 
Roshin Sen Graduate student, department ofsociology 

f\lr. Martine_z's i~ea that women need to prove that they deserve respect through appropriate att1~e and actions is extremely dangerous. It is precisely this attitude that has justified rape on the basis that a woman dressed provocatively. Urging women to dress and act "properly" does not protect them -it victimizes them, and most tragically it excuses the "pig-like" behavior that Mr. Martinez describes. Women of Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross: don't accept Mr. ~artinez's_invitation to imitate his sisters. Instead, continue to be the independent, intelligent and highly motivated women that you are. The right to basic human respect is already yours, no mat­ter what you are wearing.  
Katie Koch Sophomore, Cavanaugh Hall 

Believe it or not, _women are not solely preoccupied with finding a mate for marriage. ~urther_more, Martmez ~hortchanges the male gender by portraying them as incapable of control­lmg thmr own sexual drives. Are men really so weak that they succumb to every temptation ­e~~1'. those that relate to u?~.orthy, i~~~al, slutty women? Instead of unduly placing all respon­s1b11ltf. ~11,.~omen t~ remam wo~thwhile and holy, ~hy not focus some attention on correcting male p1,g 1mmora~1ty? Mr. Martmez, please do not aim to reform all pigs into your "good guys," though. rhe last thmg we need is more arrogant, self-righteous individuals like yourself. 
The Residents of 819 East Washington Street 
Seniors, OffCampus 

Mr, Martinez, get real. Grow up. Talk to some educated, mature women and realize that a wo~an.~rossing.?r. ac,tin~ in a certain manner is never a justification for men acting like "pigs." l thmk 1t s more ,p1gg1sh to try to make excuses for them at all! A man is always responsible for the way he perceives someone no matter what, just as a woman is. Don't put these ideas into other immature males' minds in the future and add morn ignorance to the world. 
Melanie Peldo

Perhaps Mr. Martinez would prefer a return to the fashions of 100 years ago with women com­plotoly covered from the neck down. Or perhaps he prefers the burkhas that the womnn of Afghanistan are required to wear? I suspect Martinez is a pig of another kind -a sexist pig.

too?" 


Retreat to youth with Ralphie 
By JASON HAMMONTREE Scene Movie Critic 
"A Christmas Story" is just one of those movies. You grew up with it. You don't necessarily remem­ber when you first saw it, but you remember see­ing it again and again. It's part of our generation's pop culture, its lines a part of the common lexicon. 
But beyond its particular importance to our age group, watching it again as a young adult illumi­nates the universality of this movie and its endur­ing appeal to everyone for its wonderful ability to capture what the life of a child is really like, espe­cially around Christmas time. 
You know the plot. Ralphie, who lives in a small town in northern Indiana, wants a Red Rider Air· Rifle for Christmas. He struggles to convince his parents, his teacher and old Santa Claus himself he should get it. But they all disagree, warning him he'll "shoot his eye out." With that as its basic story line, ihe film is filled in with all the little scenes that are part of a kid's life, from avoiding the school bully to listening to your dad swear up and down about the faulty furnace, to daring your best friend to stick his tongue to a cold tlagpole. 
Even though the film is set in the 1950s, its set­ting in no way limits the audience's ability to con­nect with what occurs. Part of the appeal was sit­ling down to watch "A Christmas Story" with your parents, whose childhood was being depicted, and sharing the feeling that our own childhood was still like that (only with different toys). Everyone's childhood was filled with experiences just Hke those in "A Christmas Story." 
Watching this film with a roommate, one watches Ralph, his little brother Randy and Ralph's friends, nostalgkally remembering all personal stuff simi­lar to that in the film. We wouldn't eat anything; when we broke our glasses, we honestly thought our dad was going to kill us; and we ate soap for saying bad words. Also forgotten was how piercing a child's screams were whenever things didn't go his or her way. 


That is what makes "A Christmas Story" the clas­sic 1hat it is. Anyone who watches the film was just Jike Ralph and company at some time. Everyone 
has gone through life, oblivious to what was going 
on, worried only about how to convince their par­
ents and Santa to give them what they wanted for 
Christmas. 
As far as the film-making goes, the narration by 
the adult Ralph that makes the movie a real joy to 
watch. The truly creative touch was to have the 
adult Ralph (the writer of the film, Jean Shepherd, 
lends his voice to this role) describe everything 
with the same zeal and exaggeration that a kid 
would, albeit with much bigger words. His voice­
overs are filled with a wonderfully poetic language 
and style. The images created by his use of lan­
guage are priceless -he refers to his dad's pen­
chant for swearing as a "rich tapestry of obsceni­
ties hanging in space over Lake Michigan." 
Peter Billingsley, one of the best ch_ild actors I've 
seen, plays Ralph. Acting in response to the voice­
over of a narrator is extremely difficult, but he 
pulls that and the rest of the movie off with ease 
(Which begs the question, what is he doing these 
days?). 
"A Christmas Story" is worth a holiday reviewing 
to remind everyone how they used to act around 
Christmas; it will even cause a sentimental longing 
to return to that simpler age, or at the very least, 
to start a return to the holiday mood. 
To leave you with one caveat: when Schwar:£ 
"triple-dog" dares Flick to stick his tongue to the 
flagpole, and Flick's tongue gets stuck, trust that is. 
what happens. It does stick. It does hurt. It does 
remove skin when you pull your tongue off. Lest 
you feel a need to experiment. a piece of this 
writer's tongue hangs on a lamp pole outside an 
apartment building in Columbus, Ohio, following 
an ill-fated attempt to disprove that little theory. It 
wasn't a pleasant experience.

sports writer After the loss in the national 
championship game, she needed a 
few minutes to herself. Some time to reflect before she had to shake hands with Tar Heels coach Anson Doran or hug her coach, Randy Waldrum. To contemplate four years before buttress­ing her teammates under her sturdy leadership and encouraging underclassmen to look forward to next year. 
To think about time she doesn't have with the Irish anymore. 
When she joined the huddle of inspiring green jer­seys, the rock of solid support allowed herself to crumble into her teammates, letting her tears fall freely. 
"I look at how brave [we were], especially toward the end of the season," she said after the game. "That's what we're all about." 
They've drawn on the same courage they learned when they battled North Carolina for the NCAA title as freshmen. Back when losing didn't hurt so much because there would be more shots at the Tar Heels. 
Since then, they've taught East and West Coast pro­grams that a school where there are cornfields instead of coastlines can grow into a soccer power, too. Together, the Class of 2000 continued the domi­nance they inherited from the 1995 national champion Irish. 
They learned about letdowns and laurels. Sunday, they learned about last chances. 
Entering Notre Dame the year after the Irish cele­brated their '95 title, the seniors spent four seasons chasing the standard. Often, that meant nipping at North Carolina's tarheels. 
The Irish went 1-3-1 against the Tar Heels the last four years, including an overtime win in their initial meeting, a tie in a lightning storm, a loss in the '96 championship game and a 5-1 drubbing in front of the largest regular-season crowd recorded by the NCAA. 
With rivalry, they discovered, comes respect. 
"A loss is a loss," said senior forward and All­American Jenny Streiffer, who had one of just three Irish shots Sunday against the Tar Heels. "I like some of the players on their team and I'm really glad they could go out with a win. If it had to be [another] team, I guess I'm glad it's them." 
The Irish, the fifth seed in the tournament, were considered a surprise by advancing to the champi­onship game after beating undefeated and No. 1­ranked Santa Clara Friday night. No eyebrow raised, however, on the no-nonsense Notre Dame side of the field. 
What else, they figured, would a team so thick with talent do? 
A team with three All-Americans (the most in Irish history), the all-time leading scorer (Jenny Heft, 80) and a player who accomplished only what Mia Hamm can do (Streiffer's 70 goal-70 assist mark) shouldn't fall any shorter than the championship game. So they didn't. 
Following the lead of Heft's determination, goal­keeper LaKeysia Beene's focus, Streiffer's zest, Kara

With 11 minutes remain­continued from page 1 ing in the game, Tar Heel midfielder Beth Sheppard "You know what they're erased all hopes of an Irish going to do. They're victory when she scored, extremely difficult to get in increasing North Carolina's behind, especially with lead to two.

Brown's take-no-prisoner defense, Iris Lancaster's spark off the bench and Big East Defender of the Year Grubb. the Irish knew all the dance steps. Unfortunately for their chorus line, the Tar Heels took the bow at curtain call. 
After the shutout, Streiffer showed how to lift a 
-team. As Grubb stood in disbelief on the field, Streiffer slung her arm around her teammate, high-lived Beene. then consoled the younger players. She understood them because she was there four years ago after an overtime championship loss. She knew what she needed to hear then; she knew how to say it now. "They'll win," she said about the Irish underclass­men, smiling with confidence. "They're going to get one. Our team is too close, too tight of a unit and too hard of workers not to get one." But the underclassmen wanted this game for the seniors. "I feel really bad that we couldn't pull through for them," said junior Kelly Lindsey, her eyes red from spilling tears. "Every position, they've given us the leadership that we needed. I swear they're the best senior class in the nation this year. They worked so hard to get us here and we just couldn't do it for them." Beene is ready to let the young ones lead. "My freshman year, the thing they tell you is you'll get them next year," said Beene, who recorded seven saves against Santa Clara Friday and four against North Carolina Sunday. "You look back and kind of think. The first question was, do I have any regrets? And that was easy for me. It was obviously no; 1 have no regrets. It is our last game, so it's kind of sad. But at the same time you're kind of excited for the fresh­men and you know they have a few years to get it accomplished." The six Irish seniors might take a few days to wal­low, but they won't need much morn. "They'll take a day or two to let it all sink in," said first-year Irish coach Waldrum. who credits the seniors with his smooth initiation into the system. "But hopefully, in a day or two, they'll all realize how important they are -what they mean to this team." 
for an easy score. 
Despite the loss, Beene turned in a powerful per­formance for the Irish. Corning up with several impressive saves against Santa Clara, the senior goalkeeper anchored the Irish squad and led it into the final round. 
''I've always thought that LaKeysia is the best goal­keeper in the country and I think she showed it this weekend,"said Grubb. "In the game against Santa Clara she came up with some big-time saves for us. ... Unfortunately it's been our fault that her goals­against average wasn't as good as it should have been this year." 
Sunday's loss to the Tar Heels marks the sixth con­secutive post-season appearance for the Irish, who won the tournament in 1995. With the win, the Tar Heels enhanced their record as the most winning team in women's soccer history and earned their 16th national title.

Coleman leads Hornets to win over hapless Sonics 

Associated Press 
SEATTLE 
Derrick Coleman scored 26 points, as the Charlotte Hornets handed the Seattle Supersonics their second straight lopsided homecourt loss, 103-81. 
Eddie Robinson had a season­high 18 points off the bench for the Hornets, who improved to 3­6 on the road this season and concluded their four-game trip with a 2-2 record. 
Gary Payton led the Sonics with 17 points. The Hornets double-teamed him aggressively throughout and held him to 4­for-14 from the field. 
Payton had eight assists and six rebounds and played the first 45 minutes of the game before he was taken out with 
3:17 out and the Sonics down 97-77. 
The Hornets held the Sonics to a season-low 35 percent shooting and without a basket for the first 3 :50 of the fourth quarter. Seattle went on a 10-1 run to take a 85-66 lead. 

Baskets by Anthony Mason, David Wesley and Todd Fuller gave the Hornets a 75-58 lead late in the third quarter. The Sonics closed within 75-65 after three quarters. 
McCoy kept the Sonics in the game during the first half with 10 straight points during the second period on 5-for-5 shoot­ing. He also picked four person­al fouls. 
Raptors 98, Spurs 92 
Vince Carter scored a career­high 39 points iri the Raptors' win over the Spurs. 
Carter, last year's rookie of the year, was 15-for-25 from the field. He also had seven rebounds, and made all eight of his free throws. 
After Dee Brown got a steal with just under two minutes remaining, he fed Carter, who hit a mid-range jumper in traf­fic. 

Avery Johnson, who had 20 points, responded with a jumper to pull San Antonio within one. but Tracy McGrady nailed a jumper with 44.9 seconds left to give the Raptors a 92-89 lead. 
Tim Duncan, who was double teamed down the stretch, missed an 18-footer with 30 seconds left. 
The Spurs then fouled Doug Christie, who hit both of his free throws. 
After Terry Porter made a desperation 3-pointer to bring the Spurs within two, Carter was fouled. He made both free throws to give Toronto a 96-92 lead. Christie was fouled again. He then made both free throws to complete the scoring. 
Toronto jumped out to a 12­point lead in the third quarter on a 9-0 run where Carter scored six points, including a spectacular dunk that had the crowd in awe. 
Carter did a crossover, busted Chucky Brown's ankles, then dunked over David Robinson. 
The Spurs began the fourth quarter on a 13-2 run as Duncan, who had 27 points and 13 rebounds, scored 10 points during the stretch. 
Robinson was held to seven points. He was just 2-for-9. 
Carter hfld 18 points as the Raptors led 45-44 at the half. Johnson had 14 for the Spurs~ 
Bucks 103, Mavericks 97 

Sam Cassell dominated the game with 16 points and a career-high 18 assists as the Milwaukee Bucks held off the scrappy Dallas Mavericks. 
Cassell, who had 23 points and 15 assists at Chicago on Saturday, emphatically put his early season offensive troubles behind him with a marvelous weekend of play. 
Michael Finley was almost as impressive for the Mavericks. He had 29 points, including 12 during a last-minute rally that cut Milwaukee's 21-point fourth-quarter lead to 97-91 with 40 seconds to play. 
But Glenn Robinson, who fin­ished with 17 points, hit a short jumper and Finley turned the ball over. Damon Jones hit a three-pointer with 12 seconds, but Cassell hit two free 'throws to seal the win. 
Ray Allen had 20 points for Milwaukee, and Tim Thomas added 13. Jones and Hubert Davis had 18 points apiece for .the Mavs. 
Milwaukee, which never trailed and led by 20 points early in the second quarter, beat the Mavs for the sixth straight time as Dallas saw its two-game winning streak snapped. Dallas finished a five­game road trip with a 2-3 record. 
The Bucks blew a 17-point lead at Chicago on Saturday night before hanging on to beat the Bulls 92-91. At times, Milwaukee appeared ready to lose another big lead Sunday by committing an ·uncharacteristic: 24 turnovers. including six by Cassell. The Bucks lead the league In turnover margin. 
Dallas closed to within 69-61 in the final minute of the third quarter, but the Bucks made a 13-2 run in the next four min­utes that appeared to put the game away. 
Consecutive thunderous dunks by Thomas on passes from Cassell put Milwaukee up by 18 with seven minutes left. One minute lat1-ir, Thomas dunked on 7-foot-6 Shawn Bradley.

Seminoles, Hokies face off for national championship 
A_ssociated Press 
No mystery, no intrigue, just this simple fact: No. 1 Florida State will play No. 2 Virginia Tech for the national champi­onship in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4. 
In the second season of the Bowl Championship Series, the system of rating teams using polls, computers, strength of schedule and losses worked per­fectly. 
As expected, the Seminoles (11-0) and llokies (11-0) finished first and second in the final BCS standings released Sunday, matching their finish in the AP media poll's final regular-season rankings. The USA Today/ ESPN coaches' poll also had the teams ranked 1-2, as did seven of the eight computers used by the BCS. 
"They've been there so many times and we're kind of the new kid on the block," Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer said. "Hopefully, you'll get to like us. This is a good group, a hard­working group. We've met every challenge this year but we've not had a challenge like Florida State." 
Florida State, national cham­pions in 1993, will be playing in its third national title game in the past four years. Coach Bobby Bowden said h~ 's just happy his team in the title game, but ''I'd just as soon be No. 2 going in. There's a little more incentive. But the idea is to get there and whoever wins the game is going to be No. 1." 
Even No. 3 Nebraska (11-1), which dominated Texas 22-6 on Saturday to win the Big 12 title, conceded the Florida State­Virginia Tech matchup was the right one. The Cornhuskers. who lost their title chance two weeks ago with a shaky overtime win over Colorado, will play No. 6 Tennessee (9-2) in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan 2. 
"We'll live with the system," Nebraska coach Frank Solich said after his team avenged its only loss of the season. "There's probably four or five other teams out there that believe they could line up in the national title game. But Florida State and Virginia Tech are great teams, too, and deserving."

Comeback by Marino falls short against Colts 
Associated Press 
MIAMI 

Standing alone on the side­line. Dan Marino watched the gamp's final play, then unsnapped his chin strap and slowly walkod off the field, !wad down in d1f'cat. 
1111 didn't s1ic countcrparl l'nyton Manning leap in the air to lc1ad tho Indianapolis Colts' cnlnbration. 
'"!'hut's the highHst I've ever jumped," Manning said later. 
Manning and his teammates barely withstood u gallant comclmck by Marino, and Mike Vandorjagt's 53-yard field goal as timll ran out bmtt the Miami Dolphins :H-:H Sunday. 
Marino, his earner in jeop­ardy, threw thrno touchdown passns and rallind Miami from a 14-poinl deficit in the second half'. But Manning hit Marvin llarrison with completions of 16 and 18 yards in the linal 30 si1conds to set up the winning 
kick. 
"Never sav it's not over until it's over." s~id Manning, giving Yogi Berm's famous phrase a twist. 
The Colts (10-2) took control of the AFC East with a two­game lnad over Miami and Buffalo. Indianapolis has won eight in a row since losing at homn lo the Dolphins on Oct. 
10. 
"This was a huge test for us, the biggest test ol' the season," Indy coach Jim M<>ra said. 
Miami (8-4) was left to scram­bin for a wild-card berth. The Dolphins sharnd the NFL's best rncord beforn losing three of thoir past four games. 
"The way the AFC: is, we're lighting just to make the play­offs," coach Jimmy Johnson said. 
Rams 34, Panthers 21 
The St. Louis Hams capped their unlikely rise from NFC West do11rmats to division champions with a 34-21 victory over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday. 
St. Louis, which improved lo 10-2 for the first time since 1978, hasn't been to the play­offs since 1989. 
After winning their first six division games by an average of 25 points, the Rams wrapped up the r,rown by weathering the Panthers' second-half rally. 
The Rams' defensri had shut out their fast three opponents in the second half, but Carolina scored 14 points lo make it close before Dre' Bly's 56-yard interception return put St. Louis up by 10 with 9:48 left. 
Carolina (5-7) hurl itself all day with penalties, breakdowns in thn secondary and missed tackles. The Panthers, who intercepted Warner twice but were unable to convert either one into points, missed a chance to roach the .500 mark for the first time in two years. 
Bengals 44, 49ers 30 
Cincinnati (3-10) put up its highest point total in 10 years, ended a streak of 11 straight home losses, got back-to-back wins for the first time since 1997 and had some fun at the expense of the team that has tormented them more than any other. 
The Bengals had lost their last nine games to the Niners since 1975, including a pair of Super Bowls in the '80s. Fans booed as highlights of those games were shown on the video board. 
At the end, thousands stuck around in the rain to cheer the most satisfying win of the sea­son. 
The 49ers trudged off the field with helmets in hand after losing their eighth in a row ­their worst skid in 19 years ­and clinching their first losing season since 1982. 
Lions 33, Redskins 17 
Desmond Howard returned a punt 68 yards for a touchdown, and Detroit's defense contained Washington's potent offense as the Lions beat the Redskins, snapping an 18-gamc losing streak that had stretched to 34 years. · Howard, waived by Green Bay and signed by Detroit on Saturday, was needed because Terry Fair, who had a house­hold accident and broke a knuckle, was unable to play. 
Chiefs 16, Broncos 10 
Tamarick Vanover returned a punt 80 yards for a touchdown with 4:53 left, lifting the Chiefs to a 16-10 victory Sunday. 
The Chiefs (7-5), who drew within one game of AFC West­1eading Seattle after the Seahawks bowed 30-21 to Oakland, won a game of field position that featured punters Daniel Pope and Tom Rouen. 
But it was Vanover who made it academic. With the score tied 10-10, he camped under a punt by Rouen, darted left and tightroped down the sideline, eluding four would-be tacklers for his third career punt return for a score and first since 1997. 
The Chiefs missed the extra point when Pope, the holder. couldn't handle the snap, but Denver ( 4-8) failed to move past its own 46 on two subsequent possessions. 
Kansas City, which punished Denver with 188 yards on the ground in a 26-10 win earlier this season, finished with 177 rushing. Tony Richardson had a career-high 80 yards, and Donnell Bennett added 66. 
Kansas City's Elvis Grbac completed 20 of 34 passes for 183 yards and a touchdown, and Denver's Brian Griese was 20-of-36 for 227 yards. 
Chargers 23, Browns 10 
Playing without their two All­Pro defenders, linebacker Junior Seau and safety Rodney Harrison, the Chargers beat the Browns, their first win since defeating Seattle on Oct. 17. 
San Diego (5-7) got short scoring runs from Kenny Bynum and rookie Jermaine Fazande, and three field goals from John Carney. Cleveland (2-11) lost its third straight 

game. · With a tough final month that 
includes road games against 
Seattle, Miami and Denver, this 
was the Chargers' best shot to 
end their losing streak. 
They did it without Seau, a late scratch because of a strained stomach muscle and a rib injury, and Harrison, who has missed seven straight games with a shoulder injury. Harrison was expected to return but tore scar tissue in practice on Friday. 
The Chargers also were with­out defensive tackle Norman Hand, cornerback Terrance Shaw and running back Natrone Means, who's now missed six games. 
Raiders 30, Seahawks 21 
Overcoming a broken wrist and a strained thigh, Rich Gannon threw scoring passes of 14 and 5 yards to Tim Brown as the Oakland Raiders took a 17-point lead in the second quarter and held on for a 30-21 win Sunday over the Seahawks. 
Seattle {8-4) was undermined by turnovers for the second straight week. Ricky Watters fumbled twice and Jon Kitna, who had five interceptions and a fumble in a 16-3 loss to Tampa Bay last week, was picked off twice by the Raiders 
(6-6}. 

Cardinals 21, Eagles 17 
Jake Plummer, ineffective nearly all afternoon in his return to the Arizona starting lineup, directed the Cardinals to two touchdowns in the final 
4:31 as they rallied to beat Philadelphia 21-17 Sunday for their fourth victory in a row. 
Frank Sanders' diving catch of Plummer's 38-yard pass just inches from the goal line set up Plummer's 1-yard sneak for the winning touchdown with 57 seconds to play. The officials reviewed the play to make sure Sanders was inbounds, and the catch was upheld. 
With the victory, Arizona (6­
6) moved within a game of first place in the NFC East going into next week's game at Washington. 
Packers 35, Bears 19 
As the wind howled and a cold rain swept across Soldier Field. Green Bay rookie De'Mond Parker told himself lo just deal with the conditions. llis chance to play had finally arrived. 
Parker, playing because lead­ing rusher and receiver Dorsey Levens was sidelined by cracked ribs, also focused on finding the end zone in the final quarter. 
Green Bay rookie DeOMond Parker ran for a pair of touch­downs as the Packers handled the weather and beat the Chicago Bears for their third straight victory. 
Late in the second quarter, Bears punter Todd Sauerbrun droppod the ball as he was try­ing to kick it, and Packers defensive end Keith McKenzie scooped it up and ran 45 yards for the touchdown with 1:09 left in the first half, giving the Packers a 21-10 lead. 
Giants 41, Jets 28 
Kerry Collins hit Amani Toomer for three touchdowns and ran for another as the Giants routed their local rivals, with the most points scored by the Giants in four years. 
The Giants (6-6) set a season high for yards (490) while going 13-for-19 on third downs in breaking a three-game slide and keeping their playoff hopes alive. The Jets (4-8) were over­matched from the outset, even yielding 111 yards rushing on 38 carries lo rookie Joe Montgomery, making his first start. 
Falcons 35, Saints 12 
Chris Chandler threw for two touchdowns and ran for anoth­er as the Falcons snapped a three-game losing streak by routing the even-more-hapless Saints.

minutes by keeping the pres­sure on the Irish, but the defense held strong. as it had all night, allowing few scoring opportunities. The closest that the visitors came to scoring came after Irish defenseman Evan Nielsen was sent to the penalty hox for interference. Michigan State pulled its goalie to give them a 6-on-4 advantage. With only 20 sec­onds left in the game, left wing Brian Maloney fired a shot off the cross bar and the defense was able to hold off the Spartans. 
Irish goalie Tony Zasowski made the key saves when the Irish needed them, stopping 15 shots in the final period. He had 24 saves for the entire game, getting his second shutout of the season and Notre Dame's first against Michigan State since February 24, 1978. The win also marked the first time that the Irish defeated the Spartans at home since 1982. 
"It was an enormous win," said Irish head coach Dave Poulin. "That was the best all­around game we've played this year." 
The first period proved to be a defensive battle, as both teams had only one shot on goal for the first 10 minutes. Despite the few shots. Michigan State spent most of the first period in the Notre Dame zone. The Irish defense was able to keep the Spartans away from the net, blocking and deflecting most of their attempts on goal. Michigan 
"It was an enormous win. That was the best all­around game we've played all year." 
Dave Poulin Irish hockey head coach 
State did beat Zasowski on one shot, ,vhen John-Michael Liles scored with 1: 26 left in the period, but the goal was waived off because 1\ISU center Shawn Horcoff was in the crease. 
"We wanted to keep their offense on the perimeter as much as possible," said Poulin. "It was important to keep their defenders out of the offense. Borega and Clark were very good on defense, our whole defense was really good." 
In the second period the Irish came out more aggres­sive on offense and outs.hot the Spartans in the period 11-3. Connor Dunlop and David Inman each had good scoring opportunities, but neither team was able to find the net. 
"They'll give you a certain amount of space on offense, and we took the space they gave us," said Poulin. "It's tough to p-enetrate their defense." 
The play of the Notre Dame defense and Zasowski gave the Irish a much needed two points in the CCHA. "What was most encouraging were all the different facets of the game we played well. Dolder played solid for us all night, and was huge going to the net for the goal. Zasowski was huge the last couple of minutes, espe­cially on the penalty kill. We need to enjoy this for a bit and experience the feeling of knowing what went in to that game. We want that feeling every night, some nights you'll get beat, but we need to enjoy it and learn from what it feels like." 
On Sunday, Michigan State scored in every period on their way to a 4-1 victory. The offensive outburst and the strong goaltending of Joe Blackburn continued Notre Dame's season-long drop-offs in the second games of CCHA series, with a 3-2-1 mark in the opening games and just a 1-4-1 record in the second games. A win on Sunday at Munn Ice Arena would have given the Irish a chance to move into seventh place in the CCHA. 
The Spartans scored twice within a 23 second span in the first period and· never looked back, adding a goal in each of the next two periods. Blackburn's 24 saves in the game now give him 95 saves in his career against Notre Dame. 
The Irish, who failed to con­vert on all eight of their power-play chances, quickly responded to MSU's third goal of the night, on a frantic triple-rebound sequence at the 
11:55 mark of the second peri­od. Senior center Ben Simon started the series with a shot from the left circle that Blackburn knocked into the crowded slot area. Senior right wing Joe Dusbabek sent the puck back on the net, but Blackburn skated out for the save. 
Dusbabek then sent the sec­ond rebound through the legs of the charging Blackburn but defenseman Brad Hodgins was guarding the goal line and nudged the puck back into the slot. Irish junior left wing Jay Kopischke was crashing the net and smacked the puck past Hodgins for his third career goal and first since scoring in a 7-2 loss to Michigan on Jan. 30, 1998. 


The Irish continue play this weekend with a two game series against UMass-Amherst. Notre Dame hosts the two games Friday and Saturday at 
7:05 p.m. at the Joyce Center. 
WORLD CUP SOCCER 
198 countries sign up for 2002 World Cup 
Associated Press 
TOKYO 
A record 198 countries entered the qualifying draw for the 2002 World Cup, with only North Korea and four other countries skipping 

... the soccer showcase. North Korea's decision means there is no chance it will play host to some games or share a team with South Korea, said Lennert Johansson, the chief organizer of World Cup events for soccer's rul­ing body. The 2002 World Cup will be staged by Japan and South Korea. The preliminary draw is Tuesday in Tokyo. The other four nations to miss the world's most watched sports event are: Afghanistan, Niger, Burundi and Papua New Guinea. 
The qualifying rounds for the World Cup in France in 1998 had 174 countries. 
France, the defending champion, and the two hosts automatically qualify for the 32-team field. 
Europe will provide at least 13 other qualifiers from 50 nations. With past champions England and Italy not among the seeded teams, one could conceivably end up in the same group with three-time champion Germany. 
European teams will be placed in nine groups, with each winner advancing. Playoffs among eight runners-up will determine four other spots. Another runner-up will face an Asian team in a play­off. 
Asia will provide two or three qualifiers, plus Japan and South 
Korea. 
South American nations will not be included in the draw since thev play a league system with the top four qualifying directly and the fifth facing a team from Oceania in a playoff. 
Africa will provide five teams, coming through two rounds of group qualifications. 
The most complicated system involves the group from North and Central America and the Caribbean. The United States, Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica do not enter the qualifications until the semifinal round. 
Johansson, also the head of Europe's governing soccer body, said one of the 2002 semifinals will be in Saitama, Japan, and the other at a South Korean site to be decided. The final will be in Yokohama, near Tokyo. 
Johansson said there will be ran­dom drug tests at all games for the 32-team tournament. Testing also will be conducted during qualifica­tions, with FIFA aiming to test players from at least one game in a given round in each confederation. 
Among the problems still to be ironed out are ticket allocations ­Japan wants more -slow market­ing and a decision on starting time to satisfy European viewers. 
In another matter, FIFA, the world's governing body, said it is investigating reports that Brazil used three overage players in an under-17 competition. 
If found guilty, Brazil, the only four-time champion, could face a two-year ban and miss the World Cup altogether.

Goolsby makes oral commitment 
By TIM CASEY Sports W rirer 

Bob Davie was enjoying dinner at the College Football Hall of Fame on Saturday night with some current players, coaches and high school seniors making their official recruiting visits to Notre Dame. 
The enjoyment turned into excitement when Mike Goolsby approached Davie. 
"I went up to [defensive coordinator] Coach [Greg] Mattison first to tell him [that I committed to the Irish]," Goolsby said. "He said it wasn't official until I told Coach Davie. So I went up to coach Davie and told him. He seemed excited." 
Davie had everv reason to have a smile on his face. 
Saturdays haven't been too kind to the Irish in recent weeks. Yet on the first Saturday in December. consecutive season-ending losses to Tennessee, Pittsburgh, Roston College and Stanford seemed a distant memory. 
Though Goolsby will not officially be a member of the Class of 2004 until he signs a letter of intent on February 2nd, the first day recruits can sign, the 6­foot-3, 230-pound line­backer from Joliet, Ill., made an oral commitment to attend Notre Dame on 
"He's an impact play­er. He's somebody that can come in very early and perform well." 
Mike Frank recruiting expert on Mike Goolsby's ability 
Saturday. 
The Irish coaching staff has had its eye on Goolsby for over a year. 
"He's a guy that Notre Dame targeted as a priori­ty guy from the day they saw him," said Mike Frank, a recruiting expert from Omaha, Nebraska who runs the Irishre port.com website. "He has vast potential." 
That potential was never more apparent than this fall when Goolsby led Joliet Catholic to the Illinois 4A state title. While the Irish were preparing for Stanford, Goolsby was in Champaign. Ill., celebrat­ing with his teammates after a 48-13 victory over Metamora in the University of Illinois' Memorial Stadium. 
For the season, Goolsby recorded 74 tackles, three sacks, eight caused fum­bles and four fumble recoveries. In addition to being named first team All-State, Goolsby is rated the 13th-best high sr,hool senior in the country, regardless of position, by 
recruiting expert Tom Lemming. 
"He's an impact player," Frank said. "He's very, very fast -a disruptive player with incredible acceleration. He's some­body that can come in and play very early and per­form well." 
While immediate playing time and a chance to com­pete for a starting position next fall were important to Goolsby, the most lasting impression of Notre Dame came in its commitment to Goolsby as a student, not just as an athlete. 
"They've been my favorite all throughout," Goolsby said. "But the main thing that got me was that they kept stress­ing the next 40 years instead of just the next four. I liked that kind of commitment. Coming out with a Notre Dame degree is special." 
IRISH NOTES:

"We're playing sort of un­Kansaslike," said Williams, who is 16.-0 against OVC teams. "We've always been a team that's been intelligent. That's played smart basketball and just played with a lot of savvy and a lot of pose. 
"Right now we're getting by on talent. We're definitely not getting by on coaching, and we're definitely not getting by playing intelligently." 
The Jayhawks, playing in Murphy Center because of Williams' friendship with Middle Tennessee coach Handy Wiel. his former col­league at North Carolina, had trouble putting away the Blue Raiders.

With flowers from her team and a kiss from her son, Pat Summitt celebrated a victory for the 700th time in her unmatched coaching career. 
Semeka Randall's 19 points led five Lady Vols in double figures as No. 3 Tennessee beat No. 25 Wisconsin 85-62 Sunday, giving Summitt her 700th earner victory. 
Wearing a wide-collared purple suit and hor customary glower during the game. Summitt was beaming by the final buzzer. The 47-year-old coach became the youngest in college basketball to win 700 games and just the second woman to do so. 
ult feels like I've been watch­ing a whole lot of basketball in my life," Summitt said...I thought we played a great game, and the fact that it hap­pened with the way we played in this game, that's the most important thing." 
The Kohl Center crowd of 11,861, the fifth-largest ever to see a Wisconsin women's game, stood and cheered Summitt as her players gath­ered around for a giant boar hug and presented her with a bouquet of yellow roses. Her 9-year-old son Tyler also was on hand, cheering from the bench. 
"It's special. and you can reflect on it a little, but tomor­row's another workday," Summitt said. "This season isn't about how many wins I can get. It's about how we grow as a team." 
Summitt joined 16 men's basketball coaches and one women's coach -Texas' Jody Conradt, who got her 730th 
career victory Saturday -in

Winning is becoming habitu­al for the 11 th-ranknd Notre Dame women's basketball L!iam. T lw Irish enjoyed an nxtrnnwly succnssf'ul weekend, upending ninth-ranked North C11rolina by a ·score of 99-86, and Liberty 85-68 .en route to bning crowned champions or Lhe Wachovia \,\'omen's Invitational Tournam1mt. 
0ncn again, the Irish women worn sparknd by Urn spectacu­lar rlny of froshman sensation Alicia Hatay, and tournament MVP Buth Hilny. With the out­conw of' both contests still very much in doubt at thn hall'way point. Lim inside-outside duet of' Hiley and Hatay stepped to lhn fordront and took charge of thn ganrn·s outcome. 
I l was Hatay who led the ups1~t charge over the Tar IInnis, n('tting a earner-high :12 points, whiln shooting a scorching 80 p1irrnnt from the floor. With lwr team up by a S{'.Off\ of' 42-39 at the half, Halay turnnd a close game into a roul hy scoring l :~ points in a 2:l-4 run to open tlw second halt'. Hatay's big day saw lrnr drain six thnw pointers and grab six rdrnunds. 
Willi Hilny !wing clou­blntPanwd on tlw insidP, llatay was given snveral good looks at the bask!'t. and foiling lo disappoint, she made good on six of her eight attempts from behind the arc. 
Ericka Haney added 18 points and 14 rebounds in the win, while her backcourt mate, Niele Ivey, added a double­double of her own, tallying 17 points in addition to handing out 13 assists. 
Motivated by their upset win over the Tar Heels, the Irish came out looking to bring llome a tournament title as they met Liberty in the final. This time, with Liberty justifi­ably leery of Ratay's outside shooting touch, Riley saw the middle opeu up for her. For much of thfl game the Irish star had her way on the inside, taking over the game as the second half opened. 
Hiley poured in nine of her game high :l2 points to spark the Irish un a 13-6 run as the second half got underway. Single-handedly turning a close game in her team's favor, Riley's strong play gave the Irish a 52-42 !!lad they would never relinquish. 
Draining 12 or 14 shots from the floor, Hilny made lifo mis­erablo for the Lady Flames of Liberty, who saw their record fall to 2-3. The Irish, mean­while improved to 4-1 with their victories over the week­end, and return to the court against interstate rival and No. 20 Purdue Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.

IRISH INSIGHT

foot on the 
court. 
As the season winds along, the younger athletes learn the 100 percent effort it takes from start to finish to win a collegiate game, come to play as a team rather than as indi­viduals and stop making the mistakes common to rookies. 
"I have to be the emotional leader of this team right now until we grow up a little bit and mature," first-year head coach Matt Doherty said. "I think they did lay it on the line. Guys were all over the place, diving on loose balls. I have to grade the effort, not so much the results." 
Sophomores Troy Murphy, David Graves and Harold Swanagan have started every game for the Irish this season, along with senior Jimmy Dillon. Freshman Matt Carroll replaced senior Martin Ingelsby Saturday to earn his first collegiate start. Freshman Jere Macura also 

.. played for 26 minutes in the game against Vanderbilt. While Murphy, Graves and Swanagan all played signifi­cant time for the Irish last year, their role has changed somewhat this year. No longer freshmen, Graves ,and Murphy in particular are looked to as the go-to players on the hard­wood, the top two Irish scor­ers and rebounders. Murphy, picked in the pre­season to be one of the top players in the nation, is often double and triple-teamed, leaving him to be a team leader and find ways to break open. Murphy is averaging nearly 25 points per game and more than 11 rebounds, and has posted a double-double in six of seven games this year.

'Td rather score zero points and win. No mat­ter how many points I had, we still lost. " 
David Graves Irish forward 
"Look at Troy getting the mess beat out of him and still competing, and he hit those two foul shots to put H into overtime," Doherty said. "Those guys are banging in there. He kept his composure well." 
Graves is scoring 15.3 points per game, pulling down 5.1 rebounds and averaging three assists. His potential may be largely untapped, as he had the best game of his career against Vanderbilt with 33 points and 12 rebounds to lead Notre Dame in both cate­gories. At one point, Graves hit nine points straight for the Irish to close the scoring gap from a 66-58 Irish deficit to within one at 68-67 Saturday. 
However, non~ of his per­sonal statistics matter to him if the team falls short of victo­ry. 
'Td rather score zero points and win," Graves said. "No matter how many points I had, we still lost." 
Doherty recognized the dif­ference between a young team like this year's Irish and some of the experienced squads he helped coach while at Kansas. 
"At Kansas we had Jacques Vaughn and Jerod Haase, and if we lost or didn't have great effort, they took care of it," Doherty said. "Vaughn and Haase were two amazing com­petitors and leaders, and I think we have guys capable of that, but there's a comfort zone. I think here's their [the players'] comfort zone to begin with and we've moved it towards the middle, and I want it to go all the way to the other side." 
The Irish seem to be on their way to that comfort zone. They kept the number of turnovers down to 16 against Vanderbilt, whereas at the beginning of the season, they posted more than 16 in the first half alone. 
Carroll and Macura are two up-and-coming contributors for Notre Dame this year. 
Carroll, a 6-foot-6 guard, hardly played at all in the first game against Ohio State. By the match against Vanderbilt, he had worked his way into the starting lineup, scoring 18 points in the losing effort for the Irish. His sharp-shooting touch behind the arc makes him a hot target when the Irish need a quick three-point­er. Macura is averaging about four rebounds per game. 
The effort level also seems to be rising, with several mad scrambles for a loose ball against Vanderbilt, and improving coverage on defense. 
In their first three losses this year, the Irish dug themselves into a hole early by allowing their opponent to take a large lead. Against Vanderbilt, Notre Dame came out ready to play and was ahead much of the first half before dropping to eight points behind at half­time. 
"As we grow from these experiences and they get more comfortable with the style of play and the demands that we place on them, their comfort zone will change," Doherty said. "We've got to develop new habits. and it's hard to develop new habits. They're being developed slowly but surely." 
The inexperience of the Irish showed somewhat in the first period as they were unable to contain Commodores star Dan Langhi. However, in the sec­ond period and overtime, they held him to eight points. 
Although Notre Dame's record has fallen to 3-4, no one is making the mistake of counting the Irish out as an impact squad in the NCAA. 
"The best thing is our kids hurt," Doherty said. 'Tm more excited about this team right now than I have been since our game at Ohio State."

Ohio State." The Irish struggled early and trailed 42-34 at the half. 
"I thought defensively we didn't do a good job guarding that lateral screen," Doherty said. "It got [Greg} LaPointe some shots and it got Langhi some shots. I thought in ihe first half Langhi was unbeliev­able." 
The Irish. however. over­came a double-digit deficit in the second half and fought their way back into the game. 
"We knew at halftime that we could compete with this team," sophomore forward David Graves said. "They hit some big shots in the first half. We name out in the second half and kept fighting. The one thing we did do is play hard. We got this into overtime. We had a chance to win, but the chips fell where they did." 
Murphy hit a three pointer with 1:30 left in regulation and made two free throws· with nine seconds left to tie the game for the first time in the half and force the over­time.

with 27 points, including four free throws in overtime. Greg LaPointe and James Strong added 14. Graves led all scor­ers with a career high 33 points. He connected on 11-of­15 shot and knocked down 5­of-6 threes. 
''I'd rather score zero points and win, said Graves who also pulled down 12 boards. "No matter how many points I had, we still lost, so rm pretty upset right now." 
Murphy scored l 7 points and had 12 boards. It was the first time Murphy was held to under 20 this season. Freshman Matt Carroll had 18 off the bench, including a three in overtime that gave Notre Dame a four point lead. 
After a 3-0 start. the Irish have now dropped four straight. Vanderbilt improves tQ 4-0 and snapped its 12­game losing streak on the road. Notre Dame hosts Valparaiso on Wednesday. 
"We have a hell of a stretch coming up," Doherty said. " I think man for man, Vanderbilt is just as good as Indiana's starting lineup. Valpo is going to be very good too. They don't have the names of Maryland or Arizona, but they're darn good teams with darn good coaches."

Janine Turner, Steven Wtight, Dave 
Brubeck, Wally Cox 
Happy Birthday: Get moving and don't look back. Your creative ideas need to be given a chance. Finish what you start and you won't be sorry. Take the initiative and make the changes you've been contemplat­ing. You will have to be well-orga­nized and precise in all that you do to make the most of your time this year. Your numbers: 3, 19, 24, 31, 36,43 
ARIES (March 21-April 19): It's best to take work home. You will find that someone you live with may not be too pleased, but you really can't do anything about it if you want a few extra days off during Christmas break. 000 
TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Pri­vate discussions regarding money or ideas will be favored today. You should be putting money into long­term investments for future use or to ensure security in years to come. 
000 . GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Your emotions will not be that easy to control. New love interests will be intense but rewarding. Look into unusual forms of entertainment if you wish to dazzle your new companion. 000 CANCER (June 21-July 22): Get trivial matters out of the way. Deal with agencies and institutions that can update your personal docu­
ments. Partnerships will be excep­tionally good if you pamper your 
mate.00000 
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): You're all booked up. Don't make social promises that you can't possibly keep. You need to spend some time with_the youngsters in your family. 
EUGENIA LAST 
Overtime will bring you the extra 
cash you need. 00 
VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): You 
must allow your loved ones the free­

them, you will only cause bad feel­
ings. Concentrate on yourself for a 
change. 0000 
LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): Don't 
count on getting support from your 
family. Added responsibilities will 
make your life difficult. Try to help 
others help themselves rather than 
doing all tfie work for them. 000 
SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): 
Don't get involved in disputes; you will damage your reputation with friends and employers alike. Work diligently without complaints and rewards will be yours. 000

Irish split two games with fifth-ranked Spartans 
By MATT OLIVA Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's weekend series against Michigan State marked a crucia.l point in the Irish schedule. Two games against the league leader would determine whether the irish would climb up in the CCHA standings or fall further. It was a home-and-home series between a Spartan team that was 1l-4-0 (Hl­2-0 CCHA), ranked fifth in the country. but losers in three of their last four games, and a Notre name team that improved its record to 5-7-2 (3-5-2 COIA) after a slow start, but had not defeated Michigan State at home in their last 10 meetings. 
The Irish came oul of the weekend with two points, winning the first game at home on Saturday night, before traveling to East Lansing for Sunday night's game. The Irish dropped the second game to the Spartans 4-1. The win on Saturday was the team's second strong showing versus a nationally-ranked opponent in_ the last eight days, after a hard­fought battle in a 2-1 loss at current No. 4 New Hampshire on Nov. 27. 
Saturday night the Irish defeated Michigan State 1-0, on a third-period goal by junior right wing Ryan Dolder. The goal came at the 14 minutes, 56 seconds into the period, when Notre Dame defenseman Ryan Clark's fired a shot that was deflected toward the front of the net. Dolder then beat Spartan goaltender Ryan Miller for his third goal of the season, giving the Irish the lead with five minutes left in the game. Brett Henning and Clark were credited with the assist on the game-winner.

ref. But I didn't feel it was a close call. I thought it was and one and I was getting ready to shoot a free throw. 
"[It wasI unbelievable," Murphy continued. "It should have been a no call, if any­thing." 
Murphy got the no call on the play before. He pump faked in the lane, got his defender in the air, leaned in and missed the shot. The ref didn't blow his whistle, but when Murphy got his owQ rebound and scored, the whistle blew. 
"I was (fouled on the first shot]." Murphy said. "That's what I initially tried to do. I tried to pump fake and Jean in and get the foul. That obviously didn't go. And then I got the rebound and I was under the basket and he thought it was a charge. It was an interesting call." 
Following the call, the Commodores' Dan Langhi was fouled and made two free throws to give Vandy an 85-82 lead. Murphy had a chance to tie it, but his three point attempt missed and Vanderbilt went on to win. It was Notre Dame's sec­ond straight overtime game and for the second straight time, the Irish faced defeat. 
"Our kids did lay it on the line, but we came up short," head coach Matt Doherty said. "The best thing is our kids hurt. They hurt. There's tears in here and that's great. I'm more excited about this team right now than I have been since our game at Ohio State."
