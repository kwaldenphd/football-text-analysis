Journalist-in-residence Smith arrives on can1pus 
By JENNIFER METZ News Writer 
Terrence Smith was on cam­pus last year for a lecture named after his father, the famous sports writer Red Smith. Today, Terrence Smith is back at Notre Dame because of his own accom­plishments. 
Smith, this year's Gallivan Program for Journalism, Ethics and Democracy's jour­nalist-in-residence, will appear at several functions today and this week in the first of two weeks Smith will spend at Notre Dame this year. 
After graduating from Notre Dame in 1960, Smith spent 20 years as a national and for­eign correspondent for The New York Times, and 13 years at CBS News. Currently, Smith a special correspondent for The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. 
Smith came back to Notre Dame last spring for the annual Red Smith Lecture, which was given by Ken Auletta, media correspondent for The New Yorker. At the time, Smith said, he spoke with University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh, who suggested that Smith return to campus for more than the weekend. 
The journalist-in-residence program is planned for two weeks but due to scheduling problems, his second week

Education official to visit ND 
Swedish official will address Student Senate 
By MEGHAN WONS News Writer 
Students are often able to engage in discussion about problems and take action to effect change on both a local and global scale, but when looking at the problem of sustainable development, just how much power lies in edu­cation? 
Carl Lindberg, Sweden's deputy vice minister for edu­cation, will address this question at tonight's meeting of the Student Senate. Besides his role in the Swedish government, Lindberg is a member of the leadership for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ini­tiative concerning "education for sustainable develop­ment," said Lena Wallensteen of the Kroc Institute. 
She said Lindberg has been "instrumental in bringing about compulsory inclusion of 'sustainable development' education into all Swedish universities and colleges" through his role in helping to develop the Higher Education Act, which governs all Swedish institutions of higher learning.

Shappell defends SUB decision 
By KATHLEEN MCDONNELL News Writer 
A spotlight on the Student Union Board (SUB), and the con­troversy surrounding its deci­sion to exclude graduate stu­dents from the USC student tick­et lottery, was the focus of Tuesday's meeting of the Council of Representatives (COR) in LaFortune. 
Student body president Lizzi Shappell said the move was mutually agreed upon by her administration. 
"I stand behind that decision," Shappell said. "In no way are we trying to be malicious towards graduate students or treat them as less than first class citizens."

INSIDE COLUMN 
Bob Barker: 

legend 
I can imagine that almost every­one at this University who grew up within crawling distance of an American television has at one point in their life been impacted by Bob Barker. After an amazing 
Chris Wilson 
35-year run as the host of "The Price is Right," Barker will be Sports Wzre greeting his final Editor contestant in June. 
When I was growing up, a sick day from school meant heavy doses of Benadryl, chicken soup, a mound of blankets and a heavy dose of "The Price is Right" at 11:00 a.m. 
I'm sure many of you experienced that same consistency, with Rod Roddy (rest in peace}, the Barker Beauties, the giant wheel and Showcase Showdowns always help­ing to heal you from whatever ill­ness had overtaken your young immune system. 
There are lots of critical, nasty people that I read or listen to on a daily basis, but I don't think I've ever seen or heard a negative thing about Barker. 
Is it the way old women, co-eds and servicemen all find him to be the most loveable person in the world? Other than the occasional rumblings of him taking liberties with the Beauties, he could do no wrong. 
I feel that Barker probably could have appeared on "The Aristo­crats," put all of those comics to shame and your grandma would still wear a bright red T-shirt that said "I Came 3,000 Miles To Kiss Bob!". 
He didn't want a piece of Adam Sandler, he wanted the whole thing. 
When Pope John Paul II passed away freshman year, we all became privy to the process needed to choose a successor. 
I thought the same process should have been set up to select Barker's replacement, should the unthink­able have happened. He's the elder statesman of both daytime televi­sion and game shows -a double whammy of cultural literacy that every American recognizes. He helps little old ladies spin the wheel and consoles the poor people who just saw the Plinko chips of life bounce the wrong way. He's that extra grandfather you always want­ed, who just happens to know the price of those dried dates. 
But he's going out on top, retiring on June 7 at age 83. The silver fox's charm and grace will not soon be forgotten, and we can only hope that a suitable replacement (in the name of all that is holy, keep Ryan Seacrest away from the oversized microphone) will be found to carry on the torch of pricing games and "The correct retail price is ... ". 
Bob's legacy will never be forgot­ten, and it would be wrong to end this column with anything save his eternal sign-off: "Help control the pet population. Have your pets spayed or neutered."

Happy Birthday to you, you live in a zoo 
ATLANTA -Three-year­old Cooper Lund's rendi­tion of "Happy Birthday" included lines about living in a zoo and looking like a monkey, but the birthday boy and girl weren't insulted. 
Kali and Kazi just romped about their African rain forest play­ground, chewing on fruit and swinging from vines. The twin western lowland gorillas' first birthday was celebrated at Zoo Atlanta on Tuesday, a significant hallmark in their young lives. 
About 20 percent of gorillas do not live through their first year, especially as a pair. Kali and Kazi are the only gorilla twins in the world born in cap­tivity to be raised solely by their mother. 
Smell of pizza leads deputy to suspects 
COLUMBUS, Ind. -A sheriff's deputy sniffed out two men suspected of rob­bing a pizza delivery woman when he caught a whiff of pepperoni and sausage pizza at their home. 
Bartholomew County Sheriff's Deputy Jimmy Green was searching the area where the delivery woman was robbed for potential witnesses Sunday night when he grew suspicious of one man, Maj. Mark Garbett said. 
"It just didn't seem right to Jimmy, and he wanted to take it a step further and went to the witness' residence. That's when Jimmy smelled the aroma of pizza," Garbett said. ''I'm sure our K-9 unit wouldn't have hit on the pizza."

and education ministries in 2005, Lindberg addressed UNESCO's proposed key roles of education. 
"Education is the primary agent of transformation towards sustainable develop­ment, increasing peoples' capacities to transform their vision for society into reality," Lindberg said. "Education for sustainable development is a process of learning how to make decisions that consider the long term future of the equity, economy and ecology of all communities." 
The speech emphasized his belief that education for sus­tainable development must be "embedded in the whole cur­riculum," not viewed as a separate subject. Lindberg also said critical thinking and problem solving need to be emphasized in sustainable development education so students can gain confidence in "addressing the dilemmas and challenges of sustainable development." 
Lindberg's views about the power of education and the importance of social con­sciousness echo those of doc­tors Paul Farmer and Miriam Opwonya and economist Jeffrey Sachs -panelists for the Notre Dame Forum, "The Global Health Crisis: Forging Solutions, Effecting Change," held on campus this fall. 
Lindberg's attendance at the Student Senate meeting is sponsored by student body president Lizzi Shappell and student body vice president, Bill Andrichik.

oped a compromise that would hopefully satisfy the graduate students, Vassel said. 
Though they are still not included in the lottery, gradu­ate students will now have sole access to leftover tickets that are not purchased by Nov. 8. Normally these tickets are open to the entire Notre Dame community. 
But they will have exclusive access for one day only, Schramm said, and then left­overs will be available to all members of the Notre Dame community. 
Kenney was unhappy that graduate students were not included in the compromise decision, while Schramm said the offering is merely an 
attempt to "placate" angry grad students. 
"It doesn't change our posi­tion whatsoever.... We don't want leftovers if by chance there is a random leftover ticket. ... What if there are no leftover tickets? Then we have nothing," Keeney said. 
The compromise is not the end or the road, Vassel said. 
"It is my hope and my goal ... to sit down with all parties involved and see if we can craft a more fair and more comprehensive policy on this for future years," he said. 
That meeting would proba­bly take place next semester and it's possible, Vassel said, that graduate students could regain access to the lottery next year. 
However, the situation is sticky. Holy Cross and Saint Mary's students have been excluded from the away game ticket lottery since 2003, and 

despite backlash from those groups, the policy never changed. 
Until it does, Kenney will not be satisfied. 
"There's no way graduate students will be allowed to be in [today's] ticket lottery.... But if we get into a bowl game, we'd like to be included in that lottery," she said.

Former South African president dies 
CAPE TOWN, South Africa-P.W. Botha, the apartheid-era president who led South Africa through its worst racial violence and deepest international isolation, died Tuesday. He was 90. 
Botha died at his home on the southern Cape coast at 8 p.m., according to the South African Press Association. "Botha died at home, peace­fully," Capt. Frikkie Lucas was quoted as say­ing. 
The African National Congress issued a statement expressing condolences and wishing his family "strength and comfort at this diffi­cult time." 
Nicknamed the "Old Crocodile" for his feared temper and sometimes ruthless manner, Botha served as head of the white racist government from 1978 to 1989. 
Protesters erect barricades again 
OAXACA, Mexico -Some of the barricades torn down by federal police went back up Tuesday as protesters regrouped, and at least one federal official acknowledged that this city besieged by striking teachers and anarchists remained outside government control. 
Federal police held the central square, or Zocalo, but schools and most businesses remained closed and residents tired of five months of paralyzing strikes looked on in dis­may as protesters used debris, stones and sand bags to block recently cleared streets. 
Demonstrators who flocked to the capital city of 275,000 are demanding the resignation of Gov. Ulises Ruiz, whom they accuse of oppressing dissent and rigging the 2004 elec­tions. Many residents, including several thou­sand who marched in protest Tuesday, just want to return to life as it was before the strikes began in May.

More money to go to Iraqi forces 
WASHINGTON -Defense Secretary Donald 
H. Rumsfeld on Tuesday endorsed a proposal to spend at least $1 billion to expand the size and accelerate the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces. 
While the plan still must get final approval from the White House and the money would have to be approved by Congress, Rumsfeld's support underscores the Bush administra­tion's effort to shift more of the burden of Iraq's security to that country's forces. 
''I'm very comfortable with the increases they've proposed and the accelerations in achievement of some of their targets," Rumsfeld told reporters at the Pentagon, not­ing that the Iraqi government and Gen. George Casey, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, both recommended expanding Iraqi forces.

Man convicted of killing IU student 
MARTINSVILLE, Ind. -A jury needed only about 50 minutes on Monday to find a 31-year­old handyman guilty in the death of Indiana University student Jill Behrman more than six years ago. 
The verdict gave an answer to questions that had lingered since the 19-year-old Behrman dis­appeared in May 2000 while on a bicycle ride near Bloomington. 
While prosecutors presented no physical evi­dence or eyewitnesses to link John Myers II to Behrman, her parents said the verdict gave them some relief as they thought about their daughter. 

North Korea agrees to talk again 
Nation says it will resume multi-party negotiations on its nuclear program 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -In a surprise turnabout, North Korea agreed Tuesday to return to six-nation disar­mament talks just three weeks after rattling the world by conducting an atomic bomb test. The breakthrough came after pressure from China and a 
U.S. offer to discuss finan­cial penalties already in place. 
President Bush cautiously welcomed the deal and thanked the Chinese for brokering it. But he said the agreement wouldn't side­track U.S. efforts to enforce sanctions adopted by the 
U.N. Security Council to punish Pyongyang for its Oct. 9 nuclear test. 
He said there was still "a lot of work to do" and the 
U.S. would send teams to the region "to make sure that the current United Nations Security Council resolution is enforced." 
The ultimate goal is "a North Korea that abandons her nuclear weapons pro­grams and her nuclear weapons in a verifiable fashion in return for a bet­ter way forward for her people," the president said.

IN BRIEF 
Israel Discount Bank gets hefty fine 
WASHINGTON-Israel Discounf Bank of New York is paying a $12 million fine for allegedly deficient money laundering controls that allowed illegal Brazilian money transmitters to move $2.2 billion through its offices over the past five years, regulators said Tuesday. 
The civil fine was levied by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the New York State Banking Department. The agencies said the bank violat­ed federal and state anti-money-laundering laws by failing to put in place an adequate pro­gram to detect and report money laundering and other suspicious activity in accounts held by non-U.S. citizens. 
Israel Discount Bank of New York, which is chartered in New York state and insured by the FDIC, is the commercial banking subsidiary of Israel Discount Bank Ltd. and the largest Israeli bank operating abroad. It neither admitted nor denied the regulators' allegations in agreeing to pay the fine. 
The $12 million is in addition to $8.5 million that the bank agreed to pay in a related agree­ment last December with the Manhattan district attorney's office. 
LA Daily News fires Rafter publishing 
LOS ANGELES -The company that publishes the Los Angeles Daily News has fired its publisher and announced it is cutting 21 jobs at the paper, including four in the newsroom. 
Tracy Rafter, who served as publisher for more than two years, was replaced by John C. McKeon, president and chief executive of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group, which owns the Daily News and seven other daily newspapers in Southern California that are operated by Denver-based MediaNews Group Inc. 
The changes were announced Monday by George Riggs, president and chief executive offi­cer of the California Newspaper Partnership, which publishes newspapers throughout the state and is owned by MediaNews Group, Gannett Co. and Stephens Media. It was reported in Tuesday's edition of the Daily News. 
The moves are "part of an overall plan to better adapt our business cost structure to the funda­mental changes that are under way in the pub­lishing industry," Riggs said in a statement.

Investigators question convicted arsonists 
Deliberately set fire burns 63 square miles 
Associated Press CABAZON, Calif. Investigators looking for the arsonist who set a wildfire that killed four firefighters and burned 63 square miles interviewed convicted arson­ists Tuesday and picked over the spot where the blaze start­ed. At the crime scene, investi­gators planted blue, red and yellow flags attached to wire stakes to mark the locations of possible evidence. Part of the charred hillside was marked by a grid of pegs and string. Authorities said the fire was deliberately set early Thursday at the base of a slope in Cabazon, west of Palm Springs, as fierce winds blew through the region. Before firefighters contained it Monday, the blaze scorched 40,200 acres and destroyed 34 homes and 20 outbuildings. A portion of a highway in the fire area remained closed indefinitely for repair. 
Firefighting costs reached $9.9 million, the California Department of Forestry said. 
Residents said they saw two young men leaving the area where the fire began. 
On Tuesday, authorities interviewed previously con­victed arsonists who live in the area where the blaze started, said James Crowell, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who is leading the investigation. In California, convicted arsonists must regis­ter with the county and pro­vide their address. 
A day earlier, two people were brought in for que~tion­ing and released. 
Several hours into the blaze. a U.S. Forest Service engine crew was overrun by flames while protecting a home in the San Jacinto Mountains. Killed were Mark Loutzenhiser, 43, of Idyllwild; Jason McKay, 27, of Apple Valley; Jess McLean, 27, of Beaumont; and Daniel Hoover-Najera, 20, of San Jacinto. 
The lone survivor, Pablo Cerda, 23, remained in critical condition Tuesday. 

AWOL soldier turns hiinself in to officials 
Engineer wants to avoid 2nd Iraq tour 
Associated Press 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -A soldier who fled to Canada rather than accept a second tour in Iraq turned himself over to military authorities at Fort Knox on Tuesday, his attorney said. 
Kyle Snyder, a former combat engineer, left the U.S. in April 2005 while on leave. He said he worked as a welder and at a 
children's  health  clinic  in  
Canada.  
Snyder's  lawyer,  James  

Fennerty, said he had reached a deal with Army officials to allow Snyder to be processed back into uniform at Fort Knox, southwest of Louisville, and then be dis­charged. But he said Snyder told him Tuesday afternoon the Army wants to send him back to his original unit at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., where commanders would determine his future. 
"We wouldn't have brought him back here if we knew this was going to happen," Fennerty said. 
A Fort Knox spokeswoman, Gini Sinclair, said she could not comment on Snyder's ease, but said deserters whose units are not fully deployed are returned to that unit. 
Mike Alley, a Fort Leonard Wood spokesman, said that Snyder was scheduled to be processed there but that he had no details. 
Snyder, 23, of Colorado Springs, Colo., was trained as an engineer with the 94th Corps of Engineers, but said that when he was sent to Iraq in 2004 he was put on patrol, something he said he wasn't trained to do. He said he began to turn against the war when he saw an innocent Iraqi man seriously wounded by American gunfrre.

Court weighs damages verdict 
$79.5 million punitive award considered 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON -The Supreme Court grappled Tuesday with whether to allow a $79.5 million verdict against a cigarette com­pany, a case that business groups are pointing to in asking the jus­tices to clamp down on large damage awards. 
Mayola Williams was in the crowded courtroom to hear the justices discuss the judgment that an Oregon jury imposed against Altria Group Inc.'s Philip Morris USA in connection with the death of her husband, Jesse. 
A two-pack-a-day smoker of Marlboros for 45 years, Jesse Williams died of lung cancer nine years ago. Mayola Williams fol­lowed through on a promise she said she made to her husband and sued Philip Morris, whieh makes Marlboros, for fraud. She won. 
Her lawyer, Hobert Peek, told the justices they could uphold her $79.5 million punitive dam­age award without overturning prior rulings that limitod punitive damages. Such damages are money intended to punish a defendant for its bohavior and to deter repetition. The earlier cases did not involve personal injury. 
The jury award was appropri­ate because it is punishing Philip Morris' misconduct for a decades-long "massive market­directed fraud" that misled peo­ple into thinking cigarettes were not dangerous or addictive, Peck said. 
Williams, according to his widow, never gave any crndence to surgeon general health warn­ings about smoking cigarettes because tobacco companies insisted they were safe. Only after falling sick did Williams tell his wife: "Those darn cigarette people finally did it. They were lying all the time.'' 

Philip Morris' lawyer, Andrew Frey, said a jury can punish the company only for the harm donn to Williams, not to other smok­ers. The jury should have been told explicitly that other smok­ers, no matter how tragic their stories, would have to prove their own eases, Frey said. 
"Confine the jury to its proper domain, and its domain is the case before it," he said. 
The Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers and trade associ­ations representing car and drug makers have weighed in on behalf of tighter restrictions on damage awards. 
The case also is being watched closely as a test of whether the new makeup of the Supreme Court will lead to changes in its prior rulings limiting punitive damages. 
The two newest members of the court, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, gave no indication that they would support relaxing lim­its set out in two rulings during the past 10 years. Roberts and Alito, conservative appointees of President Bush, were not on the court when those cases were decided in 1996 and 2003. 
Conservative justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas have been strong opponents of any constitutional limits on jury awards.

Lavv calls for high-court approval on death penalty cases 
Human rights groups praise reform efforts

provincial people's courts of the final say on issuing death sen­tences," the agency said. "Death penalties handed out by provincial courts must be reviewed and ratified by the Supreme People's Court." 
The change adopted by the legislature Tuesday enshrines last year's announcement by 

· the Supreme People's Court that it would start reviewing all death sentences, ending a 23­year-old practice of giving the final review to provincial courts. "It's great news. This is a big step forward for China's legal system and human rights," said Li Heping, a prominent activist lawyer. "It's going to have a psycho­logical effect on local judges when they are making deci­sions because they are going to be afraid that if they approve capital punishment, the supreme court will overrule them," Li said. Jerome Cohen, an American expert on Chinese law, called the new law "encouraging and significant" but said the next challenge will be enforcing the change. "The court has been working hard to recruit a sufficient number of judges. It's proving to be slow going," Cohen said. "That itself tells you what a huge burden it is to adequately review the large number of death sentences." Details about criteria for reviewing death sentences, as well as the standards and pro­cedures, have to be worked out, he said. In June, Xinhua said 30 judges from lower-level courts had been selected as the first trainees for death penalty tri­bunals. It said they will get three months of training and be on probation for a year before receiving a final appointment. The court was also consider­ing lawyers and law school teachers for the tribunals, Xinhua said. Complaints have been com­mon that lower-level courts mishandle death penalty cases. Last year, a woman believed murdered in the 1980s in the central province of Hunan reappeared, 16 years after the man convicted of killing her was executed. At the time of the execution, the court reportedly said the defendant confessed. Chinese police often are accused of tor­turing suspects into making confessions. The case is one of a number of high-profile cases that state media has publicized in recent years highlighting the flaws of an aggressive policy of judicial executions. Death penalty lawyers and legal scholars in China have also begun dis­cussing more openly the need for China to establish clearer procedures for the death penal­ty. There has not been any debate, however, about abolish­ing capital punishment. 
T. Kumar, the advocacy direc­tor for Asia for Amnesty International USA, said the shift came from a sense in the Chinese state media and aca­demic community that the cur­rent system was unfair. 
"There was some discussion that innocent people were being killed," he said. "They want to bring the death penalty issue under control. They were killing too many people."

In search of a silver ballot 
II' you've watched any television at all during the past month, then you know that Chris Chocola spends part of' each summer setting lire to illegal aliens as they attempt to cross the border. 
You also know that Joe Donnelly robbed Native Americans of their land back in 1872 and, in his spare time, slashes the tires of those scooters senior citi­zens drive around Wal-Mart. 
So, which one deserves to win pub­lic office? 
As students in South Bend, most of us come from some­place else and don't actually. have to vote for either of those candidates. Good thing, too, because if you're the kind of person who takes campaign ads seriously, you know that South Bend voters can only go wrong. 
If I were a South Bend voter, I'd walk in to the polling booth as though I'd never heard anything either politician has had to say, just to have some fun in this lose-lose situation. People who ana­lyze this sort of thing say that name recognition is key to the outcome of' any election, so it's reasonable to ascertain that I'd vote for Chri~ Chocola. Tho name sounds like a delicious, carbonat­ed, chocolate-flavored beverage, bottled by a company with Christian sympa­thies. What more does a politician need?

while I was hilme for fall break. I filed an absentee ballot in the city elerk's office. It was my first time voting and I think I did a good job, considering that in general ballots are not nearly as sim­ple as the ACT. In this ease, voting required me to connect two halves of an arrow in such a way that put me in the mind of' those little mazes that used to appear on llappy Meal bags -the ones where you trace one of' three impossibly entangled lines to ligure out whether · llamburglar should connect with the milkshako or the French fries. 
In that particular eleetion, a man named Jim Doyle is running against a man named Mark Green. Unfortunately, Mark Green has an apparent, if coinci­dental, advantage on this ballot, espe­cially with voters who get all their infor­mation from T.V. ads and know only that both men arn Satanist cannibals. You see, Mark Groen is not only the name of a politician, but also an imper­ative sentence in whieh Mark is the verb and Green is the direct object of Mark (the subject of the sentence is the implied "you.") Mark Green comes aeross on the ballot as active and ener­getic, a rna! go-getter whose very name orders people to vote for him, while Jim Doyle floats just above him in passive ambiguity -an aecurate analogy of' how Doyle has spent his term in offiee, but one that is out of place. 
Surprisingly enough, this might not be all good news for Mr. (;reen. Directly btllow him on the ballot is the name Nelson Eisman, t:andidate for none otlwr than the Green party. I suppose that's why the ballot engineers didn't makt1 Mark Green chango his namn for

the election. It could just as easily work for him as against him. 

Examples of this kind of thing run rampant aeross the country. There's a state representative in Ohio who won his eighth term in 2004. Ilis name is John Boehner. Here is a man who owes a lot to what I eall The Snicker Factor. I mean, what otherwise uninformed voter wouldn't vote for a man named Boehner? (I won't even go into what his opponents' ads must be like.) 
I will leave you with one last philo­sophieal observation on this subject. On the ballot in my home state, the individ­ual can vote yes or no to a proposed amendment to the state Constitution. The amendment would prevent gay marriage in that state. The catch? Gay marriage is not allowed in that state. Therefore, a vote for the amendment prevents gay marriage. A vote against it also prevents gay marriage. 
Now, the first time I heard that only 30 percent of' Americans vote, I was thunderstruck. I eouldn 't conceive of any situation in which people just wouldn't exercise their civic duty. But that was before I found out that civic duty involves standing in line for hours at tho city clerk's office, only to decide whether to vote against or against gay marriage. 
llappy voting.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR U-WIRE 
Grad students unhappy with lottery, treatment 
Call for protest 
Decisions by the undergraduate Student Union Board (SUB) have resulted in the exclu­sion of graduate students from the lottery dis­tribution of away game football tickets. Despite meeting with the SUB and raising the issue with the ticket office, athletics, student affairs, the Graduate Student Union and student activi­ties, graduate students still will not be able to participate in the away game lottery for USC. Come protest continued unfair treatment of graduate students in front of Legends. Bring yourself, bring your friends and, if you want, bring a sign. The lottery is today, from noon to 5 p.m. at Legends. We will be focusing our protest from 2-3 p.m. This protest is to relay the message that we are students too, and deserve to be treated as such. 
Janice Kenney grad student off campus Oct. 31 

3/5 of a student? 
We are writing this letter to call attention to the continued mistreatment of the graduate student population by the administration and the undergraduate student body. We feel the need to first point out that we are graduate students, to distinguish ourselves from the "real" students of Notre Dame: the undergrad­uates. While the direct cause of this letter was yet another stunt pulled by the SUB in the form of barring graduate students entering the lot­tery for USC tickets, much like every other away game this year, the full reasons for this letter have been slowly building for years. 
This morning, we checked our e-mail inboxes to find a letter from the SUB. Not knowing why the SUB would send a letter to people who count as 3/5 of a student, we assumed it was in error. What could be so urgent that the SUB would need to contact second-class students like ourselves? Did someone vandalize the Basilica? Did University President Father John Jenkins move his office down the hall again? Did Jordan Hall of Science .burn down? What could this emergency possibly be? 
Thankfully, it was nothing so urgent. We were told undergraduates only would be able to enter the USC game ticket lottery. We won­dered why this could be, why only the under­graduates? Weren't we students? We checked our car. They were in the undergraduate stu­dent lots. We checked insideND. We have stu­dent accounts, PINs and need to pass classes to graduate. Closer inspection of our student accounts revealed a fee paid to the graduate student governing body, which unfortunately, isn't allocated any tickets. Why is that anyway? We checked our ID cards -they also said we were students. We read our graduate student handbooks-we were subject to du Lac. We checked our tickets -yup, student tickets. Are graduate students not athletes too? Ask Rhema McKnight. But it occurred to us that maybe still we weren't "really" students. 
We teach classes, have office hours, grade papers and exams, work 60+ hours a week, and get taxable stipends from our grants. Were we staff? We checked our $1,300 Megalife bill and piles of claims denials reminiscent of "The Rainmaker." We certainly weren't staff. But that's OK, dental and vision coverage are over­rated anyway. What could it have been? Did we not have the "Notre Dame Spirit"? We reviewed the timing of our cheers and our knowledge of the fight song. Off-beat and mumbled, respectively, just like everyone else. We checked our closets -plenty of officially licensed Notre Dame Adidas apparel. 
We finally realized that this is yet another thing to add to our lengthy list of how graduate students are marginalized. We don't qualify as students or staff per se, but are in some nebu­lous grey area between at the convenience of the school. We work long hours, for little pay, and even less respect. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, unless that wheel already has a bachelor's degree -then it's just told to suck it up. Do graduate students matter to anyone at this University? What are we -students, staff, or second class citizens? We challenge anyone involved in this decision to provide even a single good reason not involving money or the informal fallacy of logic called "tradi­tion" that graduate students are not allowed to purchase away game tickets the same way undergraduates are. 
We invite all graduate students to attend a protest at Legends, today, from 2-3 p.m. (coin­cidentally, when and where the lottery is occurring) to show that we are serious about being given the opportunity to support our football team.

South Bend GuluWalk 



raises awareness 
On Oct. 22, more than 150 people from the South Bend community gathered near the campus of Indiana University South Bend to walk in solidarity with children in northern Uganda. 
These so called "night-commuters" are the victims of a 20-year civil war between the government of Uganda and rebel forces known as the Lord's Resistance Army. They walk up to 12 miles every night to locations which are safe from rebels who abduct children and force them to serve as soldiers. Participants in the GuluWalk are likely feeling enlightened about the humanitarian catastrophe in northern Uganda but uncertain about their potential to take further action. They will be encouraged to hear that there is a lot of good news. The number of night-commuters is drastically down due to improved security conditions in northern Uganda. Even more important, historic peace negotiations are taking place in Juba, southern Sudan, which offer the best chance for peace northern Uganda has seen in the last 20 years. 
While the talks are promising, peace negotiations 
,,.are fragile processes and the Jtilia talks have fai­

for the talks from the international community, espe­cially the United States, could rejuvenate the process and provide a catalyst for its successful resolution. Support for the talks can come in the form oflogisti­cal and financial aid, but the most urgent need is a public statement by a senior Bush administration official supporting the Juba peace talks. By support­ing the GuluWalk, people have made it clear that they believe the silence by the United States on this crucial issue is unacceptable. 
We are asking you to take one step beyond the GuluWalk by calling your Congressional representa­tives and telling them to encourage Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to release a public statement in support of the Juba peace talks. Peace is within reach in northern Uganda. Let us be sure that we do everything we can to help achieve it.

Don't ride into the danger zone 
Over the course of our acquaintance, every single one of my 
close male friends has found themselves at some point or anoth­
er in a place I shall henceforth deem "the danger zone." 
This has nothing to do with Tom Cruise in aviator sunglasses. 
In fact, a "Top Gun" runway with a fighter jet hurtling toward 
you at 180 to 200 mph might even be Sarah Carbone 
safer than the zone I refer to. 
This danger zone is a hazy gray bat­
Cal Poly 

tleground, filled with mines and traps 
Mustang

and, at the same time, plenty of 
Daily

rewards, if you can survive long 
enough to get past the defenses. 
This is the perilous place between friends and more-than­
friends. 

The line between these two is usually well-camouflaged. 
Keeping a watch out for it is tricky business; in the midst of 
combat, you can be so preoccupied with other threats that all of 
a sudden you may fmd yourself treacherously close to the front. 
If you cross this line, you run the risk of being forever captured 
in friends mode, and you can say goodbye to any romantic 
potential that once kept you awake at night. 
At ease, soldier. Before you go AWOL, let's strategize. 
In all the relationship-oriented conversations I've had, the 
general consensus suggests that everyone wants to be friends 
first with his or her significant other before things turn roman­
tic. 

Intro psychology, the self-help section at Borders, and most 
likely your mother have all told you time and again that a 
strong, solid friendship is the best foundation for a relationship. 
Connections founded on lust don't have the greatest track 
record in terms oflongevity (except for those rare few that, by 
luck or by divine intervention, actually endure past the so-called 
"smoldering embers" into posterity). In the long-term sense, 
what remains after the passion fizzles out? Conversation, cama­
raderie, attachment-in short: the elements of friendship. 
We all aspire to this ideal. We're holding onto the hope that it 
will all play out so predictably: Meet someone. Chit-chat over 
coffee turns into conversations about life, love and everything in 
between. A warm, comfortable friendship develops, strength­
ens, and then, with any luck, blossoms into something more. 
But if we're all so stuck on this paradigm of perfection, why is 
it that sometimes, when you've found yourself at the make-it or 
break-it point of a potentially romantic situation, the last thing 
you want to hear is this: "This is so-and-so, my FRIEND." 
Ouch. Your hopes have just crumbled-as in, your ribcage just collapsed in despair. 
"FRIEND? I'm just a FRIEND?" 
This is exactly the situation in which my guy friends have 
found themselves (for some of them, more than once). I don't 
know where exactly they go awry. But it seems their utmost 
efforts to be the good guy and the shoulder-to-cry-on are pre­
cisely what make them cross the line into friendship-only (and 
sometimes even sibling-like) territory. The pain of shooting 
themselves in the foot doesn't compare to the shell shock of this 
dreaded phrase ringing in their ears: 
"Aww, that's sweet? but I only see you as a FRIEND." 
Then they sit in puzzlement, trying to reconcile for themselves 
how they fell prey to that old adage about nice guys always fin­
ishing last (they do not!). 
The thing about romantic pursuits is just that: it's supposed to 
be a pursuit, a chase of sorts. Attempting to cultivate romance 
from friendship involves maintaining a balance of (un)availabili­
ty, (un)certainty, and (dis)comfort during the friendship phase 
itself. 

The spark of possibility, the "what-if' factor, can't be entirely 
relinquished if the hope is to eventually sway things in a roman­
tic direction. The idea must be kept on simmer on the back­
burner. 

What does this look like, in terms of behavior? A reversion 
back to the tried-and-true methods of grade school; that is, a 
playful sort of antagonism that's just enough to keep the other 
person guessing. A little subtle teasing can be much more 
charming and effective than blatant, unnerving flirtation. 
And "Hitch" (arguably, last year's best how-to romantic come­
dy) says hitting is good. 
Of course, it's never impossible for romance to stem from a 
purely-friendly friendship. When it all comes down to it, any­
thing's possible with relationships. But generally speaking, 
interaction void of any chemistry (obvious or obscure) will not 
conjure up romantic feelings on its own. 
I understand that the battlefield is a terrifying place to be, and 
there's nothing more harrowing than finding oneself slipping 
dangerously close to the line. 
So, keep an eye out. Whether it's friendship or romance (or 
both) that you want, keep your target in your sights, bide your 
time and fire when ready.

Graphically slicing through a human skull. A naked woman frozen to death. A man drowning in rotting pig carcasses. Images like these can only mean one thing -the latest installment in the "Saw" fran­chise has been released. Although not an amazing horror movie, fans of the "Saw" movies won't be disappointed by "Saw III." 
The original "Saw" (2004) was a hit with audiences due not only 
to its violence but also Saw III second main plot to its puzzle-oriented plot­

A couple of characters from the last instalhnent get to "play a game" with metal fasteners, explosives and flesh-eating acid. And those are just the first few minutes.

Picking up where "Saw II" left off, the audience learns the fates of Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) and Kerry (Dina Meyer) as well as the whereabouts of the left-for-dead Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and his protege Amanda (Shawnee Smith). Even from his deathbed, Jigsaw still plays games with his victims. 
son's death -the wit­ness who fled, the judge who gave a light sentence and the drunk driver himself­who are all caught up in Jigsaw's diabolical traps. Jeff must then decide whether to kill each one of them or offer his forgiveness. 
Director Darren Lynn Bousman returns for "Saw III" after a mediocre showing in "Saw II." "Saw III" is unflinchingly gory as well as visually frightening. Although "Saw" set the "grindhouse" sub-genre in motion, movies sueh as "IIostel" have upped the ante. "Saw III" doesn't fail in delivering plenty of !,l'fotesque sight'>. It is a film meant primarily for hardeore horror fans. 

Not only is the onscrmm action frighten­ing, but the story is significantly better than the previous two flicks. It not only works upon iL'i own individual premise, but it con­necL<> baek and deepens the plot developed in the first two films. A'i a trilogy, "Saw III" brings dosure to the overall story. Although Bousman and writer Leigh Whannell have both signed off from the franchise, Lionsgate pictures announced yesterday that a fourth "Saw" will be coming out in time for Halloween next year. 
"Saw III" i<> definitely the best movie of its self-created subgenre. Arriving one year after the last instalhnent, it has a surprising plot and would make an excellent series fmale. Unfortunately, it's not the end.

SECOND 'SAw' FILM BARELY MAKES CuT 
By ERIN MCGINN Assistant Scene Editor 
"Saw" was groundbreaking in its own right and "Saw II" does little to change what was presented in the first film, but it does have a bigger budget, slightly better writing and just as much gore. 
The film starts with the killer, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), being captured by the police. As he is apprehended, he reveals a block of monitors that shows a room where Detective Williams (Donnie Wahlberg) dis­covers that his son and seven others are trapped with a nerve gas that will kill them. The police look on helplessly from another location not knowing how to find them. 
While most people would work together to find a solution, this group is made of up ex-convicts and similarly dysfunctional peo­ple. The idea, while not original ("Cube" basically did the same thing and in a much more intelligent manner), still works because it is a larger group of people deal­ing with Jigsaw's puzzles and traps at the same time. 
It's clear that this time the brains behind "Saw II" had both more money and more time than the first go-round. Although the writing falls short of award-winning quality, Leigh Whannell and director Darren Bousman's co-written script is vastly improved from the first movie and better than most horror films. 
While the performances are no better than expected, there is no one nearly as atrocious as Cary Elwes' portrayal of Dr. Gordon in the first film -an absence that immediately translates to a huge improve­ment. Walhberg also does much better in the role of the detective than Danny Glover did in the original. The best parts of the movie easily involve the conversations and mind games between Wahlberg and Bells' characters. Although not nearly as well done, those scenes are reminiscent of those between Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling in "The Silence of the Lambs." This film solidifies Jigsaw as a reprehensible yet entertaining serial killer, much in the same vein as Craven's Freddie Krueger. 

Outside of the main characters the acting leaves much to be desired, with many of the per­formances decidedly overboard. Frankie G is particularly bad as a con who decides he is getting out of the house without any help from any of the others. 
Television actress Beverly Mitchell ("7th Heaven") is worse than expected, and spends most of the movie doing nothing more than coughing up blood. In general, the inhabi­tants of the house aren't interesting-the audience just wants to see how they are connected and what happens to them. 
"Saw II" kicks up the gore one more notch from the first film, with a lot more action, as it is not predominantly focused on two people stuck in a room. It's also easier to follow since it only goes back and forth between two settings -the house of hor­rors and Jigsaw's workshop, where he holds police hostage. 
The DVD has several special features worth watching. The audio commentary by the director is both hilarious and insightful and the "behind the scenes" of the torture scenes would fascinate anyone who enjoys analyzing movie magic. 
Fans of interesting and clever ways to slaughter will enjoy "Saw II" more than the original. And unlike others in the slasher genre such as "The Hills Have Eyes," the people caught up in Jigsaw's game are not necessarily stupid or innocent. The movie avoids many of the typical horror cliches­making it as enjoyable as "Saw" could ever aspire to be.

NHL 

Higgins' two goals lift Montreal in victory 

Ehrhoff' s last second goal gives San Jose 2-1 win over Florida 
Associated Press 

MONTREAL -Christopher Higgins scored his third short­handed goal of the season and Alex Kovalev combined with his new Russian linemates for Montreal's second goal, leading the Canadiens to a 4-2 win over the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday night. 
David Aebischer made 31 saves for Montreal, 2-0-1 in its last three games. 
Andrei Markov scored into an empty net at 18:44 of the third, and Steve Begin added his first of the season 19 seconds later, beating Ray Emery on a pass from Mike Johnson with 56.9 seconds remaining. 
Aebischer, who stopped 4 7 shots in Saturday's 5-4 overtime loss to Toronto, lost a bid for his first Montreal shutout on Jason Spezza's goal 6:19 into the third. 
Ray Emery stopped 25 shots for Ottawa, which has lost two straight after a three-game win­ning streak. 
Senators right wing Chris Neil had to be helped off the ice after he was injured while falling behind the net as he set up Tom Preissing's goal with 8.4 seconds remaining. 
The Senators, who set a fran­chise record with an NHL-lead­ing 312 goals last season, have been held to two goals in the two losses after outscoring opponents 21-5 during their winning streak. 
Wade Redden was out of Ottawa's lineup because of a nagging groin injury. 
The Senators failed to convert on seven power-play opportuni­ties. Ottawa has scored on only 
9.4 percent of their chances, taking advantage six times in 64 chances this season. Montreal went 0-for-5 on the power play. 
Higgins, who leads the NHL in short-handed goals, opened the scoring with a sensational effort with his team-high seventh goal. 
With Alexander Perezhogin in the penalty box, Higgins drove in on Emery and beat him 5:30 into the second for his second short-handed goal against Ottawa in two games. 
Normally a right wing, Kovalev moved to center between countrymen Sergei Samsonov and Perezhogin in the third period of Saturday's game, assisting on two late goals to draw Montreal even. 
Canadiens coach Guy Carbonneau kept the unit intact against Ottawa, and the move paid dividends late in the sec­ond. Kovalev redirected a cen­tering feed from Samsonov past Ray Emery for his fourth goal at 
18:32 to make it 2-0. 
Islanders 5, Blackahwks 2 

Rick DiPietro turned aside 30 shots, and Alexei Yashin scored the decisive goal in the New York Islanders' victory over the slumping Chicago Blackhawks on Tuesday night. 
Mike York, Viktor Kozlov, Mike Sillinger and Jason Blake also scored for the Islanders, who went 4-1-2 on their seven-game homestand. After visiting New Jersey on Thursday, New York will play two more games at home before a five-game road trip. 
Jassen Cullimore and Denis Arkhipov scored for the Blackhawks, who snapped a three-game shutout streak but lost their sixth straight game. Chicago hasn't won since a 2-1 home victory over Montreal on Oct. 18. Brian Boucher stopped 19 shots but fell to 0-6. 
Cullimore's goal with 4:14 left in the second period was the Blackhawks' llrst in 240 min­utes, 56 seconds -dating to a score by Michal Handzus on Oct. 21 in a 4-3 home loss to St. Louis. 
The Blackhawks outshot the Islanders 10-8 in the opening period, but New York had the better chances. The Islanders took advantage of their third power play with 1:41 left in the period when York knocked in the rebound of Miroslav Satan's right point slap shot for his third goal of the season. 
In the second period, three straight Islanders penalties gave Chicago a pair of two-man advantages that lasted 19 and 48 seconds. DiPietro stopped six shots in that span to preserve the 1-0 lead. 
New York made it 2-0 at 11:44 when Kozlov picked off a pass at his own blue line and sped in alone on Boucher. 
He faked a forehand move, switched to his backhand, and slid the puck into the open left side. 
Yashin extended the lead to 3­0 at 14:38 on a power-play slap shot from outside the left circle that beat Boucher -who was screened -between the pads. The Islanders captain has three goals and six assists in his last five games. 
Cullimore ended the Blaekhawks' scoring drought when his shot from the right point deflected off Islanders defenseman Alexei Zhitnik and over DiPietro's glove into the top left eorner. 
Chicago seored again 82 sec­onds into the final period. Arkhipov picked up a loose puck at his own blue line, skated to the high slot and beat DiPietro with a wrist shot to the right side. 
Sillinger iced the game with 
2:30 left on a wrist shot from the low right side that got between Boucher's pads. Blake scored his lOOth NHL goal on a power play from the right crease with 52.7 seconds remaining. 
Sharks 2, Panthers 1 

Christian Ehrhoff scored a power-play goal with 35.8 see­onds left to give the San Jose Sharks a 2-1 victory over the Florida Panthers on Tuesday night. 
Joe Thornton also scored for the Sharks, who extended their unbeaten streak against Florida to eight games (7-0-1 ). San Jose hasn't lost against the Panthers sinee a 4-1 defeat at Florida on Feb. 9, 2000. 
Olli Jokinen seored and Alexander Auld stopped 26 shots for the Panthers, who lost their second conseeutive game at home after starting the sea­son 4-0. 
Vesa Toskala made 24 saves for the Sharks. It was his first game sinee his franchise-reeord 12-game winning streak was snapped in a 4-3 loss to Nashville on Thursday night. 
Ehrhoff scored when his slap shot went off the stiek of Florida's Ville Peltonen near the blue line and floated over the shoulder of Auld. San Jose eame into the game with the best power play in the NHL but was 0-for-4 before Ehrhoff seored.

SAN DIEGO -The San Diego Chargers must play their next four games with­out outside linebacker Shawne Merriman, one of the NFL's top young stars who decided Tuesday not to appeal his suspension for testing positive for steroids. 
Merriman's suspension is another blow to one of the NFL's toughest defenses, which has been hit by injuries and off-field trouble since before the season started. Nicknamed "Lights Out" because of his punish­ing hits, he'll be shut down for games at home against Cleveland, at Cincinnati, at Denver and at home against the Oakland Raiders. 

Merriman, who's tied for the NFL lead with 8 1/2 sacks, and his attorney have blamed a tainted sup­plement for the player's positive test for the steroid nandrolone. Merriman couldn't be reached for comment. 
The suspension won't offi­cially begin until after Merriman addresses his teammates on Wednesday. After that, he'll be barred from the team's headquar­ters until he's eligible to return on Nov. 27. 
The Chargers, who were off Tuesday, vowed to press on without Merriman, a Pro Bowl starter who was voted the 2005 NFL Defensive 
IN BRIEF 
Astros launch BaS!Well after 
missing all of 2006 season 
HOUSTON -Jeff Bagwell's $18 million option was declined Tuesday by the Houston Astros, who will give their career home run and RBis leader a $7 million buyout to com­plete an $85 million, five-year con­tract. 
The 38-year-old Bagwell missed last season because of an arthritic right shoulder, and the Astros tried to recoup about $15.6 million in insurance. 
."It doesn't mean anything at all," Bagwell told KRIV-TV in Houston. "Everyone knew this was going to happen. It is part of the business. I'm OK with it. This is not a sad day." 
Bagwell's agent, Barry Axelrod, said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press that Bagwell is "a long shot" to ever play again. But Axelrod said Bagwell isn't ready to officially retire. 
Rookie of the Year. 
"l-Ie's upset because he let his team down, but we're OK," outside linebacker Shaun Phillips said in a phone interview. "We're behind him 100 percent. We know he's not that kind of guy, that he wouldn't do anything to boost his per­formance. 
"We're a good team. We'll get over it," said Phillips, who moved into the starting lineup after Steve Foley was shot by an off-duty police officer on Sept. 3. Phillips missed Sunday's 38-24 win over the St. Louis Rams with a calf injury and has only a 50 percent chance of playing against the Browns. 
Had Merriman gone 
through with the appeal and lost, there was the chance he'd miss both games against Denver. The Chargers host the Broncos on Dec. 10. Few people expected Merriman to win on appeal because the NFL holds players accountable for knowing the contents of the supplements they take. 
Word of Merriman's posi­tive test leaked on Oct. 22. Merriman announced last Tuesday he was appealing, and matched his career­high with three sacks against the Rams. He cele­brated each as he usually does, by pretending to flip a switch tattooed on his fore­arm followed by a spas­modic dance. 

Barbaro's trainer returns to Churchill Downs 
LOUISVILLE -Michael Matz is back at Churchill Downs this week, scene of Barbaro's dominating Kentucky Derby victory. 
The trainer's working in the same barn area and leading his horse for the Breeders' Cup along the paths where Barbaro walked. 
One moment. Matz's voice breaks and tears well in his blue eyes as he talks about Barbaro, whose career ended with a devastating misstep in the Preakness. The Derby winner was supposed to be taking on Bernardini in the $5 million Classic on Saturday, with Horse of the Year honors at stakll. 
The next, Matz is composed and focused on saddling 4-year-old filly Round Pond in the $2 million Distaff. 
"It's nice to be back having such fond memories from before," Matz said Tuesday. "I just hope we have the same results." 
White House: Colombian 
soccer men all about the coke 
WASHINGTON -AColombian soccer club was characterized by the Bush administration Tuesday as a front for one of the South American country's four most wanted cocaine kingpins. 
The Treasury Department annoilllced that it was freezing any U.S. assets of Cortulua, a second-division soccer club based in Tulua, in southern Colombia. 
Cortulua was named as one of 10 companies and seven individuals allegedly operating on behalf of Carlos Alberto Renteria Mantilla, one of the four leaders of Norte del Valle, Colombia's largest trafficking cartel. 
Cortulua has played in the Colombian first division as recently as 2005 and appears poised to return to the top flight next season. 
The designation freezes any of Cortulua's assets in the United States and bars U.S. citizens and companies from having commercial transactions with it.

Defending cha111pion Heat burnout in season opener 
Chicago steamrolls Miami on the road 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -The Chicago Bulls left the court during Miami's championship-ring festivities, then returned to emphatically spoil what was left of the Heat's celebration. 
Kirk Hinrich -who signed a five-year extension just hours before tip-off -scored 26 points, Chris Duhon added 20 and the Bulls delivered a huge stunner in beating the defend­ing NBA champion Heat in Tuesday night's season opener. 
It was -by far -the worst loss in NBA history for a defending champion on opening night; the previous low was the Los Angeles Lakers' 132-117 defeat to Golden State on Oct. 29, 1982. The Lakers went on that season to win 58 games and return to the NBA finals under coach Pat Riley, the same man guiding the Heat these days. 
Chicago seized command with a 37-14 second-quarter burst, a stretch where the Bulls con­nected on 79 percent of their shots -compared to 29 per­cent for the Heat, who simply never got rolling. The lead was 59-30 at halftime and just kept growing. 
Dwyane Wade had 25 points before sitting out much of the fourth quarter for Miami, which didn't even have anyone else reach double figures. The Heat turned the ball over 23 times, leading to 32 Chicago points and were outrebounded 49-29. 
Luol Deng had 12 points and Thabo Sefolosha-the league's blub, blub, blub, blub because they're so pumped," said NBA commissioner David Stern, who handed out the jewelry to the Heat players, coaches and staff before the game. ''I've been to a couple of those."

It never happened, leaving Florida out of the title game each of the last five years. The seventh-ranked Gators are in position to end the drought. They don't need any assistance, either. "That's a real nice feeling," linebacker Brandon Siler said. "It's hard cheering for other teams and hoping that things happen.

This was another one. 
On a night that should have been filled with highs, the result was a franchise low -as in the worst opening-night loss in Heat history. Miami had dropped three other openers by 20 points, most recently Nov. 5, 2003, against Orlando. 
The teams last met in the first round of last season's playoffs, when the Bulls frustrated the Heat often before finally falling to the eventual champs in six games.

know your destiny is different. It's way different now. I don't have to watch other teams play." 
Florida (7-1, S-1) can win the East with victories at Vanderbilt (4-5, 1-4) on Saturday and against South Carolina (S-3, 3­
3) the following week. The Gators also would clinch the division with a win Saturday and a loss by Tennessee. The eighth-ranked Volunteers host No. 13 LSU. 
"It's definitely a new feeling," senior receiver Jemalle Cornelius said. "We haven't been this fortunate around here for a while, so we're trying to make sure we don't let this opportunity slip away from us. We've got to make sure we stay focused, keep playing hard and find a way to win games." 
The Gators beat Georgia 21­14 Saturday to stay on top of the division, ending a brutal four­game stretch against Alabama, LSU, Auburn and the Bulldogs with a 3-1 record. 
"That was a big one," Siler said. "That's a big lump to get over. Of course, we've got to keep playing how we're playing and win on out. But that was a big lump. That was a big stretch we've been talking about and the nation's been talking about. We came out of it with one loss and we're in control of our own destiny." 
But the schedule doesn't ease up much. 
Although Florida has won 15 in a row against Vandy, four of the last 10 meetings have been decided by seven points or less. Last season was the biggest nail-biter. Cornerback Reggie Lewis, picked on most of the night, intercepted Jay Cutler's first pass in the second overtime to give the Gators a 49-42 victo­ry. 
Florida would prefer to clinch the division race in Nashville and not have to rely on beating South Carolina and former coach Steve Spurrier the follow­ing week in Gainesville. Spurrier's teams were 68-5 in 12 years at Florida Field, and his Gamecocks upset the Gators last season, preventing them from advancing to the confer­ence title game.

Senior leads 8th-place finish 
Irish close out fall season with tourney 
By CHRIS HINE Sport Writer 

Notre Dame ended its fall season on a high note Tuesday, posting an 8-over par 296 ­their best total of the season ­to finish in a tie for eighth out of 19 teams at the Edwin Watts/Palmetto Intercollegiate Tournament in Kiawah Island, S.C. 
The Irish finished 35 strokes behind tournament winner Campbell. 
The team won't compete again until the spring. 
Notre Dame came to South Carolina with the l'ifth best ranking of the teams in the tournament according to Golfstat.com, but the Irish struggled in the first two rounds with scores of 308 and 310. 
Tuesday marked only the second time this fall that the Irish shot under 300 for a round. 
"They went out and did what they had to do today," Irish coach Susan Holt said. "We just need to be more consis­tent, and they will be during the spring." 
Senior Noriko Nakazaki dubbed the team's best round of the season with a 2-under 70 Tuesday to finish 3-over for the tournament, putting her in she said. "They're going to be a tie for sixth overall. a big part of the rest of the Nakazaki holed 10 birdies in season.

Holt said the freshmen went through a maturation process during their first semester on the team. 
"Everytime they get an opportunity to play it helps," ask me if it was a 
good move, I 
always tell them I know it is," she said. 
During the winter, the Irish will have the opportunity to practice in the newly built Robert and Marilyn Rolfs Family All-Season Golf Facility, which features a driving range and a 5,000 square-foot short game area complete with a putting green and practice bunker. 
"We'll be able to practice much more thanks to the new facility," Nakazaki said. "And that will make us a lot better for the spring."

Notre Dame's season. 
"We've been practicing against each other for long enough," Falls said before practice Monday. "It's time to get going [against other com­petition]." 
Rockhurst University is a Division-11 school in Kansas City, Mo., and is a member of the Heartland Conference ­which it founded in 1999. But despite the two programs' disparity, the Irish will treat their preseason opener like a regular season matchup. 
"I think we'll take it and prepare like a game," Brey said. "We'll sub like a game, yeah you'd like to get a look at everyone but not at the expense of [establishing] a flow." 
Establishing this flow, or offensive rhythm and substi­tution patterns, will be impor­tant for Notre Dame in its preseason and early season schedule. 
With the graduations of guard Chris Quinn (17. 7 points, 6.4 assists per game in 2005-06) and forward Torin Francis (11.6 points, 
9.4 rebounds per game), there are clear voids in the starting lineup. But at the same time, there are also opportunities for younger players to take advantage of increased roles. 
McAlarney will assume full­time point guard duties this season after being a backup last year. But the sophomore from Staten Island, N.Y. is ready to fill Quinn's shoes, currently playing for the NBA's Miami Heat. 
"[I'm] not feeling any pres­sure at all," McAlarney said. 'Tm very comfortable right now, we've put a lot into this." 
McAlarney, combined with Falls, combo guard Russell Carter and forward Rob Kurz are expected to be the nucle­us of the team, while setting examples for the nine fresh­men and sophomores on the roster. 
"It's clear those guys are the most experienced guys," Brey said. "All of them are doing a few new things. Those guys are going to have to be our rocks." 
Outside of Carter, Falls, Kurz and McAiarney, Wednesday's preseason game should begin to shed light on who else will be in the mix. Falls credited freshman Luke Harangody Monday for estab­lishing a definitive post pres­ence during practice, and Brey said sophomore forward Zach Hillesland and freshman guard Tory Jackson have impressed him early. 
But above all else, the open­er will let Notre Dame run its motion sets -the primary offense which the Irish use ­against an opponent other than themselves. 
"It would be disrespectful to say we're going to blow them out," Carter said Monday. "We want to [work on improving] but at the same time we want to win."

Lakers 
continued from page 24 
The Irish offense looked slow early, and the Irish and Lakers traded baskets to open up the game. A three­pointer by Lakers guard Shalyn Beauchamp put Lake Superior State ahead 6-5. 
It was the last time the Lakers would hold the lead. 
Gaines responded on Notre Dame's next possession to regain the lead, and a 17-5 run over the next six minutes destroyed any Lake State hopes. Notre Dame went into the locker room at halftime up 44-27. 
"[Our offensive production] was a little better than I expected," McGraw said. "I thought we'd probably hit the 70's, get pretty good per­
formances from  a  lot of dif­ 
ferent people."  
Notre  Dame  kept  their  

offense intensity high in the second half, scoring eight straight points after Jaclyn Armstrong sank a lay-up for the Lakers. This run cement­ed Notre Dame's lead, which grew steadily throughout the game. 
Leading the Irish effort was junior guard Allen, who was 8-of-13 from the floor with 20 points -the best exhibi­tion game of her career. Guard Breona Gray (10 points) and center Melissa D'Amico (11 points) each hit double digits for Notre Dame, while Gaines was not far behind with nine. 
Even though 10 out of the 11 Irish players in the game 

scored, McGraw still thought the players could each have contributed more overall ­especially on the glass. Notre Dame out-rebounded Lake Superior State 51-42. 
Allen led the charge with 10 boards, and had the only Irish double-double of the game. But the two Irish cen­ters -D'Amico and fresh­man Erica Williamson ­were boxed out all night, and combined for nine boards. 
The Irish limited the Lakers on the -defensive end. Lake Superior State shot 29 per­cent from the field (28 per­cent from 3-point range). 
"Our three-point defense was good; our field goal defense was good -we fouled way too much," McGraw said. "If you're going to be aggressive, you're going to foul, and that's one of the things we can fix." 
Notre Dame also forced 32 
turnovers,  mainly  due  to  
tight  defense  played  by  
Gaines and Gray.  

"I thought for 40 minutes it was a great effort and a lot of that has to do with [Gaines] and [Gray]," McGraw said. "When they get going and get up on the ball, it makes everybody else run and get up and guard people too." 
Another key aspect of the Irish victory was the per­formance of their three freshmen -Williamson and guards Ashley Barlow and Melissa Lechlitner. 
Despite the low rebound total, Williamson still filled in well for the veteran D'Amico, posting six points and one block in 13 minutes. 
"I think coming into the game, you could probably tell by the way I played," Williamson said. "I just love the atmosphere here. The first time I went in and I heard my name, the crowd just went crazy ... It was nice to have that." 
Barlow and Lechlitner each played well in their first col­lege appearances, scoring seven and eight points, respectively, while spending time as the point and shoot­ing guard. Barlow's perform­ance was cut short, however, when she fell hard to the ground eight minutes into the game and left the game for further tests. 
Overall, the Irish felt they succeeded in their first test against college opposition on both sides of the ball. 
"I thought there were some good things," McGraw said. "I think you can see the con­tributions from three of our freshmen will be making and 

I think they potential."  have  great

Win means little to Jackson 
Irish cmch takes tourney .... and earns 200th victory 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
Saturday night's 2-0 shutout of Air Force was anything but an ordinary win for Irish coach Jeff Jackson -and he had no idea. 
The victory to take the first­annual Lightning College Hockey Classic was No. 10 Notre Dame's first in-season tournament win in 25 years. But more importantly, it gave Jackson his 200th career win. 
He reached the mark with a winning percentage of .714­the highest percentage among all active Division-1 coaches with at least five years experi­
ence.

put that in perspective, the two win­ningest active coaches in the NCAA, Boston College's Jerry York and Boston University's years, respectively, to reach the 200 win plateau. 
"It's such an overrated sta­tistic," Jackson said. ''I've been behind the bench for 200 wins, and that's all the signili­cance to it." 
The humble Jackson wasn't even aware he had reached the mark until his players pre­sented him with the game puck after the final buzzer. 
Jackson's career started at Lake Superior State when he took over the head coaching job in 1990 after four years as an assistant. Jackson's Lakers won the CCI-lA regular season and tournament title af'ter

Belles outlast MIAA rival in playoff match 
By SAMANTHA LEONARD 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's fought back from a 2-0 deficit Tuesday against Alma College and advanced to the MIAA semifi­nals after a 3-2 win. 
Alma took the first two matches and looked as if it had total control in the match, but that was not the ease. 
The Scots started the third game with a 7-4 lead, but the Belles recovered and grabbed a 10-9 lead. They kept it the rest of the game, winning 30­23, and cut the Scots lead to 2­1. 
The Belles jumped out to a 9-6 lead in the fourth game, but the Scots rallied baek. Alma maintained control until a surprise rally brought the Belles back to 27-27. The Belles took a time out and went on to win the game 30­28. 
The deciding fifth game was a back-and-forth affair. The Scots came out with a 2-0 lead, but the Belles soon took over 4-3. They continued to pour on
