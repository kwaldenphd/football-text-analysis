Campus phones suffer partial software failure 
VOL. XXII, N0.57 

By MATT GALLAGHER 
Senior Staff Reporter 
The student phone extension at Notre Dame suffered a software failure, causing a par­tial loss of service to all "283" extensions. 
According to Steve Ellis, director of Telecommunica­tions, the software failure was caused by a power surge during storms Tuesday night. 
"The power surge caused a slow corruption of the tele­phone software," Ellis said. As a result, the problem was not noticed unil Wednesday mor­ning. 
On-campus students encoun­tered difficulty in making local, "dial-9" telephone calls. Also, people calling any "283" number had a difficult time getting through. 
Ellis said that the office of telecommunications had one engineer and three technicians working on correcting the prob­lem non-stop, from the time problems were noticed on Wed­nesday morning, until full service was restored af about 4:30p.m. Thursday. 
"It wasn't a complete fail­ure," Ellis said, noting that stu­dents could still dial other "283" extensions, the campus operator, and security. 
Labeling the breakdown a "major system failure," Ellis said the problem was what is known as a "direct inward dialing problem." 
Ellis noted that students could still use the Clark long­distance service, which is reached by dialing "7" from "283" phones. 
Tony Paese, spokesman for Indiana Bell in Indianapolis, said that Indiana Bell was un­aware of any problems occur­ing in the area, other than those created by a brief power outage

Bush visit to NO stirs faculty reaction 
By CHRISTINE WALSH 
Staff Reporter 
Some University officials have aired reservations about the recent visit by Vice Presi­dent George Bush in the after­math of a Faculty Senate resolution concerning the event. 
The Vice President was in­vited by the Thomas J. White Center on Law and Govern­ment to deliver what was hoped to be an issue-oriented lecture about the ideological differ­ences between himself and Governor Michael Dukakis. The Bush campaign said Bush would deliver a major policy speech. 
What the 900 students, and other members of the audience heard and saw was neither. In­stead, University officials claim, the event turned into little more than a political ral­ly. 
"What took place here is the product of the disturbing way campaigns are run now," said Professor Stephen Fallon, who co-sponsored the Faculty Sen­ate resolution that criticized Bush's Nov. 1 visit. 

"But Notre Dame was caught asleep by allowing its name to be used," said Fallon. "Notre Dame should help can­didates answer questions, not stage more pep rallies." 
Richard Conklin, vice presi­dent for University relations, said that "Inevitably, it is hard to avoid the appearance of a rally." With so many members

Bhutto wins Pakistani elections, hopes to form majority government 
Associated Press 
KARACHI, Pakistan-Benazir Bhutto's Populist Party defeated the right wing in the first free election since a coup ousted her father 11 years ago, and she expressed confidence Thursday that she can form a majority coalition. 
Ms. Bhutto said her Pakistan People's Party "has emerged as the largest single party" in 
the  National  Assembly  as  a  
result  of  Wednesday's  par­ 
liamentary election.  

"Given consultations with different groups and indepen­dent people, we are confident that we can get a simple majority," the 35-year-old po­litical leader declared after ar­riving in this southern city for coalition talks. She would be the first woman ever to lead a Moslem nation. 
Her party captured 92 seats in the 237-member assembly, compared with 55 for the nine­party conservative Islamic Democratic Alliance. The alliance includes supporters of Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, the military president killed in a plane crash three months ago. 
Independents and minor par­ties got 57 seats. Results from 13 districts were not available and 20 seats reserved for wo­men will be filled later by vote of the assembly. 
Both Ms. Bhutto and the con­servative alliance have said they would continue Pakistan's friendship with the United States and its support of Mos­lem guerrillas fighting the communist government of neighboring Afghanistan.

The Observer Weekend Edition, November18-19, 1988 
College is more than just finals and grades 
Thanksgiving is less than a week away. 
Depending on your perspective, though, it may be one-last-home-football-game-ever-as­a-student away; three tests, two term papers, and one project away; or just a twelve-hour drive or six-hour layover at the airport of yourchoice away. 
At any rate, I fear, for most of us Thanksgiv­ing lies further away from us than we can com­prehend, lost in the shuffle of paperwork and busywork and workwork. 
When we arrive at home, some of us actually may be able to relax for a few hours. It will be a chance to see our family and some friends from high school. We can overeat instead of overdrink for a change, engulf ourselves in the mass of shoppers at our good ole' hometown mall, and maybe catch a colorized version of Miracle on 34th Street just to get in the mood. 
The mood, though, will disappear immedi­ately upon our return to school. We will be faced with just ten class days to rectify a semester's worth of damage ensued by roadt.ripping, Mon­day nights out, and just general blowing-off. 
Yet another holiday which should make us stop and reflect will get shoved to the side simply because it comes at an inopportune time in the semester. 
For five days, we will eat, breathe, and I 
wishfully add sleep, finals. They will become ----------------- 
the all-consuming concern in our lives, over­shadowing everything, most of all our celebra­tion of Christ's coming to our world on our terms, as a human being. 
December 15, not December 25, will be the focus of our existence. With a great sigh of relief it will all be over. Suddenly, quiet. 
I had a bizarre experience freshman year. I had pulled the first all-nighter of my young aca­demic career, cranked out an 8 a.m. exam, went home and crashed. I woke up about 6 o'clock that evening to a deserted dorm. It was so quiet I felt like I was in some surrealistic dream­movie, in which everyone had picked up, moved out, and forgot to tell me about it. 
At any rate, all mv friends had already left for Break and in our collective busy-ness, I hadn't really said good-bye or Merry Christmas to any of them. 
Let's face it "finals" is a misnomer. These tests are final only in the sense that that par­ticular chapter of your academic career is over. There will be others. Stop and ask yourself, "Did I learn anything in that class?" not "Did I get an 'A'?" 
Sure, grades are important, but only on transcripts and in interviews and not in life. Other people may judge you on the basis of them, but if they are the sole basis of your your personal self-worth, you are making a grave error. 
One glimpse at my GPA tells you that grades aren't the most important thing in my life. As I try to explain them away to interviewers next

year, I may have some regrets, but I doubt it. It's not that I'm not capable of studying more than I do, it's that I've found other things that are also important and worthy of my time and effort, not the least of all being my personal sanity. I've learned countless things in the past two and a half years that you can't learn on the tenth floor of the 'Brare. 
I already can't tell you how I did on my exams last semester. Imagine what it will be like in ten years? While it would be a travesty to waste an educational opportunity like Notre Dame, it is equally frivolous to throw away the chance to really get to know some of the great people this place attracts. 
All I know is that at our five-year reunion, I want a few people to recognize me because I was out and about doing something on campus instead of holed up in some study carrel I want to be able to look back and say, yeah, I skipped a few classes, I went to every football game for ten weeks, I've eaten some popcorn at the Com­mons on a weeknight. Along with this, I met some great people, I had a lot of fun, I learned a lot about myself, I did some growing up, and I made the most of what college has to offer.

Minorities in corporate life subject of Coke VP's talk

The economic necessity for corporate America to infuse minorities into management positions was the topic of Thursday's Cultural Diversity lecture by Carl Ware, senior vice president of the Coca-Cola Corporation.

The lot remains closed as final preparations are com­pleted, and the new lot will be equipped with better lighting as an extra safety precaution.

plained, businesses who wish to succeed and broaden their markets will have to reflect this influx of minority workers in their management struc­tures. 
"The advancement of minorities into the ranks of cor­porate management is a busi­ness necessity," he said. 
One major barrier to the ad­vancement of minorities is the recent corporate trend of leverage buying, said Ware, a strategy which results in the "decimation of middle man­agement." 
It is in these middle manage­
ment positions that most 
needs of everyone involved," said Phil Johnson, assistant director of security. 
"At this point, we can not say for sure who will be allowed to use the lot, but there is a pos­sibility that residents of Knott, Siegfried, Farley, and B.P. will be included," said Johnson. 
According to Don Dedrick, director of the Physical Plant, "The land for the new lot was bought last year with part of the funding we are alotted each year." 
"We've been working on this project since September, in which time we cleared and filled the land and put down two layers of asphalt," said Dedrick. · minority executives are cur­rently employed, Ware said, and as a result they will have to work to break into the top level management positions. 
Finally, Ware discussed edu­cation's place in the corporate world. saying that "education and business-must be partners if students are to succeed in corporate America." 
Ware recieved his B.A. from Clark College and went on to the University of Pittsburgh for his master's degree in Public Administration. 
Johnson also commented on the parking problems that have plagued Notre Dame in the past few months. 
"My major concern, outside of major campus events such as home football games, is parking," Johnson said. "People don't always under­stand that we must work inside a budget like everyone else, and some of the suggestions they make such as extra light­ing aren't economically feasible."

U.S., allies successfully move to shore up falling dollar 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The United States and its major economic allies successfully intervened Thursday to halt a slide in the value of the dollar, but economists predicted that the Federal Reserve will be forced to boost U.S. interest rates in a further defense of the beleaguered U.S. greenback. 
The coordinated intervention in the currency markets by the United States, Japan, West Germany, England, France, Italy and Canada was the most widespread dollar rescue effort since last April, when the markets were stampeded into a dollar sell-off following a bad monthly trade report. 
Despite the success of Thursday's rescue effort, many traders foresaw renewed selling pressure in the months ahead because of fears that President-elect George Bush

and the new Congress will be unable to reach agreement on ways to trim the budget deficit. 
Investors are concerned that the enlarged Democratic majorities in Congress and Bush's tough no-tax stance guarantee further budgetary gridlock. 
For this reason, many economists predicted the Federal Reserve will be forced in coming weeks to begin push­ing interest rates higher in the United States. Some analysts said they would not rule out an increase in the discount rate, the interest the Fed charges to make loans to member banks. 
A boost in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the

Suspect in California slayings apprehended 
Associated Press 

SACRAMENTO, Calif.-A landlady suspected of killing seven elderly tenants at her boardinghouse to collect their Social Security money said Thursday she had cashed some checks but was no killer. 
Dorothea Montalvo Puente, who vanished Saturday after police unearthed the first of seven bodies buried in the yard of her boardinghouse, was ar­rested at a downtown Los An­geles motel late Wednesday after a pensioner she had ap­proached in a nearby bar be­came suspicious. 
Detectives brought Puente back to Sacramento early Thursday in a jet rented by a Sacramento television station. She was being held in Sacramento County Jail on one murder count, awaiting ar­raignment in Municipal Court later Thursday. 
During  the  flight,  she  
granted  a  brief intervie w  to  
KCRA-TV.  

"I have not killed anyone. I told you that. I have not killed anyone. The checks I cashed, yes," Puente said. 
She also said, "I used to be a very good person at one time." 
KCRA-TV reporter Mike Boyd described Pente as "not in the least" emotional or upset during the flight. 
The 59-year-old ex-convict was wearing the same pink dress and bright red coat that she was seen in five days ear­lier, when she walked away from her home. 
At that time, police said they didn't have enough evidence to detain her. But after the other bodies were discovered, a mur­der warrant was issued for Puente and a search launched in California, Nevada and Mexico. 
Police Chief John Kearns said she apparently went to West Sacramento on Saturday, then took a cab to Stockton, where she boarded a bus for Los Angeles "and has probably been there since that time." 
Puente was arrested after CBS television told Los Angeles police that a viewer called to report meeting her in a down­town bar. She had given the man the name and room num­ber of the motel where she was staying, and police arrested her there a few minutes later. 
"The suspect had struck up a conversation with a male sub­ject in a bar. They had been talking about Social Security,'' Kearns said. The two went to her nearby motel room and "during the time he was talking to her, he realized it was the murder suspect he had seen on television." 
The man, Charles Willgues, 67, said he became suspicious after Puente, who called her­self Donna Johanson, ques­tioned him at length about his Social Security benefits.

of the press present, and the use of television, lighting, and the band, Conklin said, "You can not create a lecture am­biance." 
However, steps were taken to prevent the lecture from be­coming a Bush rally. 
According to Conklin, an at­tempt was made to "mute the atmosphere." The Notre Dame Marching Band was not per­mitted to perform at the event, although the Bush campaign insisted on having a band pres­ent. Campaign officials proceeded to invite the Ball State University band to ap­pear instead. 
The band was forbidden to play the "Notre Dame Victory March" at the Stepan Center location, though it was played at the airport when Bush ar­rived, and at least one network news crew edited the song into the story. 
The vice president also met with football coach Lou Holtz and the rest of the team during his trip to the university. 
The faculty resolution sug­gested that visiting candidates submit to questions from uni­versity representitives. The issue will be taken up by the Academic Council, which is composed of both faculty mem­bers and students, and will hold its next meeting on Nov. 30. 
''Ifwe do extend these invita­tions in the future, we would want to have far greater con­trol than we exercised this time," said University Provost Timothy O'Meara. 
We've got to adjust our process to the methodology used by the candidates," O'Meara said.

U.S. moves to send at least 15 Cuban boat people back to Cuba 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Justice De­partment panels set up in the wake of last year's prison riots by Mariel boatlift detainees, have reviewed their first 28 cases and plan to send at least 15 of the prisoners back to their native Cuba "in the near fu­ture," officials said Thursday. 
The announcement aroused the anger of many in the Cuban community in Miami, and at­torneys representing the prisoners flew to Alabama seeking to halt the repatriation process. 
The 15 Cuban detainees are being held in a strict "lock­down" in a penitentiary in Tal­ladega, Ala. No detainee will be scheduled for return to Cuba earlier than 72 hours after the government officially notifies each of the 15 detainees, the Justice Department said. 
The 15 whom the department said should be repatriated have convictions ranging from petty larceny to second-degree rnur-

der. Most of them have more than one conviction. 
The three-member panels will undertake further consid­eration of the remaining 13 detainees in the initial review group to determine whether they should also be returned to Cuba or be released. 
The panels were set up at the Justice Department in the wake of last year's prison riots by Cuban detainees at Atlanta and Oakdale. La. The rioting oc­curred after a U.S. agreement with Cuban President Fidel Castro to resume sending many of the detainees back to the island. Deportations of Mariel detainees from the United States to Cuba were suspended by Castro in May 1985. 
The detainees are among 125,000 people who carne to the United States in 1980 in a boat­lift from Mariel, Cuba, and the vast majority of them have be­come law-abiding U.S. resi­dents.

The American Cancer Soci­ety estimates nearly 40 percent of the nation's 50 million smokers tried to quit for the day. About one-tenth, or 2 mil­lion people, will kick the habit permanently, said Paul Rosen­berg, a cancer society spokes­man in New York. 
"My grandkids keep telling me it's time to quit smoking," said Pat Zielke, mayor of La Crosse, Wis., and a pack-a-day smoker for 40 years. He quit smoking for the day and was "adopted" by a cancer society volunteer.

The burning tobacco was all he had left after deciding several months ago to stop or­dering the products and to burn what was left.

Life of Katharine Drexel: a heroine of God 
This is a great year at Notre Dame for many reasons. The whole country is watching eagerly to see who emerges as national champion on Jan. 2. People who are wise in the ways of sport are complimenting the University on its choice of Lou Holtz as the coach of the Irish. We are proud of Lou and every member of his staff and team. 
Alice McCabe 
guest column 

I would like to bring to your attention another wise choice on the part of Notre Dame. They have chosen this year as the Year of Cultural Diversity. Now, Notre Dame didn't have to choose this particular year for this focus; but somehow or other, they picked a special year to do this. On Nov. 20, 1988, Kat­harine Drexel, a pioneer in recognizing the giftedness of cultural diversity, is being beatified in St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. 
In our society a person is often recog­nized as a "star" after an outstanding performance, and is often acclaimed immediately as a hero or heroine. The 
Thoughts have value not their expression 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to Miss 
Susan Barton's letter of Nov. 10 dealing 
with the English language and the state 
of the nation. Firstly, there is someth­
ing to be said for being able to com­
municate one's beliefs. Theologians, 
artists, composers, and writers 
throughout history have sought to do 
this. This, however, does not preclude 
the fact that beliefs are most impor­
tant. Secondly, being able to write or 
speak does not always ensure clear 
thinking. 
I would venture to say that what a 
person thinks or believes is far more 
important than what one can write. 
There is a physicist, Stephen Hawking 
of Cambridge, who cannot speak nor 
does he possess any motor capability; 
yet, with assistants, he has written 
prominent books and is on the verge of 
discovering a Grand Unificiation the­
ory of atomic and astrophysics. 
I believe having an awareness of po-
Doonesbury 
Church, on the other hand, moves very slowly before conferring an honorary title on any of her members. The honorary titles are venerable, blessed, and saint in that order. According to the "Ceremonies of Beatification," translated by A.C. Iggleden: "The Church acts with the greatest caution; the merits of her heroes are scrutinized, their actions submitted to a severe examination, and often a cen­tury passes in detailed research before She will make a definite pronounce­ment." 
God is also asked to show His ap­proval by working miracles through the intercession of the person whose life is being studied. In the case of "cures," they must pass the judgment of the medical profession. If the "cure" could have come about by natural means, there is no miracle. 
What did Katharine Drexel do which made her so distinguished? Wealthy, educated, a Philadelphia socialite of the late 19th century, Katharine Drexel could make of life what she chose. That choice in the end came out of the strong Catholic faith and deep compassion for the poor which Katharine learned from her parents. While still a young woman, Katharine became aware of the desper­ate plight of the American Indians for whom she built fourteen boarding schools in eight different states. She was affronted, too, by the living condi­tions of Black Americans. 
As Katharine matured and her spir­itual life deepened, she was no longer satisfied to share only her wealth with the poor. She chose to give her whole life's energy to bring the liberating news of Christ to the Black and Indian races. On Feb. 12, 1891, she became a vowed religious and founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, who imme­diately began to serve and work with the Black and Indian people. Convinced that we are all brothers and sisters of one Father, Katharine led the young congregation to establish schools and catechetical and social centers on reservations in the rural South and in large urban areas. 
Her personal life, her writings, her actions, etc., have all passed favorably the scrutiny needed in the process of beatification. The necessary miracles have been declared authentic and she is now honored with the title of blessed. 
At the time of her death in March 1955, a Philadelphia newspaper wrote: 
P.O. Box Q 
litical nuances outweighs being able to express them. Poland's Lech Walesa (a representative worker) never struck me as a Nobel Laureate, but he rose to champion the cause of Solidarity (without a speechwriter). I doubt he possesses the equivalent of a college education, yet his beliefs made him a leader. 
I find it ironic to see criticism of a national education deficiency without mention of the present presidential ad­ministration's slash in education ex­penditures. If education is truly inte­gral to democracy, should it not stand high in governmental priority (i.e. spending)? George Bush reads wonder­ful speeches colored with rosy images of the supposed "universal" American way, while social classes polarize in­creasingly. I am led to believe that Bush won on his use of metaphors ("1000 points of light"); it would seem to be so. Orwell calls it "doublespeak." 
Individuals such as myself continu­ally attempt to encourage a greater po­litical awareness. I hope I am not also discounted in my thinking because of simple spelling errors. Maybe we should strive to perceive what we hear instead of proofreading syntax. Let's forget our own little language long enough to find out what other languages may be saying or thil)king or believing.

A time to salute the Irish Marching Band 
Dear Editor: 

Since moving· to the Notre Dame campus this past August, I have often been aware of the presence of the Notre Dame Marching Band. Sometimes this awareness has come from the sound of a drum cadence as the students were either going to or returning from a rehearsal, or a Saturday morning drill on the field before a game, a perfor­mance on the steps of the Administra­tion Building, or a thrilling step-off from Washington Hall with the music of the "Victory March" resounding in the air as the Fighting Irish Band made its way to the stadium for the pre-game, half-time and post-game shows. Whatever the occasion, be it informal

"One of the most remarkable women in the history of America was called home to God yesterday....She belongs so truly to all America, but especially to the poor and forgotten of the land....She was indeed a heroine of God." 
I am a Sister of the Blessed Sacra­ment, attending the Sabbatical Pro­gram for Church Leaders. Since I was in elementary school I have been a Notre Dame fan. I have grown in my love and esteem for all that is Notre Dame. Some of our Sisters are going to Rome because they knew or worked with Katharine DrexeL Five names were drawn at random. Mine was one of the lucky names. 
One of the hardest prices I had to pay to go to Rome was to part with my Penn State ticket. I'll be praying that the Irish use every bit of their talent in their remaining games. I'll also pray that we will be number one in our efforts to promote the success of this Year of Cul­tural Diversity so that we all may be one in Christ. 
Sr. Alice V. McCabe, S.B.S., is in the Program of Church Leaders at Notre Dame. 
or strictly formal, the presence of the Band has always brought a quickening of the pulse and a lifting of the heart that is difficult, if not impossible, to put into words. 
I thought it was time to give some special recognition to the Notre Dame Marching Band, which contributes so very much to the life and spirit of the campus and which makes such a posi­tive impact on the football season here. While the dedication and spirit of cooperation which every member of the ensemble brings to the Band is cer­tainly rewarded in excellent training for life, fun and friendships, yet the in­vestment of time, talent and energy on the part of all is something that deserves profound respect. 
Saturday, the final home football game, is surely an appropriate time to say a sincere "Thank you" to the Notre Dame Marching Band, its directors and their assistants, every single Band member, the Irish Guard and its excel­lent and spirited Drum Major, Mark Taylor, for another outstanding season.

This" or "Die Yuppie Scum," the Second City Etc.'s latest 

revue lives up to the 
theater's best. 
Second City Etc. is the "second string" of the more well-known mainstage Second City troupe. It is here in Piper's Alley (located di­rectly next to the mainstage entrance) that many promis­ing, young actors are given their first break into stand-up comedy. Second City Etc. provides an arena for the troupe to try out new materi­al. As a result, the ticket prices are a bit less than the mainstage admission price. 
The opening scene of the revue pits a haggard mother against her restless sons in a saber duel. The sons are not content with the mother's traditional nonviolent bedtime story and insist on adding vi­olent asides to it that would not even appear in R-rated movies. Finally, mom shocks her two sons with a little morbid tale of her own. The tale causes a sword fight be­tween the two sons. As mom jumps into the battle and defeats one of her sons, the other, played by Chris Barnes, yells "Prepare to die Ninja Mamma!" Chris Barnes, Jane Morris and Jeff

Michalski all play this scene excellently. 
Another amusing scene in the review involves a family's confrontation with their dead­head son. The son comes home stoned and his parents try to teach him a lesson by creating a hallucination of their own for him. When their lesson is over the father, played by Kevin Michael Doyle, remarks "Seven generations of alcoholics in our family and we end up with the first drug addict." 
The first act ends with a twisted back-alley rendition of "Born to Run." A bum, played by Chris Barnes, dreams of his moment in the spotlight. An assortment of characters join in, only to have the concert ended by the city police. 
The second act was high­lighted by a visit to the Chan­neling Institute. Players stepped off the stage and ven­tured into the realm of the dead: the Astral Plane. Audi­ence members were asked to play the roles of the client's ancestors. The scene demon­strated the sharp improvisa­tional talent of both the audi­ence and the cast. 
Following the scheduled performance, the actors took suggestions from the audi-

ence for improvisational scenes. Following a brief in­termission, the actors returned to the stage and per­formed scenes they devised around those suggestions. 
The quality of the improvs depends greatly upon the creativity of the audience members. However, the cast does a good job even when given mediocre ideas. It is apparent, unfortunately, that the cast members have several "stock" pieces, into which they simply plug in the suggestions. 
"I laughed, I cried, it was a gem," remarked noted Chicago actor Paul Grondy after the performance. He was right, it was indeed a gem. Although not mainstage, Second City Etc. more than lives up to the reputation of its predecessor. 
Second City Etc. plays Wed­nesday, Thursday, and Sun­day at 9 p.m. and Friday and Saturday at 8:30p.m. and 11 
p.m. Tickets cost $8.50-$9.50. Food and beverages are served at slightly inflated prices. For reservations call Second City Etc. at (312) 642­8189 .

f you ask any Chicagoan where to 
go for deep dish 
pizza, they usually 
divide into three camps. They'll tell you that there are Lou Malnati's people, Pizzeria Uno's and Due's people, and Gino's East people. Although each restau­rant offers pizza with a thick crust, fresh tomato sauce on top of a generous helping of cheese and other toppings, the variations in recipes are enough to keep pizza aficionados divided.

By THERESA KELLY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
In 1887, the official colors of 
the Penn State football team 
were pink and black, but the 
team switched to its second 
choices, blue and white, when 
the pink faded after exposure 
to sunlight. 
In 1988, the Penn State team, 
used to being counted among 
college football's elite, has 
faded as well. 
The Nittany Lions, who visit Notre Dame Stadium Saturday to battle the top-ranked and un­defeated Irish, will be on a mission--a loss to the Irish will drop Penn State to 5-6 on the season, ending the current string of 49 non-losing seasons, an NCAA record. 
In 1938, Penn State was 3-4-1. Since then it has posted a win­ning record every year, except for two 5-5 seasons--in 1965 and again in 1966--Head Coach Joe Paterno's first year at the helm. Since then, Paterno's Nittany Lions have recorded a 202-43-2 mark, winning more than 80 percent of their games. 
No, Penn State is not accus­tomed to losing football games. 
The situation brings back memories of two years ago, when the roles were reversed. The Irish were battling mediocrity while the Nittany Lions were unbeaten, untied and on their way to a national championship at the Fiesta Bowl after beating the Irish 24­19. 
The situation is reversed now, but Penn State has beaten the Irish three straight times and Irish head coach Lou Holtz isn't taking Paterno's squad for granted, even with the 5-5 record. 
"This is an awful good foot­ball team," Irish head coach Lou Holtz said. "In the five games that Penn State has lost, four of those teams combined have five losses. I think they have played awfully tough. We have nothing but respect for the Penn State football team." 
Despite the off week behind them and a game at second­ranked USC next week, the Irish players are not looking past the Nittany Lions. 
"There's no way I'm going to spend four years at Notre Dame and not beat Penn State once," Irish tri-captain Ned Bolcar said. "We've worked to hard to look past a game and sacrifice the whole season be­cause of it."

By that time, Schonewolf's size wasn't the only thing turn­ing people's heads. Without a doubt, this kid could play. 
"In high school, I was a lot bigger than most of the kids," he said. "And I was a pretty good athlete, I'd say. I could get by with my athletic ability and size. 
"Up here, you know, that helps me, but in no sense can I get by with that. There were a lot of techniques that took me a year or two to really get com­fortable with, and that's where I'm at now."

was the first of the Lion brass to visit the Schonewolf house­hold. 
But Schonewolf was far from sold. The high school senior wanted more time to look into other schools that offered him scholarships, like Duke, Rut­gers and Wake Forest. 
Schonewolf was convinced Penn State had a hidden agenda. Otherwise, why weren't more of the renowned Eastern schools inquiring about him? 
"A lot of other schools like Boston College, West Virginia, they didn't even recruit me," he rationalized. "I thought if West Virginia and Boston Col­lege aren't recruiting me and Penn State is, I thought maybe they just had token interest be­cause I was from Philadelphia or something like that." 
So Schonewolf traveled the recruit circuit and finally reached a decision--Duke.

"Coach Paterno said, 'You want to just give me another chance,' "Schonewolf said. "I said OK, just give me another couple of days to try to figure out what I want to do, and I thought about it." 
"I guess they convinced me that I could play here," he said. "I thought to myself if I could play at Penn State, that would be something that I really think I'd like to do." 
Four years, a few more pounds and one national cham­pionship ring later, Schonewolf is lining up as a defensive starter.

Lions freeze NO's 
title hopes in 1987 
By VIC LOMBARDI Sports Writer 
What do Texas A&M, Mic­higan, Florida State, Great Lakes, Georgia, Chicago and Penn State all have in com­mon? 
They're the only football teams who boast winning records against the Irish. 
But Joe Paterno's Nittany Lions have been especially un­kind to coach Lou Holtz in his first two years at Notre Dame. In the waning moments of the 1986 match-up, the Penn State defense deployed a ferocious goal-line stand that preserved a 24-19 victory over the Irish in Notre Dame Stadium. Last season's contest produced a repeat performance, as the Nit­tany Lions stuffed an Irish two­point conversion attempt with only 31 seconds remaining to win 21-20. 
The 1987 loss not only dropped the seventh-ranked Irish to 8-2 and out of national title contention, but it also trig­gered a three-game skid that ended with a 35-10 Cotton Bowl defeat against Texas A&M. 
The Irish entered a frigid Beaver Stadium, where snow 
ball team," said Schonewolf, "but there's no way they should have done to us what they did, piling up the yardage like that." 
Touch football in the streets of Northeast Philly and pickup games in the park seem so long ago. Now, for the first time in his collegiate career, the Nit­tany Lions are struggling. 
"It's always been a goal of mine to start, and you think of the tradition Penn State has," he says. "That's one of the big­gest reasons why I came here­-because there's always a good team. 
"Now, to finally get a chance to start and have the team slip up a little bit, it's kind of dis­appointing," he continued. "But at the same time, I don't think we're a bad team. I think something's missing, but I haven't figured out what it is. We're going to pull everything together." 
This is the year of the Lions'

squalls and swirling winds dipped the thermometer to mi­nus 20. Yet, Penn State tailback Blair Thomas came out on fire, amassing 214 yards on 35 carries. Holtz was impressed, but he gave credit to the Lions' offensive line, which controlled the line of scrimmage for most of the contest. 
The game opened on an awkward note. Facing a third down and 22, Paterno elected to quick kick. The strategy proved worthwhile as Notre Dame free safety Brandy Wells fumbled away the punt on the Irish 19, setting up Penn State's first TD. 
Two plays later, Lions' ful­lback John Greene plunged in from the 10 to make the score 7-0. 
Notre Dame evened the score on its next possession when Tony Rice ran into the end zone on a 32-yard quarterback draw. The drive featured a 29-yard screen play to Tim Brown. It was one of the few big plays for the senior flanker, whose 112 all-purpose yards fell way below his average Reisman pace.

discontent. After decades of prosperity, Penn State could suffer a rare losing season if it loses Saturday. Schonewolf maintains a year of eligibility next fall and has hinted that he'd like to return to the field for another year. 
"I'll need that extra semes­ter to graduate, so I'll definitely have to come back for school," the marketing major said. "My thinking is we have a tremendous amount of ability on this football team. I think we're going to have a few great seasons down the road, and I would just love to be a part of that next year. 
"I think we'll have a good team, and I'd love to be a part of it. If Joe wants me to come back, I'd be more than willing to. I guess it's really what he decides." 
A few years back, Schonewolf gave Paterno a second chance. Seems like Joe owes him one.

tough running and a few short passes. Greene capped the drive with 7:26 remaining in the game on a 3-yard scamper to make it 21-14 Penn State. 
But the Irish refused to buckle. After two possession changes, the Notre Dame of­fense had just 4:33 and 62 yards to get to the endzone. 
Rice used a mixture of short passes and runs to bring the Irish all the way to the Lion 1-yard line. From there, An­thony Johnson hammered through the middle to cut the lead 21-20 with just 31 seconds remaining.

The ensuing play was for all the marbles, and everyone knew the Irish were going for two. The Irish called a pass play. But Rice, confident that he could run it in, convinced Holtz during a timeout to change the call. 
"We had called a flood and if they (Penn State) over­shifted we'd go back to the op­tion," Holtz said. "He didn't feel comfortable with it so when Penn State called time, we changed because Tony said he could run it in. It was run all the way."

snap and rolled right. There was no way to get around the outside so he turned it in at the five. Defensive tackle Pete Curkendall grabbed the quar­terback by the legs and wrestled him to the ground. It was over. 
"All the dreams (of a na­tional championship) we had are gone," said a dejected Holtz after the game. "We were three yards from it (victory). Football's a game of inches." 
The victory gave Penn State a 6-5-1 record against the Irish. Just enough to place it in that elite group.

For $11.50, you can order a large cheese and sausage deep dish pizza. The thick crust is a Chicago-style staple, but Lou Malnati's layers of toppings make this pizza unique. The generous 
helping of cheese is covered by a layer of sausage--not sausage pieces. Lou Malnati's own tomato sauce tops off the dish. 
Uno's, located on the corner of Ohio and Wabash, and Due's down the block at On­tario and Wabash, are sister restaurants both located in the River North area of the city--home of Hard Rock Cafe and Ed DeBevics. Uno's and Due's can easily be located by the lines stretching out in front of the building. 
' 
Both pizzerias have been 
recently remodeled. Pictures of original owner Ike Sewell and copies of complimentary articles adorn the walls of these restaurants. Due's is a larger restaurant with an out­door porch for nice weather, while Uno's is the original 
home of Sewell's finest. 
Uno's and Due's large cheese ($11.69) on a good night is beyond compare. 
Thick crust topped with cheese and fresh tomato sauce make Uno's and Due's pizza one of Chicago's best. The sausage ($13.35) pizza resembles Malnati's because it also features a slab of sausage as opposed to small pieces. 
Gino's East, located at 160 
E. Superior just south of Water Tower Place offers similar pizza in a graffiti filled atmosphere. Be sure to bring a pen, knife or per­manent marker to leave a memory on the walls or tablecloths. 
Gino's large cheese piz­za($11.95) is a little skimpy on the cheese, and offers a different crust than the other two pizzerias. Gino's crust crumbles more than the toug­her crust of Due's and Mal­nati's. 
For fantastic Chicago-style deep dish pizza, these three pizzerias offer the best. However, all three are well known to Chicagoans and may be crowded, so either get there early or plan ahead. If you're looking for an ex­cuse to leave the Big Bend, Chicago style deep dish pizza and beer provides one.

~THE FIGHTIN' IRISH ARE BACK' NO's new rock and roll fight song 
DAVID DESALLE 
accent writer 

H 
ow often is it that one of your professors records and releases a song and even readily admits to being a staunch rock aficionado? If you are one of the thousand or so stu­dents that Dr. Tom V. Morris, an associate professor of phi­losophy, will instruct this year this may come as no great surprise. 
On Monday, Professor Mor­ris released the first major rock and roll fight song, "The Fightin' Irish Are Back." It is being sold on cassette in the bookstore as is a tee-shirt depicting a guitar-toting leprechaun logo. Both have full University approval. 
Morris describes the tune as "an up-beat, up-tempo rock and roll song." He wrote the words and music himself and sings and plays guitar in the song. Accompanying him are Jim Greulich, Ernie Scarbrough, and Greg Noble, local recording artists. 
"The Fightin' Irish Are Back," according to the liner notes, "registers the contem­porary resurgence of Notre Dame football." It has a very catchy tune that some beer commercial ad-man is prob­ably eagerly waiting to snatch up. The music is driving and the lyrics are ag­gressive over Morris' master-
The Fightin' Irish are back 
Oh boy you know The Fight1n' Irish are back We've been away a while

and we're gonna win The Fightin' Irish are back You can spread the news

ing with the students and being part of the University for the past eight years and found a great way to show it. 
Two years ago, Morris was sitting around the house fid­dling with his guitar when the guitar at the age of 12. He spent around 15 years before and during his undergraduate studies playing in a variety of rock and soul bands in the South, performing his specialty, soul music. 
He graduated from the Uni­versity of North Carolina (Chapel Hill) and later received his doctorate in phi­losophy and religious studies from Yale University. Accor­ding to Morris, "It was a short step from soul music to philosophy of religion." He has written eight books and countless articles on the sub­ject. 
In his present role as hus­band, father, professor, licensed North Carolina real estate broker, and author, Morris has no problem pursu­ing his musical interests. He said, "You can can be a per­son of the mind and also love rock music." 
It is possible that Morris will record again sometime in

Smoking as a Sacrament of the dying 
geon General's office on the effects of smoking. I reasoned: "Play now; pay later; so what? Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof." 

Is this my way of warning you not to smoke? Not in the least; smoke if you wish. Why should I want to lecture you like a broken-down sport? I am afraid if you see how beautifully I use smoking as a second language, you'll decide that that worthless habit is glamorous, fulfilling, and a way of putting your best foot forward as a man or woman of the world. Next, as an enhancement to smoking, you'll start drinking cocktails before lunch and dinner. From there, you'll be hanging out at oyster bars that fea­ture sushi and other fancy junk food that will lead you into an identity crisis, from which you will emerge as a phoney. You'll find youself waking up in the morning to ask: "Who am I? How did I get here? Where am I going?" Let me tell you, kid, you're going nowhere except to the store to buy a pack of fags you can start the day on. 
As a smoker, I'm not fit to be your role model; let me warn you of that. Scripture says that the wages of sin is death; that includes the social sins that seem so harmless that they aren't even venial enough to mention in confes­sion. I've been a social sinner all my life, not realizing I would have to pay the piper in full for all the dances I ever asked him to play for me. Yesterday, I found there's no such thing as a free lunch. The doctor handed me a sack of medicine, saying: "This is the first day of the rest of your life." My social sins are catching up with me. Life's little joke is that you can't get away with anything, for as Christopher Robin realizes when he's starting school: "They won't let you." You don't have to ask for whom the bell tolls. You don't have to ask who "they" are. 

If I continue smoking, that happy diversion is going to catch up with me, if it hasn't already; but heck, I've al­ways known that Lady Nico­tine can be a bitch, even she is my muse. 
To tell the truth, I like all of you a lot. If I can't give up smoking for my own sake, maybe I should do it out of consideration for you. Don't hold your breath, waiting for me to do it, but could you pray that I'll have the Christ­ian courage to think about it? If ten confirmed smokers should say: "We'll give up the weed, Father Griffin, if you'll give up the weed with us," I don't see how I could refuse to at least try. I'd try to give up smoking if only five, or even two, young smokers make that kind of an offer. I'd do it for the sake of one, if he or she were as much a slave to tobacco as I am. But that's impossible, because you're rank amateurs, and I've grown old as a smoker. 
When the time comes to die, I hope I'll have a rosary in my hand instead of a ciga­rette. When that dark hour comes, will I ask for a ciga­rette instead of the last Sacraments, with the weak excuse that I need one for the road? 
T 
he two great loves of my life have been writing and smoking cigarettes. In terms of pure devotion and energy expended, everything else has been secondary: love of God, love of family, service to the Church, the campus ministry. If this sounds shocking, per­haps I can explain myself in another way: smoking, like the aroma of incense, is a symbol of prayer. I smoke symbolically, as a way of worshipping God, and my

In 20 years of journalism, I have only missed meeting two deadlines. Juvenal, the Roman poet and satirist, wrote: "An incurable itch for scribbling (scribendi cacoethes) takes possession of many and grows inveterate in their insane hearts." I have scribendi cocoethes, and I have it bad. But I am even more faithful to smoking than I am to writing. I am better at smoking than I am at writing. I have managed to turn smoking into an art form. 
Smoking, if you do it grace­fully, has the solemnity of a mini-litury, which begins with learning the proper way to light a match, holding it away from you until the sulphured

I saw the 1940's movie "Now, Voyager" seven times to study the way Paul Henried would put two cigarettes in his mouth at once. Lighting both, he would offer one to Bette Davis, emitting bat squeaks of sen-

Bogart and Lauren Bacall 
smoking together was like 
watching an intimate love 
scene between creatures who 
celebrate life with a mating 
dance. 

Even in those days, there was nothing glamorous about an ashtray full of cigarette butts, reminding you of trashy novels of tired lovers, their bodies drained of pas­sion, waiting for the shabby dawn in a cheap hotel, as dead-ended in their affair as a burnt-out, discarded Lucky Strike. 
Why am I mentioning all this? Because I've started to feel uncomfortable when I see students smoking. I'm begin­ning to feel guilty for giving them a bad example. For many years, I have shrugged off the reports from the Sur-

WAKE UP THE ECHOES: NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL 100th Anniversary Edition 
We are proud to present, for the many fighting Irish fans, a completely updated and revised edition of "Wake Up the Echoes." Ken Rappoport, a widely recognized sportswriter for the Associated Press, has updated this complete history of Notre Dame football through the 1987, 100th anniversary season. 
Notre Dame. The name alone stands for football excellence. Knute Rockne, the Gipper, and the Four Horsemen. No school in America has the height, depth, and breadth of Notre Dame's football story. You will find out why between the pages of this classic title. 
Along with Rockne's "inspirational salesmanship," the Gipper's untamed flamboyance, and the hoofbeats of the Four Horsemen are the grandeur of Frank Leahy and the modern glories of Ara Parseghian, Dan Devine, and Gerry Faust, among other magical moments leading up to the naming of the new head coach Lou Holtz. 
Relive all of the rich memories in this definitive account of Notre Dame's 
glittering football history from 1887 to the present. "Wake Up the Echoes," is a classic volume of football history with over a hundred vintage photographs. 512 pages of exciting text, photographs and appendix. 
Available at your local bookstore or order now to reserve your copies, as this 
limited printing is already selling fast.

Irish squad on 'killing spree' 
Volleyball team looks to continue hot streak at W. Mich. 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
Kill, kill and kill again. 

It may sound like the scenario for a new horror film, but it actually is what the Notre Dame volleyball team has to do if it hopes to provide a happy ending to its 1988 season and year-long search for an NCAA bid. 
The Irish will try to maintain their momentum from last weekend's Golden Dome Clas­sic title as they travel to Kalamazoo, Mich., for the Western Michigan Invitational. 
Notre Dame has a little more incentive going into this weekend's matches after jumping from 19th to 16th in Tuesday's NCAA poll--the high­est ranking ever for the program, which has appeared in the top-20 two times earlier this season. 
"I like the ranking," said Irish head coach Art Lambert. "The girls certainly deserve it, but they're going to have to

Phelps is looking for a faster, more aggressive style of play from the Irish this year. The Irish heeded their coach's re­quest at last Sunday's Blue­Gold intrasquad game, where 140 points were scored in a 30­minute scrimmage.

prove that on the court this weekend." 
The Irish will take on Miami of Ohio Friday night and, depending upon that game's outcome, take on either host Western Michigan or Minnesota on Saturday night. 
Notre Dame has not faced Miami since 1983, when the Irish lost 3-0, but the Redskins are 12-15 thus far and currently are weathering a three-match losing skid. 
The Irish have faced both Western Michigan and Min­nesota earlier this season with mixed results. 
They defeated the Broncos, who now are 11-9, for the first time in four attempts on Oct. 17, sweeping them in three games, 15-8, 15-6 and 15-8. 
But Notre Dame was upset by 18-8 Minnesota on Oct. 21 during the last leg of its Octo­ber break roadtrip, 5-15, 12-15 and 4-15. 
The Irish will need to keep their hitting game at its current pace. The senior trio of Whit­ney Shewman, Maureen Shea

"We love to run, but we also have to realize that we have to run under control," said junior co-captain Jamere Jackson. "Playing run-and-gun is one thing, but we're going to play a disciplined run-and-gun sys­tem." 
Fellow co-captain Joe Fredrick led all scorers in the Blue-Gold game with 28 points, while Jackson added 24.

and Mary Kay Waller, as well as sophomore Tracey Shelton, have been pounding the volley­ball as of late. 
Shewman has a .531 hitting percentage over the last three games, while tallying 17 digs to bring her season total up to 249 digs for the year. 
Over the last seven matches, Shea has recorded a .448 hitting percentage. Waller has hit .409 and has added 18 service aces during the last eight matches. 
Waller, who is ranked eighth in the nation in blocking average, has registered 154 total blocks, 796 service aces and 347 kills, to lead the team in all of these categories. 
Shelton has proved she can play under pressure, hitting .389 during the Golden Dome Classic. 
"The key is to play smart and intelligent," said Lambert. "We have been playing very, very lately and I'd like to see us continue this way. Everyone will have to give 110 per cent and give a strong team effort." 
Ill., did not see action in the Blue-Gold game because of a Sunday night Freshman Semi­nar class with University pres­ident Fr. Edward Malloy. Friday's game will be his first 
performance in front of the Notre Dame fans, with the ex­ception of a midnight scrim­mage on Oct.14 that opened the team's practices. 
Other freshmen playing their first game against outside com­petition include Adkins, guard Elmer Bennett, Sweet and 6-11 Keith Tower. Junior walkon Tim Crawford also will be wearing a Notre Dame uniform for the first time.

seniors who start on the sideline against Penn State are effective leaders. 
"Not everybody can be first­team," Holtz said. "You've al­ways got to put the welfare of the team first and foremost. That's got to be No. 1, and that's difficult for some people to accept. 
"Some people really fight that, but it is a strong priority with us, and our senior class is great. I think the biggest thing this senior class has done is ac­cepted their role." 
They may not have the most glorious role, but without them, the Irish would not emerge from the tunnel Saturday as the No. 1 team in the nation.

BP looking to defend IH title 
By VIC LOMBARDI Sports Writer 
Defending champ Breen­Phillips (6-2) and Lewis (6-2) will square off Sunday at 1 p.m. on the heralded Notre Dame Stadium grass in women's In­terhall football championship. 
Breen-Phillips advanced to the finals by edging Pasquerella West 8-6 in the semi-final round. After losing the first two games of the season, the Blitz stormed back to win six straight, including a 22-8 stampede over Lewis. 
"They'll certainly have the revenge factor, but our heart is really in this one," said Breen-Phillips captain and middle linebacker Karen Marsh. 
The Lewis Chickens made it to the title game after handing Farley its first defeat of the season, a 13-6 upset in the semis. In fact, this is the first time in six years that Farley has not played in the title game. 
"We just can't pinpoint ex­actly what we did wrong against Lewis, but I know their quarterback is just an in­credible athlete," said Farley captain Karen Lynch. 
Lynch is referring to Lewis senior Ellen Mouch who rushed for one touchdown and threw another in the semi-final game. Her versatility makes it tough for defenses to stop the Lewis option attack. 
The Breen-Phillips offense relies mainly on the explosivP­I'Unning of freshman tailback Kristy Alkidas. In the victory over Lewis, Alkidas gained an amazing 235 yards on the ground. 
"She's just really quick to the hole and can break away from defenses," said Lewis captain Christine Wallmeyer. "We've been gearing our practices toward containing her. Last time, she ran on the turf, so hopefully the grass will slow her down." The Blitz go into the championship game with­out the services of senior quar­terback Teresa Coombs, who is sick with a virus. No other player on the BP crew ever has taken a snap at quarterback this season. 
Dillon, Stanford in finals again 
By DAVE McMAHON Sports Writer 
The playoffs have ended and the better teams have prevailed. In a rematch of last year's championship game, Dillon and Stanford will pass through the tunnel of Notre Dame Stadium Sunday to bat­tle for Interhall football brag­ging rights. 
Defending champion Dillon, a 24-0 winner over the Studs in last year's contest, takes a 5-1-1 record into the final game. 
Both teams will work with the game plan that has alowed them to reach the Fiesta Bowl of Interhall football. 
"We'll mix both the pass and the rush and play an extra tough defensive game," said Dillon captain Paul Drey. 
The Big Red does have the pressure of repeating, _but the Dillon players do not thmk that will be much of a factor. 
"The guys have a great atti­tude and we're ready to see if we can win it again," said Drey. . 
Injuries have plagued the B~g 
Red all season, and co-captam 
Gary O'Brien and Chris Poppy 
will remain out of action in the 
final game. 
"The extra week helped us 
nurse some of the injuries, but we still have two contributing players who won't be able to play in O'Brien and Poppy," said Drey. 
Stanford carries a 6-1 record into the game that has a great revenge factor in the eyes of at least one Stanford player. 
"There's definitely a fac­tor," said Stud running back Sean Gilboy. "Things went to­tally wrong for us last year. Not only did we play poorly, but some other things happened after the game that we didn't appreciate." 
The Studs, who have played in five of the last six champi­onship games, will use a power running game to try to win-· 
Flanner wins IH soccer 
By CHRIS FILLIO Sports Writer 
The fans attending last night's interhall soccer championship game be­tween Flanner and Pangborn could not have dreamed of a better, more evenly matched game to end the soccer season. 
Flanner won this year's title game 2-1 at Moose Krause Stadium in a match decided after two scoreless five-minute overtimes and twelve penalty kicks. 
"They played well and are a really classy team," said Pangborn goalie and captain Derek Weldon. "They placed their (penalty) kicks well, and we didn't." 
Pangborn initiated the scoring 13 minutes into the first half on a John Titterton goal, assisted by Dave DiLuciano. 
Flanner knotted the score at 1-1 with five minutes left in the half on Jim Keglivitz's tally off a herculean throw­in by stopper Mike "Hooch" Hickey. 
The second half was score­
less as both the Flanner and 
Pangborn defenses played 
outstandingly. While Hickey 
controlled Flanner's back­
field, goalie Tom Maloney 
once again held the opposi­
tion in check. The defensive 
corps of Pangborn saw ex­
cellent performances in the 
middle by sweeper John 
McDevitt and center ful­
lback Dave Hensler. 
"Pangborn has a team which plays well together," said Flanner captain Bart Fox. "This is as good a team as we've faced all season." 
After two scoreless over­times, the game was set to be decided by the best out of five penalty kicks per team, and then sudden death penalty kicks if necessary. For the Flanner team, Jim Keglovitz, Sean Fieber and Mike Calvani made their penalty kicks while Ralph Falbo missed and Garth Be­hrje's shot was stopped by Pangborn goalie Derek Wel­don. 
It appeared as if Pangborn might go quietly when Jeff Laurenson's initial attempt was stopped by Flanner keeper Tom Maloney. But Ted Schloesser and John McDevitt made their kicks before Bill Tolany missed. Steve Woolford came through under tremendous pressure by making the final shot for Pangborn to even it at 3-3 in kicks. 
Thelong,arduousjourney seemed anti-climactic for the two .teams as the first shots in sudden death were the decisive scores. For Flanner, Vovo Weydenthal beat Weldon on a perfectly­placed ball in the upper right-hand corner. Appro­priately so, the Flanner victory was completed when goalie Tom Maloney saved the shot from Pangborn's Dave Hensler.

NCAA MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION 


Site: Jester Park in Des Moines, Iowa Last Year: Notre Dame finished 7th 
Irish overcome adversities to reach NCAA finals 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
The Irish are bound for Des Moines, Iowa, where they will compete against the top 22 teams in the country in the 50th annual NCAA Cham­
pionships this 
Monday. 

Joe Plane
Notre Dame, ranked 15th in the latest NCAA poll, will be attending the meet for the second time in as many years, making it the first back-to-back appearance since 1965-1966. 
Last year the team finished an amazing seventh despite being seeded 21st for the race. This finish surprised the nation then, but people will be ready for the Irish this time. 
"Last year we just came out of the shadows and did it," said senior captain Dan Garrett. "It was almost easy be­cause we were the underdog and there was no pressure whatsoever. 
"If we could duplicate what we did last year, then I'd say we'd accom­plished more than last year." 
Another reason why it would be more of an accomplishment this year is be­cause the Irish have been swamped with injuries. They lost two of their top five runners, junior Mike O'Connor and sophomore Pat Kearns, losses that lead to a mid-season slump. 
The Irish started a downward slide at the Notre Dame Invitational on Oct. 7, finishing in a disappointing fourth. The team hit a season-low when it was trounced by USC Oct. 22. 
But the Irish staged a comeback, win­ning the MCC Championships Oct. 29 and coming up with a promising second-place finish in the District IV Championships last week, ensuring the team a bid to nationals. 
"When you have so few guys, and you lose two of your top five, you start to have doubts," said 14th-year Head Co­ach Joe Piane, who was named District IV Coach of the Year for the third straight year. "Apparently those injur-
Runners acknowledge roles 
Improving Cahill, Mulvey add depth to cross country 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
As the Notre Dame cross country team heads into its second consecutive NCAA Championships, a new kind of team has emerged. 
No longer are a few star at­heletes the key to the success of the team, but each and every runner plays a part in how well the team has done this season. 
The top five runners ex­pected to constitute the scoring at nationals are a solid group that knows all must run well in order to have a successful meet. 
Two competitors on this team who got off to shaky starts but have come on recently are senior Rick Mul­vey and sophomore Ryan Cahill. In the last two meets, these two have played a big part in lifting this team to the NCAA's and to a ranking of 15th in the latest NCAA poll. 
Their improvement began with the Midwestern Collegiate Conference Championships on Oct. 29. In the race, Mulvey finished 9th and Cahill lOth en route to an MCC title for the Irish. 
Last week at the District IV qualifying meet, Cahill and Mulvey continued their ascent by finishing 26th and 39th, respectively, ensuring Notre Dame a second-place district linish behind top-ranked Wis­consin and an Irish bid to na­tionals. 
These two have solidified the Irish running attack and made the Irish, depth-wise, one of the strongest in the country. 
Cahill, a native of Northbrook, Ill., struggled early but has come back in strong form. His 26th-place finish in 32:22.3 (10,000 meters) could not have come at a better time. 
"The kids all have confi­dence in Ryan Cahill, and that's really important," said Head Coach Joe Piane. "They learn it through practice that the kid can do it. They were just waiting for him to have that good race and he did on Saturday (at districts)." 
Cahill realizes his role in the upcoming national champion­ships. 
"I think that the pressure was so much greater at dis­tricts because we knew we all had to perform," said Cahill. "There was no margin for er­ror and I think that pressure

ies started a downward cycle. 
"I think the team finally realized at USC that they had to stop feeling sorry for themselves and just go out there and compete, doing what they're capa­ble of doing. You might call Notre Dame cross country the phoenix of cross country because they were dead and buried, and they sure came back." 
One factor that has recharged the Irish is the team's depth. Tom O'Rourke, Ryan Cahill and Rick Mul­vey have effectively reinforced the one­two punch of All-American hopefuls Ron Markezich and Dan Garrett. 
"We've got a solid group, and that's what it takes to run well at a big meet like the NCAA's," said Piane. 
Making it to nationals is an ac­complishment in itself. Most people do not realize there are 275 Division I cross country teams, which is more than the number of teams in either football or basketball. 
"Making it to nationals is half the thrill," said Ryan Cahill, "especially after all the adversities we've been through. It is actually more gratifying this year to be going." 
"I think you've got to give credit to the kids," said Piane. "These guys made a com­mitment two years ago that they were going to do it last year and they did, and they made a com­mitment right after the race that they were going to 


do it again."

helped. 
"For nationals I'm not think­ing I've got to finish in a certain spot. I've got my goals, Tom (O'Rourke) has his goals, and Rick (Mulvey) has his goals, but if we can all reach our goals together, it will be great for the team." 
Rick Mulvey, a fifth-year senior from Westfield, Wis., has come back from an early­season injury to contribute to a team plagued by injuries (see article above). 
The addition of Mulvey there­fore helps the team in three ways--as an injury gap-fiiler, as a valuable fifth-man, and as a seasoned leader. 
"He's not a rah rah-type guy," said Piane. "He just goes out there and does the job. He works very, very hard, and is as good a fifth-man as anyone. The fifth-man is usually the weakness of most teams, but to us he's definitely an asset." 
Mulvey's dedication to his sport also rubs off on his team­mates, which is another impor­tant asset. 
"Rick works harder than anyone I've ever met," said Cahill. "It has rubbed off on me and Tom (O'Rourke)."

Zadar club returns to face men's team 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 

The Notre Dame basketball team, with a highly-touted freshman class and a new style of play, begins its schedule with an exhibition game against Zadar of Yugoslavia tonight at 8 
p.m. in the Joyce ACC. 

In Zadar, the Irish will be facing a club team entering the stretch run of an American tour. Zadar held a 3-3 record before Thursday's game at Drake, defeating Youngstown State, Central Michigan and Bowling Green while losing to Kent State, Valparaiso and Toledo. 
Notre Dame defeated Zadar 120-81 in a pre­season game last year. Zadar returns four starters from that squad, and also has added 7-3, 265-pound center Stoyko Vrankovic. 
"Their center is their (Yugoslavia's) Olym­pic center." said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. "He's the guy that did very, very well over at Korea. He's got a slight sprained ankle, and he hasn't played. They're saving him for us because that's why we wanted them to come over, to bang our front line a little." 
Zadar's top returning players include 6-10 center Stipe Sarlija and 6-3 guard Darko Pahlic,

Hockey team to meet familiar opponent in Lake Forest 
By FRANK PASTOR Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame hockey -team (3-5-2) hopes to rebound from a winless weekend at Air Force when it takes on Lake Forest in a home-and-home se­ries this weekend. 
The Irish will play host to the Foresters Friday at 8:30 p.m. in the Joyce ACC Fieldhouse. The series will culminate at Lake Forest Saturday night at 7:30. 
"It's a big, early-season se­
" 
ries for us," said Irish coach Ric Schafer. ''Certainly, we need to experience the joys of winning again. We expect that this is going to be an exciting hockey weekend." 
Notre Dame owns a 16-7-1 all­time record against Lake For­est, which returns a number of starters from last year's squad. The '87-'88 Foresters dropped all five matches against the Irish, but never by more than two goals. 
"Lake Forest had a good team last year," said Schafer. "Fortunately, we played them five times and came out on top all five. But they were close games. I expect the same again this year." 
Notre Dame is coming off a weekend at Air Force which saw the Irish come away with a tie and a loss. The Falcons exploited the Irish defense for 94 shots on goal during the two games. Schafer points to the in­experience of the defensive corps as one reason for this bombardment. 
"We're a young, inexperi­enced hockey team," com­mented Schafer. "We've made plenty of mistakes already this season. Fortunately, Lance Madson has been in the goal to cover up for some of our mis­takes."

Women's fastbreak wears out Mexico 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's basketball team previewed the two weapons it hopes will carry the Irish to a NCAA tournament berth in an exhibition game last night at the Joyce ACC. 
Notre Dame defeated the Mexican National Team 80-52 Thursday by building a lead with a well-orchestrated fast break, then running away with the game in the second half behind a dominat­ing inside game. 
The Mexican team did not go down without a fight. The pesky visitors displayed their typical up-tempo, good-shot style of play characteristic of international teams to stay close through most of the first half. 
"They're scrappy and unorthodox," said Irish point guard Karen Robinson, "but they get the job done." 
The game was tied at 28-28 with five minutes remaining in the opening half when Robinson slipped past three defenders on the break to give her team the edge. She then repeated the scene moments later with another take-on-the-world move, and Notre Dame didn't look back. 
The spunky sophomore hit two more buckets

Seniors playing big role on and off field 
Being a senior in your last home football game 
eans a number of things at Notre Dame: 
It means you've played the best teams in college 
ootball and survived. 

It means you've seen "Wake Up the Echoes" and heard the "Victory March" more times than you care to remember. 
It means you can hold your helmet high in front of the Notre Dame students when it's over--win or lose--because you've given them four years of your best. 
And for many seniors, Saturday's final home game against Penn State marks the last time you'll have to stand on the Notre Dame sideline and cheer on the underclassman who has swiped your starting position. 
Wait a minute. Shouldn't we forget that last one? Isn't this a time to talk about nostalgia and the thought of celebrating four years in an Irish uniform with a national championship? Shouldn't we forget the anguish for now? 
The seniors already have taken care of that. 
They may not have forgotten the anguish. It's no secret that former starters like Flash Gordon, Ned Bolcar, Corny Southall and Tom Gorman were dis­appointed in their new back-up roles. 
But you would never know it from watching them on game day. 
"Flash Gordon, for a variety of reasons, didn't play a couple of football games," Head Coach Lou Holtz said of his fifth-year senior defensive end, who has been passed on the depth chart by freshman Arnold Ale and sophomore Andre Jones. "Did he like it? No. I sat down with him in my office and he wasn't a bit happy. 

Marty Strasen 
Sports Editor 
"But you could never tell Flash Gordon wasn't happy except in my office, and that was only after I called him in to talk about it. That's the type of person Flash Gordon is." 
That'"s also typical of the attitude taken on by a number of the other Irish seniors who are on the field less often than they were last year. 
Bolcar was named CBS television's Defensive Player of the Year in 1987, but now ranks third in playing time among fellow inside linebackers Wes Pritchett and Michael Stonebreaker. Gorman looked to be a starting defensive tackle, but was moved to the second-team offensive line when he returned from an early-season shoulder injury. Southall has been passed by junior Pat Terrell on the depth chart at free safety. 
"It was a big disappointment," Gorman said of the move to the sideline. "But you can't argue with success. The coaches thought it was best for the team, and you can't argue with 9-0." 
"I do wish I played a bit more," added Bolcar, who said he will consider applying for a fifth year to use his final year of eligibility. "I'd be a liar if I said I didn't want to play more, but I'm proud to be a captain and to contribute to an undefeated team." 
Southall, like Bolcar, has been seeing his share of playing time despite no longer being a starter. Time (no cliche intended) eases the pain. 
But sitting in the No. 1 position in the national polls also can heal the wounds of being No. 2 or 3 on the depth chart. 
"We're No. 1 in the country, and when you're winning, it makes things easier to accept," said Southall. 
But the attitude works the other way as well. 
Yes, winning fosters understanding. But under­standing also fosters winning, and that's why the
