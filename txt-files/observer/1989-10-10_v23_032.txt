The Arts and Letters lan­guage department, previously called the department of mod­ern and classical languages, has been reorganized into three new departments: German and Russian languages and litera­tures, classical and oriental languages and literatures, and romance languages and litera­tures. 
The languages were grouped into these three categories in accordance with their similari­ties, said Dean of the College of Arts and Letters Michael Loux.

BERLIN-Tens of thou­sands of demonstrators marched and shouted "We need freedom!" in Leipzig on Monday during the largest pro-democracy rally in East Germany since a 1953 work­ers' uprising, witnesses said. 
Protesters also held a vigil in East Berlin to demand democratic reforms after a weekend of demonstrations across this hard-line Commu­nist nation. 
On Saturday and Sunday, clashes broke out between po­lice and demonstrators with hundreds arrested, several in­juries, and one death reported by news organizations and witnesses. The government has issued no official toiL 

Christoph Wonneberger, pastor for the Lukas Lutheran Church in Leipzig, said "at least" 70,000 demonstrators marched in Leipzig on Monday night. 
Wonneberger said he was surprised by the restraint of police and paramilitary troops who were deployed nearby. 
"Even though this demon­stration is the largest (since 1953), to our knowledge it went off completely without violence," he said in a tele­phone interview with West Germany's ZDF television network.

Senate debate over racially offensive remarks goes on 

By SANDRA WIEGAND 
News Copy Editor 
Verbal complaints are not a satisfactory method of combat­ting faculty who make racially offensive remarks, said Rob Price, president of the Black Cultural Arts Council at the Student Senate meeting yester­day. 
Presently, all complaints to the provost's office are verbal, and often no complaints are on file for a specific faculty mem­ber because the complaints are not in written form, said Price. 
In regard to a recent incident Price said: "We wanted to meet with the provost and with the professor to discuss this issue ... so that they could be aware of what was happening. The provost told us that we can't make that move because this professor has no file. Our point was, you have no method of complaint, no form so that we can get complaints in his file ... 
the procedure is no procedure basically." 
"I think that there should be something where we are con­scious of exactly what to do, where to channel our com­plaints." he added. 
Student Senator Sigi Loya, who is working with minority club presidents, said they would be drawing up a proposal for the provost on this issue. 
The presentation of a pro­posal to the administration for a security escort service was approved at the senate meeting. 
The proposal will be given to Director of Security Rex Rakow this week and Student Activities will be contacted about the prospect of basing the service in LaFortune. 
Gina Mahony, the student who drew up the proposal, hopes to meet with the adminis­tration within the next week to receive their approval. 
If the proposal is approved,

partments) offers "more per­sonal attention for the stu­dents," Lanzinger said. He also hopes that the reorganization will provide a closer interaction among the faculty. 
The department's main goal is "to achieve bilingual compe­tence" through language in­struction, and to then build on that knowledge with a focus on literature, Lanzinger said. 
Associate Professor and Chairwoman of the romance languages and literatures de­partment JoAnn Della Neva stated that her first goal is to "really improve lower-level lan­guage courses." She has insti­tuted a video-oriented French class and would like to expand the concept. 
She also stresses communica­tion and improved speaking ability. 
Della Neva stated that her second goal is to improve and expand the graduate program by offering a graduate degree in Italian next year. 
Since the titles of the new departments include literature, each department is emphasizing this aspect. "Literature is really what the program is about," Della Neva said. It is only through reading the great works of a language that you can improve upon your under­standing and skills in that lan­guage, she added .. 
The German and Russian lan­guages and literatures depart­ment will be having an inaugu­ral AT&T Visiting Scholar lec­ture series about Russian and German literatures, as is the romance languages and Litera­tures department. 
The classical and oriental languages and literatures de­partment is also sponsoring an inaugural lecture series bring-

He said, "I consider this (police restraint) a very hopeful sign following the vio­lence" in earlier demonstra­tions.

associate professor of classical and oriental languages and lit­eratures. 
Having all the languages grouped into one department makes it "difficult for the de­partment to set common goals," Loux said. With three separate departments, each one will "be able to proceed with their own research agendas," he added. 
The division has been effective as of the beginning of the fall semester. Hopefully it will cre­ate more classes and thus de­crease class size, said Klaus Lanzinger, chairman and pro­fessor of German and Russian languages and literatures. 
He said that since the de­partments each have their own office in O'Shaughnessey Hall, the faculty is more available for consultation with the students.

1,320 pounds, is a faithful copy of Norwegian Johan Vaaler's 1899 invention, said Per Langanker of the Norwegian School of Management. "The paper clip is 100 percent accurate and fully functional if anyone has big enough paper," said Langanker, 23, of the school's student committee. The paper clip was made from steel tubing and is mounted on a 6-ton concrete base outside the institute in Baerum, an Oslo suburb. 
Pope John Paul II began a visit to the world's most populous Moslem nation Monday with a message of friendship and assurances that his Roman Catholic flock was loyal to Indonesia. In an atmosphere of controversy over a scheduled stop in East Timor, a predominantly Catholic former Portuguese territory annexed by Indonesia in 1976, John Paul sought to make clear that Catholics were no threat to the archipelago's unity. "I have come as a friend to all Indonesians, with a great respect for all the people of this dynamic nation," he said. 
NATO on Monday began a month-long naval exercise in the western Mediterranean that includes forces from Spain and France. France and Spain, which are not part of NATO's inte­grated military structure, are joining the "Deterrence Force" ex­ercise as part of normal training relations with the allies, NATO said. Greece, which declined to take part in the "Display Determi­nation" maneuvers last month in the eastern Mediterranean, sent the frigate Elli to take part in the current exercise that ends Nov. 14.

lnform.Jt,on comp,led from Observer w~res and Observer staff reports 
Senioritis is not all that it is cracked up to be. 
As an underclassman, I often found my mind 
wandering away from my studies and dreaming 
of the days, when, as a proud Notre Dame se­
nior, I would be able to lay around like a slug. 
What a rude awakening I have undergone in 
the past few weeks. Contrary to all expectations, 
I have discovered that the most common 
symptom of senioritis is stress. A study was re­
cently conducted in which several physiological 
measurements were used to determine stress 
levels in college students as a function of their 
year in college. The highest stress levels were 
found in seniors, followed closely by freshmen, 
with sophomores and juniors bringing up the 
rear. 

To me, at least, this shows that stress tends to accompany times of monumental change. For the college senior, this change is perhaps most acute. The real world, like the Grim Reaper him­self, is rapping with bony knuckles upon his door. 
Indeed, many changes and important events 
take place in one's senior year. But, I would like 
to focus here on one particularly nerve-fraying 
phenomenon: the Interview. 

I happen to be interviewing at medical schools, but I am certain that my misadventures are not restricted to pre-meds. 
The interview experience begins as soon as you receive a happy letter from a prospective school or place of employment, "inviting" you to attend "a friendly meeting for a mutual ex­change of information." Do not be fooled by these people; they are professionals. The san­guine letter they send is merely the set-up for the bloodbath that is to follow. The manifold compliments contained within are analogous to the increased feed that is given to turkeys prior to Thanksgiving. 
Lets look at the facts. The places at which you are interviewing (schools or businesses) usually speak with five or six times as many students as they are planning to admit. Given this fact alone, it begins to seem rather unlikely that the interviewing goal of the companies or schools is really to "get to know you better as a person." 
It would be inappropriate to even call this no­tion euphemistic -it is an out and out lie. 
I purport that the sole purpose for the inter­view is to verbally and psychologically bludgeon you until your personal weaknesses are clearly spelled out by profuse sweating, stuttering or (in an interviewer's dream) an all-out nervous breakdown. Medical schools sometimes refer to this process as "ascertaining the presence of unfavorable mental qualities in the applicant." 
Consider an example. A friend of mine, let us call him Hunna to protect his identity, recently finished an interview that opened up with ques­tions about his religion. The inter­viewer/torturer then proceeded to challenge Hunna's specific moral beliefs and use his views to illuminate contradictions and weaknesses in the reasons for Hunna's beliefs. 
After about 40 minutes of this hell, the inter­viewer left the student with this comforting tip: "I noticed that you got a little nervous during the ethical questions, Hunna, because you kept playing with your shoe. It might be a good idea to avoid doing that in future interviews." 
At this point, you are probably beginning to get a little worried and asking, "But what can I do about this interviewing horror?" 
In a word, the key is PREPARATION. 
In the span of time between your "invitation" to interview and the actual interview you should realize that the school or business is not just sitting back and chilling out. No siree, your record and preliminary application materials

are being painstakingly scrutinized, people from 
your proximate and distant past are being con­
tacted, phones are being tapped, and mail is be­
ing monitored. 
Thus, you should be ready for the following 
scenario: "Gee Greg, your participation in the 
basket-weaving club is impressive ... Oh, what's 
this newspaper clipping mixed in with your file ... 
Well I'll bet, it's a police report in which you 
were cited for ... " 
Also beware of the subtle approach. 
Interviewer: "What do you feel is the greatest 
single problem facing medicine today?" Greg: 
"It's got to be medical incompetence." Inter­
viewer: "I think that you're absolutely correct, 
but speaking of incompetence, I noticed that in 
your second semester of organic chemistry 
you ... " 
Get the idea. In addition, interviewers love to throw curves just to see how much you can sweat up your new interviewing suit. My per­sonal favorite is this loaded question: "Boy, you certainly have an excellent record, but can you tell me about an incident of which you are most ashamed?" 
The interviewee who has done his homework will be ready for kidney punches like this and respond in the following manner: "Well, I re­member one time when I saw a school bus crash. I successfully performed CPR on eight of the children, but when I got to the ninth it was too late... he had already passed away. I am most ashamed of the fact that I did not work faster on the first eight." 
Just one more instructive example, sometimes a lazy interviewer will play on your honesty to give him the ammo he needs to waste you. Con­sider the following question: "Greg, you seem to have many favorable characteristics, what would you say are some of your unfavorable traits?" 
Once again, the crafty college student can thwart this bullet by responding in the following way: "It's hard to say this, man, but sometimes it occurs to me that I just care too much for other people and consequently I neglect my own welfare." 
The experienced student will incorporate statements like this into explanations of poor grades, i.e. "Yeah, that's what happened to me in second semester Orgo, my roommate was having some problems, and I just got excessively caught up in helping him." 
My goal in this article has not been to get you more stressed than you are already, but merely to prepare you for the psychological catfights that await you in the interview. Hemember, when you walk into that office, the interviewer is not thinking: "I wonder how many good things I can discover about this charming col­lege student," but rather, "what junk can I un­earth from this loser's past that I can use to justify tossing his application into the garbage."

Panamanian coup leader buried, opposition leader ends his fast 

Associated Press 
PANAMA CITY, Panama­The army major who led the unsuccessful coup against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was buried Monday and opposition leader Guillermo Endara ended a 19-day hunger strike. 
Several reports have said an enraged Noriega personally shot Maj. Moises Giroldi, 38, to death minutes after the coup attempt against the Panama­nian leader ended a week ago. 
Giroldi's relatives said he was shot once in the neck and twice in the chest. His mother, Eloisa, cried "They murdered him!" and flung herself on the coffin. 
The major led an uprising Oct. 3 and captured Noriega, who commands the Panama­nian military and controls the government, but gave up when loyalists counterattacked while 
U.S. troops looked on from a few hundred yards away. 
Officials of the Panamanian Defense Forces said eight offi­cers and two sergeants were killed. They have not explained the circumstances or responded to reports that some were slain after surrendering. 
Endara ended his fast and entered a clinic to "normalize my body's system." 
A medical bulletin said his "conscious process was excel­lent and his conversation co­herent," but he was suffering "from progressive debilita­tion." 
The opposition leader has urged Panamanians to delay paying taxes and utility bills, and to shun the government lottery and casinos, on which the government has depended for much of its revenue the past 18 months. 
The United States has applied economic sanctions against Panama since federal grand juries in Florida indicted Nor­iega in February 1988 on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. 
Noriega claims all efforts to oust him are part of a U.S. plot to retain control of the Panama Canal after 1999, when it is to be turned over under treaties signed in 1977. 
At a news conference, Endara said he felt his hunger strike was a success. He said the op­position did not approve of the coup because it represented "Noriegaism without Noriega," not a movement toward democ­racy. 
Capt. Leon Tejada, another rebel, was buried at the same small red stone church over the weekend. "He had one bullet wound in the right temple," said Tejada's mother, Esther, who was at the church again for Giroldi's burial. 
About 100 people attended the funeral Mass for Giroldi. 

Anti-nuclear activists try to ground shuttle

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.­The countdown for this week's planned launch of space shuttle Atlantis began Monday as NASA headed for a court showdown with anti-nuclear activists seeking to stop the flight because of its plutonium­powered payload. 
If a federal judge approves, Atlantis is to blast off at 1:29 
p.m. Thursday with five astro­nauts who are to dispatch the Galileo spacecraft with its nu­clear generators on the start of a six-year journey to Jupiter.

U.S. university reopens in Beirut 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon-Hun­dreds of students returned to campus Monday when the American University of Beirut reopened after being closed for six months, its longest shut­down since the sectarian civil war began 14 years ago. 
"The whole family's back," said Radwan Mawlawi, spokesman for AUB, the alma mater of the Arab world's elite and once the most admired uni­versity in the Middle East. 
The cafeteria was packed 
with students, who hugged each other and renewed friendships. Others jammed the campus post office, checking their ac­cumulated mail. 
Mawlawi said the campus was hit several times by ar­tillery fire, causing "extensive damage ... that has now been re­paired." 
"Everything's in place. The faculty and students are here," he said. Syrian troops and Le­banese police in red berets checked student ID cards at the three gates of the tree-lined campus overlooking the Mediterranean in Moslem west Beirut. 
"Beirut's life is throbbing again now that the university has reopened," said a police­man who strolled through the campus. 
It was not known how many of the 5,000 students returned on Monday. Ghada Sheib, a Shiite Moslem architecture stu­dent, said: ''I'm very happy to be back. Let's hope it'll last." 
Many students and other res­idents of Beirut share her doubts about the durability of a r.ease-fire that began Sept. 22.

The launch opponents con­tend that an explosion on liftoff could spread cancer-causing plutonium over a large area of east-central Florida. 
NASA officials argue the two nuclear generators aboard the Galileo spacecraft have been thoroughly tested and that fly­ing them poses minimal health and environmental risks. Simi­lar devices have flown on 22 other U.S. spacecraft without a problem. 
"We're going to count down to a launch on Thursday unless we are told to stop," NASA test director Ron Phelps said Mon­day as the countdown got under way. He described Atlantis as in "terrific shape." 
The astronauts assigned to the mission flew here Monday from their training base in Houston for final flight prepa­rations. All five have said they are not worried about the plu­tonium in the cargo bay. 
"My family is going to be down there watching the launch, as well as other people that I love, and so I'm not con­cerned about it; I feel it's safe," said Ellen Baker, one of the crew members. 
The others are commander Donald Williams, pilot Mike McCulley, Franklin Chang-Diaz and Shannon Lucid.

HUD spent $35 million on last day of fiscal '88 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON-Federal HUD officials approved $35 million in loans on thn last day of fiscal 1988 in an apparnnt rush to spend the money before it was transferred to another program, according to auditors and agency documents. 
Most of the Snetion 312 mul­tifamily housing loans were ap­proved despite incomplete ap­plications or processing, ac­cording to auditors who alerted the· department's general coun­sel to the questionable loans. The auditors wem told the gov­ernment was legally bound to fund nearly all of them. 
"Where commitments were made they were honored, but (HUD) will not be making con­ditional commitments in the fu­ture," said Housing and Urban Development spokesman Jack Flynn. 
Section 312 multifamily housing loans totaling more than $40 million were approved in the final month of fiscal 1988 -out of about $100 mil­lion budgeted for the entire lis­cal yea,r -including $35.3 mil­lion on Sept. 30, 1988, the final day of the budget year, accord­ing to IIUD records. 
During that eight-hour work day, 107 loans ranging from $15,000 to $6.1 million for conversion of a Spokane, Wash., hotel were approved, the records show. 
A subsequent review of HUD records by The Associated Press found that 130 loans to­taling $40.8 million were ap­proved in September 1988, all but 23 of them, totaling $5.5 million, on the final day.

DRINKgOD DRINKS GOD 
"I was trying to drink God out of the bottom of a bottle. If I would drink enough, I'd have done it." 
That Is a paraphrase of a statement made by Bill Wilson -one of the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous. While looking for the most he could get out of life, he found alcohol. As a result, he couldn't keep a job or friends. His marriage was In jeopardy. He was suffering ill-health emotionally, physically and spiritually. 
As he began a process of recovery ( with the help of his co­founder -Dr. Robert Smith), he began to realize that there was a great possibility that rather than sidetracking him from his quest, alcohol was leading him to a process of accomplishing it. The more he admitted how unmanageable his life became because of alcohol, the more rigorous his quest for meaning was to become. 
As the Notre Dame community celebrates Alcohol Awareness Week (October 8-15), It might he of value to Investigate some or the spiritual aspects of alcohol consumption. Approaching the topic from the point of view of persons most seriously Impaired by alcohol does not serve well In giving warning to those with no disease predisposition, but such an approach could help identify some universal drives of Imbiber and non­Imbiber alike. 
Alcohol plays a central role In the life of the Notre Dame community. The President's Task Force of Whole Health and the Use and Abuse of Alcohol began Its report last spring with a very sober statement: NOTRE DAME HAS AN ALCOHOL PROBLEM. 
So, a thesis: A primary goal of the consumption of alcohol at Notre Dame Is to alter consciousness. A primary reason we drink alcohol Is to become or to feel other than who we are. Our desire to "become other" might be temporary or It might be permanent. But, It Is "Suggested, It Is the common denominator of most drinking at Notre Dame. 
Why would we want to be other than who we are? A number of reasons could be suggested (and some of them might even be valid!): 
We don't like who we are. 
We want to be someone else. 
We don't like how we feel. 
We wanl to feel something else. 
We want other people to think we're someone else. 
It's a way to do things we otherwise wouldn't do or even 
think of doing, but want to do. 
We have a desire ·to go somewhere beyond ourselves. 
The suggestion Is that most of the time we at Notre Dame drink alcoholic beverages In quantity we do so for one or more of the above reasons. We might not like how we feel now, or feel about ourselves now, and want that to change for now. Or we might not like how we feel ever, and want that to change forever. But rarely do we at Notre Dame drink alcohol merely because we are thirsty or because we like the taste. 
The bad news side of the task force statement on Notre Dame's alcohol problem Is that the role alcohol plays In the life of the university community Is detrimental to Its health. If any of the above reasons for drinking are true, we can conclude that many members of the Notre Dame community don't like themselves as they are or don't like what they feel much of the time or want others to see them In ways other than as they are. 
The good news might be that the Notre Dame community has a strong desire to move beyond Itself. In other words, many people at Notre Dame have a great spiritual thirst, but most of us have not found healthy ways to satisfy that thirst. 
For Bill Wilson, Bob Smith and millions of other alcoholics, alcohol came to be seen as the metaphor for their spiritual quest. They were Indeed attempting to drink the meaning of life out of the bottom of a bottle. So are we. Alcohol becomes a mode of transport for our journey Into the world of the spirit. When we use alcohol as a proxy for the spiritual journey, what feels like fulfillment under the Influence really Is a great emptiness which cannot be felt because of pleasure's own narcotic effect. 
Any spiritual journey Is a process of moving from self and Increasing conscious contact with and awareness of a power greater than ourselves: Allah, Buddah, Jehovah, Adona!, Yahweh, God. The journey leads to an understanding of existing not to satisfy senses or ego but to grow along spiritual lines beyond what Is explicitly known, felt or seen Into a relationship with God as God becomes understood. 
When we move beyond the narcotic and acknowledge great emptiness, we experience God most profoundly. When we are so rubbed up against our own will and our own pleasure and great emptiness then we know God Is present, waiting to be recognized and seen. 
Then alcohol can take Its rightful place In our lives and our real journey can begin.

Varmus called the research a "cornerstone in understanding the genetic mosaic of cancer." 
"The basic idea that we helped establish is that cancer has its origins in genes that normally do us some good. But after they become abnormal through mutation, they cause a role in cancer," he said.

Bishop said winning the award was "surreal," while Varmus said it was startling

At a news conference at the University of California Medical Center, Bishop and Varmus were optimistic about the practical applications of their work, how it helps understand the nature of cancer and possi­bly some aspects of the AIDS virus. 
But they were cautious about forecasting a cancer cure in the foreseeable future. 
"This is just another step in what's a long journey," Bishop said. "It's very difficult to pre­dict when a full view of the cancer cell will be at hand." 
Although Varmus stressed that he and Bishop "stand on the shoulders of those who came before us," at least one running, but nevertheless, there are a lot of other good people in there too.... It's a shock," 
said Varmus, dressed casually in blue jeans and a red and white striped shirt, and a light beard that was apparently the result of a hasty shaving job. 
Varmus, 49, who once hoped to become an English profes­sor, said he abandoned his studies of 17th century litera­ture to attend medical school. He said he switched fields after learning that writer Gertrude Stein had enrolled at Johns Hopkins Medical School after being told that "medicine opens all doors." 
Gradually, he discovered he enjoyed being in the laboratory more than the clinic, and his research career began, he said.

NEW YORK-Metromedia Co. Chairman John Werner Kluge is worth an estimated $5.2 billion, but he had to back into first place on Forbes magazine's annual list of the 400 richest Americans. 
Kluge displaced Sam Walton, head of the Wal-Mart stores discount chain, who divided his $9 billion fortune among him­self and his four children and ended a four-year reign as Forbes's wealthiest person. 
Notre Dame alumnus Edward DeBartolo, 80, of Boardman, Ohio is number 42 on the Forbes list. DeBartolo's esti­mated net worth: $1.4 billion, mostly in shopping centers.

That total wealth would come just short of bailing out the nation's failed savings and loans over the next 30 years, the cost of which was estimated by Congress at $285 billion. 
The list appears in the Oct. 23 edition of Forbes and is based on estimated holdings as of Sept. 8. 
The prototypical member of Forbes' ultra-rich was a 63­year-old male with 3.1 children working on his 1.4th marriage with a net worth of $672 mil­lion last year, more than the gross national product of Le­sotho, Forbes said.

Soviet scientists vouch for UFO landing in park 

Associated Press 
MOSCOW-It was a close en­counter of the Communist kind. 
Towering. tiny-headed hu­manoids from outer space landed their UFO in the Russian city of Voronezh and emerged for a promenade around the park, spreading fear among residents. 
At least that's what the offi­cial Tass news agency said Monday. 
Tass. contributing to a string of weird tales that have crept into the formerly stuffy state­controlled media in recent months, said in a straight­faced report that Soviet scien­
tists  vouched  for  the  UFO's  
landing.  
"Scientists have  confirmed  

that an unidentified flying ob­ject recently landed in a park in the Russian city of Voronezh," Tass said. "They have also identified the landing site and found traces of aliens who 
Nuclear plant operator did not heed warning 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON-The opera­tor of the Rocky Flats nuclear arms plant near Denver knew as narly as 1984 that danger­ous amounts of radioactive plutonium may have accumu­lated in building air ducts but failed to act on the information, a former employee said Monday. 
James Stone, a utility design engineer at the site from 1980 to 1986, said he raised the probability of such plutonium deposits -and the safety haz­ard they would pose -with Hockwell International Corp., which operates the plant under an Energy Department con­tract. 
"They said we cannot afford to clean it," Stone said in a telephone interview. 
Stone's suspicion of a buildup of plutonium residue in the ven­tilation system at Hocky Flats was borne out by a team of in­dependent investigators who disclosed in a report to the En­ergy Dnpartment last week that such plutonium deposits raised "a real possibility" of an acci­dental nuclear chain reaction at Rocky Flats. 
An accidental nuclear reac­tion could release lethal amounts of radiation to plant worknrs. 
The independent investiga­tors, dispatched to the weapons plant in July by Energy Secre­tary James Watkins, reported finding 11 pounds of weapon­grade plutonium in a pipe that serves as an exhaust ventilation duct at one of the plant's main buildings. 
The amount of plutonium residue was more than enough to cause an uncontrolled nu­clear reaction under certain circumstances but was not an immediate danger to the public or the workers because it was not escaping from the ducts. the investigators said. 
Rockwell had insisted prior to the investigation that no plu­tonium was accumulating in air ducts, the investigators said. 
The investigation was con­ducted by a team of nuclear ex­
perts from Scientech Inc., an 
Idaho Falls, Idaho, engineering 
and management company. The 
probe raised many questions 
about the safety of Hockwell's 
operations and suggested that 
plant workers had not voiced 
all safety concerns out of fear 
of retaliation. 

Larry Ybarrondo, president 
of Scientech, said in a telephone 
interview that the investigators 
verified that Stone had warned 
Rockwell about the plutonium 
problem. 

Rockwell last month an­
nounced it was withdrawing 
from Rocky Flats because of a 
disagreement with the Energy 
Department over liability for 
possible criminal acts in con­
nection with waste disposal and 
other plant operations. An 
Idaho company, EG&G Inc., last 
Friday signed a contract to 
take over Rocky Flats on Jan. 
1, 1990. 

Stone said he realized the probability of plutonium de­posits in the ventilation system in 1984 while he was helping to plan a renovation of Building 881, a former site of uranium and plutonium processing that now is used as a laboratory and computer center. 
Stone said Rockwell did not act on his advice that the hun­dreds of feet of stainless steel ducts be sandblasted or cleaned in some other way to remove any plutonium buildup. 
"It wasn't part of the original scope of their work so they weren't going to do it," he said, even though Rockwell possessed the technical capability to test for the presence of plutonium residue in the ventilation system. 
Roger Mattson, a vice presi­dent of Scientech and leader of the Rocky Flats investigation, said in a telephone interview that his group found 11 pounds of plutonium in the ventilation system of Building 771, where plutonium is processed in 
··gloveboxes." Rockwell shut down several of the gloveboxes after the discovery in August and began taking steps to cor­rect the problem, he said.

Florida Rep. who is a doctor gets heat for abortion ruling

TALLAHASSEE, Fla.-A first-term state representative and physician is in the center of Florida's abortion storm this week because he's the only leg­islator who performs abor­tions. making him a lightning rod for protests. 
Ben Graber even gets hate mail. 
"They need something to marshal their forces around," he said of abortion opponents. 
The obstetrician-gynecologist's Pompano Beach women's clinic drew a raucous demonstration Saturday, three days before the state Legislature was to begin a special session on abortion called by Gov. Bob Martinez. 
"They were frustrated by the (Florida) Supreme Court deci­sion. They decided to make me the target, an ideal situation with the legislative session coming up," Graber said Mon­day. 
The state Supreme Court last week cited the state privacy law to strike down a 1988 statute requ1rmg minors to get parental consent for abortion, uphold a woman's unrestricted right to abortion in the first trimester, and emphasize indi­vidual privacy rights in abor­tion decision-making. 
The governor acted within weeks of the U.S. Supreme Court's July 3 ruling upholding Missouri state restrictions on abortions, making Florida the first state since then to call a

British deny involvement with Hong Kong activists 
Associated Press 
LONDON-The Foreign Of­fice on Monday rejected a Chi­nese official's aceusation that Britain is conniving with ac­tivists in Hong Kong to over­throw China's government. 
The Chinese army's attacks on pro-democracy students in June, which left hundreds dead, "are the cause of the loss of confidence in Hong Kong," said a Foreign Office spokesman. 
The British colony is sched­uled to revert to Chinese rule in 1997. 
"As for the view that we have connived at acts of sabotage in an attempt to overthrow the Chinese government, that is quite wrong," said the spokesman, speaking on condi­tion of anonymity. 
"The people of Hong Kong attach great importance to democratic freedoms, under their own legal system," he said. "Equally it is important that such freedoms are used with a sense of responsibility.

(Crimea, Donetsk, the area where miners recently went on strike, Voroshilovgrad) are completely Russian-speaking where people are more inter­ested in economic and social reform. On the other hand, there 'are certain elements in our society which pay no atten­tion to the national issues, hurting the radical majority in traditional Ukrainian-speaking areas. How can we bridge the two extremes? I believe that there is but one way: the delib­erate enlightenment of people with different points of view, making them aware of the im­portance of both national and economic matters. This is a challenge for all Ukrainian in­tellectuals who are proud daughters and sons of their land. Chances are that by working together, they can unite a divided nation. 
Chances are... When will they become reality? Nobody can answer for sure. Meanwhile, as I've stressed above, there are some signs of awakening, but we are far from being wide awake. We are still quiet Ukrainians, though our backs are unbending, and our voices are sounding louder. I am re­minded of the famous words of Lincoln: "You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you can't fool all the people all or the time." 
There was a time in the Ukraine when even the recipe for a cake had to be approved by officials in Moscow. Then people realized that this was absurd, and they beearne furi­ous. I guess the more days that pass, the wiser (or more sober) we will become. Finally, we will rush to the point which far­sighted people have already seen. I mean a prosperous Ukraine within the Union of sovereign republics.

MARCH ON THE CAPITOL 
NO students and national organizations band together for the homeless 
Michelle Berninger accent writer 

"Power concedes nothing without a de­mand. It never has, and it never wilL" These words inspired the Housing NOW! March on Washington, D.C. last Satur­day. 
Twenty-three Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students joined 200,000 to 300,000 other protesters from across the country to march from the Washington 
The march was a culmination of a week of protests to demand decent, affordable shelter as a hu­man right in the United States. 
Monument to the CapitoL Along with the students, over 60 people from the com­munity travelled in buses to Washington, 
D.C. on Friday afternoon and marched the next morning. 
The march was a culmination of a week of protests to demand decent, af­fordable shelter as a human right in the United States. From a stage behind the Capitol, Rev. Jesse Jackson, actress Su­san Dey and others spoke out against homelessness, and musicians such as Tracy Chapman, and the Jefferson Star­ship entertained the crowds. Over 200 other celebrities were present to help draw attention to the housing problem which has left no corner of America un­touched. 
According to Kathleen Hoyer, coordina­tor of Service/Social Actions Groups for the Center for Social Concerns, participa­tion in the march was a good way for students to work with the local commu­nity on an important issue, and under­stand how social changes take place in a democratic society. 
Several of the participating students are involved in CILA, or work at the 
ND students rallied with thousands of 
other 

You know what to do 
I finally broke down and bought an answering machine. I really had no choice in that AT&T was having a 2 for 1 sale and had I not acted now I would not have been able to save 50%. Although, had I bought nothing I would have saved 100%, but I guess they'd rather not have us look at it that way. 
I think that they should sim­ply be honest about it, and come right out in the ad and say that if you buy now you'll only lose 50% as compared to the 100% you usually lose when you buy something. I can just see the ads now, "Honest Abe's Midnight Madness Sale, buy NOW and LOSE UP TO 75%!!!" 
The problem I'm having, though, is that I can't think of a good message for the machine. Sure, it came with a pre­recorded message, but the guy who recorded it sounds like the kind of person who would starch his shorts, just for kicks. This is not exactly the kind of image I'm trying to convey. And let's not forget, image is EVERYTHING. I mean, this is your machine-it's your bud­dy. If you don't have a ma­chine, you're nobody. Your rna-
DAN FONTANA 
... The Real World 
chine is your gateway to the Age of Communication, and the message you leave on it is be­coming more important then the color of your tie. You know you're a success when you not only have a machine, but you've created THE message. 
This is why I'm so worried: you can tell a lot about a person from the outgoing message they leave. For example, you can tell that someone who leaves the message, ''I'm sorry, but I'm unable to come to the phone now (etc.)," is a damn poor liar. 
You know who you are. EVE­RYONE knows that you could come to the phone, but that you're screening your calls to avoid talking to that person who cannot get it through his or her thick skull that you are more attracted, sexually, to bullfrogs then to them, and that they should stop calling. 
Not that honesty, in this situ­ation, is all that good an idea ei­ther. Once I heard a message that said, ''I'm screening my calls so say something and if I recognize your voice and like you I'll pick up." This is the kind of person who would get a call from his mother, not pick up, and later wonder why she stopped sending money. I think, by the way, that this would be a good time to men­tion that those Outgoing Mes­sage Tapes fall into the same category as clip-on power ties. Need I elaborate? I think not. 
Another thing to look out for is a message that's too long. Nobody wants to call you and sit there for 30 seconds listen­ing to you drone on about who knows what. What they want is to get to the part where they hear the beep and use the "S" and "F" words at you for leav­ing that damn thing on in the first place. 
So your goal should be to have a short message that cre­ates a kind of "Beemer" image. Namely, that you have enough money to lose $40,000 on a car that performs no better then one at half the loss. The reason you need this image is that the person calling may very well be looking to go out with you. Ob­viously, this new trend of burp­ing into the machine is unac­homeless shelter in South Bend, but many others were motivated solely by the idea of such a huge march. 
"This national event was an effective way of initiating action for housing the homeless on a local level," said Mary Sue Twohy, one of the student organizers of the trip. "The experience of the march was very unifying." 
One of the most moving speeches of the day was an address made by a 9-year-old homeless child to President Bush, who was at Camp David at the time. 
The march was attended by people of all ages and from many groups, but also by many homeless from other cities. This fact, according to Notre Dame participant Dave Palumbro, was one of the most posi­tive aspects of the march. "It was neat to think that these homeless people were marching for a problem that they shared with the homeless of Washington." 
Another student, Jeanne Ballot, called the march "an incredible experience." The emotion felt by such a national call to action was enhanced by the large number of different people participating for the same cause. "There were a lot of groups represented with many individual caus­es," she said, "but they were all united for one reason." 
The march occurred at a time when most experts now estimate the number of homeless Americans at 3 million, with families representing the fastest growing sector of the homeless population. Today, the nation's capital is experiencing the largest increase in homeless families. 
The Housing NOW! brochure claims that at the start of Ronald Reagan's first term, the U.S. spent $7 on defense for every $1 spent on housing. Today, the ra­tio is $44 to $1. Furthermore, since 1980, Budget Authority for all federal housing assistance programs has been cut by more than 75 percent-from $32 to $7.5 billion a year. 
These are the types of statistics that the Housing NOW! coalition of over 200 organizations hopes to change. 

ceptable. Burps simply do not turn on prospective dates (un­less it's a really good burp). 
Most importantly, you must not insult the caller's intelli­gence. For example, you need not tell them that you are not answering the phone person­ally. Obviously you're not home or you wouldn't sound like Darth Vader on helium. You need also not tell them to l~ave a message. I mean, come on, what else would they leave? Recipes? For that matter, why bother telling them to leave their name and number? Don't they KNOW that much by now? This is almost the '90's you know. 
Come to think of it, I think what I'll do with my machine is to skip the message. I'll just set it up so that when a person calls, it just beeps and that's that. I figure this will create a kind of intelligent, yet "with it" sort of image. I mean, if any­one calls, hears the beep, and doesn't know what to do, I'm not to terribly sure I want to talk to them anyway. 
Dan Fontana will be a regular Accent columnist.

Sorin reached the end zone in the third quarter with a 20­yard pass, which had been set up by Mark Massinopale's in­terception.

Howe plans to return to NHL 
Associated Press 

DETHOIT -Gordie Howe, who rPtired in 1980 as hockey's all-time scoring leader after a 26-year career, says he will return to the ice in 1990 to add another record to his long list of achievements -playing in six decades. 
The 61-year-old !lowe, who finished his NIIL career with 1,850 points, said he plans to rejoin the Hartford Whalers for one game next year. Howe finished his career with Hartford in 1980 after a career spent mostly with the Detroit Hed Wings. 
Asked Sunday what he thought about Wayne Gretzky's drive to topple his point record, Howe said he planned to set a new record and challenged Gretzky to match it. He and the Los Angeles Kings star are friends_ 
Howe watched Gretzky pick up three assists in 5-0 victory over the Red Wings in Los Angeles on Sunday night to move within seven points of Howe's career point mark_ 
"The only record I'm going to make sure about is that I'm going to come out of retirement after the New Year to play one more game in the '90s so that I've played in six decades," Howe told the Detroit Free Press. "Then I challenge the little guy (Gretzky) to do that." 
Howe also holds the NHL records for most seasons (26), games (1,767), goals (801), game-winning goals (122), All­Star selections (21) and playoff appearances (20). 
Howe played for Detroit from 1946-71 and for Hartford in 1980. 
If Gretzky stays on pace he will break Howe's scoring record this year in his 11th season-15 seasons sooner than it took !lowe to achieve that milestone.

Islanders beat Canucks 5-2· Bruins down Canadians 2-0 
Associated Press 
VANCOUVER, British 
Columbia -The New York Is­
landers scored four times 
within five minutes in the third 
period and rallied to beat the 
Vancouver Canucks 5-2 Mon­
day. 
Goals by David Volek, Doug 
Crossman, Brent Sutter and 
Alan Kerr wiped out a 2-1 Van­
couver lead. 
Vokek, who assisted on two 
other goals, tied the score when 
he batted in a rebound at 
14:06. Crossman and Sutter scored on power plays and Kerr added an empty-net marker to complete the come­back. The Islanders had lost their first two games of the season. 
Patrick Flatley scored the 
other New York goal and com­
bined with Volek and Sutter to 
form the most dangerous at­
tacking unit. 
Vancouver scorers were Petri 
Skriko and Paul Reinhart as the 
Canucks dropped to 1-2. 
In the third, New York fired 
19 shots at Vancouver goalie 
Steve Weeks, who kept the 
Canucks in the game until the 
last five minutes. New York fin­
ished with 30 shots on goal, 
while the Canucks had 37 shots 
on Glen Healy, who made sev­
eral difficult saves during the 
scoreless opening period, most 
of them during two Vancouver 
power plays. 
Vancouver scored 33 seconds 
into the second when Skriko's 
long shot from inside the blue 
line handcuffed Healy. 
The Islanders picked up the tempo in the second and were rewarded at 5:28 when Flatley converted a pass from Volek. 
The play was started by a sharp headman pass from de­fenseman Jeff Norton in the neutral zone. 
The Canucks failed to finish several good scoring chances in the second. Larionov put a backhander behind Healy and through the crease on a break­away, while Krutov rattled a rising backhander off the post. 
Reinhart gave the Canucks a 2-1 lead at 5:59 of the third. 
Bruins 2, Canadiens 0 
Cam Neeley and Randy Bur­ridge scored in the first period and goalie Reggie Lemelin earned his ninth NHL shutout as the Boston Bruins edged Montreal Monday night for their first regular season vic­tory over the Canadiens since Feb. 4, 1988. 
Lemelin, making his 1989-90 season debut, had 24 saves as the Bruins improved their record to 2-1 while handing Canadiens their first loss in three starts. 
The Bruins, 0-7-1 against Montreal last season, peppered goalie Brian Hayward with 40 shots, while dominating the ac­tion after the opening minutes. 
Boston outshot Montreal 15­5 in the first period 
Neely broke a scoreless standoff at 11:44 when he took a passout from Craig Janney and scored from just outside the crease for his third power play of the season. 
Then, at 19:57, Burridge took a pass from Glen Wesley and sent s short flip past Brian Hayward for his first goal a split second before he was

The Irish did not panic after 
this early goal. They eventually 
settled down and engineered 
some scoring chances of their 
own, although unsuccessful. At 
halftime, the Irish were down 
1-0. Nevertheless, they believed 
that they could play with their 
opponent, according to senior 
co-captain Dave Augustyn. 
Early in the second hal f. Santa Clara quickly squashed any aspirations the Irish had of pulling off the upset. In a span of 7:33. Santa Clara erupted for three goals to put the game out of reach. for the remainder of the half they continw1d to dominate play at both ends of the field. Santa Clara ended up out shooting the Irish, 17-3. 
"They were really a great team. We had some ehances in the first half and felt good that we were still in it," said Augustyn in assessing the game. "Then. in the second half, their offense took over." 
With the conclusion of the weekend games, the Irish remain winless in their last five games. In the downslide, the Irish have been outscored 12-4. Things do not get any easier on the Irish schedule either. This Friday night, they play top­twenty ranked Akron University at Krause Stadium. All this is reason for concern to Augustyn. 
"We are a long way from finding ourselves as a team. We're stagnant right now," said the senior defender. "I felt we played our best game yet against Indiana last week (a 3­1 loss), but we haven't built on it; we haven't gone any further as a team." 
Indeed the Irish do have the personnel and the potential to be a top twenty team. They have shown flashes of brilliance against some of the nation's best teams this season. If they can come together more as a cohesive unit and play consistently well, the Irish soccer team believes it can definitely achieve its, goal of making the NCAA tournament. 
"It's a long road left. We have a lot of games to play," Augustyn said. "If we start off with a good game against Akron and build off of it, I don't see why we can't move on and make the NCAA tournament."

Athletics worth the wait for loyal fans 

Associated Press 
OAKLAND, Calif.-The Oakland Athletics missed a flight from Toronto and didn't ex,pect many fans to welcome them home early Monday after winning the American League pennant. 
But they were surprised. 
At least 500 enthusiastic fans 
were waiting at Oakland Inter­
national Airport when their 
heroes appeared shortly after 1 
a.m. Some fans had waited sev­eral hours for the team. 
"We got ready to leave Toronto and someone said we'd get home too late and there wouldn't be anybody waiting for us," A's Manager Tony La Russa said, as the crowd let out a roar. 
Dave Stewart, the winning pitcher in Sunday's 4-3 victory over the Blue Jays, and La Russa joined several players who walked from the cpstoms clearance area to an outdoor podium in the balmy night air. 
"We went to Toronto and we decided to have a little fun, but we still have some unfinished business," Stewart told the crowd, including some who wore green body paint and blond wigs. "And this time, 

we're going to try and get it 
done." 
Other fans carried or wore 
A's paraphernalia to show their 
euphoria over Oakland's second 
straight AL pennant, the first 
team to accomplish that feat in 
11 years. 
"You go through every game 
with them, and you've just got 
to come out and support 
them," said Tony Tenorio, 18, 
of Alameda, an Ohlone College 
baseball player who was there 
to greet the A's. 
Harry Legendre, of Antioch, wore a bright gold wig, an A's jacket and T-shirt and rang a cowbell with a team logo. He arrived at 10:30 p.m. 
"My wife thinks I'm nuts," 
Legendre said. ''I'm a diehard 
fan. I think the team is. more 
with it this year. It came too 
easy for them last year." 
Gladys Stout, who said she was in her 70s, arrived with her granddaughter and great­granddaughter. 
"I want to see those A's come in," said Stout, who wore an A's cap and golf-ball sized gold earrings with an A's logo. "I just want to be here."

"We're sticking it out, doesn't matter how late," Martha 
Johnston of Oakland said, an 
hour before the team arrived. 
"How many opportunities like 
this do you get? I'll call in sick 
if I have to, but I'll be here until 
they're here." 
At many sports clubs in the 
Oakland area, people cele­
brated, then quickly made way 
for fans of the San Francisco 
Giants, whose fourth game in 
the National League playoffs 
began an hour after the A's vic­
tory. 
The Giants also won, and on 
Monday they tried to beat the 
Chicago Cubs and win the Na­
tional League pennant, creating 
a Bay Bridge World Series. 
Some patrons at McGee's Bar 
and Grill in Alameda were less 
than thrilled Sunday night 
about the possiblility of a Bay 
Bridge World Series. Some A's 
fans worried that if the Giants 
won the Series, they would suf­

workers or relatives who root 
for San Francisco.

NO men's golf leads tourney 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame men's golf team is in first place in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference Golf Championships after 36-holes of play Monday at the Weatherwax Municipal Golf Course in Middletown, Ohio. 
The Irish have 601 thus far in the 54-hole tournament, as they hold a healthy lead over second-place Xavier, who stands at 616 and Dayton and Marquette who are in third and fourth place with 627 and 630 points, respectively. 
Notre Dame is led by Mike O'Connell, whose 75 and 73 put him one stroke ahead of Xavier's Jeff Lancaster at 148. 
His teammate Pat Mohan, who had led the pack after the first round of play, dropped into third place with rounds of 7 4 and 76 for a two-round total of 150. 
Irish golfers Paul Nolte and Dave Regnier are tied for fourth with 152 going into today's final 18 holes of play. 


AP Photo Mark Grace of the Chicago Cubs and his fellow first baseman Will Clark of the San Francisco Giants were stalwarts on their squads during the National League pennant race decided Monday by the Giants 3-2 win. Both turned in record performances during the series as Grace hit .647 with one homer and eight RBI and Clark tallied two dingers and eight RBI to hit 650. 
Grace, Clark etch names in record book wielding big sticks ~n playoffs 
Associated Press 
SAN FHANCISCO -San Francisco's victory over Chicago for the National League pennant will become a line in the record book someday. The confrontation between Will Clark and Mark Grace may become legendary. 
For five games, it was like watching Lou Gehrig go after Mel Ott. 
For the record, Clark went 13-for-20 (.650) with two homers and eight RBis. Grace was 11-for-17 (.647) with one homer and eight HBis. 
Not a bad month for some. 
Just when it seemed Clark had reached ultimate human potential. he singled with the bases loaded and two outs in the eighth inning off Mitch Williams on Monday to give the Giants a 3-2 victory and the NL pennant. 
"We've all see supreme athletes in all sports rise to the occasion," Giants manager Roger Craig said of Clark, the series' MVP. "But you won't see what he did today. This was unreal. You've got one of the best left-banders in the game out there, bases loaded, in a tough situation, 0-2 count, and he gets a base hit." 
Clark set NL playoff records with 13 hits, eight runs and 24 total bases. 
"I don't really think about what Mark is doing," Clark said. "When he's up I know he's hot and a threat, but I don't worry about the numbers." 
There are a lot of numbers to fret about, too. Clark and Grace had slugging

percentages that resemble zip codes to Mars, and they are becoming must reading in the playofr record book. 
Grace had 11 hits in 17 
playoff at-bats with three 
doubles, one triple and one 
homer for a 1.118 slugging 
percentage. He also had eight 
RBis in the series, second most 
in NL playoff history. 

Clark finished with a 1.200 slugging percentage. 
"I had a good series," Grace said. "But it wasn't enough. I'll trade the stats to be able to play in the World Series any day." 
Watching Clark and Grace, one gets the feeling the best is yet to come. 
"You're seeing the first basemen of the '90s," Giants manager Roger Craig said. "I can't imagine a better performance from two players than they have given." 
In Game 1 at Wrigley Field, Clark was 4-for-4 with two homers and six HBis. He hit a grand slam clear out of Wrigley Field in the fourth inning and never more looked the part of "The Natural." 
The slam climbed into the Chicago night as the crowd fell still. The cameras caught Clark's pretty swing and his trot down the first-base line. Only the exploding light tower was missing. 
"Yeah, that was something I'll remember," Clark said. "Winning it all is what really mattered though." 
Grace, not to be outdone, went 3-for-4 with two RBis in the opener. 
"I admire Will Clark and I try

to be the kind of player he is," 
Grace said. "But I'm not a 
power hitter." 

Maybe not, but Grace sure 
looked like one in the playoffs. 
In the Cubs' 9-5 victory in 
Game 2, Grace went 3-for-4 
with four HBis. 

Clark and Grace each had two 
hits in Game 3, and kept it 
going Sunday night. 

Clark had two doubles, a single and scored twice and Grace had two RBis, including a triple. 
Clark's 13 hits in the series broke the record held by Terry Puhl, Ozzie Smith and Jeffrey Leonard. Of course, Grace surpassed them, too. 
The performances by Clark and Grace while outstanding, really aren't all that shocking. 
In three major-league seasons, Clark has a .304 average with 98 homers and 352 RBis. This season, he finished second to Tony Gwynn in batting with a .333 average. 
"I would have liked to win the batting title, but I'm here and Tony's not," Clark said. 
As a rookie for the Cubs last season, Grace hit .296 with seven home runs -all on the road. 
He led the Cubs with a .314 average this year and hit 13 homers with 79 RBis. 
Clark and Grace are also among the best defensive first basemen around. 
"It's been exciting to watch them go at it," Chicago manager Don Zimmer said. 

"Mark knows he's not where Will Clark is right now, though."

Reuschel outpitches Cubs to help Giants 

them, pumping his fist and 
hugging everyone. 
"This is a highlight," said the 
champagne-drenched Reuschel,. 
who lost a game for the Giants 
in his only previous playoff 
appearance against St. Louis 
two years ago. 
"I had no idea it could feel 
this good. I think I deserve a 
little bit of celebration. It's 
been a long haul." 
Reuschel said that before the 
game he gave little thought to 
his Game 2 shellacking. 
"There was no problem (forgetting Game 2)." he said. "It was a piece of cake. I've done it so many times in my career." 
He also didn't think he 
pitched much differently this 
time, except for keeping the 
ball down a little more. 
But his teammates could 
sense a difference, even before 
he took the mound. 
"You could tell when Big Daddy's on," Giants slugger Kevin Mitchell said. "He was quiet in the clubhouse earlier. He always is. But you know he's there and he's going to be there spiritually. I knew he was going to throw a good game. Big Daddy was so calm out there." 
"He's been doing it all year, ever since we've had him (since 1987) and he can still do it," said Giants president AI Rosen. "Reuschel gives you great stuff all the time. 
"When they get to him, they get to him very early. If they don't get to him early, it's all over. He just knows how to pitch. He keeps coming at you with strikes, changing speeds, breaking balls. He knows all about it." 
The first jam Reuschel escaped was in the first inning, when he gave up two singles. But he struck out Andre Dawson to end the threat. 
The only run Reuschel gave up was an unearned one in the third, and a simple flip of the sunglasses by Mitchell might have prevented that. 
The early afternoon sun shone blindingly over the rim of baking Candlestick Park when Chicago's Jerome Walton popped up to shallow left in front of Mitchell. 

Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -Rick 
Reuschel, the burly Big Daddy 
of the San Francisco Giants, 
put an emphatic end to 
suggestions that his arm might 
be tired. 
The 40-year-old right-hander, 
clobbered by the Chicago Cubs 
in Game 2 of the NL playoffs, 
pitched like a master to win 
Game 5 Monday and give the 
Giants their first National 
League pennant since 1962. 
Pitching on three days' rest 
after giving up five runs on five 
hits in two-thirds of an inning, 
Reuschel held Chicago to seven 
hits and an unearned run 
through eight innings to win 3­
2. 
He also proved he can be 
counted on by the Giants when 
the Bay Bridge World Series 
begins Saturday at Oakland. 
"He had a big monkey to shed today, and he went out there and proved why he won over 200 games," Giants pitcher Mike Krukow said. "The pressure was on him ... and he absolutely dealt. He pitched out of jams all day long. It was a thing of beauty to watch the way he mixed speeds." 
Reuschel, a 6-foot-3, 240­pounder who sports a beefy belly, jowls and a small mustache, is a quiet, bookish leader. He rarely gets excited by victories and never worries about losses. 
He wasn't particularly upset about the Game 2 loss. As usual, he took the attitude that he went to work, did his job and couldn't be blamed because the ball didn't go where he wanted it or that the Chicago batters hit it. 
He also didn't worry about suggestions by writers and Giants manager Roger Craig that perhaps his arm was tired after going 17-8 during a season in which he also was the starter in the AJI-Star Game. 
Reuschel went to work against the Cubs with his usual bag of tricks -85 mph fastballs, slow fastballs. slower fastballs and breaking balls ­before leaving for the pinch­hitter who started the Giants' winning rally in the eighth. 
This time Reuschel abandoned his stoic pose and celebrated on the field with his teammates, shouting with
