Anti-Redlining bills ineffective, disclosure laws too lenient 
by Jack Pizzolato Senior Staff Reporter 
Editor's Note: This is the second in a three-part series on the nation­wide problem of "redlining" in mortgage loan procedures with particular emphasis on the practice in the South Bend area. The first article introduced the problem and some of the arguments advanced by each side -the lenders and their potential cUents. The second article deals with the Home Mort­gage Disclosure Act of 1975, dis­cussing the effect it has had and some of the weaknesses of the law. The final article will outline some of the solutions that have been pro­posed or already instituted in other

History prof selected for I iterary award 
A new book on revivalism in the Catholic Church by Dr. Jay P. Dolan, assistant professor of his­tory at Notre Dame, has been selected for the Frank O'Malley Publication Series Award by the College of Arts and Letters and the Notre Dame Press. The author receives a $500 advance against future royalties for the manuscript which will be published later this year. 
The award is named for a distinguished Notre Dame teacher who inspired thousands of stu­dents, including a Pulitzer Prize winner, during his tenure from 1933 until his death on May 7, 
1974.  Faculty  members  in  the  
College of Arts  and  Letters  are  
eligible for the competition.  

Dolan's book, "Catholic Revival­ism in the U.S.: 1830-1900," traces the current popularity of Pentacos­talism among American Catholics to the "soul-stirring and body­warming" preaching that attracted our ancestors in the last century. He calls revivalism the "spearhead of a widespread religious awaken­ing among American Catholics, an awakening whose strength was manifested inthe success it achiev­

Dolan, winner of the prestigious

believes that certain conditions in

cluded the increased immigration

1971-72 student disciplinary violations revealed 
by Thomas O'NeU Editor-In. Chief 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Documents re­tahied by past student government judicial coordinators at Notre Dame -relating .to cases of student mis­conduct which went before the University Appeals Board during 1971 and 1972 have recently been located in the Student Government 
offices. 
The documents were found by The Observer In a IDe cabinet generally considered to be open to publlc access. 
The following article which in­cludes information from those documents, does not Include either the names of the persons involved in these cases or any information which could lead to their Identifi­cation. 
After examining these docu­ments, The Observer brought their existence to the attention of current

The other side: 
.Retirement policy defended 
Compulsory retirement stan­dards, responsible for the refusal of the University to rehire Prof. James Danehy, are intended pri­marily to provide opportunities for younger people, according to sev­eral Notre Dame professors. 
Compulsory retirement is not new, nor is it peculiar to Notre Dame. Every major corporation, agen~y, university, and business has some type of policy regarding retirement. 
Donald P. Kommers, director of the Center for Civil Rights outlined some general reasons for the policy. 
"I guess the theory of the law is that there is a greater need for the young to get a chance. Compulsory retirement opens up spaces at the lower end of the pole," he stated. "Opportunities would be even harder for the younger people if there weren't any." 
Kommers added that he does not approve or disapprove of the University's policy, especially in this instance, because he does not know all the facts. He explained that he could speak only in terms of generalities concerning the system as a whole across the nation. 
Professor Jeremiah Freeman, chairman of the Chemistry Depart­ment, agreed with the idea of compulsory retirement "to open the~.,,-" ·£()r young people. 
There are currently professors on campus who are past 65, but still teaching. They are subject to reapproval each year by their department. According to Free­man, Danehy was asked last fall to submit his case for a departmental approval. Danehy submitted a

the public in the future due to their sensitive nature. 
Eight cases of student mlscon­duct are reported in the docia­ments. Only three of these cases are described in detaU in the documents and referred to in this article. 
A student entertaining a female cousin in his room well after the cessation of parietals was dis­covered by a resident priest on October 29, 1972. In a letter dated November 5, the priest wrote to the then Dean of Students Fr. James 
1 Riehle, "I observed that (the girl) was wearing a nightgown, bath­robe and slippers and that her kit for putting up her hair was pre­
. pared on the desk." 
The student insisted to Riehle that his relationship with his cousin was "familiar, never sexual," but was penalized by the dean with a $50 fine and three semesters of disciplinary probation, a penalty which prohibits a student from participating in extracurricular act­
ivities. The student then approached the Appeals Board, the body desig­
tee who reviewed his case and voted against reappointment. 
Freeman explained that he did not know the exact reasons for the committee's decision since it is decided in conference, but he added that many factors are taken into consideration. 
"The question we have to an­swer is 'What is best for the department?' " he said. "It's a long term problem of what is best. It's not that there is anything terribly wrong with Prof. Danehy. In effect, Danehy wants us to provide reasons as to why he shouldn't be kept on while we want reasons why he should." 
-

Freeman expressed surprise at the student reaction, explaining that students tend to automatically think that simply because a teacher is leaving the replacement will be inferior. 
Kommers also was surprised at the student reaction to compulsory retirement because it has been at Notre Dame and nationwide for some time. 
John Santos, professor of psych­ology and director of the Center for the Aging, explained the history of forced retirement. 
"It all goes back to the 1930's when the New Dealers were for­ming all the Social Security legisla­tion," stated Santos. "They picked 65 because it was the age used by Western. Europe since the 19th century. The age 65 has nothing to 
with anything biological, mental or 
social, it is simply a standard set by 
European countries." 
According to Santos any age 
could have been selected, but the 
need was to have a definite 
standard nated t~ review decisions of the dean of students, for consideration of the case. 

. In a letter to the Appeals Board, the student referred to a past ''difficult period of loneliness ... all stemming from frustration and ending in tears." He added that his cousin had provided emotional support and helped him overcome his depression. 
The board, however, refused to reconsider the penalty, declaring that it was "not inappropriate" and that "it served as a warning and reminder" to the student in the future. 
Marijuana Offender 
Other documents revealed the experience of a senior whose guilt was upheld by the Appeals Board in March, 1971, for "being present at a marihuana (sic) party." The board believed his presence there ''implied his actual violation of the University rule" against marijuana use. 
The board also charged the student had been warned previous­ly by his hall rector "about the 
"across the board" will invariably affect someone who wishes to keep on working but it is easier to deal with ·generalities than to take the time for every individual case. 
Danehy's objection is based on dissatisfaction with the ambiguity of the faculty manual and the conflict of policy of forced retire­

. ment with his civil rights;. The question of the constitutionality of compulsory retirement will proba­bly appear more in the courts during the next few years as more individuals fight the law, in the view of Santos. But, according to both Freeman and Kommers, there is some legitimacy in the general idea of opening places for young
people. 
"I think that overall it is a must," said Freeman. "Some people must leave to make room for others. From a young person's viewpoint it can only help."

The board decided "after being advised by a competent psycho­logical authority," that "repeated violations of the University Rule (on drugs) after being warned could be a symptom of a psycho­logical problem for the accused." The board recommended pro­fessional psychological help for the student. 
Penalty for the offense amounted to the student presenting himself for "suitable constructive activity" four hours a week. "Constructive" activity was defined as "physical activity'' by the board.

.The Jimmy Carter Show 

like it or not, there is a strong possibility that Notre Dame's commencement this year could be accurately referred to as ·The Jimmy Carter Show by seniors unhappy with its outcome. It is undoubtedly a great honor to have the President of the United States give the commencement address. But instead of an occasion intended to honor 2160 diploma recipients for their academic accomplishments, this year's commencement may become one solely honoring an American president. 
Already many factions of the University community are clamouring for seats on May 22, even though no decisions pertain­ing to commencement seating will be made before Aprill. Students (non-seniors), the families of graduates, administrators, faculty, staff personnel, the spouses of all these people, plus the local and national press and politicians all want to attend the ceremonies. Last year, even without a presidential visit, . the ACC was packed with an overflow crowd. In view of Carter's appearance this year, seating tickets will have to be distributed for the first time since 1969 when the ACC first opened and commencements started to be held there. 
Obviously, some people will be dis­appointed by being excluded from the' ceremony. The University will soon have the unpleasant duty of determining who those people should be, and telling them to stay home and watch the affair, on television. Our hope is that they keep the interests of the graduating seniors as their number one priority and that they do not try to keep everyone happy by giving out tickets to everyone, tickets more properly distributed to the families of graduating seniors. The desire of a family member to see his or her relative graduate from here is more important than the desire of any one faculty spouse, for instance, to see President Carter in person. 
Notre Dame's commencement is a valuable part of the entire University experience. It is a time set aside by faculty, administration and families to honor the graduating · seniors with diplomas. We are proud that President Carter will join in the ceremony by giving the commencement address, but we hope that a proper focus will be placed on the students who worked four years for this honor. And after the sacrifices they have made, we hope that it will not be the families of these students who are left to watch a possible Jimmy Carter Show on television.

Dear Editor: 
The forced retirement of Dr. James P. Danehy is yet another example of the lack of communica­tion that exists between the stu· dents, faculty, and adrr.inistration at Notre Dame. 
I reaiize that the "mandatory rettrement" clause in the Faculty Manual intends only to insure that the Notre Dame faculty be of the highest caliber possible. It is ari. undisputed fact that mental alert­ness and physical dexterity inevi­tably decline with age. However, the point at which the aging process hegins to interfere with competence varies greatly with each individual. Obviously, to be an effective educator, one must be in complete control of his mental facilitic~. He must he competent in his tield.

A Message to Bender 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim i k e richte r 
Basketball is a good game. 
Chess is another good game. Our 
conception of "good" games are 
games that pit one player, or one 
team of playrs against another. 
There's a move and a counter· 
move, and action and a re-action. 
That's how any good game is 
played. Both sides have a stake in 
the action and the object is to win. 
Elections and political processes 
are like games, but the political 
processes shouldn't involve the 
secrecy and surprises that come 
when people work against each 
other. The political· process, es­
pecially at the University level 
should be a different kind of game 
where the players work together 
towards a common good. The 
presidential election is, over for 
now. For better or worse, Dave 
Bender has won. We have a new 
president and perhaps a new game. 
As the dust clears there will be time for everyone to reflect. This period of reflection, like a lull before the storm should be a time of preparation. It should be used well. In this time before sharp­edged enthusiasm has a chance to wear against the grindstone of day-to-day routine, there will be time to think and plan. This time should be treasured by Dave and Tom and used well because now is the time to clarify and sharpen the visions that brought them into office. 
Last Tuesday The Observer edi­torial editor commented on the election in his ~sua! way, "We've 
I beg to differ. 
Contrary to Mr. Hanifin's same old 
Monday's Observer, the Hardy­
Mclver platform stuck out from the 
rest. 
Many of the platforms were offering better parties, new budget plans, 'lnore social space, and one even offered better apathy. Valerie Hardy had this to say. "Just as student government plans armory parties, it should plan boycotts of products from corporations that exploit workers in America and throughout the world. Just as it conducts studies concerning pa­rietals, it should conduct studies of the corporate responsibilities of the companies in which the Univer~itv invests our nwney. by compiling ;. 
stock ponfolio of the llnivers:ty. Just as it sends student lohhi<'s· to legi-:late ror a lower drinking ag,·. it should send ~tudcnts to lobbl ror rriM>II reform and imprnvl'd it<>Uo.; 
ing, medical care and education for 
everyone." This was and still 
stands as a call to action. 
Valerie Hardy has expressed a point of view rarely seen on university campuses today. Her percentage of the vote in the elections, (7.9) shows that there is a sizable number of students (332 to be exact) who thought enough of her suggestions to vote for her. This reservoir of talent shoutd not, must not be shut down. It appears dear to me that there are enough students (30 if even 10 ·percent of those voters became involved) to make some valuable steps toward doing something politically and socially in that ''great big world out there." At the same time they'd be raising that "abominable" level of consciousness of students here, (which would be quite an achieve­ment in itself). This University is a storehouse of information, know­ledge, and learning. So why don't we take advantage of it? Why don't we use it? 

My message to Dave is this; at Notre Dame, students h.?.·;c. dte resources to start u vigorous organ­ization towards social reform. The CILA-sponsored government­involvement workshop given by NETWORK two weeks ago was a resounding success. Valerie Hardy got 332 votes. There are people here who are willing -to work towards social reform. Notre-Dame is a big-name university. What we do here, if publicized correctly, could cause a splash on the national scene. 
The nay-sayers say we can't change the world. O.K., fine, but knowing that we can't change the world shouldn't stop us from seeing how .much we can change. 
We have an opportunity here. We have the information we need, or we can get it. The people wilting to work, (quite and important resource), we have. The spark plug. the main volunteer, (Valerie Hardy volunteered by running on her platform and again when asked permission to volunteer her.), we have, What we don't have is a structure within which we can work to organize our show and get it out on the road. I hope that Dave Bender and Tom Soma will use this beginning time of excite­ment to its fullest ·before it wears down. I hoP': that they will know how to u-;c the volunteers to their fullest. We nt"ed a structure in student go···'''llliCilt which will tap the n-sou" ..., we have here. Dave lkndcr. ·, ··-:-·lllr rnnn.

Letters from Abroad by DAVE GILL 
Mexico: We Made AMovie 
First, there was living in a totally new and foreign environment. Then came the dedication of a basilica to the Virgin of Guadalupe. Now, the latest "fad" among Notre Dame and St. Mary's students in Mexico City is working as extras in the Universal Pictures production of the televi­sion-movie "The Rhinenamm Exchange." 
The opportunity arose when the adjunct director of the group, Joe Corpora, rented a room from an American woman by the name of Ruth Jason, who moved to Mexico almost 19 years ago. After doing some of her own "acting," Mrs. Jason began to recruit extras for Mexican and American movie companies when they needed them. The business grew and now Ruth has over 900 names and descriptions in her files, including those of 19 students in the Notre Dame's Mexico City, Foreign Studies Program. 
When Universal Picturescameto Mexico to make "The Rhinemann Exchange" because of financial reasons, they looked up Mrs. Jason for the sole purpose of finding over 1,200 people. The movie is a World War II picture, involving numerous 
people  that  need  German  and  other  
anglo-saxons appearances.  
This is where the  Notre Dame  group  

came in. "I wanted a part in their year in Mexico to take part in the making · of 
a movie." remarked Mrs. Jason. So, nine stude.nts and their adjunct director ,ljeadily agreed to become part of television history and launch their professional acting 
careers. Among their parts, Claudia 
Sandroni played by a nanny with her 
charges in what was supposedly Central 
Park Zoo, but in reality was the Mexico 
City Zoo. Cathy Piha was a passerby in the 
same scene. Paul Grzybowski, Bruch 
Blanco, and Dave Gill were sailors on 
leave, acting in the same shot. 
Piha related, "It wasn't boring like some of the others thought. I really enjoyed talking to the other extras in the scene, whether in English or Spanish. It was a lot of fun." 
Karl Blette, Kristin Darden, and Monica \ ostello held different opinions. "It wasn't as glamorous as you might expect," explained Darden, "becuase there wasa lot of standing around and not doing anything for an hour or two. And when they shoot a scene 20 times, it tends to get a little tiring. It was an interesting experience, though, because I had never done anything like that before." 
"It was fun.to see what a movie was like in the production states, but I'd hate to be an actor, even if I was paid as much as a star, because there are times when you just stand around," stated· Blette. 
Bruch Blanco throughly enjoyed himself. "It was my first time in a movie and that in itself is an experience. Plus, we got to meet and talk to the stars just like regular people. It's different than anything I've ever done before. One thing for sure, it made me look at extras from a different point of view.'! 
"The experience of a lifetime, at times a kind of drawn out, at others, but I enjoyed it. I'd sure do it again," described Don Dilenschneider who played a pedestrian in his particular scene. 
The television movie, which is being produced for Universal by Robert collins.

TWiliGHT'S lAST GlEAMING: Generation Gap· 
Directed by Robert Aldrich Starring Burt Lancaster, Charles Durning, Richard Widmark 
Somewhat imaginative, and somewhat conceited, Twilight's Last Gleaming offers the unlikely notion that disclosure of the intentional protraction of the Indochinese war by Washington could inspire a president's assassination, and the all too likely prospect of Burt Lancaster as a cold-hearted hero. It is a menagerie of carefully-disguised movie cliches wedged into a rather unique story, a disorganized blend of the paranoia of the SO's and the 
CIA-FBI-Imperial  Presidency  thing  cur­ 
rently plaguing Americans.  ~  
Lawrence  Dell  (Burt  Lancaster)  is  a  

former Air Force general whose political leanings an.d persistence made him a thorn in the Pentagon's side, so they railroaded him on a murder charge and got him 30 years to life. 
Recently paroled, accompanied by two escaped cons named Augie (B!lrt Young) and Willie (Paul Winfield), seething with revenge and obsessed wnh ''the trm.. about Vietnam," Dell siezes a missile silo at an ICBM base in Montana. The price for not launching nine Titan missiles armed with nuclear warheads? Ten million dollars (for the mercenary accomplices, of course), transportation by Air Force l to "a country 'of our choice,'' and the President as a hostage, who will, upon his release, disclose the contents of NSC Document 9759 to the American people. 
There is a considerable amount of excitement and intrigue ·in high places as a result of these demands, as one might well expect. The film fails not at all in depicting the anguishing decisions that mul>t be made, or in revealing startlingly real characters. The best performances by far are turned in by grizzled Hollywood veterans playing a variety of Cabinet types with different political and moral leanings: Melvyn Douglas, Joseph Cotton, and Leif Erickson. But the most convincing and dynamic interpretation is Charles Durning's portrayal of President David Stephens, a man who must cope with an

who also wrote the screen adaptation, will premiere on March 10 and run for five successive Thursdays on NBC's "Bestsellers" series. 
The movie is based on Robert Ludlum's book by the same title, which spent nine seeks on the New York Times bestseller list. The plot involves an exchange between Germany and the United States during World War II for offensive secrets that both sides need desperately to continue the war and, hopefully, lead to victory. The book is well-writen with plenty of excitement and intrigue for espionage lovers. Ludlum keeps the reader guessing as he switches locales from Germany to New York City to Spain to Washington and finally to Buenos Aires where the exchange is to be made through an exiled German Jew who does not harb-or hate feelings toward his fatherland, but only a lust for power and money which this treasonous exchange will bring him. 
The Chicago Tribune explains best, ''A supurb plot filled with exciting chases, double drosses, secret codes, and beautiful women...a picture of the beastliness underlying the espionage world, a world of brillance without scruples, brutality with­out restraint...Robert Ludlum passes the highest test of fiction with flying colors!'' 
In the television production, Steve Collins has the starring role_. He has played in other spot performances in T.V. and the theatre, but will be best known for his role as Hugh Sloan, the resigned treasurer, in "All the President's Men." Lauren Hutton, the Revlon model, is the leading lady. Collins and Hutton have an excellent supporting cast, including Henry Fonda, John Huston, Claude Aikens from NBC's "Movin' On," Werner Klemperer, who played Colonel Klink on "Hogan'~s heroes," Larry hagman, known from "I dream of Jeannie," and nine students and one adjunct director from the well-known grounds of Notre Dame du Lac. 
impending nuclear catastrophe, a shocking disclosure, the intricacies of the military and intelligence communitie.s, and the immense personal pressures and emotions that are not characteristically thought of as "Presidential.'' Durning makes the fears and confusions and doubts potent and vivid, yet unobtrusive. 
Where the film does fail is in its ignorant ap13raisal of the impact of the disclosure. That the war was intentionally dragged on to demonstrate an invincible American will to· the Russians, to prevent total war through limited war, is no great blow to a calloused American conscience that would just as soon forget. The more the film insists otherwise, the more ii cripples itself. 
Director Aldrich does an adequate job of handling a taut, literate screenplay. but his split-screen mania is an unforgivable distraction. On the other hand, Lancaster can be forgiven for his confused handling of a poorly-drawn character. We never really know who Lawrence Dell is, or precisely why he is doing these nasty things. Lan{!aster's Dell is a sinister synthesis of Mister Rogers and Mister Spock, a cold. articulate technician capable of gentle aphorisms and indignant dia­

tribes. In that sense, he typifies the film. 
Record Reviews by TED TWARDZIK 
BIG BEAT 
(The album you -probably

neuer heard of, by The Sparks.) 
Don't feel too ignorant if you've never 
heard of Sparks. Few Americans have. 
The band was founded in 1969 by two 
brothers from Los Angeles and recorded 
two albums for Bearsville, the first 
produced by Todd Rundgren. These were 
spectacularly unsuccessful, so the brothers 
moved to England, enlisted a new British 
band and became major stars in England, 
Europe, and Scandinavia. Their formula 
was to perform highly mature songs in a 
teenybopper style which didn't catch on in 
disco-happy America. In order to dent the 
huge profits possible in America, their 
latest album. Big Beat, abandons this 
approach in favor of a heavier sound. This 
shift was assisted by recording the album 
in America with a completely American 
band. 
Big Beat is a loud, energetic, profession­
al record with raucous guitar and promi­.nent drumming in best Led Zeppelin fashion. The tunes are typically commer­cial and memorable. And the lyrics are typically off-beat and clever, being primar­ily about human relationships in which the 
singer is the proverbi~l born loset:. 
The one major drawback to th is album is 
the distinctive lead singing of Russel Mae!, 
whose high, almost feminine voice made 
Sparks the darlings of twelve year old girls 
all over Europe, but does not hold up will in 
this new context. 
This disadvantage is particularly evident 
on the first track, "Big Boy". It's 
apparently Sparks' conception of what will 
sell in the U.S., since it's the heaviest of all 
the cuts, and was selected as a single. The 
lyrics, about a golden boy who continually 
thwarts the singer's plans, are also sadly 
heavy-handed and ocmbine with the incon­
gruous vocals to produce a poor represen­
tation of the total album. Only one other 
song suffers from similar lyrical dullness; 
the remainder are exceptional. 
Some of the topics considered are a 
solution for aging mates ("Throw Her 
Away and Get a New One"), involuntary 
non-conformity ("I Want to Be Like 
Everybody Else"), sexual preferences ("I 
Like Girls"), and racial preferences 
("White Women"). Throughout, the 
words are among the most indelligent, and 
the melodies among the most accessible in 
all rock. The bubblegum overtones will 
unfortunately scare off many "mature" 
listeners who are missing a sophisticated 
and entertaining record. 
Logan Center: Helping the Less-Fortunate 
by SCOTT APPLEBY 
At graduations, presidential dinners and the like, one of Fr. Hesburgh's favorite topics is the substantial involvement of Notre Dame students in various· South Bend public service projects. He speaks of the overwhelming commitment of the student body, citing the fact that over half of the undergraduate population is parti­cipating in volunteer work in the com­munitv. 
Of the various schools. hospitals; a-nd day-care centers which attract altruistic Domers, Loga11 School for the Retarded is perhaps the most well-known. A member of the South Bend Community School System, Logan School alone boasts of volunteer staff of two hundred, 'most of -which come from Notre Dame and St. Mary's. Students assist in activities ranging from classroom tutoring to athletic ·supervision. During the course of a weekday. these student aiiles· teach the 
are employed. They apply skills learned at the School which simultaneously relieves the industry of "busy work" (placing nuts and bolts in a package .for mailing is a prime function of the employees) and provides a practical and gratifying outlet for the retarded struggling for a sense of self-esteem. 
The Logan School system is divided is divided into two age groupings: the "youngster's school" (ages 4-18) which incLudes children living in the city as well as in Northern Indiana State Hospital, and the older group (18 and above). many of which are regulars at Logan Industries. Care for those· residing in the hospital-­many of whom are older men and women, severely or pr,ofoundly retarded--is far from economical: whereas the state of Indiana doles out approximately $10,000 annually to keep a prison convict in maximum security confines, private and public funds applied to Logan Center must O\'ercome increasingly exorbitant prices: to provide medical care for each indi\'idual and childlike cognitive development; and, finally, the moderately afflicted, those slow learners with either limited attention span or hindersome physical deticiencies. 
Confronted with a challenging task in the face of these difficulties. the Notre Dame-St. Mary's' volunteer often finds their experience at Logan School to be trying, rewarding, and. most importantly, significantly maturing. Junior Ed May stresses the importance of individual attention and the considerable patience that goes with it: "I've been working mostly as a teaching assistant in a class of eight. Even with a low student-teacher ratio. it's difficult to give the children the proper attention they deserve. While one child might be able to solve a ·puzzle after three examples, it might take anothei child fifty repetitions before he can make sense · of the exercise." 
Essential to this type of close supervision is one's, ability to maintain a proper perspective on the situation. to ret1ect an attitude of concern without betraying participate as if you were one of the gang, because, ideally, you are." 
Certainly, volunteer work at Logan Center is not for everybody. Many of the "adults" are simply overgrown children in appearance, and many are pathetically deformed_ and handicapped. (Although some handicaps are not immediately apparent. For example, one junior varsity basketball coach pleaded, fumed, and cajoled with one young boy to practice his simple backboard shot from the right side of the hoop; after three weeks of exasper­. atingly futile efforts, the boy's mother informed the coach that her son was blind in his right eye, explaining his poor performance with the shot.) 
Along with these obvious difticultie~ comes the !.Ubtler and more haunting problem--is the child actually learning. progressing. benetitting in the least fron. the exercises and activities? More ofter.

Cheerleading guidelines established 
by Maureen Sajbel Staff Reporter 
l,be proposed tryout regulations for the 1977-78 Notre Dame cheer-leading squad have been released and are available for prospective cheerleaders in the LaFortune Student Activities Office. 
The proposals define the try-out process,requirements, restrictions and quotas. They were written in order to clearly explain the pro­cedures to students from both St. Mary's and Notre Dame who wish to try out for cheerleading for the 1977-78 academic year. 
The regulations at this time are tentative, but will be finalized on Friday unless there are strong objections to the stated policies. The proposed regulations were written by Hank Carrico and Becky Bracken, co-captains for the 1976-77 year, and John Reid, assistant director of Student Activ­ities.

After meeting with the alleged offender and the two St. Mary's students, Riehle suspended the student for the remainder of the semester. The student acknow­ledged his guilt in the case but appealed the penalty to the Board. The board decided that although the student's actions were "highly undesirable" they were not "intentionally or overtly lewd or indecent." Overriding the sus­pension penalty, the board decided on certain "sanctions" to serve as punishment instead. The "sanctions" translated into several conditions which the student would have to obey.
