Brownson Hall serves as home to many since 1855 
Home to nuns. graduate students, first year of students and printing presses during the last 150 years, First Year of Studies and Brownson Hall will be undergoing major changes in the next year as organizations housed in thnsc two buildings are moved to the new Coleman-Morse Center on South Quad. All Virst Year of Studies offices, the Learning Hesource Center, the First Year Writing Center and Academic Services !"or Student Athletes will be moved to the Coleman-Morse Center during the spring, said Joseph Schellinger, director of academic space management. Previously the old Hammes Notre Dame bookstore, the Coleman-Morse Center has been under renovation for the past two years. Some offices located in Brownson will not move immediately. Offices of organizations currently housed in Brownson Hall, the Center for Sport. Character and Culture, the London Stage Program, the Office· of Information Technologies, Pre-College Programs, Psychology Research Labs and Upward Bound. will expand for the time being. Other open space in the building may be used as temporary space for organizations whose offices are being renovated. No decision has been made about the long-term future of the three­building complex including Brownson Hall, the First Year of Studies building and the Earth Science Building in the long term. "There has been no decision on whether the buildings will be reno­vated or torn down," said Schellinger. "There are definite plans for the buildings until 2003, but if the officers of the University want some­thing different before that. we will do that." Campus Ministry will also have a new office in the Coleman-Morse Center. The offices of the Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE), which shares Campus Ministry's current office in Badin Hall. will grow to include Campus Ministry's space after the move is completed. 
A long history behind the Dome 

In 1855, under the direction of Father Sorin. Brother Francis Patois designed the complex of buildings and work began on two buildings behind the Main Building the same year. One was a convent for the Sisters of Holy Cross (now the Earth Science building and First Year of Studies building) and another was the Ave Maria Press (now Brownson Hall). 
The sisters, living in a convent that is now the First Year of Studies and worshipping in a chapel that is now the Earth Sciences building, prepared food for all students in a kitchen facility behind the main building from 1849 until South Dining Hall opened in 1927. 
In addition to cooking, they aided sick students, tended to gardens, set type at the press facility next door and did laundry. 
The convent closed in 1965 after the remaining sisters, who were graduate students, moved to Lewis Hall. which was home to both lay graduate students and nuns. 
Ave Maria Press printed The Scholastic and Ave Maria, along with other publications. in the building that is now Brownson Hall from 1855 until 1940. when it moved to its current location on Douglas Road. In 1941, the Hall was renovated so that it could be used for food storage.

Bush lead slips in Florida recount 
Associated Press 

George W. Bush's lead over Al Gore in all-or-nothing Florida slipped beneath 300 votes in a suspense-filled recount Thursday, as Democrats threw the presiden­tial election to the c-ourts claiming "an injustice unparal­leled in our history." The I3ush campaign was considering recounts in two other close­voting states.. 
Chaos reigned. ll may take weeks to untangle the thicken­ing legal and political webs and determine the nation's 43rd president. 
"The presidential election is ... on hold," said James Baker 
111, the secretary of state in the Bush administration brought in to protect the Texas gover­nor's interests. 
Gore wants a follow-up recount in four Florida coun­ties and perhaps a new elec­tion in the Palm Beach area ­ideas the Bush camp said amounted to "politicizing and distorting" the electoral sys­tem. 

Amid a campaign-style 11urry of charges and countcr­charges, Gore campaign chair­man· William Daley said his party will support legal actions by voters and supporters who say a confusing ballot may have led tht1m to vote acciden­tally for Beform Party candi­date P.at Buchanan. 
"We're raising some very 

.serious questions and legal actions will be taken," Daley said at a Florida session with Warren Christopher, the for­mer secretary of state acting as Gore's recount consigliere. 
The Bush campaign fired back by staking its own claim to a Florida victory and ques­tioning Gore's motives. Still, Republicans eyed recounts elsewhcre~in case Gore pre­vails in Florida. raising the specter of a lengthy, multistatc battle.

Juice and a bagel 
For 15 years, my family had a rilual. 
Every Friday night, my mother would stand 

over a pot of spaghetti, check the bread in the 
oven, and make sure my favorite Lemon Ice 
Gatorade was in the refrigerator. As a swim­
mer, my weekend races 
usually dictated the family's 
schedule -and our menu. 
My carbohydrate and high­
fluid pre-race diet wasn't 
Lhc typical family meal, but 
in my house, it was the 
unbreakable norm. 
My mom's preparations didn't end there; she would set her alarm to wake me up at the crack of dawn on Saturday morning, make sure a bagel and juic!\ were on the table, and warm the car for whatrver location wu wcrp voyaging to that wc1~kend. With coffee bal­ancing dangerously on the dashboard of our Buick station wagon, she would never show signs of' fatigue as she drove nw to a pool in some foreign corner of Lhe state for my compe­tition. 
And d(\Spite the facl that after a night of cooking, a morning of driving, and long hours sitting in the humid bleachers of a strange natatoriurn. when I stood up on the blocks, she'd always be cheering the loudest. At the time, I'd usually pretend not to notice, but I knew for sure that each time I raced, there would be at least two people cheering for me ­my coach and my mom. 
This weekend, the roles will switch for my mother and me. In 1974, my mother began the lirst swim team at Saint Mary's College, and will return to campus today for the College's first alumnae athletic reunion. On Sunday morning, my mother will join with her fellow alumnae from '74 and beyond to return to the pool as they take on the current Saint Mary's swim team at Rolfs Aquatic Center. 
And like she has done so many times for me, I'll make sure she eats her pasta dinner on Saturday night after the game, I'll wake her up on Sunday morning and I'll make sure I hand­deliver juice and a bagel to her before her race. And you'd better believe that I'll sit with my stepfather in the stands, yelling and screaming as loud as I can. 
I know that my mother was excited when I took Saint Mary's acceptance and came to her alma mater. I know that she was even more excited when Ijoined the Saint Mary's swim team as a freshman. But I know that she was devastated when I quit. One year ago I left my swimming career for good to pursue my other love: journalism. She'll never say it, but I know my mom misses cooking spaghetti for me and driving hours at the crack of dawn to see me compete. l know it broke her heart for me to quit the team that years before she had start­ed. But she never said a negative word to me about my decision. 
Like a good mother, she recognized that I had to go my own way. 
If l have one regret about my own swimming career, it is that I never thanked my mother for being my No. 1 fan. I hope my cheers from the stands this weekend can speak for all the words I never said. If they can't, I hope that being her No. 1 fan -if only for the weekend -can be enough. 
Cood luck, Mom.

Marijuana crop offers harvesters free high

Marking the beginning of harvest time for Hoosier mari­juana, state authorities and individual entrepreneurs were racing to reap the illicit weed. The high price of marijuana on campus is one reason given for harvesting local patches of pot. "I would say at least half' of the students here who smoke try to grow their own," an anonymous student said. "But most the good stufT comes from Ann Arbor, Mich."

Cavanaugh men face dorm change 
Nov. 19, 1993 
Cavanaugh residents were informed that their dorm would be converted to a female residence effective in the Fall of 1994. Although many diffornnt factors were taken into account, the final decision to convert Cavanaugh came down to beds, said Patricia O'llara, vice-president for stu­dent affairs. The dorm was chosen because it has the 242 beds which would be needed for incoming fomales.

Networks predict Gore's future as Harvard pres 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

There's more than one presidency at stake hl're. As Vice President Al Gore waited for the recount Wednesday, pundits were alroady speculating that he could be in the running for the nation's second most highly contested presidency ­IIarvard's, 
Tuesday night, as nrtworks goofed, rhetoric shifted and fickle Florida fluctuated, NIJC news anchor Tom Brokaw tossed ofT a comment about Gore's future to millions of viewers, noting that Gore might be a fit for Harvard's presidential spot. On CBS, a guest of Dan Rather's did the same, as anxious voters awaited the verdict. 
As early as Monday, Slate's Timothy Noah began the gossip by devoting his "Chatterbox" column to Gore and the llarvard presidency. 

Noah said a list of possible presi­dential candidates published in The New York Times inspired him to sug­gest Gore to replace outgoing univer­sity President Neil Hudenstine. 
"I was struck by the implausibility of Clinton because of' the Lewinsky scandal and the more prosaic fact that he had no previous connection to Harvard," Noah says in an inter-
CORNELL UNIVERSITY 

Asian students complain of abuse 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 
After four anti-Asian assaults on campus this fall, Cornell University is considering far-reaching curriculum reforms to combat hate. In mid-September, an Asian female student was sexually assaulted on campus. In the same week, another Asian student and four Asian alum­nae were verbally harassed. Then, two weekends ago, an Asian male student was assaulted with racial slurs. This week, Cornell University president Hunter Rawlings issued a statement urging students to take greater safety precautions and endorsed a series of proposals designed to increase campus security. The proposals, which were first outlined in an administration report released Sunday, include increased security on campus and the possible addition of a diversity requirement to the cur­riculum. In his statement, Rawlings wrote, "Crime and bias are realities in society and on our campus that we must confront." But many students said they were not satisfied by the anti-bias actions taken by the university both before and after the assaults.

view, referring to flying rumors that President Clinton would be consid­orc~d. 
But Noah says the vice president is a much more realistic prospect than his boss is. Gore is a former member of the Board or Overseers, the uni­versity's second-highest governing board. 
"lie has a great affinity for the academic life," Noah says. "It is entirely speculation on my part. it's probably unlikely, but it's at least as worth discussing as any or the other names I've seen mentioned." 
But longtime search and university officials dismiss Gore's chances as slim. if existent. 
Former Overseer Joan llutchins says the next university president must have a true understanding of higher education issues.

Men to end violence a~ainst women 
ANN AHBOH, Mich. 
University student Gary Brouhard said he got involved in the White Ribbon Campaign after hearing too many stories about his female friends being abused by men. The cam­paign, an international program run by men to end male violence against women, is celebrating its first anniversary at the university this December. "l want to be proud to be a man," Brouhard said. "But as long as so many men com­mit acts of violence against women, that's impossible. I want masculinity to mean peacefulness and cooperation, not aggression and violence." The focus of the events is the White Ribbon Drive to distribute ribbons from Nov. 29 to Dec. 5. Jack Gagliordi, national outreach coordinator, said he believes the biggest problem in combating violence against women committed by men is a lack of education for men about the seriousness of their actions. "We battle everything from sexist jokes against women all the way up to murder," Gagliordi said. The campaign began in Montreal in 1989 following the Dec. 6 massacre of 14 women at the University of Montreal by a lone gunman.

THAILAND 


Associated Press 
BANGKOK 

Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai dissolved parlia­ment and called general elections Thursday, prepar­ing for an uphill battle against a billionaire oppo­nent and an electorate unhappy with his economic policies. 
The election date was set for Jan. 6, Cabinet Secretary Visanu Kreau­ngam said. 
At least 57 parties are expected to take part in the elections, which will be con­ducted by a newly empow­ered Election Commission. It was allowed last month to 
UGANDA 

enforce stringent laws against cheating, exceeding campaign fund limits and vote-buying. 
Chuan's Democrat Party is facing serious criticism over his finance minister's policies. Critics say the min­ister botched a program to resolve problems stemming from the 1997 economic crisis that devastated Thailand's financial struc­ture. 
On Thursday, Chuan suf­fered a blow when deputy Finance Minister Pisit Leeahtam said he would not run in the elections and would resign from the Democrat Party's economic team. Commerce Minister Supachai Panichpakdi also said he would step down as the leader of the party's economic team. 
Chuan's main opponent, opposition leader Thaksin Shinawatra, has capitalized on anger over the slow pace of reforms to win support among the poor and the business community. 
His populist promises include debt write-offs for farmers, businesses and banks. He wants to set up a national asset management body to take over billions of dollars of bad loans that banks have been saddled with since the economic cri­sis. 
Until recently, Thaksin, a billionaire telecommunica­tions tycoon who heads the Thai Rak Thai, or Thai Patriots' Party, was seen as a shoo-in to take power. 
However, in recent weeks he has been tainted by a state anti-corruption panel investigation into allega­tions of unusual share transfers to his domestic servants to hide his assets. If found guilty, he will be barred from politics for five years. 
The dissolved House of Representatives was elected in November 1996 under the government of Prime Minister Chav ali t Yongchaiyudh of the New Aspiration Party. 

Ebola outbreak toll rises to 100 
Associated Press 
KAMPALA 

Ugandan health officials say an out­break of Ebola that has already killed 100 people is contained to two areas, but the death toll will increase as infected people die. Four people died of the virus in a 24-hour period. 
Authorities had hoped to keep the disease in Gulu, an area 225 miles north of the i:apital of Kampala where the outbreak was first reported in mid-October. But last week, experts confirmed that a Ugandan soldier who had visited Gulu died of the disease in Mbarara, a town in the south. 
On Thursday, Alex Opio, the assis· tant commissioner for national disease control, announced that two men died of Ebola in Mbarara, 17 5 miles south­west of Kampala. Two other deaths were reported in Gulu, he said. 
Since the death of the soldier in Mbarara on Nov. 2, three people who came into contact with him have died of the disease. Two of them were also soldiers and the third did community service at Mbarara hospital. There are no other reported cases of the virus in Mbarara. 
Nine new cases have been identified in Gulu during the last day, bringing the total number of Ebola cases in Uganda to 297, Opio said. 
Ebola, which is spread by bodily contact, can cause seYcre hemorrhag­ic fever and is often fatal. Early symp­toms are similar to the flu. No one knows where the virus exists between outbreaks or how the first person in an outbreak contracts it.

Private school graduate students granted right to unionize 
By LAURA SEGURA 
News Writer 
Beginning this month, the National Labor Relations Board granted graduate studenls of pri­vate universities the right to form unions to negotiate terms of their employment as researchers and teaching assistants. 
Graduatf' students havf' arguf'd for years over the wages, benefits and conditions of their employ­ment at the schools they also attend as students. 
"I don't expect this to set olT a firestorm of organizing at all the top universities. but it is likely to have an effect at some," said Thomas Kochan of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
Much of the protesting has 
taken place at state and other large institutions where many graduate students argue their voices are not heard. Notre Dame does not expect to face labor dif­ficulties with its grad students, according to Peter Diffiey, associ­ate dead in the graduate studies office. 
"Because of the size of our school, we are able to deal with graduate student issues on an 
~ndividual 


basis without arbitration," 
Diffiey said. N o t r e 

By ANDREW THAGARD News Writer 
While most of the country's attention was turned toward the presidential elec­tion on Tuesday the Graduate Student Union considered a resolution support­ing The Observer's independence. 
Eleven representatives voted in sup­port of the resolution, six against it, and two abstained. However Mark Buckles and Alexander Samuel, GSU president and vice president respectively, could not decide whether the organization's consti­tution required a simple majority or approval from 2/3 of the members pre­sent in order to pass. Buckles and Samuel held off announcing the final decision until GSU secretary Joe Blacketor could be contacted. 
William Bolan, the organization's the­ology representative, introduced the res­olution. through which GSU would endorse The Observer's independence. 
"I read about the issue in The Observer and I thought it was something that the GSU should con~ider," Bolan said. 
"The fact that the faculty senate took up the issue was the main [reasonl for us to take up this issue as well," Bolan said when asked why he brought up the reso­lution. 
The proposal, similar in nature to one approved by the Faculty senate, stated that "The Observer's history of responsi­
. ble journalism does not justify any change in its status ... The editorial board of The Observer should maintain control over the paper's advertising and editorial content." It also concluded that "disputes ... against the editorial board Dame's graduate programs have not had to deal with the uproar heard on larger school's campus­es, in part because of the efforts of the Graduate Student Union already on campus. 
Arguments against unioniza­tion center on the graduate stu­dents' status as students. Teaching and research positions are meant to further students' postgraduate education, not enti­tling them to equal pay and ben­efits of a university employee, according to arguments against grad student unions. -Pro-union arguments state that some graduate students teach as much as 40 percent of essential teaching, making them justifiable employees of the univP-rsity. Without comparable wages and working conditions, many stu­d ents must find outside jobs depleting their study and research time. 

Other national universities have had to seek legal interven­tion, as most recently seen at New York University. 
Currently, there are only 12 recognized unions for graduate students employed by their uni­versities, all at state schools. 
GSU considers Observer support, delays decision

of The Observer should ordinarily be resolved by good faith negotiations between the editorial board of The Observer and the offended party." 
Questions concerning the indpendence of The Observer arose after University President Father Edward Malloy created an ad hoc committee to examine the relationship between the University and the newspaper. Malloy created the com­mittee after The Observer editorial board rejected advertising restrictions placed on unrecognized gay and lesbian groups. 
Mike Connolly, The Observer's Editor in Chief, was present at the meeting to answer any questions representatives might have. The resolution, however, was not addressed until the end of the meeting, limiting the time members had to discuss the proposal. 
Many members expressed concerns about the GSU supporting The Observer's independence. 
'Tm in favor, in a large degree, of independence [for The Observer] but I'm uncomfortable with you not having any formal standards lin advertising]" said Keith Hubbard, the board's math repre­sentative. 
After the meeting, Buckles and Samuel reviewed the organization's constitution to determine if the resolution had passed but they were unable to reach a consen­sus. 
The decision was deferred until Thursday morning when secreta-ry Blacketor had an opportunity to review the constitution. The GSU concluded that a second vote is required before the res­olution can be adopted. 
"The discussion [on the resolution] will continue at the next council meeting on Dec. 5," Blacketor said.

Week to highlight hunger, homeless with campus events 
By KYLIE CARTER 
News Wri,cr 
Several Notre Dame student groups have self-organized a series of live events next week for the National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Weck -Nov. 12-17 -specifi­cally !'or the National Student Campaign against !lunger and llomclcssncss. 
The week will start off Sunday with Dillon Hall's Race for llungcr. This annual event was rescheduled to coincide with the Awareness Week. The race will begin at 2 p.m. 
On Tuesday, students will be asked at dinner to scrape food off of their own plates into the approximately 3 ft. by 4 ft. bins where food is normally scraped. Henc Mulligan, an active senior in the Center for Soclal Concerns who helped with of much of this week's organization. said the "Students for Clean Plates will be "a visual demonstration of how much food we. the stu­dents, waste at the dining hall." 

Students on average, 12 of these bins arc filled with wast­ed food each dav in each din­ing hall. · 
"The point is nut to repri­mand or make us feel bad. but to make us aware that just because we have all of this food doesn't mean we can waste whatever we want," Mulligan said. 
The key event of the week will be the Hunger Banquet on Wednesday evening. It will be held on the cast (left) side of South Dining llall and will begin at 7:30 p.m., although students arc asked to arrive ,at 7:15 p.m. Mulligan describes this event as "a fundraising meal with a message." Food services will be donating a portion of the cost of each per­son's meal. The cost will be a $5 donation for non-meal-plan users and will be a regular meal swipe for those with a meal plan. 
"It won't be your typical ban­quet," Mulligan said. "The audience will be able to learn about the causes of poverty and hunger and personal ways that they can take action to equalize things in this world." 
The Hunger Ranquet is based on a model by OxFam America, a non-governmental. non-profit organization that works for grass-roots-based solutions to poverty and hungPr around the globe. At this Hunger Banquet, Mike Brown will be the MC and them will be a guest speaker from East Timor, Ajizo Magno. 
On Thursday. a "Bread for the World" letter-writing SBS­sion will be held in the CSC at 4 p.m. Bread for the World is a Christian Institute that uses political advocacy and action to overcome societal ailments. 
A student can work at a soup kitchP.n and so similar service activities, but Mulligan said, "to really find long-term solu­tions and do more than just place·a band-aid on the prob­lem, you have to change lhings in the system." 
This letter-writing session will be teaching people to write letters using examples Bread t'or the World has given. 
The purpose or these letters will be to push for Congress to increase funding for emer­gency food providers, and to make food stamps available to 
legal immigrants. who arc unable to obtain them undnr current laws. 
The last event of the wnek will be Friday from 3 p.m. to 6 
p.m. at Stepan Center. The World Hunger Coalition will be preparing Thanksgiving food baskets for families in South Bend. 
The money from Wednesday's Lunch Fast pro­gram will be used to purchase food items and students am asked to help in the basket preparation. 
"College students are in a really good position to become aware and start practicing activism that can last our whole lives. We're still idr,alis­tic," Mulligan said. "We don't have to accept that in the rich­est, most powerful nation in the world. :H million people are going hungry." 
Native American speaks at SMC, focuses on women

Discussing the religion, traditions, symbolism and music of a Native American lifestyle, John Warren, the cultural coordinator and vice chair of the Pokagon Band of Potawatami Indians, spoke at Saint Mary's on Wednesday.

In his tribe, nature plays a large role in their religion and daily life. They believe in the spirits of nature and feel that they have spiritual helpers that intervene in times of turmoil and confu­sion. 
Warren gave an example of nature's importance, "You get sick often because you sit up on chairs off the ground and wear rubber-soled shoes, which keep you from contact with the ground. If one

ADierican election deadlock intrigues world reaction 
Associated Press 
LONDON 

Two days after the U.S. presidential vote and with no clear victor, observers around Lhe world marveled Thursday at a rare spectacle American election uncertainty. 
In some quarters of the press, surprise at the dead­locked contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore turned to amusement. 
For its headline, Switzerland's French-lan­guage 24 Heures played on a famous line from the Apollo 13 spa.Ce CflSIS "Washington, we have a prob­lem." 
"Forrest Chumps," read the front-page headline in Britain's tabloid Mirror. above a picture of the two candi­dates in Gump-like poses. "This election's like a box of chocolates," ran the kicker. "You never know what you're 
going to get." 
The cliffhanger vote remained t"ront-page news around the world as a painstaking recount continued in the state of Florida, whose 25 electoral votes could settle the election. 
With nearly all the ballots recounted, Bush led by Jess than 300 votes. Elections offi­cials said the results wouldn't be certified for more than a week. 
For manv, the real lesson of this extraordinary election was its affirmation of the power of the individual. Japan's top economic daily, Nihon Keizai, said the election "made us realize the weight of each vote under the democrat­ic system." 
Around the world, newspa­pers had to backpedal from premature declarations of a Bush victory in their Wednesday editions. 
"Bush celebration interrupt­ed by recount in Florida," said Thursday's edition of Mexico Internet cafe in Cameroon. City's Reforma newspaper. A European newspapers tried day earlier it headlined: "The to he!p their readers get to

"The chaotic situation has made many demand a new election system," the newspa­per wrote under the headline "The loser may become presi­dent." 
Norway's biggest newspa­per, Verdens Gang, agreed. "It is not in keeping with basic democratic principles for the one who gets the second­largest share of votes to win the presidential election," it said. 
Denmark's Aktuelt newspa­per said the fact that nearly half the U.S., electorate did not vote "is, in itself, a huge defeat for democracy." 
But British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook declared the process "an excellent example of democracy in action. That's what we would expect from one of the world's greatest democracies," he said. 
The Jakarta Post newspaper in Indonesia gave a "thumbs up" to the meticulous recount of ballots in Florida. 
"As a fledgling democracy. Indonesia could learn much from ... U.S. election and from the political maturity the 
American people displayed in adhering to their democratic principles," the newspaper said. 
Switzerland's Le Temps called the debacle -which resulted in some world leaders offering Bu~h congratulations, before hastily taking them back -"the most extraordi­nary failure in the history of television." 
"The obligation to announce the news before the news has happened will cost CNN and its sisters dearly,'' the news­paper said. 
Cuban Foreign Minister Pelipe Roque Perez, in New York on Thursdav for a U.N. visit, drew a link between the election's outcome and fre­quent U.S. advice to other nations. 
"I believe that those in the United States who have always tried to become judges of elec­tions that take place else­where must be receiving ales­son of modesty and humble­ness," Perez fioque said. 
He added that Cuba would gladly send monitors for a new election if asked by U.S. officials. 
Stock markets sagged under the uncertainty, with Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finishing down 
2.2 percent Thursday. European shares also ended the day slightly lower follow­ing a 5.4 percent sell-off on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. 
Andy Penman, an analyst at Greig Middleton, said markets would remain unsteady until the election's outcome was certain. 
"The danger is that it could go through the courts as part of a legal process, and the markets do not want to see that happening," he said.

High student turnout at U. Florida attributed to tight race

More than 50 percent of regis­tered .voters turned out in four voting precincts dominated by University of Florida students ­a result of what experts say is largely because of a competitive party system and a spine-tingling tight race. 
The election -which still has no clear winner -has come down to the line. with the results from florida determining the winner. Turnout at the American Cancer Society Winn-Dixie Lodgewas reported at 53.52 per­cent by the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections OtTice on Tuesday night. First Baptist Church, reported 53.35 percent, compared with 54.34 percent at the Beitz Union and 60.05 per­turnout was reported at 71.15 percent Tuesday night. The stu­dent turnout was considerably lower than the county turnout, but most officials said the turnout was good for students.

"The governor is the most visible leader of Texas state govern­ment," said State Sen. Je!TWentworth. R-San Antonio. "Arguably. the one that holds the most power in state government is the lieutenant governor, but very few know who [he is] or what he does." 
Senate members who have expressed interest in taking this posi­tion include Wentworth; David Silbey, R-Waco; Bill Ratliff, R-Mt. Pleasant; J.E. "Buster" Brown, R-Lake Jackson; and Teel Bivins, R­Amarillo. 
Before beginning his term as lieutenant governor, Perry. 50, served as a commissioner of agriculture from 1991 to 1998. Perry, who waduated from Texas A&M University with a bachelor's degree in animal science, was elected lieutenant governor in 1998. 
Perry also served as a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1985 to 1990, and worked on the Appropriations and Calendars committees. 
Kathy Walt, spokeswoman for Perry, said he is prepared to take over as governor and will continue to focus on Texas, regardless of which job he has in January. 
"lie is focused on where he is today and doing the best job for 
Texas," Walt said. "I le is ready to work for Texas in a variety o areas from the lieutenant gover­nor's ()ffice or the governor's office." 
Wentworth, who met Perry 20 years ago at a young leaders' council in Washington D.C., saidl Perry has served well as lieu­tenant governor. 
"I le maintained electing mem­bers or both [political! parties to chair over committees (in the Senatlil," Wentworth said. "I cxp,1ct him to continue the biparti­san spirit he has adopted if appointed to Governor." 
State !lep. Glen Maxcy. D­Austin, said if Perry becomes gov­ernor. Texans should expect the same leadership from Perry as thP-y received from Bush. 
"It's a status quo situation; he's no new kid on the block." said Maxey. who was a member of the House with Perry. 'Tie's a steady manager, but don't expect dynam­
ic. bold leadership out of Perry." 
Maxey criticized Perry !or "slop-1 py" political work. adding that Perry should stay focused on state. issues before planning his 2002: campaign for governor. i 
"As long as he realizes he needs/ to pay attention to Texas firsl. he'll be better off." Maxey said.

UF political science professor Michael Martinez said the visits probably encouraged a few more students to get involved or vote. 
"I think some students were energized by the events in the last few days of the campaign," said Martinez, who recently has published articles on voter turnout. 
'There were several events on campus and in town,'' he said. "Jesse Jackson's visit and George P.'s visit might have mobilized some students."

"I didn't want the country to go to hell in a hand basket without at least putting my say into things," he said.

White House celebrates 200 years with forlllal dinner 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

As the nation awaited word on its next chief executive, three for­mer presidents joined President Clinton at the White House on Thursday night to celcb1:ate the mansion's two centuries as a symbol of leadership arnl conti­nuitv. 
"1.lillary and I arc grateful beyond words to have served as temporary· stewards of the peo­ple's house these last eight years -an honor excccrlcd only by the privilege of service that comes with the key to the [ront door," Clinton said in exchanging toasts with the former presidents in the East Hoom. 
"In ways both large and small, each and every one of you has cast your light upon this house and left it and your country brighter for it" 
The formal dinner honored the building's history and the 40 presidents who have.lived there, but much of the attenliun was focused on three of its recent occupants;

The East Room had a head table for the Clintons and former presidential couples and round tables for the rest of the 190 guests. . 
The dinner menu, the selection of deserts and the 'v\ine list were an attempt to match the tastes enjoyed by White House guests in the age of John Adams and his successor, Thomas Jefferson, the first two presidents to live in the White House. 
Chef Walter Scheib prepared a menu vvith an emphasis on the kind of seasonal and local ingre­dients that likely were available along the Potomac River two c·enturies ago: seared striped bass, corn and crab fricassee·, and smoked loin of lambs with a sauce that included "heirloom apples" planted in York, Pa., in the 19th century.

The President's Ilouse, as it was to be called for decades. was chilly, damp and uncomfortable. 
"Our nation was new, carving out the symbols that would define it," Clinton said last week in a South Lawn ceremony cele­brating Adams' arrival. 
"Two hundred years later, these walls carry the story of America."

WASHINGTON 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat slammed Israel on the White House doorstep Thu0rsday after a two-hour meeting with President Clinton on the violence that has shat­

After shaking hands with Clinton and saluti.ng him as 
he left, Arafat told reporters

The White House gave no indication that any g round

w a s :g a i ri e d toward a firm truce or the m o r e remote goal of 
reopening negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis. 
In fact, administration officials abandoned the phrase "peace process" and replaced it with "political process." 
A White House spokesman, P.J. Crowley, would ~ot say whether Clinton asked Arafat for a public demand that Palestinian protesters stop their rock-throwing campaign against Israelis. 
But, Crowley said, "Clear statements by both leaders can only help." ·:we continue to be frustrated," Crowley told reRorters. " 
Arafat was defiant in his own exchange with reporters earlier. Thrusting at Israel, he said: "J am not the one who initiated the violence. I am not the one who is attacking Israelis. 
My tanks are not sieging Israeli towns. I did not order my tanks, my air force, my artillery, my heavy weapons, my navy." 
He interrupted his interpreter to make sure his English was conveyed as he wished. "We are facing a very dangerous situation that is really hindering the peace process," be said. "We are a nation with one airplane," Arafat said as he left. He met later at his Washington hotel with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

Ne-w cancer drug sho-ws promise, but cure .unlikely 
Associated Press 
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands 

Eagerly awaited test results on a much-publicized new cancer drug designed to stop tumors by cutting off their blood supply indi­cate the medication is safe and show promising signs it may help control the disease. 
However, the results discussed Thursday at a s}'Tilposium on new cancer drugs suggest that the drug endostatin is unlikely to be the kind of across-the-board can­cer cure that many had hoped for. 
The drug was tested on termi­nally ill cancer patients largely to assess its safety. 
No dramatic recoveries have so far been seen among the 61 patients studied. 
"Some patients benefitted, but many did not," said one of the an assistant professor of medicine at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. "These patients were very sick. Most of their tumors are going to grow no matter what you do." 
The best results were seen in a 50-year-old man with cancer in his jaw. 
His tumor shrank by 62 per­

cent in eight weeks. 
A tumor in the pancreas of 

another patient shrank by 19 
percent after he had been taking 
the drug for a year. 
ln five other cases, the disea,;;e 

remained stable, with the tumor 
neither progressing nor shrink­
ing. 
Despite the lack of cures, the 

testing provided some evidence 
the drug may cut off a tumor's 
blood supply, a'i intended, offer­
ing hope the approach could 
work better in patients who are 
less desperately ill. 
Blood flow through the tumors became less robust and chemi­cals involved in blood vessel cre­ation diminished as patients were given increasingly higher doses of endostatin. 
No serious side effects were 

noticed in any of the patients. the 
scientists said. 
While some experts considered the test results "tremendously promising," others were cau­tiously optimistic. 
The recent discovery that angiogenesis, or the creation of new blood vessels, is vital to a tumor's survival has been the

basis for the hottest area in can­cer research. 
Drugs that attack the process are called angiogenesis inhibitors. Endostatin is one of dozens of such drugs, which are at varying stages of development and attack blood vessel growth from differ­ent angles. 
"Manv of them have shown lit­tle toxicity, and this is not the first to show a response," said William Li, head of the Boston-based Angiogenesis Foundation, a non­profit information clearinghouse that tracks research in the field. 
"But it's unprecedented at this stage of testing to have such a comprehensive measurement of markers that indicate there might be a benefit." he added. 
Tracking the indirect indicators has allowed scientists to see more promising signs earlier in the research than normal, Li said. 
Besides M.D. Anderson. the Dana-Farber Cancer Center in Boston and the University of Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Center in Madison conducted the studies. 
The Boston study was spon­sored by the drug's maker. EntreMed of Rockville, Md., while the other two were funded by the 
U.S. National Cancer Institute. 
Some experts predict endo­statin and the other drugs will in most cases halt cancer growth, turning the disease from an acute fatal illness into a low-level ongo­ing condition, like diabetes or arthritis. 

Miguel Flores was strapped to a chamber gurney for the execu­tion, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 vote, denied his request for a reprieve. 
Earlier this week. both the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals refused to halt the execution, the 35th this year in the nation's most active death penalty state. 
Flores, 31, was condemned to die for abducting, raping and stabbing to death 20-year-old Angela l\farie Tyson as she left her summer job at a video store in 1989. lie issued an apology to Tyson's relatives before he was executed. 
"I want to say I'm sorry. I said a prayer today for you so you can have peace. I hope you can forgive me," Flores said, choking back tears. 
When Flores was arrested, he was not allowed to contact the Mexican consulate as called for under the Vienna Convention of Consular Relations, his backers argued 
"We firmly believe that timely assistance from the Mexican consulate would have meant the difference between life and death for Miguel Flores," attor­ney Richard Ellis said. 
Roy Carper, who prosecuted Flores, countered: "There's no dispute that wasn't done. But Mr. Flores claimed to be a U.S. citizen, and that would knot:k out anything the Mexican gov­ernment has to do about it."

Tennessee's Republican Party is proud to have partnered with the gun lobby to deny the Democratic nominee the state. Many view Hepublican hostility towards President Clinton in both Arkansas and Tennessee as more tenacious than any­one's loyalty to college football teams like the Razorbacks or Volunteers. 
The second surprise is the so-called "butterfly ballot" in Palm Beach County, Florida, which increased the size of the print so older voters could better see the candidate names. In an effort to fit all the presidential candidates near the top of the ballot, the names were listed on both sides of the punch hole instead ol'the usual listing on the left side. No state should permit their various counties to separately devise the layout of a ballot, thus setting the stage for the Palm Beach fiasco. 
While the nation focuses on Florida's recounting of the popular votes, which will determine the electoral vote winner and ultimately the president, the voters themselves made statements on exit poll surveys which were contrary to what the polling tracked.

In fact, more voters cited honesty as the factor most influencing their vote than named any single policy issue, which was a stunning blow to the vice presi­dent's strategy. 
Overall, one-fourth of voters said hon­esty was the personal quality that mat­tered most to them. Bush captured more than three-fourths of those suipporters. Bush also succeeded in securirig two­thirds of votes cast by the 13 percent of Americans seeking a president who would demonstrate good judgment in a crisis. Among the 15 percent ofvoters who ranked "experience" as the quality that mattered most to them, the vice president was the stronger candidate. 
Exit polls showed that overnll. 18 per­cent of voters said the economy was fore­most in their choice for president, 15 per­cent cited education, 14 percent cited social security, 13 percent named taxes and 12 percent named international affairs. Healthcare garnered 8 percent while Medicare funding for prescription drugs got 7 percent -two prnminent issues for the Gore campaign -were ranked lowest among voters nationwide. 
Remarkably, the Texas governor was the dominant choice among voters nam­ing world issues as most important. Bush also led among those who listed taxes as their most important issues, but the vice president secured the votes of those rank­ing the economy, education and social security as key. 
Bush and Gore received support from their traditional party bases, but split the vote among Independents, 45 percent to 44 percent, respectively. Even though Ralph Nader drew only 3 percent of the popular vote, two points less 1;han pre­election polls predicted, his impact was two percent in Florida. hurting Gore's 
candidacy. 
At the national level, exit polls found 9 percent of liberals casting their votes for Nader, as well as 6 percent of Independents. Nader also had appeal among voters who believe Al Gore has been too conservative on the issues. 
The resull'i also clearly indicate that Nader gained support from younger vot­ers, which clearly came at the expense of' Gore. Among those 18 to 29, Gore edged out Bush, 48 percent to 46 percent, and 5 percent went to Nader. Notably, Gore's vote with this age group was five poinl'i lower than President Clinton received in 1996. 
Bush decisively took the white males (60 percent), wealthy Americans (54 per­cent of those with incomes exceeding $100,000) and married couples with chil­dren under the age of 18 (56 percent) in this week's election. 
Gore was the preferred candidate among women (54 percent). senior citi­zens (51 percent), African-Americans (90 percent), Latinos (62 percent), Asians (55 percent), Jewish voters (79 percent) and Catholic voters (50 percent). Abortion rights proponents, 56 percent of the elec­torate were strong supporters of Gore. 
The election is keeping the nation transfixed about which man will emerge as victor with only a handful of votes sep­arating the two candidates. Absentee bal­lots have yet to arrive in Florida and recounts will continue. One court will def­initely consider a challenge that has been filed. Regardless of who eventually wins the contest, the exit polls have shown that both campaigns' appeal to the electorate was not quite what we originally expected -sort of like the outcome of Florida.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Reacting to issues raised by the election 
Electoral College should stay firmly in place 
This letter is in response to the Nov. 7 editorial calling for the abolition of the electoral college. The editorial board points out that voters today have greater access to information about candi­dates and that the principle of equality requires a decision via popular vote. 
The editorial is wrong. The chief reason why we should retain the electoral college is that it cuts down on fraud. For example, so long as Illinois Democrats know their state only gets 24 electoral votes no matter how high the turnout. they will lack the motive to pad their state's vote totals. In a popular vote though, padding in a few large states could make the difference. Admittedly. politi­cians will always have a motive to commit fraud when the contest in their state is close. 
As for the idea that equality requires a popular vote, that value is outweighed by other considerations in our confederated repub­
lic. We have a system of checks and balances designed to see that the majority does not tyrannize the minority. The electoral col­lege, like the Senate, dampens the power of states with large pop­ulations to impose their will on smaller states. This seems particu­larly appropriate in the 21st Century, when much of.the popula­tions of those large states are dependent upon federal entitle­ments (i.e., the elderly). Many people in the more urban states do not "vote" so much as they arc "voted." (Witness Al Gore's ruth­less attempts to scare the elderly this fall.) To dampen the elec­toral influence of these voters serves to ensure that the election will be decided by those voters who stand at arm's length from the federal government and who can therefore, like disinterested jurists. objectively evaluate the candidates. These voters are able to judge Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush based on the merits of the two men and not on the ability of each to put money in their pockets. 
I will heartily embrace the abolition of the electoral college when we disenfranchise every voter who collects a check from the federal government each month.

Invitation ofLieberman compromised University's Catholic morality 
The extremelv close election results in Florida and around the' nation demonstrate that this University should have taken a stronger stance and not allowed Senator Lieberman, a Pro­Choice candidate, to speak here. In a race that Lieberman predicted would be as close as "one extra vote per voting precinct." Notre Dame pro­vided a one-sided forum for Lieberman's mes­sage and placed its imprimatur on the entire dis­play. Not only did the seal of this Catholic University stand physically behind the' senator as he spoke in Washington Hall. but now the specter of our Notre Dame president shaking hands with Lieberman before that seal continues to stand symbolically as implicit approval of Lieberman's policies. 
Lieberman came here for political purposes ­one of which (his record indicates and his run­ning mate proudly declared) is the continued legalization of abortion. Consequently, Lieberman's presence at Notre Dame possibly served to influence undecided voters on this campus, in this community and around the nation. Undecided Catholic voters in Florida especially, looking for guidance in this election. may have been misled by Notre Dame's failure to speak out against Lieberman's policies. Indeed, CNN exit polls indicate that 50 percent of Catholic voters voted for Gore, while 47 per­cent voted for Bush. In a race in which the win­ner will directly affect the composition of the Supreme Court and have a say in the continued legalization of partial-birth abortion, Notre Dame failed to fulfill its responsibility of provid­ing leadership to this nation's Catholic voters. How ironic that Lieberman's message was.criti­cal of those who "shrink from drawing bright lines and making moral judgments." For, simply allowing Lieberman to speak proved his point. This University "shrink[ed] from drawing" such "bright lines" by ignoring the abortion issue while Lieberman was here. Notre Dame should have seized the opportunity to promote the sanc­tity of life and provide guidance for voters despite Lieberman's efforts to avoid the issue. 
The current application for admission to Notre Dame asks prospective students, "for what cause would you choose to be an 'extremist for justice' as defined by Dr. [Martin Luther] King" in his Letter from the Birmingham Jail. Should any of the thousands of applicants hoping for admission discuss abortion, they might be disappointed upon acceptance as they realize that here too at Notre Dame, where one hopes to find passion about this issue, one is instead disappointed by passivity. 
This is not to say that no contrary political candidate may speak at this school. Rather, Notre Dame must act with responsibility as a Catholic University as it promotes such academic discussions. Allow political speeches and debates of diverse viewpoints but do so in an academic manner presenting various sides of the issue. The close nature of the election and the ratio­nale offered by political commentators that there are no "burning" issues dividing the nation, call to mind that single voice breaking the silence during Lieberman's Notre Dame speech­"What about abortion?" As so great a cause (Pro-Life movement) now relies upon so few votes (those in Florida), Notre Dame, like that single voice in the Lieberman's audience here, should have stood before the academic commu­nity and the nation to demand of Leiberman/Gore an answer to the question ­"What about abortion?"

For Fritz Holegrefe, Class of 1964, the stakes were much higher when he was caught in a bar as an undergrad. 
"If you got caught in a raid, you were gone," he said. 
Holegrcfe went to a vastly different Notre Dame than the school under the Dome today. The rules were strict, sti­fling and unforgiving. At the then all­male school, dorm room visits from girls were forbidden. daily mass was practically mandatory and most of South Bend was taboo. The Fathers of the Holy Cross tried to

around if you could. Class of 1956 course, there were 
breaking labor and lunch breaks that were too short. 
Soon the officers reached Holegrefe and the two men. They asked the man on Holegrefe's left for his ID. 
"The cop came by and we're sitting here raising hell about work and they card this guy next to me -he's 55." Holegrefe said. "So the other guy says 'What are you carding us for? Me and this guy [HolegrefcJ had a really bad day at work."' 
The embarassed officer just walked away without carding Holegrefe. Thanks to some quick thinking. llolegrefe remained in school long enough to earn his degree and gradu­ate in 1964. 
Graduates from Notre Dame in the 50s and 60s remember the University being a much stricter school with rules like bed checks, morning checks and dress codes. 
"Notre Dame was a whole lot differ­
ent than it is today," 
said Tom Rohrer, 
Class of 1956. "We 
but certain parts of town were off-limits," llolegrefe said. "Probably 3/4 of the city of South Bend was off-limits. If you were caught. it didn't make a darn bit of difference when you were caught, you were out." 
So when South Bend police raided Joer's Bar and Grill in South Bend. as a 19-year-old student. Ifolegrefe knew he was in trouble. 
He first tried to hide from the cops in the women's bathroom. but it was already full of frightened underage patrons. Next he ventured to the base­ment where there was a special room for avoiding the offi­cers. But again, he was too late. The back­room was stuffed with students. 
So llolegrefe went back up to the bar and sat down between two older men -one  in his mid­50s and

one in his early 60s. "I said

'Guys, lis­ten to me and let's carry on a convers,t­tion. We are going to talk about how lousy a day we had at work."' Holegrefe said. 
So the Notre Dame undergrad and the two older, bluecollar workers began to complain and gripe about how awful their jobs were, They traded made-up stories about overbearing bosses, back

wasn't just an all­male school before 1972; women were barely allowed on campus ­and never into a student's dorm room. 
"It was all you could do to get your mother in your room on a football weekend," Holegrefe said. "When I was here, you had four service acad­emies in the country -Army, Navy. Air Force ... and Notre Dame. Ahd in this place, the rules were probably tougher." 
While alcohol was banned from campus. students still found a way to keep a little beer around and, like today, adminis­trators usually turned a blind eye to the occasional on campus alcohol vio­
lation. 
J i m Haering, Class of 1955. said 

he and his fellow Howard Hall resi­dents used to keep bottles of beer in the flush tanks of toilets to keep them cold. Little refigerators didn't exist yet. so the cold water kept the 
beer at least a little bit cooler. This method worked 
for several months without a problem until a notice was tacked to the bulletin boards by the 
rector asking students to stop putting beer bottles in the tanks. Apparently. the labels kept falling off the bottles and clogging up the plumbing. 
A few weeks later, another notice appeared on the boards thanking the students for switching to canned beer and ending the label problem. 
Another alum­nus relates a story from the 60s when sever­al students rigged one of the soda fountains in the dorm to dispense beer rather than Coke. Although the keg was seized as soon as the rector dis­
posedly was too intrigued by the ingi­nuity shown by the students to prose­cute anyone. 
Despite stories of unpunished alcohol violations, Notre Dame administrators mostly kept a vigilant eye on students when they were on campus. Students were expected to be in bed at 11 p.m.

"Lights went out at 11," Rohrer said. "The electrici­ty went out at 11."

Mercer's 23 points leads Chicago past Orlando 
Associated Pr,ss 

.. 
CHICAGO 
Playing their most spirited ganrn of the season, thfi Chicago Bulls defeated Tracy McGrudy -one of the free agents who spurned them ­and thn Orlando Magic 95-90 Thursday night for their first win of the season. 
McGrady scorr.d 21, only one below his average, but was just 'J-of-19 from the line. Ho had two turnovers to go with his six rebounds and six assists. Bulls fans booed him every time he got the ball. 
Chicago wined and dined McGrady during free agency this summer, taking him to Wrigley Field and introducing him to Sammy Sosa. But he signed with Orlando instead, and fans haven't forgiven him yet. 

There was a loud chorus of boos as McGrady hit a 3-point­er with 11 seconds left to cut Chicago's lead to 93-90, but Ron Artest hit a pair of free throws and the Magic couldn't get any closer. 
Hon Mercer, the Hulls' big pickup after McGrady, Grant llill and Eddie Jones all dis­missed them, had his best game in a Chicago uniform. lie recorded season-highs with 23 points and 10 rebounds, and also had a steal and two blocked shots. 
Michael Huffin grabbed a career-high 18 rebounds and added 10 points. A.J. Guyton had 18, and Marcus Fizer added 14.
-
Michael Doleac and Pat Garrity added a spark off the bench, scoring 15 and 14 points, respectively. Darrell Armstrong had 13. 

The Magic looked as if they were still worn out from Wednesday's loss to the Charlotte Hornets. The Bulls, meanwhile. showed the energy and enthusiasm they've lacked lately. 
They hustled for the ball, pushed it upcourt and smoth­ered McGrady, making him work hard for every shot. He missed his first five shots of' the night and finished the first quarter just 1-of-6. His team­mates weren't much better, as the Magic made just four bas­kets in the first 10 minutes oJ' the first quarter. 
Mercer's one-handed layup started a 17-4 run that gave Chicago a 19-point lead with 
6:37 left in the third. But Chicago went cold. and Garrity and Armstrong got the Magic back in the game. 
Garrity's 18-foot jumper started a 12-3 run that cut the Bulls lead to 68-56 with 3:56 !ell. and Armstrong's layup cul it to 70-62 with 1:05 left. Orlando got within 74-66 with 
9:59 left on baskets from Garrity and Armstrong, but Guyton stopped the spurt with a 3-pointer. 
The Bulls opened up an 81-72 lead with 6:44 left on Marcus Fizer's hook shot, but the Bulls went almost three minutces without a field goal. McGrady converted on a three-point play, Monty Williams hit a layup, and Doleac drilled a 17 ­foot jumper to bring the Magic within 82-79 with 4:23 left.

Kansas sneaks past UCLA

Hoy Williams' 13th season as coach at Kansas got off to a good start, then came yet another question about what he did last sum­mer. 
The Jayhawks' Drew Gooden beats Matt Barnes to a rebound. one of lO Gooden got in the win. No sooner had the Jayhawks (No. 6 USA Today/ESPN, No. 7 AP) beaten the UCLA Bruins 
Today/ESPN. No. 17 AP) 99-98 in the opener of the Coaclrns vs. Cancer Classic on Thursday night than Williams faced another question about his decision to stay at Kansas rather than move to North Carolina, his alma mater where he worked for 10 seasons as an assistant to Dean Smith. 
"This summer got too emotional," said Williams, who 
announced his decision to remain at Kansas in front of media and fans at the footbali stadium. "It was my dream to coach at North Carolina but now it's over with. The kids arc the reason I stayed." 
Most of those kids came up big on the offensive end early as the Jayhawks led by as many as 16 points in the first half. 
Kenny Gregory scored 24 points and Kirk Hinrich added 21 for Kansas, which shot 65 percent from the field in the first half but had to hold off the Bruins down the stretch with offen­sive rebounding and free-throw shooting. 
"We were fortunate to win this one -our defense was not good," Williams said.

Kentucky 62-61, Gregory, Kansas' lead­ing returning scorer at 
12.8 points per game, had 15 as the Jayhawks built a 57-51 halftime lead. While Gregory's scoring was expected, that wasn't the case with sophomore point guard Kirk Hinrich. 
Hinrich, who averaged 

5.5 points last season with a high game of 12, had 13 points in the first ­half during which Kansas built a 24-8 lead over the opening seven minutes. 
"We knew how good a 3-point shooting team they are so we knew it wasn't over," Hinrich said. "I'm surprised we didn't have a better defensive game." 
UCLA, which missed eight of its first 10 shots from the field, started chipping away behind the 3-point shooting of sophomore Jason Kapono, the Bruins' leading returning scorer at 16.0

The Yankees had baseball's highest payroll at $113.4 million, not including bonus­es, followed by Atlanta ($95 million). Los Angeles ($94.2 million), Boston ($93.9 mil­lion) and the New York Mets ($89.7 million).

Selig will release a plan to tackle the issue in the "very near future." I-le said base­ball's renaissance the last few years could be threat­ened if more teams are left behind. 
Since the 1994-95 strike, no team has advanced to the league championship series without a payroll in the top half.

San Francisco went 97-65, fin­ishing 11 games ahead of sec­ond-plarn Arizona, the largest margin among the six division winners. The Giants then lost 3­1 to the Mets in the first round of the playolTs. 
"We're all young, and hopAful­ly this is the start of a long good run for us," Baker said. "It takes a long time to build this sort of team. In my 33 years in baseball, I can name on one han<l the teams I've seen like this." 
After the playoff loss, Haker signed his fourth two-year con­tract with the Giants, a $5.25 million deal that made him one of baseball's highest-paid man­agers.

Woods warns he may leave tour 
'-Would they be playing for that much money if Tiger was not the most recognized athlete in the world? That's not for us to say," he said. "There are too many issues involved to single that one out. Money doesn't solve it all. It's what you can do on your own without people trying to limit you from doing that." 
In negotiating the mammoth Nike deal, the sticking point in di<;eussions that lasted over a year was getting back Woods' market­ing rights, specifically with the Internet. 
That appears to be the case again. 
Tour regulations allow the use of player images in tomnament­related advertisements, and Woods has agreed to those condi­tions as a Tour member. 
But conflicts abound. 

While Mercedes runs weekly ads to show who qualified for its winners-only tomnament, Woods has a $30 million deal with Buick. And last week, Woods won a fall bonus program sponsored by PricewaterhouseCoopcrs. Woods has a contract with American Express. 
"Do you think it's fair that they can use his name like that because they're affiliated with the Tour? ls that fair?" Steinberg said. "It's about rights. It's not about money. It's more about equity and fairness." 
This is not the first time Woods has led the charge on a divisive issue. He also refused to back down over intense public scrutiny when he, Duval and Mark O'Meara questioned the $63 mil­lion in revenues the PGA of America made off the Ryder Cup. 
Ultimately, the PGA gave each player $200,000 to di,.,idc among their colleges and favorite chari­ties. 
Nor is this the first time players have argued with the PGA Tour about such issues as advertising rights, releases to play in interna­tional events and media fees for their special tournaments. 
Nick Price said the implied endorsements have been going on as long as he has played the Tour. 
"If he can take on the Tour and beat the Tour, so be it," Price said. "I never felt I was strong enough to win. What Tiger has tried to do, a lot of guys have tried to do. Let's see what happens."

Associated Pre.s 
SOTOGRANDE, Spain 
Tiger Woods stood his ground Thursday in his criticism of the PGA Tour, saying his complaint is about getting control of his own marketing rights, not about more TV money. 
He also refused to rule out leaving thP. PGA Tour if the issues aren't set­tled. 
"We're just wanting to get our rights back, and not having these implied endorsements," Woods said. "There's a lot the public doesn't understand and doesn't know about." 
Woods, whose impact on the game has been a driving force in the record level of prize money on the PGA Tour, said he would meet with commissioner Tim Finchem "when we can all sit down," but he did not set a time. 
"It's not about getting a cut of lhe TV revenue," Woods said. "It's about doing what's right by the players. The players and the PGA Tour have been bucking heads on a lot of issues. The pub­lic has no idea, but we do it all the 
tim. " 
e. 
Finchem arrived at Valderrama 
for meetings but was not expect­
ed to be at the golf course until 
Friday. 
Woods, who is trying to become the first player in 50 years to win 10 times in one season, added: 'Tm busy this week." 
When asked if he would ever 
leave the Tour, Woods shrugged 
his shoulders, smiled and 
hummed ominously. 


Ultimately, it could aU lead to a power struggle between Woods and Finchcm, and Woods' impact on the sport gives him a strong hand. 
"He's such a powerful figure in the world of golf, you have to treat him with a bit of respect," said Chubby Chandler, the agent for European stars Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke. 
Along V'.ith being the No. 1 play­er in the world, Woods has become the biggest star in sports. When his five-year, $100 million contract with Niki' kicks in next year, his annual endorsements with 12 companies will be worth about $54 million annually. 
One of his strongest complaints Ls how other companiPs affiliated with the PGA Tour take advan­tage of his image. 
Mark Steinberg, his agent at !MG, cited the season-opening Mercedes Championship in Hawaii, with a field limited to PGA Tour winners. It runs a congratu­latory advertisement V\ith tourna­ment winners everv week. 
"Du they have to· congratulate a guy nine times?" Steinberg said. 
Woods said such "implied endorsements" have occurred after just about every tournament he has ever won. He said he saw a commercial during the Canadian Open that featured him, David Duval and Vijay Singh, even though the latter two did not play that week. 
"I don't know if the Tour says, 'Go ahead and run it,' or if they just run with it," Woods said. "We'd like to get an answer, and we dcseIVe that." 
Woods did not say he deseJVes more of the 1V money he is large­ly responsible for generating. 
Shortly after Woods won The Masters, the Tour signed a four­year TV deal worth about $500 million. Total prize money this vear was more than $160 million, ~early triple the level when Woods turned pro. The nexi con­tract, coming off Woods winning three straight majors, will be

SAN DIEGO 
The San Diego Padres made a new contract ofTer to free agent Tony Gwynn for less than half of what he'd gotten if the tnam had picked up his $6 million option lbr 2001. 
'Tm disappointed in the offer. but it looks like that's what the Padrcs feel good about," agent John Boggs said Wednesday night. 
Boggs can start entertaining offers from other teams starting Saturday. Gwynn, a member of the 3,000-hit club and an eight­

.., lime NL batting champion. is a !'rm~ agent for the first time after playing 19 seasons for the Padres. "It wouldn't be reaching many high goals by topping this oiler," Boggs said. Boggs and Padres general man­ager Kevin Towers refused to divulge figures. However, baseball sources speaking on the condition of anonymity said the offer included a guaranteed $1 million salary and anothcr $1.5 million in incen­tives. Boggs would say only that if Gwynn reaches the incentives, he still wouldn't come close to the $6 million he would have gotten had the Pa!,lrcs picked up his option. 
vrhe perplexing issue is, if Tony is healthy, I would think they would want to compensate him," Boggs said. 
Gwynn, 40, had surgery on his troublesome left knee June 27 and didn't return. lie had just 127 at-bats in 36 games. The Padres, feeling that Gwynn won't be an everyday player anymore,

the $6 million option. and would 
pay a $2 million buyout instead. 
The Padres made Gwynn an initial oiler of $1 million in base pay, contingent on him passing a medical exam. plus incentives. The day before he filed for free agency, Gwynn was cleared by the Padres' team doctor for all baseball activities. 
''I've just got to do my due dili­gcnce," Gwynn said Wednesday. "They bought me out and made nm a free agent. and f filed. Come Saturday. we can talk to other clubs." 
The two sides disagree on how to credit the $2 million buyout. The Padres say it will be part of any new deal Gwynn might agree to, but Boggs said the sides won't get anywhere if the Padres insist on counting it that way. 
The buyout is due to Gwynn on Jan. 15. 
"We had to look at the $2 mil­lion buyout, whether they do or not," Towers said. "It's money paid in 2001, and then we struc­tured the offer where there are guaranteed dollars with some incentives, which gives us some protection -if he's not able to play. If he does play, he has a chance to earn some pretty good dollars." 
Cleveland and Detroit have expressed interest in Gwynn, and Boggs said other teams have called, although he wouldn't elab­orate. 
"We're not going into this with no one interested in us," Boggs said. "There are teams out there that absolutely feel Tony can con­tribute, regardless of his playing time last year. If he's cleared medically to go and he can walk to the plate, teams are definitely

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Indians offer star 
Mariners win rights to Suzuki 

Associated Press 
AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. 

The Seattle Mariners agreed to pay more than $13 millign for the right to talk to a player few have seen play. Starting this weck­e n d , teams will bring out the real b g 
money. 
As base­ball's gen­eral man­agers laid t h e groundwork for trades and signings at their annual meet­ings this week. the only major move came Thursday when the Mariners won the bidding rights to Japanese All-Star lchiro Suzuki. 
The winning bid of $13,125,000 would be paid to Suzuki's Japanese team the Orix BlueWavc only if the Mariners sign the outfielder to a contract by 9 p.m. EST on Dec. 9. 
"There's always a risk with any player you sign be it an amateur, a professional free agent or a player from another professional league," Mariners GM Pat Gillick said. "Our peo­ple felt he was worth the risk. That's why we made the bid we did." 
Suzuki, 27, hit . 387 this sea­son to win his seventh straight 


Pacific League batting title. 
Suzuki is a career .353 hitter 
with 118 home runs and 529 
RBIs in nine seasons in Japan. 
Suzuki would be the first 
Japanese position player to 
make it in the majors. 
"He can do everything 
except hit with power," said 
Gillick. who envisions Suzuki 
as a right fielder. "I-le is more 
of a contact, slash type hitter. 
He's a very good defensive 
outfielder with an above aver­
age arm. He has hit for a num­
ber of years in Japan. 'Tm 
confident he can do it in the 
U.S." 

Suzuki is expected to sign _with the Mariners because of 
their large Japanese popula­
tion in Seattle and the pres­
ence of Kazuhiro Sasaki, who 
won the AL Rookie of the Year 
in his first season after leaving 
Japan. 

"He enjoyed his stay in 
Seattle and I think that will 
help quite a bit in negotiations 
with Ichiro," said Gillick, who 
will begin talking with agent 
Tony Attanasio in the next few 
days. 

The money Seattle agreed to 
pay for the rights to Suzuki 
will look like a bargain as soon 
as stars such as Alex 
Rodriguez, Manny Ramirez, 
Mike Hampton and Mike 
Mussina are free to negotiate 
financial terms with any team, 
starting Saturday. 
"There is nothing magical 
about Saturday," said Mets GM Steve Phillips, who is involved with all four top free agents. "It's a process not an event." 
The Toronto Rlue Jays start­ed the offseason spending spree last month when they signed Carlos Delgado to a $68 million, four-year con tract deal. 
Last week, Ramirez asked Cleveland for a $200 million, 10-year contract an amount the Indians are unwilling to pay. 
They countered Thursday with a seven-year offer worth more than $119 million, according to a baseball man­agement source speaking on the condition he not be identi­fied. 
"At some point over the weekend, we'll either continue the discussions or put them to bed and move forward," Hart said. 
Most of the teams that are talking seriously with the big free agents are among base­ball's biggest spenders. 
The New York Yankees are believed to be the favorite for Ramirez. The Mets are the leading contender for Rodriguez. Cleveland and Boston are battling it out over Mussina. and Atlanta is target­ing Hampton. · 
All those teams were in the top six in spending last season, demonstrating the growing disparity between the high­and low-revenue teams, according to commissioner. 
outfielder $I l 9M 
Associated Press 
CLEVELAND 
Unwilling to meet Manny Ramirez's demand for $200 million over 10 years, the Cleveland Indians offered the free agent outfielder a seven­year contract worth more than $119 million. 
The Indians faxed 
Ramirez's agent, Jeff 
Moorad, a counterproposal 
on Thursday averaging about 
$17 million, according to a 
baseball management source 
speaking on the condition he 
not be identified. 
The source said the Indians 
counteroffer was for seven 
years and that the per-year 
value was slightly more than 
the $17 million per season 
average the Toronto Blue 
Jays will pay first baseman 
Carlos Delgado beginning 
next season. 
An Indians spokesman con­
firmed the counterproposal 
was sent to Moorad but 
refused to discuss its con­
tents. 
Last Friday, Moorad sent a complex proposal to Cleveland owner Larry Dolan that would be the richest in sports history and make Ramirez baseball's first $20 million per year player. 
For the past week, the 
Indians have been analyzing 
both Moorad's acka e and 
their own economic situation. Cleveland general manager John Hart said he imagined the team would make a counter-proposal. and Thursday the Indians decid­ed to see if Moorad was will­ing to comc ..down in price. 
Moorad rejected a $75 mil­lion; five-year offer from the Indians in July. He has main­tained throughout the negoti­ations that Ramirez, 28, wants to stay in Cleveland and he would seek a career contract for his client. 
The Indians are the only team that can discuss salary with Ramirez through Friday. After that, Ramirez, who had 122 RBIs in just 118 games last season and 432 the past three years, is free to negotiate salary with any team. 
Earlier this week, Moorad said there were six teams three in each league who expressed an interest in talk­ing to him about Ramirez. He had already scheduled meet­ings at his Newport Beach, Calif., offices with two of those teams for early next week. 
The three-time World Series champion New York Yankees are believed to have targeted Ramirez as their No. 1 free-agent signing this win­ter. Ramirez grew up in New York.

slugger that Strawberry 
he would gel no more chances to end his repeated drug use, and his next violaiion would land him in prison. 
If you can't make it on the outside, I'll find a place where you can get treatment on the inside, she warned. 
Before a courtroom crowd that included former teammate Dwight Gooden, the judge ordered Strawberry to resume chemotherapy treatments he halted last month when he said he had lost the will to live. 
You have got to get the thera­py or you are history, Foster said. 
Prosecutors wanted to send Strawberry to prison, but Foster refused. 
She sentenced him to 30 days. With time served and other credit received under Hillsborough County jail rules, Strawberry could be free in about 10 days, although an exact date was not set at the hearing. 
After he is freed, Strawberry will be outtitted with an elec­tronic monitor that will alert his probation onicer if he again leaves a drug treatment center. 
Strawberry said he felt the impact ol' his first prolonged time behind bars and was ready to sober up.

in recovery. 
Strawberry told Foster the 
time he's already spent in jail 
has taught him a lesson. 
Less than a week ago, he told 
the judge he'd used drugs and 
stopped his chemotherapy 
because he wanted to die. 
Strawberry is under two 
years' house arrest for 1999 
charges of drug possession and 
soliciting a prostitute. His Oct. 
26 arrest for breaking house 
arrest was the third time he'd 
violated his probation. 
Assistant State Attorney 
Robin Fuson said he thought 
the sentence, which was rec­
ommended by Strawberry's 
probation onicer, was too light. 
Fuson expects Strawberry to be 
in trouble again. 
I hate to sound cynical, but I 
am. Fuson said. Very few peo­
ple complete these sentences. 
Strawberry's defense attor­ney argued that the 38-year-old couldn't get adequate care for cancer while in prison and needed to be returned to drug therapy to fight his addiction. 
Jonathan LaPook, the doctor who first detected Strawberry's cancer and has orchestrated his treatments, said Strawberry's cancer is extremely fierce and the best hope for him is aggressive, new chemotherapy treatments that can only be provided at top . cancer centers. 
The doctor described Strawberry's drug addiction and cancer as intertwined dis­eases that need to be treated simultaneously. He has recom­mended that Strawberry seek treatment in Minnesota at the Mayo Clinic and at Hazelden Foundation, a drug treatment center there. 
LaPook said Strawberry has no time to further dela·y his chemotherapy and said the ·slugger is down to one good shot in fighting the disease. He chemotherapy last month. 
Every bone in my body, every intuition tells me with Darryl we are in an emergency situa­tion, LaPook said as he testified via telephone from New York. 
LaPook said Strawberry also needed care for possible dehy­dration that can follow chemotherapy. Strawberry had one kidney removed this year after the cancer spread, and his remaining kidney could be harmed if dehydration isn't promptly treated. 
Seated in the audience watch­ing was Gooden, Strawberry's friend and teammate with the New York Mets and Yankees. Gooden, who himself had sub­stance abuse problems, said he came to the hearing to offer support, even though the two haven't talked since spring training. 
I just feel bad, Gooden said. I just feel terrible because that's someone who is basically like a family member going through a situation like this. 
Tim Sweeney, an attorney for the treatment center, HealthCare Connections of Tampa, told Foster that Strawberry will be under 24­hour surveillance. 
The center will turn Strawberry in if he leaves again. The electronic monitor produces computer records whenever the wearer strays outside set boundaries, and that becomes evidence to send an offender back to jail. 
The judge also ordered Strawberry to undergo random drug tests three times a week and to attend the Narcotics Anonymous meetings at the center.

CROSS COUNTRY 
Irish men prepped for return trip to Nationals 
Women ready to run at Districts 

By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 
Associare Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame men's cross country team has put itself in strong position for a return trip to the NCAA Championships. 
With a top-20 ranking, three meet titles and a 10th place finish at Pre-Nationals to their credit, the Irish just need to maintain at Saturday's NCAA District IV Championships. 
"They've been ranked in the top 20 in the country since the rankings really got going in October," Irish coach Tim Connelly said. "You would expect them to be at Nationals." 
While the top two finishers will win automatic spots at nationals, Notre Dame should be a shoo-in for an at-large berth even if it places fourth or fifth overall. Beating so many quality teams this sea­son will likely impress the NCAA selection committee. 
"The men have a lot more margin for error right now," Connelly said. "Because they have run well all year, they've got a bunch of al-large points. 
Despite the breathing room, Notre Dame is aiming for a top-two finish so it can deter­
mine its own fate. 
"As a team, our goal is to get an automatic bid," junior Marc Striowski said. "We've beaten every team except for Wisconsin, so I think that it's pretty realistic. If we have just an average race. we shouldn't finish anything less than sec­ond." 
Top opponents for Notre Dame will be Big 10 power­houses Wisconsin, Michigan State and Indiana, along with regional foes Eastern Michigan and Butler. 
"We've beaten Indiana and Eastern Michigan already twice," Striowski said, "and those are our main competi­tion for second." 
The Irish regrouped after finishing three points out of third place at the Big East Championships. They rested their legs a little bit, and turned their focus to Districts. 
Top runner Luke Watson and Striowski, both juniors and All-Big East selections, will pace the team Saturday. 
"Luke and I have to run up front," Striowski said. "Then Pat [Conway] and the fresh­man Todd Mobley have to be in the top 20. Our fifth, sfxth and seventh guys have to run together, and hopefully, one of them will finish in the top 40."

year we've had seven poople step up and run as well as they can," women's cross country coach Tim Connelly said, "which is what we need to do." 
The Irish have a single senior running varsity, Chrissy Kuenster. The lark of experi­ence may have been a factor in early-season struggles. 
"They're fit. We've got girls with talent. The one thing it might be is a lack of confi­dence." Connelly said, "The one senior that we've got in the group is running very, very well. She's exceeded my expec­tations." 
Different runners have stepped up all season long. Some days, it's been Kuenster, other times, Jen Handley or Hachel Endress have taken on the challenge. But never have all seven varsity runners hit the mark.

About 30 teams will take the line at Districts. Thu top two finishers earn automatic berths to the NCAA Championships. At-large schools are also select­ed based on their pcrf'orinance during the season. Since Notr<\ Dame has not raced up to its practice potential. according to Connelly. it likely needs at least a top-three finish to make it to nationals. 

"We've got to step it up immensely," Connelly said. "We're probably going to have to finish no worse than third." 
The race will be 6,000-mcters long, a kilometer up from the usual 5.000-meter distancP. 

"Mostly people are just excit­ed," llandlfly said. "It could bP our last race. People arc just going to go to the line with as much intensity as they havn lef't."

ELIZABETH LANG/The Observer Villanova goes up for a block against Notre Dame in the Sept. 29 Irish win against the Wildcats. 
Irish wrap up conference season 
By RACHAEL PROTZMAN 
Sport, W ri tcr 
The Notre Dame volleyball team ends its conference sea­son this weekend as it travels to Syracuse. 
"We are approaching this weekend with the mindset that we have one last job to do in our Big East season. We need to go in playing at our highest level in preparation to win not only the season championship, but also the tournament cham­pionship," said sophomore Keara Coughlin. 
The Irish, 22-5 overall and 10-0 in the Big East, have secured the league title, but will look to remain undefeated in the Big East at 11-0 for the fifth time in six years. This will be the last chance that Syracuse has to get into the Big East Tournament. 
"We can't allow ourselves to get in a slump in the middle of a game. We need to keep a competitive edge through three games to finish out the confer­ence season," Coughlin said. 
Syracuse, 23-9 overall and 6­4 in the conference, will look for its second win in history against the Irish, the first being in 1981. Notre Dame has since won seven games against the Orangewomen. Dana Fiume will look to pose a threat to the Irish defense by adding to her season total of 501 kills. 
"Our blocking should be very good this weekend," said Coughlin. "All year we've been playing against very different types of competition and now that we're nearing the end of our season, all the aspects of our game should be better for 
it." 
The Irish are coming off a victory in its last regular season match against St. Louis (15-5, 15-5, 15-10). Senior co-captain Christi Girton led the Irish with 15 kills and 11 digs while class­mate Adrienne Shimmel set a career-high nine kills and five digs. Junior Kristy Kreher added 13 kills, six digs and four blocks. 
"The St. Louis match was a lot of fun for the seniors. It was great for us as underclassmen to see the five of them go out on the court and play in a way that shows how valuable they arc to the volleyball program," said Coughlin.

A "sub-par" performance by the Irish was good enough to drum the California Midwest

Student tnanagers play critical role in Irish athletics 
-

By JOHN BACSIK 
Spores Writer 
It's 6 p.m. on a Friday nighL. 
While most students are busy 
making their night's plans or 
walking over to the pep-rally, 
more than 70 student mangers 
work diligently inside the gales of 
the house that Rockne built. 
Every Friday before a home football game, 54 sophomores, .21 juniors and three seniors gather in the stadium around 2 
p.m. After working through the final football practice of the week, these managers take part in one of the richest traditions in college football -the painting of the helmel'i. 
"The best thing about painting the helmets is the tradition and the mystique behind it," said equipment manager Mike Hormuth. "We'n~ the onlv school in the nation that does this on a weekly basis, and not just anyone can be a part ofit." 
The common misconception about the student managers is that they arc exactly what people have seen in the movie "Hudy" ­all fun and no work. Unfortunately for these students, things are not as easy as just painting those hnlmets and going to a bar al'terwards. 
"This job takes more dedication than people might expect. We can work anywhere from 45-60 hours during a football week, and then we all have to balance school along with that." said per­sonnel manager Chris Bacsik. 
While the rest of his crew pre­pares things for Saturday's game, head manager senior Mike Ball travels off-campus with the team on Friday nights to help super­vise things in their hotel accom­modations. Ball chooses one junior manager each week to join him and the team at the hot.el. This junior then leads the team into the Basilica on Saturday morning before the game, a responsibility that is appropriate­ly dubbed the "coat and tic" tra­dition. 
Student managers arc respon­sible for the ordinary and the obscure. They set up the field before practices, chart the offen­sive and defensive plays for every game. and record the amount of time spent on the field for each player. They also make sure each

coach has their candy/gum of choice in their respective lockers, and they provide head coach Bob Davie with his supply of cafleine­free Diet Coke for every practice. 
"The coaches expect just as much from the managers as they do from the players," said Ball. "I think our role in this organization is a very important one." 
Just like the varsity athletes they work with, the student man­agers have a playbook of their own. The weekly assignments and responsibilities for each manager are posted online every week. While the juniors strictly work with the football team dur­ing the season. the sophomore managers are assigned to a vari­ety of' sports. 
The managers make up a gen­erous mix of males and females. Forty-six females, including 11 from Saint Mary's, are currently involved in the managers' organi­zation. 
"Evcryont1 works together on a daily basis," said junior manager Erin West. "We' re all working towards the same cause here." 
The student managers are admittedly friends as well as working partners. This makes

their year-end task even more difficult. Come Nov. 22, the juniors will rank their peers to determine next year's three senior football managers. The sophomores face a similar situa­tion in April, when they rank each other to decide who will obtain the 21 junior manager spot.5. 
"There are many long hours and some bumps in the road when you're a manager," said women's basketball manager Gretchen Schumer. "Overall, though, we have so many doors opened lo us, and we receive scholarships f'or our senior years. which makes everything worth­while." 
Student managers started working for Knute Bockne in the 1920s, and they have been an integral part of the football pro­gram ever since. 
Junior manager Hob Mallory expressed his feelings on the experience as a whole. "This is something I feel privileged to be a part of. Not all the work we do is glamorous," he said, "but we love what we're doing. I wouldn't trade these experiences for any­thing in the world."

Top-seeded Irish

Spores Wri tcr 
All season lung Nutre Dame women's soccer head coach Handy Waldrum has not minced wurds in articulating his squad's lofty goals. t\fter rnaching the NCAA champi­onship game last year before losing to North Carolina, Waldrum's mission t his time around is clear -the Irish want to be national champions. 
"We came so close last year," said Waldrum. "We were with­in 45 minutes of winning it all. This year, from the get go, our goal was not to just get back but to win it all." 
In the sprint for this year's title, the Irish have the pole position, seeded first in the NCAA tournament bracket by virtue of their 20-0-1 regular season record. t\s the top seed, the Irish will play all games 

... through the quarterfinals at home in the friendly confines of Alumni Field. With the top 16 teams getting a free pass to round two, the Irish will begin their champi­onship quest with a second

The Notre Dame hockey team hosts No. 1 Boston College Saturday. The Catholic school match-up is the second time the team will meet, after a 4-1 Eagles win in Boston earlier this season. 
Boston College and Notre Dame have played once before this year, with the Eagles winning 4-1. 
"We don't have any intimi­dation against Boston College. We are ready to play lhis game," sophomore defenseman Paul llarris said. "This is a big sports week­end, and the game is going to be a sellout, so we are excit ed." 
The game could be an important momentum boost for the Irish. After getting swept by Michigan State two 

weeks ago, Notre Dame fought back to a win and a tie on the road at Miami (Ohio). 
The team has struggled defensively in the first month of the season. But a large part of that has been due to injuries. There have only been a couple of, games where the Irish has played with six defensive skaters. Tonight, Notre Dame will only have five defensemen. 
One of those will be senior left winger Jay Kopischke, who was moved to defense due to injuries. An added benefit of this is that it will give Notre Dame an offensive minded presence on defense, and every goal will count against the No. 1 team in the country. 
"With Kopischke on defense, we will hopefully be able to get more offensive opportunities from the point. 
and more break a ways, senior Dan Carlson said. 
The Irish have also worked hard on their special teams. This showed last weekend, with the power play giving Notre Dame two goals in their 5-1 pasting of Miami (Ohio). With the inexperience and injuries on defense, the power play production was a sigh of relief for Notre Dame. 
"The power play has been struggling, but we have picked it up, and have had a lot more chances the past couple of games," said Carlson. 
Boston College has the tal­ent to back up their No. 1 ranking. They displayed this in a 4-1 beating of Notre Dame on Oct. 13 in Omaha, Neb. The Eagles held Notre Dame in check thanks to the solid goaltending of senior goalie Scott Clemmensen, who stopped 25 of 26 shots. 
Krys Kolanos leads the team in goals with 10 while Brian Gionta has nine assists and 13 points for the Boston College offensive attack. Boston College brings a 9-2-0 record into tonight's game. However, the Eagles second loss came this past Tuesday when they lost 4-3 to Yale. 
Despite their opponent's recognition, Notre Dame believes that they can play with the No. 1 team in the country. Offense, defense, and special teams have all been playing better for the Irish. With a little luck and some hard work. Notre Dame can pull this thing out. But they will need a solid effort from everyone on the team. 
"We feel pretty good about this game," Carlson said. "We played well against them last time, and had some chances. We need everyone to step up and get the job done." 
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
McGraw lands top recruits 
By NOAH AMSTADTER 
Assiscanc Sports Editor 

Follo"rving the departure or head men's basketball coach Matt Doherty artcr only one season. the importance of being able to guar­ante{) continuity in the coaching staff during recruiting has become magnified at Notre Dame. 
As a reward for the team's suc­cess -as well as providing a powerful recruiting tool -first­year athletic director Kevin White rewarded head women's basket­ball coach Mullet McGraw with a live-year contract that will keep McGraw at Notre Dame through the 2004-2005 season. 
"Coach McGraw has indeed demonstrated that Notre Dame can be a consistent player at the elite level of women's basketball and this contract represent'i our mutual interest in advancing this respective level of achievement," White said Thursday in a pre­pared statement. 
Although the contract was first announced Thursday, McGraw said she signed it quite a while ago. As a result, she was able to tell prospective members of the Class of' 2005 that she indeed would be under contract as their coach for their entire career. 
McGraw came out of the recruiting jungle with one of the most solid recruiting classes in the short history of Irish women's basketball. Four of the five recruits announced Wednesday afternoon are ranked among the top 100 high school seniors by Blue Star basketball, including two players with close ties to Notre Dame. 
Jacqueline Battcast, a 6-foot for­ward who attends South Bend's Washington high school, is sum to quickly become a crowd favorite. 
'Tm so excited about having a local player," said McGraw. "Our crowds have really increased already. Our season ticket sales arc way up. We feel like that's going to help us even more." 
Batteast already is a two-time Northern Indiana Conference most valuable player, averaging 21 points and 14 rebounds per game last year. Shn likely will start out at the power forward position. although her 3-point shooting skills make her a versa­tile addition to the IrL'ih olfonsn.

Eagle head coach 

By BRIAN BURKE Sports Writer 
With a Bowl Championship Series bid now in sight, it is only fitting that Notre Dame faces a Boston Collogo squad this Saturday that has developed a knack for spoiling Notre Dame seasons. 
Most Eagle fans revel in the memory of David Gordon's 41­yard field goal that ruined Notre Dame's national title hopes in 199:{. That game still sits ou par with Doug Flutie's Hail Mary to beat Miami in 1984. On a much smaller scale, Boston College's 31~29 con­quest of the Irish last season eliminated them from bowl contm1tion and otlicially put the stamp on Notre Dame's season as a disaster. 
Saturday's matchup between 6-2 Notre Dame and 6-3 Boston College falls somewhere in between. The [rish must win their next throe games to earn a likely bid in the Fiesta or Sugar Bowl, which would be their first major bowl appear­ance since 1995. Boston Colleg,, meanwhile seoks a seventh. win that would probably ensure them a spot somewhere in the post season. 
"This week it's going to be another battle," said head coach Bob Davie. "You look at Boston College, they're 6-3. They're a good team ... They're a<; good as anyone we've played onommsc." 
A primary objective on defense for Notre Dame will be to contain the heart and soul of the Eagle offense: sophomore tailback William Green. The lcacfmg rusher in the Big East, Green has averaged 111 yards on the ground per game this season, but will be runmng into the strength of the Irish defense

in their front seven. Notre Dame has blitzed with more success this year than in 1999, and the Irish will look to the likes of Tony Driver or Ron Israel to slow the Eagle's talent­ed sophomore back. 
The bigger issue of late for Notre Dame has been pass defense. In the past three games the Irish have given up several big plays through the air that, at least in the last two, could have cost the team wins. The secondary, and especially the corners take on extra responsibility if Notre Dame brings more defenders up to stop Green. 
"It's kind of embarrassing, first of all, to give up points and yards kind of in bushels the way we've done it," Davie remarked. "The Navy game was different because we had bllSted assignments. The West Virginia game, I honestly thought we got tired. The Air Force game, I thought they made some great plays ... It's not that we're under-talented, it's not that we're snake bit, not that we're out of shape. We just got to go close to it and make some plays." 
Offensively, quarterback Matt LoVecchio will have the luxury of a running game that should thrive against a Boston College defense which ranks 92nd nationally against the run. The true freshman is 4-0 as a starter and has thrown at least two touchdown pa'ises in each of those contests. LoVecchio has displayed a good touch in throwing the deep ball, as well as the ability to scramble when the play breaks down. I laving said all that, if the Eagles are chasing Julius Jones all over the field, less will rest on the young quarterback's shoulders. 
Both teams have talent in the backfield and at the receiver positions, giving this game the potential to see saw back and forth. A key for Notre Dame will be how much their pa<;s cover­age has improved during the bye week. II' Brian St. Pierre can complete pa'ises that open up the running game, Boston · College has a cha.nee to come out of South Bond with another sea'ion-making win. However if' the Notre Dame defense is able to commit eight men lo bottling up Green, the Irish offense should pave the way to a win, and one step closer to Tempn or New Orleans.

Reaching his goals 
 O'Leary leads Notre Dame toward BCS bid 
By TIM CASEY Assisran r Sporrs Editor 
Dan O'Leary had just started playing football. I le \Vas a young te<'nagcr in the <'arly 1990s, a 6­l'oot-3 180-pound tight encl at St. Bernad!ltte's school in Ohio. During those years, he formPd many friendships, won a lot of games and created lifelong ,rn~morics. 
Including one of a tall, skinny teammate. 
"lie used to wear polo socks to practice," O'Leary said. "He just didn't lit in." 
Fast forward to Nov. 20, 1999. Notre Dame Stadium. The two classmates were now rivals, O'Leary playing al home, the polo sock-wearing kid dressed in Boston College's white, maroon and gold away uniforms. 
Chris llovan, All-Halph Lauren had transformed into Chris IJovan, AU-American. 
Hovan had also changed his football-self into a character from The Program. When O'Leary lined up and looked at the 6-foot­3 290-pound defensive end with the bla<'k and white painted face, he laughed. 
'Tm just like 'nice face, you moron,"' O'Leary said. "It was lunny." 
The big kid from Ohio's humor­ous. outgoing personality has remained intact. 
But since then, he aL'io earned a degree in sociology and computer applications, been named captain at Notre Dame, and caught the attention of NFL scouts. 
On Saturday, the fifth-year senior will raise his gold helmet to the student section for the final time, ending an unexpected career. 
'Tm glad he's getting recogni­tion as a senior," coach Bob Davie said. "lie certainly deserves it." 
Using his talents 
Growing up around Irish­Catholics, O'Leary watched Notre Dame on television every Saturday. He dreamed of playing quarterback back. But there was a problem. 
O'Leary's parents told their son to 'use his talent<; elsewhere' and described football as 'too rough of a sport.' 
They finally obliged when all of O'Leary's friends started playing at St. Bernadette's. 
"They're probably thanking their lucky stars now," O'Leary said, "[with me) saving them some money for college." 
He had always envisioned attending the local public high school but when his athletic tal­ents became obvious, O'Leary enrollr1d at St. Ignatius, a Jesuit school in Cleveland. 
The team would arrive three hours early, ,vatch film and attend mass together before play­ing in front of sell-out crowds. Every wePk. 
O'Leary lettered three times, was captain as a senior and won !'our Division 1 state titles. In

touchdown on the season 
1993, when O'Leary was a sopho­more, USA Today crowned St. Ignatius as its mythical nationai champion. He caught 46 passes in each of the next two seasons. 
"I was like a Shannon Sharpe­type," O'Leary said. "l got the ball like every other play." 
And that became a problem. O'Leary narrowed his choices to Notre Dame and Boston College, a school where the tight end rou­tinely ranked high in receptions. His idol was Pete Mitchell, the Boston College tight end who scorched the Irish in the memo­rable 1993 game. 
Lou Holtz visited in the fall of 1995 (O'Leary still has pictures of the visit in his home) and promised that O'Leary would be an integral part of the offense, that he would be a main target for quarterback Ron Powlus. On his official trip to campus in December, the Irish staff greeted O'Leary \vith a yellow sign honor­ing the great tight ends of the present and past including Pete Chryplewicz, lrv Smith, Oscar McBride, Derek Brown, Mark Bavaro, Tony Hunter, Ken MacAfee and Dave Casper. 
Also included was "O'Leary 86." 
The recruiting hype d_id not immediately sell the senior tight end. 
He waited awhile until he received advice from his parents, older sister Margie, friend Colm Carr and St. Ignatius strength and conditioning coach Marty Uinon. 
"They convinced me that even though Notre Dame hasn't been throwing the ball to tight ends in the past, that l could turn that around and make a name for myself," O'Leary said. "That was one of' the motivations that I came into Notre D4me with, just getting rid of that image that they don't throw to tight ends. I haven't completely done it so far ..." 
Lowered expectations

Eagles look for win with Hasselbeck-less offense 
By KERRY SMITH Sports Editor 
In th,~ college earners of the players that will slep on the field at Notre Dame Stadium Saturday, there has not been a rivalry more heated than the Notre" Dame-Boston College baltle. 
Even though Notre Dame bolds an 8-3 series record and enjoys a No. 11 national rank­ing, while Boston College remains unranked and strug­gling_ with the loss of its star quarterback Tim Hasselbeck, Saturday's game promises to be close if history proves cor­rect. 
"We're going to once again just focus on our perfor­'mance,''. Davie said. "I don't think motivation will be the issue this week. It's a big foot­ball game." 
Two years ago, tho Irish made a key defensive stand at lhf' goal lin<-i on the final play of' the game to hold on to a 3 I ­26 win. 
Last year, it was the Eagles' turn to soar. Despite an Irish fourth-quarter rally the Eagles hung on to :0-29 win as the sec()nds drained off the cl()ck. 
This year, a Bowl Championship Series bid remains on the line for the Irish and the Eagles arc hun­gry to tear down their over­achieving rival. 
The Eagles come to Notre Dame Stadium with a b-3 record and a new starting quarterback. 
Veteran Hasselbeck sprained his knee in the second quarter of Boston College's 31-3 win over Temple, but the Eagles have an able replacement in backup Brian St. Pierre. 
"[St. Pierre] throws the ball well. He's pretty mobile," Davie said. "We recruited hini 
St. Pierre has come in games this year, nothing seems to have clrnnged. Who knows what they'll do, but I don't see it changing very significantly." 
St. Pierre took the ma_jority of snaps during the prPseason when Hasselback was sidelined because of surgery and has played in every contest during the last two seasons. The sophomore has complf~ted 30 of 45 pass attempts for 369 yards and two touchdowns. 
While St. Pierre looks to con­tinue Ilasselbeck's record as signal caller; the rest or the Eagles' offense is preparing to ste·p up its play to take down the Irish. 
Sophomore William Green leads the Eagles on the ground, rushing for 1,005 yards and scoring 1:-l touchdowns. Wido receiver D"drick DeWalt has also made a mark for the offense with :32 receptions for 620 yards and seven touch­downs. 
Those numbers C()ncern Davie, whose defense has not performed at its peak of late. 
"It's kind of embarrassing, first of all, to give up points and yards kind of in bushels the way we've done it," Davie said. "... We can't win if we keep.. doing that. It's a con­cern. 
Boston College's defense finds its strength in free safety HaMon Johnson, who leads the team with 69 tackes. Heading the team with six sacks, defen­sive ·end Sean Guthrie will look to shut down quarterback Matt LoVecchio and the Irish offense. 
Davie knows his team will have to perform at its peak to edge the Eagles and bolster its season rncord to 7-2. 
"We've got our hands full," Irish head coach Bob Davie said. "They're a high-exf'cution team; they don't make mis­takes; they don't beat them­selves."

GAME OF THE WEEK 

By PEYTON BERG Sports Writer 
On the surface, Saturday's game between the Huskers and the Wildcats doesn't look like much. J\ closer analysis of the infamous Bowl Championship Series poll reveals that this game is critical lo the national championship race. Most observers assume that Oklahoma will play a team from Florida in the Orange Bowl for all the marbles. No. 3 Miami's grievance with No. 2 Florida State is legitimate, given the Hurricanes' 27-24 victory last month. The problem will most likely work itself out when the Seminoles host No. 5 Florida over Thanksgiving weekend. 
llow quickly people have written off the Cornhuskers. With one loss to the No. 1 team in the country, Nebraska is far from elimination. Consider the following scenario: Nebraska beats Kansas State to claim the Big 12 North title. Nebraska then beats top-ranked Oklahoma in the Big 12 Championship. The Florida/Florida State loser will have two losses and drop from the national championship picture. 
Who's left? Nebraska. 

Coach Bill Snyder hoped that Kansas State's 40-30 win over Nebraska in 1998 signaled a power shift in the Big 12. Unfortunately, the Wildcat's penchant to lose late season games has prevented them from win­ning it all. 
This year, Oklahoma's surprising dominance gave Kansas State a rare mid­season defeat aftflr reach­ing No. 2 in the polls. Characteristically, the demoralized Wildcats sub­sequenUy dropped their following game to Texas A&M and eliminated them­selves from the BCS pie· ture. 
OTHER TOP GAMES 
South Carolina at Florida: The remarkable Gamecock revival sits at 7  2, but trouble is in the air. South Carolina's SEC schedule was built for early season sur.cess, which they've enjoyed. Now, things get tougher. 
The Gamecocks· defense crar.ked last week, allowing Tennessee to drive down the field for the game-winning score_ After Florid~ this week, they'll play in-state rival Clemson. 
Florida has struggled with teams that can run the football. and USC's Derek Watson comes into Saturday's contest with a 98 yards per game average. Coach Lou Hollz still loves a ground control. time of possession style offense that he employed at Notre Dame. 
Florida also may be caught looking ahead to next week's annual Gators­Seminoles showdown. As usual, the stakes are high. Coach Steve Spurrier continues his maddening quarterback rotation, and sensational freshman receiver Jabar Gaffney is beginning to turn heads. 
Oklahoma at Texas A&M: So long as strength of schedule is a BCS factor, Oklahoma will hold its No. 1 ranking. The latest stop on the Boomer Sooner express is College Station, entertaining their fourth ranked team in five weeks. Consider that the Sooners defeated then No. 5 Texas, then No. 2 Kansas State, then No. 1 Nobraska, and now face current No. 24 Texas A&M. With apologies to the SEC, the Big 12 is this year's premier ·con­ference. Kyle Field is one of the most difficult road venues in college football. The 12th man mystique, the Corps Crazy Cadets, and coach R.C. Slocum's impressive 64-6-1 home record all add up to be what could be a thriller. 
This game will hinge on the quarter­backs: junior college transfor turned Ileisman frontrunner Josh Heupel and ex-minor leaguer Mark Farris. Given Oklahoma's confidence and lethal pass­ing attack. the Aggies must play their best game of the season in order to win. 
Nebraska is now playing with nothing to lose. Michael Vick's ankle injury means that Tim Crouch is currently the best option quarterback in the coun­try. 
Should they beat Kansas Stato, they'll get Oklahoma under pressure at a neu­tral site. 
The last time Nebraska played with nothing to lose was in last year's Fiesta Bowl, when they disfigured defending national champ Tennessee. 
lf Nebraska's defense continues to improve, look for this game to be a tune­up for a rematch with the Sooners.

IRISH INSIGHT 
Boston College fans among many who despise Notre Dame 
Acronyms and athletics go together like stupid similes and sports writing. There's the NBA, NFL, NHL, A.CC, IOC, 
USBL, CBA. AHL, AM, XFL... And the BCS. Since Glenn Earl's 
season-saving block against Air Force, conversation on campus has cen­tered on Irish chances of quality­ing for the Bowl Championship Series. 
But even for edu­cated and knowl­edgeable college football fans (rough­ly 0.237 percent of the population}, fig­uring out the BCS possibilities is tougher than dnciphering Daviespeak. 
\,\/hat's a little easier to do is mock Notre Dame. 
Fifty-five Irish haters have taken their gripes with Rockne, Rudy and religion one step further, forming an Internet­based group termed NDS.: 
Notre Dame Sucks. 
Log onto the website ( www.geocities.com/Colosseum/4028/nds. html), type your name, address and rea­son for despising the Irish and you can join this exclusive (?) fraternity. 
Members include: 
. 
Cofounder Paul "Pack-Backer" Arfmann, who writes, "Despite what the media thinks, not everyone worships the Irish; in fact, the Irish make some of us want to puke." 

. 
Paschal Dobbins, who writes, "ND is a media darling just like the unc tarholes (sic). One would get the impression that each is the greatest thing since Jesus." 

. 
fab5 (Chad], who writes, "Their fans refuse to beleive (sic) that they suck. All of Lhe!,r players are cocky. And, Michigan rulos. 

. 
B.awlin Hunter, who writes "Notre dame represents arrogant, snuLty, yankee hegemony.in its purnset (sic) form.~ 

. 
HnskrAngel, who vvrites, "Rudy was the most pathetic movie I've ever seen in my lil'e. ff I see Notre Dame on TV once mrmi T'm going to scream!" 

. 
Brian, who writes, "I think that if they werent (sic) catholic they would be equivalent to North EastBrn Montana community college for the poor and dis­ablnd.'' 

. 
Hay Baylor Bear who writes. "They ar0 vfowed by some with god-like status. Never has the image and hype been so disparate wiLh tho realiLy. I HATE EM!" 


Easy with the CAPS LOCK. Mr. 11aylor Bear. Your point is very clear. 
A suggestion for those who do not real­izP that therP exist tens of thousands ol' Hay Baylor lfoar-types: 
Look around campus this weekend as the New England Jesuits invade the Bend. 


Ask anyone dad in some mixture of brown, maroon and gold and whose B(A)C exceeds 0.10. 
Bet the phrases "cocky", "arrogant", and "loved by the media" will come up when BC fans describe their Holy Cross rivals. 
At least one person would disagree with the last word of the prior sentence. 
"BC cares deeply about Notre Dame, but Notre Dame doesn't care about BC," said Boston College coach Tom O'Brien in the Sept. 1 edition of The Boston Globe. "Maybe they will if we beat them a few more times, but right now their rival is USC." 
Prior .to the 1990s, maybe "rivalry" was a stretch. Sure, there was some controversy in 1983. 
During the third year of the Faust regime, the 6-5 Irish beat the No. 13 Eagles 19-18 in the Liberty Bowl. Prior to that game, speculation arose about · whether Notre Dame would even accept a bowl invitation following an unimpressive season. 
Some BC players thought the real rea­son why the Irish considered bypassing the bowl was because they were afraid to lose to the "other" Division 1-A Catholic school. 
But that was an isolated incident. 
Nine years later, hatred for Notre Dame grew to a new high in Beantown. And thus began a rivalry, whether O'Brien or others want to admit it. 
With his team ahead 37 -0 in the third quarter, Lou Holtz called for a fake punt that resulted in a first down. Holtz ratio­nalized the play by noting that he wanted to make sure Penn State (the next week's opponent) prepared for a fake. 
When the Eagles returned in 1993 to play the No. 1 Irish, that one play remained etched in their minds. 
"They really rubbed it in our face the year before," BC kicker David Gordon told The Observer last year. "It was a motivator. Even in the off-season, we were really preparing for them again." 
Every ND and BC fan over 13 years old knows the result. 
Mentioning Uavid Gordon to the Irish faithful is like saying Bucky Deni in front of members ofRed Sox Nation. 
"I don't think you can get any lower than we are now,'' said Irish defensive lineman Jim Flanigan aftnr the 41-39 loss. 
The next season, Notre Dame traveled to Chestnut Hill with Hon {Two lleismans) Powlus at quarterback and a No. 8 rank­ing. The Irish left the Hub with a 30-11 loss and several bruised ego&. 
Another memorabl0 game occurrnd in 1998. Dcke Cooper and the Irish defense stopped Mike Cloud four times in the clos­ing seconds of a 31-26 win. The victory prompted a. catchy nkkname, stolen from a novel written by New England native and Red Sox fan, Stephen King: The

more reason as the Eagles left with a 31­29 victory in their second visit to the expanded Stadium. 
On Saturday, the Catholic War resumes for the ninth i;traight year. 
A loss will shatter Notre Dame's BCS chances. But Irish fans will then have to come up with another interpretation of
