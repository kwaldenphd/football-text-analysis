Construction continues at a rapid pace on the North Dining Hall and the Knott and Siegfried dorms. 

Construction 'right on schedule' 
By KRISTIN SWENER­TON News Staff 
Construction on the North Dining Hall and two new wo­men's dorms are "right on schedule" according to Don Dedrick, director of the Physical Plant. 
Dedrick estimated the construction on the dining hall will be completed be­tween October 1988 and Au­gust 1989. 
The underground utilities have been installed for the dining hall and masonry work should begin in three weeks. 
Space will be increased by 500 seats, and there will be new dining areas at the north and south ends of the building. These areas can be used for private parties or other events. 
Dedrick stated, "The building is thirty years old, and we felt it was time to redo the serving areas and increase space." 
The serving lines will be remodeled to resemble those at the South Dining Hall. 
Knott and Siegfried, the new women's dorms, should be finished by June of 1988. The roofs and exterior brick­work are almost done and windows are to be installed next month. 
The approaching cold weather will not affect con­struction at all, Dedrick said. The buildings will be closed in by then, so work such as hanging doors and putting in ceilings ean be easily completed. 
The dorms are similar in design to the Pasquerillas, and will likewise hold about 250 students each. 
These two projects have been contracted to Casteel Construction, the company that built the Snite Museum and rebuilt St. Edward's Hall after after it was damaged by fire. 


Bork: My judging is non-ideological 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, denying that his judicial philos­ophy is either liberal or conser­vative, said Tuesday that judges must be dedicated to restraint and respect for dem­ocratic processes. 
The federal appeals court judge, in an opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Com­mittee considering his nomina­tion, said: 
"My philosophy of judging is neither liberal nor conserva­tive. It is simply a philosophy of judging which gives the Con­stitution a full and fair inter­pretation, but where the Con­stitution is silent leaves the policy stru~gles to Congress, tne president, legislatures and executives of the 50 states and to the American people." 
Meeting head-on some of the attacks of liberal critics, Bork said he values judicial prece­dent and singled out for special praise the 1954 Supreme Court ruling, Brown vs. Board of Education, that outlawed school segregation. 
He also said that as a Su­preme Court justice he would look differently upon past court rulings than he has done as a scholar earlier in his career. 
"It is one thing as a legal theorist to criticize the reason­ing of a prior decision, even to criticize it severely, as I have done," he said. "It is another

ND called to divest; Board of Trustees to review policy 
By KENDRA MORRILL Senior Staff Reporter 
Notre Dame will have to un­dertake a "serious review of the University's divestment policy" at the Board of Trus­tees meeting in November, ac­cording to Father Oliver Wil­liams, associate provost and member of the University's ad­hoc committee on South African investment. 
The Sullivan Principles, a set of fair-employment principles calling for total divestment if apartheid is not dismantled, have been widely followed by 
U.S. businesses and univer­sities and have guided Notre Dame's policy towards invest­ment in South Mrica. 
The principles, authored more than 10 years ago by so­cial activist Leon Sullivan, es­tablished a deadline two years ago for dismantling apartheid. 
The deadline is now past. 
In a statement on June 3, 1987, Sullivan called for all Ameri­can businesses to withdraw from South Mrica by March 

1988. 
In his statement, Sullivan said, "As of May, 1985, I stated if in 24 months statutory apar­theid was not ended ... I would call on the companies to leave South Mrica, and call for an American embargo. The condi­tions have not been remotely met." 
The University Board of Trustees has been "following (Sullivan's decision) closely, since the University's policies are tied to the Sullivan Prin­ciples," said Richard Conklin, director of public relations and information. 
The Board of Trustees will meet Nov. 13 and 14, Conklin said, and will discuss divest­ment. 
He said he would not spec­ulate on whether Sullivan's statement will influence the Board's decision. 
"There's nothing anyone can say (about whether the Board will decide to divest this time) until the November meeting," said Conklin. "Then the Board will take a look at Sullivan's policies and make a decision." 
Conklin stressed that the issue is not divestment versus non-divestment. 
"It is between our policy of selective divestment versus those who want complete and immediate divestment," Con­klin said. 
According to Peter Walshe, Notre Dame's director of Mrican Studies, in May of 1986 Notre Dame's official policy stated that it would divest if the

Europe's Ariane rocket blasted off from French Guiana Tuesday night and lifted two satellites into orbit, the rocket's first payload since it was grounded 16 months ago. A malfunction of the ignition system forced ground technicians to destroy the last Ariane rocket shortly after liftoff May 31, 1986.

Howard H. Baker Jr., White House chief of staff, was hospitalized Tuesday for tests and treatment of an intestinal problem, a White House spokesman said. The spokesman, who asked not to be identified by name, said Baker was suffering from "diverticulitis," which is defined as an inflammation of an organ or body cavity. "He was in some pain, but the prognosis is that he will be out of the hospital by tomorrow," the spokesman said. The spokesman said he did not know which hospital Baker was in.

Flirting: silly and fun but can be disappointing 
I hated him at first. 
At least that's what I told myself. 
Then the 'E-word' ... Emotions took over. 
We traded gum, shy looks and friendly jabs. 

Not an unfamiliar situation, flirting is a col­legiate occupation. . If only he knew ... and he still doesn't. 
You know the feeling: missing your chem lab because you must run into your crush --acci­dentally, of course. And God forbid if you really do. Inevitably, you'll be returning to your room, incognito, because you forgot to brush your teeth that day. 
The things we do for love: like attending two Palm Sunday masses because he wasn't at the first one, sending her flowers from 'You Know Who' (saying novenas that she will figure out who they are from because you were too chicken to sign your name), dutifully going to a Clint Eastwood triple-feature, writing his name in chalk all over campus to welcome him back, sitting up all night writing bad poetry you'll never send. Of course there are more obvious ploys, like planning a family, naming the children, drawing up blueprints and sending it via campus mail. 
But for the most part, no matter how obvious it may seem to you, it just doesn't sink in. Not even with a knowledge hammer. 
More often than not; however, it does sink in. These enlightened individuals are the best actors in the world. Innocence and cluelessness are admirable qualities, but not after you realize you've been toyed with for months of googly-eyed nothingness. 
Here comes the moment of truth ... The Con­solation Prize: "Gee, you've got a great per­sonality, terrific sense of humor and you're smart, too! BUT I'm not interested in this kind of relationship right now. It would ruin my chance to make it into the trombone section of the marching band. Maybe if I'd met you five years from now ... etc." 
Really, there was nothing to ruin. The whole thing was one-sided from the beginning, but the flirting continued because your "love olinders" tricked you into making a spectacle of yourself. 
It can get so bad that you are now avoiding the love muffin, and every song on the radio sends you into an emotional frenzy that makes Molly Dodd look like Shirley Temple. 
It stands to reason that subtlety may not be the best way to win the affections of your Adonis or Venus. Live life on the edge. Take the risk. Laugh in the face of rejection and disappoint-

Saint Mary's Editor 

ment. If you get the schlick from somebody, call it the ever popular "learning experience." 
Rationalize. One of the greatest rewards of an education is an increased awareness of the human rationale. Use it wisely. 
"It never would have worked ANYWAY be­cause: our friendship is too strong, he's from Pittsburgh and I'm from Cleveland, I would never get any of my homework done, she doesn't understand football, he's a brain and pencil-neck geek OR I'm not chopped liver and he doesn't deserve my novenas, poetry and blueprints. 
Yea, yea. Blah, blah, blah ... 
I guess all is fair in love and games, but maybe we should be a little less clueless, and take the misery out of cupid's aim. 
Fall Fever is just as contagious as Spring Fever on college campuses. It may be a con­tinuous quest for meaningful affection. 
Paul Simon puts it quite clearly, "You don't feel you could love me but I feel you could." 
Thanks for the gum, the shy looks and the friendly jabs. I guess I didn't hate you at first. 
But I do now.

Burrell talks on faithful victim 
By CELESTE FREIND News Staff 
In the first of the series of lectures entitled "Women of Faith," Father David Burrell spoke Tuesday on the diary of a Jewish holocaust victim, Etty Hillesum. 
Burrell described Etty Hil­lesum 's struggle to find meaning in her faithless and promiscuous life. He said her struggle eventually led to her transformation into a coura­geous woman with faith in God. 
Examining her book, titled "An Interrupted Life," Burrell spoke of the diary as "a pow­erful look at the transformation of a soul ... so compelling be­cause it is manifestly a work of God in a person." 
He said that Hillesum demonstrates to her readers that "the relative purpose of suffering is that we begin to un­derstand our ability to accept it." 
Burrell ended his lecture to the auidence of approximately 50 people with an open question and answer session. 

This lecture was the first in a series sponsored by the Saint Mary's Center for Spirituality. 
This series, which is open to the public, will reflect on wo­men of courage, insight, and conviction. 
The next lecture will take place Tuesday, Sept. 22 at 12: 15 
p.m. in the Stapleton Lounge of LeMans Hall at Saint Mary's College. 
The topic of next week's lecture will be Dorothy Day. 
Alcohol related deaths down 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -The num­ber of alcohol-related traffic fatalities in Indiana during the first six months of 1987 dropped 31 percent from the same per­iod a year earlier, according to figures released Tuesday by the Governor's Task Force to Reduce Drunk Driving. 
last seven years, the period for which the task force keeps sta­tistics. 
The task force also said that alcohol-related injuries in traf­fic accidents declined 4 per­cent, dropping from 3,712 in the first half of 1986 to 3,561 the first six months this year. 
Marion County Prosecutor Stephen Goldsmith, the task force chairman, said he could not explain the declines in both alcohol-related deaths and in­juries. 

Both the Indiana State Police and State Excise Police an­nounced plans earlier this year to step up enforcement efforts to keep drunken drivers off the road. 
However, those efforts were focused on the summer months, for which complete statistics are not available.

Board is sponsoring annual Fall Fest 
September 27, to Monday, September 28. 
Teams may be co-ed, and will compete for prizes, said Hashagen. 
In other business, the newly chosen Judicial Board has decided to produce a booklet which will inform students of their rights on campus, as well as in situa­tions such as off-campus party raids, and charges of drinking underage, said Hashagen. 
Also covered were plans to hold a Dorm Photo Night, using photographer Niel King of Kingshots, and the Alumnae Tailgater, which will be held this Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Haggar Terrace. 
Food and drink will be pro­vided by the alumnae asso­ciation. 
The Board had originally planned to discuss campus safety with Director of Se­curity Richard Chlebek; however, he was unable to attend.

and more serious thing altoget­her for a judge to ignore or overturn a prior decision. That requires much careful thought." 
Bork said judges who impose their own values rather than in­terpret the Constitution deprive the American people of liberty. 
In response to questions from Judiciary Committee Chair­man Joseph Biden Jr., Bork defended statements he has made criticizing an important Supreme Court ruling in 1965 that struck down a Connecticut 

law  barring  the  use  of  con­ 
traceptives even  by  married  
couples.  

Bork said he disagreed with the court's reasoning in that case creating a "free-floating right of privacy" and w~s not defending a state's right to ban contraceptives. 
Earlier Tuesday, Bork was extolled by former President Ford and others as brilliant and compassionate but was denounced by opponents as biased and close-minded as the Judiciary Committee began hearings on his nomination to the Supreme Court. 
Questions about Bork's qualifications were raised by three uncommitted members of the committee, which ap­pears to be about evenly divided on whether or not to recommend confirmation. 
However, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd repeated his intention to have the full Senate vote on the nomination. 
"I can assure that the nomination won't be killed by the Judiciary Committee, no matter how many senators vote against the nomination," he said. 
Some 350 sign-carrying, anti­Bork demonstrators rallied in a park across the street from the Senate office building where the hearings were being held.

Pope arrives in L.A., urges moral _life 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Pope John 
Paul II opened his visit Tues­
day to the world's entertain­
ment capital with an exhorta­
tion to cling to ''a responsible 
moral life" even if it means 
"being out of step with 
majority opinion." 
The notorious Los Angeles freeway traffic flowed un­usually well as a crowd esti­mated by police at 300,000 turned out to see the pope along a seven-mile motorcade that took him through Hispanic, Ja­panese, Chinese and Korean areas. 
Speaking to 6,000 young people at Universal Studios Amphitheatre, an address linked by satellite to youth gatherings in St. Louis, Denver and Portland, Ore., the pope linked suicide with spiritual emptiness. 
"Why does it sometimes hap­pen that a seemingly healthy person, successful in the eyes of the world, takes an overdose of sleeping pills and commits suicide?" the pope asked. "Why, on the other hand, do we see a seriously disabled person filled with great zest for life? 
"The one has lost all hope," he said. "In the other, hope is alive and overflowing."

The pope's motorcade ended with a prayer service at St. Vibiana's Cathedral, where the pope sounded a familiar theme -the difficulty and importance of applying morality to speech and deed in secular America, a country that has enjoyed con­stitutional guarantees of freedom for 200 years. 
The invited guests were rep­resentatives from each of Los Angeles' 284 parishes and 27 missions. 
The unwelcome guests were vagrants who normally take their meals at a mission next door to the cathedral but were moved elsewhere for the dura­tion of the papal visit. Church officials said the Secret Service and police insisted on the ac­tions for the pope's security on grounds that a terrorist might hide among the homeless.

Pope is upbeat on U.S. trip 
Associated Press 
So far Pope John Paul II is 
accentuating the positive on his 
American tour, mostly com­
plimenting the U.S. church's 
vitality and achievements 
rather than condemning its dis­
sent and divisions. 
But a harder line has been urged on the pope by some con­servative groups, and church scholars said Tuesday the pope may be holding his fire until later in his 10-day visit, which ends Saturday. 
"If he had started stumping on dissent he'd lose much ofthe appeal that he has," said the Rev. Richard R. McCormick, a University of Notre Darr.e theo­logian. 
McCormick said that al­though the pope "certainly seems to be projecting a more positive approach, . . . we have to wait and see what he has to say, and whether the up­beat mood will persevere."

"Both sides of his personal­ity, the tough disciplinarian and a kindly father, are not contradictory," said James Hitchcock, a church historian at St. Louis University. "This time, he's being the kindly fa­ther." 
What's more, Hitchcock said, "effective dealing with dissenters would less likely be done in the public forum." 
There has been tension be­tween the Vatican and some American bishops, notably over the Holy See's investiga­tion of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen and the appoint­ment of a bishop to share power with him. 
Another source of tension is a Vatican-ordered investiga­tion of religious orders. 
So far, however, the pope has been relentlessly upbeat, hailing the dedication of priests, making friends with Protestant and Eastern Or­thodox church heads, praising the involvement of blacks and Hispanics in the church. 
He has advocated strong families and marriages, decried the sufferings of the poor and blacks, praised the church's vast charitable and educational works, and stressed basic Christian values and dedication. 
He has taken up with mellow understanding touchy church questions, such as priestly celibacy and women's ordina­tion, on which most U.S. Cat­holics differ with the Vatican.

Datlng games can ea 0 rape 
By KATIE MOORE News Staff 
Fifteen percent of college men will admit that they have raped a woman, according to Marianne Martinez, a Notre Dame graduate student in psy­chology. 
Martinez spoke Tuesday at Saint Mary's Walsh Parlor in the Haggar College Center as part of the five-part lecture se­ries "No means no." 
The series addresses differ­ent aspects of sexuality, includ­ing dating games. 
The lecture on "The Dating Game" featured two Notre Dame graduate students, Mar­tinez and Michael Jenkins, and a panel of seven Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students. 
More than half of college wo­men have been a victim of sexual aggression andt>r vio­lence, Martinez said. 
One out of every three wo­men will be raped sometime in their lives. A rape occurs every two and a half minutes, she said. 
Three-fourths of rape vic­tims are between the ages of 15 and 21, according to Martinez. 
The average age is 18. 
The most common form of rape is date rape, said Mar­tinez. 
One of the reasons for these startling statistics is that the date rapists do not realize they are raping. 
Martinez said this occurs be­cause the rapist feels his ac­tions are justified. 
"We think of (rape) in the traditional sense," she said. "A girl is walking home, alone, at night, two in the morning. She walks by the bushes and some scruffy character pulls her into the bushes." 
Besides the logical precau­tion of not walking alone at night, another preventive mea­sure from rape is to stop "The Game" before it gets too out of hand.

Reports say hackers got NASA secrets 
Associated Press 
FRANKFURT, West Ger­many -Teenage hackers broke into NASA's worldwide com­puter network throughout the summer and gathered secret data on space shuttle projects and rocket failures, West Ger­man media said Tuesday. 
News reports said young West Germans gained regular access to at least 20 computers of the U.S. space agency and had the ability to paralyze the entire network. 
The ARD television network said a flaw in the network's se­curity system allowed the hackers to enter the network 
from May to September. The NASA system connects more than 1,600 computersworldwide that share informa­tiononspaceresearch,nuclear physics and molecular biology, ARD said. The network includes U.S. atomic research facilities in Los Alamos, N.M. The Hamburg-based maga­zine Stern reported similar in­

"When I saw 'Welcome to the NASA headquarters ... instal­lation' on my screen, I was a little shocked, to say the least," the magazine quoted one youth as saying. 
The Hamburg-based "Chaos Computer Club" said in a state­ment to news media Tuesday that the youths turned to the club for help when they realized the enormity of their discovery. 
The statement said the hack­ers penetrated the network to show the "unbelievable weak­nesses" of the security system and had no interest in the se­cret data. 
The reports did not say how many hackers were involved or 
where they lived. In Washington, the National AeronauticsandSpaceAdmin­istration said it was preparing a statement. Stern said the hackers, a term used for amateurs who gain access to private com­puter systems, obtained NASA memos to employees on daily space shuttle program updates and on how to deal with the

P.O. Box Q 
Notre Dame loses loyalty of Guard 
Dear Editor: 
Tradition has always been an integral part of Notre Dame. In this, the tOOth anniversary of Notre Dame football, tradition plays an even greater role, especially to all involved in the special activities on game days. Recently, with the expulsion of the seven Irish Guard veterans, an important part of that tradition has been abandoned, snuffed out by University officials. 
The Irish Guard is not merely 10 guys who lead the band, marching in skirts. The Guard consists of individuals who are carefully selected not only for their marching ability but for their spirit ­their loyalty, support and "Darner­ness." In the Oct. 17-18, 1986 Irish Extra Weekend Edition, the article "The Irish Guard, Notre Dame's Colorful Football Tradition" states, "From the moment they don their finery, these men em­body the Notre Dame spirit, and their serious expression suggests the atti­tude with which they undertake their duties." 
For 10 special students, the Irish Guard was the focal point of all the pos­itive aspects of Notre Dame. They put all their efforts into marching for their school, teaching new members the traditions of the Guard and sharing the experience of Notre Dame both on the field and off. The comraderie they share through the Irish Guard binds them to each other in great friendships that will far outlast their four years at Notre Dame. These members of the Guard were on their way to becoming the fervent alumni of the future, attend­ing every football game clad in green leprechaun pants and bellowing the fight song. The Guard of past years traditionally return to support their successors in keeping the image and tradition of the Guard. By kicking out the continuing members, the Univer­sity has lost the allegiance of some of the most valuable Domers on campus. The University has crushed their school spirit by taking away their contribution to the Notre Dame tradition. 
The seven members of the Guard who have been dismissed have lost all respect for the University because they feel they have not been treated fairly. University officials were unjustified in punishing present Guardsmen for the actions of past years. This year, the seven received no warning before being permanently dismissed for actions they had not understood as offensive. Uni­versity policy and reaction seems to vary widely from group to group on campus. 
In snatching the Irish Guard from un­derneath its continuing members, the administration snatched all of these persons' joy and devotion for Notre Dame. The three newest members, not officially dismissed, also feel disillu-
Doonesbury 
sioned and hurt by the harsh treatment of their fellow Guardsmen which has destroyed the very character of the Guard. The one freshman rookie has received an immediate negative im­pression of this university and its policies. If it continues to treat its stu­dent body in such an inconsiderate, dic­tatorial manner, the University of Notre Dame may find much of the stu­dent/alumni loyalty and pride on which it commends itself has disintee:.r:a,terf.

Fans missing at team's return 
Dear Editor: 
The student enthusiasm over our win over number nine Michigan on their home field was fantastic on our campus, as well as in Ann Arbor. Cheers could be heard coming from the dorms and this victorious feeling was carried over to the dining hall where the students proceeded to sing and cheer. Unfortunately, this is where the student support ended. 
As is often the tradition, we waited at the main circle for the team buses to return in order to demonstrate our appreciation and support for the players who led us to victory. 'i'he buses rolled down Notre Dame Avenue to be greeted by six students clapping and cheering, embarassed that we were the only students on campus that showed up to welcome home the Fighting Irish. Granted, a large number of students were returning from Ann Arbor, but it's truly disappointing that there was not a larger turn-out for the team's return. The players appeared to be rather let down as well, as they looked out the windows for supporting fans, only to find the few. Notre Dame is well known for its incredible school spirit. Let's keep this tradition alive and well by demonstrating our support for the team bath on and off the field.

Illegal parking causes havoc in D2 
Dear Editor: 
Do you own a "tank"? You know, those cars that were produced before gas prices first saw $1.00. We do, as well as others who park in D2, and it has gotten very tough to park here this year. 
For a student body that is supposed to have an excellent moral character, there really are some bad apples out there. We're talking about the six to 16 cars that are always illegally parked along the main circulation route of D2. Passing through the lot at least everyday, we have not seen one ticket grace anyone's window yet. Do these people have special priveleges? Of course there is plenty of space further back in the lot, but for these people the extra 200 feet is too far to walk; instead, drivers are forced to negotiate through a space not even wide enough for two Yugo's to pass by each other without collecting a few paint chips on their door handles. 
Wait! We've just come up with a great idea. We can have an An Tostal demolition derby with all the cars that have or have come close to hitting those over the yellow line. 
We would like to personally challenge our beloved security coordinator Rex Rakow to either paint the lines brighter and "bust" those willing to park past them or come out and say that we're free to park where we like. In that case, I'll park my '76 Impala right next to my roommates '72 Olds 98 in the lots entrance. 
To those who keep making D2 a haz­ard to cars like ours, please comply before some friends of ours, searching for their sharpest keys, become too angry after a night at Chi-Chi's. To Mr. Rakow, we would like to point out that the law is the law and if you can't solve the problem, we pray for you men (and women) in blue.

Alcohol policy is a sound document 
Dear Editor: 
I have just finished reading the Ob­server's editorial which criticizes the University's new drunk driving policy. I have also read the policy. In my mind you have misrepresented the policy to your readers. 
The primary criticism of the policy is that "the solution" it proposes "will not correct the problem." What you fail to realize is that the committee does not pretend to be offering a solution. This policy, according to the commit­tee's report, is meant to guide 'the Uni­versity in matters concerning drunk driving. Other measures have been taken, along with this policy, to help lead Notre Dame toward a solution: Fr. Malloy has established a task force; the University has recently obtained $90,000 to be used in alcohol education; and Dean Hofman has conducted an im­pressive alcohol awareness program which was mandatory for all freshmen during orientation. The policy is a small part of a larger plan. 
Your specific attacks make me wonder if you really read all of the report and the policy. For instance, you claim that students caught "off campus" are unfairly punished twice-
Garry Trudeau 

once by local authorities and then again by the University. First, there is noth­ing quite unique about the sanctions for an off campus incident. The penalties are the same for students caught driving drunk on campus: arrest reports are filed both with the state and the Office of Residence Life. Second, the University is trying to say that they are concerned about the problem of drunk driving. For them to leave it up to the local police alone would be an irresponsible neglect of the problem. 
You also complain that the "recom­mended action is presented in a nega­tive way" and that "counseling be­comes a way to punish students." Counseling is always positive. People who drive drunk have a problem and counseling can only help. 
Finally, you criticize the committee for not doing things that it should not be expected to do. It is true that they could have made recommendations for a "Designated Driver" program, but students should assume such responsi­bilities on their own. The committee is not responsible, as you assume, for the "Buzz Bus." That was a Student Gov­ernment project. And the committee should not have to offer a way "for an intoxicated student to call ... someone at the University as an alternative to get­ting behind the wheel drunk." Such op­tions have always existed. RAs and Rectors are available. And what about friends? The student may be embar­rassed-but he will arrive home alive. 
If the Observer was looking for the first thing to attack editorially, they chose the wrong victim. This new policy is a sound document which can only help prevent drunk driving at and around Notre Dame.

Dogbook decision forgets seniors 
Dear Editor: 
In regards to the cancellation of the Junior dogbook, we feel that the con­tract should not have been cancelled. We have an interest in this "dogbook" too. Seniors should have been consulted before deciding to cancel the contract. 
This updated version of the Fresh­man dogbook is ouronly joint yearbook. After spending 4 years together, we have made many friends, most of whom we will not see on a regular basis after graduation. This Junior dogbook serves as a momento for both St. Mary's and Notre Dame students since we cannot buy each other's yearbook. 
We want our Junior dogbook whether it be now, or December. Please recon­sider your decision, Senior officers.

Cartoon's racial slur inappropriate 
Featured in the September issue of Scholastic is the "Life in Hell" syndica­tion of cartoonist Matt Groening who attempts to capture the comic side of a very serious issue. The cartoon centers around a young student rebel who as a result of his academic shortcomings, is subjected to a barrage of psychological and physical abuse 
Cheryl Ann Leslie 
guest column 
levied upon him by a succession of teachers as he progresses or rather regresses through grammar and high school. What made the cartoon so humorous was the fact that the gripes and punishments employed by the teachers of our young rebel were al­most identical to those which many of us remember from days of old. 
Humorous that is until our young rebel reaches eighth grade and the cap­tion shows his teacher warning him that life will not be so merry when he reaches high school where he will encounter "gangs, drug pushers and Negroes." 
My initial reaction to this obvious ra­cial slur which dared to put blacks into the same context as criminals was ex­treme hurt and indignation. The fact that several people put blacks into such context mentally is a part of life. But to see it in print in a student publication here at Notre Dame is an outrage. The printing of such a passage was a slap in the face showing that not only the cartoonist but the editors of Scholastic have no consideration for the segment of the population which is highly offen­ded by the caption or the rest of the student body who should find it embar­rassing and demeaning to the Univer­sity as a whole. 
Unlike our young student rebel in the cartoon, I attended a predominantly black grammar as well as high school. Ironically, our teachers also instilled into our student body a perception of the students we would encounter in our quest for higher education. Unlike the teacher featured in the cartoon who chose to associate blacks with criminals our teachers referred to stu­dents whose race and backgrounds dif­fered from our own as bright, motivated, open-minded and a good source to facilitate an exchange of knowledge and culture. In other words they were much like ourselves. I wonder what these same teachers will think when they receive a copy of this issue of Scholastic. The adjectives which come to my mind are insensitive, crude and tasteless. 
From Matt Groening, the witty car­toonist who lays claim to the passage, I think that a sincere apology is in or­der. Surely the teachers of our young rebel also warned him about the con­sequences of insensitivity and a lack of good taste. Only the very immature could find such a passage "humorous." 
And to the editors of Scholastic I must ask, "If such offensive material is per­mitted publication; exactly what type of material is it that you choose to edit?" Publishing material such as that found in Mr. Groening's cartoon is a bad sense of judgment and a complete disregard of your obligations to the stu­dent body whose voice you claim to rep­resent. From you also an apology is in order to the student body and everyone else who was subjected to reading such tasteless material in our magazine:

Papal visit needs the support of all 
A visit of the Pope, the vicar of Christ and the visible head of the of the mysti­cal body of Christ on earth, is no small occasion. With John Paul II's second pastoral trip to this country, it is time for all of us to pause and consider how we can best take advantage of the visit, and how we can support the Pope in his mission. 
Thomas D'Andrea 
guest column 
The theme of this visit is "Unity in the Work of Service," and the words of Jesus Christ recorded by St. John at the Last Supper spring to mind: "That they may be one Father, even as you and I are one." 1,954 years after the first Pen­tecost we must ask ourselves, how is this unity Christ wanted for us? Were we each to make some concrete resolu­tion to strengthen unity in the one, holy, Catholic and apostolic Church and to pray more, much more, and much more insistently, for that unity, we would make a great contribution to the success of the Papal visit. 
But the problem is that many of us are apathetic and indifferent. Our hearts perhaps are not in the right place and our priorities may be a bit inverted. A visit from the Holy Father fills us perhaps with more curiosity than en­thusiasm. He is a nice guy, a skillful politician and diplomat, a VIP. Perhaps we harbor a vague wish that his trip be a success, that he avoid unpleasant encounters with the media or the dissi­dent groups of one stripe or another that hope to confront him and relish the notoriety to be had from harassing a man of the Pope's position and stature. Maybe those of us with more acute theological sensibilities hope the Pope straightens out the Catholic Church in the United States, that he lays down the law and reproves the all too many members of the Church, clerics and laity, theologians and non-theologians alike, who openly reject Church teach­ing. We delight in this prospect of a tidied ship, but the thought of uniting ourselves to the Pope on his visit by sacrifice and intense prayer for unity does not occur to us. Chances are, foot­ball games, social events, classes, and other such things, excellent in them­
selves, have the best of our attention. The Pope's visit interests us, but not nearly enough for us to do anything about it. And are we honest with our­selves about this? 
The United States Catholic Confer­ence has written and widely distributed a "Prayer to Prepare for the Visit of John Paul II." Perhaps the most signif­icant petition in the prayer is: "May we also become signs of reconciliation in the world and builders of unity in the Church." How can we do this? Most of us probably remember the cover of Time magazine on January 9, 1984. It had a picture of Pope John Paul II with his arm around his assailant Mehmet Alii Agca. With his right hand, the Pope was holding the hand of Agca's that pulled the trigger. The caption read: "Why forgive?" This indeed was a sign of reconciliation in the world. The story went on to explain how the Holy Father had given "a lesson in forgiveness for a troubled world." In glowing phrases such as "an extraordinary moment of grace," "(a) startling drama of for­giveness and reconciliation," "difficult to imagine a more perfect economy of drama", the journalists recorded this remarkable act of John Paul II. He turned the other cheek, befriended his enemy, and forgave without hesitation. 
As we recall this let us ask ourselves who the true signs of reconciliation and builders of unity are: is it John Paul II who has tirelessly expended himself in his effort to preserve the members of the Catholic Church in their faith and in unity with the Church of All Ages, or the self-styled "Pope-bashers" who never miss an opportunity, it seems, to treat the Church and Her leadership as if it were just another human institu­tion? 
We can build Church unity, and in so doing promote peace and unity in a very broken world, by adhering to Papal au­thority; we too can be signs of recon­ciliation by praying unceasingly that all members of the Church, and those people of good will to whom the Church forever has its arms open, follow the guidance and the leadership of the Holy Father. 
George Will wrote an interesting column several years ago in Newsweek on the Pope and authority in the Cath­olic Church. It was noteworthy of its clear-minded common sense and of added significance because Will is not a member of the Roman Catholic Faith. In the column, Will underscored the need for any functioning and lasting in­stitution to have a common core of con­victions and an authoritative body to preserve these convictions, nurture and defend them. Said Will: "There must be a point at which private judgment by any member of the community is circumscribed by institutional judg­ment. And some person or body ...must decide where this points are." Yes, the Church is an institution, an institution both divine and human, but an institu­tion nonetheless. The endless divisions that have characterized Protestantism since its inception and must be a source of discouragement for anyone looking 
at  Christianity from  the outside  are  
well-known.  And  today  within  the  
Roman  Catholic  Church  there  are  

forces at work seeking to undermine Papal authority and Church unity--not a new story, but something that must remain for us a matter of great con­cern. Masquerading as intellectuals of great and profound learning, these in­dividuals are quick to claim for them­selves precisely what they deny the Pope. During the Hans Kung contro­versy several years ago, there was a joke circulating in Rome that Pope Paul VI was apparently not aware of. The joke related that as a way of resolv­ing the controversy between Kung and the teaching authority of the Church, Kung was offered the Papacy. He refused instantly and replied, with great candor: "No thanks, I'd rather keep infallibility." 
Our faith in the guidance of the Holy Father is not a faith in human wisdon but in faith in work of the Holy Spirit: " What you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven." We members of the Roman Catholic Church do not accept the Pope's authority because he is a smart man, a scholar, or an intellectual admired by the media. We submit to the Pope's guidance because as the des­cendent of St. Peter, first Vicar of Christ, he has the "keys of the kingdom" and a judgment pertaining to matters of faith and morals which is assisted by the Holy Spirit in a manner no other member of the Church can claim (as Lumen Gentium makes clear, see n.22). Unity with the Pope is unity with the Holy Spirit. We stray from his guidance at our own risk and we must beware the pride that would keep us from submitting to his divinely entrusted authority and would obscure our sense of the very genuine need for authority within the institution of the Church. 
Let the "experts," "authoritative commentators," and dissident groups sow seeds of discord. Let us support the Pope in his visit while we pray for those who would rather see it fail and whose intentions we cannot judge. In the meanwhile we can also turn to the Blessed Mother, Mother of the Church, in this Marian Year and pray that she intercedes for us to obtain that which the Church and the world so desperately need. 
So the Pope is coming. A rosary of­fered up for the Pope's intentions, a visit to the Grotto to pray for Church unity, even a bit of fasting--it is the very least we can do as members of the Church ... if our hearts are in the right place.

T
he Radiation Laboratory Is perhaps the most mysteri­ous construction on campus. We've all seen It and wondered, "What goes on In there?" or, "Is It true that students go In there to do research and never return?" or perhaps, "Does It glow at night?" 
Answers to tough questions like these were given by the assistant director of the lab, Dr. John Bentley. Having been the assistant director for the past three years and on the lab faculty for over six years, Dr. Bentley Is very famllar with the lab and seemed eager to an­swer any questions concerning the lab and Its operations. 
The lab Itself, althougn mys­terious from the outside, ap­pears normal from the Inside. It holds the usual amount of offices, desks, and rooms full of scientific equipment that one might expect to find In a sci­ence laboratory building. In 
Attacking anxiety 
A look inside the Radiation Lab 
the lab are the same as those that might exist In a chemistry lab, because the very nature of the research Implies that some "dangerous experiments" will take place. However, the ex­periments hold well-known dangers and are conducted under so many controls and safeguards that real dangers to the public are negligible. 
As for those questions about whether or not the place glows In the dark. no experiments Involving radiation have taken place In several years. The only radioactive sources are kept well underground, stored, se­cured, and safely contained. I observed them myself when Bentley took me on a tour, and I haven't begun to radiate yet. so they must be fairly safe. 
Most Importantly, none of the ten graduate students working there has disappeared yet. ac­cording to Bentley, and the undergraduate student working for the director Is seemingly 
alive and weli. Unfortunately, our photographer still hasn't come back.... 

sense that something is about 
to go horribly wrong, or it's the 
horrible, gnawing feeling that 
invades your body and mind 
when you realize that someth­
Ing has already gone horribly 
wrong and it's way too late to 
blame It on someone else. It 
may also be a combination of 
those two or maybe something 
completely different. Thinking 
about It fills me with anxiety so 
we'll give that up. 
To make matters more com­
plicated, there are several dif­
ferent kinds of anxiety. The 
first type we'll label Type A anx­
Iety. Type A anxiety occurs 
when you're absolutely sure 
that you've botched something 
In a big way and It's all over.

choices. 

Choice One: Run like hell. Whoever said that running from your problems didn't solve them was wrong. Running away from parents, professors, l~w officers and friends at high speed Is an excellent way to confuse the issue and gain valuable time. So the next time you are suddenly faced with the ugly results of your own stupidity, pig-headedness, just­plain-obnoxiousness, etc., turn and runl If you stand there you will be held accountable, and there Is always someone more accountable, even if they don't know It yet. Running Is good for you, too. 
Choice Two: Lie. If the most 
powerful men in our govern­
ment can do it, why can't you? 
Start off telling little white lies 
to friends and family ("Heck 
no, I'd never spill Coke on your 
CD player" and "No, seriously, 
you look great today!"). This 
will enable you to master the 
facial expressions and whiny 
voice of the experienced liar. 
Later, when you really mess 
something up, you will be able 
to tell the big lies (I can 
honestly say that I never 
received a Mercedes OR a large 
cash bonus to play football for 
SMU..."). 
Choice Three: Drink. Many people believe, and it's been tested again and again, that being totally unaware of your surroundings, your situation, or even your name Is an excel­lent way to relax and forget your anxieties and problems. Other, smaller-minded people refer to this process simply as "passing out" but those people 
just aren't very Imaginative. 
Choice Four: Take Hostages. This seems to be the hip thing to do when faced with a big problem. Round up the closest thirty or forty innocent bystanders and demand that your "D" be changed to an "A minus" or you will force each

room, glancing at all the tubes, 
computer screens, lasers, and 
Van de Graff generators, only 
three words came to mind: 
typical science laboratory. 
Working under a $.3.5 million annual budget. the Radiation Lab does what Bentley calls "pure research." Since the Uni­versity operates the lab under contract with the Department of Energy, which supplies all of the lab's funds, It Is required to ensure that the lab does only certain kinds of research to further energy conservation. As Bentley expressed It the lab conducts "studies of chemical reactions when energy is dis­sipated In a hurry" under various conditions. However, under this broad spectrum, researchers are free to pick and choose experiments. 
With regard to supposed dangers in the lab or possible hazards to the outside populace, Bentley reports that there Is very little, If anything, to worry about. Any hazards in 

Y
es, welcome again to "Al­tered", the column with the rich, full-bodied taste of stupidity but only half the calories. This week's subject is the early adulthood anxiety at­tack. Anxiety Is kind of hard to define. It's either the horrible, gnawing feeling that invades your body and mind when you An example of this would be sleeping through a test wreck­ing your roommate's car, throwing up in front of your rector or saving Michigan tick­ets for your friends. This type of anxiety never lasts long be­cause there's no suspense. Your life is over and you are left with a few well-defined

and every one of your hostages to watch "Different Strokes" reruns, causing all of them per­manent brain damage. 
Type B anxiety is much more complicated, because the cause of the anxiety is com­pletely unknown. You are sure that something, somewhere is going to go wrong at any min­ute, but you don't have the slightest idea why or when. This feeling often occurs at off-campus parties where you might be attacked by vicious police dogs, shot at by trigger­happy neighbors or forced to drink enough Old Milwaukee to ruin your kidneys for life. Then again, you might have a great time. Unfortunately you don't know till you go. 
Extreme Type B anxiety oc­curs when you wake up with the feeling that something is wrong, but you can't put your finger on it. This is called "floating anxiety" because I like the way that sounds. If you wake up with a feeling of float­ing anxiety, your best option is to get back under your covers and scream for help. If this is impossible, call Psych Services and sing "La Bamba" into the phone at the top of your lungs. This should qualify you for some time off from school or at least some interesting medication. 
Floating anxiety is often 
accompanied by questions like "What am I going to do with my life?", "Am I dumb or just lazy?" and the ever-popular "Huh? What?". Don't try to an­swer these questions. Thinking about the hundreds of choices to be made and the definite possibility that you might end up working at a car wash is bound to make you even more anxious. If floating anxiety per· sists for longer than a month, begin talking to yourself, roll your eyes and wander through the streets of South Bend drooling on passers-by. This Is called "going nuts" or "acting like a fruitcake." The last type of anxiety, Type C, is directed at threats that you understand but can do nothing about, such as the threat of nuclear war, fatal Ill­ness or your roommate's smelly feet. Realizing that we live In a world much larger than ourselves, with problems we can only surmount with the help of the entire human com­munity, will take you a long way towards understanding and controlling Type C anxiety. Re­alizing that I know nothing about Pychology would prob­
,
ably be even more helpful. 
What? It's time for my medication? Again? But doc. This is Kris Murphy signing off from the anxiety ward at Notre Dame Psych Services. . . .

Cards win, maintain lead 
Hernandez hits milestone, leads Mets over Cubs 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Keith Hernan­dez reached the 2,000-hit plateau with three hits and Sid Fernandez and two relievers combined to pitch a seven­hitter as the New York Mets beat the Chicago Cubs 12-4 Tuesday night. 
The Mets used a pair of five­run innings, the sixth and eighth, to bury the Cubs and remain 1 112 games behind the front-running St. Louis Car­dinals in the National League East. 
After Hernandez got his 2,000th hit with a single in the eighth, he was forced to leave the game when he injured him­self while rounding third. Barry Lyons had a three-run homer as the Mets pulled away with their five-run eighth. 
Fernandez, 11-8, who pitched five innings, won for the first time in five starts. 
Terry Leach and Roger McDowell finished up with McDowell giving up three runs in the ninth. 
Greg Maddux, 6-12, lost his fourth consecutive decision and third in as many starts against the Mets. 
White Sox 6, Twins 2 
CHICAGO -Rookie right­hander Jack McDowell, making his major league debut, got hitting support from Donnie Hill and Harold Baines to pitch the Chicago White to a 6-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins Tuesday night. 
McDowell became the first White Sox pitcher to win his major league debut since Joel Davis beat Milwaukee on Aug. 11, 1985. The 21-year-old McDowell, the team's top draft choice this past June, gave up just four hits in seven innings and did not walk a batter in out­dueling 42-year-old Joe Niekro. 
Pirates 5, Expos 1 
PITTSBURGH Mike 
Bielecki pitched 6 113 perfect in­
nings and finished with a three­
hitter as the Pittsburgh Pirates 
beat the Montreal Expos 5-1 
Tuesday night. Bielecki retired the first 19 batters he faced before Mitch Webster lined a double down the left field line. Bielecki, 2-2, did not walk a batter and struck out six, allowing the Expos their only run when third baseman Bobby Bonilla made a two-out throwing error in the ninth. 

Yankees 4, Brewers 3 
NEW YORK -Rickey Hen­derson's home run triggered a three-run fourth inning and left-bander Al Leiter won his first major league start Tues­day night as the New York Yankees edged the Milwaukee Brewers 4-3. 
Leiter, 1-0, allowed a first­inning run on Greg Brock's RBI single. But he held the Brewers to only four hits and four walks while striking out eight over the first six innings. ­
Henderson's 14th homer started a string of five straight hits off Brewers starter Juan Nieves, 12-7, in the fourth as the Yankees moved back into third place in the American League East, one-half game ahead of the Brewers. 
After Henderson tied the score, Willie Randolph and Don Mattingly singled to put run­ners at first and third before Dave Winfield and Gary Ward followed with RBI singles to knock Nieves out of the game. Willie Randolph's bases-loaded groundout in the seventh off Mark Knudson scored the even­tual winning run.

When Chicago Catholic League rivals St. Laurence and St. Rita faced each other in the 1985 Illinois football state semi­finals, it looked as though it might resemble a future Blue­Gold game. 
St. Rita had John Foley, Jason Cegielski and John Zaleski on its side. All signed with the Irish the following spring. So did St. Laurence stalwarts Paul Glonek, Tim Grunhard, Mike Harrison, Stan Smagala and Jeff Pearson. 
"Originally, I was going to go to Michigan, Tim was going to go to South Carolina, and Stan's scholarship was up in the air with the (Lou) Holtz­(Gerry) Faust coaching switch," said Pearson, "and just by chance we all decided in the last week before signing day. 
"I liked the national expo­sure Notre Dame gets on tele­vision, and Lou Holtz coming here was a big factor. Also, coming from the Chicago Cath­olic League, it's kind of a dream to come to Notre

For many of the signees, this dream did not come completely true. Cegielski and Zaleski were dismissed from the Uni­versity after a year for aca­demic reasons. From Pear-son's team, which was ranked among the top five in the nation before losing to St. Rita, Glonek is now at the University of Iowa, and Harrison is sitting out this year with appendicitis. 
But Pearson, a USA Today and Parade high school All-American and one of the more celebrated recruits, has over­come difficulties in his fresh­man year to find a starting spot at right guard this season. 
"Last year, I was still on the high school level," said the 6-2, 250-pound offensive guard._ You've got to do a lot of things on your own that you didn't do in high school. This year I'm doing more on my own, like watching the films and working with my position coach. I'm doing more of the extras and getting more mentally dis­ciplined." 
Pearson's chances of start­ing in his sophomore year did not appear so bright last spring, when the University sus ended him from spring practice for disciplinary reasons. But he used the time to do individual work that helped him prepare for fall pratices. 
Jeff Pearson 
"It was a disadvantage be­cause I missed a lot on the field, but I was able to concentrate more in the weight room and on my speed," Pearson said. "It gave me a chance to im­prove physically." 
Pearson then impressed coaches enough to earn the only available starting slot on the of­fensive line, the right guard po­sition vacated by Shawn Ref-fern. 
"I knew I had a lot of things against me because I missed spring," said Pearson, "but he (Holtz) told me the spot was open, so I had confidence in myself. I knew if I did the job, Coach Holtz would be fair. If I was good enough, he wouldn't keep me from playing just be­cause I missed spring." 
According to offensive line coach Tony Yelovich, Pear-son's work over the fall par­tially made up for his missing spring practice. 
"He was behind becuse of the time he missed, but with hard work he made up a lot," said Yelovich. "He worked hard over the summer, and he made up for some of the time." 
Pearson had his first starting 
assignment last Saturday at Michigan, as the lone starting underclassman on an offensive line that includes four fifth­year seniors. At right guard, he also was playing between ceo­ter Chuck Lanza and right tackle Byron Spruell, the 1987 Irish co-captains. 
"Coach Yelovich worked really hard with us, and we were really prepared for the Michigan defense," Pearson said. "Byron and Chuck helped 
Yelovich felt that playing be­tween Lanza and Spruell and working diligently during fall practice made Pearson's start­ing debut a success. 
"He's adapted very well, and there's good communication between the two men on both sides of him," Yelovich said. "You could see how hard he worked and how hard the rest of the linemen worked. You work hard on the practice field, so when it's game time it's fun time." 
Pearson was not always playing next to Lanza and Spruell on the line last Satur­day. High school teammate Grunhard spent much time in place of Lanza at center, playing next to Pearson just as he did at St. Laurence -when Grunhard was a guard and Pearson was a tackle. And last weekend's Irish defense in­cluded St. Laurence grad Smagala starting at right cor­nerback and Foley of St. Rita filling in at linebacker. 
It was not a situation that particularly surprised Pear­son. He is hoping that he, Grun­hard and Harrison can all make an impact on the Notre Dame offensive line in the next few years. It could be similar to the 1985 St. Laurence line that had Harrison, Grunhard and Pearson playing next to each other. 
"I know Tim's going to play a lot for us. He's definitely going to help us a lot this year,'' said Pearson. "If Harrison comes back from his injury, he's a good player, and he'll make a good contribution." 
It could make for one inter­esting high school reunion.

ND soccer's LaVigne brothers 
Double trouble for opponents 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame soccer team has had its opponents seeing double this season. 
The twin brother combina­tion of freshmen Steve and Paul LaVigne has arrived to add its talents to the team. 
The St. Louis natives turned down offers from several pres­tigious soccer programs, in­cluding Indiana, Richmond, Wake Forest and Miami of Ohio. 
They opted instead to follow the path of family tradition that had led their father and uncle to Notre Dame. In addition, Irish captain John Guignon and assistant coach Joe Schmid both attended the LaVigne's high school. 
First glance and past history may lead a casual observer to assume that Paul and Steve are merely carbon copies of each other. But further investigation reveals that their personalities are not as identical as their looks. 
"They are very contrasting in personality and play," said Irish head coach Dennis Grace, "Paul is a real free-spirit that to help each other improve by pointing out mistakes and of­fering advice. 

"He'll always tell me what I am doing wrong during the game," said Paul of his bro­ther, "he can be honest because he doesn't have to worry about hurting my feelings." 
Steve echoed these senti­ments saying that "Paul is al­ways on my back when I am not hustling." 
Despite the years of working together, the two rarely com­bine forces. Each attacks the game from a different perspec­tive. 
"Steve's got a lot of com­posure," said Grace. "He's very hard to knock off the ball and is strong on offense and defense." 
Paul, however does not share the same level-headed concen­tration and rather casual demeanor of his brother and seems to prefer a style of reck­less abandon over finesse. 
"He gets on that field and he just turns from Dr. Jekyl to Mr. Hyde," said Grace, "he has little respect for his body or his opponent's body." 
It is this transition to the more physical aspects of col­lege soccer that has been their major focus for improvement, as well as the reason Paul will be forced to sit out of this Friday's game against Mic­higan State. 
Aggressive marking in Sun­day's victory over Indiana earned Paul a red card and a one game suspension for his ac­tions. 
Still, the adjustment to the level of college play has been a smooth one and both insist that the attitude of their team­mates and the warm welcome they received have been the keys. 
"The people on the team have been great," said Steve. "They've accepted us from the beginning and that really makes me want to work hard and be a determining factor in the the wins." 
And if Steve and Paul con­tinue at their current pace, they should prove to be what Grace considers his "double jackpot." 
"They have outstanding po­tential," said Grace. "We believe in attitude and charac­ter, not characters, and they are bright kids that are going to be a positive force.'' 
Irish wingback Paul LaVIgne (23) works for an advantage against the Hoosiers. 
plays a hard-nosed game while Steve is very quiet and laid­back and gets the job done with finesse." 
But different personalities have not stopped the two from pursuing similar goals which inevitably caused their paths to be intertwined. 
A trip to their dorm room shows the evidence of their soc­cer careers that have become permanently merged into one since the day they first stepped foot on the soccer field in kin­dergarten, 13 years ago. 
"We never worried about a rivalry," said Paul, "When one of us does something good it reflects on both of us, so we act more like a team than individ­uals." 
Limiting the competition to their opponents and con­centrating instead on them­selves as a team with a com­mon goal have allowed the two

Irish football back in the high life 
"Hail to the victors ... " 

Last year at this time I hated the Michigan fight song. Today I still don't like it, but it does bring a smile to my face. 
Because this time, the Irish are the victors. After a 20-12 loss to Michigan in the first game of 1985 and last season's heartbreaking 24-23 defeat in Lou Holtz' first game as head coach, Saturday's 26-7 win was particularly sweet. 
Add to that the drama of a season opener, a bro­ken 18-game unbeaten streak for Wolverine head coach Bo Schembechler in home openers, a 1-0 record for the Irish, the convincing manner of the Notre Dame victory and the proximity of Ann Arbor for road-tripping, and this was an unforgettable weekend for Irish football fans. 
"Did you go?" seemed to be the most frequently asked question on Monday afternoon, and "yes" seemed to be the reply more often than not. Hundreds of Domers made the 4-hour drive north to the University of Michigan, either to be one of the 106,098 inside Michigan Stadium or one of the rowdies filling Ann Arbor bars. 
I was one of the rowdies. Well, not too rowdy (Mom and Dad get a subscription to the Observer). Exhibiting fiscal soundness and wanting to sit with ND fans rather than in a random seat probably next to Wolverine lovers, I chose to watch the game with my friends in a place called Dooley's instead of buying a scalped ticket. 
The atmosphere was nothing short of electric. Du Lac and its spirit were nowhere to be found, al-

though a ~opy of Friday's Irish Extra did appear out of the blue. 
Once the game began, it was evident that the crowd at Dooley's was overwhelmingly for Notre Dame. The regulars must have taken notice Friday night when Irish fans staged an impromptu pep rally on Maynard Street outside the bar, announcing that Notre Dame football was back in the high life again. 
That proclamation by Notre Dame fans was proven across town on Saturday afternoon by the Irish football team. Tests, SYRs and the pennant races were tossed aside, if only for a few hours, in favor of witnessing one of the best football wins in recent seasons. 
Flashback. 
Notre Dame cornerback Stan Smagala drills Wol­verine quarterback Demetrius "It was a lot easier in practice" Brown as he releases the ball, setting up an Irish interception and subsequent field goal. 
The offensive line gives Irish QB Terry Andrysiak enough time to sing the alma mater before he finds Tim Brown in the end zone for a quick 10-0 lead. The Dooley's crowd roared for the play and all three replays. 
I don't know how Tim Brown caught that football, but it sure would look good on a Heisman highlight film if he can overcome the double and triple­coverage that opposing teams will undoubtedly throw at him this season. 
After those two big plays, the Irish never looked back. Michigan's miscues and Notre Dame's poise and pressure added up to victory number one. 
Undefeated! 1-0! The last time that happened was 1983 when the Irish crushed Purdue, 52-6. Way back then (think hard), Blair Kiel was throwing to Mark
