For USC game 
Restrictions have been placed on the displaying of banners on the football field. Banners will be allowed on the field at halftime, but the persons displaying the banner must adhere to the following guidelines set up by the Student Union: 
1) Anyone who wishes to display a banner on the field at halftime must bring the banner to the SU Social Commissioner's office be­tween 1 pm and 5 pm today and tomorrow, or between 10 am and 11 am on Saturday. 
2) At this time the SU will issue the student a receipt. 
3) The SU will transport the banners to the stadium where they may be claimed inside Gate 15 
Openings 

Due to last minute cancellations, there are three opening available for the Senior Oass Trip to San Francisco. Any interested senior should contact Teri at 7308. 
Correction 

The Sarin pep rally will begin at 10 p.m. tonight, not at 7 p.m. as reported in yesterday's Observer. 
The rally will be held in front of Sarin and will feature a number of speakers including: Digger Phelps, Coach Yonto, Officer Tim Me· Carthy, Ken MacAfee, Ted Berg­meir and Scott Zettek. 
Clarification 
Dave Bender, student body pres­ident, stated that he is not against the Dancin' Irish and never made the statment concerning them to Sandy Stohrer, Dancin' Irish co­captain, which appeared in yester­day's Observer. 
Stohrer was quoted as saying "Bender was totally against it. He wouldn't go for it so he said he couldn't help us."

The date of this forum will be announc­ed sometime after October break. 
"The Senior Fellow should be a person that all the seniors are proud to consider as an honorary member of their class," remark­ed Naquin. She added that all of the members of the Committee are very enthusi.astic. "I hope this

Lecturer focuses on consumers 
by Stephen Needles 
"The Consumer Society" was the subject presented yesterday afternoon by Paul Foley as a part of the College of Business' continuing series of guest lecturers. Foley is the chairman and chief executive officer of the Inter-Public Group of Companies, the largest world-wide advertising corporation. 
Although the lecture was origin­ally entitled "The Consumer Take­over," Foley quickly clarified the fact that his speech was actually concerned with the consumer soc­iety. Our present society, he said, is characterized by freedom of choice in lifestyle, business and government. Foley described our society as "entrepreneurial" and as a "society of expectation," one which gives high priority to educa­tion and other important institu­tions. Furthermore, he stated that the consumer society is definitely on the rise as evidenced by the fact that consumer purchases now make up over 65% of the Gross National Product of the United States. 
In the latter half of his speech, Foley focused on advertising, a subject he has had close contact with. "Since most purchases nowadays involve the movement of the consumer to the product, credibility is of the essence,'' he said. ''Honest advertising is the only kind which will survive over time. Lose the consumer, and you lose the whole ball game."

Senior Oass Fellow Nominations will open at 11 a.m. Tuesday, Nov. 1, according to Senior Class Fellow Committee Chairman Elizabeth Naquin. Boxes and nominations forms will be located in both the North and South Dining Halls, the Huddle and also at the front door of the Senior Bar. 
The Senior Fellow Award has been a tradition at Notre Dame since 1969. It is an honor which the senior class bestows upon an individual who has performed sig­nificantly in his or her field. Previous Senior Fellows include Senator Eugene McCarthy, Rev. Robert Griffin, Ara Parseghian, and last year's Fellow, Garry B. Trudeau. 
Any senior can nominate a person for this award. All that is required is that when nominating a candidate, the senior places his name and ID number on the form, as well as the name and field of the person that he is nominating. 
The criteria for the selection of this year's Fellow was determined at a Committee meeting held last night in the basement of Walsh Hall. At this meeting it was decided that the individual must have accomplished something sig­nificant in his or her field. Each nominee's lifestyle and accomp­lishments should embody the "spi­rit'' of the Notre Dame Class of 1978. Personal qualities which will be highly regarded are integrity, leadership and creativity. Enthu­siasm and personality are also important characteristics which will be considered. 
Traditionally, the Senior Fellow has visited Notre Dame sometime during the spring semester. This

Social space proposal 
fcontinued from page 17] 
Hickey Company consultants es­timated that the cost of construct­ing a total of 20 additional res~ idence rooms in Holy Cross, util­izing some of the hall's lounge space, would be approximately $62,500. This would make room for 48 incoming freshmen, and allow other dormitories to construct 
lounges as well. Additional rooms, 
the plan stated, could also be 
constructed in Carrol Hall. 
"We're talking about a long term proposal," Gill said. "The money being asked for Holy Cross and other dorms in not that great and these are permanent ad­ditions.'' 
A second part of the proposal iSked for the establishment of a commission ''to examine the pres­ent use of residence space at Notre Dame.'' The commission would be composed of representatives from the Office of student Affairs, Business Affairs, Housing and the student government. 
The commission's primary re­sponsibility would be "to check for efficiency in the allocation of space in resident rooms and make-ap­propriate recommendations to the University." The proposal cited residen'-.! rooms in Holy Cross which are used for storage space and large rooms in other dorms which could "accomodate more residents than at rpesent. '' 
Also submitted to the Board for 
its consideration was a plan by the 
Student Union to "revitalize" La 
Fortune Sudent Center. Bro. Just 
Paczesny, vice-president for Stu­
dent Affairs, brought up the pro­
posal before the University Trus­
tees. 
In light of the social space 
problem on campus, the Student 
Union suggested extending La 
Fortune's hours from 2 to 4 am on 
weekends. This would allow for 
use of the Student Center after 
parietal hours. 
The total package, requiring $6,318 in initial funding, would make available a copy machine and a six foot viewing screen for television of video-cassettet broad­casts.

The commentators argued that the CLC should be approved, but only as a subcommittee ofthe SLC. They felt the disappearance of the SLC would be narmful to student in­terests. The trustees made no comment on the proposal when it was presented last spring and have not given any public indication of how their decision will go this weekend. Nonetheless, sources within stu­dent government have been quoted as predicting the acceptance of the proposal.

Moves against blacks 
S. Africa cracks down 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
[AP] -In a massive predawn 
crackdown, South Africa's white 
rulers yesterday banned virtually 
every major black organization in 
the country, closed its two principal 
black newspapers and detained at 
least SO prominent blacks. 
Striking nationwide, security po­
lice also slapped restriction orders 
on six whites and raided the offices 
and homes of black leaders, move­
ments and church bodies. 
"This is the limit," declared 
Thamsanqe Jambule, a high school 
headmaster in the vast Soweto 
black township south of Johannes­
burg. "I think we are fast moving 
toward a climax.'' 
The crackdown, the toughest in this white-ruled nation since the early 1960's, came amid mounting attacks on the government over the Sept. 12 prison death of Steve Biko, a major South African black nation­alist activist. 
Justice Minister James T. Krug­er said that the government was moving against organizations, new· spapers and people being used to create a "revolutionary climate" and a black-white confrontation. 
He said those detained in the raids would be held in ''preventive detention" until the situation has "returned to normal.' 
Warning of even tougher mea-, sures, Kruger said: ''The govern ment is determined to ensure that the peaceful coexistence of peoples in South Africa is not disturbed by a small group of anarchists." 
The government measures pro­voked an immediate outcry from blacks and liberal whites and raised fears of a violent backlash.

Committee links students, SAGA 
by Joan Grabowski 
The St. Mary's Food Committee, 
a communication link between the 
student body and SMC food ser­
vice, (SAGA), is composed of a 
representative and alternate from 
each hall and Charles Flaim, SAGA 
director. 
The committee members, chosen 
by Student Body President Mary 
Rukavina, meet once a month with 
Flaim to discuss general student 
opinion of the food service. 
According to Betsy Bistrick, a 
representative from Augusta, 
Flaim is concerned that the stu­
dents be pleased with the food 
service. "He feels that through the 
food committee, he can more easily 
be made aware of what students 
like and don't like," Bistrick noted. 
Bistrick explained that if a ~tudent has a suggestion or com­?laint, she directs it to any commit­tee member. The member will j)resent all student feedback to the committee, who will make every effort to alleviate the problem. 
"Mr. Flaim realizes that it is impossible for him to be in contact with every student," Bistrick said. She explained that Flaim under­stands that the students are more apt to discuss food services with 
fellow students than with him .

Soweto in protest. Armed police arrested at least SO whites students from the Witwatersrand University converging on a post office near central Johannesburg to send pro­test telegrams to Prime Minister John Vorster. 
The newspapers banned were the World and its sister publica­tion, the Weekend World, publish­ed in Johannesburg. The World, South Africa's major black news­paper, has a circulation of 160,000, but it is estimated to have at least a million readers. 
Its editor, Percy Qoboza, was seized by plainclothesmen at the paper's office shortly before he was scheduled to hold a news confer­ence. Weekend World news editor Aggrey Lkaaste was picked up overnight. 
The 18 black and interracial organizations banned were gener­ally regarded as moderate and nonviolent. All the militant black organizations have already been banned and their leaders jailed. 
Those ordered banned included two organizations linked to Biko­The Black People's Convention (BPC) and the South African Stu­dents Organization, as well as the Christian Institute and the Soweto 
Students' Representative Council. 
Those detained included BPC President Hlaku Bachidi and Rom­an Catholic leader the Rev. Patrick Mkhatshwa. The whites banned for five years were Christian Insti­tute Director Beyers Naude and two colleagues; Donald Woods, the outspoken editor of the East Lon­don daily Dispatch and two Cape Town clergymen. 
Banned persons are restricted to their hometowns, may not have visitors without official permission and can't be quoted in the press.

Notre Dame senior Jules Thomp­son will be featured at the. Nazz tomorrow evening from 9 p.m. to

Campaign rules announced for SBP/SBVP 
by Mark Perry Staff Reporter 
The official rules for the election of Student Body President and Vice-President (SBP/SBVP) and Student Life Council members were released yesterday by Clark Carmichael, chairman of the elec­tion committee, and Tom D. Lux, director of Ombudsman. 
In releasing the rules, Lux and Carmichael stressed some major points which they wanted students to be aware of. "We are trying to tone down the election,'' Car­michael stressed some major points which they wanted students to be aware of. 
"We are trying to tone down the election," Carmichael said, "so that the election will be run fairly 
and  no  candidate  will  have  an  
unfair advantage."  
"First,  we  want  to  make  sure  

that nobody goes out of their way to disclose their candidacy too early,'' Lux said. He added that should a potential candidate be approached by another student about his candidacy prior to the time stated in the rules he would be advised not to comment or he mav fact the

[CPS] --I t could be called the beer that made Nigeria famous. But it is being called offensive and racist. 
The Stroh Brewing company recently riln an advertisement de­picting the beer-drinking habits of the Kofyar tribe of Nigeria in 65 
newspapers. 
Students at Kent State Univers­ity were among the first to boycott the beer until the company made an appropriate apology for what they called a ''bigoted and insens­itive ad." 
James Telisky, Stroh's advertis­ing manager disclaimed any intent to offend viewers and that he was "sorry to learn the interpretation of this particular vignette assumed that Stroh's created an ad uncom­plimentary to the black race." 
Stroh's intends to run a monthly series of 11 ads, each representing a different race, to be published with the intent to make the messages "entertaining but accur­ate." 
penalty stated in the rules. 
"No one should organize his campaign too early," Lux con­tinued. • • A good candidate can set up a campaign in the amount of time allowed (four weeks), and if the candidate sets up a strong · campaign, he or she shows ability to run an organization well, and this will be reflected in the election. 
Anyone can run a good campaign in five months." 
"Also, the candidates are re­sponsible for the actions of every­one on their committees, in hopes that the candidates will limit the size of their campaign com­mittees," Lux added. 
In order that all potential can­didates understand all the rules, Carmichael said that a meeting for everyone interested will be held at the beginning of the spring se­meter. "At that time we will explain to the candidates what they can and cannot do prior to election day," Carmichael said. 
He added that if anyone has questions prior to this meeting should contact him at the Ombuds­man office (dial OBUD). 
The rules are as follows, with 
added comments by Carmichael: 
1. 
The elections will be held during the first week of March each year [the exact date will be announced[. 

2. 
Petitions to run for office may be picked up at the Student Government office two weeks be­fore election day. Petitions are to be returned approximately a week later, at which time there will be a manditory candidates meeting. Two hundred signatures with re­spective I.D. numbers for SBPI SBVP candidates and one hundred for SLC are required for no­mination. Students may sign more thanone candidates petition. Only official petitions may be circulated. A Ust of all finalized candidates will be pubUshed in the Observer. 


Carmichael stressed that only official petitions can be used, and that candidates can only ask for the student's name and l.D. number. "This is not campaigning," Car­michael said," so we don't want candidates putting their own in­formation about the students." 
A S60 limit on campaign ex­penses will be set for all SBP /SBVP candidates. A $30 limit will be set for SLC candidates. Outside contributions count toward the 

campaign expense limit. Receipts for all materials purchased are reqnlred by the Election Com­mittee. All receipts mast be received by the committee before the distribution of materials can begin. A copy of any and all posters must be submitted to the Election Committee before posting. These may be left in the Ombuds­man Offlce. Posters may not be larger than 11 Inches by 17 Inches and they cannot be placed on outside walls, trees, or any exterior areas according to University rules. 
Posters are to be displayed Inside dormitories and Inside public 
· buildings. No posters are allowed in or outside the dining balls. Sandwich style signs are per­mitted. No stlckum adhesives may be used on any materials. No moving vehicles with sowld gear are allowed, including sound trucks. Balloons are permissable. Skywriting and airplane banners are allowed. 
Carmichael said many of the regulations in this rule were added because, in past elections, can­didates had received donated ma­terials at a reduced rate. ''The Election Committee feels that do­nated articles might give some candidates an unfair advantage, since not all the candidates might be·able to obtain these donations." 
4. 
The only thing which can be donated to a ticket without It being assessed against their spending limit is people's labor. All other donated services or materials wUl be assessed against the candidates spending limit at their fair market value. 

5. 
H a candidate fails to disclose the proper cost of any campaign materials he will be penalized. Penalty: Forfeiture of candidacy. 

6. 
No write-Ins or blank ballots are allowed. They will not be counted. No endorsements may be given by the HPC as a body, or by the Student Government, Student Union or the Board of Commis­sioners. No endorsements may be sought from any freshman. Can­didates accept media endorsement 


at their own risk. 
7. 
Candidates cannot use any gathering of an organization for campaign purposes, even If they are members of that organizadon. Penalty: 50 percent campaign ex­penses will be deducted. 

8. 
SBP and SBVP candidates will be held responsible for the actions of anyone in their campaign or organization. 

9. 
No one may disclose his or her intention to ran for the office of SBP /SBVP sooner than the be­ginning of the spring semester. Penalty: 25 percent of campaign expenses will be deducted. 

10. 
No one may organize a campaign committee sooner than four weeks prior to election day. Organizing a campaign committee Includes soUciting any help what­soever, seeking endorsements, or seeking commitments for participa­tion or support. Penalty: 25 percent of campaign expenses will be deducted. 

11. 
No candidate may soUcit 


help or support from a person In an offlcial organlzadon until the actual campaigning period begins. Pen­
I 
alty: 10 percent of campaign ex­penses will be deducted. ~ 
12. The balloting areas mast be l 
clear of campaign literature or "vote-getters." Election Day signs will be permitted and provided. The Election Committee reserves the right to be the final arbiter and change the penalties based on 
·the degree of the offense. 
13. Only an offlcial candidate can campaign and completed pe· titions are needed to make a candidacy official. Therefore cam­
paigning may not begin until the petitions are returned to the Elec­tion Committee at the candidate's meeting, approximately one week before the primary election. Cam­aigning is any public contact--es­pecially the distribution of posters, buttons, ribbons, etc., and the making of speeches--used to solicit votes, except in the distributfon of official petitions.

Egan supports effort to help divorced Cath'olics 
by John Ryan 
Msgr. John Egan, special assis­tant to Fr. Hesburgh, endorsed the goals of the North American Con­ference for Separated and Divorced Catholics in an official welcoming statement to the conference at the CCE last Saturday. 
The goals Egan endorsed includ­ed ''the five points of the American Catholic Bishop's Bicentennial Convocation, 'A Call to Action' on the Church and Divorced Catho­lics,'' according to the conference's program. The program describes these as ''a serious effort to reconcile separated, divorced and remarried Catholics to the Church, the development of ''new minis­tries to divorced Catholics and their children in Church life.'' and the 
admittance of Catholics in second 
marriages to the Eucharist. 
Egan points out that '' 'A Call to 
Action' is a little more specific 
about the final objective regarding 
the reception of the Eucharist.'' It 
suggests that "the church leaders 
publicly address the request of the 
divorced who have remarried to 
receive, under certain conditions, 
the sacraments of the church.'' 
The South Bend Tribune gave substantial coverage to Egan's address in the "Metro" section of last Monday's edition. Egan expressed surprise at the major coverage given to his routine official welcome on behalf of the university. 
The position of the divorced and remarried Catholics within the church has changed, since one of the objectives of ''A Call to Action'' has already been realized. This was the termination of the automa­tic penalty of excommunication for remarriage after divorce. Egan pointed out that "the automatic excommunication was the policy of the American bishops, not necesar­ily of Rome." 
Fr. Bill Toohey, director of Campus Ministry, agrees with Egan in his support of the confer­ence's goals and he, too, stated that there is nothing outlandish or radical about the position. 
Band to perform 
The Notre Dame Marching Band will perform and head basketball coach "Digger" Phelps will speak on behalf of United Way during the nationally televised Notre Dame­USC game this Saturday. 
The band will perform "Thanks to You," arranged by band leader Robert O'Brien and will form the "Three People Symbol."

Mac Kay, the first student to actively take part in the program, expressed her satisfaction with the way the arrangement worked. ''Nothing had been organized when I first thought about it. It was difficult at first, but due to the good 
working relations  between  Notre  
Dame  and  St.  Mary's,  things  
worked out."  

She encountered problems of wher to live and which school to pay tuition to, but stated that these details were worked out. She found no problems with schedul­ing, she continued. "Everything is planned out for the next two years.'' She said that her chem­istry background at St. mary's was equivalent to the background of students at Notre Dame, adding that ''there is more competition at Notre Dame, but that comes with numbers." 
MacKay had done independent research this past summer in solar energy with Dr. David Cohn, associate professor of engineering at Notre Dame, and attributed her ability to fit in easily in the engineering program to that work. "It was the most valuable exper­ience of my life," she asserted. MacKay will graduate from St. Mary's this spring and Notre Dame in 1979. , 
St. Mary's students interested in the program should contact Patrick in the math department at St. Mary's. Patrick encouraged an early declaration of interest in the program to have sufficient time to take the necessary calculus, chem­istry. and physics pre-requisites. 
SMCRegent speaks tonight 
Elizabeth Nolan, assistant attor­ney general of Iowa, will speak in Room 161 of LeMans at 8 p.m. tonight. 
Sponsored by the St. Mary's Law Society, the speech is open to all interested students and faculty members. Nolan is a member ofthe St. Mary's Board of Regents and is a St. Mary's alumna. 



Dulac Revisions 
Today the seven-person committee that drafted the do Lac revisions will present its proposal to the Student Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees. Tomorrow the proposal will be brought before the entire board for a vote. If accepted, as is or in amended form, it will probably be in effect when classes resume after break. 
The revisions grew out of a move on the 
part of the officers of the University and 
the trustees to abolish the University
~ 
Judicial Board and to. eliminate students
: 
from the University judicial process. It is 
\ to the credit of the revisions committee, particularly SBP Dave Bender, that they did not limit themselves to those two proposals, but took advantage of the opportunity to propose valuable changes in other University regulations. But first we will consider their response to the original proposals. 
The main objection to abolishing the J-board and leaving all cases at the initial disposal of the dean of students is that the. dean would be forced both to gather the evidence and to judge the case. This was one of the points the trustees termed "non-negotiable." Their reasons, they said, were 1) to put the University in a better legal position and 2) to streamline · the system. 
We must ask ourselves what is lost by abolishing the J-board. Answer: actually, not much. Of course, in cases in which the dean of students and the J-board would have agreed on a decision, there would be no difference at all. Assuming. that they would disagree, the chain of events would go something like this: · 
Current System 
1. Dean charges student 
2. J-board holds hearing and finds student not guilty. 

3. Dean appeals J-board decision. 
4. Appeals Board holds hearing. Proposed System 
1. Dean charges student. 
2. I'~ an holds hearing and finds student guilty. 
3. 
Student appeals dean's decision. 

4. 
Review Board holds hearing. 


The revisions committee accepted this proposal of the trustees -and realistically speaking they had no alternative but fruitless defiance. But they have also amended the original proposal in ways that are intimately connected with the second of the trustees' non-negotiable points. 
The elimination of students from University judicial boards has unfor­tunately been viewed incampus debate as a usurping of some student right to be represented on them. But a judicial board is not a representative body. What is at issue is not the students' right to judge, but a students' right to be Judged in a fair manner. Removing students from University judicial boards has no signif­icance eXcept insofar as it relates to an accused student's chances for a fair 
· hearing. Consequently, we must ask what is lost when students no longer sit on these boards? The answer: the student has lost a judge who can immediately relate. to his status as a student. A student judge is by no means an automatic ''not guilty'' vote, but he is able to approach the case from a more empathetic position. He is more familiar with the problems and pressures of being a student at Notre Dame. On this basis, we would argue that the student members should be retained. The Board of Trustees, however, has declared the point "non-negotiable" and past exper­ience indicates that they will not change that. The job of the du Lac revisions team, then~as to find an acceptable alternative way of insuring the accused student an empathetic presence on the Judicial Re­view Board. They propose that the student be allowed to select one of the board members from a panel of twelve faculty and administrators. (The panel will be chosen by the Student Government Board of Commissioners from nominees by the Faculty Senate and the vice-president for student affairs). One board member will be chosen by the dean of students and the remaining three will be chosen at random, as long as the final composition is a three to two ratio of administrators to faculty members or vice versa. The final board then will have the confidence of the faculty, the administra­tion and the student body, and at least one member can be presumed to empathize with the accused student. In pragmatic terms, the revisions com­mittee has probably achieved one of the best results possible, given the trustees' determinatiom not to negotiate these two points. They have gone beyond the original core and made some excellent reommmendation for revisions in other areas. We will mention a few of them briefly: --They have declared the throwing of food or other objects in the dining halls a serious violation. --They have standardized the structure and powers of the hall judicial boards. --They have listed those offenses which shall be dealt with in the halls. --They have described the possible penal­ties for University and hall offenses. --Not least of all, they have clarified the language in parts of du Lac (and in two instances have corrected the grammar) without altering the substance. The revisions committee has accomp· lished a great deal in a brief time. We thank them for their effort and commend their results. The proposal is in the trustees' hands now and we urge them to adopt it. 

'Minority ' 
defined 
Dear Editor: 
.-.' 
.: Some years ago "minority" was
" 
'} 
a term which referred to blacks, ( Indians, Spanish, Americans, Esk­'i imos and other ethnic groups who had been or were being subjected to various forms of discrimination. ·; Soon women, though more than SO percent of the population, also became a "minority." It now appears from the article of Patrick 
W. Merman (Observer, Oct. 10, 1977) that homosexuals, though not subscribing to an "unnatural" mode of life, have also become a certifiable aggrieved minority. This latest discovery merely highlights the shameful fashion in which this allegedly Christian community, in its habitual bloody-minded way, has persecuted the most misunder­stood and downtrodden minority of all. I refer to the vampires of this world. 
Vampires espouse a colorful lifestyle which has contributed significantly to our diversity and richness of human experience. Yet only rarely has their legacy to our · civilizationbeenacknowledged. The renowned fifteenth century Rumanian humanist Count Dracula once referred to them as ''the most cherished and full blooded of my people" (Annals of Wallachla, · XXIV (1478), 355). When falsely accused of unwillingness to serve in the Turkish armies of that era, the vampires of Transylvania brought suit for defamation of character, alleging that they had ''always been willing to shed blood 
for the Sultan." In a celebrated 
trial they were vindicated and their 
accusers punished by having 
wooden stakes driven through their 
hearts [VIad the lmpaler vs. Mo­
hammed U, Journal of Ottom1111 
Jurisprudence, LXIII (1474), 764­
788.] 
Despite their impressive history, vampires have always been a scorned minority on this provincial campus: mocked, derided, and subjected to ecclesiastical denun­ciations by myopic fanatics whose hardness of heart is equalled only by the poverty of their 1 biblicism . (See the Book of David, XIX, and especially the Book of Goliath, XXXII, where vampires are praised for their "thirr.t for life.") 
The vampires of N.D. have not "chosen" an ."unnatural" life style. They are unfortunate pro­ducts of a crabbed, grasping, stifling, intolerant, puritanical, capitaifst socfety who have re­

A $22 Billion Shortfall 
=====================art buchwa I d 
WASHINGTON--It never got too much attention but the federal government has been unable to spend $22 billion over the past 27 months that Congress had author­ized in the budget. Furthermore, experts predict that a big chunk of the $458.3 billion Congress will vote in fiscal 1978, which started October 1, will also not be spent by next October 1. 
You are probably wondering, as I did, why, when the government has the authorization to spend the money, it isn't just shelled out? 
I went over to a friend of mine at the Office of Management and Budget to find out what was going on. 
He was tied up writing checks, but he ageed to see me for a few moments. 
"I hear you're having trouble spending $22 billion." 
"It isn't as easy as everyone thinks,'' he said, looking haggard. ''Have you ever tried to spend $22 billion?" 
''I haven't, but my wife has," I said. 
"This is no laughing matter," he said. "I have to get rid of it or my job is on the block.'' 
"Why don't you call the Defense Department? They could use it in a jiffy." "They're lousy with money over there. They're having a helluva time spending what we gave them last year. I sent over a couple of billion last week and they sent it back. Said they didn't have any place to put it." 
"What about HEW?" I asked. 
"When it comes to asking for money they're always there. But throw it at them and they can't figure out who to give it to. The trouble is that all the governmental departments ask fnr more than they need on the assumption Congress will cut them down. Then when they get the full amount they're in a pickle." 
"How about the CIA? Couldn't they use the $22 billion to over­throw an_ unfriendly govern­
ment?" 
"I can't talk about the CIA, but 
they stiJI have billions in numbered 
Swiss bank accounts. After Chile 
they're keeping a low profile as far 
as spending large sums of money 
goes. They won't take more than a 
few hundred million, and then they 
do it under protest.'' 
"Hey, maybe you could give the 
money in foreign military aid?" 
"We thought of that, but no one 
seems to be able to manufacture 
the staff fast enough. We have a 
couple of billion dollars of hard­
ware in the pipeline, but we can't 
pay for the equipment until it's 
delivered." 
''You're really up against the 
wall," I said. "I thought it was 
easy to give away money in the 
government." 
"Don't let anybody kid you. By the time a bureaucrat does all the paperwork, it takes a year to get rid of a measly $25 million." 
"Everyone things government · people are such big spenders." 
''The bureaucrats cry like mad when you don't give it to them. But when you do they scream bloody murder that they don't have enough people to give it away." 
My friend's secretary came in. "The Treasury just sent back $1.5 billion. They say they overesti­mated the interest they had to pay on government bonds. 
"Well, we're not taking it!" my friend shouted. "They know damn well once they accept the money they can't give it back." 
"But they dumped it all over my office," she cried. 
"I have an idea," I said. "Why don't you just forget about spending the $22 billion and give the taxpayers a break?" 
"Sure, that would look just great on Capitol Hill," he said. "How would you feel if you were a congressman or senator and you suddenly found out the U.S. gov­ernment hadn't spent $22 billion of the money you authorized?" 
"I guess," I admitted, "I'd feel sick to my stomach." 
signed themselves to being what they really are and who now ask only to live in their own distinctive way. Mr. Merman calls homosex­uality "just a subset of freedom." How much more true of vampirism. 
Those who wish to aid in redressing the wrongs done to local vampires may do so by contributing to the Vampire Legal Aid Fund. Just send cash, checks, or money orders to me (G-66 Library), or slide mone~ under th~ door. We already enjoy the unstinting sup­port of local chapters or our comrades-in-discrimination, Fellators Forever and Tribades Triumphant. We have been pro­mised endorsement by the Lesbian Legion. Other freedom-loving groups will shortly follow. Do not be left behind in this crusade for liberty and social justice.

Hark you Southern Cal and give ear for the coaches have spoken: 
We have Linemen and Backs whom we have reared and brought up. The Lineman knows who to block and the back knows which hole to run. But USC has no knowledge nor will it matter. 
0 sinful Southern Cal, people loaded with iniquity, race of Trojans, wanton destructive children who have beaten and mangled the teams of Irish past and burned them deep and tried to run up the score on them. 
0 Southern California, your fate is soon to be sealed. Take heed of the fate which has come to Army, Michigan State, Pitt and Purdue, for they too sought to turn the Irish to defeat. 
Where, USC, can you still be struck after the game? When your heads are aching and your bodies covered with sores, from the repeated onslaughts of the defensive front walls, reckless abandon of the linebacktrs. and the calculated assaults by the secondary, with your pride squashed by the many runs up the middle and around the ends for long yardage and the passes over the middle for even more. 
From head to foot there is not a sound spot on you -nothing but bruises and raw wounds which no bandage or compress can soothe. But no sore will be as paivful as the sore to the Trojan ego and eye as that which ts the score that will read: 
NOTRE DAME 24 USC 17 
The land of Southern California will be desolate as Sodom in it's overthrow. Had the Irish not trained well they would soon have been like Sodom, no better than Gomorrah. 
Harken unto me you Supporters of Trojans, worshippers of the mosi Tatupu: We have no desire for the blood of your players, only to see them depart quietly in defeat. 

University persecuted 
Dear Editor: 
It's about time that the University be freed from the persecution it is receiving concerning the main­tenance workers controversy. The plain fact is that the University does have the right to lay off its maintenance workers in place of a more efficient system. As long as these workers are assimilated into other forms of employment with roughly the same salary (as is promised), then the Univer~ity's critics should have no complamt. 
One must put the situation into proper perspective. Beginning maintenance workers receive approximately $5,700 a year. Consider this in relation to South Bend police and firemen who, after three years of duty, earn only $9,500 per year. Granted, four thousand dollars mav seem like a great deal to students, but is it all that much to these public servants who risk their lives daily for South Bend residents? 
The University does not have to pay its maintenance workers a salary as high as they receive now. Ifthe worker's supporters still feel that the University is paying meager wages to its help for the work thay they do, then I suggest that they tell their problems to a policeman. Better yet, why not tell them to a policeman's widow. I'm sure that both will he exttemely sympathetic!

Human rights violation 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to suggest that anyone interested in viewing ~rst­hand a violation of human nghts need no longer go to Chile or Russia for such displays; the lawn in front of the Law School is far enough. On certain days a young fundamentalist preaches to anyone who will listen, and the behavior of many of these listeners. is a sickening and inhumane dtsgrace to the ideals of this university.

Do You Want this Victory? 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~ pauI cop p oIa 
On this coming Saturday, the Trojans of Southern Cal once again make their way to South Bend to match forces with the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame. The Trojans have emerged the victor in the previous three contests. Most of us have never seen Notre Dame beat 
U.S.C. while we have been stu­dents here. There are only a select few still remaining who experienc­ed that cherished victory of 1973. For the seniors, this will be their last chance while they are still here to see the Trojans succumb to the Irish. 
I have a simple question to ask 
each and every member of the 
Notre Dame student body: Do you 
want this victory? I mean, DO you 
really want it? You tell me: "Yes. 
I want it!" Good. But do you 
"want it" as a miser wants his 
gold, as a mother wants her child, 
as a wordling wants his honors, or 
as a sensualist wants his pleasure? 
No? Then you don't "want it!" 
Do you "want it" to the point 
where you will get to the stadium 
before the game starts (while the 
players are warming up) and then 
begin to cheer and holler from that 
point on until the end of the game? 
What a lift this would give to the 
team! Many of you saw what it did 
for our basketball team last year in 
their upset win over number-one­
ranked University of San Francisco. 
Under the direction of Digger 
Phelps, the student body arrived at 
the A.C.C. fifteen minutes before 
game time and roared from that 
time on throughout the game. 
Do you want it to the point where you'll give the Notre Dame defense, a standing ovation every time they come off the field after holding 
U.S.C. short of another first down? 
Do you want it to the point where you'll show our defensive players 
Administration and especially the 
army of lawyers and public relation 
men that have spent many hours 
and a great deal of money in an 
attempt to create this confusion. 
Unfortunately, for Mr. Conklin, 
Mr. Bull, and these mysterious 
"higher-ups" who are often referr­
ed to obliquely yet never named, 
sometimes it takes more than a 
good PR job to obliterate the truth. 
The truth is that the across-the­
board pay hike to all nonsalaried 
wage-earners announced on Mon­
day was, in effect, a cost of living 
increase of a similar rate as in 
previous years. The rate of 
increase for the groundskeepers is 
approximately 6.4 o/o for those 
earning $3.07 per hour and 5.6% 
for those e~ming $3.42 an hour. 
The fringe benefits are proposals 
nothing more. In eff~ct, they are

QSA 
The present for India looks bad, and the future looks worse. In addition to her burgeoning population, India has suffered through four years of drought in the last ten. The mind perceives India, in a stunning paradox, as a fearfully over­populated ghost town. Mr. V.B. Salunke (Shu-lim-ke) has stepped into this Indian breach in an attempt to reverse the tide of oblivion. Mr. Salunke, at approximately 5'6" and 140 lbs, is a diminutive and very 
soft spoken man. His physical stature 
seems absurd when contrasted with the enormity of his task. Yet Mr. Salunke may be India's last and best hope. He is the managing trustee of the Gram Gourav Pratishthan, a "voluntary organization" in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Maha­rashtra is a blighted state in a beknighted land. It receives barely 15 inches of rainfall annually , and its "population of ten· million,'' according to the Times of India," is struggling to pass its life while adjusting to... the declining agricultural production." Mr. Salunke's Pratishthan, which is funded in part by the ND-SMC World Hunger Coalition, has founded a "model vilJage" there consisting of 250 families who occupy an area of four square miles. The experimental village called
--Naigon. Mr. Salunke described Naigon to a gathering of 80-100 participants at a World Hunger Coalition sponsored vege­tarian meal. The Observer interviewed Mr. Salunke after the meal. The following are excerpts from that interview. Observer: I'd like to start with a couple of general question. First, is there hope for India? 
S: Certainly, we are quite hopeful that there is. 
0: Is the situation really as urgent as it is presented to be? 
·S: I would say yes ... time is running out... in the event that we don't start now. 
0: What would you say are the funda­mental problems that India must face? 
S: Basically it is a problem of full employment. 
0: In what sense? 
S: If the economic goods in our country are not redistributed, there is bound to be tension between the "haves" and "have­nots" and the whole political structure, which is democratic, will be perhaps threatened. And ifthe United States wants to proclaim leadership of the democratic world , it should also see that when another democratic country is dying, it should help them in such a way as they will develop. 
0: Would you say that this is a cataclysmic vision? Do you see a global revolution in our future? 
S: I am very hopeful of that. A new class, particularly the student generation, will emerge. •

Bob Jacobs 
0: -I understand that you visited Japan earlier this month, what do you see as the US position vis a vis Japan? 
S: (laughs) Japan is very close to the United States in its lifestyle. In Japan also, they have much waste...and I said the same thing to them also. And I am more critical of Japan, particularly because they claim that Buddhism is their religion. 
0: And Buddhism is inconsistent with overconsumption?
S: Yes, exactly. Though they have become 
more ... secular, they should try to identify themselves more with the religious values. 
0: What should the United States policy be two the third world? 
S: It should be to really share the knowledge and particularly the technology. Sharing that knowledge more openly and freely, and not in the commercial line. By sharing this knowledge we people in India, on our own, would reconstruct our own economic structure. You know the gap between the US and India is so great. You are all the time consuming so much for waste, and we are correspondingly con­suming less and less so that we are living on the poverty line. To cross the poverty line, we have got to use the science and 
technology. 
0: How important, then, are villages such as Naigon to the future of India 
S: To 113 of the contry, they are critical 
0: What conclusions have you drawn from your experiment at Naigon? 
S: I feel that a lot of education has to be done...not only in agriculture, but in the so-called humanities. 
0: I'd like to change our focues a little bit. I'd like to talk about the political situation in India. A lot of people were surpised that Indira Ghandi was defeated in her bid for reelection,were you surprised? 
S: No, I was not surprised very much, 
considering the situation that was taking place. 
0: In view of the extreme situation that India must face, do you think that Indira Ghandi, and specifically her "state of emergency," were good for India? 
S: Well, in my personal opinion, none of the government is trying to do the social reforms that they promise. What is required is "social surgery," and Ghandi was not good for this. 
0: Could you describe the village struc­ture? 
S: It is a traditional village now 
0: Well what separates Naigon from the village we see on TV where people are starving, or suffering from other in­digenous miseries? 
S: Well we have just made a beginning. We have raised the usable water supply threefold. In the end, we expect that--you know in Naigon, as in most of India, only 8 percent of the land is under irrigation. Now our idea is 8 percent irrigation should

An exhibition of works from the perma­nent collection, "Landscape into Art," will be presented by the University of Notre Dame Art Gallery from October 16 through November 20. The last exhibition of this nature occurred fifteen years ago at the Art Gallery. Since that time, landscape works in the permanent collection have grown immensely in quantitiy as well as quality, becoming one of the major sources of pride for the Art Gallery and the University. 
Over SO paintings, prints and drawings have been added to the collections, including important works by Troyon, Harpignies, Courbet, Rousseau, Corot and Robert. One of the main purposes of this exhibition is to group together these new

S: Well, in the year 1972 there was a very, very great famine in the country expecialry in our state (Maharashtra) so we visited that area, just to know ourselves, the famine conditions. And we decided that, ... we must take up some of the work of a long-lasting program instead of a tem­porary emergency program. And we should not only say what should be done, but rather than that, we should try to live the ideas ourselves.

F1fght into Egypt are secondary to the setting, they still set the tone of the painting and bring to the landscape a poetic dimension. 
Works from the 18th century reflect the growth of a pastoral tradition. Nature is viewed more as a controlled, civilized garden than as "natural." In Hubert Robert's depiction of a washerwoman on a bridge, we see a rustic scene. However, the rustic qualities are tidy and pleasant, reflecting the era of ladies of the French court who dressed as shepherdesses for amusement. 
The Notre Dame Art Gallery is alos noted for its important 19th century collection. In France, during the 1830's, came a great revival of landscape art, 

acquisitions along with the old, demonstra· ting the strength of the Art Gallery's landscape collection. 
Another purpose of this exhibition is didactic. In selecting works for display, it became evident to the organizers of this exhibition that it would be possible to comprehensively illustrate the history of landscape art, from the 16th century to the present day, tracing its development form a detail of secondary importance to a vehicle for formal experimentation. 
The earliest works in the exhibition date from the High Renaissance. The renewed interest in the natural world during this period was reflected in the development of linear perspective and studies in anatomy, but alos in the increased depiction of landscapes. At this time, however, landscape was considered a necessary but secondary motif, needed to fill out a composition or to serve as a backdrop for a portrait or religious scene. This can be seen in the work, Madonna and Chlld' from the ~choot of Filippino Lippi. 
~he 17th century was one of the greatest periods of the landscape tradition which flowered in the north of Europe, in Dutch and F!emish capitals. It is from this period that many of the treasures of the Notre Dame collection date. Works from this period, such as those by van Ruisdael and Wyr.ants are straight-forward and natural­istic, demonstrating an interest in topo­graphy and atmosphere. The work by French c1rtist, Oaude Lorrain, however, deals with landscape more in terms of mood. Although the figures in Rest !'I the centered with the Barbizon School which drew primarily from the matter-of-fact 17th century Dutch approach. This revival, here represented by Rousseau and Corot, portrays nature with a realistic concern for vision, a sharp break from 18th century artifice, preparing the way for the later Impressionists. 19th century landscape in America closely follows this movement, but works range from the sparse, almost laconic interpretation of Kensett, to the lush, painterly approach of Inness. 
In the 20th century landscape remains important, but not for the sake of topography or atmosphere. Rather, land­scape has evolved as a motif for experi· menting with vexing formal problems, as in Marin, or as an outward projection of an interior mood, as in Pechsteiri. The most recent work in the exhibition. by Douglas Kinsey, proves that landscape remains today an enduring subject ~or artists and audiences alike.

Letters to a Lonely God 
AFirm and Certain Belief 
Reverend Robert Griffin 
Some days, believe itor not, I don't want to be the keeper of anybody's conscience. Somedays, I just want to tell God that I am sorry for my sins, and I hope the world is sorry for its sins too. H the world isn't sorry, that's the world's problem, and God's problem. I'm just tired of the rhetoric by which we call each other liars and hypocrites. I'm tired of living with guilt imputed to me by kids with petitions in their hands who tell me my kind of Christian doesn't care; if we did, we would give up smoking and drinking grain alcohol. Yesterday morning, I heard from a priest who wants to talk to the campus about understanding New York prostitutes. New York prostitutes, it seems, are a sexual minority needing people's under­standing. The priest I heard from works with prostitutes; he understands them; he wants us to understand them too. He also understands transvestites, who would pre­fer--the priest says--to be called "femmo­philes." Femmophilia, I have decided, is 
the  one  word,  too  much  to  bear,  that  
excuses  me  from  trying  to  understand  
anybody.  

Without being quarrelsome, I would like to say this. I don't understand how governments work, and often I don't understand how students think. However, I am--even in my mid-semester slump-­capable of reading the Observer; and one day last week, I read that the Student Government was allocating five hundred dollars to the Notre Dame chapter of the Right to Life. A week later, I read that no, the Student Government was not giving five hundred dollars to the Right to Life, because some student leader felt that such an allocation was unfair. One shudders at injustices, and one concurs that students 
They wear doublets, kilts, spats and sporrans, and stand over eight feet tall when they wear their shakos. They look like figures from another era dancing a damsha bua victory clog and the first ones even played bagpipes. Anyone who has ever seen a Notre Dame football game has surely noticed them high stepping down the field in front of the university band. They are members of Notre Dame's famous Irish Guard, symbols of the "Fight­ing Irish, "and collectively a color unit for the band. 
The Irish Guard first performed in the fall of 1951 wearing black Scottish kilts because of a shortage of material following World War II. Six of the men1bers played bagpipes and two played drums, but the use of these instrumetns lasted only two years due to problems with the bagpipes in cold weather. Reeds in the pipes froze in cold weather but the bellows did not, allowing only uncontrolled sound. Lewis Sneddon from Scotland first advised the guard on how to dress and play the pipes 
and  later  John  Fyfe,  a  member  of  th  
Scottish  military from  Glasgow,  became  
the Guard's advisor.  

The uniform changed gradually over the years and the present version, designed specifically for the guard, has been used since 1974. It consists of a plaid, a large piece of cloth worn over the shoulder, a red 
should not be permitted to commit injust­ices against one another. Student govern­ments have a right to spend their money any damn way they want, as long as it is not on call girls. I have never believed that Christians committed to a reverence for life __should ask organizations preferring to remain neutral, to contribute one penny toward the protection of innocent and 
helpless life. ' 
I have a firm and certain belief--encour­aged and supported by the Ancient Faith that teaches me that Christ is Lord, and that the Eucharist is His Life, and that you, my brothers and sisters, are made in the image and likeness of God--I have a conviction that men and women, having created life however casually, have an obligation, not always easy, to protect that life in all decent, possible ways. I do not know at what moment, in the marriage of cells, the tiny flutter of a heartbeat begins, or when the tiny hands are shaped, or when the brain begins to sense its own existence. But tell me that flesh and blood are reaching out towards growth and birth as a human being, and I respect the miracle, and I know of no power on earth that gives me a right to interrupt that miracle. This is a personal creed, but it is also a belief that Christians, Catholic and Protestant, have insisted on for centuries as basic human morality. 
It seems like game-playing to have money allocated to a group, then taken away from the group, on the excuse that abortion is a political issue, making the group look like cheap wardheelers in the act of shaking down the money tree. It was unfortunate that the Student Government was even approached by the Right to Life group; in doing so, the group took its chances, but it should not have been made to look shabby. Political principles may have constituted a valid argument for refusing money to the Right-to-Lifers; but abortion, before anything else, is a moral issue. Care of the unborn infant is one of the absolutes of life and death that Christians recognize as part of their moral code. In a Christian community, it seems to me, the pros and cons of abortion do not require being debated; and even if they were, the issue is much more than political. We have our principle of commitment to a reverence for life. All we need now is the courage to live out that belief. 
If I were, all by myself, a Student Government giving money to Right to Life, I would want to know how the money is spent. So many Right-to-Lifers, it seems to me, waste much time being tasteless and abrasive narnecallers, maintaining an en­emies' list of public figure they would like to destroy. True concern for the unborn means programs of assistance to women needing help with their burden of preg­nancy. If you were pregnant, or your best girl were pregnant, would you know who to tum to for help? Would you know what kind of support to expect from these traditional, committed Catholics? Isn't it true that information as well as help is more easily available (and more widely distributed) from those whom the namecal­lers brand as murderers (I cringe at the word, but I didn't invent it) than it is from the Catholic agencies? Would it seem in any way political for a Student Government to contribute funds to a group dedicated to helping a terrified young woman who wants to cherish the life that stirs in her womb? Compassion for such a distressed soul means furnishing her with the assistance a family could give her; the

doublet, kilt, black shoes with white spats and white gloves. The large traditionally bearskin hats are called shakos and the horsehair sporran on the front of the kilt was originallly a pouch for money and ammunition. The flasher, a small orn­ament worn on the hose, shoulder and waist belts, and plume on the hat complete the uniform. 
· The uniqueness of the uniform lies in its design and the one-of-a-kind plaid mater­ial. The cloth is officially the Notre Dame plaid, designed in 1969 by Robert O'Brien, 
director of the band, and made exclusively for Notre Dame. The design is registered in Scotland and is copyrighted so that no one but the Univeristy may use it. 
The background of blue traditionally symbolizes a scholar and it, together with gold in the design, comprise Notre Dame's school colors. The plaid also contains green to symbolize the Fighting Irish and black to delineate the pattern. The papal red of the doublet symbolized the Church and Holy Cross Fathers. 
0'Brien explained the seemingiy all­Scottish traditions of the Guard by saying that the word "Scottish" originally meant "Irish tribe., and that many of the traditions of the two countries were the same. ''The kilt was in both countries,'' he continued. "but the Scots got the kilt from the Irish.'' Also, both countries had bagpipes. 
Irish Guard members audition with the band and are judged on marching abilities, enthusiasm and stature by the band directors and assistants, Fyfe, and Guard Captain Mark Baumgartner. "Because there are only eight chosen we can get a very good unit,'' O'Brien remarked. 
Guard members must be 6'2" or taller an.d wear their hair short. When asked about accepting women in the Guard O'Brien replied "I don't see why not, as long as they're qualified and competent." 
One existing member of the Guard stated that he didn't think women would fit in, saying that the group was "more for guys." 
Members practice with the band and march in pep rallies, all home games, bowl games, and ~ne away game a year. Originally, the Guard marched through the concourse in the stadium before each home game, but the practice was discontinued several years ;go. 
The Gua1 · members consider their group some\. at of a fraternity and pride themselves u; «.eeping many of the group trt.ditions se' ~et. Rookie lnitiantions, involving a 1odified scavenger hunt, pre-game ce nonies and certain aspects of their attite ·u~ known ooly to group members. 
family being absent, for whatever reason, loving friends do the best they can to help a child to be born with dignity and comfort. That is what Right to Life at Notre Dame and St. Mary's can mean, because there are Christians who care what happens to infants asking for the right to live. I know this is the kind of program the Right-to­Lifers here want, because I've been trying to help them find the ways and means to make it possible. 
We spend a lot of time scolding each other on this campus, but I think we suspect the other person's basic goodness. We need also trust one another as honest; then we can respect each other even while we shout. I respect student leaders as some of the finest people I know, and sometimes I am naive enough even to admire the Student Government, as long as it isn't being political. 
That is why I know I den't need to be the keeper of any person's conscience. Nagg­ing gets to be a habit, I guess, and nagging is one of the chores of being the University Chaplain. You really can't--if you're the chaplain--take days off from nagging, spending time not understanding, telling God you are sorry for your sins. I would rather tell God I am sorry for my own sins, though, than tell him I'm sorry for a prostitute's sins. At least at Notre Dame, you don't have femmophiles you must try to understand; it's much easier to try to understand them as transvestites. 
Have a lovely mid-semester break. Darby and I never said we didn't love you. It's really funny: as often as Darby and I say that to you, we never say it to each other. I wonder ifthere's something about my own cocker spaniel I really don't understand. 
Maureen Sajbel 
Baumgartner explained that there has been a change in the attitude of the Guard in the last four years. Past members, he said, ''had that hard core, macho image because they felt that that was the only way they had to be." He went on to say that he did not like the image because the Guard ''is more like a color unit, just something much more unique." As a secondary function, the Guard acts as a "deterent for people who would bust through the band. They think they're going to get run over so they move." The group, no matter what 
their image, function as a color unit and 
make the Notre Dame· Band unique and 
recognizable where ever they go. Their 
strict inspections before games and clean 
cut, unsmiling appearance make them an 
imposing and highly impressive group. Anyone who seeseven just the last minute . of a Notre Dame football game will know 
that the Fighting Irish have won again by 
the appearance of the Guard, doing the 
traditional damsha bua, translated from 
Gaelic, the victory clog, or dance. 
Irish Guard members range from fresh­
man to fifth year student and are in various 
majors from pre-med to architecture. 
Veteran members of the group include 
Captain Mark Baumgartner, Torn Lucceri, 
Paul ft..ladden, Tim Salamunovich, George 
Spl)hcr, and Dan Gomrick, and this year's 
rookies are Jack Prendergast. Chris Digan, 
Manii)' -Grace, and Lou Bridges.

uth 


The needs of the city are the needs of 
man. Man builds communities to give him 
shelter and safety; to ease his satisfaction 
of hunger and thirst desires; to allow him a 
means of communication; to seek aesthetic 
principles which govern his opinions and 
actions; to seek the realization of his own 
ideals and the independence of his 
thoughts and actions. 
The city and its elements are the 
measure of man. Civilization was born in 
the community: the communication of 
ideas was only possible when man had 
gathered together in communal form. The 
progression of thought rests upon the 
progression of our cities and communities. 
At certain density levels of human 
habitation, needs are lost or neglected. 
Certainly a single family cannot satisfy all 
human needs. 
Certainly a metropo­
lis without community division cannot meet 
the needs of all of its people. Even hunger 
and thirst are prevalent in some sectors of 
large cities. 
The simple question of numbers is a 
major cause of the disorder within the 
eco-biological relationships between man 
and his physical environment. The 
economics, sociology, and politics of the 
community become frayed when exposed 
to an overdose of community members. 
This in tum, affects architecture and urban 
structure, which in tum influences all of 
these relationships. 
If these relationships are not fully understood, or ignored, then the city faces a possibility of decay. Urban implosion and blight are the consequences of a series of failings and frailties of the politician, the urban designer, the builder and the architect. The failure of modem architect­ure to offer psychological relief or stimula­

Rights coalition to protest at Bryant concert 
by Marti Hogan  
Editor-In-Chief  '  
Uniting..'9'der the  theme  ''All  
God's  Ch~en  Gotta Sing,"  the  
Michian . Coalition  for  Human  
Rights formed last week to protest  
at  the  scheduled  appearance  of  
Anita Bryant Oct. 27 in the Athletic  
and Convocation Center (ACC).  
The coalition, organized by Jim  
Howard  of the  South  Bend  Gay  
Community, plans to ''kill her with  
kindness. "We'd like to greet her  
with roses,  and we're  holding  a  
reception in her honor following the  
concert," he said.  
During the concert, the coalition  
will hold a vigil outside the ACC.  
Howard emphasized that it is not a  
demonstration  and  that  anyone  
reacting violently will not be asso­ 
ciated with the coalition.  ''They  
can throw oranges at her, but then  
they won't be associated with us,"  
he said.  
According to Howard, no one in  
the coalition plans  to  attend the  
concert.  Howard  defended  
Bryant's right to have the concert,  
adding, "It's our right to stand out  
in the cold."  The Gay Community  
at Notre Dame has decided  as  a  
group not to participate in the vigil,  
according to  Bill Batten,  an  em­ 
ployee of the Memorial Library.  
"They didn't want any connection  
with the vigil, and I'm willing to  
step out and say something,'' he  
explained.  He called the  Notre  
Dame group a social group rather  
than a political group, and said he  
J ) l  began looking outside of the group to involve himself politically. A minority of the Notre Dame group will make an appearance at the  
vigil, Batten said.  
!  According to a spokesman for the Gay Community at Notre Dame, the group took a vote at one of their meetings and decided not to part­ 
icipate in any type of protest.  "No  
one wants to stay here over break  
for Anita Bryant," he said.  
Batten claims that Bryant's visit  
is not only a threat to the gays but  
to everyone ''with liberalities. The  
group participating is not necessar­ 
ily composed of gay people,  "  he  
said.  '·People opposed  to  Anita  
Bryant's politics will  also partici­ 
pate."  
Howard urges  anyone  with  an  
interest in human rights "in any  
way, shape  or  form''  to join the  
vigil on  the 27th.  The Women's  
Political  Caucus  and  a  group  of  
Notre  Dame  law  students  have  
committed themselves to the vigil,  
according to Howard.

night, approximately 25 Notre Dame law students decided ''to join up with the downtown group," said Ellen Barry law student. They will attend an organizational meet· ing Sunday sponsored by the coalition. "If we agree with the plan of action, we will demonstrate with them," she said. 
He added that anyone participat· ing in the vigil will be welcome at the reception to be held at the Water Works, a gay bar in South Bend, following the concert. 'The reception is really a 15 cent beer bust," he said, "but she doesn't have to know that."

buy the tickets first to avoid having to sell them to homosexuals. "I never thought of myself as an undesirable,'' Howard comment · ed 
Although Anderson stated that Bryant was appearing as a per­former and not as a speaker, the letter stated the concert has a two-fold purpose. The letter reads: ''1) It will give a beautiful evening of fellowship among Christians. 2) It will permit Christian believers to stand up for the rights of the Word of God, and the BIBLE TRUTHS regarding homosexuality.'' 
The coalition has asked Ander­son to participate in a debate with Dave Sommerton, owner of the Water Works and co-director of the coalition. The debate will be aired at 10 a.m. Oct. 21 on WSJV-TV, channel 28 during the Bill Darwin Show. 
As further support, the coalition attempted to get a statement from

Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, University president, concerning his stand on human rights. They were told, however, that Hesburgh was tied up this month and would not be able to meet with the representa­tives of the group until Oct. 28, the day after the concert. 
"I didn't expect him to say 'I love all queers,' " Howard said, "but we wanted some sort of backing since he is so active in Human Rights." "It's nice to be for human rights in an aesthetical sense," Howard continued, "but Anita Bryant is going to be less ·h~r, hplf a mile from his office." 
Busses will be leaving the Water Works and the Sea Horse, another gay establishment in South Bend, to transport those participating in the vigil to the ACC. "Anyone straight is welcome to join us on the bus,'' Howard encouraged. He explained that buses were being employed mainly for the protection of those participating in the vigil. "Homesexuals may be afraid to drive their cars individually to the ACC, and there is strength in numbers," Howard stated. 
Bryant will be appearing on the Phil Donahue show Oct. 27 before she comes to South Bend. Ander­son plans to meet her in Chicago 
and drive her to South Bend.  She  
will  not  be  staying  in  the  city  
overnight.

More than a movie. An adventure you11 never forget. 
The Catholic Committee on Ur­ban Ministry (CCUM) will focus on its commitment to the labor move­ment, to neighborhoods, and to social justice recommendations of 
. the 1976 "Call to Action" con­
ference at its annual meeting Oct. 
30-Nov. 2. 
These three themes were chosen because they represent "challenge and opportunity," according to Sr. Margaret Cafferty, executive dir­ector of CCUM. She cited recent unionization of Church employees and full employment legislation as current developments in the area of labor and pointed out that CCUM friend, Msgr. Geno Baroni, newly appointed assistant secretary of HUD, gives the group an entree into neighborhood-based issues of 
justice.  Baroni  is  scheduled  to  
address  the  meeting  Nov.  2  at  
10:45 a.m.  

Lastly, she noted that the Nation­al Conference of Catholic Bishops has begun committee deliberations to formulate its response to the 182 "Call to Action" conference resolu­tions passed a year ago in Detroit by some 1,300 delegates. 
Some of the resolutions are considered controversial by Ameri­can bishops, but they are committ­ed to come up with a plan of action to further the Church's social mission. The CCUM conference, Cafferty said, will offer "a series of workshops which illustrate models of implementation of specific reso­lutions.'' 
New Orleans jazz comes to Indiana 
The PRESERVATION HALL JAZZ BAND, a group of New Orleans musicians who have traveled the world over playing the famous music they created decades ago, will return to Clowes Memo­rial Hall on the Butler University campus for a single performance on Sunday, Oct. 30, at 7:30p.m. It is probably the foremost group in the world that recreates the marches, blues, spirituals and rag­time sounds that filled the saloons, streets and riverboats in and around the "French Quarter" of New Orleans. 
Tickets are priced at $7.SO, $6.50, $6.00, $5.50 and $4.50 and may be purchased at the Clowes Hall Box Office, Ross and Babcock Ticket Agency, Ross and Young Ticket Agency and all Ayres Ticket Booths located at Washington Square, Lafayette Square, Glen­dale, Greenwood and Downtown.

Memorial fund­comemorates accident victim 
A memorial fund has been established by the family and friends of a Notre Dame graduate student who was accidentally killed in a home accident in August, 1973, while completing requirements for a doctoral degree in history. John Highbarger, married and the father of two sons, died of electrical shock when an electric drill in his hands penetrated a high voltage wire. 
A large portion of the fund will be used to purchase books of American and Latin American his­tory for the permanent collection in the Memorial Library. Supervising this purchase will be Fr. Thomas Blantz, and Dr. Frederick B. Pike, professors of history, who were associated with the former student in his graduate :;tudies. 
The remainder of the fund will be invested and the interest each year will constitute a grant in the amount of $100 for a graduate student in history who submits the best academic proposal or reason for its use. This may include travel expenses for research and disserta­tion needs, purchase of computer data, summer study expenses or any scholarly need. The grant will be awarded on March 1 and the recipient will be honored at the The bodv sent to Dr. Criado for figure out where they are going to

Missing six weeks 
M&f<URA™LDOFAtJ
German industrialist killed 
$1.79 
PARIS [AP] -The body of West German industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer, kidnapped six weeks ago, was foundlastnight stuffed into the trunk of a car in the French city of Mulhouse near the German border, the French Interior Ministry said. A spokesman said his throat had ben cut. 
Earlier in the day, a communique received by an extreme leftist Paris. newspaper said: ''The existence of Mr. Hanns Martin Schleyer has been ended." He was abducted Sept. 5 by terrorists firing ·auto­matic weapons as he was being driven home from work in Cologne. 
The communique said the dead man was in the trunk of a green Audi sedan in Mulhouse. Police said they found the body after ripping open the back seat of the auto. 
The car was loaded on a break­
down  truck  and  taken  to  police  
headquarters.  
The  communique  was  signed  

''Commando Seigfried Houssner R.A.F." 
That was ·the name of the German Terror group that said it kidnapped Sclileyer and threatened · to execute him unless the West German government released 11 terrorists from West German jails and flew them to the refuge of their choice with nearly half a million dollars in ransom. 
The government has not met the demands. 
The communique was given to the newspaper Liberation, which has previously received communi­ques from the Schleyer's kidnap­pers. 
''After 43 days we have put an end to the miserable and corrupt existence of Hanus Martin Schley­er," the communique said. 
"West German Chancellor Hel­mut Schmidt, who in his calculation of power has, from the beginning, speculated with the death of Schleyer, can take delivery of him on Charles Peguy Stre.et in Mul­house in a green Audi 100, licensed at Hamburg." 
The communique continued: "His death is commensurate with our sorrow and our anger after the Mogadishu and Stammheim mas­sacres. Andreas, Gundrun, Karl, Ingmard and we ourselves are not surprised by the fascist theatrics of the imperialists, to destroy libera­tion movements. 
"We will never forget the blood spilled by Schmidt and the imper­ialists who support him. The battle has only begun. Liberty by armed anti-imperialist struggle.'' 
The references were to the German commando raid on a hijacked jet at Somalia's Mogadi­shu airport and to the subsequent deaths of three terrorists whose freedom from German jails had been demanded both by Schleyer's kidnappers and by the hijackers. 
United Way dinner at SMC Oct. 28 
An appreciation dinner to be held Friday Oct. 28 at St. Mary's College marks the dose of this year's $2.5 million United Way compaign. Indiana Governor Otis 
R. Bowen and Jrd District Con­gressman John Brademas will at­tend. Jack Colwell, political report­er for the South Bend Tribune will act as master of ceremonies. 
A cocktail party will be held at 6 
p.m. downstairs in the college's main dining hall with dinner up­stairs at 7 p.m. 
A final report by Unit and Division chairmen will be given and the 1977 campaign total announc­
ed. · 
Contest winners are announced 
The Student Union Acttvities Committee 1 announced yesterday, the winners of the Helen of Troy contest: First place, Gaelynn De Martino; second place, Jimmy Rice; and third place; Jim Sabitus. 
In the six weeks since Schleyer 
was  kidnapped  in  Cologne,  his  
captors set  several  deadlines  for  
the  West  German  goverment  to  

meet their deadline. These had passed without any action. 
Then last Thursday, four Arabic­speaking terrorists acting in appar­ent concert with the kidnappers hijacked a Lufthansa jetliner over the French Riviera and issued demands similar to those of the kidnappers. 
But the hijacking ended early Tuesday when specially trained German commandos stormed the jet at Mogadishu, killed three of the hijackers and rescued all 86 hostages aboard. The pilot had been murdered earlier. 
Hours after the raid was · an­nounced, West German officials reported that three of the terrorists whose freedom was demanded by the kidnappers and hijackers had killed themselves in their prison cells, and a fourth had tried to but survived. Leftists promptly sugges­ted the "suicides" were murders. 
The three dead were Andreas Baader, his girlfriend Gudrun Ens­slin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, and the surviving prisoner was Irmgard Moeller. · These were the four referred to in the Paris communi­que. 
All had been members of the Baader-Meinhof ultraleftist terror organization whose other co-leader 
· Ulrike Meinhof, was found hanged in her cell last year..

Bryant concert not sponsOred by University; not political

J 

' . 
( 
by Maureen Eyres 
Contrary to popular belief, Anita Bryant's concert to be held in the ACC on October 27, is not a University-sponsored event and, according to its promoter. Rev. Roy 
H. Anderson  of  Addiction Re­ 
habilitation. Inc., a  marriage  coun­ 
seling  service  in  Michigan  City,  

"the concert is not an intentional meeting of people to condemn homosexuality.'' 
Anderson stated that "Mrs. Bryant is not coming here because of her stand agaist homosexuality. She is coming here to give a concert, to do what she does best.'' He explamed, "her program will consist of religious music and patriotic music and will not turn into a political rally against the human rights of homosexuals. No 
one is prepared to change it into a pnlitical rally." 
•'The concert has no relation whatever with the Notre Dame Campus or the ACC sponsored events. Bryant was scheduled to be in the area, there was an open date at the ACC so we booked her appearance" Anderson em­phasized. 
Although Bryant does not carry her "campaign against homo­sexuality'' into her sacred concert, Anderson noted that people who attend the concert are either "in­quisitive, believe in what she stands for in her efforts to insure that homosexuality is considered an illegal offense in society, or like her music."· 
"However, the question of homosexuality is prevalent without being related to the concert,'' Anderson commented. Where 
CDC holds talk on law info 
by Honey McHugh 
Gloria Ybarra, a member of the Chicano Law Students Asociation of Harvard Law School and a 1975 graduate of St. Mary's , will conduct an information session for students interested in applying to Harvard Law School tomorrow from 1 to 3 p.m. in the SMC Career Development Center (CDC). Ybarra said her primary concern is in reaching students of various minority groups. The particular focus will be on women and such groups that have not previously ':Jeen represented in the law pro­fession. The session will attempt to supplement counseling of pre-law advisors, explain aspects of the study of law and the uses of a legal education and acquaint students with the admissions procedure at Harvard Law School. 
"The CDC actively supports women and minorities who wish to seek entry into the Jaw profesion," stated Karen O'Neil, director of the CDC. ''Students who see Ybarra· will have an opportunity not only to hear first hand about application procedures, but also to learn about the status of women in law schools across the country. 
The session Is open to all classes and students are encouraged to attend. Sign up sheets are avail· able in the CDC in LeMans Hall. 
GMAT dates indicated 
The Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) will be offered on November 5, 1977 and on January 28, March 18, and July 8, 1978. 
Registration materials for the test and the GMAT Bulletin of Information are available locally from Rm. 133, Hayes-Healy or by writing to GMAT, Educational Testing Service, Box 966, Prince­ton, New Jersey, 08540. 
people will support the concert of Anita Bryant, they support what she believes, the Bible's teaching against sodomy.'·' 
Although Anderson did not or­ganize the concert as a rally against homosexuality, he does support Bryant's stand. As Pastor of the Agape Christian Church of La Porte, Indiana he ''accepts the teaching of the Bible against sodomy.'' 
Anderson recently sent out let­ters to 400 churches in the Mic­hiana area urging the recipients to support the concert. The letter asked, "Haw fast can you run (to buy tickets)? Will you stand up for the Word of God, will you support this important • upcoming meeting (the concert) in our area?" 
Anderson denied that the letters were a political maneuver uniting people to use the concert as a rally against homosexuals. The Jetter was sent to participants in last years local program of "I found it" a ~eligious revival, he said. 
The concert has been referred to as a "hate rally" by Rev. Gary Starkey, pastor of Beulah Mission­ary Church of Elkhart. Anderson anwered Starkey's accusation by saying that ''bringing Anita Bryant here we are not causing hate. If people have hate it . is aleady there.'' 
Anderson added that the press presence of Bryant and her iden­tification with Save the Children, Inc. a group organized to fight anti-discrimination Jaws for homo­sexuals will cause people to make a decision of whether they • 'support homosexuality or accept the Bible's teaching against homosexuality. · People need to make this decision before the Equal Rights laws go into effect,'' Anderson said. 
The Michiana Coalition for Human Rights, a group supporting homosexual rights, has organized a reception for Bryant. Anderson stated that she will be unable to attend because of a full schedule before and after her performance.

One victory in the last ten meetings. That is the success rate of the Fighting Irish against the Trojans of USC since Notre Dame shellacked Southern Cal 51-0 in 1966. The one victory came in 1973, and the members of the Class of '78 were seniors in high school. FolJowing the 23·14 victory over John McKay's undefeated Trojans, the Irish went on to capture the National Championship. 
This year's seniors came in as young freshmen the following fall expecting great things during their four-year stay in the shadows ofthe Dome. Expected National Championships melted into injuries, sus­pensions, disappointing performances and difficult to explain upsets. Three autumns have transpired since that last championship season and there is a blemish on this year's campaign courtesy of Mississippi. 
But, the opportunity for redemption is here. Southern Cal is undoubtedly the classiest, most-tal­ented opponent on the Irish schedule. "Arch rivals" is almost understating the relationship between these two collegiate powers. A one-game season? ·Perhaps more than that. The game of their carreers 
for some member of the Class of '78. 
Southern Cal perennially is a very balanced team with talented people at the skill positions. Millions through television, and a sell-out crowd at Notre Dame Stadium will be treated to a classic battle between the nations number five ranked Trojans and 
the  number eleven rated  Irish.  Here is  how  the  
"match-up of the year" looks:  
When USC  has the ball:  Rushing  or  passing,  the  

Trojans are a threat as they have tallied 14 scores on the ground and eight through the air in compiling a 5-1 record. The USC tailback position has been held by many superstars among them O.J. Simpson and Ricky Bell. Charles White is the thoroughbred who occupies the heraldesJ position now and he runs in the mold of the greats who have preceeded him. White, only a sophomore, has rushed for 699 yeards and a 4.9 yard average so far. White's understudies, Dwight Ford and Lynn Cain have logged 570 yards between them and an impressive 6.7 yards per carry. Combined, the tailbacks have accounted for 12 of the 14 Trojan rushing touchdowns. 
At fullback is Mosi Tatupu who makes the most of his limited amount of carries averaging six yards per rush on 33 carries. The Samoan is known for his lead-blocking that clears the path for the speedsters behind him. 
Through the air, the Trojans are a dangerous bunch. Randy Simmrin is a wide receiver who should appear on everyone's All-America lists at season's end. Simmrin has snared 23 passes for 523 yards and four touchdowns. At flanker, Calvin Sweeney has 17 receptions good for 222 yards as all in alJ 10 Trojans have garnered two or more passes. Rob Hertel is the arm who hits these talented receivers at a completion rate of .570. In total, Hertel has 1,031 yards and has thrown but seven interceptions. 
Defensively, all phases of the Irish squad will be pressured. On the ground, a premium will be placed on pursuit as the Irish will counter the "student body" sweeps from the Trojan's power-1. Outside linebackers Steve Heimkrieter and Doug Becker have returned from injuries and Willie Fry should be ready for duty. With the defense intact again the Irish have the personnel to counter the Trojan's skilled people. Luther Bradley and Ted Burgmeier at the corners at

Six-Pointers 
when the charges of Dan Devine lined up in the !-formation. Notre Dame now has a multiple offense that utilizes the talent that has been latent thus far. Jerome Heavens was at his best Saturday and the offensive line is jelling. Joe Montana, plagued by the wind on long patterns in the first half, came on to hit five of seven tosses in the second half as the Irish controlled the ball for over twenty minutes. 
Defensively, the Trojans pay the vaunted 3-4 
defense  that  was  featured  in  the  recent  Sports  
lllustrated  cover  story.  Clay  Matthews  was  the  
Torjans' premier linebacker in  pre-season but the  
· 24-7 victory over Notre Dame in 1967. It was a record for interceptions by a Notre Dame opponent. 


honorable mention All-America has been replaced by junior Garry Cobb. This is indicative of the budding talent amid the stars on the Trojan defensive unit. 
Dennis Thurman is the All-American in the defensive backfield, occupying the free safety position. Last year he led the nation in interception return yardage with 170 yards on eight thefts. On the front lines, Walt Underwood spearheads the Trojan efforts ranking third in tackles and is responsible for seven tackles-for-losses of 51 yards. Specialists: Dave Reeve just keeps on rolling as he has hit on 75% of his three-point tries. Joe Restic has upped his punting average each week and is now at 36.1. 
Marty King handles the punting chores for USC and is averaging 39.2 yards per kick. Placement specialist Frank Jordan has eight of 10 field goal attempts and one of the misses was an over SO-yard attempt. Both teams have skill in their specialists. Intangibles: The Irish know what they have to do if they are to get back into the National title picture--win convincingly. With the new formations the Irish offense is anything but predictable. The Notre Dame defense has yet to yield a rushing touchdown and has not allowed a six-pointer in two games. The Irish will be tactically prepared for the Trojans. 
John Robinson will be making his first appearance as a head coach in Notre Dame Stadium. The Men of Troy will be ready to do battle. Robinson ha8 the fire-power offensively to put the Irish defense's denial of rushing touchdowns in jeopardy. Through the air, USC certainly has momentum-shifting, big-play capability. Both teams are awesome on paper and should be equally as impressive on the field. 
So what will decide the game? Field position will go a long way to providing an outcome on Saturday. . When a team is pinned deep in its own territory part of its offense is take away by the nearness to the end zone. Both defenses may bend but they will rarely break. It is the team that can force the big turnover deep in the opponent's territory that will enjoy a big advantage. 
Notre Dame has yet to score in the first quarter this year. The Trojan defense has not allowed a point in the first half thus far. The first score will be a big score on Saturday. It the Irish get on the board first it will add fuel to the fire raging amid the partisan crowd. A quick score by the Trojans will have just the opposite effect on the crowd, that of an extinguisher. 
When the emotions die, talent takes over. On Saturday, the talent will be equally divided on both sides of the line of scrimmage. Both teams have the makings of explosive offenses. Both have superior defenses. So, the difference very well may be the emotions. The mysterious twelfth man, "momentum", will be the deciding factor.

the game to instill the killer instinct in the Notre Dame players and fans. Larry Conjar was certainly motivated as he gained 116 yards, 73 more than Heisman Trophy winner Garrett, and scored four touchdowns in Notre Dame's con­vincing national television victory. 
The Irish were easily motivated the next season when they defeated USC 51-0 in Los Angeles, the worst defeat in !USC history. The Irish knew a sizeable win would assure them of a '·national championship. They were in virtual deadlock for .:.e crown with Michigan State before the game after their historic 10-10 tie that season. 
Coley O'Brien, in the only start at quarterback of his Notre Dame career, hit an amazing 21-31 passes for 255 yards and three touchdowns in the Irish victory. The Monday morning after the game Notre Dame easily out-distanced the Spartans in the polls and claimed its eighth national title. 
USC took the title away from the Irish the following year. A 24-7 Trojan win in South Bend, their first victory at Notre Dame since 1939, was a pivotal win in the championship season. A then relatively unknown junior co11ege transfer led the Trojans that day with 150 yards in 38 carries. Adrian Yound set a record for a Notre Dame opponent by intercept­ing four passes. 
O.J. and the Trojans were head­ed for a second national title in 1968. Simpson was averaging over 180 yards a game and was a shoo-in for the Heisman Trophy. Notre Dame was 7-2 and had lost All­American quarterback Terry Han­ratty. But this year the Irish introduced the star of the future. Sophomore quarterback Joe Theis­mann, 170 pounds only when dripping wet led the Irish to a 21~ 
halftime  lead  over  the  stunned  
Trojans.  Sparked  by  two-time  
captain Bob Olsen,  the Irish de­ 

tense held Simpson to but 55 yards in 21 carries, but, gave up two scores in the second half, as Steve Sogge effectively went to the air. Scott Hempel failed on a last minute 34-yard field goal try and the Irish had to settle for 21-21 a "winning tie." 
The two teams again. in 1969 this ~ime at 14-14. Once again Hempel was involved in a chance to break the deadlock. Joe 11teisman led the Irish on a fourth quarter drive with his jitterbug style of running and his accurate aerials. The Trojans finally held and Hempel was called in to attempt the game winner. His 48-yard attempt, which would have been the longest of his career, hit the crossbar and bounced back on the field. 
In 1970 Notre Dame was a perfect 9-0 heading into the Coli­seum contest. But a torrential downpour caused sloppy turnovers and the 5-4-1 Trojans registered the most shocking upset of the series, 38-28. Joe Theismann put on an incredible passing perfor­mance in the monsoon conditions hitting a Notre Dame record 33 of 
58 aerials for 526 yards. Unfortun­ately for the Irish, his heroics could not negate a potent USC offense and two Trojan touchdowns by lineman on recoveries in the Notre Dame endzone. 
If Theismann's 1970 individual performance was incredible how do you describe the touchdown explo­sion of Anthony Davis in the 1972 score-a-thon. The slippery sopho­more crossed the Notre Dame goal line six times, including two on long kickoff returns in the 45-23 Trojan win. It was a key victory in the Trojan's national title season. 
Two years later Davis scored 26 more points, all within a 17 minute period, to lead the Trojans to a mystifying 55-24 conquest of the Irish. Notre Dame had taken an apparently insurmountable 24-0 lead, but a Davis score just before the half and a 93 yard touchdown run with the opening kickoff of the second half ingnited the greated touchdown explosion of the series. This win helped lift the Trojans to their fourth national title under John McKay. 
In between the Davis-dominated games was the 1973 contest in South Bend. Irish fans wanted revenge for the six touchdown embarrassment of the year before by the brash sophomore. Davis was hung in effigy from dormitor­ies and his picture was plastered aU over campus like a wanted poster in a post office. 
The Notre Dame defense was also committed to stopping the diminutive scatback, who scored 11 touchdowns against Notre Dame in his career. But this day belonged to another gifted back, Eric Penick. The 9.5 speedster provided the key play of the game when he reaced 85 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter. 
Meanwhile the Notre Dame front-four was limiting Davis to 55 yards and freshman Luther Bradley was holding the Trojan passing attack to minor completions. Bradley had one of the best days a Notre Dame defensive back has ever had as he intercepted two passes, broke up 4 others, forced a fumble and recovered another. 
The last two confrontations be­tween USC and Notre Dame have not had a major bearing on the national title, but have not lacked excitement. Both games were decided by a touchdown or less. Rickey Bell keyed the 1975, 24-17 Trojan win with 160 yards in a record 40 carries. Last year Bell was held to less than four yards a

carry, but behind a big play offense quarterbacked by Vince Evans, USC prevailed 17-13.

But USC made some halftime adjustments.: and slowly cut into the Notre Dame lead. Mike Garrett scored in the third quarter to bring the Trojans to within 10. The Irish

NO-USC to combat in classic battle 

by Paul Stevenson Sports Editor 
The Fighting Irish football team returns to the . confines of Notre Dame Stadium on Saturday after playing four out of their first five contests on the road to entertain the Trojans of the University of Southern California. 
The 51 year old series finds the Irish holding a 26-18-4 margin in the rivalry, however, Notre Dame has only emerged victorious in one out of the last ten clashes. 
The Trojans enter the battle with a 5-1 ledger. Southern Cal's only loss was to Alabama, 21-20, two weeks ago at the Coliseum. Last week, the Trojans defeated the Oregon Ducks.

P.S. 
Mentioning Notre Dame and Southern Cal in one breath, creates visions of one of the most spectacular intercollegiate rivalries in gridiron history. Although the Irish maintain a 28-16-4 edge in the series which started in 1926, Notre Dame has only been able to defeat Southern Cal once in the last ten years. 
In 1973, the year the Irish eventually became National Champions, Notre Dame defeated the Trojans 23-14. In 1968 the Irish managed a 21-21 tie, while in the following year, Notre Dame matched the Trojans 
r/ 
again, this time at 14. 
Thus, over the past ten years, after their victory in 1966, the Irish have tied the Trojans twice and defeated them once. The past three years, which have been part of the senior Notre Dame gridders career, have all 
been losing efforts. 
Notre Dame looked to be an easy victor in 1974, leading 24-6 at halftime, but fell 55-24 in the end. Anthony Davis was instrumental in the Trojans 49 point comeback after intermission. 
In 1975, the Trojans visited Notre Dame Stadium. However, with the l ,· Irish leading 17-14 in the fourth quarter, USC rallied for a 24-17 triumph.

"They're a typical Southern Cal team," Head Coach Dan Devine
/ !-­
/ ~. remarked. "They have great people at the skilled positions." Yes, the Trojans will be an unbelievable challenge for the Irish. This is a tremendous rivalry and opponents have a tendency to play superbly against Notre Dame, especially Southern Cal. 
In Devine's last year at Missouri, 1970, his Tiger squad had the 
! .· ~ 
opportunity to play the Irish. The contest was emotional and one that his team was able to prepare for mental1y rather easily. That was Devine's only losing season as a college coach. The team was plagued with injuries. The Tigers lost 24-7. . 
"I know what it's like to prepare for Notre Dame," the Irish mentor stated. "Our team over achieved more in that game than any team I've ever coached. The final score was lopsided, but it was only 3-0 at halftime. In fact, we went ahead of Notre Dame 7-3 in the third quarter. But that's what it's like when you play Notre Dame. Teams have a tendency to play over their head." 
Getting prepared for the Irish may be an easy task mentally, but physically, it is extremely difficult. When two teams are emotionally high, talent may be the deciding factor. However, when two teams, like Notre Dame and Southern Cal, are both blessed with a great amount of talent, then the team which makes the fewest mistakes and take advantage of

Cal mentor. The Trojan head coach has only experienced one game in South Bend, that being in 1973 when the Irish won 23-14. Robin­son was John McKay's offensive coordinator at the time. 
Southern Cal is led by quarter­back Rob Hertel, a 6-2 185 pound senior. Hertel has connected on 66 out of 116 pass attempts, while suffering only seven interceptions. In contrast to his 57 percent aerial completion mark, Hertel has run the ball18 times for a negative 51 yards. 
When evaluating the Trojans, one has to think of the spectacular tailbacks they have had throughout their history. This season is no exception as the Trojans boast three fine rushing specialists. Charles White had 11 touchdowns last year as a freshman. This year, the hascornpiled 699 yards in 144 attempts for a 4.9 yard per carry average. 
Dwight Ford is just as capable as White, as the junior runner has racked up 331 yards in only 46 attempts, a 7.2 average. The third Trojan tailback is Lynn Cain. Cain has rushed for 237 yards in 38 tries, a rate of 6.2 yards per attempt. 
The Trojans definitely have three very capable tailbacks, all with great speed and all with the ability to get to the outside. One interesting note is that all three of the Trojan backs have four touch­downs this season. 
Mosi Tatupu fulfills the fullback chores for Southern Cal. The six foot senior has a 5.9 yard per carry average, having run for 196 yards in only 33 attempts. 
When Hertel puts the ball in the air he will most likely be looking for split end Randy Simmrin. Simmrin has caught 23 aerials for 523 yards and a 22.7 average. The senior receiver has notched four touch­downs. 
Flanker Calvin Sweeney, who was red-shirted in 1976, has snag­ged 17 receptions for 222 yards and two touchdowns. Tight end Bill throughout the 1977 campaign. 
Defensively, the Trojans are led by inside linebacker Dennis John­son. The 230 pound sophomore leads the team in tackles with 53. Assisting Johnson at the other linebacking position is Garry Cobb. Cobb captured the starting role by replacing Clay Mathews. 
Mathews was first team All-Pac­8 and honorable mention All­American last season..Cobb has registered SO tackles in the 1977 season. 
In his third straight year as starting tackle, Playboy AD-Ameri­can Walt Underwood places rank third on the team tackle list. The 6-4 senior has 34 tackles on the season. 
The matchup is only two days away. Every season, this game ends up being the clash of the year. 
As Fred Rothenberg, an AP Sports Writer stated, "These teams are not geographical rivals like Georgia and Georgia Tech or Texas and Oklahoma. It isn't an annual conference clash like Michigan and Ohio State, a battle of military macho like Army and Navy or of intellectual elitism, i.e., 
''It merely is a game between two giants of college football, whose alumni can remember more good football than the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will ever play." 
The Notre Dame andSouthernCal battle is a tremendous rivalry, one that will be relived Saturday for the forty-ninth time. The kickoff is slated for 12:50 South Bend time. The contest will be televised nationally on the ABC television network with coverage beginning at 12:30.

football fans will be watching this classic matchup. All of the bowl committees will be present. The Orange Bowl labels this clash as their game of the week. Notre Dame has a 4-lledger, but their only ranked opponent has been Pittsburgh. The Trojans schedule has not been extremely difficult, with the exception of Alabama. Saturday will make or break the season for one of these two teams. If there is any hope for a National Title for either team, they have to win this weekend. The Irish have a solid defense against the rush, however, their pass defense has been sporatic. The Trojans almost rebounded from their 21-6 deficit against Alabama two weeks ago. The Irish must have a strong pass rush to stop Rob Hertel. Hertel has not been effective with the run, losing 51 yards in his first six games. If the Notre Dame defense maintains pressure on Hertel and have their rushing defense up to their usual standard, they will emerge victorious. The Irish offense will have to score however, especially against a stingy Trojan defense which has not allowed a point to be scored on them in the fist half all season. The emotion rapped around this one game might truly decide the outcome. The senior gridders have never defeated Southern Cal and the Trojans could set a team record against the Irish if they win this fourth straight against Notre Dame. However, the Irish should rise to the challenge and defeat the fifth rated Trojans by 7. O'Keefe backs Notre Dame by 8. Houston at Arkansas: The Razorbacks fell to a tough 
. Texas squad last weekend, 13-9. Tomorrow, they will have another great battle when they tackle the Cougars. This game will be close throughout all four quarters. Houston is coming off a victory over Southern Methodist, while the Hogs will be attempting to rebound from last Saturday's loss. The game, which is being played inLittle Rock, will be hard-fought, but give this matchup to Arkansas by 3. O'Keefe eyes the Razorbacks by 3. Kentucky at Georgia: The Wildcats have been playing exceptional football. Meanwhile, Georgia ahs not been able to live up to last year's standards. The game will be tougher for Kentucky, being in Athens, but, the Wildcats should be able to triumph. So, give this battle to the Wildcats by 6. O'Keefe backs Kentucky by 7. South Carolina at North Carolina: The Tarheels have demonstrated their ability to play football this season. Meanwhile, the Gamecocks were kind enough to lose to Mississippi in order to preserve Ken Cooper's job. South Carolina may be looking to rebound, but Chapel Hill is not the place they will succeed. Look for the Tarheels to capture this battle by 3. O'Keefe follows South Carolina by 4. Iowa State at Oklahoma: The Sooners, after losing to Texas two weeks ago, put on a bad showing at Missouri last Saturday. Iowa State upset Nebraska last weekend, but will have a difficult time pulling off back to back upsets. Oklahoma should be able to handle they Cyclones without much difficulty. So, give this matchup to the Sooners as they knock the wind out of the Cyclones by 10. O'Keefe looks for Oklahoma by 12. Ohio State at Northwestern: The Buckeyes proved to proved they were championship caliber by defeating Oklahoma and Arkansas on consecutive weekends. Both teams were unbeaten before they faced Texas. Now, the Mustangs will have their shot. After two televised games, the Longhorns will probably be at an emotional low, but, they will not have any problems with SMU. So, give this clash to Texas by 14. O'Keefe backs the Longhorns by 20. Colorado at Nebraska: The Buffalos and the Cornhuskers, what a combination. This will be quite a game for the Big Eight. The Corn huskers were shocked by Iowa State last Saturday, while Colorado was tied by Kansas. Both squads will be looking to rebound from last weekend's surprises. However, the Cornhuskers will have an edge in front of their home town fans. So, five this battle to Nebraska by 3. O'Keefe looks for the Cornhuskers by 6. North Carolina State at Oemson: The Tigers have had a great season, having logged a 5-1 ledger thus far, and have been ranked twentieth in the AP pol. The Wolfpack has not been overly impressive. This contest will be on Clemson's home turf. The fans do not know what to think, seeing their team rebound from a 3-6-2 season in 1976. This game will be close, but look for Clemson to be 6-1 after Saturday as the Tigers will be victorious by 6. O'Keefe goes with North Carolina State by 12. Louisville at Alabama: The Crimson Tide has been cruising along after their upset victory over the Trojans. 
The Cardinals will not be the team that stops Bear Bryant and Company from chalking up another victory. Look for the Tide to keep on rolling as Alabama captures this confrontation by 17. O'Keefe follows the Crimson Tide by 7. California at UCLA: The Golden Bears have been having a rather successful year. Meanwhile, things around the Bruin's campus have not been too spectacular. UCLA has been having their problems throughout the 1977 campaign. The Bruins were supposed to have had the best recruiting year in the country, but even the freshmen cannot fill all the gaps. The Golden Bears have been a tough squad, but UCLA is too good a team to scrap this season for a loss. Look for the Bruins to win this matchup by 3. O'Keefe goes with California by 5. Michigan at Minnesota: Well, last weekend Wisconsin proved that there S-0 record meant that they were undefeated, untied and unproven. Michigan 56, Wisconsin 0, that's some upset. However, although there is a desire to call this game as another upset, after last week's pick, something inside is saying no.
