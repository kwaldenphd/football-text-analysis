COLD WARM STATIONARY 

INSIDE COLUMN 



SUFR's demands need more thought 
I have reservations--------­in writing this column because I know there is a trend that calls for anyone who criti­cizes minority groups to be labeled a racist, and anyone who crit­icizes women's 
. groups to be labeled a Florentine Hoelker misogynist. God for-. 
bid anyone Assoc. News Ed1tor criticize both groups at once, for they surely 
must be a racially-biased chauvinistic misogynist. Being a white male, I am espe­cially at risk. 
The Students United For Respect (SUFR) have recently released a number of demands to be addressed by the ND Administration concerning minority students' needs. Many of the demands are more than justified, and I have nothing but respect for the group for rattling the administration. In one case, I agree with the group's assessment that the admil).istration has little excuse for taking so long to formulate a racial harassment policy, and I applaud SUFR's demand that one be made-soon. 
The call for increased financial aid is of concern to all students, and SUFR's re­quirement that more commitment be made to minority students' financial needs is valid. I hope, however, that the University doesn't target minorities only for aid. I know people who, having been "caught in the middle," are over $30,000 in debt for pnly four years of school. The issue is ·not exclusive. 
However, other demands approach the ludicrous. SUFR wants a commitment to build a multi-cultural center which includes office space, lounge space, an auditorium, library space, and study rooms. I think it absurd that this group wants its own build­ing when the University still sometimes lacks adequate classroom space and is just now completing enough academic buildings so that 40 students aren't cramped into a room that seats 30. 
A related demand states "Because Theodore's is ours as students, we expect the freedom to utilize Theodore's for events without D.J. or monetary restrictions." Who is the "we?" Any minority group? Would the Hawaiian club be able to use Theodore's for free? Would it be only for minority groups? 
The dates for all of the group's demands are also unrealistic. Most are for March 19, 1991. That's only two months from now. They want Theodore's and new club space by February 6. 
But the most disturbing thing is the clos­
ing of the list of demands, which reads 
"Until each of these demands are met we, 
Students United For Respect, will consider 
ourselves disrespected by the University of 
Notre Dame and will act accordingly." What 
does this mean, to "act accordingly?" Is it a 
threat to act in whatever way they see fit so 
that their demands are met? 
If it is a threat, it is thinly veiled and un­
wisely placed. If these students want re­
spect they should exercise their demands 
with temperance and avoid putting threats 
where they will do little but harm.

The heavy metal band AC-DC on Tues­day denied witness accounts that it continued to perform while three teen-age fans were being crushed to death by a surging concert crowd in Salt Lake City."Nothing could be further from the truth," the band said in a statement. Two 14­year-old boys and a 19-year-old woman were trampled when they apparently lost their footing Friday night as the crowd rushed the stage at Salt Palace when the music began.· Autopsies showed they died from compression asphyxiation. A number of fans reported the band continued to play despite chants of "stop the concert" from the crowd.

BEIJING (AP) -A half-dozen human rights activists left China on Tuesday for Hong Kong after they were ordered out of the country. 
The six, who were attempting to attend the trials of pro­democracy demonstrators, left China without incident six hours before the government's evening deadline. 
One of those deported, uni­versity student Fong Tak Ho, said the group had gone to the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office in Beijing trying to find out how they could attend the trials and to relay rights con­cerns to Chinese officials. 
Earlier Monday, the rights activists who were told to leave were detained for five hours and questioned about their ac­tivities in Beijing. 
Norman Quan, a Chinese passport-holder now living in Los Angeles, was told without elaboration that he had violated China's laws. Five other activists from Britain, Canada and the Netherlands were ac­cused of engaging in activities incompatible with their status as tourists. 

The activists arrived in Bei­jing on Thursday to try to at­tend trials of the leaders of the 1989 democracy movement, which was crush1~d by the Chi­nese army, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people. 
The group had made several trips to the Beijing city court where the democracy activists are being tried. Court officials told them foreigners had no right to attend trials. 
They also met with officials of the national legislature, the Justice Ministry and the Public Security Bureau to express their concern that trials be fair and open. 
A Roman Catholic priest from Mauritius joined the group on Sunday. He was detained with the others for a few hours be­fore being released with a warning not to violate his tourist visa.

Pope urges an increase in  
efforts to spread teachings  

VATICAN CITY (AP) -Pope John Paul II on Tuesday urged more aggressive efforts to spread church teachings in the Third World and cautioned Roman Catholics against the belief that "one religion is as good as another." 
Catholics "cannot be content when we consider the millions of our brothers and sisters ... who live in ignorance of the love of God," he said in the eighth encyclical of his 12-year­old papacy, titled "Redemptoris Missio" -Latin for "Mission of the Redeemer." 
The document addresses the church's relationships with other creeds and philosophies at a time of considerable ten­sions between Christian and Is­lamic cultures in some parts of the world. 
It is the church's first major statement on missionary work in a quarter-century. Since then, the number of potential converts has doubled, the pope said, with the missionaries' biggest tasks in Africa, Latin America and Asia. 
To emphasize concern that missionary zeal was diminish­ing, the pope laid out his strat­egy in the encyclical, one of the most authoritative forms a pa­pal pronouncement can take. 
"Missionary activity ... ap­pears to be waning," the pope wrote in the document, ad­dressed to Roman Catholics worldwide. He warned faithful not to succumb "to the belief that one religion is as good as another." 
The pope referred to the ap­proaching SOOth anniversary of Columbus' 1492 discovery of America, which at that time opened up a new front for con­versions. 
At several points in the en­cyclical. the pope emphasized the need to respect freedom of religion as well as to continue dialogue with other faiths. 
"The church proposes; she imposes nothing," the pope 
wrote. 

In an apparent reference to religious workers who espouse liberation theology, the pope said it was an error to portray missionary work "as if it con­sisted principally in helping the poor, contributing to the liber­ation of the oppressed, promot­ing development or defending human rights." 
"The missionary church is certainly involved on these fronts but her primary task lies elsewhere: the poor are hungry for God, not just for bread and freedom," the pope said. 
The church has been harshly critical of liberation theology, which, rooted in Marxist phi­losophy, teaches the poor to fight for their rights. 
John Paul said one new front for missionaries was the wave of non-Christian emigrants and refugees arriving in predomi­nantly Christian countries. 
While the pope did not name the countries, in the past he has spoken of Italy's refugee problem. Overwhelmingly Catholic Italy has been flooded with hundreds of thousands of immigrants, mostly Muslims from Africa and Asia. 
Among the church's chal­lenges, he said, was the popu­larity of cults and sects. The pope has previously expressed worry over the predominance of sects in mostly Catholic countries such as Brazil 
He also noted the challenge posed to missionaries by the collapse of Communist regimes in 1989 in Eastern Europe, where an entire generation grew up in a society that sup­pressed or outlawed religion. 
Church officials said Tuesday that more than 500,000 mis­sionaries were at work world­wide. Over the last 50 years. they said, hundreds of mission­aries have been killed -on av­erage more than one per month. The highest rate of slayings among religious work­ers was in Africa, they said.

ND officials 'confused' following minority ruling 
By L. PETER VOB Assistant News Editor 
ND officials are "concerned" and "confused" following an Education Department ruling last December giving universi­ties four years to review their minority scholarship programs. 
The ruling, issued by Michael Williams, assistant secretary for civil rights, would prohibit colleges from using general school funds for scholarships that are reserved for minorities. After a public outcry the ruling was modified by the Bush administration. 
Joe Russo, Notre Dame direc­tor of financial aid, said that the Bush Administration has made several attempts to clarify the policy, but that their current position remains ·confused. 
Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, schools are not allowed to discriminate based on race, Russo explained. Although the source of much controversy, one interpretation of this Act is that it prohibits scholarships reserved for members of cer­tain minority groups. 
Russo pointed out that Title 
IX of the Higher Education Act 
of 1965 encourages universities ·to take affirmative action steps. "Competing directives need to be reviewed," Russo said. 
Despite the confusion, Russo said that "we are comfortable with what we are doing," in this area at ND. According to Russo, no scholarships that are race exclusive are offered through the office of financial aid. "No decision (regarding fi­nancial aid) is made solely on race," he said. 
"All financial assistance awarded by the office (of finan­cial aid) includes as an essential factor the demonstration of financial need, as demonstrated through national needs analysis agencies and reviewed by Notre Dame's office of financial aid," Russo said. Under this policy, no aid given at ND is jeopar­dized by the recent government rulings. 

Russo said that the "university is attempting to in­crease the representation of minorities." "Many minorities who apply and are accepted are needy," he added. 
Russo noted improvement in minority representation at ND over the last three years. 
Kenneth Durgans, director of minority affairs at ND, said that he is "concerned that this is another signal from the Bush Administration that correcting past wrongs is not a priority." 
Durgans believes that a result of these rulings may be lawsuits alleging that scholarships reserved for minorities is dis­criminatory. These lawsuits may eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court, an idea that Durgens said leads to "concern" and "skepticism" within the African American community. 
'There was some concern in the graduate school," he said, "students didn't know if it ap­plied to them." 
Durgans noted that universi­ties weren't initiating any com­plaints to create this kind of government action. "This was out of the blue." 
Durgans said that "education is under attack as far as diver­sity is concerned." He said he wondered what is the motiva­tion behind this policy. 
"Minority scholarships are such a minute part of the bud­get," he said "that when you at­tack these things you are going out of your way to block the progress of minorities as they pursue higher education." 
Russo said that he was pleased with the appointment of Lamar Alexander as the new Secretary of Education. Russo said that Alexander's position is that he will not discuss this, but "early on he made a statement that he likes to approach situations like this with a warm heart and a lot of common sense."

New program developed to aid in SMC job searching 

By CORINNE PAVLIS Saint Mary's Editor 
Thn Saint Mary's Counsnling & Carnm Dnvelopment Center (C & CDC) has completed a pro­jl~ct aimed at making alumnae rwtworking and job searching nasier for Saint Mary's stu­cllmts. 
Together with the Office of Alurnnan Hnlalions and the Saint Mary's Computer Ser­viens, the C & CDC will debut Alumnae Hesource Network (AHN) during the first week of Fnbruary. 
Kan~n Kyln, a Carner Coun­selor at the C & CDC, dnscribnd tlw program as "a computer program that allows students to identify and view information on alumnae career paths as well as to id1111tify alumnae willing to talk to them about jobs, careers, graduate school, and more generally the job s1~arch process." 
Kyle has been counseling for thrne and a half years and is primarily responsible for the network. Kyle contacted Sys­tnms Analyst Lorena Bidwell of Saint Mary's Computer Services to produce the software Kyle designed. 
Kyle described the program as easy to use in that it is menu-driven. She stressed that no previous knowledge of the Zenith system the ARN is based on is necessary to access the Network. Informational book­lets are available to guide stu­dents in a step by step manner through use. 
Kyle discussed that many Saint Mary's students come to her asking what types of career paths have been taken by previous graduates in their majors. The new AHN will make answering this frequently asked question easier. 
The ARN allows students to research what graduates in particular majors have gone on to do after leaving Saint Mary's. Profiles on graduates include their occupation, entry position, job history, and what they are doing now. A portion of the profiles include the names, phone numbers and addresses of alumnae who are willing to be contacted with questions. 
Bidwell explained that fields of study while at Saint Mary's is just one of many ways to ini­tiate a search with the Net­work. Users can also call upon particular occupations alumnae now hold. Bidwell described this as the most "exciting" aspect of the program. Students can view files on graduates in positions they find interesting and trace individual career paths. 
In addition to dividing the po­sitions held by alumnae into various careers, the program further categorized the posi­tions by level. Bidwell explained how this is particularly helpful to those researching managerial type positions which vary greatly in level from job to job. 
Geographic area is another option. Students can access in­formation pertaining to careers of alumnae living in a particu­lar city and state. This feature allows students to locate how many alumnae hold various po­sitions in almost any area of the country. 
Students considering the graduate school path will also be helped by the ARN. Informa­tion concerning graduate edu­cation is another feature of the system. Information concern­ing in what part of the country alumnae are studying, what types of degrees they are pur-

Dame Room (2Qff floor), 
suing and in what subject, as well as particular institutions Saint Mary's graduates have gone on to attend, is available in many of the profiles. 
Although these profiles are initially aimed at aiding current students in their post-graduate pursuits, it is hoped that it will also play a key role in alumna to alumna networking. "The Alumnae Association Board of Directors, which is an eighteen member board of graduates who act as advisors have been interested in such a program for the last three or four years," said Adeline Cashore, Director of Alumnae Relations. 
Cashore explained that the Board was interested in devel­oping some sort of networking program for Saint Mary's graduates. "In pursuing this they discovered that the Kyle was also interested in setting up a computerized data base where students could access alumnae information," added Cashore. "The alumnae Board has been instrumental in work­ing with Kyle and Bidwell in getting input from all of the different sources." 
The Alumnae Relations office worked with the Board to de­velop an "Alumnae Verification Form" to send out to the more that 16,000 active alumnae. The form requests information concerning graduate work, job history, spouses, and children. 
The form also asks alumnae if they would be willing to par­ticipate in ARN. Those inter­ested are sent a follow-up ques­tionnaire concerning education and employment history. Re­spondents even code their ca­reers into particular categories. Those willing to provide inter­ested students with their names, phone numbers, and addresses indicate so on the form. 
The office began sending out this form last January. Cashore described the program as still being "young". Initial projections indicate that approximately two years will be necessary to reach all alumnae. Alumnae receive this form every two years as well as whenever the office is contacted by the graduate concerning specific changes. 
Besides helping with gathering the necessary information, the Alumnae Office also donated funds. The Class of 1985, for example, donated $2,765 for the necessary hardware. 
Bidwell has been working on the design of the software since Oct. of 1990. With the help of two other staff members the program was designed entirely "in house". "The initial program is a simple one and as time goes by we will decide what types of features need to be added," said Bidwell. The database will continue to ex­pand throughout the life of the system. 
The C & CDC hopes that stu­dents will use this system, the libraries of information available at the Career Resource Center, SIGI Plus-Another computerized database of career information­as well as conducting informational interviews with a variety of professionals to develop a realistic picture of graduate school, a career filed, or the job market. 
The ARN will be available to student during the first week of Feb. on Tuesdays and Wednes­days from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Those who wish to try the Network should go to the C & CDC located in LeMans Hall.

Talhami: Leave Arab world alone 
By MEGAN JUNIUS 
News Writer 
What began as a simple bor­der dispute has lead to Ameri-. can intervention in the Arab world, "We want the West to leave us alone," according to Prof. Ghada Talhami, a native Palestinian currently a profes­sor at Lake Forest College. 
Even if the United States Mili­tary forces overcome those of Saddam Hussein, the United States must face the facts that Arab nationalism will continue to strive for the dream of join­ing together the Arab states, Talhami said. 
Along with Talhami, Father Gaffney, Prof. of Anthropology at Notre Dame and Kelly Reuba, the campus coordinator of Amnesty International, spoke Tuesday evening on the Historical and Cultural Aspects of the Crisis, the second of four lectures sponsored by the Gulf Crisis Action Group. 
Both Talhmi and Gaffney stressed legitimate goals which the Arabs hope to achieve throughout the Gulf War. First, Talhami said, "Arabs should have control over their own re­sources; Arabs should control Arab oil." 
Next, they want to put an end to the long-standing differences between the Arab states. The rights of the non-Jewish people of Palestine need to be restored, Talhami said. 
According to Talhami, im­mediate citizenship to Israel is given to persons with Jewish relations. In contrast, Pales­tinians are not given these op­portunities, "We have a right to our homeland." 
The United States, until re­cently, has not been consistent with their views, Gaffney said. In the late 1980s, Congressional measures allowed Hussein to borrow money. "It looks as the United States did approve in his previous actions. We did not do anything about it," Gaffney said. "The entire situation is one of great military tragedy, great cost and great personal suffering." 

In contrast to the first two speakers, Kelly Reuba spoke not of haulting United States intervention in the war, but of the Iraqis violating human rights. 
According to statistics docu­mented by Amnesty Interna­tional, Iraqis have been holding people in detention without trial, torturing people for no legitimate reason, and execut­ing civilians and children. Iraq has taken over all newspapers and television stations in Kuwait. 

According to Reuba, Amnesty wants the Iraqi government to stop carrying out executions, killings of children, and to in­vestigate why this is happening. "We must put an end to these abuses," she said. 
Tonight, the Gulf Crisis Action Group continues its four part series with "The Gulf War: Where Do We Go From Here?'' This lecture takes place at 7:30

' 
,' Gaffney: War in Gulf could become prolonged conflict 
r r By BRADLEY GALKO 
r Assistant News Editor r 
r 
Father Patrick Gaffney, pro­

r 
f fessor of anthropology who teaches a course on the modern Middle East, believes the war in the Gulf could turn into a pro­longed conflict. "I hoped it would never start . 
.. now I hope it doesn't esca­late," said Gaffney, "That's my feeling on the subject. My head tells me it will last quite a while-maybe months-a thought I don't find very ap­pealing." 
"The Iraqis are tough cus­tomers," warned Gaffney, "casualties and destruction will follow." He also said he is not as confident as some in the "bravado of air strikes" that have dominated recent news reports and feels a ground war could be costly. 
As for what students con­cerned about the war can do, Gaffney said, "I think being in­formed is one thing instead of getting wrapped up in the pro­paganda. Resist the preoccupa­tion with war as excitement, as euphoric, victory as the only thing." 
He said students should "keep solidarity with the troops. They should never be made scapegoats." 
"This policy of the govern­ment, they shouldn't have to answer for," he said, "we all have to answer for it." He en­courages students to "go public with what you feel about war generally." 
Gaffney also reminds stu­dents to resist anti-Arab bigotry and racism at all times. 
"Remember Arabs are on our side," he said, referring to Arab nations in the Coalition against Iraq such as Syria and Egypt. 
In trying to gauge public sen­timent Gaffney said, "My guess is ... the support for this (war) is broad but thin." He added that "the most dramatic event that will probably cause (a de­crease in support) is casual­ties." 
In response to the question of future Israeli action, he said, "I am surprised and appreciative that Israel has restrained it­self." However, he added, "I think Israel is going to go after them (Iraqis)." 
He says the dilemma is a question of proportionality for Israel now. They must ask themselves whether a few Is­raeli civilian casualties or even deaths constitute a full scale retaliation. 
He also cautioned that if Is­rael continues to appease the United States by refraining from retaliation, it "can then make demands on the United States in return." One such de­mand might be aid in delaying discussion of the Palestinian question, he said. 
When asked what he would do if he were in President Bush's place, Gaffney said, "I would get the diplomatic initia­tive back in place ... to initiate an intra-Arab dialogue and move this from an American­driven military conflict to a problem that the Arab World has to face on their own." 
He said that he sees such an initiative as the most hopeful way the war could be resolved "without threatening, continu­ing destruction and potential disaster." 
Gaffney also warns that the United States military actions could only serve to restore in­stability in the region. 
"If (the Coalition countries) batter Iraq into submission, and destroy its infrastructure .. . they will leave a power vac­uum in the region that Syria would love to fill, or Turkey, or Iran. 
There's no inherent logic in a return to unbalance (after) the one bully who is recent on our block (loses power)." said Gaffney in reference to Sad­dam. 
On the question of the future of Kuwait, Gaffney said that the Kuwaiti government has a commission that has been working all fall on planning for the "new Kuwait." 
"I think that the new Kuwaiti scene sees the old Emir back on the throne and the old elites re­turning to power and perhaps a little openness which was not there before," he said. How­ever, he added that the Kuwaitis are not eager for rad­ical changes. 

One change he anticipates is either an increased military buildup or friendlier relations with a superpower for greater protection of Kuwait in the fu­ture. 
Gaffney feels the Arab reac­tion to the United States' mili­tary intervention in the area is divided. "I have often spoken of this as an Arab civil war," he said, "there are all kinds of po­sitions on a sliding scale." 
At one extreme, he says, are the nations of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf Coopera­tion Council ( a military and economic alliance in the region) who fully support the U.S. ac­tions. At the other extreme is a popular sentiment that "Saddam Hussein is speaking up for these deprived, dispos­sessed masses . . . of Arab vic­tims ... the great avenger, sticking it to the West." 
As for popular support for Saddam in his own Iraq, Gaffney is uncertain. He says that media and speech restric­tions in a police state like Iraq can create a deceiving impres­sion of a leader's popularity, as it did for the late Anwar Sadat. 
"It's hard to say in a case like Iraq, based on massive out­pourings of enthusiasm, that this is genuine, (as) if they had an alternative," he said. "It is clear there is opposition," Gaffney said in reference to Saddam's assassination of nu­merous rivals, "but is it popu­lar, I don't know." 
As to the role of the U.S. in future international disputes, Gaffney said "I don't think it should be our role (to police the world). The United Nations has instruments to deal with such disputes, he said. 
Gaffney feels that sanctions were not given enough time to work and that military action was taken prematurely. "They were never intended to work in five months," he said of the sanctions. 
"My suspicion is that there were competing views within the government" he said citing diplomatic, economic, and mili­tary efforts as working on dif­ferent timetables. "Sanctions were a ... strategy that got separated off and stuck in a lower priority."

OPERATION DESERT STORM
Wednesday, January 23, 1991 page 9 
Times have a-changed at Kent 
KENT. Ohio (AP) -An anti­war activist at Kent State Uni­versity telephoned the school newspaper last week, wonder­ing whether demonstrators would get in trouble if they took over the campus radio station. 
"I mean, shouldn't they just do it?" asked Jennifer Lyons, editorial page editor at the Daily Kent Stater. 
Times have changed since Kent becamfl a tragic symbol for the pe~lCfl movement during the Vietnam War. 
Those who protested the U.S. bombing of Cambodia in the spring of 1970 didn't ask any­one's permission. They rioted in downtown Kent. They chanted whiln watching the HOTC build­ing burn to the ground. They thrnw rocks at National Guard troops. 
On May 4, 1970, four Kent studnJlts were killed when troops opened fire at a demon­stration. Nine other people w11rn wounded. 
The shootings put this city, 40 milns southeast of Cleveland, on_ tlw map, and they gave the school a reputation that bears

little resemblance to sentiment at Kent today. 
"This is a very conservative campus," said Trish Hooper, editor of the school newspaper. "It became a symbol, real or imagined, because of what happened on one day." 
Letters to the editor are run­ning about three to one in favor of the U.S. action in the Persian Gulf, Ms. Lyons said. And the letters have come in droves, about 60 of them in the first two days after the American attack. 
On campus. the prevailing opinion is support for U.S. troops, even among those who disagreed with the decision to go to war. 
"Whether or not I agree with the war isn't really an issue," said Wendy Shirer, 20, of Wooster, a sophomore studying fashion merchandising. "I feel we should support the people who are over there. It seems a lot of the anti-war people are saying, 'We want peace.' Well, everybody wants peace. But you can't stand by and just let that

guy (Saddam Hussein) go in there." 
There is a small but vocal anti-war group at Kent, orga­nized during the five months since Iraq invaded Kuwait. About 100 students, faculty and others opposed to war paraded on campus the night the allied bombing began. A noon rally Thursday nearly became violent when pro-war students began shouting at anti-war demon­strators. 
Some brief pushing and shoving ended abruptly when word circulated that a U.S. plane had been downed. Both sides paused for a silent prayer, and the demonstration ended. 
"Overall. we're probably a minority, but I don't think we're that small of a minority," said Tom Albanese, 22, of Lisbon, a sociology student and a representative of Students United Against War. "Our dual message is that we support the troops but disagree with gov­ernment policy." 
He wants no repeat of the alienation felt by soldiers dur­ing the Vietnam-era protests. 

Lack of aid for civilians in Iraq 
BONN, Germany (AP)-U.S. bombing raids on Iraq have killed or wounded thousands of civilians and there are not enough doctors. electricity or running water to care for the injured, a European Parliament member said Tuesday. 
Dieter Schinzel, a specialist on the Middle East, said two Iraqis who fled to Jordan from Baghdad had telephoned him with details of the situation. He belongs to the opposition Social Democratic Party, which op­poses the war. 
Spokesmen for the German government and the Defense Ministry said they had no in­formation on Schinzel's claims. 
Neither the Iraqis nor the Americans have spoken of such high casualties. 
Schinzel accused both the United States and Iraq of play­ing a "computer game" by dis­cussing only the number of sor­ties and jets downed and not speaking'of human casualties. 
He said in a telephone inter­view that the United States' motive was to maintain support for the war, and Iraq's was to keep morale from plummeting. 
The two Iraqis called him be­cause relatives knew him from his many trips to Iraq, Schinzel said. They told him, he said, that the damage to downtown Baghdad was not great but outlying regions of the country had been devastated and "several thousand" civilians were dead or wounded. 
That was as specific as his informants could be about ca­sualties, he said. 
Later Tuesday, Schinzel nwt with the Iraqi ambassador to Bonn for an hour. lie said afterward he had no new in­formation on casualties and that there was no change in Iraq's position. 
Schinzel said the men who telephoned him lived in south­ern Iraq. but traveled to Bagh­dad on Sunday en route to Jor­dan. 
Pilots says Saddam may be holding back for big air strike 
IN CENTHAI. SAUDI AHABIA (AI'I -Amnrican pilots, who thought tlw war with Iraq would begin with a decisive hattl!~ for air supremacy, now say Saddam Hussein may be holding his fighters back for a hugt~ air strike. 
If so, they'll be ready, the pi­lots say, and they promise to rout the Iraqis. 
"We're prepared for that," said Lt. Col. Handall Bigum, who eommands a squadron of F-15Cs, the Air Force's premier air-to-air fighter. "We're not letting down our guard. We can't. The price is too high." 
"There is a lot of speculation going on right now in classified cireles about what his game plan might be, if he has one," said Bigum, of Springfield, Va. "Every one of those specula­tions includes a massive use of his air power that is remaining in support of some counterof­fensive." 
Bigum's P-15Cs fly round-the­clock air cover for some of the hundreds of allied planes that are raiding targets in Iraq and Kuwait. 
In the past two or three days, pilots have encountered only token Iraqi air resistance on raids into Kuwait, and on even deeper sorties into Iraq, said Lt. Col. Charles Plunkett, 43, of Hartsville, s-:c.. who leads a squadron of F-16A fighter­bombers.

"What really surprises me is, with the frequency of our at­tacks and as massive as they've been, and as destructive as they've been, especially in downtown Baghdad ... the deci­sion that Saddam Hussein is making (to hold back his air force) really defies logic," Plunkett said.

On Tuesday, he said, F-16As from his squadron encountered fire from only a single 57mm anti-aircraft gun on a raid into Kuwait. 
"If the weather had been good all along, I feel that we would have reached a turning point by now," he said. "As it is, maybe the turning point is another few days down the road. It's really hard to tell right now."

allied air plan. 
"We were supposed to con­front his air force head-on, early on," Bigum said. "He has chosen not to take that course." 
According to Bigum, the role of allied air-to-air fighters in the rest of the war will be de­termined to a large extent by Saddam's next move. 
"It's probably by design that he has refrained from flying his airplanes," he said. "I don't know of any engagement that has occurred in which the F­15Cs have not come out with kills on them.' So he has been unsuccessful any time he has chosen to engage the air-to-air F-15 community." Bigum esti­mated fewer than a dozen aerial engagements had taken place. 
"There's been a lot of initia­tions of intercepts, but they've immediately turned and run, well outside of missile employ­ment," he said. "And they run and land at their airfield, some­times not even the airfield they took off from." 
Plunkett said he believes the Iraqis are afraid to fight. 
"We had a case a couple of days ago where the Iraqis en­gaged a couple of the F-15s," he said. "They launched two radar missiles and before they even timed off (finished count­ing down). they turned ... and ran. 
"In that particular weapons system, if they don't keep the radar on the target, the missile goes stupid."

T 
he Gulf War is hitting 
close-to home for some 
students with friends and 
relatives stationed in or 
nfmr Saudi Arabia, raising eoncerns for safety and a quick end to thn eonllict. 
Nancy Wallace, a Notre Dame law studnnt, knows several persons close to lwr in the Gulf War. Both her brother and her sister's fiancee are currently serving in the Gulf. and Wallace is worried for both of them. 
Her brother left on January 11 after eoming hom11 to pay his respects after a d111tth in the family, she said. but her family hasn't heard from him since. "We don't know where he's stationed," Wallace said. 
"lie went to Pendleton Camp in California first," she said, "but after that we don't know where he is." 
''I'm glad I got to see him right before war started," she added. 
''I'm nervous and afraid. I'm worried of what ma.y happen but I'm proud of my brother." she said. 
Her sister's fiancee is on the front line, she said, and her family is concerned for him. too. AftPr the initial news of the attack on Baghdad, Wallace said she callnd her sister first to see if her sister had heard anything, but she hadn't at tlw time. 
'I think what we are doing is right. Something had to be done but you still worry about your family.' 
Wallace said that she wasn't terribly surprised by the announcement that war had begun. "It was what I expected of him [Bush!. but it was no real news. I 


 



NO students concerned about relatives in Persian Gulf 
remember getting chills-I was very 
frightened. I think it's better like this than 
to sit and wait, though." 
She said she supports the actions in the 
Gulf. "I think what ~e're doing is right. 
Something had to be done but you still 
worry about your family... I'm real 
anxious to find out how things will end. 
There's a lot of anxiety for it to be over, to 
know how everyone is." 
A few other things concern Wallace, one 
being the differences in the cultures of the 
Western world and the Arab nations. 
"There's a parallel to Vietnam in that their 
world perception is so different from ours. 
We don't understand completely how they 
think or how they might react, so that 
worries me." 
The second thing is that Wallace thinks 
in the armed services small things some­
times get lost or are ignored. She related 
how her brother wore glasses. but that the 
issued gas masks didn't allow for glasses 
to be worn, so the soldiers had to wear 
contacts. The catch is, she said, that there 
is little if any saline solution for contacts. 
"Whatever else happens, I hope it's over 
quickly," she said. 
Senior Bernard Nunies has three close 
relatives in the Gulf, two uncles and an 
aunt, all called in from the reserves. 
His first uncle and his aunt have been in the Gulf for some time, he said. Their two children, ages one and two, are staying with his aunt's parents and sister. Nunies said that his uncle sent his grandmother a Christmas card, and his aunt calls as often as possible, perhaps every day, to check on their children. His uncle serves in transportation, while his aunt serves as a 
cook. 
His other uncle was just called to the 
Gulf this past Wednesday, the first night of 
tbe war, Nunies said, and is serving in a 
combat position. 
"We're all worried what will happen," he said. "And we hope and pray that they come home safely."

PAIGE SMORON Assistant Accent Editor 
In honor of the Day of Women on Saturday, January 26th, the Snite will be offering a visual cross-section of the various roles of women in the pa~t. 
The museum will be conduct­ing tours from 3 to 4 p.m. that highlight images of women. The object of the tours is to present the role of women in different civilizations by interpreting the art that was created in these civilizations. 
The pieces shown are all permanent objects of the mu­seum collection and vary from the 1Oth to the 20th century. The tour has been divided into five parts that focus on a dif­ferent area of the world. There will be five speakers that will each address one of these sec­tions. 
"The tours are a way to un­derstand how women were thought of at different times in different cultures," said Diana Matthias, Curriculum Struc­tured Tour Coordinator. "Some depictions put women down, some put women on a pedestal." 
The first culture covered will be the Medieval period. The works are mainly Italian, and there will be a portrait of the Virgin Mary, a 16th century portrait of a woman, and a 17th century portrayal of an Old Testament woman. 
There will also be selections viewed in the African section, as well as a look at the role of women in I'ndia. In particular, a 
1Oth century sculpture of th~ 

A DAY OF 
WOMEN 
Saturday,jan.26, 1991 
Indian goddess Kali will be fea­tured. 
Another section will focus on 18th century paintings of gods and goddesses, especially Persephone, and Ceres. The last portion of the tour will concentrate on two portraits of women from the 18th and 19th century, and there will be a quick look at two 20th century paintings that were done by women. 
Interestingly, most of the artists featured were male, and subsequently present the male point of view. One of the few pieces created by a female artist is an African headdress, crafted by a mother for her daughter to wear on her wed­ding day. 
Those interested in these Snite tours should meet in the Atrium of the museum at 3 
p.m. this Saturday.

NL on expansion: no compromises 
NEW YORK (AP) Philadelphia Phillies president Bill Giles, appointed to replace Houston owner John McMullen on the National League's ex­pansion committee, says shar­ing the money with the American League is non-nego­tiable as far as he's co,.pcerned. 
The AL wants the NL to split part of the $190 million it will receive from the two new fran­chises, which will begin play in 1993. Giles has been among the more outspoken NL owners who oppose any sharing. 
"As far as I'm concerned it isn't (negotiable)," he said. "But certainly the American League has the right to speak their peace.... 
"I just feel that there's no 

precedent or logic for it," Giles ' the other member. 
said. "It's always been kept within the leagues. The league in which you expand is always going to be hurt intitially be­cause attendance will suffer some because the expansion ci­ties will not draw well." 
A majority of the AL clubs must approve the two NL ex­pansion cities, so the AL could block expansion by the NL if it wants to. Three-quarters of the NL owners must approve the expansion cities. 
McMullen left the expansion committee because he is at­tempting to sell the Astros. The committee is headed by Pittsburgh Pirates chairman Douglas Danforth. New York Mets president Fred Wilpon is 
Buffalo, N.Y.; Denver; Miami; Orlando, Fla.; St. Petersburg, Fla., and Washington are the six finalists for the two new franchises. The expansion committee is to spend two days in each of the six cities next month. 
The committee tentatively is scheduled to report to the league's other owners by June. The league has said it hopes to pick the two cities by September. 
"I've gone through the ex­pansion thing from both sides," said Giles, who was public re­lations director and traveling secretary of the Houston Colt .45s in 1962, the team's first year. 
Lemieux still not ready 
PITTSBURGH (AP) -Mario Lemieux, sidelined all season by back pain, is still struggling with his endurance and isn't ready to return to the Pittsburgh Penguins' lineup, coach Bob Johnson said. 
Team doctors hoped Lemieux might return for Tuesday night's game against New Jersey, but he probably won't play until next week at the earliest. 
Lemieux is painfree, but will not resume playing until "he's ready to play hockey," Johnson said. 
"It might be Saturday, it might be a week from Saturday," Johnson said. "He'll know when he can play and I'll know when he can play, just by his performance on ice in practice." 
Lemieux hasn't played since March 31-he only game he played in the Penguins' final 23 last season-and hasn't played at all this season. 
"He's not in game shape," Johnson said. "He's played one game in a year and has to be able to go out there and really push off, accelerate, get loose pucks, make plays." 
The two-time NHL scoring champion was bed-ridden for several-weeks with a back in­fection that developed following surgery July 11 to remove partly a hernjated disk. He resumed practicing in late December.

New York-Buffalo­they meet again... 
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -Super Bowl history suggests that fa­miliarity breeds an edge, that playing a team for the second time in a season can be benefi­cial, especially with a champi­onship at stake. 
Six times in the past, Super Bowls have been rematches, and in four of those games, the team that won the first match won the second. The last time was 1986, when the New York Giants beat Denver 19-16 dur­ing the season and 39-20 in the Super Bowl. 
Running back Ottis Anderson remembers the sequence and how coach Bill Parcells handled it. 
"Bill said, 'Be careful what you say. Enjoy the win but keep it in perspective. You might see them again.' 
"That was unbelievable. We got to the Super Bowl and there they were." 
That taught Anderson a les­son. Five weeks ago, Buffalo beat the Giants 17-13, and as the game neared its end, Bills safety Leonard Smith, Anderson's former teammate with the Cardinals, went into a victory dance. 
"He was shaking his finger in the camera saying, 'We got those guys!' " Anderson said. "I thought of '86 and Denver and said to myself, 'You know, we might see each other again.' 
"Here we are." 
The first game was memo­rable because both teams lost their starting quarterbacks. Buffalo's Jim Kelly went out with a sprained left knee, re­turning for the playoffs. New York's Phil Simms is still on crutches with a sprained right arch, replaced by Jeff Hostetler. 
Kelly hurt his knee when Bills tackle Will Wolford fell into him. At the time, however, Wolford was more concerned with his own right knee, sprained on the same play. Center Kent Hull remembers the scene. 
"I turned around and saw our starting tackle and our quarterback both on the ground, both holding their knees," he said. "I thought, 'Oh, great!' 
"When Kelly went off, he said, 'I'll be back.' He didn't say it would be three weeks later." 
Wolford was blocking Leonard Marshall on the play. Jim Ritcher knocked Carl Banks off his feet and into Wolford's right knee. Wolford rolled into Kelly. 
"I never knew I hit him," Wolford said. "I couldn't feel the bottom of my leg. I thought I had torn a ligament. I thought I was gone." 
When he got to the dressing room, Wolford found Kelly there. "I said, 'What happened to you?' and he told me I fell on his knee." 
The episode deprived the Bills of two Pro Bowl players and occurred after Kelly had driven the Bills to touchdowns on their first two possessions. 
The Giants had scored first on a 1-yard run by Anderson, a TD set up by rookie Rodney Hampton's 41-yard run. Hampton suffered a broken leg in the opening playoff game and, like Simms, will miss the Super Bowl. 
Kelly brought the Bills right back, throwing 48 yards to Thurman Thomas, setting up a 6-yard TD pitch to Andre Reed. Then Thomas scored on a 2­yard run after Kelly passed to Reed for 36 yards. 
Matt Bahr's 23-yard field goal made it 14-10 at halftime. Bahr narrowed it to 14-13 with a 22­yard field goal in the third quarter. But the Giants didn't score again. 
Hostetler got New York in scoring position four times, but the drives produced only Bahr's second field goal. Blunders -a holding penalty, a botched snap on shd'tgun formation and of­fensive pass interference ­stalled the Giants.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -Herman Moore, Virginia's All-America wide receiver, will give up his final year of eligibil­ity to enter the NFL draft, he said Tuesday. 
"It's taken me some time to make this decision," Moore said at a news conference. "And it's my decision. Neither my family nor anyone else could decide for me. I had to." 
The 6-foot-5, 200-pound Moore expects to graduate this spring. 
Moore, who teamed with quarterback Shawn Moore to lead the Cavaliers to an 8-4 record and a trip to the Sugar Bowl, set two NCAA records in his career. During the 1990 season he became the first player to catch a touchdown pass in nine consecutive games, and he averaged 22.0 yards per reception for his career. 

Moore also set an Atlantic Coast Conference record this season with 1,190 receiving yards. He holds school records for catches in a season (54), touchdowns in a seeason (13), yards in a career (2,504) and touchdowns in a career (27). 
Moore said Virginia's coach­ing staff told him some profes­sional scouts thought he would be among the top 10 chosen in the April 21 draft. 
Moore said he was not going into the draft with the attitude that he had to be a first-round choice. "I don't want to be in a position where I'll be real dis­appointed if I don't go in the first round," he said. 
Money was not the important factor in his decision to turn pro, Moore said. 
"I tried not to think about money," he said. "I wanted to do something that pleased me. The most important thing was the challenge of succeeding at a higher level of football. 
"I didn't feel there was any more I could accomplish at the collegiate level. I don't think I could have a better year than this year."

A team that scores just 52 points is not going to win many games, and the Irish know that. Rutgers started out in a man­to-man, and Notre Dame guard Tim Singleton had some suc­cess penetrating that defense to score himself and dish the ball off to his teammates, but when the Scarlet Knights switched to a man-to-man, the Irish just couldn't attack. 
"They did a good job of play­ing back in the zone and forc­ing the outside shot," Singleton said, "and we weren't able to get our running game going. In order to run, we have got to rebound, and when they are scoring on those second shot attempts, we can't get it going."

maybe we can't make it to the NCAA's this year, but my goal is to get the the NCAA tournament in 1992 and qualify every year after that." 
This does seem quite plausi­ble, since the volleyball team is blessed by full administrative and financial support. Not only is it fully scholarshipped, but its budget is well endowed. 
"The financial support here versus Arizona State-it's a much larger budget than I had there," said Brown, who with that smaller budget finished with a 117-83 record with the Sun Devils, including being problem for Notre Dame, espe­cially in the second half. The Irish led 18-15 in rebounds at halftime, but Rutgers controlled the boards in the second stanza and finished with a 38-35 advantage off the glass. 

Irish center Keith Tower fre­quently appeared winded in the second half, and it showed in his statistics. He had seven re­bounds at halftime, but finished with only nine for the game. 
"That's something we've got to look at," Phelps said. "He played 38 minutes and he's not used to doing that. You'd like to play him for 28, but you're playing to win, and when you've got the lead you don't want to take him out." 
With little help for Tower in­side, it is unlikely that the sit­uation will improve soon. Without Ellis, the inside game has taken a turn for the worse, and with opponents now con­centrating on outside gunners Sweet, Bennett and Ellery, the second half of the season could

fully it will translate into their being smart volleyball players. 
"Your time in college should be a really fun -time in life," she said. "Sure, we need discipine, hard work and the will to win, but we're going to work hard and have fun, too. The women on the team should be having a great time. I can't wait to get in the gym with them and start working."

for the Irish, however, was their inability to hit from the field. Notre Dame connected on only 20-of-54 shots in the game (37 percent) as Sweet (6 of 14), Bennett (2 of 8) and Ellery ( 4 of 
11) turned in strangely unchar­acteristic performances. 
The shooting slump may be tied to the long layoff between last Thursday's win over Marquette and Tuesday night's game. 
"I thought we were in a real good groove," Phelps said. "We took Friday off, went light Saturday and Sunday and pretty hard yesterday, but it's pretty unusual for three guys like that not to shoot it well." 
Neither team shot very well in the first half, with Rutgers connecting on just 34.8 percent of its shots and Notre Dame hitting 42.3 percent from the field. After falling behind 5-1 in the first two minutes, the Irish fought back to tie the game at 7-7 on Ellery's hanging jumper from the right baseline. 
Seven lead changes and four ties followed before Ellery sank a three-point shot from the left wing with six seconds remain­ing in the half to give the Irish a four-point halftime advantage at 24-20. 
Rutgers center Keith Hughes, who contributed a quiet eight points in the first half, exploded for 17 second-half points and his fadeaway jumper at the 
18:01 mark gave the Scarlet Knights a 25-24 lead early in the second half. 
"I think Hughes is one of those NBA three-spot players," Phelps said. "He rebounds well, he shoots well, he puts it on the floor and he's not afraid to post up. I knew him in high school when we recruited him, and he went to Syracuse before he transferred back to Rutgers." 
Forward Jon Ross gave Notre Dame its biggest lead of the game, five points, when he completed a three-point play with 7:57 remaining. Rutgers struck right back, however, outscoring the Irish 13-1 over the next five minutes to take a 49-42 advantage. 
Notre Dame pulled as close as five points at 55-50 when Tower tipped in a Sweet miss with 55 seconds remaining, but the Scarlet Knights hit their free throws down the stretch to pull away for a 10-point victory. 
"The 10 points certainly is not indicative of the closeness of the game," said Rutgers head coach Bob Wenzel. "This is like a three-or four-point game."

Marinovich may be eligible for felony 
NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -A decision on whether charges will be filed against Southern Cal quarterback Todd Marinovich will be made within the next couple of days, Orange County deputy district attorney Mike Koski said Tuesday. 
Marinovich was arrested Sunday for investigation of possession of cocaine, police said. 
"I have the case, I have the reports," Koski said. "We want to have the substance weighed and analyzed." 
Carl Ambrust, another Orange County deputy district attorney, said Marinovich will be treated like anybody else. 
"If he had more than a gram of cocaine, he'll be charged with a felony," Ambrust said. "If it was less, he'll be charged with a misdemeanor. If it's right at a gram, we'll have to decide. 
"If he's charged with a felony, he could go to prison, but he probably wouldn't. He's eligible to apply for a diversion program." 
A police spokesman had said Monday that tests proved that the white substance allegedly found on Marinovich was cocaine. 
"What we originally thought was cocaine was in fact co­caine," Sgt. Andy Gonis of the Newport Beach Police said. 
Gonis also said that an envelope containing four­tenths of a gram of marijuana allegedly was found on Marinovich, who recently was suspended from the Southern Cal team for missing a mandatory team meeting and not registering for spring clases. 
Marinovich, 21, was arrested at 4:15 a.m. Sunday morning after he and three other men were cavorting down a street in this coastal city 40 miles southeast of Los Angeles, police said. The four were stopped by officers concerned about possible disturbances to neighbors. 
All four men were searched, and police said they found a "bindle" in Marinovich's waistband that contained about one gram of white powder believed to be cocaine, police said. 
None of the other three men were arrested, but Southern Cal sports information director Tim Tessalone said Tuesday that one of the three-defensive tackle Adam Swaney-was suspended indefinitely from the football 


Montana: operation puts two screws in right hand 
REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -Quarterback Joe Montana underwent surgery on Tuesday to repair a bone in his right hand, broken during the San Francisco 49ers' loss to the New York Giants in Sunday's NFC championship game. 
1\vo screws were inserted in Montana's hand during the surgery, performed at Sequoia Hospital by team physician Dr. Michael Dillingham. The proce­
dure was pronounced a suc­cess. 
Dillingham said Montana's hand will be in a cast for about four weeks. The screws will be removed in about two months and Montana will be able to be­gin throwing about a month after that. 
Montana was sacked from behind by Leonard Marshall with about 10 minutes left in Sunday's 15-13 loss.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP)-If Chuck Webb is to fulfill the promise he showed in one sea­son at Tennessee, he will do so in an NFL jersey. 
Tennessee coaches confirmed Tuesday that Webb, who as a redshirt freshman had one of the best rushing seasons in Volunteer history, will make himself available in the NFL draft. 
Webb has two seasons of eli­gibility left at Tennessee. He missed all but one game last season after tearing a ligament in his right knee. 
Rather than risk another col­lege season in an effort to im­prove his stock in the pro draft, Webb decided to turn pro im­mediately. 
"I received a letter from Chuck Webb today informing me that he will make himself available for the NFL draft," Tennessee coach Johnny Majors said Tuesday in a statement. "Chuck is an excellent player. I wish him success in professional football. "The deadline to file for the draft is Feb. 1. 
"I've had people in the league tell me that if he had played all last year and gained something like 1,600 yards, he would've been the first choice," said Jimmy Sexton, an agent who represents several former Tennessee players, including Reggie White of the Philadelphia Eagles. 
Webb, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, reportedly returned to his home in Toledo, Ohio. 
There was some speculation that Webb's decision was moti­vated by continuing academic problems. Academically, Webb is a junior majoring in psychol­ogy. 
But Haywood Harris, associ­ate athletic director for media relations, said Webb was con­sidered "a full-time student in good standing academically with the university." 
Webb tore the anterior crud­ate ligament in his right knee on his third carry against Pacific on Sept. 1, the Vols' second game of the year. He had gained 156 yards on 30 carries for the season. 
He underwent surgery, and Dr. William Youmans said no other damage was found. 
But the doctor said Webb can't "expect a 100 percent re­turn to the way Chuck was. I do not think that is a realistic ex­pectation." 
Webb gained 1,236 yards in 1989 despite starting only half the season and missing the sea­son finale against Vanderbilt with an ankle injury. It was at the time the second highest sin­gle-season rushing total in school history. 
Cunningham, Shell receive honors 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) Philadelphia Eagles quarter­back Randall Cunningham won the Maxwell Club's NFL player of the year award Tuesday for the second time -and this time he was ready to acknowledge the honor. 
The Maxwell group selected Cunningham for the award after the 1988 season, but Cunningham didn't show up for a news conference and had to be contacted by phone at his suburban home while he met with an agent about real estate. 
Cunningham referred to that incident during Tuesday's in­terview, also conducted by phone because he was out of town on vacation. 
"The first time I didn't un­
derstand how prestigious this was. It's a very respected award and any player would be proud to accept," Cunningham said. 
Cunningham, who passed for 3,466 yards and 30 touchdowns with 13 interceptions and ran for 942 this season, won the club's Bert Bell Award over San Francisco's Joe Montana, Houston's Warren Moon, Buffalo's Bruce Smith and San Francisco's Jerry Rice. 
Cunningham received 197 first-place votes and 819 points to 110 votes and 567 points for Montana, who won last year's award and didn't appear for the awards banquet. Moon had 84 votes and 481 points, Smith 52 and 434 and Rice 37 and 237. 
Cunningham is the first player to win the award more than once since Baltimore's John Unitas won it in 1959, 1964 and 196 7. 
Art Shell of the Los Angeles Raiders won the club's Earle "Greasy" Neale Award as NFL coach of the year over Buffalo's Marv Levy, Kansas City's Marty Schottenheimer, San Francisco's George Seifert and Dallas's Jimmy Johnson. Shell received 133 votes to 7 2 for Levy and 68 for Schottenheimer. 
"After the Sunday we had, this is great," said Shell, who Raiders were beaten 51-3 by Buffalo in the AFC champi­onship game. ''I'm excited."

Rutgers snaps modest Irish win streak, 62-52 
By FRANK PASTOR 
Associate Sports Editor 
At Monday afternoon's press conference, Notre Dame head coach Digger .Phelps outlined three objectives his basketball team needed to meet to ·have any chance of playing in a post­season tournament two months from now. 
Forward Daimon Sweet, the team's leading scorer, had to become more of a rebounder. Center Keith Tower, the team's leading rebounder, needed to become more of a scoring threat. And Point guard Tim Singleton, the team's assist leader, had to penetrate more often. 
None of th~t happened Tuesday night at the Joyce ACC as the Irish fell to Rutgers, 62­52, halting their season-high win streak at three games. 
Sweet led Notre Dame with 14 points on 6-of-14 shooting from the field but pulled down only three rebounds, all defen­sive, in 36 minutes of play. 
"Sweet's stats are mislead­ing," Phelps said, "because he's got to be more active on the of­fensive boards, which is some­thing we've talked about with Ellis gone. He's got to take up more of that slack and become more of an offensive re­bounder." 
Tower picked up some of the slack with a team-high nine re­bounds, including five offensive boards. He also scored eight points in the game but was in­volved in two crucial plays that proved the difference for the Irish. 
With 6: 19 remaining in the second half, Tower missed con­secutive free throws in the mid­dle of a 13-1 run for the Scarlet Knights. Rutgers center Brent Dabbs punctuated the run with two free throws at the 3:11 mark which came after Tower was called for an intentional foul for throwing an elbow. 
"I didn't see the intentional foul," Phelps said. "I thought those were two key situations that kind of put the game out of reach for us." 
"I didn't think it was retalia­tion," Tower said. "I don't know what it looked like. I'll have to see the tape." 
Singleton dished out nine as­sists but shot only four times in the game, connecting on three for a total of six points. The need for Singleton to pick up some of the scoring slack be­came apparent down the stretch when two of Notre Dame's most dangerous shoot­ers, guard Elmer Bennett and guard-forward Kevin Ellery, fouled out, allowing Rutgers to key on Sweet. 
Perhaps the biggest problem

The Observer I Marguerite Schropp Keith Tower, flanked by Brent Dabbs (54) and Donnell Lumpkin (44) of Rutgers, scored 8 points and pulled down 9 rebounds in Notre Dame's 62-52 loss Tuesday night. Tower fouled out with nine seconds left. 

Poor shooting dooms Notre Dame 
They were riding a three-game winning streak and had posted five victories in their past seven games. The Notre Dame men's basketball team was finally making a 

move toward a . . respectable record with Ken ~YSI8C Rutgers rolling into town. Associate Sports 
Editor 
The Irish face a--------.a.. schedule so brutal that it is ranked third most difficult in the nation by USA Today. With such a schedule, the Scarlet Knights were the type of marginal team Notre Dame desperately needed to beat. 
But poor shooting doomed the Irish, who skidded to 7-10 on the season after a 62-52 loss, while Rutgers improved to 10-7. Notre Dame shot just 32.1 percent in the second half and 37.0 percent for the game in its first loss since junior forward LaPhonso Ellis was declared academically ineligible. 
The shooting was poor right across the board. Daimon Sweet, shooting 58.3 percent for the season, was just 6 for 14 from the field. Elmer Bennett, who was in foul trouble throughout the game, was 2 for 8, and Kevin Ellery went 0 for 4 in the second half to finish 4 for 11 for the game. 
Was it the Rutgers zone defense that doomed the shooting of a Notre Dame team, a squad which had shot better than 50 percent in eight o its last 10 games? 
"That's very unusual for those three guys to shoot that poorly, especially because we faced zones against both West Virginia and Marquette, so it wasn't like we hadn't seen a zone before," Irish coach Digger Phelps lamented. 
"I think you're going to have games like this," Sweet said. "The shots just didn't fall for us, and things didn't go our way. It's difficult for us be­cause with LaPhonso gone we have to attack defenses from the outside first rather than from the inside. I mean, Keith Tower and the Ross

New vollevball coach brings fresh start to program 
Walk into the volleyball office in the Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center and you'll see new items: a new desk, new chairs, new carpet, a new bookcase ... and a new coach. 
Everything's new. You can still smell the carpet glue. As of Monday, the keys to the desk Scott Brutocao lock were still sealed in a plas­tic bag. Since the room had Irish Items been empty, the only items 


moved into the room were a desk, a boo.kcase, a phone, a coffee table/desk, two padded chairs, a new rug and a volleyball coach named Debra Brown. 
This setting of lacquered desks, upholstered chairs and fitted rugs is an appropriate backdrop to introduce Brown, a former assistant coach for the U.S. national volleyball team and prior head coach of Arizona State women's volleyball. 
"All I've got to do is get a little baseboard around this room, put a few pictures up and move my stuff in and it might look like somebody's worked here," said Brown, sitting behind a desk whose top was speckled with packages, memos and congratulatory letters. 
Brown, who was named Head Coach of the women's volleyball team Dec. 14, is still getting her bearings.at Notre Dame, but she has had time to share a few thoughts about her upcoming challenge as the chief of the volleyball program. 
"This job is one of a few at the very top of coach­ing," said Brown, who has had plenty of experience in Division I coaching, leading the ASU Sun Devils to five NCAA tournament appearances in six years as head coach. "Others are Stanford, UCLA, Texas and Illinois, and that's probably it. I think Notre Dame is ahead of all of them. We may not have had the traditional volleyball success, but I think the potential is definitely there." 
The Notre Dame coaching position came to Brown at an opportune time for both her and the program, as Brown recently had resigned as the U.S. national assistant, and Notre Dame had had its own head 
·coach resign in October. 
Brown's reason for resigning as assistant coach of the U.S. team was that her "training philosophy was a little different than the head coach's," while former Notre Dame head coach Art Lambert's excuse for his exodus was the simple "philosophical differences" with the administration. 
Making a break from all these philosophical issues, 
Brown is not going to delve into the prior Notre Dame volleyball situation, unless it is vital to her responsibility of effectively guiding her players. 
"I don't know about a lot of what's happened in the past, but that's not important for me to know," said Brown. "What is important is my providing a fresh start for the players, and a positive atmosphere in which to play. I'll work them hard, help them achieve their athletic goals. I'm not going to look back unless I have to for solving a problem." 
This is not to say that the program's past success and failure is not important to her. Rather, she is enthusiastic about the recent success the team has had, despite the pitfall during the last two seasons. In 1990, the team suffered through a disastrous 9-27 season, yet just two years before the team finished 19­12 and made its first appearance at the NCAA tournament. 
"Art (Lambert) did a great job building this pro­gram," said Brown. "He established that Notre Dame can compete at this (national) level, and now it's just a matter of making that a year-in and year-out performance. 
"I think it's a realistic and reachable goal to get to the NCAA tournament every year. I'm not sure, but
