Panel discusses popular history 
History Dept. Chair Thomas Noble says academic history is different 
By CATHERINE MILLER 
NewsWrirer 
There's popular history, and then there's unpopular histo­ry, said Thomas Noble, Chair of the Department of History and the first of three panel 
members  to  speak  at  
Tuesday's  discussion  
"Academic  vs.  Popular  

History," which aimed to dif­ferentiate between the two genres of history in today's society. 
"One of the obvious differ­ences between popular and academic history is that popu­lar history makes an enor­mous amount of money," Noble said, as he began the event sponsored by the Department of History and Exploring History Beyond the Classroom, a one credit class designed to encourage intel­lectual discussion among his­tory scholars. 
Enhanced with colorful images and visuals, prominent publishers issue popular his­toric books, while academic books tend to lack visuals and are usually published by a university, Noble said. 
"There is a difference in how the books are prepared," he said. 
Once written, an academic book is reviewed by an author's colleagues. For a 
popular book, no review process is necessary, and edi­tors work more closely with authors. Also, success of a popular historical book is measured by the number of copies sold, instead of the quality of the review neces­sary for success of an academ­ic book. 
"There is one piece of bad news and two pieces of good news [about this fact]," John McGreevy, O'Shaughnessy Dean of Arts and Letters, said. There is an enormous amount of bad popular history, he said.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Kirk clarifies role of Office of Residence Life 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 

The Office of Residence Life (ORL) is charged with educating students, not with punishing them, according to associate vice president of Residence Life Bill Kirk, a 1984 graduate of Notre Dame who spoke at Tuesday's Council of Representatives (COR) meeting at the request of Student Body President Bob Reish. 
"[ORL] is not about the mini­mal expectations of society, it's not about treating everyone the same," Kirk said. "It is much more about an attempt by the University to try to help in the formation of the students in their education. Our primary role is education." 
Much of ORL's role in the edu­cational process is overshad­owed by the perception that the office is only focused on disci­pline, but Kirk said that the office's disciplinary measures serve a greater purpose. 
"Quite obviously, they deal with discipline, but it's about educa­tion, it's about formation, it's about trying to assist students in

Decline a bovvl gatne 
It snmns to bn of/ieial. ESPN, WNDU, 
lrisheyns.eom and, according to today's 
sports snetion of The Observer, a source 
dosn to tho administration have confirmed 
that Charlie Weis will remain as the head 
football coach at our fair University. 
I won't lie and say I'm not entirely sad 
that I'll bn graduat­
ing at the end of the

er dismal season in 

Saint Mary's
the student seetion. 

Editor
Instead, I'll most 
likely bn sitting else­

where in the stadium watehing a dismal 
season-let's faee it, I'll be an Irish fan 
for life. 

That bning said, I, like many fans, was 
disappointed in the Irish's showing against 
USC. Obviously, I don't like that we lost or 
the fact that it took us almost 45 minutes 
to get a first down. But what I'm most dis­
appointed in is the laek of passion I saw 
from our team. 

Now. I've never written a sports artielc, nor do I daim to have an extensive knowl­edge of the sport of football, but I was at USC. I don't know how much they showed on TV hut before the game the players of both teams got into a light. Th1m, two play­ers, one from each team, were ejected from tho game because or lighting. 
After the game, Charlie Weis said that he nxpeets the team to be going somewhere wlwn bowl stdnction day rolls around. 
I want to ask why'? Why should we go to a bowl game'? 
We barely beat Navy. We lost to a tPam that was 2-H. What have we donn that shows that we d1~servo to go to a bowl'? 
Sure, we lost to USC. but let's bP honest, who didn't sen that onP coming'? I'm not saying that we don't deserve to go to the Sun Bowl or tlw PoinsPttia Bowl just because wn lost to a team that we knew was going to bP able to beat us into the ground. 
I'm saying we don't desnrve to go to a bowl game because the only time I saw our players get lirnd up on Saturday was when they wern lighting USC players. Why not put the passion you showed us yelling and pushing the Trojans into the tackles you tried to makn that night? 
I'm saying we don't deserve to go to a bowl game because the only excitement I saw on the field during the Syracuse game was when Pat Kuntz got mad because he got hit with a snowball. 
Don't get me wrong, I commend our players for being students and athletes, but really. at the past two games they looked tired. They didn't show me any­thing that made me want to see them play again this season. It's getting to be cruel and unusual punishment watching Notre Dame football games. Why do I want to watch any more'? 
I'm sorry that if Notre Dame doesn't go to a bowl game the senior football players won't play for the Irish again, but maybe it's best to just go quietly. Congratulations on four years, but please don't subjeet me to anymore. 
I understand that money changes hands when teams are invited to bowl games, and therefore ND will obviously go wher­ever they arc invited. But seriously, think about sparing us the pain and respectfully decline. 
Personally, I know I would thank you for doing so.

Man accused of throwing Christmas tree at dad 
PARRISH, Fla. Authorities say a west Florida man who lives with his parents has been arrested on a felony assault charge after he used a Christmas tree as a weapon to attack his father. 
According to the Manatee County sher­iff's report a 37-year­old man was arrested last week after he threw a 3-foot Christmas tree at his father. The tree missed, but the man 
then tried to use the steel base from the tree to strike his father. 
The man was charged with felony assault. He denied trying to strike his father. 
Woman accused of stealing decorations 
MANCHESTER, Md. -A woman was facing misdemeanor theft charges for allegedly swiping Christmas dec­orations from her neighbor's lawns. The county sheriff's office 
said  a  51-year-old  
woman  was  found  
Monday  in  her  


Manchester home with 
decorations from at 
least three area homes. 
Authorities said the investigation began about 4:30a.m., after a woman reported a loud noise and discovered her 4-foot-tall Santa and snowman had been taken from her yard. 
After deputies went to her home, another neighbor who was walking her dog reported that she, too, had been targeted.

coming to understand that their actions have consequences," he said. 
Kirk is not personally involved in disciplinary hearings, contrary to popular perception, as he is not involved in the day-to-day procedures of the ORL, he said. 
"I supervise the administration of that office." 
ORL is directly supervised by Jeff Shoup, the Director of the Office of Residence Life and Housing. It is Shoup who runs disciplinary hearings, Kirk said. 
Kirk said he understands that he and the ORL are not well liked by students, but he said that he hopes that his appear­ance at the COR meeting will help to clear up some of the mis­understandings about his role at Notre Dame. 
Despite his assumed unpopu­larity among many students, Kirk said it is an "absolute delight to teach and be around" students. 
He received a favorable reac­tion from most COR members, especially after he was given a chance to articulate his view of the mission of Residence Life. 
"It's very clear that you have the best interests of the students and the community at heart," sophomore class president Cynthia Weber said. 
Kirk said that one of the key roles in Residence Life's educa­tional mission is instilling a sense that actions have consequences in students. Actions "really do have an impact on the rest of the community," Kirk said. 
Understanding this reality is important for the idea of living in a community that the University embraces, according to Kirk. 
"The sense of community is very important" at Notre Dame, he said. 
One important disciplinary role filled by ORL that is often over­looked is in regards to cases of sexual assault. 
Weber said many members of the sophomore class were most interested in the University's policies in regards to sexual assault, especially in light of the University's ban on premarital sexual intercourse. 
Kirk said that the University has two unrelated rules. 
"One deals with sexual mis­conduct and the ways that you can be charged with sexual assault," while the other is con­cerned with premarital inter­course, he said. 
"When an allegation of sexual assault is raised, the University says we're going to deal with that really important allegation," Kirk said. 
The University will not punish either party for premarital inter­course if an allegation of assault is raised, even if the individuals engaged in consensual inter­course prior to the alleged inci­dent of assault, he said. 
Cases of sexual assault are incidents in which the University often believes that further edu­cation of the perpetrator is impossible. 
"If someone sexually assaults someone, that's not a person we believe we can educate any more," he said. 
He said it is often difficult to establish the truth in an alleged sexual assault incident, unlike in most cases that Residence Life hears, which often regard alco­hol-related offenses. 
"Getting to what happened [in cases of sexual assault] is going to be very difficult," Kirk said. "It's not a situation where any­one is ever going to be happy." 
In cases that are not related to sexual assault, the facts of the case are generally clear-cut, he said. "There are very few cir­cumstances where there's ever a question of what actually hap­pened," he said. "Virtually always, there's a recognition among the students in the room that they engaged in this behav­ior, but there's almost always disagreement as to what the appropriate response is." 

"I think that reasonable people can disagree whether [Residence Life's sanctions] are effective, whether they do what we want them to do," Kirk said. 
Off-campus safety was an important topic in COR's discus­sion with Kirk. Kirk said off­campus security is the responsi­bility of South Bend Police, not of the University. 
Notre Dame Security Police's jurisdiction only extends on cam­pus and "on roads that run through and around campus," Kirk said. Therefore, NDSP is unable to "go and do police and law enforcement things else­where in the county," he said. This jurisdiction is set by Indiana state law. 
Kirk said that contrary to per­ception, South Bend police "are remarkably student-friendly." 
"They treat students with great respect and restraint, especially when the students they're dealing with generally have some level of intoxication," Kirk said. 
Also, contrary to popular belief, South Bend Police were not responsible for the Colfax Street raid on Sept. 21, accord­ing to Kirk, where 37 people were arrested. The Indiana State Excise Police and the St. Joseph County Police conducted the raid. 
"South Bend almost never brings anything to the University's attention, makes arrests or issue citations [for alcohol]," Kirk said. "I can't remember the last time I learned of an underage drinking arrest or a violation of a noisy house ordinance that came from the South Bend police." 
Kirk said that the primary role of the South Bend Police Department is not to prevent underage drinking. However, that is an important role of the excise police, which is charged to "enforce laws regarding the use

and abuse of alcohol," according to Kirk. 
"I've seen the excise police deal with students very respect­fully," Kirk said. "The excise police are doing what their mis­sion is calling them to do." 
While Kirk described the Colfax Street raid as "unfortu­nate," he said that he under­stands the actions of the police forces. "I don't like it when stu­dents have to go to jail," he said. "But I understand our local police departments' hesitation about releasing 30-some odd intoxicated people out into the night." 
Kirk said that Notre Dame expects a higher standard from its students that merely obedi­ence to the law. Therefore, the University is able to discipline students for their actions off­campus, even when they are also punished by civil authorities. 
"You've chosen to be part of a pretty special group of people ­Notre Dame students," Kirk said. "We have a higher standard that, generally speaking, virtually all of our students are in favor of." 
"When the University finds out [about an off-campus offense,] the University has an interest in you as a person," he said. "If you're routinely becoming drunk, that's a problem -it's immoral, unethical, and wrong." 
The actions of law enforce­ment will not help the student change his or her behavior, according to Kirk. 
"A public citation isn't going to call you to examine the role of alcohol in your life," he said. But he hopes that a disciplinary hearing will have that effect. 
''I'm not going to sit here and tell you that every student comes away saying 'I'm going to reflect on my drinking,"' Kirk said. "But I can tell you that there have been dozens of occasions in the past couple years where stu­dents tell me that it has."

Mooney is also working on a communication to the par­ents of current students, which should circulate soon. 
"[Mooney] will thank them for their sacrifices and affirm that the gift of a Saint Mary's education to their daughters is worth the sacri­fice," she said. 
Dampeer said the College is committed to remaining aware of how it is using its resources. 
"Saint Mary's, like all other colleges and universities, will be vigilant in our efforts to be good stewards of our resources during difficult economic times," she said.

Channel, sometimes referred to as the 'Nazi Channel' by pro­fessional historians because of the focus on hot-button topics and military history, and quick­ly written academic history fall under this category, he said. 
Positively speaking, McGreevy said that academic historians are attempting to write for a broader audience and reach beyond scholars. 
Tony Judt's novel 'Postwar' exemplifies the attempt because it is self-consciously aimed at a broadly intellectual audience, he said. 
Professor Linda Przybyszewski, Associate Professor of History, shared her theory of popular history and its five categories, which intrigue and garner attention from the general public. 
The first sub-category, 'Letters in the Attic,' repre­sents already accounted his­toric events that an author tries to reinvent. Novels writ­ten on important historical fig­ures such as George Washington fall under the cat­egory of 'Aren't We Great.' 'Train Wrecks of History' include events such as the Holocaust. The 'That's Weird' category includes events such as convicted murderers, and the 'Sex with Kings' discusses scandals in history. 
Przybyszewski said the gen­eral audience is making more of an effort to bridge the gap between popular and academic history, and professional histo­rians need to appreciate the writing style of popular novel­ists in order to improve aca­demic writing, making aca­demic history accessible for all readers.

Concern rises over detainees 
BAGHDAD -The United Nations expressed concern Tuesday about over­crowding and "grave human rights viola­tions" of detainees in Iraqi custody -in one case, 123 men crammed into a single cell. 
The warning comes as the U.S. prepares to turn over control to the Iraqis of thousands of security detainees in its custody under a new security pact that would end the U.S. mission here by 2012. The pact, approved last week by Iraq's parliament, calls for American forces to transfer all detainees believed to be a major threat and to release the rest "in a safe and orderly manner." 
But as overall violence declines in the country, the U.N.'s 13th report on the human rights situation in Iraq casts doubt on whether the Iraqis will be ready to take cus­tody of more detainees properly. 
Russian warships train with Chavez 
Venezuela -Russian warships have ended training exercises with Venezuela's navy in Moscow's first such Caribbean deployment since the Cold War. 
Russian television on Tuesday showed images of a Venezuelan-operated Sukhoi fighter jet swooping low over Russian war­ships in a simulated air attack. 
The exercises that ended late Monday with a fireworks display included an air defense exercise and joint actions to spot, pursue and detain an intruding vessel, Russian navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said. 
The Russian ships arrived in Venezuela last week in an operation widely seen as a show of Kremlin anger over the U.S. deci­sion to deliver aid to Georgia aboard war­ships following that country's conflict with Russia.

GREENSBORO, N.C. -President George W Bush, trying to emphasize the softer side of his policy record before leaving office, on Tuesday thanked volunteers who have served as mentors to children of prisoners. 
"These youngsters have ambitions and goals," Bush said after a private discussion with a few chil­dren and their mentors in North Carolina. "They want to go to college. They want to make a differ­ence. And I suspect that the mentors will be anxiously following the career of someone they've been able to help." 
Bush popped into the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Greensboro-which has worked with Youth Focm; Inc., a nonprofit agency -to match 220 chil­dren of prisoners with adult mentors. The program is part of a national initiative, championed by Bush, that has provided mentors to more than 110,000 children.

The boy, who authorities said ran away from a Sacramento foster home last year, came into the In-Shape Sport<; Oub in Tracy on Monday wearing only boxer briefS and covered in what appeared to be soot, gym manager Chuck Ellis said. Tracy is about 70 miles south of Sacramento.

Indiana flunks college study 
INDIANA-An independent report on American higher education flunks all but one state when it comes to atfordability -an embarrassing verdict that is unlikely to improve as the economy con­tracts. 
The report card uses a range of measurements to give states grades, from A to F, on the perform­ance of their public and private colleges. 
Besides the F for affordability, Indiana also received grades of C for preparation and participa­tion, B-minus for completion of bachelor's degrees within six years of enrollment, D-plus for benefits and incomplete for learning. 
Obama vows to aid state economies 
The president-elect promises to help governors get thier states back on track 
Associated Press 
PHilADELPHIA-President­elect Barack Obama promised swift action Tuesday on an economic plan "to solve this crisis and to ease the burden on our states," and he cast governors as his partners in crafting a recession-rebound strategy. 
"This administration does not intend to delay in getting you the help that we need," Obama said as he met with the chief executives of most states and sought to rally bipartisan support for an economic stim­ulus. 
The president-elect has set a goal of saving or creating 2.5 million jobs to boost the econ­omy, which experts say has been in recession for the past year. His aides and congres­sional leaders have been dis­cussing the outlines of a meas­ure that could exceed $500 billion over two years. Congress wants to have it ready for his signature shortly after his Jan. 20 inauguration. 
Incoming White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, told reporters that in a private por­tion of the meeting, Obama and Republican and Democratic governors agreed that the measure must focus heavily on money for infra­structure as well as bureau­cratic reforms to make it easi­er to complete programs with­out having to cut through piles of red tape.

ZIMBABWE 


Country faces water cuts, cholera crisis 
Associated Press 
IIAHAHE -As children played near cesspools, their parents shook their heads at a public service announcement drifting over the radio Tuesday: It urged people to boil water before drink­ing it. 
It sounded like a taunt in a country where water and electric­ity are cut ofl' far more than they are on. 
Authorities turned off the taps in Zimbabwe's capital again this week because they had run out of purifying chemicals -even as a cholera epidemic threatened the country, elaiming hundreds of lives since August. 
The crisis is the latest chapter in the collapse of this once-vibrant nation. President Hobert Mugabe, who has ruled for 28 years, has refused to leave office following disputed elections in March. And a power-sharing deal worked out with the opposition has been deadlocked for weeks over how to divvy up Cabinet posts. 
In the township of Mabvuku, where residents have dug shallow wells in open ground, people say they know not boiling the water can make them sick, but they have no choice. There is no elec­tricity. and wood, charcoal or other fuel to build fires is scarce and so expensive it is out of reach for most people. 
"We are afraid, but there is no solution. Most of the time the elec­tricity is not available so we just 
use  the water,"  one  resident,  
Naison  Chakwicha.  told  AP  
Television News.  

In the western Ilarare suburb of Mbare, Anna Marimbe said she had traced the deaths last week of two neighbor children to the stinking open drains where they used to play. 
Hesidents of Chitungwiza. a densely populated township 15 miles south of Harare, sued the National Water Authority last week, saying they had been with­out running water for 13 months, causing an outbreak of cholera and leading to deaths. 
The lawsuit tiled with the High Court describes "largp pools of raw sPwerage" in the streets of the town of 500,000, where the first cholera cases were reported in August. 
Like most of Zimbabwe's main cities and towns, Chitungwiza once had functioning sewage and water delivery systems. but authorities have made no repairs for years. 
Harare is the epicenter of the cholera epidemic, which has spread across the country. Controlling the disease depends on providing clean water. which means repairing broken water and sewage pipes as well as dilap­idated pumping and purification equipment. 

And the collapse of all services, 
including refuse collection, has 
turned the city into a playground 
for rats that threaten to spread 
other more deadly diseases. 
The government has reported 
473 cholera deaths since August 
and a total of 11,700 people 
infected as of Monday, according 
to Paul Garwood, spokesman for 
Health Action and Crises, the 
humanitarian arm of the U.N. 
World Health Organization. 
Garwood said that according to 
the official toll, 4 percent of peo­
ple are dying of a disease that 
usually claims fewer than 1 per­
cent of those infected and is easily 
treated with rehydration salts or 
an intravenous drip. 
Doctors say the death toll is 
nearer 1,000, or 10 percent of vic­
tims, because many of those 
affiicted with cholera die at home 
or in the countryside without 
medical care. 
All the country's main public hospitals have closed and those that continue to operate have little or no medicine and suffer from a shortage of staff, whose monthly salaries do not cover even one day's bus fare to get to work. Costly private clinics. which accept only foreign currency, are out of reach for the vast majority of the population. 
The opposition-controlled Harare City Council is burying cholera victims for free because people cannot afford to buy graves. 
Zimbabwe's government, nor­mally hostile to international aid agencies, is welcoming an initia­tive by several -including UNICEF. WHO and Doctors Without Borders -to provide emergency care and try to ensure safe water supplies. 
Health officials, following the line of a government that has refused to declare a national emergency, insisted the cholera outbreak was under control until five days ago. The best advice Health Minister David Parirenyatwa could offer was to urge people to stop shaking hands. 
"I want to stress the issue of shaking hands. Although it's part of our tradition to shake hands, it's high time people stopped shaking hands," he told state-run daily, The Herald. 
Still, Zimbabweans continue to lind ways to deal with the crisis. 
Those who can afford it are dig­ging wells and bore holes. Others are buying tanks and pumps to install on their roof or yards, then paying $50 in foreign currency for a single delivery of 500 gallons of water. 
Most vendors in Zimbabwe only accept U.S. dollars or South African rand since the Zimbabwe dollar, once on a par with the greenback, devalues with each passing hour. 

In-law charged with murder 
Suspect already in custody in Jennifer Hudson's family slayings 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO Jennifer 
Hudson's brother-in-law was 
charged with murder 
Tuesday in the shooting 
deaths of three of the 
actress's family members, 
including the 7 -year-old son 
of his estranged wife. 
William Balfour had been in custody since Oct. 24, when the bodies of Hudson's moth­er, Darnell Hudson Donerson, and brother, Jason Hudson, were discovered in their South Side home. The body of Julian King, Balfour's stepson and Hudson's nephew, was found in a sport utility ~chicle three days later. 
Until Balfour's arrest in the murder case Monday. police had publicly identified him only as a "person of interest" in the investigation. Balfour, 27, who previously was held on a parole violation, is charged with three counts of first-degree murder and one count of felony home inva­sion. 
Balfour's attorney said his client is insistent about his innocence. 
"It is scary as hell, he's charged with terrible crimes that he adamantly contends he's not guilty of," attorney Joshua Kutnick said before the announcement of the charges, which he said he expected. 
Still, added Kutnick, "He's exhibited to me, at least. the patience to let the process unfold." 
Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weis said at a news conference 
Tuesday that although Balfour has not confessed to the crimes, he is "confident in the evidence." Investigators have not said what evidence they have linking Balfour to the killings, but said Tuesday that they are not looking for other suspects and believe Balfour acted alone. 
"There is physical evi­dence," Deputy Superintendent Steve Peterson said, but he stopped short of saying whether that evidence linked Balfour to the crimes. 
Weis praised the communi­ty for the way it "stepped up to the plate and helped police solve this case," but would not provide any details. 
Police have said from the beginning that the slayings were domestic related, but they have not elaborated. They would not say. for example, if they believed the boy was part of any dispute between Balfour and his estranged wife, Hudson's older sister, Julia Hudson. 
Police believe Julian was killed inside the SUV the same day as the adults, but "the exact timing" has not been determined, Peterson said. 
Police have said far less than Illinois Prison Heview Board Chairman Jorge Montes, who told reporters last month that Balfour's girl­friend or ex-girlfriend told police she saw Balfour with a gun "identical" to the weapon police recovered near the SUV where the boy's body was found -which they have said was the murder weapon. 
When asked about the woman Tuesday, Peterson said that she cooperated with police, but would not say what information she provid­ed, if any. Nor would he say that detectives have linked the weapon to Balfour. 
Jennifer Hudson's publicist Lisa Kasteler declined to comment after Balfour's arrest on Monday, but Peterson said the family was "relieved and happy that the Chicago Police Department 
would bring this case to  a  
successful conclusion."  
Jennifer  Hudson  was  a  

finalist in the 2004 season of "American Idol" and won her Oscar in 2007 for her film debut. a supporting role in "Dreamgirls." She has mostly stayed out of the spotlight and close to her family since the killings. 
Detectives went to Stateville Correctional Center Monday afternoon, served an arrest warrant on Balfour and brought him back to Chicago. 
Balfour had been in custody since the day the adults' bod­ies were discovered. After 48 hours -the longest Chicago police can hold a person with­out charges -he was taken by the Illinois Department of Corrections on a suspected parole violation. Balfour had served seven years for a 1999 attempted murder and vehic­ular hijacking conviction. 
Balfour is scheduled to appear in bond court Wednesday afternoon. After the hearing, Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez will talk about the case, her office said Tuesday. 

Economy spurs enlistment 
Recession causes soldiers to stay in military, receive steady paychecks 
Associated Press 
FOHT HILEY, Kan. -Sgt. Hyan Nyhus spent 14 months patrolling the dead­ly streets of Baghdad. where five members of his platoon were shot and one died. As bad as that was, he would rather go back there than take his chances in this bru­tal job market. 
Nyhus re-enlisted last Wednesday, and in so doing joined the growing ranks of those choosing to stay in the 
U.S. military because of the bleak economy. 
"In the Army, you're always guaranteed a steady paycheck and a job," said the 21-year-old Nyhus. "Deploying's something that's going to happen. That's a fact of life in the Army -a fact of life in the infantry." 
In 2008, as the stock mar­ket cratered and the hous­ing market collapsed, more young members of the Army, Air Force and Navy decided to re-up. While sev­eral factors might explain the rise in re-enlistments, including a decline in vio­lence in Iraq, Pentagon offi­cials acknowledge that bad news for the economy is usually good news for the military. 
In fact, the Pentagon just completed its strongest recruiting year in four years. 
"We do benefit when things look less positive in civil society," said David Chu, undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness. "What difficult economic times give us, I think, is an opening to make our case to people who we might not otherwise have." 
The retention rate of early-career soldiers in the Army has risen steadily over the past four years and now stands 20 percentage points higher than it was in fiscal 2004. As for the Navy and the Air Force, early-and mid-career sailors and air­men re-enlisted at a higher rate in October than during the same period in 2007. The Marine Corps was not immediately able to provide comparative figures on re­enlistments. 
Alex Stewart joined the Army two years ago, when the factory where he worked as a welder started laying off. He was sent to Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division, which suffered 87 deaths last year, the highest total suffered by the 20,000-member unit since the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan began. 
When his hitch was up in earlier this year, the 32­year-old from Grand Hapids, Mich., didn't hesitate to re­up for five more years. 
"I want a stable life for my wife in a very shaky econo­my," Stewart said. "There were no other options." 
Stewart's new assignment will take him to Germany, where he will serve as a truck driver, though it is always possible he could be sent back into combat. 
"I figure if I do another five or 10 years in the Army," he said, "the econo­my will turn around and I can get a truck-driving job." 
Army Spc. Alicia Fauls, 20, of the Woodlands, Texas, had two years to go when she re-enlisted last week at Fort Riley, home of the Army's 1st Infantry Division, which has one brigade in Iraq, one headed home and another preparing to ship out. She has not been sent into the war zone yet but knows an assignment in Iraq or Afghanistan is prob­ably in her future. 
"I did have only two years left, but I'm not sure what I would do," Fauls said. "It's harder to find jobs. If I do wait"to get out, the economy should be in better shape."

IN BRIEF 
Car sales sink to worst level since 1982 
NEW YORK -U.S. auto sales plunged 37 percent in November to their worst level in more than 26 years, dashing expectations that this dismal year for vehicle demand had found a bottom, and adding more ammunition to the Detroit automakers' case for a con­gressional lifeline. 
"Our industry is in a much more severe situation than the rest of the economy," said Mike DiGiovanni, General Motors Corp.'s executive director of global market and industry analysis. "We cannot continue at these level<> or el<>e the entim industry is going to go down." 
U.S. auto sales in November fell to 746,789, accord­ing to Autodata Corp. On a seasonally adjusted basis, automakers reported an annual sales rate of10.2 mil­lion unil<>, the lowest level since October 1982. 
Automakers and analysts blamed the crumbling economy, less access to vehicle financing, and a wait­and-see approach among consumers more preoccu­pied with the value of their homes and the fate of their jobs than the lure of a new car. 
"Consumers (are) not showing up at the dealerships -regardless of the deals they're being offered and regardless of how low the gas prices go," said Jesse Toprak, executive director of industry analysis for the automotive Web site Edmunds. com. 
EPA eases mining waste disposal 
WASHINGTON -The Environmental Protection Agency, rejecting pleas from state governors and environmental groups, signed off Tuesday on making it easier to dump mountaintop mining waste near rivers and streams. 
But the EPA said it did so because it secured additional safeguards. 
The governors of Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as other lawmakers from those states, had urged EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson to block the rule -which would rewrite a regulation enacted in 1983 that bars mining companies from dumping huge waste piles within 100 feet of temporary streams when it could diminish water quality and quantity. 
Under a provision of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act -promulgated largely by the Interior Department-the EPA must concur in writing to any mining regula­tions that could affect air and water quality.

Viewpoint Patricia Fernandez 
It's that time of year again: the prover­bial "most wonderful time of the year." I, however, disagree with this statement. I want to make it publicly known that, much like Oscar the Grouch, I hate Christmas. 
I've never under­stood why Christmas is such a happy and cheerful holiday for people. So many of my Christmases have been fouled and disturbed by such very different events and occur­rences that I have come to have no faith nor trust in this ostensible day of warmth and family love. 
First Instance: 
I believed in Santa Claus for a very long time. My innocence was taken from me at a much later age than you would expect based on my current cynicism and bitterness. 
It was when I was eight, during a rou­tine early December game of hide-and­seek with my sister Katie, that I stum­bled upon a set of gifts that looked like it could be for me. At first I was incredu­lous. Why would my mom buy gifts for my cousins that she knew I would like and why would she put them in the stor­age space that I clearly was going to use as my hiding place? How dare she be so inconsiderate? I stormed back upstairs, ended the game, and demanded answers from my mother. 
"Well, Andrew, those are not actually fur your cousins." 
I needed to know who they could pos­sibly be for if not for the cousins I had assumed. 
"Those are your Christmas gifts." 
When on Christmas morning, I went to open the gifts labeled "From Santa" and saw that they were the very gifts that my mom had "hidden" in the storage space, I finally knew that Santa did not exist. 

Christmas ruined. 
Seeond Instance: 
My sister Maureen always used to joke around with me about what she was getting me for Christmas. "This year I'm going to get you a whole sock full of rocks, Andrew." But she never got me any rocks. "This year I'm going to give you a push down the stairs, Andrew." But the push never came. "This year I'm going to give you a big box of nothing, Andrew." But on Christmas morning, as always, there was a legitimate present under the tree to me from my dear sis­ter Maureen. 
Then the next year, the motif of the "box of nothing" beeame a running gag in my family. Maureen, Katie and I would light-heartedly threaten on birth­days, anniversaries and any gift-giving celebration that the "box of nothing" would rear its intangible and depressing head. Maureen, more so than either Katie or I. loved talking about how one of these days she would give me the "box of nothing." Finally as sehool start­ed in September the joke became tired and we all moved on with our lives. 
Around Advent-time that year, I devel­oped a cane fascination that has stuck with me to this day. I wanted a cane so badly that the only thing on my Christmas list was a gentleman's walk­ing stick. As soon as the tree went up, Maureen put a present under it labeled from her to me. I looked at it confused but then she told me that she had bought me a collapsible cane. It didn't matter if it wasn't exactly a gentleman's walking stick-it was a cane! On Christmas morning I rushed to open this gift, tore ofT the wrapping paper, and there inside the box were pipe cleaners spelling out N-0-T-H-I-N-G. A literal box of nothing. I cried. 
Christmas Huined. 
Third Instance: 
When I was 14, I asked my parents il'l could have an electric guitar for Christmas. They said no. On Christmas morning I woke up and sure enough, there was an electric guitar, but it was­n't the one I wanted. 
Christmas ruined. 
Now I'm not one to hold a grudge, but these three Christmases have combined with a bunch of other lousy memories that make me want to just do away with the whole event. I'm sick of people buy­ing into such a campy, over-emotional, sap-filled crap-fest. 
Honestly, Christmastime is a nonsensi­cal and delusional period of time in our lives. What makes people change their routine unhappiness and all of a sudd1m adopt the most carefree and joyous atti­tude possible? Let's all drink hot cocoa! Let's all sing carols! Let's all spread Christmas cheer! 
Nuts to that. When will people wake up and realize that Christmas is miser­able. In my mind there's only one day worse than Christmas and that's Christmas Eve: all the build up and fake­ness of Christmas with none of the gifts. Headers, I implore you do not buy into this holiday season. Sure it may seem tempting. But after it's over, where arn you left? 
With your family, in your home, trying to relive any good moments that may or may not have actually happened. 
Merry Christmas. 
P.S. -Some people may assume that I'm simply discussing the commercial­ization of Christmas. That's not what I'm on about at all. I'm talking about every­thing related to the Holiday we collec­tively celebrate on Dec. 25. Eliminating Christmas is my prescription. It's not like there aren't other days to receive presents throughout the year. Think about your birthday. And then it's just you-you don't have to share the gift­receiving spotlight with anybody else. Unless your twin. But twins are a differ­ent story, readers. and not something I'm willing to discuss in my Christmas column.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Catholic schools should support all children 
Aim.ing at the -wrong target 
It is easy to read not only the outrage, but the pain in Liz Froehke's letter on Nov. 17 (Lack of Acceptance an Issue of Ignorance). We share that pain. At the same time. please allow me to respond to Liz's challenge regarding Catholic schools as a Catholic educator as well as a lifelong advocate of all students with learning and behavioral issues. 
The Nov. 17 Observer came to my ofllce just as twenty Catholic school edu­cators from Florida, Tennessee, Texas, Michigan. Illinois. Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland and the District of Columbia were deep in con­versation in the next room discussing the knowledge and skills needed by Catholic schoolteachers to ensure that "all Catholic schools are prepared to educate thH children of God regardless of special needs in language acquisition, learning, behavior, or social economic status" (ACE position statement on Inclusion, 2008). Are these teachers and educators the exception? Not at all. Catholic schools across the country are accepting children with special needs. In a survey of our ACE (Alliance for Catholic Education) teachers just last month, 98 percent reported having children with learning and behavioral issues in their classrooms, including children with Down's Syndrome and Autism. 
It is not enough, however, for Catholic schools to accept children that have learning differences. These schools and te~c.q,~_rs need the resources. and skills so that the special gifts of persons with dis­abilities can be celebrated within our classrooms. To that end, ACE has three initiatives under way. First, we are edu­cating Catholic educators, such as those here this week, to become trainers for Catholic dioceses across the country in the strategies needed to help Catholic schoolteachers meet the individual learning needs of the "differently abled." Many of those being trained are gradu­ates of the ACE program who have remained teaching in Catholic schools and are committed to this vision. Secondly, through our new office of ACE Consulting, we are providing workshops to diocesan superintendents on the opportunities for accessing federal dol­lars to support the services for children with special needs whose parents choose to place them in our Catholic schools. Lastly, the ACE faculty, just this week. reviewed a proposal for a new ACE certi­fication program in Mild Disabilities for Catholic schoolteachers. 
We understand that at present, teach­ers in Catholic schools are typically unequipped to face the challenges of helping diverse learners reach their God­given potential. These initiatives, there­fore, are built upon a core belief that every baptized child has a right to a Catholic education. We seek to provide within our nation's Catholic schools a more welcoming and inclusive -and indeed effective -learning environment for children with diverse educational abilities. With the help of the Holy Spirit, ACE might contribute in some same way to assist schools in accommodating the richly diverse learning needs of all God's children.

Notre Dam.e arrogance 
The recent football spectacle created by Charlie Weis ought to be used as an opportunity for the entire University to reassess an unfortunate culture that has developed over the years at Notre Dame. And that is Notre Dame arrogance. 
Arrogance is embedded in all environ­ments at Notre Dame: the students. the alumni, the faculty, athletics, probably even the subway alums. It overwhelmed me when I walked on to campus in the fall of 1994. 
For example, I had a professor that told me that he knew that the reason I left my home state and came to Notre Dame was so that I could get a real edu­cation. My senior year, our class embarassed ourselves in the final weeks before graduation as we criticized the selection of our graduation speaker. One little girl commented that even the University of Oklahoma got Margaret Thatcher. 
Now, Weis has thrust Notre Dame arrogance into the national media. What is sad about arrogance is it is counter­productive to the goals and ideals that are Notre Dame. We should and often do boast about our committment to aca­demics, especially with our student ath­letes. What we have done by not com­promising our academic integrity with our athletes, when almost every other university in today's world does, is a true accomplishment. 
The arrogance of Notre Dame tarnish­es, if not overshadows, this fantastic accomplishment. We have a lot to be proud of at Notre Dame. I am proud to be a Notre Dame alumni. But we would be well-served if we used this Charlie Weis spectacle as an opportunity to be introspective and reassess the culture of arrogance that has developed at Notre Dame throughout the years. 
Todd Meador alum Nov. 30 

ND students should be extremely unhappy and the snowballs are indicative of their frustraction. However, the misguided idiots who hurled the snowballs at cameramen are aiming at the wrong target. 
Mounting frustration (not snow­balls) should be directed at the administration. Home football games are something this school is supposed to hold sacred. 
Many students choose to attend the school in large part because they want to be a part of the ND football experience (I did in 1988). For many students, the home games are highlights of the school year (once again. true of me). 
Despite this, the administration willingly and openly prostituted the entire football experience by selling it to NBC. Football games should not last 4.5 hours. If a game is more than three hours, it lacks rhythm and flow. The constant, extended commercial interruptions greatly diminish the experience for the stu­dents, the players and the fans across the country. Also, the team loses a big part of its home field advantage when these long breaks drain much of the emotion in the stadium. As the game is so annoy­ingly stretched into a marathon, it is difficult for fans to maintain their enthusiasm and for players to feed off of it. 
The administration needs to pro­tect home football games for those who love them instead of selling it to those who seek only profit. Yes, the NBC contract ensures that I can see every home game on tv; howev­er, I will take the sanctity of football Saturday at NO over that assurance in a heartbeat. I love ND football. I will find a way to watch it when the NBC debacle ends and I will enjoy it so much more.

Rules for selecting head 
coaches 
It's been 20 years since our last national title. In the two decades between 1966 and 1988 we won four. What makes the most recent twenty years so empty? 
Compare the head coaches. Ara Parseghian, Dan Devine and Lou Holtz all had 13 or more years of head coaching experience and win­ning percentages of .644 or greater prior to arriving at Notre Dame. Lou and Dan also won big bowl games during their successful years at Arkansas and Missouri. Ara and Lou turned around horrible Big Ten teams (Northwestern and Minnesota). 
I could keep going, but the point is, all three had extremely successful and impressive head coaching resumes before being hired by ND. Bob Davie and Charlie Weis had zero head coaching experience. George O'Leary and Ty Willingham had no more than eight years of head coaching experi­ence. Their winning percentages prior to ND were .611 and .550. 
This may sound obvious, but Notre Dame should stick with what works and hire nothing less than coaches with proven records of head coaching success as we did with Ara, Dan, and Lou. 
Unfortunately, this hasn't been obvi­ous during the last 12 years. We've broken with a winning tradition and hired individuals that didn't meet our golden Notre Dame standard. We've made the "Gerry Faust Error" four times in a row. If we're looking for the next Knute Rockne or Frank Leahy (who both had zero or very little head coaching experience) we haven't been very lucky. 
Plus, college football was in its infant stages prior to 1950 and the ultra-competitive nature of today's football requires a well defmed head coach selection process. 
Pilots with only a few years of expe­rience shouldn't be chosen to fly Air Force One. The President's surgeon shouldn't be the young fellow that just finished his residency. 
In the same way, the individual selected to coach Notre Dame Football should not be someone that has less than 13 years of head coach experience and a winning percentage less than .644. A spectacular turn­around and bowl game wins on his resume would, of course, be pre­ferred. 
Notre Dame is not the place for new head coaches to start their careers or mediocre coaches to build their resumes. Notre Dame is the place where the best coaches in college football go to make history.

2) White Christmas (1954) 
In this musical, two army buddies from World War II, now song-and-dance men, try to woo a sister act while the four of them put on a stage show to save a failing winter resort. 
3) A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) 
The half-hour television special, the first with Charles Schultz's "Peanuts" characters, denounces the materialism of Christmas, with Charlie Brown getting a wilting tree instead of an aluminum one and linus bringing it all to a crescendo when he recites the Nativity story from the Gospel of Luke. 
4) The Santa Clause (1994) 
Tim Allen. tliCn at the top of his "Home Improvement" fame, stars as Scott Calvin. a guy who accidentally kills Santa Claus and because of that, must become the next one, whether he likes it or not. 
5) How the Grinch Stole Christmas (1966) 
The original TV special, adapted from Dr. Seuss's book, continues in the same vein of "A Charlie Brown Christmas," with tlw Grinch realizing that Christmas is more than "packages, boxes, or bags!" 
6) Home Alone (1990) 
Macaulay Culkin's character gets left behind on Christmas, and must fend off boredom, insecurity and bur­glars until his parent<> make it home. llilarity ensues. This movie was the top grossing movie of the 90s, until "Titanic" came along. 
7) A Christmas Story (1983) 
It's December in 1940s northern Indiana and all Ralphie wants for Christmas is Red Ryder BB gun. "A Christmas Story" turns 25 years old this year, but the sight gags of Halphie's friend's tongue lrozen to the flag pole, the bunny suit and the leg lamp probably won't get old anytime soon. 
8) Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964) 
Of all the stop-motion specials produced by Rankin and Bass. Hudolph has endured the longest. It's got memorable characters (a misfit reindeer, an elf who longs to bn a den­tist. a gold miner named Yukon Cornelius, and of course, s.an~a) and,catehy musk. from the title song to "Holly Jolly (.Jmstma<>. 
9) Love Actually (2003) 
Intertwining at least nine difl(mmt love stories, this movie is a must for anyone experiencing the holiday blues. Surn, there are some downbeat parts. but when the little girl belL<> out Mariah Can~y·s "All I Want for Christmas Is You" at the end. you'd have to be a real Scrooge to resist the Christmas cheer. 
10) Elf (2003) 
The 6-foot tall Buddy (Will Ferrell), clad in an elf ensem­ble straight out of "Hudolph," discovers he is actually a human adopted by the North Pole, and sets out to reeon­neet with his real father. Ferrell is both convincing and hilarious in a movie that generated such catchphrases as "Santa! I know him!"

All of these Christmas preparations and celebrations remind us of the spiritual side of Notre Dame. The first advent candle has been lit in the Basilica and chapels across campus, hymns like "0 Come, 0 Come Emmanuel" fill us with anticipation, and the nativity scenes set up at the grotto, the Dome and O'Shaughnessy become a visual reminder of why we celebrate Christmas. We start to think about giving back as service projects and donation drives abound, remind­ing us to care for the people that are not guaranteed a good Christmas. The heart of Notre Dame is about considering what matters most; you can find a good education at many universities, but Christmastime is just one reminder that Notre Dame is about something more. 
So take time to breathe in the crisp winter air, bask in the glow of Christmas lights, and remember that there are more important things than just making it through the last few weeks of papers and exams.

Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Six play­ers, including the heart of the Minnesota Vikings' stout defensive line, were sus­pended for four games without pay by the NFL on Tuesday for violating the league's anti-doping policy. 
All six were punished for using a diuretic, which can serve as a masking agent for steroids. 
The suspended players were running back Deuce McAllister and defensive linemen Charles Grant and Will Smith of New Orleans; defensive linemen Kevin and Pat Williams of Minnesota; and long snap­per Bryan Pittman of Houston. 
A seventh playe~ Atlanta's Grady Jackson, was not suspended. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said league chief counsel Jeff Pash had asked for addi­tional information from Jackson. 
The punishment is an especially harsh blow to Minnesota, which leads the NFC North and relies heavi­ly on the two Williamses in its run defense, which ranks second in the league. 
Angelo Wright, the agent for Pat and Kevin Williams, said he would file a motion in federal court Wednesday morning, presumably to put offthe suspensions. 
If a player's team makes the playoffs, the player will be eligible to return to the active roster on Dec. 29. 
Asked about the late scheduling of the suspen­sions, Adolpha Birch, the NFLs vice president of law and labor policy, said the timing was "a function of a lot of factors." 
"I think if you ask most coaches, every game is important. I don't think they'd clifferentiate between the first and the last," Birch said in a conference calL "We do have things in place to get them done as quickly as possible. But we had to deal with the number of players involved and adjust travel schedules. We have to fit it around the players' ability to attend." 

David Cornwell, the lawyer for the three Saints, called the decisions "incon­sistent with the objectives of the steroid policy." 
"Deuce, Will, and Charles did not try to enhance their performance with steroids, nor did they knowingly expose themselves to the adverse health risks of a diuretic," Cornwell said in an e-maiL "They took a weight loss supplement that they had every reason to believe was safe." 
In their appeals, some players said the banned substance Bumetanide was not listed as an ingredient in StarCaps, an over-the­counter weight-loss pill. 
IN BRIEF Kell_y says he'll remain 
head coach at Cincinnati 
CINCINNATI -Coach Brian Kelly tried to end speculation Tuesday that he's leaving No. 13 Cincinnati, saying that he's happy with the football pro­gram's development and he plans to stay. 
He was upbeat Tuesday following a meeting with the school's president, AD and the head of its board of trustees to get an update on plans to expand the Bearcats' small football stadium and to improve their practice fields. 
Kelly acknowledged that other schools had expressed an interest in him, but said he's not interested in leav­ing. 
"All I can say is that with all the spec­ulation and all the jobs that have been out there, sooner or later 'no' means 'no,"' Kelly said. "Again, no one can ever speak in terms of forever and ever, but what I can tell you is there's been a lot of interest in my services, and I want to be here at the University of Cincinnati because of the right reasons." 
McGrady_ to miss three 
weeks with knee injury 
HOUSTON -Houston guard Tracy McGrady will miss three weeks to rehabilitate his sore left knee, another blow to an injury-plagued season for the Rockets. 
McGrady sat out Houston's last three games after starting the first 15. He had arthroscopic surgery on May 6, but said Tuesday that doctors have told him that the knee is not healed. 
"Obviously, I came back a little bit too early," said McGrady, who was averag­ing 15.6 points. ''I'm just not ready." 
McGrady visited renowned orthope­dist James Andrews on Monday. The team said Andrews confinned the ini­tial medical assessment by team doctor Tom Oanton that McGrady is suffering from general soreness in the knee. 
Saturday will mark seven months since the surgery, and McGrady said doctors told him that his knee would require 6 to 8 months to heal. He said Andrews reassured him that he won't need more surgery. 
Quinn to have season­
ending finger surgery 
CLEVELAND -Brady Quinn has decided to get his frac­tured finger fixed. 
After weighing his options over the past week, Cleveland's quarterback has elected to have surgery on his right index finger, which he initially broke on Nov. 17 at Buffalo and then made worse by playing in the Browns' game a week later against Houston. 
The team said that Quinn's operation will be performed on Wednesday in Birmingham, Ala., by hand specialist Dr. Thomas Hunt. The procedure, which will likely involve a pin being inserted in Quinn's finger to stabilize the bone and dam­aged tendon, will require up to 10 weeks of recovery time.

Miller's 28 help end 76ers skid 
Billups tallies double-double in win; Barea's three caps Dallas comeback 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Andre Miller scored nine of his season-high 28 points in overtime Tuesday night and the Philadelphia 76ers ended their four-game losing streak with a 103-95 vic­tory over the Chicago Bulls. 
Andre Iguodala added 25 points and Elton Brand had 22 points and 14 rebounds as the Sixers avenged a loss to the Bulls two days ago in Philadelphia. 
Derrick Rose led Chicago with 24 points and Ben Gordon added 18. Tyrus Thomas had 14 points and 13 boards. 
Thomas' thunderous followup dunk tied at 90 with 17.6 sec­onds left in regulation. 
The Sixers had the last shot, but after holding the ball and running down the clock, Iguodala drove the lane and fed in the corner to Miller, whose shot was short. 
But in overtime Miller took over. He had a three-point play and then a soft jumper to give Philadelphia a 99-92 lead: 
Philly, which led by 15 Sunday before losing to the Bulls 103-92, had a 16-point cushion Tuesday and was also ahead by nine in the fourth quarter before Chicago rallied. 
But this time the Sixers held on. 
Brand's jump hook gave the Sixers a 79-70 lead in regula­tion. Iguodala's drive along the base line and thundering dunk kept the lead at seven with three minutes remaining. 
Rose drove for a bank shot and Drew Gooden's two free throws after a nifty pass from Rose brought the Bulls to within two with 1:15 to play. 
Thomas blocked a shot by Miller but then was called for an offensive foul at the other end with 40 seconds remaining. 
But a driving Iguodala lost the ball under the basket with 
23.9 seconds to go and the 
Bulls had a last chance. After a timeout Rose, drove the basket and missed but Thomas fol­lowed it up with a slam to tie the game with 17.6 seconds to go. 
Iguodala's three-point play and then steal and dunk in the final seconds of the third quar­ter highlighted a strong 12-2 finish for the 76ers as they took a 67-61lead. 
Looking flat after a seven­game road trip that ended Sunday with the victory over the Sixers in Philly, the Bulls fell behind by 1 0 after a listless first quarter in which they had eight turnovers and shot 33 percent. 
Philadelphia went up 30-14 in the second quarter. But the Bulls chopped away and after a rally that saw them shoot 58 percent in the second period, they actually had a chance for the halftime lead before Andres Nocioni's baseline jumper was long with about half a minute left. Iguodala's banker put Philadelphia up three at the half. 
Nuggets 132, Raptors 93 
Thanks to Chauncey Billups, Carmelo Anthony doesn't have to shoulder the Denver Nuggets' offense while grap­pling with an ailing right elbow. 
Billups had 24 points and 14 assists in Denver's rout of the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday night in a game that was out of reach by halftime. 
After a slow start, Anthony finished with 23 points 48 hours after scoring just one bucket in 14 agonizing minutes against Houston, which snapped his NBA-best double­digit streak at 222 games. 
Jermaine O'Neal returned from a sprained left ankle that had cost him three games and he scored 12 points to go with Chris Bosh's 24, but they could­n't keep the Raptors from being routed. 
Nene added 19 points and 11

boards for the Nuggets, who are 12-3 since trading Allen Iverson to the Detroit Pistons for Billups, the Denver native and former University of Colorado star whose homecom­ing has gone better than any­body would have expected. 
Thanks to Billups' play up and down the court, this game was never in doubt even with Anthony's fitful start. During Billups' 32 minutes of playing time, the Nuggets were an incredible plus-48 on the score­board. 
Anthony's right elbow has been bothering him since train­ing camp but has gotten pro­gressively worse over the last couple of weeks. He received treatment on the team's off-day and skipped much of the Nuggets' shootaround Tuesday morning, then returned to the starting lineup. 
He missed his first four shots and two of his first four free throws before finding a rhythm. He even passed up some shots early on that he normally takes and banked a layup off the glass for a 24-second violation before swishing a 17-foot jumper that gave Denver a 47­28lead. 
Mavericks 100, Clippers 98 
Jose Barea hit the go-ahead 3-pointer in the final minute, Dirk Nowitzki scored 29 points and the Dallas Mavericks ral­lied from a 15-point deficit to beat the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday night. 
Barea capped Dallas' closing 18-4 run with a long-range jumper with 50.2 seconds left that gave Dallas its only lead of the game. 
After the teams exchanged empty possessions, the Clippers had a chance to win. 
Baron Davis missed a 3-point­er with just over a second left and Nowitzki grabbed the rebound as time expired. After the final buzzer sounded, team­mates mobbed Barea under the basket. 
Jason Terry scored 26 points for the Mavericks, who moved over .500 for the first time this season. Barea chipped in with a season-high 15 points, and Brandon Bass added 14. 
Zach Randolph had 27 points and 10 rebounds, AI Thornton had 23 points and Davis added 22 points for the Clippers, who didn't score in fmal 2:55. 
Steve Novak hit a jumper early in the fourth to give Los Angeles an 83-68 lead as the Clippers seemed poised to win its second game over the Mavericks this season. 
The Clippers still led by 12 with seven minutes left when the Mavericks, behind a three­guard lineup of Jason Kidd, Terry and Barea, started their comeback. 
Nowitzki's putback cut the Clippers' lead to 96-91. After Thornton's jumper put Los Angeles up 98-91, the Mavericks scored final nine points of the game. 
Terry hit jumper and a layup that brought Dallas to 98-97 with 1:15 left. 
After Eric Gordon missed a jumper, Kidd found Barea for a 3-pointer from the left wing. 
The Mavericks have won seven of eight since starting the season 2-7. The Clippers have lost five in a row and 18 of 21 in Dallas.

Hidderwall's ovnrtime game­
winner against Michigan in last 
ynar's national semifinal didn't 
grant him rnprinve from his 
teammatns' hmsing, but maybe 
the CCIII\ offensive player of 
the Wtlek award hn earned 
ovtw thn weekend will. 
"It's awesomn," Hidderwall said of thn award. "It's one of those things that shows all thn work you've benn putting in is paying off. It's good to get awards. but a lot of it is also bncause of my lincmates. We've btJcn clicking these last couple games hnre." 
Hidderwall. a native of 
Stockholm. Sweden. scored live 
points (two goals. three assists) 
in two games against Western 
Michigan over tlw weekend. lie 
has now tallied 14 points over 
a five-game point streak that 
includes a pair of four-point 
outings. 
Hidderwall's 18 points (seven goals. 11 assists) tie him for the team lead, and his five goals and 12 points on the power play are also team highs. 
"Calle's been playing well for a while now, but this is the first real opportunity to show the offensive skills and the scoring skills we felt he had when we rncruited him," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said. "I think part of it was [freshman right wing[ Hilly Maday coming on board and the chnmistry those two have with Kevin Deeth. It's just worked out to our advantage." 
After Hidderwall joined the Irish last fall with high expec­tations. Jackson said he gave the freshman too much respon­sibility by starting him on the power play and penalty kill units. 
"Calle fit right in. He's a great kid, he's always got a smile on his face, and I think his teammates liked him a lot as a freshman," Jackson said. "The biggest problem was that we knew what kind of player he could be. and I gave him too much ... and he kind of strug­gled with it." 
When he reduced Hidderwall's role, Jackson said the freshman's confidence suf­fered for a period of time ­but once Hidderwall regained it. he showed why his future looked so bright in the first place. 

"We expected him to be a 
pretty exciting player for us. 
and it didn't happen right 
away," Jackson said. "Once he 
got back in [the lineup] near 
the end of [last[ year. he start­
ed to show some real improve­
ment in his understanding of 
the game ... Now it's not even a 
concern of mine. lie's done a 
really good job of learning to 
play the system." 
That learning experience has 
bcwn vital to his success early 
in his sophomore season, 
Hidderwall said. 
"I needed a longer adjust­ment period, having kind of a slow freshman year, so I think last year was more a learning experience for me than a pro­duetive year when it comes to hockey," Hidderwall said. "I think freshman year has defi­nitely helped me [in terms of'J confidence and getting play time ... Now, it feels awesome when you have a little bit of confidence from the coaching staff and you can play your own game, make a mistake and still play. I'd say confidence is a huge part of success." 
But Hidderwall is a different player than he was a year ago from a physical standpoint as well. liB stayed on campus for summer school and additional strength training and then con­tinued that program for the rest of the off-season, putting on nearly 15 pounds of muscle. 
"We always knew he had a good shot and really good puck skills," Jackson said. "The biggest thing for him corning into collegH hockey, I don't think he was strong enough physically ... The additional strength has helped him win a lot more of those battles for loosH pucks and rebounds, and getting second opportunities at pucks helps you score goals." 
As for the ribbing he receives from his teammates. Hidderwall knows it's all in good fun. 
As for that hockey thing? lie's got that down. 
"We're a pretty closH team and we're all friends," Hidderwall said. "Whenever there's something I don't really get or something I don't under­stand. I always have a team­matH to help me out. But when you get out there on the ice, it's not that different."

continued from page 20 

Notre Dame's previous two games -with seven threes and 27 points. In all, the Irish hit 19 three-pointers in 3 7 attempts, setting a Notre Dame and Joyce Center record for three-pointers made. 
"I should've bought a ticket tonight." Irish coach Mike Brey said with a laugh after the game. "All I did was sub guys." 
The onslaught began on Notre Dame's first possession, when forward Luke Zeller, who Iinished with eight points and six rebounds, spotted up outside against South Dakota's 2-3 zone and knocked down a three. Ayers followed with a corner jumper -one of the rarfl two-pointers that he took. Then McA!arney hit a three and Ayers hit his first from beyond the arc. The Irish led 11-0, forcing South Dakota to take a timeout -all within the first two minutes of the game. 
"Usually you see teams make adjustments [defensively[ as guys hit one or two [three­pointers[, but that didn't really happen until Hyan hit seven," said senior forward Zach llillesland, who finished with six points and nine rebounds. 
At this point, Ayers and McAlarney were just getting warmed up. 
Ayers hit another three on Notre Dame's first trip down the floor following the timeout. Zeller then downed his second and Ayers followed with a cor­ner three to put the Irish up 20-2 with 16:34 left in the half. 
"As soon as we learned about their zone we were drooling," Hillesland said. "Because what team in their right mind would want to zone such a prolific shooting team as we have. You have arguably the best shooter in the country [in McAlarney[ and we don't think Hyan's that far behind. You have a big guy like Luke Zeller and you bring in guys off the bench that can hit threes. Pick your poison. If you play zone, you're going to have to leave one of them open." 

Ayers drained still another three following the media timeout with 15:46 left the half. McAlarney followed with three treys to put the Irish up 36-13 with 10:31 left in the half. 
Ayers would spread out his next three from beyond the arc the rest of the half as Notre Dame took a 60-30 lead into the half. 
South Dakota cut the lead to 78-59 in the second half. at which point Brey but his starters back in the game. On Notre Dame's next trip down the floor, Ayers knocked down another three to stern the Coyotes' run. Notre Dame quickly went on another run of its own, and went up 89-59 seemingly in the blink of an eye. Ayers had a chance to tie McAlarney's program record of 10 3-pointers in one game, which McAlarney set last week against North Carolina. but his attempt from the left wing missed. Then Brey took him and the other starters out of the game the rest of the way. Junior guard Tory Jackson fin­ished with 10 assists in the three-point exhibition. 
Note: 

+Brey said that he will take things "day-to-day" with junior forward Luke llarangody, who has sat out Notre Dame's last two games because of pneu­monia. His status for Saturday's game against Ohio State is undetermined.

Ayers drops 35 points in rout ofSouth Dakota 
By CHRIS HINE Editor-in-Chief 
The Irish sent a warning shot across the bow of each of their opponents with their 102-76 win over South Dakota -play a zone and Ryan Ayers or Kyle MeAiarncy will burn you. 
That's exactly what the two housemates did to the Coyotes in the first half Tuesday night at the Joyce Center. 
Ayers hit 7 -of-1 0 treys in the first hall', 9-of-14 for the game, on his way to scoring a career­high 35 points. 
"I just felt a little more relaxed more calm," Ayers said. "I just felt more relaxed, more calm. My teammates got me the ball and once I hit one shot, I just kept rolling ... I had a great feel, every time I fol­lowed through I knew it was going in."

lie scored arguably the biggest goal in Irish hockey history, but sophomore left wing Calle Hidderwall's Swedish accent and fashion sense is still the butt of con­stant jokes from linemate Kevin Dnnth. 
"I always impersonate his accent-I can't talk to him without talking in his aecent anymore, which is ridieulous," Deeth said with a laugh. "Ilis haircut and his style is so 'Euro', he just takes it to the next extent. lle'll wear the tightest jeans ever and these ultra-metro polos that you'd never, ever wear ... It's hilari­ous."

been informed of the decision to keep him as the coach and told to continue recruiting. Scout.com reported that Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick would make an announcement today regard­ing Weis' status. 
Neither Swarbrick nor Weis said anything official as of last night. Swarbrick said he and Weis would likely meet next Monday, when both he and Weis were back on cam­pus. 
Weis has a 28-21 record in four seasons as the Irish head coach. He took the team to two BCS bowls in his first two seasons, then lost a school­record 15 games in the next two. He is 4-10 against ranked opponents and his teams have lost to USC by a combined 76-3 in the past two seasons. A close call 
against Navy and a final­minute loss to Syracuse at home turned many students and alumni against him. 
His recruiting, however, remains impressive despite the records. Scout.com ranked the 2006 recruiting class as No. 5 in the country, 2007 as No. 11 and 2008 as No. 2. Two five-star recruits from the class of 2009, run­ning back Cierre Wood and offensive guard Chris Watt, have both given Notre Dame verbal commitments. 
Weis is in the third year of a H)-year contract that he signed midway through his first season.

In the absence of two key players, the Irish bench filled the gap. 
Freshmen Natalie Novosel and Erica Solomon scored 1 S and 12 points, respectively off the bench and No. 11 Notre Dame beat Eastern Michigan 83-63 on the road Tuesday. 
The Irish, who lost forward Devereaux Peters for the sea­son and missed guard Ashley Barlow in this game because of a concussion she suffered against Michigan State, need­ed production off the bench and got it. 
"Natalie was a huge lift off the bench for us, she really played well the whole game but gave us a great spark in the first half," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said.
