OIT power interruption disrupts services 
By EILEEN DUFFY Assistant News Editor 
At around 12:30 a.m. Tuesday morning, the data center of the Information Technology Center (lTC) experienced a power inter­ruption resulting in tempo­rary failure of critical data systems like Notre Dame Webmail, lnsideND and WebCT, said Assistant Vice President of the Office of Information Technologies Gordon Wishon. 
Normal power was restored at the lTC around 1:30 a.m., allowing OIT personnel to begin restoration of IT servic­es, said Director of Utilities Paul Kempf. By 8 a.m., oper­ation of approximately 90 percent of data systems had been restored, he said. However, some systems are still experiencing "intermit­tent slow-downs," Wishon said. 
The lTC did not lose "nor­mal power," Kempf said. 
Rather, the data center expe­rienced a loss of power because the equipment that transfers the system from its normal power source to a generator "had its brain fried." 
"It made an illogical deci­sion that wasn't based on reality," Kempf said. "It turned off the normal feed, but it didn't start the emer­gency feed." 
The lTC is equipped with surge protectors, which pre­vented the electronic equip­ment, like the computers themse1ves, from being dam­aged -but not the transfer­ring component, Wishon said. 
While the Utilities Department is still investigat­ing the cause of the equip­ment failure, lTC staff mem­bers working at the time reportedly witnessed a flash of lightning and immediately heard a clap of thunder, indi­cating a nearby lightning

Muslim students observe Ramadan 
Hesburgh speaks, eats at post-sunset dinner 
By ROHAN ANAND News Writer 
University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh spoke Monday night to several dozen non-Christian students on the campus of the nation's most prominent Catholic school. 
Emphasizing the similarities between the world's major monotheistic religions Christianity, Judaism and Islam -Hesburgh ended his talk by speaking directly to the 40 mem­bers of the Notre Dame Muslim Student Association (MSA) in attendance at the Coleman­Morse Center. 
"I hope that you can help our other [non-Muslim] students understand you," he said. "We have to respect each other's con­sciences, and we all want to fos­ter the spirit of peace in the world." 
This message carried the MSA into its annual Ramadan dinner that evening, held to celebrate Islam's month-long period of daytime fasting, which began Sept. 23. Sponsored by Campus Ministry, the students gathered to break the fast after sunset, joined by Hesburgh, Associate Vice President of Student Affairs William Kirk and Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs Jean Lenz.

Shirts sold to recognize soldiers 
ND senior active in TakePride company 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
War is a naturally cold affair, but Notre Dame senior Stephen Patton and the TakePride organi­zation are working to support American soldiers in a more per­sonal way. 
Since its launch last fall, Patton has been a partner in TakePride, a national organization founded by Patrick Gray and former Marine John Betts that sells T­shirts in recognition of Americans serving in the war. 
Unlike many organizations that raise awareness of war, TakePride does not view its activities as polit­ical statements. 
"Showing support and concern for the well-being of Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan is not a statement about politics but sim-

Finance class manages $3.7 million portfolio 
By MARCELA BERRIOS 
News Writer 
The next time the toilet over­flows in your residence hall and you wonder where the University's money is being spent, ask a couple of the fmance students in your section -they may have more access to the Notre Dame Endowment than you think. 
In fact, the "Applied Investment Management" (AIM) course gives senior finance stu­dents the opportunity to manage a stock portfolio worth 3.7 mil­lion dollars -grown from a piece of the University's Endowment -and establish working relationships with com­panies and investment firms along the way. 
Finance professor Frank Reilly teaches the course alongside resident professional analyst Jerry Langley and Notre Dame Vice President and Chief Investment Officer Scott Malpass -although the students also learn from the different lecturers and guest speakers that often visit the classroom. 
Alumni who have sat in the class themselves at one point during the course's 11-year run don't hesitate to come in and give students advice on their portfolio decisions -which may range from determining which

Speakers discuss African children 
By AARON STEINER News Writer 
International leaders and experts in the fight for justice in Africa spoke to the Africa Faith and Justice Network (AFJN) and members of the Notre Dame community Tuesday, as part the Network's annual two-day conference at the University. 
Archbishop John Baptist Odama of Gulu, Uganda was the keynote speaker Tuesday, along with three other distin­guished guests who addressed this year's conference theme: "Africa's Children: Peril and Promise." 
Today, each of the four speakers with the AFJN con­ference will present various workshops along with other Network members. 

AFJN is a national organiza­tion that was founded 25 years ago by Catholic missionaries who wished to advocate on the United States' policy toward Africa, according to Father Robert Dowd, Chair of the AFJN board. Dowd is also an assistant professor of political science at Notre Dame. 
Dowd said the focus of this year's conference, African children, is becoming especial­ly prevalent in the host of problems afflicting Africa. 
"Sub-Saharan Africa is the youngest region in our world," he said. "Forty to fifty percent of the population is below the age of 18, and a significant number are below the age of 10." 
Dowd also said there are a great number child-headed households in sub-Saharan

almost here. 
Despite midterm papers, exams, projects, presentations -and the list goes on -break is less than two weeks away, which I think is pretty refreshing. 
Break could include anything from going home to visiting friends to service trips, but the key term is this: break. 
One week of no classes, dining hall food or alarm clocks (I hope). Either way, it is something to look forward to, even though the next week-and-a-half may seem bleak. 
From reading all the Post-Its all over my desk, getting to Fall Break is going to be the hardest part, but it can be done. Those few extra hours of studying and sacrifice of sleep will pay off in the long run. I believe in you. 
I mean. it's nothing in comparison to finals, if that makes you feel any better. 
Stay on top of your work. Do your homework. Watch your deadlines. These concepts may be new to some, but for 10 days I'm sure you can put on your "thinking caps" and buckle down. 
I know that I am not a motivation­al speaker, but complaining about the impending workload isn't going to get it done now is it? 
Being from Philadelphia, my moti­vation to work hard is just getting home and eating a nice big hoagie from Wawa and relaxing. I am easy to please. 
Even if home (or wherever break may take you) may not be as relax­ing as I am making it sound, I'm sure it will be a change of pace from class -which is a plus. 
Unfortunately, since it is only mid-semester break, there might be a bit of homework to take care of before hitting the mall (or the couch). but that can probably be done on the trip home. I know I'll have things to keep me busy on the 11-hour car ride back east. 
Maybe you're not looking forward to break for various reasons. In that case, I hope you keep busy and you're back here before you know it. 
As for the rest of us, I wouldn't mind a night in my own bed, some home cooking and a shower without flip-flops. In fact, savor it. 
I hate to quote Disney because it is so cliche, but in the words of Dorie from Finding Nemo, "Just keep swimming." 
So wherever you end up on Fall Break, just remember that you worked hard and you deserve a lit­tle rest and relaxation. Enjoy.

Angry dog stage mothers sue L.A. agency 
LOS ANGELES -Stage mothers for a Hottweiler and other dogs have sued a com­pany called Hollywood Paws for failing to turn their pooches into stars. More than a dozen pet owners contend the company collected tens of thousands of dollars but never delivered on promises to get film and television auditions for their pets. 
"I lost a lot of money," said Rachel Armstrong, owner of Goliath the Hottweiler. 
Armstrong said she believed her dog had the "cool" factor that would get him into music videos and paid nearly $2,000 to Hollywood Paws LLC for training. 
All she got was a rejection from "The Tyra Banks Show." 
Attorney Cynthia Mulvihill filed the suit in Superior Court last month. 
"Who wouldn't want to be told, 'Hey your member of the family is beautiful and should be in the movies'?" she asked.

The ride, called the Ejection Seat, consists of a two-seat chair that is sus­pended from two towers by bungee cords.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Members discuss improving peer advocacy 
Council hopes students will use group's advice 
By KATHLEEN MCDONNELL 
News Writer 
Members of the Council of Representatives (COR) addressed the peer advocacy program as well as a new group created to brainstorm ways to help with the global health crisis during the group's meeting Tuesday night in LaFortune. 
Last year's Judicial Council pres­ident made strides toward reviving and reforming the Council's peer advocacy program, student body president Iizzi Shappell said. and this year's president Liz Kozlow asked COR for ideas on how to make the program more effective. 
Peer advocacy is one of two divi­sions of the Judicial Council that is "intended to help students facing the disciplinary process," Kozlow said. 
The students are "not lawyers exactly, for obvious reasons, but the peer advocates are the closest you'll get on this campus-for deal­ing with the Office of Residence Life and Housing (ORLH)," she added. 
The main objective of the peer advocacy program, which is cur­rently made up of 11 advocates, is to aid students through the ORLH's proceedings. Since 75 per­cent of ORU-1 cases are handled in personal meetings, and peer advo­cates are only allowed to sit in on hearings, the advocates' focus is often on preparing students for the disciplinary process, Kozlow said. 
"Our advice can be things like clearing out Facebook accounts and clearing pictures from the Internet," Kozlow said. 
Peer advocates also inform stu­dents of the typical procedure for disciplinary meetings. 
COR brainstormed ideas to increase student use of the pro­gram. Sophomore class vice presi­dent Bob Reich suggested having a peer advocacy representative from each dorm, as students may feel more comfortable if they have a personal connection with the advocate. 
The council members also con­templated using a new advertise­ment strategy. Last year's poster, "At odds with DuLac?" confused students who do not always asso­ciate DuLac violations with being sent to ORLH, according to Kozlow. 
COR also briefly discussed the ad-hoc student group that formed in the wake of the Global Health Crisis Academic Forum. Both Student Union Board president Pat Vassel and Shappell have attended meetings of the group of students who felt inspired by the forum. 
"There is this desire to do some­thing, but the group is not exactly sure what," Vassel said. 
Shappell said students will have the opportunity to be involved with the Millennium Fund Notre Dame participates in, but not for another semester, as faculty and adminis­trators are still formulating the project. The new group, however, is looking to act quickly. 
"People feel like they need to do something now," she said, "Let's not lose momentum." 
The group is still in formulation, and will continue to brainstorm in the upcoming weeks, Kozlow said.

New study exan1ines litigation in developing countries 
Effective court system costly but necessary 
By COURTNEY BALL News Writer 
Daniel Brinks, a Notre Dame graduate and professor at the University of Texas at Austin, spoke Tuesday about a large col­laborative initiative being direct­ed by the Kellogg Institute that focuses on individual rights to health care and education. 
Funded by the World Bank, Brinks' research project is enti­tled "Law and Rights in Developing Countries: The Impact of Legal Strategies on Social and Economic Rights," and aims to determine the role litigation should play in develop­ing countries. 
The comprehensive study focuses on the countries of Brazil, India, South America, Indonesia and Nigeria. 
American society is fond of liti­gation, suing over cases of spilled McDonalds coffee, and is accustomed to generally "getting what they sued for," Brinks said. However, he suggested the addi­tion of American-style courts might not be the positive step these developing countries require. 
"Litigation is an expensive, often elite-based activity ... It is a luxury," he said. 
Brinks said he fears at least initially successful litigation campaigns can be expected to exacerbate inequality in the dis­tribution of services. 
Preliminary analysis of the study data also suggests that the court system expends substan­tial resources for individual gains at the expense of other services, he said. Five percent of Brazil's annual budget is desig­nated to judicial procedures instead of being allocated toward health services or educa­tiona! improvements that would benefit all. 
Despite this, Brinks said he hopes to find that the increasing number of court cases demon­strate beneficial developments in the long term. He said high vol­umes of cases may trigger policy changes which could result in broader access to social and eco­nomic services over a span of time. 
Brinks said there still are sig­nificant barriers to the imple­mentation of an effective court system. It takes three days to even get to a courthouse in Indonesia, and in India, the gov­ernment fails to enforce favor­able rulings. 
Until the court systems can produce successful rulings, he said, they will remain under-uti­lized. 
"People are unwilling to waste scarce resources on an avenue which appears ineffective," Brinks said. 
For now, the study aims to determine if improved litigation procedures are a desirable out­come at all for these countries. Ideally, the conclusions of Brinks' study will ultimately pro­vide an answer, he said.

"This course has developed a certain reputation in Wall Street due to the success of the stu­dent's immersion into the world of corporate fmances and stock trading," Reilly said.

like mind over matter, and become stronger every year." 
During each day of fasting, Muslims are required to fast during the sunlight hours, and also are to abstain from smok­ing, sexual intercourse, lying, stealing, cheating or backstab­bing. 
"I think it's the best time of year, because you have nothing else to think or worry about," said sophomore Sohaib Hashmi. "It's just prayer and fast." 
After the prayer, the students gathered in the student lounge for a halal (an Islamic dietary requirement similar to kosher) Middle-Eastern dinner. 
During the meal, administra­tors invited those in attendance to share their sentiments about the MSA program at Notre Dame. 
Bpth students and faculty expressed gratitude for the existence of MSA on campus, many saying it serves as a very positive reinforcement in their faith life. 
"The average Muslim student can fit comfortably at Notre Dame because it's a religious institution and the school is very welcoming to different stu­dents of different cultures," Omar said. 
The students also said they appreciated the administrators' presence at the dinner and rec­ognized their support for the organization. 
"The administration and stu­dents have been so accepting of Muslims and Jews," said sec­ond-year MBA student Aziz Alikulov. "I am so moved by the spirit of this school." 
MSA secretary and second­year grad student Shawn Ahmed agreed. 
"As a Catholic college, Notre Dame has been more welcom­ing, more accepting, and more supportive of Muslim students than most secular colleges," Ahmed said. "It's not surprising that [Muslim students] love being here." 
The club is already planning an event for the final day of Ramadan, known as Eid, which will likely be a celebration at the local mosque in Michiana. 
Future plans entail religious presentations about Islamic cul­ture and prayer. Ahmed said he feels sharing his understanding of Islam is important, because the image of Muslims portrayed in the media is often foreign to him. 
"There are over one billion Muslims around the world and it is understandable, although regrettable, that the kind of Muslims people see in the media are the small minority of those who are fanatical and commit acts of terrorism," he said. "Islam is a religion of peace. It is just as hard for Muslims to make sense of such 
extremism  and  
violence  as  it  is  for  non­ 
Muslims."  
Grad  student  Hisham  
Soliman,  an  M.A.  in Peace  

Studies, said he thinks this greater understanding can also be achieved by implementing some changes in the Islamic academic programs at Notre Dame. 
"I hope there will someday be a department in Islamic Studies and the peaceful aspects of the religion will be shown," Soliman said. "Right now, only Islamic ethics are studied, but a revi­sion will express the entire reli­gion itself, and not just a single spectrum of it." 
Hesburgh agreed that there is a need to bring more Islamic scholars to Notre Dame to bring about such changes. For now, he said he is pleased that Muslim students are proud to be members of the Notre Dame community. 
"Muslims in America paint the true picture of Islam," Hesburgh said, "and I think that at a Catholic university, we're all praying to the same God, and we have a lot to learn from each other."

Rice warns against nuclear testing 
CAIRO, Egypt -Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Tuesday a North Korean nuclear test would be "a very provocative act," and she prodded Asian nations to rethink their relationships with the North Koreans. 
The top U.S. diplomat said the United States would have to assess its options should such a test be carried out, but she did not elaborate. 
"It would be a very provocative act by the North Koreans," Rice said during a press conference in Cairo, second stop on a Middle East tour. "They have not yet done it, but it would be a very provocative act." 
Rice's warning reflected widespread con­cern within the Bush administration. She stressed, however, that a North Korean test was an issue "for the entire neighborhood" and not just for the United States.

NEW YORK -Two Americans won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for measuring the old­est light in the heavens, a feat described as "one of the greatest discoveries of the century" that convinced skeptics of the big-bang theory of the universe's origin. 
George F. Smoot, 61, of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., and John 
C. Mather, 60, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., will share the $1.4 million prize equally for their groundbreaking work. 
They were the chief architects of a NASA satellite observatory named COBE, for cosmic background explorer. Launched in 1989, the spacecraft measured feeble remnants of light that originated early in the history of the uni­verse, about 380,000 years after the big bang.

Nursing home woman found in river 
MARION, Ind. -A wheelchair-bound woman drowned in the Mississinewa River and investi­gators questioned a former worker at the nurs­ing home where she lived about why he had taken her from the home. 
The body of Tonia Johnson, 41, was found Monday, the day after she was last seen at Bradner Village Health Care Center, police said. 
Grant County Coroner Ron Mowery said Tuesday that an autopsy confirmed that Johnson drowned. but that he would not have a final rul­ing on the death until the police investigation and further test results were completed. 

Gunman had history of abuse 
Roberts told wife during school siege that he molested 2 relatives 20 years ago 
Associated Press 
QUARRYVILLE, Pa. The gunman who killed five girls in an Amish schoolroom confided to his wife during the siege that he molested two relatives 20 years ago when he was a boy and was tormented hy dreams of doing it again, authorities said Tuesday. 
Investigators also said that Charles Carl Roberts IV, 32, plotted his takeover of the school for nearly a week and that the items he brought -including flexi­ble plastic ties, eyebolts and lubricating jelly ­suggest he may have been planning to sexually assault the Amish girls before police closed in. 
"It's very possible that he intended to victimize these children in many ways prior to executing them and killing himself," State Police Commissioner Jeffrey B. Miller said. But Roberts "became disorgan­ized when we arrived," and shot himself in the head. 
Holding up a copy of the gunman's suicide note at a packed news conference, Miller also suggested that Roberts was haunted by the death of his prema­turely born daughter in 1997. The baby, Elise, died 20 minutes after being delivered, Miller said. 
Elise's death "changed my life forever," the milk truck driver and father of three wrote to his wife. "I haven't been the same since it affected me in a way I never felt possible. I am filled with so much hate, hate toward myself hate towards God and unimaginable emptyness it seems like everytime we do something fun I think about how Elise wasn't here to share it with us and I go right back to anger." 
The state police commis­sioner identified the demons in Roberts' head a day after the shooting rampage shattered the sense of calm in Lancaster County's bucolic Pennsylvania Dutch Country, where the Amish live a peaceful, turn-the­other-cheek existence in an 18th-century world with no automobiles and no electrical appliances. 


"He certainly was very troubled psychologically deep down and was deal­ing with things that nobody else knew he was dealing with," Miller said. 
The death toll rose to six Tuesday -including the gunman -when two girls died of their wounds. 
During the standoff, Roberts told his wife in a cell phone call from the one-room schoolhouse that he molested two female relatives when they were 3 to 5 years old, Miller said. Roberts would have been around 11 or 12 at the time. Also, in a suicide note left for his family, he said he "had dreams about doing what he did 20 years ago again," Miller said. 
Police could not immedi­ately confirm Roberts' claim that he molested two relatives. Family members knew nothing of molesta­tion in his past, Miller said. Police located the two rela­tives and were hoping to interview them. 
Roberts had planned the attack for nearly a week, buying plastic ties from a hardware store on Sept. 26 and several other items less than an hour before entering the school, Miller said. 
The crime bore some resemblance to an attack on a high school in Bailey, Colo., where a 53-year-old man took six girls hostage and sexually assaulted them before fatally shoot­ing one girl and killing himself. That attack occurred last Wednesday, the day after Roberts began buying materials for his siege. 

Using a checklist that was later found in his pick­up truck, Roberts brought to the school three guns, a stun gun, two knives, a pile of wood for barricading the doors, and a bag with 600 rounds of ammunition, police said. He also had a change of clothing, indicat­ing he had planned a long siege, police said. 
He sent the boys and sev­eral adults away and bound the girls together in a line at the blackboard. Miller on Tuesday revealed that one of the girls was able to escape with the boys. 
ITALY 


Hijacker had message for pope 
Associated Press 

BRINDISI, Italy -A Turkish man hijacked a jetliner carrying 113 peo­ple from Albania to Istanbul on Tuesday and forced it to land in southern Italy, where he surrendered and released all the passengers unharmed, officials said. 
Two senior Turkish officials said the hijacker was seeking political asylum. An Italian security official said the hijacker had a message for the pope, but he said he did not know what it was. 
Candan Karlitekin, chairman of Turkish Airlines' board of directors, initially said the Boeing 737-400 had been hijacked by two Turks, and that they were protesting Pope Benedict XVI's planned visit to Turkey next month. 
Transport Minister Binali Yildirim told The Associated Press that the hijacker, whom he identified as Hakan Ekinci, was seeking to evade military service in his native Turkey. Istanbul Gov. Muammer Guier also said the hijacker was an army deserter who had fled to Albania. 
"It has nothing to do with the pope's visit; it was a simple attempt of seeking political asylum under the influence of psychological problems," Yildirim said. 
The passengers got off the plane about two hours after it landed in Brindisi, a town on southern Italy's Adriatic coast. The jet was on a darkened tarmac, with a fire truck carrying Brindisi airport's chief of security parked nearby.

households in sub-Saharan Africa due to parental deaths from HIVIAIDS and other dis­eases. 
"It's really a generation of great risk," Dowd said. 
He said the Network's annual conference is intended for edu­cation and advocacy. 
"Not only do we hope to raise awareness, but also to think about how we might affect poli­cy in a way that addresses their needs," he said. 
The panelists addressed both of these ideas yesterday, sharing their experiences and the meth­ods they have used in facing these issues. 
Sister Connie Gemme, a Missionary Sister of Our Lady of Africa, spoke specifically on the issue of human trafficking in Africa. 
'The overall view of the situa­tion is quite disturbing," Gemme said, referring to annual human trafficking rates, including both sex and labor trafficking. "Four million men, women and chil­dren are held against their will." 

These victims are isolated and exposed to rape, violence, HIV/AIDS and other diseases while being forced into prostitu­tion or involuntary servitude, she said. 
"It's like being in a bad dream, and hoping you'll wake up," Gemme said. "These women have to pay the price to wake up from it." 
Gemme said every year 50,000 people are moved to and from Africa and UNICEF esti­mates that 20,000 children are trafficked in western and cen­tral Africa alone, she continued. 
Vicki Simon, a member of the Maryknoll Lay Ministers, focused on another problem afflicting African youth -Street living and homelessness. 
According to Simon, there are over 250,000 street children in Kenya, where she has worked. 
"Their stories were often heartbreaking, and very simi­lar," Simon said. 
While working at the Ukweli Home of Hope in Nairobi, Simon said she was able to help many young men by helping them start their own businesses, and was consistently amazed at their outlooks on life. 
"Amidst the dismal face of these problems ... they can smile, sing and dance," she said. 
She concluded on a less posi­tive note, however, saying there is much work to be done. 
"Their health, education and development are in jeopardy," she said. 
Father Donald Dunson, anoth­er panelist and committed advo­cate and educator on children's rights, praised leaders like Gemme, Odama and Simon for their work, saying they "risk everything daily" to promote justice. 
Dunson also shared what he experienced while researching the conditions of African chil­dren, focusing on the problem of abduction of children. 
Keynote speaker Odama fur­ther discussed the issue of abduction and involuntary servitude in warfare. 
other solid state devices dam­aged," Kempf said. 
Such equipment is normally not replaced very often ­"about every four or five years," Kempf said. He admit­ted a product failure was pos­sible, but unlikely. 
"The presumption right now is some sort of electrical dis­turbance damaged that equip­ment," he said. 
Wishon said once his staff understood the cause of the failure, they would make plans to prevent future trip-
Northern Uganda, Odama said, has been the site of politi­cal unrest and warfare since 1986, with the start of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Odama said the constant fight for power between the groups has affected the entire region. 
"When two elephants fight, the grass suffers," Odama said, quoting an African proverb. 
According to Odama, the LRA has committed acts of violence against the citizens of Uganda, including "cutting off the lips of those who reported their move­ments, and cutting off the ears of those who didn't listen." In addition, child abduction has increasingly become a part of the LRA's tactics. 
"In places of armed conflict, children have become pawns for selfish games," Odama said. "It is estimated that 30 percent of the LRA is abducted children." 
Between 2002 and 2003, 10,000 child abductions took place during renewed efforts to exterminate the LRA, he said. 
Still, Odama said there is rea­son for hope. "God has done a miracle," he 
ups. 
"It has certainly been some length of time since we've suf­fered similar failure," Wishon said. "We have invested a sig­nificant amount of money in the past three years into the data center to ensure that we're able to maintain critical service operation in the face of possible failures like this." 
But if lightning indeed caused the equipment failure, he said it would be a hard thing to prepare for. 
"Of course, direct lightning said. "What was said impossi­ble -that the LRA and Ugandan government could not speak -is taking place right now." 

AFJN has, as ()dama said, "one less problem to worry about." However, there is still much work to be done. 
Some of that work may fall on groups like Notre Dame's own AFJN chapter. Established in 2005 under Dowd's guidance, the group was the first universi­ty chapter of its kind. 
According to senior Michael Rossmann, the president of Notre Dame's AFJN chapter, the group serves as both an aware­ness and advocacy group. Their primary project is Africa Week, which is held each spring and features discussions and other awareness events. 
In addition, the group's mem­bers practice advocacy in many ways, including traveling to Washington, D.C. and partici­pating in events such as a recent rally for Darfur.

strikes -if that's indeed what this is -while they're not 
unheard  of,  certainly  are

Kempf also  stressed  the  

unique meteorological circum­stances of the failure. 
"You can't prevent a light­ning strike," he said. " ... It may not be possible, despite all good intentions, to prevent equipment from failing in situ­ations like this."

strike, said Kempf-though they were unable to judge the proximity of the strike. 
"It seems plausible that [the failure] could have something to do with the lightning strike," Kempf said. 
The "fried" component has been removed and sent to its manufacturer, Eaton Electrical Inc. with whom the University does "a lot of busi­ness" -and a replacement is on the way, Kempf said. For now, the Data Center has been manually reconnected to the normal power source. 

Since the equipment per­formed properly during the weekend's power outage ­that is, it correctly transferred power from the non-working normal power to generator power -this particular fail­ure is perplexing.

IN BRIEF 
Court sides with newspaper union 
WASHINGTON -The Supreme Court sided Monday with Detroit newspaper unions and some employees who were fired for their actions during an 18-month strike in the mid­1990s. 
Justices declined to hear the newspapers' appeal of a National Labor Relations Board ruling ordering the partnership that prints, distributes and sells advertising for The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press to rein­state fired employees. 
The court's decision ended years of litigation over the firings. More than 100 workers, mostly involving newspaper production, were originally involved in the case, but most of them reached negotiated settlements from 2001 to 2003, said Lou Mleczko, president of The Newspaper Guild of Detroit, Local 34022. 
A Gannett Co. spokeswoman, Tara Connell, said settlements were being worked out with two former workers connected to the court's decision. She estimated it would result in "less than a couple hundred thousand dollars" in total financial impact for the company. 
U.K. online gambling shares plwnmet 
LONDON -Shares in British online gambling companies, including Sportingbet PLC and PartyGaming PLC, dived Monday after the U.S. Congress passed legislation prohibiting the use of credit cards, checks and electronic fund transfers for online gaming .. 
PartyGaming, the world's biggest online gam­bling company, said it would pull out of the United States if President Bush signs the legisla­tion into law. 
The company 888 Holdings PLC said it is sus­pending online betting operations in the United States as a result, and Sportingbet PLC said it called off takeover talks with World Gaming PLC. 
The legislation was part of a port securities bill passed by the House and Senate on Saturday. 
The companies hit hardest by the ruling are those that offer betting markets denominated in 
U.S. dollars, and usually operate from bases in the Caribbean or Central America. Most of the big British and Irish sites, by contrast, keep their operations in Europe and take deposits only off credit cards denominated in pounds and euros. 



Stock market smashes record 
Dow Jones industrial average surges to new closing high after oil prices plummet 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -The Dow Jones industrial average finally reached new heights Tuesday, .extending Wall Street's seven-year recovery with a record closing level after climbing into uncharted territory in trading earlier in the day. 
The index of 30 blue chip stocks ended the ses­sion at 11,727.34, wiping out the previous record of 11,722.98. 
Earlier, the Dow crossed its old trading high of 11,750.28, rising up to 11,758.95. Both of the previous records were set Jan. 14, 2000. 
While investors wel­comed the Dow's latest achievement. it comes at a time the stock market is more conservative, even more muted, than the Wall Street of early 2000.

FTC approves joint satellite deal 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday it has approved the joint venture between defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. to launch government satellites, removing a final barrier to the long­delayed proposal. 
While the commission concluded that the $1.06 billion partnership between the nation's two biggest defense firms could unfairly muscle out competitors, it said that concern was outweighed by the national security demands for a reliable and cheaper way to send military and other satellites into space. 
The so-called United Launch Alliance, or ULA, was proposed in May 2005 to resolve a long-standing dispute between Lockheed and Boeing, then the two major suppliers of rockets for government launches. 
It also came after Boeing was stripped of $1 billion in launch con­tracts and suspended for 20 months from launches by the Air Force after accusations that it used thousands of sensitive documents stolen from Lockheed to gain an edge in the bit­ter rivalry. Boeing later agreed to pay $615 million to end a Justice Department probe of the case. 
The FTC decision "brings the ULA closer to the goal of meeting the government's need for reliable, lower-cost launch services for national security, civil and scientific payloads," Boeing spokesman Dan Beck said. 
Lockheed spokesman Tom Jurkowsky, calling the decision good news, said the two companies still needed to complete reams of legal documents before the deal closes. 
ULA will be a 50-50 venture between the two companies, each providing a $530.7 million stake. It is planned for Denver and would combine launch services for Boeing's Delta and Lockheed's Atlas rockets, known as expendable launch vehicles. The venture is expected to save about $150 million annually.

Year's wildfires yield 
record costs, efforts 
U.S. Forest Service millions over budget 
Associated Press 
BOISE, Idaho -Wildfires across the country have burned a record number of acres this year, and with the scorched land comes a record bill, a federal official said Tuesday. 
The U.S. Forest Service's fire­fighting efforts for fiscal year 2006, which ended Sept. 30, cost more than $1.5 billion, at least $100 million over budget, said Mark Rey, the Agriculture Department undersecretary for natural resources and the envi­ronment. 
To pay for the fires, money was transferred from other pro­grams that had surpluses, including a reforestation pro­gram, said Kent Connaughton, the Forest Service comptroller. 
The wildfire season is not over yet, but so far more than 15,515 square miles, or 9.93 million acres, have burned in the Lower 48 states, Rey said. That is the most since at least 1960, when the Boise-based National Interagency Fire Center began keeping reliable records. 
The previous record was in 2005, when more than 8.6 mil­lion acres burned. The average of the past 10 years has been 4.9 million acres. 
The 2006 tab compares with $690 million spent in 2005 and $726 million in 2004, Forest Service spokesman Dan Jiron said. 
This year, for the first time, the Forest Service had a comptroller overseeing expenses, and fires that reached certain expense levels automatically triggered an independent review, Rey said. 

"We're getting better results in terms of cost, as a consequence of making cost efficiency and cost containment something that we spend a lot of time on," he said. "There's a three-way ten­sion: The safety of firefighters, protecting homes and property and not spending a gazillion dol­lars. I think we've made some strides." 
This fire season was exacer­bated by seven large-scale dry lightning storms, more than double the normal number, Rey said. Such storms can ignite sev­eral thousand small fires, forc­ing crews to scramble to make sure all are extinguished. 
So far this year, 674 homes­primary residences, not vacation houses -have burned in wild­fires, Rey said. That's a drop from 2002, when roughly 2,000 homes burned, and 2003, when about 3,000 burned. 
That indicates property own­ers and federal and state entities are making progress in reducing fuels around homes and devel­oping wildland protection plans, he said. 
President Bush said Tuesday that Congress needs to pass fur­ther laws that will provide ways to restore forests once they've been burned and commended the Forest Service for their oper­ational planning. 
"I really want to thank the brave firefighters who risk their lives on a daily basis to contain the fires," said Bush, who was in Los Angeles, where a giant wild­fire about 50 miles northwest of the city was extinguished Monday, nearly a month after it began. 

Judge allows ACLU to debate Patriot Act 
Muslim groups want part of law repealed 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -Nearly three years after hearing arguments in the case, a federal judge has ruled that an American Civil Liberties Union challenge to the constitutionality of the USA Patriot Act may proceed. 
The ACLU's clients, including Muslim charities, social servic­es organizations and advocacy groups, have shown they have been harmed by the anti-ter­rorism law adopted after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. District Judge Denise Page Hood said in a 15­page ruling issued Friday. 
The lawsuit was filed in July 2003 on behalf of the Muslim Community Association of Ann Arbor and five other nonprofit groups. The ACLU said its clients had been hurt by the Patriot Act because fear of the law has kept many people from attending religious serv­ices and making charitable donations. 
It was the first legal chal­lenge to the part of the Patriot Act that let agents obtain such things as library lists and med­ical information. 
The ACLU contended Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which allows the FBI access to any "tangible things" such as books and documents through an order from a secret court, does not require investigators to show probable cause. 

The group wants the judge to declare Section 215 unconsti­tutional, and block the Justice Department from using that part of the Patriot Act. 
Hood's ruling had been awaited since a Dec. 3, 2003, hearing at which the govern­ment argued the lawsuit should be dismissed. Federal officials later argued that amendments approved by Congress in March 2006 had corrected any constitutional flaws in the Patriot Act. Hood's ruling gave the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their initial complaint in light of those amendments. 
Kary Moss, Michigan direc­tor of the ACLU, told the Detroit Free Press she would consult with her clients before deciding whether to proceed with the lawsuit. 
The government had argued the law does not violate the Fourth Amendment because the protections against unrea­sonable search and seizure do not apply to information or items that have been given to third parties, even if there is an understanding of confiden­tiality. 
Mia111i Herald publisher resigns 
Diaz steps down after mishandling the firing of three journalists 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -The Miami Herald's publisher resigned Tuesday, say­ing "ambiguously communicat­ed" personnel policies resulted in the firings of three journalists at its Spanish-language paper who were paid to appear on U.S.-gov­ernment broadcasts aimed at promoting democracy in Cuba. 
Jesus Diaz Jr., the papers' pub­lisher since July 2005, had dis­missed two El Nuevo llerald reporters and a freelance con­tributor who had been paid by Radio Marti and TV Marti. Diaz said the company offered to rehire the three and would not discipline six others it recently discovered also took payments. 
"I realize and regret that the events of the past three weeks have created an environment that no longer allows me to lead our newspapers in a manner most beneficial for our newspa­pers, our readers and our com­munity," Diaz, who also resigned as president of the Miami I lerald Media Co., wrote in a letter to readers. 
David Landsberg, a longtime Herald employee who served as general manager, took over immediately as company presi­dent and publisher of the two newspapers, said The McClatchy Co., the papers' parent company. McClatchy acquired the newspa­pers in June when it bought Knight Hidder Inc. 
"No company enjoys publicly reversing a decision it made, but the sign of a really good and honorable company is one that can reflect on its actions, consid­er additional data and some­times come to a new conclusion, and that's exactly what we did," Landsberg told The Associated Press. 

Gary Pruitt, McClatchy presi­dent and CEO, said in a state­ment that the company was sorry to see Diaz leave but "we couldn't be happier about having such a talented and experienced leader perfectly poised to step into this important job." 
McClatchy spokeswoman Elaine Lintecum declined to com­ment beyond the company's statement. 
Diaz said he believed the jour­nalists' acceptance of payments "was a breach of widely accepted principles of journalistic ethics." But he added "our policies pro­hibiting such behavior may have been ambiguously communicat­ed, inconsistently applied and widely misunderstood over many years in the El Nuevo Herald newsroom." 
He said no one would be allowed in the future to accept money from the U.S. govern­ment-run broadcasters, and con­flict-of-interest policies would be strengthened. 
Landsberg acknowledged there's some tension in the news­rooms, but added: "At the end of the day, I think everyone agrees that working for money for TV and Radio Marti when you're an independent journalist is not the right thing to do." 
The Miami Herald reported early last month, citing govern­ment documents, that 10 South Florida journalists had received thousands of dollars from the federal government for their work on radio and TV program­ming aimed at undermining Fidel Castro's communist regime. 
Pablo Alfonso, who reports on Cuba and wrote an opinion col­umn for El Nuevo Herald, was paid almost $175,000 since 2001 to host shows on Radio and TV Marti, U.S. government pro­grams that promote democracy in Cuba, according to govern­ment documents obtained by the Herald.

Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and surrounding waters, an archipelago 1,400 miles long and 100 miles wide in the Pacific Ocean. 
His position on high-seas fish­ing represents a last-minute shift going into an election, in part due to mounting pressure from the conservation groups, key Republican senators such as Ted Stevens of Alaska, Richard Lugar of Indiana and John Warner of Virginia, and 
U.S. allies such as Britain, Norway, Australia and New Zealand. 
A State Department document prepared in recent months for the eyes of foreign diplomats only had suggested that nations impose a ban on bottom trawl­ing by 2009 -but provided an easy out for any nation whose fleets want to continue using the gear. 
The U.S. negotiating "non­paper," a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, unofficially proposed a ban on bottom trawling unless any nation "determines that its continuation in an area would not cause significant adverse harm." 
The high seas -which 

extend beyond nations' 200­mile offshore exclusive econom­ic zones -cover nearly two­thirds of the planet, yet only about 25 percent of it is subject to international treaties. 
Stevens and Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, tried to get the Senate to toughen up the 
U.S. stance, 

anywhere it's unregulated. While Brazil, Chile, Germany, the Netherlands, South Africa and, now, the U.S. have expressed support for regulat­ing bottom trawling on the high seas, Spain, Russia and Iceland are among those that oppose it. 
The U.S. allows but regulates bottom fishing in U.S. waters. The practice involves boats dragging huge nets along the sea floor scooping up orange roughy, blue ling and other fish while bulldozing nearly every­thing else in their path. 
"It's like clear-cutting the for­est to catch a squirrel," said Joshua Reichert, head of the private Pew Charitable Trusts' environment program, which has been leading an interna­tional coalition of more than 60 conservation groups against the 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Bush called for a halt to destructive fishing on the high seas Tuesday and said the United States will work to elimi­nate or better regulate prac­tices such as bottom trawling that devastate fish populations and the ocean floor. 
Bush directed the State and Commerce departments to pro­mote "sustainable" fisheries and to oppose any fishing prac­tices that destroy the long-term natural productivity of fish stocks or habitats such as seamounts, corals and sponge fields for short-term gain. 
He said the U.S. would work with other nations and interna­tional groups to change fishing practices and create interna­tional fishery regulatory groups if needed. 
The memo was issued a day before United Nations negotia­tions open in New York on an effort to ban bottom fishing 
practice. 
"The  White  
House  ...  has  
once  again  
come  out  

strongly in sup­port of ocean conservation, proving that there is biparti­san support for ending the destruction of the worlds oceans, Reichert said. 
Bush created a national monument in June to protect t h e

"The United Nations must put an end to unregulated fishing practices on the high seas and call on nations to stop their ves­sels from conducting illegal, unreported, and unregulated high-seas bottom trawling, until measures to regulate this prac­tice are adopted," Stevens said Tuesday. 
Reichert and groups such as Greenpeace, Conservation International and the Natural Resources Defense Council have waged a two-year global cam­paign costing an estimated $5 million lobbying for action by the U.N. this fall. 
"We're not saying no bottom trawling ever. We're saying unregulated bottom trawling ought not to occur," said Lisa Speer, a New York-based senior policy analyst at NRDC. 
The National Academy of Sciences said in a 2002 report that bottom trawling can wipe creatures and seafloor habitats, particularly gravelly, muddy spots. 
"Many experimental studies have documented the acute, gear-specific effects of trawling and dredging on various types of habitat," it said. 
The report recommended doing less such fishing, chang­ing the gear and closing off some areas to fishing. 
the fishing industry fears a "potential spillover effect" of any high-seas ban into U.S. waters, said Stacey Viera, a spokeswoman for the National Fisheries Institute, representing the $29 billion-a-year seafood industry. 
"If we call bottom trawling an activity that should not be done in the high seas, then why would it be done anywhere else? That's the concern here," she said. "Don't demonize one type of fishing gear." 
Viera said the industry would support limited closures in places where the United States worked closely with other nations to identify sensitive marine ecosystems. 
That would be impossible, said marine biologist Sylvia Earle, who recently helped per­suade Bush to protect the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Earle, an explorer-in­residence at the National Geographic Society, said bottom trawling is unquestionably destructive, like "bulldozers that go in the sea."

I love this time of year. The leaves change, the weather cools down and political commercials heat up. With elections just around the corner, the American people will decide which can­didate deserves his or her vote, and both parties are doing their best to snag the most voters. And this year, for the Republicans, desper­ate times call for des­perate measures. As a result, Americans are left in the dark about key issues as our nation continues A Word to the on a downward spiral Wzse to disaster. 
The United States has soldiers dying everyday in Iraq and all some candidates can talk about is gay marriage, abortion and flag burn­ing. While these issues are important, they affect only a small number of peo­ple in our country. The war in Iraq, however, is affecting not only the United States, but also the whole world. Yet the Republicans are not talking about it. As the New York Times edito­rial board explained this last Sunday, "Politicians running for election want to deliver good news, and there is noth­ing about Iraq-including withdrawal scenarios-that is anything but omi­nous". Controversial issues, such as gay marriage and abortion, are merely a ploy by conservatives to capture the conservative to moderate vote on life, moral and religious issues, and to make people temporarily forget about the war. I am sure thousands of people voted for President Bush in the last two presidential races because of his plat­form on abortion and being Pro-Life. Yet after four years of Republicans con­trolling the House, Senate, and the presidency, abortion has yet to be banned. These one-issue voters need to think twice about what being Pro-Life means before they vote. Countless American soldiers and Iraqi civilians are losing their lives everyday in an unjust war; a war the government chose to start. lED's (Improvised Explosive Devices), one of the main weapons used in this war, stop a beat­ing heart just like abortion. This sounds to me like a Pro-Choice administration; someone else choosing the life worth of a human being. 


For a long time we all fell for the politicians' tricks, focusing onour faith and morals rather than on our country and well-being. Some citizens often felt shamed and damned by their respec­tive religions if they did not conform to religious teaching on political matters. But now, thankfully, we are all begin­ning to ask questions. The supposed "War on Terror" is becoming a main focal point, as it should, in this upcom­ing election, and it is time for our ques­tions to be answered. 
While we now know the reason for which we entered the war was wrong (WMD's anyone?), questions are now surrounding the current Iraqi condi­tions and the President's war evacua­tion plan. As the New York Times explained, "Growing violence, not growing democracy, is the dominant feature of Iraqi life. Every Iraqi knows this. Americans need to know it too." The U.S. government entered the war without the approval of the United Nations, trying to control the Iraqi gov­ernment, and supposedly entered due to "national security" issues. But what does the government do now? Conditions are horrendous in Iraq, civilians and U.S. soldiers are dying everyday, and as Heathrow Airport will tell you, the world is still affected by terrorists. The Bush Administration should not question one's patriotism if he or she questions the war, saying that we all need to support our troops. I support the troops strongly enough to not want to waste their lives by pro­crastinating with an evacuation plan. It seems the Bush administration was not supporting the troops by sending them abroad without a clear exit strategy. Our national security now seems to be at an even higher risk since we have begun this "War on Terror." Lives are in danger at home and abroad. However, if the government could get its act together, start answering ques­tions and admitting their mistakes, my American pride and sense of safety, and that of many others, could be restored. 
The window of opportunity to leave Iraq in a somewhat civil manner is rap­idly closing. An exit plan needs to be produced and the American people need to be told the truth; the truth about 9/11, the non-existent WMD's and the current Iraqi situation. The sooner this happens, the sooner our country becomes more secure and our allies strengthened. Americans need to turn off Rush and read Washington Post editor Bob Woodward's new book. I've watched "All the President's Men", where Woodward uncovered the lies and deceptions of the Nixon Administration. And now we are seeing history repeat itself. Bob Woodward is once again revealing scandals, this time about 9/11 and the Iraq war. This elec­tion, instead of voting strictly for reli­gious or selfish reasons, the American voter needs to vote for the candidate or party that will strive to look out for the well-being of all Americans, as well as the world in which we interact.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


U-WIRE 
46 million-or-so, who cares? 
It is a big deal. People's lives are a very big deal. For about 46 million uninsured Americans, it's a huge deal. 
Warning: I begin by commenting that 
this topic is so broad and detailed I only cover a few Christopher facets. Taylor 
I have had the opportunity to work 
Daily Kent 

with a number of 
Stater

patients in the hos­pital setting who are uninsured, and also poor and unem­ployed. Of course, many Republicans jump to the conclusion that they 
choose to live off welfare or Social Security checks and are lazy, even though they might be 80 years old or 
missing a leg. 
These patients do not have any form of health insurance, making adequate treatment and regular check-ups something unaffordable. Even in emer­gency settings, patients are sometimes more concerned with how they will afford their bills and less about their healing process. 
Make no mistake, the United States already extends partial benefits to sup­port health care for less fortunate peo­ple. This comes at the expense of the taxpayers and to the objection of igno­rant people who seem to think getting rid of Medicare or other government grants toward health care will save them a few bucks. The government pays for roughly 60 percent of all spending on health care already. 
But if we stop thinking like the aver­age, selfish American, we begin to understand the unmistakably human element concerning the protection of our fellow citizens. It is our moral obli­gation to help those in need. 
I am not endorsing the idea of having nationalized health care until I am absolutely sure that it will be effective in the United States. But in theory, I think it would work pretty well. 
Several smaller European countries have already adopted the system and seem to function well. In fact, these developed nations are posting better infant survival rates and higher life expectancy for their citizens. We must be concerned about not only acquiring quality health care, but also insist that health care is affordable and available to all people. 
People who voice concerns about nationalized health care are usually afraid that the bureaucracy would expand to become even larger and that their right to control their own care will be in the hands of the government. Unfortunately, the government already has expanded through the worthless Office of Homeland Security while Bush listens to our calls to grandma. 
We must remember, as congressman Jim McDermott said in 2004, "National health care does not mean government medicine." It does mean that nearly all people will be insured. There would be no more rising premiums based on a competitive private industry. There would be a mass reduction in the num­ber of people filing bankruptcy due to medical debt. And people would be assured that their insurance would not be stripped away because of a pre­existing condition. Also, people who already have health insurance would not be turned away from a facility because their insurance company is not accepted. 
So, instead we stick with our current system of stuffing money down the throats of the slimeball insurance com­panies who don't give a rat's ass about anybody, while causing more employ­ers to pile the costs on their employ­ees. 
I'm not expecting people to cooperate with the "European" way of doing health care when we can't even switch to the metric system.

Connecting with Brazil 
What do you think of when someone mentions Brazil? Pele, the rainforest, and Carnaval cos­tumes? Stereotypes inevitably result from sporadic U.S. media attention and relatively less cover­age than that of other regions of the world, namely the Middle East. 
Daily, as I respond to phone calls and constituent mail in the Cultural and Public Affairs sector of the Brazilian Embassy, I realize that many Americans want to know more about Brazil than just World Cup players, palm trees, and swimsuits. Enjoy the events of this week -Brazil Week -as springboards into an expanded understanding of our important neighbor to the south. 
As the global energy crisis grows more severe, more Americans rec­ognize Brazil as a potentially great source of alternative fuel. However, Brazil and the U.S. are more than just trade partners. The historical cultural bonds between the two nations are strong. Few people realize that in the past cen­tury, Brazilian artists influenced classical music and opera in the United States. Likewise, Brazilians transformed American jazz and rock and roll into unique expres­sions. 
Because cultural exchange is a critical aspect of expanding fel­lowship between nations, I encour1J,ge you to increase your awareness of Brazil by attending Brazil Week events. Participating in such cultural events by savoring unique Brazilian cultural differ­ences will not only enrich your Notre Dame experience, but also will enhance international rela­tions at a grassroots level.

I am writing to thank Ms. Gragg, for her Oct. 3 letter in response to my opinion ("Walk the walk?", Oct. 2) I did not say Notre Dame was losing its morals, I just asked the question. Her response clearly affirms my concerns and gives me just cause to further clarify my opin­ion. 
First, I never stated that Notre Dame was in any way responsible for these commercials. However, the fact that there was no objection, or hint thereof, from our university to ABC I do find disappointing. 
Second, the fact that many folks, did not even "see" or "recognize" these repeated com­mercials is of concern to me. Are we numb to these images/suggestions? As to the points related to watching this show: Electing to watch this show is entirely different than its message being thrown at unsuspecting folks via repeated commercials. The suggestion that we should just hide our eyes and our children's eyes to watch Notre Dame football-is pre­posterous. Turning away and avoiding the evils in our society is exactly the apathy that I refer to. We, as Catholics, do not need to "just toler­ate this and stop whining." On the contrary, we should voice our opinion and work to change the society in which we live. 
These types of ads have no place in prime­time family television or anywhere near Notre Dame football. Finally, to deny the impact of television programming on our society is as naive as not understanding the dangers of sec­ond hand smoke, violent video games or the like. Media attacks on marriage, fidelity, etc. are hurting our society and should not be accepted. Using Notre Dame football, to "reach their audience" and promote this message in my humble opinion is flat out wrong. We are ND, and this is why we have a responsibility not only to volunteer in worthwhile causes, but walk with our faith in everything we do. I would encourage you to not give up and don't accept these attacks, we can change the socie­ty within which we live. Next Sunday, say a rosary before Mass with your friends. This act will be much better preparation for Mass.

SEASON Two DVD REVIEW 
By LAURA MILLER 
Scene Writer 
After its quiet entrance to ABC in March 2005, "Grey's Anatomy" had an unexpect­ed -but well-deserved boom during its second season. At tho beginning of the first year, "Grey's" looked to be nothing more than perhaps an adequate substi­tute for the "ER" post-glory age. It was "that show" after "Desperate Housewives," but by the end of the sea­son, more people tuned in. This influx of viewers was enough to encourage pro­ducers to order a second, full season, which gathered its own following and picked up steam. 
Season 2 is easily more focused on the dramatic aspect of its plot than Season 1. The interaction between the doctors and their patients becomes the focus, rather than the more nitty-gritty aspects of working in an on. 'fhis is not to say the 
Greys Anatomy Season Two 
Buena Vista Home Entertainment 
show is no longer medical but unlike other shows, the patients do not take cen­terstage. The patients are important in their interaction with the doctors -they reveal truths about the characters, move the plot forward and help the show com­municate its messages about the chal­lenges of life and love. 
Frequently accused of being a prime­time soap opera, "Grey's" is much more, mo!)tly tlJ.anks to the quality of acting. The cast of "Grey's" might experience some out·of~the-ordma.ry drama. but their act­ing is far from shoddy. Each actor shows a diversity of character -able to exhibit wit; anger and sadness in relatable and realistic proportions. Unlike soap operas, the cast is more static. Aside from the patients, who movein and out of the hos-pita!, the doctors do not have "high turnover." 

There are, however, some new faces in Season 2. Addison Shepherd (Kate Walsh), the surprise wife of surgeon Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), con­tinues to appear in the second season. Her stern demeanor and uncomfortable chilliness bring a unique dimension to the cast of characters. Also new to the cast is Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), a resident who has a fling with George O'Malley 
(T.R. Knight). At first she seems awkward, but as the season progresses, she proves an excellent and vibrant addition. 
New characters were not the only change made during the break between seasons. The show also makes slight sty­listic changes. Most notable is the Joss of the "self-contained episode." Rather than the patients chan~:,>ing with each episode, the sereenwriters begin to .have overlap within the episodes. The most notable evi­dence of this is Denny (Jeffrey Dean 
Morgan), a patient waiting for a heart transplant who becomes involved with ­and engaged to-surgi­cal intern lzzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl). 
Despite this change, the show starts in the same manner as the first season -as a narrative of Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). Although simi­lar to the format of the openings of "Desperate Housewives" and "Sex 

and the City," Pompeo gives a good tone to the show and help organize and direct the audience before launching into the stories' many intertwining plot lines. 
The show is also becoming a popular venue for hit singles and allows artists previously not well known to expand their index of hits -The Fray and Snow Patrol are excellent examples. The show expands itself to accommodate music videos in which clips from the show are put to one of the hit singles -a brilliant marketing strategy to be sure. 
With the first two seasons now avail­able on DVD and the fiery start of Season, 3 last month, "Grey's Anatomy" has quickly become a primetime TV staple.

MEDICAL DRAMAS FEATURE 
By MARTY SCHROEDER 
Assistant Scene Editor 
If the pun of a title didn't give it awa: 
the Emmy-award winning "Grey' 
Anatomy" is not the first medical sho' 
to captivate television audiences with 
surgically constructed combination 1 
science, drama and humor. 
"Grey's Anatomy" began in 2005 an 
has exploded on the TV scene. While tb 
first season was an exploration of tq 
medical part of the hospital, the secoJ· 
and now third seasons have brought 
sexual tension, Florence Nightinga 
effects and more Emmy's than AB 
knows what to do with. 
While this show has brought som 
new television story-telling techniquej 
it is a little brother to the previous mei 
ical dramas, the greatest of those beiii 
"ER" but also including "House, M.D 
and "Scrubs." 
"ER" first aired in 1994 as a creatio 
of novelist Michael Crichton (an M.l 
himself). Starring George Clooney an 
Julianna Margulies as Dr. Doug 
and Nurse Carol Hathaway, re!lPlCtJlVe 
this show was able to take the range 
drama from relationships to the oper 
ing room and meld them together in 
not only a coherent story, but also 
vastly entertaining and engraini 
series. 
This show is also interesting 

every original cast member has 
left the show to move on in his or 
acting careers. Popular actor No 
Wyle, who portrayed Dr. John

thing of an achievement for a show

characters and phase out old ones

"ER" will be entering its 14th season 
2007-2008.

added every season. The cast began with only eight characters and then grew to 10 for Season 2 and now includes 12 in the current third season. As the show becomes more complicated and the characters' relationships grow, it's only natural that more characters be added to the mix of the show to interact with and change the relationships of the existing characters. 
It will be interesting to see if "Grey's Anatomy" will have the longevity of "ER." The NBC show owes its existence to the serious tone of its program. The drama in the show, whether medical ­with lives at stake, or relationship-cen­tered -with hearts at stake, appeals to young adults to middle-agers to baby­boomers. "Grey's Anatomy" does not have that same high-class production value or as serious a cast to accompany it. Time will tell how long "Grey's Anatomy" will remain on the air, but for now it is riding the wave along with another medical television series that breaks all the rules concerned with ensemble television. 
"House, M.D.," also in its third season, is a character-driven drama, which focuses more on the medicine and dis­eases than the relationships between characters. This is not to say that no drama exists. 
House tears into his interns, who then tear into themselves and, in the end, always seem to be able to find a solution for the problems of their patients. The stodgy House tempers his rapier wit with a vast knowledge of medicine that makes viewers become repulsed and interested in the character at the same time. 
The number of medically themed shows on television makes it one of the most popular genres -with at least three on the air right now. However. the television powers that be were able to find variations to make a mix of emo;;: tions and dramatic instances. 
"ER" may have been the forbearer,bpt the torch is now in the hands of a hewer breed of shows with star power,l(}v~ and characters just trying to get bY: With stress-filled jobs and stress..fillecl: :tela~ tionships.

"GREY'S ANATOMY" FEATURE 
By ANALISE LIPARI Assistant Scene Editor 
At the close of the highly watched sec­ond season of ABC's popular medical drama "Grey's Anatomy," audiences were left with a series of maddening clifThang­ers. The show's protagonist, aspiring sur­geon Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), had just slept with Dr. McDreamy himself, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), put­ting both her new relationship with cute veterinarian Finn (Chris O'Donnell) and Derek's fragile marriage to fellow surgeon Addison (Kate Walsh) at risk. 
Her fellow surgical interns were no less engrossed in complicated storylines. Amidst the drama of the hospital prom, Izzie (Katherine Heigl) lost her beloved patient and fiance Denny (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) to heart failure, and left Seattle Grace shortly thereafter. Dr. Karev redeemed his womanizing ways some­what as he attempted to comfort the grieving Izzie. At this point, their roman­tic future remains speculation. 
The fledgling romance between Drs. Burke and Yang (Isaiah Washington and Sandra Oh respectively) was also on shaky ground after Burke suffered a potentially debilitating injury to his spinal chord. Lastly, sweet and lovable George 
(T. R. Knight) was left unable to say, "I love you," having heard his new girlfriend Callie (Sara Ramirez) utter those three fateful words earlier in the season. 
The highly anticipated third season of "Grey's" began airing two weeks ago at its new time, Thursdays at 9 p.m. So far, it has fared well in the ratings race against CBS's No. 1 show, "C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation," the former ratings power­house of that time slot. 
"The move of "Grey's" to Thursday defi· nitely changed the dynamics for us," said Jeff Bader, head of scheduling at ABC, in a recent Associated Press article. 
As the complicated storylines continue to develop, they and the drama of "Grey's" must keep working to maintairt and expand that strong viewership. After two weeks, the surgeons of Seattle Grac$ .. h<1,ve embroiled themselves in further. drama, resolving some storylines while fleshing out others. In particular, the love triangle between Meredith, Finn and Derek has become a regular: character struggle, with Meredith resolving to date both men. Considering her luck with men in the show's previous seasons, one can only speculate as to how thi$. stpryline may resolve itself. 

Izzie, having taken to sitting Shiva and maniacally baking in grief over Denny's death, closed last week's episode having reconciled with her supervisor, Dr. Bailey (Chandra Wilson), and standingtentative­ly outside of Seattle Grace's double doors. Her return to the hospital seems likely, but dealing with the consequences of both the loss of Denny and her actions prior to his death will be a difficult task for the show's writers. 
One interesting addition to the cast is Dr. McSteamy, or pr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the man wbilse affair with Addison ruined the Shepherds' marriage for good. Dr. Sloan has only briefly appeared in previous episodes. However, a recent renewal of his contract for several subse­quent episot;fes implies that McSteamy is, in fact, here to stay in Seattle. His pres­ence on the show should impact plotlines on "Grey's" this fall. 
"Sloal}, of course, was the reason Derek moved to Seattle in the first place, when his fortner best friend slept with his wife," said a,recent Zap2it.com article. 
"His ongoing presence will either set up two interlocking love triangles (Meredith­Finn-Derek and Derek-Addison-Sloan) or one big love pentagon," the article said. 
In the past, the strength of "Grey's Anatomy" was its constant emphasis on compelling writing and storytelling. While each medical story featured in a weekly episode may seem over the top on occa­sion, the characters involved -both staff and patients -seem realistic, as though they've been in our living rooms for years rather than only two seasons. 
Season 3 began on a slightly weaker note than previous years, with Izzie, an audience favorite, spending the entire episode laying on the floor in her dejected prQm dress. Meredith's recent decision regarding Derek and Finn seems more like a plot device to ensure continuous drama than the move that a realistic WOtnan might make.

MOVIE REVIEW 

Korean film gives insight into life of a soldier 
By ERIN MCGINN Assistant Scene Ediror 
Compulsory army service would be ter­ribly hard to apply in America today. In Korea, however, with the constant threat of North Korea across the border -it's a way of life. Every male in South Korea must spend 24-28 months serving in the army sometime between the ages of 20 and 30. 
Director Jong-Bin Yoon depicts this way of life and the effects of the compulsory military service in his film "The Unforgiven." 
The film revolves around Lee Seung­yeong (Seo Jang-weon), a Korean citizen who joins the army for 26 months of mandatory service after spending time in college. He constant­
core of the movie, are flashback scenes. The present time is a year or so later when Seung-yeong is on his leave and goes to visit Tae-jeong. Seung-yeong per­sistently tries to have a serious conversa­tion with Tae-jeong, who is instead more interested in entertaining his girlfriend, Ji­hae (Sung-mi Kim). The movie then cuts between Seung-yeong's experiences in the military and his attempts to reconnect with Tae-jeong in the present. 
"The Unforgiven" was created by direc­tor Jong-Bin Yoon as his fmal student film before graduation from film school in South Korea. He created the movie as a reflection upon the experiences he encountered while completing his compul­sory military service. Admittedly, the movie is more toned down than Yoon ini­tially intended since he needed approval

DVD REVIEW 
Key issues raised in 'Thank You for Smoking' 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Ediror 

Propaganda -a buzzword with highly negative connotations denoting something meant to elicit a response without the viewer thinking hardly at all. 
Few issues could be brought up that deal more with propaganda than smoking. The ubiquitous ad campaigns on television warning of the dangers of smoking and the evil empire of smoking companies are legion and offer very little on the other side of the coin. Smoking is dirty, unhealthy and tobacco companies do nothing but deceive trying to make a quick buck. 
Enter "Thank You For Smoking." Hevolving around the life of Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), a lobbyist working for Academy of Tobacco who studies the fic­tional parody of the actual Tobacco Institute, this fllm explores the side of the tobacco industry the Stand and Truth campaigns don't talk about -what goes into selling cigarettes. 
The dull nature of this film, exploring the tobacco industry and the journey of Naylor through the film, serves it well.

Thank You for Smoking his son that all those people who say ciga­Widescreen Edition rettes are bad are only giving half the story cre­ates a very nice, albeit 20th Century Fox toned down melodrama within which to frame the bigger issues the movie wants to tackle. The romantic connection between Naylor and 
yeong, and played by director Jong-Bin Yoon himself. Based on someone he met while serving in the army, Yoon decided it would be easier for him to play the role himself, rather than try to con-vey the mannerisms for someone else to portray. The decision served him well, and Ji-hoon is a well-liked character. 
One issue that has arisen in Western showings of "The Unforgiven," is the dif­ference of culture between South Korea and Western countries. In discussing the fllm, Western audiences have brought up scenes where homosexuality is implied. 
Yoon himself addressed this while speak­ing at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center Monday, stating that the interac­tion is simply a difference of culture and nothing more -something implicitly obvi­ous to Korean viewers. 
Since its debut in 2005, "The Unforgiven" has held a run in South Korean theatres, been presented at the Cannes film festival and is currently on a university tour through the United States. 
Contact Erin McGinn at emcginn@nd.edu 
Naylor's son, whom he is trying to raise well while working for a so-called evil industry, raises many pertinent questions not only for his father but for the audi­ence. Are tobacco companies evil or are they merely selling a product people are free to buy or not buy at their choosing? 
The film explores this in the context of a supposed new label on cigarette packages which will include a skull and crossbones indicating their unhealthy nature. The companies send Naylor to Hollywood to attempt to bring cigarettes back into the movies and so back into "cool." Rob Lowe plays the eccentric Hollywood executive, Jeff Megall, who is oddly obsessed over Asian culture and seems to never sleep. 
All this occurs because of a label and declining cigarette sales. As Naylor travels between meetings with a tobacco execu­tive (Robert Duvall), the now cancerous former Marlboro Man (Sam Elliot) and his weekly meetings with the "Merchants of Death" (lobbyists for the alcohol and firearms industries), the audience is made privy to the nature of spin and what it means to sell a product harmful to people. 
Naylor is ultimately a sympathetic char­acter. The struggles he faces raising his son while working for "Big Tobacco" and 
trying to separate work reporter Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes) is trite and eould be done away with if not for the fact that Heather's story on Naylor sets up the resolution of the film. 


This DVD has a very attractive casing but not much in the way of worthwhile extras. The DVD exists in the widcscreen format, and although the film does not capture any breathtaking vistas or any­thing of the like that showcases widescreen films, it is still better than the full screen edition. A featurette is interest­ing but, as this film did little different in the method of making films, it is really just information. 
Overall, the film is well done and thus the DVD is successful. For a movie that purports to be a melodrama about a guy who works for cigarette companies, there are more issues raised here than in most mainstream films. It isn't revolutionary but it does elicit questions that our time is facing and for which answers are needed. The humor, the good acting and a solid script anchor this DVD with a strong film and not-so-special extras. While the movie does not give any answers as to whether there should exist more or less restrictions on smoking, it raises some goo? questions.

Tennessee's Haynesworth wants to apologize 

Tackle attempts to contact victim of vicious foot stomp 
Associated Press 

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -Albert Haynesworth wanted to say he's sorry. All he got was a lot of unanswered ringing and a voice mailbox that was full. 
Determined to apologize to the man whose face he tore open with his cleat, the Tennessee Titans defensive tackle spent Tuesday trying to reach Dallas center Andre Gurode's cell phone, and his agent said he won't give up until he does. 
"Albert will continue until he gets through to him," said his agent, Chad Speck. 
Haynesworth was suspended five games without pay Monday by the NFL for kicking Gurode's helmet off, then swiping his cleated foot on the center's face while he lay on the ground. Haynesworth was ejected and apologized immediately after the 45-14 loss to Dallas on Sunday.

Gurode, who needed 30 stitches to repair the cuts, plans to talk with his family about whether or not to press charges, his agent told Nashville police Monday. 
The Dallas Morning News reported Tuesday that Gurode still had blurry vision Monday. Gurode said after the game Sunday that he would have gone back on the field if his vision had been clear. 
But fans and even people who pay no attention to sports con­demned Haynesworth's actions; many said five games wasn't enough. Haynesworth was replaced by a rookie teammate on his weekly radio show Tuesday night, which airs live from a shopping mall south of Nashville. 
Speck had no comment when asked if Haynesworth might appeal the unprecedented sus­pension, and Haynesworth said after the game he deserved to 
be suspended, whatever the punishment was. 
"For what I did, whatever they give me, I deserve it. I did it, and it's wrong," Haynesworth said Sunday. 
The NFL Players Association is studying the suspension, which is more than twice as long as the previous punish­ment for on-field behavior. 
"We're just in the fact-finding stage right now," NFLPA spokesman Carl Francis said. 
The Titans agreed to terms with Tony Brown on Tuesday as a replacement for Haynesworth on the defensi-ve line. 
His suspension had left Tennessee with veteran Robaire Smith, Randy Starks and rookie Jesse Mahelona. Brown is a two-year veteran who has four career starts and was most recently with Carolina. 
"I let my team down," Haynesworth said Sunday. ''I'm not saying that I'm the heart of this team, but I definitely let the team down." 
The Titans asked the league to clarify the restrictions that would be on Haynesworth dur­ing the suspension, which will keep him off the field until Nov. 19, when the Titans visit Philadelphia.

Mets' El Duque likely to miss Game 1 start 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The New York Mets are running out of healthy pitchers at the worst possible time. 
Already missing Pedro Martinez, the NL East champi­ons suddenly might have to replace scheduled starter Orlando Hernandez in Game 1 of the playoffs because of a calf injury, too. 
El Duque felt discomfort in his right leg while he was jogging in the outfield Tuesday as the Mets tuned up for their first­round series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The 40-year­old right-hander was pulled off the field and went for an MRI exam. 
"Obviously, we're up in the air on who's our starter tomorrow," Mets manager Willie Randolph said. "We have some options, obviously, but we'll wait and see how he feels first and then we'll make a decision." 
Those options are limited, however. Martinez, a three-time Cy Young Award winner, is out until next summer because of calf and shoulder injuries. 
Tom Glavine, slated to start Game 2, pitched Saturday in Washington. So if the Mets want to bump him up, the 40-year­old lefty would be working on only three days' rest. 
Steve Trachsel, who went 15­8 with a 4.97 ERA this year, skipped his scheduled outing last weekend to attend to a family matter on the West Coast. He was due back in New York on Tuesday evening, but Randolph said the right-hander probably wasn't an option to pitch Wednesday afternoon in Game 1 on such short notice. 
Randolph didn't even think Trachsel had been throwing while he was away from the team. 
That left rookie right-hander John Maine as a possibility. Maine was 6-5 with a 3.60 ERA in 16 games this season, includ­ing 15 starts. 
But he obviously lacks the October experience the Mets 
were  counting  on  with  
Hernandez,  acquired  from  
Arizona in May.  

El Duque is 9-3 with a 2.55 ERA in 19 career postseason games, including 14 starts, mostly with the Yankees. He also owns four World Series rings, and his teams are 12-3 in postseason series. 
Hernandez's MRI showed an injury to his calf, the Mets said -but they wouldn't provide further details. 
Doctors were to re-evaluate the test results Tuesday night, and the Mets planned to wait and see how Hernandez feels when he wakes up Wednesday before deciding on a starter. They must submit their 25-man roster for the first round by 10 
a.m. on Wednesday. 
"It's not great news. that's for sure," Randolph said. "He was very upset." 
As for the Dodgers, their rota­tion is all set for the first three games. 
Derek Lowe will go in the opener, followed by rookie left­bander Hong-Chih Kuo and future Hall of Farner Greg Maddux, who has 333 career wins. 
Lowe pitched his best ball of the season down the stretch, going 8-1 with a 2.39 ERA in his final 11 starts to help Los Angeles win the NL wild card.

was true to the test using skill and a little bit of luck to hold off the pressing Saint Mary's offense. The Belles' best oppor­tunity failed when junior Sarah Dubree hit the post on a shot in the 83rd minute. 
"I. felt like we played a very solid second half," MacKenzie said. "We out possessed them and had some great opportuni­ties at the end." 
Cortese also started the action late in the first half. After receiving a pass from senior Danielle Shepherd, she took advantage of a young Belles defense and ripped a shot at the upper right corner of the net just out of Heline's reach. 
Senior Ashley Hinton led the way on offense. Hinton got three shots on net and capital­ized on a penalty kick early in the second half to knot the score at one apiece. 
The kick followed two consec­utive Albion fouls on sopho­more Lauren Hinton, who was working hard inside the entire game. The goal was Hinton's third of the year. 
However, the lone goal was not enough as the Saint Mary's offense struggled to finish against Bowman and the rest of the Albion defense. 
"Until we figure out how to consistently put two halves of soccer together we are going to keep coming up short like this," MacKenzie said. 
The loss drops Saint Mary's into third place in the confer­ence behind the undefeated Calvin and Albion. 
Saint Mary's will look to get back on track against Olivet this Saturday at noon.

Weis said Ashley McConnell will likely see more time as a result of McConnell has dropped about 20 pounds. 
Like his new frame, Weis said McConnell's performance this year has been "solid." 
"He's been solid in blitz pickup and he's been solid as a lead blocker," Weis said. 
It's likely McConnell will see increased action whether or not Schwapp is redshirted ­a practice Weis said he didn't think is necessary for most of his players, barring injuries 
like Schwapp's.

McConnell has played in five games this season, rush­ing twice for two yards with one receiving touchdown. Last season, he played in three games and had one rush for three yards. 
The fullback trimmed down this year, which Weis said has made him better than he was a year ago.

"So what benefit do you have if you save a year with a guy if he's going to graduate in four years and go take a job anyway?" 
However, the medical red­shirt may help future depth at running back if Schwapp isn't able to return this year.

FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK 
Weis cotnpares McKnight to Ward 
Coach says players prepared for media 
By KEN FOWLER 
Sports Editor 

During spring practice, Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis used a pro term to describe the return of Irish receiver Rhema McKnight. Weis said the fifth-year senior's return was like "picking up a free agent" during a post-practice press conference April 5. 
Half a year later, Weis was using NFL-speak once again when describing McKnight -this time com­paring Notre Dame's lead­ing receiver to four-time Pro Bowler Hines Ward of the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
"Well, the more I watch him," Weis said, "the more he starts to remind me of a couple of the more physical types of quickness receivers. a la maybe like a Hines Ward." 
Weis favorably compared McKnight's physical attrib­utes and route-running abilities to those of Ward. 
"Ward has made a reputa­tion of being the most phys­ical blocker of any receiver in the country," Weis said. "I wouldn't say Rhema has quite gotten to that point 
yet, but he's capable of doing that. 
"But he runs routes the same and he has the same type of quicks -and also the same type of body type." 
Weis said he used Ward as a role model for former Irish receiver David Givens when he coached Givens on the New England Patriots. 
"[Rhema is] a lot like Givens. He's actually a lot smoother route runner than David was," Weis said. "David has got brute strength that very few receivers have." 
+ Weis also said the intense media coverage of Irish receiver Jeff Samardzija and quarter­back Brady Quinn will help them after they are drafted into the NFL -unless they end up with Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who limits media access even more than Weis does. 
"If they go to New England they're not going to talk to anyone anyway because they're not going to be allowed to," Weis said with a laugh. "It all depends on where they go. ThH'll go to some places and they'll be the media darlings. [But] I can prom­ise you if any of them ends up in New England, they won't be talking to the 
press." 

+ After calling a success­ful end-around that fresh­man wide receiver George West ran for an 11-yard touchdown and a fake field goal that senior receiver Jeff Samardzija took six yards for a score, Weis said he will likely replace that trick play with a new one in the team's "inventory." 
"Once I've run plays, then I replace them with new ones," We is said. "Like today in practice, we'll have a new [play] because I used some of them the other day ... They'll be called some­time this year, you just don't know when. They might be called this week." 
+ Admitting a "preju­dice," Weis picked the New York Yankees to win their Divisiona! PI ay off Series against the Detroit Tigers in four games. 

''I'm an avid Yankee fan, so I'd be rooting for them no matter what," Weis said. "So we'll see. I'm reluctant to say [the Yankees will win in] three. What do you think? Shall we say four just to play it safe? I'll say the Yankees in the Series, how's that?"

Bullfrog receivers. Walsh's defense played strong through­out the game -closing pass­ing lanes and deflecting numerous passes. 
"We didn't make any changes on defense at the half," Fallon said. "We gained confidence with the intercep­tion, and we got into a rhythm. Once we get that rhythm, we play very well." 
Welsh Family 12, Cavanaugh 0 
Welsh Family's ball control offense wore out· a tired Cavanaugh defense, riding long drives to a short victory. 
Welsh Family started the game with an eight-play drive that ended in a touchdown on .lenni Gargula's quarterback sneak. Despite missing the conversion try, Gargula said the long drive set the tone for the game. 
"It's really important to come out and score early," Gargula said. "It got us pumped." 
After Welsh's next two pos­sessions ended in punts, the Whirlwinds got back on track in their first possession of the second half with another eight­play drive that resulted in a touchdown pass to junior Kelly Bushelle. Locked between dou­ble coverage, Bushelle fought off the pressure and pulled the ball down between the defend­ers. 
Gargula threw a touchdown pass moments earlier that was negated by an illegal block. The Whirlwinds set themselves up with first-and-goal on the four-yard line after Cavanaugh was flagged for pace interfer­ence. 
The drive was jump-started by a 16-yard Gargula comple­tion. She completed 6-of-7 passes for 29 yards on the drive. 
Gargula was pestered by the Cavanaugh defensive line the entire game, but was unfazed. 
"It didn't affect our play," she said. "I got around the pres­sure, but I didn't notice it at the time, because I was looking downfield at my receivers." 
After forcing a Cavanaugh turnover on downs, the Whirlwinds' final possession was a time-consuming nine­play, 25-yard drive in which Welsh Family fooled the Chaos defense with several quarter­back options. 
"We used the option near the end to keep the clock running," Gargula said. 
Gargula completed 16-of-23 passes for 80 yards and a touchdown in the game. 
Cavanaugh got the ball with under a minute remaining, but quarterback Katie Dunn threw an interception to end the game. 
Cavanaugh could not gain momentum on offense throughout the matchup. Though it mixed up the calls with play-action passes, motion and options, the team failed to find consistency in their attack. 
Though Dunn remained calm under duress, Welsh Family's defensive line forced Dunn to throw before the plays devel­oped. 
"Our coached stressed pres­suring the quarterback," defensive lineman Meghan Mulhern said. "It makes a big difference when you put pres­sure on the quarterback. They have to make quick decisions, and that helps the secondary to make their decisions." 
Lyons 24, Pasquerilla East 0 
Lyons quarterback Claire Connell scrambled for three touchdowns and threw for one to lead the Lions to a 24-0 vic­tory over Pasquerilla East Tuesday -their first win of the season. 
The Lions got off to a fast start, scoring on their second possession of the game. After three completed passes to three different receivers, Connell scrambled from 10 yards out to put Lyons up 6-0. 
Lyons' defense was quick to match its offense, when Patti Pogge intercepted a Laura Adams pass on the third play of the ensuing Pyro drive with two minutes remaining in the first half. The interception set up a 15-yard touchdown

Walsh junior quarterback Mary Sullivan throws the ball in the 7-6 Wild Women victory over Badin Tuesday. 

scramble by Connell as time expired in the half to put Lyons up 12-0. 
In the second half, Connell rushed for another touchdown to put the Lions up 18-0. On the first play of the ensuing Pyro drive, Lyons junior .Jo Anna Collins intercepted Adams' pass. 
Connell's touchdown pass in the final two minutes put the Lions up 24-0. Though the Lyons refused to take mercy on the Pyros, women's interhall rules did -forcing the game to end. 
While the Pyros were unable to put any points on the board, they moved the ball effectively downfield early in the game. Their opening drive lasted eight plays, while the team moved the ball to the Lyons 10­yard line. 
The bulk of the Pyro offense came from receiver Caroline Nally, who caught seven pass­es, none of which came in the second half. Nally also sacked Connell once and handled Pyro punts. 
The Lions were elated after scoring their first victory of the season, and senior captain Cheron Wilson said it felt amazing -crediting the entire team with the victory. 
"Our energy was really high as a team. Everyone was exe­cuting and we're really excit­ed," she said. 
Both squads play again on Sunday, but neither team will advance to the playoffs. The lack of postseason implications should have no effect on preparation for Sunday's game, according to Pyro coach Nathan Dyer. 
"We play Sunday," he said. "It's a game, and we'll play to win the game."

three-game winning streak and is unbeaten in its past four matches heading into Wednesday's contest in Ann Arbor. 
Clark remains confident Lapira won't have to carry the offense for much longer. 
"It would be nice to get some of the other lads back [into scoring]." Clark said. "I think there's a lot of goals there. It's just a matter of time before some of the other guys start helping Joe out." 
One of the players Clark expects to put balls in the back of the net is forward Justin McGeeney. McGeeney has four goals on 
week last week and has given up only one goal in the last four games. 
Clark said the offense and defense had begun to play off each other, and implied that Cahill and Lapira were not the only players who had been playing well of late. 
"I think you have to be care­ful you don't forget the rest of the team because they help make both these people more successful," he said. "You don't just get goals off one guy and you don't stop goals with one guy. It's a team thing. The whole team is taking chances, and we've been dominating." 
The Wolverines will be spearheaded by forward Perica Marosevic. Marosevic leads Michigan with five goals and was named the Big Ten

playing well [before his injury], and he's almost back to full fitness," Clark said. "Hopefully, he's almost back to one hundred percent." 
Regardless of who scores the goals, Clark is pleased that the offense has found its rhythm after an inconsistent start. 
"It's no question its goals are what win games," he said. "It's great when you get on the scoreboard. Early in the season we were making good chances, but we weren't con­verting. It's nice when we do convert." 
Defensively, the Irish have fared well behind goalkeeper Chris Cahill. Cahill was named the Big East goalkeeper of the

Ultimately, Clark said the Irish were looking forward to the intensity that comes as a part of the Notre Dame­Michigan rivalry. 
"There's no love lost between these two universi­ties on the athletic fields," he said.

FOOTBALL 

Weis, Schwapp think over redshirt options 
By KATE GALES Associate Soprrs Ediror 

At first, it didn't seem like a big deal. Asaph Schwapp left the 
.. field on Sept. 9 against Penn State. After the game, Irish c o a c h Charlie See Also W e i s 
"Weis compares

said it seemed McKnight to like the 
Ward"

running back's page21 l e g "locked up on him." 
But Schwapp hasn't seen playing time since the 41-17 win, and Weis is now con­sidering a medical redshirt for the sophomore. 
"His injury is an injury that will be with us the entire year," We is said. "The question is simply this, OK: Can he play with it or can't
-
he play with it?" 
Schwapp had four rushes for 15 yards in two games. Last season, he made his 
Red44 

first start at fullback against USC. He played in all 12 games and had 27 rushes for 67 yards along with three receptions for 22 yards. 
Tuesday, Weis said he would prefer to redshirt Schwapp if he won't be able to play through the injury. Because the injury occurred early enough in the season, he will be eligible to apply to the NCAA for a medical redshirt. 
"If I feel he can't play with it, then I'm better off to go ahead and get it fixed because if I get it fixed then I'm going to end up losing him for the rest of the sea­son," he said. "If he can play with it, then we go through the whole year, we practice and we play and then we fix it after the year is over." 
Weis expects to make that decision after this week. 
Weis was faced with a similar situation last year with Rhema McKnight, when the receiver went down with a knee injury against Michigan on Sept. 10, 2005. McKnight was

Belles drop 2-1 tnatch to Albion 
By DAN MURPHY Sporrs Writer 

Albion forward Brittany Cortese netted her second goal of the game from close range with 14 minutes remaining to give the Britons a 2-1 victory over Saint Mary's Tuesday. 
The loss drops the Belles to 2-1 in MIAA play and 3-6 over­all. 
Cortese's goal -her sixth of the season -came off a rebound when Saint Mary's goalkeeper Laura Heline stopped midfielder Andrea Torvinen but was unable to control the shot. The junior for­ward was able to free herself from her defender long enough to bury the game winner. 
"It was an unfortunate goal," Saint Mary's coach Caryn MacKenzie said. "[Heline] had the sun right in her eyes, the ball kind of short hopped her and she couldn't pull it in." 
The Belles threatened to tie it up again in the final 10 min­utes with four quality chances. Britons keeper Caitlin Bowman

INTERHALL 
Wasikowski hauls in game-winning score 
Walsh knocks offBadin thanks to stingy defense 
By BILL BRINK and JOHN 
TIERNEY 
Sporrs Writers 

Badin quarterback Katie Rose Hackney's second-half intercep­tion sparked a 28-yard drive that ended in what proved to be the decisive score in Walsh's 7­6 victory over the Bullfrogs. 
Wild Woman Mary Sullivan threw a touchdown pass to Laurie Wasikowski to lead Walsh in Tuesday night's offen­sive struggle. 
The Bullfrogs hung around to keep it close. Badin began a drive with 1:15 left when Hackney connected with senior Meghan Charlebois twice, one for 48 yards and the next for 21 yards. The Bullfrogs found the end zone with 26 seconds left on a pass to Courtney Rains in the corner of the end zone. 
On the point-after attempt, however, Walsh had Rains cov­ered tightly and the pass was knocked down to preserve the victory 
"We expected Rains or [wide receiver LizziJ Shappell to get the ball, and we were surprised by the fade to Rains," Walsh coach Brian Fallon said. "We thought the ball would go to Shappell because she's taller." 
Sullivan completed 13-of-24 passes for 81 yards and a touchdown and added 31 rush­ing yards. 
Hackney completed 8-of-20 passes for 89 yards, a touch­down and an interception. Hackney was hampered by four first half dropped balls by

ND looks to find new scoring threats at UM 
By ERIC RETTER Associate Sporrs Ediror 

Notre Dame coach Bobby Clark anticipatPs that some­one other than forward Joseph Lapira will score Wednesday against Michigan (5-5-2, 0-1-1 Big Ten). Not that he minds if only Lapira does it. 
The Irish junior, who has 13 goals this season, was named Big East offensive player of the week last week for the second time this season. He scored two goals in each of Notre Dame's last three games, including the opening goal in each match. In large part because of his perform­ance, No. 8 Notre Dame (7-3­2, 5-2-0 Big East) is on a
