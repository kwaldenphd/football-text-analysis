The solo artist and former lead singer with the group Black Sabbath was arrested at his home north of London on Saturday, police said. A judge granted bail but ordered Osbourne to stay away from his wife, Sharon, and to return to court on Sept. 25. He was not required to enter a plea. Osbourne, 40, and his 37 -year-old wife have three children. Osbourne returned home last month after a concert tour in Japan. 
Former President Nixon has postponed a visit to China beeause of the politieal unrest there. Nixon, who made a historic visit to China in 1972, was to have traveled to China this month along with former Treasury Secretary William Simon, Pacific Business News reported Monday. Nixon was invited by the government of China and the purpose of the trip was personal, Nixon spokesman John Taylor said. 
A man in military fatigues opened fire with an automatic rifle in Colombia Monday at passengers crowding into the airport in this eoeaine trafficking center, killing one man before security fon~es shot him to death.

For sale in Lehigh Acres, Florida: 29,000 home lots, two 18-hole golf courses, a 1,700-seat auditorium, a building supply store, a 121-room hotel with restaurant, and a weekly newspaper. Federal bank regulators are looking for a buyer for the develop­ment company that owns more than 10 percent of this one-light town's land and nearly all of the major recreation and public facilities. Land Resources Corp., which came under federal control in May, is among the more curious jetsam of the nation's savings and loan crisis, which has coughed up other odd thrift holdings from llamas to a desert bordello. 
An eighty year old novice composer. Minna Keal, who resumed her music studies after retiring, heard the premiere of her first symphony Monday at the Royal Albert Hall in London. ''I'm living my life in reverse; instead of feeling that my whole life is bnhind me, I feel it's all in front of me," she said before the British Broadcasting Corp. Symphony Orchestra performed her work, which she ealls simply "Symphony." "The fact of her having produced a major symphony -a major symphony, not just a nice little symphony -as her third piece of music is beyond belief," said Oliver Knussen, who taught Mrs. Keal composition and conducted her work Monday night at the annual summer "Promenade" concerts., 
Men are going to court in increasing numbers to stake a legal claim in pregnancies, says the general counsel for the National Hight to Life Committee. Husbands or boyfriends wanting to prevent their partners' abortions have filed at least 19 suits in 13 states since March 1988, said lawyer James Bopp Jr. of Terre Haute, Ind. Bopp's litigation kit is being used nationwide by men who want to keep wives or girlfriends from having abortions. So far, it's stalled some abortions, but none of the cases has succBeded on appeal. 
On Labor Day. striking telephone workers bargained on and striking pilots protested, but for other workers the informal end to summer was a day for parades and picnics, politicians and fireworks. There were also non-labor annual traditions, like the mass walk across Michigan's 4 1/2-mile Mackinac Bridge, and the Fred Coleman Memorial Shoot, a pigeon shoot at Hegins, Pa., that drew animal rights protesters. Michigan Gov. James Blanchard and his bride, married Saturday, led about 60,000 people on the traditional Labor Day trek across the Mackinac Bridge, but this year's walk was marred by a few anti-abortion protestors. The walk proceeded from St. Ignace on the Upper Peninsula, across the Straits of Mackinac that connect Lakes Huron and Michigan, to Mackinac City on the Lower Peninsula. 
Bellhops beware: The 51 women arriving in Atlantic City on Tuesday for the Miss America Pageant will bring a lot of luggage. Preliminary competitions for the 69-year-old pageant begin Sept. 
12. For the first time this year, each contestant was required to submit an essay on an issue of her choice; if she wins the crown, she will be able to promote that issue during her yearlong reign, said pageant direetor Leonard Horn. "It is not a beauty pageant, and it is not just a scholarship pageant," Horn said. "This program fosters personal growth and achievement, and scholarship is not an end in itself, it's a means to an end."

I returned to Notre Dame feeling somewhat Business Editor like a freshman, but officially a junior. The last 
time I had seen most of my good friends they were wishing me good luck and goodbye as I set out to spend the year in Rome. I was a freshman then. I returned a good year later, a junior. 
Things are a weird combination of the same, yet different for all those students who have studied abroad. Our freshman friends are still around, faithful as ever, but the social groups have changed. Everybody changes and readjusts over their sophomore year. For students returning from foreign study they often find the changes shocking. 
It was easy to think that time stood still while I was away. Often times I hopefully thought it would. Notre Dame is home and during the hard times in a far away land it was good to remember that some things stayed constant. 
Coming back I realized that a whole year had gone by. My friend and I had a full set of experiences apart from each other. We had all grown. 
I wouldn't trade my experience in Rome for anything. I did miss some events on campus, but gladly my friends can brief me on all the details 
OF INTEREST 
of a National Championship Season. 
There is a large gap in my Notre Dame memory. But, that gap was a rich experience with new friends and a different culture. I had had a unique opportunity to travel and see the world. 
However, that doesn't make me feel any better when I realize I have never even heard of the building my Government class is in. I feel as if I am an overgrown freshman. However, this didn't feel half as bad as the sophomore who mistook me for a friends inter hall "little sister." 
I really grew and enjoyed my sojourn, but I know it is time to move on. My studies in Home where a step in my education. Now it is part of my past, something I will treasure, but will never be able to recapture. What I learned will make me more able to enjoy and benefit from the rest of my time here. 
I'm happy to be back at Notre Dame. It is time to pick up relationships with old friends, keep in touch with new ones, and lind new challenges. For me it is time to move on, but now, for me, that means staying close to the Golden Dome. 
The annual Campus Activities Night will occur tonight from 7 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. at the JACC Fieldhouse. Over 140 clubs and orga­nizations will be represented. Anyone interested in joining a club or organization should attend. 
The NO American Chemical Society 
will hold their first meeting of the year today at 7 p.m. in 118 Nieuwland Science Hall. All inter­ested students are invited and encouraged to at­tend.

Purdue University announced a record number of students on its West Lafayette campus for the third year in a row. But the number of freshmen has de­clined from 7,326 to 6,681. 
Fall-semester enrollment at 
Purdue is 35,817-an increase 
of 848 students over the 1988 
record of 34,969. 
Enrollment at Notre Dame, South Bend, dropped slightly from 9,980 in 1988 to 9,725 this year, according to the Registrar's office . 
At Franklin College, officials expect last year's record of 812 students will likely be topped. Thomas Ramey, vice president for student affairs, expects the tally to show the college has about 870 students, including nearly 300 expected to be freshmen. The freshmen class would have been larger except that administrators had to limit the size of the incoming class. 
Anderson University students are due back at classes Tuesday following orientation for freshmen and new students. 
Michael Collette, dean of aca­demic support services and uni­versity registrar at the Church of God-affiliated liberal arts college, is expecting enrollment to at least reach the 2,022 mark of last year.

Notre Dame parents con­tributed $4,009,108 in 1987-88, according to the annual report on voluntary contributions to American higher education by the Council for Aid to Education (CFAE) in new York City. Brown University, Dartmouth College, Duke and Vanderbilt Universities fol­lowed in order to make up the top five. 
In overall giving, Notre Dame ranked 19th among the coun­try's independent colleges and universities with a total of $44,738,284 during 1987-88. Stanford, Harvard, Cornell, Yale and Pennsylvania Universities comprised the top five in overall giving, according to CFAE figures. Notre Dame's total was the third highest in University history. In 1986-87, it raised more money-$45.9 million-but was ranked one notch lower at 20th among pri­vate institutions. 
In corporate matching gifts Notre Dame was 6th in both number of gifts matched (4971) and the amount contributed in matching funds ($1,450,239). The University was 13th in the percentage of solicited alumni who gave (38 percent) and 17th in total alumni contributions ($12,595,740). It ranked 16th among private institutions in awards from foundations ($13,257,723). 
The CFAE report said that es­timated 1987-88 private con­tributions of $8.2 billion to U.S. colleges and universities fell 3.5 percent from 1986-87, the first dip since 197 4.

The first meeting of the Saint Mary's Board of Student Affairs focused on promoting school spirit, student involve­ment, and an appreciation for cultural diversity. 
MaryBeth Blajda, vice-presi­dent of Student Affairs, chaired the meeting which consisted of the vice-presidents of each class and hall along with vari­ous other commissioners. 
One way students can learn about the clubs and organiza­tions at Saint Mary's College is to attend Activities Night held today at 8 p.m. in the Angela Center. 
Other areas of interest in­clude the Performing Arts Series located in the ()'Laughlin Auditorium. On Sept. 15, Dance Kaleidoscope, an eight­member company  will preform contemporary dancing. 
Calllpus Ministry and You 
'Catholic' or 'catholic'? 
Are you a catholic or a Catholic or both or neither? 
The word "catholic" is a Greek word that means universal. So, at its best, a University referring to itself as Catholic would be one open to all people every­where. 
Have you experienced the Catholic Notre Dame as being a catholic Notre Dame? Has it been your experience that University Catholics are able and willing to reach out well beyond themselves to everyone everywhere? Or do you, rather, think of the University as being a narrowly defined, select group of persons who exclude certain groups and populations from full membership? 
At Notre Dame, the University admin­istration is charged to make sure we remain a Catholic University. The office of campus ministry accepts as part of its mission a charge to make sure we stay catholic. That means campus min­istry wants to be available to serve the spiritual growth of all members of the University community -not even just those who call themselves "Catholic". 
The purpose of this column is to let you know that we stand ready to do just that. Whoever you are and what1wer you might believe, we are available to you to assist with your exploration of spiritual issues. Such exploration is an important part of the University years -to ignore it is to miss out on crucial development. 
Sometimes that exploration will be about ways to increase your life of faith. This can be done through in­volvement in programs of religious edu­cation, retreats, the Notre Dame En­counter with Christ and/or a relation­ship with a pastoral counselor or a spiritual director. 
At other times your exploration might for human rights activists. 
Western reporters at the scene said the predominantly young crowd carried banners calling for more freedom. "Freedom to Travel Instead of Mass Escapes," said one sign. Another said, "For an Open State with Free People."

focus more on doubts or on current disagreement with what you had once unquestionably accepted. Or your focus might be on dealing with hurts and angers perceived to have been caused by the Church or by church members. 
As you might have heard, the Univer­sity is taking a long, in depth look at the role of campus ministry at Notre Dame. The Task Force on Evangeliza­tion, Pastoral Ministry and Social Val­ues has been created to explore various issues related to the religious life of the University community. The scope of the charge to that task force is very en­compassing and it will be about a year before its work is completed. 
But the office of campus ministry does not intend to remain dormant until the task force has completed its work. So if you have any ideas at all as to how we might better serve the University community or any segment of it -especially those segments that have been or consider themselves to have been underserved by the University -let us know. 
Especially let us know if you're inter­ested in helping to shape the sorts of programs we develop through the office of campus ministry. It is our intent to establish a number of groups to advise us on effective ways to serve the needs of a variety of population groups, in­cluding graduate students, off-campus students, racial. ethnic, religious and sexual minority students, etc. If you'd be interested in helping with that en­deavor, let us know. 
Give a call to the office, or tonight be at Student Activities night at the JACC. We'll be the ones wearing the ASK ME WHY buttons. Ask us why you should care about campus ministry. I trust we'll be able to tell you.

As the crowd tri11d to march toward the center of the city, security forces blocked the way. 
Scuffles broke out as plain­clothesmen tore down protest banners, and several demon­strators were dragged away and arrested, witnesses said. 
Later Monday, about 200 protesters left the St. Nicholas church and marched to Leipzig's train station shouting, "Free Hide to Giessen!" 
One of the main refugen re­ception centers in West Ger­many is in Gicssen, near Frank­furt. 
Witnesses said security troops watched the march from side streets but did not inter­venn and the crowd dispersed after reaching the railroad station.

NAACP says police in Va. Beach 'overreacted' 
Associated Press 
VJHGINIA BEACH, Va. -An NAACP official Monday accused authorities of overreacting during two nights of clashes between black college students and police -an allegation this resort city's mayor denied. 
Up to 23 people were injured and more than 100 stores looted in the bottle-throwing melees, which disrupted the Labor Day holiday in this re­sort of 250,000 and left miles of normally busy beaches nearly empty. 
Police said up to 100,000 young people, many here for an annual fraternity festival of students from mostly black col­leges, were on the streets when rioting broke out early Sunday. Violence resumed Sunday night and police, backed up by state troopers and National Guardsmen, imposed an overnight curfew. 
Police reported arresting 160 people and issuing 395 citations through Sunday afternoon. Arrest figures overnight were not immediately released. 
Jack Gravely, president of the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said police reaction would have 
been different if the students 
had been white. 

"Their response was to con­front the students from a posi­tion of power," Gravely said. "The Virginia NAACP strongly condemns the overzealous, overpowering and overreactive actions of the Virginia Beach police." 
But, Gravely, added, "That is not to say that they did not have a right to protect property and persons." 
NAACP officials and students have said they felt unwelcome in the city and had been ha­rassed by police. Gravely said the trouble erupted as students "felt squeezed" by police and "felt a need to show discon­tent."

NO grads rank 18th in number of Ph.D.s~~~':ed 
Special to the Observer 
Notre Dame ranks 18th among American private uni­versities in the number of doc­torates earned by its bachelor's degree recipients, according to a Georgetown University re­port. Notre Dame stands first among Catholic universities in the report, which ranks a total of 79 doctoral-granting, pri­vate universities. 
Notre Dame baccalaureates "professional fields," a cate­gory including architecture, business, law, social work and theology (13th); chemistry (16th); and politics and inter­national relations (17th). 
From 1977-86, the most re­cent ten years covered by the report, 810 doctorates were conferred on students who earned their bachelor's degrees at Notre Dame. Notre Dame baccalaureates ranked eighth in both engineering and agri­cultural sciences doctorates earned during this period. 
The Georgetown report is based on data compiled annu­ally since 1920 by The Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel of the National Research Council. First profes­sional degrees, including the 
M.D. and J.D. are not included in the data. Harvard and Cornell Universities stand a close first and second, respec­tively, in the rankings.

The right choice. 
during rally 
Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -Police used tear gas, bullets and batons Monday to disrupt rallies against national elections that exclude blacks, and briefly arrested Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Al­lan Boesak. 
Acting President F. W. de Klerk said in his final campaign speech that white domination must end. 
Before de Klerk spoke in front of City Hall in Johannes­burg, 125 blacks marched there to present a petition telling him that Wednesday's parliamen­tary elections symbolize apartheid to the black majority who cannot vote. The marchers dispersed peacefully after giv­ing their petition to a police major. 
In Durban, police fired tear gas and guns on Monday to disperse an anti-election rally of 2,500 students at the mul­tiracial University of Natal, causing a stampede in which 10 people were hurt. Police fired tear gas at 500 students hold­ing a banned rally at the Indian University of Durban-Westville. Officers arrested 26 students at the two gatherings. 
In Cape Town, police jammed an armored truck against the door of Central Mission Methodist Church where people gathered to hold a banned rally. People were trapped in­side the church, and witnesses said police beat people in the streets, including a teen-age boy, as they tried to get to the meeting. 
Tutu, the black Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, and Boesak, mixed-race president of the World Alliance of Re­formed Churches, were among those arrested at the church when they refused police orders to leave. 
They were freed, along with several journalists who had 
been arrested for covering the events. 
Police said Boesak was ar­
rested for taking part in an il­
legal gathering, but made no 
comment about Tutu, the 1984 
Nobel Peace laureate. 
Earlier, about 20 policemen entered St. George's Cathedral, where Tutu officiates, ordered it closed and banned people from attending a scheduled choir concert. "They gave no reason, repeating only that the cathedral had to remain closed," said Tutu spokesman John Allen. 
More than 30 police with dogs and batons blocked the Johannesburg procession 300 yards from the City Hall en­trance and ordered the crowd to disperse. The protesters, holding their placards, sat down in the street while Cyril Ramaphosa, leader of the Na­tional Union of Mineworkers, South Africa's largest union, asked to present the petition to de Klerk. 
"Our people for over a month now have actually been showing in various ways how these elec­tions are irrelevant," Hamaphosa said, referring to daily protests. rallies marches or acts of defiance against apartheid laws. He said millions of bla('ks on Tuesday and Wednesday will protest in what is expected to be a general strike. 
"We believe that is the real election. That is how our people are casting a vote," he said.

Coalition weaves 'seamless garment' of rights 

The Coalition for Human Rights is not a new organiza­tion on campus. It is an at­tempt to link together several already existing groups which are concerned with human rights issues, from the basic right to life for all persons, in­cluding the unborn, to political, economic and social rights in this country and abroad, so that we can support one an­other's work. Often those who are committed to one issue are unaware of what is being done by another group. Sharing re­sources and exchanging infor­mation will benefit all the par­ticipating groups. The Coalition hopes that the various member groups, from Amnesty International to Hight to Life, will mobilize in support of one another. 
The formation of the Coalition for Human Bights is much more than a tactical move, however. It represents the conviction that any assault on human rights, whether apartheid in South Africa or gender discrimination in our society, threatens the rights of all persons. The Coalition is in­spired by what has come to be called the "seamless garment" approach within the Right to Life movement. This position, publicly supported by the Catholic Bishops of the United States, holds that the right to 
Rev. Michael S. Himes 
On Human Rights 
life must be seen as an indivisi­ble whole. Any violation of any­one's right to life weakens ev­eryone's claim to such a right. Thus opposition to abortion on demand is linked to opposition to the death penalty; support for the homeless entails work for disarmament. The Coalition will attempt to foster a similar "seamless garment" position on human rights and so to ener­gize its constituent groups to work with and for one another. 
There are a multitude of rea­sons why all people should be concerned to defend human rights, and why we at Notre Dame should be passionately involved in such defense. Out of that multitude of reasons, I shall pluck one, and that per­haps not an especially obvious one. But it is an important one for those who are religious be­lievers, more especially Christian believers, and even more especially Catholic Christian believers. One can not understand what the word "God" means unless one honors· the dignity of the human per­son. 
Deeply rooted in the Jewish and Christian traditions is the prohibition of idolatry. The 
Today's column is the first in what will be a continuing series of articles from members of the Coalition for Human Rights, a network of social justice organizations on campus. The articles will all carry the title "On Human Rights." The author of today's column, Fr. Michael Himes, is the faculty sponsor for the Coalition.

single set of facts." Wherever and whenever human rights are violated, wherever and whenever human beings are treated as means to ends and not as ends in themselves, the word "God," if used at all, is used idolatrously and blas­phemously. 
The Christian tradition has made an even more extraordi­nary claim, that God has united God's self with the image. Our faith in the incarnation main­tains, in some of the most an­cient of Christian words, that the Lord "being in the form of God, did not count equality with God something to be grasped. but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, becoming as human beings are" (Philippians 2:6-7). One essential corollary of the incarnation is that hu­manity is what we now share with God. Or put another way, if you want to be like god, be 
first commandment of the decalogue is against worship­ping false gods. But the sec­ond, which warns against mis­using the name of God, is very closely related to it. For in fact it too is concerned with idola­try: be very careful how you employ the word "God." Idolatry probably does not seem an exceptionally strong temptation for most of us. Few of us are likely to hack up an occasional calf for Baal or sling the odd pigeon in Zeus's direction. But idolatry remains the primary temptation for the religiously inclined. The first two commandments of the decalogue are a warning to watch what we worship. For God is not to be identified with our best images of "God." And there lies the danger. Whatever we pray to or preach about, however holy, powerful, scrip­turally grounded, doctrinally approved, is not God. Any im-

Shakespeare Fest celebrates director's last year 
CARLA JOHNSON 
accent writer 

During the course of the last weekend in September, Notre Dame students and faculty will be treated to four noted Shakespearean plays -"A Midsummer Night's Dream," "The Shoemaker's Holiday," "Kiss Me Kate," and "Henry V, "-as well as a party with the cast of "Kiss Me Kate." 
Since the Stratford Shakespeare Festival opened in May 1955, it has been a mecca for lovers of fine theatre. But few who have visited Stratford as a respite from the hassle and expanse of London and New York have realized that, when John Neville, the artistic director of the Festival, came to the helm, the Festival was in financial trouble. 
Stratford's is not the only Canadian theatre Neville has saved. Prior to his tenure at Stratford, he revived theatres in Alberta and Halifax. Still, nothing in his background could have predicted his busi­ness acumen. In a recent inter­view Neville reveals his success along with his decision that he will retire at the end of the 1989 season. 
In late spring, Public Image 
Limited released the ninth al­
bum in their eleven-year career. 
The album, entitled 9, is an 
overall fine effort and proved 
to be somewhat of a break­
through for the band. 
9 is basically a pop album 
with many catchy, 80s-type 
dance songs. This offers a 
sharp contrast to the band's 
early, more organic albums. 
While the change may not sit 
well with longtime PIL fans, it 
has helped the band gain more 
recognition in the States. The 
first two releases, "Happy" and 
"Disappointed", scored rather 
well on U.S. radio stations this 
summer. 
A change in guitarists has 
caused the shift in sound from 
hard rock to softer pop songs. 
This is most apparent on side 
two of 9. "Like That" and 
"Armada" are good dance 
tracks, complete with catchy 
keyboards and female back­
ground singers. This change is 
not too surprising since PIL has 
been trying to refine their 
sound since they started in 
1978. However, the band's new 
style may not be welcome be­
cause it appears that they have 
sacrificed some of their talent 
in favor of technology. 
The best songs on 9 are 
"Warrior" and "U.S.L.S. 1." 
These tracks allow lead singer 
Johnny Lydon, formerly Johnny 
Rotten of the Sex Pistols, to 
showcase his obnoxious, yet 
powerful voice. On "Warrior" 
Lydon paints a self-portrait by 
singing about a man obsessed 
with integrity: "This is my 
landll'm a warriorll'll never 
surrender." Lydon, with haunt­
ing lyrics and vocals, sings 
about the evil of war on 
"U.S.L.S. 1." 
These veteran English rockers 
have put out a great album and 
anyone unfamiliar with PIL 
should give it a listen. 
to the new artistic director.  
This is the first time in 30 years  
that I do not have any plans,  
except to stay in Stratford,"  
where he has purchased a  
home. For now, reviving the  
Stratford Festival "has taken  
its toll."  
Four plays will be presented  
this year, "A Midsummer  
Night's Dream," "The  
Shoemaker's Holiday," "Kiss  
Me Kate," and "Henry V." In  
past years, tickets for this  
weekend have sold out quickly,  
so those wishing to be included  
should buy tickets as soon as  
possible. There will be only one  
bus for transportation and  
leaves campus at 7 a.m. on  
Friday, September 29 to return  
late on Sunday, October 1. The  
cost is $180 and includes  
transportation, bed and break­ 
fast, tickets to the plays, a  
commentary by Dr. James  
Robinson of the English  
Department, and the "Kiss Me  
Kate" party. Tickets can be ob­ 
tained in the College Fellows  
Office in O'Shaughnessy Hall.  
Editor's note: Carla Johnson  
is an adjunct assistant profes­ 
sor in the Freshman Writing  
Program.  
The summer saw the release  
of a new album by Love and  
Rockets. The self-titled LP is  
the fourth from this English  
trio. Fans will be happy to  
know that it is as good as their  
previous efforts.  
Love and Rockets contains ten  
songs spanning over forty  
minutes. Guitarist/vocalist  
Daniel Ash and bassist/vocalist  
David J write about such topics  
as motorcycles, devils, and  
heaven and hell. "Motorcycle" is  
a rockin' tune about the free­ 
dom Ash feels on his bike.  
"Bound For Hell", a blues-in­ 
fluenced track, describes J's  
dream of a train headed for  
hell.  
Love and Rockets also con­ 
tains some great slow songs  
reminiscent of 1987's Earth,  
Sun, Moon. "The Teardrop  
Collector", featuring a melodic  
guitar solo, is a mellow track in  
which Ash asks "If you don't  
love someone, why fake it? And  
if you love someone why chain  
them to you?" Other slow  
songs include "So Alive", an in­ 
toxicating track that hit it big  
this summer, and "No Words  
No More", with acoustic gui­ 
tars and harmonica.  - 
One drawback to Love and  
Rockets is the arrangements of  
songs. Side one starts off  
strong then drops off. The first  
two songs "Jungle Law" and  
"No Big Deal" are great rock  
songs featuring fuzz bass, loud  - 
guitars, and slightly distorted  
vocals. 'The Purest Blue", a  
dreadfully slow song, follows.  
This sort of imbalance is an­ 
noying because it keeps the lis­ 
tener from getting into a  
groove while playing the album.  
Nevertheless, this album  
keeps up to the standards set  
by Love and Rockets' previous  
albums, and definitely deserves  
some attention.  

John Neville, who pulled the Festival out of financial trouble, has decided to hand over the reins 
The London-born Neville served in the Royal Navy during World War II. When the war ended, he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. At London's Old Vic, he portrayed some of Shakespeare's most popular characters -Hamlet, Richard II, and Sir Andrew Aguecheek; he alternated per­forming Othello and Iago with Richard Burton. Finally, he created the title role in "Alfie." 
After receiving the Order of the British Empire in 1965, he enjoyed a self-confessed "high­profile, lucrative career." When he was invited to direct a ­Canadian production in 1972, however, he gave up his estab­lished career to become a Canadian citizen. 
At Stratford, he has been one of the few theatre administra­tors who has continued to act and direct. He portrayed Professor Higgins in Stratford's big musical of 1988, "My Fair Lady", and di­rected "Mother Courage" and "Othello" in 1987 while appear-

Neville ended the dominance of Gilbert and Sullivan op­erettas which had character­ized Stratford's seasons in the early 80s, restoring Shakespeare to the Shakespeare Festival. "After all, his name is in the title," Neville argues. "He is our resi­dent playwright, as it were." Neville concedes that

Women's soccer is looking to avoid a 'sophomore jinx' 
BY COLLEEN HENNESSEY 
Sports Writer 
When the Notre Dame Women's soccer team moved up to varsity status last year head coach Dennis Grace insisted that the team would start out strong. instead of attempting to "wean" itself from the club scmlC. His confidence proved well founded when they accomplislwd an incredible 13­5-1 record in that inaugural season and now, on the eve of their sophomore year. his enthusiasm is promising. 
"It is amazing to me how quickly these girls have formed themselves into a team." he said. "We have a lot of new faces but the sense of group identity is already very strong." 
Those new faces, in the form of five starting freshmen, will prove important in today's opening game at St. Joseph's Htmsselaer. Despite their inexperience, Grace has much faith in the new recruits. 
"There will be some adjustments," he said. "But they're hard workers and they're really doing some nice things out there. " 
Among the freshmen to keep an eye on are Denise Chabot, Marta HoemPr, Margaret Jarc and Karen Wyger, all of whom promise to make real contributions to this young team. 
"There's not a lot of room for superstars on this team," said Grace. "Luckily, we have a 
great work ethic and everyone 
is interested in contributing." 
Senior co-captains Joy Sisolak and K.T. Sullivan will provide the strength and experience that the Irish need. Also returning this season to anchor the Irish offense are last year's leading scorer sophomore Susie Zilvitis and junior Mimi Suba. They will look for support from returning sweeper Molly Lennon as well as freshman goalkeeper Michelle Lodyga. 
Grace emphasized that an overall effort will be required to make this a successful second season for the women's team. 
"I think we have just as much talent and potential," added Sisolak. "and we were undefeated at home last year. Things have come together very well for us." 
This season's upgraded schedule will add new challenges,however, as Notre Dame faces at least 3 top twenty teams, including Wisconsin-Madison, a team that placed third in the country last year. 
"Challenges never hurt anybody, " Grace is quick to point out. " We're young and inexperienced, but I feel good about the past 10 days of training. As long as we play our hardest and our best we are satisfied. " 
Nobody can argue with that, but it is more than likely that this team will win a few games along the way as well. 


The Kansas City Royals lost 5-1 to the Detroit Tigers , ending Bret Saberhagen's personal eight-game winning streak. The Royals remain two-and-a-half games behind the Oakland Athletir.s in the American League West.

Irish alumnus Green survives Bears' final cuts 
Associated Press 
LAKE FOREST, Ill. -As the Bean waived tZ players to reach the season-opening 4.7­man roster, Coach Mike Ditka expressed concern Monday about his team's lackluster pre­season perfonnanoe. 
"We stunk in the pre-season, but we won't stink once the season begins, hopefully," said Ditka, speaking at his weekly news conference. The Bears had a .Z-.Z record in their pre­season exhibitions. 
Five veterans won't be around for Sunday's regular season opener against the defending AFC Champion Cincinnati Bengals. Seven rookies were also cut in the final roster trims. 
Ditk.a said it was an ex­tremely difficult decision to cut Kurt Beck.er, an eight-year veteran out ol Michi.!!an. Becker has been a mainstay as one of the top three offensive guards the past few seasons. 
"I told our football team that I hate to get rid of players with character, and I respect the effort he has given us the past six or seven years," Ditka said, referring to Beck.er. "He'll do fine." 
Ditk.a said he hated to lose 
players lik.e Beck.er, but he bad 
decided "we're going to go with 
sane of the young people." 
"I've been around too many teams that have gotten old." 
Eighteen of the 47 players on the final roster are in their first orsecond year. 
The other veterans cut were defensive tack.les Sean Smith and John Shannon, safety Todd Krunun and center John Adick.es. Smith and Adickes were three-year players, while Krumm and Shannon had been in their second year. 
The seven rookies cut were quarterback. Brent Snyder, a seventh-round draft pick. out of Utah State, and six free agents -fullback. Bryan Bero of Utah, running back.s Curtis Stewart of Auburn and Brian Taylor of Oregon State, tight end James Coley of Clemson, wide receiver Tom Waddle of Boston College and linebacker Steve Hyche of Livingston. 
But Ditk.a said some of the rookies whowere waived might be named Tuesday to the six­man developmental squadmade up of first-year players. 
-
The latest round of cuts leaves nine rookies on the Bears regular season roster, including first-round draft pick.s, defensive end Trace Armstrong of Florida and cornerback. Donnell Woolford ofOemson. 
Other rookies nnak.ing the squad include linebacker John Roper, offensive linennen Dave Zawafson, Jerry Fontenot and Chris Dyk.o, safety Mark.us Paul, defensive linennan Tony Woods, and Notre Dante running back. Mark. Green, who will be assigned to running back. punts and k.ick.off returns on the special teams. 
Ditka said the Bears' special teanns nnust innprove substantially if the team is to be a contender. 
In Saturday's 41-38 pre­season win over the Los Angeles Raiders, Ditka said the special teams twice let the opposition reach the Bears' 35­yard line, putting added pressw"e on the defense. 
"I'nn not going to pull any punches," Ditka said. "We have to be good on special teams because it will have too nnuch of a bearing on what the pressure will be ... on our defense, and offense too."

Connors buries Edberg, while Lendl suiVives in five sets 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Ivan Lend!. the player of the 80s, showed why Monday night. 
Pushed to the limit by the attacking style of Andrei Chesnokov, the top-seeded Lend! called on all the power and guile that has made him dominant this decade, rallying to beat the 16th seed from the Soviet Union 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 at the U.S. Open. 
"If I look at it now," Lend! said, "there are a lot of moments I could have gone down. I'll take it anyway it comes. If I bury people, fine. If I win like today, that's fine too.' 
Lend!, a three-time winner here and a finalist every year since 1982, slugged it out on

But because Reveiz suffe"d a groin ~ury in the first week of training camp, Stoyanovich will be the Dolphins' kicker in their regular-.seuon opener Sunday agaln.st Buffalo. '1 just don't want people to think the job was handed to me because Fuad is hurt," Stoyanovich said. "It looks that way right now. I don't feel like I've proven myself yet. "All soon as I start banging a few through and earn a litue respect around here, I'll feel a lot better about myself."

the grandstand court with Chesnokov for 3 hours, 45 minutes. They matched powerful forehands and madly spinning backhands before Lendl's break in the seventh game of the final set was decisive. 
"He wasn't missing and I decided if I was going to go down, I was going down swinging," Lend! said. 
Lend!, 111-8 on hardcourts since 1986, made a stunning 73 unforced errors to 42 for the Soviet. In the end, Lend! had won only four more points than Chesnokov. 
"He was hitting back everything," said Lend!, who had swept his first three matches. "I was hitting crisply 
but always seemed to be 
missing the last shot. I had to 
fight it out in the end." 

Chesnokov had Lend! off­
balance for most of the match, 
often pinning Lend! well behind 
the baseline. But Lend! showed 
why he is a champion in the 
final set. 

"I felt I had the upper hand in the whole last set," he said. "He's so quick and he served well at important times. I was always fighting on his serve." 
Chesnokov, 23, would not call it the best match of his life. He did admit it was the most disappointing. 
"It's very hard to say" if he should have won, Chesnokov said. "My opinion is I had a little bit more chancP. to win 
this match than him. "I had a chance to beat Ivan today, a very good chance." 
While Lend! and Chesnokov were battling at the 6,000-seat grandstand, the 20,000-seat stadium was three-fourths empty for the first set of the match between Stefan Edberg and Jimmy Connors. 
"It was cold but not windy," Lend! said. "I didn't like it a bit. In the end, I was so aggressive, he couldn't keep up." 
Earlier, Tim Mayotte, finally feeling at home at the Open, moved into the quarterfinals for the first time, beating French Open champion Michael Chang. 
In a repeat of their fourth­round match at Wimbledon, Mayotte used his strong serve­and-volley tactics to overwhelm Chang. Mayotte, the ninth seed, fell behind 5-2 in the first set against the seventh -seeded 1 7­year-old. But he stayed aggressive and won 11 of the next 12 games.
