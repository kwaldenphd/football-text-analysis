ND welcomes stories of Cabrini Green 

By MARIBEL MOREY 
Assistant News Editor 
The invisible bubble that provides comfort, safety and a homogeneous culture at Notre Dame has no creator. but its presence is still visible. Students stroll down campus at two in the morning without the impending fear of robbery -or of being shot at 20 times simply because of their dorm or their major. 
The three former gang members and Father Bill Tomes who shared their experience with students at the CSC on Sunday afternoon have a different bubble in their inner-city Chicago neighborhood. 
"It's like having a wall around [Cabrini Green-]. There's an invisible wall and nobody comes in," said Tomes. 
These men are specifically from Cabrini Green, a housing project that accommodates generations after generations of impoverished families and is infamous for its gunfights. The three joined different gangs in their early teens. 
"We are gangster disciples. We had to shoot to get in and shoot to get out," said Darryl. a former gang member. "Some days we couldn't get to school." 
Cabrini Green seems to reach the sky in a myriad of dark floors, abandoned and wired public housing where people live in constant fear of violence. 
Upon graduating from the University of Notre Dame, Tomes began his mission to help end conflict in the Cabrini Green neighborhood. 
"( had a calling in [the Basilica] to work with peo­ple in conflict," said Tomes. 
The conflict between gangs in Cabrini Green has 110 definite creator, but the gunfights continue to defend territory, drugs and money among gangs. "Nobody's responsible for the gangs. A gang is just based on groups where one group does not like you," said Greg. 
The most popular groups are the Black Stones, KC, the Vice Lords and the Gangs of Disciples. 
"The purpose of the gang is for the protection of your neighborhood. They come in and shoot-they don't care who they're shooting at. It could be your mother or your sister," said Tron, a current gang member. "It's all about territory and drugs." 
Tron, unlike the other two former gang members, has three brothers in other gangs. "All four of us are in three different gangs. They're just my little broth­ers -I don't look at them as Vice Lords or Gangs of Disciples," he said while lowering his head and fid-

geting with a Notre Dame basketball poster. 
All living together, these four brothers might sit down for dinner, but they might face each other in gang conflicts. Greg, a former gang member, inter­jects, "but blood is thicker than water." 
Tron, Greg and Darryl did not purposefully join gangs to be a menace to society, they said. 
"I was accidentally shot so I went out for revenge," said Greg. School was also difficult for him because the schools were mixed with different gangs. There were two lunchrooms -one side for the opposition. "I was glad for the day to end and to be able to talk about it," he said.

Students organize 'Vagina' readings 
Observer Staff Report 

Following College president Marilou Eldred's announcement that student organizations could not officially sponsor a reading of The Vagina Monologues on campus, groups of students have been banding together to read the play on their own. 
One student reading of the controversial play will be held tonight at 8:30 p.m. in the Regina Dance Studio, The Observer learned Sunday evening. While the students who are doing the dramatic reading declined comment, several students on campus had learned of the reading late Sunday night. 
Twelve LeMans residents gathered in the Tower Room Sunday evening to read the play, said Le · Mans resident assistant Sarah Chaudoir. 
"We thought it was an important piece to be read," Chaudoir said. "[The reading] was to elimi­nate some of the mystery." 
College administrators prevented the play from being officially sponsored by any campus groups in late January, when College president Marilou Eldred told student organizers she would not allow the play on campus this year. The play first was performed at Saint Mary's last February, and drew two sold-out performances in Carroll Auditorium. 
Eldred's decision to cancel the play was based in the concern that it would draw more controversy than healthy discussion after members of the Parents Council, alumnae and the Board of Trustees expressed discontent with the play's pur­pose. The issues of lesbianism and explicit discus­sion of sexuality have caused some members of the Saint Mary's community to question its appropri­ateness for a Catholic campus. Since the decision, students have arranged a speak-out on the issue and protested with a sit-in in front of Eldred's office. 
The nationally acclaimed play, currently playing off-Broadway, is authored by Eve Ensler and addresses issues of women's sexuality. In particu­lar, the movement to perform the Monologues on college campuses is part of an effort that began three years ago to stop violence against women.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Voting for no one 
As a lifetime resident of Palm Beach County, r consider myself an expert on ballots and elec­tions in general. By unofficial count, there are about two dozen of us from Palm Beach County currently on campus, but even if all of us man­
aged to vote incorrectly (and I'm marginally sure I did it right), that doesn't come close to explaining why 55 people on this cam­pus didn't vote correctly in Thursday's student body election. 
For starters, 27 people abstained from voting in this election. That's right. 
27. There are 27 people on this campus who went to the trouble of showing their ID to an election official, taking a ballot, and then deciding to return it empty. Think about it. There are 27 
people at this University (11 in Dillon alone} who, when reflecting back upon Election Day, will proudly say to themselves, "I put a blank ballot into a ballot box, and therefore, I deliber­ately voted for no one." 
I'm guessing a handful of them were making a silent political protest, assuming that in the midst of counting the ballots, one election offi­cial would scream, "Mother of God, someone turned in a blank ballot! We need to reform our ways!" and then proceed to leap out a window. 
Of even more concern are the 28 people on this campus who turned in invalid ballots. This number doesn't include the relatively small number of write-in ballots -that is, those stu­dents felt too confined by the given choices, and therefore opted to write in the name of a cher­ished childhood pet. I don't even know how it's possible for someone to turn in an invalid bal­lot. An abstention, I can sort of understand, like maybe in all the excitement of voting, people just forgot to mark their candidate, or maybe their dorm's judicial board failed to provide adequate writing utensils. An invalid ballot in a runoff election, though, is pretty unsettling. 
For the 4,000 of you who didn't vote, let me briefly describe the ballot in question. It was small, blue, and featured two sets of names, each accompanied by a line wherein voters were expected to make an identifying mark indicating which of the two sets of names they preferred. Twenty-eight people failed to do this correctly. Twenty-eight of our classmates man­gled the voting process so horrifically that their ballot couldn't even be considered an absten­tion. 
I'm venturing a guess that some of these peo­

ple didn't want to hurt either candidate's feel­
ings and thus attempted to vote for everyone, 
though no rational explanation can justify vot­
ing for both parties in an election with only two 
candidates. At least the abstainers didn't waste 
any ink (unless they wrote, "I am leaving this 
blank in a silent political protest.") Voting for 
both people is something Archie Andrews does 
when he can't decide between Betty and 
Veronica for Miss Riverdale. Voting for both 
people shouldn't be happening at the university 
level. 
So, for the 55 of you who either forgot to 

mark down a selection or are too polite to par­
ticipate in democracy, take solace in the fact 
that you at least tried to vote. and that's all that 
matters. Four thousand students didn't vote at 
all, and in the long run. that's what ~orries me 
the most.

U. Virginia fraternity plans to go alcohol-free 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. 
About 35 University of Virginia men were selected last week to recolonize Phi Delta Theta fraternity, the first fraternity on Grounds to have alcohol­free housing. Although the new Phi Delt chapter is breaking the tradition of frat parties at the University, it is part of a nationwide trend in which fraternities are "going dry." 
The University's Phi Delta Theta chapter lost its charter last summer after allegedly refusing to adopt the national dry policy. Phi Delt's national policy states that all chapter facilities must be alcohol free. 
The old Phi Delt brothers continued as a fraternity after losing their char­ter and changed their name to Phi Delta Alpha.

Atty. gen. denies murder claims 
HANOVER, N.H. 
The state attorney general's office Friday afternoon denied claims that the murders of Susanne and Half Zantops resulted from an affair Half Zantop had with an unidentified woman. Under the headline, "Love affair eyed in N.H. killings," the Boston Globe Friday reported, "Investigators believe the killings of Dartmouth College professors Half and Susanne Zantop were crimes of pas­sion. most likely resulting from an adulterous love affair involving Half Zantop." However, in the press release Friday, New Hampshire Attorney General Philip McLaughlin said, "Investigators do not hold the belief attributed to them in the Globe story." The Globe attrib­uted the information to anonymous "authorities close to the case." In response to this, McLaughlin said, "No responsible and knowledgeable law enforcement official would provide the Globe with the information it attrib­uted to official anonymous sources." In response, Globe Editor Matthew Storin told The Dartmouth, "We're very comfortable with our story... We stand by our story."

But the two groups could not reach a compromise, and the original Phi Delta Theta members broke off from their national organization. 
"We felt. as the alumni did, that if you are 21 and want to drink respon­sibly, you should be able to do so in your own home," Abendroth said.

UNIVERSITY OF ILLIN0IS 
Legislation limits women at frats 
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 

In a move the University of Illinois Panhellenic Council believes will further ensure the protection of sorority members and reduce liability, the council passed legisla­ture earlier this month known as the "Alcohol Free Resolution," which will take effect at the beginning of the fall 2001 semester. The new legislation includes a clause restricting the number of sorority members who may attend a social event at a fraternity house where alcohol is present. The resolution allows for only one­third of the sorority chapter membership to attend fra­ternity events at fraternity houses. Laura Kuhn, junior in communications and vice president of public relations for the Panhellenic Council, said the new resolution is an extension of "Alcohol Free 2000," an act that prohibited sororities from co-sponsoring events at fraternity houses when alcohol is present. Kolusis guidelines, which regu­late the activities attended by fraternity and sorority members, already have in place rules outlining how events are to be run and classified. 
week. 
Among fraternities at the University, the national organizers of Phi Kappa Sigma and Delta Sigma Phi adopted alcohol-free policies in July and December, respectively. Theta Chi expects to go dry nationally by 2003 and Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji) will recolonize as an alcohol-free house in the 2002-2003 school year. 
About 1,500 of 5,300 houses in the North American Interfraternity Conference, an umbrella organization for 68 fraternities nationwide, have gone dry. Only 300 had gone dry a few years ago, The Washington Post reported in December. 
Fraternities adopting alcohol-free policies is a "trend we've seen increasing," Inter-Fraternity Council president Justin Saunders said.

Young's second lecture discusses violence

cussing an essay by H a n n a h Arendt on the nature of violence and power. 
"Power requires communi­cation. Violence is mute," Young said. 
Young discussed that the commonly held idea of power, command and obedience is not really power. True power requires the consent of the people. Violence, on the other hand, usually weakens the true consent of the people. 
"The use of violence in poli­tics always endangers power," Young said. 
Young used the background on power and violence lay down by Arendt to criticize official violence -"the use of 
the duties of the state is acceptable," Young said. "I challenge this." 
Young encouraged a retro­spective analysis of the use of official violence. She held that the only way to decide whether a violent act was jus­tified was to look at its conse­quences. 
Violence must be justified case by case through appeals to their consequences -pre­vention of a greater harm. Young said the effects of the violence must be "immediate 
and contained." 
Young said 
"I believe

dangerous," said Young. 
Young also criticized the use of military force for the preservation of human rights. Again, she believed the acts of violence caused by, the mil­itary in these cases are not justified by default, but need to be examined on a case by case basis. 
Following this background, the colloquium was opened for discussion. Young came to Saint Mary's as part of the Women in the Philosophical Landscape Lecture Series. She also spoke Thursday night in Stapleton Lounge on self-sufficiency, autonomy, and welfare justice.

Election 
continued from page 1 
However, on appeal the Student Senate reduced the penalty to one day. 
Allowing candidates to begin campaigning as soon as they turned in their petition also meant that the campaign peri­od increased from 10 days to three weeks. Norton said she is unsure if the three-week peri­od represented an improve­ment. 
"I would like to research whether it was better for the student body to have the longer campaign," Norton said, adding that she feared stu­dents felt "saturated" with posters. 
"Students aren't paying attention three weeks before the election. They just don't care," said Ryan Becker, who lost to Norton in the runoff election last Thursday. 
Student government may look into shortening the cam­paign to two weeks, according to Norton, a length Becker also recommended. 
One significant improvement under the new rules, according to Bauters, was the newly cre­ated Executive Committee to oversee violations hearings. The full Election Committee, made up of one representative from each residence hall, elected four of its members to serve on the Executive Committee. Bauters and Wagner then appointed two additional council members to the committee. 
Committee members -Anne Traynor of Cavanaugh, Son Nguyen of Carroll, Paul Ybarra of Dillon, Michelle Bottitta of Farley, Alyse Latour of Pangborn and Eric Hedin of Stanford-never actually had to hold a violations hearing this year, but Bauters said he was able to delegate other election responsibilities to the six committee members. For example, one member was responsible for voting by stu­dents studying abroad, while others organized the debates. 
"Tony and I are very grate­
ful for their hard work and 
commitment." said Bauters, 
adding that another student. 
Carolyn Allen. volunteered to 
help the committee and also 
played an important role in its 
functions. 

One minor drawback of not having any campaign viola­tions was that the Judicial Council was not able to deter­mine the effectiveness of the new hearing structure cen­tered on the Executive Committee, Wagner said. However. he is confident that the system would have func­tioned well. 
"We have a lot of faith that it will work in the long run," he said. 
Another improved rule was the one allowing candidates to campaign on election day, loved to call me at 1:30 in the morning. After 2, he would leave me silent messages. I would have five voice mails when I woke up in the morn­ing," said Bauters, who gave a great deal of credit to the dedi­cation and caliber of the can­didates themselves. 
"I think the changes were the candidates. The candidates this year were just superior this year to anything Notre Dame has ever had," Bauters said. 
Similarly, Wagner said that

Candidates and their sup­porters were also allowed to use e-mail, a previously forbid­den campaign tool. 
In fact, last year the Election Committee forfeited the ticket of Hunt Hanover and John Micek during the runoff elec­tion after Hanover sent e-mails to students in Alumni and Breen-Phillips Halls. 
Beyond changes in campaign and election procedures, a combination of factors made this election run better than last year's, according to the people involved in the election. 
"Overall, I think it was very successful. I'm not sure how much I would attribute that to the rules changes alone," Wagner said. "A lot of credit goes to John and the Election Committee." 
Norton and Becker similarly praised Bauters and the Judicial Council for making the election run smoothly. 
"I think the Judicial Council did a better job this year. I think they did a flawless job," said Becker. He espe­cially credited Bauters for always being available to help candidates.

kind to each 
other. That set the tone for how the elec­tion went," Wagner said. 
Although the election went well this year, Bauters won­ders if most students even noticed. 
"Last year, everyone made a big stink ... because it was such a mess," Bauters said, adding that many students expressed the opinion that student government was "terrible" after last year's election. 
"This year it went well and no one recognized that student government worked this year," Bauters added. 
While he said the election was significantly better than last year, Bauters believes the Judicial Council should consider altering certain rules. 
Bauters does not plan to push for any other rules changes during the rest of his time in his current posi­tion. Before leaving office on April 1, Bauters also has to oversee other elections. such as for class officers, and so will not have time to push for other changes. He will, however, write a transitional report to whomever takes over his position, though he does not know exactly what that report will contain. 
"There are still changes that need to be made," he said. "The rule on hall and club endorsements needs to be reconsidered. I don't think we should censor dorms and clubs." 
Currently, although campus news media can endorse can­didates, other student organi­zations or residence halls can­not. Bauters added that the campus media does not always realize how they can harm candidates. In particular, he mentioned one article in The Observer that some candidates felt unfairly portrayed them either as feminists or as less capable of addressing female issues on campus. 
One potential problem in this year's election occurred when candidate Demetra Smith, who finished third in the primary debate, decided to endorse the ticket of Norton and Brian Moscona in the runoff election with Becker and his running mate Nikki McCord. 
"There was some confusion about it because we weren't sure of the process," Smith said. She talked to both Wagner and Bauters to make sure it was okay for her to make the endorsement. 
Bauters said he was con­cerned Smith did not under­stand the "potential political risk to her" in making the endorsement. If Becker and running mate Nikki McCord were disqualified from the runoff election. then the next highest primary vote getters ­Smith and her running mate Andre Yogeld -would have been in the runoff against Norton and Brian Moscona. 
In other words, Bauter said, Smith would have been run­ning against a candidate she endorsed. However, he added that no rule prevented Smith from making an endorsement. 
Smith's endorsement first appeared on the Web site www.ndtodav.com. Other can­didates who ·did not make the runoff, were upset because they felt they did not have the opportunity to make an endorsement. However, Becker said he doubts such endorse­ments would have effected the result of the runoff vote.

Gangs were groups of friends that supported each other. By being with his friend, Darryl became part of the gang. "They were chasing me when I was with him, so I just joined," he said. 
Darryl has moved away from Cabrini Green with his family. "My dream is made -I don't have to steal for money, my life is better and my kids are being raised well," he said. "The only thing that will lead me back to gang-banging is if someone does something to my family or my guys." 
Just walking outside on the streets near their neigh­members' faith in God. "Gang members pray a lot because of the possibility of being killed. You should see how sincerely they pray." Tomes puts his life on the line every day in Cabrini Green. and the neighborhood respects him, including these three men. 
Even though Greg and Darryl already got out of the gangs, they still want to see change in the neighborhood. 
"Open up youth centers. Give kids something to do after school. If not, they see the rich guys on the corner with drugs and jewelry," Darryl said. "Give them something to do after school that is fun because if not they won't come back."

However, Tron said that it wasn't hard for him to get a job because he hadn't been to jail like most of his friends. "It's changed now, you used to not be able to get a job," said Tomes. 
Their decisions to join gangs years ago affected many other people. "I got tired of the expression on my mother's face every time she would come and get me out of jail," Greg said.

E-mail outage disrupts campus: The tech­nology-dependent Notre Dame community faced a challenge as e-mail was unavailable from Friday afternoon to Saturday morning. 
"It's always a bad thing to be off the air for 13 hours, but those things do happen," said Larry Rapagnani, assistant provost for computing. 
A hardware failure on the email server caused the problem. The disruption was unrelated to previous Internet problems that were caused by service provided from Ameritech. 
"Big computers have hardware failures, just like little computers," said Rapagnani. 
Technicians worked through the night to fix the email server. Other technology, such as the Internet and I-I and I drives were not affected. 
"We're hopeful that it won't happen again," said Rapagnani.

DAYfONA BEACH, Fla. 

Dale Earnhardt, one of the greatest stars in auto racing his­tory, died Sunday from injuries in a last-lap crash at the Daytona 500. 
The seven-time Winston Cup champion had to be cut out of his car after slamming into the wall on the final turn of the race while fighting for position. He was taken to the hospital accompanied by his son. Dale Jr., a young NASCAR star who finished second in the race. 
"This is understandably the toughest announcement I've ever had to make. We've lost Dale Earnhardt," NASCAR pres­ident Mike Helton said. 
Earnhardt died instantly of head injuries, said Steve Bohannon, a doctor at Halifax Medical Center. 
"There was nothing that could have been done for him," he said. 
The death comes at a time that driver safety issues were under increased scrutiny. Three NASCAR drivers were killed in wrecks last season. 
The accident happened a half­mile from the finish of the NASCAR season-opener. won by 
Michael Waltrip. 

Earnhardt, running fourth, grazed Sterling Marlin's car, crashed into the wall at the high-banked fourth turn going about 180 mph, and was smacked hard by Ken Schrader. 
Earnhardt's death was the biggest blow to auto racing since three-time Formula One cham­pion Ayrton Senna was killed in the San Marino Grand Prix in Imola, Italy, in 1994. 
Neil Bonnett. one of Earnhardt's best friends, was killed that same year in practice for the Daytona 500. Rodney Orr died in a wreck three days later, also in practice, and was the last driver killed at the track until Earnhardt's accident. 
"NASCAR has lost its greatest driver ever, and I personally have lost a great friend," NASCAR chairman Bill France Jr. said. 
It was the second major wreck in five years in the race for Earnhardt, a driver known for his aggressiveness on the track. He flipped wildly on the back­stretch near the end of the race in 1997 hut was not seriously hurt. He came back to win the race the next year on his 20th try. 
Earnhardt is the leader among active Winston Cup drivers with 76 career victories. He also had the most victories at Daytona International Speedway, 34. 
The death made Waltrip's vic­tory virtually meaningless, as drivers mourned one of their greatest stars. 
"My hEiart is hurting right now," Waltrip said before news of Earnhardt's death was announced. "I would rather be any place right this moment than here. It's so painful." 
Earnhardt was doing what he does best throughout the race, being th,e crowd favorite and bumping other cars for position. 
He was a factor throughout, and spent the final laps close to his son and Waltrip, trying to block Marlin. Marlin had just passed Earnhardt, who was try­ing to get back by him on the low side of the track when there was slight contact that sent his Chevrolet spinning up the bank­ing. 
It turned to the right and hit the wall, and Schrader could not avoid hitting Earnhardt's car. Both cars slowly began to slide down to the bottom of the track as the rest ofthe field raced by. 
Earnhardt Jr. quickly left the postrace celebration for Waltrip, and sprinted to the infield care

In the Kuk Dong factory in southern Mexico, workers are struggling for recog­nition of an independent union. Since Kuk Dong produces apparel for Nike and many universities, their struggle strikes at the heart ofthe sweatshop issue and the upcoming Notre Dame decision on whether we should join the Worker Rights Consortium. 
The workers' dis­content grew from their poor working conditions, including forced over-time, rotten cafeteria food, low wages and verbal and physical abuse. Due to these conditions, workers decided that they needed to replace their union. Their union was affiliated with the PRI, a con­servative party that had ruled Mexico for the past 60 years and it was failing to act. Government and company unions are often the only one that exists at colle­giate apparel factories. These unions are imposed from above. They are undemoc­ratic and they care little for their work­ers' rights. If workers are to achieve jus­tice, they need not only the right to orga­nize. but also the ability to create a democratic union without intimidation. 
As often happens in labor struggles, the company fired the principal organiz­ers at Kuk Dong to set an example. This caused the workers to rebel and go on strike. The company got the police to crackdown on the strikers and two work­ers were hospitalized due to police vio­lence. Next, thinking it had defeated the workers' campaign, the company invited the workers back to the factory. However. when workers tried to return they were told they had to pledge alle­giance to the government union. Some workers agreed, but several hundred workers refused. Of the workers that refused, some were forced to resign, some have found new jobs and others 

are still waiting for justice. 
This labor unrest might come as a sur­prise to anyone who had read the March 2000 monitoring report by Pricewaterhouse Coopers. It stated that the Kuk Dong management "has estab­lished relations with employees that were both flexible and transparent" and "workers felt that they could air their grievances in a fair and effective way." However, if workers get beat-up for striking by representatives of the state, are they going to tell the truth to a repre­sentative from an outside multinational accounting company who drops by for a couple days? This shows that monitoring should be done purely by local non-gov­ernmental organizations with a year­around presence that workers can trust. 
The most immediate and strongest reactions to the situation at Kuk Dong, have come from United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS) and the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC). Students at dozens of campuses have distributed leaflets, rallied and successfully urged their president to write Nike a letter expressing their concern. The WRC responded by sending a six-person dele­gation to investigate and interview work­ers. It quickly released an initial monitor­ing report finding that there are "strong grounds for concern that Kuk Dong may stand in violation of provisions of [univer­sity} codes of conduct governing child labor, physical and verbal abuse, pay­ment of minimum or living wages and free association." 
What distinguishes the struggle at Kuk Dong from hundreds of sweatshop strug­gles in previous years, is the public atten­tion that this issue has received. This story was initially able to get out to stu­dents, who then mobilized in support of the Kuk Dong workers. Student activism provided this issue with wider media cov­erage, including an article in the New York Times. Now that it is under the public eye, Nike shows no sign of cutting and running -and the workers have a fair chance at getting back their jobs and forming an independent union. 
By observing these events, it becomes clear that the only reason the workers stand a chance is because this issue has been transparent since their struggle began. This is the first time the WRC has monitored a factory and the advantages of its public disclosure of monitoring results are now evident. 
The anti-sweatshop movement requires public disclosure of working conditions and monitoring reports. If we did not have public disclosure, then sweatshops would be relegated to the internal responsibility of private organi­zations Oike the Fair Labor Association or Notre Dame), instead of being the public responsibility of all consumers and workers. It is the latter group who has fought sweatshops for over a hundred years and to shut them out of the strug­gle now would be a terrible mistake. It is only by having Notre Dame join the WRC that we can guarantee this disclosure. 
While Kuk Dong does not produce any apparel for Notre Dame, there is no rea­son to believe that our factories are any better. Kuk Dong is important because the anti-sweatshop movement is not about making sure that just one school (or corporation) can claim their apparel is "sweat-free." Instead, the movement's goal is to improve the conditions of all workers, starting with the collegiate apparel industry. As one school, Notre Dame has power over factories produc­ing our goods, however by joining the Worker Rights Consortium that power can be multiplied many times. We should join with the 71 schools that belong to the WRC. We can assist worker struggles at Kuk Dong's around the world by breaking the veil of secrecy that permits sweatshops to exist, through implement­ing disclo·sure.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Dangers of focusing 
on clothes 

Just when I thought I'd seen it all. yesterday's Viewpoint laughed in 
my face. I didn't think anything could top the shock of witnessing a "pre­
miere" university masquerade a blatant act of censorship behind a mask 
of religious devotion, but one Domer stepped up to the challenge. I am 
compelled to respond to Sheila Payne's article from the Feb. 14 issue of 
The Observer, not because ofmy disdain for her opinions, but because 
the implications in her letter are despicable and dangerous. 
"Do your clothes say 'I respect myself and am proud to look so nice' or 
do they say 'I want to seduce you'? 
Do you really want to say that? 
Do you think it's right to say that? 
Aro you prepared for the answer?" 
I only hope that Payne was oblivious to the implications in her conclud­
ing sentiments. She is preying on one of the most painful questions a 
woman faces when she has been raped. Rape victims feel an incredible 
amount of guilt and shame because of ideas like those expressed in 
Payne's article; ideas that suggest the length of a woman's skirt deter­
mines her right to say no to sex. I have no doubt that the letter was writ­
ten with the best of intentions, but that only shows how deeply ingrained 
these negative attitudes are. If you truly want to help women feel confi­
dent and self-assured, this is not the way. The belief that a woman must 
expect to be harassed or violated because of the way she dresses perpet­
uates a vicious cycle of violence. It also perpetuates the guilt and stigma­
tism that make a devastating situation even harder to overcome.

Reviving a.Lenten tradition 
Think about reviving the ancient Christian tradition of abstaining from meat consumption during Lent. We respectfully invite all Christians to use VDLENT2001 as a period of reflection and prayer for all the innocent creatures currently condemned to the slaughterhouse and/or factory-farm. 
God willing VDLENT2001 will help you make a permanent switch to a healthy and compassionate meat-free diet. Try it. You'll be amazed by the physical and spiritual benefits. 
As a contemporary adaptation of an ancient tradition, we respectfully invite each participant to adopt a vegetari!l,n diet for each and every day between Ash Wednesday (Feb. 28) and Easter Sunday (April 15). 
Lent is a sacred and spiritual period for Christians the world over. Lent not only reminds us of Christ's undying love, but helps us to empathize more closely with His sacrifice too. Greater empathy with Christ, gained during the Lenten period. allows us to be more receptive to the needs of our neighbor. As Christ taught us our neighbor is s/he who suffers. Are there any that suffer more than those condemned to the slaughterhouse? Lent provides a perfect opportunity for us Christians to reflect on the plight of our defenseless neighbors; especial­ly our neighbors condemned to face the indignity and horror of the slaughterhouse. 
A vegetarian diet for Lent -simply an experiential opportunity or perhaps even a transitional period. It's your choice. Try it. You won't regret it.

Smoke gets in your eyes -or does it? 
AMES, lowa 

It :is a sweet irony that Big Tobacco is paying $1.5 billion through 2003 for the American Legacy Foundation to air public service announcements slagging it off daily. It's turn­about and that has legally been determined to be fair play. According to Dr. Cheryl Healton, the

foundation's president and chief executive officer, these commercials repre­

Daily

corporate tobacco's "feel good, corporate citizen" image. 
"It is intended to he a wake-up call to America about the fact that 500,000 people die prematurely a year due to tobacco use in America -50,000 of those die from the tobac­co use of others," said Healton in a CNN inter­view. "Corporate citizen notwithstanding, a heck of a lot of Americans are dying prema­turely due to this product." 
Simply speaking, it is a 

propaganda campaign to combat the propaganda campaign of an industry with very deep pockets. 
Irony is nothing new to those of us addicted to tobaeco who routinely try to quit. You know the people I'm talking about. They smoke for 20 years and then kick it for two weeks and suddenly they are anti-smoking zealots. My grandmother had been smoking since Taft was president. One week, her pastor talked her into quitting and suddenly anyone who sat in her nicoiine-stained kitchen got an earful about how bad smoking was for you. 
As an on-again, off­again smoker since I was 18, l know full well what a h)1>ocrite I can be. I can ,:moke a pack a day for tvvo years, quit for one 31ear and rail against the system that got me hooked. Then one night at a bar I light up "just one.·· 
Next day I go back on the wagon for three mon1hs before I fall off for another year and a half. One long smoking binge is followed by a period ofalmost monas­tic abstinence and the end result is I've got more personalities living inside me than Robert Dmvney Jr., Gary Oldman and Sybil combined. 
They are merging, however. I don't flip-flop as much as I used to because nowadays, even 

ten to the miserable point where I don't · remember what I ever liked about smoking: I get the jones real bad and get my fix and rarely does it even feel good. 
I don't want to smoke, but it is so easy to get hooked and re-hooked, time and again. I can­not be one of these brash, proud-to-be-inhalin' smokers who talks about lighting up as though it were a right of birth. 
ThE1 fact is, those anti-smoking commercials, though heavy on the propaganda, are essential­ly correct. Only 20 years ago, they would have been laughable. Today they are well-received. 
We all accept that smoking is bad and if a heavy dose of intensely emotional imagery will keep kids from making the same mistake many of us made in our younger days then that's great. If the tobacco companies have to pay for it -all the better. 
Joe Camel may be the most insidious of all tobacco company creations. This loveable car­toon character has little appeal to adults. He was always there to make sure children learned brand recognition well before they were legally able to smoke. 
I know when I went out to buy my first pack of smokes to irritate my roommate, I looked at the many brands in the cigarette machine in the USAC laundry within easy reach of the playground and Ijust knew Marlboro was the brand I wanted. Reds, just like the cowboy whose face graced so many billboards back home you couldn't cross the Missouri in any direction on any bridge without seeing his weather-worn face and appreciating his rugged individualism.

died oflung cancer. a fact not widely known until the American Legacy Foundation began run­ning commercials featur­ing the cowboy's brother -a man whose piece was long overdue for air­ing. 
I guess there is a fine 
line between rugged indi­
vidualism and fatalism. 
Smokers are not an 
oppressed subclass. but 
their numbers -our 
numbers -are dwin­
dling. I for one cannot 
wait until the day when it 
is as unnecessary to post 
"no smoking" signs in 
restaurants as it is to post 
"no spitting" signs. 
At this rate, public 
smoking bans will be 
unnecessary in five years. 
In fact, public bans will be 
the one thing that will 
keep people defiantly 
putllng themselves to 
death. Prohibition not 
only did nothing to stop 
Americans from drinking, 
it fueled a criminal sub­
culture that still exists in 
America. 
Cities need to relax and 
wait for the inevitable 
because nothing prolongs 
the inevitable like resis­
tance. I know I need to 
quit. Every smoker in the 
United States knows they 
need to quit. But the deci­
sion must be one of free 
choice. We already have 
the effective propaganda 
machine rolling; let's 
leave the brown shirt tac­
tics of public banning to 
less sophisticated states 

I may seem torn, sometimes I feel like it. But wanting to see the tobacco companies run aground while not wanting to see public smok­ing bans take effect are two ideas I am comfort­able holding at the same time. 
Be patient. It will happen naturally. Slowly, but naturally.

Call me out of town! l got my ticket and I used it. So here we are, 36 kids who don't really know each other, 36 kids alone together, here in France. Soon, we'll be calling Angers home; right now, we're working on its pronunciation. I've never been; I hope it's nice,,

his. A proud smile on my face, I responded in a language other than my own, "Je suis tres excitee!" Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the problems of literal translation. "I am very excited!" earned me my first dirty look as a foreign­er, for what I learned just a few moments later was that this French phrase is often used to describe a completely different kind of "excited." 
6 October 2000 -Day 32 
Travel tip: If the woman at the desk smiles at you and says, "Here's the key to your room. Good luck!" don't trust her. Find somewhere else to stay. 
We had what is now the oh-so-infamous "Charnbre Huit," a room found only by following some rather frighteningly simple arrows with sloppy handwriting and concealed by an out-of-place opaque shower door in the middle of the hallway. We had the doctor from Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" as a neighbor downstairs on the left and some dental torture instruments in the room on the right. As good as a sleeping pill -as you can imagine -among the sounds of eerie music coming from downstairs and drilling coming from the evil den­tist's crypt next door. The television's refusal to be turned off was very calming as well. 
2 November 2000 -Day 59 
Italian thieves tick me off. Four naive American girls combined with a stench. kept dense and putrid by the tight area of a not-so-spacious couchette, makes for quite the travel legend. The origin of the smell made his presence known when he emerged from under Katy's bed. While we screamed, he smiled, as if to say, "Screw you all, you silly girls. I'm here; I smell; you're scared, so I'm in control," until he realized that screaming could bring the police, and that could land him behind some bars -and we ain't talkin' chianti wine! 
9 February 2001 -Day 158 
Today I was spanked by a large Hungarian woman, and I liked it! The baths in Budapest are famous for the wide range of treatments available, ranging from mud to thermal. and for the variety of naked bodies. If you have an ounce of modesty in your body, it is guaranteed to be gone by the time you leave, whether because of the fact that you and everyone remotely close to you is naked, or because the woman giving you the full-body massage seems to be enjoying it almost as much as you are. Large women throw around their weight, and there isn't an inhibition in the place. It's a beautiful, beautiful thing.

From Vikings to Freud: The College of Arts and Letters 

By JACQUELINE BROWDER 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Does the thought of dissection make you sick? Not wild about accounting? As a child, did you have trouble creating a sturdy structure with your Lincoln Logs? Have no fear -the College of Arts and Letters may be just what you're looking for. 
The College of Arts and Letters is the oldest and largest unit of the University of Notre Dame, embracing the humanities, the social sci­ences and the fine and performing arts. Approximately 2,500 undergraduates and 750 graduate students are enrolled in its degree programs, organized into 18 departments and the Medieval Institute. 
It's been said that you can't underestimate the value of a good liberal arts education. Arts and Letters Dean Mark Roche affirms. "These disci­plines are both ends in themselves and useful in teaching students the formal skills that will be applicable beyond their specific discipline. We explore the complex structures of the contem­porary self and contemporary society -its organization, efficiencies and political struc­tures." 
The College of Arts and Letters allows stu­dents to explore their creative capacities, whether though creative thinking. dramatic performance or through critical analysis of a text. The areas of study are extensive and class­es are often crosslisted to allow students to take classes in the college, but outside their major. 
However, creative thinking doesn't always equal big bucks in the post-graduate world. Many Arts and Letters majors nearing gradua­tion fear that a more "practical" major would give them an edge in a working environment. Roche disagrees. "Notre Dame liberal arts majors have found challenging employment at Fortune 500 companies, prestigious consulting firms and financial service giants. 
"What they may lack in nuts and bolts of busi­ness, they compensate for with their ability to draw on a breadth of general knowledge, to think creatively and communicate effectively and to adjust to evolving or unexpected circum­stances." 
Notre Dame's College of Arts and Letters gives students the opportunity to think creatively by offering a tremendous amount of variety in its 
~~~ 
~=­

classes. Here are just a few of the college's offerings. 
rnterested in the Vikings? Take HIST 240. Feel like royalty? Try HIST 241, "Caesars Emperors and Czars." Did Valentine's Day get you in the mood for romance? There's an English class dedicated to "Love in the Middle Ages" (ENG 335). For future ESPN sportscast­ers, the Film, Television and Theater depart­ment offers a class in Broadcast Journalism (FTT 308). Notre Dame may not condone frater­nities and sororities on campus, but you can learn about the Greeks in CLAS 450, "Greek and Roman Mythology." 
Want to know more about political theory. foreign policy or the motives behind the Cold War? You might want to take a few Government courses. Or you can learn about the "Anthropology of Reproduction"(GSC 448) -if you're curjous about that sort of thing ­through the Gender Studies Department. You can even channel the musician inside and learn to play jazz guitar (MUS 213}. 
For future lawyers or, possibly, future con­victs. the Sociology department offers a class in Criminology. Or you could get out your broom­stick and take "Witchcraft and Occult" (ANnl 
418) through the Anthropology department. For those contemplating their weekend's activities, the Theology department offers a class entitled, "Sin and Redemption" (THEO 225). 
Thinking existentially? Take PHIL 222. Oedipus complex? You can work on that in Abnormal Psychology (PSY 354). Or you can impress people at parties with your vast knowl­edge of books if you're a PLS major. You can even crosslist yourself into the business world and take an Economics course. 
Throw pots in a ceramics class (ARST 210) or learn Japanese and figure out what Pokemon is all about. Or, through the American Studies department, you can "Witness the Sixties"(AMST340) and find out what your par­ents were up to in their youth. 
The College of Arts and Letters offers a multi­tude of diverse courses, encouraging students to think creatively and comprehensively in several areas of study. Whether business, law school or post-graduate study calls, "[Arts and Letters students) have learned the basic skills that are requisite for success in any enterprise," says Roche. "They learn to think on their feet and out of the box."

ONE PERSON'S VIEW 
Reniembering a friend 
My freshman year I made a friend. 
He was a nice kid. a quiet guy who worked hard and lent me his pillow for a while on a long van ride lo Tennessee the day we met on our way to an Appalachia Seminar. 
He had grown up with his mother on a reserva­tion in New Mexico, a long way from snowy South Bend. And New Mexico was where he wanted to return. after he became a doctor. He was going to go back to his reservation and help his people overcome the heart disease that plagues so many Native American communities. 
Sophomore year he was gone.

Center. He said he was leaving Notre Dame. He was going back home, not yet a doctor. He said he might join the army, but he was not sure. And he's never been back. 
He tried hard, but my friend could not make the adjustment to Notre Dame. The gap between where he was from and where he was at had been too great. 
And the numbers show he was not alone. 
Native American students leave Notre Dame at a higher percentage than any other group on this campus. There are many causes for this, from cultural and religious differences to academic challenges to financial limitations, but we should do more to prevent it. 
The University has made an admirable 
commitment to provide financial aid to stu­
dents from the Potawatomi Indian tribe, who 
originally lived on the land that we call Notre 
Dame. And the Admissions Office's attempts 
to individually recruit students who live on 
reservations shows an honest desire to pro­
vide Native Americans with access to educa­
tion. Once they get here, the efforts of us all 
need to be just as committed. 
It is difficult for the administration to build 
a community of Native American students 
when there are so few, and their experiences 
are so diffuse. There is little a University can

Worshiping in their own way 
. Native Americans try to make their beliefs understood on a Catholic campus 
By KIFLIN TURNER 
In Focus Wricer · 
Filbert Begay came to Notre Dame without ever having opened the Bible. 
The sophomore member of the Navajo tribe had been exposed to Christianity, but his little experi­ence with the faith was not enough to prepare him for the devout Catholicism of most Notre Dame students. Begay recalled his theol­ogy class as a particular challenge. It was difficult for him to under­stand Biblical interpretations and figures. 
"I was exposed to Christianity 
back home, but not as much as 
everyone here. and that was a new 
experience," Begay said. "Corning 
from my cultural background, a lot 
of the students here are really 
Christianized." 
Catholicism and Native American 
spiritual beliefs diverge in many 
ways, and students who came to 
Notre Dame from reservation life 
often are forced to wrestle with 
these conflicts. 
"It's a really tough way -a 
meshing of ideas, Catholicism and 
then the traditional views with the 
environment and [the Native 
American} relationship with the 
rest of the world," said freshman 
Joey Shonkwiler, who is both 
Cherokee and Italian. · 

Begay receives mixed reactions when he discusses his spiritual beliefs. His faith is not based on one god, but on many deities found throughout nature. 
"It's not the same as Christianity where there's one god," he said. "We have numerous deities, none of them are higher than the other, nor lower than the other, so there's no hierar­
chical standpoint

interdependence. He equally respects all parts of the natural world -from animals to heavenly objects -and invisible supernat­ural deities. 
"They all play a significant role in the cosmos and life," he said. 
Begay also had to find a way to worship. He recalled feeling self­conscious when he would pray in the Grotto in his own, unique way. 
"I tried praying in my way, but people look at me weird, They were like, 'who the heck are you praying to?'" he said. "I usually pray early in the morning when ~o one is around, so that no one will see me." 
Another incident that made a 
distinct impression on Begay's 
experience with religion at Notre 
Dame was a retreat he attended 
freshman year. As the participants

Discussing religion is a touchy topic for many Native Ameri~an students. But instead of takrng criticism negatively. junior Laura Mike, a Navajo, turns potential conflicts into a learning process. 
"I try to think of that maybe their values aren't as strong or maybe they're not receiving the whole picture or maybe I don't even understand my own faith, and that's why when I explain it, it might not seem clear," she said. "That's when I try to learn more about what my life is about and our religion as a whole." 
Still, the rejection of her beliefs is painful, Mike said, as it is in essence a rejection of her N alive American culture and ancestry.

she said. "But I guess it hurts me

might be difficult to adjust to Notre Dame life.

Shakespeare's 'The Winter's Tale' to warm N<)tre Dame 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS 
Scene Writer 
What do London, England and Notre Dame have in common? Well, they're both cold, both have bland food, and both have some of the most innovative and inspirational theater in the world. 
The Actors From The London Stage arrived on campus Saturday evening. Originally conceived by Homer "Murph" Swander in 1975 as a way to better teach theater and Shakespeare to American drama students through short teaching sessions, the Actors from the London Stage program has grown from impromptu question and answer sessions into a for­midable touring theater program. 
The company consists of about five actors from notable theater companies in London such as The Royal Shakespeare Company and The Royal National Theatre of Great Britain. The actors perform with minimal props and costumes and travel by car to American universities from their base of operations. Notre Dame has recently become the host university of the company. 
However, this is not Notre Dame's first brush with the program. The Actors from the London Stage have visited the University seven times before. During their most recent visit last 
semester, they performed The Winter's Tale

IRISH INSIGHT 
The terse replies and gloomy 
looks of the Irish players following 
Sunday's loss to Seton Hall didn't 
match the upbeat message com­
ing from their mouths. 
David Graves, Matt Carroll. 
Troy Murphy 
and Ryan 
Humphrey 
talked about 
controlling 
their own fate 
in the race for 
a regular sea­
son Big East 
title. They 
pointed to 
their first­
place stand­
ings in the Big 
East West 
Division. They 
said that losses 
happen. 
Let's hope they were listening to their words, not their body lan­guage. 
Murphy appeared as comfort­able as someone about to undergo a root canal. The nonnally chatty junior was lucky to string together an "I don't know -they had depth" as to what Seton Hall did and "yeah, I did" when asked if he took offense to Darius Lane dunk­ing at game's end with the win already in hand. After the post­game press conference, the All­American slipped out the door faster than an Andre Barrett drive. 
Murphy, who did everything possible to secure the win ­except hit his free throws -with 16 board-crashing rebounds and 24 points, had good reason to be upset by his team's loss. Notre Dame's 32 percent shooting per­centage, including two for 23 from behind the arc, brought the Irish eight-game winning streak to a skidding halt. 
But more important than the game Notre Dame lost Sunday are the eight they won before that. All teams lose. and winning eight out of the last nine is far better than most NCAA Tournament-bound schools can claim to have done. 
As Carroll said, "We've got a game or two lead. It's still our league, and we're going to think ofit that way." 
The Irish are still two games ahead of both Georgetown and Syracuse in the Big East West. The top two teams in each divi­sion earning a first-round bye in the Big East Tourn-ament, and with just four games remaining, it would take a total collapse by Notre Dame to drop beyond the top two. 
So the Irish lost. 


Life will go on 
Big deal. Every team -yes, every team -in the top 25 has lost at least once since Jan. 13, the last time Notre 
Dame lost before Sunday. 15 of those best-in-the­nation schools lost last week, five of them mul­tiple times. 
Sixth-ranked Kansus lost twice, at Baylor and Ohio State. Iowa has dropped four in a 
row since losing star Luke Recker to a broken kneecap. Even No. 
1 North Carolina lost on Sunday, to an 11-14 Clemson squad. 
Suddenly, Notre Dame's loss yes­terday doesn't sound so bad. 
Seton Hall's 13­10 record isn't as sparkling as Notre Dame's 17-6 standings, but the Pirates are much more talented than their loss column shows. It took some time for a team with three freshmen playing 
Troy Murphy watches as Seton Hall's Samuel Dalembert dunks In Sunday's
megaminutes to find its way, but loss to the Pirates. The loss broke Notre Dame's eight-game win streak. 

Eddie Griffin, Andre Barrett and Marcus Toney­El aren't just any newcomers ­they're three ofthe best in the nation. If they stick around the college game for long, which I wouldn't bet a nickel on, the Pirates will find themselves in the Final Four very soon. 
Speaking of the Final Four, Notre Dame's a talented enough squad to get there, ifthe Irish don't let yesterday's loss cloud their confidence. 
Graves, though doubtless disap­pointed with the loss, came off as convinced that the shooting slump was just a fluke. 
"We can't hang our heads with this loss," said the junior guard. "We've got something much big­ger than just losing to Seton Hall. We're still two games ahead in the West. We've still got a lot to accomplish this year." 
Notre Dame should hold its heads high after the way it's been playing since mid-January. The Irish have broken school record upon school record, assuring themselves of a first-ever winning record in the Big East and more than doubling Notre Dame's pre­vious best three consecutive league wins to eight in a row. 
One loss doesn't change what Notre Dame's accomplished, and Irish coach Mike Brey knows it. 
"I'm not looking for any build­ings to jump off of," said Brey. 
The Irish just have to avoid set­tling too long on the loss. Dwelling on a loss is only useful when a team's not trying. The Irish tried, winning the battle of the boards over a taller Pirates team. They just couldn't find the hoop. 
Thinking too much about the disappointment will only perpetu­ate the slump. 
As Brey said, "A lot of how we play Wednesday will be how we handle it this afternoon, this evening. tomorrow. and move on." 
Notre Dame needs to turn for­ward quickly, since Wednesday brings the best team in the East 
Division of the Big East to town ­
Boston College. 

Fitting that the Eagles are up next, because they just accom­plished the trick the Irish are looking to replicate. After reeling off six wins in a row, BC dropped a road game to Connecticut, but bounced back to win Saturday against red-hot Providence. 
The one time Murphy man~ged a smile after Sunday's loss was when Graves said, "It wasn't our day, and it happens. The sun will rise tomorrow." 
A bit corny perhaps, but he's got the right idea. Notre Dame's still one of "the hottest teams in the country," according to Seton Hall coach Tommy Amaker, and last I checked, the sun rose this morning. 
The views-expressed in this col­umn are those ofthe author and not necessarily those ofThe Observer.

cut the lead to one, but Troy Murphy's layup rimmed out. 
Both teams exchanged baskets before Seton Hall built its lead back up to 10 on a three pointer by Darius Lane with 14:59 remaining. 
"In the second half we tried to play faster," Brey said. "We tried to beat them down the floor and get an easy basket. " 
However. nothing came easy for the Irish. Notre Dame, which had just 12 assists and 15 turnovers, would never get closer than six points. 
"They are athletic and quick," sophomore guard Matt Carroll said. "We didn't get any open looks and they pres­sur~d the guys inside too. 
Every time the Irish made a run, Griffin either scored, blocked a shot or created a turnover. 
"He was phenome­nal," Amaker said of Griffin. "I thought he played as well as you can have a person play. He got baskets for us, big-time rebounds. He bailed us out with a couple of big-time blocks late." 
Murphy led the way for Notre Dame with 24 points and 16 rebounds. Carroll added 13 points and nine boards. Carroll and David Graves each went just 1-of-7 from behind the arc. Humphrey had 12 points. 
Seton Hall freshman Andre Barrett scored 17 points and dished 
out  seven  assists.  
Darius  Lane  had  15  
points.  

The Pirates' victory snapped Seton Hall's five-game losing streak and Notre Dame's eight-game winning streak. 
Notre Dame returns to the floor Wednesday for a conference show­down with No. 9 Boston College (19-3, 10-2). which stands atop the East division.

past Irish center Ruth Riley for the score plus a foul. The foul was Riley's fifth of the game -sending the All­American center to the bench on fouls for the first time this season. 
On the ensuing possession, the Irish struggled bringing the ball up the court, taking nearly 15 seconds. Guard Niele Ivey was able to move past Rutgers' Linda Miles. Irish guard Alicia Ratay then set a screen, allowing Ivey

there to block the 5-foot-7 Ivey's shot. 
"I knew it was just me and her, one-on-one," Pointer told the Home News Tribune. "At the last second she turned the corner. Thank God my big girl came through and made that block." 
In hindsight, McGraw wishes she had intervened on the play. 
"I should have called time­out," McGraw told the New York Times. "We were very, very tentative." 
Kelley Siemon, who led the Irish with 19 points and 15 rebounds while still playing with a broken hand, agreed. 
"It's a little tough," Siemon told the New York Times. "We only needed two points to win. We assumed Niele could get the ball up the floor and she being triple­teamed. There was confu­sion at the end." 
Pointer led the Scarlet Knights with 12 points and three blocked shots coming off the bench. 
"She's the hero of the game," McGraw told the Associated Press. "She didn't play as well as she did in South Bend, but in the end they wanted to go to her, so they went to her and she 
scored. That was  a  great  
play by her."  
The  game  was  marred  

with questionable calls. Irish forward Ericka Haney, who scored 12 points on four of 14 shooting, felt that Rutgers may have gotten away 
"I think that 
we were on 
the side that didn't get the most calls. I think that had the game been played at Notre Dame, it would have been totally different." 
The Irish shot 40 percent from the field. and only 50 percent from the line. Siemon was the only starter who made more than 50 ·percent of her shots, while the Irish got zero points off the bench. 
"I wouldn't credit that to 
their defense, I would just 
credit that to us missing 
shots," Haney said. "I 
thought that there were a lot 
of fouls under the basket 
that weren't called." 

Riley had her least produc­
tive game of the season for 
the Irish, despite scoring 
eight of her 12 points in the 
final minutes. Riley, who 
leads the Big East in shoot-_ 
. ing percentagt, and ranks near the top ini free-throw shooting, made only six of 14 attempts from the field while missing her only two free throws in the final minutes. 
"I don't think I was in the game at all," Hiley told the New York Times. "I shot the ball poorly." 
The only Irish player who didn't shoot poorly was Siemon, who made six of nine field goal attempts and shot above her season aver­age from the line -connect­ing on seven of 14 free­throw attempts. 
"They couldn't do anything with Kelley," Haney said. "Her taking the ball up to the basket was the one thing they really couldn't stop. I really didn't thi.nk that they had an answer for her." 
The Irish now face ques­tions heading into the post­season. The team still ranks as the No. 1 tea.m in the Big East, as they have defeated Connecticut, the only other team in the conference with one loss in the league. 
However, Notre Dame could fall to No. 2 in the NCAA bracket, as the Tennessee Volunteers also have only one 1.oss -to the No. 3 Huskies. The Irish also now must win the Big East Tournament -· where they could play both Rutgers and Connecticut -to assure a top seed during March Madness. 
Right now, though, the Irish are simply looking to learn from the experience and move on towards Tuesday's home game against Miami. 
"We're taking it more as a learning experience," Haney said. "We would like to see where we're going to be after the loss, but I don't think it's goin:g to affect us that much."

The Belles began their jour­ney with two goals. First: swim to achieve a personal best. Second: beat Alma and Albion. They would soon find they lost sight of the latter, and instead focused on beating themselves. 
The Saint Mary's swimming and diving team end their sea­son with a sixth place at confer­ences behind both Alma and Albion. Personal best times and school records were broken, however. 
"In the beginning our main focus was Alma and Albion but as the meet went on and the records started falling and peo­ple were swimming personal bests we forgot about the other teams and focused on us," said senior co-captain Colleen Sullivan. 
Sullivan could not be any happier with her own perfor­mance at her last collegiate competition. On Saturday she broke the 100-yard freestyle record in prelims and then reset it that evening in finals and a fifth place finish with a time of 55.84 seconds. She was also a member of the 200-yard freestyle relay team that broke the school record and the 400­medley relay team that missed the record by a slim margin on Thursday. 
Sullivan joined by Chloe Lenihan, Lauren Smith, and Megan Ramsey took the 200­medley relay record, a time of 
1:55.90 and a fourth place. Later Ramsey and Sullivan teamed with Elizabeth Doro and Maureen Palchak set the 400 free relay record (3:45.61). 
The same four went on to grasp a third place and two records during the 800 free relay. As the lead off swimmer Ramsey added the 200 freestyle record to her name. The relay team with a time of 8:13.97 also conquered the record books. 
Ramsey went on to break her own records in both the 100 and 200-yard butterfly events. Her third place finish and time of 1:00.87 in the 100 and sec­ond place finish and time of 
2:13.5 in the 200 were not enough to make the NCAA cuts. Although she missed the sought after NCM National qualifying times in both these events, Ramsey is satisfied with setting her own time standards this year. 
"There is no way I can be upset," said Ramsey. "I still had great swims even though I didn't qualify, I dropped a huge amount of time in both races, just not enough." 
Both Lauren Smith and Maureen Palchak also con­tributed top six finishes to the Belles. Smith taking sixth in both 100 and 200-yard breast­stroke events. Palchak compli­mented Sullivan's fifth place performance in the 50-yard freestyle with the sixth.

BASEBALL 

Irish top Bulldogs in close game 
Special to the Observer 
STARKVILLE. Miss. 
Sophomore righthander Matt Laird served up a clutch double­play ball in the bottom of the 10th and freshman first baseman Joe Thaman delivered the go-ahead double in the 11th, as the 12th­ranked Notre Dame baseball team won another close game from No. 16 Mississippi State, 4-2, in final­round action Sunday at the National Bank of Commerce Classic. 
Notre Dame (2-1) claimed a 2-0 lead in the sixth inning, highlighted by an RBI triple from sophomore rightfielder Brian Stavisky-whose four-hit day completed his 9-for-13 weekend. Mississippi State (0-2) then plated single runs in the sixth a.id eighth innings. ultimately sending the game into extra innings. 
Both teams stranded 12 baserunners, with the Irish holding a 15-10 edge in hits while playing error-free in the field. 

MSU--off to its first 0-2 start since 1996--dropped consecutive home games for the first time since midway through the 1998 season, when Kentucky posted 3-2 and 12­9 wins over the Bulldogs. 
The first of two Bulldogs errors in the final inning put the winning run on base for the Irish in the 11th (which was predetermined to be the final inning of the game. due to Notre Dames flight schedule). 
Sophomore leftfielder Kris Billmaier reached to open the 11th, after lifting a short popup down the rightfield line. Three MSU players converged on the play, with the ball kicking off the glove of senior first baseman Jon Knott-just inside the foulline-for a two-base error. 
Junior third baseman Andrew Bushey then took an 0-1 offering from junior righthander Adam Larson and drove the ball up the middle, moving Billmaier to third, before Thaman stroked his second double of the game-sending a 2-2 pitch down the leftfield line for the 3-2 lead. The Irish then padded their lead after an intentional walk to freshman second baseman Steve Sollrnann and junior centerfielder Steve Stanleys RBI grounder to the right side. 
Laird -who saved Saturdays 7 ­5 win over MSU when his lone pitch produced a double-play line­out to Sollmann-delivered a similar clutch pitch on Sunday, after relieving junior Drew Duff with runners on first and second. Laird fell behind pinchhitter Brad Rutto (2-0) before firing a pitch that Rutto hit straight to the second baseman Sollmann, who relayed the ball to senior shortstop Alec Porzel for the 6-4-3 double play. 
Porzel scored the games first run in the sixth, shaking off his 1-for­11 start with a leadoff double to right field. MSU then made a change on the mound, removing senior righthander Jeff Hunter in favor of freshman lefty Paul Maholm, but the lefthanded-hitting Stavisky continued his torrid start by tripling to the gap in right-cen­ter (his fourth extra-base hit and second triple of the season). 
Two batters later, Billmaier sin­gled to right field for a 2-0 Irish lead. 
MSU pushed across a run moments later, after Jason Burkleys leadoff double, a swing­ing bunt to the left side that eluded sliding sophomore righthander J.P. Gagne and Michael Browns run­scoring double-play ball. 
The Bulldogs tied the game in the eighth, after one-out singles by Burkley and Lewis and Steve Gendrons two-out single to left. 
Irish junior righthander Matt Buchmeier tossed four shutout innings in his fourth career start, allowing just four hits and one walk while striking out one MSU batter. 
Laird opened the bottom of the 11th by striking out Gendron before hustling to cover tirst base on Chad Henrys tricky groundball. The next pitch got away from Laird and hit Matthew Maniscalco but Laird ended the game with another tough fielding play, pouncing on a swinging bunt to the left side and throwing out Phillip Willingham for the final out. 
Notre Dame has won its last six extra-inning games, since losing a 10-7 game to Boston College on April 17, 1999 (in a seven-inning game that ended in the eighth). 
SOFTBALL 

Irish win for best 
start in history 
Special to the Obscrvc,r 
The 19th-ranked University of Notre Dame softball team set the mark for the best start in school history, complet­ing an undefeated week­end at the Holiday Inn Invitational in Tampa, Fla., today. The Irish knocked off No. 18 South Carolina 1-0 on Sunday. giving them a 5-0 record and the Invitational tour­namen t title. Senior Lizzy Lemire (Irvine, Calif.) and Jenny Kreich (Indianapolis, Ind.) split tournament MVP honors. 
Lemire collected six hits, including a double and a triple over the weekend while Kriech had eight hits with four RBI. 
Against South Carolina, the Irish rode the arm of their pitching ace, Jen Sharron (Agoura Hills, Calif.). Sharron won her third game of the tournament and tossed her second consecutive complete game of the weekend against the Gamecocks, 
giving up just three hits and striking out nine. She is now 3-0 on the season with a 0.35 ERA and 26 strikeouts in three starts. 
Both teams were scoreless until the top of the seventh, when Notre Dame's Andrea Loman (Riverside, Calif.) blasted a double off the wall in left centerfield to lead off the inning. Danielle Klayman (San Diego, Calif.} followed with a bunt single, moving Loman to third base. 
South Carolina's Megan Matthews, who would also throw a com­plete game with eight strikeouts, struck out Andria Bledsoe (Higley. Ariz.) next. leaving run­ners on the corners with one out. 
Sophomore Alexis Madrid (Temecula, Calif.J then slapped a single past third base to drive in Loman for the winning run. 
Notre Dame will return to action Friday, Feb. 23, in the Lady Razorback Invitational in Fayetteville, Ark.

HOCKEY 
leers rally to tie WolveJrines on road 
By MATT ORENCHUK Sports Writer 
Yost Ice Arena on the cam­pus of the University of Michigan is not the easiest place to play a hockey game. Not only are the Wolverines are one of the top hockey pro­grams in the country. but their fans are notorious for being rowdy during games. It would be nearly impossible for a tearo down 3-1 to fight back in an environment like that. 
But that is exactly what the Notre Dame hockey team did on Friday night. Down by two goals midway through the sec­ond period, the Irish battled back to tie the Wolverines 4-4 on their home ice. 
It was the first regular sea­son point earned by Notre Dame at Michigan since 1982. 
The game started off well for the Irish. Rob Globke scored on the power play seven minutes into the opening period to give Notre Dame a 1-0 lead. The defense played well early for Notre Dame, and the Irish went into the intermission with their one goal lead intact. 
The second period was an entirely different story. Michigan came out firing. A series of penalties gave the Wolverines a four on three advantage. Jeff Jillson was able to capitalize for Michigan and he tied the game at one with his goal 2:49 into the period. The Wolverines put two more goals on the board. first by Josh Langfeld and then anoth­er by Jillson to take a 3-1 lead at the 13:24 mark of the sec­ond period. 
Then Notre Dame got a break. Even Nielsen skated out of the penalty box and received a perfect pass from teammate Ryan Dolder. Nielsen raced up the ice and put the puck past Wolverine goalie Josh Blackburn to cut the Michigan lead to 3-2. 

"Nielsen's breakaway goal was the spark we needed," junior center David Inman said. "The team was able to feed off of that for us to comeback." 
Michigan wasn't done yet. They added another power play goal by Langfeld to restore their two-goal lead going into the second intermission. 
The third period belonged to the Irish. On the power play, Inman got a nice rebound and flipped the puck past Blackburn to make the score 4­3. 

"Dan Carlson made a perfect pass," Inman said. "I was just at the right place at the right time, and I was able to find an open net and put it away." 
Brett Lebda finished off the scoring when he scored short­handed with 10 minutes left in the game. That tied the game 4-4. 
The game was then a dual of the goaltenders. Tony Zasowski

was excellent in the third peri­od and overtime while preserv­ing the tie for the Irish. He stopped 40 shots setting a per­sonal record. 
Most importantly, the tie keeps the Irish tied for the last CCHA playoff spot. Notre Dame and Bowling Green each have 15 points and are tied for 10th in the league. The Irish. howev­er, hold the tiebreaker over the Falcons. and if the season ended today. Notre Dame would have the last playoff spot. 
Although they sit in the last playoff spot, the Notre Dame players know they can't be complacent. 
Next up for the Irish is a two game series at Alaska Fairbanks this weekend. 
"These arc desperate times," said Inman. "[Alaska Fairbanks) is one of the teams we are fighting with for the last playoff spot. So we need to come out of next weekend with some points."

win at the Indoors got off to a diflicult start by losing the No. 1 and No.3 doubles giving up the doubles point to the Bulldogs. Things didn't get much better for the Irish as they lost all but one of the singles matches to go down the defending national champions 5-1. 
"We lost 5-1 but it was a Jot closer than that," said Louderback. "If we had won the doubles point it would have made a big difference." 
Lindsay Green was the only singles player to win for the Irish as Michelle Dasso' s match was abandoned after Georgia clinched the victory by defeating Becky Varnum, Nina Vaughan, Caylan Leslie, and Kimberly Guy. 
"They've got a lot back from last year when they won the NCAA' s and they have been in pressure situations more than we have," Louderback said. "They have a lot more experi­ence and they played better at the end of the matches than we did, but this match will help us in the future." 
After struggling against a Georgia team that features four players in the top 100 in the country Notre Dame was pitted up against No. 7 Pepperdine in a consolation match. Despite the loss in the quarterfinals the Irish came out tough against Pepperdine immediately sending a message as Dasso and Varnum defeated the first-ranked dou­bles team of Senoglu and Pao.la Palencia 8-5. The win was fol­lowed by victories at Nos. 2 and 3 doubles by Cunha/Guy and Green/Vaughan that clinched the doubles point for the Irish. Establishing a 1-0 lead. 
"That was a big doubles win. Michelle and Becky had faced them three times before and had never beaten them," said Louderback "She [Dasso] was sick all weekend and stilled played well." 
After upsetting the nation' s top ranked doubles team Dasso beat 14th-ranked Ipek Senoglu 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 at No. 1 singles breaking the Notre Dame record for most singles victories set last year by Kelly Zalinsky. Following Michelle' s lead the rest of the Irish won four of the next five singles matches, giving them the 6-1 upset and improving their record to 7-2 .

Swi011Ders see Weathers as not just coach, but second dad 
UNIONDALE, N.Y. 
At first glance, Bailey Weathers doesn't exactly strike you as the type of man who would lead the women's swim team to five straight Big East championships. 
He's quiet, mild-mannered, and doesn't exactly say a whole 
lot. In fact, it's hard to believe that this soft-spoken man is the primary reason behind Notre Dame's success. 
But as the swim­mers will readily tell you, there is more to 

Weathers than you can tell when you Andrew Soukup first meet him. 

"He gets really quiet sometimes, but Irish Insight you just have to get to know him," said Lisa D'Olier. "He'll run around, tap your shoulder, and run away, and play little jokes on you. He has this whole other side to him." 
Weathers embodies the model of an ideal swim coach. He is a master recruiter -shown by the talent he con­sistently brings in -and an expert at training methods. During his six-year tenure as Notre Dame's swim coach, he has produced 10 All-Americans, but he's probably more proud of his 15 Academic All-Americans. He's been named Coach of the Year almost as many times as Notre Dame has won the Big East title. 

But there is a much deeper side to Weathers that only a few people ever see. 
"He gets in goofy moods," said senior Carrie Nixon. "He get things up, the spir­its up on deck. Even during practice all year, he's dancing around." 
"Sometimes, we wonder just how old he really is," laughed freshman Lisa Garcia. 
Weathers has been known to pull some crazy stunts. Just ask his swimmers. 
"Probably the funniest thing I've ever seen is when we were out to dinner one night, and we got him to get up and dance on the dance floor." said senior Kristen Van Saun. "I've never seen him dance before." 
Or there was the time that Weathers jumped off the diving board with his clothes on. 
"Marie was swimming fast and he said, 'If you go 2:07, I'll jump off the diving board with my clothes on·." said Kelly Hecking. "She goes, 'Really?' and the next lap she went 2:07. And at the end of practice, he did it with his wind pants on. He went home with one of the assistant coach's tight little pants on. It was hilari­ous." 
"He just jumped up and down on the board and then jumped in. and he's in a little ball and his hair is all flopping, and it was just the funnicsl thing," said fresh­man Danielle Hulick. 
And the one time that Weathers got mad, his swimmers had a hard time tak­ing him seriously. 
"One day he just yelled at us and made us do wall sits for 30 minutes," Hulick said. "It was the funniest thing. He was like a drill sergeant and you never see Bailey get mad." 
But the reason why Weathers is so loved by his swimmers can be seen in how he transcends the traditional dis­tance between coaches and athletes that characterizes college sports. Weathers is more than just a coach to his swimmers, he's a father. 
"I think that for a lot of us he's a dad away from home," said Van Saun. "I don't know a lot of college coaches that care so much about their swimmers out of the pool. I guess it's that it because he cares about me so much as a person and not just what I'm doing for him in the pool." 
"I think a lot of coaches just care about the sport aspect of your life," said Carrie Nixon. "He cares about everything else, too." 
Weathers is always interested in the social life of his swimmers, going so far as wanting to meet Lheir boyfriends. But he's always available at any time. Weathers' greatest strength is his ability to listen. He has his team over to his house frequently for dinner, and he actu­ally shows genuine interest in his swim­mer's lives. He stresses academics and social life just as much as he wants them to swim. In short, he treats his swimmers not just as athletes, but as people 
And for that, he earns a ton of respect. "I respect him as a person, not just as a coach," said Garcia. 
Weathers says that attending Notre Dame means more than being just a stu­dent or an athlete. It involves living a quality life. He always talks about how the sprit of Notre Dame and how it attracts quality people. Especially to his team, Weathers is one of those quality people. 
When it was announced that Weathers was named Big East Coach of the Year for the fourth time in his career, the women's swim team erupted into cheers. They chanted "B-Dub!" and yelled "We Jove you Bailey" as Weathers walked to the podium to receive his award. 
After, when the women's team was receiving the championship trophy, when asked 
if he was looking forward to getting thrown in the water as he has every year since Notre Dame started their streak of Big East title, Weathers casually replied, "Not really." 
The broad grin on his face said other­wise. 
In fact, Weathers must have been so eager to get in the water that he jumped in himself instead of waiting for his swim­mers to through him in. 
Weathers downplays his success as a coach and gives all the credit to his swim­mers. 
"It feels good, but I think a lot of that goes to the kids," he said. "It really comes down to how hard they work and their improvement." 
But it's a lot easier to work hard when you've got a coach as good as Bailey.

The Saint Mary's basketball team ended its regular season on a low note, dropping Saturday's game to Kalamazoo 88-53. 
"It was a bad game," sophomore start­ing guard Katie Christiansen said. 
That summed up the game. as the 35­point win margin set a record for Kalamazoo as the largest margin ofvicto­ry in Hornet history. The 88-point win also ranked No. 1 for number of points scored in a single game. 
Rebounding was at the top of the list of problems Saint Mary's faced on Saturday. the Belles only grabbed 30 total rebounds compared to the Hornets' 52. 
"We didn't rebound at all," Christiansen said. "It killed us. That was the big thing." 
The Kalamazoo offense kept the ball at the Kalamazoo end of the floor and pro­vided second and third chances for shots. 
"I think our thing was that we were boxed out and nobody would go after the ball," Christiansen said. "They would get their second and third shots." 
The first half was bleak for the Belles, with only 18 points and an 18.5 shooting percentage. The Hornets led 46-18 after the first 20 minutes of play. 
Kalamazoo's consistent man-to-man coverage kept the Belles shooting per­centage down and knocked the team off­track. Although the Belles had a better second half, shooting 37.5 percent from the floor, they couldn't come back from the 28-point first-half deficit. 
"They played really good defense, they pressured us really well," Christiansen said. "It's hard to get into a rhythm." 
The Hornets got right into a rhythm. however. They had a season high 51.4 percent from tho floor. 
"It was their senior night, they were pumped and ready to play," Christiansen said. "The first half they hit all their shots and we had an off shooting night." 
And it truly was senior night for Kalamazoo seniors Lindsay Drury and Ma.ryJane Valade. Drury, a starting forward, led the Hornets with 16 points along with eight rebounds. Valade scored 10 points along with seven rebounds and four assists. Joining the senior effort were sophomores Amanda Weishuhm and Stephanie Getz with 15 and nine points respectively. 
Senior guard Julie Norman, who was playing in the last reg­ular season game of her college career, led in scoring and rebounding for Saint Mary's. Norman scored 11 points and had three rebounds. Anne Blair chipped in eight points and guard Mary Campione scored six. Elizabeth Linkous grabbed six boards, leading the Belles in rebounding. 
The Belles came into the game looking for a win to possibly boost their MIAA playoff seed; Saturday's loss guaranteed that they will face off against league leader Hope College during round one .of tournament play. They know they will have to step up their play.

Last undefeated team falls to Rutgers 
By NOAH AMSTADTER 

... 
Assistanc Sports Editor 
So much for a perfect season. 
The No. 11 Rutgers women's basketball team avenged a Jan. 6 loss at the Joyce Center, toppling the nation's only undefeated team, 54-53 on Saturday night. 
Tammy Sutton-Brown led the Scarlet Knights, con­verting a three-point play with 28.1 seconds remain­ing before blocking Niele Ivey's last second shot under the basket. 
The loss drops the Irish to 23-1 overall, 12-1 in the Big East. 
"There was absolutely no burden at all," Irish coach Muffet McGraw told the Associated Press following the game. "We wanted to go through the whole year undefeated." 
As for suggestions that a loss would be good for the Irish. who have never been undefeated this late in a season, McGraw disagreed. 
"I don't see it that way," McGraw said. "I think this was a great opportunity for us to get a big win on the road and we missed our opportunities at the end." 
The game was decided when the Scarlet Knight guards found Sutton-Brown open on the lower-left block, where she powered

League winning streak ends against Pirates

Seton Hall forward Eddie Griffin proved why he might be the b e s t 

freshman See also: "Life in the wlll go on," p. 12 country Sunday. Griffin, who was suspended for the last meeting with Notre Dame, scored 24 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead Seton Hall (13-10, 4-8) to a 74-64 victory over No. 14 Notre Dame (17-6, 9-3). "Give Seton Hall a lot of 
credit," Irish head coach Mike Brey said. "They came 
out ready to play. They played loose and they played together. They took every­thing away from us and rat­tled us." 
The Pirates contested every shot and held the Irish to just 32 percent shooting from the field. 
"I think their wingspan bothers us," Brey said. "They are one team that gives us problems and I think that was evident today. They have length on the perimeter and I don't think we reversed the ball enough. We took a lot of quick shots and I think that played into their hands."

Irish come back to upset No. 7 
By STEVE KEPPEL Sports Writer 
The National Team Indoor Championships was a tourna­ment of ups and downs for the Irish as they won decisively in the first round against Oklahoma State but lost to defending national champion Georgia in the quarterfinals and then came back and upset No.7 Pepperdine in a consolation match. 
The match against Pepperdine was highlighted by Senior All­American Michelle Dasso as she defeated the No. 1 doubles team in the country with Becky Varnum and then went on to break the ND record for most singles wins with her 123rd vic­tory coming against No. 14 Ipek Senoglu. 
"Well, we had a good week­end." said coach Jay Louderback. "It's good for Michelle because she has been such a big part of the program and she wants to do well for the team." 
The Irish women came to the National Indoors on a streak of five straight wins and hoped to advance past the quarterfinals after losing there last year. On Thursday the 11th ranked Irish took on 40th ranked Oklahoma State where they took four of six singles matches after getting the doubles point to get the 5-2 win. The 5th ranked duo of Michelle Dasso and Becky Varnum start­ed off the tournament with an impressive victory over the 45th­ranked team of Ashleigh Dolman and Maria Phillips 8-1 at No. 1 doubles. That match was fol­lowed by victories from Cunha/Guy and GreenNaughan to seal the doubles point. 
Dasso also came out strong in singles tying the Notre Dame record with 122 victories in a solid win at the No. 1 spot. Oklahoma State rallied, howev­er, winning the next two singles matches tying the score 2-2. The tie was broken by Freshman Caylan Leslie who won 6-2. 6-0 at No. 4 singles and Becky Varnum then clinched the match with a straight set victory at No. 2 singles. 
After winning in the first round two years in a row the Irish were set to take on 2nd ranked Georgia in the quarterfi nals. The Irish who were looking for their first ever quarterfinal
