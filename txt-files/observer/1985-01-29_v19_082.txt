demeanor. county clerk's office and enter a out a midsemester break. But at the University of Virginia, where the first vacation of the school year is Thanksgiving weekend, students are demanding an October breakfor the sake oftheir mental health. 
University ofVirginia senior Steve Milo, chairman ofStudents for a Fall Break, said there is evidence that an October break could be a psycho­logical boon to exhausted students tense from midterm exams: "It's a problem of stress...the Student Health Center has evidence that the number of psychiatric problems on campus is highest in October." 
Milo said the suicides ofthree stu­dents last October have resulted in increased student support for a break. 
The Charlottesville campus is divided on the issue of the break. While a poll demonstrated that 85 percent ofthe students support a fall break, many older faculty members and administrators oppose the idea. 
Milo said that the Dean of Stu­dents "has gone on record against the break." Presently, the University director of the university's Student Health Center. "We see more people in October with stress-related com­plaints than in any other month," said Keeling, who has testified to stu­dent need of a break before the ad­ministration. "The nature of the complaints are more severe and ur­gent than at any other time," he said. 
Among the problems Keeling cited were extreme depression, fatigue, and "not very adaptive be­havior," such as going for long peri­ods of time without food or sleep. A midsemester break, Keeling said, would help relieve "the pressure parents and faculty put on students, as well as the pressure students put on themselves." 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's health personnel expressed mixed feelings on the necessity of the break. "Since there has always been a fall break while I've been here, I can't tell whether it helps or nQ!," said Director of Saint Mary's Health Services Gloria Chelminiak.

The purpose of the committee is to conduct a self-evaluation ofSaint Mary's in accordance with the guidelines established by The North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, an accreditation body. 
Donald Horning, professor of sociology at Saint Mary's and chair­man ofthe committee, said the eval­uation will involve all components of the Saint Mary's community. Every office, department, council, committee, and administration unit will be asked to contribute. 
In addition, members of the Saint Mary's community-administration, faculty, students, support staJf and alumniwill be asked to contribute to the evaluation process. 
In order to insure the evaluation 
of all components, the committee's 
responsibilities have been grouped 
into five basic task force areas. These 
are: Administrative, Academic, Stu­

Best gimmick of all is good food 
"They totally ignore the fact that they finally have somewhat organized lines in the serving area, and then they screw everything up by putting all these stupid buffets in." 
--A Disgruntled Notre Dame student 
I don't like dining hall dinners, and I will skip them every chance I get. 
Sure, it bothers me. But only when I really think about it and realize that it's all paid for. Otherwise noth­ing bothers me, not the thought of all the work that went into preparation, not the fact that I am snubbing an award-winning operation, and not the fear that maybe, just maybe, I might be missing something good. Nothing. 
I used to like them, mind you, but that's because the enjoyment of consumables rises directly in proportion to the hunger involved. Ofcourse being at Notre Dame has helped me to mature ever so much, and so I have learned w control my

KOC receives support from Senate 
By MIKE MRLEN 
SentorStQ/fReporter 
The Knights ofColumbus, looking for University permission for their proposed hall rental plan, received unanimous support at last night's Student Senate meeting. 
Tom Duffy, Knights of Columbus liaison and special projects commis­sioner, said the resolution "was hung up last year because we wanted to use alcohol." The current proposal forbids alcohol in the building, and Duffy said this provi­sion was important in preliminary talks with the administration. 
The proposed contracf''is like a party-room contract," he said add­ing "the facilities are for groups that are in need ofspace." 
In order to use the hall, interested groups would first post a security deposit of SIOO and pay S25 for every 50 people in attendance. Then the group would contact campus se­curity and pay for the use ofsecurity guards -about SSO for every 50 people. 
Some senate members thought four security guards for 200 people more than enough, but Duffy responded "if there are too many guards, we may renegotiate" later in the semester. He added, "John Goldrick (associate vice president for residence life) was worried about security." 
Student Senator Javier Oliva re­ported the success ofthe proposal to place cars in one parking lot over Christmas break. "Many people took advantage ofit," he said, adding "no reports of vandalism have been given." 
Student Body Treasurer AI Novas issued the fiscal report of the Stu­dent Activities Board for the first se­mester. He said most departments are on budget, although musical en­tertainment has already spent their entire budget for the year. "The new wave groups didn't go over as well as expected, and they were not well at­tended," Novas said. Therefore campus entertainment will sponsor the year's last concert, he said. 

Student Senator Pat Browne, in response to the recent wave of criticism which the Notre Dame Credit Union has received, gave a report on the status of some contro­versial policies. He said the 21-day­hold on out-of-state checks was necessary because "it might take as long as five weeks for a bounced check to come back." 
He added, however, "if your ac­count Is good, you can go to mem­ber services and have your account 'flagged.' " This enables one to bypass the hold, and Browne said more than one-halfthe members are eligible for this status. 

Boards discuss chapel renovations 
ByANNE GALLAGHER 
Sentor SIQ/fReporter 
Leaders ofa group examiningpos­sible renovations of chapels at Saint Mary's have assured government leaders that students will have a say in any changes to the four chapels. 
At last night's combined meeting of the Board of Governance and the Programming Board, Mary Feeley, chairwoman of the chapel renova­tion committee, said "Our task is not to renovate -our task is to come up with a renovation that the commu­nity will be pleased with. The one decision we've made is that we want to he~ from you: the faculty, resi­dent advisors, sisters and especially, the students." 
The committee, composed ofstu­dents, staff and consultants, is ex­amining the prayer needs of the community and eventually will rec­ommend either to renovate or preserve the current dormitory chapels, according to Feeley. 
Although the renovations prob­ably will not begin for more than a year, interest in developing the LeMans and Holy Cross chapels has been growing. 
"The buildings are servants of the people," said Barbara Searle, the liturgical consultant for the commit­tee. "If they aren't, they become

Hoping to allay students fears about losing the traditional interiors of Saint Mary's chapels, Searle showed slides of other renovations to churches and chapels, many similar in design to those at the Col­lege. She pointed out that a mix be­tween traditional and post-Vatican U architecture can add comfon and a feeling of community in a liturgical experience. 
Feeley emphasized that," 'We' as a community are going to renovate, and we have to decide what those things are thatwe are lookingfor ina chapel, what kind ofspace helps you pray."

Both McLean and Nickle's management refused to com­ment on the incident. 
Evaluation 
continuedfrom page 1 
Sophomore and senior Saint Mary's students, plus those who are members of the numerous councils. and committees of the college, will 
participate in this evaluation. In late February, all sophomores 
, and seniors will be asked to com­plete a questionnaire prepared by the task force on Student A1fairs. The reason for choosing sop­homores and seniors for the ques­tionnaire is because sophomores have just entered classes in their major, and seniors are preparing to end their studies in their major, said Horning. Horning said the committee wants everyone involved to "focus on the question: Is there anything we can do to improve Saint Mary's as an institution? We want students to be involved in this process. This is their opportunity to voice their opinions and to insure a sound future for Saint Mary's." Members of the committee were chosentorepresentthevariouscon­stituencies and disciplinary perspectives of the college commu­nity. 
The self-study process will take place duringSpring 1985. The Steer­ing Committee's report will be sub­mitted prior to Spring 1986, when the North Central SiteVisitation will take place.

Saint Mary's changes procedures and times for housing selections 
By DIANE PRESTI 
News Staff 
Saint Mary's is in the process of implementing a new system ofroom selections. The random number picks to determine the order of room selections instead will be done by computer and the room selec­tions will be held in March. 
These changes will be put into ef. feet this semester. In the past, students stood in line for several hours to randomly pick a number which would determine the order of room picks. The juniors would go first, then the sophomores and then the freshmen. 
lbis process proved to be time­consuming and expensive. Saint Mary's student government, to­gether with Director of Residence Life and Housing Patricia Rissmeyer, devised the new system. 
I 

lbis new system will save time and moneyfor both the students and the school, said Rissmeyer. She said the details ofthe plan have not been fully determined yet. The students will recdve a letter a few weeks bdore room selections describing the new system. 
The student government had been receiving several complaints about the old system. Early in Octo· ber 1984 they sent out a survey to all Saint Mary's students concerning room picks and the parietal system. According to Anne Marie Kollman, vice president for student affairs, the students responded well to the sur­vey. 
The survey asked If the students thought room selection was too early in the year. Sixty-six percent felt that it was, with only 9 percent disagreeing, and 25 percent having no opinion. When asked If they would be willing to pay the room deposit fee in February, but not choose rooms until March, 66 per­cent ofthe students agreed. 
Room selection was formerly in the third week ofFebruary. Now the students will get their selection numbers on March 10 and make their choice during the following two weeks. 
The student government is also in the process of making recommen· dations concerning the parietals sys­tem. These recommendations will be submitted to the Student Affairs Committee and Council, said Kol­lman. 
Saint Mary's residence life has been undergoing many changes in the past year. Last semester was the beginning of a new system of inte· gration. In the past freshman, sop­homores, juniors, and seniors were segregated in separate dorms. Now, with the new system, all the classes are incorporated in every building. 


Special Olympics Director named 
By ERIK.j. HICKEY 
StaffReporter 
Steve Gay has been named the ex­ecutive director ofthe 1987 Interna­tional Summer Special Olympic Committee. 
Gay, the sports manager ofsoccer for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, was chosen from a group of60 appli· cants for the position. Gay will be re­sponsible for the 1987 International Summer Special Olympics to be held at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
During the past year, Gay worked for the Los Angeles Olympic Or­ganizing Committee and coor­dinated soccer events at the four sites used during the Games. 
.Gay also has had experience in real estate management, marketing, and sales, and served as head coach for the U.C.L.A. soccer team from 1975 to 1980. Gay was himself a member of the U.S. Olympic soccer team in 1972 and 1976. 
In his new position as executive director ofthe ISSOC, Gay will be re­sponsible for organizing and manag­ing all aspects of the 1987 International Summer Special Olym­pics including fundraising, market· ing, volunteer recruitment, and developing the necessary opera­tional plans for use of facilities, services and sporting events. 
This is a large task, since the ISSO are held only once every four years, and involve every state of the union and more than 60 other countries. Daniel Harshman of Logan Center said the ISSO are the largest single event for the handicapped. 
Harshman said the games will be a first class sporting event with over 4,000 athletes competing in 13 dlf. 

ferent sports,including track and field, swimming, gymnastics, soccer, basketball, and softball. The Games will be held at both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's during a 1 0 day period from July 30 to Aug.8. 
Harshman said that many loca­tions all over the nation were con­sidered as sites for the 1987 ISSO games. Syracuse University, the Uni­versity of Oregon at Eugene, Ohio State University and Notre Dame were the finalists in the selection process. Harshman said there were three main reasons for the selection ofNotre Dame. 
First, the facilities are ideal and it is easy to create an Olympic village type atmosphere because of the campus size and setting. 
Second, the University's name stands for a committment to the Spe· cial Olympics, and University Presi­dent Father Theodore Hesburgh and the University were very willing to accomodate the Games. 
Finally, Harshman cited the his­tory of committment in the area; within Indiana, South Bend and Logan Center in terms of the handi­capped. 
Harshman said, "The people in Washington (D.C.) were impressed by the support we received from the people in town...The combination of Notre Dame and the community will insure that the games are carried on in a professional and dignified man­ner." 
He was equally pleased with the support of many of the Notre Dame staff. Harshman said, "It's great the way they've opened themselves up to us, from Father Hesburgh to Gene Corrigan (director of athletics) and Lefty Smith (head hockey coach), all the way to food service, main­tainance and even the computing service." Harshman also hopes to get students involved as volunteers. 
The Games will require about 
1 5,000 volunteers and agreat deal of support from organizations willing to help defray the S3 to 4 million cost ofthe Games. Harshman listed a few of the major organizations hel­ping with the Games, such as Civitan International, which according to Harshman is a civic organization, similar to the Kiwanis, who are cru­cial to the success of the Games.

Reagan's speech shows his vision of America 
The president's second inaugural speech reaffirmed his known convictions about a res­toration ofAmerican enterprise -security and values. 
But the most moving part of the celebration 
and the most promising for Republican 
Max Lerner 

The Max Lerner Column 
hopes -was the devoted response the presi­
dent got from the young people who were dis­
appointed about the cancelllng of the 
Inaugural parade but gathered to perform 
nevertheless. 

the rapport between a 73-yeac-old presi­
dent and America's high school and college 
students who are the promise ofAmerican life 
was the extraordinary thing about the 1984 
election and the 1985 inaugural. 

There may be three principal reasons why 64 percent of the youngest voters gave Reagan their suffrage. One is his sense ofcom­mand, because the young identify with the image ofa leader who is in charge. The second is the restoration of traditional values, which the young of the 1980s have aided and welcomed. The third is their sense that an en­terprise system freed from governmental in­trusions is becoming a high technology system which opens future possibility for them. 
All three were embodied In the inaugural address, which was vintage Reagan. Although it Is bruited that he wrote it himself, which remains to be confirmed, the more important fact is that his thinking and feeling and his whole first term supplied the themes. All three appeal not only to the young but to the large middle and enterprise classes which make up Reagan's America. 
There is another America, too, that of homeless, jobless and hopeless -fewer than during the depression but still there -whom Reagan's "opportunity society" is passing by. 
There ace city families squeezed by the con­
tinuing budget cuts, and farm families losing 
their land and homes. The president did not 
omit mention of "compassion" from his ad­
dress, but caring and sharing have not been 
dominant Reagan themes. 
Yet the sentence of the inaugural most 
likely to be remembered concerns the 
changes in American society: "We live in a 
world that's lit by our lightning." 
Reagan has been most cleacly recognized as 
a "restoration" president, one who has 
rejected the traumas of the '60s and '70s of 
"anything goes" and the abandonment of 
traditional values and returned to the triad of 
"family, country and God." But the restoration 
of values does not mean the suspension of 
change, and Reagan's "lightning" metaphor 
embraces both the American heritage and the 
high-tech future. 
Reagan's America, in the face of the predic­
tions, comes closer to an era of good feelings 
than any since Eisenhower's. The reason for it 
may last beyond the decade, despite the inevi­
table tensions and acrimony that will accom­
pany the struggle over the budget, the deficit 
and the acms control debate. 
Paradoxically the Restoration Presidency Is 
also one imbedded in the current revolutions 
of our time -especially the information revo­
lution, the knowledge and science revolution 
and the managerial revolution. · 
The young applauded Reagan's evocation of 
America's past. But they respond more to the 
world of the computer and high technology 
and a laser defense strategy which they see as 
opening a future of security and success. For 
them it is a world in which their skills will be 
translated Into jobs and careers, and one in 
which they can get a good chance at life's 
chances. 
They ace bound to encounter difficulties and doubts. But we had almost forgotten that a civilization draws its strength from the belief of the young.

Weighing the odds in the abortion debate 
One of the arguments used last fall against voting for Ronald Reagan was the fact that he would have the chance to color the future of the Supreme Court into the 21st century by the appointments he can make In his second term. It was not an 
Gary Wills 

outrider 
argument that meant very much to me. I 
saw ample reason for opposing Reagan in 
himself; I did not have to fall back on Indi­
rect effects that his presidency would have 
later on. 

But the argument was sharpened for some had the Idea that abortion might be outlawed again -or, more properly, "turned back to the states" -by a new court. After all, we are told, only two differ­Ing votes ace needed to alter the previous balance on this issue. This argument reflected, fearfully, the hopes raised by some evangelical and Catholic leaders who said that President Reagan would give them the two appointees they need. 
The argument In this sharpened form was no more compelling to me-actually, even less. For one thing, It rested on an as­sumption that the votes of sitting justices were forever ascertained. But when the court addresses the problem ofabortion, it will be a problem different from the one it faced in 1973, in part because of its suc­cessful actions in that yeac. 
One does not need to agree with Dooley that the court follows election results to know that justices look to the large legal problems of their time -including the problem of enforceability. A majority of the court Is not likely to vote for something It knows will be no more practicable than was Prohibition. 
As pact of its coverage on the large anti­
abortion demonstration in Washington, 
ABC conducted a poll that showed a 
majority of the American people not only 
favor abortion but favor abortion on 
demand. The network added what its com­
mentators thought would be surprising ­
that over 50 percent of Catholics favor 
laws for abortion on demand. That does 
not surprise me because I am Catholic. I 
heac from my fellows what they think, 
though I myself am opposed to abortion. 
The ABC poll reflects other polls, which 
also indicate a growth in the number of 
those who would allow abortion -and no 
wonder. We have lived with the results of 
Roe vs. Wade for a dozen years. The 
resisted thing has become, for many 
people, the normal thing -whether one 
likes that or not. A generation has reached 
or left its teens with the understanding that 
abortion, whether evil or not, Is an option. 
Social inertia, once against abortion, 
then checked and slowly reversed, now 
favors it, or increasingly favors allowing it. 
We ace at a state ofsocial process different 
from the one addressed by the court 
beforehand. We will be at a further stage in 
this process by the time a new court gets 
around to abortion. 
It is not a problem that can be solved in the Supreme Court any longer. In this, it resembles slavery -though it is unlikely that a majority of the voters in America favored slavery by the 1860s. This will mean nothing to those who oppose abor­tion on moral grounds, no matter what the political odds. More power to them. But those who tell their followers they can take a shortcut across massive popular resis­tance by a favorable appointment or two to the Supreme Court ace living on dreams, or 
peddling dreams.

Mother Theresa and the Bhopal disaster 
Ever since I heard the brief report on the NBC news that Mother Theresa had visited the victims/survivors of the Bhopal (India) disaster, I have fumed. It was what she said that got my dander up. Once upon a time, Mother Theresa had an authentic calling, that of rescuing the destitute and dying from the streets of Calcutta. Then she had the mis­fortune of being "discovered" by the British 
Ann Pettifer 
guest column 
journalist Malcolm Muggeridge. He was in the process of sloughing off his worldly, rather dissolute past. Promoting Mother Theresa was pact of his public, some would say ex­hibitionist, spiritual quest. It did neither of them any good. 
So what was the offending statement that Mother Theresa made? She urged the sur­vivors of Bhopal not to feel anger at what had happened to their community; rather, she ex­horted them to forgive those responsible for the catastrophe. Those responsible were American corporate buccaneers and Indian officials. lf people were less besotted by the cult ofher holiness, they would recognize that this Is the response of a co-opted woman for Mother Theresa has hitched her wagon to the status quo in both church and state. She has lost, if she ever had it, a critical capacity, what the Christian Testament calls the power ofdis­cernment. 
Did Jesus go to society's victims and exhort them to forgive those in power whose actions desecrated and deformed their lives? The hell he did! He spent his time cataloguing the sins ofthe supply-siders ofhis day, throwing huck­sters out of the Temple and, without mincing his words, castigating the priestly establish­ment as place-man, career types, more inter­ested in the spoils that the priestly office had to offer than in keeping God's Covenant. At the heart of the Covenant was an emphasis on justice for the economically marginalized, 
people like widows and orphans, who were thought to be particularly vulnerable. 
Mother Theresa Is an example ofa Catholic spirituality which has diluted and betrayed the vigorous confrontation with power that jesus displayed and which took him to the cross. A Catholic woman I know once told me that she believed anger to be a sin against charity (sic). When anger Is not appropriated it leads to Inertia and alienation in both the individual and in society. It can, of course, only be repressed for so long; if anger Is not channelled rationally into a political agenda, it will erupt sooner or later, irrationally. This usually plays into the hands of demagogues. Norman Cohn's Tbe Pursuit of the Millen­nium Is a classic analysis ofthis phenomenon. 
Had the Russian Orthodox Church done its job properly, had it risked telling the czac that his dispensation was corrupt and unjust when judged by biblical standards of justice, Lenin and dialectical materialism would not have found such fertile soil. The Gospel, properly preached, Is matchless. However, when we 

codify It into dogma and doctrine, denature 
and etherealize it, we leave the door open to 
other ideologies whose proponents ace 
prepared to organize and exploit people to 
counter the poverty which is their ruin. 
Several years ago, in an undergraduate phi­
losophy course I was taking at Notre Dame, 
the class read John Locke's Tbe Reasonable­
ness of Christianity. A propagandistic pur­
pose lies behind this book. Pact of Locke's 
intention was to propose Jesus and the Good 
News as effective social pacifiers. Locke him­
self was probably a religious sceptic. He 
believed that if the church taught an other­
worldly spirituality which promises rewards 
in an after-life for injustice and poverty 
endured without complaint in this life, the 
result would be social peace. A great deal of 
mainstream Christianity continues to adv­
ocate this kind of perverted, dualistic 
spirituality which insults Jesus and human in­
telligence. Marx was quite right when he 
called It opium -like opium it demoralizes and 
eventually dehumanizes. 
One of the reasons that Mother Theresa's 
spirituality Is so unprophetic is the absence of 
prophetic female role-models (accursed hyp­
henate) in the church. The church had a 
gloriously prophetic figure in the person of 
the mother ofJesus, Mary, but successions of 
church fathers have stripped away her elan. In 
focusing on her perpetual virginity, they have 
ignored the woman who came from a politi­
cally radical family and who welcomed her 
pregnancy with the Magnificat: "God had 
shown the power of God's acm, God has 
routed the proud of heart, God has pulled 
down princes from their thrones and exhalted 
the lowly, the hungry God has filled with good 
things, the rich sent empty away." 
Perhaps it Is because I am a woman, a 
feminist and a convert to Roman Catholicism 
that I find Roman Catholic ecclesiastical male 
concern with Mary's gynycologica1 arrange­
ment indelicate. It is an outrageous intrusion ·into Mary's privacy, this endless definition and formulation of doctrine concerning the state of her hymen. The miracle of Mary is not the non-rupture ofthat fragile membrane, but her unfaltering commitment to the Jewish Cove­nant. She also raised a great fellow and had the perspicacity to push him out of the nest, propelling him into public ministry when she thought the time was ripe. Perhaps at thirty, the time was ripe! 
To end on a more hopeful note-it is becom­ing increasingly clear that Mother Theresa's spirituality will take Its place eventually alongside the dinosaur. A new breed of nun­woman is on the move, pacticulacly in the United States. She does what she can to avoid taking her orders from prelates and in the process builds new organizations like 
Network, the social justice lobby in Washing­ton, D.C.. The modern nun-woman is gradually giving up her submissive quasi­clerical status, thus she is helping to lead the way to a classless church, a church without clerics -those spritituallords -and without a lumpenproletariat -the laity.

'Stop it David. Put your hands down.' 
The boy stops flipping his hands in the air. He looks at me with big, brown eyes that ques­tion what he should do next for excitement. I give him my key chain and it occupies his un­divided attention. He is fascinated by in­animate objects. 
David is tall and thin for a thirteen year old boy. He has brown hair and brown eyes. His beautiful smile displays straight, white teeth. 
Diane Yoder 
guest column 

His movements are strong and graceful. Physiologically, doctors can find nothing wromg with the boy. But David is autistic. He does not speak and signs only a few words. He exhibits selective deafness along with seven or eight characteristics ofa classically autistic person. 
I know very little about autism or handicap­ping conditions. I only see a young boy ex­hibiting very strange behavior at times. It is a behavior which is often hard to deal with. I would describe his autism as a glass barrier erected in front of him which keeps the outside world from invading David and vice­versa. It constrains his speech and actions, yet his mind is sharp and bright. At times, he at­tempts to break down the glass barrier, and at times he seeks refuge behind it, in himself. 
David lives in Northern Indiana State Hospi­
tal in a unit with 15 other higher function 
children. The hospital is home to children of 
handicaps such as severe and profound 
retardation, cerebal palsey, and autism. I work 
with many of these children on a volunteer 
basis, but mainly with David. I am his volun­
teer and he is my child, so to speak. I take him 
ice skating, to Notre Dame sporting events, to 
the mall, and to Saturday recreation at Logan 
Center. David loves McDonald'd and ice 
cream. He loves to swim, bowl, and ride a sta­
tionary bicycle. 
He is no angel as far as behavior is con­cerned. He spits, and has thrown temper tantrums which have left permanent marks on both my mental and physical well-being. He gets depressed and cries, too. 
But David is very special in many other ways. He craves affection. He needs to feel the security and warmth of a hug. He loves to be told how good his behavior is or how well he did in completing a jigsaw puzzle. He is filled with love and has no reservations in showing that love. His eyes dance and shine with joy when he knows someone else loves him. 
David is like many other handicapped people in this: He is human and desires to be loved and to love others. In my eyes, handi­capped people are truly special in that respect, because they are blessed with the ability to give and receive love without judging others. They are quick to welcome anyone and everyone into their lives, and into their hearts. 
Since I have been in college, working with the handicapped has been one ofthe most im­portant and enjoyable aspects of my life. There was a time when I felt uncomfortable around disabled people because of my own ignorance and lack of experience with them. That uncomfortable feeling dissolved within minutes the first time I entered Logan Center. Since that first day, I have missed only one "rec" and have become extensively involved in NISH and other programs at home. 
If I had to describe what happens at Logan Center or when I take David to the mall for example, I would say that it is a chance to play, a chance to become a child again. It is two and one-half hours of running around and acting like we did in kindergarten or playing games like "Red Rover" or "Duck, Duck, Goose." It is non-stop fun and laughter. 
I continually laugh when I work wiUI me handicapped. I always return to school with many stories to tell about "the kids" (and the volumnteers ). It is never a malicious laugh, it's just that funny things always happen at the least expected moment. For example, there is a young man who comes to Logan Center named Brent. Brent thinks he is the ultimate ladies man. He approached me at a dance last year and I greeted him with, "Hi Brent." He said, "I thought you wouldn't recognize me." When I asked him why he thought that he replied, "because I am wearing colonge." He was dead serious. I almost died oflaughter. 
Working with the handicapped is not al­ways full of joy and happiness. It can be frustrating and discouraging. It is absolutely heart-wrenching to see David cry and not have the capacity to understand why or to help him. But to see the joy in his eyes and smile when I come to see him washes away the bad experiences and fills me with a sense of joy and satisfaction rivaled by nothing else. 
'· 
Working with the handicappped has taught 

me so much about people, love, and giving as 
well as about myself. It has helped me to love 
others as human beings, without judging 
them. It has instilled in me a passionate com­
mittment to helping those less fortunate than 
myself. More import, it has had a permanent 
impact on my life and has made my four years 
here extraordinarily memorable and en­
joyable, 
When I graduate from Notre Dame in May and leave Logan center and NISH behind, I will be leaving behind one of the most special aspects ofmy life. The only comfort I will have is the certainty that there will be many stu­dents to come who will make Logan center and NISH an important commitment during their years at Notre Dame. When that hap­pens, David and many others like him will for­get me, but I will never forget them. The people of Logan center and NISH, especially David, will remain in my heart and prayers forever.

Doctor Kanury's story, is it fact or fiction? 
As a new semester begins at Notre Dame, students who are all too familiar with the campus, the snow, the administration and the faculty return to see much ofit the same. But if one looks closely, one may detect some marked differences, for it is between semesters and over the summer that the Uni­versity tends quietly to make changes. 
One noticeable difference is.the absence of ,a highly respected mechanical engineering professor, Murty Kanury. Winner of the Me­chanical and Aerospace Engineering Faculty 
John Goebel becker guest column 
Award in 1983 and the College ofEngineering Faculty Award in 1980, Kanury has repeatedly been evaluated by his students as one of the best professors at the university. Even several currently enrolled Indian graduate students considered Kanury's reputation in heat trans­fer in their decision to attend Notre Dame. 
With such an impressive rapport with his students, one wonders what the reasons were for his departure. Several reports have circ­ulated around the mechanical engineering de­partment. One is that PACE report, a summary of recommendations made by the board of trustees, has called for an increase in the num­ber of Catholics on the University's faculty. The rationale is that a larger number ofCatho­lic educators at Notre Dame will create an at­
,mosphere more conducive to Catholic indoctrination. 
Such cookbook policy does not always produce the desired clie<"t, and we begin to see more evidence ofNotre Dame's obsession with "excellence"-no, even better, "Catholic excellence." What looks good in our reports is good for the university. The more research grants our profs acquire and the subsequent publications they write, the greater Notre Dame's academic reputation will be. If more masses are said on campus each week, more Catholics are on the faculty and fewer speakers with controversial viewpoints are invited to speak, Notre Dame will be all the more Catholic. To a certain extent these policies may work, if the faculty and adminis­tration remain committed to the student and to education. 
My experience here unfortunately has not seen that commitment from its faculty. So many professors are pressured to land re­search grants and churn out publications that they literally have no time for their courses. Is this an institution ofhigher education, or are-search lab comparable to NASA's Lewis Re­search Center in Cleveland? Research is unquestionably vital to a university's success in maintaining the highest level of education possible, but it should never upstage the fun­damental goals ofNotre Dame-education and formation. Kanury, while conducting impor­tant research in combustion, never prioritized his research over his students. 

Another report unveUs an even more upset­ting policy of preferring a professor who writes "Roman Catholic" on his portfolio over one who writes "Protestant" or "Methodist." Who is to say the Protestant is not going to be more committed to teaching and to the welfare of his students and embody a more Christian lifestyle than the Catholic? Although Kanury was not Catholic, he was Christian, and he was one of the very few profs who made the effort to incorporate his philosophy of life into the engineering courses he taught. Teaching heat transfer was not enough if he was not able to stimulate the students to think about morality and daily living. He never forced his views on his class but exposed us to them and challenged us to think. 
I remember him saying at the close of the semester, "If my life has affected you in some positive way, then I have helped thirty people. But if you in turn take what I have given you and share it with someone else, and the process continues, my life is worthwhile." His teaching is his life. No other engineering prof so clearly manifested that. 
Still another report indicates that Kanury had a personality contlict with one ofhis col­leagues. Having been granted tenure, he ap­plied for full professorship three times. The second was denied after a thirty-nine person faculty recommendation board evaluated Kanury's application. Thirty-six approved Kanury's professorship, three did not. It is bit­terly discouraging to see the students and the University pay the price for personality con­flicts and political shenanigans within the de­partment. 
The purpose of this column is to express extreme dissatisfaction with the engineering school's action in denying Kanury's professor­ship which prompted his departure. The uni­versity has yet another blemish on its record of excellence, in its quest for excellence and, again, the students suffer. 
A public statement is in order, in fairness to Kanury's former students and especially to the Notre Dame students who will not have the opportunity and privilege to experience the man.

DePaul was only able to win the 
three mile run, 440-yard dash, 1000­
yard run, triple jump, mile run, and 
mile relay. The Blue Demons' joe 
Vogenthaler captured both the 
1000-yard run and the mile, while 
Kerry Sloan won the 440-yard dash 
and took second in the long jump 
and 60-yard high hurdles. 
While many of the top Irish run­
ners did not participate, the meet 
displayed several important charac­

tantly, the Irish runners ran hard, 
and when challenged for the lead, 
they held off DePaul and captured 
the events. This determination will 
be especially Important In the bigger meets later In the year. 
Once again, the jumpers stood out and showed that they can be counted on to consistently score points. Finally, many ofthe freshmen competed for the first time, and demonstrated they will provide solid performances in the remaining part ofthe year.

Saint Mary's fencing team reaches end of rebuilding era 

By COLLEEN MACISZEWS.KI 
sports Writer 
After the first few weeks of the 1985 season, it appears that the rebuilding period is coming to an end for the Saint Mary's fencing team. 
Although the program still needs sonGeiDlprovennentbeforeitreturns to the level it attained three years ago, the fencers and first-year coach Mike Weeks are expecting good results by the end ofthe season. The reason is siDlple. For the first tinGe in a few years, the team has a large number of experienced fencers re­turning to the squad. 
"We are an improving team," says Weeks who succeeded Marc Dejong this year. "We should continue de­veloping as the season goes on." 
Weeks will be counting on cap­tain Mary Ann Castaneda to help the Belles' development. The senior has a great deal of experience and has been the most constant figure in the program which has gone through a number of coaches in the past several years. She knows that she has a great deal of responsibility, and hopes to help set the program back on the correct course. 
"When I was a freshman, we had a very good year," says the San Diego, Calif., native. "We lost a lot of fen­cers after that year, though, so we had to start from scratch. I think I've been able to help rebuild the pro­gram along with Coach (Mike) DeCicco (the Notre Dame coach) and the other coaches we've had. 
"I think the program is progress­ing quite rapidly now because most of the team started last year. Last year was really the starting year for everybody except myself, but this year everybody is much better." 
The key to this year's squad will 
be the continued iDlprovement of 
the three juniors: Ann Raney, 
Debbie Buchanan and Becca Bar­
nett. They forDl the core ofthe team 
and will be expected to fill the void 
that will result when Castaneda 
graduates. 
The juniors are not the only ones with whom the responsibility of rebuilding the prograDl will rest. Sopho01ore Laura Harris, the youngest member of the squad, also will be counted on in the years to come. 
The Saint Mary's team has benefited a great deal from its close association with the Notre Dame fencers. DeCicco, one of the Dlost successful fencing coaches in the country, spends a lot of time with the team. The Belles also practice with the Irish, allowing them the ex­perience ofcompeting against some ofthe best fencers in.the nation. 
"Practicing with Notre Da01e does us a world of good," says Cas­taneda. "It does take the girls a while to get over to Notre Dame from Saint Mary's which is kind of a hassle, but if we didn't have the competition, we wouldn't be able to compete with the good fencers." 
The team's road trip to the East Coast during the semester break is a good example of how much the as­sociation with Notre Dame helps. The Belles did not think they would be able to go east to face some ofthe nation's best fencers, but the team was able to raise enough money to go and DeCicco brought them along with his fencers. 
Saint Mary's took advantage ofthe opportunity as it performed quite well, finishing with a 2-2-1 record in non-tournament action. The Belles also lost in the first round of the United States Fencing Association Collegiate Open. 
"The East Coast trip really did us a 
world ofgood," says Castaneda. "We 
were very fortunate to go and we did 
really well." 
The trip began on Jan. 7 when Saint Mary's competed in a meet with Harvard and MIT. The Belles got off to an inauspicious start as they fell to Harvard, 7-2. However, the team bounced right back against MIT, winning a close battle, 5-4. 
The University of Pennsylvania played host to Saint Mary's two days later and quickly wiped out the memory of the MIT win by routing the Belles. Once again, however, the 
Irish 
continuedfrom page 12 
started controlling the boards, once we got ahead, we just wanted to take our tinGe and get good shots." 
The Irish did not hit all of their shots, though, and they finished the game with a percentage of .434 on 23-for-53 shooting. Notre Dame did gain an edge over the Friars in rebounding, 39-24. 
Donald Royal and Joseph Price, who started the ga01e in place ofjim Dolan and Scott Hicks, scored 12 and 11 points, respectively. Tim Kempton had eight points and 11 rebounds, while the Friars' Brian Waller led all scorers with 20 points. Palazzi had 16 points for Provi­dence. 
Phelps explained that his strategy in starting a new lineup was not to punish anyone for last Saturday's loss at Maryland. 
"I'm just looking for a combina­tion to get ourselves going again," Phelps said. "I don't blame anybody for what happened Saturday."

Princeton and tied Temple before 
heading to Bryn Mawr Colle_ge 
outside Philadelphia to compete in 
the USFA tournament. 
Saint Mary's was seeded 14th in 
the 16-team field which competed 
at Bryn Mawr from Jan. 11-13, and 
was forced to Dleet a tough William 
& Mary team in the first round ofthe 
single-eliDlination tourney. The 
Belles lost, eliminating them froDl the competition. 
As expected, Castaneda was the star ofthe trip, posting an impressive 14-2 record, easi!y :he best among

Last night's victory raised Notre Da01e's record to 10-5, while the Friars fell to 9-11. The Irish will be back in the ACC tomorrow night for a 7 p.m. game with St. Louis.

Races heat up in men's and women's interhall basketball 



B.P. leads women's division 
By MICHAEL FLANNERY 
Sports Writer 
In the making of cottage cheese, everyone knows cream rises to the top. Stir up the womens' lnterhall basketball league and you'll get the same result. Halfway through the regular season, the elite have dem­onstrated their superiorty ·· under­neath them, there's a mad scramble to make the playoffs. 
Breen-Phillips A-team, ranke<l second In the preseason, have a firm grip on the number one position. They are undefeated, with a record of5·0. 
Using a simple motion offense, 
B.P.·A has taken advantage of some 
hot shooting from Janice Monagle, 
Usa 'Downtown' Brown, and Dava 
Newman. Under the boards, 
forward-center Ann Curoe has been 
dominant. 
"In all of our games, In every cru­
cial situation, we have risen to the 
occasion," says B.P. captain Kathy 
McCarthy. "Best ofall, we are enjoy­
Ing ourselves · even when the game 
Is on the line.' 
On Sunday, Lewis B became the 
latest victim ofB.P.·A's stellar perfor­
mance, losing by six points. 
Close behind B.P.-A, with a 4-1 record, Is Farley A. Last year's cham· pion was expected to falter this year, but It has proven unbeatable after an opening game loss to Pasquerllla East. An in-house battle with Farley B on Sunday was no contest with Farley A winning by 13.

Walsh. This preseason dark horse upset P.E. on Sunday to run their record to 3·1. "Our defense forced 
P.E. to take the perimeter jumpers; their inside game wasn't really a fac­
tor,"  says  Walsh  captain  Claire  
Welsh.  
Welsh calls  the  game  a  "hard­ 

fought battle on both sides. I'm sure both teams will be in the playoffs." 
What about P.E., the early favorite to win It all? They are mired in fifth place, with a 3·2 record. Against Walsh, P.E. was forced to play with­out talented Reggie Richter, who was In the Infirmary with stomach flu. 
While they aren't out of the playoffpicture, captain Susie Fessler sums up the situation well. "Basically, we've got to win the rest ofour games," she says. 
Lyons, also at 3·2 and struggling to make the playoffs, typifies the atti· tude of the rest of the league. They are conceding nothing to the top teams. Captain Gretchen Grieb says simply, "We think B.P.-A is heatable." 
The best game of the year should be a Valentine's Day clash between B.P.-A and Farley A. Cards and candy aren't likely to be exchanged. "They know we're a force to be reckoned with," says McCarthy. "I just hope It's clean ·· but we'll be ready for anything." 
The records as ofJanuary 29: B.P.· A, 5·0; Farley A, 4-1; Walsh, 3-1; Lewis A, 3·1; P.E., 3·2; Lyons, 3·2; Lewis B, 2·3; Badin, 1·3; P.W., 1·3; Farley B, 0-4; B.P.·B, 0·5. 

Sorin, Planner, Morrissey hold top spots 
By KEVIN HERBERT 
Sports Writer 
In interhall basketball action 
Thursday, Sorin maintained its one­
half game advantage in the Pac Ten 
while Flanner took a half-game lead 
in the ACC and Morlssey inched 
closer to Grace in the Big Ten. 
Pac Ten powers Sorin and St. Ed· 
ward's each continued their win­
ning ways Thursday, Sorin with a 
61-47 victory over Pangborn and St. 
Ed's with a 55-51 win over Stanford. 
Pangborn {2·3) led Sorin (5-0) into the fourth quarter by a score of 39-37. A tenacious full-court press by Sorin however forced countless Pangborn turnovers down the stretch, turnovers which Sorln quickly and consistently capitalized upon. Though Pangborn led by 1 0 at the half and by two at the end of three it was Sorin who prevailed in the end 61-47. 
Steve Beuerlein led the Otters with 19 points, 131n the second half, Chris Nanni added 15. For Pangborn, Thorn Geyer and Chris Rawson each scored a dozen. 
Meanwhile In the Pac Ten, St. Ed's ( 4-1 ) remained one game behind front-running Sorln with a 55-51 vic­tory over Stanford ( 2-3 ). The loss dropped Stanford three games be­hind the pace. 
Ed Roohan scored 14 points, while teammates Chip Roohan added 12 and Jim Sower chipped in

man for the game, Shawn O'Grady 
with 20 points. 
In Big Ten action Thursday, 
league leader Grace ( 4-0) was idle 

while Morrissey ( 4-1 ) gained a half 
game with a 48-32 victory over 
Howard ( 0-5 ). 
Hot shooting from the field by 
Howard combined with ineffective 
experimental defenses by Morrissey 
led to the close 21-14 Morrissey 
halftime lead. 

"With the aquisition of some of 
the, football players, we wanted to 
try some new defenses to see just 
what we could and could not do," 
explained Morrissey captain Steve 
Treacy. "Our man to man defense Is 
what really worked for us." 
In the second half Morrissey 
switched to its man to man and the 
Howard sharp-shooting ceased, the _result was a 48-32 Morrissey win. 
In other Big Ten action, Keenan 
pulled off a mild upset by defeating 
Off Campus 4 5-41. 
Keenan ( 2-3) led comfortably at the half 21-12. After intermission, however, the Off-Campus offense began to heat up with 19 third quar­ter points to cut the gap to 32-31. In the end however, it was Keenan who prevailed 45-41. Keenan was sparked by Jim Reid's 13 points and Riek Bliha's 10. .Off-Campus' leading scorer was Dave Taiclet with 12. 
Moving on to the ACC, Flanner 

A 
edged out to a half-game lead i_n that 
division with a 45-37 win over Stan­
ford. 

Stanford (3·2) shot out to an early 12-8 second quarter advantage but from there on In It was all Flanner. Flanner ( 4-1) led by six at the half, seven at the end ofthree and eight at the final whistle. The loss puts Stan­ford one game behind Flanner. 
In one other ACC game, Zahm {2-2) defeated Cavanaugh (0-4) 50· 45. 

Cavanaugh shot out to a com­manding first half lead but Zahm kept chipping away and when Zahm's Mark Palaski hit an acrobatic one-bander at the end of the half Cavanaugh's once comfortable lead was down to nine. 
In the second half Zahm's zone press and size advantage took con­trol of the game as Cavanaugh's lead was erased, Zahm prevailed 50-45. 
In ACC action today Off-Campus (3·1) will be taking on Zahm (2-2) and Alumni ( 2· 2) will be playing Dil­lon ( 3·1 ). In the Big Ten two of the league leaders will battle it out. Un­defeated Grace at 4-0, will take on third running Dillon ( 3· 1 ). In the other Big Ten game Holy Cross ( 1· 
3) will play Alumni (2·2). 
In Pac Ten action two defeated teams will do battle to see who stays in the cellar, Fisher vs. Off-Campus, while Flanner {2·2) will take on Grace ( 3·1 ).

Five-team meet cancelled

AssistantSports Editor 
Ken Barlow exploded in the 
second half last night to lead the 
Notre Dame basketball team past 
Providence College, 70-63, in the 
ACC. After scoring only two points 
in the first half of the game, Barlow 
netted 1 7 in the second period to 
help the Irish overcome a four-point 
halftime deficit and win the game. 
As the second half got underway, the crowd, which had been relatively quiet during the first half, came to life, and the team followed suit. Aggressive defense and control of the boards at both ends of the floor gave Notre Dame the edge it needed to pull away from the Friars. 
The Irish scored 11 unanswered points to open the second period, and Barlow accounted for seven points during that streak. He ended the game with a team-high 19 points and 13 rebounds. 
Irish head coach Digger Phelps said that he had explained to the 6­10 forward in the first half that he had to play more aggressively, and Barlow did just that. 
"He had the exertion to go in there and make things happen," Phelps said, "especially in the offen-· sive rebounding situations. I told him he had to be more active on the boards, and I think that's where he asserted himself. 
"When Kenny plays aggressively, he's a complete player. I thought in the second half he played as a com­plete player. He got into the game." 
Barlow explained how his rebounding helped him to get into the game after such a poor showing in the first half (two rebounds, 1-for­3 shooting). 
"In the second half, fortunately, I was able to crash and get some rebounds and get some easy bas-

Constable qualifies for NCAAs

Heavy snow and freezing temper­atures converted a scheduled five team indoor track meet into a non­scoring dual meet between Notre Dame and DePaul Friday in the ACC. 
The Irish were missing some of the top members of their team be­cause ofparticipation in the Millrose Games in New York City and the Bally Invitational in Chicago, but the meet still had some memorable moments. 
junior high jumper Uoyd Con­stable once again provided the best effort ofthe meet. Constable jumped seven feet, three and one-half inches, which qualifies him for the NCAA Indoor Track Championships on March 8 and 9. In addition, his jump broke his old Notre Dame and ACC record of 7-2, which he set just last week against Iowa. 
Constable jumped 6-8 in order to defeat teammate Chuck Unsen­mayer. He then proceeded to clear the bar at 7-0 and the record height, each on his first try. The bar was then placed at 7-'5, but Constable missed on all three attempts, but just barely on his first attempt. 
Phil Gilmore was the only Irish 

-participant to capture two events. The senior sprinter won the 60-yard da~h in a fine time of 6.49, and later posted a winning time of 32.46 for the 300-yard dash. Notre Dame freshman Chris Mat­teo and former Irish captain Perry Stow, now of the Notre Dame Track Club, provided plenty ofclose com­petition at the pole vault pit. Stow, who rank..'i third on the all time Notre Dame list, cleared 1 5-6 on his last attempt to win the event. He later missed on all three attempts at 16-0. 
Matteo looked good clearing 14-6 and 1 5-0 on his first attempt. He would have won the event because of fewer misses if Stow had failed at 1 5-6. 
Notre Dame freshman Rick Mul­vey took control of first place half way through the two mile run, and went on to win in a time of 9:43.9. The first mile had many lead changes, but once Mulvey took the lead, he never relinquished it. Mike Burns, a Notre Dame freshman, n:mained close to Mulvey and finished second in a time of9:45.3. 
Two Irish freshmen, john Dadamio and Paul Duvair, provided plenty ofexcitement on the track by holding off fast charging DePaul run­ners to win their events. Dadamio won the 880-yard run in 1:59.7, two tenths of a second ahead of Eric Camplin of DePaul. Duvair finished four tenths ofa second ahead ofCarl Webb ofDePaul to win the 600-yard dash in a time of 1:16.2. 
Irish sophomore joel Autry proved his versatility on the track and the jumping pit. He captured first place in the long jump, with a leap of twenty-two feet, three and one-half inches. He then went on to place third in both the triple jump and the 60-yard dash. 
Freshmen john Sorenson and Tom Mick were the final Irish win­ners. Sorenson captured the 60-yard high hurdles by .01 seconds with a

kets," Barlow said. "It helped my 
confidence out on my jump shot be­
cause I felt I was in the flow, and I 
was ready to score some points." 

joseph Price started off the 
scoring for the night with a 20-foot 
jumper that put the Irish on top at 
2-0. Notre Dame led by as much as 
seven points and did not trail until 
just 1:55 remained in the half. Then, 
Mathew Palazzi hit a jumper from 
the top of the key to give the Friars 
the lead at 27-25. 

Providence extended its lead to 
31-25 before Barlow hit from the 
right baseline with four seconds left 
to bring the Irish within four at the 
intermission. 

Notre Dame outrebounded the Friars by only one ( 11-10) in the first half, committed eight turnovers and shot only 48 percent from the field ( 1 0-for-21). Providence, mean­while, hit 65 percent of its shots from the floor ( 13-for-20 ). 
In the second half, however, the Irish defense became too much for the Friars to overcome, and their shooting fell to 3 7 percent ( 10-for­
27) for the half. Providence coach joe Mullaney said that Notre Dame's 
defense was only partially respon­
sible for his team's downfall, though. 
"It was a combination of their 
defense getting better the second 
half," Mullaney said, "and our In­
ability to hit the shots plus handle 
the ball well enough to get open. 
"I thought they (the Irish) picked up the defensive tempo a little bit and they made it a little tougher in the halfcourt We forced a couple (shots), and then we missed some we had. 
"It's not quite that unusual that we've had problems with our of­fense this year," the Friars' coach continued. "Defensively we usually hang in pretty welL (We had) a pretty good defensive effort against a very good team." 
Notre Dame guard David Rivers, who scored 12 points for the Irish, described how his team was able to control the game in the second half. 
"We just regrouped and tried to get them to do some things that they wouldn't normally do by pressuring them with the full-court press," Rivers said. "After our big men

Wrestlers make semis, then lose tournament 
ByJOE BRUNEm

It always seems like there is a cru­cial point in any sporting event that will affect the outcome. For Notre Dame wrestling coach Fran McCann, a series of one point defeats in this past weekend's Na­tional Catholic Collegiate Tourna­ment made all the difference in the world. 
After the Irish earned the right to 
send eight wrestlers to the semi­
finals of the two-day tournament in 
South Orange, N.j., they suffered a 
let down on Sunday and lost four 
one point matches. 

"Losing those four matches was critical," said the first-year Irish mentor. "We did a pretty good job, but we let it slip away. We had a chance to win. On the first day we did what we had to do, but we couldn't come through on the next day." 
A turnaround in those four matches would have propelled the Irish to a first place finish, instead McCann's troops had to settle for a second place finish behindjohn Car­roll University. 
Still McCann had to be pleased with the performance of his young squad. 
"We went in knowing it would be tough to win, and we knew that we would need some breaks to do it," said McCann. "We didn't have the people to be the champions, but overall there were a lot of positive things. Looking from the positive side, all the guys that placed will be back next year." 
McCann was right in saying that he didn't have the champions, and only junior john Krug wound up with an individual first place finish. Krug had a tough time in the finals, and it took him until the last minute of the match to secure the victory. 
"Krug did a nice job," McCann praised. "I told him what to do and he did it. That's great." 

However, McCann did have three other wrestlers who made it to the finals, including two freshmen, Ron Wisniewski ( 134) and Ken Kasler ( 150). Carl Hildinger, a 118-pound 
sophomore  was  the  other  Irish  
wrestler  to  advance  to  the  last  
round.  

"Hildinger did a really good job," said McCann. "He really hustled, and he just wrestled his heart out." 
Sophomore Dave Helmer was one of the wrestlers to lose a one-point semi-final match. The 177-pounder was forced to wrestle up to the 190­pound class, but he still managed to beat the number one seed in an ear­lier match.
