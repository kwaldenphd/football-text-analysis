Reagan to visit Moscow for talks with Gorbachev 
when even the most dedicated of throats leave their study hutches for fun and daylight. 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -President Reagan announced Wednesday he would go to Moscow from May 29 to June 2 for his fourth summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his first visit to a nation he once branded an "evil empire." 
The five-day visit will mark the first trip to Moscow by an American president since Richard Nixon's 1974 summer meeting with Leonid Brezhnev. Later that same year, in No­vember, Gerald Ford met with Brezhnev in the Soviet port city of Vladivostok. 
The summit's intended cen­terpiece was the signing of a 
NO Security campaign: "Saved by the Belt" 
By DEIRDRE FINN Staff Reporter 

Notre Dame Security, in con­junction with the Hoosiers for Safety Belts organization, is sponsoring a campaign to promote the use of safety belts in the University community. 
"The main goal of the cam­paign is to get everyone in the University community to wear his safety belt at all times," said Mike Shreve, a Notre Dame Security officer and one of the organizers of the cam­paign. 
The campaign focuses on the treaty to scrap 30 percent to 50 percent of the superpowers' long-range bombers, missiles and submarines. However, Reagan already has suggested an agreement will not be ready, saying time is too limited. 
Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Min­ister Eduard Shevardnadze re­ported Wednesday night that differences remained between the two sides on the accord. 
The two said in a joint state­ment they would meet again in Moscow on April 21-25 and also in May, but did not indicate where that session would be held. 
"Both sides have worked hard and some progress has 
cause they were wearing their seat belts. 
"We hope that students who are members of the club will encourage other students to wear their seat belts," said As­sistant Director of Security Phil Johnson. 
Security officers are working with state and city police to ac­tively enforce the state law re­quiring front seat passengers to wear safety belts. Drivers on city roads, who are stopped for another traffic violation, may be given a warning or ticket if they are not wearing their seat belt. Safety belt tickets, been realized in a number of areas, but much more needs to be done," the statement said. 
Shevardnadze, asked if a treaty would be ready, said through a translator: "it is pos­sible. This is not an easy task. This is a very complicated task, but we are becoming con­vinced that it is doable." 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the pres­ident would spend all of his time in the Soviet capital, fol­lowing the pattern set by Gor­bachev when he remained in Washington during his December summit with Reagan. However, first lady Nancy Reagan is planning a day trip to Leningrad. 

Buchwald delivers 'Red' Smith lecture 
By ERIC M. BERGAMO Senior Staff Reporter 
Art Buchwald, introduced as "the clown prince of American journalism," of­fered a variety of humorous insights on American politics and society during the 1988 Red Smith Lecture in Journalism at Washington Hall Wednesday night. 
Buchwald, currently a syndicated columnist for the Los Angeles Times, appears in over 500 newspapers in the 
U.S. and abroad. 

"It is no accident that after you had the president of the United States speak to you two weeks ago, that the Red Smith lecture series would ask a humorist to tell you what he said," Buch­wald started his speech, 

Strasen awarded 'Red' Smith scholarship

Strasen, who currently serves as sports editor of bringing the first of many outbursts of laughter throughout the lecture. 
Ronald Reagan was a common target for Buch­wald's humor during the lec­ture. 
"I worship the very quick­sand he walks on," Buch­wald said. "Reagan's greatest feat is to make the country feel good about things that are bad." 
Mter reciting the Gipper's deathbed scene from "Knute Rockne-All American," Buchwald told the audience "I have good news for you, the Gipper isn't dead. He's alive and well and taking a nap during dinner at the White House."

Noriega attempts to expel 
U.S. economic adviser 
Associated Press 
PANAMA CITY, Panama­
A U.S. diplomat was given 48 hours to leave Panama on Wed­nesday, the third day of a gen­eral strike that has virtually shut down the country but has not loosened Gen. Manuel Noriega's grip on power. 
David Miller, an economics counselor, was the second American diplomat ordered out by the Foreign Ministry, which gave no reason for its decision. 
In Washington, the State De­partment said Wednesday night it would ignore the order because the United States con­siders the government that issued it illegitimate. It gave the same reason for rejecting the previous order against Terence Kneebone, head of the 
U.S. Information Service in Panama, who remains in the country. 
Panama is out of cash be­cause Washington cut off the supply of U.S. dollars, the Panamanian national cur­rency, in its effort to drive Noriega into exile. Federal grand juries in Florida indicted Noriega last month on nar-

Some opposition leaders were frustrated Wednesday that the general strike had not loosened Noriega's grip on the bankrupt nation. 
"We're well aware of the sit­uation, that Gen. Noriega ap­pears unmoved by all the human suffering," Jose Mulino, an attorney, said at a news con­ference. "We'll be considering new strategies. I'm not sure what it will take," Mulino said.

Economy expanding; prices show slight rise 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The gov­ernment delivered two wel­come pieces of economic news on Wednesday: consumer prices rose just 0.2 percent in February and the economy in late 1987 expanded at the liveliest pace in nearly two years. 
Falling energy and food prices in February helped restrain the rise in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index after a 0.3 percent in­crease in January. 
For the first two months of the year, prices increased at an annual rate of 3.2 percent ­much better than last year's moderate 4.4 percent inflation. 
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew at a brisk 4.8 percent annual pace in the final three months of last year. It was the second upward revision in the fourth-quarter GNP, estimated a month ago at 4.5 percent and _in January at 4.2 percent. 
The department said better­than-expected performance in exports, consumer spending and business investment led to the latest revision, which pushed growth for the year to a rate of 4 percent, compared with 2.2 percent growth in 1986. It was the biggest annual in­crease since a 5.1 percent rise in 1984. 
The 4.8 percent fourth quar­ter growth followed a 4.3 per­cent growth in the July­September quarter and was the fastest quarterly growth rate since an increase of 5.4 percent in the first three months of 1986. 
Recent economic reports have shown ~m economy that rebounded quickly from last October's stock market col­lapse. Analysts see little likelihood of an election-year recession.

Random Indiana truck check finds serious safety defects 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS-A random check of trucks traveling Hoosier interstates last week showed that 42 percent had serious safety defects, the Indiana State Police said Wednesday. 
Inspectors at eight checkpoints last Thursday looked at 647 trucks and or­dered 270 out of service until defects were corrected, according to Sgt. Guy Boruff of the state police motor carrier division. 
Missing or defective front brakes ac­counted for 44 of the out-of-service cita­tions, Boruff said. 
The other top categories of serious 
violations involved inoperative lights 
and defective tires, Boruff said. 
Inspectors spotted nearly 2,500 viola­tions, or an average of almost four for every truck inspected, Boruff said. Trucks with less serious violations weren't ordered out of service. 
"We're concerned as a state agency," Boruff said of the survey fin­dings. "But we do feel our inspection program is having an impact." 
The 42 percent figure was up from October, when the last random inspec­tion was conducted at the request of the Federal Highway Administration. 
Some 31 percent of trucks inspected last fall were ordered out of service, Boruff said. The increase in this round of inspections could be attributed to more inspectors on the job and better training of what to look for, said Boruff. 
The Notre Dame Concert Band performed their annual Spring Concert in the Joyce Athletic 
and Convocation Center on Wednesday.

officials in Reagan's ad­minstration who said the Iran­Contra scandal was to help "moderate Iranians." 
"In case you are wondering what a moderate Iranian is, it's an Iranian who has run out of ammunition," Buchwald ex­plained. 
Reagan will also go down in history as "the Great Com­municator, even though he keeps getting his facts wrong," he added. 
Buchwald had targets other than Reagan to attack with his satirical barbs. 
An economist "is someone who will tell you 1,000 ways how to make love, but doesn't know any women," he said. 
Buchwald told of an Amtrak adminstrator who was so de­pressed over cuts in his budget that he lay down on the train tracks between Washington, 
D.C. and Philadelphia and waited for a train to run him over. 
"Fourteen hours later, he got hungry and decided to go home," he said. 
The trade deficit could be 
taken  care  of  by  "making  
every  Japanese  businessman  
go  to  the  Harvard  Business  

School, so they'll be as screwed up as we are," Buchwald said. 
Some items in the news are so bizarre Buchwald admitted even he couldn't make them up. 
As an example, Buchwald told of the Sultan of Brunei who believed he was giving $10 mil­lion dollars to the contras. Ollie North gave the sultan a Swiss bank account number that was wrong and the money ended up 
in  the  account  of  a  Swiss  
gentleman  who  spent  the  
money.  

"When asked why he spent it (the money), he said, 'I thought it was mine.' I could not make that up," Buchwald said. 
"Then you take the Jimmy Swaggart story," Buchwald continued. "I made that up." 
Buchwald also elicited laughs from the audience at the expense of Notre Dame. 
Buchwald had asked Notre Dame to send some informa­tion about the campus before his lecture. The University complied by sending a book on undergraduate courses and the decidedly larger football press guide. 
Buchwald also noted how on previous trips to Notre Dame, people who asked him if he liked the campus became dis­appointed when he answered "fine."

"Many of the students think that it's not necessary to wear their seat belts because they don't leave campus or go very far from campus, but it's a nec­essary precaution," said Shreve. 
"Our main concern is with the safety of drivers and their passengers, not with giving tickets," said Shreve. 
The university had a similar campaign following the institu­tion of the state law last July. 
"We felt this was an appro­priate time to emphasize the issue again since there are more students at school now and a lot of them will be travel­ing this spring," said Johnson.

We all ask far too little of God, and we forget that friendship is a two-way street. But this thing we call "religion," our Catholic faith, is and must be about friendship with God, or it is about noth­ing at all. 
Thomas D'Andrea 
guest column 

Perhaps the time we are farthest from realizing this is during the season of Lent. Lent, after all, has its demands­-more religious obligations. So, if we have some vague sense of the meaning and purpose of Lent, we grit our teeth and give up a few things. The spirit with which we do this is far from ex­emplary. It is as if Lent brought with it a new burden, one added to our weekly chore of having to shuffle off to Mass on Sundays. Of course this is en­tirely the wrong picture of the forty days, but we have to understand, we must understand, what is wrong with it. We must understand why this dim view of Lent is a product of our own dimness, dullness and self-absorption, and not the characteristic of an other­wise splendid season. 
Lent, we have heard, is a time for conversion of the heart. If this is true, there is at least one startling conse­quence that follows from it. God, that Being who created us, even, out of a very peculiar love, enfleshed Himself and occupied our frankly small portion of reality (and hammered nails, and payed taxes, and died, we mustn't for­get, a frightful and humiliating death for our eternal well-being) does not want mere external sacrifices during Lent. The worth of a gift, after all, is not strictly equivalent to the difficulty one has in giving it; a gift is not to be prized solely or even primarily to the degree it inconveniences its giver. Un­doubtedly, a gift's true worth has some­thing to do with the sentiment, the in­tention, with which it is given. (The tired old "It's the thought that counts" suggests this.) 
So during Lent God wants more of what is on the inside--more real affec­tion, or if that sounds too sentimental, more real friendship. He wants more of the heart and less going-through-the­motions-to-avoid-guilt attention. God, after all, matters much more than our excessively self-directed concerns. If we miss the opportunity to grow in friendship with our Creator during the season of Lent we alone are to blame. 
How then can we strengthen that friendship in the two remaining weeks before Easter? I've heard of a practice common but a generation or two ago that could be just the thing to redeem an otherwise unspectacular (i.e. not be­cause unnoticed but because lifeless) Lent. At Notre Dame we are blessed with, among other things, more taber­nacles per square foot (per acre?) than probably anywhere. Now it is one of the shocking truths of our faith that Christ, fully God, fully man, resides, as man and as God, with soul and body, in each of the tabernacles where there is a con­secrated host (an amazing friend this infinite, all-powerful being who limits Himself so). 
It used to be that in the course of entering or leaving one's dorm during the day one would stop by the chapel and acknowledge God's presence (no small thing)--perhaps converse a bit (true friends are never lacking in topics of conversation), at no less thank Him for that tremendous love which loved us into existence, loves us through time and loves us, hopefully, to complete happiness in the beyond. Is such a prac­tice too ambitious for us? Are we so lacking in courage that we are in­capable of doing this? Are we not too busy? But surely once a day, one time leaving the dorm and once in entering, would not be too much for us. 
What a great resolution with which to end Lent! God will be happy--He will have won a bit of our hearts; we will be happy, having overcome self­inflicted formalism and engaged in something interior and authentic and eminently manageable, and Lent won't be such a gloomy affair after all. Who knows what good things might come out of such spontaneous trafficking of friends (an all-powerful being is a good friend to have) ... ? 
Besides, a heart is a terrible thing to waste (on oneself).

Lowe plummets with 'Pinker' 
KEVIN WALSH accent writer 

N 
lck Lowe has always been sort of a confusing dude. What Is he? He's put out a few great albums. He's written a few great songs. He's a recog­nized producer and a com­petent bassist. He's not a real college radio favorite. He's not a critical favorite anymore. Not since "Cruel To Be Kind" has he had any real popularity. 
The music doesn't help mat­ters either. In one album, It can be country, rock and roll, reggae, garage, or blues. You name it. His songs are, by turn, deathly serious and overly goofy. Who is this guy? 
Well, unfortunately the answers aren't found on "Pinker And Prouder Than Pre­vious." Even the title makes no sense. It is his first album in almost three years and the seventh in his spotty career. His last effort "Rose of En­gland," was one of the under­appreciated gems of 1985. Here, he just sounds confused. 
It Immediately struck me as a real disjointed album, and one glance at the back sleeve reveals that all these songs 
were recorded in either London 
or Austin, Texas, between 
spring of 1986 and early 1987. 
I don't know why he waited so 
long to put It out unless he 
realized how scattered it was 
and was waiting for some 
Divine Inspiration that never 
came. 
Only five of the eleven songs here are "pure" Lowe. Two are co-written, and the other four are covers of other people's songs. Lowe has always had great taste in other people's songs, and this album Is no exception. This Is the first Lowe album I've ever heard where the covers blow away Nick's originals. 
The first song he covers Is the fourth song on the album. It Is undoubtedly the album's only transcendent moment. The song Is "Love Gets Strange," written by John Hiatt whose "She Don't Love Nobody" stood out on Lowe's last album and whose own latest album, "Bring The Fam­Ily" (on which Lowe plays), is still drawing critical praise. "Love Gets Strange" Is a mid­tempo workout featuring Hiatt's own great rhythm guitar work. It has lines like, "This love Is like a wrestling match," and 

"There ain't no window 
open...and there is no door to 
get out of before this love gets 
strange." For the first time one 
the album, Lowe sounds com­
fortable. Unfortunately, it 
doesn't last long. 
The other cover songs range from Graham Parker's sleek "Black Lincoln Continental," a sort of bubble-gum punk shout to Lawton Williams' simple country skiftle "Geisha Girl" and finally to the last song "Big Big Love" which sounds like the songs Lowe used to write. Corny, but with a knowing wink and a shrug. 
The real Lowe songs sound almost unfalteringly like some­body else's. On both "Crying In My Sleep" and "I Got The Love," Lowe's ugly Everly! Brot­hers obsession rears Its white little head. Nick might have been better served by just handing these two over to the real Phil and Don. 
"Lover's Jamboree," which was co-written with AOR won­derboy wanna-be Paul Carrack. sounds like every song Dave Edmunds has ever written and, of course, there's ol' Dave guest-producing this one. Yawn. 

Other songs range from failed jokes ("Big Hair") to decent, yet muddled attempts at roadhouse blues ("(You're My) Wildest Dream"). 
On only two of his own songs does Lowe show what he's capable of. The first Is "Cry It Out." a lilting. reggaetountry fusion that sounds like the "White Album" era Paul McCartney turned on to Bob Marley. It works purely on the basis of its lyrical and musical simplicity. The other song that shows Lowe worth his proverbial salt is "Wishing Well." Opening with a gnashing reverb guitar line and joined by "The Men They Couldn't Hang." Lowe rises to the occasion In a song about a guy who wishes he left his girl where he found her, "down by the wishing well" where "her perfume, like a promise, stole my reason." He needs more like these. 
Overall, this album is really disappointing. Lowe Is already sinking sadly Into the bottom­less bargain bin In the sky and, though "Pinker and Prouder Than Previous" shows that he can still pull It off when he wants to, It does nothing to brake that descent.

Golf team heads to EKU 
Tourney follows impressive showing in Florida trip 
By WILLIAM STEGMEIER 
Sports Writer 
Coming off an impressive showing in Florida over Spring Break, the Notre Dame Varsity golf team will compete in the Eastern Kentucky University Spring Golf Classic this weekend. 
Golf teams from the Big Ten and Mid-American confer­ences, as well as major in­dependents from District IV, comprise the 18-team field for this 54-hole event. Notre Dame a combined total of 307, out­shooting Embry-Riddle by five shots. Junior Pat Mohan led the way with a round of 73. 

Next up for the Irish was the Palm Coast Intercollegiate, where Notre Dame got to play at the Arnold Palmer-designed Matanzas Woods and Pine Lakes courses, as well as at Palm Harbor. The team shot combined scores of 332, 320 and 316 at the courses, respective­ly, with the round of 320 coming in a downpour at Matanzas Woods.

KSU coach 
Associated Press 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. ­
Purdue's Gene Keady and Kansas State's Lon Kruger, whose basketball teams play Friday night in the NCAA Mid­west Regional semifinals, have a lot in common. 
Both are native Kansans, both are graduates of Kansas State, both began their coach­ing careers in Kansas and both have a tremendous admiration for the other. 
"He's someone you like to see win ... except for this game," says Keady. 
This game at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., of course, is the next to last hurdle to a trip to the Final Four. And those games, appropriately, will be in Kansas City. 
"Lonnie's team is a clone of what he was like as a player (at Kansas State)," said· Keady. "They play hard, they play smart and they can shoot it. And he coaches a lot like Co­ach (Jack) Hartman." 
Kruger was the Big Eight Conference player of the year in 1973 and 1974, leading the Wildcats to conference titles under Hartman, a man Keady credits for much of his own bas­ketball philosophy. 
By the time Kruger was in college, Keady was well into his coaching careeer at Hutchin­

 son (Kan.) Junior College . From there, Keady moved to Arkansas, Western Kentucky and Purdue. Kruger, mean­while, became an assistant to Hartman at Kansas State, then head coach at Pan American and, two years ago, succeeded
-
Hartman at his alma mater. 
"I've known Coach Keady for a long time, ever since I was in college," Kruger says. "I've followed his teams wherever he's been. And I've always had a great deal of respect for how tough-minded and well­disciplined his teams are." 
Purdue beat Kansas State 101-72 last December in Mackey Arena.
