The Shovv is dee111ed a success 
By MEGAN O'NEIL 
News Writer 
The Show headliners Talib Kweli and Jason Mraz impressed fans and non-fans alike Friday night with ener­getic performances that includ­ed impromptu stage appear­ances by several students. 
Rapper Kweli opened the show with a high-energy num­ber. The lesser known of the night's performers, some stu­dents complained about Kweli's lack of notoriety. 
"I didn't really know his music," said freshman Shawn Redington. "No one seemed to know his songs." 
For many audience members however, his performance more than made up for a lack of familiarity with his songs. 
"I was very impressed by him," said junior Shannon Morfin. "I didn't even really know who he was and I don't normally like that type of music that much. but now I am think­ing about buying his CD." 
Midway into Kweli's set, he asked students to come on stage. When security stopped them because of safety con­cerns, the rapper threatened to end his performance, turned off his equipment and walked off the stage. Security quickly relented and Kweli invited the dancers to join him up on stage. 
Student reaction to Mraz, who reportedly was spotted at Turtle Creek socializing with students later that night, was more unanimous. lie wowed a largely female audience with his distinct voice and dance moves.

Livestrong bands make bold statement 
Students wear eye-catching 
yellow wristbands in

By JANICE FLYNN 
News Writer 
Actors Matt Damon and Bruce Willis have them. Both President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry do too. Olympians have won gold in Athens wearing them. And, most likely, several have caught your eye in theology class or around LaFortune. 
They are the bright yellow wrist­bands emblazoned with the mantra "Livestrong," a joint product of The Lance Armstrong Foundation and Nike to raise money for cancer research. 
The sturdy elastic wristbands pay tribute to Tour de France champi­on and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong. Since hitting the stores in May, sales have taken off wildly, far surpassing the initial goal of $5 million. The current tally of sales
Five men from Siegfried Hall show off their Livestrong arm bands. The bands have become so popular, many students are having trouble finding places to buy them. Even online, all orders are on backorder, causing quite a stir about the rubber bracelets.

Legends revamps restaurant and club

lleading into its second year of operation, Legends' atti­tude is like that of any new business: eliminate the weak­nesses and work on enhanc­ing the strengths. 
With plans to change both the tastes and decor of the restaurant, Legends Manager Jim Quirk said they have taken a holistic approach to ensuring change. 
"As we enter year two we hope the word's gotten around and [we can again] offer stu­dents and non-students alike a place to congregate and socialize and enjoy a casual atmosphere," Quirk said. 
After a summer of large­scale reassessment, Legends plans to revamp both inside and out. 
Improvements start with enhancing the menu, and they have brought in the University's newly appointed executive chef, Don Miller, to do it. 
Miller, who has 28 years of experience, completely over­hauled last year's menu, Quirk said.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Bridging the m.usical gap 
Somehow, I landed the most cushy on-campus job at Saint Mary's College. As the choral librarian, I get my own little office, set my own hours, have a great boss and often don't have to Nicole Zook work for weeks at a time. When 
Production
I do, I just crank 
up the tunes and Editor 
do my thing. 
So imagine my 
surprise when a random professor 
wandered into my basement office 
this week. He was confused not to 
find my boss there. 
"You're the one listening to 
Simon and Garfunkel?" he asked in 
astonishment. "This is our genera­
tion's music." 
So that's what it comes down to. 
All the strange looks from my peers 
at stoplights, all the comments 
from my mom about how my music 
is before her time -it all points to 
the one thing this professor so 
clearly stated. 
I've bridged some kind of unspo­
ken generation gap in music. 
Sure, I like rap. I listen to metal, pop, punk, and even country. But only classic rock hits me where it counts. New music can be great, but nowhere in the realm of Avril Lavigne can you find the lyricism of Paul Simon or Billy Joel. The inno­vation of The Beatles is lost on kids today. And it's impossible for me to find a modern band that can elicit the same mellow cool as Pink Floyd or the same hard rocking mood as ACIDC. 
I know where my love of good music came from, of course. My parents are young, and as a kid I listened to the same music they did. I knew all the words to every Bon Jovi record by the time I was two. I grew up listening to my dad's favorite classic rock radio station. My mom trained me in the fine art of attending concerts. My folks still rock harder than any parents I know. 

But somewhere along the line, r went past that. r reached back to before their time, looking to The Doors for a rainy day and Jimi Hendrix for long car drives. Styx, Clapton, Elton John, CCR, Zep, Journey, Aerosmith, The Who, Bob Dylan and The Boss -I began to amass a huge record collection. 
Older people still act amazed when they catch me listening to "their music," and all of my little brothers "don't get it." It's strange to think that they don't know the classic songs of the last fifty years, and maybe never will. People our age have been known to mock me for listening to "old people's music." 
In the car Friday night before the obligatory visit to Rally, I told my friends they could take out my tape and listen to more party appropri­ate music. The car was silent for a minute, until they said, "Actually, we like James Taylor." 

At that moment, I knew I was not standing alone in the middle of the generation gap.

According to this week's issue of The Lancet medical journal, the German doctors used a mesh cage, a growth chemical and the patient's bone marrow, containing stem cells, to create a new jaw bone that fit the gap left by the cancer surgery. 
Tests have not been done yet to verify whether the bone was created by the blank-slate stem cells and it is too early to tell whether the jaw will function normal­ly in the long term. The operation is the first pub­lished report of a whole bone being engineered and incu­bated inside a patient's body and transplanted.

Thousands of Malaysians have visited the mall to observe Nur Malena in the room, which she leaves just once a day for a 15-minute bathroom break.

Community celebrates mass 
By DANIELLE LERNER News Writer 
Members of the Saint Mary's College community celebrated the new academic year with the annual All Campus Mass Sunday. Filling every seat, students, staff and faculty gathered to exemplify the unity of Saint Mary's in the Church of Loretto. 
Father David Tyson presided over the ceremony. In congruence with the new school year, he reflected upon the gifts of wisdom, knowl­edge and faith throughout his sermon.

of hope for the College. 
"We do so [celebrate] here at Saint Mary's as a commu­nity bettered on wisdom and we pray that Saint Mary's College continues to open the minds and hearts of these women." 
College President Carol Ann Mooney thanked those in attendance with her closing words. 
"For Catholics, there is no more visible sign of unity than the mass," Mooney said. "We gather not to refuel but to celebrate the many grace­filled moments in our lives. I pray we cherish not only wis­dom of the empirical and analytical type, but also the deep and profound wisdom that comes to us through faith." 
Clad in Saint Mary's appar­el, students participated in the spirit and unity of the col­lege. 
"I enjoy going to mass and can see that Saint Mary's is a tight knit community where everyone looks out for one another," said freshman Ashley Currie. 
For seniors like Allison Nickerson and Katie Murphy, mass served as the kick off to their final year as students. 
"It's our last year and we love our school," they said. "It's a good way to start out the year as a community and it will be sad when it's over for us."

Asteroid nallled in honor of ND trustee 
Physics professor returns an old favor to alumnus Ray Siegfried 
Special to The Observer The International Astro­nomical Union has named an asteroid in honor of Ray Siegfried, a graduate, trustee and benefactor of the University of Notre Dame. Discovered March 11, 2000, by the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search pro­gram in Flagstaff, Ariz., the asteroid currently is in the con­stellation of Gemini near two bright stars, Pollux and Castor. The suggestion to honor Siegfried came from Terrence Rettig, professor of physics at Notre Dame. The two met in the mid-1990s when Siegfried's daughter, Milann, took an introductory astrono­my class taught by Rettig. Siegfried arranged for former astronaut Gen. Thomas Stafford to speak to the class, a favor Rettig always remem­bered. When Rettig learned of Siegfried's battle with amy­otrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's Disease), he thought the naming of an asteroid would be an unusual and sig­
nificant way to honor and thank Siegfried. 
The IAU formally announced the naming of Asteroid Siegfried, as well as three other recently discovered asteroids, on July 13. Another Notre Dame figure, president emeritus Father Theodore M. Hesburgh, also has an asteroid named in his honor. 
A 1965 Notre Dame gradu­ate, Siegfried is chairman of the board of the NORDAM Group, a Tulsa, Okla. aero­space firm with 2,000 employ­ees and facilities in four states and several other nations. 
Siegfried has served on the boards of numerous profes­sional, civic, educational. phil­anthropic and other organiza­tions. He is a member of both the Tulsa and Oklahoma Halls of Fame and was honored by his alma mater in 1995 with an honorary doctor of laws degree. 
The Siegfrieds have made numerous contributions to Notre Dame, including funds for a men's residence hall. a chaired professorship and the Siegfried wing of Mendoza College of Business. The Siegfrieds are the parents of six children, five of whom are Notre Dame graduates.

Freshman Brett Adams agreed. 
"[He] put on a great show,'' said Adams. "I hadn't really heard his music much, but it was still pretty cool." 
Much to the audience's excite­ment, Mraz also shared the stage with students at one point in the show. Three fans familiar with the lyrics were invited to help him sing his best-known song, "The Remedy," karaoke style. 
An annual event, The Show's goal is to bring in big-name per­formers while keeping tickets prices affordable. Although its effectiveness is often questioned. the event is presented to students as an alternative to Rally in the Alley and drinking, according to show chairman Jimmy Flaherty. 
This year, in addition to Rally in the Alley, The Show faced a scheduling conflict with the inau­gural pre-season football scrim­mage. Flaherty said the scrim­mage was mislabeled as competi­tion for the show. 
According to Flaherty, the com­mittee had been working with the Athletic department since July to co-promote the events. While Flaherty was unable to provide a specific number, he described turnout for The Show as "unbe­lievable." 
"The director of student activi­ties and vice president of student affairs were more than thrilled with the attendance," said Flaherty.

Suicide bomber blasts poll station 
GROZNY. Russia -The Russian govern­ment's choice for president of war-ravaged Chechnya appeared to be the victor Sunday in an election tainted by charges of fraud and shadowed by last week's terrorist destruction of two airliners.

Violence shadowed the balloting. A man blew himself up near a polling station after trying to enter it carrying a package, officials said. Worries about terrorism were stoked by the crashes of two Russian airliners five days before the election; officials said traces of explosives were found in the wreckage, and there are suspicions two Chechen women conducted the suicide attacks.

Republican National Convention sparks 100,000 protesters to rally in Manhattan 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Bearing flag-draped boxes resem­bling coffins and fly-swat­ters with President Bush's image, more than 100,000 protesters swarmed Man­hattan's streets Sunday on the eve of the Republican National Convention to demand that the president be turned out of office. 
Flanked by police in riot gear. the protesters moved through the fortified city, loudly and exuberantly chanting slogans such as "No more years." They accused the White House of waging an unjust war in Iraq, making the country poorer and undermining abortion rights. 
There were no reports of major violence and about 200 scattered arrests. most of them unconnected to the main protest. 
Police gave no official crowd estimate, though one law enforcement offi­cial, speaking on condition of anonymity, put the crowd at 120,000; organiz­ers claimed it was roughly 400,000. In either case, experts said it was the largest protest ever at a

AFGHANISTAN 


Car bomb leaves multiple casualties 
Associated Press KABUL-A powerful car bomb detonated outside the office of a 
U.S. security contractor in the Afghan capital Sunday, killing at least seven people, including two Americans, and wounding several others, officials and witnesses said. 
Hours earlier, a blast wrecked a religious school in southeastern Afghanistan, reportedly killing at least eight children and one adult and underlining the country's frag­ile security as it moves toward its first post-Taliban election in October. 
Security officials have issued sev­eral warnings in recent weeks about possible car bombings and suicide attacks in the Afghan capi­tal. NATO forces patrolling Kabul have warned that anti-government militants, including the ousted Taliban, could try to mount spectac­ular attacks in a bid to disrupt the landmark presidential election scheduled for Oct. 9. 
The Kabul explosion hit the office of Dyncorp Inc.. an American firm that provides security for Afghan President Hamid Karzai and works for the U.S. government in Iraq, said Nick Downie of the Afghanistan NCO Security Office. 
"The explosion ... killed at least seven people," Karzai's office said in a statement. "Two Americans. three Nepalese and two Afghan nationals, including a child, have been confirmed dead." 
Karzai and U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad expressed shock at the bombing. 
An American embassy statement said the contractor also was involved in a project to train Afghan police, a key element of the internationally backed plan to pre­vent the country from reverting to a haven for al-Qaida militants.

Associated Press WASHINGTON -It looks as though Congress will have

Neither Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, H-Tenn., nor House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-IlL, is sure the job will be done by Election Day, Nov. 2. 
"We are going to progress over the next 30 days," Frist said Sunday. "The president of the United States has delivered a directive to us and to the Congress, yester­day (in his radio address) to the American people. It will be much more specific, we predict, in about 10 days."

Associated Press BIG BEAR LAKE. Calif. -In the mountains of Southern California, it's the new sound of summer: the whine of a chain saw followed by the whoosh and thud of a falling tree. Logging crews are moving through neighborhoods and across densely forested hill­sides, racing to cut as many dead and dying trees as they can before the area erupts in flames. It's a battle no one expects to win this year -and perhaps not anytime soon. "We have an extremely haz­ardous situation out there even though we've made a lot of progress," said San Bernardino County Fire Chief Peter Hills. Drought and infestations of bark beetles have killed mil­lions of trees in the forests of San Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego counties. posing a major threat in what has been called an extremely dangerous fire season. Last year, the same condi­tions fueled the most destruc­tive wildfires in state history. Throughout Southern California, 15 blazes killed 24 people while scorching 750,000 acres and destroying 3,673 homes and businesses. Despite the devastation, plenty of fuel is still available. Vast areas of dead trees are visible as rust-colored streaks amid the pine-covered moun­

tains. 
If they aren't removed, the trees "will go up like fireworks on the Fourth of July," said Thomas Meixner, an assistant professor in the environmental sciences department of the University of California at Riverside. 
"It's going to burn eventually. All you can do is reduce the risk," he said. 
The effort to clear the trees is part of a broader wildfire strategy that includes station­ing of additional firefighters in the tinder-dry forest region and increased training, Hills said. 
Forest thinning has sparked bitter battles in the Sierra Nevada and other parts of the West. Environmentalists argue that such projects are often a backdoor to wholesale logging in sensitive areas or increase fire danger by spreading debris and destroying fire­resistant large trees. 
No one, however, disputes that the drought and bark bee­tles, which kill trees by cutting off their flow of water and nutrients, have created a huge problem in Southern California. 
Environmental groups such as the Sierra Club endorse dead tree removal from around mountain communities in San Bernardino, Hiverside, San Diego and Los Angeles counties as a way to reduce the danger to the public and firefighters.

IN BRIEF 
Tribes unite to open casino in Ohio 
DAYfON, Ohio -The federally recognized Shawnee tribe has given its support to the Eastern Shawnee tribe of Oklahoma in its effort to open casinos in Ohio. 
Shawnee tribe officials say they do not plan to get directly involved, but do not object to the Eastern Shawnee tribe's efforts. The Miami, Oklahoma-based Shawnee tribe said they currently have no plans to reclaim lands in Ohio. 
The tribe's business council unanimously passed a resolution in July supporting the Eastern Shawnee's economic development efforts in Ohio. 
"It gives the Shawnee people more clout when you have two tribes instead of just one for legislation purposes with the state," said Terry Casey, a Columbus consultant with National Capital 1, which represents the Eastern Shawnee tribe. 
National Capital 1 is preparing a land claim of at least four million acres for the Eastern Shawnee and wants to establish five to seven casinos, Casey said. 
Gas prices escalate a second time 
LOS ANGELES -Gas prices nudged upward about half a penny in the last two weeks after dropping more than 20 cents since May 21, but another price spike is not expected due to a decline in crude oil prices, an industry ana­lyst said Sunday. 
The combined national average for all grades of gasoline was $1.91, said Trilby Lundberg, who publishes the semimonthly Lundberg Survey. The price was up from $1.90 on Aug. 13. 
The survey, taken Friday, polls about 7,000 gas stations across the United States. 
Lundberg said the slight upsurge came from an increase in crude oil, which peaked Aug. 19 at $48.70 before falling to $43.18. 
Self-serve regular, the biggest seller, was $1.88. Mid-grade national average was $1.97 and the U.S. average of premium was $2.07. 
"Crude oil's price cut will be working its way to the pump," Lundberg said, adding that unless there were an actual loss of crude oil supply, pump prices will "be sliding down into Labor Day and beyond."

Stocks rise modestly in trading 
A sluggish GDP exceeds estimates as falling oil prices affect the market favorably 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Investors sent stocks modestly higher Friday, embracing a slug­gish gross domestic prod­uct reading that was nonetheless better than expected, hoping that falling oil prices would help spur the economy. The major indexes all finished the week higher. 
The 2.8 percent GOP growth in the second quar­ter, a revision from the 3 percent preliminary figure reported in July, is a far cry from the 4.5 percent growth in the first quarter. However, the figure was slightly better than the 2.7 percent expansion econo­mists had forecast. That gave investors hope that this week's drop in oil prices could spark stronger economic growth for the current quarter. 
Still, with the Republican National Convention next week and traditionally slow trading in August, volume on the major markets remained extremely low _ it was the lightest trading day of the year on the New York Stock Exchange _ and any boost in stocks would be seen as tentative at best, analysts said.

France seeks release of two Mideast hostages 
Kidnappers call for an end to France's ban on Islamic head-scarves 
Associated Press 
PARIS -President Jacques Chirac dispatched his foreign minister to the Middle East on Sunday to work for the release of two French reporters abduct­ed in Iraq, vowing to spare no effort to free them from kidnap­pers demanding the France scrap its ban on Islamic head scarves in state schools.

within 48 hours. 
"France ensures equality, the respect and pro­tection of the free practicing of all· religions," a solemn-looking Chirac said in a televised address. "These values of respect and tolerance inspire our actions everywhere in the world ... They also inspired France's policy in Iraq." 
The kidnapping proved false the notion that France's opposi­tion to the Iraq war and its gen­erally pro-Arab policies may to some extent have inoculated it from Islamic terrorism. 
The militants claiming to hold Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot described the head­scarf law as "an aggression on the Islamic religion and person­al freedoms," according to the Arab TV station Al-Jazeera. 
The station showed a brief tape on Saturday of the journal­ists saying they were in captivi­ty -the first word on their fate since they disappeared more than a week ago. Chesnot works for Radio France­Internationale and Radio France and Malbrunot for RTL radio and the dailies Le Figaro and Ouest-France. 
Chirac said Foreign Minister Michel Barnier was rushing to the Middle East "to develop the necessary contacts there and coordinate our representatives' efforts" to win the reporters' release. 
"Everything is being done and everything will be done in the hours and days to come," said Chirac. He said France has no fresh information about the reporters.

Prime Minister 
Jean-Pierre 
Raffarin indicat­ed that France is using its con­tacts in the Arab world to seek the men's release. He met min­isters and Chirac on Sunday to coordinate the government's response. 
The headscarf law, which will take effect when school resumes this week following the summer break, forbids public school students from wearing "conspicuous" signs showing their religious affiliation. While that includes Jewish skullcaps and large Christian crosses, French authorities made clear that the measure was aimed at removing Islamic head scarves from classrooms. 
The law was adopted in March with overwhelming sup­port from lawmakers from across the political spectrum. But it sparked protests by Muslims in France and abroad, with many saying Islam was being unfairly targeted. 
Athens celebrates successful Olympics 
Associated Press 
ATHENS, Greece -If anyone deserved a party, it was the people of Athens. 
The name went out on the Olympics during a closing cere­mony Sunday night that hon­ored the birthplace of the games with an ebullient display of Greek pride and symbolism, a relief-filled celebration of the ancient and the new. 
Famed Greek singer George Dalaras serenaded the crowd. Dancers danced, arms folded, legs kicking high, during an enactment of a traditional Greek wedding. Fireworks exploded over the stadium packed full with 70,000 fans who waved twinkling strobes they were given to light up the show. 
Hundreds of athletes from many of the 202 countries that participated mingled in the cen­ter of the stadium and paraded their flags -Canadian and Swiss, American and Brazilian around the floor. They were ringed by a cadre of security guards, and a white security blimp hovered overhead, just two of the strong reminders of how much the world has changed since the Sydney Games four years ago. 
Later, the huge white torch that burned brightly over the stadium for 17 days was low­ered and symbolic remnants of the flame were passed to the people of Beijing, where the games will be held in 2008. 
China's capital city put on a short ceremony filled with a preview of what's to come. Chinese string instruments played and red-clad martial arts performers romped around the stage. Elaborately clad women wearing headdresses walked out on stilts. A giant, red lantern popped up and, while a young Chinese girl sang, a banner was unfurled that said "Welcome to Beijing."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Questioning class officers' decisions 
A new school year has begun and some time has passed since April 1st. when our new class officers took their positions. I'd like to reflect a little on the new Sophomore Class Officers, who are President Jason Laws (Fisher), Vice President Bill Andrichik (Stanford), Treasurer Laura Horne (Howard) and Secretary Megan Spokes (Farley). After holding office for a some time now, it's important that we look at how they have handled their positions thus far. 
Who am I to judge the new class officers? I was once one of their col­leagues -I was the St. Edward's representative to Freshman Class Council. As Freshman Class Spiritual Commissioner, I, along with my fellow commit­tee members, was part of one of the most active and successful committees in our class council. Despite my leadership and our committee's success, I was denied the opportunity to serve the Class of 2007 as Spiritual Chairman, and was even denied a spot as a regular council member. Who was selected to take my place? A new member to council without previous council experi­ence from Stanford. the home dorm of the class's current Vice President. 
And what's worse about the choices made by the new officers? Nearly one out of three dorms on campus go unrepresented on council. According to the Class of 2007 Web site, Alumni, Dillon, Keough, Morrissey, Siegfried, Zahm, Cavanaugh and Lyons have no representation on council at all. When important decisions need to be made about class activities, the members of these dorms, which account for well over 1/3 of the members of the Class of 2007 will have no say in what goes on whatsoever. 
Further, several dorms have unfair representation at the other end-they have more members than many other dorms. An example of this unsurpris­ingly comes from Stanford, again the home of the current Vice President, which has four representatives on council out of the 35 total members. Lewis and Welsh Family also have four reps and the other unmentioned dorms have one or two representatives. 
What's more? Of the six new chairmen that the new officers chose for the six committees on council, only one was a chairman or even a member of Freshman Council. So we will have one effective committee led by an experi­enced chairperson while there will be five other committees who will effec­tively have to start from scratch. This is more than a misjudgment by the current officers-it is politicizing of the issue. It is obvious that some posi­tions were given in the interest of favors to friends rather than in the inter­est of the Class of 2007. ti.: ~ .~ , 
The question about all of this is not whether the officers should have been more thoughtful in their choices for council, but whether these officers are objective enough to lead. From my past experience on Council, I feel that an efficient student government can only come from objective leadership. These officers seem to have put politics and their friends ahead of what is good for our class, which I assure you the other candidates would not have done. I may seem to be partial, as the former campaign manager of an opposing ticket, but my involvement in that ticket goes further to prove my point that the Laws ticket was not the best choice for the Class of 2007. If I thought it was, then I would have campaigned with them. After working with them on council and seeing their blatant preference of what is good for them over what is good of the Class of 2007, it is clear that a change of pri­orities needs to be made in our class government. The idea of "service before self' should be simple enough to understand, but it's not a philosophy being followed in the best interest of the Class of 2007.

Reinstate Ramadan's visa 
As students and representatives of the Jewish Law Students Society at the Notre Dame Law School, we were surprised and saddened to hear of the revocation of a visa granted to Tariq Ramadan by the Department of Homeland Security, an action that effectively prevents Professor Ramadan from beginning his teaching position at the Kroc Institute of Peace Studies and becoming a part of the Notre Dame community. We were further disappointed to read media reports portraying the revocation of Professor Ramadan's visa as an action supported and approved of by various Jewish groups. 
As members of the small Jewish community at Notre Dame, we support the Kroc Institute's hiring of Professor Ramadan and condemn the Department of Homeland Security's action. Diversity in opinion, particularly in religious and political viewpoints, is essential to the well being of any academic community; Notre Dame is no exception. Although we understand that national security interests may have motivated the revoca­tion of Professor Ramadan's visa, we know of nothing in Professor Ramadan's history indicating that he presents a threat to our country or our university. On the contrary, it is the repression of dissenting opinions and critical thought that, throughout history, has been the greatest danger to a free society. 
As members of a religious minority both on campus and in this country, we wish to express our support for Professor Ramadan and our sincere hope that he will soon join us at Notre Dame. Professor Ramadan is engaged in a scholarly and political project challenging Muslims, Christians and Jews in the West to revisit deeply held notions of identity, tolerance and coexistence. Although we may not always agree with Professor Ramadan's opinions, the free exchange of ideas is the hallmark of our system of higher education. We hope that the Department of Homeland Security will carefully consider the values our citizenry holds most dear and allow Professor Ramadan to become a part of the Notre Dame community.

Comedy Central's Daily Show key for young voters 
"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" is a show most of us are familiar with; one we turn to when the local news is too dry and boring -one we look to for a slightly twisted view on media. It's a show that melds late night talk with primetime news, so when presidential Steve Bristow candidate John Kerry turned to this show Ball State Tuesday, there was a sur­Daily News prised shock in the political community. 
Yet, this shock should not have happened. Think about it: America wants people to vote, especially young people, and "The Daily Show" has a viewership of mostly 18-25 year olds. Kerry said early in his campaign that he was after the rock-and-roll vote. What better place to find it than at a "fake" news pro­gram that holds most young people's atten­tion? 
Some network news programs have become annoyed -to say the least -at the buzz and popularity "The Daily Show" has. This year during the Democratic National Convention CBS newsman Ted Koppel showed that annoyance saying, "A lot of tele­vision viewers-more, quite frankly, than I'm comfortable with-get their news from the Comedy Channel on a program called 'The Daily Show."' 
Yet, with the show's satirical view on poli­tics and the media, it is hard for young peo­ple not to watch. I fmd myself scheduling my dayaround the show's airtime, making sure I am back home by 10 p.m. to catch the start of the show. 
Also with Stewart's get-to-the-point, no-BS humor that hits so consistently the show will keep the college crowd captivated throughout the 30-minute broadcast. Stewart himself finds it hard to believe that a lot of the young demographic get most, if not all, of their news from his show. In an article Newsweek ran last December, Stewart commented, "I just don't think that is possible. We're on channel 45 in New York! Literally on the remote control journey you could absorb more news than you would get from our show." 

Yet, in this oddball world Stewart's show has become the late night hotspot for politi­cians to appear. Last year, vice presidential candidate John Edwards announced his bid for the presidency on his show, to which Stewart replied, "I have to warn you we are a fake show, so you might have to do this again somewhere." 
In the college student's eyes Stewart is god­like. He is one of the few "adults" that has the gusto to mock the same things that we mock. He uses satire in a way that we all do. He attacks the media, uses hardball questions when talking to his guests. All other late­night talk show hosts will throw softballs at the politicians who appear as guest on their shows, like Tuesday night. When Kerry appeared with Stewart, the first question out of his mouth was about the "Swift Boat Veterans For Truth" ad campaign. Although presented in a comedic way, "I watch a lot of the cable news shows," Jon Stewart began, "so I understand that you were never in Vietnam," the point was received by Kerry, and the viewer. 
Although I will probably vote for George W. Bush this fall, I will have to say that Kerry made the right choice by visiting "The Daily Show." If he is really looking for the "rock­and-roll" vote that show is definitely a place to get it. I am an avid viewer of the show and have gained some more respect for Kerry, and have to commend him on his decision to appear on the show.

The Show: 
Still waiting for his rocket to come: Jason Mraz played an uninspiring set 


By LAUREN WENDEL Scene Wrirer 
Jason Mraz's eo-headlining set at The Show version 3.0 Friday night brought many curious students to the Joyce Center to hear this poten­tially rising star. Unfortunately, most left ques­tioning the hype surrounding the singer-song­writer. llis major label debut "Waiting for My Hocket to Come" (Elektra, 2002) combines an eclectic mix of folk, country, hip hop and acoustic pop rock with a hint of jazz-inspired vocals, creating a distinctive sound not heard in many current pop rock acts. 
When Mraz's single "The Hemedy (I Won't Worry)" hit top-40 radio in the summer of 2003, many expeeted this young coffee shop guitar player, who is originally from Mechanicsville, Va. and now lives in San Diego, to become the next John Mayer or link to Dave Matthews. Despite intelligent lyrics, unique song crafting and clear vocals, his level of musical success has yet to reach those heights, much like his disappointing live performance Friday night. 
Mraz took the stage in front of a hyped up and anticipatory crowd and began with a new slow song, "Not so Usual." The song is ofl' his new live CDIDVD "Tonight. Not Again: Jason Mraz Live at the Eagles Ballroom," which was recorded in Milwaukee this past October. Despite beginning the show on a slower note. 
· 'Mraz and his talented back up band picked up with his 'Til Do Anything," a simple love song lilled with clever lyrics. Hather than building on this energy, Mraz deeided to follow up with several more new songs, all of which included longer than necessary jam sessions between guitarist Bill Bell and bassist Ian Sheridan. Instead of adding heavier musi­cal technicality to these songs, most of these jam sessions dragged the set down and forced many fans to leave due to bon~­dorn. Farther into the set, Mraz broke into his faster-paced, bluegrass inspired "Curbside Prophet" infused with morn improvised freestyle lyrics. This song proved to be a highlight of the set. not only because it was one of the few energetic songs but also due to Mraz's signature improvisational freestyles. At one point in the set, he freestyled his drummer Toea Hivera's phone number -area 
code included -much to Hivnra's surprise. 
The loudest cheers of the night eame from random rnfnrnnees to tlw Fighting Irish, win­ning one for the Gippnr and Hally in the ;\llny. Despite thesn attempts to gain crowd support, Mraz largely failed to capture thn attention of his audience. lin had littln. if any, stagn prns­enee, unless you consider flirting with front row audience members a rare form of stage prnsnncn. 
Tlw song that should havn rnvived and inspired the quickly dwindling crowd only left many disappointed and disenehantnd. Hathnr than sing his hit single "The Homedy (I Won't Worry)." Mraz handpicked thrnn volunteers from the front of the audioncn to appear on stage and karaoke the song. The band gathnred behind all three and jumped around while a tape of the song rolled in the background. 
Mraz proceeded to guide each singer sepa­rately through butchering the inspirational song, all while snapping Polaroid pictures and tossing them into the crowd. This may be fun if you are out with friends at a karaoke bar. and even served as a nice ehango of pace from typi­cal eoncort sing-a-longs, but for this crowd it was tho wrong remedy. Many audionee mnm­bers begged Mraz to sing his own song again. but like much of the set, Mraz failed to reeog­nize the crowd's atmosphere and eontinu!~d with slower versions of "Tonight, Not Again" and "Sleeping to Dream". 
Mraz picked up the pace at .Limes. pl~yiug ../,1.. faster than normal version of "On Love, In Sadness" whieh was well received by the audi­ence, but then brought the energy level back down with more boring jams and unspnctacular light displays. By the end of his scheduled sot, the erowd had thinned out to a third of what it was when the concert began. Those still awake at this time were only die hard Jason Mraz fans, or friends who were forced to stay with friends who were those die hard Jason Mraz fans. llis two-song encore was much likn the rest of his set -long, slow and energy killing. Mraz linished with "Sleep All Day" which would have been nice to hear on a lazy Sunday aftnr­noon, but not during an exciting Friday night. 
Although Jason Mraz has the unique talent and potential to become a big top-40 musician, his live performances arc best left to small ven­ues and crowds that can better appreciate his eclectic freestyles. Hather than spend the $10 to see him in concert, one is better ofT adding this unique artist to his or her musie collection.

Talib Kweli gives a strong performance in impressive opener 
By KENYATTA STORIN Assistant Scene Editor 
Although Talib Kw!'li is not as well known as mainstream rappers like 50 Cent or Ludacris, he has quickly established himself as one of the most respected artists in underground rap. Hailing from Brooklyn, N.Y., Kweli started his career in the late 90s as a part of Black Star, a rap group with fellow rapper Mos Def and DJ Hi-Tek. In 1998, the group came out with their self-titled debut, "Black Star." which was regarded by many as an instant classic. 
What distinguished this album from others was its emphasis on knowledge and awareness, following the teachings of black civil rights activist Marcus Garvey. For many, this positive theme was a breath of fresh air to the negativi­ty and violence interlaced in many mainstream rap reeords. Since Black Star was so success­ful, the three members parted ways to pursue solo earners. While Mos Def decided to focus more on his acting career, Kweli continued awing critics with his expert lyricism on "Heflection Eternal" in 2000 and "Quality" in 2002. 
On Friday night, Kweli opened for The Show at the Joyce Center and did not disappoint. However, it quickly became apparent that the audience was not particularly familiar with Kweli's music. For instance, early on Kweli asked if the-re· wcrn a:ny Black Star fans in the crowd and got a rather muted response. But he took it lightly and jokingly pointed at one Black Star fan in the front and said he had one, at least. On several occasions, Kweli tried to get the crowd to sing along, but he was often left hanging due to the crowd's unfamiliarity with his lyrics. 
Despite these setbacks, Kweli did a good job of keeping the crowd engaged in a variety of ways. Throughout The Show he told fans to put their hands in the air, clap or yell. At one point he even told fans in the seats to do the wave, and in another instance he asked the crowd to hold up lighters and cell phones for a slower number. lie also altered his lyrics to include Notre Dame, and even referenced Hudy in one line. 
But perhaps the defining moment for Kweli was when he asked a couple students to come on stage to dance in the middle of the show. When security refused, Kweli immediately stopped the music and said the show would not go on unless the students could come on stage, causing the crowd to cheer. Security did not budge, so Kweli stuck by his words and left. After about five minutes, and some sparse "Kweli!" chants. to the crowd's delight security finally gave in and let the students on stage, and Kweli came back to continue the show. 
Kweli's set included songs from all across his music catalogue, but seemed to focus primarily on tracks from his last album, "Quality." Kweli appeared to improvise a lot according to the crowd's reaction, sometimes changing songs before the last one was finished. This worked well, as he was able to do this seamlessly with­out disrupting the flow of the show. 
Some of the notable tracks he performed were "Get By" and "Good to You" from Quality and "Definition" from Black Star. He also per­formed "I Try," a new Kanye West produced track with Mary J. Blige from his upcoming album, "Beautiful Struggle." 
Although Kweli performed well, it was often very difficult to understand him because of the Joyce Center's sub-par acoustics and loud, ear­shattering bass. Kweli is an extremely talented lyricist who relies a lot on his words and mes­sage to carry his songs, rather than catchy cho­ruses or funny one-liners, so not being able to understand him was rather unfortunate. Even when he tried to get the crowd to sing the words "I Try," he got a small response because most of the crowd could not understand the words. 
In spite of this, the audience appeared to enjoy Kweli's performance. Even though most people did not know his music well, many approvingly nodded their heads to the beat and waved their hands in the air whenever Kweli told them to. Before his encore, some fans even chanted "Kweli!" to get him to come back on stage. 
Overall, despite the poor sound and unknowledgeable audience, Kweli provided a solid show and demonstrated that he'll be an integral part of the music scene for years to come. He is even planning on making another Black Star album with Mos Def, which will be eagerly anticipated by many hip-hop fans. 
Kweli is a gifted rapper, and those that attended The Show were lucky to have seen him. After all, as Jay-Z said about "The Black Album," "If skills sold, truth be told, I'd proba­bly be lyrically, Talib Kweli." 
Now that is respect.

AMERICAN LEAGUE 

Elarton earns first career shutout in Tribe win 
Associated Press 
Scott Elarton downplayed his 
first career shutout, though his 
new Cleveland Indians team­
mates were impressed. 
Elarton pitched a two-hitter and Casey Blake hit two of Cleveland's four homers in a 9-0 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Sunday. 
Travis Hafner and Ronnie 
Belliard also connected for 
Cleveland. Blake drove in four 
runs. 
"At this point in my career, I'm 
not caught up in numbers," 
Elarton said, "but a shutout is 
nice to get." 
The right-hander allowed an infield single to Willie Harris leading off the fourth and a one­out single to Joe Crede in the ninth in his finest performance since reaching the major leagues in 1998 with Houston. 
"Scott was outstanding," Indians manager Eric Wedge said. "He was in command the whole ballgame." 
Harris hit a slow roller that second baseman Belliard fielded at the cut of the grass, but he could not make a throw. Harris was erased on a double play, as was Ross Gload, who walked to open the third. 
"Scott pitched a great game, he just kept throwing strikes," Belliard said. "You love to play behind a pitcher like that." 
Through eight innings, Elarton (3-3) faced the minimum 24 bat­ters, but he hit Ben Davis in the right knee with the first pitch of the ninth. 
"It had to be done," Elarton said. "Both sides knew it needed to be done. I had to step up for my team." 
Cleveland's Ben Broussard was hit by a pitch in the eighth from Neal Cotts, and Matt Lawton had a pitch from White Sox starter Jon Garland sail past his head in the first. 
"Let's just say that Scott is a good teammate," Wedge said. 
Elarton was warned by plate umpire Ed Rapuano, but main­tained his composure. He allowed Crede's single to center, but easily finished his third career complete game and first since Aug. 27, 2000, with the Astros at Montreal. 
It was the fastest game in Jacobs Field history at 1 hour, 56 minutes. 
The Indians moved one game ahead of Chicago for second place in the AL Central by win­ning for just the third time in 14 
CLASSIFIEDS 

games. The White Sox have lost eight of 11. 
Toronto 6, New York 4 
The New York Yankees failed 
to get a win from their starting 
pitcher-again. 
Carlos Delgado homered off Mike Mussina in Toronto's five­run seventh inning and the Blue Jays ended a five-game losing skid with a victory over the Yankees on Sunday after a power outage delayed the start for about an hour. 
Mussina (9-8) remained win­
less in four starts since coming 
back from an elbow injury that 
sidelined him for nearly six 
weeks. He gave up five runs and 
five hits in 6 1-3 innings. 
The Yankees have gotten just 
one win from their starting 
pitchers in the last 15 games. 
"I just didn't do it. That's the frustrating part. I pitched well for six innings, but it looks like I didn't pitch well at all when it's all said and done," said Mussina, who added that his health is no longer a concern. 
New York manager Joe Torre was "very pleased" with the out­ing. 
"He's getting stronger," Torre said. 
Alex Rodriguez went 4-for-4 with a homer and a walk for the Yankees, whose lead over sec­ond-place Boston in the AL East dropped to 4 1/2 games -their smallest margin since June 23. 
Rodriguez isn't worried about Boston. 
"They are playing extremely well, but we're in the driver's seat," Rodriguez said. "This game is about runs and they are in the best run of the year." 
Miguel Batista (10-10) won for the first time since July 23 -a span of seven starts -and allowed two runs and seven hits in seven innings. 
"It was a good one by Batista. Seven strong ones," Blue Jays interim manager John Gibbons said. 
Jason Frasor gave up a solo homer to pinch-hitter Jorge Posada in the ninth before fin­ishing for his 17th save in 18 chances. 
Boston 6, Detroit 1 
Tim Wakefield fmished off the Detroit Tigers on Sunday. Now comes the real challenge for the streaking Boston Red Sox. 
Boston beat Detroit, ending a stretch of 26 games -23 against teams below .500 at the time of the game -in which the Red Sox won 20. Next up are consecutive three-game home series against Anaheim and Texas, their closest pursuers in the AL wild-card race. 

"I think we can beat any team right now," Johnny Damon said after the four-game sweep. "Our team is rising up." 
Curt Schilling starts Tuesday night's opener against the Angels, who trailed Boston by two games after the win over Detroit. Texas was three behind. 
"On Tuesday night, you get a chance to set the tempo for the rest of the series," Schilling said. 
Sunday's win and New York's 6-4 loss in Toronto cut the Yankees' AL East lead over the Red Sox to 4 1/2 games -the closest Boston's been to first since June 23. 
Wakefield (11-7) allowed three hits in eight innings and Boston won its sixth straight and 11th in the last 12. 
"My concentration was a lot better," said the knuckleballer, who gave up seven runs in five innings in a win at Detroit on Aug. 8. "I mixed in my breaking ball and my fastball a little bit more this time." 
Baltimore 7, Texas 6 
Melvin Mora has become a dangerous hitter with the bases loaded. 
Mora drove in four runs in a pair of bases-loaded singles, helping the Baltimore Orioles snap their season-high 12-game losing streak with a 7-6 victory over the Texas Rangers on Sunday. 

Mora improved to 8-for-15 with 18 RBis with the bases loaded this season. 
"I knew the club needed me," said Mora, second in the AL with 
a .349 average. "I gave it a little extra." 
Mora's two-run hits in the third and fifth helped stop the Orioles' longest slide since drop­ping the final 12 games of the 2002 season. 
"If we'd lost this one today, we might as well have called it a season," Orioles starter Sidney Ponson said. 
Baltimore's Brian Roberts reached base four times and scored three runs. 
"We were ready for something positive to happen," Roberts said. "We thought we'd break the streak every day for the last 10 days. Now we can move on." 
Anaheim 4, Minnesota 2 
The Minnesota Twins are beginning to think Adam Kennedy isn't human. And they're glad to be finished with him -at least for the regular season. 
Kennedy hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning, giving the Angels a 4-2 victory over the AL Central-leading Twins on Sunday. It came two days after his tiebreaking two-run shot helped beat the 1\vins 9-6. 
"I think Adam Kennedy is the Rally Monkey," Minnesota out­fielder Torii Hunter said in refer­ence to the Angels' video mas­cot. "The Rally Monkey lives within him. If you get rid of Adam Kennedy, the Rally Monkey is no more." 
Kennedy has hit three other home runs against the 1\vins ­all of them in the 2002 AL cham­pionship series clincher, earning him MVP honors for that series. 
Jose Guillen doubled home the tying run in the sixth for his 1OOth RBI of the season, and Troy Glaus went 0-for-2 with two walks in his first game back after being sidelined for more than 3 1/2 months with a shoul­der injury. 
Kennedy drove a 3-2 slider down and in from Juan Rincon (1 0-6) deep into the right-field porch for his ninth home run and first walkoff homer of his career after a one-out walk to Glaus.

Francisco Rodriguez (2-1) allowed one hit in two scoreless innings for the win. Angels starter Kelvim Escobar allowed two runs, four hits and no walks in seven innings while striking out nine.

Bush leads USC to victory from the backfield 
Tailback combines with Heisman prospect Matt Leinart as Trojans hold tough against suprisingly strong Hokies 
Associated Press 
LANDOVER, Md. -Reggie Bush came out of the backfield to give Southern California a new big-play receiver. 
The tailback caught three long touchdown passes to help the top-ranked Trojans beat Virginia Toch 24-13 in a slop­py opener Saturday night in perfect over-the-shoulder throw from Leinart for a 53­yard touchdown with 1:55 left in the third. 

Bush also opened the scor­ing by taking a middle screen 35 yards for a TD in the first quarter. 
Otherwise, an offense that averaged 41 points and 447 yards last season struggled for 
which ended with USC up 7-3. "I think things opened up for me tonight," Randall said. 
In the second quarter, Handall burned the Trojans with his arm. He went 5-for-5 for 65 yards during a 10-play, 80-yard drive that culminated with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Josh Hyman. The 17 1/2-point underdog Hokies, took a 10-7 lead into halftime. 
The Hokies had things going their way in the second half, too, until an offensive pass interference call on Hyman wiped out a long gain and led to a punt. 
"The momentum just switched right there," Handall said. 
USC took advantage on the 
Once given a lead to protect, the Trojans defense put the squeeze on Randall. The Hokies managed just a field goal in the second half and the Trojans caused a fumble by Handall with 2:01 left that set up a field goal and sealed a much-tougher than expected win. 
"Nobody said that you have

American, Italian, Brazilian take medals in marathon 
Associated Press 
ATHENS, Greece -Three miles from the finish, the marathon leader was grabbed by a defrocked priest wearing a red kilt, green beret and match­ing knee-high socks. An American won a medal -some­thing that hadn't happened in 28 years. 
Definitely a bizarre way to end an Olympics. Panathinaiko Stadium hasn't hosted anything this weird since a pair of Greek princes ran alongside Spiridon Louis to the fmish line 108 years ago. 
Italy's Stefano Baldini surged ahead with two miles to go and American Meb Keflezighi fin­ished a surprising second in a race disrupted by a costumed intruder from Ireland. 
With three miles left, Vanderlei de Lima of Brazil was clinging to a shrinking lead when he was

shoved into the curbside throng by the assailant. De Lima was able to get back into the race, but he lost several more seconds and ended up with the bronze medal. 
The 29-year-old Keflezighi, who emigrated from the African nation of Eritrea at age 10, is the 
HELP MAKE OUR SCHOOLS VIOLENCE FREE ZONES 
first American to medal in the men's marathon since Frank Shorter's silver in 1976. Deena Kastor won the bronze in the women's marathon a week ago, marking the first time the United States had won two medals in the 26.2-mile race at the same Olympics. 
"USA running is back," Keflezighi said. "Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Coming in I was not a favorite, I'm just very happy to win a silver." 
De Lima drew big cheers from the crowd at the finish line in the beautiful, horseshoe-shaped sta­dium that was the site of the first modern Olympics 108 years ago. He smiled broadly, spread his arms like wings and weaved from side to side as he crossed the line. 
Later, he said the intruder cost him a shot at the gold. 
"When I saw the man who was jumping on me I was scared, because I didn't know what could happen to me, whether he was armed with a knife, a revolver or something and whether he was going to kill me," de Lima said. 
"If you stop in a marathon, you struggle the next three or four kilometers. It's hard to get your rhythm back," he said. "I don't know if I would have won, but things would have been differ­ent." 
A protest fried by the Brazilian track federation asking that de Lima be given a duplicate gold was denied by the International Association of Athletics Federations. Brazil said it would appeal that decision to the inde­pendent Court of Arbitration for Sport, whose decision would be fmal. 
The International Olympic Committee said it would present de Lima with the Pierre de Coubertin medal in recognition of his "exceptional demonstra­tion of fair play and Olympic val­ues." 
The race began in the suburb of Marathon as the sun set, cast­ing a rose-colored light over the stadium, which was about three­quarters full. The runners fol­lowed the steep, difficult course over which, legend says, Pheidippides carried the news in 490 B.C. that the Greeks had defeated the Persians in the Battle of Marathon. 
Baldini finished in 2 hours, 10 minutes and 54 seconds. He waved his hands in celebration, then dropped to his knees in exhaustion after his final lap on the narrow track inside the sta­dium. The 33-year-old Italian is the former European marathon champion and two-time world marathon silver medalist. 
Keflezighi, the American record holder at 10,000 meters, showed little emotion at the fin­ish, crossing himself and putting up a No. 1 sign with his finger. Baldini was lying on his back nearby, and Keflezighi bent over him in congratulations. 
He ran a personal-best 2:11.29, 34 seconds behind the winner. De Lima finished in 2:12.11. 
Keflezighi, who has 11 broth­ers and sisters, became a U.S. citizen in 1998. In Eritrea, he lived in a hut that had no elec­tricity. When he saw his frrst car at age 10, he ran away because it scared him. He remembers soldiers surrounding his village, looking for boys 12 and older to drag offto war. His brothers would hide in the bushes to avoid them.

NATIONAL LEAGUE 
Wells wins seventh straight as Padre's defeat Expos 11-3 
Associated Press 
MONTHEAL-David Wells 

thinks the San Diego Padres 
have what it takes to stick 
around in the NL playoiT race. 
Wells won his seventh consec­

utive road decision and helped 
himself with a single for his first 
career HBI. leading San Diego to 
an 11-3 victory over the 
Montreal Expos on Sunday. 
Hyan Klesko and Khalil Greene each hit two-run homers for the Padres, who began the day tied with San Francisco for second in the NL West -five games behind Los Angeles. They're also tied with Chicago for the lead in the NL wild-card race. 
"It's a big boost for a pitching staff when you get some run support. and that's how you gel," said Wells, a member of nine playoff teams -including two World Series champions. "When you score runs and the pitching docs well. it gives the team a lot of hope." 
San Diego hasn't been involved in a playoiT race since 1998, when it won its second NL pennant before being swept by Wells' Yankees. 
"It's good to come back after losing the first game and pick up two and kind of keep ground where we're at," Greene said. "I don't like to look ahead too often and get ahead of ourselves. I just worry about what we do. As long as we can beat the teams we need to beat, then I think we'll be fine." 
Wells (9-7) allowed eight hits and three runs in seven innings. improving to 3-0 in his last four starts overall. I le struck out two and walked none, the 12th time in 24 starts this season he hasn't allowed a base-on-balls. 
Los Angeles 10, New York 2 
Hobin Ventura circled the bases one more time, passing Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron in the record book and pulling alongside Ted Williams and Jimmie Foxx with his 17th grand slam. 
"It's nice to even be mentioned in any category whatsoever with those guys," Ventura said mod­estly. 
On a muggy day that saw Ventura draw more cheers than 
the Mets, he led the Los Angeles 
Dodgers to a 10-2 victory over 
sinking New York that main­
tained their five-game lead in 
the NL West. 

At 37 and a role player these days, Ventura remains as unas­suming as ever. Even though he's had just 19 starts and 117 at-bats, he's been a key for the Dodgers, seeking their first play­ofT berth since 1996. 
lie had tiebreaking, pinch HBI single in the ninth inning of a 5­4 win over San Diego on April 6, a pinch two-run homer for a 7-6 win at Arizona on July 17 and a pinch 12th-inning homer for a 2-1 victory at San Diego on Aug. 1. 
"To have a player of this guy's magnitude and have other play­ers see how he allows himself to be managed, how he'll do what­ever you ask him to do, you can't put a price tag on that," Dodgers manager Jim Tracy said. 
Cincinnati 6, Arizona 2 
For six innings, Edgar Gonzalez dominated the Cincinnati Reds. With one swing, Adam Dunn changed everything. 
Gonzalez held Cincinnati hit­less into the seventh, but Dunn's 39th homer on a 3-1 changeup helped the Reds rally for a victo­ry over the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
"That was the only pitch he gave me that I could really hit," Dunn said. 
Ryan Freel drove in the go­ahead run with an eighth-inning single and the Reds avoided a three-game sweep. 
Gonzalez faced the minimum 18 batters through six innings before Freel led ofT the seventh with a walk. Felipe Lopez fol­lowed with a chopper to first baseman Shea Hillenbrand while Freel was breaking for second and was credited with an infield single when Gonzalez failed to cover the bag. 
"I didn't see the runner going," Gonzalez said. "I thought [Hillenbrand) was going to go to second base. Then I saw him look toward first, and I started too late." 
That miscue cost Gonzalez and the Diamondbacks. "It leaves a little bit of a bad taste, but it will happen,"

Arizona manager AI Pedrique said. "Late in the game, we did­n't execute defensively. You're not going to play perfectly every day." 
Sean Casey then hit into a double play, but Dunn's two-run homer gave the Reds a 2-1 lead. 
Philadelphia 10, Milwaukee 0 
Cory Lidle returned to what works -throwing strikes, mak­ing batters put the ball in play early -for his best game of the season. 
"'I felt like the old me," Lidle said. 
Lidle homered and threw a four-hitter for his second shutout of the season, Marlon Byrd hit a grand slam and had a career-best five RBis, and the Philadelphia Phillies extended the Milwaukee Brewers~ losing streak to 11 with a victory. 
Lidle worked more on his mechanics and his approach during recent bullpen sessions with pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. The results paid off with first-pitch strikes on 24 bat­ters. 
"Sometimes you ju.st forget what made you successful," Lidle said. 
Lidle (8-12) was terrific in his first win with the Phillies, strik­ing out a season-high nine. walking one and not allowing a runner past second base in his fourth career shutout. The right­hander was 0-2 with a no-deci­sion since he was acquired from Cincinnati on Aug. 9. 
It was also Lidle's fourth com­plete game this season, tied for second in the National League with Arizona's Randy Johnson. 
Lidle kept Philadelphia's faint playoff hopes alive. The Phillies moved six games behind Chicago in the NL wild-card race with the Cubs' 10-3 loss to Houston. 
"There's definitely a chance, but we have to play our best ball the rest of the season," Lidle said. 
General manager Ed Wade said Bowa's job is safe for at least the rest of the season. Bowa said he was tired of dis­cussing his status, and took issue with a question about why Philadelphia hasn't had more games like this. 
"I know why -all the injuries," he said. "You don't have to be a rocket scientist. People don't want to look at it. Common sense is all it is." 
The Phillies had 16 hits, and Jimmy Rollins, Bobby Abreu, Placido Polanco and Byrd all had three each.

ATHENS, Greece -The United States finished atop the medal charts for the third straight Summer Olympics, with Russia the overall runner-up and China second in gold medals ­its best showing ever and the leading edge of a surge by Asian teams. 
Six nations won gold medals for the first time; the trailblazers included an Arab sheik marks­man and an Israeli windsurfer. Two other countri~s. Paraguay and Eritrea, won their first medals of any sort. 
The American team amassed 103 total medals, topping its tar­get of 100, and won 35 golds to 32 for China and 27 for Russia. But China played the lead role in the games' most significant trend -the improvement of Asian squads in a widening array of Olympic sports as they gird for the 2008 Beijing Games. 
Far East Asian nations won 63 gold medals in Athens, com­pared to 43 at Sydney in 2000. Japan alone upped its gold total from five to 16, the biggest increase of any nation, while China won golds for the first time in tennis and men's track. 
OLYMPICS 

U.S__. tops medal counts at Games 
"These were the games where we saw the awakening of Asia," International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge said. "The traditional strong nations that dominate the scene now will have to work extremely hard." 
Australian Olympic chief John Coates, whose team finished fourth, said China and Japan "have sent us an ominous warn­ing. They're gearing up for a dominant performance in 2008." 
Asia's gains came largely at the expense of Europe. Germany won 48 medals in Athens. nine fewer than in Sydney, while medal hauls also dropped for France, Italy, Poland, Norway, ..., Sweden and the Netherlands. Greece, despite drug scandals and other setbacks, won 16 medals, its best showing since it hosted the first modern Olympics in 1896. 
Russia dipped in golds com­pared to Sydney (27 to 32) but, -. despite disappointing perform­ances in swimming and gymnas­tics, exceeded its overall medal total--:-92 this time compared to 88 in 2000. 
The Americans won the most,._ medals in swimming and track, and finished just one behind Romania in gymnastics.

Associated Press 

EAST RUTHERFORD, 
N.J. Eli Manning remains the New York Giants' quarterback of the future. For now, the job belongs to Kurt Warner. 
Briefly citing Warner's experience and recent play, coach Tom Coughlin announced Sunday that the two-time MVP had beaten out the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft for the starting job in the season opener at Philadelphia on Sept. 12. 
"We give Kurt the ball and say, 'Kurt, let's go win,"' Coughlin said, end­ing a competition that has dominated training camp. 
The choice wasn't sur­prising in the wake of Friday's 17-10 loss to the Jets. Warner played well and Manning did not dur­ing his worst day on the field since signing a $45 million contract in late July. 
Warner hit 9-of-11 pass­es for 104 yards, leading the Giants to their only touchdown against the Jets. Manning was 4-of-14 for 20 yards, with two interceptions and a fumble that was returned for a Jets touchdown. 
Coughlin's decision puts Manning in a backup role for the first time since his redshirt freshman year at Mississippi in 2000. 

"I wasn't upset by it," Manning said. "I figured it might come. It doesn't change anything. I still have a lot to learn." 
That's why the Giants signed the 33-year-old Warner in June after he was released by the St. Louis Rams. It was expect­ed that he would be the caretaker quarterback until Manning, the brother of co-MVP Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts, was ready. 
Manning's exceptional play in training camp made Coughlin's decision more difficult. 
"The advancement of Eli has been largely due to the competitive nature of this position," Coughlin said. "I feel like he has advanced tremendously as a rookie in this league with all the information .that has been thrown at him, and the way he's handled the majority of that, so I feel good about the two quar­terbacks." 
Warner said the competi­tion was nerve-racking at times. 
"It was a distinct chal­lenge for me, a new chal­lenge for me and I think it helped to push and force me to learn this stuff at a little faster pace," said Warner. 
IN BRIEF 

Chiefs' receiver to have 
knee surgery 

KANSAS CITY, Mo.-Marc Boerigter will undergo knee surgery on Monday and might be lost for the year, throwing Kansas City's tattered wide receiver corps into even greater disarray. 
Boerigter, who seemed ready to rebound from a subpar 2003 season, twisted his right knee in a noncon­tact play early in the Chiefs' 21-19 exhibition loss Saturday night to Cleveland. 
Coach Dick Vermeil said Sunday that doctors believe Boerigter might have suffered ligament damage. 
''I'll know more tomorrow after they operate as to what the projec­tions are," Vermeil said. "Personally, I don't believe [Boerigter will return]this season. That hurt me more than losing the game." 
The 6-foot-3 Boerigter totaled 420 yards and eight touchdowns on just 20 catches in 2002, his first year in the NFL. 
Montgomerie named to 
Ryder Cup team 

NORD-EICHENRIED, Germany­Colin Montgomerie will play in his seventh Ryder Cup, having been added to the European team Sunday as one of two wild-card selections by captain Bernhard Langer. 
Langer also chose 26-year-old Luke Donald, giving England five players on a team that will try to retain the Ryder Cup against the United States on Sept. 17-19 at Oakland Hills. England's Ian Poulter, Paul Casey and David Howell, and Irishman Paul McGinley secured spots on Europe's Ryder Cup team at the BMW International Open on Sunday. Thomas Levet of France already was a lock to make his first team through the money standings. 
Rounding out the team are Padraig Harrington, Darren Clarke, Sergio Garcia, Miguel Angel Jimenez and Lee Westwood of England. Montgomerie brings experience and leadership to the European team. 
Curacao wins Little League

SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. ­Carlos Pineda struck out 11 and Jurickson Profar hit a two-run homer as Pabao Little League of Willemstad, Curacao, took an early lead and held on for a 5-2 victory over Conejo Valley of Thousand Oaks, Calif., in the Little League World Series championship on Sunday night. 
California scored both of its runs in the top of the sixth. and had runners on first and third with two outs. James Brady hit to first baseman Christopher Garia, who won a race to make the final out. 
It was the first Little League title for the tiny island in the Netherlands Antilles, and the first for any team from the Caribbean. 
In the consolation game, Richmond, Texas, beat Guadalupe, Mexico, 5-0. Randal Grichuk's sec­ond hit tied the record for hits in a series with 12.

I still had a good time." Winning a gold medal will do that. 
But what Sunday morning's press conference and photo shoot showed is it hasn't changed who she really is. 
Her eyes lit up when men­tioning meeting Andy Roddick (who lost in the third round of the men's tennis competition) and a "couple other famous people." 
Zagunis wanted to get on TV during the opening ceremonies. So she contrived the plan of walking next to the USA Basketball team, which was "really cool" and "it worked." 
Zagunis rolled her eyes when mentioning this morning's 8:30 
a.m. swim test followed by a class in Hayes-Healy. 
During one moment in Athens, Zagunis even broke out her three-toed sloth impres­sion. 
All of this attention has gone to someone who shouldn't have even been in Athens. 
Zagunis deferred her enroll­ment to Notre Dame for a year to concentrate on making the Olympic team. In the final Olympic qualifying event, Zagunis needed to finish in first or second in a senior World Cup Event to make the Olympic team. 
She finished third. 
By one touch. 
"At first I was really devastat­
ed," Zagunis said. "I put my entire life on hold to go make the Olympic team, and I miss it by one touch. 
"So that was kind of harsh." 
Naturally, Zagunis and her mother Cathy (who was an Olympian along with her father in the 1976 Games) had a tough and "tearful" weekend. 
But she couldn't lose her focus, there was a potential "loophole." 
If any country declined its spot in the women's sabre field, Zagunis would qualify as the highest-ranked fencer not going to Athens at that time. 
Nigeria declined, and now Zagunis has a big thank-you to send. 
And a big target on her back. 
Every collegiate fencer will want to knock off the Olympic champion, who will be only a college freshman and unknown to the team-oriented style of the NCAA Championships. 
"Talk about pressure. It's okay. I'm just going to get back into it slowly," Zagunis said. "You can't win everything, but I'm sure going to try. People are going to be out to get me. I'm ready to fence and do my best." 
Then there's the issue of get­ting ready for Beijing in 2008. 
Zagunis acknowledged she might have to take time off to train because of the demanding Olympic training schedule. 
But she's "got to go defend my title." This time, Zagunis will be the famous person. And people will be standing next to her to get on TV.

meager 14 total shots -only six of which were on-net ­neither team was able to break the scoreless deadlock, though the Irish suffered a number of near-misses. 
In addition to a pair of shots that ricocheted off the frame­work by midfielder Ian Etherington and forward Alex Yoshinaga, Etherington had a goal disallowed on an offsides call that game tape later revealed to be erroneous. 
While the Irish were unable to find the back the net, Clark was still quite pleased with the squad's effort. 
"You always like to win every garrie you play, but the thing that will always concern us the most is the perform­ance," Clark said. "If we can get the performance right, over the long term, it's going to bring results." 
After graduating five All-Big East selections that accounted for 35 of 38 Notre Dame goals last year, the offense will con­tinue to function as a key fac­tor in determining whether or not the Irish will be successful in achieving their lofty goals this season. 
While Saturday's goose egg in the goals column might indicate otherwise, Clark is confident that a different offensive approach -one that emphasizes a greater number of players than in previous seasons -will bear fruit in the form of tallies on the scoreboard. 

"The scoring really fell to two main players last year," Clark said. "I think the way to cover that is to get goals from a lot of different areas and not rely on solely one or two guys. 
"Can we actually get goals from four, five or even six dif­ferent areas? I think that's possible this year." 
With the preseason now in 
the books, the Irish head home for a week before traveling south to Bloomington, Ind. to compete in Indiana's Adidas/IU Credit Union Classic Friday and Sunday against Oregon State and Boston University, respectively.

Standout 
continued from page 24 
Thorlakson was not the only player to make her mark in the record books Friday night. Freshman forward Amanda Cinalli scored the first two goals of the season with primary assists from Thorlakson. 
Cinnalli joins only three other freshmen in the school's history -Margaret Jarc. Rosella Guerrero and Boland -for scor­ing the opening goal of a season. Cinalli scored her goals in the 13th and 22nd minutes of the game. 
Boland had only words of praise for the up-and-coming soccer standout. 
"It is a great way to start your college career and she has a great career ahead of her," Boland said. 
Thorlakson and sophomore Jen Buczkowski followed her lead, with Thorlakson adding two goals to the Irish effort and ment. 
"We came out too anxious but we needed to take care of the ball better," Boland said. 
Notre Dame 3, Eastern Illinois 0 

After an impressive victory Friday night against Baylor, the Irish came away with another remarkable performance against Eastern Illinois on Sunday. Following her record-breaking performance, Thorlakson contin­ued to dominate on the field by setting up aU three goals the Irish scored against Eastern Illinois. 
Junior Annie Schefter began the contest by scoring her first goal of the season and the game. Jen Buczkowski quickly followed Schefter by scoring the second goal off of a header to the right side of the goal. 
With a 2-0 margin at halftime, senior Candance Chapman came ofT the bench to score the final Irish goal of the game in the sec­ond half. Her goal put the Irish ahead 3-0 and guaranteed the team their second consecutive into the endzone the rest of the way for the touchdown.
