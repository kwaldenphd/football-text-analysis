Student Affairs partially restores matching funds 
By MONICA YANT 
News Writer 
Matching funds for residence halls have been reinstated, re­versing a decision made after the Oct. 19 snowball fight which caused $3500 dollars in damage, said Father David Tyson, vice president for Stu­dent Affairs. 
Each hall will, however, for­feit 17 percent of allocated funds to cover the cost of re­pairing the damage. 
Tyson's decision came after meetings and correspondence with student leaders revealed that 14 of 26 dorms had al: ready begun to spend allocated funds. 
"Given the notification of fund allocation by the Office of Student Residences, and prior capital purchases by some halls," Tyson said in his letter to Student Body President Matt Breslin, "I believe some rein­statement is warranted." 
"I think it's a victory in a sense that we got what seemed to be a 'set in stone' decision changed," said Hall Presidents' Council Chairperson Megan Hanley. 
Matching funds are used for capital improvements to dorms. These improvements range from microwave ovens to pool tables. The University assumes two-thirds of the cost of each purchase. 
Several dorms had already purchased items, after gaining approval of funding from the University. Siegfried and Pas­querilla West purchased pianos for their chapels with the un­derstanding they would be re­imbursed accordingly.

The Notre Dame Chorale, conducted by Carl Starn, practices for Friday night's concert. The concert will be held at 8:15p.m. in Washington Hall and admission is free.

Politburo ousted 
BEHI.IN (AP) -Commu­nist Party chief Egon Krenz on Wednesday ousted the old guard from the ruling Polit­buro and replaced them with reformers in a desperate move to quell widespread unrest and strengthen his 3­week-old leadership. 
Thousands of East Ger­mans disillusioned by 40 years of Communist rule and skeptical of promised re­forms continued to flood from their homeland, with more than 50,000 reaching West Germany since Satur­day. 
Krenz also indicated that independent, non-communist groups would be allowed a greater role in society, and provincial authorities began to legally register New Fo­rum, the largest pro-democ­racy group.

College students at risk from AIDS; education programs need work 
By FLORENTINE HOELKER and KELLEY TUTHILL 
Assistant News Editors 

A recent survey by the Ameri­can College Health Association (ACHA) suggests that college and university students are at risk of contracting Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). 
"The nation's first survey re­garding AIDS in institutions of higher education reveals that HIV infection is a problem for college students today, and suggests that education and prevention programs should be strengthened," said Stephen BJorn, executive director of the ACHA. 
The HIV Seroprevalence_ Sur­vey reports that roughly two students per thousand who seek medical attention in their student health centers, and who require blood samples as part of their treatment, are HIV positive, said Blom in a press release. 

and the University 
Fourth in a five-part series 
Of the 16,861 student blood specimens which were included in the survey, 30 tested positive for HIV infection, giving an overall rate of 0.2 percent. The rate of infection ranged from zero to 0.9 percent. Ten of the nineteen schools had a sera­prevalence rate of zero, while five of the institutions had rate of 0.4 percent or higher. 
Dr. Richard Keeling, director of student health services at the University of Virginia and president of the ACHA, was the principal investigator for the study, said BJorn. 
Keeling said that the survey results "establish beyond any doubt that HIV infection is a current problem on college campuses. Irrespective of any particular level of infection," he said, "the fact that HIV infec­tion appears on campuses across the country should cause real concern." 
Dr. Helene Gayle, the Center for Disease Control's epidemi­ologist responsible for the sur­vey, said that "this study bol­sters the need for more aggres­sive efforts to prevent the spread of HIV on college cam­puses. These students will be important disseminators of in­formation to their communi­ties, and what they learn in col­lege will follow them for the rest of their lives." 
The 19 universities were se­lected to represent a cross sec­tion of higher education in the United States. They include both public and private schools, and are geographically dis­persed, said BJorn. 
The ACHA plans to continue to investigate HIV seropreva­lence among college students.

There are 535 mnmbers of the House and Senate in Washington and all the ills of the country (or the world) can be blamed upon them. After all shouldn't these 535 men and women bn able to solve all the problems of the over 237 million people in the United States'? 
It is unfair and much too easy to blame the problems of society on government. Granted thnre are some major problems that are screaming to be addressed by government, but it has become a case of passing the buck. Many people prefer to pawn social re­sponsibility off to national leaders. 
National office holders are representatives of the people, they are not substitutes for them. By choosing a candidate and voting many Americas feel they have done their duty. 
But the problems of the nation are too great and far reaching for the government to solve. There are many more Joe Citizens than there are Joe Congressmen. Communi­ties and citizens are often much more ca­pable of alleviating social ills because of their sheer numbers and their close proxim­
ity to the problems addressing their peers. 
Recently a group of Notre Dame students went to Washington's Capitol steps to ex­press their concerns about homelessness. Obviously all the students involved where in­terested in the issue, their effort was a no­ble one, but couldn't the time and money in­volved in the trip have been better spent on the homeless problem itself? 
Notre Dame and the local community have banded together to create a homeless center in downtown South Bend. The time spent in travel to Washington might have been better spent working in the shelter itself or in lob­bying the local community concerning the issue rather than the Capitol. 
It is not always better to start at the top. Often much more can be accomplished at the local level. Sweeping change emanating from Washington is a grand plan, but not a very feasible one. The time has come for the people of the United States to take the so­cial climate of the country into their own hands. That can often mean getting their own hands dirty from more than sign painting. 
When Mother said, "charity begins at home" she was right. 
The Representatives and Senators are only a tiny minority of the American people. If those 535 can have such an immense ef­fect on the state of the U.S. what can over 237 million achieve? 
If the people of the United States look to themselves for the solutions to the ills of this world the answers will come much more quickly than from Congress.

News Writer 
A change in the parietals pol­icy for the Saint Mary's campus was the center of discussion at Wednesday's Board of Gover­nance meeting. 
The change in hours would be on Friday's only. Parietals would begin at 12 p.m. instead of 4 p.m .. The reasoning behind this proposal is that male fam­ily members and out of town guests arriving for the weekend cannot go to a resident's room until later. This is especially a problem on football weekends. 
A petition signed by the ma­jority of residents in Augusta Hall and a meeting with Lissa Van Bebber, director of resi­dent life, on changing the hours prompted the discussion. 
The original proposal effects

Catenacci, student body presi­

BOSTON (AP) -Exposure to medical X-rays during infancy can significantly increase women's chances of breast cancer when they reach their 30s, a study confirms. 
The research was based on a long-term follow-up of women who were given X-ray therapy deskworker and non-residents do not pass through that dorm to reach their classes. 
Several concerns were voiced by other members of the board that the policy would be unfair to the rest of the student body. 
"Whether you get in Augusta or not is the luck of the lot­tery," said Shannon McGowan, a board member. Therefore, Augusta residents are getting these privileges because of pure chance, she said. 
"There are going to be a lot of seniors upset," said Mc­Gowan. 
It was suggested that a crite­ria system for deciding who could live in Augusta be used instead of using the lottery. Therefore, the additional privi­leges could be justified. Aca­demic standing would be a pri­mary criteria, but other things would also be considered. 
"We must decide if this is a route we wa,_nt take," said Deirdre Milon, a board mem­ber. 
If it is decided that this is the

By age 36, the study found, those who had received the 
solution, then the changes .would take place no sooner 
than next year. 

Other members said that the 
only way to justify such a 
change was to do it for the en­
tire campus. The board mem­
bers agreed that the possibility 
of changing parietals for every­
one must be examined. 

It was decided that a commit­
tee should be formed to investi­
gate whether or not changing 
parietals campus-wide was a 
feasible option. 

The committee would examine such things as the possibility of hiring desk workers for the ad­ditional hours, the problems for security, and the inconvenience for students that still have classes and pass through the dorms to get to them. 
In addition to the parietals policy the smoking policy was discussed. A questionnaire on both policies will be passed out to all students so that the board can get student input.

there will also be 30 kegs of beer on tap in what is one of the few senior class-sponsored events in which alcohol is al­lowed to be served, said Pow­ers. 
An estimated 3,000 people are expected to attend the event. Residents from the Northeast Neighborhood of South Bend, seniors, faculty and staff are invited to the party. 
The purpose of the event is to "incorporate the South Bend community into the Notre Dame Family," according to Senior Class President Carolyn Rey. 
Also, since many seniors live off-campus in the Northeast Neighborhood, the event is in­tended to show appreciation to the residents of the neighbor­hood for their overall kindness to students, said Rey. 
NO prof publishes new book 
Special to The Observer 
Klaus Lanzinger, chairman and professor of German and Russian languages and litera­tures at Notre Dame, has pub­lished a book titled "Jason's Voyage: The Search for the Old World in American Literature." 
The book recounts the Euro­pean travels of four major American writers-Melville, Hawthorne, James and Wolfe­and examines the manner in which their literary work was marked by them. 
Lanzinger, an Austrian na­tive, has been a member of the Notre Dame faculty since 1967. He was graduated from Bow­doin College in 1951 and re­ceived a doctoral degree from the University of Innsbruck the following year. He has written numerous articles on major American writers and edited the Americana-Austraica series.

volvcd in the annual snowball 
fight, he said. 
If Notre Dame is truly the unified community it claims to be, Tyson said, then unity must extend beyond cheering for a winning football team. "We show unity at games. On the downside, we must also take responsibility for our actions [as a unified community!." he said. 
Breslin also spoke of respon­sibility. "We've realized that we all have the responsibility of preventing !the damage! from happening again," he said. 
But Kinkopf said that stu­dents should not shoulder all the blame. "As student leaders. we join the community to stop 
vandalism," he said. "We share 
responsibility, but we don't 
have sole responsibility." 
When Tyson announced that 
he had suspended matching 
funds, he said, "The efforts of 
these people [student leaders] 
were insufficient to stem what 
is approaching a riot." 
Student leaders expressed concern to Tyson that the freezing of funds punished the entire student body for the ac­tions of "a small minority of our community," in a letter written two days after learning of the decision. 
The letter to Tyson disagreed with Tyson's original claim that student leaders should have been more effective in prevent­ing the snowball fight. "We dis­agree... that we, as student leaders, should have taken re­sponsibility for the enforcement and dissemination of policies of the Office of Residence Life. Clearly this responsibility lies with the ORL." 
"We agree that all students should refrain from maliciously causing damage to University property or fellow students." the letter said. "We apologize for the actions of those stu­dents and recognize the severity of their actions." 
"We do not believe that col­lective punishment of the entire student body for the actions of individuals is just," it said. 
If matching funds are used to punish the entire student body to the sum of over $20,000 in the spring for actions taken by a few in the winter, then changing the allocation process will not have solved the prob­lem, Student Body Vice Presi­dent Dave Kinkopf said. 

Other student leaders share Kinkopfs view. "I still don't agree that the students should be punished for what a few did," said Hanley. 
Tyson said in the letter to Breslin, "It is not my desire to take action against the whole student body. Nonetheless. I am convinced that all of us bear the responsibility in maintain­ing a safe campus for all" 
Members of student govern­ment. the Office of Student Af­fairs, the Office of Hesidence Life, campus Security, Non-var­sity Athletics, and Freshman Class Council will meet Thurs­day afternoon to discuss pre­ventative measures for future snowball fights. 
Tyson said he hopes the meeting will result in creative ways to counteract the vandal­ism involved in the fights. "I 
don't have a problem with the 
snowball fight. It's people get­
ting hurt, and the injury," he 
said. 
Breslin said he hopes the meeting will reveal administra­tive plans for handling and pre­venting future incidents. 
Reversing the decision showed student leaders that administration is willing to work with them. Breslin said that working together with administration went beyond "token" meetings. "This (deeision) shows that they are listening, listening enough to change their minds," he said. 
The changn is "evidence of a positive working relationship between student government and administration that has developed over the past couple of years," said Kinkopf. 

AIDS 
continued from page 1 
Marc Milhander, clinical psy­chologist for both the Univer­sity Counseling Center and Ath­letic Department at Notre Dame, came to Notre Dame from Kansas State University (KSU). lie said that KSU hired an AIDS educator full time to educate the KSU community. 
lie also said that he worked on the committee that devel­oped an AIDS policy for KSU in response to a case on campus. 
In regards to Notre Dame, Milhander said. "The University is reluctant to be perceived as condoning sexual activity." If' there was enough IllY+ stu­dents on campus, he said he was sure the University would develop programs to deal with the issue. 
In Notre Dame's counseling department there are no groups specifically for HrV+, AIDS related complex (ARC) or AIDS afflicted patients, said Milhander. He said that there are groups in the South Bend community. 
If an AIDS patient came to him for counseling, Milhander said that he would feel "a duty to warn" those who might be sexually involved with the pa­tient. 
He said that he believes the staff of the counseling center is ready to deal with possible AIDS situations on campus. "No matter who they (a patient) see they would be treated in a sensitive way," said Milhander. 
In regards to responsibilities to the University, he said "I have not been informed that I have a responsibility to inform the University (about a case of AIDS). In my professional ethics, my only duty is to warn a specific individual at risk." 
Teresa Herzog, drug educa­tion coordinator at the Univer­sity of Michigan, said that Michigan has an AIDS peer ed­ucation program. 
She said that they also have a safer-sex education program. 
Michigan offers free lilY testing in the health center on campus, said Herzog. She said that anonymous testing on a college campus was a first when Michigan first started testing two and one half years ago. She said that thousands of people have been tested. 
Many students are tested after having unprotected sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol, she said. 
December 1 is World AIDS Day, Herzog said. At Michigan there will be a rally on campus where the health center plans to hand out literature and in­formation to students. 
Free condoms are available in Michigan's health center and I Ierzog said that mostly women ask for them. She stressed that the health center does not force condoms on individuals, but rather asks students if they would like one. 
Norm Hobinson, associate dean of student affairs at Stan­ford University, said that the University has an AIDS policy. "The University policy treats peo~.le with AIDS like anyone else. 

He said that Stanford's em­ployment policy in regards to AIDS is non-discriminatory. Students afflicted with AIDS "are entitled to live in the resi­dence halls and use all facili­ties," he said. 
"Our concern is for the indi­vidual infected with the virus," said Hobinson. 
In regards to education, Hobinson said that the Univer­sity spends hours training their resident assistants (HA's) to deal with the issue of AIDS. lie said they teach the students specifically how to educate others in regards to AIDS. 
Hobinson said that Stanford recently had an AIDS Aware­ness Week on campus. lie also said that there are student groups on campus that work to promote AIDS awareness. 
There was an article in Brown University's Daily Her­ald on September 22 of this year called "Health Services Confirms AIDS presence at Brown." In the article Dr. Ed­ward Wheeler, co-director of Brown's Health Services, "said he knew of eases in which Brown students had tested positive for the IllY virus." 
Mary Lou McMillan, a health educator at Brown University, said in 1985 there was a lot of requests for AIDS education at Brown that has since slackennd. She said that now students appear to have a "ba.seline of knowledge." 
As there has bnen a decrease in request in the last two years, McMillan said that AIDS educa­tion has now beeome incorpo­rated into programs on Sl~xual­ity in general. "Studnnts arn now thinking of AIDS as an­other snxually transmittPd dis­ease (STD)," slw said. 
She said that pPople realize that AIDS can be transmitted

said that students are also in­
volved in peer education. 
McMillan said a big concern in Brown's Health Services is the issue of sex and alcohol. In a survey of students, 47 percent surveyed said that they had done something sexually under the influence of alcohol that they would not normally do. 
In addition, McMillan said that 22 percent of the students surveyed said that they had had unprotected sex under the in­fluence of drugs or alcohol. 
She said that she is concerned with the "It won't happen to me" attitude. She said she tells students "It's not who you are. but what you do." 
Brown has condom machines in the residence halls, said McMillan. She also said that education efforts are often through the dorms. 
"On one level I feel good that students are knowledgable, but I know that knowledge doesn't always changn behavior," McMillan said. 
In regards to AIDS policy, McMillan said that Brown's policy states that there is no reason why a IIIV positive per­son can't live in the dorms. She said that in the 17-22 year old age group "you don't see a lot of people with advanced cases of AIDS." 
Sarah Jane McCaffery, the Viewpoint Editor at The Ge­orgetown Hoya, said that the University recently started mandatory AIDS education programs in the residence halls for all freshmen. 
She said that condoms are not available on the campus.

Global warming, energy policy important environmental issues 
By DAVID CERTO News Writer 
A panel discussion on global warming led by the director of the Union of Concerned Scien­tists drew more than fifty peo­ple to Theodore's on Wednes­day evening. 
Howard Ris, head of the Cambridge, Massachusetts based research organization, was joined by Barry Lopez, pro­fessor of American studies, and John Halfman, professor of ge­ology. The lecture, entitled "The Heat Is On," was sponsored by Notre Dame's Environmental Action Club, the Institute for International Peace Studies, and the Recycling Irish. 


Correction 
In the Nov. 8 edition of The Observer, the attribu­tion for the Quote of the Day was accidently omit­ted. The quote was from Golda Meir. 
Prof. John Halfman The discussion covered the whole issue of global warming and its implications for the world community. Particular emphasis was given to its ef­fects on the U.S. energy policy. Ris began the presentation

Halfman, using his research in Lake Turkana in Africa, con­centrated on the cyclic nature of global temperature patterns. Using soil and ice core samples, he stated, temperatures from eras long past can be approxi­mated accurately. This data, centering on amounts of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes, could be used to gage the dam­age to the environment in re­cent years.

Last Wednesday marked the beginning of the Second Annual AT&T Collegiate Investment Challenge. College students across the country , including 14 Notre Dame students will be competing for over 200,000 dollars in cash and prizes. The top ten collegiate finishers will receive a six-day trip to the Bahamas where they will divide the cash prizes, including 25,000 dollars for the champion. 
The Challenge, produced by Wall Street Games, Inc., involves a.simulation of actual stock market trading. Participating students trade by calling an 800 number where "brokers" handle their trades. All prices are based on those in the actual market. 
Students may use any resources available to them including newspapers, business journals, stockbrokers, and their professors. 
Notre Dame students are participating in the Challenge, for a variety of reasons. Paul Odland, a junior marketing major, entered the contest after reading a brochure his roommate gave him. He said the Investment Challenge would be good experience since he has aspirations of involvement with the market in the future. 
Odland said, "I purchased four different stocks with the intention to buy and sell as much as possible." He also mentioned that there is a limit on the number of trades that can be made during the four month period. A trade involves either the buying or selling of any number of shares of a stock. 
Also participating in the Challenge is Mike Acho, a second year MBA student. He got involved after one of his finance professors passed around the information. 
Acho has no career interest in the stock market, but feels the contest will provide experience for "future personal investments. "He said," Although carefully planned decisions can be made, much of the outcome of the contest depends on luck." 
Another student is using this opportunity to speculate on stocks without using personal funds in order to gain experience gambling on stocks which are somewhat risky. 
Last year in the First Annual Challenge, 11,250 students participated from every state. Of these, 22 became "millionaires" and 12 went completely broke. This year's competition is expected to involve many more participants, and more students who will learn the ups and downs of the stock market. The founder of the Challenge is Tim DeMello, a former stock broker from Boston, who also founded Wall Street Games, Inc. He created this contest with the purpose of offering a realistic way for students to go through the trial-and-error phase of learning how the stock market operates. 
This year's contest began on November 1 and will continue through February 28, 1990. Students start with a fictional 500,000 dollar account, the option to borrow 500,000 more dollars, and a Standard & Poor's Stock Guide and will try to compile the most profitable portfolio by the end of four months.

Making computers user-friendly 
KATHY KIRIN 
accent writer 

or many students on campus, the word "computer" can carry some fairly negative con­notations: computer gceks, 

freaks, hackers, etc. However, thnre is a certain group of stu­dents on campus who would like to sec this image revised. They call themselves MadMacs, and they want to make the computer your friend. 
MadMacs is the official Macintosh users group of Notre Dame, composed of ap­proximately 150 students, whose general philosophy is to demonstrate to the campus that computers can be easy to use, and sometimes they can even be fun. 
The computer club was orga­nized eight years ago. However, the group has only recently re­ceived campus-wide exposure. In years past, MadMacs was a small. virtually unknown club whose members were primarily highly-tnchnological, well-in­formnd computer users. The reennt restructuring of MadMacs has made it possible for all users on campus to be­come involved and to learn morn about the computing and word processing world. 
Reggae medley plays Center Street 
COLLEEN CRONIN

T 
he days are becoming shorter, the clouds are bncoming more frequent, and it's al­ready snowed twice. Need to brighten up these dreary beginning-of-winter days? Center Street Blues Cafe has just the remedy: a reggae tour that is sure to spice up anyone's evening. 
The Reggae Connection Tour '89 features Devon Brown from Kingston, Jamaica, the Rude Beat League from Chicago, and Brah Kwame from Ghana, West Africa. The nearly three-hour concert has already garnered much attention at Illinois State University, the Holiday Star Theatrn. and other major clubs and mid-size auditoriums. Due to the recent rise in reggae popularity. Red Stripe Beer sponsored the Tour. Red Stripe is hailed as Jamaica's finest beer. 
None of these acts are newcomers to the reggae scene. The Rude Beat League has played most of the major clubs in Chicago, such as the Cabaret Metro and the Riviera, and had a hand in putting Rock Against Apartheid into motion. Devon Brown, straight from Jamaica, was a finalist in the 1985 Budweiser Talent Search, and in 1988 performed with Ziggy Marley and Jimmy Cliff. Brah Kwame has taken his Jungle Dance and songs of humanity through Europe and across the US. 
For up-and-coming reggae talent, this Tour is not to be missed. The show will be at Center Street on Thursday, November 9, at 9:00 p.m. If you cannot make it, you will have a second chance on Thursday, Nov. 16 at City Limits in Elkhart. 

"There are an estimated five thousand users on the Notre Dame campus," stated co­President Rob Cain. MadMacs is a support group for all these users, no matter what their computer skills may be, from basic word processing to high­level programming. 
MadMacs is providing support to Macintosh users in several ways. Members attend monthly meetings and receive newsletters containing up-to­date, practical information on a variety of computer skills, such as putting together business applications, and methods for producing graphs or tables. "Computers can be easy to use and user-friendly, and any stu­dent can create an impressive paper including computer-gen­erated tables and graphs easily," said Cain. 
MadMacs is currently selling public domain library diskettes, containing everything from game to business application programs. Interested students should keep an eye out for the November 15 computer fair, to be held in Theodore's, which MadMacs is planning in coop­eration with Design Alliance. 
Next semester, Cain is hoping to bring together various soft­ware venders, including Microsoft and Apple, to give the Notre Dame campus a chance to see demonstrations of their products. 
The future looks bright for MadMacs. With the University's decision to automate and up­date campus computing facili­ties, users will be needing sup­port and guidance more than ever. So why not give MadMacs a try? 
Frank is a solid sound from Squeeze 
JOHN LANE 
accent writer 
S 
queeze has recently released an 
excellent new album 
titled Frank. Mairily recognized for their singles compilation released in the early 80s, Squeeze should gain some new respect due to Frank. 
Squeeze is spearheaded by guitarists/vocalists Chris Difford and Glenn Tillbrook. Some critics consider the duo to be the best songwriting team since Lennon-McCartney. This claim is not unfounded as many Squeeze albums, including Frank, have definite Beatles' influences. Frank features great songwriting, and catchy beats set up the vocals of Difford and Tillbrook on songs such as "Rose, I Said" and "(This Could Be) The Last Time." 
Frank starts out strongly with "If It's Love" and "Peyton Place" which are both good pop songs sung by Difford. To keep the album from getting repetitive, "Slaughtered, Gutted and Heartbroken," a jazzy song with Tillbrook at the micro­phone, follows. Other highlights include "(This Could Be) The Last Time" which features good background vocals and "Love Circles" which is a sad song about the patterns of love. 
Frank ends as strongly as it begins. "Can Of Worms" is a great slow song in which Difford states that "There's so much to be learned/When you open a can of worms." "Dr. Jazz," written by keyboardist Julian Holland and containing good piano, and "Is It Too Late," a rockabilly-type song, round out the album. 
The main drawback to Frank is that it sounds too much like previous Squeeze albums. The band does not seem to have tr.ied any new sounds or experimented with any new music. But for the excellent sound fans have come to expect from Squeeze, Frank is a great al· bum. 
You have a chance to see Squeeze as well as listen to them. The Frank tour comes to Notre Dame when the band visits the JACC on Thursday, November 16. If you are a fan of pop music, you should check out Frank and look into the concert.

Talented Rebels running for Final Four in Denver 
game  of the  Final  Four last  
season, the Rebels  are  being  
picked by many  as  the No.  1  
team in the nation.  

Jerry Tarkanian, the Rebels worrisome coach, isn't certain about that. 
"I don't know if we're the No. 1 team or not," Tarkanian said, leaning back in a chair in his spacious office at the Thomas and Mack Center. "I think we're a real good basketball team. We've got some real quality players. 
"We're not better than everybody. This is not a team that is going to go out and destroy anybody. But on a given night we can play anybody." 
Tarkanian says last year's Rebel team was the best in the country defensively, and this year's team is "20 percent better." 
"I think we're going to be so good defensively, it's incredible," Tarkanian said. 
The Rebels beat the Soviet National team Tuesday night, 107-102, making them the only college team in the country with a 3-0 mark against the Soviets. 
Despite the return of most of last year's 29-8 squad and the addition of junior college standout Larry Johnson, the Rebels face some troubling questions. 
"We have the ingredients to be a great basketball team," Tarkanian said, but. ... 
Two of his big men from last year's team, 6-foot-1 0 center David Butler and 6-7 forward Moses Scurry, are out with academic problems. Tarkanian 
hopes Scurry will be back later this month, Butler in mid­December. And 6-10 forward George Ackles is out until December with a broken wrist. 
Johnson and Olympian Stacey Augmon, both 6-7 forwards, give the Rebels a "real quality front line," Tarkanian said. "But we're real thin in the backcourt." 
Guards Greg Anthony and Anderson Hunt, both 6-1, are back from last year's starting team. Backup guard Stacey Cvijanovich is out with a knee sprain and his role is uncertain. 
Tarkanian had been counting on Dedan Thomas as the club's third guard, but Thomas, considered the best playmaking guard on the California prep scene last year, failed to gain admittance to UNLV with a 2.2 grade point average. 
"I think if we had our third 
guard, this would have been 
our best team ever," said 
Tarkanian, who is 414-97 at 
Vegas with Final Four teams in 
1977 and '87. "Now, we'll have 
to wait and see. We have to be 
lucky. We have to avoid 
injuries, avoid foul trouble. 
"We have no third guard. If 
anything goes wrong, we're 
wiped out." 
One intangible dogging the Rebels is Tarkanian's long, bitter battle with the NCAA. The agency, armed with a U.S. Supreme Court order in its favor, is looking again at a 1977 penalty imposed on Tarkanian and UNLV.

1989 Heisman race is looking for a leader to emerge 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Associate Sports Editor 
/\fler ltmving college a year early to enter the National· Football League supplemental draft. Denver Broncos running baek Bobby llumphrey has emergf)d as the leading candidate for the league's Hookie of the Year award. 
Come to think of it, the former University of /\labama star ought to be awarded the lleisman Trophy as well. lie's compiling better statistks in the NFL than any of his former dassmates are putting together in the collegiate ranks. 
Like several of the other top lleisman Trophy candidates, Humphrey bypassed his final season of eligibility in order to enter professional football. 
Defending lleisman winner Barry Sanders, who left probation-ridden Oklahoma State for the Detroit Lions, was the most celebrated example. Other players who left a year early were quarterbacks Steve Walsh (from Miami) and Timm Hosenbach (Washington State) and running backs Sammie Smith (Florida State) and Tim Worley (Georgia). 
That lefl a bunch of second­tier candidates vying for college football's highest honor. The idea was that one member of that group. which included Notre Dame's Tony Hice, Penn State's Blair Thomas, florida's Emmitt Smith and West Virginia's Major llarris, would emerge as a front-runner or else a darkhorse would stand out just like Sanders did last year. 
Two small problems: None of those pre-season lleisman candidates are living up to expectations, and there aren't any darkhorses having a Sanders-type season. 
Hice would appear to be the favorite, having quarterbacked a team that has won 21 consecutive games. But disappointing passing statistics may doom the Irish tri­

captain's candidacy. 
The major problem with all the candidates so far this season is that none of them have delivered in the big games. Harris looked terrible against Penn State last weekend,Smith did not run for 100 yards as the Florida Gators failed to upset /\uburn and Indiana's Anthony Thompson couldn't deliver in the last two weeks against Michigan and Michigan State. 
Thomas has played well in his team's big games (Virginia, Alabama), but his team has not won either of those contests. His candidacy would receive a boost if the Nittany Lions upset the Irish Nov. 18, with Thomas playing like he did in the 1988 22-21 win over Notre Dame. 
The hopes of Air Force quarterback Dee Dowis went down the drain when the Falcons suffered consecutive losses to Notre Dame and Texas Christian. 
Notre Dame's Raghib "Hocket" Ismail saw his brief candidacy reach an end when he lost two fumbles against USC. It will be difficult for him to get back in the race for two reasons. 
First, it's hard to believe anyone has the guts and/or stupidity to kick the ball to him. Secondly. any ball he catches as flanker will come on passes thrown by Rice. As far as the lleisman is concerned, those plays ought to help Rice as much as Ismail. 
That makes it hard to pass up a guy like Houston quarterback Andre Ware, who is recording impressive numbers as the Cougar run­and-shoot offense takes pleasure in running up the score (particularly in a 95-21 win over an SMU team beaten a truly good football team; the Cougars have lost to Southwest Conference foes Texas A&M and Arkansas. Moreover, it's tough to vote for a guy who leads a team that is on probation and runs up the score, and still feel good about yourself the next day.

freshmen).  
But  Houston  has  not  yet  

That leaves Colorado quarterback Darian Ilagan, the latest media darling in the Heisman sweepstakes. Hagan is only a sophomore and only one part of a potent Buffalo offense. But he has the advantage of being the new kid on the block and having

performed well in his team's 
biggest games of the year. 
In a lleisman race like the one going on this year, that just might be enough to win it. 
/\rizona and Virginia both deserved to play in bowl games last season, but neither team was invited. Both teams should enjoy a postseason this time. 
Still, you have to wonder what it's going to take before people finally start accepting the Cavaliers as a good team. 
Led by quarterback Shawn Moore, Virginia is on the verge of ending Clemson's monopoly on the Atlantic Coast Conference. But the nation still hasn't seen the Cavs at their best. 
In a 34-20 loss to CIE~mson .. Moore was injun~d and out of action. In the Kiekoff Classie, Virginia was just plain bad. 
As for Arizona, wlwthnr the Wildcats upset USC in Tucson or not this wenkend, they have to wonder about what might have been. 
Arizona's three losses have come against Oregon, Texas Tech and California. The Cats are probably better than all those teams.

Rose admits to gambling problem 
CINCINNATI (AP) -Pete Rose said Wednesday he is getting psychiatric help for a gambling problem that became apparent to him only after he was banned from baseball for illegal wagering. 
"I bottomed out by losing my occupation," the game's most prolific hitter said. 
Until the very day he was banished from the sport, Aug. 24, Rose maintained he wasn't a compulsive gambler and had no reason to get help. He now says the lifetime ban made him reconsider. 
"I think once I had time after the suspension to sit down and realize that something that I love very dearly was taken away from me, and why was it taken away from me ­gambling -I just started thinking about that," he told 
The  Associated  Press  in  a  
telephone interview.  
"It  takes  something  to  

bottom you out. In my case, I'm kind of lucky that it happened now because I still have a good financial statement, I still have my health, I'm relatively young, I still have some earning years left and I have a young family that's growing up," he said from Los Angeles, where he was a guest on the Phil Donahue Show. "It could have been a lot worse, I guess." 
The former Cincinnati Reds manager said he hoped therapy improved his chances for reinstatement in baseball. Rose, who denies ever betting on baseball games, is eligible to apply next August. 
"I think the lords of baseball are very intelligent, very understanding and very fair," Rose said. "And all you can do 
· is hope they will continue to be so. "They have never said what to do but I think if they were going to, that (treatment) would be the first thing they'd probably say to do." Baseball spokesman Rich Levin said Commissioner Fay Vincent had no comment on Rose's treatment. Rose was banned by Vincent's predecessor, A. Bart Giamatti, who died of a heart attack eight days later. Prior to appearing on the talk show, Rose released a statement from Dr. Randolph Hillard, chairman of psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, who said he has spent about 14 hours with Rose during the past month. 
"Pete and I have concluded that he does, in fact, suffer from a clinically significant gambling disorder," Hillard said. "He has concluded that he is powerless before gambling, that he will begin an ongoing treatment program, and that

he can never again gamble on anything." 
Rose, who admittedly loves to go to the racetrack, said he hasn't placed a bet in several weeks and has no intention of going back to the track. 
"I think it's difficult, but I have to work hard to overcome it because I just don't want to take a chance of bottoming out the other way," Rose said. "I guess you could look at me as sort of a guy that got a warning by having a heart attack and got better, hopefully, not the type of guy who had a heart attack and didn't wake up. ... I guess it was a blessing in disguise the way it turned out." 
Rose said he never thought he had a problem because he didn't feel compelled to gamble every day. He has admitted to placing bets with bookmakers and frequenting racetracks and dog tracks. 
"I had a lot of free time and nothing else to do," Rose said. "All I did in the wintertime was work out during the day and if it was Saturday or Sunday or Monday, I'd bet on football games to enjoy them, or if it was the other days I might go to the racetrack, and I enjoyed it. It was fun. It was relaxation." 
After his ban, Rose went to racetracks a few times and said he made small wagers.

paid off. He led the Eastern League with a .331 average in 1988 and was promoted di­rectly from Class AA to the ma­jors, having never played a day in Class AAA. 
Walton singled home a run in his second at-bat on opening day and hit in his first seven games. He went three straight games without a hit in mid­April, then didn't go hitless in two consecutive games until September. 
Walton tore his right ham­string on May 10 and was on the disabled list until June 11.

Ram's Robinson is thinking positive 
(APJ-John Hobinson views his Hams as a 5-4 team, not oniJ that has lost four straight games. 
As he prepares for a visit from the 8-1 New York Giants Sunday. Hobinson is thinking positive. Instead of dwelling on the four defeats -two in the final seconds-he's taking the approaeh that the Hams are still in good positifln for a wild card playoff spot. 
"I judge a lot by how I feel," he says. "And I' rn not discour­aged at all. I actually feel more confident about us now than I did a week ago. The scary thing about a slump is, 'Will we ever play good again?' I don't have that feeling." 
The Hams, who started 5-0 including a win over Super Bowl champion and division ri­val San Francisco, suffered what might have been a devas­tating defeat in Minnesota last week. 
They scored what appeared to be the winning touchdown with 28 seconds left, then lost when the Vikings completed a "Hail Mary" pass to set up the game-tying field goal and blocked a punt in overtime for a safety. 
Hobinson, however, looks at 

Pitt matchup special for QB 
COHAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -Helatively speaking, the Miami Hurricanes' game Saturday at Pittsburgh will be pretty important to quarterback Craig Erickson. 
It's not just because he'll 

start for the first time in six 
weeks. 
His grandfather was an All­American tight end at Pitt in 1934, and he says he'll have "three or four families" of relatives from the Pittsburgh area at the game. 
"I really can't tell you until after the game what it's going to be like, but I'm looking forward to it," Erickson said. 
"They carne to our game at Cincinnati when I was a freshman, and I could hear them up in the stands. I don't know if I'll be able to hear them at Pitt." 
A crowd of more than 50,000 is expected as the seventh­ranked Hurricanes (7 -1) try to keep their national championship hopes alive against No. 14 Pitt (5-1-1). Erickson will make his first start since breaking a knuckle on his throwing hand against Michigan State on Sept. 30. 
The junior quarterback said he hopes to find time to tour the campus where his grandfather, the late Charles C. Hartwig, achieved fame. 
"He was a great football player, and there's a lot of respect for him up there," Erickson said. 
An annual award named for Hartwig, who died in 1950, honors the athlete who 
-
promotes the "best interests of Pitt athletics." Former winners include Mike Ditka and Tony Dorsett. 
Erickson said his mother (llartwig's daughter) and father, who live in West Palm Beach, Fla., will be at the game. His paternal grandmother might also make the trip from Boynton Beach, Fla., even though she had cataract surgery less than two weeks ago. 
"It's exciting for my morn and for the Hartwig family up there," he said. "But it's just another game for me as a quarterback.... It's pretty much a business trip."

golf through Tuesday. Taylor

saeks in two games and 12 for 
the season. 
Phil Simms, who missed two games with a sprained ankle will be back at quarterback, sending Jeff Hostetler to the bench after directing wins over the Vikings and Cardinals. 
Parcells, meanwhile, is as negative about four straight wins as Robinson is positive about four losses. 
"We haven't won anything," at the end,-what happened so far doesn't matter."

"Pain," is the operative word for this one, not only because of what the Oilers call the Astrodome but because of the Bengals' physical condition. 
The Bengals lost 28-7 to the Raiders last week without Boomer Esiason, who left in the first quarter after bruising a lung, and running backs James Brooks and Eric Ball, who also got hurt. 
Esiason was still spitting blood early in the week but should be ready. If not, it's

Nebraska QB forgotall about milestone 
LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) Gerry Gdowski is on the verge of one of college football's rarest accomplishments -1,000 yards rushing and 1.000 yards passing in the same season -and until very recently, he didn't even know it. 
The Nebraska senior has rushed for 828 yards and passed for 996, and the sixth-ranked Cornhuskers have two games left. At his current pace, he would go over 1,000 in each category easily. 
It's been done only three times before in NCAA Division I, by Johnny Bright of Drake in 1950, Heggie Collier of Southern Mississippi in 19S 1 and Bart Weiss of Air Fo.ree in 1985. 
"I saw something about that," Gdowski said. "If that happens, it'd be great. I think it's kind of a good opportunity. It's nothing I really expected to have an opportunity to do, but I just want to go out and help us win these next two games and if that happens in the meantime that would be great."

Holtz tries to downplay possible matcup with Buffaloes 
After Colorado's victory over--------­Nebraska last Saturday, nearly PVI~ry college football writer in the country is predicting that the Buffaloes will nwet Lou Holtz's Notre ~ ' Dame squad to decide the _,l'it, ~ National Championship on 8.. January 1. 
Holtz s1~ems to think that all of this prognostication is very Ken Tysiac premature, and says that the Football Notebook thought of a possible matehup -------­with Colorado In the Orange Bowl does not concern him at the present time. 
"I havn not studied Colorado." says Holtz. "Nor do I plan on even worrying about Colorado because we might not even be playing them. If and when our opponent is named, we'll get out the film when our season is over and look at it." 
Holtz has seen the Buffaloes ramble past Oklahoma and Nebraska on television the past two weeks. however, and offers a few observations. He seems particularly intrigued by their new scheme on offense which he says is a combination of a power-[ and a wishbone. 
"I think their quarterback (l)arian Hagan) is absolutely phenomenal. I think they have a very good deft~nse, obviously, but the problems they give you are that they can run power at you, they can run the option, they can give you the same thing as the wishbone, but now they can accentuate a great tailbark like (Eric) Bienemy." 
"I think they throw the ball better than we do," adds Holtz, "I don't think there's any doubt that Colorado may be the best football team in the country, based on the two times I've seen them." 
We'll have to wait at least until New Year's Day to lind out. 
Holtz seems to be a bit tired of answering questions about how he is going to avoid running up the score Saturday on what is widely acknowledged to be an extremely inexperienced young SMU team. To illustrate the fact that he will not take the Mustangs lightly at all, Holtz drew a parallel to the heavyweight boxing champion of the world. 
"The thing that always impressed me about Mike Tyson is that I couldn't tell when he was lighting a really good opponent or fighting somebody that wasn't really good," said Holtz. "He didn't go in there to fight for 15 rounds, I mean he went in there prepared to light for 15 rounds, but if that sucker lasted 15 seconds, he was going to light as hard as he could. I'd like our football team to have that same philosophy." 
Don't be surprised if the Mustangs look remarkably similar to Carl "The Truth" Williams when· they take the field on Saturday. 
Saturday will mark the last home game for many Notre Dame seniors, and players like Tony Rice, Pat Terrell, Pat Eilers, Anthony Johnson and Ned Bolcar will walk through the tunnel in uniform for the last time. 
"The four years have gone by really fast," reminisces senior split end Pat Eilers. "It's going to be a sad situation, really, because I had a great time here. So many people across the country have great affection for Notre Dame football, and the football players here have such great affection for the student body, that it really is a very unique place." 
"There's a story with each and every one of them," says Holtz of the seniors, "And if you go through as much as what this group of young men has gone through for the last four years, I think you always have special feelings about them. As for them going in to play their last game at the Stadium, I don't think it's hit them yet, but it will later in the week." 
The Irish will almost c1~rtainly wrap up tlwir school record 22nd consecutive victory on Saturday. Holtz thinks that his team's success over the past two seasons is due to a combination of factors. 
"What it (the streak) means is that we've been very lucky," admits Holtz with charactPristic modesty. "You look back and so many of those games could have gone either way. It also nwans that we're vnry talented, and we hatw been talentPd the last couple of years. I think tlw third thing that it says is that our assistant coaches have done an excellent job in staying close to tlw football players. 
"The streak does put a lot of pressurn on us just to keep winning, but I never thought this would become a reality by any stretch of the imagination." 
Many people associated with SMU football were outraged after Houston used their 95-21 win over the Mustangs on October 21 to build lleisman stats for quarterback Andre Ware (25-41, 517 yards passing in the first half, 5 TD passes in the 2nd quarter). The Cougars were merciless in their destruction of the Ponies, using th1~ir run-and-shoot offense to thoroughly humiliate the whole SMU program. The Mustangs won't forget that game, and at least one player has warned future opponents that some day the tables will be turned. 
"We're not always going to be like this," junior wide receiver Michael Bowen told The .'·;porting News,. "Someday we're going to be the powerhouse, and we'll remember every team that did this to us." 
Don't expect Holtz's Irish squad to arouse t.Pe ire of the Mustangs. "When the game is over, when the game is won. then I don't think you ought to keep scoring any more, " he says, "The last thing I want to do is embarrass another team."
