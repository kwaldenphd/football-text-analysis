The Observer Thursday , February 2, 1989 INSIDE COLUMN 


Good things come to those who 'throat' 
A few days ago I was heading out of the dorm to the library and one of my hallmates had the audacity to call me a "throat." I guess this was to be expected since we were having an SYR that night, but I was particularly disturbed by the fact that the hallmate who called me a throat was our rector. 
Throats are the only members of the Notre Dame population against whom it is completely acceptable to deride, ridicule and discriminate against. This is an outrageous miscarriage of justice. In fact, it's high time that one of us came out of the closet and proclaimed the true glory and preeminence of "THROATDOM." 
Let us begin by dispelling some of the heinous myths that are regularly circulated about throats. These myths are generated by a small, but influential portion of the campus that is vehemently anti-throat. These· people are not our friends. If you wanted a true version of what the people from Iraq are like, you wouldn't ask only Iranians. 
Myth # 1--"Throats are backstabbing S.O.B who frequently sabotage science experiments, steal notebooks and brown-nose their profes­sors." 
This may be true, but we have a legitimate excuse. When a youth from the inner-city com­mits a crime, the judge often rightfully takes into consideration the juvenile's background when he delivers the sentence. Well, the same consideration should be given to throats. Many of us have led lives riddled with lonely, rainy afternoons and the cold ostracism of our peers. Sure, sometimes we panic and do things we're not proud of. This is not the fault of the poor throat, but rather a function of society's relent­less mistreatment and supression. The latter is the cause of throat crimes and not the effect. 
Myth # 2--"Throats are shallow and have no personality.'' 
There is probably no more erroneous senti­ment alive on the Notre Dame campus today. The problem is that no one takes the time to get to know a throat. A throat can be a very interesting, sensitive individual. So the next time you see one of us up on the 13th floor of the library listening to class notes on a walkman or working a few weeks ahead in embryology, stop and talk to us: tell us what special people we really are. 
Those of you who are still reading are prob­ably saying: "Yes, I see that the throat has been slandered and maligned by modern civilization, but why should I want to become a throat?" I can offer two enticing reasons why one should pursue the flowered path to throat­dam. 
First, the actual throating act delivers a state of self-awareness and oneness that can only be compared to the nirvana plateau reached in transcendental meditation. Furthermore, throating requires no prior experience, just de­termination. Even a business major can try it. 
 

Greg Lucas Copy Editor 

Just imagine yourself, secluded away on the uppermost floor of the library. As you work your first calc IV problem, your mind focuses in on itself, leaving all the pain and rejection that is your life far behind. Your ears revel in the total absence of sound, save the gentle, reas­suring hum of the flourescent lights overhead. The hours of indescribable happiness pass like seconds and before you know it, the evil library warning bell is ringing and it's time to leave. But you are comforted by the fact that you will be back tomorrow night. 
The second reason why one should turn to throatdom is related to the relative monetary success of throats in the business world. 
This is a potent source of trepidation for the small group that I mentioned earlier who spread anti-throat propaganda. These people are the evolutionary losers. They know that un­less they poison the minds of all of those good students who would be throats had they not been brainwashed by a negative images, they would end up at the bottom of the natural selection totem pole. 
They are desperate people. I can speak freely of them at this point, because they have un­doubtedly not read this far. The fact that you have read this far shows that you are one of the brainwashed, good people who can be saved if you turn to throatdom. 
A recent study conducted by researchers at 
U. of C., Berkley indicated that the number of hours studied in college is inversely propor­tiorfal to number of friends, but directly propor­tional to income later in life. 
The decision is yours, but remember: you can always buy friends, but you can't buy suc­cess.

Wright, who had been taking most of the political heat on the issue, changed that strategy on Tuesday. His survey was de­signed, in part, to demonstrate that it was not Jim Wright alone who favored the pay increase.

He became a household name. Former President Reagan declared him a na­tional hero even though he had to discharge him as an aide. Songs were written about him, his face graced T -shirts and "Olliemania" swept the country. Conservatives vied for his endorsement in last members on both sides of the aisle. I have a pretty good idea of how they feel," Wright said. "They support 'regular procedure"'--which would mean committee hearings and a legislative schedule that would make a vote impossible before the Feb. 8 deadline. 

But when asked if he would permit a vote should members surprise him and demand one, Wright said, "If the members want it, yes, of course."

His critics in Congress and elsewhere characterized him as a loose cannon. The House­Senate Iran-Contra commit­tees said he was so obsessed with secrecy that he lied to Congress, the American people, the attorney general, the State Department, the CIA and the National Security Council. 
One of the first people to qualify as a potential juror in North's trial, which opened Tuesday, told the judge that and found 92 members publicly supporting a recorded vote on the pay raise. Only six said they were against it and seven were undecided. There was no response from 38 offices. 
It should be noted that adv­ocates of the pay raise have been reluctant to publicly indi­cate their support, for fear of the political fallout. 
Mark Johnson, Wright's spokesman, said it would be wrong to use any informal sur­veys to predict the results of the speaker's private survey. 
Snowfall of up to 9 inches was reported in the northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest. A blizzard warning was issued for parts of Idaho, and winter storm warnings were issued farther east. 
The snowfall at Seattle was enough to shut all runways at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for nearly an hour Wed­nesday morning. The snowfall at the airport, 2 inches and counting at midmorning, plus temperatures in the teens made it the worst wintry wea­ther in Seattle in more than three years.

That may be troubling, but a jury need not be composed of well-informed people to be fair, the legal experts said. Gesell himself recalled how many jurors lived through the Water­gate scandal in ignorance of it. 
"Of course it bothers me" that the well-informed jurors almost automatically must be eliminated, said Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, "but one always operates within the constraints."

Teen evicted from parents' home due to minimum age requirement 
Associated Press 
ZEPHYRHILLS, Fla.-­Fourteen-year-old Staci Elmer left for school Wednesday "tired, angry and sad" because she was kicked out of her par­ents' home in a court battle over a rule barring children from her small subdivision. 
''There are no rights for the younger generation. There are

no laws for young people. The Constitution isn't for us," Staci said bitterly over a bowl of cereal at her brother's house. "I'm angry at my neighbors and sad because I can't stay with my parents." 
She said it was hard making the adjustment to her tempo­rary new home, about six miles from the two-block-long mobile home park she was evicted from the day before because deed restrictions bar children under 15. 

"It was scary waking up this morning. I didn't know where I was at first," Staci said. 
On Tuesday, Pasco Circuit Judge Wayne Cobb rejected Beverly and Thomas Elmer's request to delay a Jan. 6 order. He said if Staci wasn't out of the house by 5 p.m. the couple would go to jail for 10 days. 
The judge said Staci, a quiet A-B freshman at Zephyrhills High School, may come home for visits, even for overnight, but may not move home per­manently until she turns 15 on April 7. She says she will move home then. 
"We have nothing against the girl; it's the principle," said Aline Murray. She is one of the neighbors who sued to preserve the adults-only status of the tiny mobile home settlement .

Arrest of youngsters indicate losing crack battle in war against drugs 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Two recent crack-related arrests, an 11­year-old alledged to be a drug courier and a 10-year-old crack dealer, left officials wondering if they're losing the drug fight. 
"Crack and drugs are so per­vasive that of course it trickles down into the lower grades," said Paul Berczeller, a spokes­man for the United Federation of Teachers. "You have young kids used every day as drug runners." 
Ginay Marks, a Brooklyn school board activist for 17 years, agreed: "I would say in terms of crack--and we thought heroin was an epidemic-­nothing has spread with such rapidity among our school children." 
The two grade-schoolers ar­rested in separate incidents less than three weeks apart of­fered examples of both street and school incidents, aut­horities said. 
The 10-year-old was arrested Jan. 15 after police watched him and a 14-year-old partner make a half-dozen crack sales in Wyandanch, Long Island. The 5-foot-tall boy had three $20 vials of crack and $226 cash on him when arrested. 

A family Court judge ruled Wednesday that he had com­mitted the crimes and sched­uled sentencing for Feb. 10. The boy faces up to 18 months' detention in a youth facility or two years' probation. Char~es against the 14-year-old were pending. 
On Tuesday, an 11-year-old boy arrived at his Bronx elementary school carrying wflat looked like his lunch bag. Inside, school officials found 411 vials of crack, most in 10­packs worth $50 apiece. 
The special education stu­dent told police his 17-year-old brother had given him the drugs. A search was on Wed­nesday for the brother, said police spokesman Officer Hugh Barry. 
The 11-year-old faced a Fam­ily Court hearing late Wednes­day afernoon. 
"When an 11-year-old child with special learning needs is exploited as a drug carrier, it reaffirms my belief that drugs are the most serious problem our youth must confront," said Schools Chancellor Richard Green.

"We don't expect that from an 11-year-old youngster. It's like carrying a loaded machine gun in a playground," said Warden. 
Board of Education spokes­man Robert Terte, saying much of the problem is on the streets around the schools, noted that the number of drug arrests on school property was down in the past year. In 1987, the figure was 114; for 1988, it was 94. 



EPA proposes ban on apple chemical 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The govern­ment proposed a ban Wednes­day on a chemical that makes apples appear more appealing and last longer, citing "an in­escapable and direct" link to cancer. 
While the Environmental Protection Agency said the cancer risk, an estimated five deaths for every 100,000 people exposed, is not high enough to warrant an emergency action to remove the chemical from the market, it urged its manu­facturer to withdraw the chemical until a final regula­tion banning the chemical can be issued. 
Officials said formal agency action ordering the chemical withdrawn will not likely come for another 18 months and then is likely to be challenged, a process that could take another one year to three years. 
The object of the EPA's con­cern is a growth control chemi­cal called daminozide, which is sold by the trade-name Alar. The chemical is absorbed by the fruit and has been used by apple growers since the early 1970s to spur even growth, reduce spoilage and help preserve apples so they can be sold all year. 
Alar's manufacturter, Uni­royal Chemcial Co. of Mid­dlebury, Conn., immediately challenged the EPA findings and promised to contest any government ban. The company said it would not withdraw its product voluntarily. 
"We don't see any basis for taking (Alar) off the market," Uniroyal spokesman Yanis Bibelnieks said. "All of the studies that have been done since 1985 have supported our position that Alar poses no signficiant health risk." 
He said it was "inap­propriate to make any judg­ment based on interim results" cited by the EPA. 
Bibelnieks said Alar produc­tion has been reduced by about 75 percent since 1985 .

of Trustees. If Notre Dame wants to be a prominent graduate institution, then it must have a plan to increase its graduate stipends to competitive levels. Continuing the annual increase at the rate it has been increasing per year (approx. 8% this last year), barely keeping up with tuition increases, is not enough if we want to catch up with our peer institutions. Graduate students need to keep impressing the gravity of this situtaion on the University ad­ministation. 
Summer support is another problem that graduate students (particularly in the humanities) need to bring to the University's attention. In many depart­ments students are supposed to support themselves during the summer while they prepare to take their composition exams. This obviously creates great duress, and it is the cause of many good candidates abandoning the programs to go to other institutions. Graduate stu­dents need to ask whether the Univer­sity has any plan to solve this problem. 
In another area, one of the most bitter exeriences in the past few years for Notre Dame graduate students has been the suspension of the Graduate Club's ability to dispense liquor. As a consequence of this, the Grad Club now operates as a food establishment and coffee house. The only alternative place for graduate students to socialize freely is the AlumniSenior Club. But the A,lumniSenior Club is primarily aimed at the undergraduate population. In a University that claims to become a top graduate school, it is an unacceptable inconsistency . that there be no social space for its graduate students. Given the fact that the University is not in the position to request another liquor license, the problem still remains that no provision is made for its graduate students in terms of an establishment comparable to the University Club (for faculty members) or the AlumniSenior Club (for undergraduates). Perhaps an 
extension to the AlumniSenior Club would be a solution, providing an area where graduate students could so­cialize in an environment more con­ducive to conversation and relaxed socializing. Or perhaps a special location in the new residential area for graduate students could provide this ... But in any case the acuteness of the problem will not be perceived until graduate students take an active part in informing the community about their concerns and needs in this regard. 
Garry Trudeau 
These ·are some of the most obvious 
areas where the University needs to 
show its commitment to graduate edu­
cation by implementing some improve­
ments. But other questions such as 
what University student services need 
to be improved, what deficiencies at 
the departmental level need to be ad­
dressed to improve the different 
graduate programs, etc., all will have 
different answers depending on the 
area of the graduate student population 
that is concerned. The diversity in the 
graduate student community is such 
that an accurate total picture can be 
given only from a joint effort on the 
part of the whole graduate student 
body. Graduate students are the only 
ones -that know these problems first 
hand, so they need to speak up if .they 
want changes to come about. 
It is clear then that a dialogue must 
begin between graduate students and 
all sectors of the University for Notre 
Dame to start the path towards becom­
ing a prominent graduate institution. 
Aware of the importance of this de­
velopment, the Graduate Student Union 
has organized its "Graduate Student 
Life" program--a series of workshops 
with University administrators to 
promote dialogue between the graduate 
student population and the university 
Administration. (The first workshop of the series will be held on Monday Feb. 6at Theodore's. Father Edward A. Mal­loy, C.S.C., President of the University is the guest speaker.) 
There is already a positive change in the general attitude of administrators and the various other sectors of the Uni­versity towards graduate students. If nothing else there is an openness and a receptivity to graduate student con­cerns that was not there before. Graduate problems are being consid­ered seriously and little by little the cloud of misunderstanding that was of­ten the main obstacle towards change is being lifted. What is developing is a community more informed about their graduate student constituency as well as a growing awareness of the need for changes. Graduate students can con­tribute greatly merely by taking advan­tage of opportunities like these to offer some feedback as well as first hand in­formation about the changes they per­ceive to be necessary.

SARG improves student-alumni relations 
JANICE ARCHER accent writer 

O
n a campus as busy as 
Notre Dame's, it is diffi­

cult to keep track of the on­
going activities, and even 
harder to know what organi­
zation is sponsoring a given 
event. One behind-the-scenes 
organization is the Student­
Alumni Relations Group, also 
known as SARG. 
SARG is a service organiza­
tion formed in 1981 with the 
purpose of functioning as a 
liaison between students and 
alumni. The group represents 
the Alumni Association on 
campus, with a three-fold 
program encompassing its 
service goals : to serve the 
students, the alumni, and the 
community of South Bend. . One important activity 
SARG has organized is the 
Student-Alumni Reception. 
Held today from 4:45 to 6: 15 
p.m. in the Gold Room of the North Dining Hall, alumni in diversified career fields will be answering students' ques­tions. They will be next to biographies of themselves, taking inquiries about their career choices, job demands, or other concerns students interested in their fields may have. 
SARG also sponsors the Distinguished Alumni Lecture Series. Participating alumni return to speak about a career, hobby, or social ser-

vice they perform that the student body would find inter­esting.' Any organization that would like a representative speaker from its field of in­terest can contact SARG. SARG will then use its re­sources to search for such an alumnus. Previous lecturers have been Mike Flynn, a lawyer from the Los Angeles firm of Paul Hastings, Janofski, and Walker, and Donald Barr,_publisher of Sports Illustrated. 
A few of the many other activities in which SARG is involved include: the Senior Send-Off Picnic, Geographic Clubs, reunion tables at the upcoming JPW, and Career Day for the Preprofessional Society. 
Since SARG is concerned with both students and alumni, it participates in 

several projects that serve the vast number of past graduates. The Notre Dame Magazine is mailed to alumni, and for those who are visually impaired, SARG has audio tapings of the _articles available. Another service is the hospitality center set up in the north dome of the ACC during home football game weekends. The Alumni Asso­ciation provides this gather­ing for visiting alumni, and SARG members are present to help. 
Not only is SARG working on the student-alumni rela­tionship, but it is also reach­ing out to include the commu­nity of South Bend in its activities, such as the upcom­ing event Christmas in April. It is currently searching for independent programs that will involve them with local social concerns. 
In the spirit of the Year of Cultural Diversity, SARG is encouraging diversity within the group by welcoming new members. It promotes partic­ipation and suggestions from any organization, and is cur­rently developing programs to deal with the issue of cul­tural diversity on campus for the benefit of all. 
SARG, in its ninth year, has strong leadership guiding it into the future. Its well­organized structure and dedi­cated members ensure that this group will remain com­mitted to its goal of serving the entire Notre Dame fam­ily. President Mike Whitton said, "We want students to know SARGis here, willing to aid any organization and do what we can to implement their ideas." SARG can cur­rently be reached through the offices of the Alumni Associa­tion in the Administration Building.

Bizarre Peepshow 
COLLEEN CRONIN accent writer 
S 
porting some very strange lyrics, Peepshow, the latest by Siouxsie and the Banshees, is at the least an interesting album and is over­all just a great album. 
This cult-punk band from the mid-'70s has put out some of the most bizarre music in the punk realm of the music world. Even though Peepshow is a much cleaner and simpler album than its past work, it still holds true to the group's dark and bizarre image. 
The first song to be released, "Peek-A-Boo" is one of the more upbeat songs on the album, and is not typi­cal of the rest of the album. Regardless, "Peek-A-Boo" is one of the best songs on the album and hopefully will not succumb to radio overkill. Dealing with soft-core pornog­raphy, the song catches the listener from the very start with strange sounds similar 
Calvin and Hobbes 

to the record being played 
backwards. 
In sharp contrast to the up­
beat "Peek-A-Boo" is the 
macabre "Rawhead and 
Bloodybones," and the lyrics 
are true to the title. I could 
find no hidden meaning in the 
song--it is simply a 
nigqtmarish, gory lullaby of 
sorts. The music, which is 
sing-song and even borders on 
childish, defies such lyrics as 
"We're down here, held here, 
dragged here, and drowned 
here by rawhead and 
bloodybones." The sounds of 
a child crying at the end of 
the song add the final bizarre 
note to the song.
Another of the more warped 
and stranger songs on the al­
bum is "Carousel." With 
music that ominously mocks 
a carnival carousel, Sioux's 
lyrics are enough to keep any 
child away from a carnival. . Though quite morbid, 
"Carousel" is also one of the 
better songs on the album. 
None of the songs on Peep­
show are quite the same 
either musically or lyrically, 
thereby keeping the listener

from becoming bored. "Burn Up" is an excellent, catchy dance tune, while "Last Beat of My Heart" is the closest Siouxsie has come to a bal­lad. Sioux befriends a scarecrow in "Scarecrow," and "Rhapsody" brings atten­tion to the suppression of the Stalinist era of Russian his­tory. Peepshow makes for a good headphones album with sound alternating between left and right, and har­monicas and accordions lurking beneath Sioux's puncturing voice. 
The Banshees began in 1976 with Sid Vicious, who later went on to the Sex Pistols, on drums. The Banshees have put out nine other albums, with Through The Looking Glass in 1986 being the predecessor to Peepshow. 
Peepshow is definitely Siouxsie through and through with dark morbid lyrics and off-the-wall sounds. Unlike previous albums, the music does not overwhelm Sioux's unmistakable voice, but adds to it and makes it all the more interesting to listen to.

Mourning's 17 points leads Georgetown over Seton Hall 
Associated Press 
LANDOVER, MD-­Freshman Alonzo Mourning scored 17 points and ignited a second-half surge that enabled sixth-ranked Georgetown to solidify its hold on first place in the Big East Conference with a 74-66victoryoverNo.10Seton Hall on Wednesday night. 
Georgetown led 40-39 when Mourning made a driving layup over Ramon Ramos. The basket started a 9-2 run that gave the Hoyas a 49-41 lead with 9:09 left and Seton Hall never got closer than three points thereafter. 
Georgetown made 14 free throws in the final 3:04, includ­ing five by Anthony Allen. 
Memphis St. 99, FSU 82 
TALLAHASSEE, FLA.-­Sophomore Elliott Perry scored a career-high 33 points and no-miss Rodney Douglas had 17 points and 15 rebounds to lead Memphis State past No. 8 Florida State 99-82 in a Metro Conference basketball game Wednesday night. 
The Tigers, 14-7 and 3-2, jumped to a 9-0 lead and were never threatened as the Semi­noles shot just 35 percent and saw an eight-game winning streak end. Tony Dawson scored 22 points for Florida State, 16-2 and 4-1. 
Memphis State led by as many as 19 points in the first half and by 87-58 late in the game. 
Louisville 108, Virginia Tech 95 
LOUISVILLE--Tony Kimbro and Keith Williams scored career highs of 21 and 19 points, respectively, pacing a balanced attack as No. 7 Louis­ville pulled away in the second half to beat Virginia Tech 108­95 Wednesday night. 
Louisville, playing its first full game without injured cen­ter Pervis Ellison, improved to 15-3 overall and took over the Metro Conference lead at 4-0 thanks to Memphis State's 99­82 victory over No. 8 Florida State. The Seminoles are 4-1. 

Clemson 85, UNC 82 

CLEMSON, S.C.--Kirkland Howling made a 3-point shot and two free throws in the final minute as Clemson stunned No. 3 North Carolina 85-82 in an At­lantic Coast Conference bas­ketball game Wednesday night. 
The victory was the just the second for the Tigers over the Tar Heels in the last 20 meetings and the first since 1985. 
North Carolina led 82-80 on a pair of free throws by J .R. Reid with 1:21 left but Howling's 3­pointer with 53 seconds remain­ing gave the Tigers a one-point lead. Mter a North Carolina miss, Howling was fouled and hit both ends of a one-and-one with 24 seconds left.

Wadkins ready for LA Open 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES--Lanny Wad­kins begins one of his favorite portions of the PGA tour this week in the $1 million Los An­geles Open. 
"I'm really looking forward to it," the 39-year-old veteran said Wednesday before a prac­tice round on the tough old Riviera Country Club course. 
"I'm playing good right now. I could have won all three tour­naments I played in this year." 
Wadkins finished sixth in both the Tournament of Cham­pions and the Pebble Beach Na­tional Pro-Am and was fourth in the Bob Hope Classic. 

"My problem is that I just gave away too many shots early in the week each week, then had too much ground to make up," he said. 
"I was throwing away too many shots. A couple of bad drives a day cost me too much. 
"But the last round I played (a 67 at Pebble Beach) was the best driving round I've had this year. That gives me a lot of con­fidence. 
"And the next four tourna­ments I'm playing, I've won at one time or another. That's a very good feeling." 
Of his 18 career victories, 10 have come in the first three months of the season. Two of them (in 1979 and 1983) have been in this tournament on this course, one of Wadkins' favorites. 
"And every time I win early, I win more than once in the year," said Wadkins, a former PGA champion who won twice last year. 
"I think I come out playing scared. 
"You work all year long to get ahead of the other guys. Then it comes the first of the year and you're back to even with them again. 
"I don't like to be even. I want to be ahead."

"If they picked a team in the country where you come up with the invisible athletes who are very suuccessful but never in the headlines, Keith Robin­son would be first-team All­American," Phelps said. "He's probably the most underes­timated player on this team and yet he's probably the glue to our success. The guy that's always consistent is Keith Rob­inson.''

Men's indoor track ready for Saturday's Meyo Invitational 

I KAPLAN 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
Weekly indoor track action continues for the Irish this weekend as the men's track team plays host to the Meyo In­vitational on Saturday. 
Some of the most competitive atheletes in the nation will be in attendance, especially in the "Meyo Mile," an independent invitational mile run that will host a field of Olympic-caliber runners. 
Topping the list of atheletes that will be participating in the Meyo Mile is John Quade of Arizona Universtiy, who won last year's competition by run­ning the mile in 3:57.3. 
Giving Quade competition in defending his title will by Richie Martinez, who has run the mile in 3: 55 and was a finalist last year at the Olympic trials in the 1500 meters. 
Also included in this all-star cast are: Butch Brown, who has run the 800 meters in 1:45; Liam O'Neil, whose best time in the mile is 3:58; Michigan's John Trautman, sporting a four-minute mile; and Loyola's Ed Slowikowski, who won both the mile run and the 1000 meters at the MCC Track Championships held at Notre Dame two weeks ago. 


In what is considered to be one of the top invitationals in the country, teams such as Pit­tsburgh, Georgetown, Ken­tucky, Arizona, Michigan, and Michigan State will be attend­ing, and Dartmouth and Brown will be sending individual com­petitors. 
"This meet is going to be in­credible," said senior co­captain Ron Markezich. "It will be good to get in some fast races against these kind of teams." 
Last week, Notre Dame travelled to Wisconsin to par­ticipate in a tri-meet with Wis­consin and Iowa State. The Irish fell to both teams, partly because some key members were out with sicknesses and partly because of off­performances. 
The purpose of this meet for the Irish will be to get back on track and to record some qual­ifying times for upcoming championship meets. 
"This meet gives us opportu­nities to get great times so we can enter the Central Col­legiate Championships and to get some qualifiers to the up­coming IC4A's (Inter-Collegiate Association of Amateur Atheletes of America)," said Head Coach Joe Piane. 
The Irish expect excellent times from all runners not only because of the outstanding competition but also because the Meyo track itself is one of the fastest in the country. 
"This invitational is prob­ably one of the best in the country," said Markezich, who will be running his first meet of the season on Saturday, "mostly because everybody wants to run on this track be­cause it's so fast." 
Two of the team's top run­ners, however, will miss the meet because of injuries. Junior co-captain Yan Searcy has a sore leg and fifth-year senior Dan Garrett has ten­donitis in his foot. 
Another exciting event will be the two-mile relay, which will consist of the most compet­itive runners outside of the Meyo Mile. 
"I can single out the two-mile relay as a great race because Pittsburgh, Georgetown, Dartmouth and Kentucky will be competing," said Markezich. 
"We hope to get qualifiers, and the two-mile relay is one event that has the potential to qualify for the NCAA's," said Piane.

Irish ready for MCC matchup 
Liebscher 's play may be key to ND win against Detroit 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
When 5-8 sophomore guard Sara Liebscher of the Notre Dame women's basketball team takes the court, oppo­nents do not have to worry about strong-arm tactics, scowls and verbal abuse. 
In fad, to look at the native of Davenport, Iowa, one might think that the recent battle scars covering her cherubic cheeks make her a pushover. 
But as soon as the ball is put into play, Liebscher's quiet in­tensity takes over and her ac­tions speak for themselves. 
Her ability to drive and create scoring opportunities has kept her opponents on their heels all season and as the squad's second-leading scorer, she has been lighting up the scoreboard for 9.5 points per game, as well. 
Liebscher has developed into one of the team's most consis­tent players, stepping into a starting role for the Irish and becoming a pivotal player in the team's success. 
"I think she's one of those 
people who is a coach's type of 
player," said Irish head coach 
Muffet McGraw. "Sara always 
listens to what you what you 
want her to do then goes and 
does it. She's very poised under 
pressure and has good concen­
tration on the court, so people 
follow her example." 
Evidently, her teammates 
have indeed been following her 
lead, especially from the free 
throw line where Liebscher has 
hit an incredible .842 of her 
shots to lead the team this year, 
because fellow sophomores 
Krissi Davis and Karen Robin­
son are not far behind her.

threat this season as well, hit­ting 57 percent of her shots to boost the Irish to tenth nation­ally with a .494 field goal percentage. 
But Liebscher has done more for the team than just score baskets. 
She has absconded with 30 steals and dished out 53 assists. And, with the loss of the team's leading rebounder, senior Heidi Bunek, for the rest of the year, she has stepped in to pull down 4.1 rebounds per game. 
So has Liebscher's new found success changed her mild­mannered demeanor or altered her work ethic? 
No, far from it. 
"It's not my place to do anything that's not in the team's game plan," said Liebscher. "I just try to keep a positive attitude and work as hard as I can everyday to im­prove. The rest just happens."

"Dave has worked hard on his doubles," said Bayliss who possesses a career record of 300-109. "He has taken a lot of pride in his play and is a big part of the team."

"Karen and I are totally dif­ferent players, so I try to offset her and complement her," said Liebscher. "I'm not a bois­terous or loud player, as far as getting people going, but I try to pull people aside one on one to spur them on and give them confidence." 
Liebscher has needed to keep some of this confidence for her­self, as she came to Notre Dame with a slightly different basketball background than her teammates and had to make some adjustments. 
She spent the first six years 
of her career playing six-man 
basketball in Iowa, which uses 
three guards exclusively for 
defense and three forwards 
only on offense. 
"Its definitely a tough transi­
tion," said Liebscher. "Mter 
never playing defense or cross­
ing half court and only using 
two dribbles, it takes a while 
to adjust." 
But Liebscher almost did not 
have to worry about adjusting, 
because she did not earn a 
scholarship to Notre Dame un­
til late in her senior year. 
She had decided to become 
the fifth member of her family 
to attend Notre Dame, regard­
less of whether she played bas­
ketball. 
"I loved the sense of family 
unity here," said Liebscher. 
"Regardless of the scholar­
ship, I wanted to come here be­
cause I've always been 
impressed with the people and 
the sense of tradition here."

"When you play a team that is a step down from those you've played, you feel more confi­dent. We weren't afraid of this team having played two of the better teams in the country."

improve my play and in the process, hopefully add more and more to the team." 
Liebscher will get the chance to help the Irish tonight as the team takes on Detroit on the road. 
Notre Dame won in their first meeting, 76-67, with the help of Liebscher's ten rebounds, and the Irish will try to keep their MCC record perfect by tallying a seventh conference victory. 
"We won't try to do anything different," said McGraw. 
"We'll have to contain them on the inside and pack in the zone, but other than that, our press was very effective last time and we'll probably use it against Detroit."

... 
You read it here first: Sooners will take it all 
Now that we're unofficially halfway through an­other frenzied season of NCAA basketball, it's time to look back at some stunning developments and ahead to possible Final Four contenders. 
First of all, I picked Oklahoma preseason to take it all (honest, you can ask both of my friends), and I'm going to stand by that call. Mookie Blaylock doesn't get half the credit he deserves, probably because Stacey King is always on the floor with him. And the supporting cast isn't shoddy either. Last year, ,this team needed seasoning--this year the Sooners have gelled and have a score to settle. 
Second, if Boston College somehow wins the Big East conference tournament, we may actually see every team in that conference in the Final64. Think about it: Pitt, at .579, has the lowest overall winning percentage among the nine teams (outside of BC's .471), and the Panthers own wins at ranked Syracuse, Seton Hall, and home against No.1 Okla­homa. By the way, Boston College has the confer­ence's leading scorer. You never know. 
Upsets are so frequent that the term is becoming obsolete. Alaska-Anchorage, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Cal-Riverside and, yes, Valparaiso have all had their days in the sun after enduring years of door­mat status. It's incredible that 5-12 Valpo, which competes in the brutal Association of the Mid­Continent Conference, can beat the Irish and then lose to Northern Iowa by 18, but it happens. It is the beauty of college hoops.

Used to be, a top ten squad like Illinois could look past a trip up the road to Evanston to face anemic Northwestern. Now the Wildcats take the Illini to the wire before folding. There are no gimmes. One of these years, the Ivy League representative in the Tournament is going to topple the No. 1 seed in some regional. Just watch. · 
As far as what lies ahead, look for Syracuse to rise from the ashes like no other team in recent memory. Think the Orangemen remember confer­ence losses to Pitt, Connecticut, St. John's and Vil­lanova? They play each of those teams (three at home) in the next two weeks. Derrick Coleman and Sherman Douglas will wreak havoc, and Syracuse will be the hottest team entering the Tourney. 
Just a plug for a small school in Pennsylvania that might just do some damage: Robert Morris College is running roughshod over the mighty Northeast Conference, has a 15-4 overall record, and upset West Virginia in the Mountaineers' (15-2, 9-0 in the Atlantic 10) home opener. RoMo, which plays its home games in front of capacity, 1;000-fan crowds, will make the tournament and could upset. 
Other teams to watch: Cal-Santa Barbara (15-2),Missouri (at 18-3, the Tigers have one of the best in the country in Byron Irvin) and Florida State {16-1). Missouri might actually win a game or two in the Tournament for a change, as will the Gauchos and the Seminoles. Pretenders: LaSalle {15-4, 7-1 in the Metro Atlan­tic) looks good with All-American candidate Lionel 
Simmons averaging 30 points and 11 rebounds a game, but don't expect much from the Explorers. They're in trouble out of conference.
