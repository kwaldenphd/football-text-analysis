Notre Dame's modem architects don't build them·like they used to 
Bring back Maginnis and Walsh. 
This duo is not as weU known as other figures that lurk in the history of this campus, but these tw:o ac­hitects' influence can be observed in many buildings on campus. Alumni, Dillon, Zahm, Cavanaugh, Breen­Phillips, Farley and the Law School are the creations of their architectural firm. 
These buildings and the ones that preceded them, represent Notre Dame. When driving up Notre Dame Avenue, the traditional main entrance to the University, the golden dome ofthe administration building is in the distance and the Law School and Alumni Hall are in the foreground. The Maginnis and Walsh buildings ~ave greeted people at the entrance to campus for more than 50 years. 
These buildings have the "collegiate gothic" style: ivy on the walls and Notre Dame slate roofs that makes you think "college," that makes you think "Notre Dame." 
The Maginnis and Walsh buildings were mostly built in the 1930s and 1940s. They tried to continue some of the style that dominated the buildilfWl that preceded

"collegiate yuk." While this was a popular style in the 1960s, so was long hair and tie-dyed clothes. That is to say that times have changed. 
The newer EUerbe buildings are not as unattractive, partly because they are more "in style." Times will change again and in 1 0 or 20 years they too may be viewed with abhorrence. 
The Ellerbe buildings paint a frightening picture for the University. Current plans have new dormitories and a new classroom building as construction prerogatives for the fairly near future. While the towers and the Pasquerillas are not as gastly as some other Ellerbe dor­

responsible for most of the buildings built on this campus since the 1950's. One of their first creations was O'Shaughnessy Hall of liberal and Fine Arts, constructed in 1952. Had any fine arts been used in the construction of that building, it might not have been so awful. 
Popular folklore relates a story that O'Shaughnessy Hall had the same design as a grade school in Min­neapolis, from where both EUerbe and Ignatius O'Shaughnessy had come. 
This legend would account for the doors opening into the hall (in an elementary school there would be lockers along the wall and the doors would not protrude out as far) and the low height ofthe restroom fixtures (to better accommodate children). 
According to Thomas Schlereth in The University of Notre Dame: A Portrait ofIts History and Campus the stories are not true. The building was just poorly designed as famous architect Frank Uoyd Wright noted in a visit to campus. 
Since that building, EUerbe and Associates have con­structed many other buildings in a style known as The style of Notre Dame 
should not be changed. Too 
many EUerbe buildings 
might do this. At other 

schools you can see the result of expansion. There is a nice core ofolder build­ings and then, packed in every other space is some new monstrosity. The result is the deterioration of the campus. 
There were other architects before Maginnis and Walsh who have had a positive affect on the campus, most noteably Francis Kervick and Vincent Fagan. Both taught at Notre Dame's School ofArchitecture for more than 30 years. 
These two designed Lyons, Morrissey and Howard. They collaborated with Ralph Adams Cram on the South Dining Hall. 
The North Dining Hall may have new china and big· ger trays, but it still looks like a high school cafeteria. 
Fagan, Kervick, Maginnis and Walsh dominate the South Quad. Whoever designs the new buildings should spend some time there. They should look at what makes the old buildings stand out and fit in. Then, in styles similar to the older buildings, they should design the new ones. 
Either that or build them in Elkhart.

30 programs to be represented at Center for Social Concerns Festival 

By KATIE CRONIN 
News Staff 
Those forgeting to read the 
"yellow pages" in The Observer two days ago can.still find out what you need to know about community 'St:rvice from 6 to 9:30 tonight at the Center for Social Concerns Festival. More than 30 student groups and 
community agencies will be 
represented at the festival, accord­
ing to Kathy Royer, the festival's 
coordinator. 
Included among these groups will 
be the Big Brothers and Big Sisters 
programs, the World Hunger Coali­
tion, and the Neighborhood Study 
Help Program, Royer said. The Shel­
ter for the Homeless and the Logan 
Center will also be at the festival, she 
said.

Parenthood ofRhode Island for nine years. The organization provides counseling on birth control and pregnancy and performs abortions. 
She said she did not disclose her ouster from the church because of publicity that would follow. 
Word of the excommunication came during an anti-abortion program broadcast Tuesday on several cable television outlets. The show's narrator, Father John Ran· dall, made the disclosure, calling her "public enemy No. 1 of all babies being killed in the womb in Rhode Island."

the large turnout. "It makes people think when I00,000 people get together for one cause," he said. 
"It's important that we come every year and show our presence. We are one of the prominent Cat­holic universities In the country. It's just a shame there aren't more here," he added. 
Many of the protesters from around the country left to lobby members ofCongress after complet· ing the two-mile march to the Supreme Court building. However, several dozen moved through police lines at the building and knelt to pray and to chant "Stop The Killing" and other slogans. 
They were warned they would be arrested if they remained, and after several minutes police began taking people into custody. 
In Washington, club members at· tended a meeting at which Indiana Senators Richard Lugar and Dan Quayle, both opponents ofabortion, encouraged the pro-life efforts but expressed limited optimism about anti-abortion efforts in Congress. 
Nevertheless, Theresa Har­rington, a freshman at Saint Mary's said she was glad she took the time to join the march. "As Catholics, it is something we should believe in. We can't let this issue: die: through apathy," she said. 
"Ifanyone is going to keep it alive, it's going to be us, the younger generation."

Royer said such programs offer "education through involvement." 
"It's an opportunity to express yourself and your values," she added. 
Royer said the CSC's challenge is to present an interesting oppor­tunity to participate to all the dif­ferent people at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. Royer added that she felt students are broadening their in­terests. 
There are a large variety of programs in which one could become involved, Royer said. 
More than I 000 students are presently involved in at least one area of community service or social action, she said. 
The Neighborhood Study Help Program has the laragest number of participants, according to Royer. 
There are approximately 300 stu­dents who volunteer two hours a week in the study program, which provides tutoring for South Bend children, she said. 
The Dismas House is a new program that is working to establish a community ofstudents and former prisioners, Royer said. The program, which is designed to rehabilitate former prisoners, is looking for in­terested students, she added. 
Students may come to the Center for Social Concerns Festival tonite if they want to find out how to become involved, she said.

Nicaraguan rebels divided, U.S. mllitary aid will not help 
AaMK:iated Press 
WASHINGTON-A U.S_-sponsored Nicaraguan rebel unity group ­central to President Reagan's plan to resume military aid to the insurgents -has failed to heal the deep divisions that have plagued the war against that nation's leftist government, prominent Nicaraguan exiles say. 
Many of the exiles, longtime op­ponents of Nicaragua's Sandinista government, also expressed doubt that even renewed American military aid can avert the rebels' ul­timate defeat as long as the move­ment is run by leaders the exiles contend are hand-picked by the U.S. government. 
Several added that the only realis­tic hope now for ousting the San­dinista government is d~ect U.S. military intervention to crush the Soviet-supplied Nicaraguan army ­an option the Reagan administration has repeatedly rejected. 

The grim assessment by leading Nicaraguans in Miami, Washington and California comes as Reagan prepares to ask Congress for as much as S100 million in military and non-lethal aid for the Contra rebels ­a proposal expected to reignite bit­ter debate over Central America. 
Administration and congressional officials say the success of Reagan's expected request hinges on per­suading moderate House members that the United Nicaraguan Opposi­tion, UNO, the rebefs' principal umbrella group, poses a unified and effective democratic alternative to the Sandinistas. 
"UNO will have to show that it is the legitimate political leader of the Contras, that it controls the military and has a platform for a democratic society for Nicaragua," Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., Senate Foreign Rela­tions Committee chairman, said yes­terday. 
But Nicaraguan exiles, interviewed by The Associated Press, questioned UNO's success in unifying and controlling rebel ranks after itwas created at the administra­tion's urging last June. The AP inter­viewed 22 anti-Sandinista Nicaraguan exiles about their views on the political and military situa­tion. 
"UNO is designed to do battle in Congress, not to do battle in the front lines, with the people of Nicaragua," said Silvio Arguello­Cardenal, a former Nicaraguan vice president, now living in Miami. "It owes its existence ... exclusively to ... U.S. intelligence agencies that 
Voyager discovers planet Uranus has clouds, winds and 14 moons 
PASADENA, Calif. -Voyager 2, racing toward the climax ofits his­toric sightseeing cruise to Uranus, has found clouds and winds in the planet's atmosphere and dis­covered two more moons, NASA said yesterday. 
The newly discovered satellites raise the total of known Uranian moons to 14. They are the first "shepherd moons" found orbiting Uranus, Voyager imaging team leader Brad Smith said. 
Shepherd moons are so named because their gravitational forces are believed to herd the planet's nine known rings into their narrow shapes. 

Clouds swirling in the Uranian atmosphere also were discovered by the Voyager spacecraft, said Ed Stone, Voyager project scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propul­sion Laboratory. 
"This is the first time that any discrete (distinct) clouds have ever been detected in the atmo­sphere of Uranus," Stone said during a news conference yester­day. 
Some ofthe clouds were tracked as they moved around the planet, traveling at different speeds at various latitudes. 
"In other words, there are winds there," Stone said. JPL astronomer Richard Terrile 
said that each of two shepherd moons measure 12 to 18 miles in diameter. They were discovered Monday in photographs taken by Voyager, said Smith, a University of Arizona astronomer. 
The two moons were found "inside and outside the epsilon ring," the outermost and widest of the nine rings, and were designated as 1986U7 and 1986U8 until they are formally named, he added. 
Seven other moons have been discovered by Voyager since late December, and the planet's five major moons were discovered ear­lier by telescopes on Earth. None of those 12 moons are shepherd moons. 






Lawmakers find no captive MIAs 
provide it direction and exercise strict every-day control over its military operations and political pronouncements." 
Jose Medina Cuadra, a Nicaraguan attorney living in Miami, said he resigned from UNO because "the group was set up to function on paper, but not in action." 
Even with a big infusion of U.S. military aid, the rebels "can never overthrow the Sandinistas on their own," Medina said. He said he would support direct U.S. intervention in Nicaragua "because the Soviets and the Cubans have already intervened and control Nicaragua." 
Conservative exiles sharply criticized the inclusion of former Sandinista officials, Arturo Cruz and Alfonso Robelo, in the triumvirate that runs UNO. They hold Cruz and Robelo responsible for the San­dinistas' confiscation of their property and they contend the U.S. attempt to'broaden the rebel move­ment by including them has deepened divisions. 
The third UNO leader is Adolfo Calero, head of the CIA-organized Nicaraguan Democratic Force, FDN, the largest rebel army. But his presence, too, has been divisive, with rival rebel factions charging that UNO's management of S27 mil­lion in non-lethal US. aid -mostly food, medicine and clothing -is in­tended to subjugate them under the conservative FDN. 
Armstrong Wiggins, a spokesman for an Indian contra group, Misurasata, said UNO has used the 
U.S. logistical aid to divide Indian or­ganizations and lure Indian fighters into the FDN at the expense ofother groups.

WASHINGTON -Members of Congress who visited Vietnam and Laos "did not receive anything" to encourage the belief that American servicemen are still being held prisoner there, the head of the delegation said yesterday. 
"I don't want to raise any false hopes," Sen. Frank Murkowski, R­Alaska, told a news conference called to report on the delegation's recently concluded Southeast Asian tour. 
Murkowski, chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, said the panel will hold hearings next week on the possibility American prisoners remain in cap­tivity in Southeast Asia more than a decade after the end ofthe war. 

A top Pentagon official had said last week that the Vietnamese government has pledged to join U.S. authorities in investigating nearly a hundred "live-sighting reports" of Americans missing in Indochina. 
Sen. Dennis OeConcini, D-Ariz., another member of the delegation who returned last week from the nine-day overseas tour, said yester­day: "It is my belief that it is very, very likely that there are some Americans there." 
But DeConcini refused to ·say whether he believes these Americans actually are prisoners, raising the possibility they may be defectors -a spectre the Pentagon long has acko.owledged. 
Murkowski said the delegation had heard reports that some Viet­namese were apparently selling or

bartering bones believed to be those ofAmerican servicemen, but said he had few details. 
In some instances, Murkowski said, Vietnamese wanting to get out of the country had offered to produce bones if the government would permit them to leave. 
He noted that in recent months, the Vietnamese government had asked the populace to look hard for the remains ofsoldiersfrom the war. 
Officially, the U.S. position is that the government cannot flatly rule out the possibility that American prisoners are still being held.

Now, whoa there. Don't start getting all excited and red in the face. I know this Is a very nice· sounding album. No, I'm not deaf. I can hear The Dream Academy just fine. And that's the problem. 
What I hear Is three Thompson­Twin clones taking themselves way too seriously and spewing out some 111st over a minutc: long. Hence the name Minutemen. 
Hut on the band's latest album, 3·Way fit' (For Last), the band has gone through a transition, an evolu­tion. The songwriting has mellowed musically but not lyrically. The lyrics are very political, running sharply against Reagan's America.

of the most laughable lyrics in a long time accompanined by inof­fensive but thoroughly forgettable melodies. 
... Three Thomp­son-twin clones taking them­selves way too seriously ... 
My only solace in listening to this album is knowing that The Dream Academy is representative ofthe bland, unchallenging British pop clogging American airwaves right now, a welcome reverse ofthe situation ofapproximately five 
. years ago when the only good music was comingfrom England. Yes, America is back on top In the music world, but unfortunately many Americans don't seem to realize that. 
What's wrong with this album? First of all, it's a very bad work of art. Yes, albums are works of art and this one must have been painted by someone attempting to hold the brush in his toes or something. It's sad but true. 
Lyrics like the following from "Bound To Be" wouldn't be so bad ifthe Dream Academy were joking: 
You shone a ltght in my life that could ltght up Park Lane I was feeltng neroous because I missed mygravy train. 
The band sings such examples of idiocy with complete earnestness, punctuating what is probably singer/songwriter Nick Laird­Clowes' innermost feelings and collected observations ofa short lifetime. Tame, harp-like guitars strive to provide an ethereal aura but succeeding only in presenting a poor immitatlon ofpsychedelia. 
There is much more orignial music out there in the world than what The Dream Academy makes, and eight dollars might be better spent elsewhere. 
We have lost all our morals and still gotpride. 
The band does not push the lyrics on you the way some other bands do. Instead, the band subtly presents its ideas in songs that are so musically solid that you don't seem to notice the harsh lyrics. Boon's guitar weaves in and out of the songs with Spanish-sounding melodies, demonstrating further the mastery he was able to achieve on the instrument which made the Minutemen one ofAmerica's most critically acclaimed bands. 
And one of the highpoints on the album has nothing to do with politics at all. The Minutemen present an excellent cover of Credence Clearwater Revival's classic "Have You Ever Seen the 'Rain?" 
So what have you learned at lunch today? 
You now know about a great band that has just put out a great album but has also lost the bond that held them so tightly together. God rest D. Boon. God rest the fat soul.

Selective divestment will produce the best effect 
The University of Notre Dame should con­tinue selectively divesting from its holdings in South Africa in order to encourage a long­term attitude change in both whites and blacks, by using a low inducement level and by creating dissonance, as all companies fol­lowing the Sullivan code do. According to so­cial psychology the next two points may be the answer to South Africa's racial problems. Low inducement has been proved by social psychologists to attain the highest degree of attitude change. Dissonance creates the change, yet, since a low levelofinducement is needed for a strong attitude change, the Sul­livan code provides a theoretical answer. 
Randy Battistoni guest column 
Social psychology studies the relationship 
between social institutions, social groups and the individual behavior. The problems in South Africa deal with social institutions (companies), .social groups (apartheid vs. African National Congress), and individuals (President Botha.and Nelson Mandela, for ex­ample). Thus, SQcial psychology would be the place to look for reasons to divest. The fact that the United States has made significant strides in overcoming racism in the past few decades through these theories should be proofthat a feasible solution exists. 
Low inducement will attain the greatest at­titude change. When an attitide changes with little or no inducement, the change becomes internalized. For example, if a person was asked to move to a different country he would most likely be opposed to leaving, yet if his brother explained some logical reasQt'Is in favor of his leaving he might change his at· titude. This change in attitude would be easily taken into this person's set of values because

Bradley T.jobnson, Chairman Indiana Federation ofCollege Republicans 
Apartheid supporters should get facts straight 
Dear Editor: 
While I do not intend to answer the vicious, ignorant rigamarole presented by Chris Ed­wards in his piece on apartheid, he makes one analogy which ought to anger Americans. To compare the American "green card" with the "pass" the South African black has to carry is obscene. The "green card" is designed to welcome and include; the; "pass" is there to degrade and exclude. Edwards, a government major, needs to go back and take an introduc­tory course on American citizenship. 
His whitewash of the pariah government in Pretoria and the underlying racism of his at­tack on blacks parallel closely the strategy being used by Jerry Falwell. Edwards and Fal­well have accepted the fundamentals of apar­theid. 
Professor Ktrn Trembath's contribution to the discussion -his comparison between ac­tivism in the United States in the late 60s and the current struggle against apartheid -can only be described as self-indulgent. But there are more fundamental problems with his ap­proach. 

Those who support divestment have never assumed it will be sufficient in itself to bring Pretoria to the negotiating table. Divestment must be seen as a vital, further pressure, sup­porting black protests inside the Republic. As to those protests, Trembath shows no under­standing of their character. Black South Africans are very tired ofbeing told by middle­class whites that they "are suffering enough as it is" -so no further disruptions please! It is extraordinary to find a theologian arguing for business as usual with South Africa's militaryI industrial complex. 
Trembath should read the recently pul;>lished Kairos Document, signed by 150 leading South African Christians · blacks and whites from every denomination. It reminds us that "the church must avoid becoming a 'third force,' a force between the oppressor and the oppressed." Rather the church "must now take sides unequivocally and consis­tently with the opressed" against an "irreformable regime that has lost any legitimacy . a tyrant . that vi­olates the common good persistently and in the grossest manner." 

Laura E. Greeman Notre Dame graduate student 

Campbell's not treated fairly by the boycotters 
DearEditor: 
As chairman of Indiana College Republicans, I often come across many events taking place on campuses around the state. None have so far shocked me as much as the Notre Dame boycott "of Campbell Soup Com­pany. 
In recent columns in The Observer by Sue Yadlon (Oct. 14, 1985) and Patrick Markey (Dec. 10, 1985), support was given to the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC). The conditionsofour migrant workforce have admittedly been deplorable in the past, but the arguments asserted by Yadlon and Markey have no bearing on the recent Campbell boycott. 
I will initially concede that the issue is non­partisan; my interest is solely as a concerned student afraid of a movement on my home campus ofPurdue University. 
After investigating this lssue just a little deeper, I found that Campbell had been vic­timized by FLOC supporters (originated in 1979 by Baldemar Velasquez) simply because ofthe company's high national visibility; such is an open admission ofFLOC itself. 
I also found that Campbell has hired a full­time Ombudsman (an Hispanic by the name ofAfredo Carrizales) to act a a liaison between migrants, farmers, and Campbell; and that 
Doonesbury 
Campbell has acted with FLOC in establishing a joint commission to constantly monitor migrant working conditions. The Committee is headed by former Secretary of Labor John Dunlop. 
Campbell has contracts with 90 farmers in Ohio, and 98 percent of these harvest mec­hanically. Records corroborate that Campbell is in full compliance with the Fair Labor Stan­dards Act, that Campbell has recognized the right of migrant workers to organize and that Campbell is directly subsidizing living condi­
tions that exceed Ohio requirements. 
Not only is Campbell working on behalfof these workers, but the company is also keeping the families ofthese workers in mind by establishing full-time day care centers which serve to care for migrant children much as a private nursery does. 
The question of pesticide usage in fields where migrant workers have been harvesting has also been raised. I unearthed more facts detailing Campbell's safety and health re­quirements that exceed even those of the En­vironmental Protection Agency. 
Campbell Soup Company, like so many other industries, has been boycotted simply because of its size and recognition. The at­tacks launched against the company by Notre Dame's FLOC supporters are unjustified, un­founded and unfair. Campbell has been a leader in improving migrant lives, and for its efforts is being boycotted. The question will be put to your student body very soon as to 
he freely decided to go. Since he decided that 
going would be to his advantage he most 
likely would internalize this behavior as good. 
On the other hand, if that same person was 
paid a large sum ofmoney (high inducement) 
to go, the attitude would not be internalized 
since he could tell himself, "I only went for 
the money." 
Divestment would bring about high 
economic pressures for the whites, who in 
turn might change their .policies yet would 
still feel hostility toward blacks. Notre Dame, 
as a Catholic university, should maintain its 
investments and try to create a low induce­
ment atmosphere both on apartheid and on 
the black community through these com­
panies. The low inducemnt should be a 
rationale for moving toward equality. Notre 
Dame's investments may very well help this 
low inducement work. 
The Sullivan code creates agreat deal ofdis­
sonance which in turn creates change. The 
dissonance theory states that attitude change 
can be achieved by causing one to engage in 
behavior that is discrepant with one's at­
titudes. Brehm, a social psychologist, showed 
that if we choose between two attractive al­
ternatives, our attitudes toward the rejected 
alternative will become more negative. 
The dissonance theory was used in the United States to fight racism. Social scientists, who evaluated how well this theory worked, ·found it to be effective. This theory creates inconsistency between a person or a group's attitudes and their actual behavior. If the be­havior was done under low inducement, then not even an excuse for the behavior could be made and thus the attitude would change. 
This new attitude would be internalized. 
An example of this appeared when the 
public schools were desegregated. A child, by 
law, had to go to school, yet the parents could 
send him to a private segregated school. Since 
Garry Trudeau 
the majority of the population could not af. ford a private school, children soon met with other children of a different color. Many of these students became friends with the colored students and if these children had been taught that all blacks were mean he would have to change his attitude since he was not forced to choose a black as a friend. 

The Sullivan code enforces desegregation and lobbies against all apartheid laws. Thus the Sullivan code has both low inducement and dissonance making the attitude change the greatest possible according to most social psychologists. These attitude changes will ob­viously take longer than if divestment were used but when these changes are done there will be no tension. A complete change must be made so that no racial tension exists be-. cause the whites cannot just leave like many other colonists have been able to do. South Africa is as much the whites' homeland as it is the blacks'. 
Another reason for an attitude change is 
that both the blacks and the whites want total 
control, thus either the blacks or the whites 
will be unp·rotected and unheard. The solu­
tion to South Africa's problems can theoreti­
cally be attained through selective divestment 
from those companies that do not follow the 
Sullivan codes. 

A selective divestment from those com­
panies not following the Sullivan codes 
provides a solution to the crisis because these 
codes bring about low inducement and dis­
sonance which social psychologists feel bring 
about the greatest attitude changes. Notre 
Dame, in its Catholic American tradition, 
ought to do to its neighbor, South Africa, as it 
had done unto itself.

The old game still exists under the alcohol policy 
It has been a year and a half since the ad· ministration ofthis University decided on and proclaimed a new alcohol policy which proscribed the numerous abuses of alcohol that many here had grown so fond of. 
Robert Anderson guest column 
That odious edict shook this University as only the greater movements of history can. Student fury and protest then were vented in the usual modes. The banners were unfurled. The editorials dashed off. Student government convened, its president presided, and its representatives and policymakers con­templated how to escape the punishments from an inclement administration. 
In solemn tones they proposed decorous retaliatory mea'!ures lO counter a so indelicate spanking. Initial outrage and clamor against what numbers viewed as a flagrant act of in· 
uMlce in the spirit of arbitrary executive 
1wer died out long ago. Peace, order and a 
eneral calm were restored again to our ·ampus. And once more the sun rose and set n turns a<·cordlng to accustomed fashion. 
Looking ba<:k we see that the results conse­ucnt on the new policy have been mixed. erhaps an indication ofone such result is an pparently increa'!Cd display of, to put it lainly, public drunkenness. On a typical 
·riday and Saturday night along common aths leading back to Notre Dame, you are apt 
o sec many ofthe mighty men and women of otre Dame mar<.·hing home to end a night of 1bscenities, and the like. Or the mornings er to see sprawled out here or there on a 
·ampus lawn, draped over a bench, or ropped up against a tree one of the mighty eroes in his triumphal sleep. 
Such thing.-; point to a further increase, or ·ertainly at least to no decrease, of idcspread and ingrained habits of alcohol huS<'. The old game carries on under the new y~tt·m. Though the particular fashions of xcess that existed under one system have hanged, their source hasn't. Remove one evil nd another, mayhe even worse, follows in its la<:e, with the prospect of things getting 
orse. In the fat·e of that, it seems fitting· by some 

t'l·konings, urgent -to put a piece of ancient isdom hefore the rea'i<mahle young men and omen who Notre Dame attracts, to ponder, 
·hould they he so inclined. Everyone, 
hatever they say, knows it well. Though one nay try to ignore it, pushing it a'iide and out of ight, or dismiss it, saying it doesn't matter, 1ver and over again it will keep coming to nind. Though some may claim they don't 
helieve it, a moment later you will find them going hack on what they just denied. 
That wisdom is simply this: "For any con· tentmcnt in this life a lot ofrestraint is going to he necessary." Wht·ther it he anger, fear, the sexual desire, the appetite for food, or that of alcohol, or whatever, each requires a good lkal of moderation if we are ever to become that kind of ptople we truly wish to be and to accomplish anything really worthwhile. Any pa.s.'iion, if let to run it'i course beyond reason and proper mea~ure, can make life wretched. 
Yet on the contrary, many here think, ifthey think about the matter at all, or at least act as though they thought, that drinking isn't wrong as long a'i it doesn't harm anyone else · a convenient and specious excuse whenever one wishes to drink without limit. 
Behind this widely-held idea is a babyish conception of human conduct that says not· hlng can be wrong unless it hurts another per· son. What a person does to himself is his own business. Is this the most mature and robust practical principle of moral reasoning stu· dents here can come up with? 
That morality deals with fair play between people, between ourselves and others, is ad· mitted readily. The rules of conduct here dictate that each apportion to others what is their due. When things go wrong here the evils usually are obvious, like war, treachery, selfishness, cruelty, and so forth. That people will ever be kind and helpful to one another, however, all the while with passions and reason, desires and sober judgment, conflict· ing, is on any conceivable view, nonsense. 
Good people make a good society. One can· not blithely pass along to the other without first the personal struggles and denials for self· mastery. It just doesn't happen. That people ever can find contentment and fulfillment apart_ from self-control is equally unreal. To gratify every urge and impulse leads to everything that is the reverse of real satisfac­tion. 
Now with respect to the use ofalcohol, how over-indulgence affects the person himself and those with whom he comes in contact is well-known: all the disgrace, degradation, shame, and so on, inflicted on himself, as weU as all the unjustice, bedevilment, and misery visited on friends, family, and others around him. And, like other appetites, the desire for intoxicating drink grows with indulgence, so that one wants it when without any and even after having had one's fill. 
Because human nature is blighted with crazy desires, infirmity of mind, and weakness of resolution, and because no one will get along well in this life if he surrenders to all desires, good habits are the indispensable means for disciplining oneself. And unless one has been encouraged to like what is right and dislike what Is wrong from the earliest age, it will be next to impossible to acquire good habits later in life. Such encouragement doesn't come easy nowadays. 
One reason is because the young by nature tend to incline toward pleasure. Not yet having learned to regulate their feelings, en­joyment is their ruling principle. They are careless in questions of conduct, annoyed at self-denial, ready to indulge their desires for pleasure, give way to feeling and do as they please. 
Another reason is because we live in an in· dulgent society, one growing more and more compliant to appetite. Restraint is effete, soft· ness manly. In addition, college students' situations are especially precarious, because they live in communities usually steeped in habits of excessive drinking. The strength of the herd works on the weakness of the in· dividual to lead by degrees to a common way oflife. 
As a result, ifwe are to be in touch with the realities of life, we need to recognize that people usually drink before they know what it is to drink with moderation, that they learn of that often only after having exceeded it, and that they are not seldom locked into patterns of excess before there has been opportunity to instill right habits. Perhaps one's native weakness and vulnerability to societal pressures can begin, in part, to be com· pensated for by reflecting on what one is doingwhen drinking and what can come ofit. 
Once upon a time, in this century in fact, alcohol was thought an intrinsically bad thing, or at least practically incapable of being enjoyed in moderation. When one sees how its use so readily sinks into abuse, the in· capacity of reason its use effects, and how the smallest excesses create incessant havoc, the reason for so stern a condemnation ofalcohol altogether is understandable. 
Still, teetotalism, an extreme in the reverse 
direction, is not obligatory or anything close. 
On many grounds it is wrong to think it is. The 
virtue of temperance does not require total 
abstinence unless you are the sort who cannot drink without inescapably doing so too much. It does not even demand that people always remain perfectly sober. Temperance ack· nowledges the place for the amenities of human life in our action, among which are in· eluded the pleasures and beneficial effects of alcohol consumption. But temperance does say that one should only go so far and not fur· ther, drinking in the right measure and not beyond. 
The interior moral quality of every person is his own responsibility. It cannot be ignored nor delegated for experts to handle. Nor can you coddle or coerce a person, unwilling or malingering, to virtue. Nothing could be less likely. For these reasons the doctrine of tem­perance is unpopular and will continue to be so. It would be unwise to expect things ot· herwise. 
But ifyou always evade the task ofmoderat-


Human life is precious no matter the situation 
Would you, if held in a foreign country at the mercy of a dictator, shoot one person to save the lives of nine other hostages who the dictator is intent on killing? If you agree to shoot the one, the dictator will set the othC"r nine free. Ifyou refuse, all ten die. 
joe Murphy 

here I stand 
This was the question Gary Gutting and John Moody asked my philosophy class fresh· man year. The class filled the Ubrary Auditorium, and almost all of the students stated they would kill the one to save the ot· hers. 
In answering the question, I proposed anot· her question, as a good philosopher should do. Suppose the next day the dictator takes you to a starving village and promises to feed halfofthe people ifyou will kill the other half. Ifyou do not act, they will all die ofstarvation anyway. Would you kill half of the people to save the other half? 
The only thing I really had changed was the numbers; the principle remained the same. Once one reduces human life to its benefit to the majority, where does one draw the line? 
I was fortunate to have learned the prin­ciple was important, and not the numbers; however, one man who has yet to learn this is three-term Governor Richard Lamm of Colorado. Among the Governor's comments over the years are the following: To the ter· minally ill, Lamm suggests, "We've got a duty to die and get out of the way .... I'd take the money we could save in reforming the health· care system and put it into restarting America's industrial system and in the educa· tion system." The governor compared the dying to "lea\·es falling off a tree and forming humus for other plants to grow up." 
To the parents of mentally handicapped children, Lamm has questioned spending thousands ofdollars per year to educate these children "when after four or five years all they do is roll over." 
More recently, Lamm said it was futile to spend money on AIDS patients who have no chance of recovery. Lamm said, "There are two types ofAIDS patients, either you're dying or you're dead." 
Using the governor's logic, one easily can rid the world ofsuch problems as poverty by telling poor people they have to duty to kill themselves because they are an economic burden to society. What Lamm has confused is ing drink now, if you never learn to drink by halves but only to your fill · convinced that this is a trifling worry and that you can handle your drinking whenever you wish, or that it doesn't matter in any case what you do to yourself. the habits of dissipation acquired here at college may leave you with an irreparably-skewed appetite and hence 'in· capable ofcontrolled drinking. 
Ifyou persist In those ways, a day Is destined to come, hopefully before all has gone to pieces and the burden ofmanaging your life Is forced on shoulders of the professional kind, when you discover the falsehood of such beliefs and realize you are on a course of dis· appointment and sorrow. 
A grim and fatalistic note to end on? Think It over. 
Robert Anderson is a graduate student in medieval studies at Notre Dame. 
that people do not exist for the economy's 
benefit. Instead, the economy exist for the 
people's benefit. 
The alternative to the quality oflife position 
held by Lamm is the traditional view that all 
life, no matter how great a burden to society, 
is a priceless commodity. 
My concern Is with social justice, and one 
cannot be concerned with social justice un· 
less one first cares about human life, In aU Its 
forms, regardless of Its usefulness or produc­
tivity. 
No one has a duty to die. No one has the 
right to kill. Everyone should have the right to 
life. 
This week we revived the dream of Martin Luther King Jr. and we mourned the millions ofunborn infants whose silent screams go un· heard. Our world is often unjust and prejudiced against those It deems unfit, un· healthy, old, defenseless or poor. 
The world cannot wait for the cause of SO· cialjustice to be picked up by another _Martin Luther King Jr. Instead, you and I must do what we can, where we are, to make a dif­
ference. ­
Pope John Paul II said, "When the sick, the aged or the dying are abandoned in loneliness, we will stand up and proclaim that they are worthy oflove, care and respect." 
Ifyou and I do not stand up for the cause of social justice, who will?

Off Campus and Alumni dominate in interhall hockey action at ACC 
By ORLANDO RUBIANO 
Sports Writer 

Tuesday night at the ACC produced two mismatches, as both Off-Campus and Alumni posted easy wins in interhall hockey action. Off­Campus, the defending league champions, had no trouble whip­ping Flanner, 9-0, while Alumni downed Fisher, 10-2. 
In its first game of the season, Off­Campus showed why it is league champion as it created and con­verted scoring opportunities from the starting to the final minute. 
Captain Ed Sullivan, Pat Collins, and Chris Almon each accounted for two goals apiece. "This trio of Sul­livan. Collins, and Almon should be a very productive unit for us throug­hout the rest of the season," said co­coach Dave Herlihy. 
In addition, Scott Johnston, Nick Stock, and Tom Unger were each credited with a goal. 
Co-coach Mike Dudas feels that the key to his team's success Is that his players play with great intensity and desire. That was quite evident throughout the match. 
"We were obviously pleased with our team's performance tonight, but we won't feel satisfied until we win the whole thing in the end," said co­coach Kevin O'Shea. 
If this game was any indication of what is to come, look for Off­Campus to reign as inter-hall cham­pion again. Flanner is now 0-2. 
However, Alumni may have something to say about Off. Campus visions of the league title. For the second time In as many games, Alumni used its opposition for target practice. 
This time the victim was Fisher (0-2), as Alumni stormed by, pasting its opponent, 10-2. Alumni, In Its two matches, has outscored its rivals by a 22-5 margin. 
Doing the damage was captain John Kaltenmark, who had the hat trick. Jim Vizzini and Steve Vairo both scored two goals apiece. "The team is playing well, but we still haven't faced our toughest competi­tion,'' said Kaltenmark. 
In Monday night action, Dillon upped Its record to ( 1-1 ) by virtue of its 1·0 victory over Hoi y Cross/St. Ed's ( 1-1 ). Keenan ( 1-1 ) won Its first game by skating past Stanford (0-2) by a 4-1 score.

"Things are just geuing under­way,'' Walsh's captain Claire Welsh said of her team, but those words could very well describe the situa· tion of all the women's interhall bas­ketball teams. 
Forfeits, team withdrawals, and most recently, game cancellations have characterized the young season for many of the teams. 
At this point Badin tops the stand­ings with a record of 1-0 after defeat­ing Farley "B." Pasquerilla West is 0-l with a loss to rival PE. The remaining teams are all even at 1-1, but those records are misleading. 
When the Breen-Phillips "B" team withdrew, Lyons and Walsh both gained wins by forfeit. Lyons' loss was also on a forfeit to Farley "B." 
This weekend's games have all been cancelled. Scheduling placed the games in confiict with the men's varsity game against North Carolina. 
"So far It's been a good season (for the team). We have a lot of people who have not come out before," said Badin captain Maureen Connelly. Badin defeated Farley "B" 32-8. 
In one aspect, It was not a bad loss for Farley. "We call ourselves 'St. }udes,' after the patron saint ofhope­less causes," captain Barbara Grant revealed. "We have three team goals: to break double figures, to keep the opponent out of triple figures and to do something interest­ing each game." 
The defen4ing champions, PE, defeated PW but lost to Lewis "B." Captain Colleen Donnelly was somewhat surprised at the loss. 
"We have a better team than last year." she said. "We really haven't gouen offto a good stan. We need to get a little more organized, but whatever happens, happens." 
"We have a real young team, a quick team," said Lewis captain Teresa Buliavac. With Ellen Mouch and Katie Cavanaugh leading the backcourt attack, Lewis surprised Farley's "A" team. 
"We were leading Lewis at the half," Farley's captain Marllu AI· meida recounted. "We had choked a little -but they are a great team (and), they came back and beat us." 
Farley"A," always a strong team, Is looking ahead to the remaining schedule. Depth promises to be a factor in Farley's successes. "We have a well-rounded team," Almei<ja remarked. "We have a lot of people who can start." 
The full interhall schedule will be played next week.

No one wanted to win the game more than Tapscou, but he was somewhat pleased after the game as his team played much beuer than many fans exxpected. 
"I have three things to say about the game today: first of all, Notre Dame is a very good team and they know how to execute. Secondly, I also think that we played a good game against such a good team. 
Finally, I was disappointed with the officiating tonight," Tapscott stated. 
"Notre Dame is terrific when they run, and we wanted to stop that," he continued. "We tried to tempo the game because they are such a great running team. We are a guard oriented-dominated team, and that's the strength we tried to focus on tonight." 
On a day when the Irish didn't concentrate and played poorly, it was surprising they could pull off the victory. Notre Dame only shot .700 from the free throw line and

.460 from the floor, both of which 
are far below the team's season 
average. 
Also, for the first time all year the 
Irish were outrebounded, as the 
Eagles grabbed 3 7 misses to 34 for 
Notre Dame. Finally, leading scorer 
David Rivers only managed two field 
goals on 11 attempts and scored 1 0 
points under his average of 18.1. 
One bright spot for the Irish was the play of forward Sean Connor. The 6-7 freshman played nine minutes In the first half and made aU three of his long range attempts to lift the Irish when they were strug­gling. 
"1 wanted to give Sean Connor a look because he's worked very hard In practice and it will give him some confidence,'' Phelps commented. "I talked about It with the other coaches and we think he is ready to step In and make a contribution, as he did tonight In the first half." 
Despite lacking much game ex· perlence, Connor was ready and able to give his team needed outside shooting. 
"I feel pretty good because this Is the first time I've played In quality time during the first half," Connor added. "The other guys did an excel­lent job of setting screens and reversing the ball quickly. 1 had the easy job because I just had to catch the ball and shoot it." 
After defeating UCLA, most Irish fans looked past games with Hofstra and American, and on to North Carolina. Despite this, the Irish played well enough to gain victories In both contests and head Into their game with the Tarheels with a 12-2 record. 
In order to pull off the major up­set, however, Notre Dame will have to play much smarter and con· centrate more than they did against American yesterday.

Irish track starts successfully with middle distance crew posting gains 
ByJOHN COYLE 
Sports Writer 
Everything is right on schedule according to Head Coach joe Piane for the Notre Dame indoor track team. The Irish ran solidly last weekend in their first meet ofthe '86 season, the Michigan Relays, and are looking to do well in Saturday's Wes­tern Michigan Relays, another non­scoring meet. 
Piane is pleased with with the progresssion of many of his runners so early in the season. These two non-scoring meets provide an op­portunity for Piane and the Irish run­ners to experiment a little in preparation for the more com­petitive upcoming meets. 
"We are getting ready for the Mid­western Collegiate Conference Championships here on Feb. 1. Some of the guys are coming along very well. I'm enthusiastic about the season," said Piane. 
The two top finishers for Notre Dame at the Michigan meet, which was comprised of schools from the Big Ten and Mid-American Con­ference, were senior Jim Tyler and junior Robert Nobles. Tyler finished third in the 1000 meter run and Nobles also took third in the 600 meter dash with an excellent time of 
1:1 0.88. Piane was especially happy and also a little surprised by Nobles' performance. 
"Nobles' had a hell of a time. I'm surprised in the respect that I did not expect it so soon, the first meet out. That time would be good anywhere in the country," ex­plained the head coach. 
Notre Dame had four runners qualify for the IC4A Championships. In addition to Tyler and Nobles, sop­homore Tony Ragunas in the 60 meter dash and senior co-captain john McNelis in the 800 meter run both earned a spot in the champion­ships later in the season. 

The other co-captain, senior Joel Autry also performed well in the long and triple jumps as did sop­homore Rick Muench. Piane was also pleased with the run of fresh­man, David Warth in the 1000. 
This weekend the Irish travel to Kalamazoo, Mich., for the Western Michigan Relays. Piane wants to con­centrate on getting his 2-mile relay team of Tyler, McNelis, junior jeff Van Wie and Nobles prepared. 
"Middle distance is the strongest part of our team. We'll be working on getting those four coordinated and ready," said Piane They're train­ing hard to achieve their main ob­jective, to make the National Championships.

A week into her first season as a Notre Dame swimmer, freshman Tracy johnson shattered the women's varsity 50-yard freestyle record to establish herself as the premier Notre Dame sprinter. But the best may be yet to come. 
"She is a very talented swimmer, we are just beginning to learn the extent of her abilities" says Notre Dame swim coach Tim Welsh, "Tracy is a tall girl who is learning to take advantage of her size. As the season progresses, she is getting tougher and tougher in the close races." 
Currently, johnson's forte is the 50-yard freestyle where her time of 
24.98 seconds at Bowling Green on Dec. 12 set a new varsity record. Welsh said he has nothing but praise for his outstanding freshman swim­mer. 
"She is a winner," he says. "Mild mannered about her skills and a great competitor, she likes the chal­lenging positions. From the frrst time I saw her in the pool, I knewshe had a great deal ofpure talent." 
For the future, Welsh said he is looking for johnson to become a better distance swimmer. 
"In the future, hopefully, she will expand her talents, paticularly in the 200-yard freestyle," Welsh says. "Stamina will have something to do with it." 
A problem with that goal, as Welsh explains, is johnson's limited experience in the 200 meter event, which he calls "the most sophist­icated race in swimming." 
"For her to improve, Tracy will have to be given the opportunity to swim the 200-yard freestyle," he ex­plains. "Unfortunately, thus far we have had tough meets and have been forced to go with our strengths so she has not had a shot at the distance race." 
johnson is from Farmington, Mich., and graduated from Mercy High School where she was named all-conference four straight years. 
In her high school career, she was a member of four consecutive un­defeated teams. The lack of im­mediate success experienced thus far this year, however, has not been that frustrating for her. 
"We have trained, and we're prac­ticing very hard," johnson says. "As long as we continue to do our best, success will come our way." 
johnson also said that her teammates have been a great help to her this season. "Having the talented and motivated teammates which we have here at Notre Dame has really pushed me to be a better swimmer," she says. "I'm really pleased to be a member of such a quality. team as this." 

johnson said she already ac­complished one of her goals for the year, but she intends to keep working to become an even better swimmer. 
"At the start of the year, I wanted to break the 50-yard freestyle," she says. "With experience and con­tinued support from Coach Welsh I hope to keep improving my times to lower the team's overall (times). 
"Coach Welsh has placed an equal emphasis on strength, style and technique. He takes time out to work with me, particularly my starts. I can feel a real improvement from this help which is evidenced by my race times dropping. 
"As a team, I hope that we can win the rest of our meets and win the North Star and Midwest champion­ships." 
The men's and women's squads will travel East this weekend to take on St. John's on Friday and Fordham on Saturday. 
"It's possible to win both of these meets," says Welsh. "We must be prepared to race when the gun goes off. St. John's is the faster of the two schools. We'll have (to work) to win it, but that's the way we like it."

Notre Dame runner Robert Nobles, pictured above, ran an im­pressive time of 1:10.88 in the 600 meter run at the Michigan Relays last weekend. Nobles and the other middle distace men are preparing for the two mile relay at the Western Michigan Relays this weekend.

continued/rom page 12 national champion is Notre Dame's oV~m Molly Sullivan who has been fencing for 1 0 years. "Saint Mary's meets them (the Irish) on a regular basis and it's a credit to them," says DeCicco. "They (the Belles) are good fen­cers." So, how does a student get in­terested in a sport like fencing if they've never tried it before? DeCicco thinks it depends on the in­dividual. "We have an open house at the start of the year," he says. "We tell them they don't have to know the sport as long as they want to work hard. And Saint Mary's has been very active over the years. 
"It's not all winning medals. It's a lot offun. It's doing something in the name of your school that you might not otherwise get a chance to do. That's the whole secret." 
DeCiccoo echoes Proost's praise of the job Weeks has done with the novices. 
"We have a great coach in Mike Weeks," he says. "He's doing an out­standing job working with the 13 freshman. I think the interest is to his credit." 
The future looks bright for the 
Saint Mary's program, which appears to be making a name for itself. A high school prospect with two or three years offencingexperience has writ­ten DeCicco expressing interest in attending Saint Mary's. DeCicco, who has been with the Saint Mary's team since its inception as the first women's fencing team in the area, says he will do everything he can to get her here. 
I'd love to have her here and pos­sibly rally the program around her," says DeCicco. "It's a beautiful tie (between the two schools). It would be great to have someone like th. 

here." 
The Belles will only be at the ACC for one meet this season, so if you want to catch a glimpse of Saint Mary's fastest-growing team, which presently consists of six varsity fen­cers, you'll have to wait until February 1. 
The Belles' team record is 1-2 after their semester break trip to the University of North Carolina They will be heading to Chicago this weekend for meets with Wisconsin, Minnesota and Chicago University.

SMC fencing team is now growing bi stature 
What is the fastest-growing varsity spon on the Saint Mary's campus? If you guessed fencing you're probably either on the team or have a good friend who is. 
Many students know the team exists. But most don't know who the team members are, where they practice, when their season is, much less what the spon is all about. 
I, for one, have never. known the first thing about the sport, but the ironic thing is that the great majority of the current fencers never did either until they somehowfound themselves trying out for team. 
Senior captain Mary Beth Proost had never fenced before she came to Saint Mary's and has been with the team every year since, with the exception of her sophomore year abroad. 
"This year, "'CC have more girls in novice than ever before," says Proost. 
According to Proost, the most novices at once in the past were five and usually only a few stuck it out to remain with the team the next year. 
"We recruited 60 names at Activities Night this year and

30 came out," says Proost. The number has since leveled 
offto 13. ­· "They were scared at first, but they're really coming along," she says. "They're doing things I could never do in my (reshman year." 
Proost credits Belles' head coach Mike Weeks for the team's progress. 
"He spends a lot of tim,. with the freshmen," she says. "And he has put a lot ofeffon into helping them along." Proost. "They're the future ofthe-team." 
Another aspect that sets the fencers apan from other Saint Mary's varsity teams is that they train and travel with the Notre Dame men and women's teams. They also fence basically the same schedule, which provides some tough competition for the Belles. 
Notre Dame head coach Mike DeCicco says that Saint Mary's and Notre Dame women formed a joint team in 1974 and won the first Great Lakes Championship in Detroit that year. 
And even though the schools have since formed seperate teams, it's been a continuing success story. 
"It's a unique thing that happens with the Notre Dame­Saint Mary's teams," says DeCicco. "There is a built-in rivalry between the women yet they are very close." 
Since Saint Mary's is an NAIA school, the Belles are often literally fencing out of their league with the Irish in the NCAA, but Proost sees the positive side of the affiliation between the two teams. 
"It's to our advantage that we practice with Notre Dame," says Proost. "We get more experience that way." That is easy to understand when you consider that the
