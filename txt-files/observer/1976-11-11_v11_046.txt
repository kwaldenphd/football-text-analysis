SLC initiates four committees to provide new input in University 
by Karen Hinks Staff Reporter 
The Student Life Council (SLC) recently initiated four standing committees to serve as a base for ad hoc committees, a vehicle for non-council input in the University, explained SLC Chairman Mike Casey. 
The four standing committees include: Campus Life, Planning and Policy, Rules and Regulations, and Off-campus. 
''The general feeling of the council ast year was that we were getting too hung-up with one specific issue," Casey stated. "We were unable to accomplish as many things as we wanted because we spent too much time discussing when we could have been taking action." 
Casey explained that with the addition of the standing commit­tees, more actioon can be taken and as a result, more things will get done. 
The committees are made up of one student, one faculty member, and one administrator from SLC. The remaining members are cross­sections of students from thP 
campus Life Committee 
Campus Life Committee 
Peter Haley, chairman of the Campus Liff Committee described the committee as being concerned with six major areas of interest to student life. 
··An ad hoc committee concern­ing club sports has been organized to seek alternative ways of fund­ing, Haley said. "It is not presently clear whether club sports can receive aid from the University. Under consideration is the possibil­ity that for every dollar indepen­dently raised by the club, the university will match the total." 
Social Spa..:e is viewed as an 
important and effective ad hoc 
committee by SLC. Haley stated 
that the main function of the 
committee is to name and define 
the need for a relaxed situation 
where students and faculty can 
meet. 
"After the purpose has been 
clearly defined, each building will 
be surveyed to decide whether an 
academic room can be established 
where machines can be installed 
and where students and faculty can 
sit naturally between classes," 
Haley said. "The rennovation of 
LaFortune is the result of such a 
committee." 
The Social Space Committee is 
also looking for alternative for 
organized social events in the north 
dining hall and the pay cafeteria. 
"We'd like to see the pay cafeteria as an alternative to the Huddle," commented Haley. "The pay cafe could be used as an area for students to get together to talk and study.'' The Memorial Library has also been under consideration. "Many students have complained that the second floor space has become a gathering place," Haley stated. "The prablem arises when the noise level becomes such that students studying are disrupted." 
The committee is presently seek­ing other areas of the library that can be used as a lounge area. 
Another Campus Life ad hoc committee is Hall Fellows. Haley explained that the committee is a carry over from last year and is designed so that faculty member is assigned to a dorm. The faculty member is invited to social hours, talks, and gatherings. The purpose is to encourage students and faculty to meet on a personal level artd develop better interpersonal relationships. 
The Freedom of Speech ad hoc committee was described by Haley as naving an ambiguous name. ''Baiscially, we are concerned with the underlying hostilities that exist between the students and the administration," he said. "It is a problem that is not clearly defined. We mainly investigate the reasons why students feel this way. We just want to define the problem and then find ways to relieve them." 
The final ad hoc committee is the t:ommittee to delineate responsibil­ities and jurisdiction between stu­dent organizations. 
Haley defined the function of the committee as clearly spelling out the purposes of the Hall Presidents Council, Student Union, Student Government and SLC. 
''There has been a substantial amount of overlapping of responsi­bilities between organizations," he said. "Once the definitions are clear, students will be able to send suggestions throught the proper channels and better implement them." 
Policy and Planning Committee 
Ed Van Tassel, SLC co-chairman 
and chairman of the Policy and 
Planning Committee, emphasized 
to students that the committee wil 
be getting underway after Thanks­
giving break. Important projects of 
the committee are co-ed housing, 
academic honesty, and over­
l"rowding in the Business College. 
"We are also working on the usefullness of grade inflation, mas­sive testing, and the possibility of lay-rectors in the dorms," Van Tassel stated. "We want to inves­tigate the possibility of an alterna­tive to co-ed living such as Notre

Roemer says Campus Security acted adequately last Saturday 
by Gregg B. B1111gs Executive Editor 

Pertaining to the Saturday night riot, Dean of Students James A. Roemer would follow the same procedure exercised by Notre Dame Security, given the informa­tion he knows. 
"Basically, we would do the same thing we did Saturday night. If there was any situation where we could have worked faster, we would improve on it. But I have no facts that state the judgements or deci­sions were taken care of in the wrong manner,'' Roemer stated in an interview held yesterday. 
Roemer said one of the few complaints he's heard regarding the activities of Security that night was that one Security officer did not leave the gatehouse to help control the crowds. "Art Pears (Director of Notre Dame Security) has told me that guard did the correct thing in staying at his post. If he had left, he would have been in deep trouble with Pears," Roemer said. 
"That guard has a large role to play in the gatehouse. He is a vital part in the communicatiouns sys­tem of security, just as the person at the main switchboard is. If he leaves, he is deserting an impor­tant post," he continued. 
Outlines Security Procedure 

Several students voiced com­
plaints that Security would not 
handle their calls regarding being 
attacked until Monday morning. 
Although none of these students 
were seriously injured, they felt 
their reports should have been 
taken immediately. , 
"It's not like I was complaining 
about a parking ticket or some­
thing," one source, who wished to 
remain anonymous, said. "I had 
just finished being attacked by a 
gang and they said to 'call back on 
Sunday.' Then, when I called 
Sunday, they tell me to call back 
Monday. I didn't believe they 
would handle a matter as serious as 
a riot like this," the source continued. 
Roemer thought that "when you run into a riot situation, you have to establish a sense of priorities. First, you should go to the scene of the crime, or riot in this case, and break it up." 
"Second, if anybody is hurt, Security should transport them to health facilities. Third, they should try to initiate, as soon as possible, a written report on the things that took place--particularly on the events (and people) that required medical attention," he said. 
"People calling about being assaulted but not injured is a lesser priority, period," he stated. "The people of Security had twenty pages of single-spaced security reports when I got there. I would imagine they had one heck of a time getting it down. In the case of a person who was assaulted and not injured, their judgement was to wait till the normal staff was in on Monday." 
Security Works In Three Shifts 
Roemer explained that Notre Dame Security works in three shifts. The daytime shift, as well as special events such as football games, is looked over by Arthur Pears, director of security. There is an evening shift, covered from 3 
p.m. to II p.m.) and a morning shift. that is covered from II p.m. to 7 a.m. Each shift has a person in charge who is responsible for making decisions about, among other things. calling in outside sources in the case of fire or the need for police support. 
"For security reasons," Roemer did not disclose how many people work on the security shifts. He would also not relate if any members of the department carried firearms. He did say that "our security carry walkie-talkies and are in constant contact with the main switchboard and the gates." 
Deputy Sheriffs at Wortune . 
Roemer related there were two off-duty St. Joseph County Deputy Sheriffs working at the Black Cultural Arts Center's dance. "If somebody desires to have security at their dances. they can call Arthur Pears and heeither will get off-duty St. Joseph County Deputy Sheriffs or South Bend Police Officers," Roemer said. Roemer stated that both of these types of officers are required to wear fire­arms 24 hours, seven days a week and should function "as if they were on duty.'' 
In lieu of the S8S damage that resulted at the first dance spon­sored by the Black Cultural Arts Center. it was suggested that security guards be hired. 
When trouble broke out at the dance Saturday night, these two deputy sheriffs called security. although they had the option of calling the County Sheriffs office. "At the time, there were no assaults in LaFortune or personal injury, so they called security." Roemer explained. 
He said the reason why everv­body centered around L~Fortu~c was because that was where the initial disturbance started. "Per­haps security should have known the crowd would float south. buth they also went in other directions." 
When the crowd did float south, outside help was called in the form of seven St. Joe Sheriff cars and two Sout~ Bend Police squad cars. 
Although there is no official estimate for the amount of damage done to LaFortune Student Center. Roemer's perosnal estimate runs around SSOO. The Black Cultural Arts Center will pay for that damage. However, they will not pay for the windows broken at the Engineering Building. 
''They hold the responsibility to pay for LaFortune, but not for the Engineering Building because don't think it would be fair to hold them responsible for the damage they caused to other buildings after they left the sole one the sponsor­ing group was responsible for.

Registar sees no relief 




ID cards still bogged c!own 
by Mike Towle Staff Reporter 

The Registrar's Office announced two weeks ago that new student identification cards would be ready for distribution this week. Yet, the cards have not arrived and David Kif, assi-stant registrar, hesitates to guess an arrival date. 
"The new ID cards have been sent off from the printing company, but they haven't arrived as of yet, " Kit stated. "We were informed that it would take ten days to process the cards before they could be sent back. I can't fix a date for their arrival." 
Among the different problems that have arisen are the chemical destruction of photos and the breakdown of cameras during the re-taking of these photos. 
"We didn't anticipate all of these things happening at once, but they have happened. Between the Registrar's Office and the printing company, there are many chances for error," Kit explained. 
The Assistant Regestrar added that he'd rather have the company take its time in processing the ID's

ND insurance salesman explains different policies 
bv Chris Smith Asst.-Managing Editor 

An article appearring in The 
Observer last Tuesday warned that 
"hungry insurance salesmen" are 
scouring campuses all over the 
country. 
Tim Rippingcr, a Notre Dame student who sells insurance for State Mutual Life Assurance Com­pany of America, commented that the article was too general. "There are companies and salesmen who specialize in the college market," he said, "but that doesn't mean that they're bad." 
A Consumer Reports article quoted in Tuesday's Observer arti­cle warned against ~ying deferred payment insurance. Rippinger agreed, explaining that this plan delays payments until the policy­holding student graduates, then hits him with steep payments plus interest on the deferred money. 
"I agree that students do not need a great amount of insurance." added R1ppinger. "However, a small policy is a good idea, if it includes guaranteed insurability." 
Guaranteed insurability, he explained, enables a student to buy a small insurance policy at this time, and convert it to a larger policy later on. "Buying insurance while still in college," Rippinger continued, "entitles the buyer to the low rates given this healthy. low risk age group." 
Accordmg to Rippinger, guaran­teed insurability enables a policy­holder to increase his life insurance at any time, even should his health fail. Without this type of policy, he warns, a company would have the right to refuse additional insurance to someone who became a bad risk, even if he alreadv owned a oolicv. 
"In a good policy," added Rippinger, "the. guaranteed insur­ability option can be exercised by the holder at any time during the lif of the policy." 
Rippinger also explained ·the difference betweeq term insurance and life insurance. "Term insur­ance has a limited policy life and is cheaper," he commented. With this type of insurance. the buyer 
gets back nont: of the money he nas paid in premiums. Life insurance, however, always returns money to the holder, but is more expensive. 
"If you are approached by an agent," warned Rippinger, "always ch-:!ck out his company with the state insurance commis­sion, the Better Business Bureau. or a magazine similar to Consumer Reports."

Meany open to talks with Carter 
b)' Robert A. Dobkin AP Labor Writer 

WASHINGTON AP -AFL CIO President George Meany says labor leaders are willing to discuss voluntary wage-price guidelines if proposed by President-elect Jimmy Carter. but Meany reamins ada­mantly opposed to mandatory con­trols. 
''I'm quite sure when the time comes we'll be ready to talk to him about it." Meany said, referring to voluntarv restraints. 
At a news conference Wednes­day. the 82-year-old labor chief jokingly said he expects to play the role of "elder statesman" in the new administration. 
Meany also said that when he has problems affecting workers. he expects "to have that problem considered by Gov. Carter when he becomes President." He added ·'that is the only commitment Carter has made to me -that any problems we have he will give them immediate consideration."

South Bend man acquitted of one of two murders 
ST. .JOSEPH. Mich. AP -A South Bend. Ind.. man charged with murder won a major legal victory Wednesdav when a Berrien District Court judge ruled that the state had insufficient evidence to prove a murder had been committed. 
Gerald Libertowski. 34. is charged with murdering Janis K. Sanders. 24. of Niles -although no body has been found. 
Libertowski was acquitted in South Bend in August of killing another woman -whose body also 
\ was never found. Judge Ronald .J. Taylor, in a hearing to determine whether suf­ficient evidence exists to bring Libertowski to trial. ruled that the prosecution failed to prove that Mrs. Sanders was dead or that she met her death by foul play. Dcpuly Prosecutor Jeffrey Long said he would appeal the decision to the Circuit Court. 
The prosecution said Mrs. San­ders' wallet was allegedly found under Libertowski's South Bend home. Libertowski admits that Mrs. Sanders lived with him. but says they broke up before her disappearance. 
The prosecution also presented witnesses that said they were·seen together in Niles 'before Mrs. Sanders disappeared in 1975.

Meany said Dole cost Ford votes because the Kansan came across like "a brand new Dick Nixon." 
The new administration's first order of business. Meany said, should be to provide jobs and turn the economy around. A tax cut may be a needed stimulus, he said. However. e4conomic statistics issued last week raised the possi­bility that inflation may be more of a problem than Carter thought, forcing him to resort to special anti­infaltion measures such as wage and price restraints. 
Carter said during his campaign he would like to have standby authority to impose wage and price contrls. if needed. but he didn't think they would ever be used. Some of his advisers and congres­sional Deomcrats have speculated the President-elect mav seek to establish voluntary guidelines for wages and prices. _

U.S. agribusinesses battle with Third World peasants over land· 
by Partida F1ynn Paclfic News Service 

Fmm Guatemala to Mexico to the Philippines, U.S. agribusiness giants are c11ught in a simmering war with the hndless peasants of the Third Worlci. At s ...ke is a large part of their $30 billion in overseas investments. 
Over the last l.J years firms like United Branc'~ formerly United Fruit, Castle & Cooke, which bought Standard Fruit aud Dole, and Del Monte, have tripled their investment in the rich lands of the underdeveloped world. 
But in the process, they have driven thousands of peasants off theri land. sparking repeated waves of resistance. 
And judging from disclosures made at a recent Del Monte annual meeting, followed up by a detailed 
sutdy  from  the  North  American  
Congress  on  Latin  America  
(NACLA),  the  tactics  used  by  

American corporations to meet this resistance have included intimida­tion, political play-offs and a var­iety of subtle methods to skirt the law. 
Del Monte, which came under attack for such practices from dissident stockholders, church and public interest groups at its Sept­ember meeting, is the world's largest canner of fruits and vegeta­bles. Though it refused to reveal the esze of its vast plantation system in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, its annual sales of more than $1.2 billion indicate its mam-1'-vi:I nature. 
One of the most recem contro­versies surrounding Del Monte has come in the Philippine region of Minanao, where Del Monte. United Brands, and Castle & Cooke, lured largely by the Japanese banana market, are all expanding their operations. 
The result, in an area where land was already in high demand, ahs been a bitter confrontation with the local peasantry. 
According to CatholiC priests on the scene, Del Monte agents have threatened small landholders that unless they lease their land it will be encircled by Del ~!onte and all access will be ~cut off. 
The priests also report that local officials have facilitated the land­grab by refusing to process dispu­ted land titles unless the owners agree to lease to the company. Many who have resisted the pres­sure have seen their lands fenced , in and cattle driven onto their fields by Del Monte employes and armed guards. 
"They bulldozed people right off the l:lnd," said Father Ed Gerlock, who was arrested for helping pleasants resist. "Now they're using aerial sprays, harming famr animals and giving people terrible rashes." 
The luckier of those forces to lease are now working as hired labor for Del Monte on their own lands. Others remain unemployed, trying to subsist on the rent they receive from the company. 
Most of Del MOnte's plantations in the Philippines are public lands leased from a government corpora­tion. For decades, Philippine na­tionalists have complained that the agreement violates the Philippine constitution, which prohibits for­
eign control of plublic lands in 
excess of 2,253 acres. 
The nationalists aLnost achieved 
their goal in 1972, when the 
Philippine Supreme Court handes 
down a ru~ing that would hvae 
limited U.A. land ownership. But 
almost immediately President 
Ferdinand Marcos declared martial 
law and quickly rescinded the 
decision. 
Del Monte has always been on friendly terms with Marcos, host­ing him several times at its plantation mansions. 
A similar conflict has erupted in northern Mexico, where more than 100 peasants have been killed over the past year seizing adn defending land they claim is rightfully theirs. 
Their targets have been large landowners, many of them Ameri­can, who have circumvented Mex­ico's 247 acre ownership limit by becoming partners or contracting with local farmers. Many of the locals, in turn, distribute their deeds, each for 247 acres or less. among their relatives. 
Del Monte and a handful of other 
U.S. corporations, including Car­nation and Campbells have virtual­ly reshaped the Bajio Valley, one of the country's most fertile regions. Through its contracts with local farmers, which it gets by offering attractive credit and technical c.id, Del Monte is able to dictate which crops will be produced, on how many acres and at what price. 
While Mexico uses scarce for­eign exchange to irrport corn, the main staple of the Mexican diet, thousands of fertile acres prud.Ice an American "luxury" variety of corn for Del Monte. 
Researchers fromUCLA who have visited the Bajio also reprot that most of the farm workers in the fields contracted to Del Monte are paid about $3 a day, 25% below the Mexican legal minimum. But be­cause the corporation does not directly hire the field hands, it is not technically violating Mexican law. 
As in the Philippines, many these same laborers were originally · peasants, driven off their lands by the pressures of corporate agricul­
ture. 
The most fanous battle between 
American agribusiness and Third 
World nationalists, however, was 
the Central American banana 
scandal, which eventually led to the 
suicide of United Brands President 
Eli Black. 
In 1973 the banana companies 
were fighting the formation of a 
cartel of banana-exporting coun­
tries and the impostition of a 
$1-per-bix tax ib banana exports. 
Publicly they threatened to cut 
production and tried to convince 
some countries to pull out of the 
cartel. 
But privately, United Brands 
paid Honduran President Lopex 
Arellano a bribe of $1.25 million. 
When it was discovered, Arellano 
lost his job and Black jumped from 
the window of his Manhattan 
office. 
Meanwhile, demands for agrar­
ian reform. aimed principally at 
foreign companies like United 
Brands and Standard Fruit. had 
accelerated into massive land inva­
sions, armed conflicts between 
growers and peasants and wide­
spread arrests by the government. 
But the pressure from U.S. 
agribusiness proved at least partly 
effective. Only Pnama went 
through with the full $1 tax, though 
Guatemala imposed a 44-cent-per­
box tax after a bitter debate in 
Congress. 
Del Monte had its own ''banana­
gate" in Guatemala in 1972, when 
the company attempted to buy 
United Brands' banana plantations Jhere. 
The Guatemalan government re­
fused plermission fo.-the $20 
million purchase for more than a 
year because of legal limitations on 
foreign land acquisition, then sud­
denly reversed its decision. 
Under pressure from the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commis­
sion (SEC), Del Monte was forced 
Teacher slain in class 
. DETROIT AP -Seven year old Laura Denomie and 35 other child­ren just started their English lesson in Betty McCaster's first grade class. A man entered, exchanged a few words with the teacher, then shot the teacher. 
"Miss McCaster w scream­ing," Lasura recalled later. "She reached her-hand out and tried to push the gun away but bullets hit her and she fell against the table." 
Miss McCaster,46, was fatally shot in the head Wednesday in her classroom at Burt Elementary School on Detroit's northwest side. 
"We were screaming, and we all ran out of the roiom," 'Laura told polic. "He shot her three or four times from this far," she-said, indicating a distance of about five feet. 
Hours later, police arrested Miss 
McCaster's estranged hus­
band, 
Most classes were cancelled tor the rest of the day at the school where Miss McCaster had trans­fered only,three weeks ago because police said she was afraid of Lewis. 
Her sobbing pupils fled the scene and clustered in a first tllor classroom. Their parents waited anxiously in the corridor while police tried to piece together the youngsters' confused stories of what happened. 
Police and school officials said a man had come to the school, inquired .vhere Miss McCaster's classroom was, and entered it just as s;1e \,egan an English lesson. 
Pupils said the two exchanged a few words before the man pulled a gun. When Miss McCaster's told one child to go to the principal's office for help, the children said, the gunman became infuriated. 
The Detroit Free Press reported in today's editions that Lewis had for the past two months been trying to get public school officials to fire his ex-wife. Lewis called the newspaper several times, claiming he could prove Miss McCaster had stolen school equipment. 
The newspaper said Lewis called a reporter Monday and said he had signed himself into Doctors Hospi­tal and expected to be there three weeks. A hospital spokesman refused to say what kind of treatment Lewis had. He signed himself out Tuesday nig:ht. 
School principal Wllbut Klein said ·Miss McCaster's husband, whom, he knew slightly, had come to the school a few days ago and demanded to see his wife. The principal said he told Miss McCas­ter, but she refused to see Lewis.

Restaurant hires waitress 
NEW YORK AP-The posh "21" Club. known as one of those restaurants where everyone who's anyone is sure to turn up. has hired its first waitress and coined the term "waitperson" to cover all its serving staff. 
Jeanne King, 30, a college gr_aduate and professional wait­ress. has started work as a part-time apprentice and will begin waiting on tables by herslef in two weeks. 
Miss King was hired as a result of an out-of-court settlement by by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Miss King and Cathryn Smith, also a professional waitress. The restaurants named in the suit were all alleged to have rejected employing the two only because they are women. 
The suit is still pending against such restaurants as Lutece. La Cote Basque and the Four Seasons. 
The "21" Club agreed in the settlement not only to hire Miss King, but to pay her an undisclosed fee and to pay to ACLU for legal fees. 
Terry Dinan, a member ot the "21 "management team said the practice of hiring only male servers was a longstanding tradition among New York's restaurants. 
··n s hard to he the first to break 
a'traditionk" Dinan said ina inter­
view today. "It takes a hig person. 
Well. we're a big restaurant. and 
we've broken that old trad1tion. 
Dinan said all "saipersons" will wear the same uniform worn in the past by male waiters--dark skaks and while jacket at lunch and a red Jacket with bow tie for dinner.

Capital punishment is reinstated across world 
PARIS, Nov. 8 --In the early dawn of a midsummer morning, a steel guillotine blade ended the life of 21-year old convicted murderer Christian Manucci --the first criminal executed in France in more than two years. 
As the U.S. prepares for its own first execution since 1967, the July 28 beheading of Manucci may signal a similar new spate of guillotinings in France. 
And in Great Britain, West Germany. Switzerland and Italy, sharpening debate over the death penalty indicates a P<JSsible resur­rection of capital punbhment as an attempted criminal deterrent. 
Spain is the only West European country besides France now im­plementing the peacetime death sentence, though in Spain it is reserved for case~ of political terrorism of military misconduct-­not common crome. 
·Five Spanish revol u tionarit>s were executed in September 1ens. for example, for the assassination of policemen during the waning days of the Franco regime. 
Manucci's execution was the first in France under President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, indicat­ing that Giscard now intends to follow his predecessors. Gen. Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou, in priserving capital punishment. 
Giscard had professed his ·"pro­found aversion" to the death sentence as a presidential candid­ate in 1974. And on two occasions since he had signed reprieves 
SMC graduates participate in Alumnae Career Week forum 
hJ Donna Berndt Staff Reporter 

In conjunction with Alumnae Career \\eek. St. Mary's senior class sponsored a Forurn on Car­eers with SMC alumnae last night.· The three graduates discussed their place in society today and various aspects of a career. 
Sarah Earley, '71 explained her movement from a B.A. at St. Mary's to a sales representative for Xerox Corporation. She stated that she did not immediately move towards a career and spent the intervening time working as a secretary and obtaining her 
M.B.A .. 
Earley's intent was to explain interviewing techniquest to the 
Hall decoration contest to be held for this weekend 
There will ba a hall decoration contest as a part of Homecoming '76. The theme is "Around the World in 80 Days" and the judges will be members of the University staff faculty and students. 
A first prize of $100 will be awarded to the hall which best represents the theme and $75 will be awardi:d to the second place hall. 
Judging will take place from 3 
p.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday Nov. 19 and prizes will be awarded at the Homecoming dance. The hall pres­idents will be notified on Friday afternoon and invited to the dance. 
The Cheerleaders, Student Union, and Social Commission are also sponsoring a poster contest. The posters are, to be in keepin~ with the homecoming theme .and the first place prize is $30. 
The posters cannot be obstruc­tive to hall decor or "uncouth" and judging will take place at the same time as hall decorations judging.

commuting death sentences into life imprisonment. But the French president solemnly announced that an example had to Je set in Manucci's case, especially since it involved the murder of a young girl. 
Recent polls in France show that S8o/o of voters favor capital punish­ment and that a retreat from the death penalty could cost Giscard up to one million votes in the next election. 
Following is a look at four other West European countries where the captial punishment issue is stirring heated debate: 
In Britain, the pro-capital pun­ishment movement has gained momentum with the spread of Northern Ireland-related violence -­pub explosions and letter bombs -­to England, Scotland, and Wales. 
Lobbyists are calling for the death sentence to deal with IRA members blamed for such acts, and recent polls indicate that 88o/o of the British agree. There is also strong support for dealing harshly with the killers of policemen, though less so for common killers. 
The death sentence was abolish­ed in Britain in 1965 except for certain wartime crimes. 
In West Germany, which abol­ished the death penalty in 1949, support is growing within the law-and-order Christian Democrat­ic party to revive capital punish­ment as a deterrent to political terrorists like the Baader-Meinhof group and the Palestinians who attacked the Olympic Village in 1972. 
In Switzerland, where capital punishment was abolished in 1942, except for wartime crimes of trea­son, mutiny and surrender, a May 1976 poll showed that more than half the population advocated the death penalty for crimes ranging from murder to drug dealing. 
In Italy, as in West Germany, rising crime rates and acts of violence are spurring calls within the ruling Christian Democratic party to reestablish the death penalty. I Most West European countries eliminated capital punishment decades ago. 
The Duchy of Liechtenstein was one of the first to drop the penalty in 1798. San Maring followed suit in 1848; Belgium in 1863; Holland in 1870; Norway in 1905; Sweden in 1921; Denmark and Iceland in 1930 and Finland in 1949. 
The Vatican scratched capital punishment from Its books in 1969. Until then, attempts on the Pope's life. massacres and a few other crimes called for execution. 
In Eastern Europe. Poland is the only nation actually to have an­nounced, in 1956, the end of the death penalty. 
A govermnent sounct> in Hun­gary said hi!> country no longer applies the death penalty for murder of economic crimes. But in the Soviet Union, East Germany, and Yugoslavia, the death penalty is apparently used regularly. 
According to Amnesty Interna-· tiona!. about 30 persons are con­demned to death every year in the Soviet Union for acts ranging from

Mary Lou Gorno, '72. is present­ly working on her M.B.A. at the University of Chicago. She has taught secondary school and acquired her M.A. in journalism. 
SHe was conce-rned with the opportunities available to women' in the business world. Gorno ex­plained that an arts and letters degree is highly respected in the l11rgc:r corporations, as companies :·e more concerned with person­.tlity and talent. She further ex­plained that most major corpora­tions have intensive training pro­grams to prepare the employee for their position. 
Rose Dilenshneider, a 1954 grad­uatc and now a mother of ten explained her movement from les· son plans and grade keeping to 

· secretarial work and finally to her present role a~ a volunteer worker!> and mother.

She further explained the value of a liberal arh degree, not only as a preparation fm a career. but a~ an outlook on life .. Dilcn~hncider felt that such a degree made one a fuller person a-; well a., expanded one's interest!>.

robbery to World War II crimes, though there is no information suggesting execution for political crimes. 
Western reports indicate there have been at least 200 executions in East Germany since its founding in 1949. In Yugoslavia, three Croatian terrorists were executed in 1973 for killing a policeman. 
Press Raises Sentiment 

The French debate has taken on new impetus with the mid-October arrest of 28-year-old Joel Matcncio, the accused kidnapper and mur­derer of at least two persons in Grenoble. 
Supposedly connected with a radical political group called the "Rde Brigade 666." Matcneio. who evaded poli ~ detection for almost four month had been labelled by most of the French media eve~ before being t·harged as the ''ruthless killer" of several young people. 
The press 1campaign which virtually condemned the suspect to the guillotine as he rode to t·ustody in a police van, has helped sway the public into taking a much harder line on the death penalty. 
Now, large numbers on intellect­uals. politicians. editorialists and 
need resumes in a hurry?

New medical problems stems out of fetus living in body of dead women 
by C.C. Miniclier Associated Press Writer 

DENVER AP -Doctors face legal, ethical. and moral questions in tr~·ing to save the life of the unborn child of Linda Irene Culbertson. Machines are keeping the 29-year­old woman's body functioning, but her brain is dead. 
A spokesman for the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecol­ogy in Chicago told Colorado General Hospital officials yester­day that the college has no record of such a case. 
Mrs. Culbertson suffered head. neck and internal injuries in an automobile crash on Monday. Des­pite the lack of brain activity, her body has been connected to respir­ators and other machines sim.>e then because of a IS-week fetus 
ND alumnus appointed NOAA director 
Notre Dame alumnus Cdr. John 
W. Carpenter was appointed col)lmanding officer of the Whiting. the Commerce Depart­ment"~ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced last week. 
Carpenter, who received a B.S. degree in engineering science from Notre Dame in 1960, will command 



Cdr. John W. Carpenter the ltd-foot. 760-ton hydrographic sunev vessel. The $1.8 million ship_-which conducts nautical charting surveys in coastal waters, is based in Norfolk. Va.. and carries a normal complement of 36 ofticcrs and crew. An officer of the NOAA Corps. Cdr. Carpenter served on the Whiting in 1970-71 as Executive Officer. He has seen service aboard the Pierce and the Surveyor, has been chief of three geodetic field parties and was the ·~···. r ·''"''"'i"<:innrr1 nffit·er to <;erve 
doctors discovered after the acci­
dent. 

In expanding the doctor's dilem­ma, hospital spokesman Ted Wrenn said: 
"You have a heart beating inside another body that for all intents and purposes is dead. What do you do? It raises a whole series of problems." 
Doctors say the fetus cannot be removed from Mrs. Clubertson's body until it becomes viable at 20 weeks of gestation, and weighs at least 500 grams, or a little over one pound. 
"We don't know if the body can support the growth of the fetus," said Dr. Janes Ogsbury, chief resident of the surgical intensive carr. unit at CGH. 
·'A whole host of folks are studying the medical, legal and ethical questions" 
Ogsbury said it would be a day-to-day decision whether life support is maintained. 
Doctors say that the lack of brain activity prccludess Mrs. Culbert­son's survival if the life support machinery were removed. 
Ogsbu~y said the case is not related to that of Karen Ann Quinlan of New Jersey. whose parents won a court battle to have their comatose daughter removed from life-support machinery. Rath­er, he said, it is related to the question of abortion, which the 
U.S. Supreme Court has ruled is a decision to be reached between a woman and her doctor. 
Mrs. Culbertson's husband, Vaughn, a pharmacist, has refused to discuss the question, but a 
member of the family said, "We have hot made any decision yet. It is a very traumatic moment for us." 
The couple's child, Shannon who is 6 months old, suffered a fractur­ed skull in the auto accident with her mother and is reported in good condition. 
Colorado law does not define when a person is legally dead. When doctors determined that ~ Mrs. Culbertson's brain had died, they acquired legal documents permitting her to be an organ donor, but organ transplant plans were cancelled when the fetus' heartb~:at was detected. 
Artist hits gold mine by painting hot dog pictures 
CHICAGO AP--Gustav Korn, who 
studied painting in his native 
Budapest, Hungary, and dreamed 
of perhaps becoming a great artist, 
now has hundreds of his paintings 
displayed--an hot dogs. 

Korn, 62. came to this country 20 years ago and went to work for a sausage company, curing corned beef. In his spare time he painted landscapes. 
Two years ago one of his bosses noticed Korn 's painting at an art show. 
''And the next day I had a new job with the company, a sign painter," said Korn. "I paint hotdogs with and without mustard; Jr with relish and mustard, or with Jnions, relish and mustard, most often in a bun. 

'But sometimes I paint just the naked weiner or sausage; The colors can be just as exciting as those in a landscape." 
He says no two hotdogs are ali~e. 

There are variations in their curve, shape and color. "Each one is a new challenge. I have as much fun painting hot dogs as I do painting landscapes," he said. 
Korn said his weekly production 
may be as many as a dozen signs, 2 
bv 3 feet in size. 

-"It's not a job I can rush or be 
pushed in. For instance, Polish 
sausages·e 20 inches long and are

The signs are distnbuted by the company in a seven-;,tate area for use at hot dog stands, restaurants and delicatessens.

"Carter to the very end was not all that specific on the issues," the Arizona Democrat said. 
"I suspect that by the middle of next year there are going to be some loud yells and some com­plaints." 
The consumer groups believe he is on their side and many bu'iiness people supported him because they believed he would back their side, Udall said. 
"One or the other of these groups may be disappointe--1 as he has to define himself by making up budgets and by making tough decisions and you're going to see a reaction in the Congress," Udall said. 
There will be trouble if, for instance, Carter recommends con­
~~nc~i;~:~~s B·l·a~~~~;r :~opifpi~ge

from now, Udall said.

a strong disposition to work with him, a disposition to give him the benefit of the doubt, a disposition to help him out wherever we can and make his presidency a suc­cess."' 
Udall said he believed initial reports that Carter would have trouble with Congress were over­blown. Whatever, fault there was, he said, was because of inexperi­ence and an Atlanta-based cam­paign which took pride in not heine: 
In Washington. . But he said Carter will need 
people who know about. C?ngress 
and the influence of special mterest 
groups if he is to avoid big 
mistakes.

WASHINGTON AP-Rep. Morris Udall says Jimmy Carter could get 
off to a quick start in the presidency by pushing for passage of some of the bills that were never enacted or fell victim to President Ford's 
vetoes. 

"If I were he," Udall said, "I would take the half-dozen most outrageous Ford vetoes of bills that have been debated and finely 
toned and say let's do these in February and March. Pick some­thing that has been pawed over and is finely tuned and is ready to roll and put it on the road and move it. 
"People like a winner and people like a mover and shaker and this more than anything else would put him in charge in Washington if he can find a quick agenda for that 
tOO days." Udall said in an interview.
Udall, who was runner-up to Carter in the race for the Democra­tic nomination, said Carter's rela­
tionship with Congress is not yet clear.

Keenan and OC victorious in IH plaY
by BemJe O'Brien Sports Writer 

The field of contenders for the 1976 Interhall Football crown was narrowed to three last night on Cartier Field as the teams from Keenan Hall and Off -Campus scored victories over Zahm and Morrissey Halls respectively. With their win over Zahm, Ke :nan now advances to the North Quad championship game against Grace on Sunday, with the winner of that contest meeting Off Campus for the .::ampus title next Thursday even­ing. 
In the first game last night, Keenan relied on a sound running attack and an impressive defensive showing to trounce their neighbors from Zahm 23-0. In the first quarter, Kee,an wasted little time getting on the board grinding out 65 yards in 12 plays. Mark Mulli­gan capped the drive with a two-yard plunge. Ed Daink.J added the extra ooint kick to put Keenan ahead 7-0. 
Oniy moments later, after foro:· ing Zahm to turn over the ball, Keenan started again from their own 46 yard line. Following a brilliant 38 yard jaunt by Fran~. Hopke down to the Zahm 4 yard line, Keenan scoted again a~ Hopke crashed in from 3 yards out. With the PAT by Dainko, tht· Keenanites led 14-0 without throw­ing a single pass. 
For the remainder of the first half. Zahm managed on only one occassion to find an opening in the otherwise impregnable Keenan defense. The big play came mid­way throught the second quarter when quarterback Jack Kearney found Steve Cicciarelli open for a 35-yard gain, setting up Zahm with an ideal scoring opportunity at the Keenan 4-yard line. 
But the Keenan defense failed ttt bend any further, rising up to stop Zahm tor no gaih on their next rwo

Keenan continued to dominate play in the second half of the contest, recovering a fumble on the Zahm 30-yard line late in the third quarter to set up a 10-yard field goal by Dainko. Leading 17-0 late in the fourth quarter, Keenan tallied its final points. The score 
came when second stringer Nick Molinaro rushed for 75 yards in two plays to ice it 23-0 . 
The second game of the evening proved to be much more clo~L'I~ contested, with Off-Campus riding the arm of basketball walk-on Bil Sahm to score a come from behind sudden-death victory over Morris­sey Hall. 
In the first half of play, neither team was able to sustain an appreciable drive, with both defen­sive units closing up the ground passages as well as the airwavs quite effectivdy. What the first halflackedin excitement, however, the second half made up for tenfold. 
Morrissey was first to attack, recovering an Off-Campus fumble on the latter's 35-yad line. Six plays later. quarterback Jack Mc­Carthy ..,cored from four yards out to put Morrissey on top ll-0. In-what would p~ove to be a fatal mistake, Morrissey faked the l kk for the PAT and went for the two-point conversion anti failed. 
Only two plays into the final stanza, Off-Campus was provided with their scoring opportunity of the game by recovering a fumble on the Morrissey 36-yard line.

Bob Golic follows Irish traditio'J 
by Tony Pace Sports Writer 

Since the davs of Sam Huff. the position of middle linebacker has been the most glamorous on the defensive side of tlhe line. The man who has the distinction of playing this spot for the record-setting Notre Dame defense is Bob Golic. 
The Notre Dame defense i~ struCtured to allow Golic to play 
either  the  traditional  linebacker  
spot  or  drop  into  a  three-point  
stance as nose guard.  What does  

he think of the dual role he must play'! Golic says, "I like the position I'm in now because it gives me the variance of being either a down lineman or a linebacker. But, I think I like playing linebacker better because it gives me a lot more freedom." 
Though the Willowick, Ohio native is not trying to model himself after any particular player, he is not unaware of the rich tradition at the middle linebacker position. "I always liked to watch the linebackers, like Dick Butkus and Mike Curtis. Butkus ws big and fast, and he was great. Curtis, he was almost a nui." 
Golick states. however, that one need not be crazy to play his

Considering the fact that Golic is only a sophomore. it seems a~ though he would have a definitt· chance to be named as an All­American before he graduates. He r:omments. "All through my life I have set rather high goals for myself. In high school I tried to be All-State by my senior year and I succeeded. 
"I have always realized that setting high goals makes you \Htrk harder to achieve then·.. I have thought about All-Am.:rican. it is something I can work for and it makes me better for trying. Whether I make it or not remains to be seen, but I will work harder to achieve it.·: 
Has Golic set any other goals for himself? Yes, he would like to play professional football. His father played for seven years in Canada. so this is something of a family affair. As Bob says, "I've always wanted to play pro. It appeals to me that I can do something I love and get paid for it." With his 6-3, 240 pound frame, the pros will be more than happy to have him.

Many criteria determine bowl bids 

game is key for both teams involved. 
"We've always liked Notre Dame," acknowledged Executive Director Wilbur Evans. "Notre Dame is the number one team in the country as far as following is concerned. They have a charisma that no other school has.'' 
Charisma or not, the Irish record still stands at 6-2. Unless Notre Dame comes through with a victory this Saturday, the closest they will get to the Cotton Bowl is by watching the game on television. 
The chance that Notre Dame will receive an invitation to a major bowl may seem dismal now, after last week's loss to Georgia Tech, however, bids are not announced until Nov. 20. The Irish still have a chance to redeem themselves, while at the same time praying for other college favorites to be 
knocked off this weekend. 

Another bowl that may not have the reputation of tht"big three, 'tiut has been gaining in popularity over the last few years, is the Gator Bowl. 
The Gator Bowl will also be looking at the petformance of the Irish. It seems unlikely that Notre Tom Clements guided the Irish gridders into two consecuttve bowl Dame would accept an invitation to appearances against Alabama in 1973 and 1974.

school drawing power.  
"We  have  a  meeting  every  

Monday morning and evaluate what happened over the weekend in college football," stated Gil Sloan, Information Director for the Orange Bowl. 
"After our evaluation, we issue a most wanted poster. Our current most wanted teams are Maryland, Pittsburgh, Michigan, Ohio State, USC and UCLA." 
The Orange Bowl has a four year contract with the winner of the Big Eight conference. The agreement cxpir.:s in 1979 and is subject to renewal. The other participant is open to any school. 
··Notre Dame has been on our list for half of the season,'' Sloan added. "Just because they're not on it this week, doesn't mean the~ won't be listed next week." · 
Whoever does receive the open invitation, which at this point looks like Pittsburgh ·Nill receive close to one million dollar". for their partici· pation. 
The Sugar BoJwl committee fol­lows a similar procedure. The members have visitation commit­tees which are sent out each week to certain "key" games. Most of the visitation committees are com­posed of executive board members. 
The various committees are as­signed to certain areas of the country. The visitation committees relay what they have observed to the executive board. Mike Smith, a "'otre Dame alumnus, covers the Irish battles and reports his findings to the executive com­mittee. 
When the bowl invitations must 
be announced, the executive com­
mittee reviews their briefings and 
votes on a team. 

"We're still looking at Notre Dame," remarked Executive Di­rector Captain Joseph T. Katz. "We love Notre Dame and they have a great followin~. They have drawing power; we never count them out until the very end." 
Even though t l1e Irish have a great following, their performance last week leaves their chance for a bid on edge. Katz did mention that Notre Dame's batt!~ with the Crimson Tide this Saturday is very important. 
A good showing against Ala­bama, plus a lot of upsets in college football, plus a little Irish luck and Notre Dame may have a chance for a bid. Even though Notre Dame may have more fans than most schools in the country, if their record is below par, an invite seems out of the question. 
The Sugar Bowl committee is also watching Pittsburgh, Mary­land, Ohio State, Michigan, USC, UCLA and the Big Eight runnerup. With such highly regarded compe­tition, the Irish chances for a bid grow even slimmer. 
The Sugar Bowl committee will not be the only ones represented in South Bend this Saturday. The Cotton Bowl committee will also be present for the 'Barna clash.·

After the events of last year and the past week, this fact seems t0 be ignored. It's natural at a school where football is emphasized so heavily to tall into this trap. but a new perspective is needed.

So. this past week,as I'veseen the Notre Dame football program treated .s if this was a professional organization, I can't help but think back to a loothall game I saw over October break. It was Division Ill tootball, a far ~TV from what will be seen on the field at Notre Dame stadiun·. thi!> ·,aturday. The game pitted Hofstra and Fordham, a monumental clash roctween two titans of EasTerr.t college football. What I saw only made me hink: 
Hofstra was one of the first schools in the country to install an Astroturf ourface in their stadium in the late 60's. Their stadium seats 10,000 and is 1sed by many high schools on Long Island. Unfortunately, they no longer :se the stadium for their home games. It seems that complaints mounted 
bout the rising number of injuries. So, while a 10,000 seat stadium -.;tands empty. Hofstra plays their home games on a grass field hidden in 'Ie back of the classroom buildings. 
The field itself looked as ifthe U.S. Air Force (which previously owned :IC land and still owns the adjacent area) had done some recent test ombing. The area was not meant for football and Hofstra had done their :st to try and convert it. 
There were bleachers seating about 3,000 on the Hofstra sideline, while . :te visitors' side had only one bl~acher seating maybe 300. The rest\\ t:re Jared. A person with great wisdom placed the scoreboard on the face of . building which lies in the path of the sun's rays, making it impossible for

When Notre Dame players take the field, an elaborate tunnel is formed ving the feeling of warriors preparing for the contest. When Hofstra 'ayers take the field, they have to dodge program hawkers, ticket takers, 
d kids with Cokes or, in some cases, beers in hand. As the game starts, the first mention is made of the Hofstra Marching 1zoo Band seated in Section 29. A halftime show at a Hofstra game 1tures a group of Professor Irwin Corey lookalikes marching on the field a melodic rendition of the Notre Dame Fight Song. The group also likes lend a vocal tnuch to the atmosphere. After a holding penalty against e Flying Dutchmen, the leader rose and led the group in a rousing cheer . "Castrate the ref!"
