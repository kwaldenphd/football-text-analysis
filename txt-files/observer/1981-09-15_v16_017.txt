Government continues car tests 
The government said yesterday, it will continue auto crash tests, but no longer will assign pass or fail grades to particular models and will reasssess whether a single test is enough to make an accurate judgement. Raymond Peck, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the old practice of giving cars a pass or fail grade may have misled the public at times and bee~ unfair to manufacturers. But he said the agency will continue the tests and will release numerical results, leaving it to the public to judge a car's crash worthiness. Peck said in an interview that labeling a car as having passed or failed the tests--a practice strongly criticized by the auto industry-­may exaggerate the danger of some autos while conveying "a false sense of security" about others. The crash rating began two years ago and became a central part of the agency's consumer information program under former President Carter's NHTSA admisistrator, Joan Claybrook. AP 
Entrants' fees go to hospital 
Entrants in a $1 million fish 1erby misunderstood if they thought all their entry fees would go to Children's Orthopedic Hospital, say hospital and derby officials. Schuck's Auto Supply, the sponsor, was to give the hospital just over $10,000 yesterday but of $124,000 the derby raised, said spokesman Dan McConnell, Sczhuck's planned all along to deduct expenses. "It was not made clear, " said Beverly Lambert, president of the hospital board of trustees. "Maybe when people thought they bought their entry fee that the whole $10 would go to us.'' Entrants each paid $10 to try to win $1 million on Sept.6 by catching a tagged salmon. No one caught the fish, but Schuck's will pay $10,000 to anyone who nabs it by Nov. 1; other donors added another $3,000. AP

While not mentioning the letter, the official Soviet news agency Tass accused "extremist leaders" in Solidarity of stepping up efforts to overthrow the socialist system. The attack was the latest in a torrent of sharp criticism · unleashed by the union's first congress. 
In a dispatch from Warsaw, Tass said Solidarity leaders "strive to heighten the atmosphere of an anti-socialist and anti-Soviet psychosis...to further pursue their attack on socialism with a view to taking over power in Poland. AP 
God violates U.S. Constitution 
Madalyn Murray O'Hair told a federal appeals court yesterday the Texas Constitution's requirement that public officers recognize God violates the U.S. Constitution. Mrs. O'Hair and her atheist group, the Society of Separationists1 were challenging a Texas frovision as a violation of the constitutional separation o church and state. A similar provision in Maryland was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1961, Mrs. O'Hair told the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Susan Bradshaw, of the state attorney general's office, said the suit was pointless because the 105-year-old constitutional section is not used. AP

Third encyclical 

Pope supports wrorker's rights 
VATICAN CITY (AP) -Pope john Paul II has wrinen the third en­cyclical otis papacy, a major docu­ment summarizing his views on the rights of workers and their position in modem society. 
The encyclical, a lener addressed by the pope to patriarchs, archbis­hops and other church leaders, will be released by the Vatican today. 
The leading Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera said the docu­ment will stress the importance of labor unions, the dignity of farm work, the particular problems of the handicapped and emigrant workers and the impact of technological developments. 
In announcing the encyclical during his noon message Sunday, the pope said the document was "dedicated to human labor and to workers themselves," a theme he has taken up often since his election as pope in October 1978. 

In his travel the pope has often un­derlined the rights of the working man and has welcomed the develop­ment of the independent union Solidarity in his native Poland. 
Donning a hard hat in a steel mill in Temi, Italy, in March, the pope declared that workers had a right to struggle for "a just salary and a cer­tain participation in management." During a visit to a sugar plantation in the Philippines, he strongly defended workers' rights to or­ganize into unions. 
The pontiffhas given his endorse­ment to the efforts by the independent Solidarity union move­ment to represent workers in 
Social Concerns film series increases student awareness 
By ROBERT MAROVICH 
News Staff 
The Notre Dame Social Concerns Organization, in conjunction with the Center for Experiential Learn­ing, is sponsoring a Social Concerns film series, which begins tonight. 
The Student Government-based organization will pre-sent "To Kill a Mockingbird" tonight, Wednesday, and Thursday in the Engineering Auditorium. There will be no admis­sion charge. 
"Hospital", starring George C. Scolt, will be shown September 18 and 19 in Washington Hall. Admis­sion will be fifty cents. 
The film "Breaker Morant" will be shown at the Engineering Auditorium September 22, 23, and 24, and at the Annenberg Audih>rium in the Snite Museum of Art September 25 and 26. 

All presentations will run at 7 p.m. and 9:~0 p.m. 
"The ftJm series is designed to draw students out of their everyday atmosphere and increase their awareness of outside events,"explained jim Wolfe, Stu­dent Government commissioner of the Social Concerns Organization. "The series is the main program for the group and has been for several years." 
Wolfe said that the group is also planning a Neighborhood Roots program, designed to orient ND/SMC students to the South Bend Community and encourage their evaluation ofthe problems the areas are facing. The group is tenta-tively planning to fund seminars

Poland. But in a meeting with Solidarity leader Lech Walsea at the Vatican in january the pope urged that the union exercise prudence and moderation in its dealings with the government for the good of the entire country. 
The Soviet Union and other East bloc neihgbors have been increas­ingly critical of the series of labor reforms that have occurred in Poland since Solidarity's formation during a wave ofstrikes a year ago. 
The new encyclical was delayed by the shooting of the pope May 13, and john Paul said he put the finish­ing touches to it during his convales­cence at the papal summer palace in Castel Gandolfo. 
He said he wrote it for 90th an­niversary of Pope Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum -the first major papal en­cyclical on social issues. That docu­ment maintained the priority ofman and his ftJy over the state and af­firmed man's right to possess property and earn a living wage. 
An encyclical is one of the most important ways that a pope ex­presses his thoughts on specific mat­ters. 
In his ftrst encyclical, issued in March 1979, Pope john Pau~ II criticized the materialism of Com­munist and capitalist countries and warned that the arms race threatens destruction of mankind. In the second, issued last December, he 
said the church must speak out for mercy.

'Drastic action' 
Reagan proposes more cuts 
WASHINGTON(AP)-Having al­ready scaled down his planned in­creases for defense, President Reagan eyed further cuts in domes­tic spending yesterday on grounds that "we face the choice of taking drastic action or inviting economic calamity." 
Even so, he said, the reductions can be achieved "without any damage to any ofgovernment's vital services." 
The president's deputy press secretary, Lacey Speakes, declined to rule out Social Security as one ofthe areas where additional cuts would be made. He said the total reduc­tions in the upcoming fiscal 1982 budget would be less than $18 bil­lion. 
From a meeting with conservative congressional Democrats to a lunch with House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill and the House Republican leader, the president paid heed to budgetary matters, even as he presided at a ceremony officially proclaiming the bicentennial celebration ofthe revolutionary vic­tory at Yorktown. 
"At home, our enemy is no longer redcoats but red ink," Reagan said. 
"After 19 deficits in the last 20 
years and a national debt of nearly a 
trillion dollars, we face the choice of 
taking drastic action or inviting economic calamity," Reagan said. 1"0ur administration and I think the American people have the resolve to do what we know is right and what we know must be done. Make no 
mistake. We will." 

"I believe the spirit of Yorktown 
and the spirit of our revolution is 
still alive and well in America I'm 
confident that if we work together 
and reason together and stick to­
gether, then just like our forefathers, 
we'll be all right," he said. 

Speakes said ''right now there are 
no plans for .further cuts in entitle­
ments in '82." Entitlements are the 
federal programs including Social 
Security and food stamps, for which 
spending is governed by law. 

At the same time, Speakes pointed 
out that "there are problems with 
Social Security." The administration 
has said the Social Security System 
faces a shortfall by late next year un­
less its income or allocations are 
changed. 

Asked whetherhe administration was going to leave to the

!Jemocratic majority in the House the task ofproposing Social Security spending cuts or higher contribu­tions from wage earners, the spokes­man replied with a grin: "I've said all I'm going to say." 
Asked whether Reagan would cut SI 8 billion from the 1982 budget, for which he asked $695 billion last spring, Speakes said that figure was "a little high." 
With the presidential decision Saturday that the planned increase in military spending would be cut by S13 billion over the next three fiscal years, Reagan and his advisers turned their attention yesterday to domestic spending reductions as they seek to keep the fiscal 1982 budget deficit at $42.5 billion, despite continuing record-high in­terest rates, and balance the budget by fiscal 1984.

Off-campus townhouses proposed by Murday 
ByBILLKOLB 
News Staff 

Student Body President Don Mur­day presented to the Student Senate last night a South Bend teal estate broker's proposal for_ building off­campus student townhouses three blocks south ofUniversity property. Robert Hoover, brokerfor Gallery of Homes real estate agency, presented the proposal to a Campus Life Council Task Force last Thursday. He seeks a loan from the University at 7 percent interest for the S7 million, 300-unit con­dominium complex. Although Mur­day expressed doubts about the 
University's willingness to fund the 
project, he admitted that alumnae 
have expressed interest in funding a 
townhouse development. 

Hoover sought funding from banks and private lending institu­tions, but high interest rates ren­dered the project infeasible. If the University does not come through, he says, "I don't know what I'll do." 
A survey conducted last spring of students living off-campus revealed a well-defined need exists for low­cost student housing. Married and graduate students prefer to live alone in efficiencies while under­graduates prefer two-bedroom apartments tb.at can accomodate

three or four people. The study showed that students want to live securely and within walking dis­tance ofcampus, a grocery store and a laundromat. Hoover says his plan meets the students' needs. 
The plan calls for Hoover to manage the apartments jointly with Gayle Warner, former manager of Campus View apartments. John Leader, a South Bend architect, owns the proposed site, a triangular parcel of land bounded by South Bend Avenue, Twickenham and Howard. 
Murday says he plans to gather more information about the project and will voice the Senate's concerns about off-campus housing at the Uni­versity Trustees' meeting on Oc­tober 22. 
In other business, the Senate passed a final version ofa resolution that recommends the University adopt a two-day registration policy for the fall semester. Murday will

Upsets scrambled the Bottom Ten this week. Three teams from last week's poll suffered stunning victories in their season openers. 
Second-ranked Georgia Tech was confident as it traveled to Birmingham. The Wreck felt a rout at the hands of Bear Bryant and the Tide was assured. However, they surprised them­selves in a 24-21 victory. 
The game was also marked by classic Bottom Ten post-game quotes. Bryant: "This was no upset." (Even though Tech hadn't won an opener since the 60's.) Yellow Jacket Coach Bill Curry: "We have a bunch of skinny-necked youngsters who refuse to be beaten." (The former Packer may have to beat a few ofthem if he wants to climb back into the rankings.) 
In the Bottom Ten Hall of Fame game, Gloria "you'll love my stretch" Vanderbilt University downed the University of Lefty "We'll boycott the NCAA tournament" Driesell, 23-17. Vandy had been ranked 7th, but was surprised by the Terps slow-moving offense. 
In a daring move, Kansas State red-shined its eight best seniors this season. The Wildcats thought they were on their way to Bottom Ten supremacy, but the plan went awry. Last week's ninth-rar.ked team won a disappointing 31-10 game with the Wiley Coyotes of South Dakota. 
As per Bottom Ten regulations, these teams have been banned from the poll for one week. 
Last week's number one team had a scare as well. After wisely using all their time-outs early in the second half, Northwestern found itself down 21-20 to Indiana with the clock runningout. Feeling that a kick would be too risky, the Wildcats went for a two-point conversion. The strategy worked. The attempt failed and Northwestern's losing streak was extended. to 21. 
The first coaching casualty of the season is U1EP's Bill Michaels. He was fired after the Miners dropped their season opener to Texas A & I. A better man the Bottom Ten had never seen. 
Here, then, are the rankings: 
11 Michigan (0-1]--said Schembechler: "The offense wasn't any good, the defense wasn't any g?od, the kiclci~~ wasn't any good, and the coachmg was poor.

3] TCU (0-1]~-new slant on old theme: Christians fed to Tigers in loss to Auburn. 
4] Penn (0-0]--delaying the inevitable. 
51 Texas-EI Paso (0-1]--Coach Michaels was 5-43 during his tenure. 
6] Columbia (0-0]--"If Penn doesn't have to, why should we play?" Good question. 
7] Tennessee (0-2)--outscored 87-7 so far this week.

9] Cincinnati [0-2]--deepest penetration in 52-0 loss to Penn State was own 45 yard line.

East Carolina [1-1]--spied on North Carolina practices and still lost 56-0. Flon'da State [2-0]--only beat Memphis State by five. 
Maine [0-1]--loss to Lehigh impressed voters. 
Rice [0-1]--boiled by Texas, 31-3. 
john Cardinal Cody (0-10]--anticipating long road trip. 
QUOTE OF THE WEEK: 
Indiana coach Lee Corso on this week's game with USC: "I scheduled that game when I ftrst got here seven years ago. I didn't think I'd still

Wolverines will be looking up at the Irish in the polls, something that traditionally has been thought ofas a boost for the "underdog." But Faust insists that the latest rankings don't .change things. 
"It's going to be a tough game, no matter who's ranked where," he in­sists. "Sure, it's probably easier to get emotionally ready when you're the underdog, but being number one doesn't change much from our standpoint."

SRorts Gerry was right; "We're No. 1 !" 
Those who are familiar with his antics weren't the least bit surprised Friday evening when Gerry Faust was leading cheers into the microphone. "We are (clap,clap), ND" and "We're Number One:" 
On Friday evening everyone thought that it would be impossible for the Irish to be ranked No. 1 in the nation until later in the season, or at least until after beating Michigan (knock on woood). But after the top-ranked Wolverines ~ lost to Wisconsin, second-ranked Oklahoma struggled early with Wyoming before prevail­ing, 37-20, and No. 3 Alabama was upset by Georgia Tech, the ~ossibility emerged. 
After beating Loutsiana State Saturday, Tony Hunter said of the man who had coached him for five of the last seven years, "He's living out a dream." 
But the events of yesterday afternoon were simply too much. A dream team led by a man with onefame of college coaching experience was vote No.1 in the nation not only by the media, but by Faust's fellow coaches. 

-
"I think I'll retire now, " said a surprisingly jubilant Faust. "Yeah, this is a good time to retire." 
"You might have thought he'd view the 
recognition as a jinx of sorts; "a monkey on my 
back,'' as DePaul basketball coach Ray Meyer once called it. Yet it didn't seem to phase Faust in the slightest. 



He's used to being the best at what he does, and the accompanying pressure. His Moeller teams were often the best in the city, the state and the country. "I'm happy with being number one any time," he smiled. "The one (ranking) at the end of the season is the one that counts, but we'll take it when we can get it." 
Faust was careful, however. He did refuse to pose for one Observer photographer who asked him to point his first finger skyward. "We can't take a chance of it getting out to Michigan," he said with a grin. 
The obvious role reversal comes to mind. For weeks, people have been anticipatin~ Satur­day's clash between "top-ranked Mtchigan" and "highly-rated Notre Dame." Now the

Well-roundedness 
EDITOR'S NOTE--"Inside ND Interhall" will be a regular weekly feature in "The Observer". Its aim is to keep ihe students informed about up­coming events throughout the 1981-82 academic year in "intra "-collegiate athletics. This week, a bn'ef explanation ofwhat NVA are all about. 
Granted, with school just starting most of us have ''a million and one things going at once.'' But it is to one's advantage to take time to reflect upon the meaning of his or her education. If the extra effort is made to further one's education, it is important to make it a well-rounded one. 
"Well-rounded" means filling in the other halfof the education, specifically the social and athletic activities that are made available to us. The importance of involvement can be quite far reaching in its benefits. The activities sponsored by the office of Non-Varsity Athletics would help yourself and others physically and mentally in acting as an aid in learning to cope with others and life in general. This 

... 
knowledge, in turn, can readily be extended into the area ofacademics. This should help us to gain a broader sense in our respective fields of study. There is a good cross-section of activities offered through NVA from individual events such as tennis, golf and track, to team sports like volleyball, softball, and of course football, for men and women alike. Getting involved in these programs is as easy as making a phone ·c~l to the NVA office (6100) or by dropping by (C-2 in the ACC) and asking for more information about a sptcific interest. For those of you who are more money conscious, you can think ofit this way: you're paying for it whether you take advantage of it or not. Some of the latest notices are as follows:
