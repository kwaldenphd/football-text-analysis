Saint Mary's breaks barriers in sexuality education efforts 
Sexuality is often considered a taboo subject on the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses. Outside of a religious context, the topic seems to enjoy little discus­sion. Two schools, proud to graduate well-rounded, and liberally educated students, had been sadly lacking in educating students on a subject that may become more relevant in the future than many of their present courses. 
Saint Mary's, however, recently took a giant step towards removing that taboo and launched a progressive new Sexuality Education Series, debuting in january, and continuing this month. The series was born from sexuality survey results last spring, that showed a few unsurprising, but nevertheless disturbing answers from Saint Mary's students concerning sexual attitudes on the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses. 
The survey, sponsored by Campus Ministry and dis­tributed to all students, showed that less than half of Saint Mary's students believe there is an open attitude on campus towards dis­ucussing issues such as birth control, pregnancy, rape and homosexuality. And as few as 30 percent of stu­dents believe they have enough information and can ask questions about physical ---· problems and concerns. 
One of the most interest-L-...,----­ing results showed that seniors were generally less open about discussing sexual issues than were freshman. 
Any one of these survey -··"----­results pointed to the fact that something needed to be done. The Sexuality Educa­tion Council at the College, has put together an im­pressive new series for that purpose. According to Director of Campus Ministry Mary Feeley, the Sexuality series purpose will be to help each individual better understand and appreciate her sexuality. The series, divided into four parts, has been well­attended in its first two sessions, according to organizer Usa Ullrich'. The first session,"Know Your Body -The Inside Story," was led by Dr. Ellyn Stecker. The discus­sion attracted approximately 70 students and 12 to 15 

 staff members. 
The second session, "Body Maintenance," con­centrated on female hygiene, gynecological exams and breast self-exam, topics upon which the survey showed students have questions and need more information. 
Tomorrow the Sexuality Education Series continues with a session on "your body's warning signs," or problems such as herpes, venereal diseases, and AIDS. Sexually-transmitted diseases are not foreign to either

campus, and this program, "Protect Yourself and Ot­hers," shows that at least Saint Mary's has come to grips with reality. 
The last series topic will probably draw the most criticism of any others. Many will claim that a program dealing with contraceptives has no place on a Catholic campus. However, being Catholic and abstaining from the use of birth control, is no longer the norm, and the Sexuality Education Council has apparently recognized this. "Optimism-The Worst Contraceptive," will cover 
birth control -"what they are, how they work, what they look like," including the natural family planning method approved by the Catholic Church. The dis­cussion, Feb. 19 at 7 p.m. in Stapleton Lounge, will be led by Karen Wians and Ella Harmeyer of the nursing department, and is expected to draw the largest crowd of any session. 
Students are fond of com. plaining that in many areas, Saint Mary's is behind the times · in attitude and practice. And in many areas, they are correct. But the College is to be congrat· ulated for its progressive at­
titude concerning sexuality. Unlike Notre Dame, the College has no sexuality code attempting to dictate stu­dents' sexual behavior. Education, not regulation, seems to be the word to describe Saint Mary's attitude. 
And that is a welcome breath of fresh air for either campus.

Reagan calls for Philippine unity amidst election turmoil 
WASHINGTON -The Reagan ad­ministration, sidestepping judgment on reports of widespread fraud in the Philippine presidential election, called on both sides yesterday to abide by the outcome and work together for reforms without street demonstrations and violence. 
President Reagan, preparing to meet today with 20 U.S. government observers who had monitored the balloting, told reporters that despite charges of fraud the election showed there is a "strong two-party system now in the islands." 
Before leaving for home, the ob­servers reported instances of vote-buying, attempts at intimidation, snatching of ballot boxes, tampered election returns and the disfranchis­ing of thousands of quazlified voters in areas thought to be sympathetic to challenger Corazon Aquino in her race against President Ferdinand Marcos. 
One member of the delegation, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., told reporters last night on his return from the Philippines, "I think there were very serious problems in this election and everyone is aware of that." 
The delegation's co-chairmen, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. and Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., refused to dis­cuss their findings immediately, tel­ling reporters at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington that they would report on their findings when they meet with Reagan. 

A senior administration official, laying out U.S. policy but speaking on condition he not be identified by name, said, "The main thrust of our statement is not to have violence, not to have demonstrations in the street just because you didn't like the election (outcome). Get on the team and work with the government to form a government, whether it's Marcos or Aquino." 
Although the adminstration publicly portrayed the election outcome as being in doubt, one senior official, also speaking privately, said, "It seems very logical at this point that Marcos is going to win. It seems Marcos is going to get the majority." 
The official said the United,States' goal is to convince Marcos to listen to the opposition and deal with it fairly. 
Marcos and Aquino both claimed victory. 
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said, "Whatever the final outcome, the Filipino people have shown a truly inspiring com­mitment to the democratic process. They have voted in large numbers, they helped police the election 
process and literally protected bal­
lot boxes." 
At about the same time Speakes was briefing reporters, a band of Marcos opponents burned the Philippine president in effigy near the Philippine Embassy in Was­hington and called on the Reagan ad­ministration to pressure him out of office. 
Reagan, asked about election fraud during a meeting with out-of­town reporters, said, "I think any of us would be concerned." 
However, he said, "I'm not going to really comment in detail on the evidence of that" until after his meeting with the observer team.

Chinese 'Year ofthe Tiger' roars in 
By BUD LUEPKE 

StaffReporter 
The Chinese welcome in the new year with feasting, fireworks and dancing in that country's biggest nationwide party, said Ge Min, a visiting professor from China, last night at a Foreign Study Program lecture. 
Min, who has been at Notre Dame for a year on an exchange program from the Tiajin Foreign Language In­stitute, said the Chinese New Year is the largest annual celebration in China taking place over a five to seven day period. The New Year, 
also called the Spring Festival, 
begins on the first day of the lunar 
month which was Feb. 9. 

Min said planning for the holiday, which includes a huge feast, new clothes and fire works, begins a month ahead of time.

"But wouldn't you know it would be February.... I didn't think they'd give us a '31 dayer,' "said Gregory, referring to February only having 28 or 29 days. 
Gregory, a pioneer in the civil rights movement during the 60s, devoted much of his address to criticizing current administration policies. 
The best-selling author called President Ronald Reagan's State of the Union Address "an insult to God," and after reading aloud headlines about the president's proposal to cut health and student aid while boosting military spend­ing, Gregory asked, "What honest, ethical human being would make a statement like that?" 
Gregory, citing statistics showing the average household paid more than S5,000 in income tax ofwhich S3,100 went to defense said, "You try raising your house with that same type ofbudget." 
Take every S5,000 ofincome you have and spend more than $3,000 of it to buy weapons, he said, and even­tually "yourown children will attack you." 
Gregory, a leading expert on nutrition, added that the strongest nation is not the one with the most bombs and weapons, but "the one that has the strongest people men­tally and physically." 
Gregory, who has fasted more than than 100 times to draw atten­tion to such issues as the plight of blacks and the Equal Rights Amend­ment, also criticized the food stamp program. 
"We never needed a food stamp. We needed a nutrition stamp," said the author of"Cooking with Mother Nature," explaining that food stamps permit the poor to buy sugar, donuts and soft drinks. 
The political activist Gregory also chastised television evangelists such asjimmy Swaggert. "They never talk about racism," he said. "How can you talk about sin without talking about racism?" 
Even Notre Dame, where his own brother graduated, did not escape Gre~ory's criticism.

But, he added, ''when God comes, it will be the Mother Theresas He'll take and not the Knute Rocknes."

Landers acknowledged that she is jewish and that her religion does not forbid abortion. 
Landers did offer some words of optimism and encouragement to college studentsin general. 
"I have some good news about campuses today. Students are looking better. Students are thinking better. And students are smelling better," she said. 
Landers, speaking at Notre Dame for the eighth time in her career, had some words of praise for University President Father Theodore Hes­burgh, a personal friend of hers for over three decades. 
"You have something special at Notre Dame and it starts at the top.

When I first met Father Hesburgh, his hairwas as blackas a raven's wing and he was lean," quipped Landers. But in the subsequent 35 years, Hes­burgh "has made Notre Dame a spe­cial place because of his high standards. When he is gone, they are going to miss him here." 
Landers concluded her lecture by offering a bit ofadvice to all in atten­dance. 
"If I could give just one bit of advic,. to everyone in the world, I could do it in just two words: be

ver the last year, the compact disk has been steadily es­tablishing itselfas the newest and best advancement in music. As the world encounters the incomparable sound quality attainable with CD, more and more people are sinking money into compact disk players with the belief that they are invest­ing in the future of the music in­dustry. It is thought that the compact disk will soon replace records and usher in a new and profitable age for the slumping record companies. In any case, the CD has arrived. 
The compact disk player is an interesting piece of machinery. A laser pickup (instead ofa needle) is used to "read" millions ofmicro­scopic indentations on the surface ofthe compact disk. These tiny "pits" as they are called, are used to hold coded information which the laser can interpret and through the wonders of modern electronics, turn into music. Make that great sounding music. 
It is interesting to note that these "pits" are also versatile. This met­hod ofstoring information is also used in the less-ackowledged videodisk. In the case ofthe videodisk, however, there are two simultaneously laser-read tracks (audio and visual) whereas the compact disk has only one. 
The real reason that more com­pact disk player owners have been showing up (including a proud group ofNO students) is that the price has dropped drastically recently. Since 1984 the average cost ofa CD player has been literally sliced in half. 1"1 more material terms, this is a cut ofclose to S250. With price reductions of this type it is no wonder the market is picking up. 
At this moment in time, a list of quality players reads like aJapanese phonebook. Sony, Magnavox, Yamaha, Toshiba, Pioneer, and Technics (a division ofMatsushita) all have quality machines on the market. American companies also have this t~l:hnology and can produce laser pickup machines. RCA has been working with laser pickup since the late 19iO's. However, in this market as in the

T 
nt: new exhibit in the print 
room ofthe Snite Museum, 

'Artists and Models: Portraits from 
the Hirshorn Museum and 
Sculpture Garden,' is an exciting 
compendium encompassing the 
famous and the obscure, from 
humorous caricatures to emotion­
packed realism. The prints, 
drawings, watercolors and 
photographs are done largely by 
European born Americans whose 
personal styles, in some cases, 
present great contrasts. These vast 
differences, however, do not 
detract from the unity of the exhibit 
since all the portraits are neces­
sarily individual 'ways ofseeing' the 
human face and form. 
The show has been touring na­tionally under the auspices ofthe Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) and will remain on view at Notre Dame until March 9. Most ofthe works selected for this exhibit by Frank Getting, curator ofprints and drawings at the Smithsonian, have been specifi­cally chosen to portray the artist's own feelings about friends, favorite models, politicians--and in self­portraits, the artist himself. Several ofthe portraits give psychological insight into the character ofthe artist or the unique relationship between the anist and the model. If the artist isn't particularly well­known, the writeup on this model's signifigance in the life ofthe artist, which is conveniently placed next to each portrait is helpful in ex­periencing the show. 
Some of the portraits, like Alfred Stieglitz's photo ofhis painter friend Oscar Bluemner ( 1915), and Alice Ned's watercolor ofher bohemian Greenwich Village companion Kenneth Dolittle ( 1931), demonstrate the emotional inter­play between the artist and model as well as giving a unique view of the model's personality. Others, such as Louis Eilshmius' portrait in chalk on paper ofRobert Lindner, a fellow anist, is indicative ofthe artists temperment rather than the acquaintance. In this case there was a competition as to who could complete the others portrait in less 
automobile industry, American companies cannot compete with the quality and affordability of Japanese machines. 
Three ofthe models found in a short search of the campus in­cluded two models by Technics and one by Pioneer. All three ofthese models contain the usual array of "state ofthe art" functions available on quality CD players. The machines are made with the ability to correct any imperfect coding found in the disks. This feature is an immediate eye-opener and con­tinued investigation into CD player capabilities leads to funher amaze­ment. They can be programmed to play any sequence ofson~ (this includes the ability to play one song many times in succession), skip past songs or even parts ofsongs and can scan to desired positions anywhere on the disk. The Technics models are also equipped with counter­timers which can be used to show the time a song has been playing. 
Perhaps the best feature is the impeccable sound quality attainable with compact disk and laser pickup. "The disks are much better than records," commented Tim Sigward, owner of a brand-new Technics SL-P1. "With care, CO's will last much longer and will retain dear sound quality." 
Larry Fey, who owns a Pioneer PDSOIO had much the same response. "There is no outside noise ofany kind," he said. "The background is perfectly dead silence and the sound quality remains constant with age." There is no hiss at all in the background and the disks are never subject to any distortion ofstereo recording. 
In fact, the quality ofstereo dis­tinctness is fantastic. "CD does a 
· much better job with stereo than records," said Mike Tatigian who owns a Technics SL-Pl04. "The different sounds are always sharp and dear." 
The disks are made ofa metallic substance (into which the "pits" are indented) with a plastic coating around the outer edge. There is a hole in the middle which is also coated with plastic. The disks come in att.ractive and protective cases time, and Eilshmius, whose inability to sustain friendships stemmed from this intense desire to be the best, won, and lost another friend." Portraits like these, that express such strong stories ofthe faults inherent in human nature, can be a moving experience. 
Not allot the portraits arc· con­cerned with such intense feelings. For instance. Thomas Han Benton's "The Am'-·ri, 1n in Hi .rnrlio · 
( 1921 ) a semi-cubist water­color, virtually obliterates any expression of interplay between arttst and suhject and even downplays his own involvement in favor ofpresenting the generalized theme and playing with form and color. The caricatures, especially those ofsuch well known figures as Jackson ~ollock are rather en­joyable viewing without losing their expressiveness, inherent in the exagerated features and incon­gruous settings. 
Overall the exhibit is sometimes intensely emotional with various and sundry comic aspects in­termixed, but definitely worthwhile. 
with instructions for storage and 
Late included. The CD is a great 
new medium for the sale of musical recordings. The biggest drawback is 
the price. At an average of n 5 a 
disk, customers are unwilling to choose new or unfamiliar music on CD. "People usually pick music they know," said Steve Montgomery ofMusicland in the North Village Mall. He went on to mention that two ofhis store's bestselling disks are Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms and Pink Floyd's Dark Side ofthe Moon. Fey and Tatigian also had good words to say about the Dark Side CD. "It (Dark Side) was made to be on compact disk," said Tatigian. 
At this time, it is still very difficult to find older music on CD. Montgomery noted that Musidand is beginning to get some back stock (Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel and some jazz) but claims that only a few titles will be coming in because it is extremely expensive to master recordings for CD and record com­panies are only mastering music they think will sell. Customers are forced to settle for whatever is in stock. Also, due to the low demand, record stores like Musicland can 
going to sell and therefore order 
conservatively. Consequently, 
Montgomery said, "Many titles are 
hard to keep in stock." So, ifone 
wants a certain disk, one has to be 
in the right place at the right time. 
On the whole, compact disks offer the conscientious music-lover great recordings and a bright out­look for the future. With the arrival ofmore older music on disk, even discriminating buyers may find things they love on CD. Ultimately, however, ifthe compact disk is to revolutionize the music industry, the price must be reduced.

to continue their favorite style of pia~ this season -pounding it inside to get the points or the foul. The Irish rank behind only Michigan and Syracuse, a team they outrebounded in Saturday's victory, in rebound margin. They should be able to keep this statistic up against the smaller 
Rams. 
One thing the Irish must guard against is a letdown. Feelings ran high after Saturday's game, but the Irish must keep their mind on the game at hand. This may be harder than it seems with Duke lying in wait on Sunday.

Strategy plays a part in East's All-Star win 
DALLAS -Strategy usually plays a small part of AU-Star games in any sport. Coaches tend the let the players display their talent the best way they can. 
But Sunday's NBA AU-Star clash at Dallas proved to be an exception as Eastern Conference Coach K.C. Jones found a winning combination with one center, three forwards and Detroit guard lsiah Thomas. 
With center Moses Malone of Philadelphia, Boston forwards Larry Bird and Kevin McHale, forward Buck Williams of New Jersey and Thomas on the floor together with less than four minutes left, the East trailed 128-1 21. 
"We tried to get a mismatch wherever we could," Jones said. "We let lsiah bring the ball up and find the open man. When we were down with three minutes to go, I thought it was over. But we gotgreat efforts from Moses and Buck, and I liked the effort by Mr. Thomas, too." 
The one-guard East offense out­scored the West 18-4 down the stretch to win the 36th NBA all-Star game 139-132. 
Thomas, who won his second All­Star Most Valuable Player award, had 10 assists and scored 12 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter, includ­ing four free throws during an 8-0 spurt that put the East in front to stay. 
In addition to Thomas, the other four East players on the floor at the end were the team's biggest con­tributors. 

Malone scored seven of his 16 points in the final period and added 13 rebounds. 
Bird had 2 3 points and seven steals, Williams 13 points and seven rebounds and McHale eight points and 10 rebounds. 
"Moses got some key rebounds, Buck had a big tip-in (with 58 seconds left to make it 135-132 ), and Bird was Bird," Thomas said. "I think we were pretty strong at the end with four big guys on the floor. Bird is interchangeable. He handles the ball so well." 
"Considering the talent we had on this roster, I was a little surprised to be used as much as I was," said Wil­liams, who played 20 minutes. "I was especially surprised to be there late in the game." 
The close game was a fitting climax to a momentous weekend that saw 5-7 Spud Webb of the At­lanta Hawks, the smallest player in the NBA, win Saturday's slam-dunk championship with three perfect scores in the final round. That came after Bird won the first-ever three­point shooting championship by hit­ting 18 of 25 long-distance shots in the finals. 
"This was one of the best All-Star games ever," said West guard Earvin "Magic" Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers, who dazzled a sellout crowd of 16,573 with 15 assists, many of them on blind passes. 


Becker and Graf· win in Lipton International 
A.t8oclated Press 
BOCA RATON, Fla. -West Ger­many's Boris Becker and Steffi Graf weren't sharp last night, but they were good enough to win their opening-round matches in the 1.8 million dollar Lipton International Players Championships tennis tournament. 
Becker, the 18-year-old reigning Wimbledon champion and seeded fourth in this Grand Slam-sized tour­ney, won a hard-hitting battle with Tom Nijssen of the Netherlands 6-3, 7-5. 
The 16-year-old Graf, seeded second in the 128-player women's singles, found her lost stroke early in the second set and rebounded to score a 1-6, 7-5, 6-1 victory over Melissa Gurney. 
Scott Davis, a surprise finalist in this two-week tournament last year, ~nd Andrea Jaeger, once ranked third in the world, were opening­day losers. Wolfgang Popp of West Germany ousted Davis 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, while Jaeger fell to Ann Hendrick­sson 6-7,6-2, 6-2. 
In other night women's matches, 13th-seeded Stephanie Rehe beat Carina Karlsson of Sweden 6-3, 6-3 and Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria survived a rocky start to stop Laura Arraya Gildemeister of Peru 4-6, 6-1, 
6-1. 
In the night men's matches, No. 20 David Pate slipped past Terry Moor 6-1, 6-3 and No. 24 Aaron Krickstein won when Goran Prpic of Yugoslavia retired with a knee injury while trailing 4-0 in the first set. 
Becker had more trouble with Nijssen, a qualifier, than most would have expected. But he said he wasn't surprised at the tough match. 
"I didn't play a tournament for three weeks," Becker said. "I wasn't in the right position to hit my shots. I didn't really have a weakness, I just didn't hit some shots." 
In her victory over Gurney, Graf changed from a baseline game and began attacking, moving to the net, with the score tied 2-2 in the second set. She lost that game to fall behind 2-3, but then ran off three straight 

love games to take control of the match. 
Davis lost to Tim Mayotte in a five­set struggle in last year's final. Things have changed a lot in the past I 2 months for Davis, a 23-year-old from Santa Monica, Calif. 
"Obviously, I've dropped a lot since last year," Davis said. "I wish I could be in the finals every week, but lately I haven't been playingvery well." 
Davis argued with the umpire over several line calls, but he refused to take anything away from Popp's victory. 
"He played very well," said Davis, who was seeded 16th here. "He doesn't have a big game, but he makes you play every point." 
The full afternoon of tennis on ll courts at Boca West featured only a few mild upsets, but the fans were thrilled that one of them was by the resort's touring pro, Tim Gullikson. 
Gullikson· edged 27th-seeded Heinz Gunthardt of West Germany 7-6.7-6.

Dowhower keeps his eye on three Big-10 quarterbacks 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS Indianapolis Colts coach Rod Dowhower says he has his eye on three Big Ten Con­ference quarterbacks for the April 29 draft. 
The three are Jim Everett of Purdue, Chuck Long of Iowa and Jack Trudeau of Illinois, Dowhower said yesterday. 
The coach said he may not use the Colts' first-round choice, which is No.6 overall, on any ofthe three, but added that he will give serious con­sideration to each of them prior to the draft. 
"Both Everett and Long are tall, have good arms, are accurate and mobile," Dowhower said. "They were very consistent in their play last season, are bright and have a lot ofability." 

Trudeau, who is recovering from knee surgery after being injured in a postseason all-star game, had trouble at first but finished strong last season. 
"At the moment, I don't see his knee creating any problems," Dowhower said. 
The coach said three or four veteran quarterbacks were also being considered before the draft, including Dallas' Gary Hogeboom. But, Dowhower added, "I don't know if bringing in a veteran quar­terback is the ultimate answer."

However, when Clark fouled out with 6:5 7 left in the game, things had already gotten out of hand. With the UIC bench only three players deep, the change in tempo took its toll on the Flames.

CHICAGO -The Chicago Bulls won't know until later this week ex­actly when ailing Michael Jordan will return to the lineup after a 3 l /2-month layoff, a Bulls spokesman said yesterday. 
jordan, who broke a bone in his left foot in Chicago's third game of the season, was seeing a doctor in Eugene, Ore., yesterday and would be consulting with another specialist today in Cleveland before reporting back to the Bulls' physician, Dr. john Hefferon, said Tim Hallen, a spokesman for the Na­tional Basketball Association club. 
"Then we'll compare notes and make a decision," said Hallen. 
jordan had said he was hopeful he could play Friday against the Indiana Pacers or Sunday when the Dallas Mavericks play in Chicago. 
But Bulls General Manager Jerry Krause said all three doctors would have to say jordan's foot is ready. 
"If one of those doctors says it's not ready, then he won't play," Krause said in Dallas Sunday. 
jordan, the NBA's Rookie of the Year last season, told reporters he was cenain the Bulls would make the playoffs ifhe comes back healthy and plays the rest of the season. 
"I know what I can do," he said. "I won't let this team miss the playoffs." 
The Bulls, sorely missing Jordan's many talents, are suffering with a 17­34 record, but trail the Cleveland Cavaliers by only two games in the race for the NBA East's final playoff berth. 
Chicago has 31 games remaining. including tomorrow night's 76ers game at Philadelphia. 
jordan said he felt at practice last week that his left calf was getting stronger. 
"Everything felt normal at practice," he said. 

Volleyball Club faces three rivals at home this week 
Deep in the confines of the ACC there exists a dark secret which only a few have witnessed. Those who have ventured into this "pit" have seen the awesome spectacles ofsets, smashes and kills. They have watched tall, powerful warriors destroy the likes ofWolverines and Razorbacks. 
Now everyone can discover this dark secret as the men's 
Volleyball Club will attempt to destroy three foes in the 
ACC pit this week. Tomorrow night the Irish will face Cal­
vin College at 7:30, followed by Purdue Friday at 7:30, and 
Wisconsin Saturday at 1 p.m. 
Notre Dame has the distinction of being the only vol­
leyball club in the NCAA competing as a varsity team. This 
has helped the team schedule meets against some of the 
strongest teams in the nation. 
For example, the Irish traveled to Columbus, Ohio this 
past weekend to participate in the Ohio State Tournament. 
The team played very well, making it to the semifinals, 
along with three teams ranked in the top 20 in the country. 
In the first match on Saturday, Notre Dame faced the 
University ofArkansas. After dropping two ofthe first three 
games, the Irish rallied to win, 1 5-12, 6-1 5, 7-15, 15-I I, 
15-7. 
"Overall we played pretty well, but our passing broke 
down and we made way too many service errors," said 
Head Coach Bill Anderson. "We have a habit of dropping 
down to our opponent's level, but we eventually snap out 
of it." 
Mark Trautman gave his usual fine performance as he registered 29 kills in 72 attempts. Jeff Westrich and Mike O'Grady also played well for Notre Dame. 
The team was immediately pressed into action after the Arkansas match as it met East Stroudsburg State (Pa. ). Ranked 14th in the nation, East Stroudsburg rolled over a weary Irish squad, I 5-4, 1 5-8, I 5-9.

On Sunday the Irish found themselves in the semifinals against the host Buckeyes. After running up a lead of8-4 in the first game, Notre Dame dropped the game 1 5-12. Again in the second game the Irish ran up a lead only to drop the game 1 5-11. Finally Ohio State took control of the final game, winning 15-7. 
"It's the best I've seen our team play," said Anderson. "We played together and up to our potential. It was a tribute to the players that the Ohio State coach kept his top players in the entire match." 
 

On Saturday the Gymnastics Club's women's team traveled to Valparaiso, Ind. for a dual meet against the Crusaders. The Irish performed well, but came up shon againSf; a strong Valparaiso varsity unit. 
Cheryl Sydow finished founh in the all-around for Notre Dame, She took third in both the vault and the beam, and she placed fifth in the floor exercise. Michelle Broussard was the next gymnast to place for the Irish, taking sixth overall. She finished fourth in the uneven bars and sixth in both the beam and the vault. 
"Overall we did well," said Club President Jim Ciesil. "Cheryl and Michelle did alright, but they should perform better in the upcoming meet against Purdue." 
The meet against Purdue will take place this Saturday at 2 p.m. at the Angela Athletic Facility. Both the men's and the women's teams will compete as they hope to sweep the Boilermakers. 
 

The Ski Team wrapped up its regular season schedule with a meet at Caberfae this past weekend. john O'Donovan skied well for the men, finishing second in the slalom and third in the giant slalom, and Chris Simonet took seventh in the slalom. 
Both the St. Mary's and the Notre Dame women's teams raced only three skiers each, as this meet was not sig· nificant in the regional qualifying. Maureen Connaughton took third in the slalom and eighth in the giantslalom for St. Mary's. The Irish were led by Laurie Shea, who took seventh in the slalom and founh in the giant slalom, and Jane Heisel, who placed sixth in the slalom. 
As of yesterday, both the men's and women's teams of Notre Dame had qualified for the regional meet which will be held this weekend at Iron Mountain in the upper penin­sula of Michigan. The St. Mary's team had not yet received official word. 
 

And finally, the Squash Club has collected several im­pressive performances through the first halfofits season. 
William Mapother won the "D" division singles at a tournament in St. Louis, and he also advanced to the semi­finals of a tournament in Chicago. In Indianapolis, Sanjay Dalal finished second in the "D" division singles and Chaitanya Panchal advanced to the quarterfinals in the "A" division singles. 
As a team the Squash Club beat Michigan and lost to Purdue. The team still has a dual meet against Miami (Ohio) and a triangular meet against Purdue and Illinois upcoming. Finally, the team will return to Indianapolis to attempt to qualify for the national tournament.

Women's tennis team jumps to 3-0 following weekend tournament 
By TRISH SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's tennis team set a few JOals before the start of the 1986 8pl'ing season. Some of the obvious goals were to improve upon its record oflast season and to gain a berth in the NCAA tourna­ment. After this weekend's past per­formance, it seems that the Irish are on their way. 
The squad traveled to Springfield, Mo., where they took on Southwest Missouri State, Oklahoma and Kansas State. According to Head Coach Michele Gelfman, it was probably the toughest season opener she could have scheduled. 
"I knew that this was a tough way to open the season, but I felt the girls would be ready," said Gelfman, the 1985 North Star Conference coach ofthe year. "All through practice the week before the intensity level was high, so we had a good feeling." 
The Irish certainly kept that inten­sity going as they handily defeated each opponent. The team took on the Sooners first, taking them by a 

St. Mary's fencers improve to 9-7 
By GLOKIA ELEUTERI ~ 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's fencing team (9­
7) continoed to show its strength Saturday when it traveled to Chicago to meet Northwestern, Lawrence, Purdue, Ohio State and Case Western Reserve.. In their fourth tournament ofthe season, the Belles scored a 3-2 team record. 
The opening match was one of the slowest starts of the season. A loss of 14-2 was handed to the Belles by a strong Northwestern team. 
"I expected us to do a better job against Northwestern, but the team was more competitive than in previous meets," said Coach Mike Weeks. "It was a frustrating defeat for the team." 
Saint Mary's was able to rally to defeat Purdue ( 10-6) and Lawrence ( 14-2 ). The final bouts of the day ended in a split, with a loss to Ohio State ( 11-5) and a victory over Case Western Reserve ( 10-6 ). 

Cardinals name Gene Stallings to take over head coaching spot 

ST. LOUIS -Gene Stallings, a dis­ciplinarian and protege of coaching legends Paul "Bear" Bryant and Tom Landry, was named yesterday to succeed Jim Hanifan as coach ofthe St. Louis Cardinals. 
"I'm sorry Coach Bryant couldn't be here," Stallings said at a news con­ference where he was introduced by team owner William V. Bidwill. "I know somewhere he's smiling." 
The appointment of Stallings, an assistant to Landry with the Dallas Cowboys and a former head coach at Texas A&M, ended Bidwill's ar­duous search for a coach. Hanifan and his assistants were fired just 15 minutes after the Cardinals lost the final game ofthe 1985 NFL season to the Washington Redskins Dec. 21. 
The 1985 Cardinals posted a dis­appointing 5-1 1 record after being picked by some experts to to win the NFC East. Critics contended that, although Hanifan was well­liked by his players, he did not impose the discipline needed to win and make the playoffs. 
Stallings agreed with descriptions of himself as tough, but added that he abo can be compassionate. 
"There's nothing wrong in liking your players," Stallings said. "I've got a job to do and that is to make Mr. 
5-3 margin. Next came the Bears of 
Southwest Missouri, who fell to the 
Irish, 5-4. 'fhe final contest was 
against the Wildcats ofKansas State, 
whom the Irish downed by a 5-1 
margin. 

"As a whole, the team perfor-· mance was outstanding," added Gdfman. "The Jlirls came together as a team and rallied when we needed them to. We aren't quite at our peak yet, but we will be soon, I assure you." 
lbe highlights of the weekend came from the sparkling play of senior Mary Colligan (Fort Wayne, Ind.) and the doubles team ofsenior Susie Panther (Prarie Village, Kan.) and Michelle Dasso (Sunnyside, Wash. ). More than once over the weekend, these girls were called on to fight back after being down in the final sets. Colligan pulled together in singles action to provide key vic­tories that meant the difference for the team, while Panther and Dasso led a doubles crew that only lost one match in two days. 
"There were a few mental lapses out there," commented Panther. 
"There seems to be mental lapses tion was the toughest she too has occuring that cause the losses," said faced . Weeks. "These lapses are technical "Being able to travel with the ones and will hopefully receive tream and competing against tough greater concentration before the varsity players gave me a chance to next meet." see what I hadn't experienced yet,"

"It's been a long search and I've talked to a lot of fine football coaches and fine men," Bidwill said in introducing Stallings. "But you have to stop and make a judgment. And I think I've picked the best man for the fob." 
The 50..year-old Stallings, a native of Paris, Texas, became the Car­dinals' ninth head coach since the team moved here from Chicago in 1960. Bidwill confirmed that he gave Stallings a four-year contract, but he declined to disclose financial terms. 
"We had just driven 12 hours, got 
out of a van and had to play nine 
hours oftennis. But once we regined 
our form and started playing our 
game, we pulled it out." 
The Irish now have a three-week layoff before returning to regular­season action against Purdue on Saturday, March 1 at West Lafayette, Ind. Last year, the team easily .defeated the Boilermakers, 8-1, but the· 3-0 Notre Dame squad isn't chalking up another victory just yet. 
"I am very pleased with how the 
girls have played, but that doesn't 
mean we won't have to work for our 
matches," insists Gelfman. "This 
time off will provide some extra 
practice time and help us prepare 
for the start of the real bulk of our 
season." 
The first home match for the Irish takes place on March 7-8, when Notre Dame hosts a quadrangular meet against Bradley, Saint Mary's and Akron. Ifthe girls continue with the success they have already seemed to establish, it could mean more than just a berth in the NCAA tournament.

17:22 freshman Roy Bemiss added the third unanswered goal with an assist from sophomore Mike McNeill to cut Army's lead to 6-5. 
The clock soon became Notre Dame's primary opponent and in the final minute Coach Smith was forced to pull the goalie for added scoring ability. This enabled the Cadets to chalk up an easy goal for the 7-5 mar­gin ofvictory. 
Army clearly had more shots on goal than Notre Dame, as indicated by the 30 saves that Irish goale Tim Lukenda registered as compared to 19 for the Cadet goalie. 
In Saturday afternoon's action, Cadet junior Matt Wilson and senior Darryl MacDonald each scored twice to carry Army to a 6-3 victory 

.over Notre Dame. The triumph was the eighth straight for Army and raised its record to over .500 for theI first time this season.

Elliott takes 

pole position 

at Daytona 
DAYTONA BEACH, Ra. -Bill El­liott picked up yesterday where he left off last year, running off to the pole position for the Daytona 500 with a fast lap of 205.039 mph. 


His Ford Thunderbird will share the front row with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS ofGeoffBodine, who was just behind at 204.545, a separa­tion on the clock of just .I 1 of a second. 
Elliott, who won both the pole and the race a year ago to begin an incredible season in which he dominated the superspeedways with 11 poles and 1 1 victories, just missed his own track qualifying record of 205.114. 
"I'm very surprised," drawled the red-haired driver from Dawsonville, Ga. "All the testing that everybody

breaking the single session mark of 16 and the race record of 18, both set in time trials last May for the Winston 500. 
But the speeds were not as high as had been forecast before the first round of qualifying was postponed by rain on Saturday. 
Sterlin Marlin, son offormer racer Coo Coo Marlin, was the biggest surprise among the 54 drivers who made at least one of the two al­lowable qualifying laps Monday. 


Marlin, the 1983 Rookie of the Year who is driving this year for veteran car owner Hoss Ellington, was the third fastest qualifier at 204.355. His showing was good enough to

Waldbillig added a second assist when he set up Anquillare for a goal at 19:1 3 of the second period to pull the Irish within one, but Army scored just 12 seconds later to give the Cadets a 4-2 lead heading into the third period. 
Wilson, Army's leading scorer, gave the Cadets their biggest lead of the game when he teamed with Bob Nabb on a 2-on-1 break and scored his I 7th goal ofthe season. 
Notre Dame's McNeill made it 5-3 with an assist from Reilly with 59 seconds left, but MacDonald scored into an empty net 36 seconds later to close out the scoring. 
Irish goalie Marc Guay made 33 saves, while Army goalie Paul DeGironimo stopped 22 shots. 
While Coach Smith was obviously dissappointed with the two close defeats, he was still pleased with the effort that the team is putting forth. 
"The team worked hard and refused to quit," he said. "The third­

period scoring in both games is quite encouraging because it is in­dicative ofa good effort." 
"Our biggest problem has been our passing game. Without sharp passing, it is impossible to capitalize on an opponent's mistakes. Our pas­sing has led to somewhat ofa scoring slump and has consequently spelled defeat. But with so many freshmen and sophomores on the ice you can't really expect perfect passing." 
Notre Dame travels to Kent, Ohio next weekend to take on the Golden Flashes of Kent State. While the Irish defeated Kent State in two home games earlier this season, Smith is somewhat cautious about predict­ing two easy victories. 
"I am confident that we can beat Kent State again," he said, "but the last time we played them we had a full roster with the exception of Bob Thebeau. It could be a different game without Chapman and Badalich."
