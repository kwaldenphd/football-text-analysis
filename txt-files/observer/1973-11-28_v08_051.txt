.. ATHENS <UPI>-The new government 
Tuesday began to release persons arrested in the 
rebellion against ousted President Goerge 
Papadopoulos' regime eight days before a 
military coup overthrew it. 
The move was seen as a conciliatory gesture 
toward students by the two-day-old military­
backed government. 

In Athens, where the government last week 
said 302 persons were being held in connection 
with the rebellion which began at the Athens 
Polytechnic school, authorities began releasing 
the prisoners in small grouos. 
WASHINGTON <UPI>-President Nixon will provide "complete information" on his personal finances probably this week but has not decided if he will make his actual income tax returns public, Deputy Press Secretary· Gerald L. Warren said Tuesday. 
Warren said the President has not determined "in what form or forum" he will make the financial disclosures, but that ehw White House has been at work compiling information for release. 
Nixon admitted in a recent news conference that he paid only "nominal" taxes in 1970 and 1971 because he deducted $500,000 for volumes of £ice-presidential papers he turned over to the National Archives. 
WASHINGTON <UPI>-The House voted 311­88 Tuesday to place the country on daylight saving time year-round until the end of April, 1975, in order to conserve energy. 
If the measure is approved by the Senate and 
signed into law by President Nixon, almost 
evoeryone in the country would have to turn their 
clocks ahead one hour beginning at 2 a.m. on the 
first Sunday that falls 15 days after the law is 
enacted. 

WASHINGTON <UPI)-The Defense andl Interior Departments said Tuesday they ordered 22 major U.S. oil companies 11 days ago to divert 826 million gallons of fuel from civilian users to meet "bare minimum essential" military needs to the end of the year.

HPC leads crusade 
against early return 
byJimEder Staff Reporter 
The Hall Presidents Council last night decided to invite each of the members of the Academic Council to its meeting next Tuesday to hear grievances about the university's new academic calendar. 
John Mazza, a student member of the Academic Council, advised the hall presidents not to give up hopes for achieving an alternative to the proposed calendar. "Much can still be done," he said. "In light of the fact that 89 per cent of the 3,000 students polled disap­proved of the calendar, Fr. Burt­chaell's rather vague arguments supporting it are not very con­vincing. There is still an op­portunity for alternatives." 
HPC Chairman Pat McLaughlin urged the presidents to encourage all students interested in the calendar to attend the special meeting of the Student Life Council scheduled for 4:30 p.m. this Thursday at the Center for Con­tinuing Education. Provost James 
T. Burtchaell will be present to listen to student grievances and 

suggestions  and  to  answer  any  
questions  regarding  the  new  
calendar.  

Phil Byrnes, president of Alumni, who first proposed that the HPC invite the members of the Academic Council to its meeting next week, pointed out that "there are inconsistencies in Burtchaell 's logic and reasoning behind the new calendar that should be questioned." 
In other business before the HPC last night, Assistant Vice President for Business Mfairs, Brother Kieran Ryan explained the new safety regulations prohibiting the use of natural evergreen trees and-or branches in any residence or other interior area of the university. 

"This regulation is a result of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act which makes every employer responsible for providing safe and healthful conditions for his employees," he said. "Students as well as all those people employed by the university are protected by this law." 
Ryan further explained that "before this legislation was passed, employers were only subject to private suits and thus, only responsible after the fact. Now, every employer, including the university, is subject to penalties enforced by the govern­ment before the fact." 
After Ryan urged the hall presidents to enforce this regulation strictly with no ex­ceptions, the HPC unanimously decided to join the SLC in sup-

Letters sent to congressmen 
Burrell receives replies on impeachment 
by Ken Bradford Staff Reporter 

Fr. David Burrell, chairman of the Notre Dame Theology Department, has received letters from two Congressmen responding to his letters calling for the im­peachment of the President. 
Fr. Burrell's letter stated, "It has become clear that the preservation of what integrity we have as a people and Congress has as an arm of that people demand precisely that we dispense with Richard Nixon for the sake of the presidency." 
The letter was a reaction to the "unconscionable actions" of Oc-
Course offered for students helping "With retarded children 
by Mellissa A. Byrne Staff Reporter 

The Department of Psychology will re-offP.r a course next semesterwhich allows students to earn academic credit for a com­bination of volunteer and classroom experience. 
The three credit hour course will require students to do volunteer work with a retarded child at the Developmental Disabilities Center on the corner of Angela and Notre Dame Avenue. 
This non-major course, Behavior Change and the Retarded, will require one hour of classwork and four hours of supervised volunteer work per week. 
"Many students are interested in doing volunteer work for the un­derprivileged groups," said Eric Ward, program director at the Developmental Disabilities Center and ND graduate student in 
Inform residence office before moving off-campus 
by Jeanne Murphy Staff Reporter 

Are you thinking about moving off-campus in January? 
Father John M. Mulcahy, Director of Student Residence, has asked all students intending to move off-campus next semester to inform the residence office of such a move before December 15. If notification is not given before this dat, the student will lose his $50 deposit fee and will be billed for second semester room and board. 
Mulcahy mentioned that in the past, students moved off-campus in January without notifying the residence office and ruined chances for other students to get a room in the dorms. Students

tober 20, when President Nixon fired Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckleshaus, as well as forcing the resignation of Attorney General Elliot Richardson. 
Fr. Burrell referred to falsehoods perpetrated by Nixon's spokesmen and stated, "It seems that only such types are left to the President, and it is clear that left to them or to himself he constitutes a menace to this nation." 
Fr. Robert Drinan, Represen­tative from Massachusetts and a member of the House Judiciary Committee, responded to Fr. Burrell's letter with an appeal to Notre Dame students.

Ward indicated the class material is quite challenging. Class topics include a history of attitudes toward the retarded; causes and types of retardation; behavior modification and training of the retarded; teaching methods in the area of self-help and legal rights for the retarded. 
Other classes will be given by persons from the University and local community with experience in mental retardation. Assigned readings related to the training methods will be availabe in the ND Bookstore. 
Sixteen Notre Dame students are

"If they sit on the sidelines during this one we will have to invent a new word for the condition and for the generation that is in­finitely beyond alienation," Fr. Drinan added. 
Indiana Representative John Brademas replied with a letter stating: "President Nixon's ac­tions recently have in my view, precipitated a Constitutional crisis of almost unparalleled severeity in the history of this country." 
Brademas' letter explained two House Resolutions Brademas has co-sponsored dealing with the issues covered by Fr. Burrell's 
natural consequence of it," said Clint Gibler, an ND electrical engineering major and current Manasa chairman. 
Several students took the course because it offered them an op­portunity to get practical ex­perience in the field of psychology. "I wanted more than theory," said Robert Farrell, a junior psychology major. "In the course we use behavior modification techniques." 
Lee Handwerker, another psychology major, also wanted 
experience in working with retarded children. "I work with normal children from good backgrounds in a summer camp," said Handwerker. "I wanted to see what the transition would be like from working with normal children to working with retarded children." 
Alex alabrese, ND junior and psychology major, said the class offered training that enabled him to become a more effective volunteer. 
The students' volunteer work is supervised by Psychology Department faculty and Center staff. This volunteer work has been very successful in several cases. Two students joined staff members to develop a training method to teach one child to walk. 
Another child who threw toys away was trained to play with them correctly. Other children are being taught to swim in the Ceo­ter's pool, dress themselves, and eat correctly. 
"The big problem is you just letter. 

One resolution calling for the Judiciary Committee to in­vestigate the official conduct of the President was adopted last week and is expected to be enacted soon, according to a Brademas spokesman. 
"Please be assured that in the coming months, I will have as my first priority Congressional action to re-establish the rule of law in our land for all citizens, including high public officials," Brademas' letter concluded.

l''r. Burrell, in response to the two letters, clarified that "when people say 'Impeach the President', they could mean they feel him to be guilty, but the thrust is to initiate impeachment proceedings." 
"Certainly one must agree with George McGovern, who did not need to argue the point: if anyone who has done or allowed to be done the sorts of things Nixon has is not subject to impeachment proceedings, who is?" Fr. Burrell said.

The CCE Rally 
At 4:30 tomorrow, the SLC will meet in a very important meeting. Fr. James Burtchaell will meet with the SLC and all interested students to discuss the new academic calendar. Student response to this invitation hopefully will be over­whelming. If it is, perhaps it can change the Provost's mind. 
Burtchaell has downplayed the results of a survey taken by the Hall President's Council saying that this kind of response is merely manufactured by the an­nouncement of a new calendar. 
Hopefully, a massive outpouring of in­terested students can convince the Provost that the results were not merely the result of disgust produced by the calendar's release, but actual true opinions held by the students of Notre Dame. 
Show up at the CCE Thursday and voice your opinion. Despite the apparent firmness of the Provost not to change the calendar, perhaps a massive show of strength can prove effective.

For Convenience's Sake 
With the unveiling of the Nixon ad­ministration's plans for fighting the fuel crisis comes a lot of sacrifices on the part of American citizens. We face the possibility of rationed gas in our cars, limited speeds on our highways and lower temperatures in our homes. 
Pragmatically speaking, that's pretty much to ask without some complaints. 
But for the most part, the complaints will be petty. Nearly everybody will consider himself important enough for the maximum fuel ration when that comes about, and will probably start to rattle like the proverbial empty barrel 
when he doesn't get his gallons. 
Despite these complaints, however, most Americans. will go along with the sacrifice. Granted, they won't have much choice in the matter, but when it comes down to it, the only thing they'll sacrifice will be convenience, a commodity eminently expendible. 
But convenience means a lot to Americans, and if that will be their sacrifice, the last thing they'll stand for is seeing someone else getting the con­venience they don't have. And this is the danger the Nixon administration faces now. 
In a copyrighted story Tuesday in The Dallas Morning News, The News' energy editor John Cranfill reported that the Defense Department is taking fuel from the American civilian market to fill the need created by the recent Arab em­bargo. Twenty-two oil companies in the United States were recently ordered to send enough petroleum products to the Defense Department to fulfill December needs, Cranfill's story said, quoting an unidentified Defense Department source. 
The authority for this order apparently comes from a 1950 act that President Nixon quietly reactivated November 1.

The act, called the Defense Production Act, was originally intended to insure military supplies during the Korean War. It seems incredibly convenient that the 
president can activate such an act 
assuring his military strength around the 
world before he has to tell Americans 
that they have to tighten their belts. It 
also seems rather curious that while 
American citizens will have to sacrifice 
their convenience, the military will not. 
The Nixon administration talks of 
banning Christmas decorations that use 
up power, lowering thermostats six 
degrees, turning off lights and travelling 
less. But talk of cutting military budgets, 
conserving military fuel and lowering 
military thermostats is scarce. Im­
plications of military convenience is 
plentiful. 
So what it boils down to is convenience and priorities. The convenience of the American citizen is placed at a low priority: there isn't enough fuel to go around, so the citizen does without. The convenience of the military, on the other hand, seems to rank higher on ad­ministration priority sheets: there isn't enough to go around, so it is taken from another source. 
This system of priorities is far from laudable, especially considering the stance of the Nixon administration in the eyes of the American public. Either a justification of such a move on the part of the Defense Department or a complete reordering of priorities is sadly needed here, if for no other reason than the convenience of the administration's credibility. "Join the army and stay warm" is not as funny as it sounds.

Remember 

It was extremely moving to watch the evening news this past Thanksgiving night. To watch the tow-headed children and sombre ladies and the proud gentleman stand before the flickering flame. It was extremely moving. 
To remember. 

To drift back past what seems an instant, a decade, to a cloudy day in a sixth-grade classroom when a normally icy principal's voice announced in quivering disbelief that our President had been shot. 
And moments later, that our President had died. To remember. To allow one's heart to shed the years of hardening that frustration 

and war and poverty and sickening political behavior has helped to mold, and to remember that sick feeling of guilt, of remorse, of bat­tered conscience that pervaded that sixth grade classroom. 
And which pervaded that three story row house we called home. And which blanketed the senseless football games that we played on the day off from school. The day we were given in order that we might honor and mourn and just plain realize. 
That we might remember. 

And Thursday night, watching the silent scene at the foot of John Kennedy's grave in the Arlington National Cemetary, the feeling returned. 
Remember. 

Remember a hot summer day not so many years ago when a horrified nation watched streams of determined, excited, freedom­happy black people fill the streets of Washington and spend an entire day singing, praying and telling America that the time for equality had arrived and would no longer be delayed. 
Remember the sweat-covered face of that revered Southern minister as his voice sang of the dream and the vision and the togetherness that would one day fill his beloved America. And remember the happy voices of those close to the microphone as their joy echoed his words and made them strong. 
And remember America as it cursed the black invasion and the sepseless gathering at the foot of Lincoln and the thought that blacks and whites could ever achieve more than co-existence. 
But remember also the televisions as they burned throughout the day, and cursing America as it watched the black invasion with anxious eyes, and the sighs of disbelief when the day ended and there had been no violence because that southern minister had helped his people say as they had never before said, that they wanted to be recognized and respected. 
And then remember again. 

Remember an April night when the feeling returned. When that television program millions of Americans were watching was in­terrupted and the horror .of a hotel balcony in Nashville, Tennessee became America's second nightmare in less than a decade. 
And remember that feeling. That feeling of remorse, of guilt, of battered conscience. That feeling that even the hatred of utter disagreement could not suppress. The feeling that only a man who had somehow risen above the rest of struggling humanity could elicit. 
Remember. 

Remember a night in late spring when a hot political campaign was becoming more and more heated and the nation went to sleep ex­pecting to rise the next morning and find who California's Democrats wanted as their representative in the approaching presidential election. 
And remember the feeling when instead of awakening to find a board showing voting statistics, America tuned in her televisions to the chaotic scene in the moppy-haired victor's headquarters. To the scene of screaming, and shoving, and eventual death. 
And then remember another endless trail of funeral processions, and the Battle Hymn, and the eternal rail trek to Union Station in Washington. And remember the people. The Americans. We who lined the streets of New York, the railroad tracks of the east coast the sidewalks of Washington, the cemetary of Arlington. We Ameri~ans with the tears in our eyes, with the pains in our hearts. 
Remember and ask why. Why the feeling of guilt? Why the feeling of remorse? Why the battered conscience? And what was it about these men that elicited these feelings that America has ceased to / experience? 
. Wasn't there something in John and Martin and Bobby that was different? Certainly no one would claim that while they lived they !llanaged to consolidate An1erica into one happy community believing m the same methods of accomplishing her dreams. Certainly no one would claim that there were not times when it was certainly thought that history would fail to shine favorably on these men. 
Yet we felt. They touched us. We disagreed with them, we thought them crazy in their idealism, but they touched us. Because somehow, they rose above. 
And we no longer are led by men who have risen above. 

We are no longer a nation behind a man, looking up to a man, struggling with a man. Instead we have taken a stand apart, and we follow when we feel him to be right, but only following a severe judgment on our parts that he is indeed right. And that ability to set ourselves apart is a result of his failure to rise above. We treat him as one of us, as one we are wary of trusting. 
He does not touch us. 

He pleads for our self-sacrifice in this time of energy crisis, and we ask when he has sacrificed of himself. He speaks of honorable stands, and we question when he has exhibited honor. He claims to be asking of us no more than he asks of himself, and that is his problem. We do 
, not believe him. He has not risen above. Perhaps An1erica could be justified following the pain of watching 
those whom she trusted being killed, if she decided to never again follow and allow herself to be touched by a man whose time with her is so fleeting, but that is not the case. 
She is without, we are without, a man who has risen above us, a man in whom we can carry a vision, a many by whom we can be led. Whether or not he is guilty of that which so many accuse him, he is nevertheless undeserving and incapable of sustaining the hopes and dreams of this people. 
Remember, America, when men rose above. Remember how they touched us. Remember how it hurt when they were suddenly gone. But be not satisfied with memories, for they are useless in the ab­

sence of dreams. Let us pray for the day when men will again rise above, and touch us, and lead us. Remember. And pray.

Over 200 people participated in 
this year's sale of the cards, which 
proved twice as successful as last

"We'd especially like to thank all the students and faculty who · bought and sold the cards as well as ihe Campus Press, The Ob­server, and the Student Govern­

He then passed on an anecdote. "The members of the Chicago Seven had a saying," he said, "because we all came from dif­ferent backgrounds and were all of different persuasions even though we held common beliefs. We used . to say 'Unity in Diversity'. This is· what we should all strive for: Solidarity in Mutual Respect and Struggle." 
Hayden blamed the media for

the polls showed that most people would rather watch Watergate than the soap operas." 
In a question and answer session following the speech, Hayden attributed nmch of the energy shortage to a collaboration of the oil companies, the Government, and the military. "Saying that we have a shortage because a housewife is burning the lights for too long is handling this only marginally," he said. "What we need to do is deal with the military, which is aln1ost totally based on oil."

Search on for strangler's killer 
WALPOLE, Mass. (UPI) ­Albert DeSalvo would have been tried for one of the Boston stranglings if he hadn't been slain Sunday at Walpole State Prison, his attorney said Tuesday. 
Lawyer Pat J. Piscitelli of Brockton said DeSalvo would have been tried in Middlesex Superior Court next spring for the slaying of Beverly Samans, 23, of Cambridge. Her murder was one of 13 generally attributed to the Boston Stran­
gler  between  June,  1962  and  
January, 1964.  
Meanwhile,  the  search  for  

DeSalvo's killer continued Tues­day at the prison. Inmates have been locked in their cells and strip-searched, according to a spokesman for the corrections department. 
DeSalvo, 42, was stabbed 16 times, apparently with a surgical instrument. He had been dead about 10 hours when his body was found Monday morning. 
In an interview with the Brockton Enterprise, Piscitelli said, "Albert was prepared to confess to all of the Boston stranglings. He would only have been tried for the one (Samans) but testimony would have been introduced on the others." 
DeSalvo had admitted he was responsible for the murders, then repudiated those admis­sions. While he was never tried on the murder charges, the onetime boxer and handyman was convicted of unrelated

IRA blockades roads with

By FRANK JQHNSTON 

BELFAST (UP I) -Irish Republican Army (IRA) gun­men hijacked dozens of buses, trucks and cars Tuesday night and turned them into potential­ly bomb-laden barriers blocking more than 30 main roads across Northern Ireland. 
Bombs in two hijacked vehicles exploded at Coagh, 40 miles northwest of Belfast, and Downpatrick, 25 miles south­west of the capital. Neither blast caused casualties, an army spokesman said. 
Roadblocks of hijacked vehi­cles sealed off Lurgan, 20 miles southwest of Belfast, almost isolated Strabane on the Irish 
barricades 
Republic border, and blocked 
roads  between  Belfast  and  
Dublin and Londonderry.  
British  officers  called  the  

action a "demonstration of strength by the IRA." They said it was an escalation of the IRA campaign to destroy Northern Ireland's new Protest­ant-Roman Catholic coalition government. 
Gunmen who riddled a Catholic mill worker's car with bullets may have killed him by mistake, police said.

South Viet forces continue lighting in Phnom Penh 
By ARTHUR HIGBEE 

PHNOM PENH (UPI) Government forces trying to reopen Phnom Penh's land link to its only deepwater seaport came under a rebel mortar barrage Tuesday 25 miles from the capital, field reporters said. 
Five civilians and two sol­diers were wounded in two barrages totaling 20 rounds of 82mm mortar fire along both sides of Kompong Speu, mili­tary sources said. 
The insurgents were appar­ently attempting to outflank government troops trying to reopen Highway 4, the road from Phnom Penh to the port of Kompong Som. 
The highway has been cut since Nov. 11 near Mohasaingn, 11 miles farther southwest from Kompong Speu. 
In South Vietnam, Communist gunners stepped up their shelling of the defense lines around Hue, 400 miles north of Saigon, Tuesday and fired mortars at the district capital of Khiem Hanh, 40 miles northwest of Saigon, govern­ment spokesmen said. 
Viet Cong peace negotiators boycotted a scheduled meeting with South Vietnamese officers to protest government bombing raids on Communist-held terri­tory 70 miles north of Saigon last week. 
In other Cambodian battle­field action, Communist forces fired two Soviet-built rockets at Phnom Penh's Pochentong air­port at dawn, but they exploded harmlessly in rice fields half a mile from the end of the airport's lone runway, military spokesmen said. 
Pochentong and the Mekong 

River are  the  only  two  supply
