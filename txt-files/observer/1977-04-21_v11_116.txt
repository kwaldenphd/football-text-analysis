Blacks protest 'racist ' attitudes 
by Mike Lewis Staff Reporter and Patrick Cole Special Projects Editor 

Concerned black student sent letters yesterday to members of the. Notre Dame faculty and admini­stration complaining of "racist" attitudes and actions. 
Undertrepresentation of· black students and a lack of commitment to affirmative action prqgrams are the groups primary concerns.. They have charged that Notre Dame Is SO percent behind on affirmativ.e ac-. tion programs and "that less than · 
2.S percent of Notre DaJile's total . enrollment is black. · 
Other grievances cited by the concerned black students are inad­equate coverage . of the Black Cultural Arts Festival in the year­book, discriminatory acts against the Notre Dame Gospel Choir and violation of the cheerleading consti­tution during cheerleader tryouts. 
The group also questioned the motives and attitudes behind the suggestion to move the site of the Black Cultural Arts Center picnic and the assignment to a remote end · of the North Dining Hall for all but one of the minority students serv­ing for the Campaign for Notre Dame kick-off dinner. 
The students have demanded that University President Fr. Theo­dore Hesburgh meet with them to discuss these complaints. 
Hesburgh received the letters late yesterday afternoon. Before he was able to review all the com­plaints he stated, "If the students have legitimate complaints there should be something done about it." 
He also said that he had dealt with the complaints of the Gospel Choir, and that "the Choir will have a piano and a place to practice." 
Concerning reports of discrim­ination at the fund-raising dinner, Director of Food Services Edmund Price said, ''To some extent I think there is a misconception about what's going on. I've done some checking up on the complaints, and I don't know of any discrim­ination." 
Price also said that he had checked with the student co-ordin­ator who had made the assign­ments, and was assured that discrimination ", hadn't even entered his mind." 
"We take these things seriously because we employ many minority students. We strongly feel that we don't discriminate, and we won't tolerate any discriminatory ac­tions," Price added. 
William Cerney, chairman of the music department, voiced his dis­may about the "unfortunate" cir­cumstances surrounding the Gos­pel Choir. "I hope the situation will quickly come to a good solution and I think Fr. Hesburgh will address himself to the problem," he said. 
Br. John Benesh, student acti­vities director, stressed the positive action taken to make the cheerlead­ing trials fair. "After the difficulty we had in last year's trials we tried to bend over backwards to assure fair tryouts this year," he stated. Benesh also noted, "In my opinion the judging was done solely on ability." 
Assistant Director of Student Activities John Reid could not be reached for comment. 
Dean of Students James Roemer denied the charges made by the concerned black students that he ordered the site of the picnic be changed for the sake of the Board of Trustees. He suggested that "Holy Cross was the best place to have the picnic." . 
Roemer told The Observer last night that a student requested the picnic last Thursday afternoon at 4:~S p.m. between the towers, Grace and Flanner Halls--not on Wednesday· acording to the letter. Once the request was expressed in writing on Friday, Roemer told that he suggested the picnic be held by the baseball diamond near Holy Cross Hall. · 
"I think the Holy Cross location is a better spot," Roemer said, "It's next to the.lake, next to the Grotto, 'it has a backstop so the students could play basebalL I was just using my own background and experience. · 
Next, the picnic site of Holy 
·Cross had to be appr<,>Ved by Fr. George Wiskirchen, rector of Holy Cross: According to Roemer, Wis­kirchen said the picnic could be held there and that it "was no problem." 
''There was no sign of disagree­ment between us about the Holy Cross site," Roemer stated. "I thought that my help in making all the arrangements would make the students happy. Normally, I don't make th~ phone calls. But I called Wiskirchen. It was a complete surprise to me that the students complained. · 
Roemer further commented on the question of the University trying to prevent black students from "being visible" on campus. 
. "was I thinking of this decision in the context ofthe Board of Trustees meeting?" Roemer asked. "It is ridiculous to say we don't want black students to be where they are not visible. They're just as visible in the heart of campus. It's just my 
· inclination to say Holy Cross is the best place to have a picnic. Aesthetically, you couldn't find a better place on campus." 
Never has anyone asked for formal apprQval to have a picnic in 
· the Grace and Flanner area, Roem­er said. In Feb. 1976, The Black Cultural Arts Center sponsored a picnic in the vicinity of the towers. But Roemer said that picninc was never approved by him. He said when the students asked for the picnic, Assistant Director of Stu­dent Activities Reid made the arrangements. 
"He didn't say you have to go to the dean for approval,'' Roemer said. ''But I wasn't upset about it.''

'A thankless job' 

Carter: tax oU, big cars 
WASBINGTON (AP) ~ Presi­
dent Carter asked Congress 

last night to approve a national 
energy policy that raises prices . and taxes for energy and automo­biles to encourage conservation of 
vanishing resources. 

Carter told .the senators and 
congressmen, already divided by 
allegiance to different regions and 
interests, that he has learned why a 
comprehensive energy policy has 
not already been developed. 

"It is a thankless job," Carter 
said, "but it is our job, and I 
believe we have a fair, well-balan­
ced and effective plan to present to 
you." 

He urged enactment of legisla­
tion that WOlJid tax gas-guzzling 
autos anywhere from $449 for 1978 
low-mileage models up to $2,488 
for 198S. 

And he asked the lawmakers to 
approve a plan that would add 
about 7 cents a gallon to the cost of 
gasoline, fuel oil and other petrole­
um products by 1980 through a 
series of taxes on crude oil. 
Carter's program threatened fur­

ther gasoline taxes starting at S 
cents a gallon in 1979 and rising as 
high as SO cents a gallon if U.S. 

gasoline consumption is not held down. 
Carter emphasized that fairness was one of his chief aims and that "the energy industry should not reap large unearned profits" from the nation's energy crisis. 
"None of our people must make an unfair sacrifice. None should reap an unfair benefit,'' Carter said. 
He urged that "individual ac­counting be required from energy companies for production, refining, distribution and marketing--separj­ately for domestic and foreign operations. 
Carter said his program also would seek to soften its own impact on particular segments of the public. 
For example, he proposed using part of the Highway Trust Fund to compensate states for the revenue they will lose as declining gasoline consumption cuts into state gaso­line tax income. 
Carter's policies were aimed primarily at saving energy and developing the use of coal, nuclear power and solar energy. 
"We can never increase our production of oil and natural gas by enough to meet our demand," he said, in effect announcing the

death notice of a centmy of petroleum-fueled growth. Earlier, a top-ranking Carter 

. aide said the average American's standard of living would not ·be lowered by the President's energy · package. 
The aide, who asked that he not be identified, told a standing-room audience of reporters that house-. holders who heat with fuel. oil would recieve direct rebate!>' of their extra fuel costs. · 
The rest of the revenues would be returned to the public largely through income tax credits. 
Carter's program offered no major concessions to the energy industries, which have been pres­sing for removal of federal price controls on oil and natural gas and the easing of clean air regulations that apply to the burning of coal. 
The officail said the administra­tion will not back off the clean air effort and said· the coal industry should face up to the technical problems. 
As for seeking higher profits as an incentive to production, the official said the present world oil price, about $13 per barrel,' is a "generous" incentive and any­thing higher might simply be windfall profits. 
Carter's program was already conroversial but the official expres­sed hope that the nation would take its energy problems seriously and adopt such nationai policies quick­ly. 

A White House statement said Carter's energy package would add about four-tenths of one per cent ot the annual inflation rate through · 1985 but would have "generally positive impacts on the economy." The inflation rate now is about 6 per cent a year. 
A White House "fact sheet" on these proposals said Carter's plan could save some 4.6 million barrels of oil daily by 1985, reducing oil imports to some 7 million barrels per day. This would be 40 per cent below the otherwise projected im­'port levels.

Chicagosuburbs to secede? 
CIDCAGO AP  Some of the wealthiest suburbs of Chic~o are mounting a campaign to split away from Cook County, which they say: collects their taxes, but denies them proper representation. 
Leaders of the sucessionist movement say the county, the nation's second most populous, is dominated by Chicago, the coun­try's second largest city, and that suburban residents are paying high tax bills largely to support city. services. 
To counter this, six townships· containing more than a dozen of· Chicago's fastest-growing subur­ban communities, have begun planning a new county, something that hasn't been done in Ulinois since 1959. 
The county. to be called Lincoln 
would cut off what is now the . northwest corner of Cook County, Lincoln would be the state's fourth largest county with an estimated 
350,000 residentS. 

State Sen. David Regner, a suburban Republican, has spon­sored legislation that would make 
secession 1 easier. He says a survey he conducted among 2,000 of his constituents showed 69 percent in favor of withdrawal, 17 percent opposed an 14 percent with no opinion. 
acting director. "Starting a county from scratch like that. It's just an enormous undertaking." 
Before World War II, the north­west suburbs consisted mainly of vegetable farms. Since then, they have experienced dramatic growth, absorbing an· influx of relatively affluent white collar workers. 
Arlington Heights, for instance, grew from 8,768 residents in 1950 to 64,884 in 1970. Its median family income in 1974 was $24,000 compared with a median of $12,400 in the city. 
Currently suburbs account for almost half of Cook County's total $23.9 billion assessed valuation. They accounted for only a third of the county's total worth a decade ago. 
"I think we would be better served, with a more modern ap­proach to government, if we created our own county unit," said Jones. 
He said the present county board structure, with 10 Chicago mem­hers and six suburban representa­tives, gives the suburban interests short shrift. 
Although the majority of subur­ban residents are Republicans, "you have the Democratic machine of Chicago controlling the su­burbs," Jones said. "It's one-

"Before I'd be out front, J'd want a thoughtful, in-depth analysis of what would result," Ryan said. "What's good at one time may not be good for all times.'' 
Jones said the biggest obstacle to secession is the stringent re­quirements of state law. 
The law currently requires the signatures of at least half the registered voters in the area to place the question of secession on the ballot in the 1978 general election, the earliest it could be done. 
Then a majority of all persons voting in the election -not just a majority of those voting on the secession issue -is required for approval. This means someone-­who fails to vote either war on the issue effectively casts..a "no" vote.

shows improving economy 
WASHINGTON AP  The na­tion's Gross National Product in­creased at an annual rate of 5.2 percent in the first quarter of 1977, the largest gain in a year and a signal of an improving economy, the government announced yesterday. 
The GNP indicator, which mea­sures the market value of the goods and services produced in the country, might have been bigger still except for the severe winter weather, the Commerce Depart­ment's Bureau of Economic Analy­sis said. 
"The extremely cold ·weather in January and February reduced the increase in real output and final 
sales and boosted prices in the first quarter. The extremely cold wea­ther probably reduced the increase in real putput by 1.5 percentage points at an annual rate . . . the 
bureau said. The rate of inflation was put at 5.8 percent, the same as in the previous quarter. 
The ftrst quarter increase was the highest since a rise of 9.2 percent registered in the first quarter of 1976. 
that evolved from the COUP report are the basis for The Campaign for Notre Dame. 
Although Notre Dame could not have the "best of both worlds," Hesburgh believed it must plan to achieve what is the best in its present world. He therefore direc­ted COUP to ''study the present and, especially, the future of Notre Dame in an effort to determine what are the most important and ;ndespensible elements of our total mission, the most essential as 
, contrasted with that which mightIhave seemed desirable under other circumstances." 
The committee initially consisted of 12 members. However, two additional members joined the committee March 28, 1973 at the committee's mandate. The mem­bership of the committee was suggested to Hesburgh by the Steering Committee of the Aca­demic Council. 
The COUP members included Rev. James T. Burtchaell, Univer­sity pmvost and chairman of COUP; Rev. Ernan McMullin, pro­fessor f){ philosophy and COUP secretary; Howard Bathon, then senior Arts and Letters and Chem­ical Engineering major; Rev. David Burrell, associate professor of the­oJgy and philosophy; Dr. James Daschbach, associate professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engin­eering; Dr. James Frick, vice presidet,t for public relations and development; Rev. James Flan­igan, associate vice president for Studen Affairs; Dr. Yusaku Fur­uhashi, professor of marketing manag{ment; Dr. Robert Gordon, vice president for Advanced Stu­dies; Sr. Madonna Kolbenschlag, assistant professor of American Studies; Dr. 0.

was up $34.8 billion over the fourth quarter compared to a $33.5 billion increase between the third and fourth quarters of 1976. 
Spending on motor vehicles showed a more than 10-fold in­crease over the increase recorded in the fourth quarter. Such spending rose Sl billion in the fourth quarter and an additional $10.5 billion in the first three months of 1977. 
The increase in purchases of durable goods was up more than 250 percent, or $11.4 billion over the $4.4 billion increase during the previous quarter. 
The indicators showed the pur­chases of nondurable goods in­creased S7. 7 billion, down from the 
rise of $14.2 billion in the previous three months. 
The bureau said the slowdown in the increase in purchases of non-durables was mainly in clothing and gasoline, following very large increases for these categories in the fourth quarter of 1976. 
While the disposable income of Americans increased $29 billion, they were spending more . $35.2 billion -the figures showed. as a result personal savings declined $6 billion with the savings rate drop­ping from 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter to 5 percent for the first

The purpose of the specific buildings were inves­tigated to see whether or not they were being fulfilled. Burrell chaired the task force on enroll­ment.

COUP submitted its first report to the Board of Trustees in Dec. 1973. After two years of intensive analysis and evaluation, it was approved by the board. The report was then designated as the specific guide to University development. 
According to Dr. James Frick, vice president of public relations and development, "The Campaign for Notre Dame is nothing more than the implementation of the COUP report findings."

Urban renewal and the future 
South Bend is not dead 
by Marian Ulicny Senior Staff Reporter 

"Downtown South Bend is prob­ably in a better position to undergo a real renaissance than most com­parable areas in the country," according to the 1975 South Bend Economic Report. 
The report attributes the thrust for South Bend's future develop­ment to "an increasing awareness on the part of most citizens that the (South Bend) core is the economic heart .of the Michiana region, and that it must not be allowed to deteriorate or disappear." 
Development of the downtown area will focus on both retailing and

Downtown development plans enhance South Bend future 
by Karen lllnkH 

Memht·rs of the Northeast Nl"i,.:hhorhood Council met last Wt·dntsday with off-campus com­missioner Joe Ungashil-k, Dean of Studt·nts JamesRoemer. the South lknd Board of Public Safety, and lontl h11r owners to present a .111-day short-term proposal as a solution to the noise, litter, and nuisllnt·e problems in the Corby-Eddy tavern area. 
Jt;hn Roos, a government pro-tt.ssor at Notre Dame and a spokesman for the Northeast Neighborhood Council explained that his interest in the problem is not strictly a personal one. He views the impact of the litter and noise in the "older inner-city neighborhood" as being crucial. 
The trend in the past few years has been to flee to the suburbs abandoning the inner city to escape the rampant crime rate and deter­iorating neighborhoods. "The. problem with the cities today is that the affluent and middle-income families are moving out of the cities and into the suburbs," Roos ex­plained. "The people remaining in the neighborhood are usually the powerless: the elderly living alone, fixed income families who are tt·onomit-ally fragile. and young families." 
In an effort to preserve the ntighborhood from falling into the hands of "slum landlords", Roos und other residents. remain for stx·iul justke reasons. "When thin~s happen that do not comply with tht.· lifestylt.-of the neighbor­htll.ld," Roos said. "the families with tht rtsourtts move to the suburbs wht.n taxes are lower, the sdttll.lls urt btttt·r. and the neigh­btlriwods quit·ter." 
Tht problem in the Corby-Eddy an·a. as viewtd bv members of the "''urwil. is" tremendous amounr of rwist and litter from students frt·quenting the four taverns within tlw area. Trash, beer bottles, and plastic ,·ups are left in the area and ar,· rarely deaned up by anyone. Bccaust of the litter the residents ,,f the urea have presented the 
'students and bar owners with a proposal.
.J,w lln~ashil'k. off-campus com­missitmtr.stated that the proposal inn1ln·s both a strong committ­
nwnt and t'l.lOperation from stu­'knts. .·Bar ,,wners han· been asked to ,·kan up the.· area two biOt·ks on tither side of their establishment.·· l;ngashick explained. "The North-
tast Neighborhood Council has submitted names of youths from the area who will clean the sur­
roundings by S p.m.. the following evtning." 
Each tavern owner has agreed to make a weekly contribution to subsidize the dean-up. Corby's and Bridget McGuire's will render SlO each week. The library and Nickie's SIS. 
Aqo~h~r aspect of the proposal is 
no live entertainment or expand their building in any way without prior consultation and agreement from the northeast residents. Residents have requested bar own­ers to usc reusable containers instead of plastic cups to prevent litter caused by students taking cups out of the buildin~s. Accord­ing to a source wishing to remain unidentified, the majority of plastic cups found this past weekend were from the Senior Bar. Many feel the Senior Bar could take great strides in aiding the problem by serving liquor in reusable bottles and glasses. Residents are presently . looking into the possibility of 
instating a city ordinance that would prohibit anyone from leaving a bar with an open container. 
Also proposed are the distribu­tion of leaflets, the posting of signs around the area, the placing of trash cans on sidewalks, and foot patrolmen to oversee the sur­roundings. 
''The Northeast Neighborhood residents arc: serious, They are making a plea to the students.'' Ungashick stated. "It's not that students are deliberately making trouble. They are unacquainted with the problem. The tesidents are asking students to become more sensitive to their needs. The neighborhood is . full of elderly people and young children." 
He explained the northeast area 
1 is very much aware of the services the University provides for the community. Members realize thtre are ·only a small majority of students causing the problem. 
"The students are a responsible group and will work together and cooperate so that everything will work out as planned." he said. "The meeting held last week was constructive: progress was made. We have faith in everyone and w~uld like to get this ~II behind us." 
Owners of the four bars in question emphatically voiced their desire to cooperate with area resi­dents. 
Vince lynch. assistant manager of Corby's stated the meeting was "verv constructive". "Corbv's is 
in agreement with the proposal," · he said. "We plan to have someone standing by the door to see that no one leaves with open. containers." The new managers have not bought reusable co"ntain­. ers in the past due to breakage in the bar and on the streets. Presently, they are using plastic

Theresa Bauer, manager of Brid­

she was pleased with the progress 
being made. "We're working 
together to solve this problem." 
Bridget's has agreed to try using 
glasses and bottles. "We'll try it 
now and see what happens." 
Bauer also observed that part of the 
lifler and noise problem may be 
attributed to off-campus parties as 
well as the taverns. 

Rick Kansor, manager of the 
library is also in agreement with 
the proposal and is satisfied with 
the progress being made. 

The members of the council, 
representatives of the university, 
and bar owners are working to­
gether to alleviate the disturbances 
being caused in the neighborhoods 
and are asking students to become 
more sensitive to their needs. 

Morris Inn celebrates 25th 
Today marks the 25th anniver­sary of the Morris Inn. The 91-room hotel which also contains private and public dining facilities, was built in 1952 with a 51-million gift from the late Ernest M..and Ella L. Morris. South Bend phtlan­thropists. Renovations were com­pleted in 1962 and 1972. 
Guests of the hotel have included religious and political leaders such as Paul VI and Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as many entertainment stars. 
The Morris family. benefactors of the University on several occa­sions and prominent in lay leader­ship roles. donated the 1951 _gift in appreciation for the educaho~ ?f Jaw received by the elder Morrts tn the early par.t of the century. An orphan. without funds, and a member of the Presbyterian faith, Morris appealed to the late Rev. John W. Cavanaugh. C.S.C .. Uni­versity president and was accepted for studies. 
The head chef at the inn. 
Theodore Tarnowski, of 814 N. 
Huev St., South Bend. is also 
celebrating a 25th anniversary with 
the hotel. John Rash. and assistant 
Jerry Williams. manage the inn. 


Library adds XLR collection 

An "Extra leisure Reading" (XlR)collection is being developed on a trial basis at Memorial 
library. according to Brother Frank Crury. C.S.C., Acting Head of the College library. The new collection, located in the College library, contains fiction. non-fiction paperback and hard­bound books. All XlR books have been dona~ed, processed by the College library staff, and circulate a~ any other book. Donations are welcome. and can be dropped off at th.e College Library desk or in room 207.

Bend. 

Block Six, an area located along 
the west side of the St. Joseph 
River, was purchased by the South 
Bend Downtown Redevelopment 
Commission. The commission 
used Federal matching grants to 
build the Century Center and the 
Post Office in this vicinity. 
Ramada Inn and the Whitcomb­
Keller building are also located on 
Block Six. "We tried to sandwich 
the land in between these build­
ing~, so, hopefully, its value will 
increase," Brammer explained. 
A high-rise for the elderly with 
approximately 300 units will be 
constructed next spring, Brammer 
stated. This project will qualify as 
a subsidy for local grant-in-aid. 
"We'll receive credit for all cons­
truction to put into Federal match­, ing funds elsewhere," he added. ! Mid-Way Moter Inn will also be 
added next spring in the Block Six 
area for the Century Center busi­
ness. It will include a restaurant. 
''Most of our plans in the city 
rely on the hope that renewal will 
spread to the area adjacent to the 
river on the other side," Brammer 
stated. "Any additional construc­
tion helps increase the tax base and 
brings revenues into the city." 

According to Brammer, down­
town development will be "solidly 
established" by 1985 to 1987 with 
the necessary financing. "City 
financing is definitely a city con­
cern," he stated. "To rebuild the 
downtown is a job for South Bend, 
not so much for Washington." 

Downtown development projects 
used federal funds only in building 
River Bend Plaza, the pedestrian 
mall, and in residential project 
rehabilitation, Brammer stated. 
"South Bend is lucky becaus~ it 
is able to provide its own finan­
ces," he continued. "The future 
looks good from the mere stand­
point that downtown is by no 
means a dead, huge, atrocious 
problem without the financial re­
sources to solve it." 

. To supplement municipal funds, 
tile Chamber of Commerce and 
private interest groups are working 
to attract businessmen and comm­
ercial concerns to the downtown 
district. 

One such interest group is South 
Bend 2000. Comprised of spokes­
men from downtown financial insti­
tutions, it serves as sounding board 
which the Mayor and City council 
use for renewal suggestions. 
According to Lex Wilkinson, chair­
man of the group, "South Bend 
2000 is trying to provide a better 
retailing climate downtown." The 
group is measuring the viable 
interest in a downtown retail 
caenter by working with develo­pers, city administrators and pri­vate business. 
The group's major aim is to attract business interests to the South Bend area. The Key 
promotional device is th~ "City In A 
1 Box" advertising campaign. Not­ices have been placed in national magazines, particularly business-­oriented publications such as The Wall Street Journal. Local adverti­
' sing has been directed throughout the Chicago and Michiana regions. 

"City In A Box" literature emphasizes four drawing points of South Bend. "Spaces To Sprout In'' provides descriptions of the city's office space. "Resources To Rely On" notes the availability of personnel and data processing. "Facilities To Accommodate" lists the city's service institutions, inclu­ding schools and hospitals.

Many attempt to preserve river city~s heritage 
by Karen Hinks 

Edito;:'s Note: This is the first in a 3 part series describing the efforts to preserve the historical heritage of South Bend. 
South Bend Indiana, a moder­
ately large mid-western town, rare­
ly sparks the imagination in terms 
of historical heritage. Most people 
are aware of the Co·mcil Oak tree, 
the portage across :he St. Joseph 
river and the Indians. But little 
atte·.tion is given to an important 
era in the history of the community 
durhg the 1800's. 
South Bend was an industrial city 
back in the nineteenth century. 
Such men as Clement ;,nd Peter 
Studebaker and James and Joseph 
Oliver contributed greaily to the 
growing prosperity of the commu­
nitv. What these brothers. their 
families and many others of that 
generation left to this community is 
worth careful consideration. 
Today, the face of the city is 
changing. People are fleeing to the 
subur_bs and abandoning the inner 
city to escape the rampid crime rate 
and deteriorating neighborhoods. 
Within the past ten or fifteen years, 
urban renewal has taken place in 
the downtown area. Under the 
guise of "progress" many valuable 
and sound structures have been 
demolished to make way for four­
teen-story modern super-struc­
tures. Many people of the commu­
nity have completely lost the sense 
of their heritage. 
In an effort to preserve the 
historic value of the city and to 
restore and save the inner-city 
neighborhoods, a group of con­
cerr "!d citizens have formed an 
Historic Preservation Commission. 
Their intention is to encc urage and 
educate the community .in hopes 
that an awareness of the value of 
historic preservation anc n~ighbor­
hood restoration is recognized. 
Historic preservation is defined 
in the city ordinance 5565-73 as 
"the research, protection. main­
tenance, restoration, rehabil­
itation. reconstruction, or devel­
opment of historic landmarks'' and 
pertains particularly to the preser­
vation of the exterior physical 
features only. The commission is a 
relatively new group. 
Nine members compose the South Bend and St. Joseph County Historic Preservation Commission. The city council. county council, the countv commissioners and the mayor appoint two members each. The ninth member is appointed by other commission members and is to be an architectural historian as specified in the city ordinance. All members serve without pay. 
~ ne commission has apart-time consultant who does research, pre­parrs the commission's minutes and manages the office. 
The commission was established for several reasons, according to Rita Kopczski, a member of the Historic Preservation Commission. ''The first and continuing duty of the commission is promotion of public interest in historic preser­vation," Kopczski explained. "We started as a governmental agency to serve as a vehicle for designating legislature to research, protect, maintain and restore the exterior features of historic landmarks.'' 
Next, the commission is man­dated to develop historic preser-
SMC election results posted 
Yesterday's final elections for McCandless Hall president and vice president and Augusta Hall student assembly representative resulted in about SO per cent voter turnout in both dorms. 
Teresita Valdivia and Betsy Steitz, both juniors, were victorious in their race for McCandiess Hall officers. 
Pegy Calhoun was elected Au­gQ&tit.Hall's·~stntative·in· the student'as'seml:ily: . ' ' . 
vation plans for historic landmarks .and districts, and together with other private l!gencies and officials, to assist in the administration and 
implememtation of such plans. 

This particular duty necessitates 
preparing a survey of the city and 
county which identifies structures 
and neighborhoods worthy of his­
toric preservation and architectural 
and neighborhood conservation. 
This includes long-range planning 
to halt the destruction and decay of 
fine, older neighborhoods and 
structures. 
Because the commission is a 
government agency, funds become 
available through grants and en­
dowments. "These federal funds of 
redevelopment are allocated to 
prevent the destruction of those 
structures listed on the National 
Register or those that have the 
potential of being listed,'' Kopczski 
stated. 
She defined the National Regis­
ter as "an inventory of the signifi­
cant structures and sites in the city 
of South Bend. The inventory 
includes buildings and sites of 
historical and architectural merit, 
as well as districts and neighbor­
hooqs which have played a role in 
the development of the city of 
South Bend." 
Kopczski explained one of the 
most difficult tasks of the commis­
sion is to-get across the idea of 
preservation. "In terms of the 
neighborhoods, we want to make 
the people aware of their neighbor­
hood heritage, a quality all-too­
often lost today." 
Many "town-meetings" have been held during the duration of ·the commission. The most recent meeting was held Dec. 12, 1976. At that time, several members and interested ·groups gathered to­gether to celebrate the heritage of the neighborhood. Slide show pre­sentations were given, and several stood to express their views of the value and practicality of saving and 
preserving. 
"We actually saw people becom­ing excited about their heritage.'· Kopczski commented. "It was very encouraging for ns ~ecause we saw the development of that heritage. They were. actually interested in how the history was developed. Even more encouraging was the fact these people a~e so enthusi­astic about preservation and con­servation in their neighborhoods that they are determined and prepared to make politicians listen to their needs. It is overwhelming to see the neighbors band together in an attempt to save their neigh­borhoods." 
Brian Crumlish, an architect with Crumlish and Sporleder, is a dedicated citizen bent on preser­ving, restoring and maintaining structures essential to the survival of the community. 
Crumlish has conducted several 
surveys in .the near northwest 
neighborhood area and the West 
Washington, Chapin-Park area. 
"We did a windshield survey of the area which covers the entire site and generally evaluated the struc­tures as superior or above aver­age," Crumlish stated. He discus­sed the criterion used in determin­ing the status of superior or above average. 
"The first criteria is to consider the structure and how it fits into the neighborhood, next the structural soundness is judged and finally the architectural character is deter­mined." 
The proposed historic district in South Bend, the West Washington area, contains a large collection of homes of very superior rating. According to Crumlish and mem­bers of the commission, the near northwest neighborhood is worthy of national recognition in the National Register but does not have the individual significant structures of the West Washington, Chapin­Park area. 
For instance, contained in the West Washington neighborhood are such structures as St. Patrick's, St. Hedwig's and St. Paul's Mem­orial Methodist Churches. Also included in its many blocks are the Studebaker house, Kaiser-Schmidt house, the Bartlett house and the Oliver mansion. 
James and Joseph Oliver were the inventors of the steel plow and their home is furmshed just as they left it. The Oliver's butler still resides in the mansion and still tends to his daily tasks. 
Crumlish pointed out that of the five houses designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright in the mid­west, two exist in the community of South Bend. And that, he feels, is something to be proud of. 
He emphasized however, that the hisioric district is more than just a few mansions. It is a neighborhood of living people who have a sense of the past that surrounds them. 
Crumlish described the survey 
, taken of the areas. "The survey is a local and state registration. The architectural firm photographs the structure, describes its exterior features and decides. according to the criterion set by the National Register, whether the homes. sites or buildings are superior," he said. ''In applying for the registration we are interested in the architecture and the style." In the South Bend community alone, surveys have shown styles such as Greek Revival, Italianate. Gothic Revival, a large quantity of the Queen Anne style, Roman­esque. Colonial and some Neo­Classical. He noted from his find­ings that it is surprising that out of the list, all of the structural designs can be found in the community. Crumlish particularized the Queen Anne style as being "the most prominent architectural de­sign at the end of the 19th century." The building is basically square with a primidal roof. From this

fundamental structure, the archi­tect constructs dormers and porches that eventually elaborate the form. 
He explainerl the c;tylr ''Ver­nacular Queen Anne'' is not done by an architect but by a builder. This style is very popular in both the West Washington-Chapin Park area and the neighborhood of the near northwest. 
The builder develops the square stratifications and framing system and enriches the structures a little so as you travel down the streets "you'II notice they're almost all the same but there is a slight dif­ference in each one to give them some distinction.'' 
Crumlish views the design as being aesthetically satifying to the eye. "The dwellings are unlike the 
row-homewhere everything is exac­tly the same.·' he observed. ··Be­cause of this particular style. one doesn't catch the monotonv of homes so familiar of today.·· ·

P.O.BoxQ 
Decide by Merit 
Dear Editor: 

I would like to put a dissenting opinion on record with regard to the article entitled "Reverse Dis­crimination" in last Thursday's Observer. Since the symposium on this subject that was held last week did not reallv address itself to the question, but assumed affirmative action as necessary and good and proceeded from there, I would like to answer Ms. Herrera and Mr. Maloney. 
'The argument put forward in the article does not (and can not) deny the fact that affirmative action and related minority admissions programs are indeed discrimina­tory in their nature. Whether or not this discrimination is constitu­tional is the issue presently before the Supreme Court, not whether or not that discrimination is justified, by whatever reasoning. However, I believe that the arguments used by Ms. Herrera and Mr. Maloney in defense of affirmative action are not valid. The argument that since minority students have not grown up in the mainstream of white, middle-American culture, their MCATs, LSATs and GPAs are not indicative of their intelligence may be true, but it ignores the fact that these students will have to read textbooks written in English, they will have to use mathematics--in short, they will have to deal, in 
First & formost on our list is the Dancing Irish. In their present campaign to stimulate interest in their upcoming tryouts we have noticed they have! been extremely sexist. They have openly adver­tised only for women & have placed posters only in women's halls. We feel that since in years prior to women's basketball girls have tried to walk on the varsity, men should be given the opportunity to stand in front of the ACC full houses and shake their bodies. 
Our next complaint is directed at Edmund Price. Tlhe dining hall has feature menus that remind one of Around the World in Eighty Days. We would like to suggest "Other American'' Night featuring hot dogs, apple pie, and the girl next door. 
Other examples of these discri­minatory tactics would include: 
-Refusal by ACC security to allow a group of "Other Americans" 
passage to the main floor for a pick-up game on the afternoon of Saturday March S. 
-Failure of the '77 Dome to include pictures of the Yuyal Trio and other classical musicians. 
We intend to bring attention to these problems by holding a swim­in in the reflecting pool of the Memorial Library from 2 to 5 a.m. tomorrow, followed by an eat-in with farmer Brown's pigs the next day.

The way to correct past discrim­ination against minorities in educa­tional opportunities, and to insure the availability of vital skills in all communities is not to lower aca­demic standards, because this does a disservice, not only to the schools involved, but to the minority students admitted and to society as well. The answer lies in upgrading :nner city education to the level of the best public school in the mburbs, so that minorities may :ompete with whites on an equal, non-discriminatory basis for ad­nission to colleges and profes­;ional schools. This is admittedly nuch more easily said than done, Jut I believe it strikes at the root of

Captivity 
Dear Editor: 

The suggestion by Dean Roemer 
that a night in jail would be "a 
good educational opportunity" is 
very well taken. In view of the 
benefits of such an experience, it 
is not inconceivable that this ed­
ucational "gem" be incorporated 
into our university curriculum, 
perhaps, "Jail 101" or "Introduc­
tion to Captivity." 

It's about time this university 
assumes the responsibility of pre­paring us for the "real" would. Many students graduate from No­tre Dame w'ithout the experience of incarceration. And even more so, how many of us will have a mild heart attack, go bald, or even have to wear a neck brace before we graduate. These are other good educational experiences that are presently unprovided for by the University yet coulld serve as good lessons for future situation. The realization of thes~ practical exper­einces as courses should be looked into. What good is a college education if nothilllg is accomplish­ed but intellectual growth or pre­paration for a career? · 
We need to know the realities of the world and we need to know them now. These are our learning years ?nd we must use them to our best advantage. Jailing stude.nts is only a start. If this program is successful, we can surge forth into new areas. Some suggestions: mock wars, students being struck by blunt objects, minor car acci­dents or even the simulated death of a loved one. All or some of these

question is: Are we prepared for them? 
Dean Roemer has taken the initiative. But the success of these programs would be totally up to us -the students. Granted, there will be some injuries, both mental and physical, but what a small price it is to pay for first-hand experience in life. This is just another example of 
the never-ending of th  university  
of  Notre  Dame  to  Jucate  the  
"total person."

Who's in Charge? 
Dear Editor: 

After reading Thursday's Obser­ver I was so overwhelmed by the absurdity of the reasoning in an article. I felt I had to comment. 
The lead story featured Fr. Lally contradicting himself several times in describing the RA selection procedure. He says "five out of e1grt" students fit into the financ­ial need category; yet this year less than SO percent would have been accepted. Fr. Lally claims "that RA jobs would still go to the ·'best qualified"; yet, later on in the article it was stated six of Lewis Hall's top seven choices would have been rejected. Similar results occurred in Keenan and other halls. My favorite comment of Lally's was that rectors had "for­gotten or not taken seriously," the decision of Feb. 1976. He never explains that he had spent the last year telling rectors, RA' s and potential RA 's in effect not to take the decision seriously. Either Fr. Lally was being blatantly deceptive or there, is a lack of communication in the Office of Student Affairs. 
Taking into account the rector's disapproval of using financial need as a prerequisite for selecting RA 's, the rumors about the Provost interfering in the RA selection process and the state of confusion in the Office of Student Affairs, one has to wonder who really makes the decisions there. 
Michael G. Welsh '77 
Assert Your Rights 
Dear Editor: 

As of Tuesday night Dean Roemer has deemed it necessary to cancel one of the few activities in recent months that had the poten­tial for the entire student body's participation and enjoyment. This decision, in conjunction with the 
rectors' /rectresses' position of total . 
mistrust and paranoia towards the 
students, exemplifies the adminis­
tration 's inability to recognize the 
students' view. . 

We feel that the "hierarchy" of 
Notre Dame has carried its policy of 
"In Loco Parentis" one More step 
too far. It is time they realize that 
we are not children, but responsi­
hie adults who require a medium 
conducive to freedom of social 
activity as well as intellectual 
growth. It seems extremely sad 
that a University which prides itself 
on the development of the total 
person should see fit to continually 
stifle the students' social 
imagination. 

In response, we urge you to "unofficially" sleep out on the North Quad Friday night to protest this unceasing and blatant abuse of students' rights. 
Action is imperative. If we do not constructively respond to this injustice Now we will be assuring ourselves of further instances of the Adminstration disregard for the students' right to be recognized.

Recent attacks have centered on the Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which has been bombed three times in the past 10 days, each incident causing major damage to company transformer stations. PG&E serves most of Northern and 
1 central California. Utility spokesman Mike Dunstan says that of the 19 bombings or attempted bombings aimed at the utility since Jan. 1, 1975, the NWLF has claimed responsibility for 13 bombings and two attempts in which bombs failed to explode. The utility is sensitive about the attacks and their prevention. 
The terrorists have demanded that PG&E provide free electricity for the poor and elderly on fixed incomes and that the utility stop seeking rate increases. 
PG&E professes no unhappiness with the progress of the FBI investigation. "We're doing our free-lance investigation,'' Dunstan admits, "but only what is neces­sary to protect ourselves." 
Another favorite target is the San Francisco Board of Supervisors the city's equivalent of a city council, and various city officials. Bombs have exploded at two supervisors' homes and demands have followed for improved jail conditions. 
The NWLF typically gives no advance notice of bombings. Generally, within an hour after a blast is reported, one or more news outlets will receive a telephone call, claiming responsibility for the blast and giving a statement of demands or directions to a communique.

Women honored at atJlletic banquet 
-
by Laurie Reising Women's Sports Editor 

Notre Dame honored its women athletes at the second annual Women's Athletic Banquet held Tuesday night in the Faculty Dining Room. Acting as emcee for the event was Women's Athletic Co-ordinator, Astrid Hotvedt. 
It was a historical occasion in that for the first time in Notre Dame's 132 year history, Women received varsity monograms from the Athletic Department. Both Women's Fencing and Tennis have acheived varsity status within· the last two years and the outstanding athletes of these two sports were recognized for their achievements via varsity letters. 
In Tennis, senior Jane Lammers and sophomore Mary Shukis were recognized for their outstanding records. Lammers finished the season winning 11 of her 12 matches and Shukis compiled a ten and two record for the year. 
Presenting the awards to the girls was Director of Athletics, Edward "Moose" Krause, whyo not only commented on the histori­cal importance of the event, but also on the fact that Lammers' father had played basketball under him at Notre Dame a few years back. 
The Fencing Team, who com­pleted the season with a 14-1 record, honored three of its mem­bers, juniors Kathy Valdiserri and Cathy Buzard, and senior Chris Marciniak. Their coach, Tom Coy, bestowed the letters on the girls and stressed the fact that "one shows their best and does tht?ir

He singled out Marciniak, who will be going on to medical school next year, as an example that "given time, patience, endurance, you can do well in both sports and studies." 
Sr. John Jones delivered the invo cation to the group preceeding their meal and afterwards awards for the non-varsity spans were announced. Basketball was the first club sport recognized as co-captains Carol Lally and Maure­en Maloney distributed certificates to their teammates. 
Then it was their turn to receive, as Maloney, a senior, was named winner of the Sportsmanship Award and Lally was voted by her teammates at the Most Valuable Player. 
Field Hockey was the next sport on the agenda and here two girls shared MVP distinction. On of­fense, Mary Ann Dooley was chosen and for defense it was Patty De Coste. 
Sailing, Notre Dame's only purely co-ed sport, one where there is actual male-female competition, was recognized for its contribution to the women's athletic program. Senior Meme Hanson, a veteran of four years was honored as most able "mate." It was Ms. Hanson's second such award, for last year she was named as best sailor on the team. 
The last club sport so honored was Women's Crew. Coach Fred Heydrich received a trophy as thanks for his two years of coaching and four additional years of assis­tance and encouragement. Also applauded were the senior rowers of the team Carol Latrotrlea-,--"Mary Fitzsimons and Joanne Gormley. 
Following club sports were the special interest groups. The Dancing Irish honored its captains Becky Thornton and Mary Ann Shilala and announced their suc­cessors for the 77-78 year as being Juniors Cary Radd and Sandy Stohrer. In track and field sopho­more Sue Behnke and freshman Helen Weber were singled out for their contributions of ''time and energy." 

Others recognized at the banquet included Dr. Thomas Kelly, head of non-varsity sports and Senior Ei­leen O'Grady, interhall co-ordina­tor and Notre Dame Women's Sports Editor Emeritus. 
The final award of the evening was bestowed upon Hotvedt. As the crowd rose in a standing ovation, Bonita Bradshaw pre sented a bouquet of roses saying "because of Astrid, Notre Damt Women's sports is on the move anc should stay on the move." Ir thanking everyone for the award Ms. Hotvedt set next year's goah for women's sports. These includec the advancement of interest group~ to club status and the raising o. field hockey and basketball to tht varsity level.

knees. Yes. in keeping with the 
tradition of Notre Dame's Book­
store Basketball, yesterday's 
games had everything ... including a 
couple of upsets. As the tourna­
mcnt moves into the "Elite Eight" 
quarter-final games, a couple of 
teams that figured on being there, 
will be looking for a seat on the 
sidelines when games get under­
way. 

In what proved to be the most exciting (and longest) game in this 
year's tournament, LAW came out on the short end of a 24-22 upset at the hands of Guys and Dolls. Led by Dana Snoap and Brian McAul­iffe, who each accounted for eight markers, LAW's attack was sev­erely hampered by an injury to Jeff 
Carpenter. 

The Irish backcourt ace was plagued throughtout the game with a broken collarbone that he appar­ently sustained in Tuesday night's game. The victors were paced by Mark Peruschietti, who sunk eight field-goals and Jim Singer, who finished the hour and fifteen min­ute contest with six. 
In another contest with a sur­prise endtng, the Nutmeggers sent the Butcher Brothers home with a 21-19 loss. With Tim Kardok's seven tallies leading the way, the Nutmeggers p.-oceeded to out-hust­le their physical opponents to. gain a spot in the quarter-finals. The Butcher Brothers were paced by Bruce Flowers who hit tive times and pulled down 13 rebounds. Bill Seeger also cashed in five times for the losers while Mike Howard 
added the Nutmeggers cause with six points. 
For the remainder of the tourn­ament's top-ranked teams, things went pretty much as expected as all three of top-seeded entry's gained a berth in the quarter-finals. TILCS IV, the number one seed in this year's Bookstore extravaganza, found themselves fighting dark­ness as well as a tough Stevie 
Wonder club, but they managed to hang on to a 21-17 victory. The TILCS were paced by Dave 
Batton, who was successful on eight of sixteen attempts. Batton also pulled down a game-high 12 rebounds. John Dubenetzki · cJrop­ped five field-goals for the· defend­
ing ·champions. Todd Slade~ ·and

Losing yet another top perfor­mer, this time to injury, the Notre Dame tennis team continued its prowess on the courts as they came up with two victories in three . outings earlier this week. · . · 
Playing without their senior cap­tain Randy Stehlik, the Irish netters traveled to Milwaukee to take on the Warriors of Marquette on Sunday. The jumbling of the line-up affected the Irish little as they won easily 8-1. 
With Stehlik absent, coach Fal­lon decided to move each of the other doubles teams up and place a new team in the third spot. The strategy worked perfectly as Notre Dame swept the three matches. In the number one slot, Marty Horan and Bob Koval took a tough decision from Mark Stich and Len Ciborosky of the Warriors. Giving up five games in the first set, the Irish duo held on for the victory, 7-5. fhe second set saw Notre Dame win the same number of games while yielding one more than in the previous set as Horan and Koval took the second set in a tie-breaker 7-6. 
The second wirt for the Irish saw the red hot doubles team of Mark Trueblood and Tom Westphal go the distance with Mike O'Briend and Ray Leffler of Marquette. 
er 7-6, the team then faltered losing 6-4. In the rubber set of the 'match Notre Dame gave up just three games in route to a 6-3 victory to give them the match. 
The third doubles team was a new one for the Irish. Steve Barrett and Jim Kelly came through for the netters as they took two sets to defeat Doug Kruse and Jim Dudley of the Warriors. Winning the first set 6-4, the Marquette duo nar­rowed the gap but the Irish netters 
held  on  to  a  7-6 tie-breaker  win  
securing the match.  
Needing  just  two  of  the  six  

remaining matches to secure a victory the Irish took little time to get started. Freshman Carlton Harris playing in the number two singles spot put the Irish one step closer as he soundly defeated O'Brien in straight sets 6-3, 6-3. 
In the number three position Koval of Notre Dame took three sets before disposing of his Warrior opponent. The final tally read 6-3, 4-6, 7-S. 
With the match already won Trueblood, playing in the fourth slot, came back to win the first set in a tie-breaker 7-6, and then took the second set without losing a game. 
The fifth position saw Westphal sweep by his Marquette opponent in identical sets 6-4, 6-4. 
Closing out the Irish 8-1 romp was Barrett. Winning the initial set easily with a score of 6-2, he gave up the next one 6-3.The final set was again in his favor, however, as he won 7-5. 
After a tough loss to Indiana on Monday which saw the Irish lose eight out of nine matches, they came from behind on the excellent play again of Westphal to defeat Northwestern by the score of 5-4. 
Continuing their strong play in the doubles competition, the Irish again came up with two victories, this time in the teams of Horan and Koval and Harris and Barrett. 
Winning in straight sets, Horan and Koval had little trouble captur­ing the first set, 6-3. The second set was a turnabout as the Irish duo won a hard fought 7-6 tie-breaker. 
Harris and Barrett gave up just four games in the number three position, all of which cr.me in the first 'Set as they coasted to a 6-4, 6-0 win for Notre Dame. 
Singles saw Harris lose his first set 6-3 before unwinding for a three set victory over his Northwestern opponent, Bob Kaspers. The scores of the remaining two sets were 6-3, 6-2, respectively. 
In the third slot Koval won in straight sets over Steve Kohn, 6-3, 7-5. 
Losing the number four and number six spots the Irish needed Westphal's match for the victory. Already behind losing the first set 6-3, Westphal came back to take. the next two sets winning 6-4 and 7-5. 
The wins coupled with the loss gives the Notre Dame netters a record of 12-9. 
Notre Dame travels to Purdue today before entertaining Michigan State at 1 p.m. on Friday, Wiscon­sin at 10 a.m. on Saturday and Kalamazoo at 2 p.m. on Sunday concluding their busiest home weekend of the season.
