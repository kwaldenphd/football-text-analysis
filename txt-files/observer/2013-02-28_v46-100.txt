HER LOYAL DAUGHTERS

‘They were trailblazers back then’

Women’s athletics offer the University a visible example of coeducation’s progress on campus

By SAM STRYKER
Assistant Managing Editor
Editor’s note: This is the next in a five-day series discussing the role of women at Notre Dame and Saint Mary’s, in honor of the 40th anniversary of coeducation at the University this year. 
When Notre Dame Deputy Athletic Director Missy Conboy played for the women’s basketball program in its early years as a var­sity program from 1978 to 1982, she didn’t enjoy many of the perks today’s female athletes enjoy.
There were no chartered flights, no nutritional or academic coun­seling. The team didn’t even have a training room. The women were lucky to even travel on a bus.
“We used to get a towel with practice clothes every day at the is­sue room,” she said. “There was a towel with a green top and green shorts, the same that the men would wear. Sometimes we would get a [jockstrap] in ours and think, ‘Oh, this was in the wrong pile.’”
In many ways, the progress of female athletics has served as a barometer for gender relations at the University in the 40 years since Notre Dame first opened its class­rooms to women. 
With multiple national champi­onships in several women’s sports, Conboy, who rejoined the Athletic Department in 1987, said women’s sports have provided a “visible ex­ample” of the coeducational prog­ress made at Notre Dame. Now, women on campus — not just fe­male athletes — expect to excel.
“They think everything is open to them,” she said. “That’s part of the great success.”
‘We were playing in relative obscurity’
But it wasn’t always so easy. Sr. Sally Duffy served as the coach of the women’s basketball team when it was a club program from 1975 to 1977. She said her play­ers had to have a certain strength about them in order to success­fully navigate the waters of playing for a young program.
“I wouldn’t say they were used to it, being treated as not equal, but certainly you learned that you had to adjust,” she said. “You could hit your head against the wall or you could go with the flow.”
During this time, Duffy said the team was a bare-bones operation — vans to away games, practic­ing when there was any available court time and no sort of academ­ic support for the athletes that is commonplace today.
“The players would have their flashlights on in the van [to do homework],” she said. “We would stop at McDonalds if we were lucky. We just didn’t have the resources.”
Duffy said because Notre Dame was in the early years of coeduca­tion when its women’s programs were formed, it was enduring two growing pains at the same time.
“[Change] was incremental,” she said. “Notre Dame had dif­ferent dynamics, because the whole coeducational [shift] was happening. Other teams we were playing at the time, for example Northwestern, … they had been coeducational for decades. They didn’t have two phenomena hap­pening at the same time.”
Duffy said she believes the early female athletes helped bring about an environment that was welcoming to coeducation at Notre Dame because “they reflect­ed the values of the University.”
“These women did it because they loved the team aspect,” Duffy said. “They loved coming together. And they loved Notre Dame. They loved what Notre Dame stood for, and they were active in other ways. They stood for what Notre Dame stands for today.
“They were trailblazers back then. They had to be.”
Making strides on and off the court
Conboy said while she and the other female athletes did not feel as if they were pushing for monu­mental progress at the University in earning varsity status, she felt the visibility of athletics at Notre Dame showed women were excel­ling in areas of passion.
“We were excited to be pioneers and to know that women were be­ing accepted into places at Notre Dame that they never had trav­eled before,” she said. “I do think that some of the inroads we were making as female athletes were assigned to other women on campus. It’s okay to tread into male endeavors and take your place among the other students at Notre Dame.”   
When she first rejoined the ath­letic department, Conboy worked under former Irish athletic di­rector Dick Rosenthal. She said Rosenthal, a father of six daugh­ters, shared many of the hopes she had for the program — but progress was slow for a “tradi­tional” athletic department that treated even its men’s sports in an “old school” manner.
“Obviously he was moving the needle,” she said. “But when you were in the midst of it, it didn’t feel as if it were moving as quickly as you wanted it to.”
Conboy said progress was fur­thered when men and women be­gan to become involved working with sports of the opposite sex.
“The big change was once we started giving men responsibility of women’s sports and women re­sponsibility of men’s sports, peo­ple started caring more about the athletes they were working with than the gender,” she said.
Now in her 25th year at the helm, Irish women’s basketball coach Muffet McGraw said the team was treated as “second class” even when she started coaching in 1987.
“We were playing in relative ob­scurity,” McGraw said. “Nobody came to the games. We bussed everywhere. We didn’t have the budget support. We didn’t really have the same of anything that the men had.”
In looking back at what the women’s basketball program was like nearly 26 years ago when she first joined the Irish, McGraw characterized the difference as “night and day,” to the point the teams are viewed as equals.
“I think that it’s the same as be­ing a male athlete,” McGraw said. “I think that people look at us, we’re successful. … I think that we’re looked at as more the sport of basketball. I think you look at us and see the notoriety we brought to Notre Dame not just through the players but the success of the program.”
The impact on the University
Former Irish player Ruth Riley was the star of the 2001 squad that won Notre Dame’s first and only women’s basketball national championship. Riley said in her time at Notre Dame, she appreci­ated female athletes had “come a long way” in how they were treated.
“I don’t differentiate between men’s and women’s sports. … They’re pretty much the same at Notre Dame,” she said. “They’re equal.”
After winning the national title, Riley said she could feel “the entire University’s support behind us.”
“The reception we had from the student body and the professors, from the University as a whole, the Notre Dame family … for me, I was grateful for the team, to be put on the map at that level,” she said.
More than two decades and a national championship later, McGraw said she now sees an im­pact the success of women’s pro­grams have had on Notre Dame. 
“It’s been great to see how the students and faculty and every­body has been really behind our success, to make us feel what we are doing is important to the University,” she said.
Conboy explained she believes the women’s programs have made amazing progress at Notre Dame because female student-athletes care about “all the pieces to the puzzle” when they choose to at­tend the University.
“When I’m sitting here selling Notre Dame to a young female athlete and her parents, every­thing from the educational experi­ence to the alumni network to use Notre Dame personally or profes­sionally their whole life … all those things are really appealing to our female athletes,” she said.

HER LOYAL DAUGHTERS

Men recall ‘gradual’ shift

By MARISA IATI
News Writer 
Editor’s note: This is the next in a five-day series dis­cussing the role of women at Notre Dame and Saint Mary’s, in honor of the 40th anniversary of coeducation at the University this year. 
When Notre Dame opened its doors to undergraduate women in the fall of 1972, the University’s approxi­mately 5,000 male students faced what 1976 alumnus Dan Reagan called “a histor­ic occasion.”  
Reagan, former associate vice president for University Relations, was a member of the first class to admit wom­en as freshmen. 
“It was written about … and televised and spoken about not only within Notre Dame circles, but it also reached the national level,” Reagan said. “I think CBS was on campus for a few days right at the beginning. … It had an air about it that this was important, that this was a pretty monumental change for the University.”
Despite the national at­tention, admitting women to the University did not change the campus environ­ment as much as expected, 1975 alumnus Frank Devine said. The male students al­ready knew many of the women who transferred from Saint Mary’s College because the schools’ co-exchange program enabled students to take classes at either institution. 
“These were the women we had worked with at The Observer or WSND or in the­ater productions,” Devine, a current producer at “60 Minutes,” said. “These were the women who we were tak­ing history courses at Notre Dame with or English cours­es at Saint Mary’s.”
Because of the schools’ close relationship, Devine said the transition seemed natural. 
“Sort of the brilliance of what [University President Emeritus Fr. Ted] Hesburgh did was gently change the culture,” Devine said. “You probably won’t hear this from any of the women who felt a little awkward or alien­ated … but in fact, we were ready for coeducation by the time it came.” 
The high male-to-female ratio also made the change less jarring than it otherwise would have been, Devine said. Only Badin and Walsh Halls housed women during the first year of coeducation. 
“It seemed to be very gradual and steady and in­evitable, and I don’t recall anybody uncomfortable with the idea,” Devine said. 
Reagan agreed the change was not overwhelming. 
“Even though coeducation was just beginning, it was very much a male-oriented school at the time,” he said. “So even when you would attend your class as a fresh­man, there were just a few women and mostly men.”
Many members of the Class of 1976 were not great­ly impacted by the transi­tion to coeducation because they had never known Notre Dame any other way, director of admissions Bob Mundy, a 1976, said. For students who attended coeducational high schools, the change was even less dramatic. 
“In my senior year in high school, one of my teachers mentioned this, that Notre Dame was becoming coed,” Mundy said. “It was never really sort of big in my con­sciousness about attending Notre Dame. … Maybe com­ing from the public school, it just seemed more normal.”
Reagan said he was excited to hear about Notre Dame’s coeducation plans because he came from a family with five boys and attended a high school with many more men than women. 
“I had already wanted to apply, but I would say that the fact that Notre Dame was now going to be coed to me was a great thing and made me want to be accepted that much more,” Reagan said. “I think it was a really healthy thing and we were happy to hear.”
The change to coeduca­tion worked out better than the proposed merger be­tween Notre Dame and Saint Mary’s, which fell apart in 1971, Devine said.
“There was a time when it looked like the way to go was a merger and we were ready for it and expected it, and it would have probably not worked out as well as just going coed on Notre Dame, largely because [coeduca­tion] forced the University to totally integrate the wom­en into the University struc­ture and life,” he said. “If we had merged, I don’t know if you would have seen any of that.”

Pope-Davis to leave ND

Production sparks dialogue

Observer Staff Report
Notre Dame’s vice president and associate provost Don Pope-Davis will leave the University in July to serve as provost at DePaul University, according to a Wednesday press release. Pope-Davis was elected to his current position in 2007 and worked closely with undergraduate schol­arship and research throughout his tenure, the release stated. He is the second Notre Dame vice president and associate provost to leave the University in the past two years to accept a position as chief academic officer at another Catholic university.
“From his research accom­plishments to faculty support, diversity initiatives, leadership in graduate education and ath­letics, and resolute commitment to Notre Dame’s Catholic mis­sion, Don has made significant contributions to the life of our University over the past 13 years,” Notre Dame provost Thomas G. Burish said in the press release. “I am immensely grateful to him and know that he will serve DePaul well as its chief academic officer.”
Pope-Davis also serves as a professor of psychol­ogy and oversees the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Office of Student Financial Services. He imple­mented the Undergraduate Academic Code of Honor and is involved with the University’s ROTC programs, the Center for Undergraduate Scholarly Engagement, the Hesburgh-Yusko Scholars Program, the Office of Disability Services, DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Snite Museum of Art, First Year of Studies, the Institute for Church Lif, and the Center for Social Concerns, the release stated.
Pope-Davis headed the Provost’s Office’s efforts to ad­dress various faculty concerns.Before his election as vice presi­dent, he spent five years leading the Graduate School. He was as­sistant vice president from 2002 to 2004, associate vice president from 2005 to 2007 and interim dean of the Graduate School for one year. 
During his time at Notre Dame, Pope-Davis coordinat­ed the Multicultural Research Institute, directed the TRIO pro­grams to mobilize students from disadvantaged backgrounds and led the Moreau Academic Diversity Postdoctoral Fellowship Program.	He chaired Notre Dame’s Faculty Board on Athletics for three years and served as its NCAA faculty athletics representative.iHis specific interests lie in the development of cultural and racial identities, cultural com­petency training, development and assessment. 
Pope-Davis earned his doc­torate in counseling psychol­ogy from Stanford University and holds a bachelor’s degree in psychology and theology from Benedictine University in Lisle, Ill.

Loyal Daughters and Sons, a completely student-run pro­duction concerned with issues of sexual violence, sexuality, religion and gender at Notre Dame, seeks to enable dia­logue, prevent future violence, and create a safe space for heal­ing and hope, senior director Lauren Palomino said.
The show, which runs three nights this weekend, devotes most of its performance time to portraying true stories about sexual violence, but Palomino said it also aims to offer stu­dents a comprehensive perspec­tive on sexuality at Notre Dame.
“The show creates a space to present a lot of different view­points. I think everyone’s voice needs to be heard,” Palomino said. “It’s always been impor­tant for us to tell the stories about sexual violence because those are the most difficult to share. We want people to leave the show though having seen a positive side to sexuality at Notre Dame as well.”
This year’s theme, “I Am Not,” arose from Palomino’s desire both to infuse freshness in the show and address the common belief that only others fall vic­tim to sexual violence, she said.
“No one ever thinks that they will experience sexual vio­lence or that it could happen to someone they love, and it does,” Palomino said. “It’s a terrible reality of being here that we all feel so safe but these events do happen. How do we look at both of these together?”
In preparation for the show, Palomino said she and the writ­ers and actors focus on captur­ing the authentic voice behind a particular story.  They try to avoid insincerity and to respect the courage of students who contributed their experiences to the production. 
“When going through the script, we constantly consider how we would feel and how we would present the information,” Palomino said. “We may read these stories a hundred times, but we want it to feel really real when we present it to the audience.”
Palomino said her actors un­derstand the possibility that the person behind their story may be in the audience at any per­formance, and this awareness helps them prepare for their roles.
“We want to treat every story with respect, and you can’t do an imitation because imitation can turn into caricature,” she said. “We treat the script as we would every other script, so that each actor can bring their own personality to the character.”
Junior Marissa Vos, a three-time LDS actress, said the production holds special sig­nificance on campus due to its continual relevance to student life. 
“The show has a really spe­cial way of touching the audi­ence because everyone on this campus can personally relate to at least one of the scenes,” Vos said. “The cast is given the unique opportunity to give a voice to members of our com­munity who are struggling in silence. This show is a perfect example of how the arts really can change the world.” 
Ultimately, Palomino said she hopes the hours of prepa­ration and introspection will demonstrate the serious reality of students’ stories and evoke powerful responses from the audience.
“No one is just a victim. Everyone has a whole life and has a story,” she said. “Everyone will have a story they will con­nect with. Everyone will have a story that makes them angry. We want people to leave and talk about these stories with their friends.”
Loyal Daughters and Sons will take place this Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in the Carey Auditorium of the Hesburgh Library. Tickets are available at the LaFortune Student Center Box Office.

Students bid to dine with campus celebrities

By ANN MARIE JAKUBOWSKI
News Writer
More than 25 Notre Dame celebrities are on the menu to­night at Breen-Phillips Hall’s 29th annual Meal Auction, where students can place bids for a chance to dine with illus­trious campus figures such as Irish football coach Brian Kelly or basketball coach Mike Brey, among others. 
One of the hall’s signature events, the live and silent auc­tions will benefit Meals on Wheels, a charity with which Breen-Phillips has had a long relationship, hall president Allison Behrndt and auction coordinator Jaclyn Winkel said.
“In [Breen-Phillips], we’re always talking about commu­nity and fostering that sense in our dorm,” Winkel said. “Meals on Wheels reaches out to com­munity members who might otherwise be forgotten, so that same sense is there.”
Winkel said a wide array of prominent campus fig­ures will participate as auc­tion prizes, including student body president-elect and vice president-elect Alex Coccia and Nancy Joyce, finance professor Carl Ackermann and psychol­ogy professor Anre Venter, as well as members of the Notre Dame men’s basketball and track and field teams. 
“Basically, we’ve contacted a bunch of campus celebrities and cool professors, and they agreed to have a meal with the highest bidder,” Winkel said. “People can come and bid per plate, and if you win you get to go out to dinner or have a home-cooked meal with the person.”
Breen-Phillips president Allison Behrndt said bidders can expect great experiences with all the “menu items” but recommended that Irish athlet­ic fans consider the offers from Kelly and Brey.
“Coach Kelly always does a meal with the football staff, and he usually gives the people who win a bunch of issue gear and autographed items,” Behrndt said. “Brey also sets up a meal, and that’s always popular.”
Winkel said the dinner with Kelly typically raises the most money of all the individual auc­tion items. 
“Sometimes, people pay upwards of $100 for Kelly,” she said. “He usually takes about two or three people, and last year he gave them a tour of the locker room, too.” 
With far more bidders than prizes, students bid per plate so groups can share the cost of a ticket item, Winkel said, and auction participants may choose how many people they will take and where they will eat.
“A few guys from the baseball team said they’d take people to Brothers [Bar and Grill], and some basketball players are do­ing a meal at McAlister’s [Deli],” Winkel said. “Professor Venter is taking six to eight people for a home-cooked South African dinner at his house, so there are a lot of different choices.” 
Behrndt said the event is a great way for students to con­nect with high-profile campus figures in a relaxed, personal setting.
“I think the best aspect [of the auction] is giving people the opportunity to interact with people they normally wouldn’t be able to meet, like the coaches,” Behrndt said. “It’s great that students can share a more intimate meal with their professors, which they prob­ably wouldn’t have the chance to do otherwise.” 
The auction committee de­cided to host the event in the Burger King lounge to attract more traffic from passersby and increase student aware­ness of the cause it supports, Winkel and Behrndt said.
“We made a few changes to the menu and location basi­cally to encourage greater au­dience participation and to make it more of a campus-wide event,” Behrndt said. 
Winkel said students are en­couraged to drop by and bid spontaneously on the people that pique their interest.
Gift baskets and restau­rant gift cards will be offered during the silent auction in the Sorin Room of LaFortune Student Center from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. The live auction will oc­cupy the Burger King lounge in LaFortune tonight from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.

SENATE

Group improves Hall of the Year selection process

By MADDIE DALY
News Writer
Student Senate debated resolutions to improve the transparency of Hall of the Year selection process at Wednesday’s meeting. 
Department of internal af­fairs director Ben Noe dominat­ed Wednesday night’s Student Senate meeting by presenting a resolution to improve the Hall of the Year process.
Both internal affairs and Hall Presidents’ Council (HPC) de­bated a resolution regarding the selection process and scoring system for the Hall of the Year, Noe said.  
“The process for Hall of the Year has been changed a few times in the past few years, but hopefully this time we have it just the way we want it,” Noe said. “Currently, Rockne [Awards] are given to one win­ning dorm per month and count as bonus points added onto the dorm president’s pre­sentation score. Our new sys­tem scores the Rocknes on a non-competitive rubric, count­ing as 30 percent of final score while presentations will consti­tute the remaining 70 percent.”
Morrissey Manor senator Billy McMahon said his constit­uents were unhappy with the results of last year’s Hall of the Year race as a result what they alleged were flaws in the scor­ing system.
“We won almost all the Rocknes last year and then nothing happened for us after­wards,” McMahon said.  “When you’re giving 70 percent of the weight for Hall of the Year on a one-time presentation, it gets to be which dorm can put together the best Prezi or which dorm has the most charismatic speakers, not the day-to-day work the entire dorm puts in.”
Noe said this resolution in­tends to assuage concerns about the scoring system by giv­ing more weight to the monthly Rockne awards, which previ­ously constituted only about 10 percent of a hall’s final score. 
HPC co-president Matt Lynch said the changes to the scor­ing system will likely promote greater participation by all resi­dence halls. 
“This year’s potential 30 per­cent more is more than last year,” Lynch said.  “It’s not competitive because instead of there being only one Rockne winner per month, it’s more if you turn it in, you get credit, like attending class.”
Sophomore class president Tim Scanlan suggested an amendment to the Hall of the Year resolution to add the pub­lication of the rubric used to judge the hall president pre­sentations, The Senate ap­proved this resolution.Noe presented another resolution regarding special interest stu­dent organizations, including the gay-straight alliance (GSA), Bookstore Basketball, Junior Parents Weekend, Knights of Columbus, student campus ori­entation committee and the de­bate team.
“It was brought to our atten­tion in December that there are organizations that are not offi­cially student organizations but are not clubs either, they are in a sort of gray area,” Noe said.  
The proposed resolution would allow these special inter­est groups to access to the large pool of money available to the Student Union, Noe said. 
“The Student Union constitu­tion contains rules for the allo­cation of the $850,000 Student Union funds,” Noe said.  “We are suggesting a total distribution of .25 percent of these funds, about $2,000, to the six special interest groups. It will be allo­cated based on a presentation as well as need.”
The groups will receive these funds in addition to funding provided by various outside sources, Noe said.  
“These organizations need to have access to a sort of contin­gency money in case they need something not included in the outside funding budget,” Noe said. “The best example I can think of is Bookstore Basketball. It operates pretty much break-even because of the charity donations, so if they need new basketballs or other equipment they should be able to do so in a sort of emergency situation.”
Noe said this plan is one of several formulated since the Senate began to discuss how to include interest groups in bud­getary considerations began in November.
“In conclusion, many plans have been considered, count­less phone conversations have been had and ultimately this plan has the greatest benefit with the least amount of com­plication,” Noe said.  
The resolution passed with just two opposing votes. 
Current Student Union Board (SUB) manager Ashley Markowski presented her nom­inee for next year’s position, Kaitlyn Keelin, a junior Science-Business major from McGlinn Hall who has been involved with SUB since her freshman year. The group voted in favor of Keelin taking over this position.

Author delves into history behind novel

By CAILIN CROWE
News Writer
Author Rebecca Skloot discussed her New York Times bestselling nonfiction book, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,” with the Saint Mary’s commu­nity Wednesday evening in O’Laughlin Auditorium. 
Skloot began the lecture by addressing the significance of Henrietta Lacks’ cells to major medical advances, in­cluding the development of the polio vaccine, cloning and gene mapping. 
According to a College press release, Lacks’ can­cer cells were taken without her knowledge in 1951 and used for medical research, but her contribution is vir­tually unknown and her family remains poor and uncompensated. 
Skloot said she learned about HeLa cells, so called for Lacks’s first and last names, in a college biology course and became obsessed with uncovering the story of the woman who unknow­ingly facilitated significant medical innovation in the 20thh century. Her obses­sion launched a decade-long investigation, Skloot said. 
“I worked on this book for about 11 years and the road­blocks I faced were pretty amazing, but Lacks’ daugh­ter told me, ‘Don’t let any­one stop you from writing this book,’” she said. “I re­ally took that advice to heart and I became even more de­termined to learn about her mother.” 
Skloot concluded her lecture by encouraging students to follow their pas­sions, using her personal ex­perience of changing career paths to become a writer as an example. 
“Letting go of a goal doesn’t mean you failed as long as you have a new one in its place,” she said. “That’s not giving up, it’s just changing directions, which can be one of the most important things to do in life.” 
Saint Mary’s science stu­dents in attendance said they appreciated the connections between science and daily life Skloot incorporated into her book.
“I like how she integrates science into people’s lives and how she made what’s done in the lab practical for the real world,” first year Angela Aldrich, a mathemat­ics and chemistry major, said. 
Senior biology major Kaitlyn Takach said she thinks the book exposes a little-known story to people who otherwise would not have considered the impact of HeLa cells on their own lives.
“Skloot’s research and sto­ry are so important because she’s bridging the gap be­tween science and the gen­eral public,” Takach said.

Swinging and missing in Lent

INSIDE COLUMN

DeBartolo’s many faces

Honestly now — how many times have you broken your Lenten promise so far? As I do most Lents, I promised to spend 30 minutes in quiet prayer each morning of these 40 days, but I already know of three days when that has not happened, two days when I didn’t reach the finish line and at least two more days when my prayer was so distracted it could hardly count as prayer. Today is the 16th day of Lent, and that’s seven whiffs. If Lent were a baseball game, my .438 average would have someone checking me for steroids. God, however, has not yet knocked on my door with a random drug test, so the numbers don’t seem to impress Him much. Has God ever tried to hit a baseball? It’s not that easy.
The days when we break our Lenten promises can be the most important of the 40 days of Lent. Reminders of our seemingly unshakeable inability to keep even simple commitments to God bring with them a whole battery of inte­rior reactions, rich with the possibility of deeper self-knowledge and a deeper knowledge of God. I have learned some of my most enduring spiritual lessons while swinging and missing during Lent.
Most importantly, I have discovered that if I put my mind to it, I am capable of endlessly frustrating myself. I have never made it through a flawless 40 days of Lent and the prospects for next year don’t look great either. I am pretty sure I am incapable of pulling off a perfect Lent. And once I start think­ing outside of Lent to the challenges that confront me the other 325 days, it’s a wonder I get up in the morning. It would be easier and safer if I just stayed in Keenan Hall with the door locked.
Of course, this spiritual depression — born of a spiritual perfectionism — is a helpful conclusion to reach precisely for its absurdity. Lent reminds me precisely of the certainty that moral and spiritual perfection is an impossibility for me. Yet an overwhelming sense of discour­agement at our failings hardly helps us build up the Kingdom of God, which I definitely can’t do locked in my room in Keenan — no offense, of course, to the guys at Keenan.
My search for a more helpful re­sponse sends my mind through the Lenten scriptures and the almost daily reminder they provide of the collection of sinners with whom Jesus spent his days.  Times of spiritual discourage­ment are extremely rich times to read about Jesus’ encounter with the town thief Zacchaeus or Jesus’ calling of Matthew the tax collector. I nearly cry every third Sunday of Lent when I hear Jesus speak in utter compassion to the adulterous Samaritan woman sitting at the well: “You are thirsting after water that will make you thirsty again. But I can give you water so that you will thirst no more.” These are people of sig­nificant moral imperfection, and what strikes me to the heart is not so much that Jesus forgives them — though of course he does — but that he actually seems to seek out and then remains in their company. My readings of these passages, and seeing myself in them, are some of the most intimate mo­ments with God I experience all year. While they don’t justify my sins and shortcomings, they do speak to them — and the words are ones of mercy, love and a renewed call to conversion, true freedom and a relationship with God. My Lenten failings are invitations not into discouragement, but into a deeper understanding of the depth of God’s mercy and love.
Perhaps I shouldn’t be so content with imperfection, but — truth be told — I kind of like hitting .438 during Lent. Recognition of our limitations and rec­ognition of our thirst to transcend them — even if that recognition sometimes manifests itself only as frustration with ourselves — is a time-tested gateway to a more vibrant and real relationship with Christ. Our limitations make us one with most of the Gospel characters Jesus goes out of his way to encounter. Jesus seeks us out with such persistent compassion despite, or indeed because of, our sin, failures and imperfections. So, .438 it is this Lent. But hey, it’s hard to hit a baseball with perfect regular­ity.Besides, you don’t want to be at the peak of your game in spring training.

Over the course of a Notre Dame ca­reer, every student usually has a class in DeBartolo Hall. As a result, we’ve each experienced social life between classes. DeBartolo holds a mix of students unlike any other building on campus since it houses such a variety of class meetings. This is the perfect storm for all sorts of encounters. We’ve all been there, which is why I give you: the five people you see in DeBartolo.
That friend you always make plans with that never stick:
You probably met her through a mutual friend at a dorm party freshman year and became instant besties. As you got older, your friendship flourished and you actu­ally started doing real things together. Suddenly, though, it seems like you hardly have time for each other anymore. “Oh my goodness, I haven’t seen you in forever,” you’ll say each time you see her. “We’ve got to get dinner or something and catch up. I’ve got to get to class. Text me.” You exchange three texts, make ten­tative plans to meet for lunch and at the last minute something always comes up.
That person you used to know:
Maybe it was someone who lives in your dorm but faded out of your friend group. Maybe it’s that kid you met once a few weeks ago but now it’s weird if you say hello. Maybe it’s that guy or girl you had a sort-of-thing with sophomore year and now you’re not sure whether to say hello, just give a nod or avert your eyes entirely. No matter who it is, it’s awkward and you spend your time in DeBartolo hoping that seeing this person is a rarity.
That person you think you know:
Because you see them not only in DeBartolo, but in the dining hall, on the quad and at Legends’ free concerts. You’re pretty sure you’ve also had a cou­ple of classes with them. Odds are you’ve done a bit of Facebook creeping as well (because hey, you see them everywhere), so even though you’ve never actually met, you feel like you know them anyway.
That football player:
He stands outside the big lecture classrooms dressed in issue gear with his headphones blaring, and all you can think as you pass by is, “Man, that’s a large dude.” If you don’t have a class in DeBartolo this semester but still wish to spot a football player away from the ath­letic fields, try CJ’s on a Saturday.
That actual friend:
This is the most welcome DeBartolo en­counter. You see this person regularly, so seeing them in DeBartolo is just an added bonus. You welcome the sight of their friendly face, and take the brief break to talk, laugh and make actual plans that do, in fact, stick.

Solidarity to create a great university and world

“Faith. It’s not something you can see or touch … or is it? It’s been said, there’s blood in these bricks: the blood of thousands of men and women whose faith in something bigger than themselves built a great Catholic university. And it’s that same faith that’s building a better world today. So yes, faith is some­thing you can see and touch. And at Notre Dame, faith is also something that touches you. That’s faith. This is Notre Dame.”
I just listened to these words in a video on our University website. Indeed, throughout the past three and a half years I have witnessed the faith of count­less students, professors and faculty members as they participated in service-learning projects, traveled overseas to learn about the lives of others and shared their time and resources with our local community. It is the “disciplined sensibility to the poverty, injus­tice and oppression that burden the lives of so many” and the “sense of human solidarity and concern for the common good that will bear fruit as learning becomes service to justice” that distinguish Notre Dame as a great Catholic university. 
About a week ago, I was touched when a middle-aged man and woman from Indonesia came to Notre Dame to tell the story of how their families and community suffered when the factory they worked for closed unexpectedly. The woman shared how desperate her family became in a country where there is no insurance option for workers like her and her husband when they suddenly lost their job. Without receiving the necessary severance pay, this woman’s situation became grave very quickly. Before long, they were forced to move into a smaller apart­ment with only one room to live in — even to use the bathroom in. Without the money to pay for rice, beans or any other nutritional staples, this woman and her family survived on Cassava leaves, which they were allowed to pick off the tree owned by their landlord. Hungry and desperate, this mother of three felt ashamed and worried for her children. She was further devastated when a friend of hers — who had also become desperate after losing her job and re­ceiving no severance — killed her daughter and then threw herself in front of a moving vehicle because she wanted “to be free” from her suffering. 
At the end of this summer, I traveled abroad and met with some union leaders who work for clothing factories in Haiti. After hearing about the hardships the workers face in order to survive, I asked one man what the most difficult aspect of the situation was. He answered me, “I continue to send my children to school and barely scrape up the money to cover the cost of their uniform, materials etc. But when my kids tell me that they are hungry, I have nothing to give them.”
In the case of the Indonesian workers, their factory owner fled with very small profit because he was los­ing money under the pressure of a subcontractor who has a deal with Adidas, as well as other prominent collegiate apparel corporations. Adidas is the only one that has refused to compensate these workers at this point. Moreover, the workers argue Adidas is largely responsible for the push to maximize profit at low cost that in many cases leads subcontracting companies to pressure factory owners to the point where they flee with the little money they have left. The situation at factories in Haiti as well as in Central American countries, Bangladesh and a few in Europe is similar. Many factories make apparel that is sold by Adidas for large profit while the workers’ salaries and benefits are scant. 
The Indonesian workers came all the way to Notre Dame to ask us to join them in a cry of solidarity: to ask Notre Dame to put Adidas on notice until they pay the Indonesian workers severance. These workers as well as the ones I met in Haiti present us with a common message: Their suffering is deeply connected to ours. If we can put time, money and resources into service initiatives, surely we can raise our voices to help achieve justice in a deal we have such a significant part in. The majority of clothing worn at our sporting events and parties is often made by the unfair sweat of another person’s labor, as the Indonesian workers reminded me. Their stories are directly connected to our stories. If our story is one of faith, we cannot ignore the unjust agreement we participate in as consumers of clothing produced by people who are regarded as no better than “machines to create more profit at lower costs.” 
Whether in the name of God, human solidarity or Notre Dame herself, we can join together to respond to this situation, demonstrating faith in something greater than ourselves: that we can help restore and protect the human dignity of workers who suffer from a contract we participate in. Such is the faith that will build a better world today. Faith is some­thing we must see and touch, and inevitably it will touch others. Right now, we are being touched by faith and called to respond. Our fellow human beings are crying for our help As a student body, we have the power to demonstrate the authentic faith of Notre Dame by responding to their plea in solidarity. If we hold Adidas accountable for paying these workers severance, others will recognize that our faith can be seen and touched. “That’s faith. This is Notre Dame.”

Obama’s manufacturing solution

For the past four years, Americans have been waiting for the solution to the economy they thought would have come sooner. Four years ago, in his first State of the Union address, President Barack Obama said that Americans had to “answer history’s call” in the light of a potential “second depression.” This time, as he entered the House chamber and looked in the television cameras for a fifth time, he focused on the idea that creating middle class jobs must be the “North Star that guides our (economic) efforts.”
While there are many important issues that face this country, I was pleased that the presi­dent brought up manufacturing. He said that Washington must “guarantee that the next revolu­tion in manufacturing is made in America.” With the Republicans reeling and looking to find support, Obama must strike a bipartisan agreement on the fiscal issues facing this country. Now is the time for Congress to finally make America a “magnet for jobs and manufacturing.”
Though there have been signs of erosion, the American manufacturing industry is still one of the largest in the world. A January 2012 Congressional Research Service report found that America’s share of global manufacturing activity has decreased in recent years. China’s manufacturing sector is almost as large as in the United States, valued at $1.814 trillion and $1.756 trillion respectively. In December 2012, the manufacturing sector made modest gains in manufacturing activity and factory hiring.
One of the common arguments related to manu­facturing thrown around recently is that American companies are outsourcing jobs to other countries because their labor laws allow manufacturing oper­ations to be more profitable. However, this is not as big of an issue as most Americans think it is. As the Bureau of Labor Statistics has found, the effect of outsourcing has been minimal. In the third quarter of 2012, when more than 100,000 workers were laid off, firms told BLS that less than 1 percent of these workers had their jobs moved to another country.
An article from The Atlantic reported that American companies are seeing the economic benefits of keeping jobs in America and have, in fact, started to “insource” jobs. China’s Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturing giant, is actually plan­ning on increasing their operations in the United States. American companies are realizing the ben­efits of keeping jobs in the United States, which will limit the effect that outsourcing will have on the economy.
On the other hand, what’s preventing companies from producing in the United States is the attrac­tiveness of production in other countries. Part of the issue is that the value of the dollar made producing goods in the United States less attractive than other countries with cheaper labor and production costs and lower marginal tax rates. If America wants to become more competitive in this regard, the federal government must be willing to create a plan that provides subsidies and “lowers tax rates for busi­nesses and manufactures that (will) create jobs right here in America.” This would help reduce the costs of production in the U.S., which would make companies more willing to attract new jobs without having to reduce workers’ salaries.
One point that President Obama has been stress­ing is that increasing our focus on alternative en­ergy will make America a stronger manufacturing country. According the Department of Energy, in August 2012 the wind sector was employing “75,000 American workers, including workers at manufac­turing facilities up and down the supply chain, as well as engineers and construction workers who build and operate the wind farms.” People are now feeling the benefits of alternative energy manu­facturing. On top of providing jobs, it will help Americans save money on energy consumption. This is the direction the manufacturing sector is going. If we fail to recognize the importance of al­ternative energy, America will fall behind.
Manufacturing is what has driven America over the past century. If we plan to give up on manufac­turing, we are throwing the future of this country away. But words can only go so far. This plan will not completely revive the American car industry or the steel industry. While it’s not complete, President Obama’s plan will make American manufacturing industry more competitive that it is today so that we can be authors of the next great chapter in our American story.

THE OBSERVER | THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2013 | NDSMCOBSERVER.COM


Earlier this month, Roc Nation artist J. Cole broke his silence and ended his brief hiatus from hip-hop with his newest effort, “Truly Yours.” The mixtape seeks to bring a “back to basics” approach, showcasing his rap style and lyricism while simultaneously highlighting his growth as not just a rapper, but also as a musician. While all the intentions were good, this was yet again another project from Cole that seems fine, but not good enough, especially from someone who had all the promise and approval from nearly everyone in the hip-hop sphere — from the fans all the way up to his fellow rap colleagues. 
It’s simply hard to believe that Cole, the rapper that was supposed to eclipse Jay-Z and strike the balance between the old- and new-school styles and innovate this particular genre of music, has proven time and again how unprepared he is to accept the torch he has been handed time so many times. After a supremely disappointing debut album “Cole World: The Sideline Story,” Cole was expected to come back with a vigor and hunger reminiscent of his second—and argu­ably best — work, “The Warm Up.” I anticipated that Cole would do even better for this simple reason: after dropping the ball so badly on his album (and I mean relatively badly, in comparison to what was expected), Cole has been — in many fans eyes, including my own—sidelined from the game of expectation. Thus all pressure has been off, as it should have been, because admittedly it was almost impossible to live up to the hype that Cole had thrust upon his shoulders. 
But it takes a man among boys to live up to these expectations, to live up to the hype and bear the weight on his shoulders, and as good as Cole has been, he has yet to be great. 
However, I found that this perspective has not stopped Cole from still acting like he’s not only great, but also the greatest.  “Truly Yours” is a simple, five track compilation that aims to let Cole shine, which I feel he does, to a fault. The introductory song, “Can I Holla At Ya,” is the epitome of this point. 
The song is not necessarily bad, as it features lone, honest strings of a guitar in the background, serving as the perfect complement to Cole’s style and sound. And Cole’s lyricism is still spot on, as he describes, “Bigger now but when she sends me a letter always write her back/ And time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon/ While she sees me go for mines and she admire that/ We speak about time as if we could just buy it back.” 
Cole still plays his role well, but he takes all of this too far, as it feels like Cole is just vibing to the song in all the wrong ways, constantly interjecting “Can I holla at ya?” almost non-stop, to the point of coming off as flashy and unnecessary. And unfortunately, this trend of “too much flash, not enough substance” persists throughout “Truly Yours.” 
Perhaps we’ll see more from a hungrier Cole, one who seems more ambitious and bent on returning to form. After all, this is the self-proclaimed “rap-form LeBron,” so perhaps we’ve yet to witness some maturity and greatness from within him.

In Leos Carax’s “Holy Motors,” we meet Mr. Oscar (Denis Lavant), an actor whose job is to be driven around Paris in a limousine and perform short scenes through­out the city for an unseen audience. Oscar is not a televi­sion or movie actor — instead he uses the real world as his stage. He appears to perform in front of hidden cameras, but really Paris and its residents serve as his audience, though they may not be aware that he is an actor at all. 
In some scenes, Mr. Oscar has help from other actors who admit to being part of his company, but for the most part, we are left to wonder whether others in the scene are fellow actors or real-life people reacting naturally to his character. At first it seems that the scenes are mostly unrelated, but as the movie continues Oscar referenced and even interacted with characters he portrayed earlier in the film. 
The wide array of characters allows the episodes to ex­pose the fleeting nature of human life is and the insecu­rities that we all have about what may come after death. The episodic nature of the film can be hard to track, but viewing the movie as the sum of its parts and not as sepa­rate unrelated episodes allows the movie insight into the human condition.
In order to play so many characters, Mr. Oscar uses prosthetics, costume accessories and even different lan­guages. The unique disguises that Mr. Oscar dons are so different it’s hard to believe there could be one actor portraying so many characters, and this helps to com­municate the various emotions and themes expressed in the film. Not only does Mr. Oscar perform as ten different characters throughout the movie, but he also performs in a breathtaking array of cinematic genres ranging from fairy tale and horror to dramatic musical and thriller. 
Mr. Oscar and some of his characters seem to express dread at the idea of dying, but in other instances show a contradictory sense of welcoming death and its myster­ies. The movie also expresses how tired we grow of our daily routines, and how disappointing it can be to realize that life has slipped through our fingertips. 
This film is great for those who like a movie that makes you think. It provides the audience with many more questions than it does answers and forces you to reflect about your life, the direction it has taken and the di­rection it will take in the future. Too often, movies lack the bountiful space for analysis that this type of film provides. “Holy Motors” is an interesting assortment of phantasmagorical episodes that provide the viewer with a new perspective on life. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for crazy journey in a film.

Let’s talk about Tyler Durden.
And why “Fight Club” couldn’t really make up its mind. It wanted to say something. It was dying to com­municate something to everyone about how backwards our modern society is. It was dying to voice the cure. It was dying to sell us some soap. (One of the film’s best image devices—Tyler Durden, the character who cleans everyone’s perception of modern reality, sells soap.) 
But by the film’s end, there are too many concerns on the table. It’s an experience similar to hearing three separate people say something at the same time. You have a vague idea what the issue is, but are more or less confused about everything else.
On October 15th , 1999, 77 days before the start of the 21st century, David Fincher released his fourth feature film “Fight Club,” a filmic adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk’s novel of the same name. It received medio­cre critic responses, but since has become one of the most celebrated films of the 1990s. The film is a fantastic realization of Fincher’s potential, and both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton give unforgettable performances. The content is raw, philosophical and challenging. Like all of Fincher’s pieces, it runs at high speed and features both the beautiful and the morally repulsive. It was the per­fect film to usher in our technological era.
However, as was previously mentioned, the film’s ethos is a little scattershot. The film opens with a won­derful critique of modern society. Edward Norton’s character, an unnamed narrator, lives a drab and ma­terialistic existence. He suffers from a horrible case of insomnia, but does not know what’s wrong. This is the film’s most successful thematic thread—the critique of modern materialism. This powerful theme can be summed up in one poignant delivery, supplied by Durden later on in the film: “You are not your job. You are not how much money you have in the bank. You’re not the car you drive. You are not the contents of your wallet.”
Durden (Brad Pitt) functions as the film’s engine for this philosophical insight. After a random explosion incinerates the narrator’s apartment, Durden reassures the narrator that his identity was in no way exclusively tied up in the apartment. In other words, the narrator is not what he owns, so he has no reason to fret that it all is gone.
So the narrator goes to live with Durden for a bit, and soon gets roped into Durden’s off-color lifestyle, stay­ing in a deserted house within a dilapidated part of town. Though their living situation is almost completely devoid of modern convenience, the narrator begins to realize that he is living the most fulfilling life he has ever lived.
But this is where it gets weird. For whatever reason, Durden, the narrator, and a bunch of other white and blue-collar American males who work out during the week and drink to excess on the weekend discover an alternative to the American materialistic lifestyle. They meet in the basement of bar and beat each other to a pulp. And the audience is somehow convinced that this is a good idea.
Furthermore, the film attempts to weave a third theme concerning the acceptance of mortality. It is somewhat related to the reason these guys beat each other up — they are trying to reach a point where no one can hurt them. Where they don’t fear death. Where they don’t fear pain … Okay, I’ll buy that. This is, after all, the philosophical space where the narrator overcomes his insomnia. But then there is the whole anti-materialistic bent, which the audience is forced to tie together.
When one watches “Fight Club,” it really doesn’t seem that messy. Fincher does a good job of weaving these themes together to form a clever ride. So, although the wise wouldn’t necessarily try to juggle all those themes in one film, a little overreaching has never signed a film’s death warrant. It all, more or less, works.
But I have a final problem with the film — it’s a bigger deal than the previous issues. And yes, this is a spoiler. So if you have never seen “Fight Club” and it sounds like its worth your time (I assure you it is), stop reading.
I take issue with the final twist. The revelation that Durden is the narrator, and vice versa. Why does Tyler Durden have to be a part of the narrator’s conscious­ness? Why further stretch the audience’s suspension of belief by convincing them that the narrator was some­how both of the film’s protagonists through the entirety of their interaction and the film? Where does that even get us? How is that related to materialism? To pain and death? To soap? Don’t think too hard about this. I assure you, it’s not related, in any way.
Wouldn’t the film be that much more powerful if Durden was a real person, capable of real change? Durden’s power becomes instantly limited as soon as we realize that his agency is restricted to the narrator. The psychological twist adds some pizzazz to a film that has already been pizzazz-ed as far as it can go. And the dramatic tension it creates, i.e. the narrator battling himself in an empty garage, isn’t that interesting or worth the confusion.
I would use the metaphor of the straw that broke the camels back, but this final psychological twist is far more than a straw. Its magnitude overcomes almost everything else the film has tried to do up until the end. It overpowers the themes and instead of wondering how we should respond to Tyler’s theory on life, we are forced into trying to figure out how the narrator man­aged to be two places at once. 
“Fight Club” simply has too much going on; it wants to say too much. Four separate films could have been made with all the themes and ideas presented, and Fincher gives us but one. Perhaps this is part of the film’s appeal. It can be approached from multiple angles; many interpretations of its tone can be made. But I suspect most fans are like me. They are always intrigued, and enjoy the ride, but are tongue tied when friends ask what the film is really “about.” We can’t make up our minds as to what to say first. And its then we realize that “Fight Club” couldn’t make up its mind either.

Kobe’s dominance says it all

49ers trade Smith to Chiefs


Associated Press

SAN FRANCISCO — Alex Smith quietly stayed behind the scenes after losing his job and watched from the sideline as San Francisco re­turned to the Super Bowl for the first time in 18 years. Yet the No. 1 overall draft pick from 2005 did make one thing known: The veteran quarter­back still considers himself a starter.	
And he hoped to get that chance again. Now, he appears to have it.
The Kansas City Chiefs have agreed to acquire Smith from the 49ers in the first major acquisition since Andy Reid took over as the team’s new coach in early January, a per­son with knowledge of the trade told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The person spoke on con­dition of anonymity because the deal cannot become offi­cial until March 12, when the NFL’s new business year be­gins. Another person familiar with the swap said the 49ers will get a second-round pick in April’s draft, No. 34 overall, and a conditional pick in the 2014 draft.
After spending his first eight up-and-down years with the 49ers, Smith will get a welcome new start. The Chiefs will get the proven play-caller they hope can help turn things around un­der a new coach much the way Smith did under Jim Harbaugh in San Francisco.
“You never know when your opportunity’s going to come,” Smith said late in the season. “The good ones are ready when they do come.”
The Chiefs have gone this route before, acquiring Joe Montana from the 49ers near­ly 20 years ago, in April 1993, after he won four Super Bowls but gave way to Steve Young — San Francisco’s quarter­back of the future.
Not so different from Smith’s situation last season behind second-year QB Colin Kaepernick.
Moving Smith was hardly unexpected. He realized it once Kaepernick emerged as a capable starter over the season’s final two months, and Smith all but said good­bye with his first pro team when he played briefly in the regular-season finale against Arizona to cheers of “Let’s Go, Alex!” and “Alex! Alex!” from the Candlestick Park crowd.
With Smith now headed for Kansas City, Matt Cassel is likely headed out of town. And Reid will enter his first draft as Chiefs coach in April no longer needing to search for a quarterback.
The Chiefs’ problems at quarterback are the single biggest reason they went 2-14 last season and secured the No. 1 pick in the draft for the first time in franchise history.
It’s been a long-running problem for a franchise that has tried Steve Bono and Elvis Grbac (two more one-time 49ers), and more recently Damon Huard, Tyler Thigpen and Tyler Palko at quarter­back. And then there’s Cassel.
He was acquired by re­cently fired general manager Scott Pioli, and has two years left on a $63 million, six-year deal. He will likely be cut once Smith is acquired.
Cassel was benched last season in favor of Brady Quinn, who also is a free agent after going 1-7 as the starter.
If Smith can bring the steady form that defined his last two years, the Chiefs might be able to establish a much-needed consistency under center. They also found themselves a team-first play­er who led the 49ers through workouts during the 2011 lockout.
Under the three-year con­tract he signed last March, Smith is guaranteed $8.5 million in base salary for the 2013 season.
Smith thrived under 49ers coach and former NFL quar­terback Harbaugh in one-plus season as the starter. Then, just like that, it all changed after he sustained a concussion.
Last week at the NFL com­bine, Harbaugh praised Smith and reiterated just how strong San Francisco was with Colin Kaepernick as the starter and someone with Smith’s cre­dentials at backup.
Yet everyone knew it was likely the 49ers would do their best to improve Smith’s situa­tion considering all he did for the franchise for nearly the past decade.


Editor’s note: This is the fourth in a 12-part series discussing the defining sportsman (or woman) of this century. In this installment, Matthew Robison argues for Kobe Bryant. Join the discussion on Twitter by using #DefiningSportsman.
In my book, in order to define an era athletes must display greatness throughout said era. To display greatness, athletes must win championships. No other player has displayed greatness and thus defined the 21st century better than Kobe Bryant.
Since 2000, no player in a team sport has won more champion­ships than Kobe. He won three straight from 2000-02 with the Lakers. Those who liked to knock Kobe say he couldn’t win a championship without Shaquille O’Neal. Shaq went on to win another championship in 2006 with Dwyane Wade and the Heat.
But three years later Kobe did it again, repeating with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010. His five championships set him far apart from his contemporaries.
Tim Duncan has four cham­pionships. Shaq also has four. Wade has two. LeBron only has one. In other sports, none of team sports’ great champions have reached Kobe’s number of five. Derek Jeter has five cham­pionships, but only two of those came this century. Jimmie Johnson has five consecutive Cup championships. But team athletics pose a host of factors that make it much more dif­ficult to win championships. For this century’s champions — in basketball or any other sport — Kobe is the proverbial measuring stick against which other champions must compare themselves.
Championships aside, Kobe’s entire body of work throughout his career simply adds to his monumental stature in athletic greatness. 
Allow me to rattle off some of Kobe’s other accomplishments:
He has two Olympic gold med­als. Twice he has earned the NBA Finals MVP. He’s won the NBA MVP award. He’s a 15-time NBA All-Star. Nine times he’s been se­lected to the NBA’s All-Defensive First-Team. As a rookie, he won the Slam Dunk Contest. He’s currently fifth all-time in scor­ing behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain. That’s pretty good company. By the time his career is over, he could pass both Wilt and Jordan.
It’s easy to make an extensive argument for Kobe’s greatness. Sure, he’s played alongside other future Hall of Famers during his championship runs. Yes, Phil Jackson, perhaps the great­est NBA coach of all time, was also with the Lakers during that time. It should also be noted that Derek Fisher was on all five of those championship teams, as well. Although he was a clutch player on those teams, I think it’s safe to say his greatness doesn’t exactly match up with Kobe’s.
But Kobe’s leadership, lack of physical dominance and clutch play set him apart. As a 6-foot-6 shooting guard, Kobe physically dominates no one. He doesn’t have the explosive­ness of LeBron James. He doesn’t have the high-flying capabilities Michael Jordan had. Nor does he tower over defenders like Shaq or Duncan. But Kobe does every­thing it takes to win – and win he has.
All in all, Kobe’s done just about everything to prove his greatness on the basketball court. A worldwide phenom­enon, the NBA is one of the most universally respected sports leagues and as the league’s best, he defines greatness in the NBA and therefore sports worldwide. 
Is Kobe the greatest basketball player of all time? Certainly not. Will he be considered the defin­ing athlete of the 21st century when people look back in 100 years? Probably not.
 But as this century’s most prolific champion in major team sports he has defined greatness, and therefore sports, in the 21st century.

PGA

Woods, McIlroy develop unexpected rivalry

Associated Press
PALM BEACH GARDENS — This is not the rivalry anyone had in mind when Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy began the year.
They made their debut in Abu Dhabi last month and both missed the cut. The next time they played in the same tournament was last week in the Match Play Championship, and both were eliminated in the first round.
The difference is that Woods returned to Torrey Pines the week after missing the cut. He left little reason for anyone to doubt his game when he built a lead that reached eight shots until the day dragged on and he won by four for his 75th career win on the PGA Tour.
McIlroy knew starting the year there would attention on his change from Titleist to Nike, and it only intensified with two bad results.
But the start of the Florida swing is no time to panic, and McIlroy sure didn’t sound wor­ried at the Honda Classic.
“It’s fine,” he said. “I knew coming into (the year) it was go­ing to be a bit of a process and I knew there was going to be com­ments if it didn’t happen for me right away,” McIlroy said. “I’m only two tournaments into the season. I’ve still 20 to go. So it’s not like I’m in any rush. It’s not like I’m pushing for answers. Everything is there. It’s just a matter of putting it all together.”
McIlroy put it together much sooner a year ago.
He was runner-up in Abu Dhabi, tied for fifth in Dubai, lost in the final of the Match Play Championship and then won the Honda Classic, mak­ing one clutch par save after another to hold off a late rally by Woods. McIlroy went to No. 1 by winning at PGA National, and he has been atop the world ranking since winning the PGA Championship.
How much longer he stays there depends on his game — and that of Woods, who is No. 2 and making up ground.
They are the featured play­ers as the Florida swing gets under way Thursday in the Honda Classic, a tournament that has been rejuvenated in recent years with a couple of significant moves. One was the site of the tournament to PGA National, which has hosted a PGA Championship and a Ryder Cup and makes for good televi­sion with so much water in play over the closing holes.
The other was a vast im­provement in the neighbor­hood. Woods moved to nearby Jupiter Island, while McIlroy, Lee Westwood and former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel are located at Old Palm just down the road. Keegan Bradley, Rickie Fowler, Dustin Johnson and oth­ers also have moved to south Florida.
It turned out to be the right recipe to get a good field, though Woods and McIlroy are at the top of the list, especially with the Masters getting closer.
Woods brings a little perspec­tive to whether there is reason to doubt McIlroy.
The Match Play Championship is the most unpredictable event in golf, and Woods is a great example of that. He is the only three-time winner, yet he has yet to make it out of the second round since his last win. Woods played bogey-free on a course that still had traces of snow and was beaten by Charles Howell III, who played even better.
“Generally if you’re miss­ing a cut, you’re probably not playing that well,” Woods said Wednesday after his pro-am round. “I actually played well, and only played one day. So I missed a few putts out there, but other than that, I really played well. And unfortunately, I ran into a guy who also played well — better than I did.”
McIlroy didn’t look sharp at all when he was eliminated by Shane Lowry. His weakness was iron play, leaving several shots out to the right. So was it his swing or his new equipment? The 23-year-old from Northern Ireland suggested a little of both.
“I guess it’s still an adjustment period,” he said. “It’s going to be a gradual thing. There’s obvious­ly a bit of an overlap there and you have to just try and get your way into it the best you can. But as I’ve said the last few weeks, it’s more about how I’m swing­ing the club. That’s the real con­cern — not concern for me, but I would like to get back to where I was the middle of last year. That’s the real thing I’m working on.”
Even so, the switch to new equipment has been a factor.
McIlroy took a big break at the end of the 2011 season, nearly two months before starting a new year. But with an equip­ment change, he only took a few weeks off before getting to the practice range with his new clubs. Somewhere along the way, he says some bad habits got into his swing.
He said the golf ball was an easier adjustment than he ex­pected. The driver was more difficult, though McIlroy is con­fident he has that dialed in.
Now it’s a matter of taking it to the golf course.
He is playing three times before he gets to the Masters — PGA National and Doral in back-to-back weeks, and then a two-week break before he plays the Houston Open.
Whether the Florida swing starts with the Honda Classic or Doral, as it once did, the feel of that warm, tropical breeze, palm trees, white bunkers and blue water hazards signal the first step toward the first major of the year. Only 34 players in the 144-man field are currently in the Masters.
The Honda Classic has five of the top 10 players in the world, including Westwood, Louis Oosthuizen and Justin Rose.

McCarthy bounces back from head injury

Associated Press
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Amanda McCarthy was a ner­vous wreck in the stands. Her husband was as calm as could be on the mound.
Brandon McCarthy me­thodically struck out four in two innings in his first game since a horrific head injury, an impressive return that overshadowed all else in the Diamondbacks’ 14-6 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday.
McCarthy, signed to a two-year deal by the Diamondbacks as a free agent, gave up one run on three hits. He had not taken the mound in a game since Sept. 5 when he was struck in the head by a line drive off the bat of the Angels’ Erick Aybar while pitching for Oakland. McCarthy sustained an epi­dural hemorrhage, brain con­tusion and skull fracture.
Reds ace Johnny Cueto, in his first start since he was injured early in last year’s playoffs, went two innings, al­lowing four runs, two earned, on five hits with a strikeout and a walk.
Amanda McCarthy, some­thing of a celebrity in her own right with more than 26,000 Twitter followers, had been unusually quiet on her Twitter account as game time approached.
“I was pretty nervous. I was kind of getting shaky,” she said. “My girlfriends were trying to distract me and talk to me. I’m not a very nervous person in general when he pitches, but obviously this is a unique situation.”
Then she watched her husband strike out Billy Hamilton, Joey Votto and Ryan Ludwick in the first inning.
The only blemish came when rookie center fielder Adam Eaton got a late break on Denis Phipps deep fly ball off McCarthy leading off the second and it went over his head for a triple. Neftali Soto brought Phipps home with a sacrifice fly, then Jack Hannahan was caught look­ing for McCarthy’s fourth strikeout.
“I felt my rhythm was good, my game pace was good,” McCarthy said, “all the things I’d like to have even later in spring I felt were good.”
The tall right-hander, work­ing to add a changeup to his repertoire, threw 31 pitches, 22 strikes.
“He was awesome,” his wife said. “Did he strike out like a million?”
McCarthy said he had no mental hurdle to clear and felt no more nervous than he did approaching any other spring training opener. He said he refuses to dwell on what was a life-threatening injury or even reflect on it, except when he is asked about it.
“I would assume it becomes less of a hot issue, less ques­tions about it, or at least they’ll kind of thin out, which is a good thing,” he said. “For me it really can’t get more be­hind me than it is, but just in terms of answering questions about it, it will probably go away. But I think I’ll always kind of be ‘that’ guy, to a point where that’s just one of the defining markers. I have to try and pitch well enough to get out of that but it will al­ways kind of be there.”
McCarthy joked that he might reflect a bit more if he goes on to have an outstanding career.
“That’s when you make a ton of money on the motiva­tional speaker’s tour. I’ll cash in then,” he said. “But other­wise I want it to be a footnote at best. It’s just something that happened, something that was scarier for the fans or my family than anybody else. That’s it for me. It was just a bad day and not a great pitch.”
There were no sharp come­backs to the mound for McCarthy to deal with, but he must know that will come.
“When that one came back straight that went way into center I thought he was go­ing to hit the deck, because I did,” his wife said. “But he looks good. I know that he knew what he was doing, and he wouldn’t get out there if he felt uncomfortable.”
Cueto, ordered by the Reds not to participate for the Dominican Republic in the World Baseball Classic that begins next week, made his first game appearance since he went down with a strained right oblique eight pitches into last season’s NL division series against San Francisco.
He brushed aside the re­sults and said he was just glad to be back on the mound and feeling good.
“That is just what I wanted to do, get out there and pitch to hitters,” Cueto said. “I threw about 40 pitches. I didn’t feel my oblique. I felt nothing in it. I gave up some hits but I was able to throw what I wanted to, thank God.”
The first of Aaron Hill’s two doubles drove in two runs off 
Cueto after three-time Gold 
Glove second baseman Brandon Phillips bobbled a double-play grounder in the opening inning.
A Reds lineup of mostly minor leaguers outscored its Arizona counterpart 13-2 over the last four innings.

Irish gear up for MAC matchup

By VICKY JACOBSEN
Sports Writer
Fresh off two close week­end wins, the Irish will host Western Michigan in a mid-week match-up today.
Irish coach Jay Louderback said No. 18 Notre Dame (7-3) will be ready for Western Michigan’s Mid-American Conference team that has got­ten used to winning.
“They’ve gone to the NCAAs by winning their conference quite a bit in the past 15 years, 20 years,” Louderback said. “A lot of the time they’re not real talented kids, but they play smart, they’re very well coached.”
The Irish have not had a smooth season on the dou­bles courts thus far, and the Broncos (6-5) could prove to be a challenge from the first point of the match.
“They always play good doubles,” Louderback said. “We’ve been up-and-down in our doubles. If we would not win the double point it makes things pretty interesting.”
Not that Notre Dame can’t close a deficit. The Irish came from behind to steal wins from No. 24 Baylor and Indiana last weekend, and have now clinched five matches by win­ning four of the possible seven points.
“I’ve never seen this many [comebacks] in a year,” Louderback said. “You could go five years without having as many matches as we have to come back from.”
The path Irish junior Britney Sanders took to ’ victory against Hoosiers senior and former All-American Leslie Hureau summarizesmimiced the trajectory of Notre Dame’s season. Sanders, who was named the Big East women’s player of the week Tuesday, dropped the first set and trailed 3-0 in the third set be­fore rallying to win 6-7 (3), 7-5, 6-4.
“You could see her con­fidence even though she was down 3-0 in the third,” Louderback said. “She still felt like she could win the match.”
As the Irish enter today’s match with confidence after clawing back from 3-0 deficits, the Broncos come to the Eck Tennis Pavilion on the heels of two close losses. Western Michigan lost to Michigan State and Illinois-Chicago over the weekend by identical 4-3 deficits.
Although the Broncos dou­bles pairings and coaching staff may challenge the Irish, Louderback said the unusual, mid-week timing of the match will not.
“We would be practicing that day anyway,” Louderback said.
The Irish return to the courts to face Western Michigan at the Eck Tennis Pavilion at 5 p.m. today.

BENGAL BOUTS

Yi fights for the sake of competition


By ALEX WILCOX
Sports Writer
Boxers love to fight. They love to trade blows with an opponent and salivate at the thought of a knockout.     Well, maybe not all of them.
“I’m actually not that big a fan of fighting,” junior captain Daniel Yi said.
This is not what you might expect to hear from a boxer and especially not from a two-time Bengal Bouts champion. But such is the case for Yi. 
Yi, a junior accounting ma­jor living in Sorin College, is a native of Bakersfield, Calif., where he grew up with his par­ents and two sisters.
Yi attended the small Garces Memorial High School and played football, soccer and tennis. Despite playing a wide range of sports, Yi said he al­ways loved football. “Our high school had maybe 750 kids to­tal and we would go up against the big schools in our area so we would get blown out by our rivals,” Yi said. “We were always the underdogs, but I had a great time. We never won anything significant, but we were always a competitive force.”
When he arrived on campus as a freshman in 2010, Yi con­tinued his athletic career at the interhall level.
“I heard about the whole in­terhall football thing and I was psyched about that, so I came here with full intention to play interhall,” he said. “It was great because my freshmen year … we had a pretty awesome team. We went to [Notre Dame Stadium] and beat Dillon, so my first year here we won the whole thing.”
During Yi’s sophomore and junior years, Sorin continued its success on the gridiron and made it back to Notre Dame Stadium both years. While Yi enjoyed being a part of interh­all sports, he said he the level of intensity didn’t match his competitive drive.“In the be­ginning, I was really looking for something to fill the void of [high school] varsity sports,” Yi said. “Interhall sports are super fun, but the level of com­petiveness just wasn’t there.
“With boxing, the promise of joining the boxing club is that you learn how to box, and you get in really good shape, so it didn’t seem like there was much of a downside.”
For Yi, there hasn’t been anything close to a downside as he has won the tournament in both years he’s participated.
“My freshmen year I won the [198-pound] weight class,” Yi said. “That year, I feel like I put in the most time, so it was great to win. My sophomore year, I was feeling a little heavy, didn’t want to cut weight, so I moved up to the heavyweight division. I viewed it as a really good challenge for me and I was able to win again.”
 This year, though, has brought a whole new set of challenges for Yi.
“The potential [to win] is definitely there,” Yi said. “It’s a little different this year. Everyone says junior year is the hardest in terms of course load and they really weren’t kidding.
“I feel like I was in better shape and had better endur­ance the past two years, but I think my boxing I.Q. has gone up and I’m a little calmer in the ring this year.”
While all boxers know the purpose of the tournament is to raise money for charity, Yi said a trip to Bangladesh this past summer with three fellow boxers really opened his eyes to the effects of the Bengal Bouts mission.
“All the money goes to the Holy Cross mission in Bangladesh and it just goes so far,” Yi said. “You raise $100 and it translates into $1,000 over there, so you’re doing so much. It’s such a great in­vestment. It’s such a great opportunity.”
Yi and fellow boxer and se­nior captain Pat Bishop spent six weeks teaching English to grade school children and Yi said the trip had a large impact on him.
“The thing I’ll never forget is the people that I met, whether it be my students — I call them my students even though I probably learned more from them than they learned from me — the teachers, the Holy Cross priests. It’s just the re­lationships,” Yi said. “It’s just crazy to experience a world so completely different, but you come to realize that the kids are basically the same. I think that was the greatest thing that I brought back.” 
With the trip to Bangladesh and the experience of two championships in the back of his mind, Yi said he knows he has what it takes to secure his third straight boxing crown in the heavyweight finals.
“I know what I need to do to win, and so it’s just about the execution at this point,” Yi said. “Hopefully my lungs will take me there. Hopefully I don’t get too tired and hope­fully I play it smart.”

coaches at Buena Vista High School in Saginaw, Mich., where he starred as a coveted recruit prior to suit­ing up for the Irish.
But as Jackson has quickly discovered, sometimes the growing process is depen­dent on the head coach. He made the decision to forfeit four games this season due to disciplinary issues with his team, which is 11-7 including the four forfeits.
“It wasn’t hard because they wouldn’t become suc­cessful off the court and they could just cheat through life,” Jackson said. “I don’t want to just be a coach who wins, but to see kids grow and maybe use it as a stepping stool to get a free scholarship like I did at a great university — one of the best in the country.
“Maybe they could take that same route and earn success and give back.”
Jackson hopes he can in­spire individuals to improve life in Saginaw, which was named the most violent city per capita in the United States in Jan. 2010 and has suffered an immense popu­lation loss for more than a decade.
“If I’m giving back, they can give back and the next person can to give our city a chance. It’s going to start with a group of us,” he said. “Maybe my kids can talk to their friends and do the right thing and I wouldn’t al­low them to cheat their way through and do some things that weren’t right.”
The transition from Saginaw to Notre Dame was at times a difficult one, Jackson said, but he depend­ed on members of the bas­ketball program to help him embrace the life of a Notre Dame athlete. He said sports information director Bernie Cafarelli was “a second mother” during his time at the University and credited the coaches with creating an ideal atmosphere for players.
“They made the whole tran­sition of going from an urban city where you get nothing but trouble to going some­where like Notre Dame [eas­ier],” he said. “The coaches helped me experience some­thing different. It was a lot of schoolwork trying to be suc­cessful off the court when I first got there and then [Irish coach Mike] Brey made it easy on the court.”
Jackson, who played in all 136 games during his four seasons with the Irish, was catapulted into the starting lineup early in his freshman season when former guard Kyle McAlarney was suspend­ed after his arrest for mari­juana possession. Jackson helped lead the program’s first charge into the NCAA tournament in four years and guided Notre Dame to two more before graduating.
“Coach Brey took the pres­sure off me and he just took it upon himself to let us play basketball and enjoy life, and it was by far one of the greatest experiences I’ve ever had,” Jackson said.
After he was undrafted by the NBA, he played in the NBA Development League for two seasons before returning to Saginaw to make a differ­ence in the city and with the players at his alma mater.
“Sometimes it’s tough,” said Jackson on transition­ing from player to coach. “I’m trying to figure out how to get them pumped up and not me too pumped up. It’s a lit­tle tough but it’s the fun part of it: trying to adjust, seeing how coaches would deal with me.
“I used to stress about me at times and figure out differ­ent things, but it’s been fun. The best part about it is when we win and see those guys smile.”
Sometimes figuring it out involves an unselfish deci­sion, not the easy one.
Jackson knows all about that.

WAKING THE ECHOES

ND WOMEN’S LACROSSE | ND 13, OSU 8

Jackson returns home

Midfield movement

After a slow start in the first half, Irish come from behind to beat the Buckeyes


By BRIAN HARTNETT
Sports Writer
For the second consecutive game, No. 7/9 Notre Dame struggled to score in the first half. Then junior midfielder Margaret Smith took over.
The Irish co-captain scored three consecutive goals in un­der three minutes late in the first half to put Notre Dame (2-0) ahead and the Irish re­mained in control from there, defeating No. 13/18 Ohio State 13-8 at Loftus Sports Center on Wednesday.
“I think [Smith] was a force to reckon with today, and she was absolutely the spark,” Irish coach Christine Halfpenny said. “If you could have heard her in the huddle, it was exactly what a coach wants to hear her leader do­ing, taking the team out there and saying, ‘Let’s finish this.’ She was just awesome today for all 60 minutes.”
Notre Dame looked at ease offensively in the game’s first few minutes, taking an early 3-1 lead. The Irish offense soon went cold, suffering a 15-minute scoreless drought during which as the Buckeyes (2-2) took a 4-3 lead.
Smith snapped the score­less streak with a goal at the 7:16 mark of the half. She add­ed another goal 58 seconds later to give the Irish a 5-4 lead and scored once more with 4:37 left in the half.
“[Ohio State] was definitely flooding the ball-side with double teams, and it was just a lot of my teammates finding me on the backside and al­lowing me to find two versus one opportunities,” Smith said. “Honestly, it could have been anyone in that position, since it was just us working together as a team.”
After Ohio State junior midfielder Cara Facchina cut the Irish lead to 6-5 with 1:32 in the first half, Notre Dame senior attack Betsy Mastropieri scored on a free position shot to give the Irish a 7-5 lead at halftime.
Smith said Halfpenny’s halftime message heav­ily stressed persistence on defense.
“[Halfpenny] just told us to keep working,” Smith said. “A lot of their goals were just the same thing and them finding the middle, so we needed to stick to our gameplan and do what we do.”
At the start of the sec­ond half, Notre Dame’s lead tightenedagain appeared to be . Ohio State cut the Irish lead to 7-6 and later 8-7 after Buckeyes freshman midfield­er Cian Dabrowski scored her third goal of the night.
But the Irish stifled the Ohio State attack, holding the Buckeyes to one goal over the final 25 minutes of the game.
Halfpenny said the team’s defense succeeded by sticking to its original plan in the second half.
“We didn’t make any ad­justments because we felt like what we were doing was working,” she said. “We knew it was going to be a slugfest, and we were prepared for that. We just had to really eliminate more of their sec­ond-chance opportunities in the second half than we did in the first.”
Notre Dame sealed the vic­tory by tallying five of the game’s final six goals to the five-goal victory.
Smith, who also scored the team’s second goal, fin­ished with four goals on the night. Senior attack Jaimie Morrison finished with six points, scoring two goals and assisting on four others, while Mastropieri added two goals. 
Halfpenny said she was proud of the team’s men­tal toughness and ability to come back for the second time in as many games.
“At the end of the day, it’s a long game,” she said. “All the girls know that, and we talk about it all the time. 60 minutes is a long time, so mistakes will happen and turnovers will happen, but we always look to get the ball back and stay resilient because I think the team has shown a lot of resilience at this young point of the season.”
Halfpenny said the victory over the ranked Buckeyes is a key win for an Irish team still looking to discover its identity.
“I think it’s a big confidence booster for our girls to know that everything you’re work­ing on works,” Halfpenny said. “They haven’t been able to see themselves against an outside opponent, so when you show up at game two against a highly-ranked op­ponents that’s very physi­cal and athletic — it’s a huge confidence boost to know that our gameplan works and that we can build off it.”
Notre Dame will return to action Saturday when it travels to Pittsburgh to face Duquesne.

Tory Jackson has always been unselfish.
Growing up as the second-youngest of 14 children, he learned to be patient.
As the starting point guard for four years at Notre Dame, he focused on finding his teammates in the right posi­tion to succeed.
Now, as a high school bas­ketball coach, his daily ef­forts are concentrated on putting young men in the right position to succeed.
“It’s fun to see them grow and go through the same things I was going through. That’s the best part about it,” said Jackson, a 2010 Notre Dame graduate who now behind Good. Casareto and Chiang will compete in the 1-meter dive today.
Meanwhile, the swimming squad swept the only other events of the day with victories in the 800-yard freestyle relay and 200-yard medley relay.
In the 800-yard event, sopho­more Emma Reaney and junior Kelly Ryan swam their legs of the relay with near identical times of 1:45.88 and 1:45.75, respectively, to build a large lead for the Irish. Sophomore Suzanne Bessire and senior Jamie Malandra then swam the final legs to lead the Irish to victory over second-place Villanova with a school-record time of 7:10.84.
Reaney also swam the sec­ond breaststroke leg in the 200-yard medley relay to help lead the Irish to a time of 1:38.74. Senior Lauren Scott set the pace by swimming the 50-yard backstroke leg. Senior Kim Holden and freshman Catherine Galletti closed with times of 23.40 and 22.59 to finish 0.60 seconds ahead of Louisville.
“[Holding first place after day one] is huge because it sets the tone for the remainder of the meet,” Chiang said. “To be able to start the next day with the adrenaline and momen­tum to carry into individual events will be big for our team.”
The Big East Championships continue at 10 a.m. today at the IUPUI Natatorium in Indianapolis. Individual events in the 1-meter dive begin the day, followed by freestyle and individual medley swims. The 200-yard freestyle relay con­cludes the second-day action.

Irish lead after Day One 

Notre Dame records historic day

By MATT UNGER
Sports Writer
On the first day of the 2013 Big East championships at the IUPUI Natatorium in Indianapolis, the Irish set the pace. Their 141 points leads the pack of 10 schools at the con­ference championships so far.
Led by senior Jenny Chiang’s victory in the 3-meter dive — the fourth consecutive 3-meter title in her Big East career — and two first-place relay finishes, the Irish raced to a 34-point lead over second place Louisville.
Chiang became the first diver in Big East history to win championships in the same event four years in a row. But her fourth title did not lack drama as she earned 329.85 points, beating out her Louisville competitor Hannah Good by just 0.85 points.
“It came down to the very last dive, which was good and bad,” Chiang said. “It was good to know that your competition is doing equally as well, but to be able to pull out ahead was just the cherry on top.”
Sophomore Allison Casareto took third in the 3-meter dive

Notre Dame got off to a quick start at the Big East championships at the IUPUI Natatorium in Indianapolis. The Irish scored 133 points in the opening day of the meet to put themselves in first place with a 95-point advantage over second-place Pittsburgh.
Though the first finals ses­sion included only three men’s events, Notre Dame saw no shortage of action.To begin the night, the 800-yard freestyle relay team of ju­nior Frank Dyer, sophomore Kevin Hughes and seniors John McGinley and Bill Bass claimed second place with a time of 6:23.40. They finished behind first-place Louisville by 1.07 seconds. With that time, the Irish relay team broke the school record and also earned an NCAA A-cut to automatically qualify for next month’s NCAA champion­ships. Irish coach Tim Welsh said the strong start sparked the Irish and set the tone for the rest of the evening.
“[I’m] fired up, excited and proud,” he said. “These were very strong performances to open the meet for us in both swimming and diving.  We went from ‘Go Irish’ to ‘Way to go, Irish!’”
The winning momentum continued for Notre Dame as the meet moved from the racing lanes to the spring­board. In the 1-meter dive fi­nals, sophomore Nick Nemetz captured second place with a score of 310.05 and fellow sophomore Michael Kreft took fourth place with 300.35 points. With those scores, the pair joins the 800-free relay in qualifying for NCAAs.
But arguably the biggest moment of the night for the Irish came in the session’s final event, the 200-yard medley relay. The quartet of freshman Bogac Ayhan, sophomore Cameron Miller, Dyer and sophomore Zach Stephens sprinted to first place in 1:26.33. The re­lay set a new school record, earned an NCAA A-cut and claimed Notre Dame’s first title of the meet. The Irish had never before won the 200-yard medley at the Big East championships.
Welsh said that the two ad­vancing relays contributed to a “very excited” atmosphere it the natatorium.
“We had thought that both relays did have a chance to qualify and that it would take strong swimming from every­one on each relay [to qualify],” he said. “Accomplishing that was exciting and motivating for all of us.”
The Irish will look to con­tinue their streak of success today in the second day of competition. In the 500-yard freestyle, Dyer holds the No. 1 seed and is followed by sev­en teammates in spots four through 10. Notre Dame also hopes to swim well in the 200-yard individual medley with a team comprised of four swim­mers seeded in the top seven. Dyer’s qualifying time in the 50-yard freestyle places him third in a close field and Notre Dame will also try to jump No. 1 seed Louisville in the 200-yard freestyle relay. Diving takes a day off and resumes Friday with the three-meter event.
Welsh said he thinks the strong results in all three events of the opening day will help the Irish continue their push toward claiming a second-straight Big East championship.
“They are ready to do very well, and tonight verified that for all of us,” he said. “[We’re] excited and eager to move on to tomorrow’s events.”
Notre Dame moves to day two of the Big East champi­onships with prelims com­mencing at 10 a.m. today at the IUPUI Natatorium in Indianapolis.
