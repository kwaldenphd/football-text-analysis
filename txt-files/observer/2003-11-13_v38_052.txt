Chinese filmmaker shows work 
By BETH ERICKSON 
News Writer 
Over 300 students and fac­
ulty members attended the 
screening of Li Yang's contro­
versial film "Blind Shaft" in 
DeBartolo Hall Wednesday 
night. The Chinese filmmak­
er, who visited campus for 
the event, responded to ques­
tions after the showing. 
The film, which addresses several different humanitari­an issues, was shot in China illegally without government approval. International view­ing of the film is prohibited by China, but this marked its second screening in the United States. 
"Blind Shaft" was not origi­nally produced as a political commentary, but rather as a presentation of various hun:Janitarian issues preva­lent in modern China, Yang said. 
The documentary-style film portrays the destitution of rural China, a country in which 200 million people reside below the poverty line. It also depicts the squalid working conditions of Chinese coalminers, of whom more than 10,000 die each year in work-related acci­dents. 
Yang examines the relation­ship between wealth and ethics in his film, juxtaposing moralistic consciousness with a drive for materialism. As wealth increases in China, this contrast becomes more and more pronounced, Yang

suffered heart attack 
By MEG HAN MARTIN 
Associate News Editor 
An autopsy conducted by the St. Joseph County coroner's office Monday concluded that Roger Bailey, the fan who was found collapsed in a stadium restroom before Saturday's game, died of a heart attack, said St. Joseph County Deputy Coroner Dr. Michael O'Connell. 
"It was a natural death. More than likely, it was cardiac," O'Connell said. 
Bailey, who was 49, was found on the floor of an upper-level men's room in Section 123 shortly after gates officially opened. 
Stadium ushers and medical crews responded quickly to the emergency, said Director of Stadium Security Cappy Gagnon. 
He was transported. accompa­nied by a brother, from the sta­dium to the St. Joseph Regional Medical Center, where he died at 3:15p.m. 
Bailey was president and part­ner of Lumberyard Suppliers in East Peoria, Ill. and was was visiting Notre Dame with some of his family from Mapleton, Ill., a small town 13 miles southwest of Peoria.

My flush with destiny 
I call it my flush with destiny. The day I 
watched my cell phone swirl down to the 
deep dark abyss. 

I know many of you are thinking: hpw 
in the world can you flush a cell phone 
down the toilet? 
Well. it is possible 

Allison Nichols 
and actually a lot 
easier than you 
would think. 

Photo
Last Monday I 
stopped by the rest­
room on my way to 

dinner. The two things I always have on 
me are my ID key ring and my cell phone. 
But I wasn't talking on my phone in the 
bathroom. That is disgusting. It was in my 
sweater pocket, which seems to have 
been my fatal error. 

After I pulled the handle and was 
unlatching the door, I suddenly heard a 
plunk. I turned around, and at first I did­
n't see a thing. 

Then, amongst the thrust of water in 
the bowl. a quick silvery glimmer caught 
my eye. 

Oh my God, was my cell phone actually 
in the toilet? 

I admit I hesitated. I totally wasn't 
expecting that to happen. 

Just as I came to the realization of what 
was happening, my hands skimmed the 
surface. and the cell phone swirled out of 
sight. 

I stood there shocked for a few 
moments, waiting for the cell phone to 
magically r~appear. 

I thought, there is no way that a cell phone could go down those pipes .. 
Seriously, my cell phone wasn't that 
small. When nothing appeared after some 
time, there was nothing to do but laugh 
hysterically. 

You see, the past night I had gotten some bad news and didn't sleep much at all. I begrudgingly woke up Monday morning to the bitter cold and trudged through the rest of my day contemplating why life seemed to be so awful to me. 
The next evening came, and I thought, "Alright, the day is almost over." 
Then the most unexpected thing hap­pened. Just when you think nothing worse could happen to you, something else occurs to make you rethink that statement 
Instead of flying into a rage at all my misfortunes, I smiled and laughed. 
I know God wanted me to take things a little more lightly, and that was what he came up with to make me laugh. 
Strange, I know. but it was my destiny to flush that cell phone down the toilet. It was no mere accident; it was meant to be. 
After informing the maintenance department and the front desk, I proceed­ed to tell my friends who also laughed hysterically. 
We spent the evening conjuring up witty jokes and scenarios of where my phone might be or where it may emerge in the future. 
Only I could have done something so idiotic, but, as always, there is a moral to the story. 
A little laughter can go a long way, and you can think to yourself. at least I'm not stupid enough to flush my cell phone down the toilet like that girl.

Spam clogs Internet's arteries 
SAN JOSE, Calif. -Three years ago, Adam Kalsey set up a Web log to share his thoughts about online busi­ness and the digital revolu­tion. Like countless other 'bloggers,' he lets his read­ers post comments on his entries. 
Recently, his site has been getting remarks like 'Thanks for the informa­tion!' and 'Sounds great!' They're not from support­ers, but from people -or machines -who leave names like 'Generic Viagra,' 'Online Gambling' and 'Free Poker' and links to unsa­vory sites. 
Spam has never been lim­ited to e-mail. But now, commercial pitches are increasingly popping up in online chats, instant mes­sages, cell phones with text messaging and, as Kalsey found, Web Jog comments. 
Spammers are flocking to new communications tools like moths to light, threat­ening to cripple these tools just as they are beginning to take off. 
Howard Rheingold, a futurist who predicts always-on communication will revolutionize public dis­course, is worried that all these new forms of spam could freeze the revolution in its tracks. 
'Bluejack.ing' new cell phone craze 
STOCKHOLM. Sweden ­The group of lanky tourists strolling through knew what hit them. 
As they admired Swedish handicrafts in a storefront window, one of their cell phones chirped with an anonymous note: 'Try the blue sweaters. They keep you warm in the winter.' 
The tourist was 'blue­jacked' -surreptitiously surprised with a text mes­sage sent using a short­range wireless technology called Bluetooth. 
As more people get Bluetooth-enabled cell phones -both sender and recipient need them for this to work -there is bound to be more mischievous mes­saging of the unsuspecting.

SENATE 
Group appoints two members to Council 
By MAUREEN REYNOLDS 
News Writer 
The Student Senate appointed two senators as alternates to the Council of Hepresentalives at Wednesday's meeting. 
Knott senator Brian Agganis and Cavanaugh senator Jordan Bongiovanni were unanimously approved as alternates to the Council. 
The Council of Hepresentatives passed a resolution at its meeting Monday which called for the for­mation of a committee to "consid­er attnndance in ethics, including . . . proper representation of the students by the members of the Council of Hepresentatives." The resolution states that the reason for this committee stems from the faet that the Council "is yet to con­stitute its bylaws regarding ethics and attendance." 
Until proper attendance policies for the Council are decided, the resolution provides for each organization within the Council to send an alternate in the event that their elected Council repre­sentative is unable to attend a meeting. When sent as a repre­sentative for their organization, an alternate will have full voting privileges at meetings. 
Keenan Senator Dan Zenker, one of four Senate representatives on the Council, said the alternates provide for full Senate represen­tation at Council meetings and also ensure that Senators will not be countnd absent from Council nwr.tings. 
"Each member gets three unex­cusnd absences, but now if we don't go, one of the alternates can go, and we don't get an unex­cused absence," Zenker said. "They also take all of our voting power with them to the meet­ings." 

The Council's resolution did not mandate that alternates had to be officially appointed, but Zenker said he thought electing alter­nates was a good idea. 
"We just wanted to make sure that the Senate had official alter­nates. Now, we can keep them updated on what's going on [in the Council]." 
In other Senate news 
+ Pasquerilla West Senator Jana Lamplota reported to the Senate that a meeting with Bill Kirk, associate vice president for Residence Life, regarding the Senate-sponsored petition to move the ROTC Presidential Pass in Review ceremony to an outdoor location will occur Tuesday. The Senate will present its petition to Kirk in order to show the amount of student support for the transfer of the ceremony from Loftus to a proposed South Quad location. 
+ The Senate Committee on Ethics issued new attendance rules to senators Wednesday. These rules include mandatory attendance records for all Senate committee meetings, and 24-hour notice from any Senator missing a committee meeting. The rules stipulate that Senators who reach four unexcused absences from a committee meeting or four absences from full Senate meet­ings will receive a written warn­ing from the Ethics Committee. At five absences, the Ethics Committee will meet to determine a course of action to be taken in the matter.

Teach for America influences campus 
By AMANDA MICHAELS News Writer 
Fourteen years after the con­ception of Teach for America, hundreds of similar organiza­tions have been chartered to help combat illiteracy and raise the level of education in the United States and around the world. 
The Center for Social Concerns is a clearinghouse for many such programs, connect­ing students interested in dedi­cating their post-graduate years to service. 
Programs modeled after the Alliance for Catholic Education, which decided to help others start similar organizations rather than expand its own, are among such large-scale service projects. While ACE is still the most popular teaching service organization on cam­pus, such groups as the Pacific Alliance for Catholic Education, the Providence Alliance for Catholic Teachers and a variety of others attract as many as five graduates each year. 
With 168 graduates in serv­ice, two-thirds of those ND/SMC students, ACE is by far the most popular post-grad service organization for Domers. Established by Father Tim Scully and Father Sean McGraw in 1994, ACE provides an intensive program that allows students to work toward their Masters of Education degree in the summer, while accruing hands on experience as full-time teacher during the school year. 
ACE teachers receive health insurance, a monthly stipend, travel reimbursement and an education award of $4,725 from Americorps, said Andrea Smith Shappell, director of sen­ior transition programs for the 
esc. 
Seventy-seven percent of ACE teachers stay in education after the required two years, and 56 percent of those stay in K-12, with the rest becoming coaches or principals or taking other education-related occu­pations, said Christian Dallavis, associate director of ACE. 
"About 10 percent of seniors apply to ACE each year," said Dallavis, "and what I think it comes down to is an interest in teaching others and the desire to do service." 
The success of the ACE and Teach for America projects has spawned a number of other long-standing teaching pro­grams, through which volun­teers are able to earn credits toward a Masters degree. The Inner-City Teaching Corp in Chicago, Hesponse-Ability in Philadelphia and other loca­tions around the country and Teach for America are exam­ples of such organizations. 
The national movement of the Nativity Prep Academy, whose mission it is to provide tuition-free education to at­risk, impoverished children also draws graduates to one of its many locations -the most popular of which is San Diego. David Hivera, a 1999 Notre Dame graduate, founded the organization.

Bush approval rating rises 
More Americans approve ofeconomy handling than two months ago 
Associated Press 
Public approval of President Bush's handling of the economy has increased amid signs that the economy is recovering, according to a poll out Wednesday. 
Half in the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, 50 percent, approved of Bush's handling of the economy, up from 43 percent who approved two months ago. 
Bush's overall job approval was at 51 percent, with 44 percent not approving. That's largely unchanged from that same poll two months ago -when he was at 49 percent. 
Recent economic reports have shown the nation's growth rate is up, while unemployment claims are down -factors which appear to have helped his strength on that measure. 
Bush's overall job approval rating has ranged from 50 percent to the mid 50s in several recent polls. 

The increased optimism about his handling of the economy comes at the same time skepticism about his handling of Iraq has been rising. 
Attacks against U.S. troops are increasing and a new intelligence report suggests that Iraqis are losing faith in U.S.-led occupation forces, a development that is increas­ing support for the resist­ance. 
Almost two-thirds, 63 per­cent, still support the mili­tary action against Iraq, but when asked if that action has been worth the costs -peo­ple were evenly split. 
The poll of 1,003 adults was taken Nov. 8-10 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percent­age points.

the early days ofTFA. 
Mobil Corporation provided her with a seed grant of $26,000, and after 11 letters, Ross Perot fmally agreed to put up a challenge grant of$500,000. 
"I was blessed with absolute naivete and inexperience," said Kopp. "I believed that if we could show them that college students were interested in the program, everything would fall into place. If I had started this campaign know­ing what I know now, Teach for America might not be here today." 
Kopp said the components of the organization's five-year plan are to grow to 4,000 corps mem­bers, to do more to insure that corps members have the greatest impact possible and to keep alum­ni connected. 
"We are focused on staying the course, and so far, we're on track," said Kopp. 
However. she did address the recent stumbling block placed in front of TFA. On July 11, Kopp received a letter stating that TFA was no longer an AmeriCorps program, meaning a Joss of 5 per­cent of their operating budget, the loss of $15 million in educational grants and an elimination of guar­anteed loan deferment used as incentives to recruit top college graduates. 
"It definitely has been a chal­lenging few months, but we were really able to weather it," said Kopp. "We're still trying to find federal and private funding to replace our loss. but we think we'll be able to defer loans, pay interest and get our teachers the money we promised them." 
Kopp described the problems affiicting America's school system, especially the gap in performance that runs along socioeconomic lines. Students born in low-income communities are as far as three to four grade levels behind by the time they finish elementary school and are seven times less likely to graduate from college. she said. 
"Ultimately, more teachers going above and beyond is not going to be sufficient. We need to solve this problem as a country. We need to improve the economy and quality of life in these urban and rural areas, and improve the school system. This is going to take informed, committed leader­ship, and that's what we hope we're developing at Teach for America," said Kopp. 
Out of the 16,000 applicants for positions in TFA last year. only 1,800 were selected. Kopp said that they look for someone with the leadership skills to take on a monumental task and to deal with the problems the corps members find themselves up against every day. 
Before TFA campus representa­tive Erica Burroughs concluded the event, Kopp posed a challenge to the students in attendance. 
"We can get there. we can get to the point where kids have equal education, no matter where they're from," she said. "The question is whether the leaders, the young, well-educated, com­mitted leaders, will step up and take charge."

Troop, media relations sour 
BAGHDAD. Iraq -With casualties mount­ing in Iraq, jumpy U.S. soldiers are becoming more aggressive in their treatment of jour­nalists covering the confiict. 
Media people have been detained, news equipment has been confiscated and some journalists have suffered verbal and physical abuse while trying to report on events. 
Although the number of incidents involving soldiers and journalists is diflicult to gauge, anecdotal evidence suggests it has risen sharply the past two months. 
The president of the Associated Press Managing Editors, an association of editors at AP's more than 1.700 newspapers in the United States and Canada. sent a protest let­ter to the Pentagon on Wednesday urging oflicials to "immediately take the steps to end such confrontations." 
"The effect has been to deprive the American public of crucial images from Iraq in newspapers, broadcast stations and online news operations." wrote Stuart Wilk, manag­ing editor of The Dallas Morning News. 
Colombia's armed forces chief quits 
BOGOTA. Colombia -His voice cracking with emotion. Colombia's gruff armed forces commander said Wednesday that he is quit­ting his post. adding his resignation letter to a growing pile on the desk of hard-line President Alvaro Uribe. 
In the past week, three Cabinet ministers, the head of the Colombian National Police and four other senior police officials have resigned under pressure following the defeat of political reforms that Uribe said were needed to light leftist rebels and crack down on corruption.

Senate debates judicial nominees 
WASHINGTON -With humor, anger and a show of GOP unity. the Senate on Wednesday launched 30 hours of uninterrupted debate on President Bush's political nominees not mak­ing it to the federal appeals bench. setting up cots and preparing to cast blame at each other throughout the night. 
Most of Republicans marched into the Senate together just before 6 p.m.. sat down and listened to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn.. open the debate by condemn­ing the filibusters. 
"Tonight we embark upon an extraordinary session," Frist said. "For the next 30 hours Hepublicans and Democrats will debate the merits of three judicial nominees. We will be considering the meaning of our constitutional responsibilities to advise and consent on nom­inations. We will discuss whether there is a need to enact filibuster reform so that nomi­nations taken to the floor can get a vote." 
Democrats, some appearing amused by the pomp and circumstance, were already in the Senate chamber waiting for the beginning of the debates. The Senate had just finished a vote. and many of the GOP senators had to leave the chamber just to be in the group marching back in. 
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. held a sign he displayed for television cameras and passing Republican senators as they entered the chamber: "I'll be home watching 'The Bachelor."'

The Nasiriyah attack was the deadliest against an American ally since the occupation began and appeared to send a mes­sage that international organizations are not safe anywhere in Iraq. It came on the same day the chief 
U.S. administrator for Iraq went to the White House to put forth proposals on transferring more authority to the Iraqis. 
Col. Gianfranco Scalas said 18 Italians were killed: 12 Carabinieri paramilitary police. four soldiers, a civil­ian working at the base and a documentary filmmaker. A spokesman for the U.S.­led coalition said at least eight Iraqis also died. The bomber -whose nationali­ty was not known -also died. 
The blast wounded 79 people, 20 of them Italians, hospital sources and Italian officials said. 
Italians were stunned by their nation's single worst military loss since World War II and its first in the Iraq campaign. At Rome's tomb of the unknown sol­dier, the green-white-and­red flag rippled at half-staff, and parliament held a minute of silence. 
Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi pledged that Italy's mission in Iraq would not be derailed. Opposition leaders who opposed the deployment to postwar Iraq called on the government to withdraw the contingent. 
Jalal Talabani, the head of the Governing Council, called the slain Italians "martyrs of the fight for the freedom of Iraq." 
There were conflicting accounts of the attack, which took place about 
10:40 a.m. at a three-story building used by the Carabinieri's multinational specialist unit in Nasiriyah, 180 miles southeast of Baghdad. 
Witnesses said the decoy car ran a roadblock in front of a square where the Italian barracks was locat­ed. Guards opened fire but as the vehicle sped away, the fuel tanker approached from the opposite direction and rammed into the gate of the building before exploding. 
Italian Defense Minister Antonio Martino said the truck. followed by an armored car, approached the compound at high speed. Gunmen inside one of the vehicles opened fire at Italian troops guarding the entrance, he said. The guards returned fire, but the vehicle plowed through the gate, and then explod­ed, he added. 


It was the 13th vehicle bombing in Iraq since Aug. 7, when a car exploded at the Jordanian Embassy in Baghdad, killing at least 19 people. Wednesday's blast from the estimated 650 pounds of explosives col­lapsed all three stories of the building, gouged a 6­foot-deep crater in front of it, and set fire to parked cars. Secondary explosions from stored ammunition shook the area. 

The scorched, twisted remains of military jeeps lit­tered the parking lot, and bulldozers cleared rubble. Chunks of concrete and wiring hung from partly destroyed walls. 
"This is terrorism, pure and simple," Scalas said. 
After nightfall in Baghdad, forces from the 1st Armored Division attacked a warehouse used by insurgents. setting off explosions that reverberat­ed through the capital. 
"The facility is a known meeting, planning, storage and rendezvous point for belligerent elements cur­rently conducting attacks 
on  coalition forces  and  
infrastructure,"  the  
Pentagon said.

For instance, Hoffman said that during her freshman year, a math professor refused to provide her with a copy of the notes from the overhead projector, and she had to switch to another class. 
Generally, Hoffman has access to large-print materials and is given extra time to complete exams, but ran into different problems when taking the LSAT this year. 
"They require very extensive documentation. I'd heard they weren't very disability-friendly," she said. 
Initially, Hoffman's request for extended time was denied, and then ultimately granted, just days before she was scheduled to take the test. 
"It's something that a student with a disability shouldn't have to go through," she said. 
Disabled students said they would like to see themselves included in the University's defi­disabled has jumped from 35 to 170, said Scott Howland, the Office's director. 

When a student identifies him or herself as having a disability, Howland's office works with the student to provide adaptations for class schedules and in the resi­dence halls. 
"Everything is very individual­ized. It depends not only on the disability but on how the student compensates for it," he said. 
Currently, Howland runs the Office for Students with Disabilities by himself, despite the fact the number of registered stu­dents has increased about five­fold over the past eight years. 
Students said they are highly impressed with Howland's dedica­tion to their needs, but expressed concerns about the priority the University places on helping stu­dents with disabilities. 
"I see him about two to three times per week," said Van Schoick. "He works so hard." 
But since the University moved Howland's office from the front to the back of Badin Hall, Van Schoick said she can't even fit her

Despite using a wheelchair and having a speech impairment, sophomore FTT major Katrina Gossett has enjoyed being a part of the Pasquerilla East Musical Company at Notre Dame. In PEMCO and at residence hall masses, Gossett has distinguished herself with a talented singing voice and stage presence. 
"Last year I performed in the Musical Revue," she said. ''I'm assistant stage manager [for PEMCO]." 
Along with her theatre interest, Gossett also serves as a math teaching assistant and runs help sessions for her students.

Because of the increasing strain placed on the resources for dis­abled students, Van Schoick s~id she intends to write a letter to the Office of the Provost, which over­sees Howland's office. 
"I don't know that I would apply to this school now," she said. 
According to Howland, he can­not provide students with a wide range of services, such as social counseling and career develop­ment, but focuses mainly on procuring special materials and services for them. 
"It's difficult to do some of these additional things," he said. "We probably fit somewhere in the middle [compared to Notre Dame's peer institutions.]" 
Although some top 20 universi­ties maintain single-person staffs, Howland said many schools rely on three to four people to provide disability resources.

Congress nears Medicare agreement 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Republican congressional leaders stepped to the brink of agreement Wednesday on major Medicare legislation to create a pre­scription drug benefit for older Americans and carve out a vast new role for private insur­ance companies in the govern­ment-run health care pro­gram. 
"I think it's a middle-of-the­road deal," s.aid Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana, the first Democrat to swing behind the proposal after Republicans scaled back their demand for competition between tradition­al Medicare and the private plans. 
GOP congressional officials said the administration was ready to embrace the agree­ment, and President Bush was scheduled to discuss Medicare at an appearance in Florida on Thursday. GOP leaders said they also expected the backing of the politically influential AARP, with 35 million members age 50 and over. 
There were critics aplenty, though, and some Democrats began an immediate effort to limit defections and defeat the measure on the Senate floor. 
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota attacked it. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., referring to the remaining require­ment for direct competition, said, "We can't accept a pro­posal that's going to threaten the whole Medicare system." 
Additionally, officials said Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the lead House negotiator in months of arduous bargain­ing, objected to the terms

that Frist, Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R­Texas, had blessed. 
Apart from the drug benefit and new system of private health care, officials said the measure would include steps to ease the availability of lower-cost generic drugs. On another point, though, no change was expected in the ban on the importation of brand name prescription drugs from Canada and other countries where they often sell more cheaply than in the United States. Current law requires the Food and Drug Administration to certify the medicine's safety before imports are allowed. 
In a gesture to conservatives, the legislation would also ere-ate new health-related tax accounts for individuals pur­chasing high-deductible health insurance. It also would estab­lish an unusual requirement for the president and Congress to review Medicare's finances if the cost of the program grows more than expected. 
The breakthrough in negoti­ations occurred Tuesday night, when Frist met privately in his Capitol office with Breaux and Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, the two Democrats who have been permitted to participate in House-Senate negotiations dominated by Republicans. 
The Tennessee Republican dropped a long-standing demand for an open-ended program of competition, and offered to limit it to selected portions of the country.

IN BRIEF 
Dollar slides versus European majors 
NEW YOHK-The U.S. dollar weakened sharply against the major European currencies Wednesday as dealers turned their attention to technical factors and away from economic fun­damentals. 
Short-term. speculative and model-driven accounts aggressively sold the dollar down through key technical levels against the euro.. which triggered waves of stop-loss selling. 
The Swiss franc was the other main benefici­ary as the market dumped dollars across the board. which pushed the greenback down to fresh six-year lows against the Australian and New Zealand dollars and a new 10-year low against the Canadian dollar. 
Heightened tensions in Iraq, where a bomb attack killed at least 26 at an Italian police base, was the excuse some dealers used to explain the euro's strong rally. 
The euro's convincing break above $1.1550 was a crucial development, as was its subse­quent break above $1.1600 and impressive rebound from the 10-month low of 124.41 yen plumbed Tuesday. 
In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1633, up from $1.1509 late Tuesday. The dollar was quoted at 108.75 yen, up from 
108.67 yen late Tuesday. The dollar was quoted at 1.3502 Swiss francs, down from 1.3620, and 1.3025 Canadian dollars. down from 1.3122. The British pound rose to $1.6733 from $1.6651. 
EU appeals to U.S. to drop tariffs 
GENEVA -America's allies appealed to President Bush on Tuesday to back off support for the U.S. steel industry or risk billions of dollars in sanctions that could spark a global trade war. 
Members of the European Union are threat­ening to impose retaliatory sanctions on $2.2 billion worth of U.S. imports unless Bush removes duties on imported steel he intro­duced in March 2002 to give breathing space to the embattled U.S. steel industry. 
"As frank and loyal friends of the United States, we hope that Washington will remove as soon as possible the steel tariffs that are considered illegal by the World Trade Organization," said Adolfo Urso, Italy's Industry Ministry undersecretary.

Stocks bounce back after 3-day decline 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Wall Street broke out of its slump Wednesday, surging higher after a forecasted jump in semiconductor sales gave investors a reason buy after three days of declines. The Dow Jones industrials rose more than 110 points, while the Nasdaq composite index gained more than 2 percent. 
Larger-cap stocks led the day, including technology bellwethers IBM Corp. and Intel Corp., which benefit­ed from the Gartner Inc. forecast. Traders attributed some of the momentum to the week's slow start; the bond markets were closed Tuesday for Veterans Day. Many investors were returning to Wall Street after a long weekend, with money to spend, said Brian Belski, fundamental market strategist at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 
"Investors this year have condi­tioned themselves to buy the dip, and today they saw an opportunity," Belski said. "We're in a little bit of a news vacuum ... so right now they're going to react to any news blip at all." 
The Dow ended the day up 111.04, or 1.1 percent. at 9,848.83. 
The broader gauges also closed higher. The Nasdaq closed up 42.36, or 2.2 percent, at 1,973.11. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 
11.96, or 1.1 percent, to close at 
1,058.53. 

The market appears to be in a "consolidation phase ... with shallow pullbacks met with buying" said Peter Cardillo, president of Global Partner Securities Inc. 
"Once the consolidation phase is over I think the second leg of this bull run will commence," Cardillo said. "That will probably take us up to new highs by the end of the year." 
Fueling Wednesday's tech rally, market research firm Gartner said it expects worldwide semiconductor sales to increase more than 20 per­cent next year. Chipmaker Intel rose 69 cents to close at $34.10. IBM Corp. also made gains, rising $1.33 to $90.69.

and politics is

key. However, it is critical not to give faith a role-it doesn't belong in foreign relations. 
America is founded on John Locke's premise that all are born with certain inalienable rights. His arguments are logical to Americans of any faith. However, it is seldom mentioned that Locke was a Christian theologian. His views and our nation were shaped accordingly. Since its inception, America has fused Judea-Christian principles into politics in an unprecedented manner. The effort becomes complicated then when America tries to import this democracy into countries such as Iraq. 
Last week President Bush said, "It should be clear to all that Islam, the faith of one-fifth of humanity, is consistent with democratic rule." 
The Arab world has much to gain from a political system other than autocracy, but Bush still has his work cut out for him. Unlike America, Middle Eastern countries are unable to find a basis for democracy in the primary religion of its people. Christian religious institutions such as the Vatican have developed teachings that insist on the importance of religious freedom. In contrast, the Quran provides specific guidance on relevance of Islam to all areas of life, including pol­itics. A democracy like ours having Judea-Christian roots will struggle to take root in the Middle Eastern sands. The very idea of democracy must radi­cally adapt itself to flourish. 
America's religious roots must be acknowledged in working with Iraq. Faith-based teachings have had a posi­tive contribution to America. However, there are clearly areas when church and state must be completely disassociated from each other lest faith wrongly justi­fies political action. 
Osama bin Laden presents a clear case of the misuse of faith in politics by mis­construing religion to justify an attack on a state. In his fatwah urging war against Americans, he claims to communicate "God's order to kill the Americans." In response, the American government must take the very opposite approach of bin Laden and have the state respond without citing.religious motives. 
Consequently, it is imperative to have a clear separation between church and state in relations with the Middle East. If the line is blurred, political conflict may be misconstrued and exacerbated as a religious conflict. 
This is a fine line that President Bush treads. He has often described counter­terrorist efforts as a war against evil. But much to his credit, he has also made exceedingly clear that the enemy is not the religion of Islam in noting that ter­rorists "who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah." Within days of the Sept. 11 attacks, he made speeches to tell America, "Islam is peace." This has tempered the risk of Arabs seeing American troops in the Middle East as part of a Christian effort. 
One official who grossly blurred the line between politics and faith was Army lieutenant General William Boykin. General Boykin is the deputy undersec­retary of defense for intelligence. He's responsible for overseeing the search for Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar. He has recently come under fire for equating the war on terror to a religious battle against Satan. When speaking to a fundamentalist Christian church in uniform, Boykin said that Islamic extremists hate the United States "because we're a Christian nation, because our foundation and our roots are Judea-Christian." This is a wrong and lethal message that has been com­municated throughout the Arab region. 
Such ignorance can lead to a deadly backlash for our American troops. It is of key importance to note that the primary motive for terrorism is not hatred of Christianity but frustration resulting from social injustices. 
The primary demographic promulgat­ing terrorism is the poor, rural Arab who desires a system of revolution. Groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood blame the Western influence in their govern­ment and propose a return to Islam. To the oppressed farmer, this call sounds logical and enticing. Bin Laden cites injustices as the motivation for his attacks. The Wall Street Journal quotes him on Oct. 7, 2001 as saying that in his nation "sons are killed, its blood is shed, its sanctuaries are attacked and no one hears and no one heeds." 
His complaint may be justified, but he then wrongly hijacks the Islamic faith to justify an attack. American leaders must not fall into his trap and polarize America's effort in religious terms. 
If America is to succeed in the Middle East, it must demonstrate a high regard for the Arab culture. While our state leaders should not act in the name of religion, we can act on values of compas­sion shared by Americans and Arabs alike to follow Bush's State of the Union commitment to "encourage development and education and opportunity in the Islamic world."

Real American heroes 
At approximately 11:30 a.m. on Saturday, Nov. 8, groups of Notre Dame fans of all ages huddled about their parked vehi­cles, enjoying good company, good food and maybe a drink or two before cheering on the Irish. Unbeknownst to them, nearby there was a young woman, just 20 years of age, crouched next to a grill, flipping hamburgers with one hand and holding a Bud Ught in the other. This perilous situation continued for a time as countless families and students, .blissfully ignorant, contin­ued to enjoy the cool fall morning. 
At exactly 11:36 a.m. a NDSP officer spotted this reprobate · holding her beer and suspected immediately that she may have been a minor in possession. Moving swiftly, the efficient team surrounded the criminal, seizing her identification and verifying that she was, indeed, just twenty years old. As the innocent bystanders who witnessed this remained frozen in awe, these true heroes were amazingly able to write the criminal a citation without causing any injury to the many surrounding innocents. 
Mter the chaos of this arrest abated, the parents of this deviant looked on in horror as they realized their daughter's terrible crime. The relived crowd erupted in cheers as the heroes proceeded onward, continuing to defend the parking lots from the persistent threat posed by minors in possession, intoxicated adults, and, worst of all, adults serving to minors. 
Do you find this anecdote particularly improbable and amaz­ing? This is but one example of how these real American heroes risk life and limb each Notre Dame home football Saturday to ensure that peace and justice prevails throughout. Speak to anyone who traverses the tailgating battlefields each Saturday and you will hear accounts even more inspiring than my own: tales of officers able to restrain and cite an entire cir­cle of students shotgunning beers; courageous officers tackling minors who had just cracked open their first beers; selfless heroes who would literally throw themselves in front of can of beer to keep its contents from touching the lips of an underage student. 
In these chaotic times, we can rest easy knowing that, regard­less of what transpires in this violent world, we will always be protected by those heroes whose patrol and protection of the tailgating lots never really ends.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Any major can be successful 
If David Barrett is a philosophy major, then he has not been paying attention in class. His failure to present sound reasons for the surplus of business major greatly discredits his entire argument in his Nov. 11 column. Although he is an economics major and has covered his "business bases," he seems to know very little about being a business major. He implies that studying business maintains one's "intellectual integrity" more poorly than reading an 800-page book. One of these two authors has read The Brothers Karamazov for class and one for pleasure; we'll let the readers figure out who is who. 
Barrett says that "college is a time for essays rather than scantrons. It should teach us to think critically and write flu­idly." He assumes much regarding the business education. Harcly does a scantron test pass through the College of Business, and if he thinks that analyzing, designing and implementing an entire computer system does not require critical thinking, he is grossly mistaken. Barrett can judge for himself the fluidity of this essay, co-authored by a busi­ness major. A wise philosopher told us once that the only thing we can truly know is that we know nothing, and Barrett has disregarded this in passing judgment on busi­ness majors. 
Barrett fails to take into account that the one-third of Notre Dame students enrolled in the business school may be studying business because they actually enjoy studying it. College is a time for young men and women to find out who they really are and find out what challenges them to become better versions of themselves. Some students like to read The Hepublic, others want to build them. Business majors arc not any more or less complete because they know the intricacies of finance and may not have read Moby-Dick. 
We would like to ask Barrett how his father accrued his philanthropic capital. Was he sitting on the banks of Walden painting landscapes? We would bet that the Harvard law hopeful mentioned by Barrett's father is grateful that his benefactors were doing something more practical with their time than spending it with Plato in his cave. 
There are students under-whelmed and unchallenged in every college at this University. There are students who do not try and get by on barely passing grades, and there are students who wake up every morning excited about the chal­lenges they will face in "Political Liberalism" or "Systems Analysis Design." Students in all majors can go out and achieve, no matter what they studied as an undergraduate. Plenty of business majors go on to top law schools while Arts and Letters students are preparing to get their MBAs. 
John Stuart Mill defined "liberalism" as being tolerant of the ideas and tehaviors of others. For Barrett to say that there are too many business majors at Notre Dame is evi­dence that he has not benefited from his liberal education.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Make us laugh 
Like approximately 80 percent of Viewpoint letters, this one discusses diversity. However, the issue of diversity we discuss is one of far greater importance than those of culture and race. That's right, we are talking about diversi­ty in Viewpoint topics. We represent the vast majority of Viewpoint readers who are too lazy to actually write a letter. However, we have been so moved by the appalling lack of variety that we have decided to sit down, in Australia, on a beautiful sunny day in order to bring to light an important issue we feel is vastly undervalued. 
Through extensive statistical research, we have found that over 76.323 percent of Viewpoint pages contain at least one letter on one of the following topics: diversity, Catholicism (including, but not limited to abor­tion, pre-marital sex, homosexuality and pari­etals). the war in Iraq and human rights. Now, we have attended Notre Dame for two and a half years, which is about 400 school days, and with three to four letters published in the Viewpoint daily, that's around 300 letters on one of these topics.. 
Therefore, there is no possible way that any­one can contribute anything new to the discus­sion of any of the aforementioned issues. Please stop trying. The next time you sit down to write an article on any of these topics, think about the poor students who have to sit through another rambling discussion on the lack of diversity on Notre Dame's campus or how unfair parietals and the war in Iraq are. Honestly, no one cares. 

Don't criticize Revue 

Upon reading the article concerning the reactions of Saint Mary's students to the Keenan Revue, I couldn't help but think of the following quote from Jonathan Swift: "Satire is a sort of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but their own." 
In addition to not seeing any part of them­selves reflected in this satirical show, those Saint Mary's students protesting the Revue apparently have missed the fact that it is satire in the first place. 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 
Now we know some of you out there arc thinking, who are these idiots and why do they continue to read Viewpoint articles if they're so disgusted with their content? We are the stu­dents at Notre Dame who frequently skip class­es regardless of what time they start. We arc the students who go out in spite of homework assignments and use study days for strictly recreational activities. 
We are the students who give Notre Dame life outside the classroom. We are also the stu­dents who have hope that Viewpoint can be a vehicle for the discussion of new and interest­ing topics. Let us be clear, however, that we do not read Viewpoint to expand our cultural and spiritual horizons; we read Viewpoint to laugh. As such, we have a few topic suggestions we feel would be worthwhile: yogurt machine reg­ulation, why Zahm sucks, cab drivers that rock, the most effective techniques to steal food from Grab 'N Go, why the sprinkling sys­tem waters the sidewalk more than the grass, the banning of sweat pants on campus, etc. 
In closing, we can be nothing but optimistic that more authors like Joe Muto and Tom Haaf will step forward and lift us out of the stagna­tion that has become Viewpoint with articles that not only address relevant issues, but more importantly, make us laugh. 
Bill Benear Greg Kuhl JUniors Fremande, Australia Nov. II 
The Revue presents its topic in outrageous, farcical and ironic ways, and its skits are therefore to be taken in jest. These Saint Mary's students would cease to be offended if they took a step back and observed the satirical nature of the Revue. Then again, good satire is always misinterpreted by some.

Legends says ~hello' to hot new band this weekend 
Hello Dave shows off its musical style of classic rock and pop, mixed with a bit of country this Friday night at Legends 
By SARAH VABULAS 
Scene Editor 
On Friday night, students can say hello to Hello Dave when they play at Legends of Notre Dame. Described as "The Eagles of the new millennium" and one of Chicago's best-kept secrets, Hello Dave has been rockin' audiences for over a decade and is showing no signs of mercy with their newest studio album. 
"Perfect Day" is set for release in January by Mountain Records. Recorded at Vortex Studio in Burbank, Calif., "Perfect Day" is the band's most accom­plished album to date and explodes with 11 tracks of big radio rock & roll. Sure to land a permanent place in the CD changer, fans will love sprightly new tunes "Broken" and "Come Right Away," and the rich harmonious texture of "Medicine Boy." New remixes of grand hits "Golden" and "Sweetness" have never sounded better at the hands of legendary producer, Don Gehman. The album has already generated radio air­play and the band's fiercely loyal fan base further guarantees the album's success. 
The band's unique mix of classic rock and bold pop served up with a side of country is enough to satisfy even the toughest critic. Known for their uproari­ous live shows, Hello Dave gives music fans exactly what they deserve: com­manding rock & roll with merciless energy and staggering talent. Hello Dave is a guaranteed party in every perform­ance. 
After the success of their live album Wicked Revelry, the band was excited to get back in the studio, this time with producer Don Gehman. With a reputa­tion for only working with bands whose music he likes, Gehman is one of the most respected producers in the indus­try. His rich heartland sound is most familiar to audiences through his collab­orations with John Cougar Mellencamp and Hootie & the Blowfish, and was a perfect match for the melodic sounds of Hello Dave. This three-time Grammy nominated producer has also worked with the likes of Blues Traveler, Stephen Stills, REM, Tracy Chapman, Barbara Streisand and many more. 
Completing the artistic trinity of Perfect Day is art director Gary Burden. Known for creating many famous album covers for legendary classic rock & roll bands of the 1960s and '70s, including The Eagles' Desperados, The Doors' Morrison Hotel and Joni Mitchell's Blue, he happily designed the album cover for Perfect Day. Also a three-time Grammy nominee, Burden hit the top after hook­ing up with photographer Henry Diltz, who documented many of the scenarios dreamed up by Burden. 
The driving force behind Hello Dave has always been lead vocalist, song­writer and rhythm-guitarist Mike Himebaugh. While growing up in Michigan. Himebaugh traveled with his mother and stepfather who were heavily involved in Barber shopping, or singing in four-part harmony. This laid the seed for Himebaugh's love of music. He remembers spending many hours behind his closed bedroom door singing along to his tape recorder. This continued until college, where he began to write his own songs and take up music seriously. Since then he hasn't looked back. Now he says he is lucky enough to travel around most of the country and half the world singing his songs. 
Also growing up in a musical family, bassist Allen Wetzel learned to play gui­tar at an early age. Music became such a large part of his life that after majoring in music in college he moved to Hollywood to pursue his dream. After a couple years of partying and starvation, Wetzel became disenchanted with the industry and moved back to Chicago. Since joining Hello Dave, Wetzel says he has had some of the best years of his life. 
Lead guitarist Mike "Magoo" McGahan joined Hello Dave after playing an acoustic set with Wetzel at an all night party. He was later asked to join Hello Dave and has been with the band for five years. McGahan had been playing guitar since college and was no stranger to music as he had been in several bands, worked making amplifiers and as a DJ all before joining the ranks of Hello Dave. McGahan brings an infections energy to the band and his blues-influ­enced style is something that the audi­ence can really get behind. 

When percus­sionist Bryan Resendiz joined Hello Dave just after returning from Drummers Collective in Manhattan in 1995, his solid yet versatile drum­ming style and dedication added a talent that helped to elevate the band's playing quality to the next level. Answering an ad Hello Dave had placed for a new drummer, Resendiz was quickly added as a member to the band. With his personal musical influences being wide-ranging he introduced several new and different elements to Hello Dave's own unique rock & roll sound while confidently moving the band forward. 
The fifth mem­Courtesy of www.hellodave.com ber of Hello Dave, Michael "Magoo" McGohan, the lead guitarist of Hello keyboardist Tony Dave, sings backup and plays the harmonica. 
Orant has brought a finishing touch to the already rich blend of sounds. Orant was addicted to music early and prides himself on probably being the only kid in America that actually asked for piano lessons. Throughout high school and college he developed his tal­ent and his ability to play in many differ­ent genres. While playing in a band called Gertrude that opened for Hello Dave, Orant began sitting in with them as a guest and has just never left. Now as a full member of the band, Orant helps to pull it all together into the fun and original sound that Hello Dave has become known for. 
Hello Dave played at Heartland a few years ago, attracting a large crowd, who seemed to enjoy the band's music. 
"We haven't played for a couple weeks, since we took some time off after recording the new album, so we are excited to play again," said Himebaugh. 
Hello Dave will play their show begin­ning at 9 p.m. Friday night at Legends. Admission is free and requires a Notre Dame, Saint Mary's or Holy Cross ID.

NBA 

Spurs dominate over Nets in Finals rematch 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. ­Much like the NBA Finals, the New Jersey Nets had no answer for Tim Duncan -even with Jason Kidd producing a triple­double. 
Duncan had a season-high 31 points and 12 rebounds and the defending champion San Antonio Spurs defeated the Nets 85-71 Wednesday night in the first meeting between the teams since the championship round. 
Tony Parker added 17 points in just his second game of the season and Manu Ginobili had 12 points and eight rebounds as the Spurs won their second straight game since Duncan and Parker returned to the lineup. 
Kidd, who spurned a free agent offer from the Spurs in the offseason, had 14 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds for his second triple-double of the sea­son and the 52nd of his career. 
Kenyon Martin added 14 points and 10 rebounds in his first game since spraining his left ankle Oct. 31. 
The Nets also couldn't over­come long stretches of cold shooting -another reminder of what happened in the finals when New Jersey allowed San Antonio to go on a series-decid­ing 19-0 run in Game 6. 
A 3-for-14 slump at the end of the second quarter came during a 21-5 spurt that gave the Spurs a 49-33 halftime lead. 
Parker started the run with four straight points, Duncan added six and Malik Rose had five, including a tip just before the halftime buzzer. 
The disappointingly small crowd of 13,286 was starting to grumble when the game turned on a spectacular block by Martin early in the third quarter. 
Duncan got the rebound in the lane and went up for a jump hook with his arm fully extend­ed. Martin came from the base­line and blocked the shot well above the rim, swatting the ball into the stands. 
The block got the Nets and the fans back in the game. New Jersey closed the quarter with a 17-4 run to pull to 63-56. The deficit was reduced to three points in the fourth quarter, the last time at 67-64 on a jumper by Martin in the lane. 

Miami 88, Cleveland 83 
Eddie Jones scored 25 points and Lamar Odom added 14 points and 10 assists, helping Miami become the final NBA team to break into the victory column with an 88-83 win over Cleveland on Wednesday night. 
LeBron James had 18 points on 6-of-15 shooting for Cleveland, which lost its 26th straight road game since February ami failed in its bid for the franchise's first three-game winning streak since April 2002. 
Zydrunas Ilgauskas added 20 points for the Cavaliers and Carlos Boozer had a game-high 16 rebounds. 
The Heat lost their first seven games, the franchise's worst start since going 0-17 to open its inaugural season, 1988-89. They missed their last five field goal attempts against Cleveland, giving the Cavaliers plenty of chances to pull off a late rally. 
But James was stifled on three key possessions, first committing an offensive foul while driving with 2:08 left, then getting a shot blocked by Udonis Haslem with 1:30 remaining. 
James also failed to handle a quick pass from Ilgauskas with 
18.5 seconds left, committing Cleveland's eighth turnover of the final quarter. 
Cleveland further hurt itself by making only 17 of 30 free throws. 
Miami held Cleveland to one field goal in the fmal 6:52 of the third quarter, turning a 61-60 deficit into a 72-65 lead entering the final period. 
DwyaneWade made two big plays to fuel the quarter-ending burst. He rose well above the rim to block James' layup attempt with 5:15 left in the third, sparking a fast-break bas­ket by Haslem for a 66-61 edge. 
With 1:09 left in the quarter, Wade rebounded his own missed baseline jumper and put down a two-handed dunk to give Miami a 72-64lead-its biggest

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Jack McKeon calls himself an "old goat." He can add "wise." 
The 72-year-old manager of the Florida Marlins was voted NL Manager of the Year for the second time after transforming a last-place team into a World Series champion. 
"This is something that topped off all the good things that happened to us this year," he said Wednesday after the voting was announced. 
Kansas City's Tony Pena won the AL honor after the Royals rebounded from their first 100­loss season to stay in contention until the final week. 
McKeon received 19 of 32 first-place votes and 116 points in balloting by the Baseball Writers'' Association of America, becoming the first manager to win the award after taking over a team during the season. 
He is the third-oldest in major· league history, trailing Hall of Famers Connie Mack (88) and Casey Stengel (75). He thanked the Marlins for hiring him. 
"They had the courage to go out and hire an old goat like me," he said in Miami. "I want­ed one more crack." 
Florida was 16-22 when McKeon replaced Jeff Torborg on May 11. The Marlins dropped to 10 games under .500 on May 22, falling into the NL East cellar, then rebounded to finish 91-71 and win the NL wild card. 
"When I came in here, I didn't think they were having any fun," McKeon said. His solution was to tell his team to "play it like a kids' game." 
Voting took place before the postseason, when Florida upset San Francisco in the first round, overcame a 3-1 deficit to beat the Cubs in the NL champi­onship series, then rebounded from a 2-1 deficit to beat the

New York Yankees in the World Series. It was McKeon's fii'st time in the postseason. 
He started in professional baseball as a player in 1949 and became a manager six years later. His major league managing career began in 1973 with Kansas City, and he went on to manage Oakland. San Diego and Cincinnati. 
"The biggest thing I think I've learned is patience and under­standing today's young players and realizing these guys are looking for someone to guide them," McKeon said. "They're looking for instruction and they're looking for motivation." 
Dusty Baker, a three-time winner of the award, finished second with 62 points after leading the Cubs to the NL Central title in his first season as Chicago's manager. 
"I like Jack. He earned it," Baker said, saying Syracuse basketball coach Jim Boeheim put things in perspective during an interview a few days ago. 
"He was saying it took him 27 years to win a championship. I'm on No. 12 now. Jack is on what? Fifty-something?" Baker said. "Whoo! Lord have mercy. I don't have nothing to be sad about. Nothing." 
McKeon is not thinking about retirement any time soon. 
''I'm not going to go home and sit in the rocking chair and drive that tractor," he said. "I hope to do it as long as I'm healthy enough and feel it's still enjoyable." 
Pena was an overwhelming choice for the AL award, getting 24 first-place votes and 130 points. Minnesota's Ron Gardenhire was second with four firsts and 44 points. 
"When they told me, I got on my knees to thank God. Then I cried with my family," Pena said in a telephone interview from his home in Santiago, Dominican Republic. "There are no words to describe what I feel." 
After the unexpected success this season, Pena thinks more will be expected· from Kansas City next year. 
"Everybody believes we have a good chance to win." he said. 
Pena, 46, took over the Royals in May 2002 and Kansas City finished 62-100. The Royals won their·first nine games this year, got off to a 16-3 start and were 51-41 at the All-Star break, leading the AL Central by seven games. 
But they slumped in the sec­
ond half and wound up 83-79, 
their first winning season since 
1994. Kansas City used 29 
pitchers, including an AL-high 
15 starters. and set a team 
record by using 53 players. 
"We did not run out of bullets. 
we just ran out of time," Pena 
said. 
He is only the second 
Dominican to win manager of 
the year. Felipe Alou, who 
replaced Baker in San 
Francisco after the 2002 sea­
son, was NL Manager of the 
Year in 1994, when he was with 
Montreal. 
"Felipe was the one that 
opened the gate for us," he 
said. "Dominicans. and all 
Latinos, are showing that we 
can take on large responsibili­
ties in baseball. We know how 
to do more than throw hard or 
hit well."

Unlimited Minutes 
Can You Hear Me Now? 
by Chandra johnson Assistant Director, Cross Cultural Ministry 
Just about everyone these days has a cell phone clipped to their waist or nestled in their backpack. Even I have one. Although I must admit I'm still a novice user. It took me three months to figure out that by pressing the little button on the side of the phone, I could hear better. I wasn't losing my hearing after all! And I continue to be amazed when each time I flip up the pad protector; a voice always asks, "Who would you like to call?" Compact, practical, and indispensable, the cell phone keeps our family, friends and the entire world at our finger­tips twenty-four hours a day. What a blessing. Or is it? 
When I drive around campus, I can't help but notice students walking with one hand over their ear and head pointed toward the ground. You're in deep conversation with someone who, at that moment, has your undivided attention. Instant access is a modern marvel indeed, however, I often wonder if its utilization has ushered out the age ofcontemplation and ushered in an age of modern self-segregation? 
I raised the cell phone craze with a group ofstudents last week and somehow we got on.the subject of intuition and wisdom, and how you get it. We began to evaluate the many layers of our lives and how it is becoming harder and harder to settle down to pray. How does one shut out the BlackBerry world to hear the voice of reason when making decisions? How do we know when the edge is closer than we think? How do we feel God and not the pressured anxiety of the next meeting or class? 
I reminded them that the word "cell" did not always mean "cellular telephone". Once upon a time it referred to a cave, a prayer space where one could be still to hear the voice and subtle wisdom of God. In fact, monasticism, as we know it today, began almost two thousand years ago in the cave cells of Egypt. First-century Christian men and women left the cities to contemplate what it meant to be a follower ofJesus Christ, and much of what they gleaned from the solitude provided the rubric for later ascetic and mystical writings. Their cave experience was the place where wisdom spoke. 
The first reading for today's Mass is taken from the Book ofWisdom: "In wisdom is a spirit intelligent, holy, unique, clear, unhampered, beneficent, kindly, firm, secure, tranquil, all powerful, all-seeing ... [nor [w]isdom is mobile beyond all motion, and she penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity. (7:22b-8:1) Wisdom's fluidity points to the ques­tion in today's gospel where Jesus is asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God will come. Jesus answers, "The coming of the Kingdom ofGod cannot be observed, and no one will announce [it]. For behold, the Kingdom ofGod is among you." (Luke 17:20-25) Among whom? Where? How will we know it and what does it look like? In today's Mass, we are comforted in knowing that wisdom is everywhere, we just haye to stop long enough to listen for and recognize her counsel. The Kingdom of which Jesus speaks is right before our eyes. It is among us. It is in us. It is mobile, flawless and travels with us everywhere. It is all we know God to be. It is the peace ofJesus Christ. It is the power of the Spirit . 
As we prepare for the Advent Season, let us engage in a renewed rite ofcommunica­tion. Let us use our unlimited minutes to call up God, contemplate Christ, and embrace the Spirit within. There is an entire library ofwisdom inside ofyou just waiting to reveal itself as your life in motion. Go to it and trust that all you desire to be is within reach. The measure of your hard work will be revealed when you least expect. 
So now ... who would you like to call? Take a moment to have a conversation with God. Go to the Grotto, your dorm chapel, the Basilica, the silence of your room-anywhere you can find peace and quiet. And sit. Be silent. Be still. Go within and listen quietly. "Can you hear me now? Good."

FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. ­He worked with the scout team. He kept his running in low gear. There were no dazzling moves, no 70-yard passes. 
Still, this was a significant breakthrough. 
Michael Vick was back. 
The Atlanta Falcons quarter­back practiced Wednesday for the first time since breaking his right leg in a preseason game, raising hopes that he'll soon be ready to play. He has set Nov. 30 in Houston as his target. 
"I think I handled it pretty well," Vick said after the two­hour practice. "Toward the end, it got kind of sore on me. But that's what I expected. That's a good thing." 
The rest of the team was already on the field when Vick trotted out from the locker room, wearing his No. 7 jersey and carrying his shoulder pads. At least a dozen cameramen and photographers documented every step. 
Practice was uneventful. Vick served as the third-team quar­terback behind Kurt Kittner and Doug Johnson, which meant working with the scout team and backups. 
At times, Vick appeared to be favoring his leg, and he didn't show off any of his celebrated running skills. Still, the Falcons were glad to have him back in uniform. 
"I didn't have any expecta­tions because I really didn't know how much he could do," coach Dan Reeves said. "I was definitely pleased that he did as much as he did." 
No one was more pumped up than Vick. 
"I asked him how he felt," Reeves said. "He said, 'Coach, I couldn't sleep last night. I was so excited to come out and start practicing.' That's what showed up -the excitement he had all day long." 
Wright to start Sunday for Ravens

injured Kyle Boller. 
Wright's start against the Miami Dolphins will be his first since October 2001, when he played in four games with the Dallas Cowboys before a knee injury landed him on injured reserve. 
Ravens coach Brian Billick said Wednesday that Wright's mobility in the pocket earned him the job over Chris Hedman, who was sacked five times and fumbled twice in relief of Boller in a 33-22 loss to St. Louis on Sunday night. 
"That's a tough situation for Chris, but the reason we're going with Anthony Wright is that right now Anthony's physi­cal attributes fit better with what we're doing," Billick said. "That's not Chris' fault; it's just a matter of Anthony's athleti­cism. That's the primary thing. He fits more with what we do in both our running and passing game." 
Wright or Redman, it makes no difference to the Dolphins, who are preparing for a clash with the NFL's leading rusher, Jamal Lewis, and the league's top-ranked running game. 
"It's not going to change our preparation a bit," Miami line­backer Junior Seau said. 'They have a great running back in Jamal, and he's going to be our focal point." 
Jacksonville picks up Johnson off waivers 
When top-line receiver Kevin Johnson became available Wednesday, the Jacksonville Jaguars had a few questions. 
First among them: How soon could Johnson get to town? 
Continuing their nonstop search for receiving help, the Jaguars signed Johnson, the fifth-year veteran who led Cleveland in receptions this sea­son, but was surprisingly released by the Browns on Tuesday. 
To make room, Jacksonville released J .J. Stokes, once viewed as a possible answer to their problems. but who had only 13 catches this year and spent a good portion of the sea­son on the inactive list. 
Browns coach Butch Davis wasn't happy with Johnson's performance of late, but the Jaguars weren't too concerned. 
"Like we do with all players, we researched it, and we feel pretty satisfied with the player changing scenery," player per­sonnel director James llarris said. "He's getting an opportu­nity to get a fresh start." 
Johnson arrives Thursday, and soon after, coach Jack Del Rio will decide whether to acti­vate him for Sunday's game against Tennessee.

ALAMEDA, Calif. -Rich Gannon, last yf,ar's NFL MVP, will miss the re:;;t of the season and have surgery on his throw­ing shoulder. 
The Oakland Raiders placed the quarterback on injured reserve Wednesday. 
The 37-year-old Gannon attempted to throw with his right shoulder Tuesday for the first time since getting knocked out of Oakland's 17-10 loss to Kansas City on Oct. 20. He was able to raise his arm to throw, but couldn't release the ball, coach Bill Callahan said. 
Gannon, a 16-year veteran, flew home to Minnesota ou 
interceptions and was sacked 17 times for a subpar 73.5 quarter­back rating. 
He struggled this season com­ing off his MVP year in 2002, when he led the league's top offense as the Raiders won their third straight AFC West title and reached the Super Bowl for the first time in 20 years. 
Last season, Gannon broke the NFL completions record with 
418. He led the league with 4,689 yards passing, nearly becoming just the second quar­terback to go over 5,000 in a season. Dan Marino threw for 5,084 yards in 1984. 
Gannon completed 67.6 per­cent of his attempts, had 26 touchdowns passes and only 10 
intercep­tions. His

w i t h Washington. He missed all of the · 1994 season and then was released by the Redskins. 
Callahan wouldn't go as far as saying the torn labrum is a career-ending injury and expects Gannon to play in 2004 for the Raiders, who are 2-7 and off to their worst start since 1964. 
"It's extremely tough to lose a player of this caliber," Callahan said. "What he provides this team not only with his play, but his leadership and preparation, to have the MVP of the league miss almost half the season is disappointing. He feels bad. If there's anybody who wants to get back on the field, it's Rich Gannon." 
Gannon was hurt in the first half against the Chiefs following two sacks by linebacker Shawn Barber and several other hard hits. 
With backup Marques Tuiasosopo also out for the year with a knee injury, Rick Mirer will be the starter for the last seven games. 
"It's kind of the tale of our s'eason," said Pro Bowl right tackle Lincoln Kennedy, one of the Raiders' team leaders. "It's just the way things have gone. A lot of people we kind of counted on and had high expectations for the season are no longer with us.... Right now, the team is fighting for survival." 
Gannon was 125-of-225 for 1,274 yards, six touchdowns and a completion percentage of 
55.6 this season. He threw four

threw for 
more than 
300 yards in 
10 games, another record. 
"To lose a leader like that is really hard," Kennedy said. "I know it's harder on him. I've seen him the last couple days and it was hard for him to come to this decision." 
''I'm not surprised. I kind of expected it -not only when it happened, but the fact he was unable to come back the last couple weeks." 
Callahan is holding out hope that Gannon would be ready by spring minicamps. If not, his future with this franchise could be uncertain, because he's scheduled to make $7 million next season. 
"I feel terrible for him," Callahan said. "If there's any­body capable of coming back from injury and fighting through it and getting back on the field,

Cletnens retiretnent to go forward 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK With thoughts of an Olympic medal now gone, Roger Clemens insisted his retirement will go forward as planned. 
"No scenario," Clemens said Wednesday when asked what might entice him to pitch next season. ''I'm retired." 
''I'll come back and be a really expensive batting prac­tice pitcher and then, if somebody goes down, then they can work on me." 
The future Hall of Farner acknowledged that he had thoughts of pitching for the 
U.S. Olympic baseball team before the defending gold­medal champions were elimi­nated from a qualifying tour­nament in Panama last week. 
"''m shaking my head just like everyone else that they're going to have an Olympics and we, the United States, is not going to be rep­resented there," Clemens said. "That's kind of a shame." 
An Olympic medal is about the only thing missing from Clemens' resume. He is base­ball's only six-time Cy Young Award winner, 17th on the all-time list with 310 victories and third with 4,099 strike­outs. He also has two World Series rings. 
Clemens said that his agents wanted to make him available as a free agent ­his name was officially filed last week -but the plan didn't get far. 
"I heard that and immedi­ately my four boys picked up my option and said 'You're staying here,"' Clemens said. 
Another person expecting 
to be home when next season rolls around is Don Zimmer, the fiery former bench coach who famously rushed Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez on the field, and left the Yankees after saying he felt unappre­ciated by owner George Steinbrenner. 
Calling speculation that he may end up with Tampa Bay "propaganda," Zimmer said, ''I'll probably be at home sit­ting on the boat dock" next year. 
Still uncertain is the future of pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre. Yankees manag­er Joe Torre said he expects to hear by the end of this week if Stottlemyre plans to be back for next season or not. 
"I don't have a gut feeling," Torre said about what he believes Stottlemyre's deci­sion will be.

OXFORD, Ohio -Ben Roethlisberger passed for 282 yards and two touch­downs through a howling wind Wednesday night, leading No. 23 Miami of Ohio to a 45-6 victory that ended Marshall's domi­nance of the Mid-American Conference. 
Playing with their first national ranking since 1976, the RedHawks (9-1, 6-0) got their ninth straight victory and their most meaningful one yet. 
Marshall (6-4, 4-2) had won all six MAC East titles since the league split into two divisions in 1997. 
Miami's win clinched the title and a berth in the con­ference's championship game. 
There were no clashes during a wind-blown game that had bitter undertones from last year, when quar­terback Stan Hill's 1-yard run with 5 seconds left gave the Thundering Herd a 36-34 victory in Huntington, West Virginia. 
Fans stormed the field and Miami defensive coor­dinator Jon Wauford was Jed away in handcuffs, accused of knocking down a fan. Wauford resigned after the season, and a charge of misdemeanor battery later was dropped. 
Linebackers coach Taver Johnson also was disci­plined for damaging the visiting coaches' box at the end of the game. 
Three sacurity officers stood watch over Marshall coach Bob Pruett on the field Wednesday. Most of the crowd of 26,286 had left by game's end. 
Roethlisberger had no problems throwing in a gusting wind that whistled through the end zone bleachers, making the goalpost uprights sway by more than a foot. 
He put Miami ahead to stay with a 14-yard touch­down pass to Matt Brandt on a game-opening drive into the wind and finished it off with a 10-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter. 
The junior quarterback joined Marshall's Chad Pennington and Byron Leftwich as the only MAC players to throw for 3,000 yards in three seasons. 
Hoethlisberger, who com­pleted 18 of 29 passes, also made the game's signature play, putting his head down and running over line­backer Gladstone Coke for a 14-yard gain that kept the opening drive going. 
By contrast, Marshall's Graham Gochneaur had problems with the wind and the defensive pres­sure. 
IN BRIEF 

Agassi wins over Ferrero 
for chance at semifinals 
Andre Agassi righted himself quickly enough to beat Juan Carlos Ferrero and give Andy Roddick the year-end No. 1 ranking. 
After a miserable 1 1/2 sets, Agassi suddenly began finding his strokes and came back to stun Ferrero 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 Wednesday night at the Tennis Masters Cup. 
Ferrero fell to 0-2 in the round­robin portion of the $3.65 million tournament and can't possibly quali­fy for the semifinals, which means he won't accumulate enough points in the last event of 2003 to pass Roddick. 
Agassi (1-1) can reach the semifi­nals by beating No. 8 David Nalbandian next. 
Hoddick, meanwhile, didn't have to set foot on court Wednesday. IIe replaced Ferrero -the man he beat in the U.S. Open final-at No. 1 in the ATP Tour computer rankings last week and, at 21, will be the 
third-youngest player to close a sea­son there. Roddick (1-0) faces No. 6 Rainer Schuettler on Thursday. 
In Wednesday's other match, Wimbledon champion Roger Federer defeated Nalbandian for the first time in six pro meetings, 6-3, 6-0. Agassi's win over Ferrero allowed Federer (2-0) to claim a semifinal berth. 
Through the first 15 games, Agassi had 24 unforced errors to Ferrero's nine. Agassi was slow afoot and just kept missing shots he usually at least keeps in play. 
Yankees to keeP. Rodris;!uez, 
won't yet consiiler Schilling 
PHOENIX -Alex Rodriguez is not on the trading block. And any deal to send Curt Schilling to New York probably won't happen this week­even after the Arizona ace agreed to speak directly to the Yankees. 
But the Milwaukee Brewers could be close to trading star first base­man Richie Sexson, with the Arizona Diamondbacks the likely destination. 
Those were the developments of Day 3 of baseball's general man­agers' meeting on Wednesday. 
Discussions did not involve Rodriguez, said Texas Hangers gen­eral manager John Hart, who did his best to shoot down trade rumors involving his superstar shortstop. 
"I think we've got the best player in the game. We love him. We have no interest in dealing Alex Rodriguez," Hart said. "We're not having any conversations with any team about Alex Hodriguez. If any­body were to call, of course we'd lis­ten, but we're not interested in any way, shape or form in trading Alex Rodriguez." 
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said he did not expect his team to make any deals this week ­for Schilling or anyone else. 
Next month's meetings in New Orleans would be "more realistic time" for any trade, Cashman said.

"So it's little things of that nature that as they become more expe­rienced, they get better and bet­ter at performing run blocking and also pass protection." 
Along the way, they have also ed to' pile up. 

On the defensive side of the ball, two senior starters -safe­ty Glenn Earl and defensive end Kyle Budinscak -will be out for the season, according to Noti"e Dame coach Tyrone Willingham. 
Earl inured his knee in the Southern Cal game and had sur­gery last week to repair the injury, leaving him sidelined for the season. Budinscak, who has another year of eligibility remaining with Notre Dame, was injured in the Florida State game. 
On the other side of the ball, tight end Anthony Fasano and right guard Dan Stevenson were both listed as questionable for Saturday's game with BYU. Both Fasano and Stevenson were 
helped tailback Julius Jones to a couple of 200-yard performances against Pittsburgh and Navy. Against the Panthers, Jones set a Notre Dame record for rushing yards in a single game with 262. 
But the Irish face a new task this week in a Cougar defense that likes to give quarterbacks and offensive lines many differ­ent looks and brings a lot of pressure on the signal caller. It is a defense that could be similar to the one the Irish faced at Purdue -where Quinn, in his first game as a starter, was heavily pres­

injured during the Florida State game. Sophomore Jamie Ryan started at the right guard posi­tion in place of Stevenson. 
Kicker Nicholas Setta also appears to be out for the BYU game, as Willingham said he was not optimistic about the senior's return this week. Willingham did say, however, that if Setta were to return healthy, he would be the starter again at kicker and punter. Willingham still refused to com­ment on the nature of Setta's injury.

ming] team Saint Mary's has ever had," Petcoffsaid. 
The Belles have been off to a strong start as the season began during the first weekend of October at the Notre Dame Relays meet. As the dual meets began Nov. 1, Fitzpatrick was able to showcase her dominance in the 200 backstroke with a school record time of 2:18:40. Last weekend, another school record was broken by the 200 medley relay Fitzpatrick was a part ofwith a time of1:55:78. 
On a relay team dominated by seniors, it is easy to imagine the difficulties involved in transition­ing from a high school team cap-· tain to a college freshman com­peting with upperclassmen. 
But the transition has actually been anything but strenuous. "All the upperclassman tell us what Greg's [Petcoff's] expecta­
tions are and what he expects," Fitzpatrick said. "All the upper­classmen are extremely support­ive and I'm enjoying [swimming] a lot more. A big part of that is the team." 
This mindset is a significant change to the mentality Fitzpatrick suffered from earlier this year. 
"After swimming year round and competing in high school, I reached a plateau. I became unmotivated," Fitzpatrick said. 
But once reaching college, Fitzpatrick experienced a differ­ent type of training as Petcoff focused more upon the "dry" aspects of swimming, such as weightlifting. 
Despite her success, Fitzpatrick has set higher goals for the rest of the season. 
"I want to become a leader for the team in different parts of the team, not just in the pool," she said.

Montana to speak at banquet 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Writer 
Former Notre Dame quarter­back Joe Montana will speak at the 83rd annual Notre Dame Football Banquet on Dec. 12. 
Montana played an instrumen­tal role in leading the Irish to a national championship in 1977, starting the fina.l nine games of the season that year. Montana's best moment ma.y have come the following season in the Cotton Bowl. helping the Irish overcome a 34-12 deficit to top Houston 35-34 as time expired. 
"Anytime that you have a play­er of the stature of Joe Montana, it's just great to have him around," Willin~:ham said of the banquet's guest speaker. "If he were to just pass us on the street, it would be a great thing. 
But when we have an opportuni­ty to have him come speak to our banquet, and I know he will say something inspirational to our young men that will be a step­ping stone for them to improve and be better in the future ­and not just from a football standpoint, but from a life stand­point -you have to treasure it." 
Montana went on to win four Super Bowl titles with the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League. He was induct­ed into the NFL Hall of Fame in 2000. 
The Notre Dame Football Banquet serves as an opportuni­ty for the program to recognize outstanding Irish players of the year, as several awards are handed out. It also serves as a chance for Notre Dame to intro­duce high school football recruits to the program. 
BYU back to the field 
The Irish will be catching a very well rested and prepared Brigham Young squad, as the Cougars have not played a game since a 50-12 trouncing at the hands of Boise State on Oct. 30. That means the Cougars have not seen the field in a game for over two weeks. 
"It [worries me] from the stand point that there's always some­thing new that they will put into their system that we may not have seen or that might be a lit­tle different than we anticipate," Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said of his opponent's extended layoff. 
The flip side of the coin is that the Cougars may be a little rusty; having not played an actual game for 16 days by the time

Freshman starts year out strong 
By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Writer 

Caitlin Fitzpatrick is a go-get­ter. Just ask her coach, Gregg Petcoff. 
"[Fitzpatrick] is an exception­ally hard worker who under­stands the goals of the team," Saint Mary's Women's Swimming coach Petcoff said. 
Suffering from the lack of depth in the backstroke· the past couple years, Saint Mary's need­ed someone who could make a difference and that was exactly what attracted Fitzpatrick to the Belles. 
She wanted to contribute to the team individually and as a part of a relay squad, so choos­ing Saint Mary's just made sense. 
"I was aware the type of swimmers on the team and knew I could contribute with my events," Fitzpatrick said. 
Already performing strong in the flrst two dual meets of the season, Fitzpatrick has broken school records both individually and as apart of a relay. Leading a strong pack of freshman swim­mers which includes teammate Bridget Green, Petcoff is already aware of the team's talent.
