MANAGUA, Nicaragua Nicaraguans on Thursday reacted with hope tempered by memories of war to an agree­ment between the government and Contra rebels that may bring peace for the first time since 1981. 
Both sides kept their guns silent by mutual consent. A business leader said the cease­fire accord signed Wednesday night was a miracle. 
During three days of negotia­tions in a border town that resulted in an agreement Wed­nesday night, both sides had said it was the last chance for peace in Nicaragua. The for­mal cease-fire is to begin April 1. 
Washington reaction, page 7 
Virgilio Godoy, president of the opposition Independent Liberal Party, said Thursday: "I believe that the agreement is a hope. It is not a question of saying now who won and who lost in the agreement, but that Nicaragua and thousands of mothers who have sons in the war won." 
Alonso Moreno, who owns a shoe store and has three nep­hews in the army, said: "This is the most important thing that has occurred since 1979 when the Somoza dictatorship was overthrown." 
In a broadcast Thursday, the rebel Radio Liberacion said, "The (Nicaraguan) Resistance has taken an initial step to end the hostilities in Nicaragua, a very significant step." 
El Nuevo Diario, a pro­government newspaper, asked a question in its banner head­line: "Cease Fire! Peace Ex­plodes?" 
Enrique Bolanos, president of the private enterprise coun­cil and staunch government critic, called the pact "a miracle," and added: "Per­haps the Sandinista Front will finally comply with its word." 
During the negotiations at Sapoa, on the Costa Rican bor­der 90 miles south of Managua, President Daniel Ortega made a suprise visit and said it was time "to bury once and for all the military confrontation." 
Rebel leader Alfredo Cesar told journalists at the meeting: "It is not just a chance to achieve peace and harmony, but the only chance." 
Leaders of the Sandinistas and the U.S.-sponsored Contras stood side-by-side on a makes­hift dais Wednesday night in Sapoa, sang the national an­them together and signed the cease-fire. 
During the three days, both sides retreated from hard pos­itions, especially the Sandinis­tas, who stand to gain the most from an agreement that would virtually end the insurgency. 
The Contras agreed not to ac­
cept military aid and to receive 
non-lethal supplies exclusively 
from neutral organizations.

Media stresses style at expense of substance 

"Who's in first?" "That's right." "What?" "He's running second." "Who's running second?" "No, Who's in first, What's running second." 
This old Abbott and Costello comedy routine sounds like the present-day presidential cam­paign. 
Today's media has lost focus on what's im­portant on the campaign trail. All its attention now goes to the two big Ps --the polls and the personalities. 
Although personalities influence many voters' decisions, the media floods the public with personal flaws, rather than concentrating on the issues. Candidates are constantly categorized by the media with short one-liners, such as Bush the Wimp, Dole the Hatchet Man, or Robertson the TV evangelist. In the media's search for easy quips, they have distorted what the public really needs to know. 
Don't misunderstand me. Personalities do have their role in politics. It is true that Ronald Reagan's personality had a lot to do with his election, but does that make him a good pres­ident? Not in and of itself. Voters need to know how a candidate thinks and what kind of person he is. Mter all, voters wish to elect someone who has ideas and aspirations similar to their own. 
The media must take more responsibility for elections because their coverage of the cam­paign affects peoples' votes. Most people make their decision on a candidate based on what they read in the newspaper and what they see on T.V. 
The media needs to cover the whole campaign objectively; When the nightly news only shows us the one-liners from a speech or debate, rather than the overall tone and content, the public is denied one of the more important aspects of the campaign, the platforms. 
Recall the Dan RatheliGeorge Bush con­frontation. Rather attacked Bush for not dis­closing more information about the Iran-Contra affair. Bush counterattacked with, "How would you like it, Dan, if your entire career was judged by the eight minutes that you walked off the set?" It's too bad that political interviews that were meant to inform the people have to turn into vicious, personal attacks. Bush's comm­ment describes how unfair the media's coverage of the campaign can be. On the eve­ning news, we rarely hear much about a can­didate's views. Rather, we are given the quips of a debate or interview. 
Politicians are not perfect, and they some­times say things they shouldn't, like Dole's com­ment to Bush on NBC News several weeks ago: "Stop lying about my record!" 
These sharp comments do need reporting, be­cause they do say something about the can­didate's personality, but unfortunately they overshadow all the other relevent information of the campaign. 
Polls are used as the standings of a presiden­tial race. Almost every newspaper, network, and campaign staff conducts their own polls, yet many have different results. Earlier this week, I heard on the news that if Dukakis and Bush were nominated, the former would win. That's a pretty tough call to make eight months before the election, especially since the Demo­cratic race is so close. 
Polls, personalities and comic lines are great, but why doesn't the media report more of what we want to hear?' We want to know what the candidates are likely to do about Central America, the Middle East, the economy, the abortion issue and others, but they don't seem to want to tell us. 
Now that the delegates are being counted and the media can make their bar-graphed polls with caricatures of each candidate under their respective totals. But when a winner is finally crowned, and the pomp is over, the voters will be left asking "who's who?"

North, Poindexter plead innocent to charges 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Former na­tional security aides Lt. Col. Oliver North and John Poindex­ter and two businessmen pleaded innocent Thursday to charges they ran the Iran­Contra affair as a vast criminal conspiracy and defrauded the government of $17 million. 
One by one, the defendants were called before U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell at their arraignment, and asked by courtroom clerk Barbara Montgomery, "How do you wish to plead?" 
"Not guilty," replied Poin­dexter, President Reagan's former national security ad­viser, and North, a top assis­tant to Poindexter. 
"Not guilty, your honor," responded retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, who controlled the money and procured the arms for the once-secret Iran­Contra operation. 
Opposition leader returns to Panama 
Associated Press 
PANAMA CITY, Panama­
A leading opposition figure returned from exile Thursday and rejoined an increasingly desperate struggle to topple Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
"We have but one objective: to get rid of Noriega and build reconciliation and democracy in Panama!" said Ricardo Arias Calderon, the president of the Christian Democratic Party, in an address to a chant­ing, cheering crowd of about 300 people who greeted his flight from Costa Rica. 
"I am profoundly moved to be back in my own land," he said. 
The return of Arias Calderon, considered a presidential aspirant in elections scheduled for May 1989, came on the fourth day of a nationwide gen­eral strike aimed at ousting Noriega, who is the head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces and is the power behind the ci­vilian government. 
Despite almost unanimous support for the strike by busi­ness and industry, Noriega remained defiant, saying Wed­nesday night his opponents at home and in the United States don't "have the capacity" to overthrow him. 
That feeling appeared to be shared by some strike leaders, who said it might take a revolt by fellow officers to remove Noriega as head of the Defense Forces. 
"There are growing pockets within the Defense Forces that are against Noriega," said Jose Mulino, an attorney and oppo­sition leader. "What we don't know is if they will act." 
But in his speech to a group of about 500 supporters, Noriega claimed the military was maintaining "its high moral and patriotic beliefs" despite a failed barracks coup last week. 
Eleven officers were ar­
rested in that foiled plot. 
Noriega dismissed more than 
a dozen officers and shifted the 
assignments of other key per­
sonnel.

All four defendants were released on their personal recognizance and told to report weekly by telephone to a pre­trial agency. Although cri­minal defendants are often asked to surrender their pas­sports, Gesell said he would not impose that condition. 
Dressed in conservative business suits, the four men made their first appearance in court since a federal grand jury, convened by Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh 14

The indictment also said the defendants "knowingly did em­bezzle, steal and convert to their own use" part of the proceeds generated by the sale of weapons to Iran. 
Gesell set no trial date but said he would hold an early hearing to determine whether evidence gathered by Walsh is not tainted and therefore ad­missible.

Democrat Richard Gep­hardt, who has fallen on hard times since his Iowa victory 45 days ago, will quit the presiden­tial race unless he scores an upset victory in Michigan this weekend, aides said Thursday. George Bush, meanwhile, headed for Connecticut expect­ing to pad his huge lead on the GOP side. 
Gephardt said he'd made no decision to drop out, declaring, "My mother always told me to cross. one bridge at a time." But the scramble was already on to pick up supporters who

AIDS patient because there is no conclusive medical evidence on how the deadly dis­ease is spread, a judge ruled in a decision disclosed Thursday. 
Superior Court Judge Lawrence Waddington said in a 14-page decision that Jes­sica's Nail Salon could legally refuse to give Paul Jasperson a pedicure despite a West Hollywood ordinance banning AIDS discrimination. 
The ordinance "fails to respect the right not to be in­voluntarily exposed to a risk of personal harm," the judge said.

UPS delivers babies now 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind.-It was a special delivery, even for workers of United Parcel Ser­vice. 
The package was an 8-pound baby boy born to Bob Turner, an UPS delivery driver, and his wife, Deanna. 
Unfortunately, Turner didn't make the delivery. The job went to his boss, Bloomington UPS supervisor Pem Lincoln. 
Mrs. Turner called UPS about 3:30p.m. Tuesday to say she was starting labor and asked that her husband be notified. 
Lincoln called back about 15 minutes later to say Turner would be home in 45 minutes. 
"She said that was fine," said Lincoln. "But the way she said it indicated to me that there was some concern." 
Another 15 minutes went by, and Lincoln called again. This time, Mrs. Turner said she needed to go to the hospital im­mediately. 
Lincoln rushed to the Turner home. While he was dialing an ambulance, the baby arrived. 
Lincoln, 47, the father of four and a grandfather of four, worked in a pediatrics ward in the Navy 25 years ago. 
Mrs. Turner and son Daniel Lee were taken by ambulance to Bloomington Hospital.

But the White House and some in Congress also said the accord, while a strong sign of new health for the regional peace process, rests heavily on promises of future moves by both sides that could prove dif­ficult. 
President Reagan, getting into his limousine after speak­ing to high school students in suburban Vienna, Va., was asked whether he thought the 
cease-fire agreement would hold up. "I don't know. We're looking carefully at it," he replied. 
"There is a lot of room for encouragement here, yes, but there's also a lot of room for skepticism, and I'm trying to b;tlance those two off," said White House spokesman Mar­lin F'itzwater. 
"We're beginning the process. We need to watch it. We've seen processes like this start before and fail," he said. 
"This seems like a more con­crete step, and there certainly reason to be hopeful. But I do not want to play down the skep­ticism side of it either because we are skeptical."

Three suicides in two weeks stuns Evansville school 
EVANSVILLE, Ind.-Police and psychological counselors met Thursday night with par­ents at Reitz High School fol­lowing the suicides of three stu­dents in the past two weeks. 
"It's a scary situation," said Patty Kelley, a senior at the school. "Even people who didn't know them are affected by it." 
Police were there to head off rumors about the deaths, said Vanderburgh County Sheriff Clarence Shepard. 
"There are a number of rumors going around about satanism and cults and things of this sort," Shepard said. "We have found nothing in any of the three that indicates any satanism or cult." 
The three victims were boys who knew each other and were in the same year in high school, the sheriff said. Two were Reitz sophomores, and the third was a former student who trans­fered to another school. 
The latest victim, Larry "J.J." Orth, 15, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at 6:30 Wednesday mor­ning. Orth had called friends to tell them he wouldn't be back at school, and the friends went to his home and found the vic­tim in his living room, along with a note indicating he was having family problems. 
Eric Sanders, 16 and also a Reitz student, died March 10; and Steven Schaefer, 15, who left last year, died March 13. 
"The last two appear to be copycats," Shepard said before the meeting. "But all three were immediate, personal, emotional problems with the young men. One was a boyfriend-girlfriend problem, 
and the others were tamuy 
problems." 
School officials acted quickly 
to prevent more "copycat 
suicides," said Susan 
McDowell, head of psychologi­
cal services for the Evansville­
Vanderburgh School Corpora­
tion. 
"It happens with one, and it 
kind of spreads," she said. 
"Kids are kind of impres­
sionable and they're easily in­
fluenced. And if they see that 
one of their friends has dealt 
with a problem that way, they 
may try to handle it the same 
way. They don't look at the long 
run." 
Six psychologists and two 
counselors were sent to the 
school of 1,350 students on Wed­
nesday to assist the four coun­
selors normally assigned to 
Reitz. The school corporation 
began a training program for 
Honor

conference. The first step is discussing honesty and formu­lating a definition of an honor code, he said. The next step is finding out to what extent stu­dents want to be involved in an honor code system. 
Non-proctored exams and in­forming on peers are the two most controversial issues over the adoption of an honor code system, said Misiewicz. Both issues were addressed at the conference. 
"It is difficult for faculty members to give up the idea of proctoring exams" said Misiewicz. He said non­proctored exams place greater responsibility on students in a climate established for honesty. 
Informing on peers means reporting fellow students in­volved in academic dishonesty. This practice, also known as non-toleration, is often funda­mental to honor code systems and places additional responsi­bility on students, said Misiewicz. 
Non-toleration poses a diffi­staff in the fall that included education about the danger sig­nals evidenced by youngsters contemplating suicide, and a video tape program about a suicidal student. 
"Almost eight out of 10 kids who commit suicide will leave clues," McDowell said. "They may not talk about it, and typ­ically it's not as overt as telling someone what they're going to do, but they will leave signs of some sort, and that's why we've had our in-service (training) this year." 
The school was to begin a "buddy system" to pair new­comers with older students, and peer counseling groups headed by trained juniors and seniors to talk to troubled youngsters, said principal Christine Settle. 
cult dilemma for students, ac­cording to Associate Provost Father Oliver Williams. "Somehow loyalty has to take the backseat to integrity" he said. "It's not easy. Before you see the value of turning some­one in you have to see that there are high costs in not turning them in." 
Misiewicz thinks a period of education and growth is neces­sary for Notre Dame students to accept the responsibilities created by an honor code. He said, "It's not something that's there, it's an attitude that develops. It's countercultural in our society." 
Instituting an honor code at Notre Dame is a big challenge, said Misiewicz, but he thinks the University can apply its pride in athletics to academics. "We have to look at Notre Dame and find a way of ap­proaching an honor code given our heritage and tradition" he said. 
"I don't know what will hap­pen, but I think that's good" said Misiewicz. "This isn't an area where the administration says 'You must do such and such.' "

Heed the VOICe of divestment 
Listen. It is still there. It is not on the front pages. It is not grabbing the cur­rent headlines. Perhaps, for our pur­poses, it is better that way or even for­gotten altogether. 
Marty Rodgers 
guest column 
Listen. It passes in the wind above 
the trees on our beautifully sculptured 
campus. It is not welcome here for it 
stains and tears at the moral fabric of 
our University. It rattles our buildings 
and destabilizes the ethical cor­
nerstones of this place we call our 
second home. It is the painful evidence 
that we are living and propagating a 
lie. It is a poignant reminder of our 
failure to hear the calling of Christ. 
Listen. Damn. As in Poe's "Telltale 
Heart," it is still there--constantly nag­
ging on our collective conscience. Be­
ckoning a response. Echoing. Rever­
berating. Resounding. Resiliant. 
Haunting. Maybe by our silence we 
shall silence the irritating noise which 
burdens us and which names us an ac­
complice to atrocious acts against 
humanity. Perhaps we may comfort 
our hypocritical souls by rationalizing 
that we are doing all we can by doing 
nothing at all. 
Listen. It is the cry of the children of 
God. It is the cry of the children of South 
Africa. Their irrepressible voices 
defying the weak muffler of selective 
divestment espoused by Father Wil­
liams and the Board of Trustees. As we 
stand in the symbolic shadow of the 
greatest matriarch this world has ever 
known, their lament underscores the 
glowing contradiction present between 
the social responsibility this Catholic 
University proclaims to have for the 
entire human family and its procras­
tination in dealing with the sin of apar­
theid. 
We can be silent for no longer for 
there comes a time when silence is 
nothing short of betrayal. Betrayal to 
the oppressed people of South Africa, 
to our mission, to ourselves and to the 
crucified Christ. 
We can no longer hide behind the veil 
of selective divestment. It simply does 
not work. Selective divestment is a 
morally vacuous position disguised as 
innocent, practical, bottom-line philos­
ophy. The current guidelines to which 
we adhere are a joke by which we seek 
to transfer and to avoid our social re­
sponsibility. Selective divestment 
Doonesbury 
makes a mockery of itself by asserting 
that we can maintain leverage within 
South Africa when the government has 
banned and-Or censored all anti­
apartheid organizations such as the 
United Democratic Front (UDF) and 
African National Congress (ANC). We 
are attempting to dismantle a bastion 
of brutality by noble, but frivolous prin­
ciples which the South African govern­
ment would ban. 
We must wake up and admit that our policy is just not working. Our policy of selective divestment is predicated on the Sullivan Principles which Sullivan himself has recently denounced. Would you stay on a plane if the chief engineer just grabbed a parachute and said that the plane is failing and won't reach its desired destination? As the Supreme Court came to recognize the error of its ways in Korematsu, Dred Scott, and Plessy where it had previously served to justify and augment the sins of rac­ism and prejudice, so too Notre Dame must rescind its current and equally erroneous stance regarding South Africa. 
As the Supreme Court realized that these precedents were incongruous with the Constitution--the living docu­ment upon which our nation is founded­-so too we must realize that our current policy of selective divestment must be reversed, for it is undermining the eth­ical matrices upon which the very con­struction of our University rests. 
Under the guise of selective divest­ment, Notre Dame has issued a hypocritical message which it shall prove to regret. Even the Holy Cross community and U.S. Catholic Bishops have realized that such policies do not work and have withdrawn their re­sources from the oppressive machinery of apartheid. 
One day, hopefully soon, Notre Dame will see that it has fallen short of the beatific calling of Christ and remove its investments. But when will that day of reckoning come? When will Notre Dame confess its sin and no longer wal­low in the valley of indecision and in­consistency? The words of Dr. Martin Luther King answer that question for us: 
"I know you are asking today, 'How long will it take?' I come to you this afternoon however difficult the mo­ment, however frustrating the hour, it will not be long, because truth pressed to earth will rise again. How long? Not long, because no lie can live forever. 
FCKJR MONTHS, FaR~ MllfT'S 7Ht ()IFFERENC&~ ANPHAvt 7HE FAMILY MOV!3 IN, 700! 7HtMORe 
How long? Not long, because you still reap what you sow. How long? Not long, because the arm of the moral universe is long but it blends towards justice." 
Listen. This Sunday, Palm Sunday, when you listen to the Passion of Christ, listen to the cries of the children of South Africa. This Sunday, when you reflect on the hypocritical sign of the Kiss of Judas and the betrayal of Christ, reflect also on our hypocritical sign of selective divestment and our betrayal of Christ, of our mission, and of our­selves. This Sunday when you pray, pray for the children of South Africa and pray that the inevitable day on which Notre Dame acknowledges it has walked an errant path will be soon. Truth is calling. Listen.

P.O. Box Q 
Bookstore: an athletic tradition 
Dear Editor: 
One of the great traditions of Spring at Notre Dame is An Tostal Weekend and the related event called Bookstore Basketball. Over 600 teams are sched­uled to compete in this latter activity. For some, it is a lighthearted moment, with crazy costumes, a bit of self­mockery and a chance to participate in a special Notre Dame experience. For others, it is an opportunity for testing their skills against some of the better student athletes in the country. 
Unfortunately, there have been times in the recent past where the spirit of camaraderie and good times was marred by verbal displays and crowd behavior that suggested racial and eth­nic attitudes that are totally unaccep­table in this community. We are working hard on creating a more diverse student body here at Notre Dame. Next fall we will begin a year­long celebration of cultural diversity. Now is the time for each of us to commit ourself to this positive development. 
Racism is one of the great scourges in world affairs and in our national his­tory. There is no place at Notre Dame for comments or actions that display racial or ethnic insensitivity. I am con­fident that together we can celebrate this Rite of Spring in a proper Notre Dame fashion. Thank you for your help. 
Rev. Edward A. Malloy President March 24, 1988 
South Africans wrongly depicted 
Dear Editor: 
The absurdity of Professor Peter Walshe's attack on President Reagan's South African policy is starkly revealed by his comments regarding the African National Congress. For those who may be unaware, the ANC is an extremely violent terrorist organization which is supported by the Soviet Union and its allies. Contrary to Professor Walshe's contention, the ANC's goal of a com­munist South Africa and the means which it employs are abhorred by the vast majority of black South Africans. Unfortunately, those blacks with the courage to speak out against the ANC are usually executed publicly by a bar­baric process known as "necklacing," which involves burning a person alive by igniting a gasoline-filled tire hung above his fettered body. The ANC has subjected numerous women and children "collaborators" to this in­human act. Yet, in spite of these well documented facts, Professor W alshe contends that the ANC and its "humane leaders," such as Nelson Mandela, are truly representative of the black citizens of South Africa. It is indeed tragic that leftists such as Professor Walshe are working so diligently to im­pose a brutal communist regime upon the people of South Africa. We can only hope that South Africa is spared the fate of nations such as Ethiopia and Angola, which are suffering from the 
disastrous  effects  of  communist  
takeovers.

The decor is pseudo-wood formica and green plastic that appears on the seats, in the plant holders, and in the Astroturf shelf of the mirrored pie rack. The pictures on the wall look like cerebral cross sec­tions of an optimist's head, with clouds and brain tissue forming the strata. 
But the food is well worth put­ting up with the decor. Prices range from $.3 to $7 for entrees, most of which come with side dishes of veggies or salads. We got the Denny's Combo, which offers a large cheeseburger, french fries, and a huge garden salad for $4.05. This meal was quite filling, and not all that ex­pensive. 
The piece de resistance, though, is the Grand Slam Breakfast. The Mercedes of the morning meaL the Bentley of breakfast, the Rolls-Royce of repasts, the Slam includes two eggs any style, two plate-sized buttermilk pancakes, two strips of bacon, and two sausage links.

No alcoholic beverages are sold at the Denny's here in South Bend, although the Den­ny's Pub has proven a popular spot in Florida. The soda served was in generously large glasses and had real ice cubes, not the crushed ice found in cheap diners. 
Getting water glasses refilled can be a problem, though, be­cause service late at night some­times comes up shorthanded. Although the very fr.iendly late night staff tries hard, large groups of people may find a lengthy wait for late night meals. 
But guests of Denny's are 
treated to entertainment pro­
vided by the steady stream of 
Notre Dame and St. Mary's stu­
dents scurrying about the suspi­
ciously inexpensive Motel 6 
(without luggage --hmmm ...) 
next door. 
If you feel like deserting your 
confectionery morals for a day, 
you -:an indulge yourself in 
desserts like the sinfully deli­
cious Chocolate Decadence. 
Chocolate layer cake smothered 
in ice cream and hot fudge is 
the perfect ending to a great 
cheap meal. 
We have been told that the 
Denny's Grand Slam, with a side 
of hash browns and a large 
glass of O.J., is the perfect cure 
to late-night hangovers. Many 
people apparently think this, 
since a line often forms about 
2:.30 a.m. on weekends to 
sample the fare. 
If eating at Denny's is dieteti­
cally criminaL we'll be repeat 
offenders.

PLAY REVIEW 
' :0:';.:: 
the plot follows rival presidential candidates' moral dilemmas in the heat of the race for nomina­tion at the party convention. 
SHEILA M.CULM accent writer 
}\ re you tired of going to the 1"\same restaurant every time your parents come in for a weekend? Are you sick of paying for overpriced meals when you're out on a date? Or, are you bored with the dining hall and with fast-food? The Old Spaghetti Works in downtown South Bend might just be the alternative you've been looking for. 
RESTAURANT " 
0. ;.: :-: 0 
The Old Spaghetti Works devotes itself to making fine Italian cusine at a price that won't drain your wallet. The homemade pastas come with a variety of sauces, and also keep with the Italian tradition of ser­ving generous portions.~ 
The atmosphere is casual. The restaurant, formerly part of an old Singer Sewing machine fac­tory has a decor reminiscent of the turn of the century. Ferns, antiques, and a train car that you can dine in all add to the effect. 
Allee Russell (Maggie McDonald), left, wife of a presidential hopeful, and Sue-Ellen Gamadge (Susan Elias) "Hustle with RusseD" In the photo at left. At right, the pair support Allee's husband Bill, played by Joe Markey, in "The Best Man." 
Although the candidates were fictitious, Gore Vidal threw past and present political figures into his tight dialogue. The candi­dates' parties went unmentioned, but from the clues, it wasn't Re· 
. publican. The writer didn't im­mediately win the audience's sympathy for his likeable intel­lectual candidate, William Russell (played by Joe Markey), but the more charasmatic but devlish Joseph cantwell (played by Matt Azer) aroused interest from the start. 
Susan Elias turned in a neat performance of the party 
The menu is predominantly 
Italian and for a good reason: 
that is what the Sphaghetti 
Works does best. Each table is 
given a bottomless basket of 
garlic bread to begin the meal. 
And if you still can't wait for the 
entree, the appetizers are a solu­
tion. The fried zucchini is a good 
choice. It is cut into large 
pieces, dipped in a tempura-like 
batter and deep fried. 
Each entree comes with a soup and salad. The soup is a robust homemade minestrone that tends to be spicy. The small dinner salad comes with your choice of dressing. The poppy seed dressing is recommended as it is not too sweet or sour. 
Then, as if you haven't eaten enough, the entree arrives. The pastas come with your choice of a marinara, meat, hunter's, alfredo, white clam, or red clam sauce. The hunter's sauce is different from the traditional spaghetti sauces. It is a brown sauce full of fresh vegetables and mixed with sweet, dry ver­mouth. The oven entrees include a homemade sausage lasagna that would fill even the largest stomach, ann a fresh eggplant socialite, annoying everyone appropriately. Also notable for good characterizations were Christopher Riordan as dying President Arthur Hockstader (the last "real hick" president), Martin Schubert as Major Sheldon Marcus, and Alicia Alley as Cantwell's bubbly Southern wife. On the whole, all major charac­ters played well and should prove even more enterta!ning for this weekend's performances. 
The opening-night jitters should be resolved by 

parmigiana which is baked and served on a bed of fettucini. The menu also features a variety of Italian sandwiches and homemade pizza. For those who have not yet had their fill, the Spaghetti Works offers some Italian desserts including spumoni, Italian ices, and can­nolis. 
The moderate prices, large portions and atmosphere make the Spaghetti Works a bargain. Entrees range in price from $5.75 for pasta with marinara sauce to $10.95 for the New York strip steak. There are daily dinner specials that cut the price of a specific entree by $1. Reservations are recommended for the weekends, but weekdays are typically not as crowded. A sign near the door recommends that dress be "casual but neat." 
The Old Spaghetti Works is an excellent alternative to the usual dining hall fare. The prices are right and the quality of both the food and the service are excel­lent. The Old Spaghetti Works is a tasty addition to the South Bend restaurant scene.

Bridget's: an old favorite 
DAN GERLACH accent writer 
H
ome football and basketball games, SYR's, An Tostal are events that most Notre Dame students will fondly recall after graduation. I. however, will also remember the fun times I spent at Bridget McGuire's Filling Sta­tion, a.k.a. Bridget's, a.k.a. Dan's second home. 
BAR BEAT : 
:-:~ z W' : ' 
A scant five minute drive from the recesses of D-2 by 1979 or­ange Ford Pinto, Bridget's offers reasonably priced drink specials, a relaxed atmosphere, and op­portunities to meet lots of people from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. I prefer to park in the back, as I am that much closer to the Great American Hot Dog Stand for post-bar nourish­ment. 
Upon entering. I never fail to be greeted by my favorite South Bend policeman who asks for my ID and says things like, "Say, kid, is this really you?" and "Weren't you in here last night-­when do you study?" Once in­side, proceed straight ahead to the bar. This might take quite a bit of doing on crowded nights, which is why it is not such a bad Idea to frequent Bridget's on Mondays, Wednesdays, some Tuesdays and Thursdays--when everyone else is In the 'brar. 
Do not be discouraged; Bridget's bartenders keep things moving. although there are never enough of them. It's espe­cially a problem on weekends, and can get frustrating after a seemingly endless wait with thirsty Domers on each side. Upon ordering. be sure to flash a bill or two (this will catch the bartender's eye) and know what you want ("Two specials)" is my most frequent order.) Ordering two beers at a time can often prove to be a time-saver. 
Bridget's offers other activities as well. Pool playing is a big favorite, mainly because the pool table is smack dab in the middle of the bar. I must cau­tion you that their pool table has had more beer spilled on it than most breweries produce in a month, and pool sticks in the ribs can be quite painful when carrying beers back to your friends. 
The music is solid: you can always hear It--as long as you're within a one block radius. I warn against singing along with the tapes, because they often quit in the middle of songs, and sing­ing alone in a bar is quite em­barrassing. 
I highly recommend casual dress (nannel shirts and old jeans are preferable) as beer has a way of getting spilled on that new blouse or shirt. I also rec­ommend ordering specials: eighty-five cent Molsons on Thursdays, quarter beers on some Wednesdays (with a $2 cover) and ninety cent 16 oz. drafts on Mondays are all worthwhile bets. I personally miss the old fifty-five cent draft specials and the ninety cent vodka and grapefruit specials. 
Bridget's has begun to feature bands on occasion, giving yet another reason to stop by. Al­though It is by far and away my favorite, I warn you that Bridget's Is not for everyone, but on weeknights, It Is a fun place to relax and talk with your friends, while meeting new people at the bar or in line for the bathroom. Hopefully, I'll see you there Monday night; I'll be the one who looks like he's just come home. 
'Intimate Jazz' creates mood 
T
BETH HEALY accent writer he lights are low, the air is smokey and everyone in the Blue Wisp Club is ready for the sultry jazz tunes of the Steve Schmidt Trio jazz band to come out. sit down, and start playing the sounds that they're known for around Cincinnati. 
MUSIC ~, 
The goal of the Michiana Jazz Society, in association with WVPE FM88, is to recreate this type of informal jazz atmosphere. "In­timate Jazz" is the title of a se­ries of three concerts that will be held in South Bend with the Steve Scmidt Trio and a different featured artist each session. 
The Steve Schmidt Trio is a jazz band that makes its home in the Blue Wisp Club in Cincin­nati. The band has produced six albums and is well known in Cincinnati jazz cirles. The band's namessake, Steve Schmidt, plays the piano. He also used to play for Count Basic's Big Band. The bass player, Mike Sharfe, is es­pecially well known in Cincinnati. The band's drummer, John Von Ohlen, is the most well known member of the group. He played with Woodie Hermann's Big Band, as well as Stan Kenten. 
"Some people think that he's one of the best drummers in the world," said Dr. Philip Schneider of the Michiana Jazz Society. "When I was in Cincinnati I used to enjoy just sitting back and watching him play. It's a very subtle kind of playing." 
One of the reasons the Jazz society is bringing the band to Indiana is because Michiana is a very jazz-conscious community, shown by the high numbers of jazz festivals in the area, as well as the popularity of WVPE. 
"WVPE is a very high quality jazz station. Even Cincinnati doesn't have a station as jazz-oriented as Michiana, "commented Schneider. 
The first artist to be featured is guitarist Bruce Forman. He will be playing with The Steve Schmidt Trio on March 25 at the Erskine Club House in South Bend, from 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 
a.m. Tickets are available by mail. at Nightwinds Record Stroe, Record Connection and at the door for $15.00.

Track moves out, hosts ND Invite 
By MIKE SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
After spending a long, cold winter running indoors, the Notre Dame men's track team moves outdoors to greet the spring weather. The Irish open the season this Saturday at home, hosting the Notre Dame Invitational. 
As can be expected, the team is eager to begin the outdoor season. 
"We're very enthusiastic about the outdoor season," said head coach Joe Piane. "Any time you have a long break you're especially excited about starting again. It should be a really interesting season." 
This Saturday's meet wwill feature such teams as the Uni­versity of Detroit, Western Michigan, Aquinas College, Lewis, and Southwestern Mic­higan. "Most of our athletes haven't run since the end of February, so we're opening with a fairly low key meet to get them going,'' explained Piane. 
Among the Irish athletes competing this weekend is sophomore Glenn Watson. 
After an excellent indoor season in the 55 meter high tiurdles, Watson should be even better in the 110 meter high hurdles. 
Freshman Robert Harris will get his first shot in the 200 me­ter dash. "Robert should be very good in the 200 meters this year," said Piane. 
Sophomore Yan Searcy and junior David Warth both will compete in the 800 meter run for the Irish, and senior Dan Cahill will be running the steeple chase, a "new and dif­ferent event," according to Piane. 
As Notre Dame begins its outdoor season, one of its most important goals is to qualify runners for the NCAA Cham­pionships. In particular Piane is looking for senior co-captain Dan Garrett, junior Ron Markezich, and Sophomore Mike O'Connor to qualify. The 4x100 and 4x400 meter relay teams also are expected to have good seasons. This Saturday's meet on the Monogram Track in Krause Stadium will begin at 1:00 with the field events. Running events start at 2:00.

Irish find solace at home 
Women's tennis hosts E. Michigan tonight at Eck 
By FRANK PASTOR 
Sports Writer 
Mter ten straight matches on the road, the Notre Dame wo­men's tennis team returns to the friendly confines of the Eck Tennis Pavilion tonight at 6 to take on Eastern Michigan. 
Home sweet home. 
For many teams, a month­long road spin can be hazar­dous to both their record and their confidence level. For a team as young as this year's Irish squad, the results can be downright calamitous. Just ask coach Michelle Gelfman. 
"Traveling has been a very hard adjustment for all of the freshmen, " says the Irish co­ach. "It has hurt us psychologi­cally as well as physically." 
An important deterrent to the unpleasant effects of the road is the emergence of a team leader. To that end, captain Michelle Dasso has performed admirably. Although the Irish roster is virtually deplete of up­perclassmen, its sole senior is a gem. Like all respected leaders, Dasso leads by exam­ple. 
"Michelle has found a good balance between traveling, academics, and her social life, " says Gelfman. "She is playing extremely well, and I think she'll finish strong for us this year." 
Dasso plays at number-two singles behind freshman Ce Ce Cahill. She also teams with Cahill to form the top doubles tandem for the Irish. The fresh­man's astounding success in

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.­Kevin Strickland scored 11 of his 12 second-half points during a 22-10 spurt that brought Duke from behind for a 73-72 victory over upstart Rhode Island in the NCAA East Regional semi­finals Thursday night.

The fifth-ranked Hlue Devils, 27-6, play the winner of Thursday night's second game between top-ranked Temple and Richmond in Saturday's regional final. Temple had beaten Rhode Island, its Atlan­tic 10 Conference rival, all three times they met this season. 
Duke, which led by as many as 13 points early in the first half, trailed 51-46 with 15 minutes left in the game. 
The Blue Devils, looking to make their sixth trip to the I<'inal Four, responded with their 22-10 spurt in the next 13 minutes, with Strickland hit­ting two free throws to make it 68-61 with 2: 13 left. He also hit Duke's only 3-pointer during the rally.

NCAA Southeast Regional Thursday night. 
The Sooners, topping the 100­point mark for the 20th time this season, surged to an early 11-point lead in the second half, saw Louisville close to 76-74 midway through the half and then pulled away again. 
It was the seventh victory in a row and the 19th in 20 games for the Sooners, 33-3, who will face Villanova in the regional title game on Saturday for a berth in next week's Final Four in Kansas City. 
Villanova, playing near flaw­less ball, upset No. 6 Kentucky 
Rhode Island, which finished the season 28-7 after upsetting Missouri and Syracuse in the first and second rounds, closed the gap to 68-65 on two free throws by Kenny Green with 
1:10 left. 
But Robert Brickey, who scored 15 points, hit four straight free throws in the final 
1:04 and grabbed a key rebound off a missed free throw by 
Strickland  with  50  seconds  
remaining.  
Brickey's  two  ·free  throws  

with 13 seconds left made it 73­
69. Rhode Island rushed the ball upcourt without a timeout and got a 3-pointer from Carlton Owens, the Rams' only 3-point goal of the game, with seven seconds to go. 
Duke quickly inbounded the ball, and no Rhode Island player could stop the clock with a foul before the game ended. 
Danny Ferry led Duke with 17 pojnts, Strickland finished with 14 and John Smith 12. 
Rhode Island was led by Owens with 19 points and John Evans, Tom Garrick and Mer­gin Sina with 14 each. Garrick had averaged 30 points in Rhode Island's five previous postseason games, which in­cluded a 68-63 loss to Temple in the Atlantic 10 tournament final. 
80-74 in the other semifinal 
game Thursday night. 
Grant hit his first six shots 
of the second half, including the 
team's first four baskets to help 
build a 64-53 lead with 17:22 to 
play. 
Louisville, 24-11, made a run on two baskets by substitute Mike Abram and another pair by Herbert Crook, cutting the lead to 76-74 with 9:54 to play. 
The Sooners wasted little time in asserting control again. 
Dave Sieger sank a 3-point basket and King followed with a three-point play to build the lead to 82-74 with 9:18 to play. The Cards never got closer than six points the rest of the way.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.­-Mike Vreeswyk scored eight of his 19 points in a 20-8 spurt mid­way through the second half as No. 1 ranked Temple defeated Richmond 69-47 Thursday night in the NCAA East semi­finals, ending the Spiders string of postseason surprises.

The victory was the 18th straight for the top-seeded Owls, 32-1, and moved them into Saturday's regional cham­pionship game against second­seeded Duke, which defeated Rhode Island 73-72. The teams have not played this season. 
Temple, which went into the game as the No. 1 ranked team in defensive field goal percentage at 39.5 percent, rarely was threatened against Richmond. The Owls' stingy matchup zone constantly forced the Spiders to shoot from much farther than they wanted. 
Richmond, the champions of the Colonial Athletic Associa­tion, stayed close for about 24 minutes. Then the Owls took over behind Vreeswyk and sensational freshman guard Mark Macon, who scored 24 points. 
Leading 39-34, Macon hit a 15­foot jumper to start the Owls on their big run, and Vreeswyk followed with two free throws. Point guard Howard Evans converted a layup off a steal, and after Steve Kratzer hit a layup for Richmond, Evans fol­lowed with a 3-point shot for a 48-36 lead. 
Vreeswyk added a pair of 3­point field goals late in the r.un and Macon finished it with a turnaround jumper from 15 feet for a 59-42 edge. 
Tim Perry and Evans both finished with 11 points for Temple. 
Ken Atkinson led the Spiders with 15 points. 
Richmond, 26-7, was the 13th seed in the East, the lowest left in the tournament. The Spiders defeated defending national champion Indiana and Georgia Tech in advancing this far, but were no match for Temple. 
Kansas influences Midwest action 
Associated Press 
PONTIAC, Mich.--There should be plenty of fans from the state of Kansas in the Sil­verdome Friday night as a team from the state plays in each game of the Midwest Regional semifinals.

Kansas takes on Vanderbilt in the opening game while Kansas State meets Purdue in the second game. 
Both coaches talked of pride in the Big Eight Conference and in the state for having two teams in the 16 teams still remammg but downplayed pointing toward a meeting. 
"Kansas State has to got to be happy if we win because they've proved they can beat us," Kansas Coach Larry Brown said. 
Kansas State beat the J ayhawks two of three times the schools met this season, in­cluding a 72-61 victory that snapped Kansas' 55-game home winning streak. 
PONTIAC, Mich.-­
Vanderbilt guard Barry 
Goheen had nothing but praise 
for Commodore fans. 
''The Vanderbilt community 
and the city of Nashville has 
been sort of electric since our 
win," Goheen said of the over­
time victory over Pittsburgh 
last Sunday. "It's about time 
they've had something to cheer 
for. It's been 14 years since 
Vanderbilt has been in the 
NCAAs and the community and 
the fans deserve this. They've 
been great all year." 
This is Vanderbilt's third ap­pearance in the tournament and the Commodores came within two points of the Final Four in 1964. Michigan, led by Cazzie Russell, beat Vanderbilt 87-85 in the Mideast Regional final that year to advance to the Final Four . 
PONTIAC, Mich.--The Big Eight and Big Ten are the only conference to have three teams each in the round of 16. 
Kansas and Kansas State of the Big Eight are both in the Midwest Regional, while Okla­homa is the top seed in the Sout­heast. 
Purdue is the top seed in the Midwest, while Iowa and Mic­higan are both in the West Regional. 
The appearance in the round of 16 is the third straight for Kansas and the Jayhawks are one of only three teams to have advanced that far in each of the last three tournaments. Duke and North Carolina are the others. 
PONTIAC, Mich.--The Sil­verdome is an imposing struc­ture but the players who prac­
ticed on it Thursday for this weekend's Midwest Regional didn't seem that impressed.

QB Fouts retires 
Associated Press 
RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif.­
-Quarterback Dan Fouts, who 
directed San Diego's record­
setting offense of the late 1970s 
and early 1980s, retired 
Thursday, saying his body 
could not take the battering of 
another football season. 
"After 15 years, this body has taken about as many hits as it can,'' Fouts said in a news con­ference at his Rancho Santa Fe estate, about 20 miles north of San Diego. "It's just time for me to move on to a new phase in my life. 
"I feel fortunate that I have my health intact, that I have all my teeth, and that I have a few yet-unscrambled brain cells. Really, that's the way I want to go through the rest of my life. I want to enjoy it, and I believe I will." 
Fouts, 36, said his decision to retire was a mutual one by him and club officials. At no time was he pressured into leaving, adding that he did not consider going to another team. 
Fouts acknowledged there had been differences at times between him and some club of­ficials, including owner Alex Spanos. But asked if he held any grudges, Fouts said, "No, there really aren't any." 
The club reportedly reached a contract buyout agreement with Fouts last November in which the six-time Pro Bowler gave up all contractual guaran­tees beyond 1987 in return for an undisclosed bonus, last year's full $750,000 salary despite the strike-interrupted season, and $375,000 for 1988, when the pact expired. 
The Chargers, meanwhile, have been actively trying to trade for an experienced quar­terback because backup Mark Herrmann has been effective only in relief and third-stringer Mark Vlasic, a rookie last year, lacks seasoning. 
The holder of seven NFL passing marks and 42 club records, Fouts once was con­sidered among the league's most durable quarterbacks.

three varsity football players,

Another rule that is part of 
the uniqueness of Bookstore 
Basketball-is that games are 
played regardless of weather

usual to see thunderstorms and 
snow fall on the campus during 
the tournament, but the games 
go on. Also, no substitutions or 
time outs are allowed. Free

worth one point, and the games 
are played to 21. 
In 1978, the tournament was 
given national attention in a 
four-page Sports Illustrated ar­
ticle in the May 15 issue. The 
writer, Rick Telander, joined a 
team undercover and did not 
interview players openly to 
avoid glory-seeking students. 
"I've never seen a campus

Special to The Observer 
Freshman Leszek Nowosielski was named second-team All-American in the men's sabre competi­tion as he put the Notre Dame men's fencing team in third place in the NCAA Championships after the first day of competition. 
Columbia leads the team standings with 30 points, fol­lowed by Penn State with 28 and Notre Dame with 27. The foil competition will be held today, and the tournament concludes Saturday with the epee competition. 
"It could be worse, it could be better," said Irish head coach Mike DiCicco. "I think we're in a decent posi­tion. Leszek gives our foilists and epeeists a chance to win the title." 
Nowosielski placed fourth in the individual competi­tion, qualifying for the final round of six before losing his first match to Chris Reohn of Columbia, who finished second. Nowosielski then defeated David Cox of Penn State 10-7, but lost to Peter Cox of the samJ school by the same school for fourth place. 
Nowosielski became the first freshman All-American since Notre Dame foilist Charles Higgs-Coulthard did it in 1984, and the first fresh­man All-American in the sabre competition since Notre Dame's Mike Sullivan did it in 1976. Both Higgs­Coulthard and Sullivan were By PETE SKIKO

Villanova upsets Kentucky 
Associated Press 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--Doug West and Mark Plansky keyed a late first-half run, giving Vil­lanova a lead it never lost as the Wildcats upset sixth­ranked Kentucky 80-74 in the NCAA Southeast Regional semifinals Thursday night. 

The lone Big East represen­tative remaining from the six who started the tournament turned aside favored Kentucky with a nearly flawless perfor­mance. 
Plansky scored five points and West four in a 14-3 burst in the last 4: 30 of the half to create a 43-32 lead. Villanova, 24-12, built its lead to 49-36 early in the second half and withstood a pair of surges that twice saw Kentucky get within four points. 
The victory sent the sixth­seeded Wildcats, who won the national championship in 1985, into Saturday's regional title game against the winner of 
Thursday  night's  clash  be­ 
tween  No.  4 Oklahoma  and  
Louisville.  

Kentucky, finishing 27-6, first got within four at 63-59 with just under nine minutes remaining, but a 3-point basket by Kenny Wilson ended that threat. 
The Southeastern Confer­ence champions got within 74­70 with 2:04 to go, but Villanova milked the 45-second shot clock and West, who finished with 20 points, converted a 12-footer. 
Plansky and Wilson each hit two free throws in the final 33 seconds to create eight-point leads as Villanova went 17 of 17 from the free throw line in the game.
