National leaders debate immigration 
Speakers collaborate, differ on reform proposals, economic impact, social justice 
By KAITLYNN REILY Assistant News Editor 
four leading voices in the national debate about immi­gration reform spoke to the Notre Dame community Monday about showing com­passion for the illegal aliens living within American bor­ders while enforcing immigra­tion laws. 
Hay Suarez, a senior corre­spondent for The Newsllour with Jim Lehrer and the mod­erator for the third annual Notre Dame Forum, opened the event in the Joyce Center with a film that provided a face for one of the roughly 12 million immigrants who have come to the U.S. illegally. 
The Mexican immigrant 
knew she was breaking the law but entered the U.S. any­way to live and work so she could pay for her daughters' educations. But the immi­grant, the video showed, was caught, and is certain she will face deportation. 
In the film, Notre Dame the­ology professor Father Daniel Groody spoke about Catholic social teaching on immigra­tion. 
"A nation has a right to con­trol borders," he said. "But it's not an absolute right. In controlling its borders, it must respect human rights."

ORLH boasts plans for Duncan Hall 
New dorm scheduled to open nextfall; committee encourages students to browse info on Web site 
The ladder system 
Students can view the floor plans of Duncan Hall on the home page of the Office of Residence Life and Housing's Web site. 
Color-coded rooms on the floor plan indicate "super­quads" and "super-doubles," which will have personal bath­rooms. 
The decision to incorporate these features is part of a design envisioned by the Future of Residence Life Committee, ORLH Director Jeff Shoup said. The committee was created three years ago and was co­chaired by Ann Firth, associate vice president of Student Affairs, and Bill Kirk, associate vice president of Residence Life.

Professor lectures on Aquinas 
Scholar encourages a skeptical reading 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 
A professor from Boston College said St. Aquinas writ­ings should not be taken liter­ally and should be read skepti­cally in the opening of the Philosophy Lecture Series at Saint Mary's Monday. 
Eileen Sweeney spoke on "Reading Thomas Aquinas: Myths, Dangers and Virtues" to about thirty audience mem­bers in Haggar Hall. 
"Aquinas is still, among Catholics, a weapon in the cul­ture wars," she said, adding that, because his writings aren't Scripture, "we should be even more skeptical of him." 
Sweeney's lecture focused on Aquinas' theories and writings -especially his Summa Theologica. She compared her lecture idea to a "top-1 0 list." Sweeney presented three top­six lists -one each on the myths, dangers and virtues of Aquinas' teachings. 
Throughout the lecture, she made various references to the Jesuits' idea of a verbal exami­nation, referencing her father, who underwent such an exam­ination during his youth. She said she thought her father would be proud since, while teaching at Marquette, she "served on a board of examin­ers for young .Jesuits." 
Sweeney also analyzed Aquinas' views on humanity before and after the "fall" from the Garden of Eden. He

TeaclUngchange needed, ND theology chair says 
By DAVIS RHORER, Jr. 
News Writer 
If some students find it diflicult to engage in catechetieal study, hearing doctrinal lessons from a peer teacher might solve the prob­lem, the chair of Notre Dame's theology department said Monday. 
John Cavadini addressed ways to revitalize teaching theology, including the two-year Echo faith­formation leadership program. The program aims to allow new students of Catholicism to connect with other young people in the faith. 
Cavadini spoke to a small audi­ence, consisting primarily of theol­ogy students, in the Oak Room in South Dining Hall. He stressed the importance of having a clear belief in Catholic doctrine ­rather than simply a distant knowledge. 
"What's at stake is the revela­tion of God's love to us," he said. 
Experience in high school and college theology classrooms indi­cated to Cavadini how little U.S. students understand of Catholic doetrine, he said. He singled out poor instruction from parish cate­chetical programs. The age differ­ence between students and their catechetical teachers -which averages 55 years -does not always facilitate classroom con­nections.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 


Self-defense class discussed 
Group deliberates merits of co-sponsoring workshops for women 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
News Writer 

Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) debated Monday becoming a co-sponsor of an upcoming self-defense workshop for women. 
Maura Clougherty, a member of the Residence Hall Association, introduced plans to host Erin Weed, the founder of Girls Fight Back. a safety and self-defense group for women. 
Weed founded Girls Fight Back in 2001 after her friend was murdered, Clougherty said. 
"She is teaching you the 
knowledge and to have the con­fidence to protect yourself." Clougherty said. "Erin Weed shows that women are their best protectors." 
Weed travels and speaks to more than 100,000 women per year for the group, which pro­vides free information to women who could not other­wise afford books or seminars on self-defense. 
Weed's courses are somewhat unconventional, Clougherty said. 
"It's different from other self defense classes," she said. "She is in a business suit and heels." 
The program will be held on Nov. 6 in Carroll Auditorium at 7 p.m. and is free to students. 
Barry Bowles. general man­ager of dining facilities, also spoke to BOG. He anwered some of the board's questions about nutritional information for meals in Noble Family Dining I !all. 
"If you are looking for a nutri­tional source, it's there," Bowles said, referring to the Dining Hall's Web site. 
The site includes nutrition facts and allergy information for all the meals at Saint Mary's, he said.

It doesn't have a mascot yet -but Notre Dame's newest res­idence hall will be in a class of its own, blending the notable qualities of other residence halls on campus. 
When Duncan Hall opens next fall, it will mark the first time the University has added a new residence hall on campus in more than 10 years. 
Located south of Pangborn Hall and east of McGlinn Hall, Duncan will be the newest addi­tion to West Quad. 
Duncan will boast a mixture of single, double, triple and quad-· style rooms, but its most talked­about features are personal bathrooms and bay windows.

When I was first told last February 
that I was required to write an 
Inside Column at some point during 
tho snnwster to reeeive a payehnck 
from this nnwspaper, our former 
news nditor told me that the easiest 
thing to write about is something I 
care about. 
So naturally, I John Tiemey 
decided to write 
News Wire 
about skydiving. 
Editor
That might 
havn been a 
good dwiee if I had ever actually 
gone skydiving, but since I hadn't, it 
was slightly sketr.h. 
So today, I'm going to ar.tually fol­
low my editor's advice and writn 
about tho baseball playoffs. 
For those of us who vinw football 
season as a filler from the World 
Serins to Spring Training, the base­
ball playoffs arP the greatest thing to 
hit Ameriea since tlw Deelaration of 
lndep1~mienee. And this year's play­
ofTs arn looking pretty good so far. 
At lnast bntlnr than thn latest ehia 
pnt alarm doek that some spammer 
trine( to snllnw last wonk. 
Wn'vn hnen treated to some great 
games so far, if not necessarily great 
series. (;ames likn (;;une 2 of the 
Yank1ws-lndians snries-which was 
a groat pitchers' duPI (Fausto 
Carmona is a bailer) and gavn us 
two innings of bonus baseball -arn 
any baseball fan's drnam. 
Best o(all. it ended with a bunch of angry New Yorkers whining about tlw angry bugs swarming the field and conspiring to lix the gam11, as if gnats wern NBA refs or something. 
Games like Game 3 of the Cubs­
Diamondbacks series turn me on 
too. Especially since I'm aD-Backs 
fan. And we won. When Livan 
llernandez got Mark DeHossa to hit 
into a DP in the bottom of the fifth, 
even someone who was in my room 
to wateh the NO-UCLA game and 
who was a self-described "very 
small Twins fan" got excited about 
it. 
While we're talking about the D­Backs, I'd like everyone to know that Stephen Drew is a future Hall of Farner. 
You heard it here first. 
lie's a great defensive shortstop, and if this series was any indication, he's putting it together offensively too (not that three games can really indicate anything). 
The Hed Sox's 6-3 win over the Los Angeles Angles of Anaheim in Game 2, which the Sox won on a ninth inning three-run. walk-off homer by Manny Hamirez ofT the great closer Frankie Hodriguez, was a classic too. I'm no Sox fan, but Manny's homer was orgasmic. 
So what's the moral of this story'? 
Well. as I'm sure you've probably gathered by now, I'm not smart enough to come up with a moral. So there mally isn't one. 
Uut if you're not watching the playoffs. you should. Because they're amazing. And if you are, keep it up. 
And go Diamondbacks!

Golden retriever nurses stray kitten 
STEPHENS CITY, Va. -A stray kitten has found a new mother in a golden retriever, who began producing milk for the gray tabby after hearing its cries. 
The hungry kitten, found in an old tire at a concrete plant, refused to drink from a bottle and her rescuers feared she would die. That's when Honey, the family dog who hadn't given birth in 18 months, stepped in with her motherly instincts. 
"She started licking her and loving her. Within a couple of days. Honey started naturally lactating," said Kathy Martin, whose husband, Jimmy, brought the kitten home six weeks ago. "The kitten took right to her." 

Initially, the family worried such a big dog would be too rough for the tiny feline named Precious. 
Man faces prison for doughnut thefth 
FARMINGTON, Mo.-It's a hefty price for a pastry: A man accused of stealing a 52­cent doughnut could face time in jail. Authorities said Scott 
A. Masters, 41, slipped the doughnut into his sweatshirt without paying, then pushed away a clerk who tried to stop him as he fled the store. 
The push is being treated as minor assault, which transforms a misdemeanor shoplifting charge to a strong­armed robbery with a poten­tial prison term of five to 15 years. Because he has a crim­inal history, prosecutors say they could seek 30 years. 
"Strong-arm robbery? Over a doughnut'? That's impossi­ble," Masters told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch from jail. He admitted that he took the pastry but denied touching the employee. "There's no way I would've pushed a woman over a doughnut."

Symposium focuses on energy 
Event to highlight environmental research during green week 
Special to The Observer 
The sixth annual symposium on Notre Dame Environmental Education and Research (NDEER) will be held Wednesday from 8:15 a.m. to 
4:15 p.m. in the McKenna Hall auditorium. 
Sponsored by the Notre Dame Energy Center, the Office of Research, the Seng Foundation Endowment for Market Based Programs and Catholic Values, and Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts, NDEEH 2007 will focus on energy and the environ­ment. 
Since its inception in 2001, the purpose of NDEER has been to highlight the depth and diversity of environmental research occurring through­out the University and to develop closer ties among the large, multidisciplinary groups of faculty on campus. 
Plenary speakers for the 2007 program include John Ledyard, Allen and Lenabelle Davis Professor of Economics and Social Sciences at the California Institute of Technology and Rodney Ewing, Donald R. Peaeor Collegiate Professor of the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Miehigan. 
Michael J. Mudd, chief exec­utive officer of FutureGen Alliance, a public-private partnership working to build the world's first coal-fueled, near-zero emissions power plant, was originally sched­uled to be a plenary speaker, but will be unable to attend due to an unexpected conflict. Frank lncropera, H. Clifford and Evelyn A. Brosey Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Matthew H. McCloskey Emeritus Dean of the College of Engineering, will deliver Mudd's talk. 
Ledyard pioneered work on the theoretical foundations and applications of mecha­nism design and contributed greatly to the understanding of the roles of incentives and information in markets and organizations. His more applied work has included the development of computer­assisted markets for trading pollution rights, managing resources for spacecraft and instrument design, acquiring logistics contracts, and swap­ping portfolios of thinly traded securities and decision mar­kets. 
Ewing's research involves issues related to nuclear waste disposal. He also is an emeritus regents' professor at the University of New Mexico, where he was a member of the faculty from 197 4 through 1997. He will present a fea­tured lecture focusing on nuclear energy issues in the 21st century. 
Each guest speaker also will participate in a special break­out session facilitated by Notre Dame faculty and in a moderated panel discussion at the end of the conference. 
NDEER 2007 occurs during the University's first ever Energy Week, a student-spon­sored event promoting respon­sible energy use and high­lighting the energy research occurring on campus. The week's theme is "Get Your Green On." 
According to Joan F. Brennecke, the Keating­Crawford Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and Director of the Energy Center, it is vital that students understand and participate in finding solutions for the energy challenges they will face. Activities focused on energy education and aware­ness are planned for each day and include a display of elec­tric cars and hybrid motorcy­cles, solar charge stations for students to power small elec­tronic devices, a calories-to­kilowatts display, carbon diox­ide footprint calculators that students will use to measure their impact on climate change, a wind turbine display constructed by students, infor­mation on renewable energy sources, tours of the Notre Dame power plant, and show­ings of documentaries and energy focused movies such as "A Crude Awakening: The Oil Crash," "Kilowatt Ours" and "An Inconvenient Truth." 

Duncan 
continued from page 1 
The committee gathered a group of faculty members, rec­tors, students and assistant rec­tors to suggest how Duncan would continue the tradition of a rich dorm life at Notre Dame, Shoup said. As a group, they agreed Duncan should model the residence life of older halls such as Morrissey, Alumni and Dillon, using the "ladder system" con­cept. 
"In the ladder system, you start off in a smaller room your fresh­man year, but the longer you stay in the hall, the bigger and better 
your room will get," Shoup said. 
"We feel that we've lost touch with that concept in the newer, more cookie-cut­ter dorms in Mod Quad or West Quad over the past few years, and we're happy to say that we are able to accom­plish that with Duncan."

residents at all four class levels, Duncan will also help eliminate some of the overcrowding in male dorms. Aside from the group of freshmen who will be living in Duncan next year, ORLH is. still finalizing how upperclassmen will enter a lottery to live in the dorm. 
"We're kind of in the beginning phases of talking to rectors on how to fill up Duncan Hall," Shoup said. "Of course, we don't want to make it just a freshman place, and so we're encouraging students to explore Duncan to a greater degree on the ORLH Web site." 
The three-story Duncan Hall will be air-conditioned and con­tain study rooms on each wing. It will also have an exercise room, kitchen, elevator and laundry facilities. To create a sense of community, there will be large social common areas on each floor. Like in St. Edward's Hall, the dorm chapel will be located on the second floor, 
"When you look at the way [West Quad] is set up, it seems more separated from the commu­nity," said Shoup. "But we want it to be more of a centerpiece for the community 
going to have it 

reach out into the greater community." 
As the building is being built, ResLife will continue to make progress in the upcoming months to determine how the Resident Assistants and Hall Government Council will be selected. A mascot has yet to be determined.

considerations was a topic the panelists debatfld -with much disagreement -for nearly two hours. 
The panel members were Louis Barletta, the mayor of llazleton. Pa., Cardinal Hognr Mahony, the archbishop of Los Angeles, Sen. Mnl Martinez, H-Fla., and Gov. Janet Napolitano, D-Ariz. 
Napolitano said she eon­fronts tlw issue of immigra­tion daily in Arizona where, she said. 4,000 illegal immi­grants are apprehended daily. 
Napolitano said the U.S. needs bnttnr border security and bettnr documentation. but also must provide more visas to keep up with demand. 
The hard part of the debate, Napolitano said, is to decid11 what to do with the millions of illegal immigrants already in the country. 
"Dealing with those 12 mil­lion who are alrmuly IH1re and havn alrnady raised tlwir fam­ilios hen1 ... is a vPry dirtkult issun to confront," she said. 
It is an isstw that Barletta has alrnady tried to address. In 2006, Barlotta signed an ordinance that would punish businnssns and landlords in llazlnton that knowingly hired or harbored illngal immi­grants. The eity is currently fighting in court challenges to thP constitutionality of thn ordinanco, which has not yot gorw into dfert. 
llazlnton's grPatest asset is "tlw q u a I ity of I i fn that we enjoy," Barletta said. Criminal activities committed by illegal immigrants motivated him to enaet the ordinance to dis­courage illegal aliens from living in the town, he said. Barletta offered several examples of violent crime committed in Hazleton by ille­gal immigrants, including a domestic stabbing incident and murder. 
"It's unfortunate because not everyone who is here is working hard and a nice per­son," he said. 
Martinez, who is the 

The Catholic Church has "walked with every single wave of immigrants" -both legal and illegal -since the 1780s, said Mahony, the arch­bishop of Los Angeles. 
"We have a moral responsi­bility to deal with the 12 mil­lion people that are here," he said. ''I'm saddened and dis­appointed at the inability of our Congress to pass mean­ingful legislation."

the two-hour forum and "do moral reasoning on a some­what higher level than 'yeah,'

Some audience members spoke toward the forum's end, when Suarez allowed several Notrfl Dame students to ask prepared questions. 
Michelle Saucedo, a sopho­more from Arizona, described how her father was deported to Mexico seven years ago, which left her mother in charge of supporting and rais­ing four children. 
Family separation was a familiar experienee for Martinez, who said he was away from his family for four years when he first arrived in the United States. lie agreed with Napolitano's earlier assessment that the govern­ment must issue more visas to keep up with the demand. 
Sophomore David VanEgmond asked a question that Napolitano said got to the basic point of the debate. The illegal immigrants who have entered the U.S. have commit­ted a crime, he said. 
"Why show them a dispro­portionate amount of compas­sion?" he asked. 
The simple answer to the question, Napolitano said, is if you are here illegally, you should go. But the complicat­ed reality, she said, is that the 
U.S. government can't just deport 12 million people. 
The real answer must be a compromise through which 
the government prohibits ille­gal aliens from gaining citi­zenship unless they fulfill spe­cific requirements, such as paying a fine, waiting in line behind those going through the process legally and learn­ing English, she said. 
The system must allow ille­gal immigrants to "gp,t out of the shadows," Napolitano said. 
The federal government has failed to reform thf1 immigra­tion system, Napolitano said, so state and city ort1cials like she and Barletta have had to move forward independently. 
Martinez said he recognized the stress the federal govern­ment's failurfl to enact reform would put on state legislators. 
"One of the sad legacies of our failure to aet is that eities across America will do what Hazleton has done and the othflr eities will become sanc­tuaries," he said. 
Barletta said that his town's proposfld ordinance has ere­ated a ripple efTeet, as many of the illP-gal immigrants in Hazleton have moved down the road to neighboring com­munities. 
According to a News and Information artiele, about 
3,000  people  attended  
Monday's forum.  
The forum  was  the third  

since Father John Jenkins was inaugurated as University president. The 2006 forum addressed the global health crisis, and in 2005 forum par­ticipants discussod the rolo of religion and faith in a plural­istic world.

Sudan attacks key town in Darfur 
KIIAHTOUM -In a widening offensive, Sudanese forces on Monday attacked a southern Darfur town controlled by the only rebel group that has signod a peace deal with the government. 
The fighting could be a blow to peace talks due this month in Libya aimed at find­ing peace for Darfur. Organizers were already struggling to ensure the fragmented rebel factions would attend, and the new attack could deepen rebel mistrust of the govnrnment. 
It also appeared to be an expansion of an offnnsive the government military has been waging for the past month in northern Darfur, despite promises by President Omar ai-Bashir for a coase-fire ahead of the peace talks. 
Interpol hunts for pedophile suspect 
PARIS -He apparently traveled the world sexually abusing young boys, but remained unidentifiable -until now. 
Police in Europe have unscrambled digitally altemd images found on the Internet to reveal the face of a man shown abusing boys in Vietnam and Cambodia. 
Interpol released four reconstructed photos of the suspected pedophile on Monday in an unprecedented public appeal for help, hoping that someone, somewhere, will recognize the man whose identity and nationality remain a mystery. 
The response has been encouraging: about 200 messages in just over 12 hours, Interpol said. 
But the decision to unmask him is not with­out risk: Tipping criminals off to the techniques that police have at their disposal could also prompt them to better hide their identities.

2 Americans, Briton win Nobel Prize 
NEW YOHK -As a child in Italy during World War II, he lived for years on the streets and in orphanages. Six decades later, as a scientist in the United States, Mario Capecchi joined two other researchers in winning the Nobel Prize in medicine. 
Their work led to a powerful and widely used technique to manipulate genes in mice, which has helped scientists study heart dis­ease, diabetes, cancer, cystic fibrosis and other diseases. 
The $1.54 million prize was awarded Monday to Capecchi, 70, of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City; Oliver Smithies, 82, a native of Britain now at University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, and Sir Martin J. Evans, 66, of Cardiff University in Wales. 
Their "gene-targeting" technique lets sci­entists deactivate or modifying individual genes in mice and observe how those changes affect the animals. That in turn gives clues about what those genes do in human health and disease.

Peterson told Kegley that he had gone to his ex-girl­friend's house early Sunday morning in hopes of patching up the relation­ship after a recent breakup. But, he said, Peterson lost control when the meeting ended in an argument and other people started ridiculing him as a "worthless pig." 
Kegley declined to com­ment when reached by The Associated Press. 
Police, who declined to provide details of the argu­ment, said Peterson stormed out, retrieved an AR-15 rifle from his car outside and burst back into the house firing 30 shots that killed all but one of the people at the party. 
"We had no idea, obvi­ously, that anything like this would ever occur," Crandon Police Chief John Dennee said at a news con­ference Monday. 
Peterson, a deputy and part-time police officer, later died after exchanging gunfire with law enforce­ment officers. Whether Peterson was shot by police or took his own life was unclear. 
The rampage raised questions in the remote northern Wisconsin com-


munity of 2,000 about how Peterson could have met requirements to become a law enforcement officer, especially after police acknowledged Monday that Peterson received no psy­chological screening before he was hired. 
Some questioned the wis­dom of hiring someone so young. 
"No person that I've ever known at 20 years old was responsible enough to be a police officer," said Steve Bocek, of Oak Creek, whose nephew Bradley Schultz was killed. "It's unbelievable. You don't have the mind to be a police officer. It takes a lot." 
But Crandon city attor­ney Lindsay Erickson said age doesn't matter as long as officers do their jobs well. Peterson testified for her in several cases. He wrote good reports and was "true to his job," she said. 
"From what I saw of him, I didn't see any warning signs or red flags," Erickson said. 
Peterson was hired as full-time deputy sheriff on Sept. 11, 2006, at the age of 19, according to person­nel records released by the Forest County clerk. His yearlong probation ended last month. 
Dr. Phil Trompetter, a police psychologist in Modesto, Calif., estimated at least 80 percent of states require psychological test­ing of prospective officers. 

"Wisconsin must be in a very small minority of states," he said. 
The Wisconsin Department of Justice Law Enforcement Standards Board requires only that applicants be free of any emotional or mental condi­tion that might hinder them in their duties. It does not say how that is determined. 
No formal national stan­dards exist for hiring police, although individual states are adopting requirements such as mandatory psychological tests, said Craig Zendzian, author of several guide­books for police applicants. 
AFGHANISTAN 

Govern111ent executes 15; U.N. protests 
Associated Press 

KABUL-Ending a three-year mora­torium on the death penalty, Afghanistan executed 15 prisoners by gunfire, including a man convicted of killing three foreign journalists during the U.S.-led invasion, the prisons chief announced Monday. 
The United Nations protested the executions, which could complicate the missions of some NATO nations here. 
The mass execution took place Sunday evening according to Afghan law, which calls for condemned prison­ers to be shot to death, said Abdul Salam Ismat, who oversees Afghanistan's prisons. 
The crimes committed by those exe­cuted included murder, kidnapping and armed robbery, but officials said no Taliban or al-Qaida fighters were among the prisoners. 
Until it was ousted in late 2001, Afghanistan's hard-line Taliban regime carried out executions in public, many of them at the Kabul stadium. The new government pledged to the internation­al community it would halt executions, and had carried out only one previous­ly, in 2004. 
The 15 deaths could complicate rela­tionships between the government and some NATO countries with military forces here. Foreign troops often hand over captured militants to the Afghan government, raising the question of whether countries that do not use the death penalty might stop surrendering prisoners. 
The Netherlands was one of the first to criticize the Afghan announcement, calling the executions "extremely unwelcome." But it also said Dutch troops would continue to transfer mili­tants to the Afghan government, saying it had an agreement protecting those prisoners from execution. 
Anger over the executions also could prove a snag for NATO's efforts to get its member nations to send more troops to Afghanistan. NATO has some 40,000 soldiers here but commanders complain they need more helicopters, mobile troops and instructors to train the Afghan army.

IN BRIEF 
Power generating firm settles lawsuit 
WASHINGTON -One of the nation's largest power generators has agreed to end a years­long federal lawsuit by paying $4.6 billion to reduce pollution that has eaten away at Northeast mountain ranges and national land­marks. The Associated Press has learned. 
The settlement requires American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, to reduce chemical emissions that cause acid rain by at least 69 percent over the next decade. 
It also lines AEP an additional $15 million in civil penalties and another $60 million in cleanup and mitigation costs to help heal parkland and waterways that have been hurt by the pollution. 
Details of the agreement were provided by two people familiar with its terms who spoke on condition of anonymity Monday because it had not yet been filed in federal court. Spokesmen for AEP declined comment Monday. 

Referendum seems to uphold CAFfA 
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica-Costa Ricans pre­pared on Monday to join a controversial free trade agreement with Central American neigh­bors, the Dominican Republic and the U.S. after a thin majority apparently backed the pact in a national referendum. 
But even Sunday's vote on the Central Amflrican Free Trade Agreement did not end a yearlong battle over the agreement. 
OpponenL'i said they will wait for a mandatory recount, set to begin Tuesday, before recognizing the referendum's results. The ballot-by-ballot recount is mquired by Costa Hican law. and can last no longflr than two weeks. 
With 97 percent of precincts reporting Monday, 

51.5 percent of Costa Hicans voted in favor of the trade deal, which is known as CAFTA. 
Costa Hiea was the lone holdout among the six Latin American nations that now constitute the trade bloc. The pact has already taken effect in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. 

UAW sets deadline for concessions 
Wednesday strike date may be response to Chrysler's bold pushes for cost cutting measures 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -Ifthere was a script that automakers were supposed to follow for UAW contract talks, Chrysler seems to have overlooked it. 
As negotiations contin­ued Monday at Chrysler LLC's Auburn Hills head­quarters, the United Auto Workers set a deadline of Wednesday morning to agree on a new contract, or else workers could strike. 
The deadline may be a tactic the union is using to squeeze some more con­cessions from the compa­ny. But it also may be that Chrysler isn't just going to agree to the same terms that General Motors Corp. did last week just beeause that's how it's traditionally done. 
Chrysler's needs are dif­ferent from GM's require­ments, analysts said. so a deal requires cost cuts in different places. 
The union may have set the strike deadline for its 49,000 hourly workers because of how far Chrysler wants to push for cost cuts.

Church abuse resurfaces 
California bishop praised for handling cases becomes a suspect 
Associated Press 
SANTA ANA, Calif'. -Bishop Tod D. Brown was lauded three years ago for quickly handling Orange County's share of the nationwide ehurch abuse scandal. reach­ing S!lttloments totaling $100 million for some 90 victims. 
But a source of nearly a fifth of those cases -two presti­gious parochial high schools­continues to haunt the diocese and has now exposed Brown to old allegations of' child abuse and the possibility of being held in contempt of' court this week. 
The Homan Catholic Diocese of Orange settled four more lawsuits Friday fiJr just shy of $7 million. Three were liled by former students at Mater Dei and Santa Margarita high schools who said lay teachers sexually abused them. 
In a deposition in one of' the lawsuits, Brown acknowledged being accused of abusing a young boy more than 40 years ago when he was a priest in Bakersfield. lie said the aecu­sation, reported in 1997. is false, but poliee said they can lind no indication it was ever investigated. 
Despite the settlement, Brown still faces a hearing Tuesday to determine whether he should bn held in eontmnpt of court for snnding Msgr. John Urell to Canada for psychologi­cal treatment before he could eornplete a deposition. 
Urell, who was responsible for handling sexual abuse alle­gations against tho diocese, became distraught during a deposition in the case of a 27­year-old woman who said an assistant basketball coach had sox with her multiple times when she was a 16-y<iar-old student at Mater Dei. 
Brown told The Associated Press that he did not violate a court order and considers the hearing an assault on his good character. 

"My only eoneern was for Msgr. Urnll, who needed immediate attention," Brown said. 
Plaintiffs' lawyers say the case involving the eoad1, Jnff Andrade, shows why the two schools have boon a perennial problem: Warning signs were ignored and the abuse was allowed to continue. 
Another teadwr allegedly interceptnd a note that dis­cussed the sexual relationship between Andrade and his accuser, Christina Huiz, but officials did nothing after intervinwing Huiz, hnr best friend and Andrade, she said. Andrade later admitted to the relationship in his dnposition.

ISRAEL 
Politicians debate dividingJerusale111 
Associated Press 
JEHUSALEM -Two senior Israeli politieians, including the prime minister's closest ally. talknd openly Monday about divid­ing Jerusalem, signaling a possi­ble shift in Israeli opinion about one of the Mideast's most con­tentious issues. 
The dispute over Jerusalem has derailed negotiations in the past, and the latest comments come at a time when Israeli and Pah1stinian teams are trying to agrne on prineiples guiding future peace talks. 
The ideas raised by Vice Premier !!aim Ramon still fall far short of Palestinian demands to establish their capital in all of the city's eastern sector, annexed by Israel after the 1967 Mideast War. 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. meanwhile, told parlia­ment he will not be deterred from snnking a pnace deal with the Palestinians. lie said Israel has missed opportunities in the past, and warned that continued failure would mean a "demographic 
''  

struggle steeped in blood and tears." 
Olmert was unusually impas­sioned but short on specifics. He made no mention of Jerusalem. 
Later Monday, Israeli and Palestinian teams met for the first time to start drafting a joint decla­ration of principles that would guide negotiators if peace talks were to resume after a seven-year freeze. 
Abbas aide Yasser Abed Rabbo said afterward that no results could have been expected from the first meeting, but he hoped a meaningful document would emerge. 
The document, which is to address the key disputes -bor­ders, Jerusalem, Israeli settle­ment<;, Palestinian refugees -will be the centerpiece of a U.S.-husted Mideast conference in November. 
Olmert's speech appP.ared to be a careful balancing act -sending an encouraging message to the Palestinians, while not giving his hardline critics at home too much ammunition by going into detail. 
His central theme was a pledge not to miss an opportunity to reach a long-elusive peace deal, even if it requires costly conces­sions. Olmert said Israelis will have to led go of some of the beliefs that "fed the national ethos for many years," a reference to giving up West Bank land. 
Olmert praised Mahmoud Abbas, whom he has met six times since the spring, as a trust­worthy partner, but at the same time portrayed the Palestinian president, known as Abu Mazen, as weak. "I know that the gap between the honest and fair inten­tions of Abu Mazen and [Palestinian Prime Minister1 Salam Fayyad, and their ability to translate that into reality is trou­blesome and arouses concerns," Olmert said. 
Olmert was heckled occasional­ly, but interruptions were mild for Israel's freewheeling parliament. "Is Jerusalem a dream?'' legisla­tor Reuven Rivlin shouted when Olmert, a former Jerusalem mayor, told parliament Israelis would have to forego some of their national dreams and aspirations. 
RUSSIA 
Journalists' slaying remains a mystery 
Investigators say murder motive still unknown 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -After a year and nearly a dozen arrests, the main mystery in the slaying of a Russian journalist strongly crit­ical of the Kremlin remains unsolved -who ordered her killed, the chief investigator said in an interview published Monday. 
Investigators know who pulled the trigger in the fatal shooting of Anna Politikovskaya at her Moscow apartment building, Petros Garibyan, a senior investigator in the Prosecutor General's Office, told the newspaper she worked for, Novaya Gazeta. 
"A'l for those who ordered it, we have interesting sugges­tions, let's put it this way," he was quoted as saying. But he would not reveal what, if any­thing, investigators know about who might have ordered the slaying.

acclaim. 
Her politi­cally charged killing widened the rift between Russia and the West, deepening concern abroad over the Kremlin's treatment of critics under President Vladimir Putin, while hardening his government's depiction of Russia as a nation beset by foes. 
Putin and his chief prosecutor have framed the killing as a plot to discredit Russia, saying the investigation will lead to a mastermind abroad. The editor of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, says the probe will point in the opposite direction, revealing deadly. deep-seated corruption in the security and law enforcement agencies that have gained prominence under Putin. 

In late August. Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika announced that Politkovskaya's killing was organized by a Moscow-based criminal group that specialized in contract killings and was led by an ethnic Chechen. He said 10 people had been arrested, including a handful of current or former law enforcement offi­cers. 
The Federal Security Service, or FSB -Russia's main securi­ty agency and the chief succes­sor to the Soviet KGB -later identified one of those arrested as FSB Lt. Col. Pavel Ryaguzov, and subsequent reports said he was suspeeted of giving Politkovskaya's killers her address. 
Alongside its interview with Garibyan, Novaya Gazeta pub­lished a story recounting the ordeal of Eduard 
slaying. 
said Ryaguzov

Vatican joins environmentalists 
The Vatican, led by Pope Benedict XVI himself, is the latest group to hitch up their cassocks and jump on the environmental bandwagon. In what may be a watershed year for the Church's nascent J earth-friendly mes-ames sage, the Pope has Dechant led several initia­
Foregone 
tiv(~S not only to 
Conclusion 
green up Vatican 
City but also to make Catholics more 
eco-conscious. Last month, the Church 
declared one Sunday "Save Creation 
Day" as the Pope led a youth festival in 
Italy with eco-friendliness foremost on 
its agenda. Earlier in the summer, 
Home announced plans to re-do the 
roof of the Paul VI Auditorium Hall 
with solar panels (imagine a roof cov­ering Notre Dame Stadium). 
Now the Vatican has taken on its most ambitious project yet: It plans to become the world's first carbon-neutral state. Earlier this year, the Church accepted a donation from a Hungarian firm to create a 3 7 -acre "Vatican Climate Forest." Trees planted in the ancient forested area in Hungary, now denuded and abandoned, will theoreti­cally absorb an amount of carbon diox­ide equal to the emissions of Vatican City throughout the year. The move sends a strong message about the "green culture" promulgated by Pope Benedict. 
The rosy picture painted by the theo­ry of carbon neutrality has its draw­backs, however. A Time Magazine piece by columnist Charles Krauthammer this March exposed some of the falla­cies of the "have your cake and eat it too" carbon philosophy. Krauthammer compared the practice to the selling of indulgences (his editorial, written before Rome's announcement. railed against trendy Hollywood eco-fadsters, not the Vatican). We think as long as we pay the piper, we have a free ticket to sin -or pollute, in this case. 
Therein lies the main problem: Carbon neutrality may create new green areas, but it cannot erase the damage you do simultaneously. The idea may even exacerbate the problem by encouraging a free-for-all attitude, spurring us to be carefree in our car­bon burning as we falsely assume it's all being taken care of by a forest somewhere on the other side of the world. 

A statement by the Pontifical Council of Culture equated the offsets to true pollution erasure. "To eliminate emis­sions,'' Monsignor Melchor Sanchez de Toea y Alameda said, "there are two ways: Either you reduce them by renouncing the use of cars or heating systems, for example, or you do some­thing good to compensate them, such as planting trees." Unfortunately, "compensating" is only a stopgap. It's a treatment, not a cure; penance without forgiveness. The real change comes when we actually reduce our negative output. Heliance on new forests won't get us there. 
Carbon neutral sites also have an impermanent eJI'ectiveness. For the first 50 to 150 years of forest growth, trees indeed absorb significant amounts of C02. But when the forest reaches maturity, the potency of this carbon vacuum cleaner declines signif­icantly due to the natural carbon out­put of dying trees. Furthermore, calcu­lations concerning these "offsets" are guesstimates at best -whether the Hungarian forest will really absorb the exact amount of carbon emitted annu­ally by the Vatican is highly specula­tive. 
Those complications may just reduce the luster of the cure-all that is carbon neutrality, but it can be worse. Sometimes, companies forcefully take the land used for offsetting sites from local farmers in economically disad­vantaged countries, even using threats and violence. Krauthammer mentions a Dutch company that has used scare tactics on local inhabitants near a Ugandan national park, all to clear the land so that Western companies may have a dear consdnnce while driving 
their SUVs. 

The Vatkan example avoids some of the pitfalls made by rich multination­als: The site was donated by a local company in Europe. uses free land, and may create jobs in th1~ indigent sur­rounding region. You could accusfl the Vatican of accepting thn Hungarian company's oll'er only to crnato a good public image, true, but the Church is backing up their action with further efforts (like the solar roof). 
More importantly, the Vatican distin­guishes itself from political phonies by embracing sound teaching about the duty to steward God's creation. Preaching a religious message about environmentalism isn't the same as politicizing faith or using it to back a particular philosophy of thn moment­Christianity has contributed to more than its fair share of appropriation. from slavery-backers to holy wars. But in this case, the message is valid, the intent is true, and the methods are sound -mostly. 
You need only wander Home to see the corrosion that its thousands of automobiles do to its church facades, to its air quality, to its trne-lined streets and piazzas. Pollution rears its ugly head in the Eternal City, but the Church can help adjust our course. First. it must wise up on carbon neu­trality. The Hungarian forest is an admirable first step, but it is not enough. The Vatican must then take further steps to set a worthy example, and it should continue its religious teachings about caring for the earth. It must move beyond being a carbon-neu­tral state and become a truly environ­mentalist state.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Don't storm the field 
Is nveryone excited about beating UClA Saturday night and enlebrating a victory for the first time this season? You should be. For the seniors, juniors and sophomores, it was a welcome reminder of what victories in South Bend are like on Saturdays. And it's the first time you freshmen have tasted an Irish win since coming to campus in August. 
But, please, as an alumnus and diehard fan of Notre Dame-the team, school and program-don't let the excitement spill over to embarrassment this weekend if the Irish knock off Boston College. Don't storm the field. 
Sure, beating BC would be a huge moment. It's the No. 4 team in the country. It's undefeated and energized. The Eagles have a lleisman Trophy candidate and likely NFL first-round pick in Matt Ryan. They will come into our sta­dium with a swagger, a sense of confidence that will piss oil' diehard Irish fans. 
And a win Saturday would be a huge moment in our season. Upsetting a top-S team would be another step in building the confidence of our younger guys, and it would give our upperclassmen another great memory about playing for the Irish. 
But there's a reason we refer to Boston College as Fredo, and bull-rushing the field against our weaker, infe­rior little brother would be embarrassing. We would be showing them a sense of respect that they don't deserve. Storming the court against BC in basketball was bad enough when we ended their 20-game winning streak in the 2005-06 season. Let's not surrender to the same temp­tation and make the same mistake in football. 
In 1993, Boston College came into Notre Dame Stadium and abruptly ended our National Championship aspira­tions. Let's do the same thing to them this season. Let's make a statement during the game and scream louder 
Audience behavior disappointing 

As a Notre Dame student, I was highly disappointed in the way that the majority of the Academic Forum's audience conducted itself at the beginning of the event. Implicit in the idea of an academic forum is the understanding that the issue to be discussed is of such eomplexity that it does not avail itself of any easy answers or swift resolutions. Yet, from the beginning of event, the forum audience demonstrated an unreflecting eagerness to apotheosize Senator Martinez and Cardinal Mahoney's positions, responding to their ambiguous opening ealls for "com­prehensive reform" with resound­ing applause. Conversely, the forum audience met Mayor Barletta's description of immigration's uglier side -and the reformative steps he took to combat it -with silent hostility. Later in the forum, Senator Martinez agreed that the punitive actions taken by Mayor Barletta against businesses that knowingly employ illegal immi­grants is a necessary component of the eomprehensive reform plan­an affirmation of the same tactics that were so coldly received at the beginning of the forum. I object not to audience members ultimately concluding that Senator Martinez's or Cardinal Mahoney's positions are correct, but to the audience's unwillingness to approach the immigration issue with a genuine spirit of good will and intellectual inquiry. What Notre Dame wit­nessed before moderator Ray Suarez's "yay-boo morality" chiding was a forum audience gathered together armed with emotional presuppositions, anxious to cele­brate in its own self-righteousness. While such back-slapping sancti­mony might make some feel good, it does nothing to help advance that infinitely popular, infinitely non­existent immigration reform plan.

than we have since the 2005 game against Southern Cal, giving our team the seeond-half energy they will need to earn a win. 
But after we win, let's keep our excitement in the stands. Storming the field is about being an underdog, and Notre Dame is never an underdog against Boston College -regardless of our record. We should never expect to lose to Boston College. And when we beat them this week­end, let's act like we've done it before. 
Becausfl we have.

I was at the UCLA game on Saturday, and I don't think I was ever so proud to be a Notre Dame graduate and to have my three kids attend the University. Twenty-five thousand screaming and supportive Notre Dame fans to watch their 0-5 team play 2,000 miles from the University. Are you kidding me? I don't think I saw a single no-show! 
But what made me even more proud was when, during the second half, the entire Notre Dame seetion in the end zone where I was sit­ting stood and applauded, as three members of our military happened to walk by. Wow! That was truly amazing.

While Wall, Jones and Slim Thug are all strug­gling to get their feet back in the door that was quickly closed on them, only Chamillionaire and UGK are still representing for the Houston rap scene. This says a lot about Chamillionaire's success considering that UGK

where the featured artist Tony Henry sings about situations the average struggling person faces on a daily basis. He captures the hopelessness that socie­ty forces onto certain people, which leads perfectly into the two closing songs "Hocky Hoad" and "Ultimate Victory." 
Chamillionaire's sophomore effort is certainly not "Ultimate Victory," but there are many more rights than wrongs. Hopefully he continues this winning streak and keeps supplying lis­teners with quality music.

Apparently the Hockies have collective­ly fallen and knocked their noggins, thus forgetting they are in fact the Hackies and not the Boston Red Sox or the St. Louis Cardinals. Matt Holiday thinks he's Albert Pujols. rookie Franklin Morales thinks he's Nolan Ryan. Todd Helton version 2007 thinks he's Todd Helton version 2000. Together. the Hackies have made one of the most improbable runs in histo­ry. 
You see, the Hockies haven't made the playoffs in over a decade, and only once before in the club's fourteen year history. They have been the laughing stock of the MLB world, and just two years ago they lost 95 games. But everything has changed. The once-empty stands are sold out and the baseball-apathetic city of Denvflr is buzzing. Coors beer flows like watnr. And the Hackies keep winning.

I'm not afraid to admit it, ram a completely bandwagon fan of the Hackies. I'm a life-long resident of Colorado, but, you have to understand, the Hackies have been bad. I mean, epically bad. They lost games like trees lose leaves-in bunches. Colorado is Broncos coun­try, or Avalanche country, or Buffs country. It is not, and never has been, Rockies country. A large majority of Colorado sports fans are more apathetic about baseball than Americans are about the World Cup. That is, until this year.

In one of the most intense evenings of my life, I watched Matt llolliday slide into home, achieving the impossible in the bot­tom of the 13th as I erupted into cheers. My RA ran out and gave me a hug. But there was no family to jump around with, no brother to high-five, and no local TV stations to cover every last victory moment. TBS went back to regular programming, and I went to bed. 
I have spent the last few weeks announc­ing what I believe to be the most remark­able comeback in baseball history. From an uncomfortable string of losses on the road to a magical winning streak and -gasp ­the posl<>eason, the Rockies have defied all expectations. I wake up each morning and Hackies have the 25th lowest payroll of any team in the majors. Despite over­whelming odds against them, this team has managed to make one of the most exciting runs in baseball history. 

They are the anti-Yankees. They are the underdogs in a battle to the top. They're fun and exciting. For goodness sake-they're the Hackies! So suit up in your purple and black and sit back and tap the Hackies, because as Coloradoans everywhere are saying, it's Hocktober, baby!

I've devoted myself to making this phe­nomenal postseason known. I keep a run­ning chart of who's advancing in the play­offs outside my dorm door. I go to the Grotto before each game and pray for ... world peace, the poor, and Todd Helton. I sport my CH hat everywhere I go. 
When I think of what it would be like to be in Denver right now, living in the city that is, for the first time, more interested in baseball than football, I get extremely homesick. I would give anything to be there, hearing what the Denver Post has to say about the Hackies and feeling that soli­darity. But I know I am not alone. I know there are thousands of Hackies fans throughout the world (at least now with the bandwagon). 
It was hard, though, to watch the game last Saturday (while flipping back and forth to the UClA game) and know that my fami­ly was in the stands without me. I bet there are some Diamondback fans around the Dome who are rearing to go on Thursday. For now, I am content to get Denver arti­cles in the mail and phone calls from the game. And I must admit, it was cool to think about my dad walking out of Coors Field Saturday night and yelling to the crowd, "Notre Dame won!"

Grisharrt fumbles with latest book 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Scene Wri rer 
John Grisham needs to go back to writ­ing legal thrillers. It's not that Grisham's new book is bad. "Playing for Pizza" is a story about a disgraced third-string quarterback for the Cleveland Browns who is forced out of the NFL and ends up playing football in Italy. Uke all his books, it's well written, with an interesting plot line and a sympathetic lead character. 
But Grisham's name is synonymous with thrilling legal battles, with idealistic lawyers struggling for justice against the forces of corruption. His books are best­sellers because readers know Grisham will sweep them away with tales of intrigue, and they will cheer for the pro­tagonist, despite his flaws, as he over­comes the odds. Grisham weaves a nice story in his new book, but it's not a page­turner like his 18 previous novels. 
"Pizza" still retains some Grisham­isms. The book's hero. Rick Dockery, fits the typical Grisham male character mold. He is young and attractive -an underdog with a weakness for women. Dockery becomes Cleveland's public enemy No. 1 after single-handedly losing an AFC Championship game for the Browns. Dockery's agent manages to find him a new team far away in Italy. Even in a land of soccer, there is a Super Bowl. 
So Dockery flees to Parma, Italy, away from the angry fans who tried to storm his hospital bed as he recovered from a concussion, and the Cleveland Post columnist who declares him the greatest goat in the history of professional spo_rts. 
Grisham knows a lot about football. The same attention to detail he once used to describe the murder of Supreme Court justices and a pelican brief is now turned to details about football. Parts of his book read like the sports section of a newspaper. 
By placing Dockery in Italy, Grisham gets a chance to tell his readers all he knows about the country -the food, the eultui"e, the churches and the opera. 
"The Broker," a legal thriller Grisham published in 2005, was also set in Italy. In "Pizza," the country is almost a support­ing character. When Dockery has a day off from practice, his lady friend drags him around Italy to accompany her on a quest to tour the whole country. At times, the reader feels as exhausted from trav­eling as Dockery does. 
Instead of partners or associates in a law firm, the supporting characters in "Pizza" are Dockery's teammates and coach, who play football for their love of the game and, as the title indicates, for the pizza and beer they feast on after the games and practices. 
A perpetual third-stringer in the NFL, Dockery finds his niche in Italy. In Italy he is a major player in a minor sport. Reek, as the Italians call him, becomes a hero for his teammates. Like most of Grisham's characters, he has his weak­nesses. He blows a game after drinking too much, he womanizes and he's arro­gant. In spite of these flaws, we still cheer for Dockery when he completes a pass and when he delivers a blow to the Cleveland Post's cruel sports columnist. 
But Dockery isn't battling for justice or defending Parma from corruption. He's just playing football. If "Playing for Pizza" had been written by someone other than Grisham, readers could close the book, satisfied after a good story. But from Grisham, what's expected is suspense, more suspense than a football game in Italy could provide.

NEW YORK-Roger Clemens was removed from the New York Yankees' division series roster Monday, replaced by left-handed reliever Hon Villone. 
Clemens suffered an injured left hamstring Sunday in New York's 8-4 victory over Cleveland. The Yankees were elimi­nated, 6-4, Monday night. 
He met with manager Joe Torre and general manager Brian Cashman after the game. 
Under the new rule, Clemens would have been ineligible for the American League Championship Series if 
IN BRIEF 
Panthers quarterback out 
for the season . 
CHARLOTTE, N.C Jake Delhomme last week called surgery on his strained right elbow "a last resort." 
After experiencing pain trying to throw on Monday, the Carolina Panthers quarterback decided the worst-case scenario couldn't be avoided. 
Delhomme will have season-ending ligament-replacement surgery on his elbow next week, leaving the Panthers without their leader on offense and scrambling to find another quarterback. 
"Anytime you lose your starting quarterback it's a blow," coach John Fox said. 
Originally injured two weeks ago, Delhomme didn't show any improve­ment when trying to throw Monday. A day earlier he threw briefly on the side while sitting out Carolina's win over the Saints. 

the Yankees had advanced. The Rocket would have been able to return if New York had reached the World Series. 
"Normally, he'd fight," Cashman said. "But he didn't fight this one. He knows his body and he knows that he did enough damage in there that he wouldn't be ready." 
New York petitioned Major League Baseball for the roster switch Monday morning and it was granted hours later. Clemens declined com­ment through team spokesman Jason Zillo before the start of Game 
4. 

"He had some time try­ing to deal with his ham­
Toronto's Blake has treat­
able form of leukemia 
TOHONTO -Maple Leafs forward Jason Blake has a rare form of leukemia that he says is highly treatable. 
The 34-year-old player said Monday he has begun treatment and will still be able to perform at a high level. He announced his condi­tion after talking to teammates at practice. He said he has started tak­ing a pill daily that "has proven to be very effective in controlling this cancer." 
"The prognosis, and certainly the expectations of my physician, myself and my family, is that I will live a long, full and normal life," he said in a statement on the team's Web site. 
Team doctor Noah Forman said the disease -chronic myelogenous leukemia -is a slow-growing can­cer of the white blood cells. About 500 new cases are diagnosed each year in Canada. 
string, and he had a cou­ple of different instances last night in the first cou­ple of innings that he felt it," Torre said. "So the fact that he won't be eligi­ble for the championship series probably makes sense." 
Villone said Torre and pitching coach Ron Guidry gave him the news after he arrived at Yankee Stadium on Monday. New York did not have a lefty in the bullpen until it added Villone to its play­off roster. 
"If I can do anything to help us, that's what I'm here for," said Villone, who had no record and a

Marion Jones relinquishes
gold medals 
Marion Jones has given up the five medals she won at the Sydney Olympics, days after admitting she used performance-enhancing drugs. 
It wasn't immediately clear where the medals are now. Jones' lawyer, Henry DePippo, said Monday that she had relinquished them, but declined to say who had possession of them. The normal protocol would be for Jones to give them to the U.S. Olympic Committee, which then would return them to the International Olympic Committee, said Giselle Davies, IOC spokes­woman. 
"The IOC wants to move forward as quickly as possible in getting the facts and sorting out all the issues from the BALCO case," Davies said. 
A call to the USOC was not imme­diately returned, but the group has scheduled a 7 p.m. EDT news con­ference. 
but you've got to prepare just like every other game." 
Clemens' left hamstring started bothering him again when he broke for Kenny Lofton's bunt attempt in the second inning. 
He told a Yankees train­er about the problem after the inning. 
The seven-time Cy Young Award winner walked Travis Hafner leading off the third and struck out Victor Martinez before he was replaced by Phil Hughes. 
Clemens got an encour­aging pat on the chest from Alex Rodriguez before trudging toward the dugout.

NEW YOHK -Once Grady Simmorn hit a loadolr home run, the Clovoland Indians were head­nd to the AL championship series whilo tho New York Yankees were hracod for a showdown with thoir boss. 
Paul Byrd and the Indians bullpon elos1)d out New York 6-4 in (;anw 4 Monday night, com­pleting the third straight first­round dobadc for tho Yankees, one that might cost manager Joe Torrn his job. 
"This team hasn't had a cham­pionship in Clevoland for a long time," said Kenny Lorton. the Indians' veteran leadnr. "This is just an unbelievable feeling to be able just to start this process again." 
The Yankees came in streak­ing, ovnrcoming a 21-29 start to win tho AL wild card. But they worn done in by poor pitching, an insect invasion and the latest October vanishing act by Alex Hodriguez, whose bat was quint until a solo homo run in the sev­nnth inning. 
The posky Indians, who wasted a three-run lead in Game 3, chased Chien-Ming Wang in the second and burst ahead 4-0. Byrd kept wiggling out of trouble, and Victor Martinez's two-run single made it 6-1 in the fourth against reliever Mikn Mussina. 
A day after averting a sweep, New York put runners on in every inning except the eighth. But when it eounted, its high­octane offense fell flat once again, with late solo homers by Hod riguez, Hobinson Cano and Bobby Abrnu not enough. 
"I got some big oul'> with guys on basn," said Byrd. who strand­ed two runners in tho first and thrnn in the second. 
Cleveland moves on to its lirst ALCS since 1998, opening Friday night at Boston. The Indians were only 2-5 against the Red Sox this season. but will have aces C.C. Sabathia and Fausto Carmona fully rested for Fenway Park. 



The Indians, 0-6 against the Yankees during the regular sea­son, are seeking their first World Series title since 1948. The NL championship series starts Thursday night with Colorado at Arizona. 
Bnwildered New York opens yet another offseason of turmoil, another October over nearly as ~oon as it began. All eyes will be on owner George Steinbrenner, who said over the weekend that he didn't think he'd keep Torre as manager if New York bowed with another early exit. While the Indians celebrated in the infield, A-Hod stood alongside team­mates, one leg on the top step of the dugout, the other a step bnlow. 
Steinbrenner, looking grim, didn't speak as he left the ball­park. 
"llopefully there will be some reconsideration, but the Boss does what he wants," Johnny Damon said. 
Torre managed the Yankees to four World Series titles in his first live years and reached the play­oils in all 12 of his seasons. Yet, that might not be enough for Steinbrenner, impatient his team of multimillionaires has lost 13 of its last 17 postseason games and gone seven years in a row with no championship. If Torre does depart, Don Mattingly and Joe Girardi are the leading candi­dates to replace him. 
"This has been a great 12 years. Whatever the hell happens from here on out, I'll look back on these 12 years with great, great pleasure," he said. "The 12 years just felt like they were 10 minutes long, to be honest with you." 
Fans chanted Torre's name

onto a 20-yard pass to the Buffalo 25; officials needed a replay review_ to overturn the original call. 
Romo completed two more passes and Folk, after having his first try from 53 yards negated by a Bills timeout, won it. 
Folk also made field goals of 47, 29 and 37 yards. Buffalo built its lead on huge plays. 
Wilson spent most of last season on the practice squad before being converted to safety this year. He started in the injury-depleted secondary and his first NFL touch came when Romo badly overthrew Witten from the end zone. Wilson scooted in untouched for a 25-yard score. 
And when Romo went for Witten on his next pass attempt, Angelo Crowell inter­cepted. 
picked off at the 
Dallas 43. The four first-half picks were one more than the total that Romo had thrown in the previous four games. 
The Bills didn't capitalize, with Lindell missing a 54­yard field goal with 36 sec­onds to go in the half. That was enough time for the good Romo to emerge, and a 22­yard pass to Hurd set up Folk's 47-yarder to close the half at 17-10. 
Folk made a 29-yarder on the first drive of the third quarter, but McGee got his fifth career kickoff return TD, bursting untouched down the middle of the field. 
But just like in the early 1990s, when the great Bills teams that made four straight Super Bowls twice lost to Dallas in the title game, this one also would go the Cowboys' way.

 comfortable with the game, the tempo or the offense and my position as a whole." For months, people around Indianapolis worried about the baekup to feature back Joseph Addai. Critics and online message boards con­stantly asked: Who is Kenton Keith, and why would the Colts go into the season with someone so untested? Keith heard everything, and Sunday he quieted all those doubts. Like unknown Colts running baeks before him, most notably James Mungro and Dominie Rhodes, Keith had an emphatic answer in his first career start. He ran 28 times for 121 yards and two toueh­downs, caught five passes for 37 yards and, perhaps most important, proteeted Super Bowl MVP Peyton Manning in passing situations. Nobody seemed to notiee that Addai was out with a bruised shoulder. 
''I'm more proud of me being in there and keeping my wind," said Keith, who never had more than 17 ear­ries in a pro game till Sunday. "''d not really had a chance to go more than six or seven plays in a row in a game

Unlike his eousins and dad, though, Keith wound up going at New Mexieo State where he 
rushed for 2,134 yards in 39 career games and dropped orr the radar of most NFL teams.

"At the time, I didn't know what a training camp body was," Keith said. "When I left, I knew what it was. They did­n't really need me." 
One game changed every­
thing. Some contend thn Colts (5­
0) could put almost anyone in the baeklield and have a 100­yard rushnr, and there is a hint of truth to that. Mungro, primarily a short-yardage back during his five seasons with the Colts, ran for 114 yards and a touchdown in his starting debut against Philadelphia in 2002 and Hhodes ran for more 1,104 yards in 10 games -an NFL record for undrafted rookies -in 2001. 
Yet the Colts insist there's more to playing the position than impressive slats. 
"Most of the baeks that come into this league can run," Dungy said. "It's the other things where experi­ence comes into play, things like pass protection, audibles and route-running. We weren't really on the lookout for an experienced guy once we saw the guys in the pre­season. We felt they'd bP. fine." 
Now Keith is the toast of his native Omaha, Neb., and Indianapolis. 
He had 87 missed calls by the time he made it back to 
the loeker room Sunday, and heard tales of Omaha hangouts being l'illed with old fans watching the Colts game. 
But the 27­year-old isn't overwhelmed by his new fame. 
"I think peo­
ple are expeeting me to be overjoyed or whatever word you want to use," Keith said. "I just did what I've been doing. 
"I don't know what they'll do right now. I'm pretty sure if they go with me or with me and Joe, yesterday gave them the confidenee I can do it."

Belles top the field in 21 squad event 
Megan Gray wins individual title as team deals with heat 
By MATT GAMBER 
Sports Writer . 
Going into Friday's Eagle Invitational at Benedictine University in Lisle, Ill., Saint Mary's was just hoping to gauge how well it was pre­pared for a longer, six kilome­ter race. 
Coming out, the Belles have to be ecstatic after finishing first among the meet's 21 teams. Senior captain Megan Gray also claimed the individ­ual title by finishing in 23:59.2 in 8 7 -degree heat. 
"The girls were just amaz­ing," coach Jackie Bauters said. "Despite the heat, they ran very well. This is the toughest course !Benedictine's coach Jon Wolcott] has ever made for the invite, with two

"The girls responded pretty well [to both the heat and the course length]," Bauters said. "It was hard to tell if the slow­er times were the heat, the course or the longer race, but I'm thinking they can handle the race length adjustment."

Welsh Family 32, Badin 0 
l'erfeetion is the only way to 

doseribe Wnlsh Family. 
In thnir route over Badin 

Sunday, the Whirlwinds played a 
flawless game on both sides of 
tho ball. This win did not only 
solidify an undefeated 6-0 
rneord for the season, it also 
gave thn Welsh Family women 
the No. 1 seed in tho (;old 
League playolls. 
On offense, junior captain 
.lenni Cargula throw ew~ry pass 
right into her receivers' hands 
and deftly kept the ball away 
from the Bullfrog defenders. 
Welsh Family never punted and 
scored a touchdown on every 
possf1ssion. The receivers 
workP.d eflkif~ntly, running the 
routes perfectly and then turn­
ing down lield. 
On defense, Welsh Family did­
n't give Badin a chance to move 
the ball. Badin had only two first 
downs the whole game -both 
in the second half. The 
Whirlwinds played shutdown 
pass defense and managed to 
break up many Bullfrog passes. 
Welsh Family was too big and 
too quick for the entire Badin 
team. 
"The defense takes a lot of 
pressure ofT of me because you 
know that the team isn't going 
to scorn much," Gargula said. 
Gargula said the team-first spirit and the coaching quality was the difl'erence maker for the team. 
"Our coaches spend so much time with the team and give us so many different options with the oll'ense," Gargula said. 
"We will rnally be only work­ing on the same things as always," Gargula said. "OITnnsive plays, defense, the same things basically." 
The loss took Badin out of the Cold League playoll's. 
Cavanaugh 6, Farley 0 
Cavanaugh held on for a difli­cult win over Farley Sunday.

Farley's coach. Matt Barcus,

"We played really well, espe­
cially the defense," Barcus said. 
"Dropped passes hurt. They 
wero the missing pieces. We had 
lintr in a row at one point." 
Pasquerilla West 25, Lyons 7 
As his offense ran out on the 
field Sunday, Pasquerilla West 
eoach Paul Wallenberg shouted 
one last bit of instruction: "Score 
early and score oftnn." 
It was with this mantra in 
mind that the Purple Weasels 
beat Lyons at Hiehle Field. 
Al'tPr punting on its first drive, 
l'asquerilla West got the ball 
back on a turnover on downs 
and did exactly what its coach 
instructed. Aftnr six plays cover­
ing 27 yards, freshman quarter­
back Grace Orians ran five 
yards for the 11rst score of tho 
game. 
The second half went much thn same way for the Weasels, as their captain, senior wide reeeiver and running back Tina Martinek scored two more touchdowns. one on a pass from Orians and the other on a two­yard run. 
Martinek said this was all part of the plan. 
"!Scoring early! had always lwen one of our game plans," she said. "It's ... nice to get up early and put it away and not have to worry about it at the end of the game. It f{1it good to be up by that much. Obviously it makes the rest of the game easi­
er." 
At the half, Lyons captain and snnior middle linebacker Judith Kaczmarek said the defense drew inspiration from a recent Notre Dame triumph. 
"We were trying to compare ourselves to the Notre Dame defense. We said that if Maurice Crurn, Jr. could make some interceptions and the defense could help win a game when the offense was having trouble, wo thought we could, too," Kaczmarek said. 
Lyons started the second half on the offensive side of the ball. The Lions finally got on the scoreboard with a 65-yard drive, capped by a 20-yard pass from sophomore quarterback Claire Connell to junior receiver Shannon Brady. 
The biggest play of the drive, 
yet settled, connected with soph­
omore receiver Maria Petnuch. 
"[That drivel turned our entire 
mood around," Kaczmarek said. 
"We were really quiet. It just 
brought a spark of hope into the 
second half. It didn't come 
through in the end, but we 
played a much stronger offense 
in the second half but we just 
couldn't get into the end zone." 
Lyons would not score again. 
The Pasquerilla West defense 
held the Lions scoreless for the 
remainder of the half, and 
Martinek added to her impres­
sive stat line by taking an inter­
ception back for a touchdown on 
the last play of the game. 
With the win, the Purple 
Weasels return to the playofl's, a 
goal Martinek said the team had 
in mind all along. 
"1 can speak for the seniors; we're all glad just to be play­ing," she said. " ... All season, [from I before the first game, we've told the freshmen [that! we've been really successful the last few years and we're looking to tho Stadium ... and I think we have a good shot of getting there and winning when we do." 
Walsh 12, McGlinn 12 
McGlinn only had eight play­ers Sunday -but that's all it needed. 
The Shamrocks entered their game with Walsh at 0-3, while the Wild Women were 4-0, but McGlinn managed a hard-fought tie. 
The Wild Women were with­out starting quarterback Mary Claire Sullivan, leaving fresh­man Lindsay Schanzer as the signal-caller. She threw four interceptions but ran for a 25­yard touchdown on an option right. 
"It was really great to see Lindsay step up as a freshman and lead the team. She deserves a lot of credit for going out there," Walsh offensive coordi­nator Miehael Wakim said. "She had some big shoes to fill, and I know she is going to be great in the future." 
The offense started ofT playing conservatively, sticking with short passes or the option, but expanded the playbook in the second half. Schanzer's touch­down gave Walsh an early 6-0 lead, but the Wild Women sur­rendered a touchdown pass late in the second half. The Shamrocks, however, failed to convert the one-point conver­pass and ran it back for a touch­down to put the Wild Women up 12-6. 

"We put a lot of pressure on our defense with the amount of offensive turnovers. Julie 
· Campbell comes up big for us every game," Wakim said. "She's the best cover corner in the league and the anchor of our defense. She plays with the heart of a champion and has a real nose for the ball." 
Wakim decided to go for the two-point conversion instead of' the easier one-pointer. Schanzer's overthrew a pass intended fm· wide receiver Siera Smith, leaving the Walsh lead at only six points. 
"I take full responsibility for the way we went out there today; there were mistakes on my part that led to the overall outcome of' the game," Wakim said. "Overall. this game gives us a chance to refocus and work even harder at practices to attain perfection." 
McGlinn drove down the lield with a combination of screens and long passes and evened the score on a long touchdown pass. The Shamroeks failed the con­version, leaving the limtl score at12-12. 
"As a team we were disap­pointed by a tie because we were undefeated, but it was an eye-opening experience," Walsh senior captain Marie Brenner said. "Now we know areas we can improve upon going into the playoffs." 
Pangborn 13, lewis 6 
From the opening whistle, it was all about No. 10. 
Pangborn's sophomore cap­tain, Meghan Bescher, who wears the number, took over on both sides of the ball as the Phoxes beat Lewis 13-6 Sunday at Riehle Field. 
Bescher began the game with a bang, intercepting a pass from Lewis sophomore quarterback Catherine Guarnieri on the Chicks' opening drive. On fourth-and-goal of Pangborn's drive, Bescher caught a six-yard touchdown pass from freshman quarterback Gabby Tate. She then scored the extra point, giv­ing Pangborn a quick 7-0 lead. 
Tate and Bescher hooked up for another score on the last play of the first half, this time on a 13-yard pass. After a failed extra point attempt, the half ended with Pangborn leading some eneouraging words lix his 
team in the huddle. 

"I just told tht~m that our 
defense was hanging tough. to 
keep it up, and that we could 
easily score on our own," he 
said. "I told them that they 
weren't out of the game by any 
stretch." 

The Chicks' defonse heeded its 
coach's advice; Pangborn's first 
drive of the second half was cut 
short after junior Sarah Trent 
intereopted a Tato pass. The 
subsequent drivo resultnd in a 
touchdown on a nine-yard 
scamper by Guarnitwi, bringing 
the score to 13-(>. 

Shoemaker and the rest of tlw 
team were happy to get on the 
board so quickly in the seeon9 
half. 
"It was good to sen, 

Shonmaker said. "We didn't . make any major changes; we just fine-tuned some of the routes to try to gd opnn. Getting the touchdown just conl1rrned 
that our scheme could work." 

The Chicks defense eame out 
strongnr in the st~cond half, 
holding the Phoxes scoreless 
and putting much more pres­
sure on Tate. The pressure was 
due in large part to senior cap­
tain Alnx Perslny, who recorded 
three sacks on thn defensive 
line. 

While Pangborn's season will 
continue in the playoffs, the 
Chicks played their last game 
Sunday. Despite the ending, 
Shoemaker was happy with his 
team's ell'ort this season. 

"This wasn't the 0-6 Lewis 
team from last year -this was 
the start of something great," 
Shoemaker said. "Our defense 
was outstanding all the way 
through, and our young ollense 
really eame together toward the 
end of the season." 

Beseher finished the game 
with eight catehes for 71 yards 
and two touchdowns on offense 
and two interceptions on 
defense. This efTort, though, was 
nothing spectacular in her mind. 
"There was obviously a little 
more weight on this last game, 
seeing as a win would ensure a 
playoff spot, but I played the 
same way I always do," she said.

"[The defense] can set up the offense with short field and then we just have to go out and execute," Hogue said. 
Abeling finished the game with 12-of-21 for 147 yards. His No. 1 receiver, freshman Dan Crisman, caught seven balls for 95 yards in the game. St. Ed's looks to remain unbeaten as it takes on Siegfried next Sunday. Knott will face undefeated Fisher. 
Keenan 26, Alumni 0 
Keenan dominated Alumni from the opening play of Sunday's win, and with their third win of the season, the Knights clinched a playoff berth in the Gold League. 
On the first play of the game, Keenan intercepted an Alumni screen pass. On the ensuing possession, freshman quarter­back Brian Castello threw a touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Jim Zenker for the first of their three touchdown connections on the day. Keenan's two-point conversion attempt failed, leaving the score at 6-0. 
attempt, and the teams went into halftime with the score tied at six. 
In the third quarter, Dillon capitalized on a Keough mishap to take the lead. After Keough forced a Dillon punt, the punt was muffed, and jun­ior Luke Jarzynka recovered the muff for Dillon. Soon after the Keough miscue, Dillon took the lead on a touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Garigliano to Cugliari. Dillon's second failed two-point con­version made the score 12-6. 
Dillon's stout defense pre­served the win for the Big Red in the fourth quarter. Keough ran the ball well and found themselves with a first and goal late with just a few min­utes remaining in the game. 
Ho~ever, Dillon stopped four straight run plays from Keough, and after a long run from Garigliano on its ensuing possession, the Big Red ran out the clock to pick up their first win of the season.

This weekend, the Bulldogs beat conference opponent Olivet 1-0 -a week al'ter the Belles played the Comets to a double-overtime, scoreless draw -but lost to fellow con­fenmce foe Hope 3-0. 
The Belles earned a draw with the Bulldogs last season. 
"They are usually quite physi­cal so we need to be prepared to match or exceed that aspect of their play," Saint Mary's coach Caryn MacKenzie said of Adrian. "They have one for­ward, Lindsey Chitwood, who is quite skillful so defensively WP. will need to key on her." 
Chitwood has scored 10 of 

Adrian's 15 goals this season, on only 21 shots on goal. i\s a team, the Bolles have seorP.d 13 goals this season. 
Saint Mary's has had to over­come many ehallenges, with returning players suffering injuries and the incorporation of freshmen into an improving lineup.
