,, F 
ree Speech '' Hampers Peace Corps Recruits 
By WALTER GRANT 

WASHINGTON (CPS)-When Vice President Hubert Humphrey visited Africa early this year, a group of Peace Corps volun­teers in Liberia wanted to meet with him to discuss their senti­ments against the war in Vietnam. 
The volunteers were told by a top · Peace Corps official in Liberia that any comment by them-either public or private­on Vietnam in the presence of the Vice President would result in their immediate termination from the Peace Corps. 
Their story, made public by a letter to the editor in a recent issue of the New Republic, is one example of why many stu­dents today are hesitating to become part of a program which for the past seven years has drawn strong support from the younger generation. 
Within the last nine months, the Peace Corps has become a topic of controversy on many college campuses. Most of the Corps' problems have been a direct result of the war in Viet-

Irish on Winning Trail 
BY TERRY O'NEIL 
It was one of those perfect nights they write folk tales about. You know, Beowulf against the monster, David against Goliath, good guys against the bad guys. 
On second thought, it was more like Frank McMerriwell in the Notre Dame Fieldhouse with a couple thousand O'Tooles, Donovans and Fitz­patricks tearing the joint down around him. 
It was one of ·those nights that makes you sorry the new Convocation Center is nearly ready for play. . _ 
It was a night when the (rish basketball team 
downed DePaul 91-85 in overtime after the ND frosh had buried the Little Demons 104-86. The decisions set the varsity record at 14-6 while the frosh are 2-1. 
It was a critical battle for Coach Johnny Dee's team, coming off a three-game losing streak. A victory by the Demons would have placed ND no better than fourth among Midwest independents 
(behind Marquette, DePaul, and Loyola) and e­liminated any chance of an NCAA tourney bid. 
The issue was in grav~ doubt all the way, es­pecially at 4:50 to play when center Bob Whit­more fouled out with his mates ahead 68-65. The Irish increased it to 75-68 with two minutes to go, but missed five straight one-and-one free
 
throws, permitting DePaul to run off seven straight points and deadlock the game 75-75 at the bu77P.r. 
In the extra period, you might know three Irishmen, Mike O'Connell, Dwight Murphy and Jim McKirchy, paced the win with 1 0 of Notre Dame's 16 points. It was typically Notre Dame that way all night. 
There was the howling capacity crowd, stu­dents virtually sitting on each other, checking out the St. Mary·s foxes, unfurling double sheet banners with slogans not fit to print. There was the ROTC color guard, so far out of step they were almost in. There were the usual number of paper wads and resulting speech by the skin­head referee---"Next time a paper comes onto the court, Notre Dame will be accessed a techinical foul." 
There was the infirmary nurse, whose had that same seat on the top row for the last 20 years. There was the standard amount of applause for DePaul's cheerleaders while we were winning 
handily and the average amount of boos for their

excellent cartwheels when the game got tight. 
All the things that make the Fieldhouse so rich in tradition were there. And the freshmen were picking them up, too, plus adding a few touches of their own. 
There was Ausin Carr, playing with his shirt . tail out as if it were just a game of alley ball. Of course that's all it really was to him. He rammed in 42 points and probably had much tougher games on the playgrounds of Washington, D.C. 
There was Tom Sinnott, throwing behind-H back bounce passes and diving into the second row after loose balls like he was still back in Jersey. And little Jackie Meehan, imagining it was the Philadelphia Palestra, passing like Wally and tipping in like Wilt. 
There was Jim Hinga, grunting with every move, and Collis Jones, looking like Whit~s No. 1 protege, And then there was Sid Catlett looking dapper as ever in a white turtle neck, double breasted navy blazer, gray glen plaid slacks and blue velvet hat. 
Next year, they'll all be gone from the Fieldhouse and playing under the Silver Dome. If that stirs your emotions, remember, lot's of hard-bitten New Yorkers cried when the Symph­ony left The Met for Lincoln Center.

Implications 

The tight rationale behind the success of the Senior Cars pro­posal, that "Seniors should not have to decide their futures in the back of a bus," succeeded in spite of itself. Seniors, it was pointed out, are busy people with many responsibilities which cannot be fulfilled without a car. They must travel hundreds of weary miles for job interviews, marriage applications, not to mention draft phy­sicals and consultations with the local board. For all of these needs the Senior Bar would not suffice. The aver­age Senior, if he is to get a firm hold on his rosy future, simply must, must, must have a car. A car, it's been shown, provides the intimacy necessary for the success of every senior's future decisions. The argument stunned many, setting rows of philosophers on their ears and prompting some to abandon entire world views. Our world, a tenuous one at best, is held together, not with bubble gum or high ideals, but with a dependable four wheels. The chains ot super-highways are for real; there are no weak links, South Bend notwithstanding. Henry Ford, that sage old philanthropist, went unheard when he said with a wry chuckle, "Give 'em any future they want as long as It'S black... He had tound the key to the phenomenon of decision and no one understood his perception. (Scholars are still undecided about Marie Antoinette's "Let them eat high octane.") Now decisions are a dime a dozen, literally as common as a two­car garage, and enterprising dealers are investigating a sales campaign based on the trend. Research has been completed along the lines of: after one decision, whether a proposal for marriage or whether it will rain, the average car is worn out. 
By GUY DeSAPIO The Hall Presidents of the North Quad met last night and 
disclosed that a compromise a­greement had been reached with Dean of Students Rev. James 
Riehle C.S.C. which would nul­lify proposed hall restitution fines levied because of the January 19th Food Riot. 
Speaking at a meeting in Breen-Philips hall, Zahm Hall President John Saville, informed the group that he and three other student leaders had met with Father Riehle early yes­terday morning to reach the compromise. 
Saville said "Fr. Riehle was willing to forget about the fine, about the whole issue, if we give him an apology." 
The cancellation of the fines relies upon the hal.ls issuing a public apology for the riots. Saville said Riehle "apologized to us, and the least he wants is an apology from us." 
The apology is to be based on the principles Saville stated, "That we, as students, feel that the action was irresponsible." 
Steve Ahern, Stanford Hall 
Ford leads the rest with slogans of: "A quieter decision than in a ..-------------. 
Rolls Royce," although Volkswagen is expected to score with the "automatic stick-shift decision." Most decisions will still have body by Fisher and can be made to a variety of tape cartridges. The new 
Cadillacs will have an "illogical warning light" as standard equip­ment. 
Ideas on the drawing boards are air-conditioned decisions, a de­cision tachometer, and a variety of instruments which snap into the driver's brain. The Federal Government, as always, is expected to embroil the thinking process in miles of red tape with mandatory "decision seat belts." 
But even with that encumbrance, the ease with which modern decisions can be made still staggers the imagination. Consideration of the pre-Smog Age can drive any behaviorist into a wild slobber. Would, could, Eve have eaten the apple if she had fondled it in the back of so much as a Nash? Or what about modern Europe if Napa­lean could have retreated in a sharp little MG? 
Left-wing Steam Engine Philosophers have already begun tore­write history with the car linked, as it should be, to every major decision. Christ, it turns out, sweat blood in a niftv little two-door 
Gethsemane. Pontius Pilate washed his hands in the overflow from a radiator. George Washington crossed the Delaware in an air-tight Renault, an up to now unappreciated French contribution to the American Revolution. 
Characteristically, Notre Dame has entered the real world far be­hind the students at other schools. Fortunately, cool, calm heads are now in the driver's seat.
