SMC students upset over housing changes; petition Duggan today 
By LAUREEN WOLFE and THERESA GUARINO 
News Staff 
When hundreds of Saint Mary's women pick their rooms for 1984­85 this week. they will be forced to work around approximately 100 rooms which have been blocked off for freshmen. 
The class integration system, formulated a few years ago, has sparked controversy among next year's returning students. Room selection will be different from pre­vious years· selections because 26 rooms in LeMans, 33 rooms in Holy 
Cross and 58 rooms in McCandless Halls have been reserved for next year's freshmen class. 
Meanwhile. 163 rooms have been reserved for upperclassmen in Regina Hall, traditionally the fresh­man dorm. 
The Sophomore Class Council has formulated a petition which will be givt·n to John Duggan, College presi­dent, at an open meeting today at 4 
p.m. in LeMans lobby. The petition, written by sophomore Kristi Stathis, states. "we ...feel there was inade­quate opportunity for student input in the decision-making process. Fur­thermore .. .is is unfair to all classes that the specific effects of the housing changes were never an­nounced." 
This year's freshmen and sopho­mores are the classes most affected by room changes. Many freshmen face living in Regina again next year, while next year's juniors are finding Holy Cross and LeMans, their tradi­tional "territory" harder to come by. A bad lottery number could send a junior or senior to McCandless. 
The petition, approximately ten pages long, will be given to Duggan by the sophomore class officers and a group of students who had also made an appointment with him. The officers had requested a meeting with Duggan at "the first possible opportunity" on Friday and were given an appointment at tomorrow at 4 p.m. Later, another group of 
sophomores also asked for an ap­pointment and were given today at 4 
p.m. Class officers decided to combine the two groups. and invited all sophomores to gather in the LeMans lobby today. 
Next year's seniors will not be as affected by housing changes be­cause they pick rooms before any other cla~s. However, many tradi­tionally senior rooms are also blocked offfor freshmen and sopho­mores. Kari Casey, a junior, said, "It (the blocking off) bugs me be­cause they are blocking off such good rooms." Hoping for a double in LeMans, Michele Melnick claimed, "'Our class wasn't supposed to be af­fected and it seems that the rooms we would have picked were blocked off. We should have been able to pick our rooms first." 
Residence Life Commissioner Pat Rissmeyer feels she has tried her best to integrate the students evenly in the dorms. Rissmeyer said the RAs discussed the issue with their sec­tions. Each hall director then worked with Rissmeyer to select the freshmen rooms that would least likely be chosen by upperclassmen. 
The change in room selection has not upset all juniors. After viewing the designated doubles, Kathleen Hennessy said, "It doesn't affect me because there are nicer doubles available that have not been blocked off for freshmen." Commenting on the entire integration system,Joanie Giblin stated,"I'm not really opposed to it. Integration is impor­tant, but some freshmen may not be able to handle it." 
However, many students aren't taking the changes quite so well. Sophomore Ann Murphy, said. "because of these changes, I may end up living in M:Candless as a junior, when I had always expected to live in the dorm of my choice as an upperclassman." 
Sophomore officers are hoping that Duggan will reconsider his posi­tion. But, many students aren't expecting a change in housing · policy at this late date.

Shortage of RA applicants at SMC forces resumption of interviews 
By LYNN CROWELL 
News Staff 
Although the selection of Saint Mary's 1984-85 resident assistants was made last Friday, there are still two positions open in McCandless and LeMans. The number of R.A. ap­plicants was markedly decreased this year in comparison to previous years. 
Out ofthe 50 R.A.s needed at Saint Mary's next year, only 48 have been chosen. Applications have been re­opened to fill the remaining posi­tions. "We'd like to have those places f t illed by the fifth or sixth of March. The first spring training ses­sion is on March lOth, and we'd like all of next year's R.A.s to be there," said Lisa Schulte, Holy Cross hall director. "Anyone of sophomore or junior class standing can still apply." 

Reagan's ex-campaign manager criticizes current primary system 

By MARY HEALY 
Assistant News Editor 
The United States' current system ofconducting presidential primaries is "very bad" because it puts too much power in the hands of the press, accord­ing to Ronald Reagan's former campaign manager John Sears. 
In a Mock Convention-sponsored lecture Satur­
day. "Nominating a President: 1980's Style," Sears 
explained how the primary system has changed 
over the years, taking power out of the hands of 
party leaders and giving it to the media. 
Formerly. Sears said, "nominations were the privileged matter of party leaders." and the issue wasn't decided until after balloting took place. In 1968, because of a fear of the power of party bosses, a broader system was devised where people could vote for nominees. But many people are unfamiliar with the candidates, and to find out about them, Sears said, "obviously people must look somewhere, and the most obvious place is the media . . . . Now where is the power? It is the combined radio, television and newsprint press." 

The problem, said Sears, is that media "happens to give advice without meaning to." Sears said, "I think this is a very bad thing, not because the press has this power but because they don't want the responsibility for it." 
The press limits the field early in an election by playing up the front line candidates and ignoring others, according to Sears. Referring to the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. he said, "the first few events give irresistible momentum leading to a winner." Now that the Iowa caucuses have been moved closer to the others, Sears said "If you lose Iowa, you can't recover." People are told who is ahead every day by the media, until the others lose most of the support they had. Sears 
believes, "Ifyou wanted to cut down the influence 
of the media, the best thing is to eliminate half of 
the primaries." 
Another problem with the primary system, said 
Sears, is most people don't bother to participate, 
and in the absence of a broad middle influence, 

see SEARS page 4 
Present RA.s are also being asked to encourage those they think would be good candidates. "That's really unusual", said Molly Baker, an R.A. in McCandless. "I don't think we've ever been told to seek out can­didates before." 
Neither Schulte nor Baker knew why applications were down this year. "We're taking a random survey during room picks to see what the students think," said Schulte, who speculated the time that applica­tions were taken -from as early as Nov. 16th to just before Christmas break -"may have been too early for students to decide ifthey wanted to be an R.A. for next year or not." 
The selection of R.A.s will be as usual. Candidates will fill out an ap­plication, write an essay, provide three letters of recommendation, and go through two interviews. The interviews are held by a resident director and four present resident assistants. 
"We're looking for someone who has the time, creativity, enthusiasm, ability to work with people, and the ability to communicate. Com­munication is very important," Schulte remarked. Added Baker, "What we look for most is a serious interest and enthusiasm. You can tell right away ifthey knciw what they're getting into." 
After each interview, the resident director and assistants evaluate each applicant, rank them, and put the evaluation with the recommenda­tions back into a file. "The hall direc­tors look at the files. and place the candidates as to their needs, strengths, and the needs of the par­
ticular halls," said Schulte. "We ask them to list their top two choices of halls, and they're usually placed in one of their choices. If they want to be with upper classmen, however. and their strength lies in working with freshmen, they will probably be placed with freshmen." 


New camera system watches library lounge 
By SHEILA KANEHANN 
News Staff 

It's 1984 and "Big Sister" has crept her way into the Cushwa-Leighton Library. A new surveillance camera system is now in operation in the after-hours study lounge in the base­ment ofthe library. 
The system, installed by Electronic Service Company of South Bend, uses two small cameras at ceiling level. Prior to their installa­tion, the lounge was patrolled by security to insure that furniture is kept intact, and a quiet atmosphere is maintained for studying. The two cameras in operation do the same fob by using monitors located in the security hut, which are watched by security personnel. Sr. Bernice Hol­lenhorst, director at Cushwa -Leighton insists "security is the main reason" for the new system which allows for better surveillance of students using the lounge. According to Bob Foldesi. director of Personnel, "the mechanical devices provide better, more eftl­cient security." 
At times during the semester the after-hours lounge is used by many students, and at other times it is empty. Often. before the installation of the new system. a security officer would be on duty in the lounge with no students there. The new system. according to Foldesi,"will not be a profit the first year. Money is not a big factor. but the security of the women using the after-hours lounge 
is." 
The opinion expressed by most stu-. dents seems to be that the cameras go unnoticed and they are less aware of them than of the security person­nel.

Rumors have not run so rampant on the Notre Dame campus since talk of admitting women to the Univer­sity. Now heresay has it that ND is going dry -at least for those under 21. 
One does not down a bottle ofcough sytup to relieve a fever -any old wife could tell you that. In the same manner, a university does not prohibit all under-21­year-olds from drinking to solve a so called raging drink­ing problem. The "problem" will continue, and possibly 
worsen. 
Because no official policy has been released to the students, one can only speculate as to the changes such a policy would demand. Students may have to go even further underground than their hall's basement party room ifthey wish to hold a traditional ND social gather­ing. Happy hours could adopt an melancholy ai r. The only tailgaters on Green Field might be hosted by men in green plaid pants, waving pennants. 
But chances arc, students will still drink in their rooms. If they have to put locks on their refrigerators or hide bottles in dresser drawers, a 21-campus policy will probably not inhibit a large majority of the stu­dents under 21 years old. 
At this point, one of the best reasons a student can determine for a han on al­cohol for those under 21, is to curb the epidemic drink­ing problem on campus along with the destructive­ness that invariably accom­panies such a problem. It is responsible and admirable of the administration to want to help those students who have a "drinking problem" and those affected by their destructiveness. But answer. 
The person to worry about is not the one, in a social atmosphere, among many people (a percentage of whom are not inebriated) who perchance has too much to drink. Rather it is the one who returns to his ..or her room to "do some shots." It is that person who is more likely suffering from alcoholism. or a less definable drinking problem. He or she is of more danger to him­selfand others and property. 
If rumor becomes policy, this minority of students will blend in with all of the students who still want to enjoy a drink now and then, but cannot do so in public at an on-campus party or happy hour. How can RAs or rectors then differentiate between the social drinker, forced into his room, and the real "problem students" who the lhiversity is trying to cure in the first place? Without personal relationships with every member of the section or dorm, this is virtually impossible.

... 
Perhaps the administration has other reasons for stopping the alcohol flow on campus. Perhaps there are appendages co the rumored 21 campus policy that uill help those that really need it. Who knows? Definitely not the students. All they hear is gossip. 
Sooner, but probably later, an official alcohol policy will be set. Rumor has it the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees agreed to a 21 campus at their recent Florida meeting, but it cannot be written in Du 
Lac until the entire Board votes on it. Once a policy is set, the administration will try its best to explain that policy to the students. Ifthat policy and explanation do not seem rational and ef­fective in dealing with the problem, students should step out of their apathetic shoes and not keep quiet about it. 
Late last semester, one Sunday afternoon, a banner hung outside a fourth floor Farley window. It was an at­tempt to wake up the stu­dents to the fact the administration was trying to rob them ofbeer, pizza and a free press. That banner, or any like it, have not been seen on campus since then. 

RA's) eye also. This is not to say the problem will vanish. 
The Observer is as concerned about thisproblem as many students are. In an attempt to inform all about the issue, The Observeris publishing a fourpart series ofarticles concerning the role ofalcohol on campus starting tomorrow.

Vastly increasing our insecurity 
Editor's note: This is the last in a series ofar­ticles examining the logic of a nuclear freeze. 
The goal ofimproving missile accuracy is to he able to destroy the enemy's nuclear weapons. Accuracy is essential to achieve this goal. In order to destroy a land-based ICBM stored deep underground in a reinforced con-
RandyFahs 
Monday analysis 
crete silo, it is necessary to come close to a direct hit even with a warhead many times the power ofa Hiroshima bomb. 
Primarily through increasing accuracy, the United States, between 1970 and the early 1980s raised from less than 20 percent to more than 70 percent the probability that its Minuteman III ICBMs could destroy blast­resistant targets with a single shot. New weapon systems are expected to raise this probability to close to 100 percent. 
This incredible accuracy, which makes· it possible to destroy the other side's nuclear weapons from vast distances, is bringing a radical change in the military strategy of the nuclear superpowers. 
This strategy, called "counterforce," means planning for a first strike. The enemy's nuclear weapons can only be destroyed if they are hit in their launchers. Counterforce strategy, planning to hit first, is made possible and even necessary by highly accurate delivery sys­tems. 
Accuracy does not improve the deterrent effect of nuclear weapons. On the contrary, it means a departure from deterrent strategy. Deterrence does not require first-strike capability. It needs only the abilty to retaliate in response to an attack. For retaliation, hit­ting back second in revenge for having been hit first, accuracy is not necessary. There is no sense in developing accuracy for hitting tar­gets which are not there. 
The dangers we have faced while living un­der a strategy of deterrence have been immense. The new counterforce strategy retains all of those dangers, and adds a worse threat. 
It is a very grave threat when nuclear war can begin as a result ofsome unintentional or irrational act. As the shift from deterrence to counterforce strategy takes place, this threat remains undiminished, and even increases as the number ofweapons increase. But the dan­ger is far greater when nuclear war can begin as the result ofan intentional act and even, in a perverse way, as a rational act. 
With counterforce strategy growing out of highly accurate weapon systems, it becomes a rational necessity for those who control nuclear weapons to plan for the possibility ofa first strike. 
Indeed, in every crisis situation between the superpowers the logic of those highly ac­curate weapons will force each side to fear and even to anticipate a first strike by the other side. 
Ifeither side fears destruction ofsome large portion of its nuclear arsenal, it will want to launch its weapons before they are destroyed, and the other side will want to destroy those weapons before they are launched. Given the desperately fearful situation that accurate weapons create, nuclear war as an intentional act, and even as a rational act, will become not only possible, but almost inevitable. 

The Pershing II missiles in Europe are the first of the new generation of super-accurate weapons to be operational. They will be able to destroy nuclear weapons in the western Soviet Union in six to eight minutes. 
The Soviets say they will respond by install­ing a launch-on-warning system. When their radar and computer systems identify an incoming attack, they will automatically launch a counter-attack in order to avoid destruction of their weapons. 
This means the safety of people on our side will depend upon the reliability of Soviet radar and computer systems. Our side's more advanced systems have made numerous er­rors, and some have taken six or more minutes to correct. 
Can we realistically expect that Pershing II missiles will increase our security when they stimulate a launch-on-warning response? 



Lebanon: a host of unlearned lessons 
Presidential candidate George McGovern is the American political figure who had the best assessment of the situation in Lebanon: "I don't know that there has to be an American solution to that problem. We've fallen into the 
George Crowell 
Guest columnist 
pattern of thinking there has to be. Maybe there isn't one." 
President Reagan is no different from his recent predecessors in trying to impose American-made solutions to problems our government does not fully understand. If the 
U.S. State Department clearly understood the regional complexities in many areas of the world, it would conclude that not all could be solved by U.S. might. 
In other words, solutions which are in the best interest of this country might not be beneficial to nations such as Lebanon. In fact, our meddling might even make matters worse. 
The lessons which have gone unlearned in Lebanon were ignored in such places as Viet­nam, Iran, Guatemala and El Salvador. These developing nations also were experiencing deeply-rooted internal turmoil. 
America was a latecomer in each situation, and made hasty decisions about which faction to support. We committed ourselves to a local leader with tons ofmilitary machinery and, in some cases, even direct intervention by U.S. personn;el. 
We failed to understand that civil wars are not necessarily a matter for East-West super­power intervention. We failed to realize that our handpicked leaders might not be the most popular (or even the most benevolent) in the nation. We failed to see that U.S. military power will not hold up puppet leaders and tip the balance in our favor. 
In many cases, U.S. force actually worsened the situation. And perhaps the most costly mistake ofall was ourgovernment's desire to hold on to unviable policies, even when it was time to save face. 
With all this experience in foreign policy foul-ups, it is surprising that we made every single one of these mistakes in Lebanon. The Lebanese nation is made up of sixteen dif­ferent religious communities vying for con­trol. Their only allegiances to the U.S. or the U.S.S.R's proxy Syria comes when they need help inflictiing damage on one of the other competing groups. 
Amin Gemayel is a member of one of the radical competing groups, the Christian Phalangists. He is not a moderate who is wil­ling to compromise and work with the other groups. His widespread electoral support was due largely to the assassination ofhis brother. With so much killing, the passage oftime, and his own unwillingness to act in concert with other groups, Gemayel has lost nearly all ofhis power and support. 
U.S. military might cannot hold him ·in power. The American trained Lebanese a:rmy has been the victim of desertion and embarassing defeats at the hands of local militias. To his countrymen, Gemayel looks more and more like a Western puppet. 

The U.S. cannot solve Lebanon's problems, yet it plunged right into the quagmire. The Marine contingent has, from the very begin­ning, had a role which is largely underfined. Their redeployment offi;hore signals the im­minent collapse of the Gemayel government and U.S. impotency in bringing the struggle to a swift and peaceful end. 
In the future, the United States must remember that it cannot shape the face ofthe world in its image. The United States can have a beneficial effect as mediator and peacekeeper, but only when the groups in­volved have a basis for negotiation. Our troups can be effective peacekeepers only when they act as a buffer between sides who are willing to stop firing at each other. 
Nations have their own characteristics and priorites which might be radically different from our own. Ifour involvement fails to take this into account, we will likely contribute to the conflict, and possibly cause a complete collapse.

N
otre Dame is supposnlly the producer ofgreat minds. You'd

.~omt·rhing that the puhlic took to heart, that the press got hold of 
and put into print. that claimed its place among the great quotations

And pt·rhaps among us today there are a few individuals who will go on to utter words that willlivt· forever on record, immortal words dt·stiJwd to ht· memorized hy grade-school children someday.just look a! till' Jlt'opk living around you. 
(>kay, well, mayhe not. 
But why is it so inconceivable to us, then? Simple. This is Notre Dame, a world ofits own -different from any other place in the galaxy. 
And it dot·sstrange things to people. 
Imagine if all the peopk who tlrst hlahhed all those wonderful phrases which you were forcl'd to remember in your earlier years, had attt'lllkd Notre Dame. Thdr quotl's might not have been as memorahlt·. 
Descartes: I think, but more importantly, I have a laminated ID card with my picture and social security number on it; therefore, I am. 
Patrick Henry: Give me Liberty since Ican't have the Sugar or the Cotton. 
Aesop: It is thrifty to prepart· today for the wants oftomorrow, hut it is far more fun to blow off. 
Cato the Elder: Carthagt· is tine, hut Elkhart must he destroyed. 
John F. Kennedy: Now our stomachs summon us again-not as a call to hear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though emhattkd we art·; hut a call to hear the burden ofa long, hard-to-swallow struggle, year in and year out, a struggle against the common enemies of man: breaded veal, cheese cutlets, frito casscrok, and death itself. And so, my f<.·llow Domers, ask not what your dining hall can do for you; ask what you can do for your dining hall.

n an attempt to thread visual art, movement, sound and literature into an evening of'performance art," Angela Allyn unveiled her new work, "Personas and Other Found Objects" last Friday evening. Allyn is the founder of Abiogenesis Dance Collective, and has been in residence ht:re this week on her break from New York where she is teaching at Columbia University, and also working on a Maters ofArts in Dance. Kerry Axelsson and Step· hen Blaha assisted in the per­formace, and Normajohnson was in charge ofprops and sets. 
The various pieces in the dance concert reflected a trend of mini-, malism in modern dance. Each presentation flowed continuously into the next without pause. The unrelated amalgamation ofscenes created some interesting results. 
The visual impact ofthe set was quite stunning. Black and red sht:ets ofpaper hung from the ceiling and served as masking lor the dancers as well as a frame for the performing area. About 20 white mao;ks and other everyday objects were care· fully placed in and around the performing area suggesting some 
mind tripping. 
Allyn's theme pertained to her own experiences into the psychic, as well as her attempts to draw from various literary sources such as the personal want-ads in theVillage Voice; a monologue by David Getz; "Tricks with Mirrors" by Margaret Atwood and writings from Dr. Rohrshach.

The album's ten songs, humorous at times, carefree throughout, are linked by Ant's wide-ranging tenor voice and a sexy theme that seems to say, "You can have me ... for a price." Indeed, one has only to look at Ant's bare-chested pose on the al· bum's sleeve to realize that platonic philosophy is not always on his mind. 
The album opens with a Phil Collins-produced, and therefore drum-dominated tune, "Strip," that asks the proverbial question, "If! strip for you, will you strip for me?" The syncopated rhythm, coupled with the fun lyrics make this an easy pop tune to listen to.

The evening was a bit overwelm­ing with so much information presented in such close proximity. Allyn's ideas needed refining, clarification. and most ofall, simplification. The six concepts presented were: Theld; The Ego;The 
Rohrshach Blots; Collective totally conscious; The Super Ego A. Social Climbing;andTheSuperEgoB.Per­sonal~y, no conclusions. These 
needed to have Allyn's point ofview clearly established. The drone ofthe monotonous voices on the tape added confusion to the perfor­mance, rather than supporting and clarifying what was on stage. Reduc­tion in dialogue and a better presentation of the literature was needed. 
The relationship ofthe three per­formers was vague. There was little kinetic sense ofdrama between per­formers with the exception of Axelsson's presentation during an improv section. She exploded across the space, ripping the set and stuff­ing part ofit down Allyn's leotard. This was her physical reacton to "A responsible young adult." 
As an overall assessment, the eve­ning was long. The loosely presented ideas needed structure and inner rythm.

well with the back-up vocals, creat­ing an excellent effect. One ofthe al­bum's stronger pieces, "PlaybolJ." follows. Here Ant's spoken word im­itates a classy playboy on the make, always with the perfect line for the perfect lady. 
"Montreal" is next up with a Twenties sound reminiscent of Taco's "Puttin' on the Ritz" released earlier this year. The middle ofthe song drags with,t:epetition, but good string accompaniment builds the song toward a strong conclusion. A syncopated drumbeat similar to Ant's "Goody Two· Shoes" oflast year drives "Navel tQ Neck" through breaks in which Ant reiterates, "I want to kiss you." 
The album ends with yet another cleverly-worded rocker, "Amazon." As with most ofthe other songs, Ants smart lyrics portend deeper meanings -meanings he can never deliver. 
The production is very polished on the surf..tce but a listener seeking something more: gutsy, more impor­tant, in Ant's music will search a long time. 
Adam Ant has the voice and the charisma to be a top notch perfor­mer. He has the perception to write clever lyrics. His goal should now be to find sophisticated subject matter more appropriate for his song­writing talents.

Fantasy of a 'tortured world' 
by Beth DeSchryver 
features staff writer 
I
n The One Tree, book two of the Second Chronicles ofThomas 
Covenant, Stephen Donaldson continues the story ofCovenant's 
quest to save the Land from Lord Foul and the Sunbane, a quest 
begun inThe Woundedland and continued in White Gold Wielder. 
As these books cannot easily be read as separate novels, this book 
review is more a trilogy review. Donaldsonoriginally introduced his 
fantasy world in a previous trilogy in 1977, in which Covenant is 
drawn from our world into the Land to aid the Land in a battle against 
its ancient enemy, Lord Foul. Covenant defeats Foul through the 
wild magic embodied in hiswhite gold ring, but returns to our world 
without destroying the villain. 

Ten years have passed for Thomas Covenant, but centuries have passed for the Land. Lord Foul has again risen to dominate the Land, inflicting upon it the Sunbane, a perversion ofnatural law which af­flicts the Land with extreme heat, rain, fertility, and pestilence in rapid succession. The people ofthe Land are forced to make blood sacrifices to cope with this force that is slowly destroying their world. Confident ofhis power, Lord Foul summons Covenant to the Land, seeking to gain from him the white gold and wild magic, or to drive Covenant himselfto use his power in a battle which would destroy the arch of time and enable Foul to break free ofthis world. Linden Avery, a doctor who is found to possess Earthsight, is brought with Covenant. Earthsight is the ability to perceive health or hurt in all things. It is this that aids Covenant in understanding the Sunbane. 
In seeking a way to battle Lord Foul, Covenant journeys through­out the land, rejected by most ofthe people, who believe him to be evil. Through the knowledge he gains, however, Covenant resolves to seek for "the one tree" from which to create a new StaffofLaw to aid in healing the Land. The One Tree is the story ofthis difficultjour­ney. White Gold Wielder concludes the trilogy with Covenant's return to the Land and his confrontation with Lord Foul. 
In his books Do~aldson uses many stock elements ofepic fantasy -a magic staff, a ring ofpower, a journey into an evil moun­tain ...yet while many of Donaldson's names and elements may seem trite or obvious, hiswork is strikingly original in the qualities of the Land and ofThomas Covenant. For Covenant is a leper, an American leper whose disease has become controlled, but who is forced into solitude by society. His struggle to function in society as a leper forms a major theme ofthe original trilogy, which begins shortly after the discovery ofhis disease. 
While the second trilogy focuses less on Covenant's leprosy, it is more intricate and psychological, creating a work ofgreater depth. The effect on the characters ofseeing this tortured world around them and of their own actions or inability to act play a substantial role in the evolution of the story. Thomas Co t venant and Linden Avery must struggle not only with their adversary, but with their own pasts which have driven each of them near enough to self-hate and despair for Lord Foul to corrupt them, and use them as tools for his own gain. 
In portraying these mner battles, however, Donaldson at times becomes too introspective, too often slowing the action to say the same message over and over. Agood deal ofdialogue consists of what characters want to say t to each other, but don't. All this creates some drag in the story'smovement, but not enough to seriously harm the work. Overall, the trilogy is very interesting and suspense­ful, not disappointing the reader in the solution ofriddles that appear throughout the text. Iwould recommend this trilogy to anyone who enjoys fantasy literature.

percent rate of Notre Dame. Led by Tom Sluby's own 8-10 first half per­formance, the Irish managed a 19-25 clip from the field. 
"For a while in the first half, I didn't think they were ever going to miss," said first year Brigham Young coach Ladell Andersen. "But, at the same time, the longer you play, the more wearing it is on the body, and it's real hard to shoot as well later in the ball game." 
"We were very fortunate to be in the ball game at the end of the first half." 
Sluby absolutely ate up his man, BYU's Scott Sinek, in getting his 18 points in the initial period. Sluby connected on a series of short pull­up jumpers, driving layups, and two dunks, one ofwhich came off a steal at midcourt and was definitely high­light film material. 
"(Sluby) plays an unusual position and we decided to go with our best defensve man againt him, although he was shorter," Andersen says. "Sinek was doing the best job he could possibly do and I don't know that I could do it any different." 
"I've put Scott Sinek up against a lot ofpeople and (Sluby's) probably the toughest he's had to guard." 
"He's really a good guard," Sinek says. "And physical. But in the second half, instead of worrying about where the picks, etc., were, I was just worrying about stopping him. My teammates helped me out, too." 
Sinek's teammates may have helped him out more in the second half, but the BYU junior neglects to mention how poorly Sluby shot in the final period, which may or may not have been a result ofhow Sinek's mates ailled him. 
The Irish captain, who would go on to get 26 points in the contest, could manage but 3-14 shooting in the final period as Notre Dame con­nected on only 5-24 as a team. 
If you can believe it, though, the 

Monday, February 20, 1984 -page 8 
Irish were in the game up until the 
end, even with the way they shot in 
the second half. Notre Dame could 
stay in the game because it con­
tinued to control game tempo, as it 
had since the outset, through the 
first 12 minutes of the second half. 
Throughout the game, when the 
Irish wanted to run, they ran. When 
they wanted to play their usual 
Digger Ball (patience on offense), 
they did. In changing from run-and­
gun at the start to a slower pace later 
on, Notre Dame always had its hand 
firmly on the game's tempo -until 
7:13 remained in the game. Then things got out of hand. With the Irish holding a 58-50 
lead, BYU reserve guard Steve Perry 
hit a jumpe-r from the top of the key. 
Notre Dame missed its shot down 
the floor and Perry came back 
downcourt1to answer with a layup. 
The Irish called a time out to try to 
settle things down, but to no avail. 
On its next possession, with the 
score now only 58-54, BYU was able 
to free Durrant for a dunk off a lob, 
and the 11th largest crowd in Mar­
riott Center history, 22,863, was in a 
frenzy as they sensed a Cougar 
comeback. 
Brigham Young then rattled off 
the riext six points, giving them 
twelve consecutive points, and it 
had a 62-58 lead. Two Dolan free 
throws brought Notre Dame back 
within 62-60 with 2:47 remaining. 
As time wound down, the Irish 
were forced to foul. But BYU is a 
very good free throw shooting team 
(it was shooting 75 percent from the 
line going into Saturday's contest), 
and hit six-of-eight down the stretch 
to finalize the defeat for Notre 
Dame. 
Ironically, it was BYU sophomore guard Chris Nikchevich who hit the final four free throws for the Cougars. Nikchevich, who was eight-of-eight on the day from the charity stripe, was recruited heavily by both Notre Dame and Brigham Young three years ago. The Wood­
land Hills, Calif., native made his final choice between the Irish and Cougars and, obviously, cast his lot with the latter. 
The Irish could manage only two­of-four free throws in the final mo­ments when they really needed the points. Effectively, BYU's twelve­point spurt had won the game for it, as, once the Cougars got ahead, the Irish couldn't muster a comeback at­tempt. 
"We just had a couple of key tur­novers and they came t down and scored," said Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps, "and that's all it took was about a two minute spurt before we just lost control. We beat our­selves. I think that was obvious ifyou saw the game." 
"But coming in here, and knowing how well Brigham Young can play at home, we handled it very well. We just didn't have the instinct to put it away at the end, and that's some­thing we have got to have more con­sistency with." 

The Irish, n ow 15-l 0, have three more games this season to work on that killer instinct they lacked Satur­day. That instinct is one of those things which come with experience, and, with an NCAA bid now out of the question, the three remaining games, and possibly some NIT games, are games in which the. Irish can work on getting that instintt for years to come. 
Saturday, Notre Dame showed that it really is becoming a hetter team. While the Irish may have folded in the game's waning mo­ments, the team, as a whole, really played quite well for much of the game. 
But, as the Irish players are quick­ly learning, there are 40 minutes to every game, and each minute must be played like the last in order to win. This may be a lesson that takes a long time to learn -but it sure is a valuable one.

The big match-up ofthe night was supposed to be at 126 pounds with Notre Dame senior Mark Fisher taking on Tom Pecora of Marquette. The match-up was still there, it was just wrestled at 134. Marquette moved Pecora up a class to 134 to try and avoid Fisher. 
"I think he didn't want to wrestle me hec.:ause he had nothing to profit from it." said Fisher. "He had already heatt·n me once this y·ear and if he lost it could only hurt him."

Army nurses are officers. They never lose status by moving, as so often happens in civilian hospitals. 
In fact, the Army encourages mobility and growth. You're encouraged to continue your education in clinical specialties such as Intensive Care, or Pediatrics, OB or Anesthesia and to attend conferences both inside and outside the Army.
