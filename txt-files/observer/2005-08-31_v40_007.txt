"You start out learning to march," Murray said. "It's really not that dill'enmt from march­ing ba~d tryout~. They taught us how to do the b<L<;Ie moves. 
While the activities of' tryouts resembled those for marching band, the Guard tryouts drew a hrroup of partidpanL<> that was mueh taller and entirely male-exeept for Murray.

utes as intelli­gent, talented, athletic and reli­gious, they also believe Domers to be stereotypically cocky. 
And they're right. 

Maybe cocky isn't the most of flattering choice of terminology, but the idea is -for the most part -wholly accurate. 
There's a reason why we sport an excessive amount of apparel, adorn our cars with no less than three decals and integrate the words "ND," "Irish," and "Domer" into our screen names. That rea­son is simple. We go to an amazing school. We know it. and more notably, we show it. 
Notre Dame is a unique college in many regards, but perhaps its most extraordinary characteristic is the student body's unfettered adulation for their school. 
Generally speaking, students not only like it here -they love it. For many of them, attending the University represents the fulfill­ment of a lifelong dream. 
"I see you've joined the Notre Dame cult," a friend told me this summer as she antagonistically gestured at my sweat pants, T­shirt, cap and sandals -all of which boasted some form of University emblem. 

My immediate thought was a hasty remark I tactfully chose to keep to myself: "Clearly, you are just jealous." 
But no, that wasn't (entirely) it. She, like other critics of the Notre Dame swagger, incorrectly mistook my adoration for arrogance. 
Although we indeed are a confi­dent bunch -any Domer will readily and unabashedly attest to Notre Dame's greatness-we are also misunderstood. 
That was it. She simply didn't understand. After all, how could she? She doesn't walk past a mas­sive Golden Dome every day, nor does she become lost in a sea of green -or yellow for that matter ~ on football Saturdays. She can't experience the ridiculous­ness that is Notre Dame on St. Patrick's Day, nor can she buy a hot dog with a quarter she found lodged in the bottom of her book bag. 
For these and the million and one other endearing idiosyncrasies of this glorious institution, we have a chip on our shoulder -and there is no shame in that.

AIM rnceived When students approximately first enter the $70,000 from a Craig Brede class, they are student fund at AIM student assigned to ana­
the inception of the curriculum. Each snmestor the University added another $50,000 to the portfolio. 
The portfolio's growth into a $3 million investmnnt was a direct resull of University donations and portfolio per­formance, professor Frank Heilly said. 
"ITho University] realized when they gavn us the money thoro was no promise how the students would do," Reilly said. 
For the last I 0 years, the portfolio's bnnehmark has boon the S&P 500. During this time pnriod, it has out-per­formed tho S&l' by an average of throe poreent each year. 
Studnnts must apply and be accnptnd into tho AIM course. Each semostor approximately 60 to 65 studnnts send in their resume, statement of intent and transcript for review. From tho pool ol' applicants, roughly 25 are admittod to the eourso. Ninety-live percent of tho studonts are l'inance lyze one of the 
25 stocks com­prising the portfolio passed down from the previous semester. At mid-semester the students decide whether to sell or buy more of the indi­vidual stocks, Heilly said. 
In the second half of the semester, each student choos­es and analyzes his or her individual stock selection. At the conclusion of the class, students must determine whether or not to invest in the researched stocks. The updat­ed portfolio is then passed on to the crop of AIM students. 
Recognizable investments in the portfolio include Aceenture, Avon Products, Dell, McDonald's, Morgan Stanley, and United Health Group. 
"Students are evaluated on the basis of their effort and input to the portfolio," Heilly said. "The performance of the portl'olio has nothing to do with the grade." 
Throughout the semester, students visit Chicago and 
New York. These trips offer the AIM participants exposure to a wide variety of money management firms, invest­ment banks, private equity companies, hedge funds and real-estate portfolios. 
Students who have taken the AIM class have gone on to work for such corporations and firms as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Boston Consulting, Fidelity Investments and Morning Star. 
Houghly 500 Notre Dame students have completed the AIM course. The former stu­dents feel a strong allegiance to the curriculum and provide strong connections for current AIM students entering the job market. 
"Employers who have these students feel they represent ND very well," Heilly said. 
Tim Lavelle, a finance major who completed the course last year, said that in all of his interviews, potential employ­ers questioned whether or not he had taken the AIM course. 
"It is the most applicable class I have taken and the fact that there are multiple profes­sors is very good because they have their own perspectives and strategies," Lavelle said. 
Current AIM student Craig Brede said the advantages of the course are well-deserved given the effort put in by stu­dents. 
"We learn everything we need to know to make us mar­ketable to Wall Street firms," Brede said. "Unfortunately, we pay for this by the enor­mous work load."

but it turned out to be the best decision I ever made," said Spartz. "I had way too much free time on my hands, so I started [the site] a few months after I began home schooling. I never expected it to get so big." 
And big it has grown. Emerson said that MuggleNet has become a profitable busi­ness venture. MuggleNet's extensive collection of content now draws more than 30 mil­lion visitors a month, making the Web site many times more popular than any competitors, even J.K. Howling's official site. 
The homegrown site has exploded into a cross-cultural phenomenon with international readers from over 150 coun­
tries logging in. 
The years of effort involved in creating the site didn't just attract the attention of fans, but the site also gained prestige in the eyes of the author, publisher and movie producers. 
Spartz was invited to the pre­mieres of the third Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, in both London and New York. Warner Brothers, the studio handling the films, even flew him out to the set of the fourth movie, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, where Spartz had the chance to interview the movie's actors. 
But none of that compares to Spartz's biggest accomplish­ment: MuggleNet's coverage of the sixth and most recent book in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Early one morning, Spartz received a phone call from the usually pri­vate author of the Harry Potter book series. 
"J.K. Howling called in May to invite me to her house and interview her on the day of the new book's release," said Spartz. "I had to stay up all night to read through the entire book in time for the interview." 
In the meantime, back in the U.S., MuggleNet co-sponsored the self-proclaimed world's largest book release party in history at a Mount Prospect, Ill. mall. Spartz said that 10 to 15 thousand Potter fans -dressed in costume of course -attend­ed the record-breaking event. 
As the site matured, it became more difficult for Spartz to do all of the work by himself. Spartz began to hire volunteers to help with every aspect of the Web site, from posting news to creating the 
I-ITML code. 

All in all, over 100 unpaid vol­unteers run it with Spartz's oversight. 
The venture has even become a family affair. 
"My 16-year-old brother does the graphics," said Spartz. "And my parents have started to help out a lot more now that I'm in college. Even my 6-year-old brother offers me moral sup­port and encouragement." 
But despite his love for the Harry Potter series -the fourth book is his favorite -Spartz is not planning on focus­ing on writing or journalism at Notre Dame. Instead, his work managing MuggleNet's staff members and making executive decisions has conyinced Spartz to major in business manage­ment. 
"It's a lot better to hire people who are smarter than you instead of trying to do every­thing yourself," he said. 
Spartz said that he is not planning on MuggleNet becom­ing his full-time job after col­lege, nor is he thinking about starting another Web site. Instead, he plans on building his wealth investing in renew­able energy sources. 
In the mean time, while Spartz continues his education, Notre Dame's own Harry Potter fans might be in luck. 
Although Emerson has not confirmed anything yet, he said he is considering starting a Harry Potter club on campus. 
"Maybe I'll start a [Harry Potter] club later on," said Spartz. "But right now I'm still trying to find my place at the University."

the ACE house was without power 
Tuesday. 
"The downtown area is flooded 

and there's a lot of debris," she 
said. "One of the schools got a 
decent amount of damage and 
one is close to flooding." 
The student teachers, currently 

serving at five schools in the 
Mobile area, stocked up on essen­
tials like water, supplies, food and 
batteries Sunday after the storm's 
severity was predicted to increase. 
Gorman, whose school will 

reopen no earlier than Thursday, 
said she "had an idea" of the region's hurricane potential before embarking on the pro­gram. 
"When they first told me I was going to Mobile, they had pictures [of previous storm damage]," Gorman said. "But I didn't expect this." 
Notre Dame has already begun fundraising for the disaster, said Father Richard Warner, director of Campus Ministry. 
"We wrote to rectors and asked them to take up collections this weekend," Warner said. "Dillon already collected $500 last week and turned it in without even ask­ing." 
Half of the money collected this week from Masses in the Basilica and residence halls will go to Catholic Relief Services, and half will go to the damaged ACE schools and a school run by Holy Cross, Warner said . 
"I don't think anybody realized how terribly destructive this was going to. be," Warner said. "There's a lot of poor people there, and I think we can really help." 
Staud said the student teachers he had talked to seemed upbeat despite the disaster. 
"One said, 'It's only the middle of hurricane season,"' Staud said. ''I'm kind of in awe of the strength of the people down there."

load of clothes costs $1.25 and drying clothes costs 7 5 cents, rather than $1.50 and $1, respec­tively. 
David Prentkowski, the director of Notre Dame Food Services, said the new lalilldry pricing incentives were introduced as a way to encourage students to use Domer Dollars instead of cash on cam­pus. 
Notre Dame Food Services started offering Domer Dollars six years ago for use by students at different food service locations. The number of places on campus that accept Domer Dollars has gradually risen over the years ­now they can be used at such locations as the bookstore, the copy shop and in vending machines. 
Notre Dame's student govern­ment was instrumental in encour­aging the installment of card readers for the laundries into all dorms, Prentkowski said. 
The government reasoned that since the lalilldry system is some­thing most students utilize, it

Shirt are very positive about it," Wiatrowski said. "I haven't heard any negative feedback." 
Student ni~ponses to The Shirt have ranged from enthu­siasm to disgust, with most negative responses from stu­dents aimed at the new golden color. 
Cavanaugh freshman Teresa Nesbitt said she is not plan­ning on buying The Shirt this year. 
"The color is garish and the quote on the back is too cheesy for wo·rds," she said. 
Some students, however, think The Shirt appropriately represents the Notre Dame school spirit. 
"I really like the design on the back. The quote isn't great, but changing things up can never be bad," said Keenan freshman Joe Gorman. 
Although he has not bought a shirt yet, junior Jourdan Sorrell approved of The Shirt's new color. 
"Gold is a good color," he said. "It signifies victory, and 

would benefit the University to 
make it easier and more cost­
effective. The Card Services office 
hopes that the 50 cents total price 
decrease will encourage students 
to use their cards rather than 
change. 

The University also expressed 
interest in dealing primarily in 
electronic transfer, since it is less 
costly and time-consuming than 
processing coins, Prentkowski 
said. 

Prentkowski said that there is 
an attraction and usefulness in 
Domer Dollars. 
"It is a way for parents to give 
money to their children that they 
know they will use on campus," 
he said. 

Prentkowski said Domer Dollars 
are much more convenient to 
carry than cash, and said that 
some staff members have request­
ed the addition of Domer Dollars 
to their ID cards. 
Kara Whitaker, an assistant at 
the Card Services office, has 
noticed that students are taking 
advantage of the ability to use 
Domer Dollars to get a reduced 
lalilldry cost. 
"Before this year there was not ·a lot of incentive to use Domer Dollars, but now there is more 
it's better than red or pink." 
The President of The Shirt Project, Kathleen Fox, stands by the color change. Fox was responsible for coordinating design and production of The Shirt. 
"Those who say The Shirt is yellow are wrong," Fox said. "It's gold." 
Fox said that the change in color was to commemorate the new coach, Charlie Weis, and to celebrate a new era in foot­ball. 
"For the past three years, The Shirt has been green because of Tyrone Willingham. With our new coach, Charlie Weis, the new Shirt color should lead us into a great season," said Fox. "I hope the new Shirt inspires a great sea­son." 
The Shirt Project was started in 1990 to aid a graduate stu­dent who had been injured in a car accident. Since then, it has grown to become the largest student fundraiser on campus, raising over $2.5 mil­lions for student organizations and financial aid.

Bush finds himself under mounting pressure from both parties to ease prices 
Associated Press 
WASil INGTON -The Whito llouso has signaled it is willing to tap tho nation's crude oil stockpile il' needed to help refiners whose supplies wore dis­rupted by llurrieane Kat­rina. But the action won't have niuch oiToct on soar­ing gasoline prit:os. As fuel costs km~p rising, President Bush could find himself' under increasing pressure from both parties to do more. 
As tho shutdown ol' oil platforms, rnf'innrios and pipolinns drovo energy prices to nnw highs, Bush doeided to end his summer vacation on his Texas ranch and return to Washington on Wednesday to monitor hurricann recovery efforts. 
Even bnf'oro tho powerful storm rippnd through the oil-rich Gulf' of Mexico. White llousn advisors were blaming Bush's slido in the polls at lnast in part on high gas priees. And law-­makers homo for their August break have been getting an earful of' com­plaints about pump prices. 
But tho political reality­l'or Bush and !'or tho law­makers -is that there are row roalistic options for t~asing prices in tho short term. The storm damage joins other factors that are relentlessly pushing up prices, inducting continu­ing war in Iraq, tensions with Venozunla and rising demand in China. 
"In the rwxt few months, there's no upside," said economist Mark Zandi of' Economy.com, an economic consulting servicn. "And this winter, we're going to !'eel it morn noticeably as people pay reeord gas prices and record home­heating bills."

The crisis draws atten­tion to the Strategic Petroleum Hoserve, tho nation's emergency supply or 700 million barrols of crude oil buried in salt cav­erns in Texas and Louis­iana. 
Bush is expected to authorize the release of just enough oil from the rnservo to help make up 
l'or production losses directly relatnd to tho pow­nrl'ul storm -with a stipu­lation that tho oil latnr be replacod by oil companies with an ev11n larger quan­tity. 
With gasoline prices nearing or surpassing $3 a gallon in many areas, some lawmakers want the presi­dent to go l'urther and open the stockpile's spigots to help drive down prieos. 
The administration con­tends that would dnf'mtt the purpose of' tho reserve, which is to protect the nation against supply dis­ruptions like th11 Arab oil nmbargons ol' tho I 1J70s.

More restaurants offering gluten-free menus 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -As a longtime chef' in four-star restaurants, Joseph Pace had seen appreciative customers before. But nothing prepared him f'or the day that a well-dressed man walked into his Greenwich Village restaurant, ordered a pizza and a beer, and broke into tears. 
That man, Pace recalls, had been diagnosed ten years earlier with celi­ac disease -an incurable affliction that makes the body unable to take anything containing gluten, a protein round in wheat, barley and rye. 
The pizza and beer that Pace serves in his restaurant Hisotteria, like many other items on his menu, are f'ornm­lated with substitutes f'or wheat and barley, making his placo a magnot f'or people who havn celiac diseasn. The customer told Pace that hn hadn't been ablo to enjoy a pizza and beer !'or a decade. 
"This is what tho restaurant busi­ness is," Pace said. "Making people happy." 
Not every customer may be as oll'u­sive as that one, but Paco says he gets tremendous amounts of feedback from customers, which also helps him try out new recipes. His latest experi­ment is a pasta made from white beans. Rice, the main ingrediont in risotto, is naturally gluten-free. 
Founded just live years ago, Pace's restaurant quickly became known among people with celiac disease, who make heavy use of the Internet and e-mail to share restaurant rec­ommendations. 
Several major restaurant chains are also reaehing out to the celiac com­munity. Outback Steakhouse, P.F. Chang's and other restaurant compa­nies offer monus or gluten-f'roo dish­es, and more arn joining them. 
Last month, Mitehell's Fish Markot, a 13-restaurant chain based in Columbus, Ohio, introduced gluten­f'ree menus, and six months ago Boston-based Legal Sea Foods did the same in its 31 restaurants. Hkhard Vellante, the exeeutivo chef for Legal Sea Foods, said his company adoptnd 
a. gluton-frnn monu after hearing requests from eustomnrs and also noticing that competing restaurants were doing it. 
Many people with coliac disease miss the textures that eome with imt­ing foods that eontain wheat, sueh as erusty bread, croutons in salads and crispy !'rind foods, which of'tnn con­tain broad erurn bs or flour, Vnllante said. 
So Legal Sea Foods worked on mak­ing substitutos -chick pna eroutons for salads; eorn mnal for frying and chiek pea crumbs for baking instead of' l'lour. Many items, they l'ound. unexpectedly eontairwd gluton and had to be nxeludnd !'rom the cnliae­safn menu, ineluding eoektail sauen, balsamic: vinegar and blue ehnnsn.

galion and disregard." 
Kinder's negative experiences on the Guard did not make a differ­ence in her decision, Murray said, especially since Kinder had said that she did not regret her choice to jf>in. But Murray remained nervous about interacting with the all-male group. 
"Once I got there, it was better than I expected," she said. "It's like any other group of guys. Was I treated like one of the guys? No, but it was awkward lor everyone. I wa<> trying to decide if I should act like a guy, but I shouldn't have ·to beeausn I'm a girl." 
While the 2000 Guard was not receptive to a female member, the current Guard was open to the idea, Sanchez said. 
"When I was outside observing them, it seemed that they were treating her the same as any other individual," he said. "With Molly there was a bit of bias." 
Sanchez said the 2005 Guard was trying its best to raise the group's image. 
If she were to make the Guard, Murray said that she would have asked only for tolerance. 
"I wouldn't be asked to be treat­ed better, and I wouldn't ask to be treated worse," she said. 
Brian Martin -captain of the Irish Guard -said that all prospective members were treated equally regardless of gender. 
"We don't make any favorites," he said. "I think in terms of try­outs, which i<> the only place I have any experience in this situation, I don't think that there is that much more difficulty for a guy or a girl. Marching is difficult to learn and hard on the body." 

There is no set formula for a Guardsman, he said. 
"It all just depends on who is the best marcher and who is the best fit for Irish Guard," he said. "It's not just about marching. When you are at attention you also have to look the part. That's the whole reason you have to be 6-foot-2". It's supposed to be an intimidating thing." 
The identity of the Guard played as big a part as gender relations in her tryout, Murray said. 
"I came from the marching band," she said. "I view the Irish Guard ao;; being a part of the band, and they don't. They're supposed to be our version of the flag corps, but they see themselves as a sepa­rate group that happens to lead the band." 
Though Murray would have lost her spot in marching band had she made the Guard, band leaders were excited that she auditioned. 
"We're hoping she will audition next year. She did very well, but there were only a lew spots," said Sanchez. 
Sanchez said tryouts are extremely competitive for anyone, though the degree of difficulty varies each year depending on the number of returning Guardsmen. 
"Often people don't make it their first year," he said. "None of the four band members who audi­tioned this year made it. There were a number of people who tried out for the third time. Molly Kinder didn't make it her first year, but her second year we took five people and she was number two." 
Murray said she plans on trying out again next year.

·POLICIES 

One night last spring walking home from a late night studying in Lafortune, I heard loud shouting com­ing from a couple across the quad. Their argument -the content of which I had no idea-gave me renewed hope in Notre Dame stu­dents. 
Every day, I hear plenty of jovial conversation and silly laughing ­and that is great. It shows that we enjoy each other's company and like to have fun. For me though, the good feelings, times and memories are not enough to have healthy, meaningful and transformational interactions. Some of the best relationships I have are lit­tered with arguments, tense conver­sations and confrontational moments. 
Quite simply, our lives are not meant to be all giggles and small talk. We do not change by taking what we get and being content. We do not help the people we care about by refusing to confront them when they need it. Lasting relationships are forged in the light of shared joys and the fire of shared pain and confrontation. I can remember one time my friend and roommate called me out on a 11ippant remark I made to her. I did not say it out of malice, but she told me she did not like it. Her standing up for herself to me -her friend -showed me her respect for herself and demand to be respected by me. Not only did I learn something about my friend, but also about myself-I say things that I do not really mean that may hurt people. That interaction was transformational and stayed with me. Without my friend's courage to confront me, I would never have learned that lesson. 


Why are we afraid to confront each other, to express our anger in public, or be anything but happy and quiet? I can only remember overhearing a few angry interactions in my entire stay at this school. Is Notre Dame an anger­free zone? A collegiate utopia? I doubt it. 
With all the campaigns and efforts to reform our university, heated cor­respondence in The Observer and other publications and disgruntled student mumblings behind closed doors, we have got issues for sure. Yet, none of these, translations of anger or stress turns into anything real. 
For example, I have been a Viewpoint columnist going on my third year and have received a fair share of negative comments by e-mail from readers. However, e-mail to me is an innocuous medium -lacking the power of tone, gestures and pas­sion in speech. Only 7 percent of con­versation is the words we use -so e­mail to me is not my idea of con­frontation. I have never had a conver­sation -face-to-face -with a disap­proving reader and have comfortably stayed in my worldview. As much as I believe in my own ideas, forged by my own experiences, I would have wel­comed an honest conversation from someone from a different perspective on an issue I raised. 
We should not be afraid of anger; indeed it has produced some impor­tant developments in our society. Anger over segregation and racism produced the civil rights movement, anger over denial of full citizenship to women produced movements to gain the right to vote and anger over migrant working conditions produced the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and the successful Taco Bell Boycott. 
Anger gives us energy and connects our experiences and gut feelings to the disdainful things we see around us. Wjthout it we are simply coasting in this life, biding our time till we leave this Earth in splendid isolation. 
I believe we can be surrounded by people for all our lives, but never con­nect with or impact another if we refuse to confront each other; at the same time, we may be completely alone and have a tremendous effect on others. Thomas Merton lived away from the world as we would dub it in a monastery -yet his targeted and powerful writings impact people's lives and choices even today. 
The foundation of confrontation ­whether to our friends, fellow Darners or the institutions that manage our lives-is compassion and love. When we care about a person or a commu­nity we want it to grow in a trajectory that is positive. When we love another person we are compelled to see the good and the bad -recognizing both in compliments and confrontation. When we love a place like Notre Dame, it should shame us to let fix­able flaws go on without an objection. We are not perfect and -news nash -neither is our university. 
To practice the love and respect demanded by our creed, we have got to show a little, maybe even a lot, of anger and confront people and issues when necessary. So keep speaking bravely to each other. You may not know it now, but that may have helped another change for the better.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Take a closer look 
II. snerns to 11111 that orw of' the many reasons for studying history is the pragmatic desire not to repoat tho blunders of the past. Unfortunately, Ian Honderos is advocating such a dis­astiJr in his Aug. 30 Op-1\d piece "Of patriots and tyrants.'' 
In his m1couragnment of "romoving" the democratically elected and popular Hugo Chavez, Bondnros supports sending weapons and bolstering the opposition. This is eerily similiar to situations in that past whnrn the United States supported leader·s such as Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan. Of course, as everyone knows, the U.S. interven­tion into those areas has bnen wildly successful. Moreover, Honderos' opinion that a small rngimn of Marines would make a civil war swift and easy is laughalrle considering the fiascos of tho Vintnam War and present-day Iraq. 
Although this willingness to repeat historical tragedies is disturbing, I find that the fact that this dangnrous rubbish is eoming from the president emeritus of the College Hnpuhlieans oven worse. What happened to the Republicans who were against nation build­ing'? Why have Hepublicans forgotten that it is exactly the policies that Honderos advocates and his gnneral "Amoriea knows best" attitude that are what cause most of the world to dnspise the United States and are the sources of our many international problems? 
It is not becausn people hate our "freedom." Nor are people jealous of our "wealth" and "powor." Such arrogance and bravado is dangerous for America. To put it in terms that clas­sii~S majors such as Hondcros may understand, the United States sufl'crs from a bad ease of hubris and the vinws and attitudes ol' people likn Honderos and the College Hepublicans are hastnning America's tragic fall from grace.

A textbook case of gouging 
Tho rest of tho natil'n is complaining about gas prices these days, but paying close to three dollars a gallon at the pump is nothing compared to what most of us have been shelling out at the bookstore in the past week. The sticker shock is more than enough to rival any fill-up, as cash registers from Katie Neweomb to the Corner Crlstol climb to gasp-inducing triplo digil<>. Yet while the targel<>

to the president, choose your eulprit), the staggBring cost of textbooks seems more like an unexplainable, if miserabln, phenomenon. 
But just in time for baek-to-sehool season, the Govnrnnwnt Accountability Otnee, at the request of Hop. David Wu, D-Orc., published a study on Tuesday about thn skyrocketing eosl<; of books that indieatns that tlmre may, in !~Let, bn some accounta­bility to bn had. The study found that the prices of textbooks havn nnarly triplnd in the past twenty ynars, inernasing at about twice the rate of infla­tion. 
Translatml into your lifo, that means the average student is spendin}{ nnarly $900 a year on text­hooks and supplies, or 26 pnmmt of his or her tuition and l(ms at public li1ur-ynar colleges like the Univ1~rsity. Anwrican farnilins spnnt mon1 than six billion dollars on t1~xtbooks in tlw 200~-2004 aca­dmnie ynar. What's driving the incrnasns? By and largn, says thn GAO, all thosn multimndia bdls and whistlns that l'.onw shrink-wrappnd with your books. 
Thn industry name for thn pradico is "bundling," and textbook publishers daim that they're "increasing invnstmenl<> in devoloping supplemenl<> in rnsponsn to demand from instructors." If you're thinking that you'd just as soon spnnd the nxtra nL<>h on your r1~nt instnad of a supplemental CD­HOM you'll bn using all of never this semester, you'rn not alone. The Public lnternst Hesearch c;roups of Califhrnia and Orngon eonductnd a study of thnir own in thn fall of 2003 and diseovernd that whiln half of collogn tnxtbooks now eome bundlnd, 65 percent of fiteulty rarnly or never use the bun­dlnd matnrials in their college coursns. 
While lnarning supplmnenL<> can have a useful placn in and ouL<>ide thn dassroorn, the nnnd is dnarly not driven by professors but rather by the pro lit rnotivns of the industry, leaving us students with a stack of very expensive coasters. 
The useless computer disks and glossy case study booklets aren't the only examples of the publishing industry's gouging ofstudent pocketbooks. According to professors interviewed for the study, textbook publishers issue a new edition of a single book approximately every three years -for all subjects, regardless of how the subject has changed during that time period. Obviously, material in text­books must keep pace with new diseoveries, theo­ries and ideas in the fields they address, but keep­ing the material up to date doesn't exeuse forcing students to spend more money on a new edition of a Latin book, for example. 
But what's good for students isn't good for the bottom line -as soon as one version of a textbook becomes available to the majority of students, the profit margin for the publishers starts to decrease, as new books on average cost 58 percent more than their used counterparts. 
The survey quotes a former publishing industry exocutive tor the Academic Press as acknowledging exactly that: "Publishers release new f~ditions of suecessful textbooks every few years -not to improve content, although that may be a byproduct -but to discourage the sales of used books by making them seem obsolBte." There's no blaming the professors in this ease, either; 76 percent of !ac­uity report that the new college textbooks editions they use arejustilied "never" to "halfthe time," and 40 permnt of f~tculty say the new editions arn "rarely" to "never" justified. 
The Textbook Market Fairness Act, passed by the Virginia General A<>sernbly this year, requires Virginia's public universities to post course booklists online so that studenl<> ~~an comparison shop fi1r tho best prices; the new policy is certainly a step in the right direction. 
But empowering students to hunt fi:Jr the ehnap­est of outrageously priced books is only a band-aid, and is no substitute f(Jr placing pressure where it is due. The price-gouging practices ofthe textbook publishing industry hurt students and hurt universi­ty communities, and the publishers need to answer to the studenl<> and families paying the bills.

New law provokes toke 
What dons possession of marijuana and spnnding on the highway have in common? Nothing yet, but if tlw PXf~eutivo director of the Drug Policy Forum of Kansas, Laura Green, successfully persuades the City Commission at the upcoming Sept. 6 meeting, then getting caught with marijuana would he treated as a speeding ticket. That is if they Staff are caught at all. Editorial 
Penalties for having marijuana should remain at the State and F.(~deral Courts level and not brought down to the City Unilwrsity of Courts just because people feel like it's too Kansas harsh. l lniversity Daily 
Of course, the majority of the people in Kansan Lawrence, Kan., that took the Lawrence Journal-World's poll asking should mari­juana possession be treatnd as a traffic ticknt, the response was predietable. Five hundrnd eighteen of the 7:34 votes were in favor of this proposal that should just go up in smoke. 
As Green wrote in her letter to the City Commissioners, her reasoning was for the welfare of students. As it stands now, a University of Kansas student found in possession of marijuana will be arrested and the case would be held at Douglas CountY. Courthouse. Because the case would be in a Statn or Federal Courthouse, the student would be denied financial aid because ol' the drug conviction. 
If marijuana possession cases were held in City Court, then a drug possession would not appear on a student's record. 
The proposal also asks that marijuana enforcement would become a low priority. Making the punishment less severe for this offense would increase the number of incidents. If there is no incentive to stay drug-free, then the drug problem will rise. It's like making all speeding tickets 10 dollars or 50 dollars no matter how fast you were traveling over the speed limit. This would just produee more people speeding beeause the conse­quence isn't that great of a punishment. 
Green states in her letter to the City Commission, "The long­term benefit will be less young people with criminal records ... " This is the line she's used to win over Lawrence's mayor, Boog Highberger, and District Attorney Charles Branson, who han­dles the marijuana cases for Douglas County. 
In Aug. 24, 2005 edition of the Lawrence-Journal World, Highberger said, "It wouldn't bar a student from getting financial aid ... [it's] appropriate because I think that would be a pretty harsh penalty for getting caught with a little pot." What, then, does qualify as a "little pot," Mr. Mayor? The Lawrence-Journal World article says the criteria is "small amounts of marijuana for personal use, not cases involving drug dealers." 
So, it's a little pot, that's okay. But what about drug dealers who make money here in Lawrence by selling by the bowl­full? They aren't selling it by the kilo, aftnr all. 
And what about those students who need financial aid who didn't get caught with pot? This law makes it possible for a student without a drug conviction to get passed up for student loans by a student with a drug conviction. 
Green said the penalties would be similar to those already existing: "a combination of diversion, treatment, probation and a maximum fine of $2,500 or a year in jail."-the Lawrence-Journal World, Aug. 24, 2005. If the pnnalties are the same P.xeept for tho arrest and the drug felony, thnn this should be a moot point. 
If you smoke pot and you got caught. it's simpln-you go to jail. Lawrence is not a monopoly game; thern should bn no "get out of jail" cards here. 
Certainly the fines and jail-time remain thn sanw, but tho long lasting ef'feets of' being caught with an illegal substance become virtually nil for first-time offnndnrs, p1·ovidnd they gnt caught doing the offending at all. 
If' drug usnrs and dealer·s in othnr Kansas towns hear that they can get their first time offenses stricknn from the record, won't they llock to a town where they know that thorn won't be any long term consequences to their record? 
Combine that with marijuana enforcement becoming a "low priority," and it's almost a given that marijuana use in Lawrence will increase, and it seems like our law-makers are okay with that. 
Well, the editorial board is not. The proposed plan is a com­plete lapse in moral judgment.

MOVIE REVIEWS 

Murphy, McAdams take flight in 'Red Eye' 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Assistant Scene Editor 

"Red Eye" is a tight, effective little thriller that coasts on the charisma of its two leads, Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams. Director Wes Craven is no stranger to the genre, as his cred­its include "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Scream." By contrast, "Hed Eye" is far more subdued than either of those lilms, as it unravels its relatively straightforward plot in a brief, busy 85 minutes. 
Watching "Hed Eye" is like listening to a song stripped down to its melody. Audiences have come to expect labyrinth plots and roller-coaster plot­twists from thrillers, so the fact .that the film has neither is surprisingly refreshing. 
Once the central conceit of the film has been estab­
up sitting next to each other on their Fresh Air flight from Dallas to Miami. From the moment the plane leaves the ground, the plot kicks into gear and doesn:t let up for the next hour. Revealing too much of the plot gives away the film's precious few surprises, suffice to say that Ripner is not all thnt he seems and his proximity to Reisart is far more than coincidental. The scope of the film is not quite as vast as one might expect, but the small-scale actually benefits the film, as it is able to concentrate on the tense conflict between the two lead characters. Using a plane as setting is effective, as it essentially traps Reisart and keeps her essentially at the mercy of her prover­bial captor. 
What is most surprising is that nei­ther Rachel McAdams nor Cillian Murphy bring anything less than believability to outlandish plot.

terms, arid when reviewing "Bed Eye" 
in that context, it fulfills its function very nicely. Wes Craven has made bet­ter films, but he rarely gets actors as talented and charismatic as Murphy and McAdams and he takes full advan­tage of that strength. 
It's no masterpiece, but it's well­wound and enjoyable to watch, which is more than can be said of many films far more ambitious than "Red Eye."

Unoriginal'Skeleton Key' unlocks no thrills 
By MARK BEMENDERFER Assistant Scene Editor 

At this point, a twist ending would con­stitute a thriller not actually involving a twist. In recent years, it has become all too common for movies to try to incorpo­rate some sort of twist in hopes of sal­vaging an otherwise forgettable movie. This trend has once again been dis­played in lain Softley's "The Skeleton Key," a movie that works ofT an original premise, yet manages to fall back into the usual trappings of the genre. 
"The Skeleton Key" starts off with Caroline (Kate Hudson) becoming disillu­sioned with her role as a hospice worker in a care center. In efforts to do more to help people, she 
quits her job at the

she cares for the especially con­
While some might argue that there is lit­tle distinction between the two, "The Skeleton Key" demonstrates that such an assumption is not true. The film is all buildup and no payoff. At times, it tries to evoke a sense of horror that never comes. At others, it tries to leave the viewer in suspense. Once again, it fails. Watching the movie, one is kept waiting for a strong emotion of any sort, which, once again, never comes. 
It's not the acting that fails the movie. All of the actors perform decently within the confines of the script, with no notice­able sore spots. They are all are fairly established actors, and this shows, thanks to the fine performances. 
Kate Hudson, who also appeared In "Raising Helen" and "Almost Famous," 
does well within 
her own role. Her 
elderly couple at the plantation. 

The husband (John Hurt) has recently had a stroke, and requires assisted liv­ing. The wife (Gena Rowlands) is suspi­cious of Caroline and her northern habits, but allows her to take the job. While working there, Caroline begins to discover that all is not as it seems, and that a dark magic called Hoodoo may be involved. 
The original premise is nice, but can only carry the movie so far. The film seems confused about what it wishes to accomplish. At times it wants to be hor­ror, at others it wants to be a thriller. 
vincing in his role 

as Ben Devereaux, the stroke afflicted patient that Caroline is hired to tend. Being unable to move for much of the movie, he could only convey emotions through using his eyes, and subtle movements. These were all done commendably. 
Hurt certainly has earned his screen presence, having starred in over 120 movies during his career. 
The script isn't bad either. Plotholes are not too prevalent, and it actually feels like a decent story. The setting is moderately unsettling, as is the house the old married couple live in. The sub-ject matter is mysterious, which is a good recipe for horror. On paper, it was probably much scarier than it ultimately became on the screen. 

The director, Iian Softley, has only six movies in his repertoire. This could explain the lack of any real substance to the film's style. 
Points should be given for the chosen subject alone, as movies based around voodoo and hoodoo are rare. When asked, some might think back and remember "Predator 2," which had some elements of voodoo in it. Movies that are based solely around those pagan practices are next to non-existent. 
Then again, "The Skeleton Key," and movies like it, may be the very reason more are not created, since they fail to impress. 
The main shortcoming of the movie is that it failed to fulfill its promises. The previews hinted at a possibly scary, potentially thrilling movie. The end product failed to evoke any emotions that associated with either. It's not nec­essarily a bad movie, but neither is it a good one. There are much better movies out there worth seeing.

'Brothers Grimm' fails to deliver fairy tale ending

From Terry Gilliam, one of the most original minds in modern cinema, ~~onws "Tho Brothers (;rimm." a weird and macabre tale of two brothers who conjun1 up demons -and destroy them for a hefty foe. 
Will (Matt Damon) and Jacob (an utt11rly incomprnhensibln Lleath Lmlger). known throughout 19th-centu­ry Cormany as conquerors of all that is supernaturally evil, are actually noth­ing morn than glorified pranksters.

Gilliam tries his best to inject it with trademarks like spiraling camera shots, crazy and nonsensical charac­ters and considerable narrative bent towards the dark and sinister, but to littlo avail. 
The trouble begins, however, with the story itself. which is so tired and filled with cliches and illogical twists and turns that the audience has a hard time keeping track of it all. 
The film's big gimmick is that it alludes to famous fairy-tales. Among those referenced are "Jack and the Beanstalk," "llansel and Gretel" and "Little Hod Hood." This happens to be the inspiration for tho Grimm brothers' business. However, the screenplay is so sloppy and the visuals so outrageous that the film becomes impossible to play along with.

Much of the effect a film will have comes from expectations set before nnlf1ring the theater. "The Brothers Grimm" is directed by Gilliam, the his­torically thought-provoking director who has helmed such critically­ace 1aim cd projeels as "Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas," "12 Monkeys," and the criminally-underrated "Brazil." Compared to that list, "Grimm" is pndestrian at best. 
lfeadey) and a dangerous plague-ridden Queen (Monica Bellucci) who has taken the lit­tle girls captive in an effort to create an elixir for eternal life. 
Each and every character, save for the awkwardly stoic and serious Headey, has a nervous tic or crazy facial abnormality that makes the entire film feel like something out of a circus sideshow, and the camera never stops moving to the next creepy, gross thing Gilliam feels the need to throw well. 
"The 40 Year Old Virgin" is one of those rare films that is successful at being both a hilarious sex comedy and a sweet romance. It paradoxically alternates between vulgarity and inno­cence. The comedy is perfectly con­structed and delivered, offering the audience a plethora of one-liners and belly-laugh moments. But between the dirty jokes and sexual innuendos, the audience actually eomns to earn about these eharactnrs. 
The bottom linn is that this is a swPnt movie with a good heart. It is onn of the funniest, if not tho funniest, movies of the year.

There are points where "The Brothers Grimm" is popcorn entertain­ment, but again, Gilliam ought to know better. By the umpteenth 'deus ex machina' moment, one starts to hope that this is all one of Johnny Depp's ether-induced dreams from "Fear and Loathing." 
Yet, the film can best be summed up by a particular moment in the film: A cat is (somehow) kieked into a giant whirling blade, at which point the poor feline is shredded into small bits, one of which lands on Pryce's face. lie stands, bemused, picks the little gob of red entrails off of his cheek, and pops it into his mouth.

For the Belles. who lost three highly ell"ective players after last spring, that is a good thing. 
Snniors Nicole Bellino and Megan Mattia have experience working on their side, and have started to earn conference fflcognition on an individual basis. 
But simply in terms of num­bers, the Saint Mary's team is eounting on the freshman class to provide some much-needed depth. 
The five newcomers double the size of the squad, which is made up of four seniors and one sophomore. 
This year's freshmen are Meredith Fantom, Meaghan attracted an 

array of golfers to the team. Sei comes to the Belles from Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Fontein hails from Andover, Mass. 
The good fortune that Saint Mary's has seen in gaining so many good, young players is in part due to a change in the world of women's golf. 
"The overall quality of women's golf is getting better," Hamilton said. "It's a natural ·evolution that these players are better." 
And Hamilton works hard to promote the opportunity that attending a smaller school can provide to young athletes. 
"We talked about how athlet­ics is an important part of col­lege life, and I wanted them to give golf a shot," he said. 
Some prospective recruits may have actually been lost to other schools in the last year, but with the class that they gained, the Belles are not feel­ing the loss. 
Two of this year's freshmen will travel with Saint Mary's to their first competition, which takes place this weekend at Ferris State University. Sei and Mcinerney will join the Belles for what will be their first colle­giate competition, not including quali(ying matches. 
The question remains 
whether  inexperience  will  
become  a  problem for  this  
young team.  

It can only be expected that anyone in the position of Sei and Mcinerney would experience some jitters in their position. 
"It's all about learning what the nerves do to your body, and how to counteract it," Hamilton said. 
The freshmen will be at a slight disadvantage compared to the rest of the team this week­end, as no one on the Belles has ever played the course, and they will not have a practice round. 
And yes, Hamilton said. the freshmen will most likely be nervous. 
But so will the seniors -it just goes with the territory. What remains to be seen is whether this bright, young crowd can maintain their com­posure and fulfill the expecta­tions that lay ahoad of them. 
And for a toam consisting of no members of the junior class and only one sophomore, this year's freshman class will no doubt continue to play a crucial role in the roster in the years to come.

Belles edge Maroons in exhibition n1atch 
By RYAN KIEFER Sporrs Wrirer 

It may have only been a pre­season scrimmage, but the level of intensity on the court at the Angela Athletic Complex Tuesday made it feel like the postseason. 
When the dust settled, the Belles emerged vietorious over the University of Chicago Maroons in live games, 30-26, 28-30,29-31,30-21 and 15-12. 
The Bolles came out firing early, taking leads in each of the first three games. Chicago proved to be a resilient bunch, however, using a 10-3 run in the first game to cut a 19-11 deficit to 22-21 advantage. The Belles hung on to win game one, but were not as fortunate in game two, which fol­lowed a similar pattorn. 
Again, the Maroons put togeth­er a 10-3 run to tie the game at 21 after the Belles had taken an early lead. After losing game two and falling in a see-saw battle in game three, the Belles played their most complete game in the fourth, dominating with crisp passing and timely hitting. 
The final game saw Saint Mary's take an early lead only to see Chicago once again rally to tie the game at 12-12. The Belles won the final three points culmi­nating in junior Kristen Playko's kill to secure the clinching point. 
It was a very productive night for Saint Mary's as coach Julie Schroeder-Hick was able to get all her players into the game. She was addressed the team's lack of depth at the setter position by rotating Amanda David and Michelle Turley in to fill the hole. 
Schroeder-Biek was largely pleased with the resull<>. 
"I thought Amanda played well tonight," the coach said. "We all have confidence in her, now it's just a matter of building her con­fidence. I am proud of both Amanda and Michelle." 
The contest allowed the Belles to get some of their younger play­ers valuable experience in a tight contest before the regular season begins this weekend. The more experienced players had the opportunity to shake early season nerves. 
Schroeder-Hick was thrilled to get this much out of an exhibition contest. 
"It was fun to see some of the first-year players out there," Schroeder-Biek said. "We all had to respond to some jitters when they made runs at us. They arn a solid team and very comparable to us. Tonight proved that we ean finish Ia match]." 
Schroeder-Hick wanted to use this game as a gauge to evaluate her team's strengths and weak­nesses. At the conclusion of the contest, she was able to quickly identify areas that stood out. 
"I thought we passed well which· allowed the setters to run a good oll"ense," she said. "I think there is room for improvement in our blocking and communication at the net." 
The Belles will use the experi­ence gained from tonight's scrim­mage when they travel to subur­ban Chicago this weekend to open the season at the Elmhurst College Invitational.

GHEEN BAY, Wis. ­Green Bay Packers quar­terback Brett Favre spent most of the last two days nervously waiting to hear from famjly members in his hometown of Kiln, Miss., in the heart of the Gulf Coast area devastated by llurrieane Katrina. 
The Packers said Favre finally spoke to his mother, Bonita, late Tuesday after­noon when she was able to reach him with tho help of a Houston television sta­tion in the area covering hurricane damage. 
According to the team, Favre said his mother reported spending Monday night in the family attic, along with his grandmoth­er, after the house filled up with water within a matter of 5-10 minutes, much like a tsunami. 
On Tuesday, the water receded enough that she was able to leave the fami­ly home and go to his brother Jeff's nearby house, which is slightly higher and away from the water. 
Bonita Favre told Brett that Hurricane Camille, which the family experi­enced in 1969, didn't com­pare to this one and the damage it has caused.

The infielder was put on uncondi­tional release waivers by Boston on Friday after he refused to accept a minor league assignment. lie had been designated for assignment on Aug. 19. 
The 31-year-old Bellhorn met with tho press before Tuesday night's game with the Seattle Mariners wearing a Yankoes cap and a Yankees T-shirt. 
"It was kind of weird to look in the mirror the first time I tried my hat on," Bellhorn said with a grin. 
lie was in the lineup at third base batting eighth in place of Alex Hodriguez, who was at designated hitter. Hodriguez came out of Monday night's game with the home is destroyed and probably will have to be bulldozed, but the good news is that everyone in tho family appears to be fine. 
Bonita, Jeff and another brother, Scott, decided against evacuating and instead gathered at Favre's childhood home in Hancock County, one of the areas hit hardest by the hurricane. 
Favre said his grand­mother, aunt and other family members also were there. 
Favre said earlier Tuesday that he spoke to his wife, Deanna, Monday night and again Tuesday. 
morning. lin said she and their two children, 16­year-old Brittany and 6­year-old Breleigh, are saf'n at Favre's home in Hattiesburg, 60 miles north of' Kiln, although their property had extnn­sive damage. 
Favre's mother was sevnn months pregnant with him when II urrieann Camille, which killnd 256 people in Louisiana and Mississippi in 19(>9, struck the aroa. 
"I've seen pictures," Favre said. 
Favre said the f'aet his family waited out Camille likely factored into their deeision.

SAN FHANCISCO The Washington Nationals and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim both made trades with the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday to strengthen their rosters for the stretch drive. 
The Nationals attempted to bolster their struggling offense, acquiring shortstop Deivi Cruz for minor league pitcher Ben Cox. 
Tho Angels picked up lel'thanded reliever Jason Christiansen for minor league pitchers Dusty Bergman and Honnie Hay. 
Cruz was batting .268 with five hmmws and 19 RBI in 81 games with San Francisco this year.

Trojan offense ready for big year 
Carroll expects an even more potent attack 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES -Here's a scary thought for the college football world: Southern California coach Pete Carroll believes the Trojans will be improved on offense. 
That's difficult to fathom, considering USC scored seven touchdowns and rolled up 525 yards in overpowering previ­ously unbeaten Oklahoma 55­19 in the Orange Bowl in January to secure its second straight national champi­onship. 
The Trojans, who open the season Saturday at Hawaii, have fielded one of the coun­try's top offenses each of the past three years, averaging :38.2 points in going 13-0 last season; 41.1 points in going 12-1 two years ago, and 35.8 points in going 11-2 in 2002. 
Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Matt Leinart returns along with USC's five leading rushers and four top receivers. 
Little wonder Carroll feels the way he does. 
"This is the best group we've had based on the experience and the big production from the receivers and the running backs and, of course, the quar­terback," Carroll said Tuesday. "I think the continuity is very special. We have Matt at the helm, and the offensive line intact." 
Among the other returnees 
are Heisman finalist Reggie Bush and LenDale White, a potent 1-2 punch at tailback; wide receivers Steve Smith and Dwayne Jarrett; and tight end Dominique Byrd. 
"They might be the best offensive team I've seen physi­cally," Hawaii coach June Jones said on a con.ference call. 
Center Ryan Kalil said he has no doubt the USC offense will be improved. 
"Especially in the run game," Kalil said. "I think we're going to do a better job of coming out earlier. We're definitely a fin­ishing team. We're a lot more confident offense than last year, a lot more experienced offense." 
Kalil is one of four returning starters in the offensive line from last year. Right tackle Winston Justice was a first­stringer in 2002-03 before sit­ting out last season because of a student conduct violation. 
"I think I'm a lot better as a player," Justice said. "The whole offensive line has improved as a unit. I agree with the center -the offense might be better. I think the sky is the limit."

Either way, he was not anx­ious going into the event. 
"Not too nervous," Is ban said. "Playing last year was a good experience. 
"In general, I kind ol' drew a bad draw with the weather last year. I didn't play as well as I Iwould have I liked to. Things can kinda elick or they don't." 
Unfortunately, things did not click this year for the three Irish golfers, either. lsban, Deutsch and Peckels did not advance far. 
Regardless, it was a major

son, finishing the season ranked No.5. 
The twins put together a 28-7 record in dual and open meets for 2004-05, placing them at 50-24 over their two-year career. The Intercollegiate Tennis Association awarded the sisters the prestigious All­American label for finishing in the top ten of the ITA final dou­bles rankings and gaining a berth in the NCAA doubles championship. 
"It was exciting," Christian said. "We had a great year and played really well before strug­gling at the end. When we found out, we called our parents, our coach from back home, our friends. It was shocking at first." 
The Thompsons were not born with a racket in hand. Neither parent played the game, so the twins didn't get their first experience until they attended a free clinic down the road from their home in Las Vegas. The coach of the clinic recognized the talent inside of the pair and began to work with them. 
They started playing competi­tively around the age of eight in local tournaments before mov­ing on to circuit and sectional tournaments in the Nevada region. Their mixed style domi­nated all opponents, and by the time they were 12, it was on to the national level. 
"We qualified for the Challenge Cup at 12, it was the nationals for our age," Christian said. "Every age group after that, under-14's, under-16's, 
under-18's we went to the nationa1s. We won seven nation­al doubles titles." 
Irish coach Jay Louderback watched their reputation and records grow. He observed all the national titles and was impressed with their natural ability. 
Madia 
continued from page 24 
"She had the potential, we knew that, but [success] was not going to be instantaneous," Connelly said. 
Madia had to grow into the col­lege running scene. Throughout four years of hard work and deter­mination, Madia now finds herself as a nationally recognized long distance talent. She credits her development to her teammates and coaches. 
"When I got here, I was sur­rounded by better people like Lauren [King] and Molly [Huddle]," Madia said. 'Teammates are so motivating. They just pulled me along to perform at a higher level. Coach Connelly has always believed in me, as well." 
Though Madia is quick to credit others for her achievements, dis­tance running requires internal motivation. Madia has proven capable of setting lofty goals for herself and then putting in the necessary time to make dreams become reality. She takes great pride in her work ethic and the results it produces. 
"Running is so rewarding, most people don't realize that," Madia said. "It's something where if you put in the time and dedication, results will come." 
It's that philosophy that has drawn Madia to running and has caught the attention of teammates who try to emulate her desire to win. 
"She has been a leader since she got here," Connelly said. "When 
"A big thing with them was their athletic ability -even at 16 it was amazing to see what good athletes they were," Louderback said. 
When the time came to move to the collegiate level, the sis­ters were more than ready -as was Louderback -to make sure they would don the blue and gold. He made a house visit and caught their interest. An older cousin that previously attended Notre Dame influ­enced their decision, along with a visit where they fell in love with campus and the team. 
The rest is history, but a lot more will be made in the next two years as the twins now have the experience needed to excel at the collegiate level, in addition to the natural connec­tion the two share when it comes to playing on the same court. 
"They have played together for so long, they know exactly what each other will do," Louderback said. 
That innate ability, which many doubles pairings do not possess, is clearly a step up on the competition, and Catrina and Christian have put in the effort to make sure that strength is utilized. 
"We have been practicing hard," Christian said. "We came back to school for the summer and did a lot of work with our trainer. So far, we have been trying to hit twice a day, and it's really working out." 
Although there have been brief spells where the twins have been forced to play with a different partner -Christian missed several matches in '04 with knee problems -they wish to continue their domi­nance together. 
"When Catrina hits the ball, I know what she is going to do, so I can position myself and be in the right spot for the ball," Christian said.

[seven-time all-American] Molly [Huddle] went down [with a foot injury)last year, Stephanie was the one to take the responsibility and step up and get it done." 
It was Madia who trained with then-freshman Sunni Olding last year and was critical in her devel­opment into a long distance force. Olding finished 32nd at the NCAAs last fall. Madia downplayed her leadership role, choosing instead to focus on the team. 
"[Leading]'s a way to give back to the team," Madia said. "But everyone has a responsibility to be a leader. There's no competition among teammates, just striving to make the team the best it can be." 
With Madia and a healthy Molly Huddle, expectations are for the team to at least match their per­formance from last year. Both Connelly and Madia cited the importance of staying healthy throughout the season so that they can be confident entering the NCAAs. 
"No one has higher expectations than the team itself," he said. 
Madia reflected the coach's words when she offered her opin­ion on the team's potential. 
"We want to be the best in the Big East and one of the best in the country," Madia said. "Everyone's looking good right now. It's infec­tious." 
Are these expectations realistic when the Irish lost two of their top seven runners to graduation? 
"No goal is out of reach," Madia said.

FOOTBALL 
Line dance 
Rotating offensive linemen provide Irish with depth 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Editor 
There isn't much Bob Morton wouldn't do for Dan Stevenson. After three years together as teammates on the Notre Dame offensive line, they've formed quite a bond. 
"I told him the other day, 'You know, Dan, I think I may only like you about 50 percent of the time and 50 percent of that time is when we're on the football field together," said the Irish center. "But I also told him that if we're ever in a life or death situa­tion, I'd be there for him. And if he was hanging off a cliff, I'd do everything in my power to make sure he didn't fall." 
Having all five starters from last season returning forges relationships like the one between Morton and Stevenson. The unity also gives the Irish a solid base around which coach Charlie Weis hopes to create a potent offensive attack. 
Left tackle Ryan Harris believes the line is ready for 
-the task of making sure the offense runs smoothly begin­ning Saturday at Pittsburgh. "I think offensive linemen kind of want that burden to kind of get things going," Harris said. "We want that opportunity, and we'd love 
that responsibility." 
John Sullivan is the fourth man in a four-man group rotating between center and the two guard slots. Morton, Stevenson and Dan· Santucci are the other members of the foursome, and Sullivan is con­fident they will start the sea­son in a positive way. 
"I feel like we're going to have a really, really good unit," Sullivan said. "I just think there are a lot of smart players on the 0-line, a lot of older guys now. I think that makes a huge difference." 
Though the starting unit is one of the more experienced groups on the Irish squad, offensive line coach John Latina's focus is to make sure his players keep improving every day. 
"The biggest thing to me is I think we're better today than we were two days ago, three days ago," Latina said. "The bottom line is until you go out and play a game, you really don't know where you are in terms of how well you're playing. The big test is com­ing Saturday." 
He also stressed that though the lineman have been start­ing together for at least a full season, everyone from the freshmen to the seniors are all equal in the new offense.

ND WOMEN'S TENNIS 
Thompson twins dominate 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 

One delivers the ball with a tremendous forehand and dev­astating serve. The other sets the pace with consistent shot selection and a cool-under­pressure attitude. Separate they are strong, but when ·put together, they create one of the most formidable women's colle­giate doubles pairs in the nation. 
Catrina Thompson carries the killer instinct, while Christian Thompson forces her opponent to make the mistake. The two Irish women's tennis players used both styles of play to earn All-American honors last year as sophomores and garner a No. 1 doubles ranking mid-sea­

MEN'S GOLF 

Irish trio competes at tough tournament 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Associate Spons Editor 

Three members of the Notre Dame golf team had the opportunity to play on the biggest stage for college golf when they were invited to the U.S. Amateur Championship on Aug. 22 and 23 in Ardmore, Penn. at 
the Merion Golf Club. 

Eric Deutsch, Eddie Peckels and Cole Isban all represent­ed the Irish when they com­peted against the top ama­teur players in the country, something that was not only good for their confidence going into the season, but also for thn Notre Dame pro­gram as a whole. 
"It's beneficial for the pro­gram," lsban said before the event, referring to-the expo­sure that having three golfers in such an event gives to a university. "[Playing the 
U.S. Amateur[ is a step in the right direction." 
For a school that has been known for football, and recently, the women's soccer national champions, anything that brings attention to the golf' program is good. 
This was not the first year that lsban, who is a two-time All-Big East selection and a 2005 Ping All-Midwest region selection, had been invited to play in this tournament. 
lsban competed in the 2004
