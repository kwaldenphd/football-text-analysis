Resolution hits unmerger 
SMC AAUP 
to vote today 
by A.T. Darin 
The St. Mary's chapter of the American Association of University Professors <AAUPl will begin voting today on a resolution denouncing SMC's "abundance" of community government in the recent merger decision reversal. 
The AAUP will consider four resolutions concerning the merger postponement. 
The thirty-five members will have a 24-hour deadline, said Dr. Donald Hornung, AAUP president, to return their ballots to the AAUP Executive Committee. 
With twenty-five members present at a meeting Monday night, the campus chapter approved in general the four resolutions, by a voice vote. 
Requests negotiations 
As written by the Executive Board: Hornung, Sr. Franzita Kane, Stephen McNally and Sr. Rosaleen Dunleavy, last Sunday the first resolution urgently requests merger negotiations between SMC and ND be resumed, with faculty and student representation on the committees. 
The second resolution comends the student body of St. Mary's College for its forthright. decisive and responsible protest of the recent actions of the Board of Trustees." 
In addition, the AAUP would resolve to lend its support and commends the student government leaders of St. Mary's College for their forthright, decisive and responsible leadership in at­tempting to effect constructive change aimed at reestablishing the concept of shared governance of the academic community. 
Sleep-in draws 100; petition gains support 
by Jim Roe Anti merger orga~zers drew one hundred people for last night's sleep in and teach-in in La Fortune Student Center_ Noticably absent at press time were ND student body president, John Barkett, and ND student body vice-president, Orlando Rodrigues. A petition asking for a "re-evaluation of the recent decision to reverse the merger of Notre Dame and St. Mary's" highlighted the early portion of the meeting_ The petition, which was signed by a majority of the students present, will be presented at the Dining halls tonight, according to Don Mooney, who orgainized the demonstration. It said in part that "members of both communities have been done serious injustice," and that "this decision was made unilaterally by the Boards of Trustees violates the avowed respect for the opinions of all members of the community...in the decision-making pricess." "The present secrecy regarding the reasons for the decision is an insult to students and faculty of both com­munities ... " continued the petition. The petition demanded that "negotiation will resume in January 1972:: "and that students and faculty be accepted as members of the ad hoc committee con­vened for making final decisions in such negotiations, with representation equal to that of the trustees and administrators." 

SMC girls comprised only a fourth of the crowd despite extended hours for fresh­men that St. Mary's student body president Kathy Barlow issued. 
The meeting was "sharing of frustration," according to assistant dean of students, Robert Ackerman. He con­tended that it was "hard to rally around a cause you couldn't define." 
The teach-in itself was designed to "educate teh Notre Dame student as to how the unmerger is very disadvantagous to the life at ND both academically and socially," according to SMC student assembly representative, Jim Clarke. 
Mooney said that he felr the sleep-in would "basically test" the Notre Dame administration. It was a opportunity for ND students to show some sort of reaction ­-pro or con.""lt showed that the Notre Dame student is concerned," contended Mooney. 
Eric Andrus, the event's other organizer, called the meeting a "show of force ... designed to place pressure on the ND administration." 
"Re-negotiation won't be opened without 
pressure from this side," Andrus con­
tinued. 
Neither Mooney nor Andrus have any 
future plans or long term prganization, 
and expressed the hope that "Student 
Government would carry the ball."

Frosh write protest letter 
The Freshman Council, last night, decided to send an official class letter to Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, the ND administration and the ND Trustees. The letter, according to Dave Yates, the Freshman Class president, is to "explain freshman dissatisfaction with the confusion of the unmerger." 
Kathy Barlow, SMC student body president, addressed the meeting of the Freshman Class Officers and their advisory ;committee. She explained some of the facts and the implications behind the recent decision to suspend the ND-8MC merger. 
The class letter will be cir­culated in the Freshman classrooms Friday. Yates said, "We urge all freshman to read all the information we will pass out and si~n the letter in class Friday." 
"We want our class to express its dissatisfaction and concern. We are the most affected by the decisions being made," said Sue Schneider, freshman class secretary. The officers said that they were not going to demand the reversal of the decision. 
The council will distribute the information about the merger in the residence halls Thursday night:

SMC students plan Christmas action 

by Joseph Abell 
:St. Mary's :S.I::W Kathy Harlow last night revealed that she has made "no definite plans" for student action during Christmas vacation. However, she added, many suggestions have been made, concerning possible ac­tion. 
"We haven't had uor meetings yet," she said of the committee formed to determine what action is to be taken, "but many proposals have been brought up." 

"The main thing we're going to concentrate on is to get the girls to talk to their parents," Miss Barlow stressed. The principle area they wanted covered, she said, is the tuition witholding action. 
Darlene Galena, St. Mary's Student Government Public Relations Commissioner, af­firmed this stand. "We want to give the girls something to do over Christmas, and the best thing we can do is get them to talk to their parents and get them to withold the tuition," she said.

The conference also en­couraged a writing campaign directed at the President, Senators, and Congressmen. They advocate reinstituting aid India, recognizing the in­dependent nation of Bengla Desh, and severely sanctioning the government of Pakistan for killing one and a half million people and making 10 million pt..-ople homeless. 

Hamilton said that "the President has not only erred in the position he takes but is cheating the American people and the people of Asia that are entitled to freedom." 
He cited as proof of this statement the "fact that instead of supporting a democracy of 550 million people in India, and 76 million in Bengla Desh, the United States is supporting a dictatorship under Yahya Khan."

Another course of action, Miss Galena mentioned, would be to write personal letters to the in­dividual members of the Board of Trustees. 
"We have a few specific things we want to ask them," she asserted, "like their actual amount of participation in the Board's decision (on the merger)." 

Missy Underman, SMC student body vice-president, listed alternative actions that have been suggested, so far. A meeting should be held to "get together," she said,just before the Christ­
break. Announcements of fina decisions for courses of actim over vacation would be made a this time. So far, thre1 suggestions have been made: ---a program of letter-writin~ to contact the St. Mary's alumni to gain their support on thE various measures. ---a few students havE volunteered to stay in South Bend over the entire Christmas 
vacation to do research and other related activities on the mergerproblems. 
---members of the St. Mary's student governemtn should talk to various members of the Board of Trustees either at their scheduled meeting on December 18, or at an emergency meeting th~y are attempting to or~anize, pnor to the regular meetmg. At the present time, any action is pending on confirmation of the emergency meeting of the Board of Trustees, said Miss Un­derman, but plans have been made concerning this meeting and the regular one. 
"What we want to get is equal representation from students and faculty at the meeting," she said. "We also want them to be able to sit in on the Board's meetings and comment, not just say some little speech at the beginning and leave." 
Miss Underman was confident of the possibility of swinging over some of the Board members. 
"The Board is dividied into two main groups," she pointed out, "on the one hand is the Holy Cross sisters, and on the other is regular businessmen, 
"We hope to impress the businessmen, from a financial aspect, about the undesirabilty of

dropping the merger," she ad­ded. She also expressed con­fidence concerning talks with individual Board members, especially the members who had not been actively involved in the suspension of the merger. 
Hopes for favorable action from the Board have been ex­pressed by St. Mary's Student Affairs Commissopner Jane .. Seymour. 
"I don't think they'd (the Board) dare dismiss it," she said of the proposal to allow students and faculty to sit in on the Board's meeting. "I don't think they'll deny the students at­tendance." 
Opinions concerning the effect the Christmas break will have on enthusiasm about the merger decision were unanimously op­timistic. 
"I don't think the enthusiasm will die out," commented Miss Barlow. 
"The girls will come back from vacation and will probably feel the same way," Miss Gallina said. "We have to hope that these people are so determined they will feel the same way." 
Miss Seymour remarked, hope that the enthusiasm will not disappear, but it's hard to tell; I don't think they'll forget about it." 
"The kids are involved enough in this so they won't forget about it," Miss Underman said. "Over any period of time, some en­thusiasm is bound to be lost, but I don't think that much will be lost here."

Everyday Christmas

Christmas as usual. The walls and floor of the streets wet and cold like a goat's coat. South Bend decked in artificial green; a decorator's nightmare. India packed with Pakistani refugees; wins U.S. condemnation and a bucketful of threats. Here at the Notre Dame-St. Mary's community, a string of broken promises sweetened by official and unofficial lies and silences. 
The really great thing about Christmas is that it gives you time to reflect on your blessings. If it's not easy to be of good will, it's easy to fake good will. Nobody investigates too closely this time of year. 
During the month of prepackaged joy and good ol' Christmas syrup, it might be provident to consider the foolwing things: 
That these two campuses have been the showplace for national Catholic dishonesty over the past two weeks. That most of the four hundred St. Mary's freshmen will be denied the Notre Dame degree they were promised. That the real reasons for the unmerger are all shrouded in the grim smiling secrecy the C.S.C's have adopted instead of Christianity. 
Furthermore, that nine -tenths of the students at Notre Dame don't really care, because the move dosen't effect them. 
More things to consider: 
That the west Pakistan tyrant, Yahya Kahn, overturned his country's own freely -elected government in order to march on the people of Bangia Dosh. That the resultant bloodshed turned -millions of East Pakistani refugees into temporary homesteaders in India, and as a result India has joined battle agaisnt Kahn's military forces. That as a result of that move, the United States has condemned India and cut off aid. 
Furthermore, that nine-tenths of the Notre Dame student 
Body doesn't care enough to register to vote, since that move· 
and similar moves won't directly effect them.

When We Separate 
-----------John Abowd 
It's very hard to explain the kind of metamorphasis that has occurred this week. It amounts to a confession that after many hours of theoretical considerations about sex roles in society and sex roles in our college community, I still can't recognize the basic problem until someone takes the time to point out the charac­teristics of a real situation one by one. That's exactly what hap­pened this week. 
The question that brought on the great onslaught was innocent enough: "What can I do to help you?" Innocent enough, that is, unless you happen to ask it in the St. Mary's student government office. 
"That's exactly the point," Kathy Barlow said, "You think that the whole loss is on our side of the road and that's where you're wrong. If you don't feel any personal loss then you've just been duped into believing what Notre Dame wants you to believe: that the kind of tokenism that 300 ND co-eds represents is an adequate solution to the problem." 
For the next seven hours five very busy women, some of whom had not slept for several days, all of whom azre going to flunk a couple of classes because of their total devotion to what they are doing, took the time while they were planning this wees action to help me understand the kind of crass attitude that I had inadvertantly displayed when I asked that "innocent" question. 
For several years now Notre Dame and St. Mary's have been one academic community. The technicalities of degree source and dormitory location while they are very important, only mask the fact that if we tolerate the latest attempt to impede the develop­ment of that community we are not talking about a future loss but about an immediate loss for both Notre Dame and St. Mary's students. 
A segregated portion of our community, the women at St. Mary's, has been cut off. We have been deprived of the complete educational experience that a normal coeducational environment can provide. This is an immediate deprivation. The women at St. Mary's are an integral part of this campus. Ifwe think that the kind of contribution that could be made to the total community by SMC students can be replaced by retreating to an isolated Notre Dame, coed or all male, we are denying all that modern learning theory can contribute to our education. Allowing any portion of our community to deteriorate, whether it is the College of Science or the independence of individual residence halls, means that we narrow the perspectives on life and the individual insights which are all we have to give the formalness of a University education any kind of meaning in the real world. 
The question of who is at fault in the current controversy is im­portant as a study of power politics in a closed community. But it is not as important as the educational loss that each of us suffers by refusing to realize that our own chances to discover the relationship of our education to our life have been limited by the decision to cut off St. Mary's no matter who made it. 
It's hard to capture the kind of deep personal hurt I felt in those girls as they talked with me. It's even harder to communicate, even at the risk of sounding trite, the kind of thanks I have that they felt concerned enough for my own education to take the time to reach me. It is a Christmas gift that will live beyond all the physical presents anyone could deliver. A gift of understanding.

Sunday evening <December 5th) to tell me the news: 
Tom's application to be classified as a conscientious 
objector has been turned down by the State Appeals 
Board. In the eyes of just men, Tom does not qualify as 
a pacifist; the ways in which he is opposed in con­
science to military service are not sufficient grounds to 
exempt him from induction. His mother said, "They 
don't believe Tom will go to jail for his beliefs; but I 
know he will go to jail rather than serve." Merry 
Christmas, Mother! And to you, too, Mrs. Calley, and 
may all your Christmases be bright. 
In dealing with his Local Board, Tom was turned 
down after three appeals on the grounds that, as a 
Catholic, he does not belong to a sect like the Quakers 
that is traditionally opposed to war. In the ghetto days 
of Catholicism, before Roncalli became Pope and 
Kennedy became President, we Catholics had to 
establish our credentials as super-patriots, and 
therefore as super-warriors. Everyone in the ghetto, 
fearing the accusation that being loyal to Rome in­
volved disloyalty to Washington, was grateful for the 
fervor of the Catholic War Veterans; to Fr. Duffy and 
the Fighting Sixty-Ninth; to the Sullivan Brothers who 
perished together on the same fighting ship in an early 
battle of World War II; to Lieutenant Commander 
O'Callahan, the Jesuit mathematician from Holy Cross 
College, who died in action on an aircraft carrier (I 
believe) in the performance of his duties as chaplain. I 
have no desire to snipe at these heroes -at one, in 
sacrifice, with the Lord -but I do regret the films, 
based on their experiences, in which Catholics, lending 
themselves as part of the propaganda of the war effort 
in the Forties, were seen to move rather easily from 
the altar rail to the battlefield, shouting en­
couragements to praise the Lord and pass the am­
munition. I regret Cardinal Spellman, dressed in 
battle fatigues, fluttering about the fighting zones like 
Christ come to the foxholes, whree G.I.'s were serving 
on the altars of God, with grenades as their Blessed 
Sacrament. 

But if Spellman were right: if Christ wears a green 
beret, then He must wear other uniforms, too; and all 
armies must be His army-in Russia, Nazi Germany, 
North Vietnam -and wherever else men suppose they 
are fighting for the glory of their country and the 
welfare of their families. But if, on the battlefield, all

Inquisitor. Two thousand years ofChrisffiuiity and1Wo hundred years of flag-wavingCatholicism have come to this: that in the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and of the tragedies of World Wars I and II and Korea, in these months while the Vietnam ~ar still rages, a Catholic boy, a graduate of a Christian University and twelve years of parochial school education, faces prison. His crime: he sees missile systems and armies and bombardments and killings as crimes against humanity. As a Catholic, nobody believes him, because he does not belong to a religious sect like the Quakers who are traditionally opposed to war. 
Because at this point I have failed to help Tom enough --and because it is Christmas--I think of the children with whom, at the Urchins' Mass every week, · I celebrate the Liturgy. We reveal God to one another, these children and I. In them, I see the beauty of Christ --not as innocent as He, for they are without sin, but not without selfishness. In their near-innocence, they suffer, knowing loneliness, pain, rejection. Soon enough they will be scarred in their minds and bodies by the ancient illnesses that flesh is heir to. 
A traditional symbol of salvation is the sign of the Blood of the Lamb. It was the Sign of the Blood that delivered the Jews from death, when God passed over the land of Egypt prior to the Exdous, striking down the first-born children among the families that were ruled by Pharoh. Once I placed a drop of consecrated 
wine --the Blood of God's Lamb--on the tongue of a newly-baptized infant, as a sign to God to spare the child from suffering and death. The sacrament was administered as a prayer for peace, so that this child, and others like him, might be spared the destiny of a soldier in Vietnam, or as suffering servant of peace claimed by an American prison. 
In a world without hiding places, it is silly to teach children a religion that is all soda pop and cotton candy. In our liturgies, we move from Christmas to Good Friday, to Easter, and now back to Christmas again. Sometimes, it seems we have made a long journey from April to December. But the Bethlehem mood of the children is the one I like best, for they are constantly in the mood to celebrate. That is why they dance their prayers, or fly kites on the Quad to learn the lessons of the wind <At Pentecost, remember, the Spirit came "like a powerful wind from heaven"). That is why they assemble before the patch that is awaiting 

rchin 
the arrival of the Great Pumpkin: to playfully honor the Lord of the pumpkins and the harvest, Who plays His own game of trick or treat. 
On Sunday, December 13th, at eleven o'clock in the Keenan-Stanford Chapel, the children will be celebrating the joyous feast of Christmas, when God came to Urchinsville and dwelt in our playground. In the churches of the Establishment, which do not take a pause for Christmas vacation as we do in the Family Chapel, the antiphons and Scripture readings will still be prophetic, in anticipation of Messiah's birth. In the churches of the Protestant Establishment, Billy Graham also awaits the coming of Christ, but it is His Second Coming, the eschatalogical event when the world, hopeless with sin, will face its judgment and destruction. 
I acknowledge with joy the news that Christ came to Bethlehem, wearing our flesh like glory-vestments as the Celebrant of eternal life. But I don't think He will come again as Arthur from Avalon, or Roland sum­moned by the silver notes of the golden trumpet of Roncesvalles, to rescue the Kingdom from the Dark Lord of evil pretensions. He won't come, because He doesn't need to. He was once tucked into the manger of Bethlehem, not so much to found a kingdom, as to plant a vineyard. "I am the vine, you are the branches." Now His beauty is never far from us and His face is never hidden. His strength, as grace, is constantly fed to us, like life flowing from a root to open up in blossoms. He is revealed to us best in the laughter of children. 
The world is always Bethlehem ... Christ newly born, God with us. But it is always Calvary, too where holiness suffers on a tree of shame. Wherever soldiers die, there is Calvary ... Vietnam, Antietam, San Juan Hill, Pork Chop Hill, Belleau Wood. But it is happening also on the battlefields of peace, to people like the Berrigans, and their friends from Catonsville, Milwaukee, Harrisburg, and even to the gentle lad, Tom, who is not a Quaker. 
If the urchins celebrating Bethlehem could be spared crucifixion.. .if in their generation, we could, just once, spare Christ from His agony, then the times and seasons might be redeemed as though by an eschatalogical event, like a Second Coming of the Lord. 
But maybe in vineyards, there is no life without pruning. Maybe crucifixions are mandatory, in the Kingdom of the Lonely God. Merry Christmas. May all your Eastertides be

Barlow: Unity is 'progress' 
by Bob Cosentino 
No matter how the merger issue is resolved, St. Mary's SBP, Kathy Barlow, is confident that the recent protest at SMC has gained "considerable progress" articulating student opinion. 
Miss Barlow said that if nothing else has been achieved by the protest of the SMC women, at least the girls themselves have felt "the unification that comes from banding together to achieve a common goal." 
"I think our protests have obtained considerable progress " Miss Barlow commented. "Of course, we've received no official word that the trustees have budged in their position to call off the merger. However, there has been a considerable change in the girls, themselves. Thev are starting to realize they want to run their own lives. They're realizing that they want to be women. 
"Also," Miss Barlow con­tinued, "the girls are realizing that if this education is not what they want, then they will go elsewhere. It's not a love it or leave it viewpoint. It's just that they want to be who they are. They're realizing how much more important the people are in~tead of the in~titution, and I thmk that's very Important." 

Kathy Barlow 
Miss Barlow contended that "although all the AMC protest revolves around the merger issue, my personal goal is that the women learn to understand and relate to each other." It is in this respect that she is convinced the girls have succeeded. "The merger protest is one way which we can take what we want and put it into political action," she commented. 
According to Miss Barlow, the next step for the SMC women is to circulate the petition to the students which states the SMC demands of the Notre Dame and St. Mary's trustees. The demands first forwarded are that the negotiations for merger between Notre Dame and St. Mary's resume in January 1972; 

Statement by ND-SMC Ministries on merger 
The recent breakdown of negotiations for the unification of 
St. Mary's and Notre Dame has caused serious repercussions 
in the lives of many persons. The Campus Ministries of both 
institutions are concerned for the well-being of those whose 
lives have been so disrupted and whose trust is severely 
shaken. The honesty, integrity, and dedication to genuine 
Christian values on the part of our institutions are at stake. 
Legitimate questions must be answered, responses heard, 
adn proposals entertained. 

We ask, therefore, that each individual and every segment 
of the St. Mary's-Notre Dame community examine its con­
science. Further, we urge all parties to assess their capacities to act and their willingness to bring about an acceptable resolution or this crisis. The Campus Ministries believe that steps should be taken im­mediately to reopen negotiations between the two institutions so that the primary source of frustration and disillusionment can be removed.

and that students and faculty have a voice in making final decisions in the negotiations. 
SMC Student Affairs Com­missioner Jean Seymour urged students to put pressure on the trustees by writing letters and asking parents, alumni and other influential people to try to put pressure on the two schools. 
Miss Barlow also said that student government has asked SMC women to withold tuitions for next semester as part of the protest. Barlow estimated that about 600 girls at St. Mary's have already requested transfers. 
"I think we've shocked a lot of people from our demands," Miss Barlow said. "They've seen our strength and I'm confident they'll listen to us. 
"You see, we're not asking them to renew negotiations we're asking them to start negotiations," she commented. "We don't think that any real negotiations have ever taken place. Our ultimate goal is to give the students, faculty, ad­ministration add trustees a chance to make a bet~er decision."

No ''wedding" 
Editor: It seems that Rev. Hesburgh thought he could win a large dowery by "wedding" Mother Olivette, whereas Mother Olivette hoped to find a rich "husband" who was going to support her in the amnner in which she was accustomed. Hence the broken engagement.

Editor, 
Even though I am not per­sonally a student at Notre Dame University, I feel I have a stake in what transpires there. I have many close friends attending both Notre Dame and St. Mary's. For this reason I am emotionally tied to this present situation. 
From what I understand, the administraiton of St. Mary's has attempted to affect the lives of their so-called community without even considering the community itself. Has not authority realized that within its bounds of jurisdiction there are also responsibilities that they (authority) MUST meet with, concerning the lives of the

Dacca airport bombed 
by James P. Sterba 
Dacca, Pakistan--Indian jet fighters strafed and bombed Dacca airfield Monday while several dozen women and children were waiting for a United Nations plane to evacuate them to Bangkok, officials here siad. None of the evacuees were reported hurt in the attacks. 
The Indian jets made two strafing and rocket-firing runs over the East Pakistan airfield shortly before 10 a.m. U.N. of­ficials here said that the Indians had agreed to halt the raias until noon to allow evacuation aircraft in. One plane turned around and flew back to Bangkok. 
U.N. officials said shortly after 1 p.m. that Indian warplanes struck the airport again, this time dropping two bombs on the runway, blasting out a large crater that Pakistani ground crewmen operating a bulldozer began to fill immediately. 
Meeanwhile, a high-ranking West Pakistan-army general said at a news conference here that seven Indian divisions had pushed 30 miles into East Pakistan and that Indian war­ships had set up a blockade in the Bay of Bengal. He said that his forces, numbering about 80,000 troops, were completely cut off from the West. 
"We will fight on," said the officer, Major General Farman Ali Khan. who is the militHrv adviser to the governor in East_ Pakistan.

Half of E. Pakistan falls 
Indians take 2 cities 
by Sydney H. Schanberg 
<C> 1971 New York Times 
Calcutta, Dec. 7-The Indian Army reported a victory in Jessore tonight that virtually insured it of control of about half of East Pakistan, and the army chief immediately issued a call to the Pakistani forces in the country to surrender to save their lives. 
With Indian forces pushing in from all sides toward the center of the country, slowly tightening a noose around the retreating Pakistanis, the army's eastern command reported tonight that Jessore, the military lynchpin of the western half of East Pakistan, had been taken in a fierce 24-hour battle and that its Pakistani defenders--estimated before the battle at about 5,000 men--were fleeing in disarray to the south. 
The command also reported that Sylhet, in the northeast, had 
been captured and that Comilla, in the east, had been "completely surrounded"--both strategic cities. The three main Pakistani military bases in East Pakistan were at Jessore, Comilla and Dacca, the capital. Dacca, in the heart of the country, is clearly the Indians next major target, but there are literally many rivers to cross to get there in that low-lying watery country and it would take some days. 
At about 6:30p.m. tonight, just after Jessore had fallen to the Indians, the army chief of satff, Gen. Sam H. F. J. Manekshaw, issued a message to be broadcast to the 70,000 Pakistani troops in East Pakistan, in which he said: "Officers and Jawans of the Pakistan Army, lay down your arms before it is too late. Time is running out. Indian forces have encircled you. Your fate is sealed."
