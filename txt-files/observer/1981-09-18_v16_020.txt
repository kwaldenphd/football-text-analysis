GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) 
President  Reagan  arrived  in  
Gerald  R. Ford's  hometown  
yesterday  to  roast  the  White  

House years of his onetime Republican rival and attempt to patch America's relations with rwo other honored guests, the leaders of Canada and Mexico. 
Reagan arrived in Grand Rapids at 2:30 p.m. EDT and was greeted by Ford, who visited with him briefly on Air Force One. 
The rwo men emerged from the aircraft side by side.. As Reagan turned toward Ford, he began to stumble at the door­way but caught his balance before falling. 
Reagan planned to meet separately with Canadian Pnme Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and Mexican Pres­ident Jose LoJ?ez Portillo to discuss a vanety of issues which have come to trouble the friendship of North American Neighbors. 
From Reagan's point of view, they include Canada's new energy policy, aimed at giving her own companies greater control over her oil and gas resoureces, and Mexico's sup­port for leftist rebels in El Salvador. 
The three leaders along with former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and J apenese Foreign Minister Sunao Sunoda, will attend the dedication of the Ford pres­idential museum today. 
White House aides tried to play down the international aspects of the journey, stres­sing instead it's ceremonial nature. 
At Saint Mary 's 

"It is important ro remember the occasion of the visit to Grand Rapids is the opening of the museum,'' said one official.' 'The intention -here is not to hold summit meetings of any type.'' 
Still, this official, who asked not to be indentified, said traditionally close U.S. ties with Canada were facing ''very diff1cult, some would say in­tractable, problems." 
"Our interest is in making progress," he said. "It just doesn't come as rapidly as some would like.'' 
Since he has become pres­ident, Reagan has made a point of stressing his intention to pay closer attention to the nation's North American neighbors. He has met several times previously with Trudeau 
and Lopez Portillo. As the instructor detat!s the route to be taken But all has not been going around Saint Mary's Lake, the junior-year ROTC members stare incredulously at the

0-C Board serves as messenger 
By MARK WORSHEH News Staff 
Moving off campus for most students means getting away from the constraints of dorm rules and regulations. Unfortu­nately, students usually sacrif­ice dorm s~irit and most on­campus mail in exchange for their independence. 
Senior Kathleen Engler, off­campus commissioner at Saint 

FRIDAY 
FOCUS 
Mary's, believes that students 

do  not  have  to  make  such  
sacrifices.  
Engler  has formed  an  Off-,  

Campus Board designed to pass along information as well as to plan special off-campus events for the 85 o-c students at SMC. 
Though she admits that the focus of the board is "mainly social,'' Engler recognizes the need for the Board to act as a messenger. 
Mary Anne O'Donnell, direc­tor of student affairs at SMC, also expressed support for the Board, calling it "a very effective means of getting communication out.'' 
''I'm really impressed with the organization that Kathleen has done," O'Donnell added. 
Preliminary organization has proven to be more an obstacle than Engler had anticipated. A list of those living off campus was not available early in the year, so Engler had to put a list together herself. While stress­ing that the Offices of Student Affairs and Residence Life have been very helpful, she does not '' think that 1t is the students' responsibility to do this son of filing.'' 
''I would think that one of the people existing in Student Affairs could take this on.'' said Engler. 

Mmnie Owens, SMC housing coordinator, said that a separ­ate o-c listing is not available now, but will be within the next few weeks. Computer delays and a high number of correct­ions have contributr"d to the 
problem. Owens admitted, "We're sim­ply behind." 
In spite of early difficulties, Engler now has a fairly comp­lete list of all o-c residents,

Israeli jets . flying over Beriut, 24 miles north of here, and southern Lebanon on ~outine surveillance later in the day drew heavy anti-aircraft fire from Palestinian gunners. 
The source of the explosion wasn't immediately pinpointed. Some accounts said it came from one or two bomb-rigged cars while others said it was from a dynamite-packed truck parked outside the PLO's regional command headquarters. 
The blast collapsed numerous concrete and cinder­block apartment buildings into tons of rubble, hurled broken glass nearly a third of a mile away and wreckec vehicles in morning rush hour. 
The explosiOn, shortly after 9 a.m., occurred 50 minutes before the PLO and the leftist militia officers were to convene a meeting inside th~ PLO­National Movement building. 

ND security reports assault, break-in 
Notre Dame security officers questioned rwo juveniles in connection with the reported assualt of a St. Mary's student, but were unable to apprehend rwo men who entered the Washington Hall room ofanother student. Both incidents occurred about 4:15p.m. Wednesday. 
Notre Dame chiefof security Glenn Terry said the reported assualt occurred as the student was walking along St. Mary's road. Although the student had left the area by the 
' time securtiy officers arrived, Terry said the youths were picked up while running through the area. Terry said it was believed the youths "had contact with the student and words were exchanged.'' The rwo were questioned and released, Terry said. A female student asleep in her second floor Washington Hall room was awakened by rwo men who entered her room, but apparently ran from the residence hall when she screamed. terry said It was unknown how the men entered the hall and made their way to the second floor without being detected. Terry said security officers are invest­ig<lting reports of non_:-_§_tudents ''roaming -the halls '' 
The buikding's exterior walls 
were blown out but the PLO 
wouldn't say how much other 
damage occurred or let 
reporters approach it. 
The casualty count came from the names of those killed and wounded as compiled by police and medical workers at clinics here and ag Beriut hospitals, where many of the injured were rushed in taxicabs and ambulances. 
A Red Cross worker said 
there could be more bodies 
under the rubble. 
A reporter able to get near the blast area saw a weeping man carting off a blanket stuffed with a few possessioLs. 
An old woman refused FT .0 guards' requests that she leave her wrecked apartment 
IMi'dire 
Areporter able to get near the blast area saw a weeping man carting off a blanket stuffed with a few possessions. An old woman refused PLO guards' requests that she leave her wrecked apartment building. 
The explosion in Chekka, about 35 miles north of Beirut, was reported by the privately owned "Voice of Lebanon" radio station. The broadcast said the blast destroyed a cement plant. 
The "Front for the Liberation of Leganon from Aliens" was responsible for both explosions. according to a tel~~honing messenger not provtding an identity but claiming to speak for the group. 
Little is known about the Front, which has claimed responsibility for attacks on the PLO, leftist targets in the mostly Moslem sector of Beirut, and for an attempt to assassinate then-U.S. Ambassador John Gunther Dean in August 1980.

u.s. military plane crashes 
A West German army helicopter and a U.S. Military aircraft collided in.flight yesterday during NATO exercises, killing two Amencan and two German servicemen, authorities said. The four bodies were found in the wreckage of an Alouette II helicopter acd a propellor-driven ''OV 10 Bravo'' reconnaissance plane in southwest Germany, a German army spokesman said. He said the idendtities of the victims were not immediately available and that the cause of the collision was under investigation. The collision took place near the town of Albstadt-Ebingen, some 40 miles south of Stuttgart on the northeastern edge of the Black Forest, the spokesman said The West Germans were taking part in the "Sharp Blade" exercises as part of the annual NATO fall war games. -')ap) 

Student Union lotteries 
Does Notre Dame social life depend on the risky gamble ofa lottery? In a sense, the answer is yes; with all the popular concerts and nearby games this year, Student Union is increasing its use of lottery system for delegating tickets. Next on the the concert agenda is Dan Fogelberg, who will visit the ACC on Oct. 20. Sign-ups for the Fogelberg ticket lottery will be held at Stepan Center, this Sunday at 7:00 
p.m. One week from Sunday, sign-ups for the Nov. 7 foreigner concert will be taken at 7:00 p.m. in LaFortune ballroom. Besides the concert lotteries, Student Union will take names and I. D. numbers for chances at the 200 tickets for the November 21 Penn State game. Sign-ups will follow th.e method used for the Purdue and Michigan tickets, and wdl be taken on November 2,3, and 4 at the Student Union ticket office. As an added feature, Student Union 1s planning to sponsor a bus to the game. -The Observer ­
Jury finds DeMeyer guilty 
St. Joseph County Sheriff Ralph DeMeyer was found guilty last night of extorting money from an admitted Madame in exchange for protecting her prostitution operatin. The jury deliberated about five hours before returning the guilty verdict against DeMeyer. The 52 year-old sheriff was on trial in U.S. District Court on charges of conspiring to extort $5,200 in campaign contributions in 1978 from Ramona Desich. Ms. Desich then owned and operated go-go bars in South Bend. U.S. District Judge Allen Sharp set Nov. 6 as the sentencing date. (AP) 

Senators oppose arms sale 
Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., told Congress yesterday that failure to approve an $8.5 billion arms package for Saudi Arabia would undermine "our security, the security of Israel and peace itself.'' But one Senate foe said he has the votes to block the sale Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore. said 51 senators, 32 Democrats and 19 Republicans now co-sponsor a resolution to reject the sale to the Saudis of sophisticated A WACs radar planes and jetfighter weaponry. and he said six other senators also will vote against it. Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio., said compromise is essential because the administration, trying to sooth_ concerns over the impact of the spy planes on the security of Israel, plans to send Saudi Arabia "a down rated, half-way" A WACs incapable of meeting all combat situations. The former astronaut proposed a compromise by which the United States would cut the price of the A WACs fleet by halfin exchange for a joint U.S. I Saudi command. -(AP) 

Commission re}ects postal hike 
The 'Postal Rate Commission rejected another request to boost the price of a first-class stamp from 18 cents to 20 cents yesterday, discounting the Postal Service's claim that new labor contracts compel an increase. It was the third time the Postal Service has asked for a 20-cent stamp and the third time the independent rate-setting commission has refused to go along. In yesterday's decision, the commission said the public already pays ''fair and equitable rates'' that give the Postal Service enough money to deliver the mail. The nine-member Postal Service may vote to put the 20-cent rate into effect unilaterally at a meeting Tuesday. The law provides it can be impose such unilateral increases by a unanimous vote and by giving 10 days notice of its intention. However, such a move would be unprecedented and almost certain to cause a court challenge. -(AP)

Bending vs. breaking 
"The foolish and the dead never change their opinion.'' --James Russell Lowell 
Ifyou could take all the problems in the world and chalk them to a single cause, what would it be? Some might say philosophical differences, conflicting values, diverse ideologies, ineptitude or a thousand additional answers. I believe the answer is much more simple. We are a world which cannot compromise. 
As Mr. Lowell pointed out, never flinching from held opinions constitutes foolishness. And yet man cannot but help hold fast to opinions, for he has been bred to not compromise. The concept generally has negative connotations, often surfacing in such cliches as "com­promisisng yourself," or "compromising one's standards.'' 
The etymological roots of the word literally mean 'with promise.' Such a meaning may be interpreted as 'with promise' to attempt agreement. Every culture, society and person possesses some sort of values, ideas, beliefs or convictions. Considering institutions are con­stantly interacting, it is a wonder the world does not have more conflicts. 
The news of the last week, for instance, depicts vastly different conflicts -but all of which make world peace an elusive ideal rather than a concrete reality. For example: 
Northern Ireland--Hunger strikers continue to die, yet Britain remains aloof. Although Mrs. Thatcher may not see eye-to-eye with the IRA, such a rigid stance appears increasingly callous in light of the senseless deaths. 
Polish Labor situation--The Communist party 
has threatened the Solidarity Union with 
bloodshed should strikers seek political means 
to end their conflict. The labor strike has 
lingered for already over a year -with each 
side suffering and virtually no progress. 

Reagonomics--President Reagan remains 
adamant in his economic policies despite 
soaring interest rates, warnings from corporate 
entrepreneurs and even the Federal Reserve. 
The U.S. finds it necessary to spend billions of 
dollars on nuclear weapons -while a con 
siderable portion of the world starves -in an 
effort to maintain "peace.'' 

On a more local level, there are dozens ofdaily 
instances in the routine hustle and bustle of 
Domerland which demand compromise. The 
University bureaucracy, with which students 
identify every time an issue gets locked in a file 
~abine~ rather than bein.g rationally ~iscussed, 
Immediately comes to mi~d. ·And at umes, the 
administration must shake its head and lament 
how much we all have yet to learn. Instances 
where the University has clearly compromised 
($20,000 Coffee-house grant, new dormitories, 
additional registration day), student feedback 
may safely be tagged positive. 

Yes, even in our little Xanadu, so much of 
surviving the system entails compromise. the 
amount of time spent studying, a stand taken in 
a sticky situation and the manner of dealing with a roommate all entail compromise. A certain professor, for instance, likes papers written in a particular form. You forsake your creativity, turn in prose you consider dry, droll and lifeless for the sake of the almighty GPA. 

Over compromise or lack thereof, friendships can weaken should one party refuse to budge an inch on a particular issue. And though the issue may soon be forgotten, things are never quite the same when a disagreement has been solved leaving a clear victor and loser. 
Perhaps this is why there is so much dissension in the world. We have yet to master the art of compromise. 
Compromise is not negative, for it does not and should not m<.an a forfeiting of all standards. It is not one party giving in to 

another's policies in their entirety. It entails parties at both ends reaching some sort of middle ground both may come to comfortably rest upon. 
Perhaps ifinternational leaders could step into the moccassins of their foes and take a short walk, things would not appear in such distinct shades of black and white. we live in an increasingly complex, complicated world which makes black and white a virtual uncertainty. 
Reagan, the IRA, Walsea, and the Soviets the University, your friends and roommates' all need t<;> r~alize tha.t comp~omise is not a clirty word; It IS what lies behmd everything from labor negotiations to apologies. 
There is an old Scottish proverb which says "it is better to bend than break." The world's greatest problem? 
Flexibility.

The bustle and excitement which 
engulfed  the  Notrt  Dame  com­ 
munity  throughout  this  past  
weekend  brought  with  it  ap­ 

proximately HO incidents involving thdts. auto accidents and even the transfer of counterfeit money in the campus, according to Notre Dame Security. 
Although many of the actions reported an: the result of foul play, tht·re art· others, too, which made hnoes out of Notre Dame students in their attempts tp prevent any fur­thtr mishaps. 
:vronday night a ND female stu­dent, riding ht'f hike on the sidewalk path hctwt:cn Cartier field and Courtney Tennis Centn, was momt·ntarily assalted hy a male youth of approximately college age. An aproad1ing car. however, frightt·m·d the attackt.·r away.

other  student.  Phyllis  Tralka,  
brought  the  bill  to  Security, who  
confirmed  that  their  suspicions  

wert: correct. Anyone who thinks that they may have a bill such as this one is asked to bring it to Security as well.

A man dcscrihed as "i'8, 140 

Ibs. with blond hair and mustache 
carrying a back pack was seen near 
the vicinity during this time. and ·security is now investigating his whereabouts. 
Fr. Jerry Wilson was also the vic­
tim of a robbery over the weekend 
involving the loss ofa brown. zipper­

electric razor and a homily which Fr. 
Wilson had hoped to give at St. Joseph's Parish on Sunday. This inci­dent occurred somewhere in the vicinitv of the .'\<loreau Seminan· and the G~otto. and any assistan~·e in finding this case would bt: greatly appreciated. 
In addition to these various inci­dents. religious groups appeared on campus this weekend. making lengthy stops in both Flannt:r and Holy Cross halls. As a result. Sentrity served notices. asking them to kaw·. shortly after their arrival.

Liquor prohibited 

University permits use of Stepan 

By MARK ROLFES 
News Staff 
Contrary to earlier reports. all Stu­dent llnion events in Stepan Center have not been permanently can­celkd due to reports of alcohol abuse from last week's Polish Wed­ding. 
Dean of Students james Roemer and Director of Student Activities James McDo;mell recently sent let­ters to Student Union Director Bill Lawler complaining ofalcohol abuse at the Polish Wedding and issuing new guidelines for Stepan Center events. Student Union events in Stepan havt· not. however. been per­manentlY cancelled. 
One <;f the major complaints was the advertising for the Polish Wed­ding which featured a beer can and an invitation to "BYOB". This is a violation of Du Lac regulations prohibiting the promotion of al­cohol on campus. Another com-
Campus housing lottery unlikely this Spring 
By DAVID GUFFEY News Staff 
A junior class housin~ lot­tery is not likely thts year, according to Notre Dame housing officials. 
Vice President for Student Affairs Fr. John Van Wolvlear said that he is ''90 percent sure there will be no need for a housing lottery'' in the spring of 1982. This year there are "1114 seniors, the largest 
group ever, (as well as) 1565 juniors living on campus.'' 
According to Fr. Van Wolv­lear, enough spac_e should be created by graduatiOn to accom­odate those juniors who wish to stay on campus assuming that 
, , , Board 

continued from p. 1 
almost 90 percent of whom live in Campus View Apartments. 
She has made ten members of her twelve-member board resp­onsible for three apartments each in the complex. The members must distnbute man­uals, assorted newsletters, and become familiar with the girls in the apartments. Other mem­bers take care of those not in Campus View. 
Because of the high .Percent­age of off-campus restdents in security-patrolled Campus View, cnme has not been the major concern as it has been with Notre Dame. Engler said, however, that a security work­shoJ? is in the works. 
Thts is the first year for Saint Mary's to have such an or~anization, and the 0-C Com­mtssioner position is onlv two years itself, so Engler has her hands full. She is looking for innovative ideas to capture the ~mention of those ltving off campus. 
''People who move off campus are looking for something dif­ferent," according to Ens.ler. "So instead of having a tadgat­the same number of students voluntarily move off campus this spring as in previous years. 
Notre Dame Director of Hous­ing Fr. Michael Heppen declin­ed to comment on the chances of a lottery until he could further study new housing stat­istics. However, he pointed out that there has not been a need for a lottery since 1973 when women were first housed at Notre Dame. 
"On this basis," said Heppen, "the chances of a lottery seem slim." 
Final word on any lottery will not come until after housing contracts are signed early next semester. 
plaint was that "most students brought alcohm into Stepan" and that "numerous reports of drunken­ness and illness were recieved as a result of the Polish Wedding." 
Lawler has taken responsibility for the BYOB advertising. saying that it was the result of poor communica­tion with the new Student Union Publicity chairman during the first week of school when the posters were printed. Lawler. however. feels that students attending the Polish Wedding did not get out ofhand and that they stayed under control. "The entire damage was one broken chair." 
Lawler said that the Student Union will still be able to use Stepan and that plans for more movies, the SU Country Rock _lam and a possible George Thorogood concert are being made. 
The Roemer and McDonnell 
directives provide for stricter en­
forcement of the rules prohibiting 
alcohol in Stepan. All advertise­
ments must now clearly state that al­
cohol is forbidden in Stepan. Also. 
any violators will be evicted and the 
alcohol confiscated. Lawler pledged 
to make a greater effort for Stepan 
events to follow the DuLac regula­
tions. 
These directives seem to be an­
other part of the administration's 
recent campaign against alcohol 
abuse. McDonnell stressed a need 
for "creative promotions which 
stress good times, good people, and 
good fun without offering alcohol as 
an enticement."

Off-campus student Bill Christopher is combating crime by informing students to take special cautions in their neigh­borhoods by way of a 24-hour hotline service. 
Christopher is provtdmg the students with a hotline number to call if they need any infor­
mation about preventing crime 
in  their  area.  He  has  told  
students  where  to  purchase

Whatever Happened to Confession? 

Whatever happened to confes­sion? It used to be such a nice Saturday night sacrament. The priest used to leave the confessional at 9 p.m., feeling very satisfied with himself for all the souls he had polished with grace. He would go back to the rectory to listen r'1 Gun smoke and Lawrence Welk. People all over the city, he would think, would be goin~ to communion the next mormng 
because  he  had  given  them  
absolution.  
Confessions are  not as  much  

fun anymore. People don't come nearly as often, and when they do come, they're not sure what to confess. Lists of sins like grocery or laundry lists are out, priests have told them, because such lists are too dull to be helpful, though surely, in such a sacrament, it is God's grace, and not man's failure, that is supposed to be interest­ing. Mortal sins among practic­ing Catholics are as rare as halos, we are told rightly. Whether mortal, or not--a sin 10 its observable consequences can be serious and destructive, and it can lead the way to spiritual death. Confession is a way of mercy instituted by the Church for getting God's kind attention when purely personal efforts seemed to have failed. 
I'm not sure what to make of some confessions. A young woman says: ''My family has a great deal of money. We spent the summer travelling in Eur­ope. We saw old people and children on the streets, begging for food, and I refused to look at them." "Are you sorry," I say, "Be­cause you didn't try to help them?'' "I could never help them," she says, "because there were so many. I was embarassed in front of them, because I must have seemed so rich, while none of them have anything. I hated being a rich American, though it is not really my fault, is it, if my father has money?" 
She is no Mother Teresa, and I am no Cure of Ars, leading her to discern the faults that could underlie her embarassment. Money, in my family, was never so plentiful that we had to apologize for having it. A poor

Letters to a Lonely God 
priest makes a poor counselor in relieving the embarassment an American feels for being rich. 
"Honey," I wanted to say , ''the chances are that you are a highly sensitive youn~ lady, unused to the suffenngs of hungry and hopeless people who could spoil your enjoyment of a European holiday. Perhaps also, you are very spoiled and a little selfish, and you were angry at your first exposure to the world's sorrow. In honesty, ry to tell me as your confessor why you think you avoided seeing the faces of children begging for something to eat?" It would have sounded too personal, as though I were accusing her of sin, so I didn't say it. Some Catholics, it seems to me, confess only communal guilt shared with the world; they have no sense of themsel­ves as participants in evil personal to themselves. That is what makes me nervous about group reconcilation services.$ I do not like to use the word sin. Sin is not a word that I use easily as a confessor. A student tells me: "I spent a weekend on the Cape. We went crazy with beer and dope and _{>ills, and we did a lot of crazy dnving around the beaches in a jeep. Is that a 
. ~',
sm. 

I answerD "If we made dope a sacrament, would it have made you less crazy?'' 
I cannot begin a conversation or a confessiOn with the adv­ance judgment that some poor fool has committed serious sin, though some actions, clearly, are completely offensive. I pre­fer to look at the action, and how hurtful it has been to him and to others, and then ask: "How can it not be a sin?" 
Confession, as I understand it, is a sacrament of homecoming. It is the gentlest and surest way of returning to the Father's house. I say this not only as a priest who hears confessions, but also as a Catholic who sometimes needs it. 
In the Eye,of the Beholder 
The Miss America Pageant is one of those things that inter­ests me against my better judgment. It's a silly, commer~­ial event and probably not 10 the best interests of women. 
The producers of the contest, a moneymaking venture, have had the good sense to try to keep its reputation and the reputations of the girl contes­tants pristine. There's no fool­ing arotlnd there in Atlantic City. 
The trouble with the contest now is that what interests most men, against their better judgment, is the pretty girls. The organizers are pretending the girls are more than that, but even smart men aren't interest­ed in whether the Miss America contestants are smart or not. The producers have gone to great lengths to make it some­thing other than a bathing beauty contest and that's where they've gone wrong. That's all it ought to be. If we're going to have a Miss America contest, bring them all out in bathing suits and let's decide which one is best looking. Let's knock it off with the piano playing and the poetry recitations. Beauty may only be skin-deep but that's deep enought for a night's entertainment on television. 
While I enjoy looking at a few minutes of the Miss America show to try and decide for myself which among them is beautiful and which homely, I wouldn't want to spend much time with any one of them. If a woman has a good face and ag reat body, she's bound to know about it and she has a right to enjoy displaying a certain am­ount of what she's got. 
I don't find it offensive when a 
well-built woman wears a 

low-cut evening gown at a party 
but I think it's dumb for any 
woman to stand on a stage 
while judges look her up and 
down and check her over as 
though she were a poodle at a 
do~ show. I mean, if they're 
go10g to do this right, she ought 
to take her clothes off--all in a 
very proper manner and under 
close supervision, of course. 

I suspect this feeling I have them very pretty. I can walk down the street in New York any lunchtime during the week and see five girls on e-very block who look prettier than the winner, let alone the losers. If! were gong to hav~ a beauty contest for women, I'd get up early in the morning and look for the girls jogging in the parks. Many of them look better m baggy sweat suits than the Miss America contestants look in sleek evening gowns. The joggers have no makeup and thetr hair is flying but they have a natural kind of beauty about them that couldn't be judged in a contest. 
Andy Rooney 

thousand other things in a normal, natural, everyday sort of way. They don't enter Miss America contests. The prettiest college girls are studying or they're in class or they're out with the guys. They aren't standing on a stage saying, "Look at me!" 
There's a proven and practical value in being objective and 

The producers of the Miss America contest are _probably luck that so many of us find some of the girls unattractive because, aside from how bad most of the contestants perform their little act, picking out the homely ones is a big part of the fun of watching. Does someone really think all those girls are beautiful? Ifso, their opinion of b~auty differs sharply from mme. 
I'm more inclined to believe that they were only the best­looking girls they could get to enter the contest and that the prettiest women, the real Miss Americas, are the ones doing a applying numbers to a lot of things, but attempts to pin down something like what's funny or what's pretty have always failed. There's just no way to put a number on some things. Picking the most beauti­ful girl from a lineup is like being asked to tell the funniest joke you ever heard. It dep­ends, for one thing, on who you're telling it to. 
I guess it'a good thing there's such wide disagreement on what's beautiful because, by Miss America standards, most people don't have much of it.

Shakespearefestival 
;;;.~;!~ a!?m;;;;h~~~~~~·~=~o:: ;!=:;: begins on Monday 
Directed by Ronald Meame 
Wn'tten by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee Town & Country Theatre 
I've come to the decision that it is immoral to write this review. Writing requires a strict discipline and one of its cardinal s10s is the abuse of language--the word is too precious to be wasted. After seeing ''First Monday In Octo­ber,'' after seeing a total disre­gard for aesthettc sensibility, after seeing this inane puddle of cinematic dribble, I'd rather stick a finger down my throat than have to waste words on such a farce. 
''First Monday'' was already in the can, but Paramount rush released it when the nomination of Sandra O'Connor was anno­unced over the summer. And seeing a way to make a quick buck off ofcurrent events, thjey I'm concerned, they should never have let those two out of their padded cells, for their idea of a script is grounds for insanity. The "action" of the movie is nothing but a mean­dering of verbal quips between Walter Matthau and Jill Clay­burgh with footage o( the steps of the Supreme Court and bland patriotic music thrown in to complete the monotony. The scriptwriters' dog must have eaten the plot line because I couldn't find it on the screen. There isn't even a beginning, middle, or end to the movie-­only 90 minutes ·of unrelated and unintelligible boredom. 
If director Ronald Meame knew what he was doing, the film might have been salvaged. However, sloppy editing (or no editing at all), dull shots, and no sense of comic timin~, leads the film in the direction the script does--to the garbage. 
Movies 
iiiiiiiiii!iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii 
I feel sorry for Walter Mat­thau. Beneath the trash of Neil Simon, "Bad News Bears," and Lawrence and Lee, there exists a respectable actor. As "First Monday" is nothing but a poor ''Barefoot in the Su­preme Court,'' Matthau has been cursed with poor dialogue, a sterile character, and poor fellow actors. The only mom­ents when he shines, thus the only moments when the film shines, are when he doesn't say anything. For it is only at that time that he can use the creativity of his talents. As for Jill Clayburgh, I plead the Fifth. She is about as dramati; as a bowl of]ello and I wouldn t 1 1 cast her as an understudy for a piece ofshrubbery much less as a Supreme Court Justice. 
The Shakespeare Film Festi­
val, featuring six famous Shak­
espearean plays, opens this 
Monday with Laurence Olivi­
er's version of Henry V. The 
festival, which runs through 
Nov. 16, features a different 
Shakespearean classic one day 
a week for six successive 
weeks. A brief introduction by 
Profs. Paul Rathburn and James Robinson will precede the 7 and 10 p.m. showtimes, and a one dollar admission fee will be charged. 
Although the film lilne-up corresponds to classes in Sha­kespeare being taught by Robinson and Rathburn, the general public is welcome and encouraged to attend. "Sha­kespeare is simply a magnifi­cent playwright. He's universa­lly popular, entertaining, and challenging--most anyone can appreciate his works/' said Robinson. 
Monday's showing of Henry V and King Lear, to be shown on Nov. 16, correspond to Prof. Rathburn's Shakespeare course currently in progress. The remaining films--A Mzdsum­mer Night's Dream (Oct. 7), Hamlet (Oct. 14), and Macbeth (Oct. 28)--complement Prof. Robinson's minicourse entitled "Shakespeare's Theatre of Spirit'' which runs from Sept. 28 to Nov. 6. Rathburn's two films will each be shown in the Engineering Auditorium, whe­reas Robinson's will appear in the new Annenberg Auditori­um, located in the Snite Muse­um. 
Robinson emphasizes the com­bination of superb production and acting in each of these plays. The films boast produc­ing greats such as Franco Zeffirelli, Roman Polanski, and Laurence Olivier.

Eagles win battle of unbeatens 
Ron Jaworski pierced Buffalo's previously invulnerable defense with a pair of touchdown passes to lead the NFC Champion Philadelphia Eagles to a hard-fought 20-14 victory over the Bills last night in Buffalo. Jaworski fired touchdown strikes to tight end Keith Krepfle and wide receiver Harold Carmichael, and kicker Tony Franklin added field goals of 29 and 44 yards to help the Eagles' cause. With Philadelphia leading 17-14 tn the fourth quarter, Bills kicker Nick Mike-Mayer, a former Eagle missed a chip-shot 20-yard field goal attempt that would have tied the game. From theie, the Eagles, now 3-0, added some insurance points and the defense did the rest. Buffalo fell to 2-1.

''He's going to be my main blocking assingment, '' remark­ed Edwards. ''Crable's probab­ly the finest linebacker in the nation and man, can he hit. We bumped into each other in last year's game. He's the type of player who never lets up on you. He typifies the team; he's strong, smart and physical player. I know I was pretty sore, physically, after last year's ~ame and I don't expect anyth­zng to be that much different in Saturday's game.

Despite Crisler's gentlemanly statements, the n·valry again halted after only a two-year resumption. Because of the demand for tickets and because he knew that his n'val Leahy would be a ferocious competit­or, Cnsler never would agree to another senes with the Insh. Cnsler claimed that the contin­uance of a Notre Dame series would detract from the Ohio State and other Big Ten n'val­n'es. That feeling perszsted unt:l Edward ''Moose'' Krause and Don Canham started talk­ing about the present and continuing senes when Canham became athletic director in 1968.

By DREW SHARP Executive Sports Editor The Michigan Daily 
"Welcome to ABC's NCAA 
.... football. Today 's game pits the Fighting In'sh of Notre Dame against the Michigan Wolver­ines starring Stanley Edwards. ' 
Stan Edwards thrives on being in the spotlight. The 6-0, 208­pound fullback came to Michi­gan because it had a well-run, and strongly publicized, foot­ball program. He knew that Wolven'ne football games wo­uld be televised often through­out the country and he could only benefit from the exposure. Little did Edwards know that he would be _the highlight of Michigan's nationally televt'sed games. 
In the past two seasons, the Detroit native has captured the ABC-TV Chevrolet player ofthe gameawardfourtimes. He won it against Notre Dame and Michigan State in 1979, and against Illinois and Purdue in 1980. 
''It seems like most ofthe time that we play on television, I have a good game, '' satd edwards. ''I guess I wanted to make the best of it whenever our games are televt'sed. I've had what I considered to be good games throughout my career, but I'm kind oflucky to have my best games on TV. I'm just glad that my playing help­ed us win most of those games. 'I 
-,_ 
Edwards' team attitude is best typified by ht's switch from tailback to fullback at the beginning of the 1980 season. Edwards had a slight edge oer Butch Woolfolk in the tailback slot following the 1979 campa­ign but coach Bo Schembechler wantedto utzlize both players in the same backfield because of their fine speed. Thus, Edwar­ds was destined to be one ofthe smallest fullbacks in the Big Ten. He made good of the transition, however, accumula­ting 901 yards for the season. In all, Edwards felt that the change has made him a better all around football player. "Mainly, I'm just glad to be playing, '' Edwards added. "We've got two fine backs t"n Butch and Larry [Ricks] and these guys have to play. And zf pla:ying them means moving me to fullback, then that's fine with me. I like going through the line to get the three or four yards a shot. I know I still have the speed and by adding this dimension to my game, I think that it will improve my worth for the pros. When you have the backfield lzlke we have, you can go to any ofthem to g_et the job done. I'm happy with the way things are now. The fullback gets the chance to roll over people sometimes, and I like doing that. '' 
A defensive player who might not necessarily roll over is Notre Dame's aii-Amencan linebacker, Bob Crable. Crable
