Militants invade Iranian Embassy 
LONDON (AP)-Three ''Ar­ab power'' militants took over the Iranian Embassy on a quiet London back street yesterday and threatened to kill their 20 hostages unless Ayatolloah Ru­hollah Khomeini 's regime frees 91 political prisoners held in Iran's Arab-populated oil belt. 
If the Tehran government does not meet their demand by noon today, the gunmen said, theywill blow up the building. 
The three terrorists, report­edly armed with submachine guns or carbines, identified themselves as Arabs from Khu­zestan who support autonomy for that region of southwest Iran. 
The British Broadcasting Corp., which received the ulti­matum in a telephone call from the embassy, said the gunmen reported one of their hostages had been wounded and they wanted a doctor. The victim was not identified. 
Witnesses had said they heard gunfire as the terrorists forced their way into the build­ing at 6:30a.m. EDT. 
The only other casualty re­ported was a woman captive who was released in late after­noon suffering from what police said was severe shock. She was carried out on a stretcher and rushed off by ambulance. 
Police said her release left 20 hostages, including a British police guard. The top Iranian dtplomat in London, Charge d'Affaires Gholan-Hli Afrouz, also was reported among those held captive. 
The BBC said the terrorists also demanded a safe flight out of Britain for themselves and their hostages. 
Police later confirmed the gunmen's demands were simi­lar to those reported by the BBC. And "there is certainly a

honor professors 
by Michael Mader StaffReporter 
Residents of Sorin Hall last 
night honored four professors 
with the Paul Fenlon Teaching 
Award, an award bearing the 
name of the guest of honor and 
Sorin Hall's resident of 63 
years. The students presented 
the awards at a dinner on the 
top floor of St. Joseph Bank. 
The dinner is the first in what is 
to be an annual event honoring 
an instructor in each College of 
the University. 
Fenlon, a retired professor of English, joked with the students, suggesting they live with him in Sorin for another 60 years. M. C. Paul Lewis responded by noting that his father was born the same year Fenlon moved into Sorin. 
The winner of the Fenlon

and mechanical engineering.

threat of hostages ue· ng killed,'' Deputy Assistant Po­lice Commissioner John Dellow told reporters. 
He also said, "Twenty-four hours has been memioned. '' 
The British Foreign Office was in contact with the Iranian revolutionary government of Khomeini, and assured it that Britain would end the seige speedily' 'and so far as possible without casualties.'' 
Arabs are an ethnic minority in Iran, concentrated in oil-rich Khuzestan province. Dissidents among the 2 million Arabs there have been agitating for the past year for greater auton­omy from the Persian-domin­ated central government. 
Among other things, they want the right to use Arabic as their official language, greater control over education and a larger share of the oil wealth. Some want outright secession. 
Militants in Khuzestan -the Arabs call it Arabistan -have sabotaged pipelines, set off bombs in ctty streets and attacked government officials and security men. Several have been executed in recent weeks. The London terrorists said the 91 whose freedom they were demanding were all being held in Khuzestan.

they stress "nesotiating" with the administration, represent­ing the students' viewpoint in major decisions. 
There are some indications that Riehle will not stick solely to this traditional attitude. He was, for example, a leader in the ''save hockey'' protest at the Marquette basketball game. But his candidacy rested on the traditional ap­proach, and his further actions, obviously, remain to be judged. 
Candidate Bob Carey articu­lated some students' sense of frustration with the traditional approach. While he stopped short of advocating ''fighting in the streets," Carey did assert that students have tools in dealing with the administra­tion; the money .students pay, and the image alumni and administrators like to attribute to the students. Carey was eliminated in the first round of the elections. 
Candidate Bill "Slatts" Slat­tery articulated the opposite, and third basic approach to student government. Citing the relattve powerlessness of student government, Slattery advocated a more entertain­ment-oriented administration. He seemed to be saying, ''we can't change anything anyway, so to hell with it." 
The most famous advocate of this ''to hell with it'' school is undoubtedly R. Calhoun (King) Kersten, who was elected tn 1972 with his running mate, UnCandidate, a female car. Kersten dressed in a king's robe and fake crown, and his administration is still remem­bered more for his outrageous exploits than his accomplish­ments. 
Slattery's support probably came from another group of students who are frustrated with the traditional approach. reasoning that any major change at Notre Dame will rake years to accomplish, if it is accomplished at all,. Slatts abandoned most of the usual SBP platform issues. 
These three approaches sur­face in varying degree in almost every SBP electton. Yet the traditional candidate is chosen by the students time after time (with the notable exception of "King" Kersten.) 
There is no indication that this trend will change in the near future. The entrance survey of ND freshmen, re­leased by information services, shows that ND students echo the general trend of conserva­tism found nationwide. Thus it would srf'm that the future 
looks bright for these tradition­
al candidates. 
Because of the SG' s lack of 
direct authority, issues also 
seem !epetitive. John Barker, 
SBP tn 1971-72, outlined a 
blueprint for future SBPs for 
The Observer in February, 
1973. He saw the three 
functions of SG as representa­
tion, ''watchdoggins'' with re­
spect to ~dministratlve actions, 
and servtce such as Ombuds­
man. 
Some of his 20 points should sound familiar to present ND students. ''Is tenure a dead issue?'' he wrote. He also called for SG action in student security, self-responsibility, drug abuse, and the then­active honor system. He also wrote "physical renovation of the student center is a must.'' All of these issues have sur­faced in one form or another in recent SBP elections, with little concrete progress. 
Barker's most telling com­ment concerned the students' knowledge of SG. "For one thing," he wrote, "much of what Student Government does is not credited to student government by the everyday student, or anyone else, for that matter.'' 
Outgoing SBP Bill Roche no doubt felt this problem when he termed his administration a "subtle success" before he left office. 
Much of what student gov­ernment does, however, cannot be seen by the students be­cause of the SBP's traditional approach to his office. Negoti­ations with the administration, by definition and practice, in­volve compromise behind closed doors. When something is gained in these meetings, it is usually a far cry from the SBP's original platform, lead­ing to a sense of frustration in the student body. This is inherent, however, in negoti­ating-something must be compromised. 
A good example was the so-called "student rights" is­sue in September of 1978. Following an alcohol directive by Dean of Students James Roemer which indicated that University regulations on drinking in the stadium and on University property would be strictly enforced then SBP An­dy McKenna and the H::dl President's Coucil met with administration officials. The matter blossomed into an issue of student rights-the students wanted a voice in such matters before directives were issued. 
After a few late nights and much concern, the rough edges

dents, for example, are con­cerned about the number of professors who did not receive tenure this year. Yet Roche, Riehle and the other traditional SBP types have had little to say about the matter. 
Again, this seems to be inherent in the traditional ap­proach. When an issue had to be negotiated over a long period of time, and when other matters also distracted the two parties (such as running the University and SG day to day) nothing seems, to the students, at least, to be coming out of those closed doors. 
Whether or not SG is ''effec­Live" can be debated forever, but a few things are clear. The traditional approach to Student Government has dominated the office of SBP, and indications are that it will for at least the 
next  few  years.  Alternative  
candidates,  such  as  Bruce ·  
Blanco,  Mike  ''Hymie''  

Heaney, Bob Carey and "Slatts" Slattery have consis­tently been rejected by the students. 
Secondly, the accomplish­ments of these traditional can­didates and the platforms they espouse, are similar and will continue to be so. With their style of compromise and nego­tiating, most successes are bound to be "subtle," even though they may be of major import. But because they are not visible, and because most students, as Barker noted, seem confused about SG, there is bound to be a certain frustration in the student body, and SBPs are bound to fall short of their goals. 
No one really knows how successful the other ap­proaches to SG would be-they have not had a chance. But experience with the admini­stration, and the on-again, off-again support found among most students indicate that the other two attitudes would not be much more successful. 
What may be in order is a re-evaluation of SG by the everyday student, not by the candidates. Students may be expecting too much, or be led to expect too much by ''experi­enced" and "realistic" candi­dates. But, in any event, the face and substance of student government at Notre Dame, like the cliches and issues, will u:majg much the same for the next few years.

"I think it would be great to use the WNDU building for this purpose, but we'd like to ake an approach similar to the one on the student center-that is, not to press so much for immediate conversion of the WNDU building, but rather, make it obvious to the trustees that we also expressed an interest in acquiring the property when WNDU vacates the site-currently expected to happen some time next year.

The instructors each received smaller plaques presented to them by students currently in their classes. 
After the awards were given, Sorin's Assistant Rector Fr.

"The Dome is there, the church is there, and Sorin is there. But most of all, there are the people that alumni can come to see," Malloy said. 
"There isn't any greater testimony of love than to live among his students for 50 years, and in Sorin for 63 years,'' Malloy commended. 
Malloy explained that the awards for the instructors were not meant to honor their lives, but to recognize those who were dedicated to teaching their students. Naming the teachers to Fenlon's award was an appropriate recognition of the instructors' abilities, Malloy said.

While the majority of college football seniors were huddling around the phone during the National Football League draft meetings, quarterback Rusty Lisch was up to his usual tricks-playing golf at Elbel Golf Course. 
The Saint Louis Cardinals' fourth round choice 
has no qualms about the selection. 
''Of all the clubs in the NFL, St. Louis is the only one for which I have any preference,'' said a usually subdued Lisch. "It'll be sort of nice to play for the Cards because my home in Belleville (Ill.) is only about 20 minutes away." 
The 6-4, 210-pound architechture major will join last year's starter Jim Hart and backup quarterback Steve Pisarkiewicz on the Cardinal depth chart. Hart has double digit experience in the NFL, but the aging field general might not have too many good years left. 
"He (hart) is a seasoned veteran," said Lisch. ~~?uld be able to learn a lot playing behind 
Ti~arkiewicz should give Lisch, who passed for fls1 yards in 1979 and 2616 in his career at Notre Dame, very little competition as the Cards' second signal caller. Chicago Bear fans may remember Pisarkiewicz pathetic perform­ance in the regular season finale-his falling down on numerous occasions and completing mor~ passes to Bear defenders than Cardinal receivers.

season was in the secondary were all-pro free 
safety Tommy Meyers was the only real stalwart 
with Eric Felton and veteran Ray Brown lending 
a hand at the other safety spot. 
"We'd like to try-Dave at cornerback ftrst" said Saints head coach Dick Nolan. "We're really happy to have a fine athlete like him because he can do so much. We could possibly try him as a punt returner, too." 
During his first two years Waymer caught 10 passes covering 164 yards, including a 68-yard touchdown reception from Joe Montana against Georgia Tech in 1977. As a ball carrier, Waymer covered 47 yards on 10 attempts. He also completed a 34-yard toss to Dan Kelleher against Oregon in 1976. As a punt returner, Waymer averaged eight yards per run back. 
Yet, the vast part ofWaymer's experience has been on the other side of the line of scrimmage where he has played both cornerback and safety. In four years, the 6-3 188 pound Waymer made 98 tackles, broke up 22 passes and picked off another eight, returning those interceptions 111 yards. · · 
It's a little too early to talk about money and contracts, but as Waymer was running laps with Vagas Ferguson on Tuesday, their former Irish coaches joked, "Look who finally decided to start working out." 
"Now it's for the bucks," they smiled back. 
receivers. The Chicago win earned the Bears a playoff berth over the Washington Redskins. 
"Needless to say, we are badly in need of quarterback talent," said a St. Louis official. ''Rusty Lisch is a fine football player and a great athlete. He will help us tremendously." 
It was Lisch's all-round athletic ability that allowed him to be selected ahead of heralded quarterback Paul McDonald of Southern Cal. McDonald will join Trojan teammate and Heisman Trophy winner Charles White in Cleveland. 
While McDonald may be handing off to the familiar hands of White, Lisch will encounter a capable Cardinal offense. Otis Anderson, 1979 Rookie of the Year, sparks the St. Louis backfield, while Wayne Morris helps with the ball-carrying duties. Wide receiver Mel Grey and 1980 second round draft selection Doug Marsh, a tight end from Michigan, should provide Hart, Lisch, or Pisarktewicz with sure-handed receivers. 
With his mellow attitude and philosophy, Rusty Lisch will be happy in St. Louis, or anywhere else his career takes him-as long as there is a golf course nearby,..

Nielsen's ego trip 
With the amazingsuccessof their Live at Budokan album, Cheap Trick has faced an unusual dilemma in recent months For the first time the band is playing in large arenas before packed audiences, but the boys from Rock­ford, Illit.10is, face a crowd with great expectations, because Cheap Trick's live sound was presented so well on that album. Promises have been made, as far as fans are concerned and the band had better deliver. ' 
And wi~h a few minor exceptions Cheap Trickkept thosepromises Tues­day ntght at the ACC, much to the delight of the near-capacity crowd. . The major problem for the band is Rick Nielsen's ego. Nielsen, who writes most of Cheap Trick's material aand plays lead guitar, is a prime candidate for the Steve Martin ''I'm not trying to be the center of attention'' award for rock musicians. 
in  his  Bowery  Boys-style  ~arb,  
Nielsen  is  easily  the  most  visible  
member  of  the  band,  which  is  

obviouly the way ·he likes it. Even when the spotlight is not on him, Nielsen prances about the stage flinging guitao{' picks and generally acting crazy. It's kind of funny for awhile, but when he's still going through the same motions during the encore, the act begins to wear a little thin. People who have seen Cheap Tric~ more than once get really bored wth 1t. 
But the quality of Nielsen's songs and the obvious talents of the other members of Cheap Trick helps to overcome Nielsen's attention grab­bing tactics. Robin Zander's versatile voice is mainly responsible for Cheap Trick's sound and stands up well in

concert, Tom Petersson displays sor:ne remarkable versatility on bass guaar, and the venerable Bun E. Carlos is as dependable as ever on the drums. 
Zander plays guitar for Cheap Trick also, but Tuesday was content most of the time to just handle the vocals. With Nielsen soloing on guitar, the volume was pumped up somt; to try and create a fuller sound, but mstead a few songs were a bit muddy.

very Impressive live. "Can't Hold On'', a new song apparently set for their new album, showed an impres­sive change of pace for the band a really laid-back blues-style song that may indicat that Cheap Trick may be trymg to expand their horizons. 
Equally impressive was their treat­ment of a couple of old favorites, the Beatles' "Da}' Tripper", where Zan­~er' s vo~al simi! arity to John Lennon IS unbelievable, and Fats Domino's "Ain't That a Shame", thestandout cut on the Budokan album. . ~heap Trick is clearly a band that Is mten_t Of! co_ntinuing their success, and all mdicauons seem to point to an even greater audience. If Nielsen can learn to control his ego and let his pals share the spotlight, Cheap Trick has a chance co really shine.

Rick Walters plays acoustic onNightfligfJt 
Rick Walters, a guitar instrumen­~alist, will appear this Sunday night m an evening of accoustic guitar on the WSND-FM Nocturne Nightflight radio program.

With his first album currently being recorded, Rick Walters will share his music and experiences as president of Erebus Music Corpora­tion, a creative organization for ~usicia.ns and composers of acous­tiC mUSIC. 
Advance sales of his upcoming album have been encouraging, total­ing 20 percent of the 500 planned first-edition copies. 
"An Evening of Acoustic Guitar" with Rick Walters will be hosted by Barry Stevens and Tom Krueger. Listeners are invited to call in live with questions or comments at 7342 or 7425, beginning at 12:15 Sunday night on WSND-FM 88.9. 

Musicviews 

Christopher Cross 
Christopher Cross 
(Warner) 

A native of Texas Christopher Cross h~s just recen;ly burst onto the music scene with his self-titled debut album. Despite his back­ground, Cross' sound is basic Cali­fornia pop, similar in style to artists like Kenny Loggins, Nicolette Lar­son, and the Doobie Brothers. 
So it's probably no great coince­dence that Larson and Michael Mc~onald of the Doobies happen co assist Cross on background voca!s, along with Don Henley of the Eagles, J.D. Souther, and Valerie Carter. 
With that all-star lineup and a solid group of backing vocals, Cross presents us with a pleasing album with a lot of promise and one flash of sheer brilliance. 
Cross wrote all the material for his debut, and the opening cut, "Say You'.ll Be Mine", IS a good example of hts style. This· easy-going pop song, with Larson providing backup vocals, is quite similar to Larson's own treatment of Neil Young's ''Lotta Love'' on her own debut album. 
"I Really Don't Know Anymore" (with McDonald on backup) and "Never Be the Same" continue the style set by the opening cut, but much of the album is also devoted to ballads. Cross writes mostly love songs, but "Sailing" is an inter­esting variation, capturing the feeling of gliding across the water and the emotions a moment like that can create fairly well. 
But what makes this album truly worthwhile is four and a half minute~ of magic on side rwo, a fantastic song called ''Ride Like the Wind.'' Cross' first single is a real grabber, a song that impresses you the first time you hear it. And despite the overplay that a popular s':mg can get on the radio, ''Ride Ltke the Wind" sounds just as fresh now as it did when I heard it in February. 
"Ride Like the Wind" is dedicated to Lowell George, the former member of Little Feat who died a fe~ months ago. The song deals wtth a wanted man trying to escape the law by fleeing to Mexico. 
It is the night 
Afy body's weak 
I'm on the run 
No time to sleep 
I've got to ride 
Ride like the wind 
To be free again. 
The lyrics are pretty basic, but what. n:akes this song work is the convtctton of Cross' vocals and the sweepi_ng quality of the melody. There ts an urgent tone to this song that captures that feeling of running perfectly. McDonald's echoing backup vocals and some great orchestration make ''Ride Like the Wind" one of the best singles I've heard since "Born To Run." 
The standards set by ''Ride Like ~he Wind" gives Cross some enor­mous promise for the future. One can only hope that he will deliver.

designed to obtain support for the Illinois ratificaton of the amendment, the NOW effo.t:t has gained mention in the national media. The number of supporters (or opponents for that matter) who will appear at the march cannot be estimated. Yet, NOW's heavy backing of marches in the past has always attracted crowds and journalists. 
The Notre Dame women who plan to participate are members of the Notre Dame Women's Organization-­a group founded this year by Senior Renee Leuchten. Despite minimal university support, the group has sponsored workshops, lectures, panel discussions, rap sessions and women's activities.

She further explained that the ''laws on the books'' are steeped in loopholes and open the door for discrimination and labelled them "piecemeal legislation." 
Feminists view ERA as the legisla­tive step which would force the government to strictly enforce exist­ing laws involving discrimination, asserted Leuchten. She conceded that ERA would not change tradition­al male attitudes but did say, "If the co~rt cases were strenghtened, the attitudes would slowly follow.'' 
Speaking from the perspective of being female and at Notre Dame, Leuchten said she did not think the University has been cooperative with her gr<;mp's efforts. The University, accordmg to Leuchten, refused to grant the NDWO a room to base their office in. 
She voiced her belief that the University has a "self-congratula­tory" attitude, since they allowed the Women's Advisorv Council, which sexes. '' 
"I don't believe men really know women or we men know men here. There is no real communication; we have to keep too much distance from each other,'' she said. She added that a lack of communication breeds frustration and anger. 
Citing examples of Eastern Catholic universities which have gone coeducational in the last ten years, Leuchten said she thinks Notre Dame is progressing too slowly in its move to coeducation. She said schools which have gone coed after Notre Dame are now half male and half female. According to Leuchten, the 50I 50 ratio is optimum and could alleviate much of the frustration that stems from the present ratio. 
Opponents of the twenty four word amendment contend that the amendment will destroy the family and advocate everything from abor­tion to unisex restrooms. ''There is so much ignorance about the issues," Leuchten said and cited a recent 
Of the major presidential conten­ders, Ronald Reagan is the only candidate who has openly opposed ERA. Yet, Leuchten said though President Carter suprons ERA, she does not believe that he has exerted enough political pressure on congre­ssional members to get the amend­ment ratified. 
ERA only has until June of 1981, 
and what if it shoulcf die? ''Any

Horsing around in Michiana 

Patty Sheehan 
Now that spring has arrived, many 

horse lovers, and even those who 
prefer to regard the large creatures 
from outside of the fence, will be 
taking advantage of the fair weather 
to trek up to the nearest riding 
stables. If you're longing to ride a 
horse for the first rime, or to take a 
long trip up the beach of Lake 
Michigan, or to brush up on your 
riding skills, the riding facilities in 
Michiana are ready to satisfy your 
spring fancy. 
Michiana Riding Stables, one of 

the most popular stables of Saint 
Mary's and Notre Dame students, 
offers a 41/z mile trail ride for 
beginning and intermediate riders. 
The horses are gentle and well­
trained and you can ride alone or 
with a guide. 
One of the highlights of the stables is the ever-popular 18-mile beach ride along the Lake Michigan shore. The horses are trailored to Lake Michigan during the day and the ride lasts until the evening. The guides then build a bonfire on the beach and roast hotdogs and marsh­mallows which they supply for the whole group. It's an excellent way to spend a relaxing evening at a relatively low cost. Another exciting activity is the hay ride for large groups of people in wagons pulled by draft horses. 
Riding courses in English style are also offered with lessons ranging from beginning to advanced levels. 
Michiana Riding Stables is just off 1-94 in Michigan City, about a 45-minute drive. It is open every day from 10 a.m. to ...6--p.m. and lessons are given on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, · ;days, and Satur­days. 
Four Flags Stables also offers English lessons during the spring season. The facility includes indoor and outdoor arenas, and cross­country and stadium jump courses set on 25 acres of land. Lessons are geared for any level riders althoug the most experienced levels arc preferred. Sessions are otfered on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. until dusk. The stables are located on Red Bud Trail, six miles north ot Buchanan, about a 20-minute drive. 
Western style riding abounds in the Michiana area and a nearby stable is equipped for those who prefer the saddle with the horn. Keith Heil' s Training Stables has any level of training for every level of riding ability. An indoor riding arena and an outdoor jump course are part of the facilities set on five acres of land. Group lessons are scheduled on Saturdays 11:30 a.m.­3:00p.m. and private lessons can be scheduled with the instructor. The stables are just off U.S. 31 on Ironwood Road, about a 15-minute drive. 
For those of you intimidated by the thought of climbing onto a horse for the first time, here are a few helpful hints to help you feel like a pro before you even walk into a barn: 
··When in doubt about how much riding experience you've had, say "beginner." Anything besides a gentle horse at a public riding stables is for expenenced riders only. 
··Always go with a friend (or six). The more the merrier, but also the less chance you'll have getting lost in the woods with your galavanting steed. 
--Don't get too rowdy-around horses. They may look dead quiet, but a loud noise or an unexpected slap on the rump might send a newly-shod hoof into the side of your head. Always make sure the horse knows you're there before making any fast moves (like vaulting into the saddle). 
··The horse wants to be friends as much as you do. A horse appreci­ates the sound of your voice before you even pat his head. While riding along, if you get tired of talking to your friends, talk to the horse. You'll have a much pleasanter ride 
and a much nicer horse if you do. 
--Wear long pants and hard shoes. 
Sweating in ninety-degree weather is not half as painful as saddle sores rubbed into the inside of your legs after wearing shorts, or after wear­ing sandles, bruised toes from heavy horses with clumsy feet. Hard hats are necessary for English riders, ~xpe~ially if you're going to do some Jumpmg. 
--Relax and enjoy the ride. lf you're nervous, the horse will be nervous. The horses at public riding places have been through every kind of riding encounter, so if you show them you're not afraid and are willing to have a nice time, relief will spread across their faces, and they'll let out a deep sigh. Now, hop on (not too quickly), and enjoy your spring fling. 
(Information regarding any of the riding facilities mentioned above can be obtained by contacting Patty Sheehan at 4162 -SMC.)

VVornen'ssoccershovvshope 
This year's An Tostal Soccer Tournament was an experiment organized to show a dubious interhall office women's interest in soccer on the Notre Dame campus does exist. Organizers of the tournament, Mary Melley and Steve Milan, estimated between 160-180 women fielded the seven Notre Dame and the five St. Mary's teams. Judging by the number participating, the pair deemed the tournament successful. ''The a;nazing dedication of the players and coaches shows that a women's soccer program can work at this school," said Milan. "The interest and talent is here, now all we need is the interhall office or some individuals to continue the program,'' said Melley. Last Saturday, Breen Phillips defeated Holy Cross to become the chamls of what is hopefully the first annual women's An Tosta soccer tournament.

Golfteam moves closer to bidoffer 
b_y Bzll McCormick Sports Wn'ter 
The Notre Dame golf team moved two steps closer to an NCAA bid with a pair of impressive performances this past week. · 
Four teams will be selected from Notre Dame's district (District 4) to compete in the national tournament at Ohio Sate on Mav 28-31. And with third place hnishes at both the Purdue Invitational last Satur­day and the Mid-American 
Invitational on Monday, the Irish are in strong contention for one of the four coveted bids. 
There were 16 teams a·t Purdue and 15 at the Mid-Ame­rican, and Notre Dame compil­ed an overall record of 25-4-4 for the tvvo events. Only Indiana 
(7 31) and Ball St. (7 35) finished 
. ahead of the Irish (752) at Purdue, while Ohio University 
(759) and Miami of Ohio (761) squeaked by Notre Dame at the Mid-American. 
As he has done all season, John Lundgren led the scoring for the Irish at both tourna· ments. Lundgren's 145 (72-73) at Purdue earned him third place in the individual stand­mgs. Notre Dame's other scores were as follows: Tom McCarthy 148 ( 76-72), Tim Sacheck 152 (74-78), Bill McGu­inness 152 (73-79), Dave Knee 155 (79-76), and Stoney Fed­mann 172 (84-88). 
Lundgren also took third in the overall standings at the Mid­American with a score of 148 (77-71). Grab bing sixth place among all competitors was Notre Dame's Knee with 149 (7 3·76). Roundingout the indiv­idual scoring for the Irish on Monday were McCarthy at 154 (78-76), McGuinness at 156 (80-76), Ferlmann at 157 (79-78, and Sacheck at 163 (79-84). 
In both tournaments, Notre Dame demonstrated the kind of consistent play which has been characteristic of the team all spring. Yet at the same time, the Irish golfers couldn't man­age to put together the really super round which has eluded them this entire season. 
''In every tournament so far, some team has come up with a stud round,'' said Irish coach Noel O'Sullivan. "We have yet to thrown one, and it's a little frustrating because I know we're capable of it." 
O'Sulhvan, though, is cer­tainly not disappointed with his team's performance thus far. ''At the beginning of the season I said that we were trying for consistently high finishes in every event," O'Sullivan recal­led. "And it is obvious that we have succeeded in this goal up to this point.'' 
Constdering the possibility of an invitation to the national tournament, O'Sullivan sound­ed fairly optimistic. And he has good reason to be so. ~irst, th.e Irish have proven tn thetr consistently fine play that rhey are one of the best teams in their district. Also, for the first time ever, O'Sullivan is a member of the five-man selec· tion committee that will decide which four teams will receive bids. And though O'Sullivan

simply smiles when this fact is mentioned, it's obvious that it will be an advantage for Notre Dame come selection time. 
With one tournament left for the Irish, the Spartan Invita· tiona! in East Lansing this weekend, O'Sullivan is being careful not to get too optimistic. "Ifwe don't come through with a real strong finish at the Spartan, it's somewhat doubt­ful that we'll gain a bid to the NCAA's," he stressed. "But I've got a lot of confidence in the team, and I'm hoping for the best.''

They have got one right-next door which IS willing to accept them. Either way, they won't lose out on their proposal. 
The executive committees of the WCHA and the CCHA will meet on May 22 to talk things over, but alot of it will be old hat. The CCHA has proposed the idea already more than once, and it has been rebuffed. 
As was the case before, the WCHA is holding the cards over this whole issue. Unless it acts accordingly, it could lose four of those cards quickly. That could spell the beginning of the end for one of the nation's finest athletic conferences.

success. The team would not have the confiden<.:e it does if it weren't for Coach Kelly." 
As for the prospect of coaching at Notre Dame, the three-year letterman catcher and first baseman from Rhode Island is enthusiastic. 
"I feel fortunate to take over such a fine program-it is a really positive factor. I'm happy to have the opportunity to coach at Notre Dame." ''I recommended Larry for the job, and I am really happy he was chosen," said Kelly. "It should make the transitton that much smoother. I'll give the team as much support as I can, and be glad to help whenever I have the time or chance.''

our manager has used him,'' Peterson said at a press confer­ence. ''He has asked me to try and trade him, which I will try to do. Until I can trade him, he will not pitch for the Pirates any further.'' 
Blyleven has an 0-2 record in five starts this season. On Tuesday night, he lost a 4-1 lead against the Montreal Expos and wound up with no decision as Pittsburgh went on to win 5-4 in 10 inmngs. 
After Montreal tied the score 
i.1 the top of the sixth, Blyleven was replaced by a pinch hitter in the bottom of the inning. Blyleven, who also raised objections at being lifted last season, met behind closed doors with Tanner after the game. 
"He wanted to talk to me. His spirits are down," Tanner said after the meeting. ''I said, 'Just relax and enjoy_ yourself, and you'll reel off four or five in a row.' " 
But Blyleven, who was 12-5 last season in 37 starts, appar­ently decided he could tolerate no more. 
"He has nothing personal against Chuck at all. He told me he thinks Chuck's a great guy, an outstanding manager and motivator. It is just that he is so unhappy and frus­trated with the way he has been used it's just tearing h:m up inside. 
"It has affected his everyday life and his effectiveness as a pitcher,so he doesn't want to pitch for the Pittsburgh Pirates any further.'' 
Peterson said he understood 
Blyleven would return to his 
home in California. He said 
the pitcher had instructed the 
Pirates not tc release his 
telephone number to the news 
media. 

"He wanted me to express his 
feelings,'' said Peterson, 
adding that, pendmg a possible 
trade, he would try to place 
Blyleven on the disqualified 
list. He'll likely be replaced by 
pitcher Don Robinson, who is 
recovering from a shoulder 
problem.
