Nicaraguan insurgents denied aid by Congress

WASHINGTON The 
Democratic-controlled House last 
night rejected 248-180 President 
Reagan's proposal for $14 million in

Reagan also promised not to use the money for military aid until the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30. 
The House vote was the first of three on aid to the Contras, and the two remain:ng alternatives were ex­pected to be much closer when votes are taken today. 
One choice sponsored by House Democrats would require that the SI4 million be spent through the United Nations or the International Red Cross for Nicaraguan refugees and to enforce any peace negotiated by countries in the Central American reJtion. 
The second alternative, proposed by House Republican leader Robert Michel of Illinois and supported by the president, would give recogni­tion to the Contras by distributing non-lethal aid to them through the United States Agency for Interna­tional Development. 
In the Senate, 43 Republicans and I 0 Democrats voted for the Contra aid proposal; 3 7 Democrats and nine Republicans voted against. Sen. John East, R-N.C., did not vote because he is in the hospital.

Recipe for a good time: Watch hockey, enjoy 
An excerpt from my favorite cookbook: 
Take 12 slightly crazed French Canadians wielding longpieces oftimber. Adda slab ofice, a frozen rubber disc, and three men in zebra-striped shirts. Let stand for half a year, then gently stir in 15,000 noisy fanatics. As a final touch, add a dash of champagne from Lord Stanley's favorite mugfor incentive. 
That, for the uninitiated, is the formula for The Playoffs, National Hockey League style. For the last six months, the NHL's 21 teams have skated their way through 80 regular season games. Now it's time to find a champion. , 
The race for the right to drink from the Stanley Cup, hockey's equivalent of the Super Bowl, generates more excitement in Canada than a Billy Joel concert does at Notre Dame. But here in the States, hockey is only mar­ginally more popular than Walter Mondale. 
Part of the reason for all this hockey apathy may be ignorance. But with teams in 14 cities across the country and various cable "super systems" beaming games to virtually

around an oval roller rink, scoring points by cruising past opponents without getting knocked into the audience. It is a fairly violent sport, with ridiculous referees who ignore rule violations. 
Hockey rarely gets as silly as roller derby, but there are similarities. For instance, the average hockey player does not think twice before whacking an opponent across the shins with his stick, an act commonly known as slashing. And just as in roller derby, every time one player knocks another on his wallet the crowd goes 
wild. 
Granted, when things get 
dirty and the players start 
taking cheapshots, hockey becomes a parody of itself, as it was in the movie "Slapshot." But when played properly, it combines excitement and grace like no other sport around.

pong. 
Football is a different story. With bone-crunching blocks and tackles, it at· tracts basically the same type of person who goes to hockey games. But football games are only once a week, and the season ended way back in January. 

It isn't that hockey is hard to understand, either. In fact, hockey is quite simple ifit is looked at as a hybrid of soccer and roller derby. 
In theory, hockey is a lot like the intricate game of soccer. The purpose of soccer is to score a goal by maneuvering a ball around opponents and kicking it past a goaltender. The team with the most goals wins. Hockey is just about the same thing, except it's played on ice. Also, instead ofkicking a ball, hockey players use a stick to hit a piece offrozen vulcanized rubber called the puck. 
In practice, however, hockey often has more in com­mon with the rough'n'tumble sport ofroller derby. Rol­ler derby, for those who never called New York City home, is the ultimate in circus sports. Players skate there are other diversions,

Public involvement in environ­mental issues is the answer to En­vironmental Protection Agency effectiveness, said former EPA ad­ministrator William Ruckelshaus at last night's public talk in Washington Hall. 
The agency's first administrator in 1970 and fifth in 1984, following Ann Burford's resignation, con­trasted the issues facing the EPA in the 1970s with those of the 1980s. 
When the agency was formed in 1970, said Ruckelshaus, the United States faced serious environmental problems with conventional pol­lutants in air,land and water. 
"The people in Denver were desiring to see the mountains again while the people in L.A. were desir­ing to see each other," Ruckelshaus joked. 
The EPA was created to imple­ment the new environmental laws such as the Clean Water Act of 1972 which called for "fishable and swim­mabie" waters, said Ruckelshaus. 
"Great progress" was made with these conventional pollutants. Yet these issues were secondary to the newer, deadlier pollutants un­covered since the 1970s such as acid rain and toxic waste, he said. 
Ruckelshaus said these "second 
generation issues" are so much

these newer pollutants cause cancer and reproductive defects, definitive action by the EPA on these issues is complicated by the public's mistrust ofthe agency. 
Ruckelshaus explained the EPA is being sued by the public and in­dustry ''80 percent of the time" be­cause there are so many conflicting interests. 
The only way progress will be made is ifthe American people learn to trust that the EPA is doing the right thing. Ruckelshaus stressed the public must gain a level of under­standing ofthe environmental issues and the real options from which the EPA has to choose. 
It will take time before all of society recognizes the environment need not be exploited for economic growth, he said, but "we do not have that much time to get these pol­lutants under control in the context offreedom." 
The EPA needs to devise a system through legislation by which the people will be forced "to respond to the real choices," said Ruckelshaus.

paramilitary operations in Nicaragua." 
But Reagan promised in a letter delivered to Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole only a few hours before the vote that he would use the funds only for non-lethal purposes for the rest ofthe fiscal year ending Sept. 30. 
Despite Democratic skepticism about Reagan's intentions, Dole said, "I think we can trust the word ofthe president ofthe United States." 
Still to come late last night was a tougher challenge for Reagan in the Democratic-controlled House where the president's proposal to aid the Contras faced likely defeat. 
Reagan's letter was a surprise, and marked an open, last-minute effort to sway wavering senators and House members to his side in a highly-emotional legislative battle reminiscent of the early years of the Vietnam War era. 
"I think the president's letter was a carefully-crafted attempt to get bipartisan support," said Dole. 
As the debate closed, Vice Presi­dent George Bush -in his role as president ofthe Senate -was on hand in the event he was needed to break a tie vote. 
In his letter to Dole, Reagan said, "I intend to resume bilateral talks with the government of Nicaragua and will instruct our representatives in those talks to press for a cease-fire as well as (Roman Catholic) church­mediated dialogue between the con­tending Nicaraguan factions."

surveying students' drinking 
By MAE WHITEMAN 
News Staff 
Saint Mary's Alcohol Education Council is conducting a random­sample survey of 400 Saint Mary's students concerning drinking habits, but "Notre Dame's alcohol policy has nothing to do with our survey," said Pat Rissmeyer, the director of resident life and housing at the College. 
Council member Molly Sullivan said, "This is a follow-up survey. The first survey was taken in 1979. We want to find out about the drinking habits of our students and what our students need to know about al­cohol. For example, do our students realize that coffee does not sober a person?" 
The council plans to build a program more suited to students' needs. In the future, they may aid with family drinking problems or or­ganize non-alcoholic social programs. 
"We want to see what impact our previous program has had. It will give us hard data," Sullivan said. 
The surveying started at the beginning of this year, and surveys are due this Friday. 
The council hopes to have the data organized by the end of this semester since the programming Is being done by hand.

Gabreski was in Hawaii when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. 
In 1943, Gabreski was sent to England, and in 1944, he volun­teered to lead his squadron into Ger­many. After bombing an air field, he was forced to make a crash landing. He was a prisoner of war for 1 0 months.

He fought af­firmative action proposals, battled efforts to return prayer to public school, and exposed military sur­veillance of anti-war protesters and other dissenters during the Vietnam War era. 
His strict interpretation of the Constitution defied easy political classification. He sided with both liberals and conservatives in be­coming one of the chamber's most respected authorities on constitu­tional law. 
That independence made him a natural choice when Senate leaders cast about for someone to chair the sensitive and potentially explosive hearings on Watergate in the summer of 1973.

Gabreski said· he fought against "the eneinies of freedom" and for "the defense ofChristianity". He said that while war should only be used as a last resort, it should not be avoided when values of God and country are at stake. 
"Timely application of force of arms can be morally justified when other methods cannot. It comes down to a matter of civilization or no civilization". 
Gabreski said it was up to the stu­dents of universities such as Notre Dame to help insure peace in the future. He appealed to international law and negotiations, but said that too many times after a just war, "we have come away from negotiations without a piece ofthe peace table"

Engineers and scientists should also contribute to peace efforts. In times of national emergency, he said, "high technology has never failed us." He said the atomic bomb saved thousands of lives and that it was best for America to use it first because Hitler was so close to having it. 
Gabreski stressed faith in God and values of freedom and democracy. But he also stressed the need to defend these beliefs against other beliefs existing "where vodka and caviar flow freely and human minds do not".

Dispatcher Joe Watts said the hogs were being transported in a tractor-trailer rig driven by James Kemp, 24, of Spragueville, Idaho, when the truck collided with a Seaboard System train. The accident occurred about 5:30a.m. on U.S. 41 just south of the city, Watts said. 
"Approximately 219 hogs escaped from the stock trailer. A few hogs were dead at the scene and the rest are running loose," Watts said. 
He added that officials weren't sure exactly how many hogs were killed.

Conservatives should be happy with today's press 
There are many assumptions which are tossed around like facts. One such assumption is that there is a liberal bias in the press. 
Conservatives love to complain about Dan Rather's supposed harrassment of President 
Mark Boennighausen 
gravity is a myth 

Reagan. jesse Helms is so convinced that CBS is biased he wants a coalition ofconservatives to buy CBS's stock and thus become "Dan Rat­her's boss." Adding to the problem is the fact that even intelligent conservatives buy into this assumption. 
Last week at his lecture, I asked con­servative columnist James Kilpatrick about liberal bias in the press and he said that he thought there was such a slant. He did qualify his answer by only attaching the label to the "prestige press." Specifically, he mentioned CBS, The New York Times, and The Was­hington Post. He did not, however, offer any empirical evidence. 
For most conservatives there is no need for any evidence; they simplyknow that they are right. In two thoughtful essays in the latest issue of The New Republic, Fred Barnes and Michael Massing present evidence to refute this long held belief. The essays point out that there has been tremendous growth in what can be called the conservative press. 
Examples given include the births ofthe na­tional newspaper USA Today and the twenty­four hour cable news network CNN. Both of these relatively new news organizations are commonly viewed as more conservative than their older counterparts. The essays further point out that conservative are represented in what critics call the liberal press. For instance, conservative columnist George Will regularly appears in both Newsweek «nd The Was­hington Post. 
What is apparent from both esaays is the idea that the press will usually reflect the cur­rent politcal climate. And as any good liberal knows the times are definitely conservative now. The conservatives, however, are mired in the past and thus cannot forget the liberal press activism ofthe 1960s and early 1970s. If press critics would only look at what appears in print and on the televison screen they might not be so upset. Personally, I am sick of seeing Ronald Reagan at his ranch, trying to look like a macho cowboy, on the evening news every three weeks or so. The fact that he always says everything is going great adds to my disillusionment. I think the conservative point ofview gets plenty ofcoverage. 
Even college newspapers, once great bas­tions of liberalism and in some cases even

Maintenance and food departments praised 
DearEditor: 
I would just like to take this opportunity to publicly thank The University Food Services and University Maintenance Department, in particular Bill Hickey and John Manhaut, for their efforts during this years Collegiate jazz Festival. I found these two men extremely dedicated to serving students to the utmost of their abilities. In my dealings with them the past two years, it is clearly evident that the student events and needs rank at the top of their priority lists. I do not only appreciate their efforts as a way to make my job easier, but also appreciate them because they do so much to enhance the environment here at Notre Dame. 
' 

Hickey and Manhaut, and the departments they represent, are prime examples of this University's finest employees. 
I not only thank them but their staffs and workers who are just as helpful and pleasant. We are fortunate to benefit from their service. Thank you.

Students should respect the effort of Gideons 
DearEditor: 
I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Gideons. They put a great deal of effort into doing what they believe is right. For this reason they deserve commendation. 
However, this highlights a problem. Alot of things have been said about Notre Dame stu­dents, but now the addition of"wimps" to the list seems justified. The day the Bibles were distributed at the dining halls quite a few later ended up sitting on the tables or moving down the conveyor belt. Days later I was still seeing Bibles perched at convenient ledges around campus and in garbage cans. Why was this? Had people read it and then decided they did not want it? Not likely, considering almost everyone here has probably seen a Bible before. So then why were the Bibles all over campus? Because some students are wimps. When approached at the dining hall they were afraid of possibly hurting someone's feelings, or they just could not refuse a bargain or did not want to appear unholy by refusing a Bible. (It is like telling God to get lost, right?) So in­stead of having the guts to say the incredibly difficult phrase "no thank you," they accepted the gift, and with it the hard work and dedica­tion ofthe.Gideons. They managed to take the good achieved by others' hard work and turn it to waste; now there is a fine afternoon's 
work to be proud of. 
Maybe if guests on our campus are treated with a little more respect in the future, fewer 
negative things  will  be said  about  Notre  
Dame.

Stealing license plate does not make you cool 
DearEditor: 
To the person who stole the license plate "DOMER" off my car outside the University Club on Saturday afternoon, please think about the following. I obtained the plate in the first place to display my pride in the Univer­sity and the type of student here. I find it ironic that a student at the same institution tries to display his pride by stealing my plates. One motive behind this act of thievery probably was to be cool. Do you think it is cool to know that I have to go out and replace the personalized plate at a cost of $60, plus go through the hassle of obtaining it? Your only use for the plate now is selfish gratification for display in a room. Are you proud of the fact that you are a thief and the plate is now on your wall? Are you now cool? 
As a graduating senior I would like the plate returned. Think about it!

DearEditor: 
As a senior, I look forward to graduating next month for many reasons, both positive and negative. Hard work finally pays off; anot­her summer of fun and sun awaits me; and there is a new step in my life on the horizon: law school. Yet life is not heaven on earth, and neither is Notre Dame. No one, nor any in­stitution, is perfect. There are, as a result, many things I will not miss when I leave Notre Dame. 
The 
dining halls' "insult a nationality" evenings when dinners are devoted to themes denigrating certain ethnic groups by serving food which the groups would be embarrassed to call their own. 

The 
ground crew's destruction of the quads by cutting lawns that have just been rained upon for hours. 

U-93's 
"Street Talk" interviews at University Park Mall, when locals with small-sized brains attempt to discuss such topics as nuclear weapons and Gerry Faust (a perfect couple, don't you think, since they both signify devastation -whether its object is the world or a proud tradition). 


Ruthless and dumb administrative athletic decisions made by Father Joyce under the guise ofsome farce ofa committee. 

Mushrooms, 
particularly those served by the dining halls in every dish that could con­ceivably have a vegetable in it. 

The 
weather in northern Indiana (need I say more?). 


A student government torn by conflicts of self-interest and pride. 

The 
24 hour-a-day freak show in the LaFortune lobby. 


Rules in increasing numbers which tighten the stranglehold around student necks, but enforced ostensibly for our own well-being. 

The 
on-going, slow, jockeying for position 


radicalism, have become conservative. A per­fect example is The Observer. There are now daily quotes, usually endorsing conservative views, on its editorial page. Furthermore, there was The Observer's endorsement for the re-election of a conservative president who eliminated college students' social security benefits in his first term and is now threatening to drastically curtail the Govern­ment Student Loan program in his second term. 
It seems that Helms and his friends should 
be more than satisfied with the current state 
of affairs. Maybe it is now time for liberals to 
yell and scream about a conservative bias in 
the press.

He upheld both the trade bet­ween Minnesota and Houston that gave the Vikings the first crack at Kosar in next Tuesday's regular col­lege draft, and the deal between the Browns and the Buffalo Bills that gave Cleveland Kosar's rights in a supplemental draft. 
That left the decision squarely in the hands of Kosar, who has two yeacs ofcollege eligibllty left but has said he intends to complete his studies this summer.

lnterhall season nears its end with many teaiDs fighting for victory 
By FRANK HUEMMER 
Sports Writer 

With final exams fast approaching, interhall actvities are in full swing. Teams are giving it one last shot to go all the way and win the various tournaments and divisions. 
Only four teams remain in the 22­team open soccer round-robin tournament. In the Backs Division, Holy Cross dribbled around l.S.O. for a 2-0 victory and the division crown. Meanwhile, Zahm was able to streak by Dick Addis by a 1-0 score to win the Strikers Division. These two teams will play Monday at 7 p.m. on Cartier Field to earn the right to play the winner ofthe Wings Division. Awful Lawful and Missing Faculties will tangle for the Wings' title at 7 p.m. Thursday on Cartier. 
In fast-paced indoor soccer ac­tion, two off-campus teams battled it out for the championship. In the end, it was Zuber's Entourage out­lasting the Pumas to claim the title. 
In women's soccer, Lewis ( 4-0) is leading the league, but Pasquerilla West remains close behind at 3-1. Breen-Phillips and Badin both have a legitimate shot to catch these two teams, as they sport 2-1 records. Lyons ( 1-2), Walsh ( 1-3 ), Farley ( 1­3) and Pasquerilla East ( 0-4) round out the eight teams in the tourna­ment. 
One sport that is growing quickly in popularity is lacrosse. Everyday one can go outside, enjoy the sun­shine and see lacrosse sticks twirling in the air. Interhalllacrosse competi­tion is fierce, however. Holy Cross has been tearing up the Blue Jay Division as it has defeated all three of its opponents. Following close be­hind are Howard and Morrissey, both at 2-1. Carroll ( 1-1 ), Dillon ( 0­
2) and St. Ed's (0-3) complete the Blue Jay Division. "The playoff competition will be very tough," Greg Abbott, Holy . Cross captain, said, "because of the balance ofthe other division." 
The Terrapin Division shows four 
teams with excellent opportunities 
to capture the top spot. Keenan, Off­
Campus, Cavanaugh and Flanner all 
are 2-1, while Grace ( 1-2) and Zahm 
(0-3) fill out the rest of the division. 
The upcoming games will play a sig­
nificant role in determining who 
will capture the lacrosse title. 
Beside the heated contact of 
Lacrosse, the summer sounds of 
baseball can be heard in the air all 
around the Notre Dame campus. Six 
teams still are competing in the round-robin tournament. This week's action features a showdown between Holy Cross and Stanford A­I in the Kaline Division finals at 4:30 today. ' 
"They (Holy Cross) present a problem because they can score a bunch of runs," Stanford captain Tony Dawson said. "The first five batters can all put the ball out ofthe park. 
Holy Cross's captain Greg Abbott agreed that the Stanford-Holy Cross matchup will be a good one. 
"It will be a tough game," Abbott said, "but we have played tough defensively, have shown solid hit­ting and, so far, phenomenal pitch­ing." 
In the Mantle Division, teams from Morrissey and Flanner battled it out yesterday. 
Finally, in the Ruth Division, Keenan lll and Grace I will be playing for the division champion­ship at 4:30p.m. tomorrow. 
"All the remaining teams are quite competitive and have the capabilities to win the tournament," Keenan coach Jay Palma said. 
Whatever your sport is, you are sure to find plenty of action as the interhall competition really begins to heat up. 

Yung works for Belle tennis team 
By CHRISTINE FORTIN 
Sports Writer 

The Saint Mary's tennis team will host Notre Dame for a challenging match this afternoon, and will depend greatly on the talents of senior Renee Yung, who has con­tributed much to the team over the year so far. 
Yung, a native ofGenoa City, Wis­consin, has been playing tennis since seventh grade and has been teaching tennis for five years. In high school, Yung played varsity tennis all four years. She was named an all­American player for two of those years, and became team captain her senior year. 
Her decision to attend Saint Mary's was based on two major fac­tors. She wanted to attend a school with high academic standards that also offered a fine tennis program. Yung turned down a tennis scholar­ship offer from Flagstaff University in Arizona to attend Saint Mary's and says she has absolutely no regrets. 
She currently holds the No. 5 
Balancing the responsibilities of being a varsity team member, an R.A. and a student can make for a rather hectic schedule, but Yung does not find it burdensome. 
"It gets difficult at times," she ex­plained, "but everything I'm doing I enjoy. And I've learned to schedule my time well." 
She was named most improved player for the Belles her freshman year. Although a senior, this is only to play tennis so she could devote her time to her studies. She has anot­her semester yet to go atSaint Mary's and intends to play with the Belles during the upcoming fall season. 
She feels her role on the team is no different from anyone else's, which is to play as well as possible for the team. Sophomore Caroline Zern, Yung's doubles partner reinforces Yung's concern for the team. 
"Renee is a very supportive, team­oriented player," commented Zern. "Her main objective is to help out the team in any way she can." 
"The whole team is working very hard," commented Yung, preoc­cupied with the thought of the na­tional championships, which will be held in Kansas City, Missouri, in late May. 
She added that while she has her mind in every match she plays, she is also thinking about improving and gaining confidence for nationals. 
"(Coach) Jo-Ann (Nester) has scheduled a lot of good teams this season to prepare us (for nation­als)," she said. "I am very much looking forward to nationals." 
The Belles will be hosting the Irish at 3:00 this afternoon. And Yung most definitely has some goals set for the match. 
"We want to beat Notre Dame," 
she said. "Stroke for stroke I feel we 
are as good as they are. We're all 
looking forward to this match." 

singles and No. 2 doubles positions for the Belles. She feels most com­fortable playing doubles because that is the position she played in high school. However, she enjoys playing singles, too, and feels she is learning more with every match she plays.

sixth round of the tournament. Armed and Dangerous Ill fell victim to WBBS, 21-13, at 6:15 on Stepan 3. 
WBBS jumped out to a 9-2 lead, but A and D came within two at 12­
10. Three consecutive outside jumpers for WBBS put the game out of reach, then. Mike "Hopper" Crowley hit nine of his 10 shots for the winners, while Dave Taiclet canned 6-of-9 for A and D. 
A lot of people passed up Hun­garian Noodle Bake at the dining hall to see Tofu Vegetables I on Stepan 1 at 5:00. They were not disappointed, as both the noodle bake and the Veggies lived up to expectations. The stir-fried freshmen from Alumni ran Phi Runna Gunna off the court, 21-12. Bill ZadeH hit 7-of-11 and teammate Paul Reuvers pitched in 6­of-7 for the winners. Andy Reardon went 4-of-7 for the losing fraternity.

Guys Better Than John Paxson con­tinued to roll yesterday, knocking off Keenan Inmates; 21-13, on Bookstore 10 at 5:00. Ken Schuer­man paced the winners with 1 0-of­19 shooting, while Rick Bliha hit 5-of-23 for the Keenan residents. 
Another crisis hit Ethiopia yester­day, as the last Ethiopian teams in Bookstore XIV bowed out of com­petition. Josephus and the Ethiopian Shim Sham was knocked out by First Source Bank Travelling All Stars and Motor Kings, 21-1 7, on Stepan 2 at 
6:15. Dan Duff led the All Stars with 10points on 17 attempts, whileJohn Reilly hit 6-of-12 for the Ethiopians. 
Five Ethiopians Hungry To Win were starved on Lyons 12 at 5:00 by Dangling Manhood. Joe Howard's 9­of-15led the 21-of-39 winners to the victory, 21-12. Dan Johnston went 4-of-14 in the Ethiopians' losing ef­fort. 
A large, boisterous crowd gat­hered around Bookstore 9 at 6:15, when Let's Go Crazy met Revenge Factor. The crazies took a small lead early in the contest and held on to win, 21-14. Steve Nicgorski canned 8-of-14 from the field and hauled down 11 boards to lead the winners. Paul Schoner went 5-of-1 5 and grabbed six rebounds for Revenge Factor. 

A smaller, more subdued crowd kept time as two Rhythm Methods battled on Bookstore 10 at 6:15. The pre-tournament naming ofthe teams proved correct, as Rhythm Method {I) beat Rhythm Method II, 21-17. The two teams were neck-and-neck for most of the game, but the better Method pulled ahead at 16-14 and never looked back again. John Sheehan hit 8-of-18 for the winning Method, and joe Butkovich went 6­of-12 for the second Method. 
Other fifth-round winners were Showtime, Four Dingleberries and a Kresgie, Red Barons, Jimmy G. and the Spots, Rousseau's Noble Savages and Tequila White lightn­ing. 
The Sweet Sixteen will pair off today on the asphalt ofLyons and the bookstore. All games start at 5:00 or 6:15.

lbe Notre Dame baseball team split a doubleheader with the Flyers ofLewis University yesterday, hiking its record to 16-22-1 in the process. After losing the first game by a score of 9-4, the Irish bounced back to take an impressive I 1-'5 victory in game 2. 
In the first game, Irish pitcher Dan Sacchini ( 1-2) lasted only two-thirds of an inning, giving up four walks and three runs. Lewis never trailed in the game as pitcherjohn Rifnstuhl threw all seven innings for the Flyers, yielding only four runs on eight hits. 
The Irish trailed 9-1 going into the seventh inning, when senior john Murphy hit a pinch-hit solo homerun and junior Tom Shields belted a two run homer. Although the Irish lost the game, their dor­mant bats were beginning to come alive. 
The hitting continued in the second game as the Irish exploded

The injuries which decimated the 
Notre Dame linebacking corps last 
year may not have been a total waste 
after all. 

The fact that several raw talents 
emerged into capable players with 
the experience granted because of 
those injuries means that the Irish 
linebacking crop should be an ex­
tremely deep and effective bunch 
for this year's campaign. 

So far through the 1985 spring 
season, the packed squad of healthy 
linebackers has shown much of that 
expected depth and talent. And that 
Is a good sign for the Irish, because 
the success ofthe four linebackers in 
the 3-4 defensive alignment will be 
an integral factor in the overall 
success of the defense. 

Overseeing the progress of the 
linebackers during the spring 
practice sessions are Irish assistant 
coaches George Kelly and Bishop 
Harris. Harris, in his second year of 
duty on the Irish staff after a brief 
stint as an assistant at Louisiana State 
University, handles the outside 
linebackers, while the 16-year 
veteran, Kelly, watches over on the 
inside. 

Kelly's players at the inside 
linebacker position are called upon 
not only to make tackles but to con­
tain the running game and take away 
the short pass as well. 

"The inside linebacker has to be 
adept at covering the short pass and 
playing the run," says Kelly. "They 
should be the leading tacklers." 

Kelly's prize pupil of the bunch, 
6-2, 231 lb. Tony Furjanic, led the 
entire squad in tackles in 1983, but 
ligament damage in his leg kept him 
out of action for most of the '84 
season. Furjanic, who still managed 
to finish fifth in tackles for the year, 
has the added responsibility this 
year of being one of the four Irish 
captains, as well as the defensive 
signal-caller in the huddle. 

"Tony (Furjanic) is an outstand­
ing football player," says Kelly. "He's 
also assumed the position of leader­
sl\ip with aU the authority with 
which I thought he would." 

Although junior all-America can­didate Furjanic has been the anchor in the middle for the Irish this spring, his injury last season allowed a few other players to stake an ex­perienced claim to the back-up role. 
Among those players who are seeing action this spring in the middle are juniors Dave Butler and John McCabe. McCabe, a 6-3, 228lb. native of Arlington Heights, Ill., saw action in every game last season for 16 hits and 1 1 runs. The Irish scored in each of the first five in­nings, and led 11-1 at that point. 
Junior pitcher Mark Wauke (2-2) collected the win for the Irish as he threw six innings and gave up only three earned runs. Senior Jason Schomer came on in relief and was awarded the save. For the Flyers losing pitcher Pat McKune was pulled in the second inning after giving up five runs. 
The big bats for the Irish in game two belonged to senior captain Jackie Moran and sophomore John Loughran. Moran was 4-for-5 and scored three times, while Loughran collected three hits on four at-bats. 
One of Moran's runs was batted in by junior Rich Vanthournout, on a record-tying line drive hit to center­field. The hit was Vanthournout's 56th of the season, tying the record set by Mike Metzler last year. 
The Irish moved to 16-22-l with the win, while the Flyers fell to 30­
15. Notre Dame will travel to Ohio today to face Bowling Green in anot­her non-conference doubleheader. 
after making the switch from nose tackle. Although McCabe played rat­her well in filling in for his injured teammates, his progress has been slowed this spring by nagging in­juries. The 6-3, 221 lb. Buder, meanwhile, saw less action than did McCabe, but has made significant strides this spring toward getting some more playing time in the fall. 
To the side ofthese players will be another inside linebacker -the strong side linebacker. As ofthis mo­ment, 6-2, 218 lb. Mike Kovaleski and 6-3, 227 lb. Ron Weissenhofer are neck-and-neck in the race. 
Kovaleski, who broke his col­larbone earlier in the year and who 
Spring Football 
sCI'85 
is sitting out the spring drills, would 
seem to be the favorite for the posi­
tion. After aU, the sophomore led the 
team in tackles by a wide margin last 
year despite the fact that he was able 
to start only eight games because of 
various minor injuries. Still, Kelly 
feels that Kovaleski's injury this 
spring may have impeded his 
development to a significant degree. 
"Mike Kovaleski has started for us 
the past two years," says Kelly. "But 
he could have improved even more 
ifhe had not been hurt this spring." 
Weissenhofer, meanwhile, has missed quite a few games over the past two seasons because of nagging injuries. This year, he finally has been healthy for a spring session, and the chance to play has paid off so far for the junior from Oak Lawn, Ill. 
"There will be a battle between W eissenhofer and Kovaleski for the position," notes Kelly. "Weissenhofer was out for almost a year and a half as a result of injuries, but he's really starting to get back into the groove now, and he's impressing us." 
Playing admirably behind Weis­senhofer this spring has been 6-5, 210 lb. freshman Weslt:y Pritchett. 
"Pritchett is one freshman that has certainly emerged this spring," adds Kelly. "I think the injury to Kovaleski has allowed him to get all the work which he needed. It's con­ceivable that the strong side will be split up to make room for Wesley in the fall." 
Also seeing action this spring at the inside linebacker spots are 6-1, 195 lb. freshman Greg Harris, and 6­

All in all, Kelly seems pleased with the play ofhis inside men this spring, but he notes that many ofthese com­binations are subject to change. 
"This has been a very good spring for us inasmuch as we've had so many more players missing in the past," notes Kelly. "The fact that so many have been able to participate this spring has given us a better look at the depth. 
"It's difficult these days for one set of linebackers to play the entire game. We have much more con­fidence this spring in the backup people." 
Confidence is what Bishop Harris must have felt when he looked at his array of experienced outside linebackers this spring. He saw returning starters Robert Banks and Rick DiBernardo, top-substitute Cedric Figaro, and newcomer Mike Larkin, who moved over to the outside after starting at the inside linebacker last season. 
Actually, Harris has seen little this spring of the 6-3, 238 lb. DiBer­nardo. The junior from Garden Grove, Cal., had surgery recently on his wrist, and is expected to remain out of action until the fall. But, then again, Harris has already seen DiBer­nardo's 30 tackles last season, and he knows his extensive capabilities. 
"DiBernardo will definitely play a major role," says Harris. "He played an awful lot for us last fall, and we'll count on him heavily again this year." 
The 6-1, 221 lb. Larkin, meanwhile, has used the spring to its fullest to reacclimate himself to the same outside position where he had worked last spring. Injuries to key personnel on the inside, however, forced Larkin to abandon the experi­ment and move back over to his old position. 
Harris, meanwhile, has been quite impressed with the quickness and attitude ofhis defensive stalwart. 
"Mike was behind the others com­ing into the spring," says Harris. "The only experience he had at outside was all from practice. But 
he's  a  quality  athlete,  and  he's  
responded well."  
Harris  sees  Larkin  as  the "big­ 

play" type of player. Larkin, who is also a captain on the squad this year, showed this in the fall by connecting on 39 tackles in an injury-shortened season. 
"Mike has the knack for making things happen," adds Harris. "He just has to continue to work hard." 
Rounding out the situation at the outside are 6-5, 234 lb. sophomore

Robert Banks, and 6-3, 2351b. fresh­man Cedric Figaro. 
Banks has seen a great deal of ac­tion this spring, and he has continued to play like he did in the fall when he started all II contests and registered 68 tackles. 
"Banks improved every game last year," notes Harris, "and he has a great attitude this spring. He's a much-improved player." 
Harris has even more inspiring words for Figaro, who made 30 tackles last year while filling in for injured starters. 
"Figaro is probably one ofthe best freshman in the nation," says Harris. "He has the potential to be a great player. He just has to keep working hard like he has in the spring so far." 
6-3, 190 lb. freshman Darrel Gor­don and 6-4, 200 lb. sophomore Lee Ritzau also have played some downs this spring at the position. 
Inside and outside, this spring the Fighting Irish appear to have the quality athletes and the necessary depth.

Exciting action marks yesterday's play as Bookstore field cut to 16 
By PHIL WOLF 
Assistant Sports Editor 

Most of the games were not as dose as might be expected this far into the tournament, but the fifth round of Book.~tore Basketball XIV did have its e~citing moments yes­terday. 
There were a few close contests, a couple blowouts and some great in­dividual efforts. There was crowd support and referee abuse. And there was some good basketball as the "Sweet Sixteen" emerged from the original field of 560 teams. 
One of the most closely contested games of the day was on Stepan 4 at 5:00, when The Chairmen of the Boards met Four Fags and a Zahmbie. It took 22 points, but the Howard-Zahm combination put the Chairmen out of the tournament with excellent outside shooting. The winners outshot their op-· ponents, 22-of-38 to 20-of-45. 
Zahmbie Chris Campilii hit 6-of-7 for his team, while Howard's Dan Michelini went 6-of-10. Jeff jones was 6-of-1 5 for the Chairmen, and teammate Dan Kerrigan pegged 6­of-16. 
The Board members were able to outrebound the freshmen, l 7-16. Howard's john Patino hit all four of 
t\1?\ Bookstore 
\ffi7-,, \ / / XIV /..----;. --:;_; \ //
' . tiD' '/ 
his shots, while Chairman Dave Det­mer was a perfect 3-of-3. 
The next game on Stepan 4 pitted Mr. Coffey and the Non Dairy Creamers against Revenge of the Fun Bunch at 6:1 5. To say that the Creamers got creamed would be as inaccurate as saying that the Fun Bunch had a fun day of basketball yesterday (not to mention that the puns are getting worn out). At the end of the hard-fought game, it was the Fun Bunch that was victorious, 21-18. 

Matt Dingens paced the winners with 7-of-13, while Eric janowsky hussled his way to nine points on 18 attempts for the Creamers. The Fun Bunch hit 21-of-45 as a team, while the losers made 18-of-44. The Bunch had a 27-13 rebound advantage. 
Uncoachables could have used a little assistance from the sidelines yesterday on Stepan 2 at 5:00. Weethy's Warriors won that battle, 21-15, with a 26-19 margin on the boards and some good shooting. Keith Sawayda hit half of his 20 shots, mostly from the outside, for the Warriors and pulled down seven rebounds. Allyn Morris hit 6-of-8 and crashed the boards successfully six times. Scott Veselick got inside well to hit 6-of-12 and grabbed seven rebounds for the coachless losers.

Eight teams advance in Women's Bookstore; action continues today 
By MICHAEL FlANNERY 
Sports Writer 

Four of the 'Elite Eight' have been chosen. Four others will make it today. But those teams who were victorious yesterday won't have long to celebrate. The women's 1985 Bookstore Tournament is win­ding down to a furious finish. 
Four games played yesterday pitted 'Sweet Sixteen' teams against each other, with the winners gaining aspot in the final eight-team bracket. Yesterday's four other winners merely gained entrance into the 'Sweet Sixteen', and will face each ot­her today to advance to the round of eight. 
To start, let's look at the games which completed the 'SweetSixteen.  
On Stepan 1, 2 Enlightened Souls, 2 Healers and an Embezzler Who Play Hoops did indeed show up to play, but without much success. Going All the Way had little trouble handling this motley crew, 21-11, as Kathy lmmonen hit 5-of-13 and Theresa Schwebel hit 5-of-9 in the 15-4 victory. Meghan Flattery also 
chipped in, canning 4-of-6. jackie 
Kennedy and Susie Baker  were  a  
combined 2-for-18 for the losers.  
3  Wenches,  A  Smick,  and  a  

Hatchet weren't enough to stop Negligence. Renee Lanam made seven of 22 shots and Yvonne Brad­ley shot 10-for-34 for Negligence as they posted a 21-13 victory. Mary Langer (6-17) and Sarah Molinsky (6-20) led 3 Wenches, etc. 
Balanced scoring helped Five Women Who Want to Go All the Way (and Play B-Ball, too) crush Why?, 21-17. 5-5-4-4-3 scoring was more than enough to offset Why?'s combined 7-of-27. Even better, 4 of the Five Women... shot better than 50 percent. 
The best game of the day oc­curred on Stepan 4 at 4:00. Does on Their Own went into overtime to beat The Violent Femmes, 23-21. Mary Ellen Mileski ( 6-11) and Laura Gleason (6-12) helped tame their fortnidable opponent. Mary Borkowski might have changed the outcome if she had shot better than 4-22. jane Weldon carried the losers, hitting 1 0-of-19. 

The other four games yesterday were for a spot in the 'Elite Eight.' 
The Quixotic Quint proved they could do more than battle windmills as they beat We Shave Points but Not for Drugs, 21-14. Reggie Richter dominated the game, hitting 13-of­24 to lead her team. Karen Phelps ( 5-19) and Beth Nolan ( 4-9) led the losers. 
Foul Trouble squeaked by Slam­mers 21-18 on Bookstore l 0. Carrie Bates did most of the damage for the winners. She canned an impressive 12-of-16 shots. Heather Koch bombed away all day for Slammers but only came up with eight points after taking 30 shots. 
On Lyons 11, the DUI's crushed Skippies Need Not Apply, 21-7. Nancy Fitzpatrick hit 7-of-15 to lead the assault. jackie Gibbons shot 4-14 in a losing cause. 
On Lyons 12, RTHBKA rolled over The Dialectics, 21·2. RTHBKA were led by Dava Newman, who threw in 8-of-1 7 shots. The Dialectics should have stayed home. They managed only 12 shots for the game.
