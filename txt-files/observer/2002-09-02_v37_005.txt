Students hope game sets tone for season 

BylAUREN BECK News Wrirer 

Cautious optimism turned to euphoria Saturday night among Notre Dame football fans after a 22-0 Irish victory over Maryland in the Kickoff Classic. 
The general mood on campus following the game in East Rutherford, N.J., was one See Also 
of hope and 

excitement as "Irish fans pack s t u d e n t s Meadowlands" looked ahead to the remain-page 4 
ing 11 games on the football schedule. 

"I knew the game was going to set the tone for the season, and that was the tone I wanted it to set," said sophomore Matthew Poetzinger. 
Poetzinger hoped the team's showing would increase fan support in the upcoming games. 
"Last year, it seemed like peo­ple were going to the Stadium to watch the Irish lose, but that won't be happening now. I see an attitude change among the fan base," he said. 
For freshmen Joe McFarlane and Mike Ragsdale, Saturday's game was the perfect start to the next four years of watching Irish football. 
''I'm proud· to be a part of the Irish after their excellent show­ing," McFarlane said. "They played better than I expected. They played with more spirit ... they really wanted to win." 
Ragsdale said he was sur­prised by the team's perfor­mance, considering Notre Dame's absence from the pre­season polls. 
"It was great to witness the first shutout by a new coach at Notre Dame in almost 50 years," he said about Tyrone Willingham's first game at the helm ofthe team. 
Upperclassmen were also optimistic about the new sea­son, citing the improvements they saw from last year. Several credited \Villingham's leader­ship and work ethic for the team's new look and attitude. 
"I could tell when seeing new plays and new strategy that it's a different team," said senior Katherine Karrat. "There are things they still need to work on, but I think we'll.have a better season than expected as they continue to practice." 
Senior George Salib said the Irish were more exciting to watch Saturday than last season as they brandished Willingham's West Coast offen­sive scheme. 
Christine Bryant, also a senior, said she was impressed by Willingham's hard-working

While the dollar may not get the average college back­packer as far in Europe as it used to, the sluggish travel industry has not affected Notre Dame and Saint Mary's local travel agent, Anthony

INSIDE COLUMN 



It's time for 

online 
8 a.m., first official day of class. Do you remember where you were? For some, you might have been in class, and for others, you might have been struggling to catch those last minutes of much-needed early-morning Kiflin Turner sleep. As for myself, I was 
Associate 
standing in line at 
News Editor 
the Stadium along 
with hundreds of 
other students waiting to receive tick­ets for an undeniably exciting football 
season. 
Some were disgruntled and a little peeved, while others were just lethar­gic. There were a handful of cheery enthusiasts, but they were the minori­ty. In fact, I blame their giddiness on the donuts and orange juice. While the refreshments were a nice consolation, the wait was a little less than tasty. The lingering debate on football ticket distribution is here yet again, but this time, there's a feasible plan to back up the complaints. Implementing an electronic ticket distribution system as an option would be a much better alternative to waiting in line to pay and show an ID. 
I know there's the age-old tradition of waiting in line with all of your bud­dies in anticipation of receiving some of the most prized and coveted college football season tickets in the country, but it would be a lot more efficient if this were made optional. OK. here's the plan: We keep the lottery system -it's fair and everyone gets her own unique, allocated number. 
Notre Dame sets up an electronic ticket system. along the lines of IrishLink, and at your appointed time, based on year and lottery number, you go online and get your tickets. At enrollment, students can show their ID, turn in their ticket application with their social security number, and receive a number. Before the drawing, the system would have already recorded both the unique lottery num­ber and the matching social security number for each student to ensure authentication. At your appointed time, type in your social, your lottery number and choose whatever is avail­able for yourself as well as your group of friends. And payment, no problem, through a secured server you can pay by credit or check. If cash is your thing, then you can pay in advance, or at enrollment even. Advance payment would be noted in the system, so that when a student wanted to pick tickets at a later date, they would just need to provide their social and lottery num­ber. 
But no worries to all of you die-hard fans who still want to wait it out in front of the Stadium during the wee hours of the morning. If that's your thing, then you can do it with other like-minded individuals and carry on the torch of tradition. For others, standing in line all morning is not a testament to show how much of an Irish fan they are. Real fans cheer half-naked in sub-zero weather, eat­ing cold brats until they can't feel their feet. But I suppose everyone has his own definition.

Media exhibition opens at Moreau Galleries 
By SARAH NESTOR News Writer 

The Moreau Galleries opens its 2002-2003 season with a thought-provoking exhibit by artist Greg Pond, assistant professor of art at the University of the South. 
.. Beyond the Hedge" is a multimedia exhibit that merges nature with modern devices, such as DVD players, the hull of a car, and compact disc players. 
"I am interested in American mythology and the related concepts of westward expansion, regeneration through violence, and cultural attitudes towards landscape," Pond said in his artist statement. "It is the landscape that largely influences our collec­tive mythology, creates its narrative and heroes such as John Wayne and Daniel Boone." 
His piece "Crickets" is composed of an aluminum basket filled with grass and dirt connected to electronic sound boards that produce the sounds of crickets. 
"Fox skinning" is among his more disturb­ing pieces, wherein a bowl of fox skins sur­rounds a small DVD player displaying the actual process of a fox skinning. The exhibit contrasts the image of the brutal nature of a fox being skinned against the gentleness of the soft skins placed in the bowl. 
"The wilderness is seen as the place of the terrible unconsciousness and must neces­sarily be replaced by systems of order," Pond said. "Through compressing history and cultures, altering the pace of time and distorting the physical scale, I seek to por­tray a psychological rather than social or material realism." 
This first display of the season will remain in the Moreau Galleries through Sept. 26, and the gallery is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Irish fans pack Meadowlands

News Editor 
Hundreds of students packed their belongings on Thursday and Friday into vehicles en route to the East Coast to sup­port the Notre Dame football team. Upon their return, stu­dents said the road trip raised school spirit.

Students said the road trip was a fun way to begin the school year with friends. 
"We've been gone all sum­mer," Smith said, adding that the trip was still "mostly for the football team." 
Trips to other states for Notre Dame football games are noth­ing new. Traditionally, students have traveleq to Purdue or Michigan schools to see Notre Dame play, and even Florida or California for a warm weather game over fall break.

through Anthony Travel. 
Anthony reports that there has been a 15 percent drop in Point A to Point B travel but these gaps have been filled with new clients. They are cur­rently in discussion with two other universities. 
Another factor contributing to Anthony Travel's success is their excellent reputation among students and parents. 
"I think there's a comfort fac­tor for the parents to be able to call us up and order their traveled to last year's first foot­ball game against Nebraska, said road trips are good for stu­dents to see other parts of the country and have fun regardless of the record. 
"You've got to support them through thick and thin," Newrones said. 
Nevertheless. students said the victory has given them a renewed school spirit. Newrones, who did not attend this past weekend's game but watched it on television, said he learned from Nebraska fans the power of packing of stadium. The infamous game in the fall of 2000 made Notre Dame's 
Notre Dame 
home game. 
"I think it's good to try to invade opposing teams' stadi­ums," Newrones said. 
The students who returned from the game said they have a renewed sense of team spirit and look forward to the upcom­ing season. 
Smith said Willingham has made a difference. 
"I think there's a lot of excite­ment regarding the new coach and the program, and I think a lot of people are really pumped up about it," Smith said. 
Fellow junior Rob Falk agreed and complimented Willingham on his confidence.

Anthony Travel also does extensive research for the ever-scandalous spring break deals that have scammed unsuspecting college kids time and again. 
"We find reputable trips that may not necessarily be the cheapest but may be the best value for the quality and the price," he said.

Regardless, the Irish victory restored fans' faith in Notre Dame football and gave them hope for the rest of the season. 
"I think we have more confi­dence now, win or lose," said sophomore Dennis Idawu. "We're all behind [Willingham]. and we believe in him." 
Salib said Saturday set a pos­itive tone for what he hopes will be a memorable final foot­ball season at Notre Dame. 
"I can't imagine how crazy the Stadium will be, with spirit from both the fans and players. I'm looking forward to that."

attitude. 

"You would think a coach up at the half would be pleased, but when they interviewed Willingham at halftime ... he wasn't settling. He's tough, and that's what we need. We seemed more together and solid," she said. 
Some students, such as junior Chrissy Maher, are hop­ing for a bowl game appear­ance from the Irish after the outcome ofSaturdays' game. 
"I was optimistic before the game, with a new coach and a fresh start, and I'm even more excited now," she said. 
But students also recognized that they couldn't get their hopes up too high, too early, especially with a tough sched ­ule that includes Michigan, Michigan State and Florida State. 
"We can't get too hyped after the first game," said Bryant. "We have to keep our hopes up high, but don't expect a cham­pionship this year" 
Salib added, "There is cer­tainly reason to be optimistic, but it's easy for fans to get ahead of themselves. The team is showing promise, but there are things we need to work on."

CANADA 
Health officials suspect West Nile virus in Ontario 
Associated Press 
TORONTO 

Ontario health officials said Friday they believe three people sick in the province have the West Nile virus, which would be Canada's first human cases of the mosquito-born illness that has killed 24 people in the United States this year. 
Colin D'Cunha, the Ontario chief medical officer, said final confirmation would take another two weeks. 
Ontario is Canada's most populous province, and is across the border from 
U.S. states where the virus has been reported. 
If the three have the virus, it would document the continuing spread of West Nile throughout North America. Several U.S. states -including North Dakota, Iowa, Arkansas and South Carolina -have reported their first human cases this week of a virus that can cause fever, body aches. brain swelling, coma, paralysis or death. 
Canadian officials have warned in recent years that the virus, which has been detected in birds and animals in Canada, eventually would spread to the human population. It is transmitted to humans by mosquito bites. 
Dr. David McKeown, the medical health officer for the Peel region west of Toronto, said two of the probable cases involved people over 65 from the Mississauga area. 
One remains hospitalized in serious condition and another was hospitalized and then released to recover at home, McKeown said. 
There was little information immedi­ately available about the third case, but D'Cunha said authorities believe the person became sick in the United States. 
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 24 people have died across the country so far this year from the virus, with almost 500 cases reported in more than 20 states. 
The virus is most dangerous for chil­dren, the elderly and people with weak immune systems. It can cause flu-like symptoms and encephalitis, a potential­ly fatal brain infection. Most people bit­ten by an infected bug never get sick. 
West Nile is common in Africa and the Middle East. The disease was first detected in the United States in 1999, when seven people died from it in New York. 
WORLD NEWS BRIEFS 
Fox admits falling short of promises: 
Facing a country impatient for change, a humbled President Vicente Fox acknowledged Sunday that he still had work to do in achieving the sweeping reforms he promised two years ago when he toppled Mexico's entrenched political elite. In his second state-of-the-nation address late Sunday, Fox admit­ted that he hadn't achieved as much as he had hoped and pleaded with Congress to help him create the new Mexico he outlined during his campaign. 
Israeli soldier retaliate on Palestinians: 
Israeli soldiers. saying they had been warned of an attack, shot and killed four Palestinians near a Jewish settlement's vineyard in the West Bank on Sunday. The shootings brought the weekend Palestinian death toll to 13, including two children and several other civilians. Senior Israeli officials apologized for the loss of civilian lives, while Palestinians and some Israelis charged t~~ army has lost its sense of restraint. 
NATIONAL NEWS BRIEFS 
California wildfire forces evacuation: 
A wildfire spread rapidly across 10,000 acres of national forest Sunday, sending thousands of holi­day campers fleeing. The fire was burning in the Azusa Canyon area of the Angeles National Forest about 30 miles east of Los Angeles. About 8,000 campers were told to evacuate campgrounds. "This was a holiday weekend and the canyon was full of people," state Department of Forestry dispatcher James Arthur said. About 11,420 acres of brush were aflame across California. In El Dorado County east of Sacramento, a fire destroyed one house and threatened about 100 others. It had consumed 770 acres Sunday and was 30 percent contained. 
House explosion kills one, injures 17: 
A house in Snow Hill, Md. exploded as firelighters and utility workers investigated a gas leak Sunday, killing one worker and injuring 17 people. Thirteen of those injured were firefighters and paramedics. 
Three other homes reported gas leaks, and about 20 nearby homes were evacuated and the gas sup­ply was turned off, police Chief Michael McDermott said. "It's a very dangerous situation," he said. "We're taking every precaution." Emergency work­ers were plugging in fans to blow the gas odor out of the one-story home when a spark ignited fumes, he said. 
DEA reveals terrorist link to drug trade: 
Federal authorities have amassed evidence for the first time that an illegal drug operation in the United States was funneling proceeds to Middle East terrorist groups like Hezbollah. Evidence gath­ered by the Drug Enforcement Administration since a series of raids in January indicates that a methamphetamine drug operation in the Midwest involving men of Middle Eastern descent has been shipping money back to terrorist groups, officials said.

IN BRIEF 
United deliberates over new CEO 
United Airlines' board of directors has called 
a special meeting for today amid reports it is 
poised to select an oil company executive as its 
new chairman and chief executive officer. 
Glenn Tilton, the 54-year-old vice chairman of ChevronTexaco Corp. and acting chairman of struggling Dynegy Inc., has emerged as the front-runner to replace interim CEO Jack Creighton, according to several reports. He could be named to the job today. 
But both the company and union sources said Sunday that no final decision has been made. 
Government to inspect 1,400 jets 
A day after the government called for 1,400 Boeing jets to be inspected for possibly faulty fuel pumps, major U.S. carriers said Saturday they had few planes in which the pumps have been installed. 
The directive from the Federal Aviation Administration said the pumps could cause an explosion because wires were placed too close to a rotor and could chafe. 
American Airlines, the nation's No. 1 carrier, said Saturday it was replacing pumps on three aircraft. United and Delta, the nation's second­and third-largest airliners, said none of their planes was affected by the FM order. 
WalMart suit becomes class-action 
A federal judge has granted class-action sta­tus to a lawsuit that claims Wal-Mart's denial of health insurance coverage for birth control is unfair to female employees. 
U.S. District Judge Julie Carnes said Friday that all women working for the nation's largest retailer after March 2001 could pursue claims against the company if they were using pre­scription contraceptives. 
Lisa Smith Mauldin, a customer-service man­ager at a Wal-Mart store in Hiram, filed the lawsuit in October asking the court to declare the company's health plan illegal and to order Wal-Mart to reimburse her and other employ­ees for uninsured prescription contraceptives.

Summit embraces business 
. World leaders try to reconcile corporate values with concerns about environment 
Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG 

Business can overcome its "evil 
empire" image by focusing on more 
than just short-term profits, govern­
ment and corporate leaders said 
Sunday at the World Summit. 
"Both business and society stand 
to benefit from working together." 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said at a daylong series of Business Day events. 
Attitudes have changed since the 
first Earth Summit 10 years ago, 
when big business was viewed as 
part of the problem, Annan said. 
"We didn't understand how the 
private sector could be part of the 
solution," he said. Today there is a 
better understanding that "lasting 
and effective answers" can only be 
found in conjunction with business. 
"The corporate sector has the finances. technology and manage­ment to make things happen" with­out waiting for slow-moving govern­ments to act, he said. 
Speaking earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien sounded a similar note. 
"We must move beyond the stale cliche that business does not care about the environment," he said. 
Yet not everyone is happy at the prominent role allotted to business at the current World Summit, con­ceded the gathering's secretary­general. Nitin Desai.

Arthur Andersen revokes permits 

Associated Press 
CHICAGO 

After 89 years in business, Arthur Andersen LLP on Saturday ended its role as auditor of public companies. 
The Chicago-based company was convicted in June of obstruction of justice for shredding and doctoring documents related to Enron audits. Afterward, Andersen told the Securities and Exchange Commission it would cease auditing public companies. It already had given up its license to practice in several states. 
"As of this day, Arthur Andersen LLP has voluntarily relinquished, or consented to revocation of. its firm permits in all states where it was licensed to practice public accoun­tancy with state regulators," the company said Saturday in a state­ment. 
The company now has fewer than 3,000 of the roughly 28,000 employ­ees it had before the Enron scandal. Of its more than 1,200 public-com­pany audit clients. none will remain. 
The firm's startling decline has come in less than nine months. 
"It's like a family member who has terminal cancer," said Gary Brentlinger, human resources director for Andersen's offices in Houston. Austin, San Antonio and New Orleans. "We're watching the firm die." 
As people have left and files have gone into storage, Brentlinger said Andersen staff members have removed papers from offices in a downtown Houston skyscraper and turned off the lights, leaving only furniture and artwork. Office sup­plies were donated to charities. 
Andersen has had to disconnect its e-mail system, overhaul its con­ference-calling operations to take into account offices that closed and sell computers and other hardware. 
The once-mighty accounting firm is expected to be sentenced Oct. 17.

Air marshal defends gun brandishing 
Associated Press 
PHllADELPHIA 

Federal officials defended the response of an air marshal who trained his gun on a passenger-filled jet cabin for 30 minutes after detain­ing a man, prompting protests by a judge who was on the flight. 
Two armed marshals detained the man on Delta Flight 442, which was flying from Atlanta to Philadelphia with 183 people on board, because he allegedly was rummaging through other people's luggage. 
One marshal then held his gun on the coach cabin passengers because some of them ignored orders to remain seated with their seat belts on, a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration said Sunday. 
"If people would have stayed in their seats and heeded those warn­ings, that would not have happened," said TSA spokesman Robert Johnson in Washington. "It's our opinion that it was done by the book." 
He said the TSA, which oversees federal air marshals, was still review­ing the marshals' response on the Saturday flight. The man whom the marshals detained was released and the U.S. Attorney's office decided not to press charges, said FBI spokes­woman Jerri Williams. 
Johnson said that despite the pas­sengers' complaints. he thought the marshals did what they needed to do to make sure that the plane could land safely. 
"It's a highly charged situation," Johnson said. "It's [about] keeping the plane secure." 
Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge James A. Lineberger, who was sitting diagonally acr.oss from the detained man, said he thought the marshals overreacted by holding their semiau­tomatic weapons on passengers for so long. 
Lineberger also said he hadn't noticed any disturbance before the marshals suddenly took the man up to first class and restrained him. 
Several minutes later, the judge said, the marshals returned to the coach cabin and pulled out their guns. 
"I assumed at that moment that there was going to be some sort of gun battle," he said. "I'm looking right down the barrel of the gun as though it was pointed at me." 
Lineberger said he plans to file a complaint with the TSA on Tuesday. He said about 30 other passengers also plan to complain. 
David and Susan Johnson of Mobile, Ala., said they hadn't been aware of any disturbance when the sky mar­shals took the man first to the back of the plane and then to the first-class section. 
"It never made sense," said Susan Johnson, 51, a social worker. "This guy was not any physical threat that we could see. Maybe he said some things to them that made them con­cerned. He just appeared to us unsta­ble, emotionally." 
One passenger, however, said he thought the air marshals handled the situation in a calm and professional manner. 
"These guys looked pretty well like they had things under control." said Robert Venditti-Kramer, 28, who was in first class. He said the marshals only pointed their guns straight down the aisle, not at any passengers. 

West Nile may spread via transplants 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA 

Federal experts and the American Red Cross met Sunday to determine how to deal with the potential threat. 
"We've known for some time that there is a theoretical possibility that people can get this through blood or organ trans­plants," said Tom Skinner, a spokesman with Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "It's highly unusual but it's certainly possible." 
Officials with the Food and Drug Administration said they issued an alert to blood banks two weeks ago to exercise extra caution when screening donors, said Dr. Jesse Goodman with the FDA. 
"We have been very active and tried to anticipate the possibility of something like this," Goodman said. 
Four people, who were not identified, might have been infected with West Nile virus after receiving the kidneys, heart and liver of a woman who died in Georgia in early August after a car accident, the CDC said. 
Three of the four patients developed symptoms of encephalitis, the inflamma­tion of the brain and central nervous sys­tem, which is the most serious conse­quence of West Nile virus. 
One of the four recipients, who was in Atlanta, has died, said Dr. James Hughes, director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious Disease. 
Standard pathology tests from an autopsy confirmed the recipient had encephalitis. Tests are ongoing to see if the recipient was infected with West Nile, which causes encephalitis. 
Another recipient from Jacksonville, Fla., showed symptoms of encephalitis Sunday, said Or. John Agwunobi, the Florida Secretary of Health. 
The heart recipient, a 63-year-old man hospitalized in Miami, was diagnosed with West Nile last week. He was upgraded from critical to serious condition Sunday, said Evelyn Lichterman, an administrator at Jackson Memorial Hospital. 
Officials were sure the man didn't con­tract the disease the disease from a mos­quito in Miami-Dade County, said Mary Jo Trepka, epidemiology director with the county health department. 
Officials say it is unknown whether the Georgia organ donor was already infected or got West Nile through blood transfu­sions in the emergency room. The CDC is backtracking to trace donors who con­tributed the transfused blood, the blood products made from those donations and any other patients who may have received blood or blood products from those dona­tions, Hughes said. 
Samples from the four transplant recipi­ents were sent to the CDC's lab in Fort Collins, Colo., Hughes said. Tests results are expected within the week. 
There is no test yet that can quickly or accurately identify the presence of the West Nile virus. Patients are diagnosed on the basis of their immune response to the virus. 
However, researchers at the CDC are trying to find a way that will cut down the time from when infection occurs and when a response to the virus can be mea­sured, the CDC said. Presently, it takes about 15 days between the time infection occurs and when the response can be measured. 
Officials say they remain optimistic that the chances West Nile can spread through blood is low because there have been no confirmed cases to date. 
There are also no known cases either of person-to-person transmission of other diseases in the same family as West Nile called the arboviral encephalitides: St. Louis encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis and Eastern and Western equine encephalitis. 
While there has been no confirmation that West Nile was passed by blood dona­tion, there are cases on the record in which mosquito-borne diseases have been passed by blood transfusion or transplant.

The Spanish conquest of Central and South America generated a crisis of conscience in Spanish universities and in Spain at large. People wanted to know: was the conquest justified, and if not, seeing that it could not be undone, what were the invaders to do? In this prolonged and often bitter debate, Bartolome de las Casas (1474-1566), Dominican friar and bishop of Chiapas in Mexico, formulated what still are among the most moving and intellectually incisive arguments for the equality of all human beings. He also wrote one of the earliest comparative histories of civilization. The task of the course is to understand the thought of Las Casas and his followers in its sixteenth century context, and then to enquire into the connections between the ideas of Las Casas and contemporary theologians of liberation, in particular Gustavo Gutierrez.

YEMEN 

Iraqi minister seeks support against U.S. 
Associated Press 
SAN'A 
Iraq's culture minister arrived in Yemen Sunday as part of Baghdad's diplomatic campaign to strengthen oppo­sition to U.S. threats of an attack. 
State-run Yemeni radio quoted Hammed Youssef Hammadi as saying that he wants to discuss "the political situation in the area and in particular American threats against Iraq." 
The radio said Hamadi would meet on Monday with President Ali Abdullah Saleh and other Yemeni officials. 
Washington has said it wants a regime change in Baghdad, accusing Saddam of producing weapons of mass destruction. 
President Bush has warned President Saddam Hussein of unspecified consequences if he does not permit the return of U .N. weapons inspectors to verify that Iraq has disman­tled its chemical and biologi­cal weapons and the missiles that can carry them. The inspectors left in December 1998. 
Saddam has dispatched senior officials to internation­al and regional capitals to try to garner opposition to an attack on Iraq. 
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan visited Damascus and Beirut in recent days, while Foreign Minister Naji Sabri left for Moscow on Sunday a day after returning to Baghdad from a mission to Beijing. 
"There's still room for diplomatic solutions to avert a war with the United States," Ramadan said in Damascus. 
Ramad an told reporters later in Baghdad that Iraq would broaden its diplomatic offensive to include European capitals, in particular Berlin and Paris. 
"There is a growing and tangible European opposition to the American policy of aggression," Ramadan told reporters. 
French President Jacques Chirac has called the idea of unilateral U.S. action against Iraq "worrying." German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Washington's stepping up calls for military action to oust Saddam is a mistake that undermines U.N. efforts to resume weapons inspections in Iraq. 
On Sunday, the British Broadcasting Corp. released a text of an interview in which 
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said, "The president has been clear that he believes weapons inspectors should return." 
Iraq claims it has complied with U.N. resolutions ­imposed following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait that sparked the 1991 Gulf War ­but has said it wants to con­tinue a dialogue on the inspectors' return, conditions of which U .N. Secretary­General Kofi Annan has rejected. 
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told CNN's "Late Edition" on Sunday that the idea of the U.N. inspectors' return is "a nonstarter because it's not going to bring about a conclusion." 
Sabri. Iraq's foreign minis­ter, is expected in Cairo for talks with Arab counterparts at Wednesday's opening of their biannual Arab League meeting in the Egyptian capi­
tal. 
The Iraqi issue is expected to top the Arab League meet­ing agenda with a draft reso­lution already being prepared to crystalize a pan-Arab posi­tion on the U.S.-Iraqi standoff.

All last week I was geared up to write my first column of the year about the impending baseball strike. Lo and behold, however, hell appar­ently froze over and the owners and players set­tled, averting 
Mike Marchand 

a disastrous work stoppage and, tem­porarily at Undistinguished least, moving Alumnus the metaphor­ical knife away from their own throats. 
But in many ways, the damage had already been done. Two days after last year's incredible World Series, where the Arizona Diamondbacks tri­umphed over the New York Yankees in seven thrilling games, baseball commissioner Bud Selig announced two of the 30 major-league teams would be contracted. This served as the first firing shot in what would become a 10-month Cold War between the owners and the players' union, a black cloud that hovered over every aspect of the game. 
Great baseball moments like Barry Bonds' 600th home run, the fantastic seasons of pitchers Curt Schilling and Derek Lowe and the former contrac­tion candidate Minnesota Twins' dom­ination of the American League Central Division were overshadowed by the same old posturing and posing we've all seen before. 
This was all even before the players' union announced a strike date of Aug. 
30. The fact that the Hatfield­McCoyish feuding was eventually ended and that a bargain was struck was almost anticlimactic. 
The very idea that the players were willing to strike again and risk anoth­er cancellation of the World Series. and even worse, the lack of the national pastime on the one-year anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on America, was so offensive and repugnant to many fans that they simply withdrew even further from the sport they loved. The cries of, "please don't strike" were matched or even exceeded by the angry, "go ahead, strike, the hell with you all." 
What exactly were the players fight­ing for? What could have been so massively, monumentally important that the players would rather not play at all than surrender to and accept? A salary cap. So, in essence, the players would rather walk out than tell Alex Rodriguez that he can "only" make $15 or $18 million, and not $25 mil­lion. 
Forget that even if players are limit­ed in the revenues they can draw from baseball, they can still pursue multimillion-dollar endorsements, like Derek Jeter for Gatorade, Ken Griffey. Jr. and Sammy Sosa for Pepsi or Mr. Rodriguez for Radio Shack. Out of all the things the players' union could be fighting for. they chose to stake their claim on the narrow self-interest of its wealthiest members. 
Look, I'm all for the free market and for players getting paid what they're worth. But it's become clear that the skyrocketing player salaries are a detriment to the game, making it so that many teams cannot compete with the big-market clubs. Asking super­stars to sacrifice some of their riches and scrape by on a few million dollars less annually in order to revive the health of the institution from which they've become so wealthy shouldn't be such a bitter pill to swallow. 
I need to stop here for a moment, because anytime anyone makes the argument that money rules baseball, and that small-market clubs have no chance of competing in the modern baseball era, disagreements invari­ably rise pointing that out. Since the Minnesota Twins, a small-market team, rule their division, and rich teams like the New York Mets and Cleveland Indians are sucking eggs. it "proves" that money isn't all-impor­tant. 
But any system is bound to have some aberrations. The simple fact is that since the strike of '94, every World Series team had a payroll in the top 10, and every world champion had one in the top five. The Twins are good right now, but they don't stand a chance against a team like the Yankees in the playoffs. And they won't have the finances to hold on to their budding superstars when they become free-agents in a few years. It's revenue inequity that is the core problem. 
So baseball finally wised up a bit and slammed on the brakes before driving the national pastime off the cliff. But it remains to be seen whether or not the agreements they've come to will actually do any good, or be like, say, Notre Dame's new alcohol policy -a wonderful idea in theory, but simply ineffective or detrimental in practice. There's more revenue sharing, but no team salary maximums and minimums, and no individual salary cap. The situation may not change, and may even get worse. 
Baseball's hardest task now, more difficult than any intense labor negoti­ations or serious number-crunching, will be how to invite fans back who, although they may love the game, have been alienated and angered by its recent legacy of multimillion-dollar pissing contests. 
The fact that there won't be another strike for the forseeable future is good, but ifs only a first step. Not once in the announcement of the deal did Bud Selig ever mention the fans. And Friday saw empty seats in Wrigley Field for the Cubs-Cardinals game, and tickets being given away at Fenway Park for the Red Sox-Yankees contest. Both of those games are usu­ally automatic sellouts. 
The whole purpose of the sport is for the fans· entertainment. Baseball may have stopped its ship from cap­sizing, but if they don't point it in the right direction, it can still strike out. 
Mike Marchand, class of2001, works hard for the money, so you bet­ter treat him right. Miraculously, he still has his e-mail address, Marchand.3@nd.edu. so you can still direct responses there. His column appears every other Monday. 
The views expressed in this column are those ofthe author and not neces­sarily those ofThe Observer.

Enjoying sneakers and malls 
A lot has happened since the last time I wrote a column. Four more months in Africa definitely provided lots of excitement. Much of my work involves working with girls throughout the school year, so when the school year ended I devised work that would take me to other parts of Mauritania. Peace Corps Maite Uranga is a two-year commit­ment and I have passed the half-way point. 
Life in Africa 

Thirty-five new volun­
teers arrived in the coun­
try and 22 old volunteers 
left so now I am one of the people who is sup­
posed to know that is going on in the country. 
And strangely, among all of this, I realized that I have forgotten how strange and beautiful living in Africa is. It is now simply my life. But by far the most exciting event of the summer is that I am currently sitting at my parents' house in the United States. I have been here for two weeks and relished every second of it. After living in an African village for 14 months I expected to have major culture shock upon reentry. I had heard stories about people coming back and being horri­fied by the mass consumption, wealth and waste of America and Western cultures. 
On my layover in Paris, I wandered through the airport looking at the stores and also coming to terms with seeing so many white people. On the plane ride to Washington, D.C., I watched three Hollywood movies. This helped me catch up on American culture and reacquaint my ears to English. The in-flight music program provided a glimpse into the pop culture I had been missing. And the technology of the video games amazed me. After the discoveries on the plane, I marched with the other passengers towards the bagggage claim area and customs. I appreciated the effi­
ciency, attentiveness and order of it all. 
In the luxury ofthe airport I called my parents, went to McDonald's, bought some magazines, ate ice cream and finally understood most of what was going on around me. Every store had posted prices so I did not need to worry about bargain­ing. Everything felt so normal and seemed so easy. Within minutes the months in Africa seemed like a far off dream or nightmare depending on the day. An unknown weight lifted off my shoul­ders. 
This ease of life continued for the entire trip. There were times when my life in Africa would resurface at unexpected times. The first day I wore tennis shoes and went to the mall. For some reason I felt clumsy and was very confused as to why. After about an hour of this I laughed and realized I had not walked in anything but sandals and sand for the past year so my body was not used to the cement expanses of the mall. These reminders appeared throughout the week and provided much amusement for my friends and family. 
Now it is two weeks later and my plane leaves in five hours. It will be good to go back to Africa after a few days in Washington and Paris. I do miss the people and my work. The next 10 months will provide much more excitement. In spite of all this, these last two weeks have made me realize that I live in Africa, but America is my home.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Show enthusiam by wearing ties 
As the Maryland game ended and I ran screaming through the halls of Dillon proclaiming my love for interceptions, special teams play and anything "West Coast," my mind turned to our fearless leader, Tyrone Willingham. As I contemplated how my fingers would have be contorted to make a "T" for Ty or a "W" for Willingham during the 1812 Overture, I knew there must be an easier way to support our coach. 
Then, it hit me. What better way to emulate the style, cool demeanor and general suaveness our coach displays on the side­lines than wearing a tie? I would like to propose a "wear your tie, to support our Ty" campaign. When you are getting ready to don "The Shirt" next Saturday morning, why not throw on a tie? 
Think of the possible benefits: 
1. 
You're supporting a great coach who surrounded himself with an amazing coaching staff and an even better team 

2. 
Nothing is quite as intimidating as eight to ten thousand ties being whipped through the air as Purdue faces a third and long. 

3. 
It serves as a buffer to keep the food and beverages you will inevitably spill tailgating off of "The Shirt" · 

4. 
When your folks back home see you screaming your lungs out on NBC they can say, "Oh look, (insert your name here) got dressed up for the game, I'm so proud." 

5. 
You can practice tying a tie because you will go to more home games than job interviews this year. 


So here's to a great season with Ty at the helm. When you look to the stands I'll be the windsor knot in section 30 row 58.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
ND must consider Harvard policies 
As has been widely reported, Harvard University has recently modified some of its student disciplinary procedures. As a result of the changes, Harvard will launch full hearings in cases in which sexual misconduct is alleged only if there is at least some corrobo­rating evidence upon which to ground the charge and investiga­tion. The reason for this requirement strikes many observers as obvious: in the absence ofany corroborating evidence (examples: a confession, some physical evidence, a third party witness to rele­vant activity) those hearing and ruling upon the accusation would have to be able to '1ust see" who is telling the truth in order to reach a proper decision. 
Most people agree that in some situations it is possible to "just see" who is telling the truth and who is not with a nontrivial degree of reliability even in the absence of corroborating evidence. The ability to do this with the high degree of certainty needed to moral­ly and justifiably pass out severe punishments, however, is a magi­cal ability that Harvard has determined its administrators lack. 
As reported in the Aug. 28 edition of The Observer. Notre Dame sees no need for corroborating evidence before going ahead with full disciplinary procedures. Apparently Notre Dame administra­tors think they have the magical power that Harvard administra­tors lack. Or perhaps Notre Dame administrators see no moral problem with proceeding with potentially life-altering disciplinary hearings even in the absence ofminimal corroborating evidence of guilt. 
The small change at Harvard does not make Harvard's current disciplinary procedures a good model for Notre Dame or any other university {see Harvey Silverglate and Josh Gewold's essay in the Aug. 16 Chronicle of Higher Education for a discussion of difficul­ties that remain at Harvard). But on this particular matter, Harvard has made a significant improvement. It's too bad that Notre Dame will not do the same.

Recognize the positive in South Bend 
There are not enough words in the English ver­nacular to describe my feelings after reading the Aug. 30 editorial entitled, "Life outside the bubble draws students into danger." The editorial was the most morally unethical piece of literature that I read to date. It is unfair and an injustice to demonstrate how one incident reflects an entire community. South Bend is like any other city in the United States. 
Criminal activity occurs daily across the country at an alarming rate. I find it interesting that one robbery or series of events over a short period of time can shape an editorial staff's opinion about a community that they have little to limited knowledge. Besides the usual areas that students hangout at or community pro­grams that they participate in, the average Notre Dame student has limited exposure to the South Bend community. 
Frequently I have overheard negative com­ments about the community including the so­called "townies." What people fail to recognize is that South Bend is more than Boat Club, Corby's, Heartland or any other place that is regularly patronized. South Bend is attempting to establish its identity, but growing nevertheless. There are extraordinary community organizations and peo­ple attempting to make a difference and create a world that we can all appreciate. 
People never see or hear about the good that occurs in the community, only the bad. Individuals need to recognize that South Bend has a lot to offer if they take the chance and see it. Things do not appear miraculously. 
It takes a process of self-discovery and exploration. This will not occur without the initial stepping out of one's own comfort zone and attempting to under­stand a culture and com­munity unlike their own. 
I sympathize with the individuals who were robbed but understand that criminal activity can occur at any moment or time. 

The Notre Dame cam­pus is not immune to crime either. The campus is relatively safe from the outside community, creating a bubble environment which many neglect to burst. This editori­
al does not aid in the process, for more students will probably remain in their comfort zones, never exploring the possibilities or oppor­tunities that South Bend has to offer. 
To first-year students and the community, do not believe everything that you hear or read as the truth. discover it for yourselves.

Feeding the 'American Idol' addiction 
It's hard to be choosy about what to watch on TV without cable. Around 8 p.m. on any given weeknight you can count on CBS for its third hour of "Everybody Loves Raymond" reruns, NBC will have an extreme reality show or a stress-inducing drama involving police, firefighters and/or lawyers and ABC usually comes through with an overly dramatic news show featuring a thrilling investigative report on top­ics like how to escape from man-eating fish that walk on land in Thailand. 
And these are the Emmy Award winners. 
By the time I found my roommate frighteningly close to guessing an accurate value for a pilgrim's hope chest on "The Antique Road Show" and truly interested Jerry Falwell's advice on child rearing, I realized we'd hit a new low. 
This is my excuse for being hooked on "American Idol." 
A "Star Search" fan from way back, Fox's spring publicity plugs caught my attention. I had become acquainted with the British spin-off while studying in London last fall. Though I had watched a few episodes during the semester, I have no idea who won or what happened to his or her career. 
Back then Simon was only being cruel to musical hopefuls on the other side of the pond, no one had heard of Randy outside a small circle of Columbia music producers and Paula Abdul was "Straight Up" washed up. 
Although I managed to find more worthwhile ways to spend my time in Britain. I'm sorry to say I didn't have that luxury this summer in South Bend. 
I actually watched the first episodes without knowing the commitment that would be required. I assumed the judges would narrow the contes­tant pool within a week or two and we'd have a new Britney wannabe by Independence Day, not Labor Day. 
But alas, it's three months later, I'm still hooked and I'm not alone. 
Throughout the summer my fellow "Idol" addicts emerged. My sister, my roommates, co-workers at my summer internship, even my mom had to watch when I went home for a week and couldn't miss an episode. 
My parents have digital cable. I was out of excuses. 
Within days of the program's launch, newspaper and magazine articles, Web sites and even an e-mail-based fan newsletter emerged. By mid sum­mer talk show appearances and magazine covers were pervasive. 
It's the perfect media circus; but is it anything more? What is the appeal of "American Idol?" 
The show has been consistently referred to as a combination of "Star Search" and "Survivor," but "Idol" went one step further with audience participation. Fox was so sure of the success of its marketing campaign it decided to rely upon America for the contest's outcome. 
In one sense it seems necessary that Fox ask for the nation's input if it's prepared to guarantee the success of this new idol with a $1 million record contract , but in another it hardly seemed to be our choice. Fox sauntered into the summer season and announced what we would enjoy. The judges gave us 10 options, four of which had essentially the same name and another six with arguably the same manufactured identity. Is that really a choice? And is the show even a setting that reveals true tal­ent? Somehow I don't see Bob Dylan and John Lennon having made the cut. 
But this summer, it was impossible for the show to fail. Fox knew it could own the Nielsen's simply by giving viewers the illusion that we could control the rise of a popular star. But were those water cooler debates over who sounded better belting out karaoke favorites really that heated or did we know all along it was coming down to Kelly and Justin? 
Fox's dream is fleeting. Another three-month "Idol" season would be a disaster. Though we all had fun this summer chatting cattily about how Tamyra's hair looked straightened or coyly mentioning our theories about Christina Christian's suspicious departure, the novelty will wear off. The shameless plugs for Coke and the Ford Focus are already hackneyed and in two years it's doubtful that anyone, even "Idol" addicts , will remember Kelly Clarkson 's name. 
Idol has been a great demonstration of the power of mass advertising, but the American attention span is a short, if coveted, commodity. Winning the contest is one victory, but obtaining any lasting success in the music industry wiJI be a much bigger battle for the future idol. 
By next year, I might be able to afford cable.

Patience, pop music fans. 
Three months and hundreds of per­formances after "American Idol: The Search for a Superstar" began, the hit Fox show will crown a winner on Wednesday. On Tuesday the final two contenders for a $1 million recording contract will compete in the season­ending singing showdown. 
With its "Star Search" meets "Survivor" format and pitch-perfect mix of celebrity, comedy and tear­inducing critiques, "American Idol" captivated fans this summer, becoming the stuff of water-cooler conversations and feeding online rumor mills. Love it or hate it, viewers tuned in each week in increasingly higher numbers, consis­tently putting the show in the Nielsen top-10 ratings. 
This week should prove no different, as apparent fan favorites Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini go head­to-head for the last time Tuesday at 8 
p.m. and then learn their fates Wednesday at 7 p.m. on local channel 28. 
The summer's runaway hit is, in fact, the American version of the British show "Pop Idol." Initial auditions in April and May in seven U.S. cities nar­rowed a field of thousands of would-be idols to 100 singers in their late teens and twenties. A second round of audi-­tions slimmed the pool to 50 contes­tants to appear in Hollywood on the first five episodes of the show in June. 
A panel of three judges, including '80s pop diva Paula Abdul. assessed the acts. Afterwards, viewers decided each week by telephone vote which performers to advance to the round of 10 finalists. 
Since July, fans have voted off (in order) eight of the finalists -Jim Verraros, EJay Day, A.J. Gil, Ryan Starr, Christina Christian, RJ Helton, Tamyra Gray and Nikki McKibbin. This week only Guarini, a longtime frontrunner, and Texas chanteuse Clarkson remain. 
America, meet the last singers standing. 
Clarkson, 20, is a humble country girl with a big-league voice. Judges say she can sing anything -even the phone book ­and make it sound good. In past episodes, the Burleson, Texas, native has showcased her vocal range and show-stopping stage presence with renditions of "Natural Woman," "Respect" and "It's Raining Men." 
"Being on stage is the biggest rush for me," Clarkson said on the show's official Web site, www.idolonfox.com. "It's like I'm kind of nervous at first, but once I get out there, I never want to leave the stage." 
Clarkson vanquished a host of female competitors to reach the Tuesday face-off. Her biggest competition came from big­voiced Atlanta product Tamyra Gray, who was voted off Aug. 21, and fellow Texan Nikki McKibbin, who departed the show Aug. 28. 
\Vhile Clarkson and Gray for weeks seemed like shoe-ins to be among the top­three finalists, McKibbin was a question mark. McKibbin, 23, set herself apart from the other contestants with her punk look and penchant for singing obscure rock songs. For weeks she defied dismissal, being put on the chopping block four times with the lowest vote-getters. Judges consis-
Pop culture enters real 

tently criticized McKibbin's song selection and said the mother-of-one was out­matched by better singers. 
Judges, on the other hand, praised Gray's performances. They compared her vocal skills to those of divas Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and Whitney Houston. 
Gray may still be smarting from the fact that she received walking papers before McKibbin. Her departure left only Clarkson, McKibbin and Guarini, the lone male competitor since mid-August. 
In the square-off between Clarkson and McKibbin, Clarkson seemed destined to win. Whereas McKibbin came close to being voted off several times, the public never thought about giving Clarkson the pink slip. Predictably, voters sent McKibbin packing last week. 
Clarkson now faces her biggest test from Guarini. 
From the beginning. Guarini, with his curly, uncoiffed mop, has reigned as the show's heartthrob. A favorite among female fans, Guarini's "Justin Timberlake before the buzz cut" look has brought him to the final round. Viewers sent him to the chopping block twice but opted on dismiss­ing the other male competitors in lieu of Guarini. 
Guarini outlasted a host of male croon­ers, including the pesky "J" factor -A.J., EJay and RJ. His choice of soulful tunes "Ribbon in the Sky," "Let's Stay Together" and "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" distinguished him from the other men and brought tears to female fans' eyes. 
"I want to be a beacon of ... fun!" Guarini said on the Web site about why he auditioned for the show. "Glitz and glam­our are rampant in America. but I want to bring on the fun and share it with an America that now, more than ever, needs joy to get us through our current trials."

Hardly an episode has gone by that Cowell, typically clad in black T­shirt, hasn't called singers "awful" or told them that they resemble a karaoke act more than a pop superstar. 
Cowell's frankness, of course, is balanced by Abdul and fellow judge Randy Jackson's less-abra­sive critiques. Abdul, a former idol­ized songstress herself, never fails to provide a feel-good line for a contestant who Cowell has pum­meled. 
She even throws a few lines at Cowell. 
"I don't know why Simon has to be so rude," she said during an episode last month. "Maybe he wasn't held enough as a child." 
Cowell rebutted in another episode: "Paula, you have a come­dy writer. Sue him." 
In still another episode, Cowell nearly came to blows with Jackson, a former vice president at Columbia Records, over an assess­ment of a contestant. True to form, Cowell gave an unfavorable cri­tique, while Jackson stood up for the performer. 
"For a moment, I thought Randy was going to take me for a tumble," Cowell said later. 
The Brit has gotten into verbal scuffles with hosts Brian Dunkleman and Ryan Seacrest too. Cowell time and again comple­ments Seacrest's see-through 
The format for the final two episodes is a closely guarded secret, but Clarkson and Guarini are expected to sing twice Tuesday night. Each contestant will sing an original single, and the winner's song will be released to stores Sept. 17. 
With the success of the show this sum­mer, the 10 original finalists were subject to a huge media blitz, a schedule chock full of newspaper interviews, magazine photo shoots and appearances at paparazzi-laden events such as the Teen Choice Awards and MTV's Video Music Awards. Plans for an "American Idol" book and home video are in the works. And a 30-date concert tour is planned in October and November, including an Oct. 16 show in Chicago and a Nov. 7 Indianapolis stop. 
Both Clarkson and Guarini say the exposure hasn't changed them and that there's little they'd change about them­selves to become the American Idol. 
What wouldn't they change? 
"My personality and outlook on life," Guarini said. "I just want to have fun doing what I love." 
'Tm happy with myself. Of course, there are little things here and there that I wish were smaller and bigger, but I don't know one person who is perfectly happy with their physical appearance," Clarkson said. 
While the contestants duke it out on stage, the show's other staples -the judges and hosts -will wage their own war of words. Comedic banter among the off-stage talent is as much a part of "Ido~" as '70s hits and orchestral accompani­ment. 
At the center of the non-stop wit is bad­boy British judge Simon Cowell, a vet~ran of the music industry. Cowell is notorious for his tongue-lashing of performers. 
apparel, saying "Ryan, I like your 
blouse tonight." And the hosts without fail throw in their own barbs when they introduce the judges to open each show. 
When the show wraps on Wednesday, an new star will be crowned, but "American Idol" will seemingly leave its judges and hosts in good stead as well. The show has harkened the comeback of Abdul, setting her up for future TV roles, possibly on a sitcom. As for Dunkleman and Seacrest, both men's showbiz careers seem certain to take off. 
"Three months ago, I was driving a car with no reverse that couldn't go over 40 miles an hour," Dunkleman, a stand-up comedian said. "Now I ride in limos." 
On Wednesday, Clarkson or Guarini may share Dunkleman's same good for­tune. While the public's vote will decide the winner, co-host Seacrest said the "x­factor" will determine America's next music star. 
"Sure it takes dedication, confidence and passion, but it takes something else," Seacrest, host of a top-ranked Los Angeles radio show and the rumored boyfriend of Abdul, said. "\iVe've heard our sometimes abrasive friend Simon call it the x-factor. Remember the first time you had a crush on someone, you could describe some of the traits you were attracted to. but there was also probably something else. That thing. That thing makes someone stand out." 
This week. that unknown quality will give the country its first American idol. Stay tuned.

Brabbs misses 2 but makes game-winner 
Associated Press 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. 

Philip Brabbs went from unknown to goat to man of the hour for Michigan. 
The walk-on kicked a 44-yard field goal -the first of his career -as time expired to give Michigan a riveting 31-29 victory over Washington Saturday. 
"I've hung low for a while in college," said Brabbs. a junior who had never attempted a field goal for the Wolverines before Saturday. "This changes things . ., 
A blunder by the Huskies made the sensational finish pos­sible. 
After the Wolverines failed to complete a pass on third-and-10 with 6 seconds left, Washington was penalized 15 yards for hav­ing 12 men on the field. Without the flag, Michigan would have attempted a 59-yard field goal. 
"We switched substitution groups, which we're going to kick ourselves about for a thou­sand years," Washington coach Rick Neuheisel said. 
Wolverines quarterback John Navarre spiked the ball to stop the clock at 5 seconds, allowing the field-goal team to get on the field. To the delight of the crowd of 111,491 at Michigan Stadium, Brabbs' kick went right down the middle for his first field goal since he was a senior at Midland (Mich.) Dow High School in 1998. 
"I didn't know how to react," Brabbs said. "I started doing cir­cles around the field, then I got tackled by one of my teammates. Then I had 10 guys on top of me, then everybody piled on and I got scrunched." 
Brabbs atoned for two misses in the first half from 36 and 42 yards, and he was replaced by Troy Nienberg, who missed a 27 ­yarder with 1 :24 left. 
Michigan's Chris Perry ran for 120 yards and three touch­downs. Navarre was 22-of-38 for 268 yards with a TD and an interception. 
Colorado St.19, Colorado 14 
Colorado State is no longer intimidated when it plays its higher-profile in-state rival. Three wins in the last four years makes certain of that. 
Bradlee Van Pelt ran 23 yards for a touchdown with 6:20 left, and Colorado State survived a second-half Colorado rally to beat the Buffaloes 19-14 Saturday. 
"We knew going into the game that this CU team wasn't unbeat­able," Van Pelt said. 
The Rams dominated the first half, building a 13-0 lead, before Colorado bounced back to take a 14-13 advantage. 
On the first play of the fourth quarter, Colorado's Jeremy Bloom returned a punt 7 5 yards for a score. Five minutes later, Chris Brown atoned for three earlier fumbles with a 1-yard scoring run, capping an 81-yard drive and giving the Buffaloes a 14-13 lead with 9:39 remaining. 
Colorado State countered immediately with a seven-play, 84-yard TD drive. 
Van Pelt passed 11 yards to Chris Pittman, 9 yards to Cecil Sapp and 16 yards to Joey Cuppari. With a first down at the Colorado 23, Van Pelt broke off the left side and cut back to the right on a clinching scoring run. Van Pelt threw incomplete on the 2-point conversion try. 
Colorado subsequently drove to the CSU 12, where John Donahoe couldn't pull down Craig Ochs' high pass on fourth down at the goal line with 21 seconds left. 
"Ultimately, when the game was on the line, CSU got it done and we didn't," Colorado coach Gary Barnett said. "They were behind and they put together a great drive. Their quarterback is a great warrior. He played with great heart like he did last week. 
Brown, who fumbled only once all last season, finished with 93 yards rushing on 22 carries. Sapp had 80 yards rushing, and Van Pelt added 74. 
Colorado has dropped four straight season openers for the first time since 1938-41. 
Kentucky 22, Louisville 17 
Taylor Begley kicked three field goals and Kentucky's defense dominated No. 17 Louisville and quarterback Dave Ragone in a 22-17 victory over the Cardinals on Sunday night. 
Jared Lorenzen threw for 195 yards and a touchdown as the Wildcats snapped a three-game losing streak to their in-state rivals in the opener for both teams. 
Ragone, touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate, spent most of the game on the run from Kentucky's pass rush. He was sacked three times and finished 14-for-39 for 193 yards with a touchdown pass and an intercep­tion. 
The Cardinals mustered only 248 total yards against a Kentucky defense that ranked 109th in the nation in yards allowed last season. 
Louisville returned only one starter from the team's 2001 offensive line, and the Wildcats' defense battered the newcomers. On Louisville's first four offensive series, Kentucky sacked Ragone twice and held the Cardinals to minus-3 rushing yards. 
Louisville's more heralded defense, led by Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year Dewayne White, also asserted itself early, holding the Wildcats to minus-8 yards on their first five plays. 
The Cardinals blitzed on Kentucky's sixth play, but Lorenzen dumped a short pass to Ernest Simms before taking a hit. With most of the Cardinals chasing Lorenzen, Simms sprint­ed untouched for a 64-yard touchdown. 
The Wildcats put together a nine-play drive later in the first quarter, and Begley, a red shirt freshman, kicked his first career field goal, a 40-yarder, with 4:32 left. 
Meanwhile, Ragone continued to scramble and struggle. Running for the sideline, he was hit by sophomore safety Claude Sagalle and fumbled at the Louisville 18 with 6:01 left before halftime. The turnover set up Artose Pinner's 8-yard touch­down run with 3:58 left in the first half. 
Broderick Clark, a redshirt freshman from Alabama, tem­porarily turned the momentum toward Louisville when he returned the second-half kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. 
Ragone led the Cardinals 84 yards to set up Nathan Smith's 24-yard field goal that put Louisville up 17-16 with 5:51 left in the third quarter. 
The Wildcats chewed up almost five minutes on their answering drive, and Begley restored Kentucky's lead with a 32-yard field goal. He added a 31-yarder with 4:09 left for a 22­17 lead. 
The Cardinals got the ball back deep in their own territory, but Ragone was intercepted near midfield by Mike Williams with 
3:09 remaining. 
Nebraska 31, Troy St. 16 

The way DeJuan Groce played, Nebraska could afford a bad per­formance by its offense. 
Groce returned two punts for touchdowns and grabbed two interceptions to help the Cornhuskers defeat Troy State 31-16 Saturday night. 
"It was kind of like in basket­ball when somebody gets the hot hand. I had the hot feet," Groce said. 
Dahrran Diedrick and Jammal Lord each added touchdown runs for the 'Huskers, who needed all the special-teams help they could get. 
Nebraska had 313 yards of offense, its lowest total since gaining 270 against Notre Dame in the third game of last season. The performance followed a spo­radic effort in last week's opener against Arizona State. 
"There is no question that we need to improve as an offense. We are young at some spots, and these were two very important games for us," coach Frank Solich said. 
Troy State, which proved a surprisingly tough opponent dur­ing its first Division I-A season, didn't flinch in the first game of its second year. The Trojans, who lost at Nebraska 42-14 last year, outgained the heavily favored 'Huskers 374-310, aided by a 73-yard scoring drive in the final minute. 
South Carolina 34, New Mexico St. 24 

South Carolina's Lou Holtz is happy to share a place in college football history with his friend and rival, former Michigan coach Bo Schembechler. 
"But if I worried about wins and losses, or winning percent­ages, I sure wouldn't have taken over six losing situations," said Holtz, who tied Schembechler with his 234th career victory as the Gamecocks beat New Mexico State 34-24 Saturday. 
"All that means is I've coached a long time," said Holtz, who can tie his former Ohio State boss, the late Woody Hayes, with four more victories. 
South Carolina's largest sea­son-opening crowd of 83,717 didn't see the thumping it expected. But the Gamecocks got 113 yards rushing and a pretty, 44-yard touchdown pass from new quarterback Corey Jenkins to win their third straight open­er. 
"You can't win pretty all the time," said Jenkins, who also threw for 166 yards on 9-of-18 passing. "The best part about this all is we won, and we've got a lot of guys who are disappointed." 
Especially since things were in doubt until the final quarter. 
The Gamecocks could get little going early behind Jenkins, a 26­year-old senior starting for the first time. 
And when Walter Taylor ran in from a yard out with 1 :35 left in the third period -set up by Eric Higgins' 75-yard carry -the Aggies trailed just 20-17. 
"I like how we silenced the crowd a couple of times," said Higgins. who finished with 111 yards rushing. 
But Jenkins and the Gamecocks soon took control of the game. 
Jenkins had a 16-yard run and an 18-yard pass to Michael Ages on the next drive. An 8-yard run by Jenkins took the ball to New Mexico State's 2, and freshman Daccus Turman followed with a touchdown that put the Gamecocks up 26-17 less than two minutes into the final quar­ter. 
A fumbled punt on the Aggies' next series set up another score for South Carolina. Andrew Pinnock got his 21st career rush­ing touchdown to put the game away.

Leslie was selected the most valuable player of the Finals for the second consecutive year, completing her second consecu­tive sweep of the All-Star and finals MVP awards.

just an amazing feeling."

INTERNATIONAL BASKETBALL 
U.S. starts slow, still routes China by 21 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS 

For much of the first half, the sight on the scoreboard was shocking. The U.S. team was losing, and the score wasn't even close. 
China nearly became the first team to hold a halftime lead against the United States since NBA players began competing internationally in 1992, but the 
U.S. team recovered from its poor start to win 84-65 Saturday night at the World Championships. 
"I was not surprised, because when a strong team is playing a weak team they usually are very relaxed," China coach Wang Fei said. 
Relaxed might not be the cor­rect word. 
To hear U.S. coach George Karl describe it, his team was "startled" before it turned up its defensive intensity and held China to 13 points in the third quarter and 10 in the fourth. 
China held a 28-16 lead after one quarter and remained ahead until the final 6.5 sec­onds of the second quarter. 
The U.S. team took the lead for good with about four min­utes left in the third quarter but didn't close out the lightly regarded Chinese until Jermaine O'Neal scored inside with about 6112 minutes left for a 69-58 lead. 
Teams from around the world have been encroaching over the past few years on the American dominance in the sport, and Saturday night's game was yet another example of how foreign teams have closed the gap. 
Chinese teams had never come close to competing with the United States in the past decade. The U.S team defeated China by 63 at the 1996 Olympics and by 55 at the 1994 World Championships. 
Just two years ago at the Sydney Olympics, the Chinese team lost by 47 points. 
That defeat was so lopsided that Chinese center Yao Ming said it "may not be in our gen­eration or the next" before China can defeat the United States in a premiere level men's basketball tournament. 
For a while Saturday night, it looked as though his prediction might be off by about 80 or so years. 
Yao pumped his fist in glee after hitting a 3-point shot to give China a 10-4 lead early in the first quarter, and the crowd gasped in astonishment as the Americans fell further behind as the quarter pro­gressed. 
China used backdoor cuts and timely jumpers to open a 28-16 lead at the end of the first quarter. 
"They made (five) 3s in the first quarter, and the 3 is a powerful weapon," Karl said. "Because of that we got star­tled a little bit, but it got us to play the type of intense pres­sure defense we needed to play." 
The U.S. chipped away at its deficit, and Michael Finley hit a 3-pointer with 18 seconds left in the half to cut China's lead to 42-41. 
Finley then came up with a steal that led to his pair of go­ahead free throws with 6.5 sec­onds left before halftime as the 
U.S. team took a 43-42 lead ­its first of the game. 
Since the 1992 Olympics, the United States is 56-0 in inter­national competitions when using teams of NBA players. 
U.S. teams have never trailed at halftime, but this was the second time in as many nights that they led by only a single point at the break. On Friday night, the U.S. team was unable to shake Germany until the final quarter. 
"We tried to come out with intensity and it was our third game in three days," U.S. guard Andre Miller said. "They came out fast themselves and hit some big shots early. For us to give up 28 points in the first quarter, that's pretty bad. 
"I think we can get better," Miller said. "We're going to get every team's best shot."

NATIONAL LEAGUE 
Dodgers stay atop wild-card race with win 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON 

Hideo Nomo only made one 
mistake, and that wasn't 
enough for the Houston Astros 
to beat him. 
Nomo won for the 11th time 
in his last 12 decisions, pitch­
ing the Los Angeles Dodgers to 
a 2-1 victory over the Astros. 
"The home run was the only 
mistake he made all day. His 
split-finger was unhittable. All 
you could do was fight it off 
and hope you will get another 
pitch you can hit," said Geoff 
Blum, who homered off Nomo. 
The Dodgers, who lead the 
NL wild-card race, have won 
13 of their last 17 games. 
Nomo (13-6} gave up five hits 
over seven innings, striking out 
eight. He has lost only once 
since May 12 -a span of 21 
starts. 
''We scored first, so that was good. Right after I gave up the home run, from that point on, it was my goal not to give up any runs after that," Nomo said. 
Said Dodgers manager Jim Tracy: "I've run out of adjec­tives to describe the job Hideo Nomo has done for this club all season." 
The loss was Houston's fourth in 11 games. 
"He had everything going today. That split-finger would look chest high and would end up in the dirt," said Houston's Daryle Ward. "He didn't hang it at all, he kept it in the zone." 
Paul Quantrill and Jesse Orosco combined to pitch a scoreless eighth and Eric Gagne escaped his own ninth­inning jam for his 46th save in 50 chances. 
Jeff Bagwell led off the Astros ninth with a single. It was his 1,937th hit, tying Jose Cruz for second place on Houston's career list. 
Jason Lane followed Bagwell's hit with a bunt sin­gle, but Gagne struck out Orlando Merced, got Geoff Blum on a foulout and fanned Gregg Zaun to end it. 
Carlos Hernandez (6-5) lost despite striking out a career­high nine in six innings. 
Braves 6, Expos 4 
John Smoltz and the Atlanta 
Braves have some significant 
accomplishments well within 
their sights. 

Kevin Millwood hit a two-run 
double on his way to winning 
his sixth straight decision as 
the Atlanta Braves beat the 
Montreal Expos 6-4 Sunday for 
a three-game sweep. 
Smoltz saved all three games 
in the series, pitching a score­
less ninth for his major league­
1eading 49th save. Bobby 
Thigpen set the major league 
record with 57 saves with the 
Chicago White Sox in 1990. 
"Obviously with the amount 
of games we have left it's 
something that you can't help 
think about," Smoltz said. 
Seeking its 11th straight divi­
sion title, Atlanta finished a 6-6 
road trip and lowered its magic 
number to clinch the NL East 
to 11. 

"We had an all right road trip," Braves center fielder Andruw Jones said. "We start­ed really bad playing against San Diego and Los Angeles, and went to Pittsburgh and got beat that series, too. But it was good to come out here and play three good games against these guys and make the series even." 
Montreal lost its fourth straight game. 
Millwood's two-run double off Masato Yoshii broke a 1-1 tie as the Braves scored three runs in the fourth. 
Millwood (15-6) allowed five hits and two runs in 5 2/3 innings. He scattered three hits, including Jose Vidro's RBI single in the first, through the first five innings. 
Cubs 5, Cardinals 4 
The St. Louis Cardinals have gone 81 years without a four­game sweep in Chicago, and they'll have to wait some more. 
Angel Echevarria homered and Alex Gonzalez singled in the go-ahead run in the eighth inning as the Cubs beat the Cardinals 5-4 Sunday. 
Chicago avoided being swept in a four-game series at home by its longtime rivals for the first time since 1921 -when Wrigley Field was called Cubs 
Park. 

"It would have crushed me. 
seeing I was a Cubs fan as a 
kid," said Joe Girardi, who 
grew up in Cardinals territory 
in Peoria, Ill. "My dad has to 
take grief in Peoria because of 
the Cardinals. So I know my 
dad was happy." 

Girardi, who drove in a pair 
of runs, wasn't the only one. 
The Cubs had dropped four of 
their last five games, and the 
first three losses to the 
Cardinals really hurt. 

"It was real important to win 
this ballgame," Cubs interim 
manager Bruce Kimm said. 
"The way we struggled the first 
three games, you sort of won­
der, are we ever going to win 
another game?" 

The Cubs had to be thinking 
that after the seventh inning, 
too, when Eli Marrero homered 
-his third in as many games 
-to give St. Louis a 4-3 lead. 
But Chuck Finley (5-4) unrav­
eled, giving up a leadoff homer 
to Echeverria to tie it and 
walking Fred McGriff. 

"I tried to milk another inning out of Chuck," Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. "We pushed him too far." 
Rick White relieved, and speedy Corey Patterson ran for McGriff. Patterson took second on a sacrifice bunt, and Gonzalez followed with a soft blooper that landed in shallow center for an RBI single. 
"It just went in the right spot," Gonzalez said. "It's one of those things in baseball, you don't do everything right, but it lands in the right spot." 
Juan Cruz (2-10) pitched a scoreless eighth for his first win since May 21. Antonio Alfonseca worked the ninth for his 16th save. 
Brewers 4, Reds 2 

The Brewers are feeling the power. 
Ryan Thompson homered twice Sunday, and Lenny Harris hit a two-run shot to give Milwaukee a 4-2 victory and a series sweep of the Cincinnati Reds. 
The Brewers hit 10 homers in the three-game series. 
"Harris and Thompson are 

hot, hot, hot," said Milwaukee 
manager Jerry Royster. 
"It's just nice, normal base­

ball. We're doing to them what 
other teams have been doing to 
us all year. We're winning 
games with our offense. and 
our pitching is keeping them 
down. Our extra guys are pick­
ing us up right now." 
All three homers Sunday 

were off Elmer Dessens (7-7). 
who allowed five hits and 
struck out six with no walks in 
seven innings. 
On Saturday, Reds starter 

Chris Reitsma gave up five 
homers, and after losing three 
straight to the last-place 
Brewers, Cincinnati manager 
Bob Boone was left with no 
explanation. 
"It has nothing to do with the 

Brewers," Boone said. "You've 
got to swing the bat. If you look 
at our August stats, we're just 
not hitting the ball." 
The Reds stumbled badly in August, and now into September. Cincinnati was 11­18 in August, its worst record for any August since going 9-20 in 1987. 
Batters hit .235, their low for any month this season, and pitchers had a combined 5.53 ERA, their high for the year. Relievers got just two saves. 
"I just want to put a good ballgame together," Boone said. "That's what I'm trying to do now." 
Nick Neugebauer, activated from the 15-day disabled list before the game, made his first start for Milwaukee since May 
8. He allowed two runs on four hits, four walks and two strike­outs in four innings. 
Jose Cabrera (6-10) pitched two perfect innings for the win, striking out two. Mike DeJean worked the ninth for his 22nd save in 25 chances. 
Phillies 9, Mets 5 
The message on the cl uh­house marker board urged the New York Mets to put a miser­able August behind them: "It's a New Month!!! Sept. 1." 
Instead, from the time Edgardo Alfonzo threw a ball away in the first inning to allow 
the first run to score, 
September started off as poorly 
as August ended for New York 
and its fans. 
The Mets matched the 
longest home losing streak in 
National League history with 
their 14th straight defeat at 
Shea Stadium as the 

Philadelphia Phillies pounded 
Al Leiter for three homers in a 
9-5 victory Sunday. 
"It is demoralizing," said 
Mike Piazza, who watched the 
latest loss with a sore wrist. 
"Everyone has had losing 
streaks, everyone has had 
slumps. But this is uncharted 
waters for me. I'm a little bit in 
shock." 
One day after completing the 
first winless month at home in 
league history, the Mets 
matched the 14-game home 
skid by Boston's NL franchise in 
1911, according to the Elias 
Sports Bureau. 
While Boston added a 44­
year-old Cy Young to its team 
that season, the only help the 
Mets are getting will be from 
minor league callups as they 
attempt to avoid the St. Louis 
Browns' major league record of 
20 consecutive home losses in 
1953. 
"It's certainly been a disap­pointment," Leiter said. "We still have a month of baseball to go. There's no reason we can't have a great month and finish on a high note." 
Pat Burrell, Todd Pratt and Tomas Perez all homered off Leiter (11-11), who lasted two­plus innings in his shortest reg­ular-season start in 14 years. 
"I feel for them," said Pratt, who spent 41/2 years with the Mets. "We have to beat them, but I feel for them. I have a lot of good friends over there." 
Brett Myers (3-3) allowed four runs in six innings as the Phillies won for the 10th time in 11 games to move a season­high three games over .500. 
Meanwhile, the Mets keep hit­ting new franchise lows in a season that began with so much promise. They broke a tie with the 1979 team for the longest losing streak at home, reaching a level even the 40-win expan­sion team in 1962 didn't.

OAKI.AND, Calif. 

Over and over again, the ball left Miguel Tejada's bat and landed in the left-field seats. Each time, the Coliseum crowd cheered wildly as Tejada screamed with joy and pumped his arms while rounding the bases. 
The televisions in the Oakland clubhouse played just one pro­gram after the Athletics won their 18th straight game -and every time, Tejada was the star. 
Tejada hit a dramatic three­run homer as the A's blew a two-run lead in the ninth inning, then rallied to beat the Minnesota Twins 7-5 Sunday to extend baseball's best streak in 49 years. 
Everyone in Oakland was in a bit of disbelief-particularly the A's clubhouse staffers, who played the final at-bat on a con­tinuous loop. 
"Every year, I take all my tapes back home (to the Dominican Republic). and I show them to my dad," Tejada said. "This one might break. I'm going to watch it every day." 
The first game-ending homer of Tejada's career extended the majors' longest winning streak since 1953, when the New York Yankees also won 18 in a row, on a day it seemed certain to continue -and then seemed certain to end when Oakland allowed three solo homers in the top of the ninth. 
"This thing has a life of its own," Oakland manager Art Howe said of the longest streak in franchise history, besting the 17-gamer by the 1931 Philadelphia A's. "I can't say I'm surprised by anything that hap­pens. We sort of blew that game, but Miggy found a way to get it for us anyway." 
Matthew LeCroy, Corey Koskie and Mike Cuddyer homered for Minnesota in an improbable rally that ruined the complete­game hopes of Mark Mulder and sent the Coliseum into stunned, empty silence. 
But in the ninth, Ramon Hernandez walked and Ray Durham singled against ace closer Eddie Guardado (1-3). Pinch-hitter Olmedo Saenz struck out. setting the stage for Tejada's homer. 
Red Sox 7, Indians 1 
Johnny Damon knows the Boston Red Sox must start win­ning consistently to earn a play­off spot. 
Damon had three hits and scored three runs for the wild­card chasing Boston Red Sox, who got consecutive home runs from Manny Ramirez and Brian Daubach in Sunday's 7-1 win over Cleveland 
"I told this team Friday that now is the time to go and I'm ready to accept the responsibili­ty for doing it," said Damon, who went 7-for-13 in the three­game series. "I feel good. I want to get back to the playoffs." 
Tim Wakefield pitched seven strong innings, Ramirez drove in three runs and Shea Hillenbrand had two RBI for Boston, which won for just the third time in eight games. 
The Red Sox are 23-25 since the All-Star break. 
"We've got a lot to do in a short period of time," manager Grady Llttle said. "We've got no time to waste.

Craig Counsell, consid­ered by many of his Diamondback teammates to have been Arizona's most valuable player, will decide soon whether to undergo season-ending neck surgery. 
"At some point, there's going to be surgery," Counsell said Sunday. "When? We're trying to put that off, but I don't know if I can." 
Counsell has been on the 15-day disabled list since Aug. 9 with a pinched nerve in his neck. An MRI showed two bulging disks that will require surgery. 
He will travel to Dallas to meet Wednesday with spine specialist Drew Dossett. The Diamondbacks want Counsell to decide by Friday whether to have the surgery now. 
"I think I'll have a lot more information by Friday," Counsell said, "and that will make it easier to make a decision." 
Counsell has received three epidural injections and undergone strenuous exercising but still experi­ences numbness and tin­gling in his right hand. 
"I can't play right now." he said. "It's got to get bet­ter. It's got to get a lot bet­ter. If it doesn't improve, there's no reason to wait." 
Trainer Paul Lessard said that if Counsell continues to put off the surgery. there is a chance that the nerve being pinched will simply shut down, compounding the problem. 
Two types of surgery are possible. One involves drilling a hole to relieve pressure on the nerve. The other would fuse the disks together with a metal plate. 
In either case, Lessard said, Counsell wouldn't be able to even begin strength­ening exercises for four weeks and it would be two months at the earliest before he could begin play­ing baseball. 
Counsell's scrappiness and ability to come through in the clutch have been sorely missed. He remains second in the National League in hitting with run­ners in scoring position at .364, behind only Edgardo Alfonzo of New York at .368. 
Counsell was hitting .282 with 22 doubles and 51 RBI in his first season as an everyday player. He started at third base while Matt Williams recovered from a broken ankle, and also played second base and shortstop. Counsell commit­ted only eight errors in 112 games. By comparison sec­ond baseman Junior Spivey and shortstop Tony Womack have 14 errors apiece.

U.S. OPEN 
Williams overcomes rain, stalker to advance 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

As usual. nothing fazed Serena Williams on court. 
With a man who's tracked her around the globe for a year sit­ting in a jail cell less than 10 miles away, Williams waited out a long rain delay Sunday and then eased into the U.S. Open quarterfinals with a 6-1, 6-1 vic­tory over Daja Bedanova. 
The only match completed in a short break from Sunday's downpours was the 18th straight Grand Slam match victory for the top-seeded Williams, who beat older sister Venus in the finals at Wimbledon and the French Open. 
The same German man accused of following Williams at those two tournaments, and oth­ers in Germany and Italy, was arrested early Saturday at the National Tennis Center after police spotted him watching through a fence while she played. 
Albrecht Stromeyer, 34, will remain in custody at Rikers Island until a court appearance on Thursday unless he posts $3,000 bail, corrections depart­ment spokesman Tom Antenen said Sunday. Stromeyer admitted in a written statement to police that he had been following Williams around the world. 
"The bail is so low. I think that encourages him to keep doing what he's doing," Williams' father. Richard, said. "It makes me wonder. 'Could he hurt Serena?'" 
He also wondered whether his daughter is as worried as she should be. 
"This guy could have got in and hurt Serena," Richard Williams said. "I don't think Serena takes it seriously enough." 
She has been traveling with a 
I bodyguard since May. and tour­nament officials have been given photos of Stromeyer so police
I
·I can spot him. 
"The WTA could do a little bit more, but I don't know too much more that they can do because, you have to remember, tennis is not set up like baseball and foot­ball. The players go outside to practice and with those sports they can practice inside the sta­dium and travel underground, where tennis is not" like that, Richard Williams said. "But I hope that it will help the WTA to take a good look at it." 
Williams snapped photographs from the stands while he watched his daughter play her fourth-round match against the 20th-seeded Bedanova. Rain delayed the start of play from 11 
a.m. to a little after 5:30 p.m., and theirs was the only match that was completed by the time new showers suspended action at about 7 p.m. So people paying a minimum of $48 per ticket got to see 42 minutes of action. 
If just one match is completed in a session, according to the Open's policy, no credits for tick­ets to next year's tournament need to be given. 
At 9:50 p.m., play was called off for the night, with matches involving Lindsay Davenport and Andy Roddick washed out com­pletely. Among matches halted in progress: Four-time Open champion Pete Sampras was trailing 1997 finalist Greg Rusedski 5-4, on serve in the first set; No. 3 Tommy Haas won the first set 6-4 against No. 29 Thomas Enqvist; Gustavo Kuerten won the first set 6-1 against Nicolas Massu; and 11th­seeded Daniela Hantuchova led No. 8 Justine Henin 6-1, 1-2. 
The last time an entire day at the Open was rained out was Sept. 4, 1988. 
Williams won her first service game at love with the help of three straight aces and needed just 18 minutes to win the first set. She finished with eight aces. 
"I've been really, really work­ing on my serve," Williams said. 
here around 9, because I like to practice two hours before the match," she said. "I was think­ing. 'Yes, 11, I could be done by 
12. have the rest of the day.' Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way." 
Williams didn't talk at all about Stromeyer after the match, with WTA Tour spokesman John Dolan preced­ing her news conference by say­ing: "Serena will not be address­ing any questions related to the stalker incidents due to legal and security reasons." 

All told, the encounter took 42 minutes, and Williams nearly had a winner for each. She hit 35 winners total -including 16 fore hands and eight backhands· -and had just five unforced errors.

While the Irish offense played an exciting brand of soccer all weekend, the young Irish defense was equally impressive. Sophomores Gudrun Gunnarsdottir and Kate Tulisiak coupled with freshmen Cat Sigler and Miranda Ford severe­ly limited the offensive firepower of their two opponents.

On the few occasions where the Notre Dame defense suffered a breakdown, the Irish goal­keeping tandem of Lauren Kent and Erika Bohn stepped up to make some crucial saves.

Notre Dame will have no time to rest on the laurels of this weekend's victories. The Irish will host two of last year's Final Four teams in next weekend's Notre Dame Classic. Friday night the Irish host defending national champion Santa Clara, and Sunday the Irish return to action against Portland. 
"Next weekend is huge for us because it's an opportunity for us to set a tone for the rest of the season," Boland said. "Coming out with these two Big East vic­tories helped a lot. With a good week of practice, we will be ready for next weekend."

Irish kick off season with pair of shutouts 
. Notre Dame beats Providence, Virgina Tech for 2-0 start in Big East Conference 
By JOE LICANDRO Spom Writer 
Despite playing without three projected starting defenders, the Notre Dame womens soccer team recorded not one, but two shutouts against Big East confer­ence opponents over the week­end. 
On Friday, the Irish opened the season with a 3-0 road victory against the Providence Friars. Two days later, the Irish returned home to Alumni Field and blanked the Virginia Tech Hokies 5-0. 
After Sunday's victory, Irish coach Randy Waldrum was extremely proud of the way his young team opened the season. 
"We're playing an awful lot of young players," Waldrum said. 
"Even through mistakes, they have been really enthusiastic. The effort and attitude has been great. The team chemistry has been great. There are a lot of things outside the soccer aspect that's been a big plus this year that maybe we lacked a little bit last year." 
With returning forwards Amanda Guertin and Amy Warner to lead the way, the Irish offense kept pressure on the Providence and Virginia Tech defenses. 
After a scoreless first half 
against the Friars. the Irish reg­istered three goals in a span of seven minutes to take control of the game. 
Warner's goal in the fifth minute of the second half ignited the Irish offense. Three minutes later, midfielder Randi Scheller registered her first goal of the season. Mary Boland then fol­lowed three minutes later with a score off an assist from Warner to put the cap on the Irish victo­ry. 
Versatility described the Irish offense Sunday as five different players scored. Guertin got the scoring started with a brilliant left-footed shot that curled over the outstretched arms of Virginia Tech goalie Natasha Dirda in the 21st minute of the game. Although the Irish created numerous scoring opportunities for themselves in the first half, they held a tentative 1-0 lead at halftime.

illing the win 

Despite the hype ofcoaching his first game at Notre Dame, Willingham focuses on winning as the Irish shut out the Terrapins 
By KATIE McVOY Associate Spores Editor 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 
For Tyrone Willingham, Saturday's game came down to one thing -playing football. 
In the midst of the hype sur­rounding his first game as Notre Dame's head coach, what to focus on was simple. In the face of a Maryland team com­ing off a fairy tale season and ranked No. 20 in the preseason coaches' poll, it was clear what was important. With the eyes of the nation upon him, it came down to one thing. 
Playing football. 
"Gosh, it was a football game," Willingham said when asked how it felt to be coaching his first game as Notre Dame's head coach. "And I don't know how to describe it any other way." 
And his team played football. 
Behind five field goals from Nicholas Setta and a sensation­al defensive performance, the Irish took the 
toss and allowed Maryland to rush for four yards and com­plete one pass for a first down before Shane Walton picked off Terps quarterback Scott McBrien. Walton added two more interceptions in the fourth quarter, the first time since 1982 an Irish player picked off three passes in a game. 
"I look forward to Shane get­ting an interception every time they throw the ball," corner­back Vontez Duff said. "It's just as much our ball as it is their ball when they throw it up there." 
In the first half, Maryland's longest drive covered 21 yards in eight plays. The first quarter series brought them as close as the Irish 40-yard line before Brooks Barnard had to punt ­a whopping 7-yarder that land­ed out of bounds and set the Irish up for their first score of the 2002 season. 
The first Irish scoring drive was indicative of the offense's performance throughout the rest of the game. Before even

Kickoff offense was 
Classic XX. Irish head coach charged with 
"I was hop­ing we would play hard and well," said defen­sive coordinator Kent Baer. "Things just sort of fell into place." 
The Irish defense brought its A-game Saturday, holding a Maryland team that averaged 440 offensive yards last season to 133 total yards and just 16 yards rushing. The inside line­backers, playing without a sick Courtney Watson, recorded 19 tackles while the Notre Dame pass coverage allowed only 12 completions. 
"[The Notre Dame defense] did some things differently than we anticipated but nothing that really should have hurt us," Maryland coach Ralph Friedgen said. "It was not what they did it was how they did it. They won the one-on-one battles and there were a lot of one-on-one battles." 
That first one-on-one victory came on the Terrapins' first possession. Notre Dame deferred after winning the coin of 11 penalties 
for 80 yards. 
"For the most part, you have linemen making calls, but we really have to begin to get the calls in tact and break the hud­dle and those sorts of things for us to win as a ball club," said quarterback Carlyle Holiday. "We can't have those sorts of penalties." 
Despite the penalties, a nine­y a rd run by full back Tom Lopienski set Holiday up for a 29-yard completion to Arnaz Battle. Three plays later, the Irish found themselves facing fourth-and-6 at the Maryland 
34. Setta, who missed a 56­yard kick earlier in the game, completed the 51-yard field goal and gave the Irish the 3-0 lead. 
"I tried to just take each one," said Setta, who was named the Kickoff Classic MVP. "After that first one, it's a new one after the next one it's the same thing." 
In the three quarters that fol­lowed, Setta kicked four more field goals for the Irish. Despite the fact that the Notre Dame offense was inside the Maryland 20 three times, it never found the end zone. 
"We really can't have Nicholas out there that many times," Holiday said. "I mean, we have to score in the red zone, preach that breakfast lunch and dinner from now on." 
The only Irish touchdown came from another special teams player. Less than five minutes into the second half, Duff returned a punt 76 yards to punt the Irish up 16-0 and the game out of reach. 
"I told Coach [at half1, 'Man, they're not punting the ball to me but if they punt it to me I'm going to get us one, all I need is one,"' Duff said. "Thank God that I had the opportunity to get that one and I ran with it." 
In the final minutes of the game. the Terps looked to be putting together a solid offen­sive drive, driving from their own 10-yard line to the Irish 
45. But with just five minutes left in the game, Walton pre­served the shutout when he intercepted McBrien for the second time. Then the Irish were done playing football. 

"[The win] was real special," Holiday said. "I'm sure there was a lot of pressure on coach, you know to win this game and for him to be able to come out and lead us to victory is a big thing."

Holiday passes to next level 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

Carlyle Holiday knew he made a mistake as soon as he let go of the ball. 
As a Maryland defender wrapped his arms around Notre Dame's quarterback midway through the fourth quarter, Holiday flung a submarine pitch, weakly floating the ball a few feet short of the line of scrimmage. 
The Irish got a ten-yard penalty for intentional grounding. Holiday got a tongue-lashing for unintention­al brain freeze. 
He didn't have to wait for his next jaunt to the Irish sideline to know he'd used his reflexes and not his head. Tyrone Willingham left his spot on the SO-yard line to personally tell Holiday he screwed up. Offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick got on the phone after the drive ended to chew Holiday out. 
"I've never been yelled at so much in my entire life," Holiday said. "Things like that just hap­pen, but I can't let it happen again. That's a kindergarten mis­take right there." 
In that instant, Holiday became the playground quarterback who relied on reaction and not reason. The rest of the game, he played with such precision few could tell it was his first game directing a pro-style attack. Brimming with confidence, the gunslinger deliv­ered bullets with an uncanny accuracy he rarely showed last season. 
Last year, Holiday threw more than 17 passes twice. Saturday, he completed 17 passes. Eight dif­ferent recievers caught passes. And in the first 15 minutes of Notre Dame's 22-0 win against Maryland Saturday, Holiday passed for more yards than he did the final two games of last season. 
In Notre Dame's 22-0 victory over Maryland, Holiday and the Irish proved everything. They also proved nothing. 
Holiday directed an offense that managed to move the ball effec­tively -except in the red zone. He showed he could cycle through receivers and complete tough passes -against a bad secondary. He showed he could set up a

offense. Notre Dame Irish quarterback 
beat a poorly prepared foot­ball team with a bad defense and an even worse offense, and the margin of victory should have been much greater. For all its progress. Notre Dame's offense stopped itself from scor­ing touchdowns. 
False starts, delay of game penalties, a porous offensive line, a sub-par running game -all things coaches will be harping on come team meetings this week. 
Still, Holiday's assertiveness under center eased the concerns of worried fans who questioned his passing ability. 
Holiday said he wasn't out to prove anything against Maryland. Bill Clinton said he never had sexual relations with that woman. Both were blatant lies; 
Though he didn't say it, Holiday wanted desperately to erase the terrific display of inade­quacy he exhibit­ed for Willingham the last time the two stood on a field together. The memory of 1­for-16 against Stanford still lin­gered in Holiday's mind, the lowest poin·t in a low season. 

Saturday, Holiday flashed signs that he is a changed quarterback running a changed offense. With the poise of a veteran in a Steve Spurrier offense, Holiday tucked himself away in. the pocket and stayed there. 
He rarely moved around. he rarely scrambled. And when he did, he ran for big yards, exhibit­ing the athletic ability that made him Notre Dame's first and only option on offense last year. 
Nowhere was the change in offensive philosophy more evident than Notre Dame's first offensive play from scrimmage, when Holiday three-step-dropped and fired a screen to Omar Jenkins. The play only gained seven yards, but at least Julius Jones wasn't stuffed going up in the middle. 
Even Willingham, when asked to describe the differences in offenses, laughed before curtly responding, "Night. Day." 
If the Irish hope to return to greatness, Holiday took the first step Saturday. He realized quar­terbacks win games with noggins, not limbs. 
After the game, Holiday laughed about his boneheaded underhand pass. It was a moment of happi­ness in a whirlwind of questions hurled at him by armchair quar­terbacks. 
As Holiday answered question after question, one of his team­mates walked by and muttered. ''Look at Carlyle, backed against the wall." 
Finally. he took his first step away from it.

Walton turns in MVP performance 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Editor 
It isn't often that a player grabs three 
interceptions in a football game and fails 
to earn MVP honors for his performance. 
But that's what happened to Irish corner­
back Shane Walton Saturday night in the 
Kickoff Classic against Maryland. 
The fifth-year senior and Irish co-cap­
tain for the game grabbed two intercep­
tions from starting quarterback Scott 
O'Brien and one from replacement Chris 
Kelley, becoming the first Notre Dame 
player since Dave Duerson in 1982 to· 
have three interceptions in a game. 
But the effort wasn't enough to grab 
MVP honors. Those went to Irish kicker 
Nicholas Setta who made five field goals 
-including kicks from 46 ;md 51 yards 
-and scored 16 of Notre Dame's 22 
points. 
"As fine a job as Nicholas Setta did, it's hard to believe that a guy with three interceptions isn't at least a co-MVP," Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said. "[Walton] played a fantastic ball game. He was one of our captains, and he pro­vided us not only with the leadership but also the excellent play that we expect from a guy in that role." 
Walton led an Irish secondary -and an Irish defense -that held the Maryland offense to just 133 total yards in the shutout. Last season, the Terrapins put up 35.5 points a game and averaged 390 yards of offense. 
"Any time you get a shutout on such a balanced team coming out of last year ­if you remember they were one of the top team's in the country in terms of offensive production and balance -to hold them to a shutout is almost unbelievable," Willingham said.

Young starters make serious stops 
Observer Staff Report 
Courtney Watson did not start on Saturday. Doctor's orders kept the most experi­enced linebacker out of the game with an upset stomach. 
Mike Goolsby, however. did start on Saturday. He and the other two starting lineback­ers had never played a down on defense. But you wouldn't have known by looking at them. 
Brandon Hoyte -who replaced vVatson -and Goolsby eah had eight tack­les. Derrick Curry had four. 
"I thought Goolsby and Hoyte and Curry did an excel­lent job," coach Tyrone Willingham said. "They stepped up and made plays just as we would expect them to. \Ve tell our football team that it doesn't matter, we bclivc it is an oportunty when a guy goes down" 
The three linebackers were part of an offense that held Maryland to 16 total rushing yards. The Terrapins had 26 going into the second half. That means they netted minus-10 yards in the final 30 minutes of the game. 
"It was a blast out there, that was the most fun I've ever had playing ball," Goolsby said. "After the first quarter, getting accustomed to things, I just went out there being my normal self. I had a blast out there." 
Penalties show Irish green 
Notre Dame did leave some evidence that they were still an inexperienced team. The Irish had 11 penalties that cost them 80 yards in the course of the game. Nine of those were offensive. Notre Dame was charged with a false start five times, delay of game twice, intentional grounding and holding. 
"I need to look at the video to see how much of it was sloppy play," said offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick. "I think it they just came at very inopportunty times." 
Five penalites were in Maryland territory. 
Not Jones up the middle 
For the first time in years, Notre Dame came out throw­ing. Carlyle Holiday opened the lrish's first series with a 7-yard pass completion to Omar Jenkins -a change from last year, when first-and­10 meant the Irish often ran. 
"[The play \Vas] very refreshing." said \vide receiv­er Arnaz Battle, who finished the game with four recep­tions for 68 yards. ··1 thought it was coming to me. Carlyle decided to go the other side." 
Game time leadership 
For the second time in 114 years of footballl history, the Irish are naming game day captains. The last time the Irish did so was in 1946 under Frank Leahy. 
Saturday's game day cap­tains were center Jeff Faine, Battle, cornerback Shane Walton and defensive end Ryan Roberts. 
Big time security 
National Security Advisor Condolezza Rice was present at the Kickoff Classic. \Villingham said that as a close friend. she came to watch and support him. 
"Dr. Condolezza Hice is a dear friend." \Villingham advisor. "And it was awful nice in the ballgame to see her here."

SPECIAL TEAMS SPEaALTY 
Ultimately the Irish offense couldn't quite get it 
done. They couldn't cross the goal line. But when it came to special teams, they had the Terrapins' number. With 10:28 left in the third quarter, Vontez Duff fielded a punt at Notre Dame's 24-yard line and sliced through the coverage, covering 76 yards and becoming the only Irish player to score a touchdown. 

BRIAN PUCEVICH/The Observer 
Vontez Duff fields the ball behind teammate Dwight Ellick (No. 37). He broke past Maryland's punt team, finally breaking away from punter Brooks Barnard (No. 
16) as he ran 76 yards for the only touchdown of the game.
