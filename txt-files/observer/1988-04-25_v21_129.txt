Corrections but they're
Corrections. 
I hate running corrections. They're kind of like pulling wisdom teeth. You hate it but you know it has to be done. 
Our fifth correction since spring break is run­ning in today's paper. It's actually a clarifica­tion, since we got the story right but the head­line wrong. That's more like pulling molars instead of wisdom teeth, but it still hurts. 
A couple years back Mark Pankowski wrote a column on why corrections are a good thing to see in a newspaper. A correction shows that a newspaper cares enough about objectivity to get the facts straight the second time. He made a good point, I think. 
"But you should get the facts straight the first time," you say. 
True. 
We really do try to get the story right. Every reporter, before they start writing for The Ob­server, gets a big packet explaining how to in­terview, how to write a decent opening para­graph, and most importantly, the necessity of getting the news straight. Editors are chosen primarily for their ability to check the facts and make sure they are presented logically and objectively. 
The Observer in the past has gotten high marks for objective reporting from collegiate newspaper organizations. No, we're not the New York Times. But compare us to papers at other schools our size. Keep in mind that we have no journalism major at Notre Dame, and no faculty advisorship of any sort. We do all right. 
"But if you're a newspaper, you should get the facts straight, or you should pack it up," say Observer critics. 
Put yourself in the editors' shoes. Night editors for each story must check: 
 
Are all the names spelled correctly? Look them all up in the phone book. Check their titles too. Is Szmuszkovicz a professor or an assistant or an adjunct or a visiting? 

 
Is everything attributed? Does every state­ment of fact also have a statement of source? Call the reporter and check, if he's home. Call the source and check, and then call back twice more since the source is never home. 

 
Is everything in the story factually correct? Never mind that, four times out of five you don't know a damn thing about Minority Visita­tion Weekend or Saint Mary's hall elections or whatever. You're still responsible for checking every fact in the story. 

 
Does everything conform to the Observer Stylebook (74 pages) and the Associated Press Stylebook (285 pages)? Do we put "tomorrow" or "Tuesday"? Are class titles capitalized? ·Do we write out "percent"? 



'not good' inevitable 

Mark Me Laughlin 
News Editor 



 Is everything spelled correctly? Check it twice, even if it's four in the morning, our usual time that the paper is done. 
Night editors have to do all of the above for each campus story, an average of five stories a night. Similar editing has to be done on all the Associated Press stories, once the editor plows through the 150 stories on the wire to find the decent ones. Then they must write the wea­ther, all the photo captions, all the headlines, design all the news pages, and proofread the entire news section of the paper. 
The job usually takes two people nine hours to do. Untold additional hours are spent by reporters trying to get the news. All these people are also students, with the same aca­demic loads as everyone else at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
No, all of this is not an excuse. We still have an obligation to get the news straight, and to correct it if we screw up. 
But with all the work that goes into producing this paper and getting news stories, it's inevi­table that we'll screw up sometime. Yes, stories that need corrections misinform the public. No, that's not good. All I can say is we're doing our best. Hopefully that's good enough.

Iranian boat fires on Arabian tanker 
Associated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrain-An Iranian speedboat shot up a Saudi Arabian-owned tanker in the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday after President Reagan said the U.S. Navy will no longer ig­nore attacks on noncombatants in the Persian Gulf region. 
The speedboat fired rocket­propelled grenades and ma­chine guns at the 37,011-ton Sea Trader in the strait, the south­ern entrance to the gulf. 
An unexploded rocket dangled from the Sea Trader's hull after the attack but fell into the sea before the tanker reached the port of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. 
The Indian master, Capt. 
B.R. Pagarkar, reported his vessel sustained slight damage and no casualties among the In­dian crew. 
It was not known whether any U.S. warships were near the Sea Trader during the at­tack. Navy officials do not dis­close warships' movements, but several U.S. frigates and destroyers have been in the southern gulf since last week, 
when U.S. and Iranian ships 
skirmished in the area. 
Reagan warned Iran in his 
weekly radio broadcast Satur­
day that continued attacks on 
neutral parties, including guH 
shipping, "will be very costly 
to Iran and its people." 
On Friday, U.S. officials dis­closed in Washington that the Reagan administration was planning to expand the U.S. naval role in the gulf by giving American commaders the right to intervene in Iranian at­tacks on non-U.S. flag vessels. 
Previously, U.S. warships have only been permitted to provide "humanitarian aid" to non-American ships in distress and requesting aid, but not to intercede in armed conflict in­volving those ships. 
Gulf-based shipping execu­tives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Sea Trader encountered a flotilla of six armed speedboats as it sailed into the gulf through the strait about 7:30 a.m. 
The tanker, owned by a Saudi firm but flying the Liberian flag, was bound for the Saudi oil port of Ras Tanura. 

Coast Guard might be sent to Persian Gulf 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said Sunday the United States is considering shoring up its Per­sian Gulf fleet with Coast Guard ships but U.S. officials downplayed any immediate retaliation for an Iranian at­tack on a neutral vessel. 
Admiral William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the "level of vio­lence is much less" against the Saudi-owned tanker than in the mining incident that touched off last week's U.S. retaliatory strike against two Iranian of­fshore platforms. 
"We consider our response on Monday a suitable response tor tne mmscrtmmate mining, and we do not contemplate any more violence unless Iran con­tinues what we would say is an indiscriminate and a threaten­ing pattern," Crowe said on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation." 
"And as you saw the report from the tanker, they did not feel that they had been heavily damaged," Crowe said. "And we will certainly keep those events in the calculations of this review." 
The captain of the Sea Trader said there were no casualties among the vessel's crew, but the 37,011-ton tanker sustained slight damage in the grenade and machine gun attack at 7:30 
a.m. (11:30 p.m. EDT)

Israeli army lifts Arab travel ban 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -The army lifted a four-day ban Sunday to let Palestinians travel from the occupied territories into Israel, but Arabs said soldiers wrecked homes and shops in another bid to control unrest. 
Israeli solders have killed 173 Palestinian protesters in the nearly five-month-old uprising against 21 years of Israeli oc­cupation of the West Bank and Gaza, according to U.N. fig­ures. An Israeli soldier and ci­vilian also have been killed. 
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the Cabinet that 165 Palestinians have died in the uprising, including 147 killed by soldiers, Israel radio said Sun­day. Rabin said 4,900 Pales­tinians have been detained since Dec. 8, including 1,700 held in administrative deten­tion for up to six months with­out trial. 

Police ordered Arab mer­chants in Jerusalem to open their stores at normal hours in a tug-of-war with protest leaders, who are also trying to dictate when shops may do business. 
"I am afraid for my life," 43­year-old Saleh Sagari said, ex­plaining why he opened his tiny grocery shop at hours dictated by the uprising's leaders. "If I open (during army-ordered hours), they will burn me down." 
Police in riot gear delivered the new orders to shopkeepers along the Street of the Prophets just outside the walled Old City. Officers on horses kept back curious tourists and passers­by. 
Shopkeepers could be jailed for two years if they defy the army's instructions, said police spokesman Rafi Levy. 
In the West Bank village of Bet Roch near Hebron, Arab witnesses said Ahmad Hassan Salim Amar, 23, was killed Sat­urday when he defied the army order to halt. The army said it was investigating.

Mitterrand WinS election's 
Associated Press 

PARIS -Socialist President Francois Mitterrand won the first round of the presidential election Sunday setting up a May 8 runoff with conservative Premier Jacques Chirac who finished a distant second. 
With 98 percent of the ballots counted, and with tabulating suspended for the day, Mitter­rand had 34 percent of the vote in his quest for a second seven­year term. Chirac, 55, had 19.9 percent. 
Former center-right Premier Raymond Barre, 64, finished third with 16.5 percent. He conceded defeat and called on his supporters to back fellow conservative Chirac and oust Mitterrand. 
l 
Making a strong showing in the field of nine candidates was Jean-Marie Le Pen, 59, leader of the extreme right National Front, with 14.5 percent. Le 
Pen campaigned on a toughI anti-immigration platform.

One student said he was standing next to Sauceda when the keg hit her. "The keg missed me and a friend of mine by an inch. It went between us and hit her. I don't know whe­ther it slipped out of his hand or he couldn't see where he was throwing or what," the student said.

ficials and the student body before finals, said Doyle. 
In addition, they will present a letter to the administration with student government's opinions, said Doyle. This let­ter will also summarize the sur­veys and the forums. 
Notes and comments from the forums and the survey results will be given to Univer­sity President Father Edward Malloy and other administra­tion officials responsible for implementing the suggested changes, said Doyle. 
The administration rushed to get the reports out so that the students had adequate time before exams to make their feelings known, Doyle said. 
"We heard from Monk (Malloy) and (University Ex­ecutive Vice President Father William) Beauchamp that they will take the (students') response seriously," said Doyle. 
A final report will be issued during Senior Week, he said. The administration will exam­ine the results over the sum­mer, hopefully reaching some decision before classes resume, said Doyle. 
Clarification 

Due to an editing error, a headline in Friday's Observer incorrectly listed the winner of the McCandless Hall elections. As stated in the story, Kathy Schmidt's ticket won the elec­tion with 63 percent the vote. 
round 1 
The result confirmed the growing strength of his party, which espouses a tough anti­immigration platform. 
Television computer projec­tions like that of Antenne 2 have been very accurate in past elec­tions. 
Barre conceded defeat Sun­day evening and called on sup­porters to back Chirac in the runoff. Chirac, in a joint ap­pearance with Barre at the Sen­ate building, added, "Now, against the Socialist candidate, we must rally together." 
Turnout was about 72 percent of France's 38 million voters, compared to about 81 percent in 1981, when Mitterrand won his first term. 
Mitterrand, whose popularity sank to unprece­dented lows at midterm only to soar in the last two years, will face in two weeks the hard­driving conservative who has run the government since the right won the 1986 legislative elections. 
said, adding he was about 20 feet from where the keg was thrown. "When I saw her lying on the ground and the force that knocked her down, I wouldn't have been surprised if it killed her." 
"I've never seen a keg tossed, but the guy spun around six or seven times," another student said. "I guess he mis­calculated and the keg went right into the crowd. The crowd cleared and the girl was lying on her back, bleeding from her ears," the student said. "She was lying on the sidewalk an awfully long time." 
Students said Notre Dame Security came to the scene within about five minutes. An ambulance later took her to the hospital, they said. 
The events scheduled to fol­low the Keg Toss were can­celled, students said. An Tostal Co-Chairmen Colleen Cushnie and David Duncan could not be reached for comment. 
No information has been released regarding the extent of Sauceda's injuries, Leveille said. "The worst is over. She's had a brain scan and we're waiting for the results." he said. "I think she still wants to come here."

P.O. Box Q 

Article harbors myths
Dear Editor: 
As a returning student from the Holy Land, I find it is my right as well as my duty to discount many of the so­called "facts" that Billy Lerman pre­sented in his article, "Palestine: the facts and the myths" in the April 20 edition of The Observer. 
First of all, Mr. Lerman begins his article by claiming that a chief myth of the Palestinian people is that the cause of their anguish is the Israelis themselves. Now it would be foolish to claim that all of the anguish experi­enced by the Palestinians originates with the Israelis, but it would be more than fair to say that the greater majority of it does. I base my stance on my own personal encounters with Israelis and Palestinians alike last se­mester. 
The abuse of human rights in the oc­cupied lands of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by the Israelis is appalling. To think that these acts are perpetrated by a democratic state and a close ally of the United States is sickening at best. I can recall countless conversations with Palestinians (even teenagers) who had been beaten, arrested and even tor­tured by the Israeli military for suspi­cious activity, which usually meant participation in a demonstration. One specific case that occurred while I was in the Holy Land was the rape and sub­sequent killing of a Palestinian girl, who was thrown from a moving jeep by Israeli Army members. Believe it or not, the case was covered up and the soldiers escaped punishment. 
NO support 
appreciated 
Dear Editor: 

As you may well know, our son Tom was seriously injured in a hit and run accident during spring break in Texas. While these have been trying times, Tom's condition continues to improve dramatically everyday. His spirits are high and we are sure this is largely due to the high interest shown by the Notre Dame community. We appreciate your prayers and thank you for your strong support. Tom has received an unending number of cards and flowers from well­wishers. We would like to take this op­portunity to thank you all for your generosity.

Arabs leaving not voluntary 
Dear Editor: 

In Billy Lerman's introductory par­agraph to his Viewpoint article of Wed­nesday April 20, he describes the "as­sumption" that the Palestinians were forced from their land into their present refugee camps at the hands· of Israel as being "logically as well as factually incorrect." Unfortunately, his essay seems to lack a lot of fact and logic as well. 
Mr. Lerman states that the "Arab" inhabitants of Palestine l~ft of their free will. He seems tp forget that most of them left because of the campaign of terror organized by the Zionist un­derground movements, highlighted by the Dier Yaseen massacre. They left in fear for their families and in hope of returning sm;neday. Wasn't that the case with the large numbers of Poles who left their country after the Nazi occupation to join the Free Forces in England? Presently, isn't there a large number of Afghan refugees in Pakistan who left their country to avoid the vio­lence and are waiting for the Russians to pull out in order to return to their homes? 
Mr. Lerman claims: "The reason that the number of Jews decreased is that they were in many cases formally expelled and in other cases murdered in Nazi-style attacks." I do not know if 
Mr. Lerman is aware of the fact that Arab Jews are Arabs who lived among Arabs of other religions for many cen­turies with relatively no problems. Ac­tually, it is largely thanks to Arab civilization that the Jewish civilization survived through the Dark Ages and to the post-Renaissance era. We would suggest that Mr. Lerman read about the life the Jews had in Andalusia before the fall of the Umayyad Caliphat there. It would seem logical that a large num­ber of Jews would move to a state that "represents" them and to which they are encouraged to immigrate. Thus, a large number of them left of their "free will." As f~r as "Nazi-style attacks," the only thmgs that seem to come to mind are massacres such as "Deir Yas­seen" and "Sabra and Shatila," "Nazi­style attacks" against Palestinian refugees. 
Mr. Lerman blames the Arab countries which number over 20 for not settling 700,000 Palestinians, while Is­rael managed to settle 1,200,000 refu~ees. The comparison is ridiculous, and ts yet another example of "truth distortion:" Mr. Lerman, the Jews were going to the country of their dreams, whereas the Palestinians were fleeing away from their homeland. The Arab countries' accomodation of Pal­estinian refugees is on a temporary basis, awaiting a peaceful solution. The actions of a small number of Arab leaders should not be confused with the actual policy regarding the Palestinian problem. It would be similar to assum­ing that Rabbi Kahane represents the Jews! As far as calling Arab countries "oil-rich," the label is misleading. They have their social and economic prob­lems as well. And if Mr. Lerman has to be reminded, not all of them produce oil. 
Mr. Lerman claims that Arabs who chose to remain in Israel after 1948 "celebrate full autonomy." ·What is autonomy? Is it having to possess a pass in order to move from village to village? If that is the case, we can say that they "celebrate" the same autonomy that the blacks in South Africa do! 
Mr. Lerman asks us to recall "the facts" when reading about Palestinian refugees. Whose facts, Mr. Lerman? 
Ramzi Bualuan Omar Al-Farisi Off-campus Fisher Hall April 22, 1988 

Doonesbury 
One of Mr. Lerman's own self­proclaimed goals throughout his article is the wishful attempt to dispel any myths, yet he harbors one of the biggest myths of all when he describes, in the form of a quote, that all Palestinians are terrorists, "Then we exploited them in executing crimes of murder, arson and throwing bombs upon men, women . and chidren--all this in the service of political purposes." There is no doubt in my mind that the PLO has carried out some very questionable, unjusti­fiable and criminal acts throughout the years. But, to brand a nationality of people as evil, hate-filled terrorists, as the use of the quote seems to imply, is narrow-minded as well as ridiculous. Iri my everyday dealings with Pales­tinians, I found them to be the most spirited, warm-natured and loving people that I have ever come into con­tact with. This is a commonality that I believe would be shared and attested to by the other eleven students that par­ticipated in last semester's program. 
In conclusion, I would like to label as ludicrous that belief held by Mr. Ler­man that the Palestinians are in the occupied territories simply "because of their political value in tallying world opinion against Israel." The fact is, the Palestinians are there because it is their last bastion of hope in an attempt to gain a national homeland. I am not discrediting Israel's right to exist at all, but simply recognizing the Pales­
tinians' rights  as a people and not a  
problem!

Foodshare puts dining hall food to good use 
TAMRYN ETTEN accent writer 
W 
hat happens to the food that the dining hall doesn't use? Up until a few weeks ago, the unserved food was thrown out. But due to the idealism and hard work of three Notre Dame students, some of the needy in South Bend are eating the dining hall's leftovers. 
Since March 22 Foodshare, a group of Notre Dame volun­teers, has been bringing the leftovers from North Dining Hall's evening meals to the Hope Rescue Mission in down­town South Bend, a shelter for the homeless which serves over 200 meals a day to those in need. 
"For instance if there is 55 gallons of soup cooked, and five left over, it is shipped to the mission," said William Hick­ey, director of food services. 
"Anytime we help our brot­hers out by sharing food that would be discarded, without impacting our cost, we're hel­ping out the poor souls who need help," he said. 
Senior Kathy Barron, one of the captains of the basketball team, went to Mexico with the Community for the Lay Apost­ulate (CILA) last summer and saw the starvation and poverty there. "I had seen a lot of hungry people and it bothered me," she said. 
Barron was approached by senior Jim MacDonald, who had visited a national conven­tion for Food Salvage, a similar program implemented by Har­vard and Northwestern univer­sities. Together they began researching the possibilities of starting a program at Notre Dame. 
"We researched everything-­the health aspects, legal aspects. We got names of stu­dents who were interested in helping. We wanted to cover everything before we took the idea to the administration," Barron said. 
Lisa Mackett, a freshman who worked in the dining hall, be­came involved in the project, and the three became a bar­gaining. speaking. researching and lobbying team. 
They took the idea to Univer­sity President Father Edward Malloy, "He thought it was a good idea, but he had con­cerns about the health aspect of it. But he gave us his en­couragement," Barron said. 

They discovered their ticket to success was Indiana's Good Samaritain Law which states that if an organization "in good faith makes a gift of a food item to a charitable entity is not liable for damages arising for the use, condition, quality, or content of that food item... " 
They began looking for a place to bring the food. "We asked the (Center for Social Concerns) what places in South Bend needed food. What time, facilities, and health standards they had (and) if the feeding time corresponded," Barron said. They wrote the Hope Res­cue Mission and received a hand-written positive response. 
After a few months of discus­sions with the administration, they finally agreed to try the project. The University Food Services purchased food warmers and pans, and the esc donated use of their van for the transport. 
"We were originally going to do it on Tuesday and Thursday, but then we decided if we had the food, why not every night?" Barron said. 
The students who transport the food keep a diary of what food is brought. "We look in the refreigerator. They're using it," she said. 
The mission has six different feeding times and serves about 200 meals a day. "With all the meals we have, we can use a lot of food," said Martin Polecki, social service coordina­tor for the mission. 
"If we had to purchase every­thing with as many meals as we have, it would take all of our money," he said. According to Polecki, the mission is a non-profit organization, so donated food is tax deductible. 
Next year Foodshare wants to expand their operation by using the food from both dining halls on the campus, and possibly expand the num­ber of recipients of the food. 
Their biggest challenge ahead is tactfully approaching the students on food waste. "We want people to be con­sciously aware of what they take and what they eat," Barron said, "It may seem trivial, but we're forming habits. Ones that are hard to break."

Irish find pitching 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 
How long it lasts remains to be seen, but the Notre Dame baseball team was able to solve its pitching problems Sunday afternoon at Jake Kline Field. The Irish swept a doubleheader from Illinois­Chicago 8-1 and 8-1 Sunday . after being swept at Michigan State by scores of 13-1 and 6-5 on Saturday. The two sweeps in opposite directions put Notre Dame's overall record at 25-20. 
"We knew we had to get back on the winning track," said Irish coach Pat Murphy. "We came back, and we executed when we had to." 
Notre Dame received strong pitching performances from juniors Erik Madsen and Mike Passilla, both of whom had struggled in recent outings. 
Passilla allowed just three 

hits in 6 11.3 innings in the first 
game before giving way to 
sophomore Mike Coffey. Mad­
sen pitched a complete-game 
six-hitter in the second game. 
"They both pitched with tired 

arms and got the job done," 
said Murphy. "They've got to 
get back on track, and this was 
a confidence builder for them." 
Freshman left fielder Greg 

Vogele gave Passilla all the 
runs he would need in the first 
game with a second-inning 
grand slam. Vogele's smash 
over the left field wall was the 
first collegiate home run for the 
Cincinnati native. 
"It's great to see a freshman make the gamewinning hit or homer," said Murphy. "He's been working hard. He needs a little more maturity physically and on the field, and he'll be a fine player. He deserves to play because he's been working hard." 
Notre Dame scored twice in the third and added single runs in the fourth and sixth to put 

Greg Vogele 

the game away. Coffey only had to pitch to one batter in the seventh, retiring Flame second baseman Paul Belo on a double play to end the game. 
Madsen had similar results as Passilla in the second game. The righthander from Great Falls, Mont., allowed just one run in seven innings to raise his record to 7-4. 
The Irish managed only one hit off Flame starter Craig Niedermaier in the first four in­nings, but Notre Dame still managed to score four runs during that time by taking ad­vantage of four UIC errors. 
Sophomore rightfielder Dan Peltier doubled down the right field line in the sixth inning of the contest. The hit marked Peltier's 16th double of the season, breaking the school record. 

1n sweep 
While Notre Dame had its 
way with UIC, now 12-18 on the 
year, the Irish did not have 
quite as much success against 
Michigan State. 
Mike Davidson, Scott Makarewicz and Mike Koceski helped the Spartans pound out 13 runs against five Irish pitchers for a 13-1 rout in the first game.
The Irish appeared on the verge of a split for much of the second game. A third-inning two-run single by sophomore Ed Lund, who went 4-of-4 on the game, gave Notre Dame an early 4-0 lead. 
Michigan State eventually tied the game, but Peltier boomed a home run over the scoreboard in dead centerfield to give the Irish a 5-4 lead in the seventh inning of a game scheduled for seven innings. 
Notre Dame was one out away from victory after Mad­sen, pitching in relief, retired the first two Spartan batters. Designated hitter Sean Bruce singled to keep Michigan State alive, and he scored the tying run when Rich Juday hit a double on a ball misjudged by Peltier. 
Koceki led off the eighth with a triple. Mter Madsen inten­tionally walked the next two' batters, Jeff Bouchek won the game for MSU with a single past a drawn-in outfield. 
The Irish have lost 20 con­
secutive games against Big 10 
opposition. Notre Dame will 
get two chances to end that skid 
this week at Jake Kline Field, 
as Notre Dame has a Tuesday 
game with Purdue at 2:30p.m. 
and a Wednesday game with 
Indiana at 3 p.m. 

ND comes up short in weekend action 
By FRANK PASTOR Sports Writer 
Mter all was said and done Sunday afternoon at the Eck Tennis Pavilion, the Notre Dame men's tennis team found itself the not-so-proud owner of two more losses than it had when the weekend began. 
Personal theories abounded, but no matter how you looked at it, the team's troubles boiled down to one thing -execution, or rather a lack of it. 
Following a disappointing 4-5 defeat at the hands of Kalamazoo on Saturday, the Irish (17-12) returned home yesterday where they were dominated by a disciplined Wisconsin team 8-1. 
Wisconsin stormed into town like a hurricane on Sun­day, destroying everything in its path. The Badgers, coming off big wins over In­diana and Ohio State, swept eight straight matches before the Irish pulled out a win at number-three doubles to thwart any attempt of a shutout. 
In the final match of the day, Notre Dame's senior connection, Dan Walsh and Paul Daggs, put away Brian Amero and Marc Schwartz in three sets, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to go home on a winning note. 
In Saturday's match, Notre Dame's road woes continued as it battled Kalamazoo in less than fa­
vorable weather conditions. 
However, it was the team's 
struggles with itself that 
made victory so elusive. 
Simply put, the Irish did not 
execute well enough to win. 
"I could tell you that it was 

really cold and that we 
should have played inside," 
said Bayliss. "I could tell 
you that the winds were gus­
ting up to 30-35 miles per 
hour, but these would just be 
excuses. We still should 
have won. We just didn't go 
get it in the situations that 
we could have." 
Notre Dame was tied with Kalamazoo following singles play, but Kalamazoo took two of three doubles matches to secure the vic­tory. 
Second-seeded Ryan Wenger beat Tim Hufler 4-6, 7-5, 7-5. In a battle of the Daves, N.D.'s Reiter defeated Kalamazoo's Tyg­gum 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 at number­four and Paul Odland out­scored Greg Wood 6-4, 7-6 at number-five. 
The tandem of Wenger and Brian Kalbas procured the sole doubles victory for the Irish, holding off Tyg­gum and Dave Borski 7-6,6-3 at number-two. 
"This was certainly the most disappointing loss I have suffered as a coach at Notre Dame," admitted Bayliss, "and one of the all­time most disappointin2 losses in my twenty-year coaching care,er.''

Holes filled in draft 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -NFL teams went for needs in the annual draft Sunday, picking players to fill gaping holes rather than merely taking the best avail­able athlete. 
The first eight picks went about as expected, save for the choice of Wisconsin tackle Paul Gruber by Tampa Bay with the fourth pick of the round.

both punt and kick returning, as well as at receiver. I expect he will be working extensively in all of those areas." 
Brown caught 39 passes for 846 yards in Notre Dame's 8-4 season, rolling up 1,847 all­purpose yards on 130 touches of the ball and becoming the all-time Irish leader in that cat­egory. 
"I couldn't ask for a better senior year," Brown noted. "We had a good season, win­ning the Reisman, and now to get the chance to play some­where millions of people would love to play. It's a great feeling." 
Brown watched ESPN's live telecast of the draft, and found out he was a Raider when it was announced on the air. 
"I found out just like everybody else," he said. "They called me a couple minutes afterward." 
The move to Los Angeles reunites the Dallas native with former Notre Dame quarter­back Steve Beuerlein, who was chosen by the Raiders in the fourth round of last year's draft. 
"He (Steve) called me this morning," Brown said, "and we talked about the possibility. Now we're both looking for­ward to it." 
The Patriots are looking to boost what has been a strug­gling offensive line over the past two years with the selec­tion of the 6-7, 263-pound Reh­der. Bruce Armstrong was the Pats' first-round choice in last year's draft, and Armstrong

jury to last year's Mr Bookstore John "Booger" Bus­cher last Monday. Buscher, who had sat out his team's four previous games in favor of Ad­works' supersub Marty Watts, decided to play in the champi­onship game despite fear of ag­gravating the injury. 
Before the game, Buscher, who scored three points, ex­

-
pressed concern that he might not be able to finish the contest, at which point his team would have to play the remainder of the final game at a 5-4 disad­vantage since no substitutions are allowed in Bookstore Bas­ketball. 
Watts was not officially relieved of his duties until mo­ments before gametime when an apparently confused Ricky Watters dashed through a packed Stepan Court 1 grandstand onto the court. Upon Watters' appearance, Watts made yet another contri­bution to Adworks' champion­ship run by donating his shirt 

The first pick, of course, was no surprise -linebacker Aundray Bruce of Auburn, · already signed by the Atlanta Falcons.

started on the offensive line last season. 
"Tom's a physical football player, and he has a lot of room to develop," said Dick Stein­berg, New England's player personnel director. "He's got decent speed, and good speed off the ball. We'll have to decide whether to play him at guard or tackle." 
Immediately following Reh­der's selection, Lanza heard from a Steeler representative while viewing the draft from his home in Germantown, Tenn. 
"My agent had talked to rep­resentatives of New England and Pittsburgh, and we had an idea one of those teams would take me," Lanza explained. "I was surprised Tom (Rehder) went as soon as he did, and right when they announced his name the Steelers called me and told me I was next." 
The Steelers also drafted an 
offensive lineman in the second 
round, former Kentucky guard 
Dermonti Dawson. 
"Our immediate focus right 
now is getting a person who can 
play center and get some expe­
rience there before he gets put 
in the fire," said Pittsburgh of­
fensive line coach Hal Hunter, 
who has veteran center Mike 
Webster coming out of retire­
ment for a final NFL season 
this year. "But that doesn't 
mean Lanza won't also play 
guard or tackle." 
"Playing behind Mike 
Webster is a tremendous op­
portunity for me," said the 6-2, 
270-pound Lanza. "I've ad­
mired him since I was a kid, 
and I can't think of anyone else 
I'd like to have teaching me 
how to be an NFL center. 
"I anticipate getting some 
work at guard, and maybe even 
tackle," Lanza continued. "But 
at this level you've got to be 
prepared to make some adjust­
ments." 
Watters, who had worn a 

dark shirt although his team 
had been designated to wear 
light. 
"I've got to give all the credit in the world to Marty," said Buscher, "who was there whenever we needed him throughout the tournament. He could have been out there today, too, but he gave up the chance so that I could play.''

Mark Green returned the Gold kickoff 31 yards to the Blue 44. Green rushed two times for 19 yards and Anthony Johnson once for two more and the Blue had the ball at the White 35. Cornerback Todd Lyght then picked off a Tony Rice pass at the Gold 15.
