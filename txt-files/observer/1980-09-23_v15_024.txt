Campus organizations sponsor mock election 
In cooperation with student political organizations, The Oh.rerver will sponsor a campus-wide mock presidential election on October 2. All undergraduate and graduate students are eligible to vote at both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
Balloting will take place at central locations on both campuses, at sites to be announced at a future date. Students must present their IDs to vote, and may only vote at their respective schools. 
The ballot, in addition to the presidential race, will also include the political contests in Indiana. Choices on the ballot will appear, in alphabetical order, as follows: President: John Anderson-Patrick Lucey (I) vs.Jimmy Carter­Walter Mondale (D) vs. Ronald Reagan-George Bush (R). 
Govemor: John Hillenbrand (D) vs. Robert Orr (R). US Senate: Birch Bayh (D) vs. Danforth Quayle (R). US House ofRepresentatives: John Brademas (D) vs.John Hiler 
(R). 
Also on the ballot will be a question inquiring whether or not the voter is registered in this state. Students are not required to cast votes in the Indiana elections. 
Balloting places will be open from8 a.m. to 3 p.m., manned by poll watchers from Ombudsman, College Republicans, Young Democrats, and The Observer. 
Results will be published in the October 3 edition of The Observer.

Pugilistic escalation 
Iran , Iraq claim victories 
(AP)-Iran claimed it destroyed 11 Iraqi fighters and four gunboats, and Iraq launched surprise air attacks on at least seven Iranian air in­stallations, including Tehran's international airport, as a bor­der dispute between the two nations flared yesterday. 
Iraq said it shot down six Iranian jet fighters, and President Saddam Hussein is­sued a statement that Iranian threats to ships in the Strait of Hormuz, meeting point of the Persian and Oman gulfs, con­stituted a declaration of war. 
Hussein's. statement came after Iran d~clared its coast on the Persian Gulfa war zone and warned ships against carrying supplies to Iraqi ports. British officials said a British mer­chantman was fired on, with no casualties reported, and other British vessels were believed trapped at the Iraqi port of Basra. 
Tehran Radio reported tanks battling in Khuzestan province, north of the disputed Shatt al­Arab waterway, where it claimed Iranian artillery fire destroyed Iraqi oil installations and a gas refinery at al-Faw. 
Months of border skirmishes exploded into large-scale fighting last week when Iraq cancelled a 1975 treaty that ran 60 miles of the the Iran/Iraq border down the middle of Shatt al-Arab, which provides both nations access to the Persian Gulf. Iraq now claims sovereignty over the eastern, or Iranian shore of the passage. 
Top Iranian leaders, inclu­ding Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr claimed Iraq was "incited" by the United States and acting as an American "mercenary." 

Iraq said its warplanes struck 11 Iranian airstrips with a loss of two Soviet-made MiG jets. A top Iranian military official said "several" air bases were at-. tacked, and a revolutionary guard commander said six MiGs hit seven installations. 
Although reports conflicted, both sides said air bases in Tehran, Ahvaz, Hamadan, Tabriz and Boushehr were at­tacked Iranian officals added 
Dezful and Tolumbeh Sabz to the listLand an Iraqi spokesman added Shiraz and Isfahan. 
Iran's Foreign Minister said Iraqi attacks on "airports and residential areas" killed "in­nocent people." Thick sm-oke 
rose over the airport and the thunder of the midday attack shook the capital. 

Student activities awards money to organizations 
The newly-formed Student Activity Fee Subcommittee yesterd;ty awarded$28,11 3 in ~tudent activity fees to 54 campus organizations,Subco­.nmittee Chairman James McDonnell announced. 
The allocations represent close to a 500 percent in­creaseover last -year's initial outlay of $5000. McDonnell citedthe higher student activity fees-up $8, to $25 -that are automaticallyincluded in the tuition charge, as the reason for the increase. 
Last year, he said, all the funding was handled through theStudent Union. This system forced clubs to compete for funds withstudent government groups. Now, McDonnell ex­plained, $5 out ofeach$25 is set 
aside for University clubs and is 
distrib~1 ed through tht> subco­
mmittee. 
McDonnell listed the criteria 
used in determining the al­
localionsas: the club's mem­
bership, the club's influence on 
<:ampus andthe the group's ef~ 
fort to attempt to raise funds on 
its own. 
As a rule, he said, religious and politic1l oganizations weredenied fuf)ding. ND-SMC Right to Life received $500exdusively for the pur­pose of attracting "worthwhile, educational' speakers,"he aCided.

A nuclear warhead was apparently loaded onto a flatbed truck inside two canisters labeled "Do Not Drop" and removed from a devastated Titan II missile silo site yesterday to Little Rock Air Force Base. As usual, the Air Force refused even to acknowledge that a nuclear warhead had been involved in the fuel explosion at the silo Friday. Two large canisters-one blue, the other silver and green and each labeled "Do Not Drop"-were anchored by chains to the bed ofa flatbed tractor-trailer in the convoy of . eight military vehicles. Two helicopters accompanied the procession. State police and local law enforcement officers also followed the convoy on the 90-minute trip south on U.S. 65 and Interstate 40 to the base near Jacksonville, about 12 miles northeast ofLittle Rock. It has been a long-standing Air Force policy to neither confirm nor deny the existence of nuclear warheads at the silos. The Air Force also refused to confirm numerous reports that the warhead was blown hundreds of feet from the launch hole when the silo blew up about 3 a.m. Friday.-AP 
The nine-die:it zip code should be delayed, according to Rep~ave Evans oflndiana, who says he will ask his Government Operations Committee to seek a dehy in the imposition ofthe code by the U.S. Postal Service. hvans cited huge capital costs for the Postal Service and uncstimated compliance costs for private industry. He said 

_imposition of the proposal sFtould be delayed atleast until an .tpprnpriate cost-benefit analysis -can be performed. The Postal Service first announced its intention to expand· the current five-digit zip code to nine digits in September, 1978. It would become effective early next year. Postal officials said the elongated zip would enable it to sort mail to the individual carrier route and even to a specific floor ofa large business.-AP

C;:tlling for promot releaseofthe Amencan hostages, Secretary of state hdmund S. Muskie offered respect but no apology to Iran yesterday saying its own security and Persian Gulf stability depend on a settlement. "We are prepared to do our part in resolving fairly the issues between us," Muskie said in a speech to the 
U.N. General Assembly. He said Iran could end its isolation "from those nations that live in accordance with inter­national law" and have world sanctions ended by freeing the 52 Americans held for the past 10 1/2 months. While prol)lising not to interven~ in Iranial}.,,affair~; he did not recant past U.S. support,.. for the f.i.te pro-U.S. Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

A Portae:e man was transferred to the Porter County Jair-"at Valparaiso yesterday after being charged with reckless homicide, resisting arrest and pos­'iession of a stolen vehicle in the death of a LaPorte County deputy sheriff, authorities said. LaPorte County Court]udge Paul Baldoni set bond at $1 3, 500 at a probable cause hearing for Sherman V. Kaechle, 38. He was taken from LaPorte to the Porter CountyJail while arrangements for the bond were being made, a sheriffs spokesman said. Kaechle was charged in the death of Deputy Neil Thompson ,30, New Carlisle, who died shortly after being involved in a head-on crash Sunday with an ambulance stolen from Nappanee, state police said. 

A recession-induced slumo1 in 

the demand for fuel has combined with the prospect ofa mild Indiana winter to yield an energy forecast that "is the most positive outlook in nearly a decade," according to a state report issued yesterday. William]. Watt, executive assistant to Gov. Otis R. Bowen, and Clarence Broadus, director ofthe Energy Group in the state Department of Commerce, concluded in their report that the fuel picture in Indiana for the next six months is favorable. The report began with the weather outlook, since fuel consumption rises and falls according to the winter temperatures. "Although the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will not publish its long-range winter outlook until late November, other weather stations are predicting much fairer conditions than in recent years, and so we expect a really great winter." -AP

Rumor mill holds no water 
Notre Dame has always been, and will probably always be, the rumor capital of the world-especially when it pertains to the University's athletic department. 
And now, Notre Dame's athletic department is once again the center of controversy. The most recent of rumors, however, has erupted across the street at Saint Mary's. 
Eveqone who claims to have the inside story at Saint Mary's-from security officers to section leaders-insists that they know it to be a fact that the Notre Dame athletic department is planning to gradually phase Saint Mary's stu­

eventual termination o(__ the entire ticket supply to Saint Mary's students. The story says that the Notre Dame athletic department badly wants to make as many tickets as possible available to alumni, for much more revenue can be generated in this manner. ) 
This story, however, is nothing more than that. While most of those "sources" we spoke with insisted that "I know it's a fact because she told me it was true," none of them even offered the slightest support to the rumor. Enough,said. 
Notre Dame's ticket manager for athletics, Michael Busick, helped to refute any rumors regarding the Saint Mary's student ticket si­tuation. 
"I don't know where the rumor started," said Busick. "It certainly didn't come from this office. As far as Saint Mary's students being. phased out of receiving student tickets, it is totally untrue. 
"In fact, there will be no lottery. That thought has never even surfaced." 

Busick offered that the rumor may have started because the junior and senior classes at Notre Dame were granted their request to receive blocks of tickets for the Notre Dame­Michigan State game at East Lansing on October 
4. There has been some question, Busick said, pertaining to whether or not Saint Mary's juniors and seniors could enter the lotteries at Notre Dame. 
"Maybe that's where these rumors started­

with a word here and there about lotteries and Saint Mary's students' role in them," said Busick. "The junior and senior classes requested blocks for this game at the end of last school year, and however the.y chose to lottery the tickets was up 
to them.

Iran, Algeria and Libya, the

together last week to torpedo a 
plan that would have increased 
oil prices bysmall amounts 
every three months by linking 
them to worldinflaton rates, 
currency fluctuations and

Ailey Troupe Performs Tonight 
Tonight one of America's most exciting young dance companies, the AlvinAiley Repertory Ensemble, will perform in O'Laughlin Auditorium, atSaint Mary's. The evening of dance will begin at 8 p.m. 
This superb group of young dancers has developed under the sponsorshipof the famed Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and many of the dancerS'in the ensemble will go on to join the first company. The group iscomposed mainly ofstudents from the Ailey school and come from variedbackgrounds and locations. The members are "total dancers"­
ones whocan perform ballet, and jazz and modern dancing. The Alvin Ailev Rep~ttory 
ensemble made its debut on a tele­VISion special,"Ailey Celebrates hllington." Since then the Repertory hnsemble has been drawing critical and audience acclaim for perform­ances throughout theUnited States and for appearances during the regular Ailey sessions inNew York. Dance Magazine hails the company as "exciting," and goes onto declare, "It whips the audience into an enthu­siastic frenzy the way the first company does." The first Ailey school began in Brooklyn in 1969 and was intended as a resource for the company. It was never Ailey's intention to create acarbon COJ?Y of the senior comqan~. Rather, he wanted to establish anensemble which would be a cre­ative place for young dancers to work, as wellas a fine performing group. 
Through the years, the school has "fed" the primary company, and is now the major source for the 
Repertory Ensemble. The school moved toManhattan five years ago and currently has approximately 2800 students.Alvin Ailey now wants to expand the center to make it a total dance environment-a place where design, disco dancing, etc., are added to thestandard curriculum of ballet. modern, and jazz. 
The dance center is a special school for dance in that it placesenormous emphasis on scholarships. hach spring several hundred youngdancers audition for 100 scholarships, and those who win are expected totake ten or twelve classes in modern, jazz, and ballet a week. 
The company is under the artistic direction of Sylvia Waters, aJulliard graduate who studied with Martha Graham. Ms. Waters dancedfor four years with the Bejart Company before joining the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in 1968. A lead dancer with the com­pany, she retired from dancing in 197 5 to devote her time and energies to theformation and development of the Alvin Ailey Repertory hnsemble. 
The l~nsemble has a 'unique and exciting repertoire of ballets bynew young choreographers as well as works by such famed 
choreographers .ts Donald McKayle, Talley Beatty, Dianne Mcintyre and Ailey himself. The result is a company

AI: Freeing 'Prisoners ofConscience ' 
Sandy Peterson & Jim Gates 
Situated on the southern fringes of 
Buenos Aires lies an empty lot. Once 
the sight of the infamous "Club 
Atletico," the now forgotten city 
block serves as a symbolic memorial 
to over 15,000 Argentinians who 
have disappeared since 1976. 
The following is an eyewitness 
account of the conditions and 
practices within this government­
-operated concentration· camp: 
Club Atletico operated as a sort of prisoner depot where the only law was terror. It was an underground, um,entilated place, without any natural light, and was very damp and very hot. The cells, called "tubos"(pipes}, were very small. Discipline was very st~<jct and we were shackled, which prevented us from moving more than 40 centimeters and hurt our ankles. We had tight doth blindfolds over our eyes. Atfirst, we suffered from infections, since the doth was dirty. The infection made our eyes swell, but after a time-we became immune and the swelling did not recur. We could nerther talk nor move and were always srtting ur lying down; when two prisoners were together in one cell, they could not talk. If there was just one noise, all the section 
was punished There were two sections. The guards wore soft footwear and opened the doors suddenly to see ifwe were standing up 
or not, wearing the blindfolds-for we were blindfolded even in the cells. If they saw us move our hands, even ifit was not to touch the blindfold, they beat us until we lost consciousness. 
Daniel Din ella (Prisoner} 
In late December of 1977, "Club Atletico" was closed and later de­molished. However, the systematic 
·· disruption of human rights did not cease in Argentina due to the exi­stence of an archipelago of such concentration camps. ·"Club Atletico" is only a small sample, not the exception. Most ofthe prisoners in this system are illegally abducted by government hit squads. Once kidnapped the prisoner is "tamed" via some method of brutal torture. Most of the 15,000 are known as "desapricidos," the disappeared ones. The majority of the prisoners are eventually "trans­ferred" to a point offinal destination. The term "transferred" is merely a prison euphemism for execution. There are many methods of "transferring" a prisoner. For example, a method favored by the Air Force is to heavily sedate a group of transferrees who are loaded onto a cargo plane and dumped out over the Atlantic Ocean. Amnesty International has led a world-wide campaign against the brutal practices of the Argentinian military dictatorship. This campaign is still in progress and will not be given up until all illegally held citizens of that nation are released. Amnesty International, as its name implies, is an iqternational organi­zation working for the amnesty of human beings detained worldwide for their beliefs, race, color, or religion, provided they neither used 
nor advocated violence. Such per­sons are termed "prisoners of con­science." 
Amnesty International's most ef­fective tool is that of international public opinion and the publicity it creates. lwen the most repressive 
governments  are  sensitive and  re­ 
sponsive to this public pressure.  
First,  Amnesty  investigates  the  

case of a prisoner of conscience. When it is determined that he or she is being detained in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UN, 1948), A.I. "adopts" the prisoner. A complete information packet on this POC is then passed on to one or several "Adoption Groups" which exist worldwide. These groups begin a major letter­writing/publicity campaign on behalf of their adopted prisoner. They contact government officials, ap­propriate embassies, prison officials; if possible they write to the prisoner or his or her family. Often the a­doption groups will participate in "special country campaigns" to alert the international public to the a­larming human rights situation of a particular country. 
Since its inception in 1961, Amnesty International has secured the release of over 13,000 prisoners of conscience. That's a lot; but not enough. Hundreds of thousands more remain in prisons, concentra­tion camps, psychiatric hospitals. 
Amnesty's ongoing battle against tyranny and repression of human rights is being supported by AIUSA Adoption Group 43 here at Notre Dame. Since its tormation in 1977, five of our adopted prisonerll have been released-in the Philippines, Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Argentina, Cameroun, and just recently, in Pakistan. We have continued to support our Rhodesian prisoner financially, so that he may receive a high school education and provide for his family. 

Working with Amnesty International is enlightening and gratifying, often frustrating, hut always important. If you arc inter­ested in working with AI or finding our more about it, come to the organizational meeting on Thursday, September25, 1980at4:15 p.m. in La Fortune or contactSandy Peterson at 283-7863 or Jim Gates at 272-7051.

NCAA, Get your act together 
Many, many young men were . suffering crippling injunes and even death tn college football games as formations like the flying wedge and the V-formation were taking their toll. The casualty rate was so high and the concern so widespread, that the president summoned college officials to the White House and told them to do something about ir, 
Almost sounds impossible, doesn't it? But unfortunately, this was the case in 1905 when President Theodore Roosevelt initiated a loose­knit, 38-member group which gradually expand­ed it's authority into what we know today as the N a tiona) Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). 
The principals on which the organization began were admirable ones. The NCAA was to serve as the governing body for most collegiate athletics, with it's main concerns being directed towards it's member schools and the student athletes. 
That was 75 years ago. 
Today, the NCAA gets the "Thunbs Down," for becoming so bogged down in bureaucratic red tape and organizational inefficiency, charac­teristic of another governing body, the big one in Washington, D.C. 
Notre Dame football fans can easily remember the recent fiasco regarding the televising of Irish football contests on WNDU-TV. The underlying principle on which the NCAA based its decision not to allow the games on the air, was that since roughly 40 c9-'-lle television companies ~it~in 100 miles or so of South Bend were ptckmg up WNDU for their subscribers, other NCAA-mem­ber schools were being hurt at the box office. 
Hogwash. 
Do you expect me to believe that ] oe ] oe the Dog-Face Boy is going to attend a game at St. ] oseph's Co1lege just because Notre Dame is not on the tube? 
That particular decision also lacked consisten­cy. Did you happen to notice how it was just the local stations that were affected and not the "Big Momma," ABC. The dollar can be heard singing in the distance. 
The mess was finally cleared up after the folks at Channel 16 secured a letter from each of the cable outlets, promising that their subscribers would not recetve the game telecast. That way, 
Michael Ortman 
only those in the immediate WNDU viewing audience could watch. . 
Yet the NCAA's logic can be even more far-fetched. Remember the spring of 1979 when that marvelous governing body barred Notre Dame's varsity basketball players from partici­pating in the campus-wide Bookstore Basketball tournament. Extra practice, they said, which would give Digger Phelps' men an unfair advantage over their regular season rivals. 
Wait, there's more. 
Does the name Marc Kelly ring a bell? He's the walk-on Notre Dame basketball player who filled a minor role in the movie "Fast Break," for which he received about $650. Now Marc will be the first to tell you that he poses no potential threat to UCLA* Indiana, DePaul or Maryland. Nonetheless, the NCAA told Kelly that if he did not return the money, he would lose his amateur status and thus, be barred from NCAA basketball competition. 
Marc, as you may remember, returned the money. I guess that means Burt Reynolds is a pro football player. 
Meanwhile, the NCAA is failing miserably to perform the vital functions that it must, if collegiate athletics are soing to survive in our somewhat corrupt envtronment. Things like recruiting violations and the fixing of academic transcripts are becoming common-place on many college campuses. And what is the NCAA doing about it? 
How much can it do with an enforcement department made up of 17 people. ? 
That's right, 17 people. The more astounding fact is that only eisht of them are full-time investigators! Yep, etght people to keep track of the violations at over 800 member instutions. 
"We had two people in 1971," David Berst,

Coash stars ,but unbeaten Irish dump Belles , 6-3 
By Mark Hann11ksela Sports Writer 
Patsy Coash put on a show last night at SaintMary'sAngela AthleticFacility. Unfortunately for her Belle teammates, she was one of thefew bright spots in an otherwise dismal 6-3 loss to Notre Dame inwomen's tennis action yesterday.

[continued on page 11] 

Complacency a problem? 
OK, first question: 
Everyone who thought the football team would be 2-0 at this point, stand up and yell, "I did!" 
Liar. 
But have no fear, because you were most certainly not alone in your skeptical pre-season appraisal of the 1980 Fighting Irish. 
2-0?!! 
No doubt the smart money would have laughed uproariously at such a suggestion right up until kickoffon opening day. But, then again, quite a few gamblers spend a lot of their time in bread lines, don't they? 
In any case, here stand the Irish, undefeated, with two of the season's most challenging opponents buried beneath the grass of Notre Dame Stadium. 
Which brings me to my next question: 
Where do they go from here? 
I guess being undefeated after two tough games is a lot like getting a date with the best looking person in your class. At first you feel great-
But then what do you do? 
Fortunately, Dan Devine is not without an answer to that question. (The one about the football team, that is.) 
"Why, we get ready to play Michigan Stai:e," he said-which is pretty much what you would expect him, or any coach in his position, to say. 
"I think the players and coaches deserve a little time to savor this one, but on Monday the only thing we'll be thinking about is Michigan State. ­
"The worst thing that can happen to a football team is to start living on past laurels. We certainly have a right to be proud ofwhat we've accomplished, but we're not going to beat 

Frank LaGrotta 

Michigan State or anyone else by showing them our newspaper clippings." Wait a minute, Dan; we're not talking about complacency here, are we? 
"I don't think complacency will be a problem with this team,'' he smiled when asked that question. "All we have to do is keep looking at our schedule. That should keep us humble." 
How true. Nevertheless, it is a fact offootball that teams do not get as motivated to play schools like Michigan State and Miami as they do Alabama or U.S.C. 
And therein, I think, lies the immediate task facing the Irish. There is no good reason why they cannot fly down to Birmingham on November 14 with this same goose-egg in the loss column. However, in order to do that, the real opponent they must guard against is complacency. 
"A team that thinks it has arrived usually ends up on the bottom," pointed out Pittsburgh Steeler head coach, Chuck Noll, in a recent New York Times Magazine feature. Words from a man who knows perhaps more than anyone should about winning and losing. 
"Any team is capable of defeating any other team," Noll cautioned. "Upsets happen all the time." 
Ok, last question: Anyone who thinks the Irish will finish this season, 11-0, stand up and yell "I d0.f" 
Well? We're waiting...
