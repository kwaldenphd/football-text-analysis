Student reaction to possible changes mixed 
By JOE TROMBELLO 
News Writer 
Student reaction to the programs described by College of Arts and Letters Dean Mark Roche and other faculty members that aim to increase academi~ opportunities outside the classroom was mixed. Most students said that they believed students could benefit greatly from increased funding and interaction with faculty members while others said they thought the money could be better used elsewhere. 
Robert Gibbs, a sophomore finance/psychology major, said that he thought business students would benefit from increased lectures on campus but not necessarily from increased funding for research.

Saint Mary's was recently fea­tured on the popular morning tel­evision show "Uve with Regis and Kelly," when co-host Kelly Ripa received a brochure and video that highlighted various aspects of the school from the College's Marketing Communications Department. 
During the segment, which aired Oct. 22, Ripa showed co­host and Notre Dame graduate' Regis Philbin the brochure that featured her in several of the pic­tures, thanks to computer repro­ductions of the images. She is fea­tured "playing basketball" and "making friends with the student body".

SMC debates current events in CatholicisiTI 
By NICOLE ZOOK 
News Writer 
In light of recent issues affecting the Catholic Church such as priest scandals and the Sept. 29 papal appoint­ment of 31 new cardinals, the question is raised to what degree such issues should spark discussion within the Saint Mary's community. 
Special interest is given to the amount of discussion these events receive within the curriculum given that the College is a Catholic institu­tion. 
Joe Incandela, a professor in the religious studies department, said that he believes that religious studies courses offered at Saint Mary's address current events in the Catholic Church but added that the courses do not focus solely on such events. Instead, he feels that because a large percentage of the Saint Mary's population is Catholic, conversations are placed in the context of a 2,000 year-old tradition. 

"A large part of what a tra­dition is, is an argument across the years about what to value, retain or jettison as time passes," Incandela said.

U.S. should hit the books 
America .seems to have begun to model one of the characters in e. e. cummings's war story The Enormous Room -le Directeur. 
As head of the prison, le Directeur knows well how to use fear to 
Dolores Dlaz 
maintain power. He instills this 
Viewpoint
fear through 
three means: his Copy Editor 
subordinates, 
punishment and 
direct contact with prisoners. 
The United States aims to instill fear in terrorists through its subor­dinates by using the North Atlantic 

I. 
Treaty Organization (NATO). Following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S., Secretary General Robertson invoked Article V of the alliance's constitution, which states that an attack on one is seen as an attack on all. America intends to strike fear into the hearts of ter­rorists but ends up intimidating its allies by pressuring them into upholding its views. The fear America wishes to instill in terror­ists may only get there by making our allies nervous and escalating the atmosphere of fear worldwide. 
The prison's most dreaded form of punishment was known as cabinot, or solitary confinement. By desig­nating Iran, Iraq and North Korea as the "axis of evil," the U.S. casts out these countries from the civi­lized world. However, this fear is felt by the other countries of the world, as well. The fear of isolation is present to countries that must be cautious of being associated with countries designated by a super­power as an "axis of evil." It becomes a playground conflict on a dangerous scale: Be friends with the enemy of a superpower and risk your own prosperity. 
Finally, the greatest fear le Directeur instills comes from direct contact with his prisoners. The ulti­mate fear invoked by the U.S. is the threat of war. Not only has the U.S. war on terrorism and the fear asso­ciated with it touched the U.S., its allies, enemies and the rest of the world, but has real links to the war in Iraq which continue to affect the world arena. 
What is it that le Directeur can teach the U.S. about the war on ter­rorism and the fear it creates? Although the U.S. still has what we hope are a number of allies, the fact 
that they have been forced to view 
our actions with caution could 
weigh on future relationships. CNN 
commented in February of 2003 
that foreign nations are beginning 
to consider the U.S. a bigger threat 
to world peace than Iraq. 
Let us learn from le Directeur. The 
U.S. needs the support of foreign countries and to be seen as logical and dependable. Clear objectives and real enemies in the war on ter­rorism would help to make foreign support a reality, work to heal for­eign relations and ease fears. It is only once we identify the disastrous potential of America that we may find a way to avoid this end.

Amorous ram blamed for mysterious signals 
LONDON -A mysterious transmission that baffled British intelligence analysts for days was caused by a ram rubbing up against an aerial mast, a government agency said Thesday. 
Scientists at Government Communications Head­quarters in Cheltenham, western England, an intelli­gence-gathering station, were baffled by strange high-frequency noises com­ing from Scarborough sig­nal station in Yorkshire. 
GCHQ's in-house paper, the Daily Observer, said the noises were unlike any­thing staff had encountered before and an investigating team initially thought they were coming from spies or aliens. 

Their investigation found the signal only happened in the day time, went across all the high-frequency bands and only Scarborough aerials could pick it up. 
Eventually, investigators discovered that a ram was rubbing its horns against the aerial masts "in between servicing some local ewes," the paper said. Ad showing helium Inhaling Is criticized

"If they had Latin American music [as a major], I'm there!" she said. 
Students said they were excited about the segment, which aired during Saint Mary's fall break. 

"I couldn't believe it when I saw it. I actually saw it for the first time when I came back to school, and I was so honored to hear them talk about Saint Mary's," junior Amy Nicholson said. "It's awesome to think that we are being talked about on a nationally televised show that so many peo­ple watch." 
Junior Kathleen Murphy said the show has increased aware­ness about the College. 
"I heard about it when I was in a salon over break, and a lady sit­ting next to me asked where I went to school," she said. "When I told her I went to Saint Mary's, she got really excited and told me how Kelly was talking about our school on the show the day before, and commented on what a nice school it seemed like:" 
Philbin, an avid Notre Dame supporter, has mentioned to his co-host several times that she should get her degree from Saint Mary's. Philbin and Ripa wore Saint Mary's College T-shirts on a prior episode.

Conference examines ministry 
By MATTHEW SMEDBERG News Writer 
In what was at times a highly emotional atmosphere in McKenna Hall, pastors and reli­gious ministers_from around the country met to discuss the issues which face them in their ministry. About 40 participants listened to addresses by both active pastors and university researchers, often punctuating their thoughts with the occasional "Amen!" or "God bless you, brother." 
The conference was organized in conjunction with research being done by professors David Sikkink of Notre Dame and Michael Emerson of Rice University under the sponsorship of the Lilly Foundation. 
The purpose of the conference was to bring those involved in ordained ministry together to dis­cover what issues they found most pressing in their ministqo. Four speakers addressed the con­ference, and three additional con­ference sessions were devoted· to group discussion and open forum. 
Speaking Tuesday afternoon, Jackson Carroll, professor emeri­tus of Divinity at Duke University, addressed many of .the changes which are going on in the world outside the church building which affect how ministry functions. 

"The Church has always been called to be transformative, not conformative," he said. Carroll spoke of the "commodification of religion", which he related to the "culture of options" which mod­ern America presents. He spoke with sadness of a "market-shaped Church, [in which] everything is optional." 
Speaking after Carroll, Hycel Taylor spoke of his experiences with ministry in African­American Baptist churches. Taylor is an associate of activist Jesse Jackson, and he spoke about his efforts to empower the African-Americans to whom he ministers. So much of the margin­alization r.nd racism which sur­roundsu5.·he said, is due to divi­sive mistrust and prejudice within the black community. 
"Some say that it is us versus them," he said. "It isn't us versus them -it is all too often us against us." 
In the conference's concluding address, Father Virgil Elizondo left many conference participants amazed with his description of the work he did to revitalize the ministry of the San Fernando Cathedral in San Antonio. The cathedral became a spiritual ral­lying place for the Hispanic and Chicano population of San Antonio. Its parishioners would brave the Texas heat to attend Mass in the centuries-old church and built a vibrant community around its focus. After his retire­ment from diocesan work, Elizondo came to Notre Dame, where he holds a visiting profes­sorship in theology.

assault charges within the Church, Incandela feels it con­tinue to be discussed in con­text within the department. 
"I imagine that the priest scandals are spoken about in some classes, and I remember a lecture by Margaret O'Brien Steinfels for the Center for Spirituality noontime series last year," Incandela said. 
O'Brien Steinfels visited the campus last March to discuss the scandal that rocked the Church. Her lecture was the first in the Center's annual Lenten Lecture Series. 
Currently the College's Center for Spirituality, under the direction of Sister Kathleen Dolphin, continues to present issues to the cam­pus in appropriate settings. 
"Most frequently, what we have been doing is using the Catholic Common Ground conversations," said Sister Rose-Anne Schultz, the College's vice president for mission. "That's one of the main ways we have been get­ting the campus into discus­sion together." Saint Mary's and the Catholic Common Ground Initiative began a partnership in 2001, focusing on the promotion of small group dialogue. Since then, about 10 major issues have been discussed in these con­versations. 
However, the College real­izes that not everyone in the Saint Mary's community is Catholic, officials said. As such, it strives to inform on issues rather than push them into mainstream academia. 

lncandela believes that Saint Mary's does not overstep these boundaries. In his opin­ion, pushing Catholicism occurs only if Catholic-only views are presented in cours­es and lectures with no avenue for dissenting views or if students are rewarded in grades for expressing Catholic views in class but penalized for other views. 
"I am confident that neither of these conditions [exists] at Saint Mary's," Incandela said. 
Freshman Angie Ellison agrees. "I don't really think that major Catholic issues are discussed a lot," she said. "In a situation where Catholicism is brought up, though, I think pushing Catholicism rather than just informing people about the issues occurs when the Catholic won't hear any other view and/or says that it's wrong. I'm not seeing any boundaries overstepped here at all." 
The Center for Spirituality and other campus groups continue to bring speakers to campus that will focus on important issues. They said they hope to encourage dis­cussion among and between the students and faculty of Saint Mary's. 
Incandela also continues to urge his students to study the issues themselves and to actively engage in such con­versations. 
"My view is that important issues cannot be discussed enough."

INDIANAPOLIS -Tight mayoral races drew to a close across Indiana Tuesday, with campaigns in Fort Wayne and Evansville among the state's most competitive. 
As polls closed, Democrats held 63 of Indiana's mayoral ol1ices, while Hepublicans had 54. 
The state parties said they each spent more than $750,000 on local races, in part because city hall victories could help build support for next year's state elections, including the race for governor. 
Arafat refuses to form cabinet 
Palestinian president blocks new cabinet posts, slowing peace talks with Israel 
Associated Press 

RAMALLAH, West Bank -Vasser Arafat delayed the formation of a new Cabinet on Tuesday by blocking his premier's choice for security chief, a move that will slow efforts to restart peace talks with Israel after a three-month freeze, Palestinian offi­cials said.

with Arafat on Tuesday, 
but could not resolve the

Underlying the argu­ment is Arafat's refusal to relinquish control over some of the security serv­ices. Qureia's candidate for interior minister, Gen. Nasser Yousef, seeks broad powers. 
Qureia's emergency gov­ernment expires Tuesday, but he said he would present his new Cabinet to parliament by next week.

"Students really do the pro­gramming and the organization. I just give them whatever support and assistance they might need," she said. 
In addition to the two academic events each year, all dorms hold a discernment dinner with a dorm of the opposite sex. Ten students -five from each dorm -participate in a dinner with between four and five faculty members to foster greater inter­action. These dinners are usually catered affairs, and students are provided with the necessary funding. 
Lauren Williams, Pangborn academic commissioner, said she is also working on a Hall Fellows program with Ryan. The pro­gram compiles a list of faculty members who have expressed an interest in holding academic affairs in residence halls and dis­tributes this list to the academic commissioners, who have a net­work from which to recruit. Williams said at least 40 faculty members from several colleges have expressed an interest. 
"Part of the problem with fac­ulty/student interaction is that students never know how far fac­ulty are willing to go, [if they are willing to work outside of the classroom)," she said. "This [pro­gram] is encouraging [because] they [academic commissioners] can call the faculty member and not be denied." 
In response to the push to have in-hall discussions with faculty, several academic commissioners said they have already planned activities. 
Greg Downey, assistant profes­sor of anthropology, spoke Oct. 8 in Lewis Hall to begin the "Last Lecture Series." 
Downey said although he enjoyed giving his lecture in the hall, he was a bit disappointed with the lack of student engage­ment in the material. He said very few students asked ques­tions during the lecture or spoke with him afterwards. 
"Students didn't really engage the ideas I was talking about, which is fine," he said. ''I've gone to talks and thought about them a lot, but said nothing at the time I heard them. I don't think stu­dents need to be prepared in some sort of 'cram-before-the­test' kind of way to engage in dis­cussion, but they have to be interested in discussion for its own sake or because they care about the subject." 
In addition to the Last Lecture series, other dorms have spon­sored events that bring faculty into the dorms. Zach Goodrich, Alumni Hall academic commis­sioner, said that his dorm has sponsored a weekly event called Night of Faith, in which different faculty member discusses the experiences that faith has: 
brought. Pangborn Hall spon~sored a "Politics, Pop and Pizza" night. in which Christina Wolbrecht, associate professor o political science, watched two episodes of The West Wing with students and engaged in a dis­cussion on the issues raised after the viewing. Wolbrecht said she enjoyed the 
event. which she described as "a nice and unusual opportunity to talk with students [outside of the. 
classroom)." 
Wolbrecht also said the activity showed that academic engage­ment can be packaged in ways that students will also fmd enjoy­able.

Mundy also noted that Notre Dame admissions counselors had been involved in College Board discussions on the SAT revisions. He attended the College Board's meeting last fall and said that admissions director Dan Saracino was currently attending the College Board's national conference. 
Students who took the SAT last year said they thought the revisions could have mixed results, raising questions that have been a part of the nation­al debate over SAT revisions.

being considered for the future to increase funding and provide more opportunities for student contact with faculty members outside of class. 
Faculty Initiatives 
Mark Roche, dean of the College of Arts and Letters, said a greater number of programs need to exist for students who wish to become more academi­cally involved. 
"For students that have the capacity and the intellect ... [we] need to provide more opportuni­ties for them to engage in intel­lectual [life]." he said. 
To combat these problems, Roche said numerous programs exist to provide students with funding for academic projects outside of the classroom. For example, the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program provided $90,000 in student funding for the 2002-03 academ­ic year, while the Undergraduate Intellectual Initiative Program, a pool of money that allows stu­dents to travel off-campus for "special learning experiences," allocated $40,665 to Arts and Letters undergraduates. 
Roche said that other initiatives -such as the first-year convoca­tion, and a new program called Residing in the World of Ideas, which brings faculty and students together in the residence halls to engage in academic discourses ­will increase faculty/student con­tact. 
In addition to these programs. a new initiative this year created by Ed Cohen. associate editor of Notre Dame Magazine, provides a more entertaining forum. Entitled Irish Inquisition. the pro­gram brings faculty together in an inquisition format typical of the Middle Ages to discuss cur­rent topics. The next date is ten­tatively set for Nov. 18. 
"If students go to anything, it has to be fun and as little like a lecture as possible," Cohen said. 
Roche said he is considering future programs that will also increase student academic engagement. For example, he is envisioning a summer reading program where seniors will even­tually lead juniors in discussions on a book they select. The books will vary based on major and will provide a small group format in which students can engage in conversation. 
Some faculty also said that they would like to see undergraduate research become more common. Sunny Boyd, associate professor of biological sciences, said that this requirement, which she had as a Princeton undergraduate, led to her decision to enter the world of academia. 
"We could at least give it [undergraduate research] the same push as study abroad pro­grams have had [here)." she said. Student programs 
In response to the need to cre­ate more opportunities for stu­dent/faculty interaction, student Academic Commissioners from each dorm have been working to invite faculty into the residence halls. With increased funding and support from Maura Ryan, asso­ciate provost, dorms are expect­ed to have at least two academic­related events per year. 
The Advisory Committee on Academic and Student Ufe, real­izing the need for a link between the University and student aca­demic commissioners, appointed Ryan last year to serve as this liaison. Ryan stressed that her role is only advisory and students are responsible for participation in the planning of each faculty 
tive in any way and proved 
-invaluable to her research expe­rience. "I think that the money is there for those who have the interest in doing undergraduate research; it's just a matter of putting the time in to apply for it," she said. In contrast with other under­graduates, junior theology major Eric Wooldridge said that although he could find some uses for the funds with respect to his work with Circle K, he believes that the money could be better used for other initiatives. "Overall, I would rather see that type of money go more toward financial aid and other university programs," he said. "I don't think they are as useful to students as maybe some other things would be."

Gibbs said that some business students he has spoken to seemed uninterested in pursuing research. 
"For business students. it doesn't seem like there is a lot of interest to go out and do research," he said. "It's hard to see the connection between the things you might be researching and immediate business applica­tions." 
In contrast, Mary Mullen, a senior honors program partici­pant and English/political sci­ence major, said that she thought increasing funding for student research and conference travel would prove especially useful because it would allow students writing senior thesis projects to have better access to primary sources. She also said that these resources may encourage more students to pur­sue research. 


"I think that they [University initiatives] are a great opportu­nity and a lot of my friends have felt the same way. To have the opportunity to do independent research is something that's incredible," she said. "By giving funding, it [the University] allows everyone to do it [research] and encourages you to think about [academic subjects] outside of the classroom." 
Mariah Quinn, also an honors program student, said that she used grant resources from the honors program and the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts to visit the Yosemite and Grand Canyon National Parks to conduct research this summer for her thesis. Quinn said the grants were not restric­

IN BRIEF 
Banker Quattrone will be retried 
NEW YOHK-The government said Tuesday it will retry Frank Quattrone, the wealthy Internet-boom investment banker whose first trial ended last month in a hung jury. 
Prosecutors announced their plans in an evening letter to the federal judge overseeing the case. It said the government and defense attorneys were still discussing a date for the retrial. 
Quattrone's attorney expressed disappoint­ment and insisted his client is innocent. 
Quattrone, among the highest-profile defen­dants in the government's two-year crack­down on white-collar corruption, is charged with obstruction of justice and witness tam­pering. 
The heart of the case is a single-sentence e­mail he sent Dec. 5, 2000, to employees at Credit Suisse First Boston, endorsing a previ­ous note that had urged them to "catch up on file cleanup" by destroying some files. 
The government contends the note was an attempt to obstruct federal investigations into how the bank decided who would get shares of hot new stocks it was taking public during the Internet stock boom. 
Cuba, U.S. examine business deals 
IIAVANA-Cuba signed contracts with nine American companies at an island trade fair Monday, saying it reflected a move to more normal ties with the United States. 
Cattle and soybeans, newsprint and fruit juice were among the goods listed in $30 mil­lion worth of contracts, according to Pedro Alvarez, head of the Cuban state export com­pany, Alimport. 
After signing a grain deal with Cargill Inc. Vice President Jim Bohlander, Alvarez said that $4 million contract "is one more step in the normalization of relations" between the two countries. 
All of the companies that signed contracts on Monday had already done business with Cuba. 
Interest in the new market just offshore has contributed to a growing call by U.S. farm state lawmakers to abolish the 42-year-old 
U.S. trade embargo against Cuba.

SEC checks mutual fund fraud 
Massachussetts security regulators investigate potential wrongdoing by Fidelity 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The government is conducting a broad sweep of the mutual fund industry and more charges are likely in the growing scandal in the $7 trillion business, a top enforcement official said Tuesday. 
Stephen Cutler. head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division, told Congress that the SEC plans to send notifications to some firms this week that investigators intend to file civil charges. Ile did not name any of the com­panies nor did he say how many would receive the legal warnings.

CBS cancels Reagan miniseries 
Network claims film crossed line into partisan advocacy and distortion 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Capping an extraordinary conservative furor over a movie virtually no one has seen. CBS said Tuesday it will not air "The Reagans" and shunt it off to the Sh.gwtime cable network instead. 
Based on snippets of the script that had leaked out in recent weeks, conservatives, including the son of the former president, accused CBS of dis­torting the legacy of Honald Beagan. 
While CBS said it was not bowing to political pressure, critics said that was exactly the case, and worried about the effects of such pre-emptive strikes on future work. 
CBS believed it had ordered a love story about Ronald and Nancy Reagan with politics as a backdrop. but instead got a film that crossed the line into advo­cacy, said a network executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
The film had been scheduled to air Nov. 16 and 18, in the heart of the November ratings sweeps. CBS attempted to edit the film to remove offending passages, but gave up. 
"We believe it does not pres­ent a balanced portrayal of the Reagans for CBS and its audi­ence," the network said in a statement Tuesday. 
Neal Gabler, author of "Life the Movie: !low Entertainment Conquered Reality." said CBS' decision was unhealthy for democracy. 
"CBS, in pulling this film, did incredible harm. much more harm than they could ever have done in making the film," Gabler said. "What they've told us now is that a very small group of people have censorship power over the broadcast net­works." 
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, 0-S.D.. said CBS' deci­sion "smells of intimidation to 
me." But conservatives said it was a question of accuracy. 
The miniseries became a hot topic on talk radio and the TV news networks. The chairman of the Republican National Committee wrote to CBS President Leslie Moonves, ask­ing for historians to review the movie, and the conservative Media Research Center asked advertisers to consider boy­cotting the film. 
"This was a left-wing smear of one of the nation's most beloved presidents and CBS got caught," said Brent Bozell, founder of the Media Research Center. 
Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie said putting the movie before a smaller audience on Showtime doesn't address accu­racy concerns. Without changes, Showtime should remind viewers every 10 min­utes that the movie is fictional, he said.

FCC to limit Internet 
piracy of TV shows 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The gov­ernment Tuesday approved an anti-piracy mechanism that will make it harder for com­puter users to illegally distrib­ute digital TV programs on the Internet. The goal is to speed the transition to higher quality digital broadcasts and ensure such programming remains free. 
Broadcasters and the movie industry had urged the Federal Communications Commission to take such action, while consumer groups 
said it will force some people to purchase new electronics. 
Some people already share TV shows and movies online, though the practice is limited by the speed of Internet connections -it can take many hours to transfer high-quality copies. 
But as Internet connections get faster and broad­casters switch to 
''The FCC has now given these same {big media] companies more control over what users can do with that content, leaving consumers as two-time losers. " 
Glgl Sohn president Public Knowledge 
much clearer digital television, the movie and television indus­tries fear consumers will put high-quality copies of shows and films on the Web that oth­ers can download for free. This would reduce the broad­casters' ability to sell the shows for syndication or over­seas. 
The music industry saw CD sales fall as free music sharing proliferated on the Internet. It has started to sue listeners who illegally distribute songs online. 
The five-member FCC voted unanimously to allow a "broadcast flag" to be added to digital programming to block broader distribution on the Internet, though the two Democrats on the panel expressed some reservations. Republican FCC Chairman Michael Powell called it "an important step toward pre­serving the viability of free over-the-air television." 
In its order, the FCC told makers of digital television receivers that by July 1, 2005, their models must recognize the flag, an electronic signal that broadcasters can embed in their programs. 
The commission said the order applies only to electron­ics equipment that can receive digital broadcast signals, not digital VCRs, DVD players and personal computers without digital tuners. 
"The FCC scored a big victo­ry for consumers and the preservation of high-value, over-the-air free broadcasting with its decision," said Jack Valenti, president of the 

Call259·1ooo for more details 
Motion Picture Association of America. 
Viacom, parent company of the CBS television network, called the decision a "historic step forward for consumers." 
Consumer and advocacy groups reacted just as strongly against the decision. 
"Having just given big media companies more control over what consumers can see on their TV sets by lifting media ownership limits, the FCC has now given these same compa­nies more control over what users can do with that content, leaving consumers as two-time 
losers," said Gigi Sohn, pres­ident of Public Knowledge, a Washington­based advocacy group on tech­nology and copyright issues. 
Congress already has told the TV industry to switch their broadcasts by 2007 to a digital format, which uses computer language, from the current ana­

log format, which uses radio signals sent as waves. After the switch over, consumers who don't subscribe to a cable or satellite service would need digital tuners, either inside a TV or in a set-top box. 
FCC officials said the flag would not prevent consumers from using existing or new DVD or VCR machines to make copies ofTV programs. But the signal is designed to make it more difficult for consumers to then transfer those copies to the Internet and make them available to potentially mil­lions of others free of charge. 
Chris Murray, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, said con­sumers won't be able to use their old VCRs and DVD play­ers to play back programs recorded on newer machines that recognize the broadcast flag. 
"Technology always marches on, but that's normally because new devices offer con­sumers better features and more flexibility to woo buyers in the marketplace, not because government fiat has rendered a particular technol­ogy obsolete," Murray said. 
Under the FCC order, broad­casters will decide whether to add the flag to their programs, including, if they want, news and public alTairs shows. Cable and satellite operators must also make sure that their sys­tems transmit the flag or use some other electronic signal to prevent mass copying. The FCC plans to consider whether to allow cable and satellite 
companies to encrypt all digi­
tal programs. 
FCC Commissioner Michael 
Copps said the decision did 
not go far enough to safe­
guard viewers' privacy. 
"Improper use of the tech­
nologies could arguably allow 
such things as tracking per­
sonal information," Copps 
said. "The broadcast flag 
should be about protecting 
digital content, not about 
tracking Americans' viewing 
habits."

Re-examine use of 
death penalty 
If you favor the death penalty, you have to defend some 
pretty bizarre results. 
Before most readers of this column wore born, Charles 
Singleton was sentenced to death in Arkansas in 1979 for 
murdering Mary Lou York by stabbing her twice in the neck 
during his robbery of her family's grocery 
store. In 1997, Singleton's claim that he 
Charles Rice 

was incompetent. and therefore ineligible 
for execution was denied because he was 
voluntarily taking anti-psychotic drugs 
that made him competent. The State of Right or 
Arkansas then put him on a mandatory Wrong? 
anti-psychotic drug regime on the ground 
that he was a danger to himself and to 
others. When the state scheduled his execution in 2000, 
Singleton claimed that the state could not compel him to take 
drugs to make him competent enough to be executed. 
The Supreme Court has forbidden the execution of those 
who are so incompetent that they "are unaware of the pun­
ishment they arc about to suffer and why they are to suffer 
it." The Court also held that a State may forcibly give anti­
psychotic drugs to an inmate "who has a serious mental ill­
ness ... if the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and 
the treatment is in the inmate's medical interest." Singleton 
argues that while medication relieves his psychosis it is not 
in his "ultimate best medical interest" because it would qual­
ify him to be executed. 
The United States Court of Appeals said that "Singleton 
presents ... a choice between involuntary medication fol­
lowed by execution and no medication followed by psychosis 
and imprisonment." The court upheld the involuntary med­
ication which alleviates his psychosis and has no significant 
side effects. The State's compelling interest in punishing 
criminals, especially in capital cases, outweighed Singleton's 
interest and preference. The Supreme Court of the United 
States denied review; that denial is not a ruling by that Court 
on the merits of the case. 
If we have a death penalty this result makes sense. If Singleton were not a capital offender, no one could reason­ably deny the State's right to medicate him involuntarily if necessary to prevent danger to himself and others. Apart from the fact that it would lead to his execution, Singleton himself preferred to be medicated and non-psychotic. He vol­untarily took the drugs until his execution date was set. It would reduce the death penalty system to futility if he were able to avoid that penalty by not taking his medicine. Singleton argues that his execution should be stayed until he no longer needs medication to make him competent for exe­cution. In the meantime, he would voluntarily take the drugs. 
This case illustrates how the death penalty, with its delay, complications and expense, has distorted the justice system. That penalty should be reconsidered. As the Church has always taught, the State, which derives its authority from God, has authority to impose that penalty. But, as John Paul II teaches, the death penalty has outlived its usefulness apart from special cases. It should no longer be used for retribu­tion or deterrence of other potential criminals. As the Catechism states, it may not used unless it is "the only possi­ble way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor-i.e., defending them from that criminal. This restriction arises from the importance of the conversion of the criminal. His opportunity for conversion may not be cut off unless absolutely necessary to prevent him from com­mitting more murders. Such cases, at least in advanced penal systems, are "very rare, if not practically non-exis­tent." An inmate under a life sentence who kills another inmate or guard might qualify. Or a system lacking means of secure confinement might use that penalty. And perhaps this teaching, which is offered in the context of-"preventing crime," might not apply to trials in military tribunals for vio­lations of the "laws of war" rather than of domestic criminal laws. 
In his teachings on the dignity of the person and the sacredness of human life, John Paul II reminds a post­Christian world of basic truths. No one, including the State, over has a right intentionally to kill the innocent. Even where the State has the right to kill intentionally in the just war and capital punishment, the use of that right in both cases is severely restricted. 
The forced medication of Singleton to make him lucid enough to kill should give us pause. Why do we have to exe­cute a person like that? The Singleton result fits a culture which in many ways endorses the intentional infliction of death as an optional problem solving technique. Singleton was sentenced to death only a year after Karol Wojtyla became Pope. Singleton's game is almost over. But the bizarre result in his case should prompt us to question the use of the death penalty and to reflect on the alternative offered by John Paul II.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
An education by leadership 
As a Program of Liberal Studies major, I found Joe Trombello's Nov. 2 article about the issues of utility and academic engagement here at Notre Dame to be very thought-pro­voking. I think that that the overwhelming majority of students here do not see the rele­vance of their studies -in order to "get some­thing" out of these four years they secure a career. This disconnection between school and life manifests itself in the ridiculous amount of business majors we have here (32 percent of undergraduates compared with 7 percent of undergrads in business at the top-20 universi­ties), and the rampant political apathy on campus, because politics is all about under­standing relevant issues. I know my major has not prepared me for any particular career. and I am fine with that. Did you waste four years and a lot of money? That is the question. What do you value -understanding or utility, books or Benjamins, arts and letters or business? 
Somehow associate dean of the Mendoza College, William Nichols hit it right on the head in Monday's Observer when he said, "Notre Dame students are bright, and bright students are curious about life issues." True, most of the students I know here are interest­ed in the world and in life issues: Limits, chemical reactions, social patterns and most especially gender studies. Unfortunately, I would say that most of the investigation there­of is done with alcohol in hand. 
Ultimately, I do not think the fact that our student body is not "academically engaged" can be pinned entirely on the students. The faculty and administration need to do a better job of enticing us to learn, encouraging us to understand, of leading us to a point where, at least we realize how much we do not know. a Ia Socrates. Then our foot will be in the aca­demic door, so to speak. 
Maybe leadership by example would help­if the administration would treat us as intelli­gent young adults and not as subjects, we would come to understand our own intelli­gence and constituency differently. If the pre­vailing attitude among the administrators of this University were less functional and more academic, the priorities of the student body might change as well. It seems to me that the administration needs to focus their attention on the development of other things than land. 
Nevertheless, we as students are not excused by the shortcomings of the administration. Our separate journeys of awakening as individuals have led us all to this Catholic university to question our lives, our cultures, our gods, and ultimately ourselves, and that is a task from which we will never be relieved. This is the essence of the liberal arts education we are here to receive, even in Mendoza, and just like duLac on spring break, all the rules apply all the time. 
Patrick Crotty senior Dillon Hall Nov. 4 


Support ND team unconditionally 
I never thought I would see the day that a Notre Dame student would criticize his peers for having too much school spirit. However, Quinn Eide's Nov. 3 letter has proven me wrong. In his letter, Eide criticized the student body for cheer ing extra loudly when the football team raised their helmets after an ugly loss to Florida State. He seems to think that our sup­port of the team in some way defiled Notre Dame's tradition of winning, which he pro­claims to be "one of Notre Dame's greatest football traditions." What I don't think he understands, though, is that while winning is a Notre Dame tradition, it is certainly nowhe.re near to being the most important. 
Whatever hap­pened to sportsman­ship, pride and cheering for the Irish even when the "the team is down and the breaks are beating the boys?" What makes our University so amazing is that we are not one­dimensional. Our school is right. They play through injury and foul weather, they sweat and bleed and struggle and light and try their hardest day after day, week after week, and even when all of that work doesn't bring them a victory, they still find it within themselves to thank their fellow students for supporting 
them. These are our classmates, our peers and our friends -the very idea that we withhold our support to "let them know that we are not sat­
isfied" is ridiculous. Their job is not to "satisfy" us. They represent our school by playing football every Saturday afternoon 
against the best teams 
in the country, and their only job as an ·athlete is to do their 
best with the light and determination of the Irish. 
Sure, Florida State fans would have left the game midway 
through the third quarter, but this is not Florida State. I for one 
came to Notre Dame to embrace the school spirit and undying support that is 
the greatest Notre Dame tra­

taught to strive for excellence in the classroom and on the athletic field, despite the obstacles that may be in our path. I do not recall reading in du Lac that coming to Notre Dame entitles one to instant success and guaran­teed victory. Rather, Notre Dame is a place where we are taught how to work toward goals with the determination of the "Fighting Irish." The achievement is in the journey -whether or not we ever reach the pinnacle of success is irrelevant. 
That being said, I find Eide's suggestion that the student body tone down the cheers for our players as ludicrous and in complete contradic­tion to everything that Notre Dame stands for. Those players work hard every day to achieve the victories that Eide seems to think are his In conclusion, I would like to address 
the question which Eide posed to the student body at the beginning of his article: "Do we enjoy going to the games simply to cheer, do the jig, eat a hot dog and have fun?" The answer is sim­ple: Yes. We go to cheer, to see the band and to see the gold helmets shine in the autumn sun. We go to watch a good game of football played by the most storied team in the history of the college game. But in the end, if a good game is not to be seen, we have fun anyway, because in the end, that is what it is all about.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Sevendust seasons music scene with new album

'· 
By MATTHEW SHORTS Scene Music Critic 
Fresh off their first acoustic-based tour, Sevendust has released its fourth and most powerful album, Seasons. Lajon Witherspoon's powerful vocals and Clint Lowry's insatiable taste for hard and 
· heavy guitar riffs add to a powerful and profound album. After the last two albums, Home and Animosity, were recorded in Massachusetts and Florida, Sevendust returned home to where it all started: Atlanta, Georgia. Here, they hooked up with producer/singer Butch Walker. Originally out of his father's garage, Walker helped them cut their demos for their first record deal. Now they meet again at Ruby Red Studios in Atlanta. 
By RYAN RAFFERTY Scene Music Critic 
What is it with sophomore albums? Musicians that create a stunning and groundbreaking debut album are seemingly never able to recreate the magic again on their sophomore release. They give the impression that they have just exhausted their cre­ative juices. Every once in a while, however, a band comes along with a spectacular debut album and has just enough juice to create an adequate sophomore album. 
The Shins are not one of these bands. They are the even rarer breed of musicians that has creative juice coming out of their ears. James '\1ercer, The Shins' lead singer, and company use this juice to craft an album of astonishing stature that blows their debut album out of the water. 
Seasons, while not a breakthrough con­cept for Sevendust, delves back into the new sound created in Animosity, released two years earlier. Lajon Witherspoon, Sevendust's front man, proves that, in addition to being a great lyrical artist, he has vocals to lend to the heavy music behind him. A great deal of maturity in musical writing and lyrical content com­bine for one of their best albums since the band's creation. Sevendust's reputation for a high energy and powerful live perform­ance come screaming out in this album. 
Opening up with "Disease," Sevendust seems to have taken a step back from its normally hard and heavy opener. This song has the weakest lyrics in the album, which form a rather weak opening for a lyrically powerful CD. Sevendust's first sin­gle, "Enemy" follows and opens up the 
flood-gates for an arsenal of powerful songs. "Enemy" is a way for drum­mer Morgan Rose to vent his frustrations and differences with Dez Fafara, Ex­Coal Chamber and current DevilDriver front man. 
The title track is "a song about desperation and desperate year?" 
"Broken Down" and "Separate" reveal the more melodic and lyrically powerful band that has developed over the past few years, but leaves one with the feeling that Rose was not considerably challenged while sitting behind the drums. "Honesty" is also musically weaker, like the two pre­viously mentioned, but with more mean­ingful and heartfelt lyrics. 
Sevendust completes the full spectrum of the album with their addition of "Skeleton Song," a slow but deep song that allows you to "lose yourself in a song again." 
Following the .potent "Skeleton Song," Sevendust seems to slip a little with both "Disgrace" and "Burned Out." Both songs, although lyrically similar to the rest of the album, seem to lack the musical energy found throughout the rest of the album. 
"Suffocate" steps up the speed and ener­

ALBUM REVIEW 


The Shins release stellar sophomore album 
The Shins' debut album, Oh! Inverted World, was an instantaneous success. The album was stunning in its bare essential musicianship and Beach Boys-esque lyrics. Oh! Inverted World was certainly a catchy, sunny, bright pop album, but there was something missing. Although it was a fantastic album, it lacked variety. and it seemed Mercer was holding back some of his musical abilities. The Shins' sophomore release, Chutes Too Narrow, is the answer to that album. 
While Oh! Inverted World may have lacked variety, Chutes Too Narrow radiates variety. The instruments pre­viously weren't allowed to exist on their own; now the reverb has been turned off and every guitar riff and keyboard melody exists in its own cor­ner of your speaker. Mercer's voice soars over every song, layering equal­ly emotional verses with fun, catchy choruses. Every song on Chutes Too Narrow exists by itself, with a distinct melody and feeling that 
times," gui­tarist Clint Lowery said. The powerful lyrics sung by Witherspoon leave one with a deep consid­eration on how this song can be applied to anyone's life: "The seasons are way too cold, will we last another gy lost in the previous two songs and brings the album back to life. creating a perfect opening for the lyrically dominant song "Gone," where chills are sent with the line: "When I'm gone, don't fill the space that still belongs to me." 

A perfect closure to the album is the classic sounding "Face to Face." Here, Sevendust returns to their hard and heavy style that leaves listeners desiring more in albums to come. 
With impeccable vocals, spine-tingling guitar riffs, bone-shaking bass lines and drumming that leaves you dizzy, Sevendust proves that they can overcome the changes in Seasons to bring about one of the most powerful rock albums this year.

and it shows in every aspect of the music. 
Chutes Too Narrow carries a similar lyrical theme throughout, but the songs all have a distinct musical style. The album's first single, "So Says I," sounds very similar to the songs on the Shins' debut album but with a fuller, richer sound. "Turn a Square" sounds like Revolver-era Beatles with a dash of Lemonheads and a hint of Radiohead. "Fighting in a Sack" is a fast-paced power pop tune with a har­monica thrown in at the end for good measure, which gives the song a Bob Dylan feel. "Gone For Good" features a lap slide guitar played in the style of early Uncle Tupelo. The best track on Chutes Too Narrow is the transcendent "Saint Simon," featuring a dreamy, haunting chorus played on violins and keyboards with Mercer's towering vocals filling in the gaps. 
Overall, Chutes Too Narrow is an amazing album. The songs sound eeri­ly familiar yet eccentrically original. The Shins' sophomore album builds upon the musical groundwork laid on Oh! Inverted World, creating a tower of music built with the most intricate and detail-oriented musical bricks. Mercer's vocals place the airtight roof on this soaring album. He showcases his vocal range wonderfully and sings with an entertaining, luminous pas­sion. Chutes Too Narrow is the perfect album to brighten up any cold, dreary South Bend winter day. The Shins have successfully avoided the sopho­more slump and set the bar for every sophomore album to come.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Everything Holland touches turns to gold 
By CHRIS KEPNER Scene Music Crilic

a stretch at the legendary Birdland in November 2001. 
Holland is part of that elite group of musicians fortunate enough to have the opportunity to play with and learn from the master himself. Miles Davis. He toured with Davis for two years in the late 1960s and appeared on several of Davis's records, including In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew. Alongside other Milesian disciples like John Scofield, Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock, Dave Holland today stands at the fore­front of the jazz world, helping to shape its future and train the next generation of musicians. 
The Dave Holland Quintet, as it appears on this record, formed in 1997. It consists of Chris Potter on soprano, alto and tenor saxophones, Robin Eubanks on trombone, Steve Nelson on vibraphone and marimba, drummer Billy Kilson, and Holland playing the double bass. Extended Play is, as the name implies, a live "extension" of the group's three studio albums: Points of View (2000), Prime Directive (2000) and Not For Nothin' (2001). All three albums have been highly praised for their musi­cianship and originality. 
This is an interesting ensemble with a very distinct sound. Merely the presence of vibes in the rhythm section, as opposed to the more traditional piano, organ or guitar, is enough to set this Quintet apart from most other groups. Being a fantastic composer in addition to a world-class bassist, Holland uses the con­trasting sounds of the saxo­phone and trombone in front of the magnif­icently haunting vibraphone to create beautiful harmonies and shock­ing disso­nances, sometimes

so intermittently that you can't help but wonder at his sanity while marveling at his genius. ~even of the nine songs on this record were written by Holland, with Potter and Eubanks each contribut­ing one. As a result, Extended Play is a glorification of one of the finest com­posers in modern jazz. 
The most impressive thing about the Dave Holland Quintet is the chemistry that exists between its members. All are superior musicians and improvisers, but it is their uncanny ability to improvise collectively that propels them into that special class of truly memorable collabo­rations.

When looking back at music, few bands can be seen that changed the face of music as we know it. The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and Nirvana immediately come to mind for their unique sound within their own time. However, they are revered not only because of their sound, but because they were able to influence genera­tions of musicians after their incep­tion. 
The Darkness might be the new roy­alty in rock music that changes the face of music. They clearly have a unique, almost retro, sound, but only time will tell the scope of their influ­ence. They are currently under the radar in the States but rule the United Kingdom with an iron fist. The sound of The Darkness has been called a hybrid of "a gay AC/DC and a straight Queen," but that is an oversimplifica­tion and an injustice to The Darkness. Their debut release Permission to Land is one of the most well crafted and diverse records in recent memory. 
Permission to Land, like any great album, explodes from the launching pad with a track that sets the tone for the entire album. "Black Shuck" is full of excellent riffs and a pounding beat from the bass and drums, but it is the voice of Justin Hawkins that catches the listener off guard. Hawkins' falset­to voice can only be compared to that of the late Freddie Mercury in terms of sheer power and range. "Growing on Me" ups the ante even more and showcases The Darkness's entirety as a band. The song builds itself around

catchy riffs, but it is the echoes in the chorus and the solo of the bridge that sets this song apart. The song seems to borrow from the classic work of Van Halen stylistically, but the layered 
sound is all their own. 
The true gem on the album is the first single "I Believe in a Thing Called Love." The track encompasses everything that The Darkness does well and puts it into one song. The song has elements of Justin's piercing falsetto voice as well as multiple gui­tar solos and bridges. The drum and bass beat help round out this track that will surely be a karaoke classic some day. The final song on Permission to Land is The Darkness's homage to power ballads. The track is simple in structure, but once again the layered precision of the guitars and uniqueness of Justin's voice make it a jewel. ·

warm up to the phenomenon that is cle for our intuition and imagination," Holland said. 

As the two discs contain just nine tracks, two of which are over 20 minutes long and only one of which is under 10 minutes, Extended Play is certainly an exploration. 
The distinction of five shamrocks is reserved for albums that are expected to become timeless. Extended Play has th.e potential to do so, and thus it receives four and a half. Any student of jazz should get this record and pore over it for a long while. Enthusiasts can enjoy it but may want to use discretion because, as stated earlier, the songs are long and exploratory.

ALBUM REVIEW 

Darkness debut could change the face of music 

The Darkness. Permission to Land is one of the strongest debut albums of the last 20 years which may be why The Darkness was able to make their debut via a major label. Permission to Land contains every aspect of a great album with its precision and attention to detail. 
It appears as though The· Darkness has been able to take the strongest aspeGts of rock music's glory days and mold them into their own unique sound. Permission to Land is unlike any album currently out in music today and it may take a listen or two to truly appreciate the scope of The Darkness's sound. However, once you truly hear the album, there is no doubt it will remain in your library for years to come. So instead of pumping 50 Cent or Outkast at your next party, ­why not pop in Permission to Land and shake things up.

Boos don't stop Lakers from earning 4th win 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE -Kobe Bryant wasn't the only one booed Tuesday night, when fans jeered him and former Buck Gary Payton every time they touched the ball in the Los Angeles Lakers' 113-107 victory, 
Bryant scored 31 points, Shaquille O'Neal had 23 and Payton 19 as the Lakers (4-0) stayed unbeaten by overcoming a 10-point second-half deficit. 
The Bucks, outscored 24-10 over the linal 7:07. got a career­high 36 points from Michael Hedd. 
Bryant expects jabs in every NBA arena outside the Staples Center after being charged with sexual assault in Colorado last summer. 
Payton only played 34 games in Milwaukee last season after the blockbuster trade with Seattle before bolting to Los Angeles for the chance to win a ring. 
That was enough for the Bradley Center crowd to feel spurned, and they razzed Payton and Bryant with equal vigor, especially when Payton took a pass from Bryant underneath and drained a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Lakers a 57-54 halftime lead. 
It was the 16th lead change of the second quarter, when the Bucks regrouped after trailing early by 12 points. 
The crowd soon had plenty to cheer about when the Redd scored 18 points in the third quarter and the Bu,ck.s built an 85-75 lead. But Kareem Rush's 3-pointer at the end of the third quarter pulled the Lakers to 86­83. 
The Bucks led 97-89 when Tim Thomas pulled up for a 3-pointer without running down the clock. 
Big mistake! 
He missed, and the Lakers scored two quick baskets to force a time-out. Two free throws by O'Neal with five minutes left made it 97-95. 
The Bucks pulled ahead 101­95 on Desmond Mason's two free throws, but Bryant sank a 3­pointer with 3:31 left to make it 101-98. 
After Payton's basket at the two-minute mark, Bryant hit another 3 with 90 seconds left to give the Lakers a 103-101 lead, their lirst since 64-63. 
They wouldn't trail again. 
Before the game, both Bryant and O'Neal said their well-docu­mented public spat was behind them. 
"I think it was basically a war of words and not really a war of feelings," O'Neal said. "He's got tough skin. I've got tough skin." 
Rockets 86, Nets 75 
Steve Francis found a way to make up for missing every shot in the lirst half. He simply didn't miss with the game on the line. 
Francis ignited a game-ending 14-1 run with eight straight points and an assist to lead the Houston Hockets to an 86-75 vic­tory over the New Jersey Nets. 
"I was frustrated," said Francis, who finished with 17 points, 10 rebounds and six assists after going 0-for-8 in the frrst half. 
"When you're not making shots, you're going to be upset about it," Francis added. "Coach calmed down. He told me he wouldn't play me the rest of the game if I kept acting like a fool. He told me winners forget the first half and come back in the second half." 
The coach Francis was talking about was Jeff Van Gundy. The Rockets' new head man is 3-1 since taking over a talented team and teaching it how to play defense. 
The Hockets came into the game leading the NBA in scoring defense, and they were tenacious in the fourth quarter, limiting New Jersey to 4-for-18 shooting from the field. 
"The Nets are a tough team but I figured if we could at least try to stop their fast break, you've got a better chance," said Cuttino Mobley, who led Houston with 20 points. "We played solid. We made them take jump shots. Luckily they missed a few of them and we got to fast break." 
New Jersey, which played with­out forwards Kenyon Martin and Hodney Rogers and shooting guard Lucious Harris, shot 33.8 percent for the game. 
Pacers 71, Nuggets 60 

Jermaine O'Neal had his best game of the young season, while Carmelo Anthony struggled through his worst game as a pro. 
It should come as no surprise, then, that the Indiana Pacers beat the Denver Nuggets 71-60. 
O'Neal scored 25 points and grabbed 20 rebounds, and Anthony had just 2 points on 1­for-13 shooting. 
The scary thing is, O'Neal says he can play better. 
"''m still really not shooting the ball the way I want," O'Neal said. "Rebound wise, I'm getting bet­ter. It's early. I hope I can get it going on offense." 

O'Neal dominated on both ends of the floor and almost single­handedly staved off a furious fourth-quarter rally by the Nuggets in a game that was, from a scoring standpoint, offen­sive. 
The Nuggets shot just 29 per­cent and committed 23 turnovers. The Pacers weren't much better, shooting 35 percent and committing 18 turnovers. But they withstood a 17-2 surge by Denver in the final period. 
"This game wasn't much on the beauty scale," Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. "But in terms ....... of the effort, intensity and pas­sion that went into our win, I give our team high marks." 
The 131 points are the ninth­lowest total since the NBA insti­tuted the shot clock in 1954-55. 
Earl Boykins led the Nuggets with 18 points on 7 -of-11 shoot­ing. His teammates finished 16-· " for-6 7 (24 percent) from the floor.

Miatni tnoves ahead in MAC with upset win 
Associated Press 
OXFOHD, Ohio -Cal Murray ran for a palr of touchdowns, and Miami of Ohio's swarming defense forced three fumbles Tuesday night, setting up a 33­10 victory over No. 15 Bowling Green. 
Miami (8-1, 5-0 Mid­American Conference) has won eight straight since an opening drubbing at Iowa. The Hedllawks arc on the threshold of their first national ranking since the end of the 197 4 sea­SOIL 
Playing with its highest rank-· ing in school history, Bowling Green (7-2, 4-1) never got rolling on offense and couldn't overcome a three-fumble game by quarterback Josh I larris. 
The teams were facing their mirror image -Bowling Green tops the MAC in offense and defense, and Miami is a close second in both categories. Miami's Ben Hocthlisberger made the two plays that made the dill'erence. 
!lis 49-yard completion early in the third quarter set up one touchdown, and his 1-yard sneak put Miami ahead 24-7 midway through the quarter. Hocthlisberger was 19-of-28 for 230 yards. 
The defenses controlled a wacky first half -five turnovers, a missed field by Bowling Green and an unusual problem with the clock. During a timeout with only 26 seconds showing before halftime, the officials realized it was off by a minute -an electrical surge was blamed -and restored the time. 
Harris threw a 24-yard touch­down pass to a diving Charles Sharon on the next play, cutting Miami's lead to 10-7. The clock problem caused confusion, but didn't figure in the outcome. 
Instead, it came down to which of the two prolific quar­terbacks made the most mis­takes. 
Hoethlisberger fumbled and threw an interception at the 1­yard line in the first half, then settled down. Harris fumbled three times and was limited to throwing mostly short, harm­less passes as he went 20-of-35 for 160 yards. 
Murray's 3-yard run put Miami ahead in the second quarter, and Janssen Patton fumbled the kickoff, setting up Jared Parseghian 's 27 -yard field goal for a 10-0 lead. 
Hoethlisberger's best play came on the opening drive of the second half. when his nifty handoff fake allowed Martin Nance to outrun the duped safety and catch a 49-yard pass. Mike Smith's 5-yard touchdown run on the next play made it 17-7. 
Nance had 169 yards on 10 catches, tying the school record with his fifth 1 00-yard game of the season. 
Harris' second fumble of the game led to Roethlisberger's 1­yard sneak for a 24-7 lead mid­way through the third quarter. Harris' final fumble .set up Miami's clinching score, a 2­yard run by Murray with 3:45 left.

TCU starting to worry BCS 
Associated Press 
FORT WORTH, Texas-TCU knows there's only one way to continue the debate about whether it deserves to be part of the Bowl Championship Series: keep winning. 

For the No. 13 Horned Frogs, who along with No. 1 Oklahoma are the only unde­feated teams in major college football, there is no game big­ger than Wednesday's against Louisville. It is the toughest on TCU's schedule and is being televised nationally when no other game is being played. 
"It's a great game to be spotlighted in as long as you win," TCU coach Gary Patterson said. "All of that other stuff doesn't make a dif­ference. I know if we don't beat Louisville all of these conversations don't mean much." 
TCU is No. 9 in the BCS standings, the same spot it reached in 2000 after a 7-0 start. The Horned Frogs (8-0, 5-0 Conference USA) have to climb three more spots and finish there to become the first team from a non-BCS confer­ence guaranteed a berth in one of the four BCS bowls. 
Officials from the Fiesta Bowl, one of the lucrative BCS games, will be there Wednesday. So will represen­tatives from three other bowls, all of them with C-USA ties. 
While Oklahoma has stayed undefeated by steamrolling high-quality opponents by an average of 31 points, the Frogs have done just enough to get by in several games. 


And they are playing the 98th­toughest schedule out of 117 teams. 

There are three wins by just three points, including in overtime at 1-8 Arizona, which fired coach John Mackovic the next day. They also won against one-win Vanderbilt and beat still-win­less Army, which also fired its coach. Their season finale is at SMU, which could be 0-11 by then. 
When the Frogs finally broke out offensively, scoring 62 points with a school-record 782 yards in their last game at Houston, they won by just a touchdown. TCU's defense has dropped from fourth to 31st nationally in total defense after giving up 1,077 yards and 82 points in two games. 
Now comes Louisville (7-1, 3-1), the C-USA's top offense at 35 points and 470 yards a l!ame. The Cardinals have won three straight since a double-overtime loss at South Florida, where TCU had one of its three-point games. 

"The pressure is on TCU," Cardinals coach Bobby Petrino said. "They're undefeated, and they're trying to be in the BCS picture. They've got a lot of pressure on them to win, and we don't have to worry about all of that. Our goals are still in front of us." 
Before TCU and Cincinnati shared the C-USA champi­onship last season, the Cardinals had won the previ­ous two titles. The only other team ahead of them this sea­son is Southern Mississippi (5­3, 4-0), which doesn't play Louisville but does host TCU on Nov. 20. 
TCU has won 10 straight games, one fewer than Oklahoma, and 18 of its last 19 despite injuries to quarter­back Tye Gunn and two of its top three running backs. The Frogs also have an 11-game winning streak at home. 
Gunn won't play because of a groin injury, but Brandon Hassell threw for 375 yards and four touchdowns at Houston. The Frogs also had 407 yards rushing in that game, their first 400-yard game since LaDainian Tomlinson set a Division 1-A record with 406 yards against UTEP four years ago.

NFL 
Former trainer sues Manning 
Associated Press 
BAHTOW, Fla. -A female athletic trainer's defamation lawsuit can proceed against Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning and his father, a judge ruled. 
Judge I Iarvey Kornstein said Monday there is enough evi­dence for a jury to hear the case, which stems from a 1996 encounter during which Manning dropped his pants in front of former University of Tennessee trainer Jamie Ann Naughright. 
The quarterback, without using Naughright's name, talks about the encounter in the book he wrote with his father, "Manning: A Father, His Sons and a Football Legacy." 
Manning says in the book that he pulled down his pants while the trainer was examin­ing his feet in the Volunteers' locker room. He said the train­er had a "vulgar mouth," but concedes his behavior was "inappropriate." 
"Crude, maybe, but harm­less," he wrote. 
Naughright alleges Manning placed his "naked butt" on her face. She filed the lawsuit in Polk County, Fla., in 2002, two years after the book was pub­lished, saying it disparaged her and seeking at least $15,000. 
Besides Manning and his 
father, former New Orleans Saints quarterback Archie Manning, the lawsuit also names writer John Underwood and publisher HarperCollins Inc. A trial is set for March in the lawsuit. 
The judge ruled there is enough evidence to suggest the Mannings, the writer and the publisher knew the passages in question were false and acted in reckless disregard for the truth. 
Naughright's attorney, Robert Puterbaugh, declined to comment Tuesday. The attorney representing the Manniugs and the other defen­dants did not return a call for comment.

MLB Mattingly signs on as hitting coach 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK Don 
Mattingly hopped into the fire 
with no hesitation. 

After eight seasons in George Steinbrenner's collec­tion of beloved former Yankees, the former New York captain agreed to become the team's hitting coach. 
Now, he's just a few losses away from the wrath of the Boss. 
''I'm not naive to the fact that if this ballclub is not swinging the bat after a month, I'm going to be on the hot seat. That's just the way it is here," Mattingly said Tuesday after he was given a hero's introduction at Yankee Stadium. 
Mattingly follows Chris Chambliss, Gary Dembo and Rick Down, all deposed as hit­ting czars since the Yankees last won the World Series in 2000. 
Mattingly said he was "not a savior or magician or any­thing else." However, manag­er Joe Torre made clear he didn't fight the decision to jet­tison Down after New York hit .140 with runners in scoring position during the World Series loss to Florida. 
Mattingly then was per­suaded by Steinbrenner to return full time for the first time since he retired as a player after the 1995 season. 
"He's a guy you trust," Torre said. "He's very low key. Yet he gets pretty heated

opinion." 

His successor as captain, 
Derek Jeter, attended the 
news conference along with 
former Yankees Whitey Ford, 
Graig Nettles and Mike 
Pagliarulo. 

"I really learned the Yankee 
way from watching Don 
Mattingly," said Jeter, who 
arrived in New York during 
Mattingly's final season. "I 
learned a lot from how he 
handles himself in the good 
times and more importantly, 
in the bad times." 

Mattingly had stayed close to his Indiana home since his retirement in 1995 to spend time with his family as his three children grew up. The oldest is now in New York's farm system and the other two urged h·im to return to the Yankees, as did his wife. 
"I believe it's time to go," Kim Mattingly recalled telling her husband. "Your opportu­nity may run out at some point. They may quit asking." 
Yankees president Randy Levine said Mattingly made the' "ultimate sacrifice" by accepting the job. Torre knows that Mattingly's rela­tionship with Steinbrenner could be tested. 
"lie's in there with the rest of us now. He's no longer exempt," Torre said. 
Torre talked of how the owner used to be close to Don Zimmer, who quit as bench coach after the World Series, saying he never would work 
-
for Steinbrenner again. Zimmer felt the coaches were treated as scapegoats by the owner, who put pressure on them after the 2002 playoff loss to Anaheim. 
"He and Zim were very close, so that's the sad part about this whole thing," Torre said. "So whatever the reason -whether it is a way of tweaking me, I can't tell you for sure -it's a shame that it

David Brown earns second conference rookie award 
Special to The Observer
-
Notre Dame goaltender David Brown continued his red-hot play in goal for the Irish last week and has been selected the Central Collegiate Hocke'y Association's (CCHA) rookie of the week for the week ending Nov. 2. 
Brown, who has made just four starts in his collegiate career, recorded his third consecutive shutout in the 2-0 win over the Mavericks on Friday, Oct. 31. The 5-11, 188-pound goaltender made 22 saves in the victory and ran his consecutive shutout minute streak to 186:15, a new Notre Dame school record. 
The three consecutive shutouts are also a school record as are three shutouts in one season. He is one off the all-time career shutout mark of four held by Morgan Cey and Mark Kronholm. 
The win over Nebraska-Omaha gave the Irish a four-game win­ning streak and improved them to 5-2-0 on the year and 4-2-0 in CCHA play. 
Brown has not given up a goal since the 15:38 mark of the third period on Oct. 17 versus Bowling Green. In that span, he has shutout Bowling Green, No.1 ranked Boston College and Nebraska-Omaha. 
On the season, Brown is now 3-2-0 with a 1.15 goals-against average and a .964 save percent­age. He leads the CCHA in goals­against average, save percentage and shutouts. 
Nationally, the former Hamilton Kilty Bee of the Ontario Provincial Junior Hockey League, ranks fifth in goals­against average, third in save percentage and first in shutouts. He has helped Notre Dame to a CCHA-leading 1.71 team goals­against average.

Impressive Sooners wary of Aggies and upset 
Associated Press 
For Oklahoma, now it's just a matter of avoiding a letdown. 
The top-ranked Sooners, how­ever, have extra incentive to make sure that doesn't happen in Saturday's Big 12 matchup with TexasA&M. 
Oklahoma (9-0, 5-0 Big 12), the unanimous No. 1 and the only undefeated team from a major conference, made a huge state­ment last week with its 52-9 trouncing of then-No. 14 Oklahoma State. The Cowboys had won the previous two meet­ings between the rivals. 
That game was supposed to be the last real test for the Sooners leading to the Big 12 title game on Dec. 6. Their remaining games come against Texas A&M, Baylor and Texas Tech -teams that comprise the bottom half of the Big 12 South and have a com­bined 13-14 record. 
"Around here, beating Oklahoma State isn't going to be the end-all to our season," Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said. "This game means nothing with­out these next three." 
Stoops' squad has reason to be wary of Texas A&M (2-3, 4-5) despite its poor record. The Sooners also entered last sea­son's meeting unbeaten and at No. 1, but the Aggies pulled off a stunning 30-26 victory at College Station. 
Last year, though, Texas A&M did not have to deal with Jason White. The Heisman Trophy can­didate is second nationally with a 
168.3 passer rating for a Sooner offense that leads the country with 45.1 points per game. 
With White having thrown 27 touchdown passes and only six interceptions, Oklahoma has scored 50 or more points in five 
Clarett drops federal complaint seeking fine 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio Suspended running back Maurice Clarett has dropped a federal complaint seeking a $2.5 million fine against Ohio State for releasing information from an NCAA investigation to
-prosecutors. In his court motion, Clarett reserved the right to renew the complaint if he could get back­ing from the U.S. Department of Education, which oversees the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act he accuses the school of violating. "We intend to bring it again," his attorney, Percy Squire, said Tuesday. "We want to bring it as a joint action." The complaint sought to add
-
Clarett to an Education Department lawsuit against several Ohio universities over the release of educational records. The complaint asked the court to fine Ohio State at least $2.5 million, payable to Clarett. 
Ohio State had argued that previous court rulings prevent individuals from suing schools under the privacy law. Squire said he wanted to avoid that question by having the Education Department join him in seeking the contempt ruling.

games this season to equal the school record set in 1987. 
The Aggies have surrendered an average of 37.6 points and 
428.2 yards in five Big 12 games, and their minus-9 turnover ratio is second-worst in the confer­ence. 
Oklahoma's defense is allowing a nation-low 245.3 yards per contest and has surrendered just 62 points in five conference games. 
That unit is led by ·defensive end Dan Cody Jr., the reigning Big 12 player of the week after collecting three sacks and forcing a fumble against Oklahoma State. In that win, the Sooners held the Cowboys offense, which entered the game ranked fifth nationally in scoring, to a season-low 161 yards and no touchdowns. 
"We showed a lot of pride and toughness on defense," Stoops said. "Our defense not giving up a touchdown all day, that's the finest defense I've seen them play." 
With Cody leading a ferocious pass rush. Texas A&M can't afford to fall into a big deficit. 
Though sophomore quarter­back Reggie McNeal passed for a career-high 259 yards in last week's 45-33 win over Kansas, the Aggies offense is based on Courtney Lewis and the ground game.

Injuries plague Irish starters Earl, Budinsack 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
A glance at Notre Dame's injury list shows just how many players are banged up. 
Safety Glenn Earl. who hob­bled off the field against USC and hasn't played since, isn't likely to return to the Irish this season. Secondary coach Trent Walters said Earl is back home in Lisle, Ill., recovering from knee surgery. 
"He's home now, because he had his knee operated on Friday," Walters said. "I expect him back next week helping, but he should not be here for the game on Saturday." 
Then there's defensive end Kyle Budinscak, who went down agatnst Florida State and is out this week and maybe longer, Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham said. 
Meanwhile, offensive tackle Dan Stevenson is questionable and Jim Molinaro is probable. Center Bob Morton's status will be determined as the week progresses, Willingham said. All three offensive linemen were helped off the field Saturday. 
The injuries, coupled with a wealth of inexperienced play­ers and a well-disciplined opponent in Navy, means the Irish are seeing much more individual attention in prac­tice. 
"We had more individual time than we ever had," Irish defensive coordinator Kent Baer said. "It's just a lot of reps. You have to go over it again and again." 
And the fact that the Irish are having to plug in inexperi­enced players is no excuse for their current struggles, Willingham said. 
"You have to make sure you simplify to a degree, to make sure that you give them every opportunity to see those looks and practice against those looks as many times as possi­ble so they are comfortable with what they hope they will see," the Irish head coach said. 
Setta stU! out 
On Notre Dame's second kickoff of the game against Pittsburgh, Nicholas Setta did something that prevented him from kicking or punting since. 
While he wouldn't say exact­ly what the nature of his injury is, Setta did say that it pre­vents him from going through the full range of his kicking motion. 
"It's one of those things you don't understand and try to get through," he said. "I'd just hurt the team right now if I tried to [play] right now." 
Setta estimated that he would be ready to return by the Stanford game Nov. 29 at the latest, which means he would miss the Navy and BYU games but have a bye week to help him continue to rest. The injury, he said, isn't healing as fast as it was expected to. 
"I thought last week that this week was going to be the week," Setta said. "You just have to shut your mouth and not try to cry wolf too many times." 
Quarterback switch 
In the late minutes of Notre Dame's 37-0 blowout loss to Florida State Saturday, and after considering the fact that starting quarterback Brady Quinn had struggled all game long, Willingham said he con­templated putting Carlyle Holiday back under center briefly. 
But Willingham's thought stayed as thoughts and never turned into action. 
"It was the timing of the game," Willingham said. "I didn't think Vwas right." 
Holiday hasn't taken a snap 

in a game since he was replaced by Quinn before the

Purdue game. The Irish are ranked last in the nation in passing efficiency. 
No success after close calls 
As if their 39-game losing streak against the Irish wasn't enough to tip the history books against the Midshipmen, Navy hasn't had much success against Notre Dame the year after a close loss. 
Since 1976, Navy has lost to Notre Dame by a touchdown or less four times -five includ­ing last year's narrow 30-23 loss. In those years of close­but-no-cigar (1976, '84, '97 and '99). the Midshipmen lost by an average of 3.75 points. The year after a close victory, Notre Dame won by an aver­age of 29.5 points.

Despite the terrible field con­ditions, Saint Mary's was able to come away with not only another victory but also its first shutout of the season. 
The Belles had to overcome patches of water and mud to defeat Olivet College 3-0 Tuesday night. 
The win puts the Belles at 6­4-3 in the conference and 10-5­3 overall. 
"It was a swamp, but we just had to adjust," Saint Mary's sweeper Carrie Orr said. 
Saint Mary's appeared to adjust well as the Belles led early in the first half after Orr scored the first goal of the game off a penalty kick. 
Saint Mary's continued to look strong and dictate the game as the Belles came back to find their second goal of the half. The leading scorer for Saint Mary's, freshman Carolyn Logan, found her sixth goal of the· season off an assist by Sarah Budd. 
In the second half of play, the offense showed no sign of fatigue as Saint Mary's scored thP1'" final goal of the game off a ion& range kick from freshman Ashley Hinton. 
"We came to play, and we played tough," Logan said. 
But Saint Mary's could not have come away with the win without the stellar defense that has turned out to be a major highlight for the team this sea­son. 
"Our defense did not allow any goals, and Katie Taylor continues to be the most consis­tent player." Orr said. 
Saint Mary's hopes it can 
-
depend upon another strong performance from the defense when playing against its next opponent, Calvin College. 
Calvin is currently tied for first with Hope College in the MIAA standings and the game against Saint Mary's is critical. But Saint Mary's does to intend to see different results from Tuesday night's win. 
"We have had a good season and we just want to finish strong," Orr said.

Irish ready for traditional game in exhibition 
By ANDREW SOUKUP
-
Sports Writer 
No more practice jerseys. No more trapezoid lanes. No more 24-second shot clocks. No more 120-degree Barbados gyms. No more openly hostile crowds. 
It's regular old-fashioned bas­ketball in the Joyce Center for Notre Dame tonight, which, after playing three exhibition games in Barbados under international rules, opens its regular slate of exhibition games tonight against Hoop Group. 
"We're playing good ol' American rules, baby. Springfield, Massachusetts," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "We've been playing with those lines for so long, I think it's been confus­ing our big guys." 
The Irish, playing three games in four days during a fall break tour in Barbados, finished 2-1. The trip marked the emergence of the Chris Thomas-Chris Quinn backcourt, a combination Brey plans to use on an extensive basis as the year progresses. That duo will debut tonight for Irish fans, who still have to wait until Nov. 24 to see Notre Dame play its first real game of the sea­son. 
The Quinn-Thomas backcourt has been one Brey has empha­sized throughout the team's pre­season. Brey estimated that the pair has played against each other just a handful of times in practice. Instead, he's trying to help the two deveJop on-court chemistry needed to see who handles the traditional point­guard duties and who turns into the shooting guard. It also gives the Irish the ability to switch who pressures the opposition's pri­mary ball handler. 
But so far, the two have been able to work out sharing the duties well. Although Brey says Thomas is still the team's point guard, the coach doesn't spend much time dictating who runs the point when both are on the floor -it's a natural process that develops depending on each pos­session. 
"Whoever gets the ball can go," Quinn said. "Maybe I'll get it and go, and Chris will get the ball to look off some screens, or vice versa. For the most part, it's strictly natural." 
The Irish are in a particularly 


Coaches

And that's just the new teams. 
Syracuse won the national title last year, and Connecticut is ranked No. 1 this preseason. Notre Dame and Pittsburgh are both preseason top-25 teams. Oh, and all four teams made the Sweet Sixteen last March. 
"I'll tell you what, we'll ratch­et down our non-league sched­ule when the re-alignment takes effect in two years," Brey said. "We're covering non-league and league toughness all at once." 
Muffet McGraw's attitude is similar. While a loaded 14-team conference got even better, especially with the addition of DePaul. the women's basketball team coach doesn't significantly plan to adjust her scheduling. 
"Our approach has always been to play a tough schedule to prepare us for the NCAA Tournament," she said. 
The nuts and bolts of the league's re-alignment are still getting worked out, and Brey and McGraw both have very strong opinions on what they want the future Big East to look like. 
On the men's side, Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese said the league would be split into two eight-team divisions, but the Big East Tournament would still remain at 12 teams. Tranghese favored a conference schedule that was either 16 or 18 games, and the exact num­ber would depend on what worked best for the league's tel­evision contract negotiation. 
But Brey said he would-prefer a 16-game slate because it would give teams more flexibili­ty. He envisions a scenario simi­lar to how the league scheduled teams this year -one where 

Guard Chris Thomas, coach Mike Brey and the Irish represent one of seven preseason top-25 teams In the reshaped Big 
unique situation this fall. Normally, teams only have two exhibition games to prepare for a season. but Notre Dame's fall tour has already given them three games. 
With the added preparation time, Brey plans to continue tweaking lineups to find solid matchups as well as helping the players develop confidence in Notre Dame's interior players. In particular, the Irish will continue to groom sophomore Torin Francis to be the team's primary interior threat -something the Irish will need with the depar­ture of perimeter sharpshooters Matt Carroll and Dan Miller. 
"I think that if they're not con­fident in passing to me, they're not going to pass it down," Francis said. "That's why I have

schools in jumping ship, and the future of the Big East appeared to be in jeopardy. 
But in just a few months, the league regrouped, plotted its course and lured five other schools from another conference to make a monstrous 16-team league. 
The additions make the Big East arguably one of the best basketball conferences in the nation. Seven teams in the new conference are ranked in the top 25 of most preseason basketball polls. 
The potential for the eight­team football league, however, is not so bright. And it wasn't immediately clear if the addition of Louisville, Cincinnati and South Florida ­who haven't had 
expires after 2005. 

South Florida was a particu­larly surprising addition, because the school is not geo­graphically located near any of the other schools. But while the defection of Miami and VIrginia Tech stunned the collegiate world, Boston College's decision sent an already expansion­minded Big East looking to add another football school. In South Florida, Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese said he believes the conference has an up-and­coming program that can help the conference remain domi­nant. 
"[The cpnference presidents] know who we are, and they know where we've been," Tranghese said. "I still think we're one of the six best foot­ball-playing conferences in the country." 
The conference dominoes aren't likely to stop falling with the Big East's Tuesday announcement. After the Big East announced it had added the five C-USA teams, the C-USA responded by adding five more teams of its own-WAC mem­bers Rice, Southern Methodist and Tulsa and Mid-American each team would play every team in the conference at least once, and then play other teams twice to set up glamorous televi­sion matchups. Brey said he also hopes the league's divisions aren't split into Midwest and East Coast leagues. 
"I don't think anything is etched in stone right now," he added. 
McGraw, on the other hand, favors a conference schedule where all teams are in one mas­sive league and play each other once -thus turning what is now a 16-game schedule into a 15-game one. She expects the conference tournament to stay the same. 
But both coaches are excited by the addition of Midwest schools, which they say will make travel and recruiting easi­er. 
"It's great for us to get fans to travel," she st1id. 
Tranghese said ~he five teams wouldn't join tae conference until 2fl''5-06, at the latest. Only current freshmen and sopho­mores will play in the realigned Big East. But Chicago native Colin Falls is looking forward to playing regional powers Marquette and DePaul. 
"It's nice to have a local team where I live in the conference," he said. "It'll be a rivalry game." 
The departure of Miami and Virginia Tech to the ACC will only strengthen the Big East men's basketball division. While Boston College -which is also joining the ACC -was among the Big East's top teams, Miami and VIrginia Tech were perenni­al cellar-dwellers. Their absence will turn the Big East back into the basketball power­house that originally drove its creation. 
"They kind of played around with that football stuff," Brey said. "Now we're back to where we belong and back to our iden­tity."

"We still have three weeks until our first game, and it feels like we've been practicing for six weeks," Brey said. "You have to pick your spots and pace them too." 
Notes 

Brey praised the play of fresh­man guard Russell Carter, whom he said has been playing well in practice since the team returned from Barbados. It wasn't clear if classmate Russell Carter is close to cracking into the regular rota­tion. 
Junior Jordan Cornette will sit out tomorrow's exhibition with a bruised knee, Brey said.

Although league presidents took the final vote on expansion Tuesday, the Big East's expan­sion effort had been underway for several months, Tranghese said. The process involved meetings with schools targeted for expansion, evaluating the potential for a football-only member, and visits at every school to ensure acceptance of invitations, the league commis­sioner added. 
Notre Dame benefited from adding the Midwest schools because it could potentially reduce travel costs while at the same time maintaining the school's recruiting presence by playing conference games in the Midwest. 
Tranghese said the league briefly flirted with, but ultimate­ly rejected, adding a football-only playing school. And when

But Heisler said that Notre Dame's independence is not nec­essarily set in stone. 
"At some juncture, it doesn't make any sense to say [we 'II stay independent forever]," he said. "We don't know where the world is going to go. We're not going to sit here and guarantee that we're not going to be an independent." 
Pittsburgh, Syracuse and West Virginia are the top remaining football programs in the Big East after Miami, Virginia Tech and Boston College leave the conference within two years. Connecticut will replace Temple as a member after this season. Rutgers is the final team in the football conferences. 
The six existing non-football playing teams are Villanova, St. John's, Providence, Georgetown, Seton Hall and Notre Dame. 
"I never said we're the best conference in the country," Tranghese said. "What our goal is is to be viewed as one of the best. And clearly, we're there."

Big East adds five schools to conference 

By ANDREW SOUKUP Sporrs Wrirer 
Ending a seven-month process that saw three of its members leave for a rival con­ference, the Big East Conference announced Tuesday that five Conference USA schools had accepted the conference's offer to join the league in 2005-06. 
Louisville, Cincinnati and South Florida accepted invita­tions to join the Big East in all sports. DePaul and Marquette -traditional Notre Dame basketball rivals who don't have football teams -will be the fourth and fifth additions. 
Notre Dame, which some newspapers previously report­ed had entertained offers from other conferences, will remain in the new 16-team league in all sports except football, which will still remain inde­pendent, school spokesman John Heisler said. 
"It's been a complicated summer for everyone in col­lege athletics and particularly for the Big East," Notre Dame athletic director Kevin White said in a statement, "and today's announcement repre­sents a resolution and a plan to move forward for all those associated with the confer­ence." 
The conference turmoil began in June when Miami and Virginia Tech accepted the ACC's offer to leave the Big East. A few months later, Boston College joined the two

Just what is the Big East get­ting? Louisville and Cincinnati are coached by Rick Pitino and Bob Huggins, respectively -two of the most highly regarded head coaches in college basketball. Marquette made it to the Final Four in April. DePaul is a tradi­tional rival of Notre Dame.
