Provision that makes cotributions from IRAs tax-free helped University collect $2.5 million 
By MARCELA BERRIOS Associate News Editor 
Notre Dame may have to lind a new way to encourage senior alumni to donate a part of their retirement savings to the University starting next year, because the piece of legislation that currently makes these con­tributions tax-free will expire at the end of 2007. 
A provision of the 2006 Pension Protection Act allows people 70.5 years or older to direct up to $100,000 of their Individual Retirement Account (IRA) to qualifying charities and

By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
Saint Mary's alumnae from 21 majors returned to campus Tuesday to offer students advice on post-graduate employment and nducational opportunities in the first annual Alumnae Career Exposition and Career Insights Day, sponsored by the Board of Governance (BOG), the Division of Academic Affairs and the Center for Career Opportunities. 
The alumnaP. participated in major-based seminars through­out the day, discussing their careers and how current stu­dents r:an crack into and excel in thosn finlds. 
Tlw main event of the day was the Carner Exposition in the Student Center Lounge. 
About 75 students participated in the networking event, where the visiting alumnae spoke about their own career experiences. 
"The alumnae have bnnn so supportive," BOG alumnae com­missionnr Christine Darche said. "Even tlH>Se who couldn't attend Ithe career expo I wrote back saying this is a great program." 
Many of the alumnae said they wish there had been a similar program in placn during their time at thn College. 
"Wiwn I came to school here thern was only one bank that interviewed lfor post-graduate employmentl," said Katherine Waltner Harig, a 1977 graduate. "We had to do everything after college on our own."

Male feminist tackles gender issues 
By BRIAN MCKENZIE News Writer 
Anti-sexism activist Jackson Katz has told members of the New England Patriots and the U.S. Marine Corps that men need to stand up to a culture that allows the physi­cal and psychological subjection of women. On Tuesday, Katz delivered the same mes­sage to a Notre Dame audience. 
Part of the trouble with society's treat­ment of gender issues is that these matters are widely considered to be "women's issues," he said. 
So long as issues of rape, sexual harass­ment and sexism are considered women's issues, Katz said, it is easy for men to opt out of the discussion. 
"Opinion polls show that both women and men think [violence against women] is an important issue, but that it's an important women's issue," he said. 
And with 99 percent of rapes committed by males, a widespread refusal among men to engage in problem-solving debates will

Hypnotist helps vvith confidence 
Student taps minds of individuals, athletes 
By LINDSAY SENA 
News Writer 
So you want to quit smoking, conquer stage fright, improve your athletic performance and gain self-confidence? Notre Dame MBA student Dale "Doc" Dougherty might be able to help with a few sessions of hypnosis. 
A certified hypnotist, Dougherty said he became interested in the practice after seeing a stage show in 1990 and has practiced it for seven years. He has hosted numerous hypnosis workshops at Notre Dame, working with both individuals and sports teams. 
He held one such workshop. the last beginner's session of the semester, Tuesday in the Mendoza College of Business to help stu­dents improve their study habits and test-taking and memorization skills. 
Dougherty kicked off the session with a few brief meditations, ask­ing participants to visualize relax­ing settings. Contrary to stereo­types created by hypnosis stage shows, Dougherty said that your mind still has a moral code under a hypnotic trance. 
"You totally have control over yourself," he said. "You can't be made to rob a bank unless you rob banks in your everyday life." 
Hypnosis produces a temporary condition of attuned responsive­ness at the subconscious level, giving Dougherty an opportunity to present positive thought.<; and values to the hypnotized mind.

Diplomat wants female peacemakers 
Sorensen: Women have 'untapped potential' 
By THERESA CIVANTOS 
News Writer 
A former United Nations diplomat told a Notre Dame audience Tuesday that 80 per­cent of the world's refugees are women and children -and she wants women, including female refugees.,to become "architects of peace. 
Gillian Sorensen, a senior adviser to the United Nations Foundation who is known as "the diplomat's diplomat," delivered the lecture "The State of Women Internationally" in the Hesburgh Center auditorium. 
"Women are often marginal­ized, pushed to the edge," Sorensen said in an interview before the lecture. "The United Nations is at the center of so many things. We could have focused on any number of top­ics. But women's rights, women's issues, are very important." 
She said women have-been throughout history victims of war, but they possess the traits that make strong peace builders. The opportunities to act in this capacity, however, have been denied to them for centuries.

SMC students learn self-defense 
After friend's murder, founder started workshops for young ·women 
By MEG MIRSHAK NewsWrirer 
Erin Weed, founder and execu­tive direr-tor of Girls Fight Back, an organization that provides person­al safety and sell'-defense informa­tion for young women, presented her program to about 50 students in Saint Mary's Carroll Auditorium Tuesday night. 
Weed founded Girls Fight Back in 2001 after her best friend, Shannon McNamara, was mur­dered in her college apartment near Eastern Illinois University. Inspired by the way her friend fought back against her aggressor, Weed said she realized young women must learn practical meth­ods to protect themselves if neces­sary. 
"Nothing changes your sense of security more than seeing what violence does to a woman," said Weed, who witnessed the trial of McNamara's murderer. 
After working with violence-pre­vention experts and self-defense trainers, Weed began traveling the country presenting her self­defense initiatives at middle schools, high schools, major cor­porations, colleges and neighbor· hoods. 
Weed said the most shocking part of her friend's murder case was that many people in the apartment complex heard McNamara's screams as she was being attacked, but no one did anything to help her. 
"Specifically in college campus­es, we ignore sounds," Weed said. 
Girls Fight Back is Weed's most popular program, but she also teaches courses on spring break safety, campus crime and work­place safety for interns new to the lifestyle of an urban professional woman. 
Through Girls Fight Back, Weed said, she hopes to teach young women that "fighting like a girl is a very good thing." 
Weed said she tells women the best way to learn about personal safety is through empowerment, not fear or intimidation because they may be known as the "weak­er" sex. 
A Girlo; Fight Back program cov­ers reducing risk factors, paying attention to one's intuition, home security measures and tips for Internet safety. Weed put that and more information for campus safety in her book, "Girls Fight Back: The College Girl's Guide to Protecting Herself." 
And it really is a guide for a safer lifestyle, said Cassie Quaglia, president of the Residence Hall Association, which sponsored Weed's presentation. 
"Girls Fight Back gives our stu­dents practical knowledge to apply to everyday living," Quaglia said. "It is not just about the self­defense aspect." 
Quaglia said small changes help make everyday life safer, and Girls Fight Back reminds that to stu­dents to avoid tragedies like McNamara's death. 
The second half of Weed's pres­entation includes a program Weed calls "three steps to a safe and empowered life." 
The first step, "learning to trust your intuition," could have pre­vented McNamara's death, Weed said. 
She also warned women against being a sitting duck for attacks. "All of us know what it looks like to be an easy target," she said. 
The presentation ended with a short demonstration of self­defense moves that a woman could put to use if she is ever attacked. When found in a violent situation, women who have never been taught proper ways to defend themselves pause because they do not know how to react, Weed said. 
She also showed the audience how to use everyday objects, like a cell phone and a high-heeled shoe, as an "improvised weapon," if cir­cumstances allow. 
"It is my hope that you will see something in today's program that will make you want to go and take a self-defense class," she said. 
The Girls Fight Back Web site, she said, has a directory women can use to find listings of self­defense classes near them. 
Some in the audience said they would consider Weed's suggestion. 
"Weed was encouraging because you never think you will be in a situation like [McNamara's] and it was nice to know women can defend themselves," freshman Stacy Biedron said.

cern about the tax revenue lost through the Act. There are, however, in Washington who are trying to extend the IRA 
provision, Butkovich said. 
The Act's tax benefits, he said, acted as an incen­tive that encouraged older alumni to use their IRA funds to make contri­butions to Notre Dame during 2006 and 2007 ­and usually at the $100,000 level. 
"We've had a significant amount of gifts at the $100,000 level, which is the maximum contribution the Act allows," Butkovich said. 
He said most benefactors

John Butkovich assistant director planned giving 
time this gift doesn't count against the benefactor's allowable tax deductions that year," he said. 
Withdrawals from IRAs are normally report­ed as taxable income. But with the Pension Protection Act, individuals can directly transfer those funds ­free of taxes ­to a charity without having to itemize the gift to receive a tax reduction. 
Butkovich said as soon as the legislation was passed, his office sent alumni whose graduation years put them in the 70-year­old range infor­mation about 
taking advantage of the Act's IRA provision made gifts to the University before 2006, when the Act went into effect. But he said he thinks many of them were discouraged from making further contributions because the IRS tax code puts a ceiling the Pension Protection Act. 

And the University has made full use of it during the two years the provision was in effect.

Attack targets Afghan politicians 
BAGHLAN, Afghanistan-A bomb attack struck a group of lawmakers Tuesday as they were being greeted by children on a visit to a sugar factory in Afghanistan's normally peaceful north. At least 28 people were killed, including five parliament members as well as children. 
U.S.-backed President Hamid Karzai blamed the "the enemies of peace and security," a euphemism often used for the militant Taliban. But such a spectacular attack could also have been the work of al-Qaida. The Taliban denied involvement. 
Video obtained by AP Television News of the scene just before the blast shows schoolchildren, tribal elders and government officials lining the streets to greet 18 Iawmakers as they were about to enter the sugar factory in Baghlan, a town about 95 miles north of the capital, Kabul.

Shuttle commander voices concerns 
CAPE CANAVEHAL, Fla. -With the mission finally coming to a close, Discovery's command­er acknowledged Tuesday she had been "extremely concerned" about the safety of the spacewalker who went out to fix the space sta­tion's ripped solar wing. 
And the spacewalker, Scott Parazynski, said he barely managed to reach the tangled wires that had snagged the wing. If the damage had been just another foot away, "it would have been a Plan B or C or D," he told The Associated Press. "I don't know what it would have been." 
As they prepared for an early Wednesday afternoon landing, the seven astronauts recalled for the AP the dramatic highlight of their 15-day space station construction mission. 
Saturday's emergency repair of the torn wing at the international space station was an unprecedented and daring feat whipped up by flight controllers in just a few days.

Bush said the United States benefits from having an open market and a huge variety of products from across the globe. 
However, he said, "We need to do more to ensure that American families have confidence in what they find on our store shelves. They have the right to expect the food they eat, the medicines they take or the toys they buy for their children to be safe."

Norfolk Southern spokesman Rudy Husband says railroad workers would place some cars back on the tracks and move others to the side in order to clear the line. Rail traffic is being detoured from the single track on Elkhart's east side. 
Husband says one of the derailed cars on the train headed to Jackson. Michigan, con­tained gasoline, but no leaks were evident from it. 
An investigation into the derailment has start­ed, but Husband says it could take weeks to determine a cause. No injuries were reported. 
IRAQ 


2007 deadliest year in ongoing war 
Despite high casualties this year, steady decline in attacks eases some pressure on U.S. troops 
Associated Press  
BAGHDAD-The U.S.  
military announced six new  
deaths Tuesday, making  
2007 the bloodiest year for  
American troops in Iraq  
despite a recent decline in  
casualties and a sharp drop  
in roadside bombings that  
Washington links to Iran.  
With nearly two months  
left in the year, the annual  
toll is now 853 -three  
more than the previous  
worst of 850 in 2004.  
But the grim milestone  
comes as the Pentagon

the human race, men around the world seem to seize authori­ty and power and decision­making, and they sometimes use it to hurt women," she said. "It wasn't really until this centu­ry that the rights of women have been seen as equal to the rights of men." 
And though their rights may be the same, women's inherent traits differentiate them from their male counterparts in the way they both deal with con­flict, Sorensen said. 
"Women make a real differ­ence in building peace," she said. "That's not to say they ean't be as tough as men. They can, if they choose. But many women have a perspective and experience that gives them a spncial ability as peace makers and peace builders." 
She said that, although many of the world's war refugees are female, men have dominated peace-making diplomacy in the past. 
"Look at pictures in The New York Times of peace confer­ences. Why is it all men?" she said. 
"Men have been doing this for centuries. Women could do it as well, if not better. Give it to the women and see what they can do," she said with a laugh. 
But Sorensen was serious when she said women have "untapped potential as peace­makers." 
Tapping that potential, how­ever, will require drastic changes in almost all institu­tions worldwide, Sorensen said. 
"My dream is that women receive respect and education, health care -so they can safely give birth -and opportunities. That's not so different from men, I guess," she said. ''I'm wishing they had the same opportunities as men." 
Globalization, she said, posed a threat to that dream as it "has increased social and economic inequity" between poor and wealthy countries. Religious fundamentalism, as well, is detrimental to the advancement of women as diplomats as it "lit­erally tries to veil and hide women." 
Sorensen emphasized the need for strong role models for young women to combat these challenges, noting she came from "a family of strong women," which includes her mother, a journalist and activist. 
But in many countries, she said, young girls are unable to find inspiration in other women, because females are devalued from birth -sometimes to the point where baby girls may be killed because they are not con­sidered as economically or socially valuable as boys. 
"I do believe that women's brains, their intelligence, their capacity to do good work is equal to men's if they have the same education and opportuni­ties," she said. "We need to con­vey a sense that girl babies are just as precious as boy babies." 
And students could become the tools with which that change can be made, she said. 
Sorensen ehallenged her col­legiate audience, urging individ­uals to ask themselves how they can "make a contribution to the larger world." 
"llow can we look across boundaries and bring their tal­ents to where the need is very great? Bow can we make a dif­ference in the world?" she said. 
A former U.N. assistant secre­tary-general for external rela­tions, Sorensen has also tried to make a difference as a U.N. special adviser for public policy. 
She is now traveling the coun­try talking about her experi­ences with the United Nations and describing herself as "the U.N.'s national advocate."

IN BRIEF 
Coors Brewing sees 3Q drop in profit 
DENVER -Beer giant Molson Coors Brewing Co. on Tuesday reported a dip in third-quarter net income because of one-time charges that offset a 7 percent increase in sales. 
The company's Canadian and U.S. opera­tions both turned in stronger results in sales to retail outlets, while the European business was affected by rainy weather and newly enacted smoking bans. 
The Denver-based brewer showed overall improvements in brand strength, pricing and foreign currency rates, Chief Executive Officer Leo Kiely said. 
The results were released as Molson Coors is working on a joint venture of its U.S. opera­tions with Miller Brewing Co., owned by SABMiller PLC. 
Writer's strike ends fibning of1V shows 
LOS ANGELES-Production of the hit show "Desperate Housewives" and at least six sit­coms filmed before live audiences will be halt­ed as a result of the writers strike -develop­ments that raised the stakes Tuesday in the walkout targeting movie studios and TV net­works. 
Producer Alexandra Cunningham said "Desperate Housewives" will stop production on Wednesday after running out of scripts. Shows that have already been completed won't last until Christmas, she said. 
"It's unfortunate. We want to get back to work," Cunningham said. 
Sitcoms that will stop the cameras include "Back to You," starring Kelsey Grammer and Patricia I Ieaton, which will not return from a planned hiatus, said Chris Alexander, a spokesman for 20th Century Fox Television. 
Star Julia Louis-Dreyfus said production also stopped on her CBS show, "The New Adventures of Old Christine." 
In addition, "Til Death," which airs on Fox, and "Rules of Engagement," "Two and a Half Men" and "The Big Bang Theory," all on CBS, will also end filming, according to people familiar with production of the shows who were not authorized to be quoted and request­ed anonymity. 


Facebook announces targeted ads 
User profile information to be used to generate commercials with personal interests 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Facebook has begun transforming itself from an online hangout into an online business dis­trict. 
Companies can now create their own pages on Facebook for the first time, under a new program announced Tuesda~ Advertisers also will be able to show users their pitches in the guise of friends' endorsements, based on what the friends buy and do online. 
For example, if a friend has booked a vacation on Travelocity, the online travel agency will be able to display the friend's photo as part of an ad to entice the user to buy flights and hotel stays. 
The friend will have some control over whether to share that information, but the user will have fewer choices over whether to receive it. 

As Web companies look to boost advertising revenue by offering to target ads based on users' hobbies, interests and behavior, Facebook's move could change the tone of the site and revive privacy complaints it faced last year. Facebook will rely on infor­mation in users' profiles and on friends' online activity to determine what ads might gradually lowered.

Respect for Navy appreciated 
I just want to say that I am very proud of the student body for leaving out the "suck it" portion of the game chant on Saturday. I had visitors with me at the game, and I explained to them the nor­mal line but told them since this was a service academy that Notre Dame stu­dents knew better than to insult our future servicemen. I was especially happy to actually hear cheers as Navy took the field, and to see people cheer for their alma mater after the game. Thanks to everyone for remembering who will be protecting our freedom in the next few years.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
His time will come 
This is in response to Stephen Mann's Letter to the Editor ("Time for Charlie to go," Nov. 5). I realize that this season has­n't gone our way, and the coaching hasn't been perfect. It's time to fire Charlie Weis. Clearly there are candidates available for our coaching position who demonstrate far better class and coaching ability. Perhaps we can scoop up John L. Smith as a replacement? In fact, the sooner we get Charlie Weis out of town the quicker we can take Mary off the dome and replace her with a statue of Bob Davie. Firing Charlie Weis is the answer! 
No actually it's pretty simple. Find me a coach in America who could do a substan­tially better job with a team with a new offensive line, new wide receivers, new running backs, new quarterbacks and a new defensive scheme. Also graduate your players, assemble the top recruiting class in America of athletes who can actu­ally read and write and teach the students valuable life lessons. 
Something special is being built here that all Domers can be proud of. In the next three years, we'll have one national title at the least. Charlie's not going any­where, and before you criticize him again, 

Charlie Weis must stay 
remember how many blocks and tackles he's missed, how many errant passes he's thrown, how many balls he's dropped and how many penalties he's committed. 
Since I've stepped foot on this campus two years ago, it's never ceased to amaze me not only the lack of knowledge stu­dents have about sports at America's jock college, but also how quickly people turn on a team and its coaching staff. 
Above all, I clearly remember how many times our students complained about the guy who played here and wore No. 10. All I know is that he was pretty good. We'll be saying the same thing about our head coach very soon. 
The points you make demonstrate that you know absolutely nothing about col­lege football. And stop complaining about that field goal decision. I go for it on fourth down in NCAA 2008 just like every real man on this campus does. If you care not to join us on Saturday afternoon, nobody's going to miss you. Go read a book instead.

Coaches more informed than fans 
I will be the first to admit that I do not know everything about football and I am just as unhappy as the next guy about this year's football season. What I do know, though, is that I am not at practice every day. I am not privy to all the information that the coaches have. I do not know the players personally, nor do I have a good idea of what they are really capable of on the football field. It takes a lot of time and knowledge to have that kind of understanding of 80-however many guys are on a football team. Most of the time it's a paid position; they're usually called coaches. 
I am really tired of hearing people all over campus talking about the football team, how terrible we are and how Charlie Weis should be gone. Everyone is positive that he is out there making the wrong calls for our football team and not giving them a chance to win~ He is going against conventional football wis­dom. The Navy game was full of questionable decisions on Weis's part; ones that went against conven­

tiona! football wisdom. 
Conventional wisdom is just that, though; conventional, it is for when things are ordinary. Things are far from normal with this year's football team. It is an unconventional year. Conventional wisdom might have to be left behind in order to give us a chance for victory. 
That being said, we are all entitled to our opinions. but don't be so adamant about how poorly Weis is coaching and how terrible of a deci­sion maker he is. You aren't at prac­tice. You don't know what the coach­es know, and you don't know what each player is capable of under every circumstance in the game. If you ever gain access to all that infor­mation, then say all you want and be sure of it. Until then, just remember that there are more informed people out there running the football team and they are sure doing a better job than me, and probably you, too.

Gam_e experience unparalled 
After years of observing whether or not my son's obsession with all things Notre Dame would pass, his commitment was finally rewarded as the two of us made our way to South Bend this last weekend to attend our first Notre Dame football game. I just want to express how grateful we both feel to have not only been able to attend the game, but also that the experience we had with fans and staff was unparalleled. 
Never have I come in contact with so many gracious, kind and considerate people all in one location. Because the people near us had taken the time to share things with us regarding the program that was important to them, it made the little things like knees in the back and arms on the shoulders as we stood and sat much less concerning. Thank you for allowing us to share that experience with you. 
In spite of the loss, I have seldom been privy to such a class act in the stands and on the field. That experience proves to me that there are indeed many more things more important than football. It was wonderful to be a part of something greater than myself. Thanks for letting us in on it. We can't wait to come again next year. Go Irish!

A note of respect from a Navy alum 
After watching as my alma mater, the Naval Academy, lose for the 43rd consecutive time to Notre Dame last year, after watching as Brady Quinn, coach Charlie Weis and all Notre Dame players, students and fans showed genuine respect for the Navy team and students with their post-game comments and quiet, side-by-side observation of the singing of the "Navy Blue and Gold," and after reading the fine editorial by a Notre Dame student in this very publication about how Notre Dame "gets it" when it comes to the "beyond football" significance of this storied, on field rivalry: I was so moved that I had to write and thank the student, and all of Notre Dame, for their admirable, classy behavior that went way beyond sportsmanship. 
After finally witnessing something I thought I might not see in my lifetime--Navy's victory last Saturday over Notre Dame --I naturally felt the joy and relief of finally, at long last, experiencing victory over the school that is the yardstick of college football great­ness. I popped a bottle of champagne and called sever­al of my fellow Academy alums to joke that "the streak lives ... every time my family has a three-year-old boy, Navy beats Notre Dame." I was three in 1963, and my son (who, by the way, loves "Rudy") is now three. 
But after a brief celebration of something I had wait­ed 44 years to see, I quickly returned to the realization that, what had seemed really important to me only three hours earlier (a victory over Notre Dame), was no longer as significant to me as the fact that the same post-game respect and genuine class emanated from all over Notre Dame Stadium as had after any of the 43 previous victories. I was not so much surprised by this, just more or less overwhelmed that, the feeling of victory I had .awaited for so long, was dwarfed by the realization that, once the game was over and won, what really stuck was my enduring admiration and respect for all that is embodied by both the Naval 
Academy and the University of Notre Dame. 
What word describes what I witnessed from the peo­ple of Notre Dame after a week during which they had buried the brother of a player, and after a day during which they lost not only a hard-fought football game, but a fine young alum and promising marathoner? I can't think of a single word that describes that type of character, integrity and class. I guess it takes two, Notre Dame. I want to offer my condolences to the Notre Dame family, but also congratulate and thank each and every student at this great school once again. Though the team is having a down year, you will win many more football games and national championships in the very near future under your great coach, Charlie Weis, and with your trove of talented student-athletes. 
Right now, you may be hurting from your on-field and, more importantly, off-field losses, but you should all be very proud of who you are, where you are and how you are perceived by outsiders like me. You are at a truly great institution that is only that way because it reflects the values and character of the people -you, the students, coaches, faculty and alumni -who ARE the University of Notre Dame bring to it. Enjoy every moment you are there and know there are probably millions of us out here that are not your parents or family, but are also very proud of who and what you are. Thanks and best wishes.

This year's winter movie season marks the return of Julia Roberts and Disney 2-D animation, as well as the continued dominance of Judd Apatow and the yearly Oscar-worthy performance from Will Smith. There're blockbusters and indies and musicals (oh my!) and a whole lot of awards buzz.

Release date: Nov. 16 
Starring: Angelina J olie, Ray Winstone 
Old English epics aren't exactly the stuff of movie magic, right? Anglo­Saxon taglines tend not to narrate the previews we see on television. However, "Back to the Future" director Robert Zemeckis seems set on bringing the 8th century into the 21st with this month's "Beowulf." 
Animated much like Zemeckis's f1lm version of "The Polar Express," Beowulf features the voices of Angelina Julie as Grendel's mother -a far cry from the dark, watery beast in the original tale -and British actor Ray Winstone (TV's "Henry VIII") as the eponymous epic hero. 
The prognosis on "Beowulf" seems iffy at best, as an animated, near­Disneyfied version of the story is unlikely to be dark enough to capture the proper flavor, and an overly violent version will probably omit the real sub­stance of the original. Still, it will be

"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"

Starring: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Hickman 
"The Demon Barber of Fleet Street" may not seem like a hefty epithet to levy at a criminal, but this murderous moniker is more than fitting for Sweeney Todd, the main character in Tim Burton's new film version of the Stephen Sondheim musical. Starring Johnny Depp as Sweeney Todd (aka Benjamin Barker) the film tells the story of Barker, a barber wrongly impris­oned by the evil Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Upon his release, Barker learns that Turpin has schemed to seduce his now-dead wife and take his daughter, and he decides to exact revenge. Joining forces with meat pie-maker Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), Barker slowly evolves into Sweeney Todd, with deadly results. Sundheim's "Sweeney Todd" is a much­beloved play, and seeing the talented use their rarely heard singing voices should be interesting at the very least.

NEW YORK -The Knicks found a better way to fight back against the Denver Nuggets. 
Zach Randolph had 22 points and 17 rebounds, three other players scored more than 20 points, and New York erased a series of double-digit deficits to win 119-112 Tuesday night in Denver's first trip to Madison Square Garden since last year's brawl. 
Seemingly on the verge of being run off the floor in the same way they were before losing their cool 11 months ago, the Knicks instead blew by the Nuggets with a fourth-quarter rally, then held on behind huge plays from Randolph and Eddy Curry in their best outing since being paired together. 

Jamal Crawford led the Knicks with 25 points and Curry added 24, nine in the fourth quarter. Stephon Marbury had 21 and nine assists, and Renaldo Balkman led a spirited bench effort with 11 points. 
"Our whole team, I like the tenacity that we played with. I like the intensity that we played with," Knicks coach Isiah Thomas said. 
Allen Iverson scored 32 points and Carmelo Anthony had 24 for the Nuggets, who led by as many as 15 and were still ahead by 10 going 
IN BRIEF 

Titans' 'Pacman' Jones plea
for playtime rejected 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -NFL com­missioner Roger Goodell told Titans cornerback Adam "Pacman" Jones in April to sit out the 2007 season. On Tuesday, the commissioner informed Jones he still hasn't changed his mind. 
Jones had met with the commis­sioner last week in New York, plead­ing for some leniency and an early return. But the cornerback whose biggest community service was buy­ing wrestling tickets for Atlanta stu­dents to watch him at a pay-per-view event last month didn't convince Goodell. 
The commissioner told Jones his suspension will last through this sea­son, which would include the playoffs if the Titans {6-2) qualify. 
"He will be eligible to begin work­ing out at the Titans' facility follow­ing the conclusion of the team's sea­son," the league said in a statement. 
to the fourth quarter before dropping their second straight. 
Iverson briefly had to leave the floor after bloodying his lip defending Marbury with under 2 minutes left, but everything else about the game was clean -unlike Denver's last trip here. 
In that one, the Nuggets were 1:15 away from finish­ing up a 123-100 victory last Dec. 16 when Knicks reserve Mardy Collins took down J.R. Smith by the neck to stop a breakaway. Nate Robinson soon jumped in, and he and Smith tumbled into the front row while fighting. Anthony, leading the NBA in scoring at the time, dropped Collins with a punch and was sus-
Maddux wins prestigious
Gold Glove for 17th time 
Padres pitcher Greg Maddux won his record 17th Gold Glove while Boston first baseman Kevin Youkilis earned his first award Tuesday for fielding excellence. 
Detroit catcher Ivan Rodriguez won for the 13th time and outfield­ers Andruw Jones, Ichiro Suzuki and Torii Hunter added to their totals. 
The Colorado Rockies, who set a major league record for fielding per­centage, did not have a winner. 
Maddux broke a tie with Baltimore third baseman Brooks Robinson and pitcher Jim Kaat for the most Gold Gloves. 
Known for his quick reflexes on the mound even at 41, Maddux won his first Gold Glove in 1990 with the Chicago Cubs. The 347-game winner has taken home the honor every year since except for 2003, when Mike Hampton broke his streak.

pended 15 games. 
Seven players were sus­pended, each organization was fined $500,000, and the Nuggets sorely needed to find more scoring. So they stepped up their efforts to get Iverson, acquiring him from Philadelphia just after the suspensions were announced. 
There were no incidents this time, even when Smith had another breakaway late in the third quarter and Robinson was forced to foul to stop him. And though players from both teams insist everything about the brawl is in the past, the icy relationship between George Karl and Thomas hasn't gone anywhere. 

World Series of Poker 
involved in gambling ring 
KINGSPORT, Tenn. -A divisional winner of the World Series of Poker was arrested with 15 other men during a gambling raid that yielded almost $20,000, police said. 
Paul McKinney and the others were sitting around a table playing poker Friday night when the raid occurred, police said. Authorities said they seized cash, playing cards and poker chips, as well as betting slips for the weekend's sporting 
-
events. 
McKinney, 82, of Weber City, Va., won the 2005 Seniors Division of the World Series of Poker tournament in Las Vegas, taking home $202,725, series spokesman Dave Curley said. At the time he was the oldest winner in World Series of Poker history. 
Police in Kingsport, in eastern Tennessee, conducted the raid after getting a tip. All those arrested were charged with gambling.

ChronicleIef>Orls Guillen, Willia111s had steroids 
' 

Associated Press 

Power-hitting outlieldm Jose Guillen bought nnarly $20.000 worth of' steroids and human growth hormone from 2003-05. thn San Frandseo Chroniele rnportnd Tuesday. 
Forrnnr major leaguers Matt Williams and Ismael Valdez also purdmsnd pnrforrnanen-enhane­ing drugs. in 2002, from a Florida anti-aging elinie that was raided in February as part of' an investigation by the Albany, N.Y., district attorney into alleged illegal drug sales, the newspaper said. 
Major League Baseball began testing for steroids in 2003. IIGII was banned in January 2005. 
The Chronicle received details of the players' orders in records from a source the newspaper didn't identify. Those records contained shipping and pur­chase ordnrs, paymnnt informa­tion, Social Security numbers and customers' birthdates, the paper said. 

A rnport by former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell into thn use of performancn­enhaneing substances in base­ball is expected bPfore the nnd of the year. An unidentified active player has agreed to spnak with Mitchell in the next fnw weeks, Sl.com rnported Tunsday. Thn Yankees' Jason Giarnbi, who was pressured by cornmissionnr Bud Selig, is the only aetiv11 player known to have spoken with Mitehell, a diroetor of' the Boston Hed Sox.

Guillen, 31. spent last season with the Seattle Mariners, bat­ting .290 with 23 homers and 99 HBis. lie split the 2003 season between Cincinnati and Oakland, and the Chronicle said business records indieate hn had some of the drugs shippnd to the Oakland Coliseum that year. lie played for the Anahnim Angels in 2004 and Washington Nationals in 2005. Attempts by The Assoeiatnd Press to reach him via cell phorw were unsuc­
cnssful Tunsday. 
Last week, the Mariners dedined their $<J million option on Guillen's contract for next season. lie has until Wednesday to deeidn if hfl wants to exereise his part of the mutual option at $5 million. If he does, the club 1:an void tho deal and pay him a $500.000 buyout. That would make (;uillen nligible to become a l'rnn agent. 
Mariners presidt~nt Chuck 

Armstrong told the AP the team 
remains interested in keeping 
Guillen. 
"We thought he was an out­
standing teammate. We were 
happy to have him. We know 
nothing about what happened in 
the past," Armstrong said. "I 
continue to admire and respect 
him greatly. 
"Before I feel anything nega­
tive about Jose, I need to see 
something tangible or real." 
Armstrong also said if Guillen 
exercises his option, the 
Mariners would need to investi­
gate the allegations. 
"I for sure would have to talk 
to Jose about this," Armstrong 
said. 
Guillen just completed his 11th season in the majors. Hecords show he ordered more than $19,000 worth of drugs-three kinds of human growth hor­mone, two types of testosterone and the steroids stanozolol and nandrolone -from the Palm Beach Hejuvenation Center between May 2002 and June 2005, the Chronicle said. 
Williams was a live-time All­
Star during his 17-year major 
league career with San 
Francisco, Cleveland and 
Arizona. IIe was playing for the 
Diamondbacks in 2002 when 
records indicate he purchased 
$11,600 worth of growth hor­
mone, steroids and other drugs, 
the Chronicle reported. 
Williams' final season in the 
majors was 2003. 
The Chronicle reported that Williams. in an interview Monday, said a doctor advised him to try growth hormone to heal a severe ankle injury he sustained during spring training in 2002. 
Williams is now a broadcaster for the Diamondbacks. 
"We obviously just learned of this," team president Derrick Hall said in a statement Tuesday. "Matt informed us that a doctor recommended its use to help heal his ankle injury. It was a substance that he was not famil­iar with at the time, and accord­ing to him, did not like its effects after sampling. lie discontinued the use of it and retired the next season. 
"Matt is a stand-up guy. who without hesitation, admitted using it and not liking it. There is no doubt in our minds that Matt would decline such a rec­ommendation today, knowing what we all know about enhanc­ing substances."

GMs reconunend replay use on boundary calls 
Associated Press 
ORLANDO, Fla. -Baseball could soon have a new position: replay judge. 
General managers recom­mended for the first time Tuesday that instant replay be used to help umpires on bound­ary calls -whether potential home runs are fair or foul, whether balls go over fences or hit the tops and bounce back, and whether fans interfere with possible homers. 
The proposal was approved by a 25-5 vote. There was no spe­cific time frame on when such a system might be put in place. 
"We've taken the first step. The question will be now, what do we do?" said Jimmie Lee Solomon, executive vice presi­dent for baseball operations in the commissioner's office. "We have glacier-like movement in baseball, so I'm hopeful that we can at least start meaningful discussions about it. I think that this will be something we'll have to go very deliberately on." 
Solomon said the next step will be to speak with commis­sioner Bud Selig, who opposes the use of replays but said last month he was willing to let GMs examine the issue. If Selig gives the go-ahead, Solomon and the staff in the commissioner's office would draft a detailed replay proposal that GMs could vote on when they gather next month at the winter meetings in Nashville, Tenn. 
"All anybody is interested in is getting it right," Chicago White Sox GM Ken Williams said. "It will be a lot easier and less time to get that right than some of these arguments that ensue when a call is disputed." 
Replay eventually would have to be approved by the unions for players and umpires, and possi­bly in a vote by owners. 
"It's very important that we do get Bud's agreement on this," Solomon said. "He seemed to be softer, at least, on the consider­ation of the subject lately. I would not consider him an advocate of instant replay. He will have to be convinced." 
Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, said it would be an "aggressive time frame" to have replay in place next year. 
"There's a lot that's going to have to be studied with regard to the technology, with regard to when you would use it, with regard to how it could get implemented," he said. "I don't think it's likely, frankly, that all of that could be accomplished over the course of the next sev­eral months." 
He suggested that it could be tested during spring training or next year's Arizona Fall League. He also didn't see a wider use of replay than what GMs recom­mended. 

NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Vols' Parker leads All-America team 
Associated Press 

Candace Parker helped Tennessee win a national title and the United States qualify for the Olympics. Now there's one more honor to add to this run the last few months: a unanimous choice for the preseason All-America team by The Associated Press. 
The Tennessee junior was joined on the squad Tuesday by Oklahoma's Courtney Paris, Stanford's Candice Wiggins, LSU's Sylvia Fowles and Maryland's Crystal Langhorne. 
Hall of Fame coach Pat Summitt of Tennessee already knew Parker could score. It's the other aspects of Parker's game that impress her. 
"If there is one thing to sepa­rate her out, it's her commitment to defending," Summitt said. "Her intensity on the defensive end is so much better. She's also much better attacking the basket." 
Parker sparked the Lady Vols to their seventh national title last April and the national team to a spot in the Beijing Games. She was the top scorer on the U.S. team that won the FIBA Americas tournament in September. 
Parker was on every ballot of the 50-member national media panel. The only other previous unanimous selections ·were Chamique Holdsclaw, Diana Taurasi, Alana Beard and Seimone Augustus. 
"That's a special group," Parker said. "I wouldn't be who I was without my teammates or coach­es support." 
Paris came close to a unani­mous selection, getting 48 votes. Wiggins drew 43, Fowles 41 and Langhorne 28. Paris and Parker were All-Americans last season. Langhorne, Wiggins and Fowles earned second-team honors. 
Summitt saw Parker, Paris, Wiggins and Fowles play with the 
U.S. national team this fall. 
"I thought just watching them play, they are impact players on their respective teams," she said. "They did some amazing things for the U.S. team." 
The four have known each other for years, playing on vari­ous U.S. teams. Their friendship was evident in a discussion with the AP at the national team train­ing camp. 
"We've been friends for a long time," Wiggins said. 'Tve know Courtney since freshman year in high school and I've know Candace forever and Syl, too." 

When they aren't facing each other on the court, the four always check out how the othr,rs ­are doing. 
'Tm a fan of our game," Paris said. "It's hard not to follow everyone's career. The media does such a good job. It's easy to pop on the TV, or open up the newspaper and follow them." 
The 6-foot-4 Paris was third in the nation in scoring at 23.5 points and second in rebounding with 15.9 last season en route to becoming AP Player of the Year.

Schilling agrees to one-year deal with Red Sox 
Associated l'rcss 
BOSTON -The Hed Sox might lighten the load on their starters, espeeially if Curt Schilling can keep his weight down. 
Team ollieials have discussed using a six-man rotation next s1mson rather than the live-man norm as Boston tries to defend its World Series championship. 
Schilling agreed to an $H mil­lion contraet Tuesday with $3 million in potential performance bonuses. lin also can make an additional $2 million by meeting weight dausns -$:B:{,333 for each time lw passes one of six random monthly weigh-ins. llis salary in 2007 was $13 million. but he sp1ml SIWPn weeks on tlw disabled list with tendinitis in his right shoulder.

"lie didn't have a great of'l'snason a ynar ago. I think that all'nctPd him in spring training and lnd to him going on the 1>1.." 
If' llw starters stay healthy, a six-man rotation would be liknly. 
"We've diseussl'd that eon­eept," l~pstPin said. "I think it's premature to eommit to any usagn pattern. But, certainly, we're in a little bit of' a unique situation whorl' a number of our starters might benefit from something like that."

But it would be tough to usll aen .Josh Bnekntt just once evnry six ganws. 
"There's so much attrition in baseball.

"I'm sure that topic will eonw up a lot in our internal discussions between now and spring train­ing."

During spring training this year, Schilling said hn would have ac:cepted $1 :{ million for 200S. Tlw Hnd Sox pn~ferred to wait, and Epstein callnd tho postseason negotiations "a smooth process."

Both sides seemed happy with the deal in a lean free-agent market for pitchers. Schilling also would get $1 million next year if he receives at least one vote in Cy Young Award ballot­ing. 
"I'm excited," Schilling said. ''I've played 21 years. We got everything we wanted to sign. I've made over $100 million playing baseball. We're happy." 
Ih1 said he had spoken with Houston and Philadelphia and could have gotten more money elsewhere. Free agents aren't allowed to talk rnon1~y with all teams until Nov. 1:{. 
"It's not too common in this day and age that som1mnc who ean get a lot morn guaranteed money was willing to take the risk associated with perform­ance bonuses and with other bonuses," Epstein said. "So he did a rare thing and we're proud of him." 
Schilling said he and Epstein talked on the first two days after the Red Sox won the World Series. 
"After initial discussions, the important thing was I was going to get the guarantee I wanted," Schilling said. "That got it going." 
In 2004, Schilling went 21-6 and helped lead the Red Sox to their l'irst World Series title since 1918. 
lie would get a $375,000 bonus for pitehing 130 innings, and an additional $375,000 for every lO-inning inerement up to 200. 
The rotation was a bargain even before Schilling took a cut in his guaranteed salary. 
Beckett, a postseason star and the only 20-game winner in the majors the last two years, is due $9.5 million next season. 
Matsuzaka will make $8 million, Wakefield $4 million and Tavarez $3.H5 million. Lester made $384,000 last season. 
The $8.5 million Boston paid Matt Clement, who missed the whole season after shoulder surgery, comes ofl' the books.

points of the season. 
"It's nice to be recognized for being able to not only do well on the field, but a big part of being at Notre Dame is being able to graduate and do well in your studies," Rellas said. 
The junior, a double major in history and finance, holds a 3.634 GPA through two years of his college career. Rellas was also named the team's scholar-athlete of the year in 2006. 
"During the season when we're traveling we have long trips and it's easier to sit down and do work then than when we have more free time in the spring," he said. 
Both players said their work in the classroom and performance on the field build off one another: The time-consuming schedule during the fall keeps them well-organized. Miller, who is pursuing his master's degree in Accounting, said that playing soccer has also 
helped him create better relationships in things like group projects and other classroom settings. He grad­uated from the Mendoza College of Business last May with a GPA of 3.409. 
"I think that at a school like Notre Dame, if you can't keep your academics in line, your athletics will suffer," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. Clark, who has previously coached at Dartmouth and Stanford, is used to playing with high academic stan­dards. 
He also pointed to the strong support network at Notre Dame as a reason for the consistently high grades of athletes. Mary Ann Spence is the team's academic advi­sor and helps the players from the moment they arrive on campus as freshmen. 
"Mary Ann helps us out quite a bit especially coming in as a freshman," Bellas said, "She is kind of like a mom for the team. Anything you need she can do for you."

Weis said he is taking into 
aecount tlw health of his quar­
tnrbaeks at this point and how 
it will afTnd their play. 
"Well, the kid is banged up. 
the other kid is not banged up, 
so you play the kid who's 
healthy," the coach said. 
"There's a difli~rence betwmm 
pulling people for how they 
play, lwalthy versus banged 
up." 
Weis said the quartnrbacks split snaps evenly in praetice Tuesday, and he will make a deeision about practice time for the rnst of the week today. 
''I'm not really sure how IWednesdayl will go," he said. "What I'll be able to do is after I get through !Tuesday! -I'll be abln to give a more defini­tive answer." 
Weis said by Wednesday night he will have decided on a starter and will give that play­er the majority of the praetice snaps the rnst of the week. 
"What we're not going to be doing is going 50/50 on the reps all week long," he said. "That's not the way it's going to work. It might bn a littlo bit dosnr to that today, but it's not going to end up that way." 
For the st~ason, Sharpley has complntP.d 55 percent of his passes for 736 yards and five touchdowns with threo inter­ceptions. Clausen, in one morn pass attempt, has competed 57 porcnnt of his passes for (> 18 yards with ono touchdown and five intnrcnptions. 
Weis said he wants to have just onn starting quarterback over the next thrne games in an attl1mpt to build momnn­tum for next season. 
"I don't think what you want to be doing here is each week say, well, 'Who's going to play the best for us against Air Force, who's going to play the best for us against Duke, who's going to play the best for us against Stanford'!"' he said. "I'm at the point right now whern I want to win this game, and simultaneously, I want to start building some upward rnomnntum."

was a turning point for the 
better." 
Waldrum said he debated with his coaches whether to give the talk, but in the end felt that he should be honest with the team about its prospects for the rest of the season. 
"From there on out, almost the whole month of October, every game we played has bnen almost a must-win game for us," Waldrum said. "Tho reason being is that we couldn't alford to lose any more games and have any shot at the NCAAs or have any o~.tside shot at hosting at

Guglielmino Center on Monday, which is usually a day ofT from practice. lie said play­ers ol'ten do various l'ootball­rrdatnd things on Monday, but that he saw more players around thn building than usual this wonk. 
"More than normal, thny're a lot more around the coach­ing stall'," he said. "They want to gnt tape to watch on their own !performancesl because we can't watch tape with them because it's a day ofT. so we leave them alone. So there wern a lot or guys that kind of wanted to just hang around yesterday, which I think that's a good thing." 
No audibles 
Weis said Sharpley didn't havn the ability to change the play at the line or scrimmage before running back Travis Thomas was stuffed trying to get the two-point conversion at the end of the Navy game. 
"On a goal-line play, there's never any latitude," he said. "You never have a checkoff from this play to that play." 
Weis said even though Navy jammed the line of scrimmage with defenders, he still expect­ed Thomas to be able to power a yard-and-a-hall' into the end zone. 
"On a goal line play, you're already assuming that all those bodies are going to be thern, and the bottom line is you need to push the pile more than they push the pile," Weis said. "We're talking on just that last play, on every goal­line play with the exception of that one, the pile was pushed pretty well. But on that play you'll notice as you watch it the line of scrimmage came !backward! instead of going !forward 1." 
Kuntz recovering 
Weis said junior nose tackle Pat Kuntz is recovering more quickly than was expected from the injury he suffered Saturday, and he may play against Air Force. 
"He's considerably better than we thought he was going to be," Weis said. "lie's going to practice some today, and then we'll just kind ol' see how it goes."

win." 
The team focuses on itself rather than opponents, Waldrum said, and worries only about the next game. Both are characteristics he likes to see. 
"It's a funny group. You don't hear them too much talking about the opposition, you don't hear them too much talking about the pres­sures of big games," Waldrum said. "They're really a focused group of kids. They don't get too high, they don't get too low." 
The Irish have had offen­sive success, defensive stabil­ity and solid goalkeeping while steamrolling 11 oppo­nents since the Penn State game. But the opposition is hardly what they're thinking about. 
"Hight now, let's just get all of our 27 players focused on Notre Dame," Waldrum said of his team's mentality. "More importantly than any­thing, we've just kind of said, 'Hight now, it's all about us."'

against the Fighting Bees. 
The Irish emptied their bench against St. Ambrose and allowed four freshmen on the team to see extended minutes -a theme that's likely to con­tinue through the soft, early portion of Notre Dame's sched­ule. Brey said he was happy with the freshmen's first effort against St. Ambrose. 
"I said to !the freshmen]. I thought as a whole, you guys came in and were very pre­pared, you concentrated," Brey said. "And I liked your mental frame of mind. Again, it's obvious when the eight vet­erans are healthy, they've established themselves at one level, and it's a matter of what's left for the young guys." 
Of the freshmen, forward Tyrone Nash could see signifi­cant minutes once Notre Dame enters the Big East portion of its schedule. The 6-foot-8 Nash had seven points in 13 minutes against St. Ambrose. Nash's size and athleticism allows him to play inside or outside on offense and said the coaching staff is helping him become a more complete play­er. 
"In practice they have me both with the guards and in the post position," Nash said. "So, I need to work on my shooting, post moves, defense and communication. Communication is probably the most important out of everything."

Two Irish players honored by ESPN 
Rellas, Miller named to magazine's Academic All-Division squad 
By DAN MURPHY Associate Sports Ediror 

ESPN The Magazine released its Academic AII­Divison teams earlier this wnek, and two Notrn Dame players made thn cut. Fifth­year snnior Hyan Miller and junior Cory Rellas were rec­ognized for their excellence this year on the f'i1~ld and in thn elassroom. 
Both players are now on the ballot to become Notre Dame's first Academic All­American in soccer since John Stephens was named to the second team two years ago. 
"It means a lot, it means that the hard work that I've 
put in academically and ath­letieally has beef} reeog­nized." Miller said. "Its just nice, I guess. to be seen as a good student as well as a good athlete." 
In his final season with the Irish, Miller started all 1H games of the regular season at either defender or mid­fielder. lie is tied with for­ward Joseph Lapira for the team lead with six goals. 
Hnllas also started nvery game as a mainstay on tlw defensive line. lie helped anchor a defense that has reeorded nine shutouts and an average of O.H4 goals against per game. Hellas also buried a goal during a 3-0 win over regional rival Michigan on Oct. 3. The game was Notre Dame's eighth straight without a loss and marked one of the high points of tho season.

Weis says QB who is better in practice will start Saturday 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Editor 

Irish coach Charlie Weis refused Tuesday to name a starting quarterback for Saturday's game against Air Force. 
Weis said the team's practices this week will determine whether junior Evan Sharpley, who has started the last two games, or freshman Jimmy Clausen, who started the six games before that, will take the opening snap against the Faleons. 
"We haven't practiced yet !this weeki, but they're both in the running," Weis said before practice Tuesday.
