Colleges favor impeachment 
bv Paul Colgan Staff Reporter 
Seven out of ten area college newspapers con­tacted favor the impeachment of President Nixon, according to an Observer survey. 
The Observer contacted newspapers in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Illinois Thursday afternoon for the survey. . 
Editors from each indicated that student reaction to the recent Nixon controversies had been slight and that students were more concerned with campus affairs. 
All the papers that came out in favor of im­peachment did so before Nixon announced he .~oul,d release the White House tapes. Judge John Smca s surprise announcement Wednesday that the. White House claims two of the tapes do not now ex1st has only reinforced these earlier editorial positions . 
The three papers that did not take an editorial stand the Ohio State Lantern, Ball State Daily News' and the Indiana Daily Student, all said that most of their staffs favored impeachment but they preferred not to express any e<litorial ~pinion. 
Lynn Yoxtheimer, opinion page ed1tor of the 
Lantern, said the Ohio State University student assembly and undergraduate student government had passed resolutions favoring the impeachment of Nixon on Wednesday night. 
The Lantern took a random poll asking students whether they trusted the press or Nixon about the Watergate scandel. Many students trusted neither one. Most students trusted the press more than Nixon. 
"Too Incredible" The strongest faculty reaction against Nixon came form the University of Michigan Law School. The Dean of the Law School and 17 professors signed a petition that was published in the New York Times calling for Congress to initiaite im­peachment proceedings against President Nixon. The Michigan Daily said student reaction is strongly in favor of impeachment but surorisingly 
they have not been vocal about it. One im­
peachment demonstration on campus attracted BOO 
people. 
In regards to the lost tapes, the Daily replied 
"after what's come out so far, it's hard to believe." 
At Michigan State University, the State News came out strongly for impeachment and have maintained that stand. Mike Fox, managing editor, said hegenerallysupported Nixon but the lost tapes story is "too incredible." 
The State News had received 7 letters regarding Nixon's impeachment with six favoring im­peachment. 
Susan Murcko, mananging editor of the Daily Kent Stater was "curious to see how Judge Sirica would react to the two lost tapes." Murcko said an ad hoc citizen's group had set up tables on campus to collect impeachment petitions. "Something happens every day," replied Murcko when asked if the Kent State paper would maintain its editorial position favoring impeachment. 
Minimal Vocal Recognition 
A flood of requests for information on addresses and phone numbers of congressmen was the student reaction the Daily lllini received right after Cox was fired. 
"It's obvious he's opposed to an objective in­vestigation," Jim Gehring, editor of the University of Illinois paper said about Nixon's recent tape actions. "He didn't cooperate with the judicial processes so he should be impeached." 
John Schultz, news editor of the Western Michigan Western Herald attributed the slight faculty reaction at WMU to campus problems regarding the formation of a professors union. The students at the WMU campus in Kalamazoo generally favored impeachment according to Schultz but vocal reaction has been very minimal. 
The greatest variety of opinion came from college newspapers in Indiana. At the Indiana University in Bloomington debate on impeachment centered on the . con­
stitutiOnal problems. "Congress ought to in­vestigate Nixon as much as possible to find concrete evidence for impeachment," Mike Starks, opinion page editor of the Indiana Daily Student explained. "There is an indication of crimes but no hard facts and no obvious ties to the President. These need to be established before impeachment proceedings can begin." Starks admitted that the lost tapes announcement might change this. 
The Indiana Daily Student published a legal brief by a law researcher that claimed to provide suf­ficient evidence for impeachment. The paper, however, has not taken an editor ail stand on im­peachment. 
"Not Nixon's Version" The most original name for an ad hoc committee came from IU. The Students for the Constitution Not Nixon's Version had been established and is one of many groups circulating impeachment petitions. Sue Anglemire, editor of the Valpariso University Torch said the Torch's strong stand for im­peachment at the beginning of the year received little support until recently. "The students are now coming around to our viewpoint." The Ball State Daily News had not taken an editorial position but "we're working on it" Stephanie Overman, news editor explained. Gail Bales, editorial page editor, called the lack of student reaction on the Muncie campus "sur­prising." Bales attributed this to the campus orientation of most of the Ball State students. At Purdue University, "the hotbed of student rest" according to Mike Lee, news editor of the Exponent % of the senior staff members signed an editorial ~ailing for the impeachment of Nixon. This had little effect on the students Lee explained. 
"You could walk up to a student, ask him how he feels about the White House tapes and he'd say 'What tapes?" 
The Exponent letters to the editor were evenly divided on the impeachment question. One sup­ported Nixon and the other called for his im­peachment. 
300 still needed 
Ticket exchange program remains sub-par 

by AI Rutherford Staff Reporter 

Only 420 tickets have thus far been donated to the student ex­change program for the Notre Dame-Navy football game, ac­cording to senior Arthur Wesselman, program chairman for this year's exchange. At least 300 more tickets are needed. 
Ticket exchanges will still be accepted today from 9 a.m. to 4 
p.m. at the 2nd floor ACC ticket office only. SMC students will no longer be able to turn their tickets in at their dining hall. 
The response had been poor on Tuesday and Wednesday but it picked up considerably on Thur­sday," stated Wesselman. If we have the same kind of response today, we will be able to meet our goal of 700 tickets." Yesterday, 270 were turned in at Notre Dame alone. 
This is the fourth year that the ticket exchange program has been in existence. In 1970, when the ~rogram was intiated, over 700 tickets were donated for the Notre Dame­Georgia Tech game. The following year, more than 900 tickets were given up for the Notre Dame-Navy game. And last year, 760 tickets were dona ted to the children for the Notre Dame-Missouri game. 
Drivers are still needed to transport · children from an · elementary school to Stepan 
Center at 9:30 a.m. Saturday and return them from Stepan Center to their respective schools at 5 pm. "There is no limit to the amount of drivers we need right now," statedWesselman. Anyone wishing to drive in the programshouldcall Art Wesselman (8828), Mary Ann McCarthy (5731), or Dan Novak 
(7966). 
Monitors should report to Stepan Center to pick up their group at 10 
a.m. They will then accompany the children to the game and return them to Stepan after the game. 
The exchange is sponsored by the Neighborhood Study-Help Tuturing Program and was set up to allow Notre Dame and St. Mary's students to donate their football tickets to elementary school children from South Bend's disadvantaged sections. 
The majority of the children 
receiving tickets are tutored by 
Notre Dame and St. Mary's stu­
dents. Other groups represented 
are Cerebral Palsey Association, 
Sr. Marita 's Day School, The 
Council of the Retarded, Big 
Brothers of St. Joe County, Nor­
theastern Neighborhood Center, 
and Nottingham Mobile School. 
"I would hope that the student respose to this call for generosity would in some way parallel. the respose in the ·stadium last Saturday," commented Wesselman.

in Belfast 
RY FRANK JOHNSTON 

BELFAST, Northern Ireland <UPI l -A bomb explosion wrecked a pub in the center of Belfast Thursday, seriously injuring several persons. The blast occurred several hours after gunmen killed one man and wounded a second. 
A police spokesman said one man, taken "lifeless" from the wreckage of the bar was thought dead. He said at least 16 other persons were injured in the blast. 
In North Belfast, a motorist was shot and seriously wounded by gunman firing from a speeding car, police said. It was the second shooting inci­dent of the day involving a r:rotorist. 
Earlier, in the Protestant Shankhill district gunmen firing from an alley killed a Roman Catholic man driving through the area. 
A police spokesman said policemen heard two shots and rushed to the scene of the shootings where they found the \'ictim slumped over the ~leering wheel of his car. He was taken to hospital but died shortly afterwards.

White House promised to turn over to the courts did not exist. 
"Frankly, it might have made easier the problems that have developed over the last several months," said Ford at the start of Senate Rules Committee hearings on his nomination to succeed Spiro Agnew as vice president. 
Sen. James B. Allen, D-Ala., asked Ford "On the question of the missing tapes, do you feel that their nonexistence should have been made public long ago'?" 
"All I know is what I have read ,or heard in the last 24 hours," Ford said. "My immediate reaction is that it might have been much more helpful to the court if that in­f'Ormation had been made ,available at a much earlier date." Ford saitl in answering questions about Nixon's earlier refusal to turn the tapes over to Chief U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica that he had urged such action and did not defend Nixon's prior. stand 
before  the  Pr·esident decided  to  
comply with the court order.  
"My position has been  that  in  

surrendering the rapes was the political thing to do. In my opinion 
there were serious legal and constitutional questions involved as stated by the President, but if you weighed the two factors, the political impact and the legal question, it was my judgement that they should have been made available," Ford said. 
Ford also denied allegations made to the committee that the Kent State Bank of his home town in Grand Rapids, Mich., loaned him the money to buy 100 shares of stock in the bank in order to join its board of directors. 
"The allegations are a lie," For·d said. 
Ford said at the start of the historic hearings that "I am not a saint'' and he welcomed the closest scrutinv of his fitness for the nation's second highest office.

Faculty contests abortion article 

b~ Kurt llf'inz Staff Rf'portf'r 

!\lost facultv members contacted bv Tht> Ob~t>·n·f'r took issue with parts of Dr. Charles Rice's anti­abortion article which appeared in Wednesday's Ob:.f'n·f'r. 
Though most agreed that abortion was wrong, all those contacted felt that it was an issue which should be debated within the l'niversity. 
In his article, Rice called abortion an issue that is "so clear it is not properly debatable." He daimed that by allowing con­ferences that included proponents of abortion to take place on the l'niversity's premises, Notre 
Dame  was  implying  that  ad­ 
,·ocates  of  abortion  have  a  
legitimate case.  

He said that abortion was not a properly debatable issue at a Catholic University. He called for the University and the Board of Trustees to take a corporate stance against abortion. 
Disagrees with Rice 
Professor Edward Manier, who was the Director of the Conference on Government. the Family, and Abortion. which was sharply 
(THE OBS'ERVER) 
niticized by Rice, took issue with 
his article. 
"Obviously, I disagree with Prof. Rice's contention that the issue of abortion is so clear that it is not properly debatable," he said. 
"I particularly regret that the legal panel on which he par· ticipated involved such extreme. differences of opinion and so little real communication. A number of sessions of the conference which Professor Rice did not attend established the fact that such communication is both possible and \'aluable." 
Goals arl' compatable' 

!\Ianier said that the goals of the conference were compatible with the Catholic status of the l'niversity. He claimed it made a "positive contribution to the l'niversity's efforts to play a significant mediating role in public debate of contemporary issues." 
!\Ianier also took issue with Rice's use of the terms "pro-life" and "anti-life. "Manier said that "I am willing to stipulate that no fair­minded person could be anti-life." Professor Rice drastically falsifies the situation if he implies that no fair-minded person could disagree

to the problem." 
Fr. William Toohey, Director of 
Campus Ministry. called Rice's 
artie!(' inconsistent. 
':\fort' dt>bate nf't'ded' 
Toohey stressed that the issue had to be debated since the Catholic position "is more and more becoming a minority position." "You have to enter into any forum you can and discuss your beliefs, when you hold the minortiy position," he said. 
Toohey said that he was unclear as to whether it was the function of the Board of Trustees to take a t·orporate stance against abortion. "The Board of Trustees does not really represent the corporate position of the University." They aren't the voice of Notre Dame," he said. 
Toohey argued that Notre Dame's anti-abortion stance was more evident and effective in articles. talks, sermons , elass lectu1·es and discussions. He said that because of the Board of Trustees is silent on the issue does not imply that Notre Dame has not taken a stance." 
Toohey said he is urging Fr. 
Ex-Meat Squader 
Rurtchaell to reenact last vear's 
lop level committee on the 
question of abortion. This com· 
mittee was to explore what Notre 
Dame l'Ould do on the issue. 
He suggested that high-level 
symposiums. similar to on('s held 
on the civil rights issue, be held. 
Toohey also emphasized that the 
tnergy of those opposed to abortion 
should not be directed towards a 
constitutional amendment, but 
rather education. 
"People were getting abortions 
before the Supreme Court 
decision." he said. What we have 
to do is l'hange people's minds,

'Can't reruse to discuss it' 
Fr. Robert Friggin, Assistant Director of Campus Ministry, commen.ted that "even if you oppose abortion, you can't refuse to discuss the issue." 
"There are plainly people who think that abortion is the human thing to do," he said. "It dismays me that people resort to abortion, but I know that not everyone feels as I do.". ·

To the Editor: As a recent graduate of Our Lady's school, I knew well the drinking abilities of the venerable members of the now defunct "MEAT SQUAD." It is because of this fact that I found the enclosed article quite amusing, yet disturbing. It's funny that a man of 26-presumably a ex-meat squad.er, should keep up his prowess as a drinker. Yet, I feel a meat squad member worth his foam should be able to put away more than 35 beers. I was wondering if there is anyone still at ND who is of the Meat Squad spirit and might like to defend it s honor, and challenge Bill Holdforth (A gen· tleman's bet-·of course). For whatever it's worth, at least a few laughs. I'm forwarding this article for you. Hope you enjoy it.

A timeless barroom question: Can a lion beat up a 
tiger'? 
This has never been answered. 
Saturday night on Capitol Hill the question was 
whether Terrible Tom Wells could drink more beer 
that that Great Belter of Pennsylvania Avenue, 
Baseball Bill Holdforth. They would fight it out to the 
end. 
The two broad-beamed bartenders each put up a 
$1,000 check, their faith in their basic abilities and 
long training that was strong. 
Standing at the lower end ofthe long bar at Jenkins 
Hill Saloon, the the 300 block of Pennsylvania Avenue 
SE, great bulging stomachs growling and ready for 
combat, Tom and Bill toasted each other with 11­
ounce glasses and proceeded on the road to 
destruction. 
Itwas 6p.m. their eyes and words were clear; their 
emotions quick and true. 
Tom, 26, standing 5-feet-6 and weighing in at 240 
pounds, stood beer belly to beer belly with Bill, 22, 
standing 5-feet·IO and pushing 300 pounds. If those 
noble stomachs could but talk, what epic tales would 
be told. 
Insults were hurled and parried: Tom accused Bill 
of being "a rookie," of secretly drinking Kool-aid, of 
falling asleep on the job. Bill said Tom was"a light 
hitter" at the Redskins-Eagle game, a remark that 
answered with a chuggalug by Tom. "Someone asked 
me if I would be angry at Tom if he beat me," said 
Bill, a bartemter at Capitol Hill'~ Hawk'p Dove .. "But 
you·can't be angry at someop~ Y9U don'~ respect::? · ~. Tom, wearing a "Notre Dame Meat Squad"

stand on the rssue," she said. 
"The Board of Trustees could 
take a stance on a number of 
positions. but it is not neccessary." 
she said. "It is obvious who we are 
and what we stand for." 
Sr. Jones stated that public 
debate of any issue was in the 
scope of a true University. She 
said the issue was debatable and 
that debate was "absolutelv 
essential."  
Though he said that abortion was 
not entirely undebatable, Law 
School Denn Thomas Shaffer. 
agreed with Rice's article. 
"This is a crucial time and the 
llniversity must take a stance", he 
said. "Our position on abortion 
should be the same as Harvard's 
on White Supremacy." 
Cornelius Delaney, chairman of the philosophy department, also disagreed with Rice's argument that it is an undebatable issue. 
"E\'en if someone thinks a position is obviously true. clearly there is room for discussion," he said. "I take it his position is that if you enter into debate, vou compromise your belief. You ~an still hold your conviction and rationally discuss it with an op­ponent. The University is an ideal place for discussion and disagreement." 

sweatshirt, acknowledged that he canceled a match 
scheduled last week because of a bleeding ulcer and a 
bad back that put him a hospital. He also had been 
fired from his own job as a bartender at Whitby's 
down the street, presumably because the private 
drinking contest was to be held at the rival bar up 
the street. 
So Tom, even though he had lovely, red-sweatered 

Eda Boyle at his side, was not in the best shape for 
such challenge as the unseating of the Bill called 
Baseball. 
Baby-faced Bill, who looks like Humpty Dumpty 

about to fall off a wall, kept two drafts ahead of Tom. 
Tom began blowing bubbles early. At 7 p.m. the 
bartender announced the score at 9-7, favor Bill. At 8 
it was 15·13,Bill, and at 9, it was 24-22, Bill. 
The writing on the barroom floor appeared ' : 

around 8 p.m. when Tom requested glass of milk. ~ i 
Bill countered with more raucous laughter, yet ·· ·. 
another chorus of "Hail to the Redskins" and a claim 
that he was just getting thirsty. 
The beautiful young girls of Jenkins Hill hugged 

and photographed the pair, and one presented Bill 
with a coconut the size of a small watermelon. 
For the rest of the evening, Bill indelicately showed 
the coconut off as a kidney stone he had just passed. 
Bill's pudgy boxing glove hands were firm on the glass,his nose dug deep into foam and his blood-shot eyes glared over the rim at Tom's struggle to keep pace. , 
Shortly after 9, Tom called a halt to drink a galss of heavy cream and some hot water, then bolted to the men's room to answer the demands of his hyperac­tive ulcer. Bill's face was glum at 9:20 when Tom departed, not withstanding the last count 37·35, Bill's favor. 
Bill continued drinking on his own, even with no incentive, his wool Redskins cap tilted to one side, his face exploding in smiles: But there was a gloom in his otherwise happy eyes. Victory was not sweet. 
"I'm not going to take his check," Bill slurred. "He's my friend and he's sick. I don't want to beat a sick man. I didn't want to do it. He said he was okay.Imagine, me, a born gambler, turning down $1,000. Man, I gotta be drunk to do that."

Student directories expected next Vleek 
by Denise Crowley Staff Reporter 
The new student directory will be distributed sometime next week according to Student Editor Paul Marx. The delay is a result of the many improvements. 
This year's directory will be the most complete listing of off­campus students with their ad­dresses and phone numbers. The compiling of their numbers caused some of the delay.

Lack of interest plagues Senior Class Trip 

Jerry Samaniego, Senior Class President, yesterday expressed his disappointment with the lack of interest in the Senior Class Trip. 
Only about sixty students have paid the $160 price for the Miami trip while the capacity for the trip is 150, according to Samaniego. 
'It certainly is a disappointing turnout," Samaniego said. "You really can't get a better location or a better price." 
Students going on the trip will take a bus to Chicago on Thursday, November 29 and fly from Chicago to Miami, returning on Sunday, December 2. 
The $160 price includes all transportation, tickets for the Notre Dame-University of Miami football game, hotel ac­comodations for the three nights in Miami, and admission to the parties planned for each night of the weekend. 
An optional trip to Disney World will cost about $25 more, Samaniego added. 
Dr. Ertl gives lecture on new­learning-ability testing method 
by George Velcich Staff Reporter 

Dr. John P. Ertl, former Director of the department of cybernetics at the University of Ottawa, lectured on a new lear­ning-ability testing method he invented, at the Notre Dame Athletic and Convocation Center Thursday night. 
Dr. Ertl's invention, called the Neutral Efficiency Analyzer, !NEAl, uses brain wave recordings received though electrodes attached to the scalp. The brain wave differences bet­ween the left and right halves of the brain are calculated, and then correlated to discover any learning disabilities. ' 
Dr. Ertl chose to research this project after discovering severe discrepancies in performance in social situations and the current accepted forms of intelligence testing, namely I.Q. tests. While in graduate school, Dr. Ertl took an 
I.Q. test, and scored a remarkably low 77. Noting various other dif­ferences, he decided to research alternate means of testing. 
In his presentation, he cited Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Warren Burger, who in a decision, stated the inadequacy of broad testing requirements, calling to mind many persons in history who were tremendously successful, despite not taking any tests, or receiving any diplomas. Ertl said it is not in the power of science to determine thE' future of an individual through scientific test results. 
The invention consists of elec­trodes supported by a headband, a small oscilascope , a monitoring device, and a light, which ran­domly flashes, with results of

Samaniego, however; said, "Beating Southern Cal may help the trip as much as it hurts it." He explained that Notre Dame could "be entering the game undefeated and contending for a national championship." 
"Anyhow, Miami is still a very good team," Samaniego added. 
Samaniego aiso discussed the problems of organizing the Senior Trip. 
"The expensive Senior Trip is a tradition," he said. "We could get a bus trip to Northwestern or Michigan State for about $15 a piece and have enough money left for all the beer you could drink." 
"We were also considering having the trip for the Army game, but it would have cost even more to stay in New York," he explained. 
Samaniego hopes that more students will sign up for the trip before the deadline on November 7. 
··we expect to have between seventy and seventy-five students on the trip," Samaniego stated, 
brain wave responses recorded every 100 flashes. The more severe the response difference between the two halves of the brain, the more learning disability the subject will have. 
Dr. Ertl cited various ap­plications of his inventions, in­cluding: delineating learning disabilities in school children of all ages, providing a valid measure of learning ability when I.Q. tests and performance vary, and allowing high school students to perform own their tests in introductory psychology courses. 
One major problem that Dr. Ertl has encountered is the lack of a great amount of data from which to draw conclusions. However, he is at present attempting to perform NEA tests on identical twins in Houston, one of whom is thought to be learning-deficient. In these studies he will attempt to study why two people who are identical due to heredity can be different in learning potentials. 
Dr. Ertl, a native of Budapest, Hungary, migrated to England and then to Canada. He received his academic degrees at the

the physical life of this just-born infant. 

Sometimes at night, when the darkness is comfortable and the world seems at peace with itself, I think of the beauty more real than any woman's arms that has belonged to me for the nearly twenty years since my ordination. A student recently asked me about the loneliness of the ordained life which I have written of so often. I told him about the evenings when I have felt utterly alone with seven million people in the Unreal City; about the holidays shared with families in homes where I will always be the beloved stranger; and about the nights

could sleep, because he would dream the 
.memories of lost puppyhood, and wake up whimpering. I would scratch his head; he would lick my hand, and thus we would comfort each other as creatures do when each has only the other to belong to. 
I said to the student: despite loneliness, I have loved being a priest and doing the work of a priest more than I could have loved any family that heavan might have sent me. Loneliness, after all, -is not just a mood induced by half-empty bedrooms or by

"You know, the longer I stay he're the more important the residence halls seem to be. At Notre Dame just about everything eventually leads back to them." 
The remark came from a roving researcher who is studying the relationship between theology and campus ministry at several Catholic universities. It b"lcks up what many rectors and students have been saying for years, and remains true despite the increasing significance of off-campus living. 
Why are residence halls so important? Because good things are going on there and these good things can be increased and bolstered. At least this is my view as one rector, and I think it is supported not simply by casual conversations with other rectors but by other data as well, such as an in­dependent study being done by a senior in my hall. 
Furthermore, though I'm focusing on r·ectors in this article I suspect that student leaders would hold the same view. 
What "good things" are happening? No rector would claim that his or her hall was a "Christian community"--the phrase is pompous and claims far too much. But all would assert that good friendships are being formed and that frequently there is a healthy unity among various groups in the hall. Possibly this unity even extends to a sizable slice of the hall's population. 
This unity can be exhilirating. Con­structing a huge banner for the Southern Cal game became a group enterprise in one section of my hall; a large number of men in the section contributed their talents. The result was not only a very successful ban­ner, strung between Grace and Flanner, but

children. Married people can be just as lonely as bachelors; and even more so, if a husband or wife doubts the love and fidelity of the marriage partner. The loneliness that people are least capable of dealing with has nothing ro so qirh bedrooms. It is the with Him like strangers boarding on dif­ferent florrs of the same house. The aloofne$_s is as much His Fault as it is ours: we don't quite want Him; He is not perfectly ready for us; but inspired by rumors of His Nearness, we search for His presence as for a over's ghost in all the spirited-haunted rooms. In shy games of divine peekaboo, He teases us with glimpses of Himself; and afterwards, piety lights candles in hearts that are ultimately not intended for candleglow at all, but for the visits of lightning born in the heart of God. 
In my lifetime since ordination, there have been moments when I stood very close to the lightning. At such times, I have felt like some old attic room: shab­by, disarranged, · cluttered with wor­nout junk, suitable mostly as the scene where homely, domestic things can happen, as when a spider spins a web or a mouse builcls a nest in the rafters. (Middle-age is filled with times when spiders are at work with webs, and th places in the mind where the mice aeeeere sleeping.) But at the height of a summer storm, when heaven shakes earth with its thunder, it is the shabby attic room that is most brightly lighted by the falling fire, as every dim corner of neglect is visit~d by lightning. Every pegeon roosting in the eaves is startled by the sudden brightness of its familiar hideaway that has become the pathway of arrows shot whhhhith swiftness and fury from off the sun. 
Attic rooms, knowing their shab­biness, are grateful for the sudden glory of the lightning's visit. Shabby priests are also gratful for the fire-filled moments of their lives. May I also say that lightning, for all its beauty, can be as frightening to a shabby priest as it is to a nesting mouse or a roosting bird. But someday, in heavan, I shall have learned to live with lightning. 
Some of the most Ibeautiful, poignant, and God-filled moments I have known in my life were as recent as yesterday, as soon as tonight, when there was neither loneliness to 


a look at hall life 
heightened unity among members of ~he section. 
Hopefully, the friendships in the halls reach out to others who don't belong to the particular group. I'm thinking, fcir example, of freshman orientation programs which show a concern and friendship for 
 newcomers which frequently astonishes them and their parents. 
Many rectors see the opportunity to build on such "friendship communities," large or small, which already exist. What can be done to strengthen and encourage them, and help them grow? Parties are an obvious answer. With all the hub-bub over the party guidelines, rectors could easily forget that such social get-togethers can be an im­portant educational experience. On the other. hand, without planning and good will they can also become gross drinking con­tests. (It's really alarming to learn that one drinker in 10 in the nation is an alcoholic, and that this is as true on college campuses as anywhere.) 
There should be alternatives to the weekend drinking routine and some halls have been more creative 'than others in finding them. They may not admit it to their friends but some students will say privately that they aren't happy about party-hopping or bar-hopping on weekeneds. Unless they find alternatives, their weekends are lonely and depressing. 
Another way halls can be very important is by offering programs to combat the isolation that student life can bring. It's all too easy for a student to "hole up" with his or her textbooks and forget about everything outside the door. So-called "hall fellows" or "hall families" programs have been established in some halls to bring students into contact with residents ofthe South Bend area, including faculty mem­bers. Many students have found this con­nection with the "real world" very valuable as well as a reminder of their own families at home. 
Other halls are exploring "outreach" programs which take the residents to places where they are needed. One hall has adopted a nursing home,...and hall residents visit there frequently, Many rectors feel similar programs are needed to channel the enthusiasm of the students, and these need not compete with campus-wide projects such as the tutoring program. 
In some halls the emphasis is on at­tracting speakers or setting up educational programs of one kind or another. Classes already are being taught in a number of halls, for example, and this trend probably will grow in the semesters ahead. To heighten awareness of Third World con­cerns, a member of the Campus Ministry team is available to help hall leaders with possible programs. 
In the area of religious programs, many rectors also see "good things" taking place. 
. For years, several halls have promoted good liturgies with a large degree of par­ticipation by students. Penitential services also have been promoted, with varying degrees of success. Now, however, rectors see a need also for alternative forms of religious expression-e.g. retreats, prayer in any form, discussions. 
Along with these programs the rectors sense a need to share their beliefs and values with their students-taking the risk that the students might reject those stan-A day later, in the some hospital, I sat by

dards. For example, a recurring theme at the rectors' orientation in August was "the need for an unabashedly bold profression of belief in and through our lives in the halls." 
At tin1es rectors need to remind them­selves about the importance of hall living and its possibilities for growth. It's all too easy to become bogged down in ad­ministrative detail or to become overly sensitive to the seamier side of hall life-­parties which get out of control, parietals gone awry, deplorable instances of damage and destruction. <These blackmarks, in­cidentally, are the ones which some higher­ups in the Administration notice first?) But the possibilities are indeed present. 
To exploit the possibilities, however, the rectors are quick to agree that it must be a team project involving staff, student hall government, and all the residents. In fact, it is the students themselves who must exert the greatest influence or the project, no matter how laudable, will fall flat on its face. 
It's good to remember that the im­portance of hall living is not something which began the day before yesterday. It's a tradition which has grown over the years, a tradition nurtured by generations of rectors, staffs and students. And the end result is that Notre Dame's esperience has gone counter to the trend at many schools where more and more students choose to live off campus. 
As last spring's housing uproar reminded us gruesomely, it's not true at Notre Dame. Students were fighting to remain on cam­pus. So it's not surprising, I suppose, that a visiting researcher would conclude that "just about everything" eventually leads back to the residence halls. 

where are the writing irish? 
A dozen years ago or so it was fashionable to ask where the Catholic Einsteins and Oppenheimers were, the tone of the query suggesting that somehow Catholic Education had let us down. I guess it was more than a dozen years ago, certainly it was before John Kennedy's election to the presidency. In any case, it led to a lot of soul searching or, alternatively, sociological speculation. Some Protestants and others were worried that Catholics might take over the country and Catholics were asking why we hadn't or when we were going to. I remember trying to catch the mood, trying to take such questions seriously, but the best I could come up with was: Where are all the Catholic novelists? Why hasn't Notre Dame produced platoons of authors? Where, in short, are the writing Irish? The fact is, as Frank O'Malley and Dick Sullivan could tell me, there were quite a number of Notre Dame graduates who were writers-and by writers I mean writers of fiction. 3everal alumni have, for their sins, worked for Time and Newsweek. A former graduate student in philosophy went from AveMariato NCR to the ownership of Sheed and Ward. (I find it hard to imageine that someone I taught should won a publishing house as legendary to Catholics my age as S&W.) Many no doubt drifted into journalism or public­relations-writing or even deeper toward the circle of ice, i.e. book reviewing. But there are real writers among the alumni too, novelists, poets, short story writers. And if some, why not more? Would it make any sense to launch a study of those few and elev~te a program on the results, hoping to produce more writers in the future? Only a mind dulled by the social sciences ot otherwise bemused by grantsmanship would dream of it. 
I was reminded of all this recently by two things. I agreed to teach a section of English 301 (Writing Short Shrift) and find myself conferring weekly with twenty aspiring writers, many of whom seem to me to have great potential. Secondly, the editors of The Juggler asked if I would do a piece on their publication for The Observer. That, of course, is what I am doing now. The two are clearly connected. The Juggler is in great part the carrier of a campus tradition which fosters writing. Like other campus publications, but with its own special cachet, it provides the student writer with something no writing class can give him: 
ralph mcinerny 

his work in print. I guess I want to believe that there is an ambience here which en­courages students to try their hand at the craft of writing, to partake of the Irish way with words, to find the single voice God gave them to speak their grasp of creation and their gratitude for it. Writing seen as a vocation, therefore, and not as a means of promoting the collective vanity. Isn't that the meaning of the somewhat corny legend from which the Juggler derives its name? On this campus now, thanks to the writing courses and student publications, perhaps in spite of them or just independently of them, apprentice writers are seeking a style and vision with which to priase Our Lady, our Alma Mater, our geflius loci. The Blessed Virgin Mary compared to the air we breathe, as Hopkins put it. Where are the Writing Irish? Circumspice.

Fire b-urns 2,500 acres 
LOS ANGELES (UPI) -:A search was underway Thursday for a youthful arsonist who fire investigators believe set a 2,500­acre blaze which swept through brush in a seaside neighborhood and forced evacuation of hundreds of expensive homes. 
"The fire was set," Capt. David Brown of the county fire department said. "It occurred in an area where there could not have been an accident." 
A ranch worker told inves­tigators he saw a teen-ager running from the scene where the fire began in Topanga Canyon only minutes before it was discovered. Authorities said they believe they know the­youth's identity and hoped to make an arrest soon. 
Only a handful of fire fighters remained on the scene Thurs­day, keeping a watch on the few remaining hot spots. The blaze was officially contained Wednesday night, Z7 hours after it began. 
';J.'he fire, fanned by hot, dry winds, broke out Tuesday afternoon in Topanga Canyon, just inland from the Pacific Ocean. Flames shoting 50 feet

Irish icers open at Michigan Tech 
four games. captain Ric Sc~afer still centering ktlhng sttua~ons. . . ability. 
by Jobn Fineran 

Houghton, Mich. Not the kind of town you would want to spend an early-November weekend in. The cold Canadian fronts come whipping unmolested across Lake Superior, dropping their snows upon Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
Lefty Smith's Notre Dame hockey squad can think of other places it would like to spend its early-November weekend in. The weather forecast for Houghton this weekend is snow. The hockey forecast for Notre Dame this weekend is tough. 
Because tough is the word that can best describe Michigan Tech. John Macinnes' Huskies had a jump on the Irish in opening the season last weekend, and they took the best of this opportunity, downing Lake Superior State twice by 7-1 and 8-3 scores. 
Irish assistant coach Kevin Hoene, who is used to this type of weather in his hometown of Duluth, Minn., saw the opening game between Tech and Lake Superior, and said, "Michigan Tech has a very good hockey club." 
Smith agreed after Hoene brought the scouting report on the Huskies back to South Bend last Saturday. "Michigan Tech has a very physical, strong forechecking club," he said. 
"And in order to beat them,'we must adjust to their quickness." 
"Michigan Tech uses a disciplined forecheck, and it broke down very few times last week. That's good for this time of year, and that's why they are a good team." 
Some of those forwards who performed well against Lake Superior State last weekend and who hope to do the same against the Irish this weekend are Bob D'Alvise, Graham Wise, Mike Zuke, Lorne Stamler and Goerge Lyle, the latter three making up the Huskies' potent first line. 
"Lyle is big," Hoene said. "He is a sophomore-transfer, and he was impressive last weekend." 
Another forward who saw limited action last weekend, but who is ,expected to see more againstthe Irish is senior wing Tom Usitalo. 
"Their forwards are as good as any in the league," Hoene said. "If they play like they did last weekend, they will give us a lot of trouble." 
Defense, Hoene believes, is where the Huskies can be hurt. "Their defense is good," Hoene said. "But only good." 
"Jim Nahragang is a solid defenseman," he continued. "He's experienced and a take-charge player. 
"On the other hand, freshman D-.ul Jensen is inexperienced. He can be outmuscled and harassed. 
Rick Quance will be goal for the Huskies and Hoene said of him, 
"Quance  looked  good  last  
weekend.  
"He's a  big  goaltender  who  

might be susceptible to the low shot. He is very slow in reacting to rebounds and is frequently in trouble because his defense is slow to react in front of the net." 
Smith solved one of his problems-the backup to goalie Mark Kronholm-with the naming of senior Don Smith for the position, but another one has arisen--the availability of tri­captain Ian Williams for the next

Williams is awaiting official confirmation of a four-game suspension from the WCHA as a result of an incident following last year's 4-3 loss to Wisconsin in the playoff finals. The league has not yet notified Notre Dame of its decision.

The 1973-74 hockey season began last March 9 when NotreDamelost in a wild and highly-disputed game to Wisconsin 4-3. The Badgers then went to Boston, eventually becoming the National Champions. 
Without subscribing to the Vince Lombardi school of thought, "Winning isn't everything, it is the only thing", I must admit I was, we all were, crushed. We had come so close and yet remained a thousand miles away 
CLASSIFIED ADS 
from Boston and the National Championship. We tried desperately to say "You win some, you lose some," for adages make it easier for athletes to endure the beatings their bodies receive. 
We left the rink that dreary night knowing we had given 110 per cent, and when you do that, you are supposed to be able to hold your head high and walk proudly. But it was tough. At best, we could only stumble. 
You see, hockey demands a lot of time and effort. In our case all the time we had pooled collectively was two goals short of our common goal, the National Championship. We wanted as our reward a plaque, bl:'nner, or trophy, anything to signify a National Championship. 
Tbe wound of being defeated, of falling short of our goal, has healea over the summer months as do mostwoundssuffered on the athletic field. The wound may have healed, but a scar remains. This scar is bigger and uglier than one could imagine, and it remains with us as we begin this new season. 
With the same desire to win the National Championship we, the 1973-74 Notre Dame hockey team, promise you, the "Fanatics," an exciting, winning season.

"Jack is a steady player with a good fiead on his shoulders. He has good anticipation and good passing 
"We think we're ready for Michigan Tech," Smith concluded. "We.re eager to start playing." Tonight and tomorrow nights (WNDU-AM (1490) will broadcast both games: Friday at ap.m. and Saturday at 7:30 p.m.) the eagerness of the past four weeks 
becomes the reality of the next .19. And although Houghton, Mtch. might not be thebes~ p~ace to start, Notre Dame knows 1t IS one of the places. w~ich fosters national champiOnship dreams.

I , 
The sixth and seventh weeks of the current college football season have 
I probably seemed like a huge domino match to Notre Dame coach Ara Parseghian and his Fighting Irish football team. Last weekend the Irish found themselves in a position to topple the I l defending National Champion USC Trojans, and topple them they did, 23­
14. This week, though, Notre Dame is in much the same position the Trojans were in last weekend. 
I The Irish, unbeaten at 6-o, are standing up as contenders for the 1973 National Championship, and tomorrow they'll entertain Navy, an unranked team which would love the chance to knock down Notre Dame. 
But the Middies have fallen flat in other upset attempts this season, and Nhencoach George Welsh's team enters Notre Dame stadium tomorrow afternoon, they'll have to file beneath a makeshift set of goalposts in the Stadium's north end zone--an eloquent reminder that Parseghian's Irish understand the game of dominoes as well as that of football. 
Navy at Notre Dame: The Middies were riding high two weeks ago after they swamped Air Force, 42-6. But they began taking water last weekend as they lost to Pittsburgh, 22-17. There won't be any calls to "abandon ship" tomorrow--not unless it rain~--but look for the Irish to finish the job nonetheless. Corgan: ND; Fineran: ND. 
Army at Air Force: The Falcons have received rou_gh treatment recently at the hands of their Service Academy siblings. Coach Ben Martin's club will reverse that trend against the Cadets. Corgan: Air Force; Fineran: Air Force. 
Florida at ·Auburn: An intrasectional battle between Florida's Gators and Auburn's Tigers. And there's no way a Gator can outscrap a Tiger­unless the game happens to be in Florida. And this one's not. Corgan: Auburn; Fineran: Auburn. 
TCU at Baylor: 1973's edition of this SWC dogfight might differ from 1972's in one way: a smaller point spread. The result--Baylor on top--will be the same. Corgan: TCU; Fineran: Baylor. 
Colorado at Nebraska: Not this week. The Cornhuskers are too good a team, they're long overdue, and the game's being played in Lincoln. Corgan: Colorado; Nebraska: Fineran: Nebraska. 
Duke at Georgia Tech: A colorful matchup, this game between the Blue Devils and the Yellow Jackets--and a happy one for Tech's 'Jackets. Corgan: Georgia Tech; Fineran: Georgia Tech. 
Florida State at Houston: The Seminoles can score, but Houston's Cougars can score more. And tomorrow in the Astrodome they will. Corgan: Houston; Fineran: Houston. 
Georgia at Tennessee: The Vols will be busy for the rest of the 1973 season--busy trying to atone for their loss to Alabama. Georgia's J ' Bulldogs just happen to be an obstacle along the way--and a small ob­

stacle at that. Corgan: Tennessee; Fineran: Tennessee . 
Ohio State at Illinois: The Buckeye's schedule doesn't get sticky until the final three weeks fo the season. Tomorrow's game, even though it's a road venture, will keep Woody Hayes' boys entrenched in the nation's top :spot foratleastonemoreweek. Corgari: OSU; Fineran: OSU. 
Indiana at Michigan: The Wolvernines' schedules doesn't get sticky until the final three weeks of the season. Tomorrow's game, a home appearance, will keep Bo Schembechler's boys entrenched as the nation's number three team for at least one more week. Corgan: Michigan; Fineran: Michigan. 
Kansas State at Missouri: Coach Al Onofrio's Tigers stumbled and fumbled their way to a loss to Colorado last.. weekend. Rebounding against Kansas State won't be an easy task, but Mizzou will bounce back nonetheless. Corgan: Mizzou; Fineran: Mizzou. 
Minnesota at Northwestern: A matchup between the two teams who were pummelled last weekend by Michigan and Ohio State, respectively. Look for the Golden Gophers to snap back against John Pont's hapless Wildcats. Corgan: Minnesota; Fineran: Minnestora. 
South Carolina at N.C. State: the Gamecocks are over matchP.dfor the second weekend in a row. They tangled with LSU's Tigers last Satur­:iay, and tomorrow it's N.C. State's Wolfpack. USC may keep it close, as they did against LSU, but N.C, State will win. Corgan: N.C. State;

' I Purdue at Iowa: To date, there has been nothing funny about Iowa's ;;chedule--a slate which has included Michigan, Penn State, and UCLA. And a game with Prudue, while not exaclty in the "killer" category, won't provide much relief for the embattled Hawkeyes. Corgan: Pur­due; Fineran: Purdue. j Upset of the week: Kentucky over Tulane: The Witdcats have had a I penchant this year for coming up a bit short in nearly every game they've

current season, but W~lsh and his 
Midshipmen <currently 3-4) aren't 
making the 700-mile trek from 
Annapolis to South Bend just to 
serve as fall guys for Notre 
Dame's unbeaten, fifth-ranked 
team. They'll be prepared to play 
when the two teams face off on 
Saturday afternoon, and Navy's 
offensive potential. particularly, 
has Parseghian more than a bit 
leery. 
"All of us," said Ara, "the entire 
eampus, the student body, and the 
team. were caught up in the week­
long build-up for the game with 
Southern Cal, and the emotion 
surrounding that game was simply 
feverish. It would be natural, then, 
to expect some let down, but we 
just can't afford that luxury at this 
point in the season. Particularly 
this week, because we'll have our 
hands full preparing for what our 
scouts say is a dangerous Navy 
offense." 
The Middie offense is led by the 
same quartet of players who 
s~ored 23 second-half points 
against the Irish in last year's 
encounter: quarterback Al 
Glenny, tailback Cleveland 
Cooper, wide receiver Larry Van 
Loan, and flankerback Bert 
Calland. 
Glenny, a signal-caller who's 
more than capable through the air, 
has completed 67 of 132 passes this 
year for 852 yards and four touch­
downs. His favorite receivers are 
Van Loan1, who has pulled in 17 
passes for 282 yards, andCalland, 
who has snagged 11 more for 152 
yards. In last year's meeting with 
the Irish, Glenny hit Calland with a 
pair of scoring strikes and 
scampered home from the three 
for a third seven-pointer. 
But there is more to Navy's of­
fense than Glenny's right arm. 
There is also a 5-10, 180 pound 
junior tailback named Cleveland 
Cooper. 
Cooper has rushed for 627 yards in Navy's first seven outings of the '73 eampaign. He has tallied nine of the Middies' 16 touchdowns, and is averaging better than four yards a try. 
"In Cleveland Cooper, quar­terback AI Glenny, and receivers 
Larry Van Loan and Bert Calland, 
Navy has as fine a set of offensive 
tools as we have seen in any team 
since I've been at Notre Dame," 
admitted the Irish coach. 
"This is the type of team that can 
shock us early in the game if we 
aren't mentally alert." 
But it won't be easy for the 
Middies to shock the Notre Dame 
defense. The Irish were ranked 
first in the nation in team "D" 
prior to last week's run-in with 
Southern California, and the high­
powered Trojans scored just two 
touchdowns against ND's fired-up 
defenders. 
The Navy defense, on the other 
hand. will have to contend with a 
Notre Dame offense which is 
averaging 450yards per game, and 
which has scored 113 points in its 
last three outings. Three members 
of Notre Dame's offensive team-­
quarterback Tom Clements, 
running back Eric Penick, and 
guard Frank Pomarico--were 
named to Navy's All-Opponent 
team after last year's affair in 
Philadelphia, and Welsh must 
defend against that trio this year. 
He must also defend against split 
end Pete Demmerle, tight end 
Dave Casper, and running back 
Gary Diminick, who last year 
scored twice against the Middies. 
One of Diminick's tallies came on 
an 84-yard return of the game's 
opening kickoff. 
"It's quite obvious how good they 
are," observed Navy coach Welsh. 
"Again we'll be playing one of the 
five best teams in the country." 
Navy has not fared badly this 
year in other encounters with 
"top" teams. The Mids were 
beaten soundly by Penn State, but then fought Michigan to the wire Welsh has been working to before losing 14-Q. correct these mistakes all week 

They trounced Air Force 42-6 during his game preparationthree weeks ago, and last week practices, and Parsegh1an has were shaded by Pittsburgh, 22-17, been working just as hard to avoid 
after trailing at half, 16-Q. a post-USC let down. 
"We played good football in And tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., when spots during the Pitt game," said the two coaches square off for Welsh, "and it may , in fact, have the first time, they'll be putting been our best football of the year at 
more than their preventative times. But we still made mistakes, 
strategies on the line. They'll also and that's what kept us off the 
be risking their unbeaten records scoreboard in the first half." against each other. 



Captain's Corner 

Notre Dame 23, USC 14. Oh, how sweet it is. Last Saturday's victory was a tremendous accomplishment ior every member of the Notre Dame family. However, it is over, unfortunately, and another team stands ready to knock us off the top of the national charts. It is time to come down from Cloud Nine and get ready for Navy. 
This week's issue will be concerned with the offensive line, and the personality, skill, and determination it takes to play these positions. The personality of a Notre Dame offensive lineman is a mixture of in­telligence and a positive feeling towards people. These traiits combine to make these linemen well-rounded individuals. They usually have a good grasp on their lives, knowing what they want out of football and college. As for their abilities, they are usually not the best athletes on the field. However, they strive hard to perfect their skills of pulling, blocking, and becoming assignment-competent. 
This determination to become a perfectionist is shown in their undying quest to attain freedom for the backs. Their determination continues year-round. In the off-season, they run through their own programs to prepare themselves for the upcoming season. 
Through their work, they develop a sense of pride and leadership that rubs off on the rest of the team. This year is no exception. Not since 1968, with players like Poskon, Reilly, Kunz, DiNardo, McKinley, and Oriard, have the Irish had as talented an offensive line as this year's. 
At this point, I would like to introduce this) <!ar's Notre Dame offensive line. Team captain tight-end Dave Casper's athletic ability will match anyone's in the world. His intelligence makes it equivalent to ahving a coach right there in the huddle with you. As for his leadership, his mere presence on the field is a shot in the arm for the entire team. When the first game came around, many people said, "Demmerle who?" He wasted no time in showing everyone how good he really is. He is a highly motivated person. Pete is no Bob Hayes, but his intelligence and good moves make up for his lack of speed. 
At tackle, Steve Sylvester has grown into a very solid preformer. He is a hard worker, always thinking and giving the second effort. Steve has good leadership qualities and a great football mind. His counterpart at left tackle is Steve Neece. Steve plays next to me, and you won't meet a tougher guy: His desire and drive equals that of anyone on the team. He has overcome two serious injuries to become one of the best head-on blockers in the country. Off the field, Steve is a quiet guy, well-liked by everyone. He is a serious student who hopes to find a job in the business world. 
At center, Mark Brenneman, who has worked off a very serious back injury, has been a pleasant surprise for Ara and the whole offensive unit. His strength, poise, and range have made him a tremendous asset to the offense. Mark is a very polite, easy to get along with person off the field. He has a good sen~e of humor and likes girls. Mr. Brenneman is pleasant to talk to and should do well in whatever career he decides on. 
Lastly, we have Gerry DiNardo (probably the most colorful person on the offensive line.) Gerry is a hard person to figure out, but whatever his act is it's a good one, especially on the field. Mter a year's experience, Gerry has matured into a very impressive guard and should rank high on everyone's sheet both this season and enxt. Off the field, Gerry likes to experience as much of life as he can. With his outstanding humor, he is easy to get along with. Gerry's future plans are to graduate and continue on to grad school. One way or the other, Gerry DiNardo will excel in whatever he does. 
It has been my pleasure to be associated with this year's group. They are all fun to work with. This Saturday should prove to be just as much fun as we tangle with the Navy's midshipmen. 
Go Irish, Beat Navy!
