Editor's Note: This is the third installment of a multi-part series examining sustainability at Notre Dame. 
To make the goal of sustainability a reality for Notre Dame, the University must pay careful atten­tion to both economic and environ­mental factors, according to the Director of the Office of Sustainability Jim Mazurek. 
"!We want to) balance environ­mental and economic parts as well as the short-term and long-term goals of the University," Mazurek said. 
According to Mazurek, the cam­paign for sustainable energy is not solely an environmental movement. He said the University's motivations

Editor's Note: This is the final installment of a multi-part series examining sustainability at Notre Dame. 
As the General Electric Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt said at Wednesday's Forum on Sustainable Energy, "to do something, you have to do something." So how is Notre Dame becoming more sustainable? 
According to Tracy Jennings, co­president of Students for Environment Action, achieving true sustainability requires making peo­ple feel uncomfortable. 
"It's going to take a lot of change that necessarily won't be welcome," she said. It will take "a change in attitudes about what's necessary."

The Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes is a meaningful place for many people at Notre Dame, but perhaps for none more than Norbert Wiskotoni. Norbert, or "Norbie" as his friends call him, retired last month as groundskeeper for the Grotto, a position he held for the past 14 years. 
"I loved working there at the Grotto. That's why I stayed there so long. That was the best job I ever had," Wiskotoni, 75, said.

Students hope for third home victory 
By IRENA ZAJICKOVA 
News Writer 

Many optimistic Notre Dame students view Saturday's game against the Purdue Boilermakers as a chance for the Irish to prove their doubters wrong after last week's disappointing 23­7 loss to Michigan State. 
In their last game, Purdue pulled off a 32-25 comeback victory over Central Michigan. 
''I'm excited," sophomore Emily Murphy said. "I feel 
like this is a chance to redeem ourselves." 
West Lafayette, Ind., home of Purdue's campus, is only a short distance from Notre Dame. A large number of Boiler fans are expected to be present on campus this week­end, which will add to the charged atmosphere before and during the game, which kicks off at 3:30p.m. 
"The two schools are only two and a half hours apart, which definitely feeds into the rivalry," junior Justin

The Horseshoe turns bright red, Colorado blacks out the Rockies, practically the entire state of Pennsylvania shows up in their White T's to cheer for their Nittany Lions. 
Not to say that Notre Dame Stadium isn't one of the best places on Earth, but let's be honest the crowd could usn a little bit of work. Our bland navy blue shirts-those that wear them-don't do much to stand out against the rest of the collage of col­ors strewn about the stadium.

Sections 31 and 32, you are respon­sible for showing up in white. This shouldn't be too tough, most of the student body can probably just show up shirtless now that South Bend has taken care of whatHver tan you picked up over the summer. If not, grab a white t-shirt and throw it on. 
Finally, everyone in 30 and lower it's time to pull out those old school greens from the Ty Willingham era. If you've been at this school for three years and still don't have a green shirt. you are doing something wrong.

Notre Datne ipaugurates Kellogg's Ford Family Progratn 



Program lists teaching, research, community engagement as goals; economist Collier speaks at ceremony 
work with the [Catholic] Church and find ways within themselves to improve the lives that they're living. We have a lot of confidence in this pro­gram," she said. 
Dowd said the Congregation of the Holy Cross has been involved with Uganda since 1958, making it the natural choice for the starting point for the Ford Program. Eventually, Dowd said he would like to see the program expand beyond Uganda into other parts of Africa and possibly onto other continents. 
"We didn't spin the globe and just point to Uganda, we are involved with Uganda because we have strong ties there dat­ing back to 1958," he said. "Our plan is to expand gradu­ally over time. We do plan to expand within Africa, but it's quite possible that we would even expand beyond Africa sooner rather than later." 
Lyden said the partnership with Uganda Martyrs and Nnindye is a type of community engagement that is one of the cornerstones of the Ford Family Program. 
"Community engagement is partnering with local commu­nities and people and working with them to come up with a plan to pull themselves out of poverty," he said. "Our most important partners are the people on the ground living and working in these villages." 
However, because Notre Dame lacks an agriculture department, the Ford Family Program formed another part­nership with Purdue University in order to help improve farm­ing techniques in Nnindye and Ruhiira. 
"I think it was mutual inter­est which brought us together," Purdue professor of Agricultural Economics Jess Lowenberg-DeBoer said. "The effort is really directed to cre­ate a partnership between Notre Dame, Uganda Martyrs University and Purdue, which would work on improving the standards of living in the coun­ty which is right around Uganda Martyrs and eventually in the rest of Uganda." 
Dowd, however, was quick to note the majority of the work must be done by the villagers themselves if the Ford Family Program is to be successful, and the role of outsiders is sim­ply to support the people living in poor conditions rather than directly intervene. 
"Development projects that are driven by the agendas of outsiders almost always fail. One thing we have learned is that good intentions are not enough," he said. "We're devoted to working with people 


By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistam News Editor 
At the Notre Dame World Heath Forum in 2006, University President Fr. John Jenkins announced the creat­ing of the Millennium Development Initiative, which would encourage Notre Dame students become more involved in developing economies in Africa. Two years later, what originally started as a small initiative housed within the Office of the President has grown, with the help of a $6 million dollar donation from W. Douglas and Kathy Ford, into the Ford Family Program in Human Development Studies and Solidarity -a comprehen­sive academic institution which focuses on human development that was inaugurated Thursday. 
"[The Millennium Development Initiative] was a great project with a lot of potential, but it wasn't an aca­demic part of the University," assistant director of the Ford Program Tim Lyden said. "We were limited by our status as an initiative." 
World-renowned Oxford economist Paul Collier, who recently published a new book titled "The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It," also spoke at the inauguration and praised the new program. 
"[The Ford Family Program] offers the alliance between phi­lanthropy and youth, and that is the alliance that is going to change the world," he said. 
A new addition to the Kellogg Institute, the Ford Family Program "seeks to build a transnational and interdiscipli­nary alliance of scholars, pub­lic servants, conscientious citi­zens and institutional partners to address critical challenges confronted by those living in extreme poverty, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa," according to the program's brochure. 
Director of the Kellogg Institute Ted Beatty said he welcomed the new program into the Institute because it shared in the common goal of promoting research that had a positive impact of the lives of others. 
"The primary reason [the Ford Program became a part of Kellogg] is it fits exactly with our long standing mission of promoting social science research," Beatty said. 

Director of the Ford Family Program Fr. Bob Dowd said he had three main goals -teach­ing about extreme poverty, researching those conditions and engaging members-of those communities. 
"The very basic goal of the Ford Program is to realize Notre Dame's mission, and that is channeling the incredible power of the human mind towards promoting the com­mon good," he said. "More specifically the Ford Program is devoted to, first of all, expanding and .enhancing the opportunities that Notre Dame students have to study develop­ment in the classroom." 
The efforts in the classroom will include the hiring of new faculty members and the intro­duction of a new interdiscipli­nary minor in international development studies. 
"[The new courses] could fall into any major, but what we would like to do is explore the possibility of introducing an interdisciplinary minor in international development studies," Dowd said. 
Currently, the Ford Family Program is building on the relationships previously devel­oped by the Millennium Development Initiative in the Ugandan towns of Ruhiira, a cluster of eight villages, and Nnindye, a collection of 12 vil­lages located 10 miles west of Uganda Martyrs University, the country's premier Catholic uni­versity. 
"Uganda is an incredible country," Ford Family Program founder and member of the University Board of Trustees W. Douglas Ford said. Ford, along with his wife Kathy and son Matt, visited the country with Dowd in the early summer of 2007. "The thing that struck us most was that you have these people who, by American stan­dards, are living very modestly to say the least, and you have the joy of helping the people out." 
Kathy Ford said the family was looking to start a social justice program at Notre Dame for some time, and after visit­ing Uganda with Dowd, she and her husband decided to found the program. 
"Being in Uganda was really almost life changing. The needs were enormous, but so was the spirit of the people, willing to at the grassroots level." 

Angola-native Guerra Freitas, who is the director of the philanthropic group Share Circle, which is currently work­ing to found Angola Central Highlands University, agreed with Dowd's point about Africans helping themselves. Freitas said one of the best agents for change was educa­tion. 
"I like this philosophy of helping Africans help them­selves, and one of the best ways to really do that is through education," he said. "You need to empower Africans to take up the destiny of their own country in their own hands." 
Collier echoed this point in his lecture, arguing Africans themselves must be the agents for change. 
"Our role is to help them in their struggle, not do it for them.... We can make a differ­ence, but to an extent," he said. "If we over-glamorize our role, we will fail." 
Collier also said America and Europe each must change its policies towards Africa, which have helped destroy the coun­try, and called for a plan to help rebuild Africa similar to the Marshall Plan used to rebuild Europe after World War II. 
"Improper behaviors that have to be recognized as such and stop," he said. 
Collier called on Notre Dame students to help create the political pressure necessary to force politicians into action. 
"Until we get a more sophisti­cated citizenry, politicians will never be pressured," he said. 
Last year, five Notre Dame students visited Uganda to do research on aspects of every­day life in the county, such as the poor quality of the drinking water, and described their experiences in a video shown at the ceremony. 
The enthusiasm of students at Notre Dame was the chief reason the Fords wanted to endow a program at the University, Matt Ford said. 
"I can't imagine too many other places where a program like this would be as welcomed as at Notre Dame, simply because of the student body," he said. 
Lyden said this type of hands­on research would be a critical component of the Ford Program, and students will be able to apply for internships in Africa with the Ford Program through the Kellogg Institute. 
"We want to conduct and promote serious research that will have a positive impact on people suffering in the develop­ing world. It is research that attacks real problems," Lyden said.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -NASA is delaying next month's shuttle launch to the Hubble Spaee Telescope because of problems stemming from Hurricane Ike and replacement parts for the observatory. 
Space shuttle Atlantis is now set to blast off late at night on Oct. 14 for the last visit to the orbiting telescope, officials said Wednesday. Liftoff had been scheduled for the wee hours of Oct. 10, technically making this a five-day post­ponement. 
Senior managers will reassess the launch date next week.

McKenna receives award 
By MADELINE BUCKELEY 
News Writer 
Well-known on campus for his friendliness and a talent filr tap dancing, Dr. James McKenna, a professor in the anthropology d11partment, accepted the Charles E. Sheedy award for excellence in teaching Thursday. 
The Sheedy award has been given annually to a professor in the Colh1gc of Arts and Letters since 1970, according to the College's Web site. 
Socioloh'Y professor Dan Myers introduced McKenna as "the nicest guy in the world," joking that it is impossible to walk aeross earnpus with him in a timely manner because there arn always numerous students and faculty who stop him to chat. 
McKenna told th11 ObservPr he 
fnlt humblml, shocked and grati­
lied when he heard that he was 
to roceivo tho award. 
"What eould be better than bning told that you do well at something for which doing well moans pretty much everything," he said. 
MeKenna stressed thc idna that tea1~hing is a personal expe­ricnce in which you havB to transcend anonymity and make students realize that the teadwr earns about them personally. 
"For mn, teaching is not a sci­enen, but a unique art form," McKenna said at the award cer­emony twld in McKenna llall. 
lie said his teaching style involves getting to know nvPry student on a pPrsonal level. 
"I pretnnd I am teaching not to a dass. but lo one porson, as if I am having a conversation," McKenna said. 
I lis ttmching philosophies are partly inspired by his fourth grade tnaeher. Mrs. Masimina Hosn, lw said. "Everyday she would grent us onn by onn, hug us and whisper a personal mes­sage in our ear, telling us what a great day we would have," he said. 
"Learning was just enormously enjoyable and rewarding which reflects this notion that we are sensitive to the relational aspects of learning," McKenna said. 
McKenna began his teaching career at 25 at University of California Berkeley. rhe first class he taught was a large lee­turn class, he said. 
"I looked 15 years old and every T.A. was older than me by 5 years... but I survived," McKenna said. 
Thirty-four years later, McKenna said every class he teaches now is just as exciting, if not more, as the very first class he taught. 
"I've often asked myself how could I not be tired of some of the fundamental information, but I never tire of it and I know why that is the case," he said. "You see on the faces of your students the very surprise, excitement and shock that was on my f'aee when I first learned about some of the anthropologi­cal concepts, and its like I am learning it all over again." 
Along with teaching Anthropoloh'Y classes, McKenna teaches an Irish Amcrican tap dance class, turning his lifelong passion for dance into a Univnrsity course. 
A dancer since the age of two, McKenna has performed on the Lawrence Welk show as well as several other television pro­grams, he said. 
"The minute I saw Fred Astaire dancing on TV, I went to the nearest lloor and moved my feet," McKenna said. "I was a daneer beforn I was anything." 
The tap class combines Irish hard shoe dancing with American tap dancing, McKenna said. The eourse, whieh is avail­able to faculty and staff, teaches several dances and ends with a recital in South Dining Hall. 
Although a tap dancing profes­sor is a strange image, it is good for the students to see that even faculty members have diverse hobbies and skills, he said. 
McKenna's students and col­leagues praise his personal teaching style and fun personali­ty. 
Sophomore Elizabeth Benson said she was impressed that McKenna made a point to get to know everyone her Honors Introduction to Anthropology class. 
"He learned our names really quickly," she said. "You could tell he really loved teaching." 
She said she did not know much about Anthropology before the course, but loved it by the end of the class. 
"I am an anthropology major now because I liked his class so much," Benson said. 
Senior Kelly Donley took McKenna's Irish American tap class as a junior and now is a 
T.A. for the class. 
"He is good at communicating with the class and is always encouraging," she said. "He tap dances for us and has us do Irish Hard shoe dances as well as dance to a Michael Jackson number," she said. 
"It is one of the best classes I have taken," Donley said. "He is like Fred Astaire." 
Professor Dan Myers, last year's Sheedy award winner and the faculty member that nomi­nated McKenna, said Professor McKenna is a mentor and teach­ing partner to him. 
"Jim is the nicest person you would ever want to meet in your life ... that niceness is part of his teaching," he said. "People love him."

A fire broke out and was quickly extinguished at the University of Notre Dame power plant early Thursday morning. 
The fire was ignited at 

8:25 a.m. in an area of the plant that is currently under construction, Paul Kempf, director of Utilities, said. 
A tank of acetylene gas caught fire after hot metal from a steel pip being cut with a torch fell onto a hose connected to the tank. 
"Thanks to the quick action of our staff and some contractors and the use of fire extinguishers, the fire was quickly contained." 
Kempf said. 
A person present at the scene was able to shut off the valve to the tank, elimi­nating the source of the fire. Acetylene gas burns very quickly, he said. 
"By the time the fire department got there, the fire burned itself out." 
The plant reported no injuries or damages eaused by the fire. 
The blaze took plaee in an inactive area of the plant, so normal operations were not affected. 
According to Notre Dame News and Information, fire fighters from Notre Dame and Clay Township rnspond­~~d to the scene.

said cell phone chargers waste a lot of energy. 
"Cell phone chargers are a good example of 'vampire technology,' which means they suck a lot of energy just by being plugged into the wall,' she said. "95 percent is wasted; only 5 percent is used to actually charge the phone." 
The coordinators are opti­mistic about the competition's n't care less about energy consumption, those who just want a piece of pizza." Long said. "Everyone likes compe­tition, everyone likes prizes." 
"I think there are very few things that get Notre Dame students more excited than competition," Cline said.

"This is the first time we've had an online ticket sale for students," Goff said. 
The Association decided to sell tickets online after student phone calls to the office showed demand. However, there was sur­prise at how quickly the tickets flew off the shelves Tuesday afternoon. 
"I don't think anyone would have imagined they would have gone that quickly," Goff said. 
The Association has sold nearly 1,000 tickets to stu­dents this year alone, Goff said. Tickets are sold in the Eck Visitor's Center for stu­dents, and also on home game days at Gate 3 of the Joyce Center four and a half hours prior to kickoff.

Goff said the Association must have at least 300 tick­ets to have a student ticket sale. 
The Association held an in-house ticket sale for the San Diego State game and sold approximately 450 tickets, Goff said. 
This year, the Assoeiation also had aeeessibility to tickets for away games, a rarity, Goff said. "We sold over 100 tickets to Miehigan State for students." 
Goff said the Association attempts to provide tickets at every home game. 
"That's another goal -we want to get the tickets in the hands of alumni, fans, friends and family members of the University," he said.

IN BRIEF 
Lawyer: Stevens clueless about cost 
WASHINGTON -Sen. Ted Stevens was clueless about the cost and scope of a pricey makeover of his Alaska cabin that led to federal corruption charges and threatened his lengthy career, his lawyer said Thursday at the opening of his trial. 
Federal prosecutors allege that Stevens -one of Congress' most powerful Republicans and a patriarch of Alaska pol­ities for generations -lied on Senate forms about more than $250,000 in home renovations and gifts from a wealthy oil contractor and close friend, Bill Allen, who expected political favors in return. 
But defense attorney Brendan Sullivan, in making the first public defense of the 84-year-old senator, shifted blame to Allen and responsibility to Stevens' wife, Catherine. 

Gold prices drop as investors sell assets 
NEW YORK -Gold prices turned lower Thursday as an agreement in principle on a U.S. financial rescue package prompted investors to sell safe-haven assets in favor of stocks. 
In other commodities, crude oil rebounded on hopes that the $700 billion bank bailout plan would stabilize the teetering U.S. economy and boost domestic energy demand. The White I louse-backed initiative would take billions of . dollars in risky assets off the books of troubled banks and other financial firms in a bid to pry loose locked credit markets. 
Investors greeted the news as a hopeful sign of improved economic fortunes ahead, yanked money out of safe-haven assets like precious metals and plowed cash back into equities. 
Gold for December delivery fell $13 to settle at $882 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after earlier falling as low as $868.80. 
Other precious metals traded mixed. December silver fell 16.5 cents to settle at $13.275 an ounce, while December copper rose 
2.8 cents to settle at $3.1345 a pound. 
Jon Nadler, analyst with Kitco Bullion Dealers Montreal. said gold "made very little progress" as investors were wary of boosting safe-haven holdings after days waiting on the sidelines while officials worked out the bailout plan.

by global financial services firm Lehman Brothers, the collapse of other financial institutions and now. a possi­ble Congressional bailout for many corporations, has caused what Malpass charac­terized as the biggest crisis in his 20 years at Notre Dame. 
But the University invests with the knowledge that the stock market experiences downturns, he said. And crises have happened before in the financial markets, Malpass said, giving examples like the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the oil embargo in the 1970s and the Sep. 11 attacks in 2001.

ed Notre Dame's endow­ment is probably down two to three percent since the begin­ning of the fiscal year. 
"We are down but it's a rea­sonable outcome given what happened in the markets," he said. "It's nothing extraordi­nary." 
Notre Dame's investment team and managers are approaching the market situa­tion well. he said. 
"I don't like to be down ever, but you can't be up in this period. I don't care how diver­sified you are," Malpass said, with the caveat of investing solely in U.S. Treasury bills and bonds. 
Hegulation and oversight could have prevented the col­lapse of financial institutions on Wall Street, Malpass said, but Notre Dame has been able to protect and preserve its capital because of its invest­ment approach. 
Notre Dame's investments are more diversified than most, he said, and the University puts more in hedge funds that can go long and short. The University has also done well by investing in gold, Malpass said. 
The 'financial lifeblood' of the University At the close of fiscal year 2007, the rate of return on the

(574) 277-7239 
endowment pool was 25.9 per­cent, which placed Notre Dame in the top two among rates of return on university endowment. This year, the rate of return was substantial­ly lower, but everyone else experienced the same weak markets, Malpass said. 
Judging from the numbers he has seen from other schools, Notre Dame will prob­ably rank in the top five or six in terms of endowment returns of the top 20 endow­ments, he said. Top five or six is an estimate, as the rankings have not been released yet and Malpass said he has not seen all the numbers from other schools. 
The long-term goal of the endowment, Malpass said, is to beat inflation, and ideally gain a return of 5 to 6 percent above inflation. The endow­ment, he said, is the "financial 
lifeblood" of the 
years ago, 
Malpass said. It is the largest endowment for a Catholic university. 
In the long run, Malpass said, with good fundraising through the Spirit of Notre Dame campaign and good investments, he thinks Notre Dame can break into the top 10 in endowment size rank­ings in the next 10 years. 
Malpass, who marked his 20th anniversary at Notre Dame this August, said the senior leadership at the University, especially the investment committee of the Board of Trustees, have allowed him to build a strong team of investors. The team he built has had great stability and little turnover, Malpass said, with four of his six direc­tors working with him for 10 years or more. 
"When I came in 1988, the pool was $425 million. Now we are just over $7 billion ... " he said. "It's been a wonderful 20 years." 
Twenty years ago, the endowment supported less than five percent of Notre Dame's operating budget, Malpass said. It now funds over 20 percent of the cost of running Notre Dame.

Adopting, enacting sustain­able practices 
The Office of Sustainability is trying to do more about sustainability, having com­pleted Director Jim Mazurek's 100-day plan, something he enacted upon his installment as director of the office in May. 
One of the plan's goals was to begin the process of devel­oping a set of baseline data to judge Notre Dame's environ­mental impact -including the recently calculated carbon footprint -and the plan also required that the Office of Sustainability begin to devel­op a set of quantifiable per­formance targets ·based on that data. 
With those targets -and their recently developed mis­sion and vision statements ­the Office will begin to guide specific initiatives within seven core areas: energy, water, design and construc­tion, waste, procurement, food services and transporta­tion. 
Already, the University's emphasis on sustainability is showing results in many of these areas. 
For example, Senior Associate Director of Food Services Jim Yarbrough said Food Services worked to increase the amount of locally sourced food from 26 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2007. Any state that borders

there. 
"What used to get me," he said, "People would come down there, young people, and propose in the Grotto. That would always fasci­nate me; what better place to start your new life?" 
People are also what Wiskotoni misses most about the Grotto. 
"I have a Jot of friends -a lot of friends I made at the Grotto. A lot of people who go to Church every morning, and football fans from all over. People were outstanding, and the students were great. I miss it. I miss the Grotto and I miss my friends, and the people that I worked with. I worked with some very nice people," he said. 
Wiskotoni has livf:)d in South Bend all his life, "except for three years in the service," he said. He served in the Army in the Korean War from 1951-53. He counts himself as a "life-long fan" of Notre Dame, due to his "strict Polish-Catholic upbringing" and South Bend heritage. 
After the Korean War, Wiskotoni was 20, and began working and eventually raising a family of three daughters and a son in South Bend. He worked at South Bend Stamping making auto parts before he came to Notre Dame. 
When he retired from Notre Dame due to health concerns, he also retired from two part-time jobs working as a sacristan at St. Matthew's Parish, and driving a flower truck with Country Florist in South Bend. 
Wiskotoni began working at the Grotto permanently after being hired to help out part-time on football weekends, according to his supervisor John Zack, University Sacristan. Norbert was always "personally interested in the Grotto because of his devotion to his faith," and his absence has already been felt, Zack said. 
"Norbie never missed a day of work. l-Ie had a nephew that died, and he came back to work after the funeral. When his brother and sister died, the same. He showed up no matter how cold or hot it was, Norbie showed up to work and did what he had to do. He was a great guy, a super guy. He never complained about any­thing, he took special pride in keeping the Grotto nice and stocked and clean. It was a mat­ter of pride for him," Zack said. 
"Devoted" is the word most 
"Norbie is one of the most con­scientious workers I have ever known," Rocca said, "Norbie was totally devoted to Our Lady and to serving the many faith-filled peo­ple who would come to the Grotto to light a candle and pray." 
Rocca also related how it's diffi­cult to imagine the Grotto without Norbert, since he labored "from dawn until late at night," espe­cially on football weekends. 
"We will forever remember Norbie for helping to make [the Grotto] such a place of comfort and peace for the many who spent time there in prayer," Rocca said, "The Grotto is perhaps the most special place on the Notre Dame campus, and Norbie Wiskotoni helped make it so." 
One of Wiskotoni's responsibili­ties was to remove old candles from the Grotto and replace them with new ones. Wiskotoni said it takes about three hours to change all the candles each morning. 
Aside from the memories of the people he's met, Wiskotoni will take with him some humorous memories as well. 
"A woman's hair caught on fire once, I was cleaning some wax at the time, and it's a good thing I was standing there because I put the fire out so she didn't get burned," he said. 
Wiskotoni also told a story about finding students sleeping in the grotto. Often, students will sleep overnight on the benches in the Grotto and, "normally I let them go," he said, "But once, I came in early in the morning and there was a young couple sleep­ing down there inside the grotto. Sleeping against the donation box. It happened -I'm an old man, but I have a good memory." 
Although he's been away from the Grotto for a month, Norbert plans to return as soon as possi­
b~. ­
"I should be coming back in the very near future," he said, "I miss it -the people I worked with, the University, the grounds. Everyone [at Notre Dame] does an excellent job." 
As for the future, Wiskotoni said he wants to catch up on the fishing he's missed the last few years. 
"It's a little late now, but next year, if I'm living, I'll be out on a boat three times a week. I love to fish. That time -it's so relaxing -you catch a fish and that's bet­ter yet," he said.

New mayor shuts down crime lab 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -The Detroit police crime lab was shut down by the city's new mayor and police chief after an outside audit found errors in some evidence· used to prosecute cases involv­ing murder and other crimes, officials said Thursday. 
Wrongful convictions are a possibility, according to the audit, conducted by the Michigan State Police. Wayne County prosecutor Kym Worthy also noted that some criminals may have gone uncharged because of the lab's shortcom­ings. 
"We have no idea how many people are walking around that have committed crimes that we don't know about," said Worthy, who blamed the problems on human error, as well as a lack of funding, resources and training. 
The audit found erroneous or false findings in 10 percent of 200 random cases and subpar quality control compliance at the lab, Worthy said. 
The report revealed a "shock­ing level of imcompetence" in the lab and constitutes a sys­temic problem, she said at a news conference. When it caine to recognized work standards, the Jab met only 42 percent of a required 100 percent, Worthy said. 
Mayor Ken Cockrel Jr. and Police Chief James Barren made the decision to shut down the Detroit lab and use the state police lab for all Detroit criminal investigations. The lab com­mander was also relieved of duty, Barren said.

SIGN UP THIS WEEK: BAET 30300: Giving Voice to Values (Jessica McManus Warnell)-Course meeting dates: 9/19·11/S Take a course with nationally-recognized (Financial Times, others), cutting-edge curriculum.... The Giving Voice to Values (GW) course allows students the opportunity to develop a "toolkit" of specific steps toward ethical decision making and personal response to ethical challenges. Building on the BAET 20300 course, the GW elective explores the "post decision-making" stage. Thus, after one determines the right course of action, how does he/she act on it within a given context? The course will explore case studies and "scripts"-through individual and role-playing exercises, students will practice ethical decision making. Students will design their own scenarios and plans to teach ethical action. The course also includes the study of individuals who've contributed to society-what were their specific choices and actions? What were their paths to leadership? Includes a focus on 
relevant applications-entry level positions after graduation, job and other experiences students have already encountered or will soon encounter, and other practical contexts. Cases developed by the students may be

BAET 30500: Globalization & Corporate Responsibilities of Large & Small Companies (Georges Enderle)­Exciting new course with real-world application -Comse dates: 11/7-12/11 This elective course builds on the course "Introduction to Business Ethics" and focuses on the ethical responsibilities of large and small companies in the global context. Because globalization is mainly driven by powerful multinational corporations, we conduct several case studies of MNCs and investigate their roles and responsibilities. We also pay attention to the challenges posed by globalization to small enterprises (for instance, Grameen Bank) that make up the vast majority of companies and ask about their responsibilities. For a deeper understanding of corporate responsibility, we develop a consistent framework that ranges from the high level of principles down to the operational level. Specifically, we discuss the United Nations Global Compact with its ten principles and the Global Reporting Initiative with its metric of economic, social, and environmental performances. Finally, we explore ethical responsibility from an investor's perspective with the help of the UNEP Principles for Responsible Investment that consider environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues. The course will use chapter 10 and 12 of the DesJardins's book "An Introduction to Business Ethics" (third edition, 2008) and a course packet posted on the I drive. 


India looks to do business with U.S. 
Associated Press 
MUMBAI -Indian nuclear energy officials say they would like to do business with GE and other U.S. firms. But if they can't, there's always France and Russia. 
Even as a landmark U.S.­India nuclear accord hangs in limbo in the U.S. Congress, the global gates of nuclear trade with India are now open. 
Whether or not U.S. compa­nies get the go-ahead to sell nuclear fuel and technology to India, the country's nuclear officials are confident they will get their uranium. 
"If a deal with Congress doesn't happen, we will have business with other countries. So simple," said SK Malhotra, a spokesman for India's Department of Atomic Energy. 
India reached nuclear trade agreements with Russia and France in January, though the government has held out on implementing them until a U.S. deal goes forward, said Shreyans Kumar Jain, chair­man of India's state-run Nuclear Power Corp. Ltd., which runs all 17 of the nation's nuclear reactors. 
The agreement before Congress would overturn three decades of U.S. policy by allow­ing nuclear trade with India, even though India has not signed a global treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons. 
The deal enjoys broad sup­port among leaders of both American political parties but, with other priorities on law­makers' plates, there's no cer­tainty it will get the nod before Congress adjourns this month ahead of November elections. 
What would happen then is unclear. 
Meeting Thursday in Washington, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and 
U.S. President George W. Bush expressed hope that Congress will approve the agreement. 
Singh was to go on to France, where he was expected to ink India's nuclear agreement with that country. 
American companies worry they could be shut out of the Indian market. General Electric Co. helped build India's first nuclear reactor in the 1960s, and GE would love to rekindle that relationship. 
"It's a $30 billion-plus mar­ket in India. There's a huge opportunity for a company like GE," said Kishore Jayaraman, regional head of GE operations in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. "We have been pushing for it." 
Today, India gets just 3 per­cent of its energy_about 4,100 megawatts-from nuclear power. By 2032 the govern­ment plans to quadruple total generating capacity, to 700 gigawatts, with nuclear accounting for 63,000 megawatts. 
That adds up to about 40 new nuclear reactors, worth some $80 billion, according to Jain. 
A key limiting factor on India's nuclear expansion has been ·a{;cess to uranium. Despite an aggressive hunt in basins, thrusts, and folds across the country, known domestic deposits will support only 10,000 megawatts of nuclear capacity. 
"All reactors are going to be sourced from foreign vendors and tied to fuel supply agree­ments," Jain said. 
Previously, India was largely unable to buy nuclear fuel and technology from abroad, because of its refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and its testing of atomic weapons. 
On Sept. 6, under heavy lob­bying by the United States, the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group made a historic excep­tion for India. That opens the door for nuclear sales to India -but, in the U.S. case, Congress ml}st approve. 
Jain says Nuclear Power Corp. hopes to finalize con­tracts with GE, Westinghouse Electric Co., France's Areva group, and Russia's Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corp. to build a first round of eight reactors starting in 2009. 
The government, he added, plans to take a 30 percent equity stake in the new reac­tors, and borrow to raise the rest. 
Rosatom is already helping India build two nuclear reac­tors, under an agreement that predates Russia joining the Nuclear Suppliers Group. 
Areva has been active in pur­suing business, with CEO Anne Lauvergeon joining French President Nicolas Sarkozy on his January state visit, accord­ing to three Indian officials. 
If the deal doesn't go through Congress, said Ron Somers, presid~nt of U.S.-India Business Council, "we'll be the only one shut out." 
"It's like sitting on our hands watching a football game, not being able to play," he added. 
GE has been in close talks with the Indian government, Jayaraman said, but the com­pany cannot, by law, enter into advanced discussions absent a green light from Congress. 
"We have not had any detailed discussions," he said. A lot of Indian companies are also hopeful. 
Currently, private companies cannot operate nuclear reac­tors, but India is separating its civilian and military nuclear programs as part of the U.S.­India nuclear deal. That could pave the way for deeper pri­vate sector involvement on the civilian side, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, a top official in India's Planning Commission, said in a recent interview. 
Jain, of the Nuclear Power Corp., said a raft of companies, including the Tata Group, Reliance Power Ltd., GMR Infrastructure Ltd., GVK Industries Ltd., the Essar Group, and the state-run National Thermal Power Corp. have expressed interest in run­ning nuclear power plants in the future. 
Parts suppliers and builders, like Hindustan Construction Co., Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., Larsen &Toubro Ltd., Gammon India Ltd. and Godrej & Boyce Mfg. Co. Ltd. could also benefit from India's nuclear build-out. 
Deepak Morada, a spokesman for Larsen & Toubro, India's largest builder, said he thinks the capital and manufacturing requirements needed to help 400 million Indians who now live by can­dlelight switch on the lights, are simply too massive for the government to handle alone. 
"We are ready to partici­pate," he said.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Sequester this 

I almost laughed out loud when Dr. Moniz began talking about sequester­ing carbon dioxide underground yesterday at the forum. Surely I was mis­taken and he was really talking about storing dangerous nuclear waste material or something equally devious, but unfortunately he was not. 
I was highly disappointed that all the panelists believed in the man-made climate crisis theory and felt that it was the key motivator for alternative energy. 
Hello! 

The key reason to seek new forms of fuel is for peace and prosperity. It can be argued that many of the wars fought in the 21st century are linked to oil resourees from the funding terrorist activities to the invasion of Georgia by Hussia. We must stop this dependence on foreign energy as soon as possible to both create opportunity back home ("Drill, baby, Drill!") and to get our nation out of the global chess game for natural resourees. 
People are blaming greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide for causing a climate shift. That would be disconcerting if the earth's climate remained static at all times, but we know that the climate has shifted many times in its long history, way before humans were even here. God uses carbon diox­ide and oxygen in a cycle to regulate the earth. As carbon dioxide increas­es, plants thrive and through photosynthesis convert and store the carbon and give off oxygen. As oxygen becomes more prevalent in the atmosphere, plant growth slows down and carbon dioxide given off by animals or released through fires (fires occur naturally due to lightning or dry weath­er) returns to normal levels. 
It is all a natural cyele, an old idea that scientists think they just discov­ered because they have forgotten the power of God. lie was even nice enough to store that energy for us underground to use when we had devel­oped enough technology and knowledge. 
There is nothing wrong with using oil and other natural resources like timber that God has given us to utilize. There are still many parts of the world with bad pollution problems such as China and India. These are the places environmentalist should be pushing the issue, not wasting their time on a simple theory that is unlikely something we can prevent and that will not have noticeable repercussions in our lifetime and probably for thou­sands of years (it takes a long time to melt an entire glacier). God is a little smarter about these things than He'll have you believe, so keep the faith in Him. 
1look forward to the response letters.

Sustainability: It takes two 
In the past year, the University of Notre Dame has: implemented single-stream recycling to increase the overall volume of material recycled; emphasized locally grown produce and energy efl'iciency in Food Services; expanded game day recy­cling initiatives campus wide; created an Office of Sustainability with three full­time professional staff and a $2 million green loan fund; invest1~d $4 million to retrofit 25 buildings. And we've got a long ways to go.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Titne for Weis to go 
"You are going to have a hard-hitting, intelligent, nasty football team." 
These words, spoken in such a matter-of-fact way by Coach Weis at the beginning of his tenure, gave Notre Dame fans around the country hope. After three years, it is clear that we will never have a "nasty" football team with Weis running the show. 
I don't hate Charlie Weis. He respects Notre Dame tradition, embraces student life and has touched many lives through volunteer efforts. The problem is simply that Charlie Weis is not a college football head coach. 
While Weis displays a knowledge for the game and an uncanny ability to recruit talent, he is unable to combine the necessary skills to lead a college football team to a dominate level. In particular there are three main aspects of college football that Weis has been unable to grasp: motivation, game plan and putting his team in a position to excel. 
Coach Weis is not a motivator. The team is semi-disciplined, but rarely come out of the tunnel with the determination to beat up good opponents. While Weis has a desire to win, the emotion of our players is more business than excitement. This probably stems from Weis' NFL pedigree, but college is different. Teams need motivation. 
Secondly, Weis has failed to create a successful college football play­book. It is clear that he understands the Xs and Os of football, but the college game is dramatically different than the pros. When you don't have Brady Quinn's natural ability to lead your team to wins over mediocre teams, you need to adjust the game plan. The 2007 and 2008 seasons have displayed questionable coaching time and time again. Weis seems scared to run a misdirection or a cross-rout now that his players aren't NFL caliber. We have seen enough bubble screens, HB dives and fly-routs to last us a lifetime. What happened to a slant, post or pitch? 
Finally, Weis has failed to set his team up to win. We clearly have the talent to win football games. We have had back-to-back-to-back top-10 recruiting classes. While a select few of these players have relied on their God-given talent to excel, the team as a whole is underdeveloped. Do you think Pete Carroll or Jim Tressel would have allowed themselves to be put in a position to lose nine games? 
Attrition rate and lack of collegiate development are what put us in a position to have consecutive "off years". Charlie Weis hasn't desecrated our program, but our tradition of winning is fading, and has been for some time. You simply cannot go 3-9 at the University of Notre Dame. You cannot lose to the Naval Academy at home. And you certainly can­not lose by a combined 76-0 to your two greatest rivals. 
We used to compete for the National Championship on a yearly basis. This is certainly no longer the norm. Sorry Charlie, but I simply cannot picture you winning a National Championship. You're a good guy, a family man and a great recruiter. I'd certainly hire you as a quarter­backs coach. 
You just are not a University of Notre Dame head football coach.

An open letter to the ND football tealll 
By now just about everyone has heard that two of your teammates were arrest­ed for underage drinking this past week­end. 
I'm not angry because they were caught. I'm disappointed because they were drinking. 
Now I'm not saying this because I expect you to be the face of our University. I'm not saying this because I think it's morally reprehensible for an underage person to drink. I'm saying this because I don't think that this shows a commitment to excellence: 
I'm issuing a challenge because I think you are guys are good. Really legitimate­ly good. I see Floyd and Tate wreaking havoc on cornerbacks, and Jimmy mak­ing some absolutely perfect throws now and then. I see a defense that plays with energy, makes solid strong tackles and creates big plays. 
But here's the challenge: At the end of the day, this is the University of Notre Dame. And like it or not (and I think that athletes of your caliber look to these kind of challenges to get amped) we want a national championship here. 
Sure we'd like a winning record, we'd like to beat Michigan, we'd like to win a bowl game. But The Shirt's back shows the picture of a player wearing a No. 12 jersey. That's what we're about. And that's a big part of why you came. 
So here is why I am disappointed: Some of you drink. This is a fact. I've been to parties where you are nursing down your solo cup, and I've seen you at Recker's at 2:15 as a living tribute to Dionysus and Bacchus. My problem is that unfortunately for all of us, our bod­ies don't like alcohol. Our minds love it, but the next day if we aren't physically sick, we are fatigued and irritable. If I am erroneous on any of these counts I would love to be corrected. 
I know you guys want to win every sin­gle game. I can't imagine the physical torment you endure during your prac­tices and workouts. But I'm saying that's not enough. I'm saying, you gotta want it. 
And I know every one of you says you want it. And I know every one of you plays like you want it. I want to see your off-field selves to live like you want it. Your physical condition is integral to how you do on the field, and if you want to win a national championship you can't expect your 95 percent to best someone's 100 percent. 
It comes down to a commitment to excellence. A 100 percent commitment. Once you get through Bowl Season and return victorious from some glorious southern tourist location, I would love to see you guys imbibing with the rest of the student body. It brings us together. It gives us stories. You've earned it. But not in season. It's irresponsible to your team­mates and it's irresponsible to your­selves. 
I don't write this letter for me -I know that no matter how hard I yell, jin­gle my keys on third down or silently pump my arms to Celtic Chant it's you out there on the field. I'm simply asking that you put your best self on the field. 
And that requires your body to run at peak condition. I know your trainers will tell you this, but even five beers on a Saturday night are going to affect your performance on Monday. It's just the way it is. And it sucks. But every day you walk around campus you're the man. Period. It doesn't matter who else is in the room. 
So here's what my challenge is for the rest of the year: Don't drink until the off­season. You can still go to any party and have a great time. Play like a Champion, but prepare like one too. Don't do it for me. Do it for yourselves.

As this school year started the stu­dent body participated in a wide array of annual traditions. Freshmen partici­pated in Frosh-0, many students went to The Show. Dis-0 events happened 
across campus, the football season brought many alums back to campus, and stu­dents were once again physically assaulted while they were minding

off campus.  
Here in the north- House ofStix  
east neighborhood  
of South Bend, we  

have serious problems regarding safety of persons and personal belongings. While the problems are not limited to the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's com­munity, we as students are targeted for robbery and assault. All too often we hear about students getting assaulted walking home from bars, being robbed of personal belongings and being mugged at gunpoint. These are serious problems that require serious atten­tion. 
The problem is that the students-res­idents of the northeast neighborhood do not have serious people looking out for them. Why should we? We only pay rent to live here, pay tuition to attend school here and contribute just as 
THE OBSERVER 






IEWPOINT 
Why not serious? 
much as anybody else does to the greater good of the community. For all intents and purposes we are members of this community. So why do I always feel so unsafe in this area? 
Last weekend local police expended their forces raiding three local bars and breaking up a house party on Colfax Ave. While I have no doubt that the house party was probably out of control, I am fairly certain that the patrons of the Linebacker Lounge were doing nothing out of the ordinary. If local police forces have the capability to spend a good portion of their week­end night raiding local bars where nobody is causing any problems, why do they seemingly not have the capabil­ity to increase patrols in the increas­ingly dangerous northeast neighbor­hood? 
What is even more confounding to me is that the police forces no longer seem to simply be targeting Notre Dame stu­dents. I have only heard of Club Landing because of my summer listen­ing to Tommy and the Bartender on WAOR, and was completely unaware that Inferno Bar and Grill even existed. I could understand if the local police were interested in making a quick buck by fining students that do not perma­nently reside here, but the fact that they are seemingly prioritizing bar raids over resident safety is utterly mind boggling to me. 
Not only were three bars and a house party raided on Sunday morning, but, according to the South Bend Tribune, a 19-year-old woman was raped near Notre Dame Avenue, and a 19-year-old man was shot across town. One can only wonder if these two incidents would have occurred had local police been more concerned with patrolling troublesome areas as opposed to raid­ing bars that were not causing any problems. For an institution that claims their mission is to "seek and finds ~ays to affirmatively promote preSJ:Jrvao,.and deliver a feeling of secu­rity, safety and productive quality serv­ices for all citizens in our community," the South Bend Police are certainly failing. 

What makes matters worse is that University officials seem content to let this irresponsible behavior by our local police force continue unchecked. It appears that Fr. Jenkins has repeatedly refused to use his influence with local leaders to create a safer environment. When contacted about the recent stu­dent assault, he refused to discuss it. Fr. Jenkins seems to be more con­cerned about his 'Academic Forum' than about issues relating to student safety. It is horrifying to wonder what sort of tragedy must occur for him to finally step up and take action. 
Furthermore, our trustees and con­tributing alumni do not seem to care one bit about these issues. They will bend over backwards to put their 
page 15 
names on buildings and ensure their football tickets are secure, but using their influence to create action where action is needed is not something that these former students are interested in. 
I understand that the University as a whole does not want students to live or gather off campus, but these gather­ings are unavoidable. At the very least our leadership should be working with community officials to create a sensible use of the police force and to promote a safer community as a whole. A cer­tain level of danger will probably always be present in the Northeast Neighborhood, but it is clear to me that more could be done and more should be done. 
I can only hope that this situation is addressed by University and communi­ty leaders before something dire hap­pens. The last thing anybody wants is for the parents of a Notre Dame stu­dent to get a phone call saying that their child has been murdered. I am afraid, however, that with the blatant negligence of our local police and University leaders it is only a matter of time before this will seriously, and unfortunately, happen.

Eric Benet's most recent release, "Love & Life", seems an odd hybrid. One-third soul­gospel fusion. One-third, smooth jams, love 
'·ballads. And one-third nearly pornographic accounts of his sexual exploits. A winning combination? Not so much. 
Not only is Benet creatively confused, he also suffers from generic vocals, uninspired instrumental, and lyrics that oscillate between unintentionally comical to cheesy to blatantly dirty. This is perhaps not surprising to those who know Benet from his two claims to fame. First, there's his acting debut in Glitter, Mariah Carey's raspberry winning flop. And there is his infamous marriage to Halle Barry, which ended in separation due to Benet's numerous extramarital affairs and alleged sex-addiction. Both career highpoints are clearly tragic. 
The opening song, "Love, Patience, and Time," provides and interesting opening to album. With contrived, but smooth vocals

Benet testifies to the power of love and over­coming hardship. An un-extraordinary open­ing presents a solid set of Christian values that deserves to be called nothing better than nice. Ironically, this soulful Christian jam is proceeded by "The Hunger," an egotistical account of Benet's psychical relationships complete with unnecessarily detailed make­out secessions and sex scenes. 
This necrophilia soundtrack is then fol­lowed by "You're the Only One I Need," which is perhaps the most redeeming track on the album. Still, this stint of sweet monogamy seems out of place. And further­more, its vocals fail to carry it through to its full potential. Benet has a tendency to sound more like a talented backup singer, and in this case particularly, lacks the power to deliver. In this way, he fails to bring anything new to the table, instead offering only mun­dane songs with oddly contrasting thematic qualities. 
Though Benet attempts to follow in the great tradition of Marvin Gaye, he lacks the class, cohesiveness, and charisma to make it happen. There are no iconic love jams of "Let's Get It On" quality to be found on this album. A great example of this is "Everlove," a nauseatingly cheesy love song that sounds like background music for a 1970s preteen date at a roller rink. Something about it, much like the entirety of the CD, lacks fresh­ness and just doesn't work.

comes to shows aiming for "quirky," such as that CBS (I believe) sitcom from a few years ago, "The Brotherhood of Poland, New Hampshire," which was mercifully axed after less than six episodes. 
Which is why, when I heard that Greg Daniels was planning on referencing my hometown of Nashua, New Hampshire on the season premiere of "The Office," one of my favorite shows, I kind of freaked out a little bit. 
For a little background information, here's a brief history of the glorious Gate City. The second-largest city in the Shire, following Manchester, it was originally settled as the town of Dunstable. Fast-forward two cen­turies to the present day, when Nashua has grown to a city of 85,000 awesome Northern New Englanders. Our French-Canadian con­tingent is one of the strongest in the nation, which lends local cuisine a north-of-the-bor­der flavor (and a whole Iotta gravy). I've lived there since I was eight, and I'd have to say that I'm a big fan. 
Obsessive fans of "The Office" may remember Daniels' previous mention of Nashua in an earlier episode. When the Scranton staffers were filming a commercial in the season 4 episode "Local Ad," the film­makers from corporate showed them a pre­vious ad featuring the Nashua branch. Michael's reaction was that the Nashua branch "sucks." 

Daniels has said that Nashua was one pos­sibility for the setting of "The Office," and recently told the Nashua Telegraph that he has always liked the city's name for a north­ern branch of Dunder-Miffiin. Even new 
rep Holly (Amy Ryan) came to Scranton way of the Nashua branch. Allegedly, a candy company, Merrimack and Nashua­based Swan Chocolates, is due to get shout-out in an upcoming episode. 
This, plainly speaking, is awesome. 

Some residents of the Great North Woods region might argue that Nashua is filled with "flatlanders" who don't understand the real New Hampshire. 
It's true that I've only seen a few moose in my lifetime, one of which was strollin through the athletic fields at my high school. I've also never skied, but that's mostly because I have nightmares of that episode from "Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason" coming true. 
Nashua, friends, is truly just as New Hampshire as any other part of the state, and I'm psyched to let it represent the Shire on "The Office." 
Even if it's for less than thirty seconds at a time.

Cubs at Brewers 
8:00 p.m., ESPN 


Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -The Dodgers clinched their first NL West championship in four years Thursday with­out lifting a bat. 
Entering the day with a magic number of one, the Dodgers got what they needed when the second­place Arizona Diamondbacks lost 12-3 at St. Louis in the afternoon. That was several hours before Los Angeles faced the San Diego Padres in its final home game of the reg­ular season. 
Manny Ramirez found out the Dodgers officially qualified for the playoffs from a reporter after he entered an elevator to the team's clubhouse with teammate Pablo Ozuna about an hour after the Diamondbacks lost. 

"It's good, but it's just the first step," said Ramirez, who has played so well since joining the Dodgers less than two months ago that there's been MVP talk. "We're happy, but we're not going to go crazy about it. The goal is to go to the big dance, the World Series. This is not a cham­pionship yet. 
"Not a lot of players get a chance to go to the playoffs in their career. I've been blessed. You want to win it all. That's when you get that feeling you can't describe, like we had in Boston." 
The Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years in 2004, with Ramirez winning the MVP award, and won it again last year. But Ramirez wanted out a few months back, and got his wish, being sent to the Dodgers at the trade deadline. 
"The sky's the limit. You never know," he said of the Dodgers' chances. "We're a pretty good team. Anything can happen." 
The Dodgers have won just one postseason game since winning the World Series 20 years ago, going 1-12 in four playoff appear­ances. They'll face either the Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies or New York Mets on the road to begin the first round next week. 
The Dodgers were in trouble after losing their eighth straight game Aug. 29, a 9-3 setback at Arizona that gave the Diamondbacks a 4_ -game lead in the division. But with Ramirez leading the way, they entered Thursday night's game having won 18 of their prior 23 games, including five straight over the Diamondbacks. 
IN BRIEF Favre's ankle appears 
to be healing quickly 
FLORHAM PARK, N.J.-Brett Favre walked with only a slight limp Thursday. 
The 38-year-old Jets quarterback twisted his left ankle Monday night in New York's loss at San Diego. Though the ankle was tightly wrapped, Favre appeared to walk comfortably through the locker room before practice. 
He took part in warmup jogs and threw with no noticeable discomfort in the half-hour of practice the media are allowed to watch. Favre took one awk­ward step on a handoff and appeared to grimace, but seemed fine afterward. 
He was listed as limited at practice on the team's injury report for the second straight day. 
"He was able to get a little bit of action" on Wednesday, coach Eric Mangini said before practice, "and I think it will be a little bit more today." 
Asked if that included 11-on-11 drills, Mangini said: ''Yeah, there's a little bit of that and we'll progress as he progress­es." 

NFL clears Browns 
after Ravens' inquiry 
EREA, Ohio -The NFL found no evidence that Cleveland Browns defensive players intentionally gouged the eyes of Baltimore run­ning back Willis McGahee during the Ravens' 28-10 win last Sunday. 
Ravens coach John Harbaugh sent tapes to the league's office in New York earlier this week asking for a review of two separate inci­dents. 
McGahee was cut on his right eye­lid and was poked in the left eye. He was forced to leave the game twice. 
League spokesman Greg Aiello said there was no evidence to sup­port the Ravens' claims that the Browns tried to injure McGahee. 
Harbaugh declined to name the names of the Cleveland players in question. 
"I don't think we should say," he said. "I wouldn't want to comment on it, but you can see it on the tape." 
Armstrong to be tested 
before reJoining Tour 
LAS VEGAS -The anti-doping expert charged with monitoring Lance Armstrong said Thursday he would test the seven-time Tour de France winner for "everything" and keep frozen samples of Armstrong's blood to be analyzed in the future. 
Don Catlin, who ran the first anti­doping lab in the United States at UCLA for 25 years, said testing details, including costs, still must be worked out with Astana, the Kazakhstan-based team that will pay for it. 
But he expressed confidence the pro­gram would be complete in testing for banned substances. 
"Everything that you've heard, and then probably some new ones," Catlin· told The Associated Press after appearing with Armstrong in Las Vegas. 
''I'm going further and I'm doing it because it's important for the world to recognize how to do these personalized anti-doping programs," Catlin said.

MEN'S INTERHALL 
Rivalry game pits Knott against Siegfried 

Fisher, Carroll battle for first win of season; Duncan battles Alumni looking for first ever interhall victory 
By NATHANIEL LEE, LIZA 
NAVARRO, SHANE STEIN­
BERG, CHRIS MICHALSKl, 
MOLLY SAMMON and CHRIS 
MASOUD 
Sporrs Writers 
Knott vs. Siegfried 
The across-the-quad rivalry 

between Siegfried and Knott will 
heat up once again this Sunday 
when the teams eollide at 1 p.m. 
at Heihle Fields. 
Thfl Humblers will be looking to begin another playoff-bound season against the Juggerknotts, who are hungry to return to post-season play after a disap­pointing 2007 campaign. 
Last week's bye gave Siegfried plenty of lime to think about last year's semi-final disappointment. 
"It obviously wasn't good enough and it left a bad tast11 in our mouths," Hambler captain Kevin Kelley said. "This year we look to go undefeated and win in Notre Dame Stadium." 
Meanwhile, the .Juggerknotts have been working hard to leave last year's l-3 disaster in the past, starting the season with a 6-0 win over Duncan. 
"Last year was overall a disap­pointing season," captain Aiden Fitzgerald said. "This year we have changed our whole outlook, and h<~ve ~eon working on better executiOn. 
Siehrfried will ndy heavily on a strong defense to stop the .Juggerknotts. The Ramblers hope a significant amount of vet­eran experience can lead them to the win. 
"We do not have key players, only a team that plays together looking to win and have fun doing it," Kelley said. 
Knott hopes a fresh young oll'ense will match up well with the Humbler defense. Sophomore quarterback .l.T. Hedshaw and junior receiver Jell' Skourup will bP key the passing game, while sophomore running back Cameron Smith is likely to get most of the touches in the back-liPid. 
"We'rn attempting to get away from the stagnant, mundane football we played last year and play with morn nxeitmnent and speed," Fitzgerald said. 
The gritty, experienced Hamblnr defense will be matched up against the flashy new-look Juggerknott offense this weekend in a game sure to have an impact on the playoff raee, and Mod Quad bragging rights for the futum. 
Fisher vs. Carroll 
With both teams looking to avenge tough losses, Fisher and 
Carroll will take to the field 
Sunday at 2 p.m. at Riehle 
Fields. 
In their opening games, Fisher 
and Carroll were held to only 
one touchdown by Sorin and St. 
Ed's, respectively. 
"After losing a heartbreaker to 
Sorin in the fashion we did, we 
are really looking to comeback 
strong and get a win," Fisher 
captain Brian Monson said. 
The Green Wave will be count­
ing on their strong defensfl, led 
by defensive end Patrick Hessert, 
linebackers Cameron Compson 
and Bill Whitaker and safety 
John O'Connell, to stop the 
Vermin offensive. 
"Before allowing that incredi­bly unlucky final drive which allowed Sorin to score, they had barely allowed positive yardage all game and forced several turnovers," Monson said. 
Fisher also suffered from 
many unnecessary penalties 
against Sorin, arid will try to 
eliminate these on Sunday. 
On the other side of the ball, the Green Wave are hoping to end more of their drives with touchdowns, and have made a few new additions and adjust­ments to their playbook. 
Sophomore quarterback Mike McMahon showed great poten­tial in his first start last week, scoring Fisher's only touchdown. As he continues to learn the oll'ense, he will be a key player going into Sunday's game. 
The Carroll offensive will be led by the duo of quarterback Kris Kast and wide receiver Tommy Mumford, who scored the team's only touchdown last weekend. 
Defensively, the Vermin have been working hard at practice this week, and will be focusing their attention on a strong sec­ondary. 
"Since both teams lost their first games, the team that loses will most assuredly be out of playoff contention," said Monson. 
Duncan vs. Alumni 
After both being shut out in their season openers, Duncan and Alumni will take to the field this Sunday looking not only for a win, but for a much-needed momentum builder. 
For Duncan, a victory this Sunday would be their first ever win. For the Dawgs, a team with experience on its side, a win this week would mark the first time they've won in almost two years. 
Duncan is led by freshman quarterback Chris Toups, who the team is very high on despite him not having playing football in high school. Other teams have 

had years to grow into a cohe­
sive unit, Duncan has only had a 
handful of practices to put a 
team together. Not to mention 
they're facing the hurdle of 
securing their first victory ever. 

"It would be huge for us to get 
that first win," Duncan captain 
Garrett Burke said. "It would 
definitely be a big momentum 
builder for us." 

For Alumni to come away with 
a victory Sunday, shutting down 
Duncan's long passing game is 
essential. Freshman safety 
Barrick Bellman could play a big 
role in this aspect. 

"We're very high on him," Alumni captain Luke Betterman said. "He's very fast and hits hard." 
On offense the Dawgs are led by quarterback Brian Baz, who will look to move the ball by opening up the pass and estab­lishing a consistent running game. 
Duncan will look to use a 
power running game to open up 
the field for Toups, who will be 
looking to his wide receiver core, 
especially Adam Zaabel and 
Mike Kearney, to tinally establish 
a passing game after failing to do 
so in their first game. 
Sorin vs. Zahm 

This Sunday, the Sorin Otters will look to continue their win­ning ways as they face off against the Rabid Bats of Zahm. 
The Otters (1-0-0) defeated Fisher 8-6 last week thanks largely to a controversial penalty call. 
Junior captain Rob Gallic seemed satisfied with their per­formance, especially that of the defense. 
"Our defense was dominating, as was expected," he said. 
Their opponent this week, Zahm, has yet to kickoff their 2008 season, as they had a first week bye. The Habid Bats hope to improve on last year's 2-1-1 regular season record and a close loss in the first round of the playoll's. 
According to Zahm senior cap­tain Theo Ossei-Anto, the main issue this year will be their lack of experience. 
"We have a lot of freshmen at key positions," Ossei-Anto said. "So we don't want to add too many kinks." 
One of these freshmen is quar­terbaek Greg Bennett, who will be leading the offense. Non­freshmen standouts this season are likely to be sophomore wide receiver Xavier Murphy on offense and junior linebacker Jarred Carter on defense. Anchoring the line will be senior Luke Derheimer. 
In preparation for the tough 
Otter defense, the young Zahm 
team has been working in prac­
tice on the basics of throwing 
and passing. 
Sorin, on the other hand, has 
been focusing their attention in 
practice to the victory formation 
and team endzone celebrations. 
The teams kiek off Sunday at 1 
p.m. at Riehle Fields. 
Dillon vs. Keenan 
After both teams were shut out 
last week, Dillon and Keenan 
fight Sunday not only for victory, 
but for a chance to prove that 
they can put some points on the 
board. 
"Keenan is considered the 
benchmark for inter-hall foot­
ball," Dillon junior wide receiver 
Chris Cugliari said. "Most teams 
can look to Keenan as a way to 
measure their progress, and this 
Sunday should give us an oppor­
tunity to do so." 
The game will be a match up of excellent defenses. Though Keenan was unable to score, its defense also shut out Keough to finish with a 0-0 tie. Dillon held a powerful O'Neill offense score­less for the whole first half last weekend. 
Keenan is working on a plan to prove its offensive game before Sunday. 
"We need to be able to consis­tently run the ball, so we need to work on team run blocking," Keenan sophomore Bart Dear said. "Also, quarterbacks and receivers need to continue devel­oping their timing," 
Senior running back Alex Gonzalez and senior wide receiv­er Jim Zenker will be the players to watch this Sunday as the Knights try to put the ball in the endzone. 
Dillon has a different approach towards bringing a better oll'en­sive game this weekend. 
"We're detinitely concentrating on eliminating our mental mis­takes on offense," Cugliari said. "We feel if we just execute the way we can, we're a team that can move the football." 
Dillon quarterback Joe Carigliano will be greatly tested come Sunday's game, and stand­out defensive players Ryan Shestak and Brett Barceau will try to stop Keenan's reworked offense. 
The two teams face off Sunday at 3 p.m. at Riehle Field. 
Keough vs. Stanford 
The defending champion Stanford Griffins will begin their quest for a second consecutive undefeated season this Sunday as they take on the up-and-com­ing Roos of Keough (0-0-1 ). 
After posting a perfect record 
of 7-0-0 last season that ended 
in a victory at the stadium, the 
Griffins expect nothing short of a 
repeat. 
"Last year we established our­
selves as one of the premier 
dorms in interhall football," sen­
ior captain Brian Salvi said. 
"With most of our key players 
returning, we have our eyes on 
the stadium." 
Led by Salvi at quarterback, the Griffins look to keep their offense simple but effective as they march downfield. Senior captains John Burke and Karun Ahuja will present a threat to the Hoos in the trenches, while returning safety David Costanzo anchors the secondary. 
The Hoos are anything but intimidated by the versatility of the Griffins. Emerging last week with a tie against Keenan, Keough is hungry for its first vie­tory of the season. 
''I'm never satisfied with a tie, but I was pleased with the way we played last week," senior captain Kevin Laughlin said. "Our defense was spectacular, especially against a dynamic offense like Keenan's." 
Holding Keenan to only fifty­two yards on the ground, the Keough defense looks to be just as stingy this week. However, they will be playing without freshman standout Patrick Gleason, who was injured last week during an interception return. 
Junior quarterback Matt Brennan will be key to the Keough offense this season, bringing his speed and power to the gridiron. Senior captain Nazur Ahmed adds versatility to the Hoos as both a running baek and middle linebacker. 
Both teams are confident they can emerge from Sunday's game as the favorite to win it all. 
"Not only do we have the moti­vation, but we have the person­nel and talent on offense and defense to run away with the division." Salvi said. "We'll be ready." 
Keough captain Ahmed also believes his team will be fired up and ready to go against Stanford. 
"Keough has be1m waiting for a team like this for years," Ahmed said. "This is the year we make a name lor ourselves." 
The two teams matchup Sunday at Hiehle Fields at 3 p.m.

I Walsh grabs first win of season oVer Pangborn 
By MATTHEW WILSEY, RYAN 
O'CONNELL and CHRIS 
WYNKOOP 
Sports Wri 1ers 
Walsh 19, Pangborn 6 
Walsh narnP.d their first win of 

the season last night with a victo­
ry over Pangborn. 
The Wild Women (1-1 ) jumped 

out to an early lead aided by a 
punt return inside the 20-yard 
line. Following a reverse that 
brought the ball to the 1-yard 
line, Meghan Hadley scored 
Walsh's first touchdown of the 
season on a double reverse. On 
tlw next possession. !Iadley gave 
Walsh a 13-0 lmtd with a 1 0-yard 
touchdown recpption from. quar­
terback Amy Langnncker. 
Thn Phoxes (0-2) answered 

with a 5-yard touchdown pass to 
Cathy Poploski from quarterback 
Cabby Tate, making the score 
13-6. Thn Phoxns threatened to 
score anottwr touchdown right 
bd'ore the first half. but Gabby 
Tate's 20-yard pass was dropped 
in the end zone. 
Walsh added a late touchdown 

on a QB sneak to make the score 
19-6. 
Last night's game was a major 

turn around l(,r the Wild Women. 
"We were timid in thn first 
game," assistant coach Dan 
Brown said. "This week we were 
a lot more aggnssive. While we 
had a lot morn penalties, that's 
no a problem because it is morn 
important that we were playing 
hard." 
Part of th1~ success may have been due to shifted coaching rnsponsibiliti1~s. Al't1w last week's loss, !wad coach JJ Heyes took over both tlw oll'ensivn and thn delimso. 
"We are focused on having mow fun and that is translating on the field," HPyns said. 
Missl'd opportunities prevented the Phoxns from scoring morn points. The n~ceivers couldn't hold onto the ball. dropping sev­eral passes, induding two in the end ZOIW. IIOW!Wer, one high­light for Pangborn was the play of Tate. Slw had no problem throwing the deep ball or throw­ing rolling out of thn pocket. 
"Siw movPd around in the pocket well and nxtnndnd lots of plays," of'f'pnsivn coordinator Patrir.k Kirkland said. "She put us in a position to win the ganw." 
Pangborn will look to get their first win of the season this week­end at Badin. 
Farley 14, Badin 12 
In a heated ganw with two lead changes in the final minutes, Farley's Firwst pulled out a dosH win against the Badin Bullfrogs. 
Farley quarterbaek Emily Murphy and Badin quarterback Katie Hose each threw two touchdowns in the game. 
The first few drives of the game left both teams scoreless thanks to each team's strong defensive play. Despite Farley's ofl'ense driving inside the Badin 20-yard line twiee, Badin's red­zone defense prevailed and Farley was unable to capitalize on the good lield position. 
"Their defense stopped us a couple times on the 1-yard line and we kind of got sick of it," Farley captain Jenny Hoi[<> said. 
Farley went on to score a touchdown and lake the lead 7-6. But after throwing an intercep­tion, Badin was able to drive down the liPid and take the lead 12-7, thanks to a failed 2-point conversion. 
With two minutns left in the 
game, the pressure was on for 
Farley to score quickly, but there 
wasn't a sense of panic from the 
team. 
"I knew that we had enough time and we had been moving the ball pretty successfully all game but hadn't put it in the end zone. It was a matter of determi­nation and we got it done," Rolfs said. 
On a series of great plays, Farley quarterback Emily Murphy had several great runs to pick up a first down when the team needed it. The drive result­ed in a touchdown and sealed the win for Farley's Finest. 
"!The winl was awesome. 
When we needed it, we brought 
it together. Our quarterback had 
some great runs and we ended 
up winning," Holls said. 
"You have to give it to Farley, they played great at the end of the game and got the win," Rose said. 
Despite the loss, the Bullfrogs' pnrfi1rmance gave them plenty of reasons to be excited about the rnmainder of the season. 
"I was really proud of our girls. I think this is the best I've seen us play oll'ensively and defensive­ly in the past few years," Rose said. 
Welsh Fam 19, Lewis 0 
The Welsh Family Whirlwinds came out tiring on all cylinders as they took down the Lewis Chicks on Thursday night. 
Quarterback Jenni Gargula completed her first thn~e passes, then threw a 20-yard touchdown pass and converted the extra point to give the Whirlwinds an early 7-0 lead. 
"Wp, rnally moved the ball well early," Gargula said. "Lewis was playing man-to-man coverage to start and we threw downfield to exploit that. Our receivers matched up well against them." 
After the quick score, the first half settled down into a defensive battle as both teams had drives that ended in interceptions in the opposing tnam's end zone. The Chkks had their best opportunity to scon~ late in the first half, after a good defensive effort gave them the ball in Whirlwinds ter­ritory. llownvnr, as they often did, Welsh Fam came up with anotll­er interception and went into the half with the lead. 

In the second half, the Whirlwinds dominated on both sides of the ball. The defense added two more interceptions to give them a total of four for the game. Senior Erin Fitzpatrick picked off two, senior Katie Hehberger added another, and sophomore Samantha Miller tal­lied one more. On offense, Gargula passed for one score and handed off the ball for another.

offensive coach Mark Mihallo had words of praise for his team. 
"Overall it was a great win, we passed and ran very well," MihaJlo said. "Still, all the crndit has to go to our defense today." 
"It was our second shutout of the year, our defense really stepped up. We stuck to our game plan and it worked for us. We have some work to do this week to improve some of our coverage schemes, but we're feeling good," assistant coach 
David Costanzo said. As for Gargula, she has her team focused on what's ahead. 
"We're confident right now, but we have some tough games com­ing up," she said. ·"Ultimately, we have our minds set on going to the stadium."

SMC SOCCER 
Comets to face Belles after layoff 
By MIKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's will return to the field for the first time in 10 days on Saturday when it takes on the Comets of Olivet College. 
During the long layoff, the team has tried to keep a competi­tive edge. 
"Dun to the long lay oil' since our Hope match, our training sessions have been a bit shorter in length," Coach Hyan Crabbe said. "Hather than bum the kids out, wn havn wmd this time to do some teaching and mix in some competitive activities as well. It is really tough because it almost feels like going through pre-sea­son all over again." · 
In their last match nearly two weeks ago, Saint Mary's lost a hmtrtbreaker to !lope College, whose two goals in the final sevnn minutes lifted the Flying Dutch to a 2-1 win over the Belles. I>nspite the loss, the Belles are nager to return to the field for their first conference match of the year against Olivet. 
"One of the easiest ways to get over a tough loss sometimes is to turn around and play another match," Coach Crabbe said. "The players have responded quite well." 
Entering the match, Coach 
Crabbe expects to have a full, healthy roster for the first time this season. 
"We have actually gotten very healthy," the coach said. "For the first time all year, our full roster is training and healthy. This has allowed me to really look at play­ers and develop our depth." 
Entering this weekend's eon­test, the Belles know that the stakes have been raised as they begin conference play. ·-­
"This weekend we open con­fernll<~e play and really need to get out and g(~t a positive result," Coach Crabbe said. "The players know every match has added meaning from here on out." 
In Olivet, the Belles face a team that they should match up with very well. When the two teams met last season, the match ended in a scoreless tie. The previous season, the Belles beat Olivet 3-2. 
Saint Mary's enters the match with a record of 1-4-1, including a championship in the Sal Vacarro tournament at North Central College. Meanwhile, the Comets enter the match with a 4­4-1 record on the season. This is the first conference match of the season for both squads. Play begins Saturday at Olivet at noon.

"Hodriguez has been sick and we're hoping to see her feeling bet­ter and have an oulo.;tanding day at home. The Calvin team is ranked second in the nation and will unde­niably lead the entire field, but I would like to see our ladins stick up there with some of the young talent at Hope."

The last time the Trojans Wflr11 in Corvallis, back in 2006, they wern upset by the Beavers, 33-31. That loss snapped a 38-game regular-season winning streak for the USC, ranked No. 3 at the time.

The Beavers squandered a chance to add to the lead 

midway through the fourth when they tried for a l"ield goal, but Sean Sehnem's 41-yard attempt was blocked. 
The Beavers opened this season with two losses, at Stanford and Penn State, before returning home for a victory over Hawaii. 
Despite their struggles, the Beavers had ·seen steady growth on offense and the emergence of Jacquizz Hodgers, who went into the game against the Trojans as the nation's leading freshman rusher with 87.7 yards per game. 
USC had shown little vul­nerability in victories at Virginia and then at home against then-No. 5 Buckeyes. But coach Pete Carroll noted earlier in the week that the familiarity of Pac-1 0 play posed a danger.

The Beavers more than held their own through the first half, with the Trojans appearing confused about how to handle the 5-foot-7 Jacquizz Hodgers -James Hodgers' younger brother.

Red Sox trump Indians behind Lester's effort 

Boston's southpaw ousted Cleveland with six innings, allowing only a pair of hits working on just 86 pitches

BOSTON -If the Cleveland Indians hadn't broken up Jon Lester's bid for his second no­hitter this season, his own team would have. 
"He was coming out," Red Sox manager Terry Francona said. "I told him that was the first time I've ever rooted against him. The only way you're going to see something like that, it would've had to have been a group effort."

-if they win their last three games of the season and Tampa Bay loses its last three. The Rays lost to the Detroit Tigers 7-5 on Thursday and hold a two­game lead and the tiebreaker in the division. 
To Boston, that was more important' than whether Lester (16-6) became the fifth pitcher in history with two no-hitters in a season. Francona was spared an uncomfortable situation when Josh Barfield lined a clean double into left field to lead off the sixth; Lester also gave up Jamey Carroll's RBI single before leaving with a 5-1 lead. 
Lester said he wasn't worry­ing about where he fit into the playoff rotation. Instead, he's just happy to know he has a spot after going into last year's postseason as a mopup man before eventually getting the start in Game 4 of the World Series when Boston clinched its second title in four years. 
''I'm not worried about Game 1, 2, 4, 8," he said. "Whatever it is, give me the ball and I'll go pitch." 
Three Red Sox relievers threw a perfect inning apiece to finish off the two-hitter, with Jonathan Papelbon pitching the ninth in a non­save situation t9 get ready for next week's playoffs. First comes a weekend series against the rival New York Yankees that is uncharacteris­tically meaningless. 
"That's OK," Francona said. 

"It's fine with us." 
Jacoby Ellsbury and Jed Lowrie, the top two hitters in the Boston order, hit back-to­hack singles in the first and back-to-hack doubles in the second as the Red Sox opened a 5-0 lead after two against Jeremy Sowers (4-9). 
Lester allowed just one baserunner in the first five innings, hitting Grady Sizemore with a pitch in the third. The Indians didn't get a hit off the 24-year-old lefty until Barfield, the No. 9 hitter who entered the game batting .160, led off the sixth. 
Barfield took third on a balk and scored when Carroll sin­gled under second baseman Dustin Pedroia's glove. But Lester got Ben Francisco on a weak flyball to right and struck on Johnny Peralta to

every match seriously. The non-conference and confer­ence seasons build on one another. It's just another part of the season." 
The Irish are looking for­ward to the Big East season and want to see a strong showing early. 
"We are definitely going in with an intensity," Brown said. "We will be determined and fired up." 
The Irish have been game­planning this week to fill the void left by junior outside hit­ter Serinity Phillips, who is out with, an ankle sprain. Phillips was on the all Big East presea­son team. 
"It's a day-to-day thing," Brown said. "[Phillips) will definitely not play this week­end. She is going to stay at Notre Dame and we are going to try and get her ready for next week, but that is still uncertain." 
To counter the loss of Phillips, the Irish have been experimenting with some dif­ferent combinations. 
"We want to try and get a rhythm with different lineups," Brown said. "We want to try and be balanced and move people around in the lineup. Our best two hitters [junior outside hitter Christina Kaelin and [freshman outside hitter Kristen) Dealy need to get the ball." 
Brown also wants to utilize some formations that the team is not necessarily used to. 
"We want to experiment with people for a better block and use different weapons," Brown said. 
First up on Friday is a trip to South Florida (9-5). The Bulls currently sit at third in the Big East thanks to a strong non­conference showing to start the season. 
USF is led by junior outside hitter Marcela Gurgel who earned All-American honors last year. Gurgel currently ranks fourth in the NCAA in kills per set at 4. 7 5 and ninth in aces per set at 0.63. 
Gurgel had a season high 23 kills and four aces in their match last year against Notre Dame. The Irish pulled out the home match with a four-set victory. 
"South Florida depends pret­
. ty heavily on their outside hit­ter Gurgel," Brown said. "We need to be concerned about Gurgel, but we can't just con­centrate on her." Sunday's match comes against a much-improved Georgetown (7 -6) squad. The Hoyas sit at sixth in the Big East with a decent non-confer­ence season. "Georgetown will be much improved from last year," Brown said. "They were near the bottom last year and they have no returning players to carry them, but we are Notre Dame and we will have a tar­get on our backs. We expect to be pushed." Senior setter Caitlin Boland is fifth in the Big East, averag­ing 10.78 assists per set. The Hoyas rank fifth in the Big East and No. 60 in the nation with 1.64 service aces per game. Look for the Hoyas to try and exploit this advan­tage. The Irish will continue Big East play next week with matchups against Louisville and Cincinnati.

Tvvins overco111e division rivals 
Alexi Casilla's 10th-inning single puts Minnesota back in first 

Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS -The win­ning run reached home plate to put the Minnesota Twins back in first place, and Carlos Gomez and Denard Span still had plenty of ener­gy to burn. 
They raced from the dugout toward Alexi Casilla and tackled their teammate, in celebration of his 10th-inning single that capped a 7-6 comeback victory over the Chicago White Sox on Thursday night and gave Minnesota a half-game lead in the AL Central. 
The Twins love to use their speed, and they ran circles around the wilting White Sox while sweeping this three­game series. 
"They play their heart out, they show up to play against us this week, and the result was what you saw," Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen said. "They never quit." 
The White Sox led 6-1 after a six-run fourth in which Minnesota starter Kevin Slowey was knocked out with a bruised wrist and the Twins made three costly defensive mistakes. 
"You think, 'Oh, boy, there they go.' But you know what? Not this ballclub," Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire said. 
The Twins host the Kansas City Royals three times this weekend to finish their schedule, while the White Sox head home for a three­game series against the Cleveland Indians. If these teams are still within a half­game of each other after play is completed Sunday, Chicago must make up a rainout against the Detroit Tigers on Monday. Then, if they're tied, the Twins will have to travel to the South Side for a one­game playoff Tuesday to determine the division cham­pion. 
Save for that fourth, which Guillen called their only good inning of the series, the White Sox looked beaten all week. Missing Carlos Quentin (wrist) and Joe Crede (back) from theirlineup didn't help, but the rest of their sluggers contributed little. 

Catcher A.J. Pierzynski was defiant. 
"It sucks, but we're still alive," he said. "Hopefully we go home and win four games and we kick their (butt) on Tuesday.... They found a way to get enough hits and scrape some across. (Stuff) hap­pens." 
Joe Nathan (1-2) pitched two perfect innings for the victory, part of a Minnesota bullpen that totaled 6 1-3 scoreless innings and surren­dered only two hits. 
Casilla's soft hit into short. center off Bobby Jenks (3-1) scored Nick Punto and led to a wild party on the field at the Metrodome, where the Twins went 8-1 against the White Sox this year. 
"We're going to give you nine tough innings no matter what. You can never count a team out that has heart like we do," first baseman Justin Morneau said. 
Matt Thornton relieved White Sox starter Gavin Floyd and got four outs on 10 pitches, but Brendan Harris greeted him with a pinch double in the eighth and Guillen summoned Jenks after one out. Gomez made up for a fielding gaffe with four hits and two RBis, sin­gling in Harris and scoring on Span's triple off Jenks to tie it at six. 
Span repeatedly pumped his fist and screamed toward his dugout, while Jenks walked around behind the mound muttering to himself. His streak of 15 straight saves converted ended. 
"We've got a lot of confi­dence. We've got a lot of young guys here and ... if we keep playing like that, we make the World Series," said Gomez, who also made a slid­ing catch to end the ninth. 
This was, of course, a delight for the crowd of 43,601, the second-largest in Minnesota this year. 
"That was unbelievable. 
The loudest thing I've ever heard in my life," Gardenhire said. 
Slowey retired the first 13 batters he faced before Orlando Cabrera homered in the fourth, and the right-han­der should have been on the bench long before he was hurt. 
Gomez helped seal Wednesday's 3-2 win with a running catch in center of Pierzynski's drive for the sec­ond out in the ninth, but he overeagerly chased Jim Thome's one-out fly to the warning track Thursday and -failing to heed Span's call in right field -collided with his teammate as they both converged on the ball. 
Neither player could hear the other above the din, and given the outcome the Twins didn't seem to mind the aggressive mistake. 
"He thought I had a good bead on it. I thought I had a good bead on it. But some­times too much speed, that'll happen," Span said. 
Thome got a double, and Paul Konerko followed with an RBI groundout. Alexei Ramirez later hit a low chop­per to third baseman Brian Buscher, who charged and bobbled the ball when he tried the glove-to-hand trans­fer. The ruling was a single, and the Sox led 3-1 before they broke it open on Juan Uribe's smash that nearly broke Slowey's wrist. X-rays were negative. 
The Twins got two back in the bottom half on a two-out RBI triple by Gomez followed by a bloop double from Span. Gomez hit another triple in the sixth and scored on a sacrifice by Span, cutting the lead to 6-4. Guillen called for Thornton to get Joe Mauer, who's surging toward his sec­ond batting title in three years, to ground into a field­er's choice. 
That was all Gomez needed to see. 
"He said, 'If the bullpen can keep 'em at six, we're going to take this thing,"' Span said, "and he was right."

"What it looks like is they play to the level of their opponent," he said. 
The Cardinals lost a heart­br!1aker in double-overtime to No. 9 Texas three weeks ago before falling 3-2 to No. 12 Oklahoma State on Sept. 12. Their most recent contest was a 2-1 setbaek at Ohio State in overtime last Sunday. 
"They're coming ofT a tough loss to Ohio State," Waldrum said. "You almost wish they came in with a win so they weren't so hungry for a win." 
After the home game Friday night, the Irish will travel to take on another Big East oppo­nent in Cincinnati. 
Und1~r first-year coach Mkhel11~ Salmon, Cindnnati has boon inconsistent this season, alternating wins and losses en routo to a 4-4-0 record. 
Bock said the tough early­season stretch for the Bearcats mirrors the experience Notre Dame had last year. In 2007, the Irish struggled to a 3-4-1 record to open the season.

vulnerable; we were like that last year where every game you have to fight for it," she said. "We need to put the game away right away in the beginning. I Iopefully we can do that and it won't even be close at the end." 
Waldrum said the matchup with Cincinnati is a challenge partly because the Bearcats have a sub par playing field. 
"It's not an ideal facility, it actually has a big garage next to it and it's Astroturf," Waldrum said. "It's basically not the type of field that soccer should be played on." 
Waldrum compared the field to DePaul's complex. Last Friday the host Blue Demons, who are just 2-7-0, kept the game close and lost just 1-0 on a late goal to the Irish. 
Waldrum said the most important thing fqr the Irish this weekend is itot to take either Louisville or Cincinnati lightly. 
"Of course people on campus are talking about us being No. 1 and you see the '#1' sign [atop Grace Hall] lit up," he said. "But these girls have been through this enough to know that the ranking isn't winning the games for us. We still have to go out and win the games."

Although veteran juniors Doug Fortner and Carlos Santos-Ocampo had poor out­ings, three sophomores distin­guished themselves for the Irish. Tyler Hock played with consistency to lead the team in scoring, finishing five-over for the weekend, tied for 16th overall. Fellow sophomores Jeff Chen and Connor Alan-Lee also turned in respectable showings, illustrating the strength of the team's under­classmen. 
Kubinski considers the devel­opment of the younger players to be key for Notre Dame's suc­cess this season. 
"It's truly an thrilling time for our program," Kubinski said. 
"Notre Dame is stocked with very hard-working and talent­ed young players. We just need that breakthrough win. As long as we keep working and keep our goal in sight, it will come." 
The tournament begins Sunday morning at the Poppy Hills Golf Club at 8 a.m., with play concluding Tuesday after­noon.

Despitn their top ranking, the Irish said th11y do not feel any added pressure to remain unbeaten. 
''I'd say (the ranking! is always in tlw back of your mind because other teams see you and thnre's a target on your baek." senior eo-captain Brittany Bock said. "But for us, we always take it one game at a time and play nvery gamn like wn're 0-0-0." 
But Notrn Damn's record is in faet S-0-0 and eoaeh Handy Waldrum said his tnam is used to being thn tnam to beat.

"This is, without question, our hardest weekend of the season so far," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "We have two Big East games against two tough oppo­nents. It will definitely be a challenge and I hope we're up for it." 
Notre Dame has played its last five games at home after opening at the Adidas/IU Credit Union Classic in Bloomington, Ind. The Irish did not play the host Hoosiers in that tourna­ment, so both of Notre Dame's games there are considered to have been at a neutral site. 
Cincinnati is coming off a 2-1 loss to No. 4 Connecticut on Sept. 21 and has struggled to score goals so far this season, tallying just five through seven games. Sophomore Branden Stelmak is the only Bearcats player with more than one goal -he has two. 

That bodes well for an Irish defense that has dominated of late, shutting out a pair of Big East foes last weekend and giv­ing up just one goal over their last four games -all against Big East teams. 
Senior goalkeeper Andrew Quinn already has three shutouts in his first year as Notre Dame's full-time starter and has allowed just three goals over the last six games. 
Quinn hasn't been at it alone, though, as a pair of Irish defenders has already earned individual accolades this sea­son. 
Senior defender Matt Besler, a preseason All-American, earned a spot on the College Soccer News national team of the week and was named to the Big East honor roll two weeks ago. 
Freshman central defender Aaron Maund was named Big

like [Bock] who have handled this." 
Waldrum also said that simply playing under the shadow of the Golden Dome makes his players comfortable with the national spotlight on them. 
"I think that, just being Notre Dame, we're used to that," the coach said. "We're everyone's big game on their schedule and it's just this campus that does that." 
Tonight, Louisville will attempt to stop Notre Dame's unbeaten streak short of double digits. 
Last season when the two teams met, the visiting Irish eked out a 1-0 win. 
"With Louisville last year, we had a little bit of a difficult time ... " Bock said. "We just have to focus on coming in and playing aggressively. We need to respect them but at the same time play our game and take care of business." 
Despite its 3-3-1 record, Waldrum said Louisville is a dangerous squad because they

Irish begin Big East play 
Conference play to start with games against South Florida, Georgetown 
By JARED JEDICK Sporrs Writer 
Notre Dame is prepared to begin confon~neo play tonight and Sunday with two big matchups against South Florida and Georgetown. 
Conferen1:e play is like a 1ww start for tho Irish (5-7}, who have been hovering around .500 for most of the non-conferenee season. 
Despitn the heatnd nature of' playing against f'amiliar teams in the Big East and the games meaning more, Notre Dame's approach will stay the same.

Irish looking to rebound after tenth-place finish 
By MICHAEL BLASCO 
Sports Writer 
After a lOth-place finish at the USF Olympic Club Intercollegiate earlier this month, Notre Dame will try to get its season on track at the Saint Mary's Invitational this weekend. 
The Saint Mary's College (California)-hosted event will be held at the Poppy Hills Golf Club in Pebble Beach, Calif. 
Irish coach James Kubinski is not dwelling on his team's early struggles. 
''I'm honestly not disappoint­ed with the USF event," Kubinski said. "Like any team playing a first tournament or game, you're not sure what you have, or have to work on, until you start competing. Coaches will always tell you it takes a couple games to reduce the turnovers and get in 'game shape.' It's the same here." 
After outstanding summer seasons from several of its golfers and a roaring tour through Ireland early last month, Notre Dame had high hopes for its fall season opener at the USF Olympie Intercollegiate Invitational. However, the Irish were unable to recover from two disappoint­ing opening rounds, and fin­ished lOth in a field of 15. 
"We'll be fine," Kubinski said. "We needed an event. I think, in not playing as well as we can, yet putting up reasonable, if not great, scores, we proved we can

together 
after losses. 
So the 
question isn't really how good 
Purdue is or how good Notre 
Dame is. The question is how 
Notre Dame responds to its 
loss. 
After the 38-0 loss to Michigan last year, Irish eoach Charlie Wois said he started the season over. There's no need for that this year, but the team. both as individual units and as a whole, must regroup to have sueeess in the rest of the season. 
The offensive line could regress after Miehigan State nullified its effectiveness. It eould lose eonfidenee. Should that happen, the running game will once again fail to produce yardage. The offense will again become one-dimen­sional, foreing Jimmy Clausen to throw. lntnrceptions follow, and there goes the game. 
Or the offensive linemen could buckle down and play like they did in the first two games, when they didn't allow a sack and helped tho running backs rush for more than 100 yards. They're bigger, stronger and better than last yoar. and they know it. The only question is how this loss aiTocted them compared to last year. 
What about the running backs, the horsos who couldn't shed their reins against Miehigan State'? Will they bnlinve tho stat sheets' indica­tions of thoir utility to the team? 
Thny might. 
Or they could remember the holes they've hit and the touchdowns they've scored in tho first two games. They could force the del'ense into tho box and move the chains. This opens the finld for the play-adion pass, whieh Clausen showed he can throw wnll against Michigan. 
Clausen may let his intercep­tions gel to him. lie could have them in the back of his mind all game. forcing him to throw the ball away. Or he may remember his effective­ness in the four-and live-wide sets and eontimw to pass nfTeetively. With the live-wide set spreading the field, the 
defense follows suit, and here 
comes the run again. 
Michael Floyd could think 
about his fumble every time a 
ball comes his way. Or he 
could realize that he needs to 
movn on and learn from his 
mistakes. 
What's important to remem­
ber about tomorrow's game is 
the relative equality of the two 
teams. Both are 2-1. Nqtre 
Dame beat an injured San 
Diego State team and a 
Michigan team that gave it the 
ball six times. Purdue beat up 
on Northern Colorado and 
barely snuck past Central 
Michigan. Notre Dame lost to 
a Michigan State team that 
played better, and Purdue, 
who hasn't yet played on the 
road, lost in overtime to 
Oregon. 
Purdue quarterback Curtis Painter can still run the spread offense effectively, but he lost two of his primary weapons, speedy wide receiv­er Dorian Bryant and tight end Dustin Keller. Clausen has budding stars at receiver in Floyd and Golden Tate. Purdue running back Kory Sheets has a shade under 20 earries per game and averages 5.7 yards per carry. Notre Dame aver­ages 2.6 per carry. 
The game is, for all intents and purposes, a toss-up. One could make 10 arguments for both sides and wouldn't be able to declare a definitive ­winner. So it's up to the way both teams execute to deter­mine the game. No one can exeeute without having confi­dence in what they're doing. And to have confidence, Notre Dame needs to believe -actu­ally, to know -that last week was an aberration, a fluke, a one-time thing. 
The offensive linemen need to know they will flatten their opponents. The running backs need to know they have the ability to hit the holes, move the chains and score. Clausen needs to know he ean hit his receivers. 
And they do. This isn't like last year, where each loss sunk the team deeper and deeper into despair. This is this year, where the team has provnd it can produce on offense and halt production on defense. Michigan wasn't erunch time, and Michigan State wasn't crunch time. This is. Notre Dame has already proved it has moved on from last season. Now it needs to prove, by recovering from a loss, that the. transition is complete.

COACHING QUARTERBACKS 
Weis and his staff' made a good adjust­ments at halftime last week and-seem to have the team believing that a repeat of 2007 isn't going to happen. It will be interesting to sec how they handle this week's off-the-field activities.  
Joe Tiller announced at the beginning of this sea­son that this is his final go-round. Tiller has brought the Purdue pro­gram a long way since 1996 and can finish his career with a .500 record against the Irish with a win on Saturday.  


Clausen looked com­fortable in the five wide receiver set last week but made a few bad throws and question­able decisions that cost the Irish big time. lie needs to continue to spread the ball around and remain accurate on intermediate routes.  
Fifth-year senior Curtis Painter has the wisdom of a veteran and the confidence to do well after having his way with the Irish last sea­son in West Lafayette. lie's looked good so far this season but only has three passing touch­downs thus far.  

Both teams are cur­rently sitting at 2-1. Weis has revived the team slightly, but Tiller's tl,'oops w~rtt;OJ1e big play away from be~ng unde­feated and 'l!;w.rankcd. Whoever ean make the better adjustments as the game goes on will likely win.

PURDUE RUSHING 
The run defense has given up back-to-hack 100 yard rushing games to McGuffie and Hinger. They struggled to stop the run against Michigan's spread, which Purude also runs. It will be tough to shut down the ground game if they stay with a nickelback. 
Kory Sheets torched the lrL<;h for 140 yards and two touchdowns last year. The fifth-year senior is on the verge of breaking a slew of Purdue rushing records and has looked impressive as a workhorse back so far in his last year with the team.

PURDUE PASSING 
Despite their first game without an interception, the Irish secondary con­tinued to impress by locking down the Spartan receivers, for the most part. Sergio Brown and Gary Gray are both emerging as playmakers along with the rest of the veteran defensive backs. 
Curtis Painter brings plenty of experience and has been spreading the ball out well after losing his favorite target in Dorien Bryant last year. Tardy has filled in well and broke through with a big touchdown against Central Michigan last week.

Turkovich eases into left tackle position 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Managing Editor 
So far this season. Notre Dame's ofl'ensive line has givnn up three sacks, which is as many as it surrendered in the first quarter of last season. On major part of that is the pPrsonnel changes made in the trenches, espe­eially at left tackle. 
Senior Mike Turkovich took over the duty of protecting quarterback .Jimmy Clausen's blind side this season, replacing senior Paul Duncan. 
Turkovich played all of last season, starting every game at left guard, before making the transition in the spring. He said. the transition was a result of the rotation the offensive linemen did during training camp to find the best fit. 
"In the spring, we were rotating guys around and [offensive line) coach [John Latina] said, 'Could you go in at left tackle today?' And I was working with [the back­ups) because I was getting back in the rotation [after] an injury," Turkovich said. 
Turkovich said he felt com­fortable with the switch to the outside of the line right away. 
"I thought, 'Hey, this is your chance. Just play with reckless abandon.' You can't be thinking out there. Just do your job and do it fundamen­tally sound," he said. 
Latina said that the transi­tion from guard to tackle is a more difficult one than from tackle to guard because you are more isolated and. facing a different kind of rusher. Playing in what the coach called "a phone book amount of space," a guard is general­ly matched up against a large defensive tackle. But an offensive tackle has to block speedier defensive ends and linebackers one-on-one. 
One main reason Turkovich has been able to transition so easily is because he has played the position before. Ilis first two years at Notre Dame were spent as a tackle before he moved inside last season. Turkovich said he made the switch to guard because Latina said it would be his best fit. 
Turkovich also played tack­le in high school, but started 
his football  career as  a tight  
end.  
"In  high  school I  was  a  

tight end that ate himself into the tackle position," he said. "I weighed 215, 210 my junior year of high school, bulked up my senior year." 
"(urkovich also credited his teammates with easing his transition back to tackle, especially left guard Eric Olsen. 
"When you play next to a guy like Eric [Olsen], he's a good player and he makes it easier on you. You know he's going to do his job," Turkovich said. "You can trust him. Same thing with 
tight ends, you. can trust them. It's made the transi­tion easier." 
This season, Turkovich has been a solid p·erformer on the line, as evident by the fact that Clausen has yet to be hit from his blind side. And during l&st week's 23-7 loss to Michigan State when the line surrendered its only three sacks of the season, the Spartans blitzed when the Irish were in empty backfield formations, putting the offen­sive line at a disadvantage. 
Turkovich said the offen­sive line is better than it was last season, but still has room for improvement ­especially after netting only 16 yards rushing against the Spartans. 
"We can get better as far as the run game and get better with our fundamentals,." he said. " ... Last game they were getting pressure and getting sacks and we can't win if that happens." 
But even with the line's marked improvement this season, something Turkovich has been a major part of, he remains his own harshest critic. 
"Even if I make a block on a play, I'll still [thinking] I could have done better," the senior said. "I think that I've done good things, but there's definitely room for improve­ment still." 
Turkovich said the most important thing for him this year is to make sure he leaves Notre Dame on a high 


note. After last season's debacle for the linemen, he wants to make sure his last days in an Irish uniform are his best. 
"[There was] definitely was a sense of urgency [this sea­son]. I said to my family, 'This is my last year, I have to make an impression. I have to go out there and play my hardest because if you don't go out there and you don't play, it's going to be the end of your career,"' he said.

Irish look to slow down Purdue RB Sheets 

By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 
Last Saturday Purdue trailed Central Michigan 25-24 with just over a minute left of the clock. A loss would drop the Boilermakers to 1-2 with two consecutive losses. 
That's when they handed the ball to Kory Sheets. Sheets broke through the line, juked past a linebacker and ran the rest of the 46 yards to victory. 
"He definitely has some moves. I think we all saw that last week," Irish defensive coordinator Corwin Brown said. 
The juke, which was shown on virtually every sports high­light reel last weekend, left the Central Michigan linebacker scratching his head and looking for his jock strap. 
"Kory has done a heck of a job being the full-time guy," Irish head coach Charlie Weis said. "The guy's got good speed, he's got good quicks. He likes to run north and south, which is the sign of a good runner." 
Sheets has rushed for 352 yards and six touchdowns in three games this season. He averages about 20 carries a game,.but his biggest threat is the ability to change the game every time he touches the ball. 
Two weeks ago against then­No. 17 Oregon, Sheets took the second play of the game 80 yards to put his team up 7-0 right out of the gates. 
"If you give. him a hole he can hit it and he can take it all the way," Brown said. "He's been around, he's not a rookie." 
The fifth-year senior certainly isn't lacking in experience. 

Sheets ranks in the top ten in Purdue's history in attempts, yards per rush, all-purpose yards and rushing yards. He is also tied for second all-time with 37 career touchdowns. 
Even before getting to Purdue, Sheets was no stranger to the record books. He was named the Hartford Courant's Player of the Year in his final year at Bloomfield High School in Connecticut. He rushed for over 250 yards in a game four times his senior year including a 400-yard effort in three quar­ters of the state semifinal game. 
Sheets red-shirted his fresh­man year, but since then he has played 'in every single game in the past four years for the Boilermakers. 
Notre Dame has faced some impressive backs so far in 2008, but none have the experi­ence that Sheets brings to the table. 
"We're expecting to stop him as much as we can; he's a good athlete," senior defensive tackle Pat Kuntz said. 
In its past two games Notre Dame has struggled stopping the run, giving up 131 yards to Michigan's Sam McGuffie and 201 yards to Michigan State's Javon Ringer. The defense believes that they know how to keep Sheets from running wild this Saturday. 
"We just have to make tack­les," defensive end Justin Brown said. "If we make tack­les, sometimes they won't make those big plays." 
Making sure tackles has been easier said than done for the Irish against premier backs. There were 16 missed tackles against the Wolverines and 17 more last week in East Lansing. The team has spent a good deal of practice this week working on their technique. 
"I think we just have-to take what we've learned in the past two weeks and apply it on the field this time," said Irish safety and leading tackler Kyle McCarthy. 
Kuntz said that the best way to avoid missed tackles is to get as many gold helmets to the ball as possible. 
"Definitely wrapping up and gang tackling. It's going to take a lot of running to the football," he said. 
Last year in Purdue's 33-19 win over Notre Dame in West Lafayette, Ind., the defense had some problems getting Sheets to the ground. He racked up 141 yards and a touchdown on his 27 carries. 
Corwin Brown said Sheets is so dangerous because of the great balance that the Purdue offense shows. With fellow fifth­year senior Curtis Painter at quarterback, the Boilermakers are able to keep defenses guessing by spreading the ball around the field and then mak­ing sure Sheets gets the touches he needs. 
"First and foremost in our defense we have to stop the run. That's what we prepare for every week," McCarthy said. 
The Irish said they aren't out for revenge after giving up the 141 yards last season, but they could make a statement by playing a complete game on defense this week.
