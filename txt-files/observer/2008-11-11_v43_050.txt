Duncan wins construction award 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
Duncan llall was honored with an award of merit in Midwest Construction's "Best of 2008" com­petition in the residential/hospitali­ty category, the University announced Friday. 
Midwest Construction is a monthly magazine focused on the construction industry in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Eastern Missouri. It is one of 10 regional magazines published by McGraw­llill Construction. 
The University did not submit Duncan Hall for consideration for the award, according to University Vice President of Business Operations Jim Lyphout. 
"I and the University Architect [Doug Marsh] were pleasantly sur­prised to learn of the award," Lyphout said in an e-mail to The Observer Monday. 
"We are extremely pleased with Duncan Hall," Lyphout said. 
Duncan I fall shares the award of merit honor from Midwest Construction with Dana Hotel and Spa, which is located in Chicago. The project of the year distinction in the residential/hospitality catego­ry was awarded to One Museum Park East, the tallest residential structure in Chicago. 
An independent jury of experts judged the 128 considered projects on criteria including quality, project management, team work, and

Freshman Oass Council holds election 
Phelan, Kenney chosen by peers to serve as president, vice president for academic year 
By SARAH MERVOSH 
News Writer 
Notre Dame's Freshman Class Council (FCC) elected its officers last Thursday and is already working on its plans for the com­ing year. Malcolm Phelan, who was voted president, said the Council's main goals are to repre­sent the Class of 2012 and to build a sense of community with­in the class. 
"As we go forward we want us to be the class that people talk about years later, the class that just clicked," said Phelan. "We want to build that sense of family that keeps people coming back for years ... to build the incredibly 
sense of community that is so characteristic to Notre Dame He said the FCC was responsi­ble for the 

Halloween dance last month and has plans to sell t-shirts and make peanut but­ter and jelly sandwiches 
Phelan for home­
less shel­ters in the area. There is also talk of a possible dance in the spring and giving out free hot chocolate on the quad, said Phelan. 
Phelan was elected FCC presi­dent. Jay Kenney was voted vice president, Shannon Crotty treas­urer and Michael Ryan secretary. 
The election took place later than in past years because it took longer than usual to get repre­sentatives from each dorm, Sophomore Class Council vice president and advisor to FCC Kate Clitheroe said. 
Student government received special permission to extend the deadline of the election for this reason, she said. 
The officers were elected by their fellow FCC members, which consist of one representative from each dorm, Kenney said. Each candidate gave a short speech, and following the speeches, those running left the room and those not running voted, he said.

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 
Group talks modifying Transfer-0 
By AARON STEINER News Writer 
The Campus Life Council (CLC) discussed their ideas and sug­gestions for modifying the Transfer-0 Program at Notre Dame during their meeting Monday, with a task force chair stating the orientation needs to give more attention to student life, in addition to academic life. 
Meg MacCaughey, SUB repre­sentative and chair of the Task Force on New Student Introduction to Notre Dame, said her group has met with Catherine Linn, an admissions counselor who works with Transfer-0. 
Currently, the Office of Admissions runs Transfer-0, and the program reflects an academ­ic focus. 
"Admissions really accentuates the academic transition, and it doesn't give that much attention to student life," MacCaughey said. While Frosh-0 emphasizes the transition to dorm life and introduces students to clubs and events on campus, Transfer-0, under the umbrella of admis­sions, lacks that perspective. 
In addition, MacCaughey said the committee of students that organizes Transfer-0 is com­posed only of students who have transferred to the University in the past. 
"There are no dorm represen­

College notified of Sisters' passings 
By MANDl STIRONE Assistant News Editor 
Saint Mary's students were sent an e-mail Thursday, informing them that a Sister of the Holy Cross, who had 

been residing in the  on-cam­ 
pus  Convent,  had  passed  
away on Nov. 4.  

The e-mail, sent by Michelle Vasquez, secretary to Sister Rose Anne Schultz, vice presi­dent for Missions, invited stu­dents to attend the funeral Mass and burial on Friday and included a link to a biog­raphy of Sister Margaret Mary Duggan available on the Mission Web site. 
The Mission section of the Saint Mary's Web site has a list of biographies of deceased Sisters of the Holy Cross beginning with Sister Agnes Eileen Walshe who passed away on Jan. 7, 2007. 
The list, entitled "In Memoriam," began in 2007, but the department of Missions has been keeping these records long before then, Sister Schultz said. 
The Department began mass e-mailing students as a result of several people com­ing to Sister Schultz and ask­ing why they weren't being informed of the Sisters' deaths, she said.

Don't knock 

YouTube 
Are you guys fans of viral video? Are you snasonnd YouTube aficionados? SeekBrs of the next big thing in that pop­ular gBnrn known as "the ridiculous video of the w«wk that everyone and tJwir mom arn watehing?' 
As tho Sennn Editor of this fine paper, I 
like to engagn with  
you, fdlow fans of  Analise Lipari  
Internet phenome­ 
na. with our quasi- 
weekly  YouTube  Scene Editor  
features  that  we  
post in the Scene  

spread. We'll put together an amalga­mation of quirky. ridiculous or punny videos fi1r your benefit (and, to be hon­est, ours). The content can vary depend­ing on whkh member of my staff is edit­ing that night. Some of my favorites have bBen "Biz's Beat of the Day," a clip from tim kids' show "Yo Gabba Gabba" in whkh Biz Markie instructs your chil­d ron on tho finn art of beat boxing; "Snorlax Owns," a curse-laden discus­sion of the nwril'i of various Pokemon, particularly of the chubby and sleepy varinty; and thn well-known and oll­quotml "My Nnw llaireut." 
SornBtimes thll YouTube f(mtures arn influenced by working in the Observer Ollice iL'ielf. For example, if I'm working with our lovnly Managing Editor, Jay Fitzpatrick, my video choices tend to lean towards the more absurd side of life. You can thank Mr. Fitzpatrick for our indusion of "Barack Holl," by the way. For those unfortunate souls who still haven't seen this little gem. "Barack l!oll" is an exercise in video splicing taken to tho point of 1-don't-know-what. Clips of Barack Obama's speeches are cut to preeisely fit the lyrics of Rick i\st.lny's "Never Gonna Give You Up," otliJctively allowing the president-elect to Hiek-Holl the nation via Youtube. Note: There's also a response video in which Senator McCain, speaking at the Hepublican National Convention and cm1ing a video, gets Barack Rolled by the aetual "Barack Holl'' vidoo. 
Intelligent stuff. I know. But, to all you intellectual snobs out there, those who think Youtube video viewing is a pedes­trian past time -don't knock it till you've triPd it. 
It's easy to think that someone like me or you, young, college-going people who enjoy a fa~~ade of intellectualism, would spend their time with high art and museums. And granted, I like those things, as I'm sure you do, too. (Don't worry, I won't tell anyone about the hours you spend watching "Rock of Love: Charm School" on Vhl. Oh, wait. Oops.) 
But whPn it comes to easy entertain­ment, I'm loving the democratization of video that you find on the internet. Where olso ean that Star Wars Kid from Canada find instant fame? Or what eould amount to marathon viewings of that "Charlie bit me!" video with those British kids? Classic. 
Sure, there's a danger in spending all of' your time on a laptop, instead of' engaging with thP outside world. But if staying inside one more time means I get to wateh a dip of Joel McHale's ver­sion of Britney Spears' "Womanizer" on repeat. I'm on it.

Big purse stops bullet from hitting student 
MURFREESBORO, Tenn. -Don't knock those trendy, oversized purses ­they could save your life, as one college student found out. Police say the contents in an oversized purse saved Elizabeth Pittenger, a 22-year-old Middle Tennessee State University student, by stop­ping a bullet during an attempted robbery. 
Pittenger was walking to her car on campus Thursday evening when a man confronted her and demanded her purse, cell phone and laptop, universi­ty Police Chief Buddy Peaster said. She fought the man off, but he fired a gunshot before fleeing. 
The bullet was found inside the purse, along with a calculator, umbrella and small case that had been punctured. Pittenger was not injured.

Saint Mary's to cotntnetnorate Kristallnacht anniversary 
Event organizers seek to remember the Holocaust and speak out against human rights abuses in Daifur, Burma, and the Congo 
By MEGAN LONEY 
News Writer 
This week. Saint Mary's chapter of the White Rose Society is commemorating the 70th anniversary of Kristal1nacht, when over 20,000 men were sent to concentration camps. Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass, is known as the event that marked the beginning of the Holocaust. 
The Saint Mary's White Rose Society is the second chapter of this group in the United States -the first is at the University of Texas­Austin. Senior Sarah Testa, president of the White Rose Society chapter at Saint Mary's, discovered the group in a class her junior year. 
"I took a class on the Second World War where the White Hose was briefly men­tioned in conjunction with other resistance groups," Testa said. "The name struck me so I looked it up and I found out there was an incredible story few knew about." 
After learning that the University of Texas-Austin had a student-run White Rose Society, Testa contacted them to receive information about the group. Although Testa worked on the idea her junior year, the chapter was 
not formally recognized until the beginning of this school year, said Testa. 
"Currently, there are 60 official members in the chap­ter," Testa said, "but people are always expressing inter­est in joining. There are a lot of first years and sopho­mores involved in the chap-t e r , which

Iraq suffers deadliest attack in weeks 
BAGHDAD -A suicide bomber Monday struck a crowd rushing to help schoolgirls trapped in a bus by an earlier bombing. The Interior Ministry said at least 31 people were killed -the deadliest in a string of blasts that raise doubts about Iraqi security forces as the

The ministry said another 71 people were wounded in the twin blast'i, the deadliest attack in Baghdad in six weeks. A third bomb exploded about 130 yards (meters) from the scene in the mostly Shiite Kasrah section of north Baghdad but eaused no casualties, police said. 
No group daimed responsibility for the attacks during the morning rush hour. But suspicion fell on al-Qaida in Iraq, which has made suicide bombings against Shiite civilians its signature attack. 
In rneent weeks. there has been an uptick in small-seale bombings in Baghdad. An Associated Pmss tally showed at least 19 bombings in the city this month as of Sunday, compared with 28 for all of Oetober and 22 in September.

Even though Patrick O'Donnell doesn't have the money he agreed to pay, a lawyer for some two dozen victims says getting the former priest to own up to his actions will help them put the abuse behind them. 
"I think we achieved our goal, which was to get a judgment and hopefully we can deprive him of as many assets as we can," the victims' lawyer. Timothy Kosnoff, said Monday.

Obama vists Bush in White House 
Obama, Bush and their wives take part in traditional tour, begin transfer ofpower 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-All smiles and compliments, President­elect Obama and his wife, Michelle, called on President Bush and first lady Laura Bush Monday in a White House visit that was part political ritual, part practical introduction and a striking symbol of the historic trans­fer of power to come. 
The president and Obama talked war and financial cri­sis. Laura Bush and Michelle Obama talked about raising daughters in the nation's most famous house. 
Then Obama flew back to Chicago to work on setting up the new administration that will take over on Jan. 20. 
Mrs. Obama went out hunt­ing a new school for the kids, visiting two of the capital city's best-known private schools. 
If flrst impressions matter, Obama and his wife dis­played one similarity to the super-punctual Bushes, pulling up to the White Ilouse's South Portico 11 minutes early. The couples traded warm and easy greet­ings in the crisp autumn sun­shine, with the wives exchanging pleasantries about the fall hues each wore -Mrs. Bush in a brown dress and Mrs. Obama in a red one.

Harvard considering cuttting spending 
Economy hurting University's endowment

BOSTON II arvard University is considnring s p n n d i n g 1: u ts bn c au s c th e <H~ o n o m i <: s Io wd o wn m a y n~duen fndnral grants and thn school's substantial endow­mont, l'residnnt l>rtlW Faust said Monday.

Still. Faust warnod in an o­mail to faculty, staff and stu­dnnts that "wn must recog­nize that Harvard is not invulnnrable to tho seismic linaneial shocks in the larger world. Our own economic landscape has been signil'i­eanlly allll red." 
"Wn need to b<l prepared to absorb unprecedented nndowrnnnt losses and plan for a period of greater linan­eial restraint," she said. 
Harvard's is the nation's largest university endowment and provides about a third of thn annual operating budget. Faust said the school is look­ing at ways to cut spending and will review compensation costs, which account for near­ly half of the budget. 
Harvard also is reviewing its ambitious nxpansion pro­gram. including plans announced early last year to nxpand across thn Charlns Hiver from its Cambridge cam pus into Alison, she said. 
"WP will Iwnd to plan and act in ways that reflect that rnality, lo assurn that we con­linucl lo advance our priori­lies for tnaching, rnsnarch and sPrvi<:c~ ... slw said. 
The school intends to imple­ment initiatives to make edu­cation affordable to students from low-and middle-income families, and will ensure that those with incomo below $60,000 will pay nothing to send children to Harvard College. Those earning up to $180,000 can expect to pay no more than about 10 per­cent of their income, she said. 
Graduatn and professional schools will keep financial aid budgets at current levels. 
Harvard's efforts to address tlw economic downturn mir­ror what is happening else­where in the country, includ­ing other Ivy League schools. Whiln wnalthy schools can fare better in a downturn, they are also seen as vulnera­ble to prolonged market slumps because they tend to fund a greater portion of their budget from their endowment. 
Dartmouth College has announcnd that it will cut spending after its endow­ment, which also makes up about a third of its budget, lost $220 million. That school's trustees blamed the loss on poor returns on stocks and bonds because of the Wall Street meltdown. 
Last week, Brown University announced a hiring freeze through January, and said it would review its capi­tal budget to determine which projects could be delayed. Cornell University also recently announced a 90-day halt of construction projects and a pause on hiring staff members from outside the university through the end of March. 
"Virtually every college and university, their budgets are undnr strain, stress, for a variety of reasons." said Matthnw Hamill, a vice presi­dent of the National Association of College and Business University Officers.

WHY CHOOSE A MINOR OR A SUPPLEMENTARY MAJOR IN LATINO STUDIES AT ND? 
Changes in American demography make it imperative for professionals and leaders, in all fields, to understand the politics, economics, and cultures of the US Latino/Hispanic community. Health professionals, for example, are already implementing programs tailored to the needs ofUS Latinos/Hispanics; the private sector is recognizing their growing purchasing power; and policymakers and political leaders have come to realize that Latinos/Hispanics may play a decisive role in the US electoral vote. 
The minor or the supplementary major in Latino studies will deepen stu­dents' knowledge ofthe cultures, art, history, literature, religious life, politi­cal expression, and public policy issues ofnearly 40 million Latinos/Hispanics in the United States. 
The programs encourage research into new issues such as changing immigra­tion patterns, remittances, emerging transnational communities, and cultural flows between Latinos/Hispanics in the United States and their families' countries oforigin. 
While the emphasis is on domestic communities, consideration ofglobaliza­tion, immigration, and border issues introduces an international dimension.

DHL cuts 9,500 American jobs 
ATLANTA -Delivery company DHL, hit by heavy losses and fierce competition, is signifi­cantly reducing its air and ground operations in the U.S. and cutting 9,500 American jobs, leaving rivals like FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service to fight over the customers it will stop serving. 
The decision announced Monday could lead to higher shipping prices and greatly scale back a possible venture between UPS and DHL, the fourth-largest shipper of packages in the U.S. 
Deutsche Post AG, the German parent of DHL, said it will no longer offer U.S. domestic­only air and ground services as of Jan. 30, though it said international shipping to and from the U.S. would continue. 
DHL has tried to be a major player in the 
U.S. since it bought Airborne Inc.'s ground delivery network for $1.05 billion in 2003, but it has lagged in the air and ground mar­kets combined, analysts said. 
Club for ultra-rich files bankruptcy 
BILLINGS, Mont. -The Yellowstone Club, an exclusive mountain retreat for the ultra­rich, said it filed for bankruptcy Monday after failing to secure new financing ­underscoring that even the elite can't escape the country's current economic trou­bles. 
Spokesman Bill Keegan said the club filed for Chapter 11 protection in federal bank­ruptcy court in Montana. The move came just two months after the club announced an ambitious expansion plan through a part­nership with the Arizona-based Discovery Land Company. 
The gated, millionaires-only club on 13,400 acres in Montana's Gallatin Mountains boasts a private ski hill and golf course. Opened in 1999, it counts former Vice President Dan Quayle and Microsoft co­founder Bill Gates among its 340 members. 
In a statement to The Associated Press, the club said it had been unable to secure financing arrangements with its creditors and bondholders. It plans to reorganize its finances and emerge from bankruptcy "as soon as possible," the statement said. 

Peds' bailout for AIG grows to $150B 
Insurance company loan reaches record high for private company 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -When the government offered an emergency loan to insurer American International Group in September, eyebrows shot up at the $85 billion price tag. Now it looks like pocket change. 
The size of the AIG lifeline swelled to more than $150 billion on Monday, a record for a private company. But the head of the broader financial rescue package was cool to other compa­nies reaching for a piece of the bailout pie. 
The new AIG package includes a $40 billion chunk of the $700 billion financial bailout. It's the first time money from the big rescue bill has gone to any company other than a bank. 
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, burning through cash and bleed­ing jobs, are prodding the government for more help. The leaders of the House and Senate have urged Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to get some of the $700 billion to the Big Three.

Circuit City files for bankruptcy 
Associated Press 

RICHMOND, Va. -Facing pres­sure from vendors and consumers who aren't spending, Circuit City Stores Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection Monday as it heads into the busy holiday season with hopes that the move will help it survive. 
Under Chapter 11 protection, the nation's second-biggest electronics retailer can keep operating while it develops a reorganization plan. Its Canadian operations also filed for similar protection. 
The company also said it cut 700 more jobs at its Richmond, Va., headquarters, after announcing a week ago that it would close 20 percent of its stores and lay off thousands of workers. 
In court documents, Chief 
Financial Officer Bruce H. Besanko cited three factors: erosion of ven­dor confidence, decreased liquidity and the global economic crisis. 
"Without immediate relief, the company is concerned that it will not receive goods for Black Friday and the upcoming holiday season, which could cause irreparable harm to the company and its stakeholders," Besanko said in the filing. 
Its shares fell 14 cents, or about 56 percent, to 11 cents on Monday before being halted. 
Circuit City, which has had only one profitable quarter in the past year, has faced significant declines in traffic and heightened competi­tion from rival Best Buy Co. and others. The company laid off about 3,400 retail employees last year and replaced them with lower-paid workers, a move analysts said could backfire, hurting morale and driving away customers. 
While the retail industry overall is facing what's expected to be the weakest holiday season in decades, Circuit City's struggles have intensified as nervous con­sumers spend less and credit has become tighter. 
At a hearing in Richmond, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Huennekens granted Circuit City interim approval to secure $1.1 billion in debtor-in-possession loans while it is in bankruptcy pro­tection. Those funds, needed to stock merchandise and pay employees, replace a $1.3 billion asset-backed loan the company had been using.

With hyper-liberal Senator Barack Obama ascending to the presidency, in conjunction with a ncar filibuster-proof majority in the Senate and a dear majori­ty in the House, Democrats can now rel­ish in a vietory that affirms the princi­ples they hold most dear: bigger gov­ernment, spineless foreign policy, and increased spending on inell'ective soeial programs. 
In the deeply pro­found words of Bob the Builder, "Yes we can!" 
Or can they'? 

In the back of their collective mind, there rnmains the stub­born fad that Obama managed to dinch the election on November 4th largely by riding a wave of personal popularity and widespread rnsentment toward the previ­ous administration. lie campaigned, not as a Dmno1:rat, but as a symbol of a new, bipartisan era that transcends the petty political bickering of the past. And although his electoral and popular vote victories were decisive, thn question of what his election means for the dimetion of his prnsidnncy has yet to be answered. 
If we attempt to look to Obama's cam­paign for some dues, we are left just as mystified. His call to arms can be summed up in a single word: change. But let's face it, when vying for the presidency wlwn the approval rating of the outgoing incumbent from the opposite party has flat-lined around 28 percent, the cam­paign script was practically written lor him. All any Democratic nominee had to do was avoid any fatal missteps and the election would be h>if't-wrapped and deliv­ered directly into his or her hands. 
Add a touch of inspirational narrative, a pinch of promisns to transcend partisan bieknring, and a dash of moving rhetoric about hope, and you've got a reeipe for a messianic leader, complete with a loyal 

EDITORIAL CARTOON 
following of hero-worshippers and a press that caters to his every whim. 
But the term "change" does not imply any concrete policy initiatives or solutions to the problems our nation now faces. When Obama declares, "the change we need is coming," what he has in mind may not coincide with what many in this country bnlieve should be done. His cam­pai~:,rn was built upon a message that res­onated with voters precisely because it was so vague. 
The truth remains that the majority of Americans arn not on the same page as Obama when it comes to governing phi­losophy. This fact becomes evident when one looks back to some of his own cam­paign rhetoric, whieh seems at times to embrace much of the traditional Hepublican Party platform. For example. instnad of standing behind his preferred Marxist aspirations of "spreading the wealth around," he chose to market his income redistribution program as a "tax cut." Don't believe me? Then try explain­ing how he plans to cut taxes for 95% of working families when a third of them don't pay income taxes, yet will receive a government check if his plan is imple­mented. 
lie also insists that he will go through the federal budget "line by line" and eliminate every inefl'ective program to cut sponding (considering the fact that appro­priations bills contain tens of thousands of pages. this would be an enormous feat in and of itsell). Balanced budgets have traditionally been associated with fiscal conservatism, a philosophy that Obama, who sponsored or cosponsored 144 bills that would have increased federal spend­ing by $75 billion annually and proposed $292.954 billion in new spending during the campaign, hardly favors. Unless he deems national defense, the only policy area in which Obama seems to support spending cuts. an ineffective program that should be abolished, he is going to have a very ditlicult time achieving the "net spending cuts" he promised to achieve during the third debate. 
Now I understand that Obama is no conservative; in fact, according to the National Journal's 27th annual vote rat­ings, Obama was hands-down the most liberal member of thn Senate in 2007. But the language he has used to pander to voters indicates the necessity of appealing to their center-right tenden­cies. 
Perhaps in addition to acquiring more votes, Obama was hoping to gain favor with conservatives so that they will go along with his leftist agnnda as president. lie has already begun to set the biparti­san tone for his administration during his victory speech by insisting that we "resist the tnmptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturi­ty that has poisoned our politics for so long." Just days later, he appointed Hahm Emanuel; former Clinton advisor, Freddie Mae board member lrom 2000 to 2001, and notoriously foul-mouthed partisan hack; to the position of chief of staff. 
A wide gap exists betwflen Obama's claims to champion bipartisanship and his actions. Unfortunately, he has con­vinced most Americans that he will lead in a manm1r that transcends the partisan divide, which dons not give him the authority to implement thn radkal agen­da he managed to de-emphasize during the campaign. It snems that his definition of bipartisan involves building support for libnral polides among moderates instead of trying to compromise with the oppos­ing party by presenting his plans with a deceptive twist. 
I Iistory has not been kind to presidenl'i who overstep their authority. If Obama interprets his win as an overwhelming mandate for liberalism and aggressively attempts to reconstruct the govnrnment in this manner, he risks losing much of his popular support, along with any chance to make the change he promised a reality.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Tropic Thunder: not so funny 
The summer before my freshman year here at Notre Dame, I volunteered at the Special Olympics Games. I helped in the skills division of tennis. One particular athlete, Ben, was vnry excited to go first. He came out on the court, and I asked him if he needed any practice rounds. Ben confidently replied, "No, I'm ready!" Ben completed his challenges and was pro tty good at all of them. I complimented him on his skill and he proudly responded, " I know I'm good, I'm PERFECT!" Truer words have never been spoken. Ben had Down syn­drome. 
This past week SUB movies hosted the film, Tropic Thunder. This film repeatedly degrades 
'those with disabilities. Men and women with disabilities are the greatest gift God has given to our world. They are full of pure, unconditional, perfect love. My sister, Marita, has physi­cal and mental handicaps. While some students here at Notre Dame struggle with trying to make the division one sports team. Marita struggles with walking. While students here struggle with Aristotle's philosophy, Marita struggles with learning how to read. While stu­dents hen~ struggle with relationships and learning how to love one another-well Marita's got that one covered. Marita never gives up-not only can she walk, but she can run and play sports too. Not only can she read, but she writes her own stories and spells a whole lot better than I do. Not only does she love, but she loves unconditionally, unselfishly, and unre­servedly. She sees people for who they are, not for what they look like or what they wear or how smart or athletic they are. She simply loves the person. Marita never makes fun of any­one -but each day when I walk around campus, I hear people using the word "retarded" with a negative connotation. 
I see our beloved Notre Dame sponsoring a film, Tropic Thunder, that openly degrades those with disabilities. If a movie openly made fun of Jewish people or black people or women we wouldn't show it--it would be deemed as offensive. So why, when a movie openly makes fun of those with disabilities, is it deemed as funny? It's not funny-it's hurtful. It's degrading a group of people who should be praised and commended by society-not made fun of. This is a Catholic university named after our Blessed Mother-and right now, I'm pretty sure she is ashamed of us.

Drunken revelry justified by 1 Change and Hope' 
Last week seemed to be the pinnacle of my existence as an American when I learned from thousands of miles away that Barack Obama was to become my future president. I became overwhelmed and on the verge of tears while observing the millions of people cheering for our nation's soon to be first African-American president. Although I was watching from a computer all the way from Yanji, a small Chinese city conveniently sand­wiched between Russia and North Korea, and had only two other Americans to share this historical occasion with, my overwhelming happiness could not escape me for several days. 
Unfortunately, my elation came to a screeching halt upon learning of the view­point article titled "Drunken Revelry Inappropriate." Does this student realize what had just happen in our beloved nation last Tuesday? A smart, intelligent man who happens to be black was able to obtain arguably the most powerful position in the world only several decades after African­Americans were not even allowed to vote. Amidst this. all Mr. Miller can do is worry about his studies?! 
Yes it is unfortunate that people's bikes were thrown on trees just as they are throughout the school year, and that the elec­tion celebration distracted the handful of focused students just as dorm parties distract the dozens of students who choose to sleep or study on a Friday or Saturday night. I am sure every football weekend, students "run amuck and shout banter" at the top of their lungs in a "drunken frenzy" throughout cam­pus when our football team claims victory. Furthermore, it is tradition for NO male stu­dents to gallivant their nude bodies around campus before finals in anticipation of the end of the semester which I am sure causes small riots here and there amongst excited young ladies. 
Thus, may I remind Mr. Miller that a presi­dential election happens only every four years and never before has a person of color in our country accomplished such a feat. I have to admit that I once was an uptight pre­med student who would occasionally get annoyed at the random distractions and out­bursts that would echo the walls of the CoMo lounge. But I knew when to soften up and allow chaos to disrupt my studies such as when the first huge snowfall of the school year occurs or during March Madness when the huge big screen TVs cause havoc among the hardcore college basketball fans amidst the clueless, studious students. 
Maybe Mr. Miller was a stringent McCain supporter, or maybe a hardcore conservative, wealthy Republican, or simply does not know how to have fun and loosen up when neces­sary. Maybe he should have gone back to his home off-campus to focus on his studies which seems to be way more important than this historic election. Although, I am sure the people of South Bend took to the streets as well, like the rest of the world did. Who knows? But in the words of Obama, I can only HOPE that his uptight ways CHANGE in order for him to realize the joy of being a col­lege student and a proud American under the future guidance of Barack Obama.

Take a step back 
We all know that Thanksgiving is just around the corner. I love this day. What are the first thoughts that this holiday brings to mind? Food, obviously. Gathering with family, playing football with the cousins, cooking classic dishes, and discussing religion and politics are just a few of the day's activities. At some point, however, I do sit back and thank God for all He has given me (and I should be doing this more often). Family, friends, faith, freedom; education, health, and the list goes on and on. But there is one especially prized gift that God has given my family: two incredible people with special needs. 
My brother Patrick has Asberger's Syndrome, a high functioning form of Autism. My sister Meg has Acondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. These two people may be the greatest blessings in my life. And that's why it hurts so much when I hear daily the words "retarded" and "midget" thrown around. It hurts because I have lived through the suffering they have endured from this reckless or malicious use of language. I suspect that we all react similarly when someone mocks or demeans one of our siblings-for any reason. I think that most, if not all, of us immediately become defensive and want to support our siblings. At least that's how I respond every time I hear those words used in disparaging or nega­tive contexts. 
I am so grateful for Pat and Meg in my life . .I wish everyone could have the gift of someone with special needs in their family life. Those with special needs have a deep, genuine love of life. They may lark intellectual or physical capabilities, but their abilities to love and to forgive are admirable. They are much younger than I am. but I sincere­ly look up to each of them. So, I invite all of us to take a step back, thank God for all He has given us and reflect upon ways we may misuse words and submit to stereotypes that really do inflict great harm to those with special needs and to their Creator. Thanks Pat and Meg for being who you two are.

The real Atnerican spirit 
After living through an exhausting presidential campaign and all the good and the ugly connected with it, I just wanted to comment on a bright spot. As an "old grad" who loves Notre Dame and is interested in the current state of the union and opinions on campus, I must say that Nicole Burson's letter on "America the Beautiful" in the November 10 "The Observer Email Edition" re-affirms my hope and shows the real spirit of America shining through. This country was founded upon a deep faith in God and trust in His guidance and blessings. Congratulation, Nicole, as you have beautifully expressed the greatness of our democracy and the responsibility of all Americans to continue in a positive way to support our country, affirm the sacredness of human life, and pray for the well-being of this great nation.

KAITLYN CONWAY 

Scene Writer Opening with the edgy, steady guitar rhythm of "The Resistance," alternative rock band Anberlin's newest album, "New Surrender" is a fresh affirmation of the band's talent. Anberlin has released five albums (if you include their CD of B-sides, demos, and acoustics, "Lost Songs," in the count) since their conception in 2002. and each one has offered something new to their sound. And each album has been tout­ed as better than the last. "New Surrender" is the first album by the band to be released with a major record company. But this did not con­cern fans. Anberlin has consis­tently stayed within their genre while noticeably altering their sound. The band is not afraid of experimenting, and does so with skill. In faet, each track on "New Surrender" displays a different aspect of their sound, while maintaining some of their clas­sic touches. The end track, "Miserabile Visu (Ex Malo Bonum)" is in the vein of their other ending tracks, like "(*Fin)," which concluded their last CD. "Cities." As with the band's past final tracks, "Miserabile Visu (Ex Malo Bonum)" is the longest track on the album and adds a nice sense of closure to the work as a whole. Additionally, the pop bal­lad "Breathe" is similar to their well-known track "Dismantle. llepair." llowever, the track has its own new sound as well. Whiln the CD opens with force with "Tlw Hesistance," Anberlin quickly displays their diversity with a ballad. "Breaking," which asserts that "You make breaking hearts look so easy," a repetitive line that you will find yourself humming as you walk down the hall. This is part of the beauty of Anberlin. No matter what their songs are about, they 
are catchy and easy to follow. "Blame Me! Blame Me!" is a sad yet impossible to hate song on the album. Immediately after listening to it, it will be impossi­ble not to chime in: "Blame me! Blame me!" Another song which is bound to hit the airwaves is "Haight Street," which fulfills the album's need for a song about leaving it all behind and doing something different and new. 
The songs on the album aren't just your usual drivel of heart­break and freedom, though. The band has specifically written the songs about humanitarian effort<; they have participated in. asserting the fact in "Burn Out Brighter (Northern Lights)" that "This life's not about me" and "I want to die for something." Anberlin is using their music to advocate for something larger ··· than the little problems of life.·. There's more out there than the everyday problems, and "New Surrender" is Anberlin's way of telling that to the world. 
Another notable track is."Feel Good Drag," a rewrite from their second CD "Never Take Friendship Personal" (released in 2005). The mellow rock song alternates in intensity, starting soft and intensifYing in the cho­rus. Alone in this one song. Anberlin displays their array of talent, both in terms of vocals and musicianship. 
"New Surrender" can be called nothing but a success. Anberlin has once again created an amazing, diverse album that anyone can enjoy. This band is talented, and they're not afraid to show it. Stephen Christian has the vocals to carry the songs, and is backed up strongly instrumentally by band mates Deon Rexroat, Joseph Milligan, Nathan Young, and Christian McAlhaney. This band talent only continues to please fans in their most recent release.

SAOlAMENTO, Cali£ -Star outfielder Matt Holliday appears headed 1n the Oakland A1hle1irs in a surprising move for a fran­chi<;e known more for shedding s1ars than adding them. 
Two people finniliar with the proprn'.CI deal said Monday the 1\.s and the Colorado Rockies have reached a tentative agree­ment. Both people spoke on condition of anonymily because the trade had not been finalized and details were still in the works. 
It was unclear whom Colorado would get for the two­time All-Star. One of the people said reliever Huston Street, letcy starter Greg Smith and outfield­er Carlos Gowlllez were among the players who had been dis­cussed in recent days. 
Holliday, MVP of the 2007 NL championship series, is due to make $13.5 million next season and then will be eligible to become a free agent

The tentative trade was earli­er reported by Sl.com and ESPN.com. 
''Talks are continuing. They're very fluid and at this point, everything's speculation," Rockies spokesman Jay Alves said, speaking on behalf of gen­eral manager Dan O'Dowd. 
Oakland owner Lew Wolff, attending a regional luncheon of Associated Press Sports Editors, wouldn't confirm or deny a trade but said he had already spoken with general manager Billy Beane three times on Monday. 
"Billy's doing different things right now," Wolffsaid.

IN BRIEF Pats' Thomas P.Ossibly out 
for season with broken arm 
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -Adalius Thomas is the latest Patriots starter who might miss time after the line­backer suffered what could be a long­term arm injury. 
Thomas didn't return after leaving the Patriots 20-10 win over the Buffalo Bills midway through the second quar­ter Sunday. The Patriots said only that he hurt his arm, but ESPN.com, quot­ing unnamed sources, reported Thomas broke his left forearm and "likely" will miss the rest of the season. 
Team spokesman Stacey James said Monday the next injury update would come after Tuesday's practice. A spokesman for Thomas' agent, James "Bus" Cook Jr., said the player had not returned a phone call to Cook. 
"I think it'll be difficult" to replace Thoma'>, said Mike Vrabel, the team's other starting outside linebacker. "He was a leader. He was a veteran guy that played well and we'll just have to find guys to step up." 
Woman files lawsuit against 
Chiefs' Johnson over bar spat 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -A Kansas woman filed a lawsuit Monday against Chiefs running back Larry Johnson a month after claiming he spit a drink in her face at a bar and threatened to kill her and her boyfriend. 
The lawsuit, filed by 24-year-old A'ihley 
N. Stewart, accuses the two-time Pro Bowler of negligence, a'>Sault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional di<;tress and negligent infliction of emotional dis­tress. 
Kevin E.J. Regan, an attorney for Johnson, called the allegations "prepos­terous." 
"Tilis appears to be a cla'i'iic incident of someone trying to use the court system to get something for nothing," Regan said. 
The lawsuit, filed in Jackson County Circuit Court, seeks punitive damages, attorney fees and any other amount a jury deems to be fair. Johnson was eharged last month with simple assault for the incident that occurred Oct. 10 at Kansas City's Oub Blonde.

Longoria, Soto win Rookie of Year 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -The rookie races were all but over by July, when Evan Longoria and Geovany Soto gave an All­Star glimpse of things to eo mo. 
Longoria won the American League Hookie of tho Year award in a unanimous vote and Soto ran away with the NJ. honor Monday, capping impressive seasons that ineluded All-Star appear­ances for both players at Yankee Stadium. 
Pretty rare stuff for a pair of first-timers -but these were no ordinary freshmen. 
"I had a great year, bar none," Longoria said. "I know I have the ability to do more." 
Following a season of brnakthroughs for the AI. champion Hays, Longoria became the first Tampa Bay player to win a national award from the Baseball Writers' Association of America. The power-hitting third baseman roceived all 28 

The Hays were so sure Longoria would become a big star that they gave him a $17.5 million, six-year con­tract after only six major league games. The deal could be worth up to $44.5 million over nine seasons. 
So far. he's delivered. 

Tampa Bay started play in 1998 and had never won more than 70 games until Longoria helped lead the Hays to 97 wins this year and the AL East title. lie also hit a tying double with two outs in the eighth inning during the July 15 All-Star game in New York. 
Soto became the first National League rookie catch­er to start an All-Star game. In addition to his productive hitting all season, he did a nice job handling a Cubs pitching staff that com piled a 
3.87 EHA, third-best in the NL. He even caught a no-hit­ter by Carlos Zambrano. 
Soto credited backup catch­er Henry Blanco and other veteran teammates for

Soto, the

"It's kind of surreal. It real­
ly hasn't sunk in yet," Soto 
said on a conference call 
from Puerto Hico. 
Called up from the minors in April, Longoria batted .272 with 27 homers and 85 HBis despite missing five weeks after breaking his right wrist Aug. 7. Confident at the plate and splendid on defense, he was a big reason for the Hays' stunning surge to tho World Serios after 10 straight losing seasons. 

"I definitely felt some awe most of the time during the season. I kept that to myself," Longoria said on a conference call from his California home. "I didn't start the year in the big loagues. I strugglod all tlw way through high school hall and college ball. The journny that I went through as a baseball player -to be sitting here means a lot." 
Chicago White Sox second basnman Alexoi Hamirez was the runner-up after roceiving 18 se1:ond-place votes. Boston outfinlder Jacoby Ellsbury l'inished third.

But I had doubts." 

After his injury, Longoria, who turned 23 last month, returned in time for Tampa Bay's playoff run. He home­red in his first two postseason at-bats against the White Sox, then connected four times against Boston in the AL championship series to set a rookie record with six homers in one postseason. 
But his offensive tear ended in the World Series, when Longoria went 1-for-20 with nine strikeouts and two HBis as the Philadelphia Phillies beat Tampa Bay in five games. 
"Obviously, I would have loved to play well and help the team," Longoria said. "I was still pretty content that we had a great year." 
The 25-year-old Soto had a disappointing October after his team compiled the best regular-season record in the National League. Bothered by a nagging hand injury, he went 2-for-11 (.182) with no HBis as Chicago was swept in the first round by the Dodgers, leaving the Cubs without a World Series title since 1908. 
Balloting for BBWAA awards is conducted before the postseason. Votto gar­nered 21 second-place votes and 76 points to Soto's 158. Atlanta pitcher Jair Jurrjens came in third. 
"I worked really, really hard in past years," Soto said. "I feel very, very special right now. It's a very good moment in my life." 
The NL Cy Young Award will be announced Tuesday.

Poor rush worries Tomlinson 
Associated Press 

SAN DIEGO -Lal>ainian 
Tomlinson is worried, which 
is never a good sign for the 
San Diego Chargers. 

A day after the Chargers 
barely held off the last-place 
Kansas City Chiefs, the star 
running back expressed con­
cern about the team's incon­
sistent season and the lack of 
a productive running game, 
hinting there are issues the 
team is attempting to work 
through. 

Tomlinson was held to 78 
yards on 22 carries in San 
Diego's 20-19 win over the 
Chiefs and failed to score a 
rushing touchdown for the 
fifth straight game. 

Although he was slowed for much of the season's first half by a sore big toe, Tomlinson went into the KC game saying he was the healthiest he's been all season. For the fifth straight game, he failed to score a rushing touchdown. 
Tomlinson, the two-time defending NFL rushing cham­pion who's also the most bru­tally honest member of the Chargers' organization, clearly is dissatisfied with the running game. 
Asked at his regular Monday news conference why the Chargers can't run better, Tomlinson said: "That's tough to handle. I honestly believe certain things, when you start to discuss things like this, stay in house, that we discuss them among each other. There's reasons, but I'm not willing to talk about it to the media. That's something that has to be dealt with internally within the organization; play­ers, coaches, you know, that has to be dealt with between 
us." 

Tomlinson averaged 3.5 yards per carry against the Chiefs, who not only missing several starters but were allowing 5.4 yards per carry coming in. 
While San Diego's passing game is flourishing behind Philip Rivers, its running game is ranked 25th in the NFL with only 96.1 yards per game. The Chargers are 22nd with a per-carry average of 3.9 yards. Up next is Sunday's you know, but, I mean, the game at Pittsburgh, which proof is in the pudding, is the has the NFL's stingiest old saying." defense overall -allowing Said coach Norv Turner: "I only 240.3 yards per game, think we all want to run the including just 69.2 rushing ball better." yards.

times in the game you have to understand the momentum of when a team is kind of down and when you need to beat up on them and run the football a little bit versus maybe when you throw over the top of them. So that's always some­thing that needs to be felt with the coaches and some­times, I don't know. things don't got done in that fashion just because of the way the gamo may play out or it has played out most parts of the season." 
Tomlinson is two years removed from his NFL MVP season, during which he set league records with 31 total touchdowns, 28 rushing TDs and won his lirst rushing title with 1,815 yards. 
"I guess I'm really con­cerned about it because foot­ball to me is simple," he said. "I think in order to really be successful and to do what you want to do you have to be able to run the football. That's the way it's always been. Football is a running game. Not to say that you can't pass the ball but you have to be successful in run­ning the football. I'm always concerned with that. Of course I'm a little biased, because being a running back and loving to run the football,

"We definitely could be run­ning the ball better," left tackle Marcus McNeill said. "We definitely want to run the ball better." 
The Chargers (4-5) remain a game behind the Denver Broncos in the anemic AFC West. 
"We've been so up and down this season, obviously that can drain you mentally." Tomlinson said. "We're just trying to lind ways to contin­ue to get better at this time of' the year with this now start­ing to come down to the wire. We need wins." 
The Chargers were booed often in falling behind 13-6 at halftime. They didn't clinch the win until strong safety Clinton llart jumped to bat down Tyler Thigpen's 2-point conversion pass to tight end Tony Gonzalez with 23 sec­onds left. 
"I think what happened, the first half guys were a little mellow, there was a little chill around the locker room and when we went back in we realized that hey, 'Look, we can actually lose this game if we don't get it togeth­er,"' Hart said.

NFL 
Hon1e streak has Falcons flying 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Suddenly, it seems Matt Hyan and the Atlanta Falcons can't lose. 
At least not at home. 
Their 34-20 win over New Orleans on Sunday was the first of three straight home games for the Falcons, who are 4-0 at the Georgia Dome this season. Atlanta never trailed and led the Saints by 21 in the fourth quarter while improving to 6-3. 
The Falcons have won four of their last five and are tied with Tampa Bay for second place in the NFC South, one game behind Carolina. Atlanta will play host to Denver next Sunday. 
Evidence of the Falcons' ris­ing respect around the league came Monday, when the kick­off for·their Nov. 23 home game against Carolina was moved from to 4:15 p.m. to accommodate a national TV audience. 
"It's confirmation that we're doing things right," Falcons coach Mike Smith said. 
Atlanta fans who have only seen the Falcons at home may start to wonder if Hyan, the rookie quarterback. will ever make a mistake. 
In four home wins. Hyan has completed 59 of 84 passes for 902 yards with five touch­downs and no interceptions. 
Hyan has been especially impressive early in games. One week aftm leading the Falcons to scores in their first four pos­sessions in a 24-0 shutout of the Oakland Raiders, Ryan completed 10 of 13 passes for 145 yards and a touchdown in the first half as the Falcons built a 17-6 lead over the Saints. 
"It was big for us to get off to a good start," Ryan said. "The Saints' offense is so powerful and has the ability to score on any drive. It was important for us to put some points on the board and support the defense as much as possible." 
Overall, Ryan was 16-of-23 passing for 248 yards and no touchdowns against New Orleans. 
The Saints couldn't believe they were watching a rookie lead the Falcons' offense. 
"He's a good quarterback," said Saints linebacker Scott Fujita. "lie's a good manager on the offense. He does a good job of working the clock as he comes to the line and he does a good job in the hurry-up mode. 
''I'm not trying to compare anybody to Peyton Manning, but for somebody to do this that early in their career and have that much maturity and that much control of the offense and be able to dictate to us the things that they wanted to do, I was impressed with him -and frustrated and (ticked) off at the same time." 
The Falcons delivered the knockout in the third quarter. They settled for a 27 -yard field goal by Jason Elam, but the real damage in the 13-play drive came in the way they held the ball for 8 minutes and 30 seconds -their longest drive of the season. 
Michael Turner, who had 27 carries for 96 yards and a touchdown, had 10 carries for 33 yards in the third quarter. 
"I thought it was a very dom­inant performance by our offense," Smith said. 
The Raiders were left with only eight plays and 22 yards in the quarter while holding the ball for only 3:24. 
Hyan had the benefit of 
another strong game by his offensive line, which did not allow a sack for the fourth time this season. 
By contrast, John Abraham and the Falcons' defensive front constantly harassed Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who threw a season­high three interceptions. The Falcons deflected 15 of Brees' 58 passes. 
Abraham had a sack, four quarterback hurries and a pass deflection. 
"We weren't able to affect the passer, certainly we weren't able to affect the pass­er as well as they were," Saints coach Sean Payton said. "I thought they did a good job of getting a push on Brees. He was awfully hurried. We weren't able to do that with (Ryan). 
"If you just look at that one particular aspect of the game and said who impacted the quarterbacks most, you have to credit Atlanta. They were able to do that and we weren't." 
Hyan added a 6 7 -yard touch­down pass to Jerious Norwood on the second play of the fourth quarter for a 27-6 lead. 
The Saints, who had only 215 yards and 24 pass attempts through three quar­ters, had 34 passes by Brees and 306 yards in the fourth quarter, when they scored two touchdowns. 
The Saints' final quarter left the Falcons with some ugly defensive statistics. 
"We were on course to have a very solid game statistically," Smith said. "Statistics can be deceiving. Our number one goal on defense is to limit points and we did that. We gave up only six points in the first three quarters." 
NFL 
Lavv returns to Jets' defense 
Associated Press 
FLORHAM PAHK, N.J. -Ty Law is back with the New York Jets -just in time to play against the New England Patriots. 
The five-time Pro Bowl cor­nerback agreed to terms on a one-year deal with the Jets on Monday after sitting out the first 10 weeks of the season as a free agent. 
"Things appear to be headed in that direction," a person familiar with the signing told The Associated Press. 
The NFL Network first reported the signing on its Web site Monday night. The Jets wouldn't confirm the deal because it had not yet been completed, likely pending a physical. 
The 34-year-old Law, who 
has 52 career interceptions, played for the Jets in 2005 before spending the last two seasons with Kansas City. He garnered interest from New York and New England, where he played the first 10 years of his NFL career. 
Law jumps back into one of the league's biggest rivalries as the Jets play at New England on Thursday night, with the winner taking sole possession of first place in the AFC East. 
"This is going to be different playing Thursday night against the Patriots, matching up against my former team and the players I'm used to practic­ing against," Law told the NFL Network. "I know they're going to throw at me, but I welcome the challenge." 
Law and Jets coach Eric 
Mangini are very familiar with each other, dating to Mangini's five seasons as New England's defensive backs coach. 
Law told the NFL Network that the Jets plan to use him at both cornerback and safety. Cornerback Darrelle Revis, who has started every game in his first two NFL seasons, looked up to Law while grow­ing up in the same hometown of Aliquippa, Pa., and even wears Law's No. 24. 
"That's my little boy," Law told NFL Network. "I've watched him grow up and to be able to help him now, it'll be a good deal." 
Law, no longer the shutdown corner he once was, also might play opposite Revis at times. Rookie Dwight Lowery has started all nine games, but has looked shaky recently. 
NCAA FOOTBALL 
Alabama looks to finish year strong 
Associated Press 
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -No. 1 Alabama's road to a perfect regular season seems paved in crimson and white. 
The next two opponents are Auburn and Mississippi State, after all, two teams mired in disappointing seasons who are a combined 3-8 in Southeastern Conference games. Time to start gearing up for that matchup with No. 3 Florida in the league title game, right? 
Not for a team that has lost two straight to Mississippi State, Saturday's opponent, and an excruciating six in a row to chief rival Auburn. 
"If somebody were to say that to me, I'd believe they haven't seen them," Crimson Tide offensive tackle Drew Davis said. "Because it doesn't matter what

recent history would suggest 
that's premature. 
The Tide secured a spot in 
the SEC championship game 
with Saturday's overtime win 
at LSU, ending a five-year los­
ing streak to one Western 
Division rival. Now, what 
defensive end Brandon 
Deaderick jokingly calls 
Alabama's "revenge tour" 
resumes. 
"We know that they've beat 
us the past two years, and it 
makes us mad, OK?" quarter­
back John Parker Wilson said. 
"We want to go out there and 
win the game to keep doing 
what we've done this season. 
We've just kind of had a bad 
taste in our mouth the last 
couple of years, them and 
Auburn." 
LSU, too. But that's old news 
now. 
Mississippi State beat the 
Tide 17-12 in the last meeting, 
part of a four-game skid to end 
the regular season. Two years 
ago, the Bulldogs handed 
Alabama an even more painful 
loss. They snapped a 23-game 
SEC losing streak on the road 
and didn't exactly help soon­
to-be-fired coach Mike Shula's 
job security. 
"They came out and fought · their tails off and beat us fair 
and square," Deaderick said. 
"When somebody does that to 
you, especially when you can 
see so many places you could 
win the game, it's really a dag­ger to the heart. You go out there wanting to make up for last year and the year before that, just finish this season the way. it should be finished." 
The coaches hung a poster featuring last year's final score from the Mississippi State game in the football complex as a reminder. Alabama could­n't even manage a touchdown in the game. 
Tide coach Nick Saban does­n't think his players need any reminders about the recent history against the Bulldogs. 
"I think they know it, and I think that they have respect for the team that we're play­ing," Saban said. "It's impor­tant that we play well. I think the emphasis is that we play well and that we execute. What happened in last year's game will have no impact on this ye.ar's What 
impact on this 
game either." 
If Saban can 

keep the Tide focused through all the talk and attention surrounding his return visit to LSU, the next two games might not be so problematic, anyway. 
The Tigers and Bulldogs cer­tainly would love nothing more than an attention-getting, morale-boosting win over Alabama. 
But for a team that has spent the past seven weeks as either No. 1 or No. 2 nationally, Saban doesn't think that's any­thing new.

Saban isn't taking the team's focus for granted, even though it hasn't sustained many big lapses all season. He likens it to having teenage children, which he does, and worrying about them when they're out at night -even though he trusts them. 
"That's how I feel about our guys," he said. "I love them, I trust them. They've done a good job all year. They haven't gotten in trouble but until they show up and ·do it ... when they walk in the door at night, then I'm fine."

Lawsuit filed against RB Johnson 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY -A Kansas woman filed a lawsuit Monday against Chiefs running back Larry Johnson a month after claiming he spit a drink in her face at a bar and threatened to killlwr and hnr boyfriend. 
Tlw lawsuit. fiiPCI by 24-year­old Ashley N. Stewart, accuses tho two-time Pro-Bowler of negli­goncn, assault and battery, inton­tional inflirtion of emotional dis­tross and negligont inflietion of enwtional distrnss. 
Kevin I·:.J. Itngan, an attorney f'or Johnson, called the aiiPga­tions "prnpostnrous." 
The lawsuit, fiiNI in Jackson County Circuit Court, seeks puni­tive damages, attorney f'ees and any otlwr amount a jury deems to lw fair . .Johnson was charged last month with simple assault for tlw incident that oceurrnd Oct. 10 at Kansas City's Club 
Blond(~. 
"This is not about money," said Kirra N. Jones, Stewart's attor­nfly. "My elient has worked her way through school. She's in the Air Force, National Guard. She's · a hardworking student and this really came as an unfortunate incident in her life. But you know what? She's a lightP.r. She's will­ing to be thP. person who finally makes Larry Johnson answer for his rnpnat(~d bad behavior." 
But Hogan said an investigation performed on his client's behalf determined that Johnson didn't threaten anyone and that Stewart thrnw a drink at Johnson earlier in the evening. Hogan said he would move to strike the lawsuit, whkh he described as "amateur­ishly written," and might file a counterclaim. 
"This appears to be a classie incident ol' someone trying to use the court syst(~m to get something filr nothing," Hegan said. 
Johnson was baek with the tmun on Monday aftnr serving a one-game suspension imposed by the NFL for violating the league's personal conduct policy. He also missed the previous three games after being deactivated by the team. 

According to the lawsuit, Johnson ofl'ered to buy Stewart a shot of' alcohol on Oct. 3, but she dedined. A week later, she alleged, Johnson became bel­ligerent toward her and said, "All I wanted to tell you is I'm going to kill your boyfriend." 
Stewart claims Johnson also said, ''I'm gonna kill you, too. First I'm gonna kill your boyfriend, then I'm going to kill you and that's a promise." 
She says that as she was back­ing away from him, Johnson took a drink from his glass and spit it in her face, then his two body­guards taekled her. 
The suit elaims that Johnson tried thme more tiqHlS to spit on Stnwart as he was walking to his ear with his bodyguards.

"I don't know if the injury (rnsulted) from my f'ight to be No. 1 bocausn in reality, I didn't play in any extra tour­naments, I only played what I had to for the ranking and I don't think you can reproach me for that," Nadal said. "I didn't do anything crazy to be No. 1." 
Huiz-Cotorro said the injury was not career threat­ening, but that it was "total­ly impossible" for Nadal to be ready in time for the final. 
"Hafa comes in off a very tough year and his body has been warning him for weeks. It's an acute injury that needs time to recuperate," Huiz-Cotorro said. "If he played in Argentina, it could becomP. worse." 
Hobredo helped Spain to a 5-0 rout of Peru in a first­round match in February, but has reached the quarter­finals of only one of nine tournaments since winning at Bastad in July. The 21st­ranked Hobredo has been a Spain regular since 2004. 
Tho 19th-ranked Almagro made his debut against Peru, winning both singles matches, while 56th-ranked Granollers has never been selected. 
"Spain has top-level play­ers capable of achieving vie­tory," said Nadal, who didn't rule out traveling to South America to support his teammates. 
Agustin Calleri and Jose Acasuso will join David Nalbandian and Juan Martin Del Potro for the Argentine team.

The team was glad, then, as high­lights of Sunday's Big East Championship win over Connecticut played on the auditorium's big screen at the beginning of the selec­tion show. Ac; the show aired a clip of Irish freshman Melissa Henderson's game-clinehing goal that eliminated the Huskies, one Notre Dame player erupted with a playful, "See ya!" 
As long ac; the Irish can keep win­ning like they have all season, they will have home-field advantage until the College Cup semifinals in Cary, N.C. 
Irish senior eaptain Brittany Bock said the team wac; expecting a No. 1 seed and was happy it secured one. 
"I think we were definitely expect­ing it and we were hoping," she said. "You know, sometimes things don't always work out how you want them to. But to go undefeated-21­0 the whole season ... we were expecting the one-seed and I think it's gmld to be on top there." 
Notre Dame will take on Toledo in the NCAA First Round at Alumni Field Friday. If the Irish defeat the No. 16-seeded Rockets. they will play either Michigan State or the University of WLc;rDnsin-Milwaukee. Big East rival Marquette also earned a spot on Notre Dame's side of the bracket. 
No. 2-seeded Florida State, who defeated Notre Dame in last seac;on's College Cup Semifinals, would face the Irish in the fourth round at Numni Field if both teams were to advanec that far. 
Despite the possible juicy matchups in later rounds of play, Waldrum said the Irish will concen­trate solely on Toledo during prac­tice this week. 
"You've literally now gotta make sure you're really focused on Toledo Friday night ... We know we're at home as long as we take care of business," the coach said. 
Still, Waldrum said his team would not need extra motivation ifit did again meet Florida State. 
"We just have to make sure we come out, you know, on our end and then whoever winds up in that round, we'll play them," he said. "And ifit's Florida State, then I don't think there'll have to be a whole lot said during that week to get ready for them." 
Irish assistant coach Ken Nuber's pair of toddlers, who were dressed as a leprechaun and a cheerleader, entertained several of the players before the selection show. But the Irish became business-like when the telecast began. Senior forward Kerri Hanks took notes as the brackets were displayed and the room quiet­ed as seedings were announced. Bock said the team could not be more ready to play heading into the Tournament. 
"It's full-speed ahead," she said. " ... Now we just take it one game at a time. We're going to play Toledo on Friday so we'll just look to have a good week of practice and get ready for that game."

"But I think that when them's a problem and it's an area where you believe that you can be part of the answer, I think you'd better go help." 
Weis said the defense played well enough to win, but the offense and speeial teams failed to hold up their end of things. 
"Def'nnsivnly, they actually played as well as they've !wen playing," We is said. "That was a pretty gutty per­formance by the defense." 
Weis had not yet decided exactly what his role in the offense would be. lie said he would discuss the matter with his coaching staff to shaped by how we respond to these challenges." 
After losing Sheeva Parbhu and Andrew Hoth from last season's starting lineup the Irish will look to Havens, and Stahl, among others to lead the Irish behind Helgeson. 
Freshmen Casey Watt and Niall Fitzgerald also have stepped up and earned some big victories already for the Irish. 
"Our freshmen have been quite good, if somewhat inconsistent," Bayliss said. "Sometimes the best thing about freshmen is that they become sophomores, but this group can be really good if they buy in. Casey Watt is a real shotmaker, who needs only to improve his volleys and become more consistent. lie needs to learn that tennis is not like gymnastics in that there is no extra reward for the degree of difficulty in each shot attempted. Niall Fitzgerald needs to believe in himself more a crunch time and firm up his backhand." 
Bayliss stressed that the Irish will have to rely on the underclassmen heavily to bal­ance out the rest of the line­up.

Weis said he wanted to spend more time with the special teams, which had a multitude of problems on Saturday. Golden Tate fum­bled a punt return and gave the ball to Boston College, which set up a touchdown. Punter Eric Maust had a punt blocked and only aver­aged 26.1 net yards per punt. The Irish also commit­ted penalties during returns that cost them yards. 
"Take that one in combina­tion to what I just talked about with the offense, and that's two-thirds of the team who really didn't play very well yesterday," Weis said. 
Note: 
+Weis pulled the defense aside near the end of the game to assure them that they had played well. 

"I let them know that I thought that they should def­initely keep their heads up because they were the rea­son w~y we ~ere even in the game, he said.

Magazine Academic All-District V second team. 
"We're really good about working on the road, on the buses and in the airport," she said. "You just have to be able to study in non-optimal study envi­ronments." 
Stremick has excelled on the volleyball court as well as the classroom. Her freshman year, she was used mostly as a substi­tute to add depth to the Irish frontline, notching 15 blocks in only 23 matches. Stremick said that her favorite moment during her four years at Notre Dame was the team's trip to the UTSA Dome Hally in the Alamodome that season in San Antonio, where the Irish took down No. 8 USC and No. 6 Florida, pro­pelling them to No. 8 in the AVCA National Poll. 
"We beat them both in three and won the tournament," Stremick said. "I had a lot of fun, being on the road with the team for the first time." 
Her sophomore year, Stremick stepped in as a full-time starter for the Irish, playing in all 114 games. She led the team in hit­ting percentage (.304) and blocks (156). 
Stremiek asserted herself as a dominant player in the Big East her junior year, ranking fourth in the league in both hitting per­centage (.369) and blocks per game (1.58). 
So far this year, Stremick leads the Irish with 1.06 blocks/game, despite missing the first six matches recovering from injury. Last March, Stremick tore her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus. She completed her rehab a month earlier than doctors expected, but still had to sit out Notre Dame's first two early-season tournaments. 
"It sucks to just sit out and watch," she said. "So I really appreciate being able to play more than I did before." 
Stremick said that despite all the individual accolades she has achieved with the Irish, she said she wished the team could have more success during her four years. 
"I didn't want my freshman season to be my best season, as far as the team goes," she said. "I had a lot of fun, the team has been a lot of fun. As a player I've learned a lot. It would have been nice to see more win's the last couple of years, though." 
Stremick will have a chance to achieve some of that success this postseason, starting with key matches this weekend against conference leader St. John's and fourth-place Connncticut, fol­lowed by the Big East conference tournament. 
"Obviously this weekend is going to be important," she said. "I think the attitude I'm taking is just to finish strong. We know that we have a good team." 
As the only senior middle blocker on Notre Dame's roster, Stremick said it's her job to use her experience to teach and direct the younger players. 
"I just really bring my confi­dence to the front line when we're serving and blocking and let everyone know what's coming and where the hitters arH," she said. "I just really take control of the net when I'm in the front row." 
Stremiek said she fully expects the younger players will be ready to step in and lill her role after she graduates. She said when she was injured at the beginning of the year, she got to run some drills in practice and was struck by how quickly the younger players developed. 
"I thin_k ~?ey're d:fi~!tel~ ready to step m, she smd. We ve got some good younger players." 
Leaving Notre Dame volleyball in good hands, it's time for Stremick to move on to other things, like saving lives.

After loss, Weis' role to increase 
By BILL BRINK 
Sports Editor 
Notre Dame's stagnant offense against Boston College has f'oreed coach Charlie Weis to revisit his role in the offense, Weis said during his press conference Sunday. He said he would confer with the other coaches and announce his specific role during his press conference today. 
"I just told them that I was going to be taking a more active role and I'll define that more for them !Sunday]." Weis said. 
Notre Dame !'ailed to score during Saturday's 17-0 loss to the Eagles in Chestnut llill, Mass. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen threw four intercep­tions and the Irish only rushed for 66 yards during the game.
