Fr. Whelan, one of the SLC members who suggested the meeting, expressed much the same sentiments. He said he thought the meeting would con­cern hall life in general with no specific objectives outlined be­forehand. 
"The meeting will offer a chance to get together with the presidents, and hear what they have to say," Whelan said. "The SLC wants to understand much better what's going on in the dorms and this meeting will be an opportunity to do just that. Nothing major prompted the calling of this meeting just a common desire for a chance to exchange ideas back and forth." 
The meeting will begin at I 0 o'clock Sunday in the conversa­tion pit of Grace Hall. It is expected to last much of the day.

Pollution 

Pollution is one of the most pressing problems that the American faces. Our rivers, lakes, and streams grow dirtier everyday. The usefulness of these bodies as recreational areas is rapidly deminishing. Their stagnant waters begin to serve as breeding grounds for mosquitos and consequently disease. New life forms are bred from the filth to find their way into our water supplies and so into our homes, our food, and our physiologies. What the· end result of Americans consuming all these filth from our water will be is as of yet unknown. 
At the same time our air becomes more contaminated with each passing minute. Blast furnaces from factories continue on day and night shifts and American automobiles, the worst contaminators of the air pour out their carbon monoxide without cessation. 
There is the distinct possibility that unless mankind begins to work now for the eradiaction of these environmental evils he will awake someday to find out that it is too late. The air will be too polluted and people will be dying at a young age from lung cancer or other related diseases. The water in some major city will be too polluted to drink. It may come out of the faucet 
brown  instead  of  clear  or  containing  some  strange  new  life  form.  
Unbelievable?  Not  really,  because  scientists say  that it is all extremely  
possible.  

What are the chances? An all day conference will be held in the Library auditorium on Thursday, outlining the consequences of man's lack of concern about the waste he is leaving behind him in the air·and water. There are very serious health, as well as ecological implications. Even if we act to combat pollution now, some scientists say, the waste we already have may have perportrated an atrocity upon our environment which may be beyond repair. 
We urge as many students as possible to attend as many of the sessions as possible on Thursday. Pollution will be our problem. Our generation must deal with it for it may mean our lives. We urge students to begin to take an active part in community efforts to combat problems in their home towns as well as in South Bend. A group of graduate students in the engineering school has organized a group wich is working to inform the residents of South Bend on ways of dealing with their pollution problems. The group will meet with South Bend residents and government officials in the South Bend public library Thursday to help draft a bill which would govern all the airlines which service St. Joseph County Airport. We urge that as many students as possible to attend. 
We hope, too, that students will begin to take an active interest in the efforts of national and state governments in the field of air and water pollution. It is time that the vast majority of Americans realize the need for action to stop the pollution snowball. It will take lots of money to effectively stop the pollution of our environment and to clear up the present mess. One way or another American people as a whole are going to have to pay for the efforts, either through taxes to subsidize efforts of industry to provide pollution control devices or by the higher prices that industries will eventual charge to cover their costs of installing the devices on their own. We must affirm right away our willingness to pay the price for clean air, dean water, and a future.

: The Green Revolution .. 
The Green Revolution is one answer to the angry "But what are you kids for, anyway'!" It may be particularly relevant to a campus which retains some sentimental attachment to things Irish· and Catholic, since the Green Revolution is a return to the faith and practice of the mediaeval Irish scholar-monks, and the founders of the Catholic Church. The term comes from the Easy Essays of Peter Maurin, a poor French immigrant who came to the scene of radical ferment that centered around Union Square in New York during the Depression days. With Dorothy Day, he started in 1933 a paper, The Catholic Worker which continues today as does the movement which shortly grew up around them. 
Like many revolutionaries, he made a scathing critique of the present order: "When the banker has the power/the educator trains students/in the technique of profit making./When the banker has the power/the clergyman is expected/to bless the profit-making system/or to join the unemployed. /When the banker has the power/the Sermon on the Mount/is declared unpractical./When the banker has the power/we ha~·e an acquisitive,jnot a functional society. .. A Bourgeois/is a fellow/who tries to be somebody/by trying to be/like everybody,jwhich makes him/a nobody." 
Like the early Christians, the Catholic Workers were "pacifists" in the sense of refusing the use of violence; "anarchists" by refusing to worship or rely on the organized use of force through the state; and "communists" by living in voluntary poverty, sharing goods and denying class distinctions. 
But unlike most revolutionaries and modern "Christians," Peter Maurin looked to the Church for the transformation of men and society; in an Easy Essay called "Blowing the Dynamite," he wrote, ' 
"It is about time/to blow the lid off/so the Catholic Church/may again becorne/the dominant social dynamic force." 
From this ideology came a program: "The Catholic Worker believes/in the gen tie personalism/of traditional Catholicism. f. ..in the personal obligation/of looking after/the needs of our brother./.. .in the daily practice/of the Works of Mercy./. . .in Houses of Hospitality/for the immediate relief of those who are in need./. ..in the establishment/of Farming Communes/where each one works/according to his ability/and gets/according to his need./. ..in cre.atmg a new society/within the shell of the old/with the phzlosophy of the new,/which is not a new philosophv /but a verv old phi/osophy,ja philosophy so old/that it looks like ne.w." · 
Through "Round Table Discussions," the wisdom of scholars would give guidance and clarity of thought; the poor would be served with food, shelter, and clothing; and a renewed sense of contemplation, thoughtfulness, and honest labor would be cultivated on the communal farms. The life style had been known to Indian sages as the Triple Yoga of bhakti, byana, and karma; the Catholic Workers called Cult, Culture, and Cultivation. To the mediaeval Irish monks and Benedictine monastics, it had been the equal division of energies into prayer, study, and work. 
The hospitality houses and farming communes continue to function today, without any formal central organization. But as environmental pollution and the industrialization of agriculture made a Back to the Land movement less attractive, and as the technocractic civilization began to destroy men as much through psychological as by material oppression, Catholic Workers turned from seeking a place away from the corporate society to confronting it directly, through civil rights work, supporting workers' struggles like the grape boycott, and draft resistance. 
The usual response to Peter Maurin's challenge is, "But it won't work." He answered that "Christianity has not been tried/because people thought/it was impractical./And men have tried everything/except Christianity.jAnd everything/that men have tried/has failed. ..The life of Christ must be a life ofsacrifice" -not a life dedicated to effectiveness, or to building, overthrowing, or defending kingdoms of this world. Catholic Workers seek to bear witness through suffering love, in service to the poor -"the Ambassadors of God" -to the faith that "He rose again according to the Scriptures, ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead. " <;l1rist is King, the Kingdom of God is among us. That is what 
we are for.

There ought to be a law 
The following is the last in a three-part series on the problems of pollution. This pressing problem of our time will be examined in a Confrerece all day Thursday in the Library Auditorium. In this series, the Observer will interview some of the participants and examine some of the problems. It is written by Steve Effler, an Observer staff reporter. 
Granted that pollution is a growing and important menace, what are we going to do about it? Professor Frederick Dow of the Business School and Dean Lawless of the Law School offer complementary outlines of solutions. 
Professor Dow emphasized the moral role of the American business executive. An executive can have control over the power to pollute of a huge factory_ This "Quantitative difference leads to an ethical difference," i.e. when you are dealing in the realm of thousands of tons or millions of gallons "unconscious malice can he as dangerous as concious malice." 
Clearly the business esewtive is place in a squeeze between the wellbeing of the world and the interests of the corporations stockholders in profit. The "control of Pollution can put a company at a competitive disadvan'tage." Because of this it is clear, according to Dr. Dow, that "what is needed is uniform standards of legislation." 
There are many political problems in pollution legislation. "Pollution is a knee jerk work work ­elicits an emotional response like Raquel Welch or Military Industrial complex." It would be very easy for a politician to gain votes on this issue without really treating the problem. On the other extreme it would be very profitable for one state to relax requirements and attract industry. Such an unscrupulous act would of course gather in immense tax revenues while destroying any efforts of states downstream or nearby to curb pollution. If, for instance, Ohio were to emb:uk on such a course, there is no way in which other states could clean up either the Great Lakes or The Mississippi River. 
Obviously the Federal Government must set up a ruling code or a set of minimum standards. Professor Dow supports the idea of "rigourous but realistic" minimum performance standards. Rather than specifying certain machinery, the government would requirecertain results. Th competition to toea te the cheapest most efficient methods would produce new and better equipment at no expense to the government and to the benefit of alL 
Professor Dow is also a firm believer in the use of tax incentives. Through them, the Government can "skew the economic system in one direction" or another attaining the ideal that "society should allocate the resources of the country for its benefit." 

If it can be conceded then that there must be over all solutions and legislation, what form should it take? Dean Lawless points out that there are many viable legal solutions within our system. He explains how one can use different combinations of administrative boards, criminal penalties and i nj unctions. Different methods offer different advantages in concrete situations. The important thing is that there be an overall plan to avoid such waste effort as is documented by both the Dean and yesterdays New York Times editoriaL 
5A billion dollars of Federal anti-pollution grants has been showed on audit to be wasted. According to Dean Lawless "the General Accounting Office said that little or nothing had been accomplished." The Times gives concrete examples of how it happened: "For example, to lower the municipally produced pollution of Oregon's Willamette River by 20,000 units when two paper mills were allowed to dump up to a hundred times that amount of waste into the same waterway" does little significant good. 
The time is passed for pious words of warning about the possible effects of environmental pollution on future generations. By the time the average Notre Dame student is thirty if Dr. Griffing is right, (and I have heard less conservative estimates) the pollution crisis will be past the point of no return. Lake Erie is already dead. Breathing NY City air is as good for you as a Two-pack-a-day cigarette habit. 
Examples could be multiplied forever. You can pick up some of the basic knowledge about the situation all day Thursday at the Library Auditorium. You can pick the Time reprint on the subject at 402 Fisher HalL 
There is a n1oral imperative for students too. Since we are the future businessmen, engineers, lawyers and community leaders who will try to solve the problem. There's nothing like a foolishly idealistic ending to a newspaper article. 
Following is a list of times for various activities connected with the conference to be held Thursday, December II in the Notre Dame Library Auditorium.

Your highway taxes at rest, work, and play 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -If you drive for more than 2.7 miles along any one stretch of interstate highway, chances are you will encounter a sign reading "Your Highway Taxes at work." 
I don't know how much these signs cost, but it is obvious that a sizable wad of our sign painting taxes also are at work. 
At any rate, all of us motorists should be extremely grateful to the Bureau of Public Roads, or whoever it is who is responsible for erecting the signs. 
Without them, we might erroneously assume that some contractor was building, improving or repairing the road with his own money_ 
We also should be extremely grateful to D.C. Rogers of Marion, Ill., who has come forth with an idea for spreading this type of informational transmission to other fie-lds of governmental endeavor. 
Sees Workmen Reclining 

One day as Rogers was tooling along an interstate route he saw about a half dozen workmen reclining in the shade of one of the signs. This started him to thinking that the sign should have read: "Your Highway Taxes at Rest." 
And that started him to thinking thusly: 'Why not have signs or badges made for every city, state and federal employe to wear while on the job so we taxpayers would readily be able to distinguish who was doing what?" 
Why not indeed? 

Sociologists tell us that one of the reasons so many taxpayers feel alienated today is because they are unable to figure out what their taxes are doing. 
Better communication along that line might go a long way toward ameliorating the average taxpayer's attitude toward the government. 
Subcommittee Investigation 
Suppose, for example , that some congressional subcommittee is leaving for Paris, France, to investigate the impact of pornographic skywriting on the European Common Market. 
On the side of the Air Force plane carrying the lawgivers on this mission there would be a big sign reading: "Your Tax Dollars Taking a Junkett."

Letters to the Editor 
With hope 

Dear Father Heshurgh, 
Can you possibly reali?e the implications of not only what you are doing to me and the others who must face the Ap­peals Court on Thursday, but what you are doing to yourself and to this university? 
We were preparing our court defense in ordt::r to confront the university with what we felt were its unchristian actions. Mr. Faccenda informed us that he and the administration felt that we were trying to force them into a corner. We discussed tht:: matter and dt::cided that the creation of a university senate with equal administration, fa­culty, and student representa­tion, and the power to deter­mine the policy which a Christ­ian university should practice, might get at what we felt was one of the central problems at Notre Dame-that the decision making process, the ultimate power for decisions--is in the hands of people on the peri­meter of the Christian university and not ultimately involved in the Chril;tian community. We informed Mr. Faccenda about this and he agreed to call a meeting. We asked specifically that you be present. You elected not to come. At the meeting we presented our proposal without any mention of the trial or its outcome. We weren't looking for amnesty-we were suggesting a constructive course for a Christ­ian university to follow. The purpose of the meeting was blur­red after the first half hour. 
, 

It was disheartening. We de­cided after the meeting to go talk with you. The gist of our conversation went something like this: "Hello, Father, could we please talk with you?" "I'm in a meeting now boys. Who are you?" "We are five of the people who were suspended/expelled. Do you think we could talk to you later'!" "I have a lot of work 
to do and I've been in meetings all day." "Father, we feel that we must talk to you." "I can't get involved in the trial now. It must go through the normal procedures. I don't want to pre­judice it." "We don't want to talk about the trial, Father, but rather about our proposal." "Oh, you mean that thing at the continuing education center. I had my representative there and he will tell me about it." "That is what we are afraid of, Father. We can't seem to reach you on a personal level." "Well, I'll talk to my representative. I don't want to get involved in this until I have to. When the time comes I will examine the issues." "Fa­ther, you are already involved and we all know it." "I'll exa­mine the matter when it comes to me. Good bye boys. Oh, by the way who are you" You got our names and shook our hands and summarily dismissed us. 
You might as well've asked for 
I.D. numbers. You made us objects. By doing that, Father, you can easily dismiss us from your corporation because you deny us the respect of being human, of being equal, being one in Christ. When you deny the God in me you can do as you please. But whom have you really hurt? 
I submit that it is yourself also that you have turned into an object, a machine. As John Donne said: "Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and there­fore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee." In war the bell tolls for you the warrior, always the tar­get at the end of your gun. This is not war, but you have effect­ively killed, nay murdered me, by turning me into an object. More 
serious yet you have killed your­self and have further intensified the destruction (not disruption)

Pray for O'Meilia 

Editor: 
I think that it would be advisable to keep Tim O'Meilia 's article, "Which Game?", for posterity. ll is quite evident that if placed in the genre of disgusting misanthropic "litera­ture", it would have no equal. 
I shall pray for Mr. O'Meilia, although I'm sure that he will scoff at the idea. Perhaps, someday, he will no longer be filled with hate. 
I also would be quite in­terested in hearing Mr. O'Meilia's reasons for attending Notre Dame. It certainly cannot be because of his love for the institution.

Worst season Editor: Now that the 1969 home football season is over, I would like to thank du Lac for the worst football season I have experienced so far in my 5 years here. The reason for saying this is entirely based on the seating arrangement in the stadium. They do away with individually reserved seats and give you a reserved section to go to. Then they oversell the number of tick­ets for the game and put the extra people in the seats the St. Mary's girls used to occupy, making no compensation for the girls who will be sitting in the student section. As a result, you're cramped into a space a four year old couldn't fit into. Many have to stand in the aisles, which makes it impossible for those who are fortunate enough to have a seat to see. This results in everyone standing in everyone else's way. 
Earlier I mentioned we had sections to sit in--well, we're supposed to anyway. I guess everyone but juniors and gradu­ate students do-they havt> to put up with the grossest bunch of animals I have ever seen the Vikings. Most of them are fresh­men and sophomores, but they're in the junior-graduate section. They stand the whole game forcing everyone behind them to stand too. Eve one pays for the same things around here, and the only thing this place has going for it gives it to you in the ear. Thanks to all this, I can't say I have enjoyed one game this year. I can only hope that they react to the situation, and give up their mer­cenary tactics, particularly when they apply them to the back­bone of Notre Dame-the stu­dents, all the students, not just a few. I'll be graduating in June with my masters, but I felt 
something had to be said by 
someone. Thanks for your time.

Uncouth spectators 

Editor: 
Re: Romeo and Juliet. Having 

just returned from the St. Mary's 
Notre Dame Theatre production 
of Shakespeare's Romeo and 
Juliet, we feel compelled to ad­
dress this letter to the "academ­
ic" community. 
We are appalled and scandal­ized by the boorish comportment of the uncouth spectators who comprised the opening-night house. Their crudeness was con­sistently displayed throughout the performance by the inane titters and untimely guffaws at such climactic moments as 'The Balcony Scene.' Mercutio's tragic death, the sc{·ne of Juliet's drathbed, and the dramatic sui­cide of Romeo. Despite flaws in the production, certainly the in­herent qualities of culture and refinement befitting the members of an "educated" canail~ should have mastered their first Impulses in order to retain a dignified 
Perhaps the only solution to this dilettantism would he to offer a co-ex course treating the distinction bet ween Moliere and The Three Stooges, bet ween Shakespeare and soap opera, and 
between Wedgwood and plastic. Sincerely yours, Annette Marie Weidhaas Margaret Mary Kelly 
More familiar 

Editor: 
Of the reviews that I have seen in your paper, the majority are derogatory and disenhearten­ing to an actor. The best exam­ple is the reviews of the ND-SMC productions. The critic did not care for "Who Bombed in New Haven"; yet all that I heard from the audiences were compliments. The same is true of "Romeo and, Juliet". 
I would like to encourage Mr. Tapscott to be a little more familiar with characters in plays. I am forced to question whether or not he has ever conscientious­ly read the script. I have seen this production being put to­gether and the final product. It is a good production. It may have some awkward scenes, but I hardly consider the swordfights "graceless" or performances "sluggish". 
In case you haven't heard, Mr. Tapscott, critics are allowed to say something complimentary about more than just a good-looking girl. Maybe the only compliments you care to give are for revealing costumes.

"Disruption" 

Editor: 
There appeared, in your Dec. 

2 issue, a request for a meeting 
with persons who may have 
witnessed the "I 5 minute In­

peared under bold-face type in 
which the solicitors proclaimed 
themselves to he members of a 
"committee" whose avowed pur­
pose was the prevention of 
"disn-1ption" to the University. 
Now no one including myself -as a member of a "committee" or otherwise-claims to he opposed to this noble goal. However, there are at least a few of us at Notre Dame Law School who feel that stat ments formulated for pub­lication, particularly statements concerned with a pl·nding quasi­-judicial pnll"etding, should be characterized hy temperance and objectivity, rather than by emotional appeals which almost certainly will have the effect of conditioning the viewpoint of the community in which the proceeding is to lake place. 
(It is doubly rL'grettahle that 

a member of the legal fraternity 
itself would allow himself to fall 
into so gross an mdiscretion.

Grad students initiate forum on environment 

by Shawn Hill 
"Manktnd has lost the ability to foresee and forestall. lie will end by destroying the earth." 
This quotation from Albert Schweitzer headed the flyer announcing the initial meeting of the "Forum on the Environment" on the Notre Dame campus. 
The Forum on the Environ­ment is an organization founded to inform N.D. and SMC stu­dents and South Bend residents about the dangers of environ­mental pollution and to work to control this pollution. 



Begin work-study plan 
The Urban Studies Institute, in cooperation with the Kennedy Institute, is initiating 
work/study  programs  for  
undergraduates  beginning  next  
semester.  

The main purpose of the new work/study programs is to give a student the opportunity to learn experientially from a community-based assignment in which he may become involved. By working in the field, the student will be forced to understand the urban situation in telledually and then act on that understanding. 
At present there are approximately twenty public and private agencies and private businesses and industries in the South Hend an:a concerned about urban problems which have expressed an interest in involving students in their work. 
l"he work studies programs make it possible for a student to receive academic credit for community work. Depending on the nature of each work/study project and the policy of his

tne passage of a bill before Con­gress to set up a Council of Environmental Affairs similar to the Council of Civil Advisors already in existence. 
This Council would review legislation affecting the environ­ment and advise the various leg­islators corH.:erning such legislat­ion's beneficial or detrimental effects. The effect of a new freeway on the land would be an example of this. 
It is to work from the bottom up that Murley and Pavoni founded the Forum on the En­vironment and they hope that the Forum will grow to include a large number of undergraduates. 
They stated that the main purpose of the Forum was to organize a group of people who would be willing to go into South Bend and to inform the 
citizens about the pollution dan­gers in the area and to work with them to solve the problems. 
The next meeting of the For­um on the Environment will be this Thursday (Dec. II) evening in the South Bend Community Library. The members will meet with a group drafting a County Air Pollution Control Ordinance and interested South Bend resi­dents. 
They hope to influence the final draft of the bill and plan to work for its passage. 
This meeting is supported and will be attended by members of the South Bend County Health Department, members of the St. Joseph County Hospital Staff, a prominent South Bend attorney, and a legislative assistant to Con­gressman John Brademas. 
Both Pavoni and Murley hope that as many Notre Dame and St. Mary's students as possible will show interest and attend the meeting. 
They feel it could be the evening program of the pollution seminar held that day in the Notre Dame Library auditorium. 
Future plans for the Forum in dude an en vi ron men tal Teach-In on pollution to be held April 22. The idea for this teach-in was suggested by ~enator Caylord Nelson of Wis­consin during the conference in Washington. 
It is to be nation-wide and l'avoni and M urlcy hope the Forum can make it into a suc­cess in the South Bend area. 
Murley said that he is hopeful for the success of this and other programs across the country but time is running out. 
"The real problem is populat­ion, pollution being a symptom of it," he said. 
He gave the example of an air pollution control device for automobiles that reduces pol-Jution by 50%. 
"If such a device reduces pol­lution by 50% when installed, but the number of autos doubles in the next year you are back where you started from," he said.

Golf Alive and Well and Living in Latrobe 


© 1969, Los Angeles Times 
We bring you today a medical bulletin direct from the critical ward and intensive care unit of Sports. You can put away the beads, and hold the flowers, and call off the death watch. 
Golf is able to sit up and take nourishment. 
For the first time, doctors hold out hope for its complete recovery. Respiration normal, pulse stronger, temperature falling. They've removed the oxygen tent. 
You will remember Golf came down with an 82 and a medically baffling disorder of the hip and backswing last summer, and took to its bed. Prognosis was not good. Some thought the case terminal. Others felt a long and painful road back was the best to hope for. 
Well, Golf is alive and well and living in Latrove, l'a. When last seen it was wearing a tan sweater, two-tone shoes, and knocking in 30-foot putts. 
Golf's given name is Arnold Palmer. Sometimes, it is little telltale things that indicate to a doctor a patient is on the road to recovery -a movement of a blanket, flutter of an eyelid, spot of color on a cheek. Sometimes, the patient just comes to and asks what day :t is. 
A Dazzling 68 
They new Golf was on the mend when Palmer jerked a 3-wood out of the bag and asked the caddy to go up and hold the pin. They knew Golf was on the way hack when Palmer had a choice of going under a tree or around it-·-and he went THROUGH. They knew Golf was recuperating when he shot a 68 on a course so tough that--on the last day when only good players were left--no one broke par, two shot 80, and nearly a half-dozen shot 77's. The host pro had trouble breaking 100. 
If you think I've got my patients mixed, that the two are not interrelated, that Palmer might he sick but Golf was healthy, don't sell that to Larry Ziegler. During the period when Golf was on the shelf, Larry won his only tournament. And there wasn't enough money to pay off. 
Guys who were bidding up the purses to the stratosphere when Palmer and Jack Nicklaus were matching birdies suddenly stopped answering the phone. Golf is a game where you have to play off someone's ball. Even in a $2 Nassau, you arrange the match and the bets around the best player. Golf without Palmer is anarchy. There's no one's ball to play off of. 
The encouraging fever chart is not Palmer's alone. For, 1969 was a year the Golden Bear went into hibernation, too. Jack Nicklaus wasn't laid up, but his game was. 
In the past month and a half, only a handful of tournaments have been played. But two have been won by Nicklaus, and, now, one has been won by Palmer. 
Palmer Is News 
They don't need the money, but the game of Golf does. When 
Palmer wins a tournament, the game gets on the six o'clock news, 
the "A" wire. When someone else wins, he phones his wife·--and 
she's out. 
You not only need someonl's ball to play off of, you need 
someone to play off of it. Hagen had Sarazen, Hogan had Sneed. 
Nelson had Guldahl. And Palmer has Nicklaus. If Billy Casper can 
get his game going, they ·could push the Super Bowl down to "Last 
Night's Results." 
The game is in !radian in periods bet ween major makhups. It 
may even be pronouneed dead. But, at the momenl, hear! massage 
has worked. The heart is pumping again. This will he good news to 
motel owners at Augusta, television nt'!works in New York, and even 
though they may not think of it, to 50 other golfers who not only 
have something tangible to beat now but an assured payoff of I00 
cents on the dollar if they do.

The Northern Illinois Huskies invade the Convo tonight with a losing record but plenty of good credentials. Last Monday night, NIU gave the highly-rated Ohio State Buckeyes a scarr before going down 106-99. And OSU had to shoot 36-40 free throws to do it. 
Leading the Huskies is 6-4 forward Larry Zielinski who though only a sophomore is drawing plenty of raves in DeKalb. Last year, he lead the frosh with a 29.4 average and 
has continued a similar scoring pace this year. Overall, the Huskies are young and fairly small, but they've played will in all their games. Now ranked 16th by UPI, Notre Dame will enjoy a decided height advantage, as at Valpo last Saturday. Another fine performance on the boards will be necessary to sotop the Huskies. Austin Carr, with a string of three 30-point performances, leads Irish scoring with a 3 5. 7 average. 
Kentucky Wildcats named No.I 
NEW YORK (UPI)-The Ken­tucky Wildcats and veteran men­tor Adolph Rupp never seem to run out of challenges even though the baron of college basketball ranks as one of the most widely decorated members of the coaching fraternity. 
There are several big challeng­es entering the new season. One is a fifth national championship; the other is a winning season despite the loss of Mike Casey, the team leader of the Wildcats who broke a leg in an automo­bile accident during the summer and won't return this year. 
UCLA, also 2-0, got 14 first place votes and 270 points for the No. 2 spot while South Carolina, ranked second in the pre-season ratings, dipped to fourth after suffering a 55-54 setback at the hands of Tenne­ssee. 
New Mexico State, picking up three wins in the first week of the new campaign, moved from fifth to third. The Aggies re­ceived three first place votes and a total of 222 points. The re­maining first place votes went to Ohio State. Points are awarded on a I 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 basis. 
Southern California, using im­pressive victories over Colorado and Vanderbilt to collect strong voting support, jumped from ninth into a tie for fifth with Duquesne, both wirh 119 points. 
Davidson 2-0 climbed a notch to seventh followed by North Carolina 2-0. Tennessee played only one game but the Vol's stunning upset of South Carolina lifted the Volunteers from the list of the also rans to the No, 9 ranking. 
Villanova and Ohio State shared the No. 10 position with 53 points each.
