St. Mary's considers .Formation of H·PC
. 
by Nancy Stefkovicb Staff Reporter 

The formation of a Hall Presi­dents' Council is currently being seriously considered by the St. Mary's hall presidents, which would mark the first time that such an organization has been attempt­ed at St. Mary's. 
Julie Pelletiere, president of Holy Cross, explained that an HPC would ''extend unity between all of the halls." 
Vice-President for Student Af­fairs Mary Ann Stolze stated that the purpose of such a group would be to "keep a line of communica­tion open between hall presidents and students. Everyone on campus wants fo know what's going on and the formation of an HPC is a step towards this." 
The proposed council, Stolze noted, is similar in function to the Hall Life Commission already out­lined in the St. Mary's student government. She commented that the HPC would have a more defined purpose. 
In addition to organizing activi­ties and acting as a source of information to students at St. Mary's, the HPC \\COuld help coordinate social activities involv-
Nazz hosts ND Jazz Combo 

This Saturday at 9:30p.m. the Nazz will host the return of the Notre Dame Jazz Combo. Past group members Neil Gillespie, Bill Boris and Steve Calonje will be joined by a newcomer on bass, Sedrick Williams. · 
The opening performance by the jazz combo will be followed by an open jam session, which will provide an opportunity for persons interested in a position with the combo to display their talents. Sponsors expect a fine evening of jazz performances. 
It is also probable that some of the more talented folk entertainers will also make an appearance. 
ing Notre Dame. Hall presidents from both campuses met at an informal dinner Tuesday to discuss the possibility of such develop­ments. 
Stolze indicated that the pro­posed HPC would not only provide social activities with Notre Dame men but also "strengthen the relationship between St. Mary's · and Notre Dame women." 
Regina Hall President Elizabeth Cutter stated that the first meeting between the St. Mary's and Notre Dame hall presidents has already improved their working relation­ship. 
St. Mary's hall presidents will continue to attend the weekly Tuesday night meetings of the Notre Dame HPC. Any possible formal linkage between the two councils will be delayed at least until the St. Mary's HPC becomes more organized. 
Stolze expressed praise for the hall presidents. "This shows good initiative. The hall presidents are speaking up for the students of St. Mary's and are trying to do the best they can for them." 
As of now, the HPC is going through its formative process. The hall presidents hope soon to define its goals and draft a constitution.

Carla Iacona and Maria Magnannelli, co-chairpersons of the election committee, expressed hope that the elections would be conducted as efficiently as possi­ble. 
Students will have a choice of candidates in all halls except Regina, where Mary Garret runs unopposed. Pat Payne, Shelly Meditz and Ann Deighen will seek election in Holy Cross, while Claire Hatch, Mary Rukavina and Debbie Simone are opposed in LeMans. McCandless fields four candidates, Kathy Murphy, Ginny Nask, Lynn Roberts and Grace Restivo.

Kissinger's time limited 
By Arthur Gavshon Associated Press Writer 
LUSA~A. Zambia (AP) Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda told U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger yesterday that he has "days, not weeks" to succeed in his effort to avert a racial war in southern Africa. 
Kissinger replied, "President Ford shares your view that time is running out. We Americans have an obligation to all and you can be sure I am conscious of the respon­sibilities I face." 
Five times in his short speech after Kissinger arrived from Tan­zania, Kaunda said black Africans will fight if Kissinger fails to work 

Springstein to debut at NO 
by Jim Bowler Staff Reporter 
Tickets for the Oct. 9 Bruce Springsteen concert will go on sale 9 
a.m. Monday morning at the A.C.C, Student Uniou. ticket office, and all A.C.C. outlets. All lower-level seats are $6.50 and bleacher seats are $5.50. 
The concert, Springsteen's debut 
at Notre Dame, should sell out fast, 
according to Jim Speier, concert 
commissioner. "I think people are 
going to want to see what kind of a 
show he has," claims Speier, "and 
they are in for a pleasant sur­
prise." 
Sophomores Jim Kotorac and 
Terry Barret plan to "go down to 
the , ticket office Saturday night 
right after d;. .... We'd line up 
earlier, but wet;. t find anyone to 
wait during the game:" However, 
the A.C.C. ticket area will not be 
opened till 6 p.m. Sunday because 
of other schedulings. 
Pt 'paration for the Springsteen concert is not the only business on the concert committee's agenda. A massive refund campaign is cur­rently underway in connection with the cancelled America concert. Refunds for America tickets are out a settlement between blacks and whites in Rhodesia. 

"You have only a few days, not weeks, to succeed, because we all have reached the point of no return," Kaunda said. "If you don't succeed, the alternatives will be too ghastly to contemplate. 
"Our stand is clear. For us there can be no compromise. But what alternative do we have left to achieve for the people of Rhodesia what we have ourselves?" Kaunda said. 
Kissinger said he agreed with Kaunda's list of the fundamental issues in the developing racial confrontation -''the dignity of man irrespective of color, justice for men regardless of their color, independence and freedom for all." 
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere told Kissinger earlier he was pessimistic about averting racial conflict. But despite the gloomy assessments of his hosts, 
U.S. informants said Kissinger still rates his chances of setting up meaningful black-white negotia­tions on Rhodesia and Namibia at slightly less than even. 
Kissinger apparently expected a firm stand by Nyerere and Kaunda on grounds that neither was likely to yield until hearing the outcome of talks this week between South African Prime Minister John Vorster and Rhodesian Prime Min­ister Ian Smith. Vorster is reported­ly urging Smith privately to soften his stand on accommodation with Rhodesian blacks. 
Smith won the backing of his all-white Rhodesian Front party yesterday to seek a settlement with the country's six million blacks. But delegates made clear he must hold out against enforced racial integration and stick to land laws allotting half the country to the 270,000 whites. 
Nyerere and Kaunda, who met last week with the presidents of Botswana, Mozambique and Angola to set policy on Kissinger's mission, were opposed to Kissinger meeting with Smith. Such a meet­ing might take place in Pretoria, South Africa, where Kissinger is to confer Friday with Vorster. 
In Dar es Salaam, Nyerere told reporters ''Africans would not be very happy'' if Kissinger treated Smith "as a statesman." The black presidents view Smith as a white supremacist who has forced them into conflict and oppose any meet­ing that would enhance his impor­tance.  
U.S. officials said that although Kissinger thinks a meeting with Smith on Kissinger's terms is unlikely, there is little doubt he wants to spell out to the Rhodesian leader the implications of a refusal by Rhodesian whites to yield power.

Campus lighting improved 
by Greg Besio Staff Reporter 

Lighting the grounds of the Notre Dame campus is a "perpet­ual problem" according to Sr. John Miriam Jones, Assistant Provost. The problem became so serious that four years ago a consulting firm was hired to redesign the lighting plan for the University grounds. "However," Sr. Jones said, 'the University officials found the proposal overwhel­mingly expensive." 
The proposal involved removing the entire existing system before installing the new one. Rather than waiting for the funds necessary to build the new system before taking action, the University has been gradually improving on the old system. The problem is that the system is reaching the limits of its 
capability. 
Last year, Sr. Jones and a group of concerned students took a walk­ing tour of the campus in an attempt to locate any spots which needed immediate attention. This led to a study by the provost's office and the drafting of a plan of action. 
Subsequently, over the summer, additional lighting was installed behind the Administration Build­ing, near Lewis Hall, on the path which goes diagonally from Sacred Heart Church to Howard Hall, and on the North Quad. Some lighting was installed near Lyons Hall but it is felt that more is needed there. 
Another area of concern, the general area behind the ACC and the path the Campus View apart­ments has been illuminated by a street lamp. In addition to thes~ new lights, most of the old fixtures now have mercury vapor bulbs which are brighter and give a more even illumination than conven­tional incandescent bulbs. 
Sr. Jones added that even though improvements are not at an end, she believed that the main­tenance crews had "gotten at the worst." Some problems areas that still remain are the grounds near St. Ed's and on the road near the Grotto. 
So far this year only one com­plaint has been received by the Provost's _Office about insufficient lighting, in reference to the St. Ed's area. Sr. Jones emphasized that improvements would continue to be made until lighting was at a "satifactory level." 

Mansfield spends last day in Se11ate 
ByTomRaum tour of the Capitol offered to all Associated Press Writer tourists. 
Mansfield, who has decided not to seek re-election after 34 years in public office, plans to spend some time in the Senate today before leaving with Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, for a long-planned visit to the People's Republic of China. 
An acknowledged authority on Far Eastern affairs who once taught the subject, Mansfield will not be back in Washington until after the Oct. 2 congressional adjournment. He said then he will spend two weeks campaigning for Democratic

6 
letters to a lonely God 
agame ofchess 
Reverend Robert Griffin 

I can't help it, she said, pulling a long face, It's them pills I took, to bring it off, she said. (She's had five already, and nearly died of young George.) 
The chemist said it would be alright, but I've never been the same. 
You are a proper fool, I said. Well, if Albert won't leave you alone, there it is, I said, What you get married for if you want children? 
A Game of Chess'', The Wasteland --T.S. Eliot 

I don't suppose that the Catholic Bishops of the United States would defend me, if I were under attack. If some promin~nt Catholic leader said of me, "The priest Griffin just blew it," I doubt that their episcopal reverences would interrupt their separate confirmation tours to even in­quire what it was that the priest Grif­fin had blown. After reading Fr. Bill Too­hey's Opinion column in Wednesday's Observer. I wanted to put in a word on behalf of the hierarchy, though they woulcl.n't do as much for me. I wanted so much to defend them, bumbling badly like a team of clumsy comedians, that just a few moments ago, I called Bill Toohey, to ask if he would consider me unfriendly or ungracious, if I publicly disagreed with his column, titled "Bishops Blow It." (The title was not of Bill's choosing, as the Ed­itorial Editor sheepishly admits.) Bill as­sured me that he would still be available for taking Darby O'Gill for walks, even if I did disagree with him. "It will be you, Griffin, I will not take for walks," he said. 
"Well," I answered, "you never did take me much for walks anyway.'' As far as Bill Toohey and I are concerned politics will never make us strange b:dfe_l­lows, but it will never make bad frtenc of us, either. 
Every once in a while, there are evils that confront us as human beings that sicken the conscience of mankind. There was the slaughter of the six million Jews in Germany, for example. There was the segration of Blacks in America. There were the napalm bombings in the Viet­nam War; today there are the horrors of World Famine. As horrifying, to me, as these other evils is the almost mindless traffic in abortions that is taking place in the hospitals-and clinics of America. I am not insensitive (I hope) to the fears and pressures that might drive an unmarried girl or an over-worked mother to the ter­mination 'of an unwanted pregnancy; but does it not seem criminal to destroy an unborn child because the parents had wanted a boy or a girl, and intra.-uterine tests indicate that the infant to be born will be of the other sex? Does it not seem like an endless escalation of the evil when 
the government, having allowed abortions is also expected to pay for them so that every woman can· afford the costs of 
an abortion? (If we are financing the equality of citizens before the law, why doesn't the government provide funds so that every couple can afford a baby, if they 
want one?) Does it not seem like criminal manipulation when some welfare workers insist that women have abortions against their will, if they are to continue receiving public assistance? . . 
It is not only the two or three mtlhon abortions that have taken place that upset The real nightmare is the millions upon millions of abortions that will eventually take place, until the fig~re re~ched makes the six million Jews ktlled m Germany, or the fifty thousand Americans killed in Vietnam, seem like an expendable handful in terms of human slaughter. 
In the second section of The Wasteland, a woman's voice tells the story of Lil, wife of Albert, who had an abortion. The entire scene is an image of life in the Waste­land where nothing lives or grows. It is a 'terrifying picture of life in ~he L~st Generation, as the Lost Generatton ptc­tured itself to be. Could it be any more terrifying than the statistic o! ~ million abortions a year? More terrtfymg than totaling up the slaughter in a de~a?e, til we come to the statistic of ten mtlhon; then 
,. 
adding the totals of the decades, til the number of deaths exceeds all the deaths in all the wars that mankind has ever fought~ Could we do such addition without reah­zing the ways ·in which America the Beautiful could become a Wasteland as landscaped in sickness as any that the poets can imagine? 
The problems, of course, are so complex with arguments to be made and points to be conceded, for and against the abortion issue. But when the smoke of argument clears away, there is the more-than-Gothic horror of a nation intent upon ripping children untimely from their mothers' wombs; and there is the bloody spectacle of a country that sins against its very own survival. My imagination works overtime, perhaps, but a country so thriving in its abortion industry seems to be at some final outpost of empire. We seem intent on dooming ourselves and our civilization to a moral shabbiness, through which any empire, grown so decadent, would fall into ruin. 
Is the solution, then, for the American bishops to force the presidential candidates to come, hats in hand, to explain the :Republican and Democratic attitudes on abortion to the Cardinal Archbishop of New York? Doubtlessly it is dumb of the bishops to expect any good to come from their review of the candidates, who wring their hands and twist their feet as they play political games with their eminences and excellencies. The outcome may be annoying, embarrassing, and even risky for American Catholics, for there are rednecks and intellectuals alike in the country who aren't really fond of the Cardinal Archbishop of New York, and they resent having anything explained ~o him by the potentates of ~tate. But thts much must be said for the Bishops: at least, they are making the candidates speak out an accountability of ~heir ow!l points of view; that is not everythmg, but tt is something. Is it an intrusion of the Church into politics? Sure, but what the hell of it? We railed against the Bishops for not getting into politics by .failing to condemn the Vietnam War. We criticized them for dragging their feet in the Civil

Rights Movement. We are still embar­rassed by our fear that the Pope tried to do business with Hitler, and especially that he remained too comfortably silent about the deathcamps for the Jews. Now that we're faced with an issue that maybe even more consequential than Civil Rights, Vietnam, or the Holocaust, I'm not really worried about the Bishops trying to put the screws on Jimmy and Jerry. In the abortion issue, we've hit an iceberg, for God's sake; let's not worry whom we have sent out for the mittens. 
With the Bishops running interference, need we fear that abortion will seem like a Catholic issue (Le, mostly important to Catholics) as well as the Catholic issue, (i.e., the deepest concern that Catho~ics have in the campaign, with everythmg else, like World Hunger, being seco~­dary?) Well abortion is the ~athohc issue but it is also a human tssue. Hyst~rically, I suspect that our nation is approaching a crisis. wit~ abort~on .that, being self-induced, wtll brmg the JUSttce of the gods crashing down on our heads. I think it threatens us more than the possibility of planetary annihilat~on through bombs, or the failure of ecologtcal systems. As 'for world hunger, I hardly think we will abort ourselves to death without trying to impose abortion on the over-populated countries as a means, of trying to solve their problems for them. So much of what we may attempt to do to help the suffering nations is contingent on our own practice of abortion. 
I think I have a very great fear of death. Perhaps that fear makes me o.ver-sensitive in my reverence and awe for hfe. It seems to me mandatory for people to have a very great care in the procreation of life. ~Birth control information is so easily available today.) It seems mandatory, once they have created life, that people should have a very great care of defending it. They can't rip it up as they go, and still preserve their 

own decencies. 

The abortion issue is, I think, an awful mess. Jimmy Carter isn't going to solve it, and Jerry Ford isn't going to solve it, but please, don't let us beat the Bishops over the head; at least, they are registering a concern. We have been bitter at them in the past for not registering a concern. They shouldn't be made the bad guys of the campaign, the fellows wearing the. black hats (unless they're in uniform). At least we now know that between Jimmy and Jerry, as far as abortion stanas are concerned, there is not really much of a choice between the lesser of two evils. 
Politically astute prelates might have supported a coalition of Jews, Protestants, and Catholics to make inquiries of the candidates; instead, the Bishops sent themselves. God bless them for it. Even if their little machinations back fire, we should give them credit for trying to be witnesses. I, for one, am only a little embarrasseed by them. 
Anyway, Bill Toohey, after this emotion­al outpouring, Darby and I would certainly appreciate it if you would come over, and take both of us out for a walk, and maybe buy us ice cream. English toffee, please: a cone for me, a cup for Darby. 
And if you don't mind by saying so, Bill, I don't think the Bishops entirely blew it at 
all.---------~-----~----------,
magnificient meals in michiana: 
the down under 
It is not very close to campus (in the Ireland Square, just west of Scotsdale Mall). It is somewhat expensive, with meals ranging from about $5.00-$14.00. But for formals, birthdays, and graduation, many Domers head to the Down Under for their gastronomic gorging. 
As the name implies, the restaurant itself is down under the bar, which features live entertainment. The Qining room is decorated in a nodescript manner, featur-, ing booths and candlelit tables, and two semi-private wings (One with shelves of dime-store novels lining the walls). Such a setting will not disturb the placid diner. 
A waiting on the table as a appetizer was a basket of warm, inviting garlic toast, plus another basket of crackers and a small bowl of a zesty cheddar spread. These went down very smoothly with the redoubtable rye and gingers (Canadian Crown, $1..25). The service was performed well and m a friendly manner, though the waiter did confuse orders a couple of times. 
For openers, we indulged in the soup, which came with the meal. Fellow food critic Fred Herbst chose the hearty beef barley soup, preferred in a small, quai_nt, pewter kettle, which kept the soup teemmg hot. (Every course is placed on the pewter service.) The french onion soup I selected merited a good, though not spectacular rating. 
For the salad, special guest gourmet Gregg Bangs sampled the dinner salad of mixed lettuce, tomatoes, and french dress­ing. all of which he judged excellent. ,On the manager's recommendation, Herbst and I ventured on the Caesar's salad, a $4.95 concoction serving two. Perhaps because of its promotion as a "maitre-d's choice," the greenery proved something of

a disappointment. Mixed at the table, the 
salad consisted of a large plate of 
less-than-crisp lettuce with croutons, Ital­
ian dressing and parmesan cheese: 
Filling, but not enrapturing. 
In selecting the main course, one must decide if he is to sacrifice a bit of privacy for a bit of showmanship. In ordering the steak Dianne (also a Maitre-d's choice at $8.95), we encountered another course that was prepared at the table. Certainly, James is most proficient at his craft of tableside cooking (he made the salad, too), and a most personable fellow. But try to enjoy an intimate meal with a date when you might be splattered with grease (as was Herb~t), or when a· 3-foot ball of fire might suddenly blaze out, or when someone is just standing there the whole time. It might prove difficult. 
Should you care more about the food than possible distractions, the steak Di­anne will not let you down. Two round cuts of beef, they are broiled to order by James ; chew ever-so-tenderly, but release greai billows. The steak is marvelously comple­mented by a sauce mixed from the meat juice, Belgian mustard, a heavy cream, and a liquire, plus bits of onion and mushroom. Bangs complimented the New York steak he ordered as, "a tad charred on the outside, though on the inside, cooked in a manner that befits a great cut of beef.'' (In cidentally, it was broiled in the kitchen.) Accompanying the entree was a choice of potato. 
Over the years, the Down Under has acquired its reputation around NO, per­haps because the relatively high prices imply quality to many patrons. My meal could have been better, and Herbst felt let down, but Bangs enjoyed his. So, for the price, it deserves careful consideration before making the trek south.

INDIANAPOLIS AP-Democratic presidential candidate Jimmy Car­ter said yesterday that President Ford is running against his own record in the White House now that he has ''finally and somewhat reluctantly" taken the road to campaign. 
"Now we know why it took him so long," Carter said. The Georgian flew here from Saginaw, Michigan and at an airport news conference, issued a rebuttal to Ford's campaign opening speech at the University of Michigan Wed­

From here Carter was headed for Baltimore and finally Washington, there to meet with Greek-Ameri­cans and to address an Italian­American dinner-Ford also is to appear there, but their schedules provided that they wouldn't meet. Carter said here that Ford has endorsed programs that he vetoed when Democrats pushed them through Congress, citing as ex­amples bills to have the govern­ment supplement interest pay­ments so people can buy houses, public works and other bills. ''The Republican nominee is finally running, but it's his record that's his major opponent." Carter said. " ...It seems th,at the major 
Hearst to be sentenced 
By Bernard Hurwitz Associated Press Writer 

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) · Con­victed bank robber Patricia Hearst will be sentenced Sept. 24, more than a year after she was captured and her bizarre journey in the terrorist underground came to an end. 
U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick Jr. said yesterday that he will hear arguments from opposing sides during a morning session and impose punishment in the after­noon. 
Miss Hearst, 22, could receive as light a sentence as time served, or a maximum penalty of 35 years in prison. She was convicted March 20 of armed bank robbery and using a firearm in the commission of a felony. 
Defense attorney AI Johnson has previously said that he will file an appeal immediately after the sen­tencing. 
Miss Hearst has been under­going a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation at the San Diego Metro­politan Correction Center since April. That study was completed last nronth and submitted to Orrick. 
Miss Hearst's trial judge, the late Oliver J. Carter, ordered a 90-day testing at the request of the 
128 nor~h 
debate is going to between the Republican nominee and his per­formance in past years." 
Cart.~r said the Republicans are underestimating the intelligence and memory of the voters. "Mr. Ford hopes to make this campaign a battle of promises ... " Carter said. "Facts will be the basis of our campaign." ­
He said he believes he can beat Ford despite public opinion surveys that indicate concern among voters about exactly what he "stands for, and added that the trust of the people can be measured only on election day. 
"My assessment is that the 
people do trust me adequately to 
win a good victory in November," 
he said. 
Ford had made "trust" the 
central theme of his Ann Arbor 
speech Wednesday night, saying, 
"It is not enough for anyone to say 
'trust me'. Trust must be earned.'' 
Carter issued a written state-· 
ment of rebuttal to the Ford 
speech, citing statistics he said 
show that Ford's pledges were 
empty ones. 
He said there are 2.5 million 
more people unemployed now than 
when Ford took office. "Mr. Ford 
talks about jobs but he vetoed 
every major job proposal that came 
before him," Carter said. 
U.S. Labor Department statistics show there were 4. 9 million unem­
defendant's attorneys. After Carter's death of heart failure in June, Orrick extended the study. 
The newspaper heiress, kid­napped by the terrorist Symbionese Liberation Army on Feb. 4, 1974, testified during her eight-week trial that she participated in the April 15, 1974, bank robbery in fear of her life. She said she did not surrender because she feared the SLA or the FBI would kill her if she 
did.  
She has  been in cu stody since  
her  arrest  last  Sept.  18  in  San  
Francisco.  

Community org. to hold meeting 
Community Services, a campus volunteer organization which oper­ates through the residence halls, will sponsor a meeting Sunday, Sept. 19 at 7 p.m. in the basement of Badin Hall for all students interested in participating.

ployed in a work force of 91.1 when Ford took office in August 1974. Last month there were 7.5 million, in a work force of 95.5 million, an increase of about 2.6 million. 
He said Ford talked of concern about housing, but blamed ad­ministration policies for rising pri­ces, interest rates and unmploy­ment in the housing industry. 
Carter cited specifically the veto of the Emergency Housing Act of 1975, which the Democrat said would have increased housing starts by 400,000, created 800,000 new jobs and provided federal 
subsidies to reduce mortgage rates.

Daniel P. Moynihan won the support of Bella S. Abzug, one of his opponents in the New York primary, in his campaign for Uni­ted States Senator from New York. 
According to a story in the New York Times, Moynihan will be out to win the seat from Senator James 
L. Buckley who kicked off his campaign by describing Moynihan as "to the left of the majority of New Yorkers on such basic issues as inflation and the economy and the extent of Federal meddling in our lives." 
The Times stated tat Moynihan received 327,478 votes to 317,905 votes for Abzug giving Moynihan a one percent winning margin in the five-way Democratic primary race.

Ford's campaign is "being ruled by hard numbers," the Sept. 15 AP story states, that indicate (he) will concentrate his efforts in ten key states, and his strategists concede that the "battle is uphill." 
Jim Baker, Ford campaign man­ager. points out that these 'ten states will be where the ''final duel" between Ford and Carter will take place. 256 of the 270 electorate votes needed to win will be decided in these states.

While Ford workers are con­centrating their efforts in these-primarily northern and eastern states, the President's own poll­ster, Robert Teeter of Market Opinion Research, is finding unex­pected strength for the Republican candidate in the South.

Hoosier candidates face off 
by Marc Rosenwasser Associated Press Writer 

Candidates for Indiana's highest political offices toned own their criticism of one another yesterday just long enough to talk about the issues. But the day was not without its usual share of political barbs. _ 
Republican Gov. Ohs R. Bowen and Democratic challenger Larry 
A. Conrad, fresh from a sparring match over the state's tax struc­ture, turned their attention to mental health care; U.S. Sen. Vance Hartke spoke of the nation's declining economic growth, and former Indianapolis Mayor Richard Lugar addressed the question of federal estate taxes. 
Bowen said his administration

has concentrated its efforts on the prevention of mental illness and has taken a more localized ap­proach to the problem. 
''This approach is less dramatic than une which massively uproots, tears down, relocates and reorgan­izes, but it is also an approach which is capable of being reali­zed,' Bowen said. 
Conrad, who joined the governor at the Indian Mental health Asso­ciation's 1976 leadership confer­ence at Indianapolis, said the state must commit itself to a timetable for rapid completion of community health care centers. 
Taking aim at Bowen without mentioning his name, Indiana's secretary of state said, "We may innovate administratively, ~nd build physically, but until the governor takes the lead in advoca­ting programs and policies diagnose, treat and protect patients, Indiana will continue to offer less than the finest of mental health care." 
Hartke heard his praises hursday morning by presidential nominee Jimmy ter, who said the senator candidate "in whom I have dence" during a press <'nonf"""''""' in Indianapolis. 
Carter denied reports that he attempting to keep some distance between himself and the three­term senator, who is belived to be running behind.

HAMMOND, Ind. (AP) -A three-judge federal panel ruled yesterday a minor doesn't need parental consent to get an abortion within the first three months Of pregnancy, bringing the Indiana abortion law in line with a recent 
U.S. Supreme Court decision. 
In their ruling, 7th U.S. Circuit Court Judge Robert Sprecher and 
U.S. District Court Judges Jesse Eschbach and Allan Sharp also barred the state from enforcing that portion of the law. ' 
"It's good that the government recognizes that such a decision is a very serious, personal matter,'' said Dell Chumley, a spokeswoman for the Indiana Women's Political Caucus. 
"Abortion is something that a· person has to consider very ser­iously, and that certainly can't be done when someone else is making the decision for that person." 
Indiana Right to Life, Inc., an anti-abortion group, said the panel's decision was inevitable, based on the Supreme Court's July 1 ruling that states may not require a woman seeking an abortion to obtain consent of her husband or of 
St. Mary's tourguides recruited 

A "Punch and Dip" Party was held at Stapleton Lounge at St. Mary's for all SMC students inter­ested in being tourguides and hostesses for incoming freshmen. At the meeting approximately twenty-five girls were informed on tour procedures and were given background information about St. Mary's. 
"Tours are an important factor in a students decision to come to St. May's. For most, it is their first experience with the the school ...and they learn what college classes and dorm life are really like," commented Betty Miller, a member of the Admissions staff. The tour also enables these girls to ask questions that they would feel uncomfortable asking members of the faculty or Admissions Office. 
The girls who signed up to work as tourguides are excited and looking forward to meeting the upcoming, students and their par­ents. "It was a riot." commented a girl who gave tours last year. "I had the best time showing these girls around SMC...they really appreciate your. efforts." Another girl added that when she came 
down to visit, "everyone was so,....--------------------------~-~-----------~--------------.

do the same for these girls."

(continued from page 9). 
It was those economic issues that Hrtke addressed at a luncheon meeting of the Exchange Club in Muncie. 
''The disastrous policies of the Nixon-Ford Administration have resulted in depressed production and high unemployment rates and have produced federal deficits to­taling $242 billion," Hartke said. The senator also said he has sponsored legislation to create a permanent tax credit of 10 percent to stimulate plant investment. 
At a meeting of the Terre Haute Kiwanis Club, Republican nominee Lugar said, ''the existing estate tax system is seriously outmoded, years out of date with the realities o1 today's farm values." 
He praised a House-Senate con-1 ference committee report that recommended reductions in federal 1 estate .taxes, which, Lugar said, "have forced many young farmers to sell family farms just to pay unfairly high tax bills." ..

her parent or guardian if she's under 18. 
''The absurdity of the Supreme Court's ruling has come home to Indiana," the group said in a statement. "Parental consent is needed before a minor can have her .;ars pierced, but to get an abor­tion, she is strictly left to her own judgment." 
Judge Sharp said he signed the order ''with the greatest reluc­tance," adding that he thought the Supreme Court's decision was questionable. 
"One of the basic ideas of Western thought has been the sacredness of human life at all stages," he said. The decision, Sharp said, reduced the fetus to ''a non-person and deprives it of constitutional protection." 
Despite the federal ban on enforcing the permission section of the Indiana statute, Don Bogard of the Indiana attorney general's office said: "We haven't made any decision on that issue yet. We will take a look at the situation anc decide a course of action within 3C days." 
The panel's decision was based on a 1974 lawsuit filed in U.S. 
District Court here by the Gary­Northwest Indiana Women's Serv­ices, Inc.; its Hammond director, Dr. William Lewis; and three pregnant minors. 
Carter's mike shut off 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -Jimmy Carter's microphone shut off sud-· denly yesterday as the Democratic president nominee was criticizing Indiana Republican Gov. 0tis R. Bowen for refusing to debate his opponent. 
It happened just as Carter was getting to the punch. 
"I think anyone who refuses to debate the issues in an important election like... " Carter said as the microphone went dead. 
He paused a few minutes as aides scurried to corrett the prob­lem, then said as the p'ower came back: "You can see what Republi­cans think about debates." ' 
The point, by the way, was that not debating was a sign of mistrust.

Retarded child dies alone, ignored by family 
MIAMI (AP) · It took three days to find Lisa's parents after she died at the Sunrise School for the retarded. She had been brought to the school four years ago and never had a visitor. 
Lisa died Sunday when she choked during breakfast. While she was eating prunes, she began to shake and choking sounds came from her throat. 
"When they carried her into the nursing station, she was uncon­scious," said school director Leslie Leech. "She had stopped breath­ing." 
A rescue squad failed to revive the 7-year-old girl. 
She had been carrfed to her breakfast that morning. School employees said what she had want­ed to do most in her troubled life was walk. 
"She could crawl around the floor, but she was trying hard to walk and whenever she took a step, her face would light up," said social worker Mary Miskey.

ND looks to rebound a ainst Purdue 
by Fred Herbst Sports Editor 

With the nightmare of Tony Dorsett past, Notre Dame hopes to awaken tomorrow against tradition­al rival Purdue in an attempt to redeem themselves from last week's crushing defeat. 
·'An opening game defeat can ruin an entire season if you let it," Irish co-captain Willie Fry said. "Our job is not to let this happen and we'll work as hard as we can in order to bounce back.'· 
While the Irish are faced with the prospect of bouncing back, Purdue hopes to keep rolling. Last week the Boilermakers trounced North­western 31-19. Furthermore, in 
their last ll games at Notre Dame,
the Boilermakers have won seven, the most recent a 31-20 upset in 1974 that ended an Irish 13 game winning streak. 
''Purdue has a veteran team that is hungry for success," Irish head mentor Dan Devine said. ''Their 
opening game victory means they'll be coming in here with momentum and confidence in both their of­fense and defense. Our job is simply to forget what happened this past week and treat this week's game as another beginning." 
For this week's "beginning" to be a success for the Irish they must eliminate the errors that plagued them against Pitt. ''Of course we made mistakes,'' Devine said, ''the kind of mistakes a young team will make. the kind that we simply can't afford to make again." 
"The biggest factor in our im­

provement is time," Devine com­mented. "We need time to get used to playing with each other. I think the more experienced we get, the better we'll be." 
Notre Dame's defense will re­main the same as last week with the exception of defensive tackle 
Jeff Weston. Weston was lost to 
the team for the season last week when he injured a knee. His loss was complicated by the suspension of Jay Case for academic reasons. 
Fred Herbst 
Ken Dike, who took Weston's spot last Saturday, will get the starting nod this week. "I must say that Ken Dike did a tremendous job against Pitt considering he'd never played a down before Saturday,'' Devine noted. 
Tony Dorsett is gone, but the Irish will again face a premier back in Scott Dierking. Dierking, Pur­due's leading rusher each of the last two seasons, ran for 151 yards on 27 carries against Northwestern last week. 
Dierking is joined in the Boiler­maker backfield by John Skibinski and quarterback Mark Vitali. Skib­inski rushed for 88 yards against Northwestern while Vitali connec­ted on 5 of 11 passes for 83 yards. 
Vitali's favorite target is split
end Jesse Townsend. Tight end Nigel Wirgowski and flanker Reg­gie Arnold round-out the Purdue receiving corps. 
Forming the front wall for the Boilermakers are John LeFeber and Dave Lafary at the tackles, Tom 
Gibson and Connie Zelencik at the guards and Jay Venzin at center. 
The Irish offense will also remain the same as it was last week. Jerome Heavens, who paced the Notre Dame offense against Pitt, will again be called upon to carry the bulk of the offensive burden. 
Purdue will counter with a defense that boasts Heaven's high school rival Cleveland Pittsburgh Crosby at tackle. He's joined at the other tackle by Chris Barr and at the ends by Blane Smith and Kim Cripe. The linebackers are Mike Burgamy, Bob Mannella and Ken Loushin. 
The secondary has converted wide receiver Paul Berry at strong safety, Pat Harris at free safety, Jerome King at one corner and 
three-year starter Mike Northing-ton at the other. 
Boilermaker linebacker Bob Mannella interestingly dates the older sister (Mitzi) of Irish quarter­back Rick Slager's wife (Kris). 
Tomorrow's game will be the 48th in the intrastate rivalry. Notre 

who didn't pick a rash of upsets. Top-ranked teams like Southern Cal, Alabama, Texas and California fell victim while mighty Nebraska was held to a tie by little-respected LSU in the first week of the season. 
Michigan, Ohio State and Pittsburg proved to be the powers that many felt they would be, each scoring convincing triumphs. In all it was an interesting week in college football. Despite the early season losses, no team is eliminated from contention for the top spot at the end of the season since it appears there's a good chance that this year'sNational Champion will have a blemish on its record. So with the help of the "Wizard of Vegas", Gregg Bangs, here are The Irish Eye's picks for the weekend: 
Alabama at SMU: The Bear didn't appreciate last week's performance by the Tide against Ole Miss. After an opening season loss to Missouri last year Barna rolled to 11 straght wins and you can bet that they would like to do it again. Look for the Tide to roll. Barna by 10. Bangs: Barna by 17. Arizona at UCLA: Arizona hopes to fare better against the. Bruin~ than their neighbors from down-the-road did last week, but UCLA 1s commg off an extremely impressive rout of Arizona State. The Wildcats are tough, but Jeff Dankworth is super. UCLA by 7. Bangs: UCLA by 10. California at Oklahoma: This promises to be one of the weekend's outstanding games. California was upset by Georgia last week. and needs a win badly to get on track. Oklahoma isn't the team that ~t was la~t season, but they're still awesome. On the strength of Joe Roth s arm, 1t s the Golden Bears by 3. Bangs: California by 3. South Carolina at Duke: The Blue Devils scored a stunning upset over a powerful Tennessee club last Saturday, so they're obviously tough. The Gamecocks, on the otherhand, have one of the most underated teams in the nation. Buoyed by two one thousand yard backs and a quarter?ack that picked the Georgia Tech secondary apart last week. South Carohna by 4. Bangs: Gamecocks by 14. Pittsburgh at Georgia Tech: The Yellowjackets were upset by South Carolina last Saturday at home and need a win badly. Notre Dame found out last week just how good the Panthers are. Tony Dorsett is on artificial turf this week and he's almost certain to get his one hundred-plus yards. Pitt might not be beaten all year. Pitt by 10. Bangs: Pitt by 10. 
Penn at Dartmouth: What could be better than a football showdown in the Ivy League? Just about anything. Penn is traditionally an Ivy contender as i~ Dartmouth. Watch for the play of defensive tackle Greg Robinson to lead the green andwhite,past the tigers. Big Greeri by 6. Bangs: Darmouth by 7. Ball State at Miami [O.]:As ifyou can't tell, Miami is the Irish Eye's "pet team." Each of the last two weeks the Redskins have been upset, last week by lowly Marshall. Still it's hard to say no to Miami. Ball State is tough, and they're improving constantly. In fact, Ball State has the longest winning streak in the nation with 8. Miami of Ohio by 7. Bangs: Ball State by 3.

Notre Dame's hopes for victory tomorrow hinge on their ability to contain 
leading rusher Scott Dierking. Dame holds a 28-17-2 advantage in the series that dates back to 1896. Since 1957 the game has been contested for the "Shillelagh" Trophy, with the Boilermakers holding a 10-9 edge in the last 19 years. 
Last season in West Lafayette, the largest crowd ever to see a football game in the state of Indiana (69, 795) watched Notre Dame shutout Purdue 17-0. The game was closely contested until Luther Bradley intercepted a pass and returned it 99 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter to break the game open. 
Dave Reeve moved closer to Notre Dame's career field goals mark with his 53-yard field goal against Pitt last week. The boot, an Irish record and the longest ever 
kicked in Notre Dame stadium, gives the junior 19 career field goals. Bob Thomas holds the school record, having kicked 21 in his 
career. 

Ross Browner is now within one Kickoff is set for 1:30 p.m. The fumble recovery of tying the Notre tilt will be broadcast over the Dame career mark held by Jim Mutual Radio Network by Don Stock. Stock recovered eight fum­Criqui and Pat Sheridan and locally bles in his three seasons with the by WSND. The game will also be Irish. telecast on WNDU-TV. 
With tomorrow's game the Irish enter into the "Big Ten" portion of .--------------­
their schedule as Northwestern and Michigan State follow Purdue for Notre Dame over the next two weeks. Overall against Big Ten teams the Irish are 147-68-13.

meanwhile are coming off one of their biggest wins ever, crushing Southern Cal last week in Los Angeles. It's doubtful that Missouri is for real but no one will find out tomorrow. Missouri by 14. Bangs: Missouri by 10. 
Nebraska at Indiana: Only one thing could be worse than playing against the awesome Cornhuskers, and that's playing them after th.ey've just been tied. Nebraska is out to prove that last week was a m1stake and Indiana will pay the price. Nebraska by 21. Bangs: Cornhuskers by 24. 
Syracuse at Iowa: Iowa is trying to rebuild, but it has been a slow and 
painful process for them. Syracuse is also rebuilding under Frank Ma­
loney and appear to be making considerable progress, despite last week's 
loss to Bowling Green. Watch for super frosh Mandell Robinson to begin 
earning that famous number 44 (Jim Brown, Ernie Davis, Floyd Little) 
that the Orange brought out of retirement for him. Syracuse by 3. Bangs: 
The Orange by 3. 

Baldwin Wallace at Lehigh: Savage John Matt led the Engineers to a con­
vincing triumph over powerful Kutztown State l~st week and he's ex­
pected to do the same this week. Lehigh is probably the best team in 
Division II and they won't be beaten by a Division II school this season. Lehigh by 8. Bangs: Lehigh by 14. Stanford at Michigan: The Cardinals gave Penn State a scare last week before finally losing by three. They'll do the same this week with Mich­igan, but the Wolverines are just too good to lose this week. In fact, it appears as if the Ohio State game may be their only test of the year. Mich­igan by 14. Bangs: Michigan by 20. 
Northwestern at North Carolina: Northwestern is an improved club, but not improved enough. North Carolina is beginning to look as if they're for real with two opening season wins under their belt. Tomorrow they'll have be 3-0. The Tarheels by 14. Bangs: North Carolina by 6. Southern Cal at Oregon: Southern Cal is a lot better than they appeared last Saturday night. Missouri is tough, but that was a fluke. Look for 1 
Ricky Bell and USC to take out their frustrations from last week on the Ducks. Trojans by 17. Bangs: USC by 14. 
UPSET OF THE WEEK: 

Ohio State at Penn State: Ohio State rolled last week over a demoralized 
Michigan State club. Still, ~espite t~eir lack. of. oppo~iti~n t~ey were 
impressive. Penn State wasn t overly tmpresstve m thetr ttlt wtth Stan­
ford. The Nittany Lions are young and somewhat inexperienced and 
shouldn't be too much trouble for Woody's bad boys. But while you may 
not always bet with Joe Paterno when he's at home, you never bet against 
him. He's probably the best coach in the country and if there's a way to 
win a game, ~~~find it. Penn State by 3. Bangs: Herbst, dream on. 
Ohio State by'!&. 

LAST WEEK: an impressive 6-8-1, 43.3 pet.

Captain's Corner 
Revisiting last Saturday may 
help us as a team, but will be 
even more helpful to the "great­
est" student body in America. 
The team, myself included, play­
ed poorly, as poorly as the 
students acted. Any fan who 
would boo a ballplayer on the 
.field is, in my estimation, show­
ing his/her ignorance. What kind 
of incentive is it to enter the game 
on your own 5 yard line and have 
the "home" fans booing? I realize 
there are many other fans besides 
the students, but the students do 
have a responsibility to support 
the team. 
Knowing the offense, the strat­
egy for the game, and the 
personnel, I realize the injustice 
of one player taking the blame for 
11 people when offense screws 
up. There were many assignment 
mistakes and offensive break­
downs that caused quarterback 
sacks and interceptions. Many of 
the mistakes were directly attrib­
uted to the quarterback. 
If the fans (students included) 
knew what the hell offensive 
football was all about, there 
would b<: no booing. Offense is a 
team game. Team discipline and 
coordinated work are the key to 
success on offense. I grant you 
the Notre Dame team did not play 
like Notre Dame, but, then again, 
the fans were not true Notre 
Dame, either. I always felt ND 
was above bush-league tactics. 
Since the winter of 1976, the team has been preparing for the season. The winter workouts, spring drills, summer workouts and the hell-like two-a-days, were all aimed towards Pitt. There are seniors on the team, who al­though they will never play, bust their humps for the good of the team. 
If those seniors can stick it out and work as hard as those playing, the least the students can do is to show some confidence in the team. I believe some sign of support is due the Notre Dame Football team. The years I've been at ND, the greatest sign of spirit has been the tunnel formed for the team as they enter the field. I do believe this student body is the best in the country, and I also believe they will rise to· the occasion. 
GOOD LUCK TO US ALL!!!
