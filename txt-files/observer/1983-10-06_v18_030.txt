Scholastic: Quality i m proving? 
It's out. Scholastic the monthly student magazine of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's hit the streets last Friday. 
Reactions to the magazine's first issue, however, were mixed. While some praised its quality by calling it a "fine example of journalistic talent," others accused Scholastic of ingratiating itsdf to students and faculty members. One student even compared the issue to a "had high school newspaper." 
Such conflicting comments may he common for any college publication, but Jim Ganther, Scholastic's editor-in-chid. doesn't take such reader feedback light· ly. "Scholastic has made a 4uantum leap in the last five years," he says. Gamher recalls the late 1970s when the magazine ran only 16 pages per issue, a downturn whi<..-h even prompted a Notre Dame administrator to suggest Scholastic cease publishing.

Beth Healey Preuss. last year's editor-in-chief, was not as ecstatically received by administrators as was \X'ood. One administrator remarked that Wood's high literary standards may have "spoiled" Scholastic readers, and said the magazine under Preuss failed w reach the literary standards of Wood. Preuss, now working for Notre Dame's University Press, disagrees. 
Scholastic began paying its editors and doing its own layout for the first time last year, said Preuss. According to Preuss, quality at the magazine remained high while students became more involved in the production of 
the magazine. 

Such a change in the financial policy of the magazine promptcd University administrators to become "ridiculous" about finances, according to Preuss. Even with the new salaries, Scholastic was able to save the University over 51,000 through revamped advertising

and circulation programs, she says. 

But more important than saving money, Preuss was able to bring together faculty, students, and ad­ministrators. Scholastic editors met with four faculty members and one administrator each semester to help 
the students assess editorial policies, she says. 

Preuss hoped such a advisory committee would help overcome the two greatest handicaps of any student­run organization: students who will not "admit to their own ignorance," and faculty members "who won't 
devote themselves to the 
 
however, he has changed the philosophy established by Wood and Preuss who Ganther says were "too wrapped up in themes." 
Ganther says hc wants to make Scholastic less of a "soapbox" and more of a 
justice." 

Because he is a finance 
major, Ganther considers himsdf"a little bit more prag­
matic" than former editors-in-chid, most ofwhom have 
been enrolled in the College ofArts and Letters. He also 
contends he knows what students want to read: sports. general news. and and no more than "two or three ar­.tides" on a specific topic. 
But ifthe editorial policies ofWood and Preuss mean anything, Ganther's new philosophy of makingScholas­tic into a general interest magazine free of thematic guidelines may create many difficulties for the 
magazine. Wood and Preuss knew St-·holastic's purpose was to offer a publication through which students and faculty members could comment on complicated issues. And two or three articles just don't seem to be enough.

Toxic dumps violate permits 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Congressional investigators reported yesterday that 78 percent of the hazardous waste dumps they checked this'sum­mer were violating their federal per­mits by not monitoring for possible leaks of toxic chemicals into drink­ing water supplies. 
Two influential congressmen said they were "shocked," and vowed to ask the House to provide for criminal prosecution of dump operators who deliberately ignore health safeguards imposed by federal law. 
The sample survey of state pollu­tion officials in North Carolina and Illinois was conducted by the General Accounting Office, the in­vestigative arm of Congress, which found that 78 percent of the dumps operating under so-called "interim status pemits" were not checking for groundwater pollution, as re­quired. In Illinois, the GAO said, 33 of 38 sites were not meeting re­quirements, and in North Carolina, 18 of27 sites were not complying. 
In two other states surveyed, the GAO said, Massachusetts and

TUCSON, Ariz. President Reagan declared five counties disas­ter areas yesterday in flooded sout­heast Arizona, and forecasters warned a hurricane in the Pacific could bring more unwanted rain.

tentatively set at more than S300 million with I0 people dead and five missing. 
In what's being called Arizona's worst disaster of the century, American Red Cross surveys indi­cated about 3,000 houses, mobile homes, and apartment units had been destroyed or damaged by the 
flooding  that  began  over  the  
weekend.  The  numbers were  ex­ 
pected to climb.  

California state officials did not 
know how many sites were in com­
pliance because few had been 
checked. 
The GAO said underground water 
pollution "is the most serious poten­
tial threat to human health and the 
environment posed by the disposal of hazardous waste." An estimated 1,350 sites nationwide are subject to the groundwater monitoring re­quirement. 
In addition, the GAO said, neither the Environmental Protection Agency, which issues the permits, nor state officials are making sure dump operators are complying with financial requirements intended to ensure that dumps can be safely closed when full and then main­tained, and that adequate insurance against accidents has been obtained. 
The GAO study was released by Rep. james Florio, 0-N.j., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee with jurisdiction over hazardous wastes, and Rep. Norman F. Lent of New York, the panel's senior Republican. 
Florio said that even the minimal health precautions required by the interim permits were not being 
The Red Cross put out a call for more volunteer nurses Tuesday night as it opened a 16th emergency shdter -the I'; others housing more than 2,900 people -to ac­commodate evacuees from the Hol­ly Acres subdivision southwest of Phoenix. 
About half of the subdivision's 300 rt::,iut:nts left their homes Tues­day night because of heavy flow in the combined Gila and Salt Rivers. They returned yesterday after the water receded more than a foot. 
Reagan's declaration will free federal funds for assistance in Green­lee, Pima, Santa Cruz, Graham and Pinal counties. Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who toured flood-stricken areas around Tucson on Wednesday, had asked for federal aid to I0 counties. 
Bob Blair, a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman in Washington, said federal and state officials were still assessing damages and that other counties might be added to the list. 
carried out. The interim permits are supposed to be temporary, pending more t·ompreht·nsive permanent licensing, and con:r nearly all legal dump sites in the country 
Tht· GAO said through July 19H3. 
2-t of an estimated H.OOO facilities 
expected to require permits had 
received their permant·nt licenses, 
and the process of lit·ensing the rest 
could takt· another I0 years. 
The interim pt·rmits require dump operators to install monitor­ing wells around their sites and take periodic samples to indicatt· whether wastes have leaked from the site and are seeping toward un­derground watt:'f supplies. 
The GAO said state officials at· 
tributed the lack of compliance to 
the technical complexity and costs 
ofdoing so. A North Carolina offkial 
was quoted as saying that it costs 
about S4,000 to install a monitoring 
well and about S12,800 for thr first 
year's sampling.

Ayoung man is unable to cross to his side: of the city. His job -no, his livt:lihood, lies hc:yond the guns which cripple Beirut. He worries about the bounty placed on his head, and the heads of his brothc:rs. With courage and conviction ht· dc:fies the threat for his family's sake. 
A young woman leaves her country for medical school in the States. Isolated for a timt' from the horror of her homt:land, she plans to rt'turn as soon as possible. Her only reminder comes on the weekend, when she turns on the TV. The New England Patriots and New York Jets appear, not as football tt'ams, but warring factions in her hellish country. 
A mother holds her blood-drained child who wailed, though he could not understand. 
His mother cries because she  understands.  
Somehow  she  survives  the  ordeal,  and  
manages to calm her children.  

A professor teaches a class, ignoring a huge knife jabbed into the chalkboard, complete with a death threat. Later, a student threatens to kidnap and murder his loved ones. The stu­dt'nt seeks a passing grade, hut the teacher does not acquiesce, refusing to share in the: t'Vil which infects his homeland. 
Outside Lebanon are relatives and friends who worry. They write letters often, as do the Lebanese. But the postal service rarely gets mail into or out of the country, and after a while: both sides stop writing. 

Lebanon suffers a terminal illness, but never dies. It screams with intense pain, but never passes out. It is a wound whose scab is picked repeatedly when nearly healed. 
Many ofits people have a nearly foolish faith that, when all the foreigners leave, the Druse and the Maronites will settle their differences. 
The Turks, the French, the U.S., the P.L.O., the Syrians, and the Israelis have all played with Lebanon, nearly trampling her to death. 
But the Lebanese have not given up. They are a strong-willed people who stare at Death daily, but refuse to give in.

My anger at the disgusting crime is ex­

their t"hildrt·n on tht' the weekends. Those who want to go out cannot find baby-sitters. So many pt.·ople have decided to install security systems that companies are unable to mn·t the demand. 
My family is as scared as any other family in the neighborhood. My mom sleeps very little at night and is extremely careful when she's alone: at home. The entire family makes sure that every door and window is locked at night. The practice never seemed necessary before. My father has even considered buying a gun and taking lessons. a drastic step in everyone's 
eyes, including his own. Now that I've seen what the murders have done to my neighborhood, I see my family in a little different light. Somehow when you're away at school, it's easy to let your family slip to the back ofyour mind. Thoughts of school become more important than thoughts of home, and contact can be limited to an oc­casional phone call or letter. Even if it is pos­sible to keep in touch, thoughts of one's parents often end when the phone is hung up, or the letter is put away. I'm as guilty as anyone. From now on, I'll try very hard to think of them. Now I see my family in a different 
perspective. Academic problems, which one time seemed severe, now seem a bit less im­portant. At least I can understand their impor­
tance more clearly. I think about my family

Although Vonderheide cites many bands, his m isconc.·eptions oftheir music is clear. The epitome of these misconceptions is his catc:gorizatinn of Haircut One Hundred's sound as "funk". Any New Music listener knows that Haircut's English Ska is situated at the opposite end of the music spectrum from urban (.'Ont'm(>(lrary funk. 
Furthermore. we find Vonderheide's gross gent·ralizations about certain groups and their 
music frustrating. For example, every song which New Order has recorded does not have a "breakneck pace" that is danceable; has Von­
derheide heard "Your Silent Face" and "We Stand Alone," two songs on New Order's latest album? Similarly, every song on Madness' al· bum carries a different beat and tempo. 
From the first sentence of his article Von­derheide reveals his myopic outlook on music. He seems unwilling to accept any new music, let alone new bands from England. 
Vonderheide is not only dosing his ears, he is closing his mind to everything that British New Music has to offer. It is a shame that his article focused on the rejection of British music, instead ofSpandau Ballet's "True."

more often now, not just when I get a letter or 
a phone call. 

It's a shame that it takes a tragedy to make people see the importance of the people around them. Death puts things into perspective so harshly. Too many times it's too late when we remember how important those close to us really are. Despite crammed schedules and vitally important tests, each of us should take more time to remember our family and friends who are so special to us. 
Don't wait for a tragedy to think about those important to you. Sit down today and write a letter to a friend you haven't talked to in a long time. Or invest in a phone call tonight to tell your parents how much you love them. Ifyou don't take th& time to put things into perspective, you may not get the chance.

Upon reading the many recent articles and letters on the "Men of Notre Dame" calendar, I feel obliged to add my two cents worth.

One of our vemerable security guards naughtily enticing us to come on campus with our cars? Or how about an anonymous Notre Dame quarterback out for a leisurely run with an opposing defensive line joining him? I think

I 
.,
W
ith the barra~e of"How-To" literature that has hit the market durin~ the last decade, one at first glance must wonder why yet 
I
another ofthese books is necessary. After readin~ G. Brown's "How 
I 
I
To Survive Your College Daze"(New View Press; $5.95), it's obvious that such a book is both unnecessary and is frequently insultin~ to the reader's intelli~ence. Brown attempts to take the point ofview of an experienced older sibling as he communicates the "facts" about colle~e in a unique conversational style. 
The book is divided into four sections, each providin~ advice on a particular area ofcollege life. 
Brown first elaborates on "Gettin~ There." Topics discussed un­der this headin~ include the application process, financial aid, urban versus rural settin~s. distance from home, SAT scores, and packing. The guidance offered here could be somewhat helpful, but is cer­tainly nowhere near complete. Atotal oftwenty-nine pa~es are spent 
discussin~ what are some ofthe most important decisions a college­
bound senior will make. The discussion ofschools is thus rather in­
complete at best and it seems that a decent hi~h school counselor I 
would be much more valuable to the potential college freshman I 
than Brown's book. 

Brown's next two sections, "Bein~ There," and "A Giant Slumber I 
I 
Party," seemed to be somewhat more pertinent to the average col­
I. lege freshman than the first section. Herein is found the information I 
I 
that many ~uidance counselors cannot provide, includin~ thou~hts 
on subjects such as roommates, college food, prank.-., alcohol, sex, 
I
the fraternityI sorority system, and a plethora ofothers. Brown's con­
i
versational style and "older sibling approach" to the material become a bit more appropriate in these sections, althou~h he is of­ten tasteless. A typical excerpt from this section demonstrates his style. 
Always have something in you stomach before you start drinking . .. You want to get bombed, but ifyou blow chunks, you want to have something down there instead ofgoing through the dreaded dry heaves. 
Thi'i reviewer saw two basic problems with this section ofthe 
book. First, it seems to exaggerate the extent to which most colle~e 
freshmen become involved in the areas ofdrugs, sex, and alcohol 
abuse. All students do not need a lecture on the use ofspeed, heroin, 
cocaine, quaaludes, painkillers, and mushrooms just to get throu~h

Netters capture tourney 
The Notre Dame men's tennis team made an impressive showing in winning the 14th annual Irish Fall In­vitational Tennis Tournament last weekend here at the Courtney Courts. 
It was the first time since the tournament began in 1970 that Coac.h Tom Fallon's squad has won back-to-back titles. The Irish, 3-0 for the tournament, had to defeat a tough Southern Illinois team in or· der to claim the tournament victory. 
Southern Illinois, 2-1, finished second, while Illinois State and Wisconsin-Oshkosh, J-2 and 0-3 respectively, rounded out the stand­ings. 
"I think we played very well," Coach FaUon said of his team's per· formance. 
And play very well they did, disposing of Wisconsin-Oshkosh and Illinois State by identical tallies of 9-0 and beating Southern Illinois, 
8-1.

Todd Cruz, who later would turn in several fielding gems to keep the game close, let this one get by him, though, as the speedy Law raced home uncontested. 
The White Sox scored without a hit in the sixth. McGregor walked Paciorek leading off. Luzinski then hit a squibber toward first, and Mur­ray let it get under his glove for an error as Paciorek raced to third. Ron Kittle's doubleplay grounder scored Paciorek. 
Dempsey led offthe bottom ofthe sixth with the third hit off Hoyt but then was erased -almost literally -on a foreceout. Bumbry hit a grounder to second. Dempsey was forced out easily, but rookie shortstop Scott Fletcher's sidewind­ing throw hit Dempsey in the hand as he was protecting his face. 
Perhaps suffering from the rain delay, McGregor's outing took yet another perilous turn inthe seventh, when he left in favor of Sammy Stewart. 
He walked Vance Law to start the inning, then balked him to second. Law was sacrificed to third. When McGregor threw a pitch in the dirt past catcher Dempsey, Law tried to score. But Dempsey scrambled after the ball, threw a strike to McGregor and Law was out. 
McGregor then walkedJulio Cruz, 

and  Rudy  Law  doubled,  chasing  
McGregor  and  sending  Cruz  to  
third.  But  Stewart  fanned  Fisk  

looking, and McGregor had exited after giving up just one earned run. He had been bested at his own game -finesse and precision. 
L.A. 4, Phila. 1 

.LOS ANGELES -Pedro Guerrero drilled a two-out, two-run triple in the fifth inning, breaking a tie and pushing the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 4-l victory in last night's second game of the National League Cham­pionship Series. 
The Los Angeles triumph tied the best-of-five pennant playoff at 1-1. Game Three is scheduled for tomor­row in Philadelphia with Charles Hudson starting for the Phillies against the Dodgers' Bob Welch. 
Guerrero's shot rewarded the pitching of Fernando Valenzuela, who scattered seven hits before Tom Niedenfuer took over in the ninth. John Denny, a 19-game win­ner during the regular season, was the loser. 
Actually, it was Valenzt,~ela who got the winning rally started, opening the fifth with a drive that sent Garry Maddox to the center field wall. Maddox, who made a cru­cial error in the fourth game of the 1978 playoff between these teams, caught the ball for an instant but . then dropped it as he fell on the warning track. Valenzuela steamed into third base on the error. 
Just when it looked like the rally would fizzle, Dusty Baker worked Denny for a walk, bringing up Guer­rero. Steve Carlton had pitched around the Dodgers' cleanup hitter in Tuesday night's opener. But Den­ny couldnt escape. On a 2-2 pitch, Guerrero sent a shot into right field that scooted past Sixto Lezcano for a triple, scoring Brock and Baker with earned runs and putting Los Angeles in control.
