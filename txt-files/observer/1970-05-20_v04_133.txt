Another part of the campaign to inform bishops consists of having seniors write letters. Notre Dame seniors have already been contacted about signing this letter; tables will be set up in the dining hall tonight and tomorrow night for other in teres ted seniors. 

This particular letter will also be addressed to the Catholic Bishops; its main purpose is to ask for moral guidance from the bishops; guidance needed, the letter argues, in light of the fact that neither unjust killing nor imprisonment nor emigration Steve Preston speaks at Jackson State nUy, seems a desirable alternative.

Williams then talked about some of the reasons in history that might be responsible for the present racial imbalance in America. He said that the basic problem and the fundamental constitutional crisis is not the war but race. 
"The Constitution was never intended to be equal to all races" when it was conceived, he said. In the Reconstruction after the· Civil War, racism in the political and economic institu­
tions was not ended. Restric­
tions could no longer be made 
bacause ·of race, but this just 
opened up restrictions on other 
grounds, which nullified any at­
tempt to end racism, he said. 
"Thus far in America our pol­itical and economic situation is hardly compatible to equality," Williams said. The killings around the nation demonstrate this fact, he thought. 
Williams felt that the people in America feel like our society is unique and that all problems will just solve themselves. Racism ~xists because we feel "the United States i~ the world's Great White Hope," he added. 
Steve Preston, a national strike coordinator, explained how the Black Panthers were the leaders of a recent strike confer­ence at Yale. Because they had already made the comrnittment and whites were still unsure, Preston felt the Blacks were more able to take over the lead: ership. 
Preston emphasized that this unity could break down if white students do not start empath­izing with Blacks. 
"I would guess that most white students could not name one of those students killed in the South," he said. 
"This is where the movement will break down. Perhaps we had better think about what has gone on in our heads in the past few weeks." 
Preston said that the dwindl­ing crowds and pepole taking off for home and going to the beach might kill the movement.

An Independent Student Newspaper 
DAVID C'. BACH, .Editor 
FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3, 1966 NOTRE DAME, INDIANA 
Letters to the Editor 
Editor: 
As Chairman of the Student Life Council, I have received some inquiries. regarding a state­ment made by Student Body President David M. Krashna at the May 4 SLC meeting and how it should be judged in the light of subsequent events. I would like to take this opportunity to set matters straight as I see them. 
The situation was this. As the SLC moved toward a vote on whether to call for setting aside, May 6 and 7 for "speeches, teach-ins, and liturgical ceremon­ies," Dean Hogan inquired whether-if this motion passed­Student Government would seek to prolong the suspension of normal activities beyond Thurs­day, May 7. After a long pause to consider his answer, Mr. Krashna answered "No." This answer clearly influenced several SLC members and led to unani­mous faculty and administrative support of the motion. 
The next relevant fact is that at the mass meeting in Stepa~ Center on May 7, Mr. Krashna called for an extension of the "strike" until Friday, May IS. 
There are some further as­pects which should be consider­ed before one pronounces judg­ment on the SBP's actions as described above. In the first place, the temper on campus was altered dramatically between Monday afternoon and Thursday evening. Already by Wednesday, 
"strike" activities had achieved a momentum which, in my opin­ion, could not have been revers­ed. I was present at a hastily­arranged meeting on Wednesday night in ,LaFortune Center in­volving the hall presidents, several student government officials. and the most active (to that point) leaders of the "strike." In the ensuing discus­sion, no one in that group even considered not continuing the "strike" for another week. In fact, l received a considerable verbal lashing for interjecting my opinion that it should be called off. At this meeting, a bad split developed between the former strike leaders and the others which led to a flaring of tempers and a "walk out" by these lead­ers. At this point, Mr. Krashna intervened to call these early strike leaders back to the meet­ing and to form a coalition group to plan the Thursday mass meeting. At this point, he in effect committed himself to a more prolonged suspension than he had formerly promised. In my opinion, had he not done so, the rejected leaders would have gone off on their own and likely have been led to desparate tac­tics that would have had serious adverse effect on the University. 
In short, l believe Mr. Krash­
na's pledge was made in good 
faith, but subsequent events 
created a situation where honor­
ing it would have been futile at 
best, and at worst would have 
deprived the student body of 
effective and responsible leader­

ship at a most crucial time. Sincerely yours, James L. Massey 
No Classified Research 
Editor: 
It has been falsely reported 
several times in the recent past 
that there are secret research 
projects on the Notre Dame 
campus. To make the Univer­
sity's position on classified res­
earch (i.e., research restricted to 
persons with government secur­
ity clearances) unambiguously 
clear, the University Committee 
on Research and Sponsored 
Programs makes the following 
statements: 
I. There are presently no classified research projects at the University of Notre Dame. 
2. It is University policy that, except in times of national emer­gency classified research projects will not be accepted. 
There are no restrictions of 

any kind on discussion of or dissemination of results of any research conducted on the cam­
pus. We believe that it would be 
out of character for a University 
to engage in work which has to 
be restricted in any fashion.

the record straight. 
The McKenna-Dedrick state­

C.O. status, but it might be helpful for those who see a difference between institutional and personal violence, to note that total pacifism is not re­quired. 

You can, when the draft board asks you, readily say that. yes, I would defend my ninety year old grandmother if a gang of thugs were about to rape her. However, you can also point out that in that particular situa­tion, you have a real choice as to 
your methods of defending r 
(you can physically disable an 
attacker without killing him or 
without even coming close) and 
for that matter, you have a real 
choice as to being physically 
violent yourself. If you have the 
guts, you can put your body 
between her and them and give 
her a chance to run. 
However, in a war, when you are a soldier, these options are not open to you. In combat, when they say shoot, you have to shoot. And when you shoot, you shoot to kill. And inciden­tally, disobeying such an order in a combat situation is an offense hat can, legally, result in the death penalty executed on the spot. 

In my C.O. claim, I argued that a man who leaves himself no option but to kill is just as morally responsible as a man who kills on purpose. 
And incidentally, they gave 

me my C.O.

Academic Council Statement 

Editor: 
Those of us who in some way shared the spirit of the strike responded to the approval of the academic amnesty with deep gratitude and with re-dedication to the task of seeing that U.S. forces are immediately with­drawn from Southeast Asia. Thankfully, the faculty and 
administration saw ht not to penalize those of us who could not carry on with business as usual in good conscience. Thank­fully, they also saw fit to provide us with an opportunity to continue work which should have been initiated here much earlier in the history of our nation's involvement in South­east Asia. 
Yet while giving concerned students a chance to march forward in the cause of peace the faculty and administratio~ have also given some of us a chance to simply pack up and leave. In effect, each of us has been placed in a decision-making position in which he is about to reveal himself as either a partici­pant or an escapist. Either he will reveal himself as an indi­vidual who is genuinely inter­ested in education in the broad­est sense or as an individual whose presence at Notre Dame is solely the result of outside compulsion. 
No doubt the approval of academic amnesty will make copping out an increasingly real alternative. Thus academic amnesty alone will not reverse the estension and expansion of our nation's involvement in Southeast Asia. Only our read­iness to capitalize upon the opportunities provided by aca­demic amnesty will bring about a reversal of our nation's policies and an alteration of her prior­ities. 
Perhaps the faculty and ad­ministration have never before placed such faith in our since ,ty and conscientiousness. Should we cop out and escape we might as well forget about ever again asking the faculty and admin­istration to believe in our capa­bility to assume any sort of responsibility. 
Sincerely, 
John Marquardt

The Good Father 
========The Soft Parade 
The rather remarkable utterances or an intelligent rna: appeared in an article in the Observer last Friday. Father Jol.n J\. cKenzie expounded his thoughts on the war in Vietna·n conscience American philosophy and the just war theory. ' ' 
Several of Father McKenzie's comments are rather smprising to say the least. For example when Father McKenzie described the American war ethic as "when your enemy is down you kick him." One might raise several questions. 
If the Reverend Father means that the United States, once having 
defeaterl an enemy, proceeds to ravage the population, extract huge 
reparations, and makes no efforts to help the country, then it 
becomes obvious that history belies such an accusation. Perhaps 
thouoh the good Father didn't mean to imply this. It is possib_le 
that he meant that the United States presses ahead with ~gorous 
offensive actions when it senses the enemy is tiring. If so then the 
U.S. must stand condemned. Yet one wonders whether Father McKenzie applied the same standard when the U.S. army was thrusting into Germany in 1945. 
However an even more amazing statement of the good Father's 
was when he said the Vietnam war was "a totally immoral operation. 
For anyone with a conscience, the only thing to do is to stop it." 
Hopefully Father McKenzie was misquoted. Probably not though. 
For such an attitude to be held by a supposedly educated man is 
inconceivable. It is Fr. McKenzie's prerogative to condemn the 
Vietnam war as immoral. Yet in doing so he is making a subjective 
evaluation, binding on no one, save himself. By following it by a 
statement directly implying that anyone who supports the war is 
wtth~ut ~ conscience is ludicrous. In fact it is a clear example of the 
g:owm? mt~lemnce on the part of the academic community towards 
d1ssentmg vtews. One need only look around to see other instances 
of the same attitude: Professor McCarthy implying that the only 
way that you can be a true Christian is to oppose the war in Vietnam 
and be a conscientious objector; Presidential aide Henry Kissinger, 
mVJted to Johns Hopkins University for an "academic exercise" is 
e~1b~rras~ed ans asked s~ch asinine questions such as 'are you a war 
cnmmal? ; student orgamzers at one of the rallies on the main quad 
r~fuse to let a Vietnam veteran speak until several people shout for 
h1m to be heard; or all that rational dialogue about the Cambodian 
affair that was generated by the strike, which were really seminars 
on how far to go with the strike. 
. Fath~r McKenzie's explanation of the just war theory was 
mterestmg. The primary reason for it being so was because Father 
said that there were four qualifications used in determining a just 
war. !'et one week before that Professor Charles McCarthy 
proclaimed before the Alumni Senate that there were THREE 
principles of Orthodox Catholic Morality that were used in 
determining the justness of a war. Ah well one principle more or less 
doesn't really make that much difference does it? 
Almost as interesting, but not qmte, was Fr. McKenzie's rationale 
for denying that the United States' action in South Vietnam fulfilled 
the first two qualifications he claimed were necessary for a just war. 
Fr. McKenzie claimed that the "national welfare of the United 
Stat~s is in no way threatened by anyone in Vietnam, except 
possibly some of our own citizens." Of course "national welfare" is 
a very nebulous term: If the so called "national welfare" is only 
threatened as the result o.f an actual invasion or imminent attack by 
other ~;~n~ on the Contmental US then it is true that the "national 
welfare. Js m no ~ay threatened. Yet for those of us who define it 
otherw~se there JUSt might be some justification, Christian or 
otherw1se. 
T~~ li~e of reas.oning manifested in the denial of the second 
q ualJftcatJon for a JUSt war was fascinating. Father McKenzie said 
that ~~.we were to use means proportional to our reason for being 
~here we sho~ld arm ourselves with slingshots." This was a rather 
astu~e observatiOn. Father McKenzie's point is valid though if y 
consider the freedom of a people that unimportant. It see~s th~~ 
many do.

ACT II 

(The camera pans over a lands<.:ape of snowcapped mountains and pines. It centers on one particularly large mountain, which looks to be the Matterhorn. As we are zoomed into a close up, we begin to see a small log <.:abin about five hundred yards from the summit. Smoke is pouring from the <.:himney. We arc by now looking through the window, where a <.:heery fire is burning in the firepla<.:c, and being reflected off the pine paneling of the walls. The cabin appears to be empty, but as we look in front of the hearth, we sec a couple sitting naked on a bearskin rug gazing into the tlames and passing a joint. They are not touching, nor do they look at each other. A small gray and white catc passes before them and pauses for 
a se<.:ond in front of the fire. Then it leaps into the tire, where it turns into a pantlter, and then bursts into a blue fl<mte and is sucked up the chimney into the air above the cabin. The boy turns to the girl and speaks.)

Movement for a New Congress outlines plans 
This is the first in a series of articles written by the organizers/or the Notre Dame Movement for a New Congress. 
On May 4, 1970, Princeton University announced the forma­tion of a National Committee for a New Congress, designed to engage nationwide student sup­port for peace candidates in the primary elections, over the sum­mer and in the fall in key con­gressional campaigns. The move­ment is designed to organize local chapters which will provide information to the national of­fice in Princeton, and dissem­inate information to local stu­dents who wish to help change the direction of U.S. foreign policy through active support of peace candidates in the Congres-

sional elections. 
The movement has already begun to perform three main tasks in making students an effective force in Congressional elections. 
1. 
To involve students throughout the country in a nation-wide effort; 

2. 
to collect and maintain a flle of names and addresses of students who want to work for elections of peace candidates so they can continue to be involved in their home states during the summer and at school this fall; 

3. 
to identify peace candi­dates and amass information on congressional voting records, voting patterns in various dis­tricts and feasibility of electing 


peace candidates, 
The Princeton chapter where the movement originated serves as the national coordinating cen­
ter with a computerized data file constantly updated and available 
to all chapters. 
Last Sunday, May 17, John Roos of the Government depart­ment announced the formation of a local chapter of the Move­ment for a New Congress. The Notre Dame chapter will serve as the area headquarters for North-em Indiana schools, and channel Notre Dame students into im­portant campaigns over the sum­mer and especially next fall. The local chapter is also doing re­search into election statistics and voter turnout in the Indiana elections over the last lO years and forwarding this information into the central data bank at Princeton. Roos expressed the need for many volunteers who are willing to work either part time or full time over the sum­mer and next fall in Congres­sional campaigning and canvas­sing, if the present Administra­tion's policy is going to be reversed by the election of peace candidates. 
Each hall has a representative that students may contact. Vol­unteers are needt>d now for re­search and for working in the office. Headquarters is the Aca­demic Commission Office on the 4th floor of LaFortune. Hall representatives will also be seek­ing volunteers this week. On Thursday night there will be a meeting in 104 O'Shaughnessy at 7:00 at which the group will be broken up into smaller sem­inar groups in which experienced campaigners will orient volun­teers on the dynamics of canvas­
sing and campaigning. 
The Movement for a New Congress is a chance for students to channel their dissent into constructive political actiOn in Congressional campaigns, 

and three others are probably controlled by the Russians. 
Ranking Communist sources here left little doubt that Moscow was poised to intervene in the Middle East because the 
Kremlin  is  committed  to  the  
hilt.  
It does  not  want  to  risk, its  

SAM3 sites for reasons of prestige and for fear some of these secret weapons may fall into Israeli hands and eventually the hands of Americans, the sources said. 
The Russians will retain total control over the missiles and actually fire them, the sources said. They also said Russian technicians will "direct" from radar s'tations the advanced MIG21 jets flown by Egyptians. 
The United Nations Security Council condemned Israel last night for last week's sweep against Arab commando bases in southern Lebanon and warned that its repetition could lead to sanctions against Tel Aviv.

them to "those bums" burning books and tearing down cam­

"If Jackson was an integrated school," Young said, "it might cause some pause" on the part
of police. But he said segregation 

still implies discrimination and police feel at least unconsciously that "as long as we can segregate them we can shoot them." 
The statement was an unus­ually harsh one for Young, who is generally considered a mod-crate. Sen. Jennings Randolph, D-W. Va., praised the Urban League head, but Young said the Nixon administration was "undercutting and undermining" the efforts of moderate Negro

Young accused the adminis­tration of "hocus pocus . . , white magic" in its racial state­ments and policies. "It has a rhetoric of compliance but pol­icies of non-compliance," he said of the administration's stance on school desegregation. 
Young and Sen. Walter F. Mondale, D-Minn., committee chairman, criticized the Justice Department's support of grant­ing tax exempt status to white private schools in the South. Mondale said the administration ­was "endorsing a strategy for indirect, wholesale establishment of segregated schools."

James W. Frick, vice president for public relations and develop­ment, said the departments of publiL: information and publica­tions will he combined into a department of information ser­vices under Richard W.

Conklin, who received his M.A. in American Studies from Notre Dame in 1959, came to the Univen;ity in 1967 from the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minn., whcre he was director of the news bureau and an instructor in 
journalism. He is a former re­porter for the St. Louis Post­Dispatch and the Minneapolis Star. 
Frick explained that the reor­ganization "is designed to serve more effectively the University community and the communica­tions media."

Mitchell: needlaw and order 
CLEVELAND, Miss. (UPI) ­Attorney General John N. Mitchell deplored the student shooting deaths at Kent State ·and Jackson State yesterday and said: ''This is a nation deter­
mined to live within the law." 
"Neither violent demon­
strations nor unrestrainerl reac­
tions are part of the law," 
Mitchell said in a prepared 
speech drafted by the White 
House. 
In his appearance before the 
Delta Council at Cleveland, the 
attorney general said the deaths 
of four white students at Kent, 
Ohio, and two black students at Jackson State symbolized "the saddest semester in the history of American education." 
He then spoke out on the need for law and order, declar­ing: "There are 200 million in­nocent bystanders in America who must be protected, and the first duty of peace keeping for­ces is to protect the innocent." 
Mitchell addressed the Delta Council after making a personaJ visit to Jackson State, where campus disorder resulted in the fatal shooting of two students by Jackson Police.

Mitchell spoke of Nixon's "cool judgment" in meeting the campus crisis brought on by his Cambodia venture and the stu­dent slayings. 
"This administration will do everything that responsive lead­ership and cool judgment can do to hasten the return to the tra­dition of peaceful change," Mit­chell declared. 
A major portion of his speech dealt wjth the economy and the President's efforts to cool off inflation without bringing on a recession. 
Mitchell asserted flatly that wage and price controls "are not now and never have been" part of Nixon's strategy. He said they would bring on rationing, black

N D athletics-are they a paradox? 
by Frank Vatterott 

Editor's Note: This article was submitted to The Observer sports department by Frank Vatterott, a senior Communi­cation Arts major. He did an in depth study ofathletics at Notre Dame as a field assignment for one of his courses and these are his findings. 
An apparant paradox exists at Notre Dame. Required courses have been reviewed, ROTC has been challenged, hall rules and the historic neutral position of the University toward political controversy' are toppling. Almost every conceivable facet of Notre Dame's tradition and methods of education has been reviewed and placed in the framework of the "new university"--with one large exception. The exception is the a thle.tic department. 
The most famous college athletic department in the coun­try, symbolized by the Stadium, the Athletic and Convocation Center, and Director Edward (Moose) Krause, has been 
curiously ignored. Notre Dame students, whether they are label­ed leftists, priority pushers, pur­suers of relevance, anarchists, or self-styled muckrakers, have all stayed away from a confronta­tion. The athletic department has remained in its respected place despite the fact that many activists despise its glorious posi­tion, which, they say, contri­butes heavily to the unsatisfac­tory conditions at Notre Dame. The Students feel that the de­partment has been complacent too long and no longer is in tune with the progress of the universi­ty. No one, however, has done anything about it. 
"I think definite inadequacies exist in the athletic depart­ment," says Phil McKenna, the ex-Student Body President. "But there are two hangups to this. One, it's a very big area to get into. Two, it's very controver­sial, and during our administra­tion we touched on other con­troversial issues. We didn't want to alienate ourselves from a lot of people by taking off on the

athletic department." 
McKenna said he chose not to comment on the decision to go to the Cotton Bowl, although 
personally opposed to it. 
"It bothered me that we de­cided to extend the season that much longer," he said. "But when the administration announced the proceeds would go to scholarships for minority students, I was in a bind." McKenna, one may remember, advocated higher minority en­rollment throughout his tenure. 
Rick Libowitz, long interested in university relevance, noted that there are other, more press­ing issues for the relatively small activist group here. He admitted that he does not view the athle­tic situation as "atrocious, as, for example, Alabama's." He also took the issue of the ath­letes, not the athletic structure. 
"The great majority of ath­letes here are intelligent people," Lib owitz says, "And great guys." Let Moose Krause sit in his twin-domed pleasure palace. It's the athletes who are impor­tant, and they for the most part are responsible people." 
While many of the students interviewed agree with Libowitz, some see the "football syn­drome" as the elusive enemy. "Football is a symbol of what's wrong with this place," says NSA coordinator Steve Novak. ·"But the answer is not to get rid of the sport but to change the symbol. Trouble is, if you attack the symbol, you attack the sport, which of course isn't evil." 
"As far as student mentality goes, the worst problem around here is that damn stadium," says Ed Roickle, SLC member and old-time radical. "The activists I know and myself came here as fans and gradually lost interest. Football became trivial. The war, the grape boycott seemed more important. It was a judgment thing."

course, is a moneymaker for the university. Rich Moran, former editor of the Scholastic, feels this is the reason there has been almost a total lack of protest. "Notre Dame was one of only three universities pusuing big­time athletics that showed a profit last year," notes ex­Observer and Scholastic sports editor Terry O'Neill. "If the department ever stopped making money, then things might start happening." 
But perhaps the main reason there is not protest is the diffi­culty of documentation. "Some­body inside, a player or an offi­cial, would have to challenge the structure," Ray Serafin, a form­er associate editor of the Scho­lastic said. "Rumors are always around, but no one ever has proof of what he hears." 

Four years ago, an attempt by two Voice (predecessor to the Observer) editors to challenge the alleged "double standard of grading. for athletes and non­athletes was swiftly cut down. Robert Anson, (now a Time correspondent), and Steve Feld­haus, the editors, were taken into Michael DeCicco's office and shown the statistics. Then DeCicco told the two to go out and find five teachers who would admit to giving athletes higher grades than they de­served. The two couldn't find them. 
Whether the teachers were truthful or reluctant to condemn themselves will never be certain. But documentation will remain difficult. O'Neil admits he "con­sidered" writing a few muck­raking articles early in his career, but never did. "The closer I go to the department, the more I realized what a classy operation it is. Without being an organiza­tion man, I can truthfully say that a high sense of values per­vade the department." 

While some activists and writers concede the honesty of the department, many question the conservative nature of the director, Moose Krause. "Not

many people like the statement he made at halftime of the Ken­tucky basketball game," says Keven Rooney. (Krause had told the television audience that the ACC was a factor in keeping down student demonstrators by letting them work out their frus­trations in an athletic manner.) Krause once told this reporter that he feared "the Commies" were getting into the nation's sports departments, "just as they've gotten into education and religion." Yet the great ma­jority of radicals, as well as 1 moderates agree that Krause is a good athletic director. He is regarded, thougl1, as relating sports to anti-activist feelings, which, according to many radi­cals, isn't the case. "Hell, I play basketball at the Convo all the time," says a long-haired junior. "But that doesn't mean I believe 
in Cambodia." 
Activists, in sum, have been 

satisfied to leave the athletic 
department alone. But there is 
one person who is not satisfied­
Dave Krashna. 
The Student Body President 

notes he is making plans to 
"study the many questions I 
have been asking myself for the 
past three years." Krashna em­
phasizes he is "not accusing any­
one yet," but is going to review 
a few things. Those "things" 
inxlude the distribution of Cot­
ton Bowl funds and the con­
tinued shifting of black high 
school stars from offense to de­
fense. Krashna says the' black 
students are currently studying 
the situation. 
The highly idealistic "Nutting 
For President" committee also 

questions the relevance of athle­
tics. But the anti-athletic cam­
paign "is only part of a much 
larger philosophy on the part of Dr. Nutting," reports STeve Raymond, the chairman. Dr. Nutting is the only faculty mem­ber to publicly blast the institu­tion of football in his essay
" h ,
T e l-Ioly War." Nutting's stand, however, is still academic.
