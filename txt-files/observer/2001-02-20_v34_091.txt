CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 
Members discuss cju Lac policies 
By JASON McFARLEY 
Assistant News Editor 
With major revision work to du Lac slated for this summer, Campus Life Council (CLC) members on Monday heard w h i C h 
areas of the University student handbook will likely undergo change­and made clear which 


issues they Kirk plan to keep off the agenda. 
Discussion at the 70-minute meeting centered on the du Lac introduction, which details the University's unofficial poli­cy of drafting major changes to the handbook every two years. The CLC was somewhat recep­tive to proposed changes by the Office of Residence Life (ORL), but several members expressed doubt and frustra­tion toward Faculty Senate-ini­tiated recommendations. 
Bill Kirk, assistant vice presi­dent for Residence Life, told the group Monday that the ORL, based on information from residence hall staff and campus security reports, has placed four du Lac policies under consideration for revi­sion: 
. 
Expanding the definition of abusive drinking to include the misuse of prescription or non­prescription drugs in connec­tion with alcohol consumption 

. 
Formatting and presenting housing and residence hall information and regulations 

. 
Determining the impact of disciplinary sanctions on stu­dent eligibility for athletic par­ticipation and awards, campus clubs, student government positions and study abroad programs 

. 
Regulating the use of small appliances in residence hall 


rooms 
"I don't know which way 
administrators are leaning in 
any of these areas, but [the 
recommended changes] high­. light concerns," Kirk said. 
Kirk, who was rnquired to 
present to the CLC before the 
group's first March meeting 
any areas under consideration 
for revision in the next edition 
of du Lac, said silgnificant 
changes to the handbook are not likely. 
"I don't see revisions we're making being terribly dramatic this year," he said. 
Most work on changes to the 2001-02 edition of du Lac will take place in early summer, according to Kirk. He said the handbook then moves to University trustees for approval in August. 
But if the CLC's discussion Monday was an indication, some proposed changes may fall off the agenda long before summer. 
While Kirk's recommenda­tions prompted little debate Monday, three Faculty Senate resolutions presented by Ed Manier stirred some tense, frank exchanges. 
The resolutions. passed unanimously by the senate on Jan. 24, target the section of du Lac. which indicates the process by which students and clubs may propose changes to the handbook. 
Nathan Hatch, University provost, directed the recom­mendations to the CLC after the senate forwarded them to

Vagina Pride 

Last weekend I faked an orgasm in front of my mother and 20,000 perfect strangers. Sitting in Madison Square Garden, I marveled as the entire arena erupted into a jubilant, orgasmic yell. Laughing, I turned towards my mother and wasn't a bit embarrassed.

fly to New York to see "The Vagina Monologues." I was floored -my mother is about as Catholic and conservative as they come. 
So when she told me that her friends had planned an entire trip around seeing this contro­versial play, I was more than a little intrigued. I told her I was up for it. 
I'll never forget that evening. A rally organized for "V-Day" -a mov1iment fighting to end vio­lence against women, included an extended ver­sion of the "Monologues." Playwright Eve Ensler hosted the event, and even directed the audience in faking that orgasm -a unique mother-daugh­ter bonding experience, to say the least. 
That night I saw Jane Fonda enraptured by the miracle of giving birth. Oprah's haunting voice described the oppression faced by women in Afghanistan. Survivors of rape and female geni­tal mutilation wept as they told their stories. And my mother and I, her friends and their daugh­ters, shared it all. 
We roared with laughter, we sobbed, we sat stunned at the testimonies we heard. Then we stood when Ensler asked who knew a survivor of rape or assault. 
There was one face missing. one who under­stood better than any of us the reality of sexual assault. And because she couldn't be there that night, we rose and stood for her. To me, this is what the "Monologues" arc about -giving a voice to victims of sexual assault, empowering men and women to fight against violence. When I returned Monday night and announced to my roommates that I loved my vagina, they were slightly taken aback. 
But as I told them about my weekend, they became intrigued, maybe even envious. I felt proud to be a woman, I told them. rfelt comfort­able enough to talk with my mother about any­thing. And I understood that in order for things to change, maybe we had to shake things up a little and talk about our vaginas. 
My roommates didn't get to see the "Monologues" this year. Rut maybe they ·will next year, thanks to groups like C.A.R.E. and the Saint Mary's women who continue to read the play, hoping its message wiH be heard. Regardless of administrative rulings, the V-Day movement is growing. working all over the globe to stop vio­lence against women. 
If you believe that all women should be able to live in freedom and safety, then don't let the cen­sorship of a play keep you silent. Male or female, you can make a difference -in the jokes you tell, the attitudes you live by, the causes you fight for and the victims you pray for. 
That's what "The Vagina Monologues" are all about.

University of Kentucky debates visitation policy 
LEXINGTON, Ky. 
The Student Government Association (SGA) and Resident Student Council have proposed a new visitation policy for the residence halls. 
After four months of preparation, last Friday they sent a proposal to the office of Residence Life. 
Under this policy, the coeducation residence halls would have 24-hour visitation and the single-sex residence halls would be 12 p.m. to 12 a.m. dur­ing the week and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the weekends. 
Under the current visitation policy, the coeducational residence halls have visitation from 2 p.m. to 12 a.m. dur­ing the week and 12 p.m. to 2 a.m. on the weekends. The single-sex resi­dence halls have visitation from 2 p.m. 


to 12 a.m. during the week and 12 
p.m. to 2 a.m. on the weekend. 

James Monroe, a freshman senator, decided to dedicate the last four months to this issue because he thinks the current policy is inconvenient. 
"The visitation policy is so strict that it was a nuisance," he said. 
According to information that SCA has collected from UK's Office of Residence Life and nsc, the visitation policy has remained unchanged since the transition to coeducational resi­dence halls in 1960. 
"Essentially the issue is one of social standards, one of common sense. Now that we have coeducational residence halls it is difficult to enforce the policy that they have in effect because undoubtedly people go between floors in the halls," said Edwin Orange, chairperson of the student senate. 
Joe Impellizzeri, a member of the committee who has proposed the new policy agrees that prevailing social standards have changed and changes need to be made. "It's definitely time for a change." 
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 

Code redefines labor standards 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. 
University of Michigan President Lee Bollinger last week approved a new set of standards for compa­nies who manufacture university-licensed products. The code of conduct will affect more than 500 exist­ing deals the university has with apparel, souvenir and office supply companies, among others. "We have rooted this in a concept of human rights," Bollinger said at the University Board of Regents meeting Friday. "The refinements of this code are based on this general understanding." The code was drafted by the Committee of Labor Standards and Human Rights. The group took a labor code that had been drafted by a previous committee in March 1999 and tweaked it to meet the University's current stan­
dards. 'Tm pleased that the president took our rec­ommendations,"said committee chair and Social Work Prof. Lawrence Root. "I think the committee worked hard ... The code expresses the goal that the university has." 

BARNARD COLLEGE 

Daughter of Malcolm X speaks out 
NEW YORK 
In a speech delivered Sunday to a packed audience in Barnard College's LeFrak Gymnasium, Attallah Shaba;z:z demonstrated that she is more than the oldest of African-American civil rights activist Malcolm X's six daughters. Her speech commemorated Malcolm X's last public address, which also took place in the LeFrak Gymnasium, exactly 36 years ago. only three days before the civil rights leader was assassinated. Shabazz spoke confidently to the large crowd, often stopping to ask the audience if it understood her points. Shabazz stressed that her father's philosophy came not only from him, but also from those around him. Like her father, Shabazz said, she is the product of a long lineage of ancestors with distinguished histo­ries. She told the audience that her father had taught her that "we are all descendants of a continuum" and 
therefore should not judge each other based on lin­eage. "By the power invested in me, I now pronounce you all brothers and sisters," she said afterwards.

By COLLEEN McCARTHY Associate News Editor 
Upcoming elections for the classes of 2002, 2003 and 2004, Student Diversity Board and Residence Hall Association highlighted discussion at the Board of Governance meeting Monday. 
Unlike the one-ticket elec­tions for student body presi­dent and vice president, com­petition promises to be more intense for class elections. Turnout was high at informa­ticmal meetings for those inter­ested in running for class boards, said Nickey Prezioso, BOG elections commissioner. 
"We had a great turnout and at least 17 different people showed up to express inter­est," said Prezioso.

Several CLC members debat­

ed at length over the first pro­
posal. before tabling the dis­
cussion and agreeing to 
resume talks at the group's 
March 5 meeting. 
In general, members were at 

odds over the role of academic 
freedom at a Catholic universi­
ty. 
"There are no provisions for academic freedom for students anywhere in du Lac," said Manier. a philosophy profes­sor. "I personally have indulged in activity that may contravene the mission of the Catholic Church. but I don't think that l should not be free to inquire, to obtain informa­tion." 
At recent Faculty Senate and CLC meetings, members of both groups have discussed controversy surrounding the Women's Resource Center (WRC). In April 1998. the University placed the center on probation following sanc­tions for distributing informa­
ing the center as evidence 
against a free academic envi­
ronment. Sister Adrienne 
Piennette disagreed with 
Manier Monday. 
"Academic freedom in the 
classroom -that's fine. 
Outside, that's a different con­
text," the Welsh Hall rectress 
said. 
Kirk also offered a candid 
opinion. 
"I think all three resolutions 
are so fundamentally flawed 
they're beyond rep.air," he 
said. Kirk's comment followed 
thr, CLC's decision to form a 
task force to look into du Lac 
revisions. 
Brian O'Donoghue, student 
body prnsident. said the task 
force will make recommenda­
tions that must be approved by 
the CLC before moving to the 
Office of Student Affairs. He 
said in the past, the Office of 
the Student Body President 
would appoint representatives 
to make proposals to Student 
Affairs, but a task force puts 
du Lac revisions under the jurisdiction of the CLC. 
O'Donoghue said the task force's make-up would be sim­ilar to the CLC. which now includes students, faculty, rec­tors and administrators.

the government as "deficient" 
as ofAug. 31, 2000. 

That's a slight improvement from four years earlier when 31 percent of bridges were deemed deficient, defined as structures that either require repairs or are too narrow or weak to handle the traffic that must use the bridges to get from place to place. 
"There has been some 
improvement, but the numbers

In October 1999, a section of' 
pavement on Lee's Bridge 
across the Sudbury River in 
Massachusetts collapsed with­
out warning. No one was 
injured, but the bridge was 
closed for repairs. Even before 
the collapse, heavy trucks were 
banned from the well-traveltid 
structure. 

In Wisconsin, ceremonies Saturday marked the reopening of the southbound lanes of the I-loan Bridge over Milwaukee's Lake Michigan harbor. The bridge had been closed since December after cracks were found in two of the three gird­ers supporting a section of the northbound lanes. The south­bound lanes, which have been reinforced, now carry two-way traffic. 
Many bridges deemed defi­cient simply fail to meet current safety standards, such as the width of lanes. Such narrow bridges further clog already crowded roadways.

The Navy resumed inspection of a sunken Japanese ship after sidestep­ping earlier technical problems with a deep-i;ea robot. 
Crew members aboard the USS Salvor lowered a second robot into the ocean nine miles south of Diamond Head on Sunday night, after the first robot was removed for repairs.

Families of the nine men and teen­agers missing since the collision are pressing the United States to salvage the ship if that is the only way to recover bodies that may be entombed in its hull. 
"The U.S. Navy has never raised a vessel of this size from this depth, so it is an immense task if that were to be the directive," Lt. Cmdr. Jane Campbell said. 
Videotape taken by the first robot showed ilie ship in good condition. sit­ting upright on the ocean floor, but the Coast Guard said the full extent of damage had not been determined. 

The Navy said the deep-sea robots may be too big to enter the wreckage to retrieve any bodies that may be inside, especially if the vessel has not broken apart. 
The Ehime Maru, a commercial fish­ing training vessel, was headed toward fishing grounds 300 miles southeast of Oahu when the Greeneville collided vvith it during an emergency rapid-ascent drill. Twenty­six people were rescued, but there have been no signs of the nine miss­ing. 

Piolice work to quell prison protests 
Assocfated Press 
SAO PAULO 
Authorities said they were reining in prison riots that spread across Brazil after inmates at Latin America's largest jail took nearly 8,000 visitors and guards hostage. 
Aft er the riot at Carandiru prison, similar revolts spread to 22 other prisons across Sao Paulo state. Late Sunday night, the state government said 19 jails had been brought back under control and negotiations at Carandiru would resume on Monday. 
At least five inmates were killed in the unrest, which began at Carandiru as prisoners protested the transfer of 10 people believed to be members of a Rio de Janeiro-based arms and drug trafficking ring. The group is influen­tial among the prison's 10,000 inmates. 
Prisoners released about 20 hostages late Sunday night, local media report­ed, but police said they were unable to confirm the report. 
Earlier, a rebellion leader identified only as Roberto spoke to TV Bandeirantes by cellular telephone and said he expected the hostages ­who he called "visitors" ­to be released Monday. 
Marco Vinicio Petreluzzi, Sao Paulo's public security secretary, said the return of the 10 ringleaders was out of the question. 
"It was a carefully planned operation, by an organization that exerts its influence over inmates in other prisons," Petreluzzi

said. "The uprising was

way of getting back at us 
for tr..e transfor of the 10." 
The riot started during late morning visiting hours in Carandiru, where a bloody operation to quell an uprising in 1992 left at least 111 inmates dead. 
Some 72 prison guards and more than 7,900 visi­tors -including 1,700 children -were inside when the rebellion started, said police Capt. Monica Bondezan. It wasn't clear how many prisoners were rioting at the jail. 
At least three prisoners were killed and six were wounded at Carandiru, law enforcement officials said. Pctreluzzi said two prisoners had died at another jail, apparently killed by other inmates. 
The 10 prison leaders were transferred Friday after authorities at the jail raided cells and found stockpiles of ammunition, knives and cell phones. 

The 10 belong to a crimi­nal group known as First Capital Command. The group is believed to be a branch of a Rio de Janeiro organized crime group that calls itself the Crime Party. 
The rebellion was a clear slap in the face to state government, who most observers agree is losing its grip over the state's prison system. Riots and violence in the country's overcrowded jails are com­mon. 
"The government will not allow organized crime to dominate the prison sys­tem," said Geraldo Alckmin, a.cting governor of Sao Paulo State.

Hesburgh Center panelists discusses peace research 
By ERIN BRADY 
News Writer 
Peace research, once regard­ed by many as a topic of con­troversy, has now become a widely accepted ideology, gen­erating much support and dis­cussion from scholars and pro­fessors throughout the world, according to panelists at the llesburgh Center for International Studies Monday afternoon. 
Several specialists on global conflict resolution spoke on the effects of pea(:e research throughout the world and noted the differences of the topic throughout different soci­eties and generations. 
"At its foundation, 'peace' was politically incorrect ... the idea that one could do research on such a subject made others skeptical," said Nils Gleditch, research profes­sor from the International Peace Hcsearch Institute in Norway. 
llowcver, he also said that the nature of the term "politi­cally correct" has changed, especially in eastern countries. 
"War was not good for social affairs or the economy.. .in a

ity assumption about the African American culture incorrect. From Portugal's acquisition of Africa in 1493, the continent has been host to several different religions, cul­tures and languages that divide the race into different value systems. 
"Africa is not a country, it is a continent," McGriff said. "Some people will tell me that 30 miles will put you into a dif­ferent language, a different culture. You're talking major, major differences. There are rooted differences of language, religion and different cul­tures... they are about as simi­lar as a Frenchmen and a Norwegian. The share perhaps their color, but nothing else." 
Once in America by result of the slave trade, intraracial divi­sions continued over the fight for abolition. Many well-off African Americans had no rea­son to light for the end of slav­ery because their life remained relatively unaffected. But for less wealthy African Americans and women, the issue of slav­ery was a critical fight, McGriff said. 
"Women were concerned about abolishing slavery because if black folk got the vote, women would get the vote too," McGriff said. 
However, the fight for aboli­tion was self-centered for many women, who sought to stop interracial sexual relations between white slave owners and black slaves. Many women were simply tired of "hus­bands, brothers and sons hav­ing liaisons with black folk ... creating brothers, sisters and cousins of color," McGriff said. But as these relations began to produce a population of mixed heritage, intraracial divisions over the abolition movement deepened. 
McGrilT referred to the rela­sense you could say 'war is out, poaco is in,"' said Gleditch. He said that there has been an increase in acceptance of peace research in academic studies at universities through­out the world.

"Those who were like the !lemmings began to become different from those in the fields. The desire for emanci­pation was not across the board. Those who didn't want it were those who were doing well, who were living in the big houses," he said. 
lntraracial tensions have continued even after the slav­ery era, as the African American community has struggled with internal stratifi­cation due to skin tone. "Lighter" skinned African Americans with more European features have enjoyed either preferential or detrimental treatment depend­ing on the community. Showing a video clip of two boys, one light skinned and one dark skinned, dealing with the prej­udice against darker skinned African Americans, McGriff explained that some blacks will stratify members of their racial group according to appear­ance. 
"The undoing of difference of color is more of a theory than actual practice," he said. "We are wired to see people in an actual group. Blacks them­selves will begin to stratify when they look at each other [according to skin tone}." . 
McGriff was critical of Marcus Garvey's leadership in the black community, arguing that Garvey's view of racial sol­idarity to unite African, Americans was selective and did not include all members ot the race because of visual dif­ferences in skin tone. 
While the movement was; successful in deconstructing some of the socially construct­ed negative images and self-, hatred many members of the African American community experienced, it did not reach far enough. 
"He himself had a problem

claimed weren't of color enough." 
Addressing intraracial ten­sion today involves recognizing the roots of intraracial conflict and deconstructing our socially constructed view of what race is, McGriff said. The outside observer's tendency to group all members of one racial group into one category is a starting point. Discussing the problems with racial grouping on college applications and on the U.S. Census, McGriff emphasized that there are ancestral differences within the African-American community that need to be recognized. 

"People are starting to want to say, Tm tired of disappear­ing my grandparents, my rela­tives, because l have to lit into this box,"' McGriff said. 
Overall, addressing intrara­cial tension will have to come in a historical perspective, McGriff said, and progress over time. 
"I'm not so na'ive to think people won't lump people of color into groups," McGriff said. "The difference the peo­ple of color see is predicated on wedges set years and years ago. Many think people of color are all like when in reality, we've never been alike. The observer doesn't see it, but those of us who are of color do see it, and it needs to be put to rest."

TEHRAN 

With unemployment soaring high enough in Iran to keep many young people from sav­ing the money they need to the purpose~ to "encourage marriage among our young people and invite the public to hold modest celebrations in order to save money." 
Many young Iranian men do not get married before they are 30 because it is too difficult to save enough money. Many cou­ples come to Tehran from country villages for the jammed mass wed­

Zahra Nowruzi

Wedding day Monday, 
at the Interior Ministry Monday included dancing, folk music. gifts and some 700 young cou­ples exchanging vows. Another 850 pairs got hitched in the same huge hall the day before, and organizers -who are rep­resentatives of Iran's supreme leader -said 14.000 couples were expected to do the same in Tehran and other cities around the country during this week of mass weddings. 
The general director of the project. Ahmad Bahraini, says 
bride men in khaki hats a:nd baggy red trousers danced, women watched and clapped in encouragement. Rahraini, who represents supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei at a Tehran univer­sity, said he began organizing mass weddings in 1. 998 with only 150 student couples. By last year, the number of cou­ples had risen to 1,000. Each couple receive as pre­sents a gold coin, a copy of the Quran -the Muslim holy 
book. a blanket and a license for a telephone line. 
They also take part in a big party with bands from their districts playing traditional music. As Iran's strict interpre­tation prohibits men and women from dancing in public, it is the men who dance and their wives and female guests clap in encouragement. 
'Tm spending the happiest moments of my life. Today's colorful ceremony will remain a sweet memory for us," said Zahra Nowruzi, a bride in a white chador -a head-to-toe garment that covers all but the face and hands. 
Her groom, Rostam Bahadori, 27. a geography graduate who is looking for work, said that unemployment is the main reason for young people's avoiding marriage. 
"But I'm not really worried," he said. "If I can't find a job, I can work on a piece of land for my father." 
Another groom, Sadeq Mashhadi, 27, had a job and knew that life becomes more expensive after marriage. 
"Many of the new couples are jobless. They will have more and more problems after marriage," he said with a laugh. His bride, Nawab Saleh, pinched him. 

ABA votes onL 'zero tolerance' policies 
Asociated Press 

SAN DIEGO 
The leadership of the American Bar Association voted Monday to recommend ending "zero tolerance" school discipline policies and stopping the government's use of secret evidence in most immigration cases. 
The zero tolerance policies -which can mandate expul­sion or referral to juvenile or criminal court "without regard to the circumstances or nature of the offense or the student's history" -are unfair and inappropriate for many children, advocates said. 
"Zero tolerance has become a one-size-fits-all solution to all the problems that schools confront," said a report accompanying the resolution adopted by the policy-making House of Delegates of the 400,000­member lawyers' organiza­tion. "It has redefined stu­dents as criminals, with unfortunate consequences." 
The ABA resolution, approved without a roll call vote on the closing day of the group's winter meeting, has no legal effect, but advocates hope it will prompt schools to re-evaluate such policies maintained by many of the nation's approximately 14,000 school districts. The policies typically cover weapons. drugs or violence in school. 
Those who oppose zero tol­erance say tho rules have gone too far, with occasion­ally ridiculous results. 
One example in the ABA report: A 12-year-old referred to Louisiana police for tellinH classmates in the lunch line, 'Tm going to get you," if they ate all the pota­toes before it was his turn. 
Supporters of zero toler­ance rules say they help keep schools safe, and that parents and law enforce­

ment  generally  support  
them.  
The  ABA's  House  of  

Delegates also agreed to sev­eral recommendations for changing immigration law. Again, the ABA positions ­these also taken without a recorded vote -have no legal bearing, but the orga­nization likely would back them up with lobbying efforts in Congress. 

The group approved rec­ommending changes to a 1996 anti-terrorism law that has made it far easier for the Immigration and Naturalizaition Service to use secret evidence against noncitizens. The INS typical­ly has done so in cases of suspected terrorism, citing the potential damage to national security if the evi­dence became public.

Karaoke kills monotony 
I had a hard time coming up with an idea for this week's article, but I didn't want to disappoint all my fans out there (all two of you), so I searched back in my brain to the No. 1 basic rule of writing: Write about what you know. 
And this is what I know: I know that I am a smart young woman with a lot of potential to do great things, but then again. what Saint Mary's or Notre Dame woman is not? I know that I have wonderfully supportive family and friends. A lot of people do. And I know that I am destined to sing the song "You're So Vain" in karaoke and make an absolute fool of myself. 
And I am okay with that. 
What? you ask incredulously. You are going to voluntarily get up in front of your friends and strangers and sing loudly and not-so-much on key into a microphone? 
Oh yes. And I will do it sober, too. 
I'm not proclaiming myself to be some sort of karaoke diva. We have already been over that, and I am not going to go there again. But don't you ever just want to burst out of the skin you wear and jump into one that lets you do what you want, where you want, when you want and not concern yourself with what oth­ers think? 
Both the SMC and ND campuses push diversity like it is going out ofstyle. And they do a pretty good job, too. I have been to more dance shows, art exhibits and talks that have opened my eyes and sparked my interests to the worlds of

culture and whatnot beyond the LeMans tower and to what awaits me north, south, east and wesi of U.S. 31 come this May. Yet still one thing remains the same, which really bothers me and which boils down to one thing: same thing, different year. 
This message is essentially a real downer, if you think about what it means. With the exception of my sopho­more year spent in Rome, the other three years of college have run a pretty regular course. I look around me and see this year's freshmen and think. wow, was I really that annoying once? Most definitely. 
And that's not a bad thing, either, because we were all there at one point. We all went to the dorm parties and we all tailgated (a lot) and we all go to Corby's on Tuesdays and Heartland on Thursdays and dance our pants off at the 'Backer on the weekends (if you are "of age," that is). I see the same people out and about all the time. to the point where I think I know that kid, but really, no. I just see him or her at the 'Backer. or I sat by them at a football game. 
All of these pseudo-bonding adven­tures eventually become another sort of unwritten tradition and a big part of what social life in the Bend means. But you know, doesn't that get a little tire­some sometimes? 
I don't mean to try and make the SMC and ND social life sound like it is the absolute worst thing on earth. or that it is one big drinking and bar fest, because really the social aspect of college is what you make of it. For some, it is bars and clubs. For others, it is movies and exhibits. And for still others, it is video games and Papa John on speed dial. 
But whatever you decide, remember ... it is your choice. 
Think about that the next time you have absolutely no desire to do thi.5 

Saturday what you have done for the past sixteen Saturdays in a row. even if it means going against everything that all your friends want to do and what they want and think you should do, too. That's kind ofhow I feel about karaoke. I have actually done it a couple of times, but never seriously (wait ... karaoke can be serious?!) and never solo. 
But every now and then I think about and feel the need to bust out a little Carly Simon in front of an audience just for the sake of doing it because I want to. I think it would be fun and I've never done it before. I'm sure a lot of other people have, and it would be no big deal to them. My sister, for one. She goes to karaoke bars every other weekend, and that nervous high that you get when you maybe are about to do something totally out of character does not phase her. 
I am not saying that karaoke is the cure to unleash all that is hidden within you. Not by a long shot, people. But think about that thing. that plan. that adventure that you would love to have. that would make people step back and say, "Wow, there are sides to you that I never knew existed." Or even make them step back and simply say, "Hoo­Wah" while they look at you with new eyes. 
It is the breaking out of that shell that makes me realize that I was wrong in what I said earlier. College does not run a regular path. In fact, I like to say that I have taken many a side road, a scenic route and made a few pit stops along the way.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Saying goodbye to a legend 
The e-mail from my cousin read, "Dale Earnhardt dies today as a result of injuries sustained in a crash head on into a wall at Daytona. Oh my God!" I read the words 
on the screen and my head began to sp;n. I thought ~~ 
to myself, Dale Earnhardt dead? I couldn't believe ~ it. It just didn't seem possible. I immediately looked up the ESPN Web site and the main head­line glared out at me, "Earnhardt killed at Daytona," and a wave of grief hit me. This man. MThe Man in Black" and "The Intimidator" as fans knew him, was a childhood hero of mine. I can remember several Sundays, sitting around with my father watching Earnhardt's black No. 3 Goodwrench Chevy on television. 
I can remember watching the Daytona 500 in 1998 as he won for the first time. After 19 years of disap­pointment after disappointment the Man in Black had finally won NASCAR's greatest race. On that day, Earnhardt's drive toward Victory Lane was slowed considerably when crew­men from virtually every team poured out onto the pit road to congratulate him with high fives and cheers. Everyone knew he deserved it, everyone knew that the day was some­

thing special. Dale Earnhardt was the active wins leader in the circuit and at Daytona. The Intimidator's seven NASCAH Winston Cup Championship crowns offer all the proof needed to those who question his place in history. Earnhardt was the first driver in the history of the sport to win the rookie of the year award and the series title in back-to-back years. He was the first three-time winner of the Winston Select, and he won three !HOC championships. His racing style helped define a generation of drivers -those who run hard Sunday, then shake hands and exchange congratulations when all is said and done. Dale Earnhardt is truly a legend in the sport of racing, and Sunday at Daytona NASCAR and its fans lost one of our greatest friends and sportsmen. Goodbye, Earnhardt-you will be missed.

The jokes are often pointed and witty -Humor -even sharp satire -is one thing, but in the name of common courtesy and ordinary decency, there is a line to be drawn. It's difficult to understand why the administration of a Catholic law school, which claims to educate "a different kind of lawyer," would have trouble finding the moral courage and clear­headedness to draw that line. Father Mike's memory deserves a little bit more respect, and a little bit less lip service. 
To educate a different kind of lawyer means to edu­cate young lawyers in virtue, to show them the path to holiness and sainthood through the daily sanctification of their legal work by teaching then how o draw closer to Christ. The Father Mike Show in its current incarna­tion fails this mission. If anything, it educates in the path of selfishness over self-giving. 
Words have consequences. Langua:ge is a lawyer's stock and trade and in a sense, it is the tool with which members of the legal profession preside over the orderly and humane administration of society. Saint Thomas More, the patron saint of lawyers, was execut­ed precisely because he refused to act as if words didn't matter. Would it be too much for the SBA and the Law School administration to require participants in the Father Mike Show to think before they speak? Otherwise one wonders if Notre Dame Law School's mission to educate a "different kind oflawyer" is noth­ing more than a hollow phrase.

the gaps between

have been increas­ing since the World Bank started tinker­ing with foreign economies. 
That's probably why the last two U.S. conventions of global development orga­nizations have been met with violence. 
Although I wasn't there, I'm told the World Trade Organization's meeting in Seattle was a chaotic mess. 
The World Bank meeting in Washington, D.C., was much less volatile. I remember seeing more aggression from the D.C. cops than the protesters, but some of the more confrontational activists definitely tried to take matters into their own hands. And it was a little intimidating when they rolled out the miniature tank at the demonstration in front of the Department ofJustice. 
It felt exhilarating to be there. I felt as though I was helping to make a positive difference. That's because at the time, I lacked an understanding of the source of the problem. 
I am the problem. 
In this particular case, I thought the World Bank was responsible for the con­ditions of extreme poverty and hardship in developing nations. I made this connec­tion, I think. because it is the agency responsible for enacting programs to eliminate world poverty. It cleans up our mess, and, in many cases, what it does doesn't work very well. 
But without delving too deeply into eco­nomics, the reason the way people in 
Africa live the way they do is because I 
live the way I do. The notion of raising 
them to our level is an elaborately 
financed joke. My lifestyle, as an 
American, is so exorbitant in the 
resources I consume and the system I 
contribute to that equality on my level is 
structurally impossible. 
It would take five planets' worth of resources to fuel the capitalist machine and balance my overconsumption, and then we might be able to bring them to our industrial level. But until I change what I do, others will continue to suffer. 
And this is just the beginning. 
The biggest hypocrite of all is the American college student environmental­ist. We actually entertain the fantasy that we are having a significant environmental impact by recycling everything in sight, avoiding the use ofplastic, cutting down on frivolous car trips and so on. It dis­tracts us from the tremendous volume of waste and resources the systems we con­tribute to secrete. 
Michigan State, for instance, dispensed 125,884 cubic yards of what's called uncompressed municipal solid waste (an Environmental Protection Agency catego­ry for the stuITyou throw out) during the last fiscal year. And while we have room for improvement, we set a fairly good example as an institution, recycling close to 19 percent of all our municipal solid waste. And there are initiatives on cam­pus to substantially increase this number. 
That's nice. But municipal solid waste only accounts for 2.2 percent of the total 165 pounds of waste you, the average American, will create-today. 
Don't shake your head in disbelief. The MSU power pl~mt, for instance, actually throws out more used coal than we throw out trash. Getting the idea? Have you used the bathroom or taken a shower today? Eaten industrially processed food? Purchased an industrially manufactured shirt? Driven a car? These conveniences add up. 
I do have a point. Social activism strokes the ego. There are seemingly invisible malevolent forces at work all around us, and of course we'd rather be good (than bad}. But the reason you so rarely see Haitian tree­huggers and Zimbabwean ~ environmentalists is not just that they're too busy being hungry. It's also that they're not con tributing to these problems in nearly the same capacity as we are. 
To put it another way, we have the energy and resources to care about these prob­lems because we consume so much energy and resources. 
Please do not mis­understand me. l would never say recycling and screaming at D.C. cops have no place. They should be very effective in temporarily prolonging our self­destruction. I have always recycled and I will continue to do it. But we should do these things out of guilt, in spite of ourselves. If you believe your lifestyle is positively affecting humanity and your planet, I would disagree. lfyou continue to con­tribute to this society, especially this American society, it is your job to try and minimize your damage as much as possi­ble. 
I've thrown up my hands. convinced fighting the destructive system itself has long been futile. I see two options. 
I can drop out and go learn how to live in the woods. Or, rather than fighting with the system, I can fight within the system to enact social change. 

In this country, there are plenty of opportunities for social change avail­able. Women, when you get your degree, you can expect to make 76 percent as much money as me for performing the same job. Does that anger you? It should. Last week, our president was talking about 
reducing our foreign military commit­ments. This week, 
bombing Iraq is part of his "strate­gy." 
There's madness in every direction. Why aren't we flooding the streets in droves exercising 
our right to peace­fully assemble? Has the sitcom age of 30­
minute comedic problem-solving real­ly reduced my genera­tion to such a pitiful state of apathy? These 
gigantic problems can seem so overwhelming at times, and yet, simultaneous­

CONCERT REVIEW 
Gatecrasher sho~wcases best DJs, effects in trance 
By DAVID FULTON Scene Music Cricic 
"Welcome to the Future," the screen ilashes in unison with the thunderous beats that shakes one to the deepest depths of his or her soul. The screen could not have been more accurate in its message, as Gatecrasher stormed the Point Depot Theater in Dublin with more intensity than a glare from Hannibal Lecter. 
With the current status of the music industry trapped in a monotonous doldrum of pre-packaged pretty boys and repetitious rebels, Gatecrasher provided a glimpse of hope for the future. With six of the biggest names in trance music on the bill, including Judge Jules, Timo Maas, Sander Kleinenberg, DJ Tiesto (who just started his residency at Republic, an English club), Scott Bond and Robbie Butler, the show raised music from one-dimen­sional ear candy to a six hour, mind-blowing, three­dimensional spectacle. 
Based out of Republic, Gatecrasher is quickly becoming a worldwide phenomenon. New Year's Eve brought simultaneous shows in London and Belfast with DJs flown back and forth after sets. The travelling dance club has already done several shows in South Africa, New York and parts of Asia with a load of shows scheduled all over the world, including the United States in the Summer of 2001. appropriate trance flavored intro of U2's "Where the

and far between. There is much credit to be given to 
DJs. Many refuse to dignify them with the title of musi­
cians, claiming they do not sing, play instruments or even 
write their own songs. Some even go so far as to group them with the highly unoriginal Puff Daddy as rip-off artists. But lumping a trance DJ and Puff Daddy together is giving Mr. Daddy too much credit. It is true -they do not sing. and most do not write their own songs, but they do play instruments, as unconventional as it may be. The mammoth rig of turntables and records is as much their instrument as a Fender Stratocaster was for Jimi Hendrix. Where as Hendrix played his instrument, DJs knit theirs into a brilliant web of color­ful tones and beats that entangle the listener in its maze of sound. Each DJ provided his own blend of style, record selection and beats, which meshed together during transitions. While sets by all of the DJs were carried out with brilliant style and flawless performance, the

The Holland native has quickly become one of the most successful producers in trance music and helped form Black Hole Recordings. With numerous albums under his belt, including the highly rated Magik series, he continues to impress critics and is currently working on an album of original compositions. He has his own dis­tinct style that not only compliments the songs on his decks, but also transforms them into vivid musical works of art. 
Tiesto's performance offers a bit more flash than that of the others. At one point he threw his arms into the air and stood tall gazing into the audience, like an ancient pagan priest holding court to thousands of followers during a rit­ual sacrifice. His music is almost sexual in nature as it slowly builds until peaking in an orgasm of sound that washes over everyone in earshot. 
While some trance DJs attempt to beat the listener to death with thunderous blasts of' bass, Tiesto chooses a more melodic and smoother approach, as evident in his performance. He takes a melody line and repeats it while dropping the bass completely out of the mix, thus giving the listener almost a sense that they are floating in the surrounding sound waves. 
Slowly, cymbals re-enter followed by beats that increase in speed and audibility. With lights strobing and images flashing in time with the music, everything reaches a crest just before a sensory overload and the viewer/listener rides out the sonic wave in a rush of audio-visual ecstasy

ALBUM REVIEW 
Mindless of populctr trends, Jeff Beck finds succes~; again 
By GREG RUEHLMANN Scene Music Cricic 
When guitar legend Jeff Beck released Who Else! in 1999, fans and critics alike rejoiced. Who Else! was the first new studio album from the former Yardbird in 10 years, and showcased his surprisingly diverse musical tastes and talents. Most surpris­ing perhaps was the grizzled vet­eran's use of newer electronic beats to support his Stratocaster. 
Who Else! was a success, both commercially and critically. Yet it was Carlos Santana, another famous guitarist from days past, who took the spotlight that year by adapting his sound for today's audience -through his memo­rable Supernatural. However, unlike Santana, Beck didn't need a U-Haul to take all his Grammys home in 1999. Who Else! did earn him a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. 
Most fans were certain that scv­eral years would pa.ss before Beck again emerged with a studio album. But, as was shown on Who Else!, Beck is a man of many surprises. He toured briefly, and then returned to the 5tudio. The result is You Had It Coming, a solid album which presents the classic, bluesy wail of Beck's gui­tar against the backdrop of decid­edly modern dance beats and drum loops. 
You Had It Coming starts on a high note with "Earthquake." It's the kind of song sports teams use to pump up the crowd. "Earthquake" is a pounding repe­tition of guitar and keyboards, and even includes some vocals, which are rare on Beck albums. On another of the album·s finer tracks, "Rollin' and Tumblin'," Beck gets vocal help from promis­ing newcomer lmo~ren Heap. Heap's seductive voice carries the song. 
But for the most pari Beck lets his guitar do the talking. Remarkably, he only uses one guitar, at one setting, for nearly the entire album. This gives the work an overall good continuity, but it also gives some songs like "Roy's Toy" and "Dirty Mind" so much similarity that they seem to be indistinguishable. 
As usual, Beck coaxes an impressively varied number of sounds from his guitar. The album's real jewel is an instru­mental called "Nadia," originally written and recorded by Indian pop star Nitin Sawhney. In the hands of a master like Beck, nothing is lost in the translation from raja to rock song. His guitar perfectly mimics the styles of the Far East in this gorgeous, wistful piece. 
Though You Had It Coming is a good rock album. it isn't likely to earn Beck much more popular airplay. It's simply not commer­cial enough. 
What seems to distinguish Beck from more commercial guitarists like Santana or Eric Clapton is Beck's willingness to experiment in whatever he pleases, without concern for album sales. The finest example from You Had It Coming is an intriguing song called "Blackbird." It features the recorded call of a blackbird cou­pled with Beck's best attempts to mimic the bird's notes with his instrument. 

Because of his experimental flare, Beck's name is likely to remain familiar only to serious music fans. This is surprising for a man who has been one of the world's finest guitarists for more than 35 years. and has played alongside the likes of Rod Stewart and Mick Jagger. 
But no one seems less disturbed by his lack of publicity than Beck hjmself. He has a tendency to sud­denly disappear from music for years at a tin1e, neither recording nor touring. But even if Beck decides to take another long sab­batical. with You Had It Coming he has given his fans further proof that he is always worth the wait.

Sophomore Tameisha King performed solidly in the 60­meter hurdles and the long jump, earning third-place in the long jump and fourth in the hur­dles. Piane said King was not satisfied. 
"It' vou asked her, she'd tell 

you she could have done better 
in both," Piane said. 
King's long jump of 19-11 was a full foot behind Seton Hall's Nolle Graham. Gina Harris of Miami also jumped 19-11 but topped King with a longer sec­ond-best jump. 
In the hurdles, King entered the finals with the second-best qualifying time, before taking fourth in 8.49 seconds. Her per­formance provided five valuable poinl'i for the Irish. 
"She did a good job in the hur­dles for us," said Winsor. "She'll be the first person to admit that she could have taken second in the long jump." 
Kristen Dodd surprised coach­es and teammates alike, scoring in both the 60-meters and the 400-meters. 
Dodd was entered in the 60­meter dash more for experience than to cam points, yet she became the only lrish athlete to qualify for the finals in that event. Dodd 's time of 7. 73 sec­onds earned the Irish two valu­able points. 
In the 400-meters, sophomore Kymia Love took sixth place in 
56.16 seconds, while Dodd took eighth, running 57 .30. 
Because the 200-meters immediately followed the 400,

Grow did not compete in the 
shorter race, despite owning the 
best Irish time. Dodd's class­
mate, Ayesha Boyd, made up for 
Grow's absence, placing eighth 
in 25.27 seconds. 
Freshman Megan Johnson 
scored the only Irish points in a 
distance race, placing fifth in the 
mile in 4:57 .26. Sophomore 
Jennifer Handley just missed 
scoring in the 3,000 meters, 
placing ninth in 9:48.45. 
In the high jump, freshman Jennifer Kearney took sixth in her first ever away meet, clear­ing the bar at 5-4. 
"She had one good attempt at 5-6." Winsor said. "She needs to mature as an athlete and not let circumstances get under her skin and affect the way she's going to compete." 
In the pentathlon, sophomore Betsy Lazzeri placed seventh, accumulating 3375 points. Fifth­year shot-putter Emily Bienko just missed the finals in the shot­put as her throw of 42-9 placed eleventh overall. 
"l was really surprised that Emily's throw did not make the finals," Winsor said. "Her third throw was her best throw and I think she would have been able to score for us." 
The Irish also earned valuable points in the relays. In the 4x400-meter relay, the team of Grow, Love, Dodd and Boyd took fifth, finishing in 3:44. 73. 
In the 2-mile relay, the team of Johnson, Leanne Brady, Rachel Endress and Kristen Flood took seventh. 
The final relay, the distance medley, earned the Irish 2 points in placing seventh. Amanda Alvarez, Peterson, Flood and Endress finished in 12:13.20.

We can loose a sense of our need for God. It becomes easier to forget that the vast majority of the world's people live in severe poverty. And the pursuit of still more can preoccupy our endeavors. 
Fasting, prayer, and works of charity, as the Church recommends during Lent, break through the spiritual barrier of material over-abundance. The ancient wisdom of the monastic tradition tells us that if we can control the permissable desires, we will be

reasons, as well. Especially in a place as prosperous and enclosed as Notre Dame we need to be reminded that we are not the center of our world. Fasting combined with prayer opens us to our need for God. The practices of Lent can also fuel a spirit of generosity which leads us out of ourselves toward others who may need what we can give. In short, prayer, fasting and works of charity can awaken us again to the life of the Gospel.

clearing 6-5. 
"lie was sore," Winsor said. "It would have been a good thing if he could have hit the next height. He was working on a sore knee, and he gave us what he had." 
The Irish ea.med valuable points in the triple jump as freshman Godwin Mbagwu pulled out a jump of 48-2 on hi'i final atlcmpt to take second in the event. 
Sophomore Scott Kelley took sixth, hopping 44-11. 
"For a freshman to come through and move from fourth to second place on his last jump was very encouraging," Winsor said. "We couldn't be prouder of him." 
In the pole vault, junior Josh Heck and sophomore Nate Cahill broke out of season-long strug­gles to take second and fifth, respectively. Both athletes cleared 15-9, but Heck took sec­ond by virtue of less misses. 
"Both of them vaulted better," Winsor said. "They're still not where they need to be, where they want to be. We have two vaulters who can do some major damage outdoors." 
The Irish performed less than expected in the long jump. Sophomore Tom Gilbert, expect­ed to contend for first, took sixth, jumping 22-7. far less than his season best. Mbagwu took sev­enth, jumping 22-1. 
"I think it was just chalk it up 
to a had day," Winsor said. "We 
didn't get done what we needed 
to get done." 
Gilbert raced the 200-mcter 
preliminaries at the same time as the long jump. 
His sprinting appeared to affect his jumping, according to Winsor. Winsor expects Gilbert to be able to excel in both events, as 2000 graduate Marshaun West did throughout his Irish career. 
"We knew we were asking Tom Gilbert to put forth an effort that's not easy: to run the 200­meters and the long jump at the same time," Winsor said. "Those are things that we have to ask out ofour better athletes." 
In the sprints. the Irish failed to perform up to their capability, sending only two athletes to the finals. 
"The sprinters' performance as a whole was disappointing," said senior Terry Wray. "We didn't do what we prepared to 
do." 
Senior Travis Davey qualified for the last race in the 60­meters. finishing seventh in 6.99 seconds, only a hair ahead of former Notre Dame football player Cooper Rego, who was running for West Virginia. 
In the 400-meters, freshman James Bracken took sixth, finish­ing in 49.46 seconds in only his second time ever running on a 200-meter track. 
Wray, junior Mike Mansour 
and sophomore Nick Setta all 
failed to make finals in the 500­
m e ters, an event all three 
excelled in throughout the 
indoor season. 
The Irish came back to take 
fourth in the 4x400-meter relay. 
The team of tSetta, Wray, 
Bracken and Mansour finished in 
3:17.09. 
"We didn't place as high as we 
wanted to," Wray said. "but it 
was one of our best times of the 
season."

I 
! : 'El Papoose' belongs in the ring
I 
I 
I 
You're not going to see him on HBO or a pay-per-view fight on channel 128. 
You won't even see him box­ing in Bengal Bouts later this week at the Joyce Center. You'll prob­ably never get to see Edward llernandcz III, a Notre Dame junior from Lubbock, Texas, who sports somewhere near a 90-8 career record as an amateur boxer, lace 'em up and step into the ring. 
And that's a shame. 
Hernandez started boxing under the guidance of his dad at tho Boys and Girls Club when he was younger but didn't decide to devote himself l.o just one sport until his senior year of high school. 

"I was seeing guys that I had fought when I was little, and they were doing really well," he said. "I was just like. 'Man, I'm better than these guys.' I'll get a slate championship. It's cool with me. That just motivated me. seeing other people that I knew that I was better than. It motivated me to see how far I could go." 
There's probably a lot of guys out there who wish he hadn't gotten quite so motivated. The Texas State Championship in 1998 as a 147-pound fighter was a nice sidebar to being named the Texas Amateur Athletic Federation Athlete of the Year. 
That was good for the 10 spot in the national rankings. 
Hernandez describes himself as a finesse fighter, and prefers that style to that of lighters who just go out and wail away. His taste might differ from those of us who'll plop down the 50 bucks, buy (and then return) the big screen TV, and invite some people over to watch a fight. 
"l think most pcople ... IthinkJ ... when boxers move and throw straight shots, and move and throw straight shots ... they're scared," he said. "Whereas they want to see peo­ple just slug it out, go toc-l.o-toe. That's no skill. That's just: 'Let's see who lands ... the lucky shot first.'" 
To develop his personal mas­tery of this "hidden art" of box­ing, Hernandez has watched the styles of many fighters, from the great Ali to many of today's best. 
"l really like De La Hoya, and 1 really like Sugar Shane [Mosely!. and Roy Jones, Jr. -those are all pure boxers. They don't depend on knockouts, they don't depend on just one punch. They're boxers. They can do it all," Hernandez said. 
"They'rl~ smart fightArs, but they're not afraid to stand in there and slug it out if they need to. And that's what I respect." 
Given bolh the unique nature of the competition and training involved in boxing, I.he lessons 'earned between the ropes serve Hernandez well whatever he's doing. 
"I would definitely say that the mentality in the ring of depend­ing on myself, doing what I need to do to win the fight is exactly doing what I need to do to win in life," he said. 
So with all his other accolades

Bengal Bouts fighting in the 150 
pound weight class as a fresh­
man. 
What might surprise you is 
that the boxer known as ..El 
Papoose" isn't allowed to tight in 
Bengals any more. 
"They told me that I was a lia­bility," Hernandez said. "If someone were to get hurt while they were in the ring with me the question would arise that should that person even have been in the ring with me." 
Speaking from the perspective of someone who's been around the ring his entire life. he told me that the real danger lies in having two inexperienced fight­ers who might get llustered and then try to retaliate when they get hit. 
"Anybody that knows anything about boxing knows that there's definitely more opportunity to get hurt with two beginners than two skilled fighters." he said. 
Furthermore, when he was fighting in the Bouts his fresh­man year, Hernandez says he was never told his performance in the ring was a cause for con­cern. 
And in a way that wasn't cocky or self-absorbed but sim­pJy straightforward, he said: ''l think part of the reason was, too ... that they didn't think I could be beat. I think that was really unfair because they're the ones that should know what Bengal Bouts is about [raising money for charity]. and it's not about winning or losing, and ( think they lost sight of that." 
I talked to Rich O'Leary. a member of the Bengal Bouts administration, and he told me that it was much more ofa fair­ness issue than a safety concern that made for the final decision. 

no other tournament like it, and Trust me, Edward. A lot of us column are those ofthe author that's why I'd like to be a part of wish you were, too. and not necessarily those ofthe it." The views expressed in this Observer

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 

Now No. 2 Irish brace for Hurricane warning 
.. 
By TIM CASEY 
Assisrant Sports Editor 
The Irish may have lost on Saturday but don't expect Miami coach Ferne Labati to shed any tears for the Big East's top team. 
"As the season progresses, teams go up and down," Labati said. "But they'm still winning. They've got to be doing something right." 
With the 54-53 loss to Rutgers, Notre Dame (23-1 overall, 12-1 in Big East) fell to No. 2 in both the Associated Press and ESPN/USA TODAY polls. Tennessee (26-1 overall) vaulted to the top while Connecticut {22-2 overall, 12-1 in Big East) remained in third. 
Since then, a prevalent theme among Irish fans has been that Notre Dame's loss was somehow beneficial. 
Not one of the Irish playeri, would publicly agree with that logic. 
"It's never good to lose," fresh­man guard Jeneka Joyce said. "People are always like, 'Oh you needed that. It serves as a wake­up call.· All of us were very unhappy to have lost. We can take several things away from the loss but we just wished the out come would have been different." 
Notre Dame returns to the court tonight at 7 p.m. for a conference game against Miami. The Hurricanes arrived in South Bend Monday afternoon and practiced for two hours in the Joyce Center. Miami (13-11 overall, 6-7 in Big East) lost early season games to Florida International and Fairfield but has gone 4-1 in February. 
Freshman Chanivia Broussard, who starred at Miami's Northwestern High School, aver­ages a team-high 12.7 points and adds 5.3 rebounds per game. 
Junior Sheila James, sopho­more Alicia Hartlaub, senior Dalia Clarke and sophomore Meghan Saake join Broussard in the Hurricane's starting rotation. 

"The thing that have really cost us games are young kids making costly turnovers in critical situa­tions," Labati said. "That has really hurt us." 
In last year's 83-68 win over the Hurricanes on Feb. 22. Ruth Riley scored 36 points and 12 rebounds. She hit 18-of-23 from the line and was 9-of-16 from the field. 
"If the officials make all these calls," Labati said, "there's noth­ing you can do." 
Needless to say, Labati men­tioned containing Riley as her team's biggest target for tonight. The Hurricanes plan on imple­menting several defensive strate­gies to counterattack the lrish's balanced offense. 
Lately, though, coach Muffet McGraw has depended almost exclusively on her starters. Against Rutgers. the reserves did not score and logged only 25 of the possible 200 minutes of play­ing time. 
And in that same game, in which Riley scored just 12 points and fouled out in 25 minutes, the
