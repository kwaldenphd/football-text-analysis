Breslin, Rask to compete in run-off election 
District One Senate race also in Wednesday vote 
By JOHN O'BRIEN Staff Reporter 
Failure of a candidate to receive more than 50 percent of the votes in Monday's campus wide election has forced a run-off election for stu­dent body president and vice president and District One stu­dent senator. 
The run-off election, which will be held Wednesday, will be between the student body pres­ident/vice presidential tickets of Matt Breslin and Dave Kinkopf, and Tom Rask and Melissa Smith. 
In the District One Student Senate run-off, Scott Murray will face Chris Frigon. 
"Obviously we were happy we were able to get so many votes, but it would have been nice to have it all over with tonight," said Breslin who, with Kinkopf received 1,845 votes or 49.72 percent of the vote total. 
"We're very pleased, we're very excited to be in it this far,'' said Rask. He and Smith 
received 781 votes or 21.05 per­
cent of the vote total. 
In the District One Senate race, Frigon received 407 votes or 43.72 percent of the total vote. Murray received 302 votes or 32.44 percent. 
"Going into the race with · three candidates, the probabil­ity of a run-off was high," said Frigon. "I was encouraged by the voter turnout and the amount of votes that I received," he said. 
Murray said his "initial re­action was to get out there and get some posters out." 
A third candidate, Jim Nelis received 222 votes or 23.85 per­cent, but failed to win enough votes to include him in the run­off. 
In the District Two Senate race, Michael Gaffney defeated Megan Hines by a margin of 436 to 344 votes or 
55.9 percent to 44.1 percent. In District Four, Sigi Loy a

Problems with Fisher voting procedure 

By MARK MCLAUGHLIN Senior Staff Reporter 
A lack of regular student election proceedings at Fisher Hall may have played a part in the subsequent runoff election for student body president. 
Voting was not opened in Fis­her at all on Monday, forcing Ombudsman Rules Committee chairman Pat Stadter to start a door-to-door vote drive on Monday night. The regular voting did not take place be­cause of "miscommunica­tion," according to hall Judicial Board chairman Mike Stein­lage. 
"(Matt) Breslin and (Tom) Rask were about even in Fis­her," Stadter said. He added that no one could be sure whe­

Tony Brooks arrested for Sunday hit-and-run accident 
Observer Staff Report 
Sophomore tailback Tony Brooks, the second-leading rus­her on the national champion Fighting Irish football team, was arrested and ticketed for a hit-and-run accident and driving with a suspended license, South Bend police said Monday. 
No one was injured in the ac­cident, which occurred Sunday at 3:18a.m. when a car driven by a South Bend man was sides­wiped as a car ahead of him attempted a U-turn, police said. 
The auto struck the right side of a car driven by Kevin Cole­man, 39, and fled the scene. Coleman reported the car's description and a partial Indiana license plate number, police said. 
South Bend police inves­tigated a damaged car on the Notre Dame campus Sunday morning matching the descrip­tion after a Security officer re­ported it, Director of Security Rex Rakow said. 
"They came out to look at the car, and evidently Tony was cleaning out some stuff in it, and he admitted then being in­volved in an accident," said Rakow. 
The accident occurred in front of Memorial Hospital, where teammate Michael Stonebreaker is recovering from a Saturday accident when his car struck a sign pole. 
Brooks, 19, of Tulsa, Okla., was arrested on campus about nine hours after the accident was reported, said South Bend police Lt. Larry Bloom. 
He was released on the spot, and the arrest report was for­warded to the St. Joseph County Prosecutor Michael Barnes, police said. Barnes said he has not seen the report. 
Police Spokesman Sgt. Jeff Korros could not be reached for comment on what penalties the

Stonebreaker case forwarded to prosecutor, decision by Wednesday 
Associated Press 
The investigation report into a car accident involving Notre Dame linebacker Michael Stonebreaker was forwarded Monday to the county prosecu­tor, who may decide within 48 hours whether to file charges, police said. 
Stonebreaker, 22, of River Ridge, La., and a passenger in his car1 Ursula Garzia, 20, of Foxboro, Mass., were injured early Saturday when Stonebreaker's car left the road less than a mile north of campus and struck a sign pole on Route 33. 
Stonebreaker, an All-America selection on the na­tional championship Notre Dame football team, was in fair condition Monday at Memorial Hospital with a broken right knee and dislocated right hip. Garzia remained in serious condition with internal injur­ies. No other details were released. 
Tests showed Stonebreaker had a blood-alcohol level of .157 percent after the accident. In­diana's legal intoxication level is .10 percent. 
The test results and accident report were given to St. Joseph County Prosecutor Michael Barnes, said Cpl. Charles Feir­rell of the county sheriff's of­fice. 
Barnes could decide by Wed­nesday how to handle the case,

SMC Board looks at poor attendance 
By LAUREL VITALE News Staff 
Poor attendance at campus events this semester was the topic of Monday's Saint Mary's Programming Board meeting. 
Lisa Hill, vice president for Student Affairs, expressed her disappointment with the low student body turn-out to last week's Winteriest activities. Hill believes that the publicity for planned campus activities has been thorough and the en­tertainment has been of high quality. 
"We hope to get more future support from the student body for the hard work put into events by the Student Activities Board and the entertainers themselves," said Hill. 
The Board will sell St. Patrick's Day T-shirts begin­ning March 12. The shirts will be sold in the in Haggar College Center game room and will cost approximately $7. 
Student government is also co-sponsoring with Logan Cen­ter the sale of green clown noses forSt. Patrick's Day. The noses are $1 and available now in Haggar game room or from board members.

Student Senate clarifies SUB role 
By FLORENTINE HOELKER Staff Reporter 
Student Senate resolved arguments concerning pro­posed constitutional changes for the Student Union Board Monday and then voted unani­mously to approve the changes. 
The issue of SUB constitu­tional changes, tabled from last week, were controversial because "there was no context in the constitution to under­stand what's going on in the or­ganization (SUB)," said Stu­dent Body Vice President Mike Paese.

Although provisions were proposed to clarify the finan­cial activities of SUB, Paese objected that they would not be enough. 
Student Body President Tom Doyle emphasized that since SUB board members are not elected by the student body and because SUB has the largest budget of any student organi­zation, both their financial and their general policies should be under closer scrutiny of the senate. 
SUB manager Brian Reilly held that the provision to review the financial activities would suffice, but student gov­ernment and other members of senate disagreed. 
The issue was resolved with 
a proposal to add a new article 
to the constitution. The new ar­
ticle would create a council

Supreme Court paves way for local affirmative action trial 
Associated Press 
SOUTH BEND, Ind.-The city administration and a rejected fire department applicant may go to trial over an affirmative action hiring plan, officials said Monday. 
The U.S. Supreme Court, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck down the plan after it was challenged by a white man who was denied a job as a firefighter. 
Last December, the 7th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the South Bend plan amounted to unlawful reverse discrimi­nation. 
The appeals court said a dis­parity between the percentage of black employees in safety jobs and the percentage in the city's population was too vague to warrant denying jobs to white applicants. 
The suit was brought by Timothy Janowiak, who claimed he was unfairly denied

a fire department job because of race. 
"We are now set to come back down here and get ready for trial," said Thomas Bod­nar, chief deputy city attorney.· 
The city has new evidence not presented in the original case to support the need for the plan, said Bodnar. It includes figures showing the percentage of minorities in the city workforce, rather than in the general population. The city had been unable to provide that figure when the courts asked for it earlier, he said. 

It could be at least a year 
before the trial begins, Bodnar 
said. 
Janowiak's attorney, Patrick McFadden, said his client would consider discussing a settlement with the city. A tri­al, if one is held, might be lim­ited to issues of damages or Janowiak's employment by the department, McFadden added. 
The challenged affirmative action plan has remained in place during litigation, Bodnar said. Black and Hispanic employees currently make up about 17 percent of the police department and 13 percent of the fire department, he said. 
Census statistics from 1980 indicated the minority popula­tion of the city was about 20 percent. The percentage of minorities in the workforce may vary from that figure by 1 percent or 2 percent, he said. 

Indiana House passes bill to ban random drug testing in workplace 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS-Random drug tests of most employees, job applicants and student ath­letes would be banned under a bill narrowly approved Mon­day by the Indiana House. 
Lawmakers voted 53-47 for House Bill 1691, sponsored by Rep. Jerome Kearns, D-Terre Haute. Last week, the bill failed by one vote, 50-49, to ob­tain the constitutional majority needed for passage but because it wasn't defeated, it was eligi­ble for another vote. 

Meanwhile, the Senate ap­proved a drug-testing measure that would permit random test­ing of workers and job appli­cants but establish a rigid protocol for the tests. 
Kearns called the testing ban bill "of high importance." He argued that it protects citizen's right to privacy and assures them of their constitutional

protection against unreasona­ble searches and seizures. 
The bill, which now goes to the Senate, would permit drug tests only when there was probable cause to believe a worker, job applicant or stu­dent athlete was abusing drugs. 
High school and college ath­letes, including those now un­der school or NCAA-ordered random tests, would be protected from random testing under the legislation. 
However, the bill does not cover professional athletes whose collective bargaining agreements permit random testing and world-class amateurs who must take tests to compete in international competitions such as the Olym­pics and Pan American games. 
Mass transit workers also could be tested. New federal regulations call for testing of those workers. 
Rep. Jerome Reppa, R­Munster, called the bill "a ter­rible piece of legislation." 
"I wonder what kind of mes­sage we're sending to our children with this kind of bill," said Reppa. 
Reppa also said the bill would undo two Tippecanoe County high schools' drug testing pro­grams that have been upheld by federal courts. A federal dis­trict court and the 7th U.S. Cir­cuit Court of Appeals have up­held the plan of Lafayette Harrison and McCutcheon high schools to test athletes and cheerleaders. 
Reppa said lawmakers should instead support Senate Bill 265, which would permit drug testing of employees and job applicants but establish a protocol for conducting the tests. The measure doesn't ap­ply to students. 
That bill sponsored by Sen. Patricia Miller, R­Indianapolis, passed the Sen­ate Monday on a 26-24 vote. 
The bill would require com­panies to put their drug testing policies in writing; use specific testing methods and safeguards to ensure samples were not altered; allow re­testing if a sample tested pos­itive; and allow employers to discipline, fire, refuse to hire or require rehabilitation for workers who tested positive for drugs. 
The bill also would set out an appeals process for employees but would make employers who acted in good faith immune from civil lawsuits by employees who had false­positive test results. 
Sen. John Bushemi, D-Gary, said he opposed the bill because it would allow testing to be con­ducted randomly and without probable cause.

ther there would have been a 
runoff if Fisher's election 
process been run normally. 
The Breslin ticket was 11 
votes short of a majority of 
votes cast campus-wide. The 
totals of the door-to-door poll of 
Fisher residents were 30 for 
Breslin and 27 for Rask, with 
12 for the Dan Fahey ticket and 
5 for the Bob McTamaney 
ticket. Fisher's  total 
percentage of students casting 
votes was below the dorm 
average, according to Stadter. 
Mike Paese, student body 
vice president, said "they 
made the correct decision" to 
hold a runoff election. "We'd 
rather err on the side of ... 
being conservative and let the 
voters decide." 
Stadter said he heard from 
an unknown source at 5 p.m. 
Monday that there had been no 
elections in Fisher. "We 
decided to go around Fisher 
and give people the opportunity 
to vote," Stadter said. Accor­
ding to Stadter, a door-to-door 
vote was taken by Ombudsman 
Steering Committee member 
Vic DeFrancis, starting around 
7:30 p.m. and lasting for two hours. One person carried a ballot box and a voting check­list with him. 
These votes were tallied and 
counted as Fisher's votes. 
There was some discussion as to whether a second try at getting Fisher student votes was necessary, especially since the Fisher vote turnout was low and the runoff election was possible. 
"We decided in the end that we had given them (students in Fisher) ample opportunity to vote," Stadter said. "They didn't inform us until5 o'clock" that the regular election had not taken place, he added. 
The head of the Judicial Board in each dorm is respon­sible for overseeing all student government elections, Stadter said.

Bush returns after 5-day Asian trip 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-President Bush returned home Monday night from a five-day Asian voyage that he pronounced a "productive and rewarding" journey and moved to take per­sonal command of the struggle to win confirmation for John Tower as defense secretary. 
In a prepared statement he read at the foot of the ramp to Air Force One, Bush said his trip to Japan, China and South Korea demonstrated that the United States "is and will remain a Pacific power." 
"It's great to be home. God bless the United States of America," Bush said in the chilly darkness at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland. Vice President Dan Quayle was on hand to welcome the president back from his first overseas voyage. 
In his brief statement, the president said he had held "thoughtful and candid con­versations" with world leaders, including the several he met with in Japan, where he attended the funeral of Em­peror Hirohito. From there he went to China for two days, fol­lowed by a five-hour stopover in Seoul. 
"I return tonight pleased with the progress made toward lasting and mutually beneficial relationships," Bush said. He said work remains to be done toward encouraging the growth of democracy, working for human rights and strengthen­ing international alliances. 
Bush made no direct refer­ence to the Tower nomination in his airport statement. 
But in comments to reporters just before his plane touched down, he said, "No one has challenged his qualifications to head the Pentagon." 
"I don't have any predictions nor do I plan to except to say I haven't wavered one iota and I don't intend to," he said. 
Asked whether Tower's weekend vow of alcohol 
abstinence  would  help  his  
chances,  Bush  laughed  and  
said, "I don't know."

Democrats 'unmoved' on Tower 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Senate Democrats remained unmoved Monday on John Tower's nomination as defense secre­tary despite his unprecedented pledge to abstain from alcohol if confirmed. 
Senators trekked to a special committee hearing room to read the latest FBI report on Tower, while those members the Bush administration hopes to sway indicated they are either undecided or leaning against confirmation. 
Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., considered by some a swing vote, told reporters in Miami that Tower's pledge helps but "it's not just the drinking which is a problem to me." 
"It's a pattern of bad judgment-bad judgment in the 1970s in drinking, bad judg­ment by placing himself in compromising positions as the 
U.S. arms negotiator in Geneva in the mid-80s, bad judgment in accepting large sums from the defense industry in the late 1980s," Graham said. 
The Democratic-controlled Senate Armed Services Com­mittee voted 11-9 along party lines last Thursday to recom­mend that the full Senate reject the nomination, with panel chairman Sen. Sam Nunn, D­Ga., citing Tower's drinking habits among other concerns. 
Tower on Sunday sought to allay the fears of his former colleagues by issuing an ex­traordinary pledge not to take a single drink if he is con­firmed. The full Senate is ex­pected to take up the nomina­tion Wednesday. 
Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, meaning Bush must pick up at least five Democrats and hold all Republicans to assure con­

Grad Student Council now up to par 
As has been made public through an article in The Observer last Friday Feb. 24, and in a letter from the GSU to the graduate student body submitted to The Observer on Wednesday, Feb. 22, during its last regular meeting the Graduate Student Council approved (1) the proposed 1989-90 budget, which in­cluded a raise in the officer stipends, as well as raises in almost all other budgetary categories of the GSU (by 12 votes to 5), and (2) the recommenda­tion to the University Administration to increase the graduate student activ­ities fee from $20 to $25 (by 10 votes to 5, with two abstentions). 
Victor J. Krebs 
Graduate Student Union 
Chris Kennedy, graduate student in physics, has made allegations that "the GSU mishandled the Feb. 14 meeting... failing to notify council rep­resentatives about either the meeting or the issues." These allegations are false. Council representatives were reminded of the regular monthly meeting through the customary GSU memorandum. This reminder included not only a summary of the items to be discussed but also stressed the impor­tance of the representatives' atten­dance at the meeting. Furthermore, the monthly newsletter, Grad News, states that " (GSU) holds its meetings on the second Tuesday of every month at 7 
Problems with Grad Student budget 
Dear Editor: 
On Tuesday, Feb. 14, the Graudate Student Union pased its budget for the 1989-90 academic year. This budget con­tained two items that have raised my ire. These items are upsetting not only because they are in the budget but also because of the way they were passed. These two items are a 25 percent in­crease in the Graduate Student Activity Fee (from $20 to $25) and a 350 percent increase in the salaries for the Graudate Student Union officers ($400 to $1400 per year). The salary increase and the addition of an office worker's salary to the GSU brings salaries to almost 30 percent of the total GSU budget, and almost 50 percent of the budget if travel grant money is not in­cluded. 
As stated above there are several points in the enacting of these items with which I take exception. First, no mention was made in the Grad News which came out last Tuesday of the magnitude of the raise, the fact that a vote would be taken about the raise that evening, or that the GSU was planning to hire an office worker. The Grad News p.m. in the Notre Dame Room," and the last issue was distributed only two days before the Feb. meeting. 
The quorum required by the consti­tution is a minimum representation of five departments. Fifteen departments out of 26 were represented in the last council meeting, and (not including the five officers and travel grant chair) 17 Council members attended the meeting (not 13 as The Observer quoted). 
With our efforts this year attendance to the council meetings has dramati­cally increased. Although attendance at the last meeting was the lowest our administration has had this year, it was well above the average attendance last year, as Kennedy, having been an offi­cer of the GSU himself during that per­iod, is well aware. More importantly, the attendance at that meeting was well above the minimum quorum required by the constitution. 
Kennedy is also quoted in The Obser­ver article as claiming that "Krebs denied a request to postpone the vote on the budget increase until represen­tatives could speak to their constitu­ents." This, again, is false. In answer to the suggestion made by the physics representative to delay the vote, as chair of the meeting I explained that the vote was needed before the elec­tions and that therefore representa­tives should consider making the deci­sion at the current meeting. Representatives then agreed to con­sider the vote without delay, and no mo­tion was made to the contrary. They moreover requested a week to inform their constituencies before we made any public statement. That is the rea­son why the GSU letter to the graduate student body was not submitted to The Observer until Wednesday, Feb. 22. 
Kennedy also circulated a petition that "strongly opposed. . . the Graduate Student Union's plan to give their officers a 350 percent raise," and obtained signatures from six out of the 26 departments in the graduate school. But the petition falsely suggested that the increase would benefit the present 
officers of the GSU. None of the present officers will be running for those posi­tions. 
The decisions taken by the council were based on the judgment shared by the executive board that they were in the best interest of the graduate student body. As the vote shows, the council agrees that it is necessary to have an organization that effectively caters to the social needs of graduate students and represents their special concerns to the university administration. The votes also indicate their judgment that an effective organization is virtually impossible without offering incentives for the officer positions. 
What the executive board suggested in the proposed 1989-90 budget is a radi­cal change. We are transforming what were merely nominal stipends to a modest but reasonable remuneration for the work required by the officer pos­itions. Hence the approximately 250 percent (not 350 percent as the petition 

P.O. Box Q 
is the GSU's publication which is sup­posed to inform the graduate student population if issues pertaining to them. The only mention of a possible raise was in Victor Krebs' column where he advocated a raise in general. Since he has repeatedly called for a raise for GSU officers, no one would have any particular reason to believe that this editorial would be followed by a vote. 
Second, several departmental repre­sentatives were not informed of the meeting or the issues to be discussed. Since the meeting was held the evening of Valentine's Day, during a Notre Dame basketball game, many repre­sentatives did not attend. Several rep­resentatives have stated that they would have opposed the raises in fees and salaries had they known of the vote. 
Third, I have heard independently from four people that when a sugges­tion was amde to delay the vote so that representative could poll their depart­ments, Mr. Krebs said that the graduate population in general does not known what is going on and that the representatives should therefore per­suade departments that what the GSU does is good for them. Fourth and fi­nally, the enactment of this plan has not been publicized ahead of time in The Observer. Obviously news of an issue of this magnitude should be relayed as quickly as possible to the people it affects. In this case, it would probably would have been proper for the GSU to use The Observer for this purpose. 
I will be the first to admit that events can conspire to make things appear as they actually are not. If incorrect con­clusion have been drawn I apologize. I also warn members of the GSU that to the casual observer these facts would indicate that someone was trying to pull a fast one and they should not judge too harshly anyone who, correctly or not, come to this conclusion. 
I have been given a copy of the 1989-90 budget and here is how it breaks down: 
Total Budget: $29,700-100% 
Travel Grant: $12,000-40.4% 
Salaries: $8,700-29.3% 
All other expenses: $9,000-30.3% 
Once the information concerning these raises reached the physics and chemistry departments, there was very strong opposition to them. Sentiments generally ran between petitioning the University to block these raises and fol­lowing the example of the business school and withdrawing from the GSU. Perhaps the physics and chemistry de­partments are not a representative sample of the graduate student popula­states) raise in salaries. They con­stitute a remuneration of $3.10 per hour, on a very conservative estimate of 15 hours of work per week. 
It has been the aim of the present officers of the GSU throughout the year to make the Graudate Student Union a serious representative organization of graduate student interests. For anybody that has been following the news, or anybody involved with the stu­dent organizations or with the admin­istration, it has been apparent that great strides have been made in that direction. 
With the budget increase the GSU will have the ability to increase the fre­quency of social activities as well as continue the task of graduate student representation at all levels that we have begun. 
We have not received any personal benefits from this work, nor did we ex­pect to. We believe that we have estab­lished a solid groundwork for the future growth of the Graduate Student Union. With the support of graduate students and their active involvement the GSU can help improve graduate student life in all its aspects. 
We can only hope that the confusion and ill feelings caused by the action of one individual does not prevent graduate students from discerning what is in their best interest. 
Victor J. Krebs is president of the Graduate Student Union and is a regu­lar Viewpoint columnist. 
tion. If so, then withdrawing from the GSU appears to be the correct option since the GSU does not represent graduate students. On the other hand, if the reaction of these departments is representative ·of the views of the graduate student population in general, then the GSU is no longer serving is purpose of "representing the views of the graduate students." 
The main question of "do the GSU officers deserve a 350 percent raise?" still needs to be addressed. The only answer I have gotten from GSU repre­sentatives is that the purpose of this raise is to attract quality people to serve as GSU officers. There are many arguments about whether a raise will actually attract 'quality people' and what size of raise is needed. My per­sonal feelings are that a raise would not attract these people and that may actually be counterproductive. I hope that the current and future GSU ad­ministrations are willing to listen and respond to the people and thus elimi­nate the appearance of wrong that this episode seems to have brought.

fectly understandable why two men would wish to engage in unadulterated violence. After all, that is what men do--they fight to prove their self-worth!

Or, perhaps all that is required is a little ignorance; would a rational man really enter the boxing bolism of the "strong" fighting to feed the "weak" is powerful.

Unfortunately, after the last boxer hangs up his gloves and the last spec­tator leaves Stepan Center, the issue of hunger (not only in Bengal but in these meantime, the organizers of the Bengal Bouts should redirect their time and energy into a more compassionate and civil fund-raising event for the hungry of Bangladesh.

Elvis Costello Spike 
Spike's unusual cast of characters shows Elvis' incredible diversity. 
KEVIN WALSH 
accent writer 
I 
f you put all the characters on 
Elvis Costello's new album Spike in one room, you'd probably have a riot on your hands. At the very least, you'd have a roomful of weird people. 
You'd have the disillusioned enter­tainer of "This Town"; _Bentley and Craig, the two convicted murderers from "Let Him Dangle"; Veronica, a senile old lady; and a dead priest, now working as God's court jester in "God's Comic." (Not to mention a God who wonders if he "should have given the world to the monkeys.") 
The room would also contain a mail-order bride and her new hus­band; a husband who knows his wife is cheating on him; Miss MacBeth, an old witch who terrorizes little kids in a neighborhood; a British soldier questioning his duty in Ireland; and a little boy whose father is leaving. 
If you added in all the musicians who helped out on the album, includ­ing Paul McCartney, Chrissy Hynde, Roger McGuinn, and T-Bone Burnett, you'd have a really noisy room. 

So if this United Nations of a cast doesn't already clue you in to this, Spike is an incredible demonstration of Elvis's diversity. His now classic early work was straight ahead rock and roll, but Spike combines musical styles as diverse as Irish folk music, torch songs, swing-jazz, and plain old classic rock and pop. 
"Veronica," the single off the al­bum, is a good starting place for the next volume of the popular Elvis Costello's Greatest Hits. A solid, driving pop song, co-written and per­formed with McCartney, this song sports a great melodic line and tight harmonies. Other notable songs in­clude "This Town," another great song in the more pop vein; "Pads, Paws, and Claws," a psuedo­rockabilly workout; and the in­strumental "Stalin Malone." 
With Spike, Elvis Costello renews his artistic license and matures into all the promise that his early work hinted at. It is a cohesive, ambitious and mature work that ranks with the best he's ever done.

Roy Orbison Mystery Girl New release brings that classic Orbison sound into the Eighties. 

KEVIN WALSH 
accent writer 
T 
here's always been something essentially weird about Roy Or­bison. The black clothes, the sun­glasses, the cheesy toupee. The fact that Letterman could dress Larry "Bud" Melman up to look just like him. 
Then there's the ghostly voice and the heartbreaking songs. Anybody who saw the movie "Blue Velvet" will never forget the dark aura his song "In Dreams" created. 
In the grand traditions of great comeback albums, Mystery Girl takes Orbison's classic style, his sound and his voice and places them all in an Eighties context. This is not revivalism, it's an update. Even the song titles sound similar: "Blue Bayou" into "California Blue," "Dream Baby" into "Dream You," and "Only The Lonely" becomes "The Only One." 
Similarly, the music purposely mimics many of Orbison's old songs. There's the almost-spoken intro, the classic booming snare keeping the backbeat, and the woo-woo backing vocals. 
"In the Real World," is probably the most effective song on the album. With his voice shaking into the upper registers, he sings a genuinely beauti­ful and horribly sad song, including the line "In the real world! we must say real goodbyes." It really works well. 
The two songs which are drawing the most attention on the album are the ones written by Bono and Elvis Costello. Bono's "She's A Mystery To Me" is surprisingly Orbison-like, but the biblical imagery and sneaky hook reveal it as a U2 song. 
Elvis Costello, who owes a more obvious musical debt to Orbison, turns in "The Comedians," a story about a guy who is trapped at the top of a Ferris wheel while his girlfriend runs off with the operator. It has some great lyrics, including the chorus line "I should be drinking a toast to absent friends instead of these comedians." 
Mystery Girl proves Orbison to be a real, vital talent and it's a real tragedy that his untimely death cut a promising comeback short.

ell, February is almost behind us, and if you haven't been thinking about JPW, the Bengal Bouts, that tough midterm coming up or packing your bags for Padre, then you might be someone who remembers that there are still new movies out there to be seen. 
The latest big release is en­titled "True Believer." In it, James Woods stars as Eddie Dodd, a college activist­turned-lawyer, renowned for taking on and winning the cases nobody else wanted. But with time, a change in philosophy and the smell of money, Dodd has since con­verted to defending guilty drug dealers for handsome cash rewards.

work for Dodd, the man he idolized throughout law school, in defending those who might otherwise go un­defended. In little time, unfor­tunately, he realizes that his hero has degenerated into a pot smoking, drug dealing defense lawyer, and it ap­pears the honeymoon is over. 
With impeccable timing, though, a case just like the Eddie Dodd cases of old comes along, and Barron con­vinces Dodd to take it. Of course it's a murder case, and as with most murder trial movies, it is long, compl­icated, and features a surprise "whodunnit" ending. Crediting Barron for making him see the light, Dodd returns to his old self, and the two become good friends. 
James Woods is energetic, but Robert Downey is im­memorable. The writing is a bit dry--a fair dose of gore, no sex, half-hearted attempts at comedy, and some neat black-and-white flashback scenes--but it will keep you going if you give it your full attention. 
Directed by newcomer Joseph Ruben, this film isn't bad (in fact, I highly recom­mend it for you murder mys­tery fans), it just doesn't reach out and grab you like the many stellar productions released over these past few months. So if you see it, take a date, sit in the back, and don't order any popcorn. About an hour into this one, you'll be enjoying yourself one way or another ....

Holtz looking toward next year with skeptical eye 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.­-Notre Dame's 1988 national championship football season officially will be over in about two weeks. 
"We're going to start spring practice March 15, have a ban­quet on the 17th and then the rest of it'll be history," Coach Lou Holtz said. "The rest of it'll be for the scrapbooks. We will never talk about it or think about it after that. 
"We're not going to even try to remain there. We're back on the ground and all we're going to try to do is fight for that sucker just like we did last year. That's the only way I know how to do it." 
Although the Aug. 31 season­opening Kickoff Classic is six months off, Holtz and Virginia coach George Welsh held a news conference Monday to start the hype for what is ex­pected to be the first sellout in the game's seven-year history (the first Kickoff Classic be­tween Nebraska and Penn State in 1983 drew 71,123 spec­tators to 76,891-seat Giants Stadium). 
Notre Dame conceivably could start out ranked No. 1 again, but Holtz, like every co­ach before him, would rather be No. 1 on Jan. 1 than Sept. 1. 
"I love to come to press con­ferences because then I find out what's going on at Notre Dame," Holtz said with a chuckle, fingering a preseason prospectus that said, "Veteran '89 Notre Dame grid squad ready to defend '88 national crown." 
"You'd think that we owned a paper factory up there," 

Lou Holtz 

Holtz said. "I've never seen so much information and facts put out by one university. 
"The SID's office can always be very optimistic and I hate to question the validity of all this work and this information, but we don't plan on defending anything. We plan on starting out this year and fighting for it just like we did last year. 
"To think we're going to be a good football team because we have some people coming back (46 of 58 lettermen, in­cluding 16 starters) would be as asinine and ridiculous as it was to feel that we were going to be a poor football team last year because we didn't have anybody coming back. 
"We've already lost an out­standing linebacker, Michael Stonebreaker (injured in an au­tomobile accident); (tailback) Tony Brooks will probably not participate in spring practice and who knows what else will happen as you go along. 
"We know we're going to have a difficult road ahead of us, and if something were to happen to (quarterback) Tony Rice, people have no idea how severe a predicament we would be in." 
Holtz also predicted that Vir­ginia would be in the preseason Top Ten, although that prob­ably is far-fetched since the Cavaliers are not a traditional power. 
They do return 18 starters from last year's 7-4 team that won its last five games and finished second in the Atlantic Coast Conference for the second year in a row. 
"We should have a good foot­ball team," Welsh said. "I'm not going to downplay things for us. "

Overall, Coach Welsh was satisfied with what he called a "solid, dependable perfor­mance." Notre Dame had gone into the meet thinking that their swimmers would be in the middle of the ten teams, and a fifth place finish did nothing to dispute that. The Irish found out that they could be compet­itive with some very strong teams. 
"We were less than 40 points from fourth place, and about 60 points from third," Welsh pointed out. "We also had some very good races between Duke, the second place team, and Notre Dame." 
The women's swim team will take a break for a while and then resume practice after spring break with a training program. They will also look forward to next year and hope to improve on their final record for 1988-89 of 6-6.

A battered and bruised wo­men's tennis team came within a game of upsetting Miami of Ohio this weekend, but Notre Dame's makeshift line-up could not achieve the victory. 
Mter decisively downing Il­linois 7-2 on Saturday, the Irish fell to the Redskins of Miami 5-4 in a match charged with emotion. Notre Dame, marred with injuries, had to readjust the roster halfway through the meet. 
Number four singles player, Kristy Doran, succumbed mid­match to a knee ailment that

left her struggling to walk in the third set of her match. Doran had won the first set 7-5 when the impairment began to hamper her performance. By the third set, she could hardly reach the ball and was forced to default. 
That left the Irish at 3-3 after the singles competition and with a position to fill at number two doubles. Resa Kelly com­bined with Doran's regular partner, Katie Clark, but the 

-tandem lost 6-2, 7-5. The top pair of CeCe Cahill and Tracy Barton won their match, set­ting the stage for the deciding contest at the number three spot. 
Playing at number three were Cathy Bradshaw and Kim Pacella. Pacella had the flu and sat out of the singles round, but felt strong enough for the doubles and wanted to make 
her contribution. The duo lost the first set 3-6, but came back with a 6-4 score in the second to split sets. In the third, Brad­shaw and Pacella were serving for the match and the meet, but could not seal the victory and lost 5-7. 
Despite the disappointing loss, Irish head coach Michele Gelfman had nothing but praise for her 2-3 squad, which lost to Miami 8-1 last year. 
"Every year we've gotten closer and closer and this year we were really ready to take it," said Gelfman. "The girls played their hearts out. At the end, we had Kim Pacella diving into the net going after balls. I can't ask for much more than that. 
"It was down to the wire and I really thought we had them. There were at least twelve deuces in the last game but we couldn't pull out the victory. With a full line-up, we had a legitimate shot." 
Doran was dominating her match when her knee, injured last week, began to wear from

"I don't know that it will have much effect on us," Olson said Monday. "I think our players have been there, not just this year but, with most of them, a year ago. 
"We'd like to finish the total season ranked No. 1," he said.

Duke held the top spot from the preseason through the first nine polls. Illinois replaced the Blue Devils for a week, fol­lowed by Oklahoma and then Arizona the first time around. 
Oklahoma's loss cleared the way for the Wildcats to regain the No. 1 ranking, and Sean El­liott made a 3-pointer and an­other oasket in the last 53 seconds as Arizona seized the opportunity against Duke.

Lewis reaches IH basketball finals 
By KEN TYSIAC Sports Writer 

The Rebels from Lewis Hall advanced to the finals of the women's Interhall basketball playoffs with an intense come­from-behind victory over Pasquerilla East on Monday night. 
The Rebels, who lost to P.E. on Sunday, have to beat Breen­Phillips tonight and again later in the week in order to win this double elimination tourna­ment, in which B.P. has yet to lose. 
It certainly didn't look good for Lewis in the first half. P.E. used its superior inside strength and balanced scoring to run out to a 19-9 halftime lead. P.E.'s zone defense frustrated the Rebels, who looked like they needed a miracle to come back in the second half. 
That miracle appeared off the bench early in the third quarter in the form of reserv.e guard Lori Ciccone. Ciccone h1t two three-pointers and was per­fect from the field in five at­tempts. Largely on the strength of Ciccone's shooting, Lewis closed the gap to 29-24 after three quarters. 
In the fourth quarter, Lewis's full court press really began to take its toll on Pasquerilla East, and when Ellen Mouch made two free throws with less than two minutes to play, Lewis had its first lead of the ball game at 33-31. P.E. countered quickly with a power layup by Colleen O'Connor. 
But Sue Lippa answered with an inside bucket for Lewis with one minute to play and the Rebels used good foul shooting to kill any hopes P.E. might have had of catching up. Lippa and Marcie Powell, who consis­tently burned P.E. with baseline jump shots, each had 13 points for Lewis, while Cic­cone finished with 12. 
Tonight's matchup against Breen-Phillips should be an even greater challenge for Lewis. The Blitz are even more talented than P.E. inside, and have not had a close game yet in the playoffs.

Mter battling their way through rigorous post-season action, Morrissey and Fisher meet tonight in the pit of the Joyce ACC to possibly deter­mine the men's Interhall baket­ball champion. 
A win tonight by Morrissey would lead to a second game Thursday night to decide the champion. 
Morrissey, after losing in the winner's bracket of the playoffs to Fisher, defeated Alumni 72-50 to gain the berth against the Green Wave, 10-1 going into the contest. 
An up-tempo style and strong defense key the Manor attack, led by returning starters Tom Veltz, Kevin Keyes, and Der­rick Johnson. Kevin Cade and Rod Culver also start for the Manor. 

"Our offense is strongest on the fastbreak and we'll need to prevent Todd Wagenblast and Paul Fulling from getting off the shots they want," said Veltz. 
Morissey went undefeated through the regular season last year before losing its first two playoff games. 
"We came out overconfident after going undefeated through the season and didn't play well at all," said Veltz.
