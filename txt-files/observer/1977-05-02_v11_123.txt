SBP Rukavina appoints St. Mary's cabinet posts 
by Marti Hogan Editor-in-Chief 

Vowing that she owed no favors to anyone, Student Body President Mary Rukavina recently announced the names of 12 new student government appointees. 
The Executive Committee, con­sisting of Rukavina, Kathy O'Con­nell, vice-president for Student Affairs; Kathy Hedges, vice presi­dent for Academic Affairs; Stevie Wernig, assistant dean for Student Affairs and Mary Lu Bilek, former student body president conductd the interviews and made the final decisions. 
Junior JoAnn Baggiano will replace Mary Klassen as Social Commissioner for next year. Baggiano, who served on Social Commission this year as Special Events Chairperson, plans to con­centrate on maintaining the same events as the Commission spon­sored this year and to expand the commission to include more people. Each of the approximately eight chairpersons within Social Com­mission would have her own com­mittee, so the same people won't have to be doing all the work." 
While she hopP.s to encourage students to support St. Mary's activities, Baggiano would like to work closely with Notre Dame's Social Commission. "We need a creativegroup and the more people involved, the more ideas we get," she said. 
Mary Ann Fuchs, a sophomore, will take over the position of Co-ex commissioner held this year by Beth Cutter. According to Ruka­vina, the Co-ex commissioner will have more responsibilities next year. A lunch co-ex program is now being set-up to supplement the dinner program. The shuttle bus committee and the calendar committee also will be under the jurisdiction of Fuchs. 
Junior Julie Pellettierewill serve 

as Development Commissioner re­
placing Patti Schirmer. As devel­
opment Commissioner, Pellettiere 
will be responsible for ''anything 
to do with fund raising, such as 
United Way and the Phonathon," 
Rukavina explained. 
Also appointed were junior Betsy 

Bistric, secretary to the Academic Affairs Council; sophomore Mari­anne Frost,secretary of the board of governance; junior Mary Beth Leslie, treasurer of the board of governance and sophomore Beth Leahy. secretary to the student assembly. 
Maria Lisa Magnanelli will re­main Election Commissioner. 
The position of Spiritual Com­missioner, reinstated this year by Rukavina. will he filled by fresh­man Jeannie Ritter. "We'd like to get the spiritual spirit back at St. Mary's," Ritter explained. She hopes to accomplish this by chan­neling the students' "vitality through religious activities. 
In an attempt to fill gaps within government. Rukavina has created three new positions: Sports Com­missioner, Public Relations direc­tor and a special advisor to the executive committee. 
Amy Hartzell, a freshman, has been appointed Sports Commis­sioner. She will be working in conjunction with the new athletic director. Since the director will not be announced until next fall, Hartzell's duties are"ambiguous at this time," Rukavina said. Her main function however, will be as a liason between the director and the students in establishing new sports or clubs for example. She will also be responsible for planning intra­mural activities and tournaments. 
Junior Marv Pinard will serve as 
Public Relations Director. Accord­
ing to Rukavina, "This is a much 
needed position that has been 
overlooked in the past.'' Rukavina 
believes that with one person 
prganizing publicity for the various 
jepartments of student govern­
ment, things will be done more 
efficiently. 
Terry Tuohy, sophomore, will 
serve as an advisor to the executive 
board in the capacity of a "resource 
person or secretary." Students 
may call her with any questions and 
she will serve "as a screen" so 
Rukavina is not bothered with 
detailsthat can better handled by 
the commissioners. 
"Terry was the logical person for 
that position," Rukavina said, 
adding that Tuohy has served in a 
number of government positions in 
her two years at St. Mary's. These

Danehy responds to motion 
by Joan Fremeau Senior Staff Reporter 

In a 21-page rebuttal to the University's Motion to Dismiss. Paul B. Kusbach, attorney for James Danehy, point!) out the dissimilarities between this case and the Lewis vs. Salem case used by ·the University to support its motion. 
The hearing on this motion will take place this Wednesday at 3 
p.m. at the Starke Circuit Court in Knox, Ind. 
Calling the University's analysis of the case "poorly filtered and incorrect," the brief states, "Bas­ed, then, upon a clearer analysis of 
H. Michael Lewis vs. Salem Aca­demy and College, the Starke Circuit Court can and must itself determine whether plaintiff's (Danehy's) complaint states a cause of action, without the "on all fours" assistance of the Salem Academy and College case. It simply is not "on all fours." 
Lewis alleged that his employer had a tenure policy to age 70. He argued that his "terminal contract of 1972-3 executed when he was 66 years of age, and the written retirement policy in the Faculty Guide were both altered by cus­toms and usage to provide for de facto tenure until age 70." Lewis tried to recover his salary and other benefits that would have accumu­lated during the four years between the 72-72 terminal contract and his reaching 70 years of age. The court denied he had a right to tenure. 
The first dissimilarity discussed in the brief is that Danehy has one contract, executed Apr. 10, 1972, when he became full professor with tenure, while Lewis had a "series (that amounted to 22) of written one-year contracts which began with the one made in the fall of 1950 and continued thereafter for successive years, to, and including the final terminal contract for the academic year 1972-73." 
Danehy does not have any later contracts "which in any manner" modify or supersede his April 10, 1972 contract, as did Lewis, the brief pointed out. 
A second major distinction be­tween the two cases is that Lewis "sought salary and other benefits which would have accrued to him during the four year period he claims he would still have been under contract even though he had a terminal contract following the one upon which his claim was based," while Danehy "seeks e­quitable relief in the form of an injunction against" the University, the document states. 
Danehy hopes to prevent the University from dismissing him ''based on his permanence of appointment through tenure or from dismissing him without fol­lowing what the Court determines are the appropriate and detailed procedures provided for in the Faculty Handbook." 
Finally, Danehy is seeking free­dom from discrimination, the brief adds. 
Danehy maintains that "the termination of his permanent ten­ured appointment can only be done by the University when it complies

Although most freshman ath­letes enter Notre Dame with aca­demic qualifications relatively simi­lar to those oftheir classmates, the class rank and test score results of a few fall considerably below the Notre Dame average. 
Admissions Director John T. Goldrick indicated that no statisti­cal minimum standard exists for the admissions evaluation of any student, including scholarship ath­letes. According to Goldrick, each applicant's "total file" is consider­ed, and the results of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) are "only one part of the total picture."

Scholarship athletes 

'Total picture' examined 
average finished in the top third of their high school classes, scoring an average of 946 on the SAT. Combined math and verbal scored ranged from a high of 1250 to a low of 490, with six players recording a total of less than 800. Freshmen hockey players performed better on the exam, averaging a total of 1146, 
1 ranging from a high of 1330 to a low of 750. They also finished on the average in the top quarter of their classes. No data was available on freshmen basketball players. The freshman class average on the SAT according to the admis­sions office is 1180, 625 on the mathematics section and 555 on the verbal portion of the exam. A total score of 400 is awarded before answering any questions on the test, and points are added or deducted as appropriate. According to Fr. Edmund P. Joyce, executive vice-president in charge of athletics, Notre Dame is unique in requiring its scholarship athletes to take the SAT. "I have heard that we're one of the few schools left that requires college boards for their athletes," he said, adding that the absence of pressure to perform well on the test often led "blue-chip" prospects to approach the exam casually. 
SAT's meliable 

Goldrick noted that admissions evaluates the profile of each candi­date and considers his or her talents and abilities as an impor­tant part of their application. "A truly great University," he com­mented, ''brings together a diver­sity of outstanding people. There are other students, besides the athletes, that have low SAT scores." He cited disputes among educators about the value of the test as a measure of success in college, remarking that some be­lieve the test to be culturally biased. 
Joyce reported that the exam was particularly unreliable when applied to measure the success of , athletes at Notre Dame. "I've been at it for 25 years now," he 
said, "and I've found that there is very little correlation between col-· lege board scores and how the athlete does at Notre Dame.'' He added that there was some correla­tion between how other students performed on the exam and their subsequent academic success but that it too was often unreliable. 
Pointing to the disadvantaged backgrounds of the majority of athletes with poorer academic qual­ifications, Sports Information Dir­ector Roger Valdiserri stated that the University has a "social re­sponsibility" to assist the under­privileged. He explained that many athletes are never placed in an environment conducive to study, and as a result compiled inferior academic records. Notre Dame frequently offers such disadvan­taged individuals their first ge­nuine opportunity to learn, accord­ing to Valdiserri. 
"What challenge is it to the University to educate the top five percent of -the kids across the country?" he asked. "The real challenge is to bring in disadvan­taged people and do something with them." The admission of athletes with this type of back­grounds, he said, constitutes one part of an effort in this direction by the University. 
Valdiserri echoed Joyce's view concerning the high school exper­iences of highly-recruited pros­pects, commenting that substan­dard academic records were under­standable since many athletes, particularly those with disadvan­taged backgrounds, concentrated principally on athletics. 
Desire-to learn Important 

"You can't measure desire to succeed mathematically," Valdi­serri said. "I've seen kids come in with board scores of 1100 and fall flat on their face." He added that others with SAT scores ranging from 500 to 600 had performed well once admitted.

Harvest House mobilizes elderly for self-development 
(continued from page 4] October, at which candidates for also sponsors such non-course of­statewide office were invited to ferings as films, tours, concerts, speak, as an example of the kind of discussions, workshops and a, political activity which attracts 
weekly lecture series. 
Sr. Madeleine Adamczyk is exe­cutive director of the Forever Learning Institute. Adamczyk, her 1 assistant, Judy Deardorff, and two · others on her staff constitute the only paid workers on the institute's staff. Celebration, political 
action stressed Putz calls the recreation and celebration aspect of the program "constructive and challenging." ­Harvest House, he said, "openly condemns the notion that old age is nothing but a 'glorified playpen.' 
or  that  care  of the  aged  means  
simply  to  entertain  the  older  
folks."  

"There are all kinds of opportu­nities to celebrate and we use them all," Putz related. Birthdays and anniversary celebrations give older people occasions to get together socially and for many of them, it is their only chance to get out the good clothes that have been hang­ing in the closet and really dress up. he said. Group theater trips and lectures can also be arranged, as well as bus and plane trips. Harvest House groups have gone to the Grand Ole Opry. the tulip festival, in' Holland,Mich .. Chicago, Disneyland, the Wisconsin Dells and out in the East for a bicenten­nial tour last year. 
Mobilizing the vast political po­wer of the elderly is another goal of Harvest House. As a fast-growing minority with a good voter turnout record. the elderly have the poten­tial clout needed to make their voice heard. Harvest House en­courages its members to procure by their vote adequate care and atten­tion from government agencies for themselves and for others who are in need. "We want the politicians to know what the needs of the elderly are.'' Putz said. 
He cited a forum attended by .

attention in Indianapolis. The event 
was sponsored by the Northern 
Indiana Older Adults Legislative 
Forum, which keeps tuned to what 
the legislature is doing and urges 
law-makers to support legislature 
for the elderly. 
Indiana is ranked fiftieth among all the states in use of federal funds to help the elderly, Putz pointed out. He attributed this to Governor Otis Bowen's reluctance to start -programs on federal funds that the state may not be able to continue after three years if federal money 
runs out. 
"Harvest House is not just a 

center--it's a movement. We try to 
reach out to others and get them on 
the job," stated Putz. He explain­
ed that he sees in the elderly a 
tremendous reservoir of talent, 
responsibility and power. 
"All this talent and all these 

skills must be recognized and 
respected. People of this caliber 
can continue to shift for themselves 
and to simultaneously serve those 
less fortunate than themselves," 
Putz affirmed. "Harvest House 
merely went ahead and routed 
them out of their hiding places, got 
them organized into a strong, 
united body and set before them as 
a goal one more beautiful chapter 
in their lives." 


Allard· Lowenstein discusses U.N.· Human Rights Commission 
bv Mark Perry Staff Reporter 

Allard Lowenstein, U.S. repre­sentative to the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations in Geneva, spoke about his ex­periences at the Commission meet­ing and about what he believed came out of that meeting in regards to human rights last Thursday night at the CCE. The talk was part of the Human Rights Symposium held at the Center for Continuing Education last week. 
Lowenstein was also an advisor to Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and is most noted for his work in blocking the nomination of Lyndon Johnson for the presidential candidacy in 1968. He also served as a congressman from New York's fifth district and while in the House of Representa­tives sought to end the war in Vietnam. 
Lowenstein said that what they 

tried to do at the meetings of the Human Rights Commission was ''to universalize the concerns of the Commission in order to give it some credibility" and "not to point fingers at anybody, but rather to .refuse to exempt anyone from having their situation cliscussed, and through this gaining of credi­bility for the Commission to hope that in some way we could be of some use to some people who were suffering needlessly from external 
causes that could be eased." 
In order that something hopeful might emerge from this Commis­sion, Lowenstein said, "You ought to stand for something, under­standing that the vehicle you are in is limited, and you are not in a position to enforce human rights. 
What you can do is to try and find a way that your convictions can be committed to something that will. raise a sense of humanity, and you will not judge everyone else but hope that there will be areas with everyone where you can cooperate wit~?ut abandoning what you stand for.

tinued, "we have some indications that this approach is coming at the right time and can have a very wide impact at that first stage, changing the atmosphere among govern­ments. Whether it then gets to the next stage, helping people we should be helping, itis very early to try and judge.'' 
"We were going through this mechanical proceedure," Lowen­stein continued, "and it struck me sitting there that this was a ·dreadful way to end, because som"' very hopeful things had happened, and above all there had been candor in the discussions." 
Lowenstein then told about how the representative from one of the other countries, who said that Lowenstein's remarks were "the most peculiar intervention I have heard in all my years of attending United Nations meetings, and per­haps the most useful." 
The representative then went on to discuss what the Human Rights Commission ought to be doing and closed saying "I hope that when we leave this building that we will stop outside for one moment and look back at it and ask ourselves not what have we done for our govern­ments, but what have we done for 
mankin~." 
The mood of the meeting changed drastically after that, Lowenstein remarked, to the point where "people were rushing a­round trading addresses and hugs were exchanged across block lines." Then the chairman, the delegate from Yugoslavia, "went into a discussion of what he hope would happen as a result of the remarkable things that had hap­pened here,'' Lowenstein said, "including that we should meet as human beings to discuss these questions away from government restrictions and publicity so we could figure out whether we couldn't move on from what had happened at this meetine." 
"In the course of th~ Human Rights session,'' Lowenstein con­tinued, "on issues that had never before been dealt with, people talked." 
Lowenstein remarked that his was the first time that the outcome of votes could not be predicted, and that they beat the Russians on votes where the Rus­sians were wrong, to the point where the Soviets and their allies had to attend meetings that they had never attended before. This was due to a fear of losing on decisions that would affect the future of the Commission. 
"If you take these limited possi­bilities and understand them, we are talking about talking, and everyone should be talked about," Lowenstein said. "When the Bulgarians tried to prevent our talking about the Soviet Union," he continued, "not a single unaligned country in the Human Rights Commission spoke up in support of their effort, and we talked about what was happening in the Soviet Union."

Brademas criticizes Carter on human rights policy 
by Bob Varettoni Senior Staff Reporter 

John Brademas, Democratic .congressman from Indiana's Third District, criticized the Carter Ad­ministration's implementation of its human rights policy at the conclusion of the Notre Dame Human Rights Symposium Sat­
urday morning in the CCE. 
"I'm not satisfied that there is 

the same concern for human rights 
in April of 1977 that 1 heard in 
October of 197(1," Brademas said. 
Brademas added, however, that 

he is "willing to give Carter more 
time." He also noted that Congress 
can still expect more support in the 
area of human rights under Carter 
than is had under previous admini­
strations. 
"We're no longer discussing the 

question of whether the United 
States should take into considera­
tion human rights in foreign policy 
decisions, but bow," Brademas 
said. "Under Dr. Kissinger, 
human rights was considered a 
very high risk stance, the snubbing 
of Solzhenitsyn being only the most 
blatant example." 
Until recent years, Brademas 

said, Congress has been "rele­
gated to the role of rubber stamp or 
cheerleader" for the incumbent 
administration. According to the 
House majority -whip, Congress 
after Watergate has taken a more 
active role in shaping national 
policy, and this includes issues 
about human rights. 
"Members of the executive 

human rights. "Congress likes what they heard, but they're not convinced that human rights is. going to. stay a firm ingredient in the government policy," he said. 
Fraser discussed several wavs Con,gress can monitor an admini­stration to uphold a standard for human rights in its foreign policy. One way is for Congress to cut military aid to countries whose a¢tions is does not support. 
The restriction put on aid to Korea in 1975 resulted from what Fraser called Congress' "frustra­tion with the administration and its indifference to human rights viola­tions." Fraser also noted that "economic" aid to Chile was cut when Congress discovered the money was used to support a military regime that violated human rights. 
Fraser added that he sees a 
reduction in the need for Congres­
sional monitoring of the executive 
branch under the Carter admini­
stration. He favorably compared 
this administration to the Nixon 
and Ford administrations where 
"confrontation (with Congress) 
rather than cooperation was the 
order of the day." 
Responding to questions, Fraser 

outlined a foreign affairs approach 
he considered "more conser­
vative" than the approaches of the 
other members of the conference. 
In reaction to Cile's recent abolish­
ment of the Christian Democratic 
Party, Fraser said, "Chile may 
have to find a way out of its own 
problems."

Robertson talks on Helsinki pact 
by Drew J. Bauer Senior Staff Reporter and Tim Lew Staff Reporter 

Speaking Friday night at the sixth Human Rights Symposium, Harvard University Law Professor, 
A. H. Robertson, lectured at the Center of Continuing Education on "The Helsinki Agreement and Human Rights." 
''The first thing we must accept is that the Helsinki Agreement is not a treaty. It is just a declaration of intention," he said. Robertson added that there were several differences between the declara­tion of intention and a treaty. Among these differences were 
that a declaration is not binding and does not have to be agreed to by the national legislature, while a treaty must be approved by the body. Also, if a country breaks a treaty, they could be tried in the International Court, while a coun­try that breaks a declaration could not be tried. 
''A declaration of intent is just that--a declaration that a country intendsto follow certain principles laid down on paper," Robertson said. 
The law professor then went on to explain the background of the agreement and why the 35 coun­tries signed it. "The main reason that there was an agreement is that the Soviet Union wanted the West­ern Powers to accept its boundary lines which grew after World War 
II. "The Soviets had a lot to gain, and the Western Powers had a lot to lose," Robertson said. 
In order to acknowledge the 

Soviet additions of territory, the Western Powers wanted a universal guarantee of human rights by all the countries involved in the agree­
ment, according to Robertson. 
Robertson said that the Eastern 

Powers only agreed to the issue of 
human· rights because they were 
able to place in the agreement a 
clause that each country would stay 
out of each others internal affairs. 
"Even with the resolution that 

guarantees that a country will 
agree to stay out of each others 
internal affairs, there are laws that 
guarantee the basic fundamentals 
of human rights," Robertson said. 
He said that under two United Nations covenants, acountry must respect the hum.m rights of its citizens, and that a country has a right to call attention to another country actions in breaking the human rights covenant. "So even though the Eastern Block thought that they prevented the Western Powers from calling attention to their internal affairs, the Western 
attention to human rights viola­
tions." 
However, Robertson said that 

several countries involved in the 
agreement have not yet ratified the 
articles, and that the rriain goal of 
the Western Powers should be to 
have these Communist countries 
ratify them. 
Robertson said that the agree­

ment did not satisfy either of the 
parties. "The agreement was more 
widely publicized in Eastern Eu­
rope because it recognized the new 
boundary lines. But they did not 
publicize the human rights caus­
es," Robertson said. He added 
that in the West most of the people 
did not understand it or called it a 
sell-out. ''One might have thought 
that it might have lead to the 
opening of a new round of more 
open discussion between the East 
and the West. But that hasn't 
happened yet." 
Robertson said that although . there were several arrests in the 
East of dissenters, ''the Agree­
ment has had an effect in Eastern 
Europe far more than we expected 
so soon. Because of the agree­
ment, there are new opportunities 
and encouragement to those that 
are ready to fight for their rights." 
In reflection of the future of the 

agreement, Robertson said that the 
Soviet Union is ready to indict 
Great Britain in the International 
Court because of alleged crimes 
she had committed in Northern 
Ireland. "I hope that the Western 
Powers do not cry that they are · interfering in our internal affairs. 
Let us recognize our actions, and 
hope that we can get them to recognize our own." 
Hesburgb tells Carter's topic 

Robertson was introduced by University President Theodore Hesburgh, who disclosed that Pres­ident Jimmy Carter will speak on the issue of human rights at the Notre Dame commencement cere­monies in three weeks. 
Hesburgh said that when Carter spoke at the CCE last fall as a candidate, Carter said that we should be concerned about human rights around the world. and that we have "responded inadequately to human suffering around the world." 
In addition, Hesburgh said that when Carter became President, he made a speech to the world to tell "them that there will be no doubt where we stand on the issue of human rights around the world." 
"In view of this," Hesburgh said, "I have asked that Carter will speak again on the issue of human rights, and he has agreed. Res­burgh added that the White House has asked that the papers of the symposium be sent to the President so that he could study them before 
, his speech. 
: If Carter does talk about human rights, it will be the first such talk since the Soviets refused his SALT proposals. At the time, officials at the scene said that one of the main reasons that the Soviets did not agree to Carter terms was that they were upset on Carter's stand on human rights and his intervention in their internal affairs.

That Fr. Louis Putz has not withdrawn to a corner to sit in a rocking chair and gather dust since his retirement as rector of Moreau Seminary five years ago should surprise no one. 
His life has been a series of unending, ever-changing activities, dating back to before his arrival in the U.S. from Bavaria at age 14, alone and knowing no English. Sent to America by an aunt in 1923 to become a Holy Cross priest, young Putz waited ten days at Ellis Island while authorities tried to figure out who would be responsi­ble for. him. 
Putz made his final vows here in 1931 and graduated from Notre Dame in 1932, before returning to Europe and his ordination in Paris. The 1930's were a period of involvement with innovative French priests and theologians. But his work with the French Catholic Action movement and the Young Christian Workers was cut short by the beginning of World War II. 
Arrested by the French as a German national, he escaped from detention camp and got himself aboard a British ship without .;howing his swastika-imprinted passport. Return to the U.S. was not , so difficult this time; the immigration officer was a fellow alumnus whose only question was why Notre Dame had lost to Iowa. 
Putz then returned to Notre Dame and took up teaching. As a religious instructor, he organized the Young Christian Students (YCS) movement, operating on the same "Observe-Judge-Act" prin­ciple as the Young Christian Work­ers in France. YCS, which had about 200 active members each year, according to Putz's estimate, advocated the admission of black students from its beginnings in 1940. It also set us the student book exchange, which lasted 20 years, established the Campus Press, organized dances in downtown South Bend and worked to set up the stay-hall system to improve the community spirit in campus dorms. 

As students in the movement grew older and married, meetings moved into their homes, and the Christian Family Movement (CFM) was born. CFM, which was active in the late 1940's and through the 
1950's, supported a stronger family 
and more activity in Church life. 
Shortly after the joint editorship of a book on the reform of seminary education with James Michael Lee, another Notre Dame professor, Putz found himself appointed rec­tor and superior of Moreau Semi­nary. At Moreau, Putz effected sweeping changes, and in the spirit of post-Vatican II renewal, a sys­tem of "maximum freedom with minimum structure" was instituted at the seminary. 
Putz stepped down as Moreau rector in 1972, received emeritus status in 1974 after 35 years on the theology faculty and left the post of head of Fides Publishers in 1975. 
But Fr. Louis Putz was far from through. He took over as director of Family Life Services in the South Bend-Fort Wayne diocese and had soon expanded the Church's minis­try to the elderly by the establish­ment of the Harvest House aposto­late and Forever Learning Institute in South Bend. 
Putz sees his ministry as a sort of continuum. "It so happened that ' the Young Christian Students got . married and started the Christian Family Movement," he said in an I interview with the National Catho· hidden talents; a time to use leisure hours in exciting ways." 
According to Putz, the American work ethic equates· material pro­ductivity with a person's respecta­bility and usefulness. ''The retiree · has to learn how to enjoy leisure without guilt feelings, how to use it constructively and how to discover sociability in a new way. Retired folk need to overcome the hangup of no longer being materially productive and to be re-educated in the use of their time for the pursuit of the spiritual, the aesthetic and the cultural values they never had time for during their busy work 
· years." 
The individual units exercise autonomy within the flexible struc­ture of a general philosophy. For each center, there is a presiding couple, a vice-president, a trea­surer and a task force which assists the officers in planning and imple­menting activities. Delegates from each parish unit (usually the pre­siding couple) and the executive director, the coordinator and the director of the Forever Learning Institute, which is the educational arm of Harvest House, comprise the "Harvest House Council." The council acts as a clearing-house of information among the various centers and as a shaper of policies which will be proposeJ to the individual centers. 
A new parish unit can be· started when a pastor asks Harvest House organizers to come in. Once interest has been indicated from the parish, Harvest House repre­sentatives meet with a group of 20 to 30 elderly parishioners and after a brain-storming session to esta­blish needs and possibilities, plan­ning for the new center gets underway. All residents of the community, regardless of religion, are invited to join. Putz pointed out that Harvest House participation is not limited to Catholics. Two synagogues, 42 Protestant chur-· ches and 22 Catholic parishes are j served by Harvest House. 
Putz remains active ·as organizer~ 
FR. lOUIS PUTZ aged I work with are some of the I same people, moving into yet ; another· period in their lives. You see, it's been the same idea all the way along--people of the same generation working with one another to promote the welfare of themselves and of society at The organization of Harvest 
House is structured to activate the 
potential of older adults to help 
themselves and their community. 
Putz added that while young people 
are welcome to help, it must be the 
elderly who run the program. 
Six-point program 

A six-point program guides .the philosophy of Harvest House: social awareness, self-help and service to the community, religious experiences, educational and cul­tural advancement, recreation and celebration and political power. 
Putz explained 'social aware­ness' as "learning how to be proud of themselves." Society owes re­spect to the elderly and should look to them for the wisdom of a life well-spent, he continued. 
A center encourages its mem­bers to reach out to one another, as well as to others in need of help or companionship. The 80 percent of the aged who are well and active must work for the rest of the old, who are homebound in hospitals or nursing homes, or destitute finan­cially or psychologically, Putz stat­ed. 
Expansion of religious experi­enced geared to the older member­ship of the Church is another goal of Harvest House. "Communal anointing, the new sacrament of the sick, for older adults is now allowed, but both clergy and the elderly need to be educated on the beauty and usefulness of this up-dated sacrament," said Putz. "Creative retreats and spiritual study days, combined with travel and sociability, can also become memorable and meaningful reli­gious experiences. Small prayer groups can be fostered for Bible study, community awareness and

Forever I..eamlng Institute 

Fostered by the notion that the possibilities for continuing educa­tion afe limitless, as :well as productive, regardless of one's age, the Forever Learning Institute flourishes as the educational arm of Harvest House. Now in its third year, the institute has a total enrollment of about 750. 
'Students take courses in a curri­culum that ranges from foreign languages and the humanities to typing and piano. Many, but not all of the teachers are retired Notre Dame professors, illustrating the symbiosis which the program's founder thinks will keep Harvest House from becoming something young people do for older people. All of the teachers are volunteers. 
Forever Learning has leased two floors of the mother-house of the Sisters of St. Joseph, located at 107 
S. Greenlawn Ave. In this relaxed atmosphere, classes are held three days a week. Students work at their own pace, motivated by their own desire to learn, and no exams are given. "They love to learn," noted Putz, "and there are never any discipline problems." 
Course offerings include: four foreign languages, philosophy, theology, cooking, retirement plan­ning, tailoring, chorus, bridge. ballroom dancing, history, yoga, piano, photography, ceramics, knitting, crocheting, music appre­ciattion, painting. poetry, typing, business, psychology, Shakespeare and creative writing.

Movies 

Dear Editor, 
I would like to clarify a few things which were stated in an article in the April 28 issue of The Observer. I did not realize' when I i met with two members of the . Cinema Series concerning cultural films, that my remarks could be so I misunderstood. I don't think that the statement "I don't like foreign 1 films" is quite the same as "I won't show foreign films." This is especially important since I ex­plained to them that my own personal opinions on movies would ; not determine what films would be shown next year. . 
My position as Movie Commis­sioner, which was presented to the Series people but which was not presented in the article, is that the 1 · commission should provide films ' that people on this campus want to ' attend. I realize that there are . many different opinions on movies, I and the plan of the commission is to : show a wide variety of films. The 
1 commission was not set up to do 1 away with one type of film in favor 'I of another; however, movies that . 
do not receive sufficient student interest, i.e., attendance, should not be shown. 
We have a limited number of dates per semester and try to benefit the most people in the times available. Since there are approximately 40 or more clubs applying for movie dates, I feel that if some films are attended by only a few people, these movie dates could be better used by opening more dates for clubs and showing films that are more widely received by the students. We are supposed. to provide a service to the students · and are trying to do so for as many : people as we can. Cultural films were never being threatened, only . any type of film that was not being attended by the students. The movie commission was set up only to alleviate some of the internal conflicts within Student Union. The purpose is to tie everything toge­ther to come up with a program that will be most beneficial to the 
entire campus. 
Another misstatement in The Observer article concerns my not · trusting ·the clubs. The reason i behind having Student Union col­lectors at the club films is because I there were problems a few years ; ago. Clubs used tocollect money at · their own ftlms; however, when attendance figures were given to 1 the film companies, some figures:

"That's very funny," Joan said. "But al the way down in the car Mickey was counting on sleeping in my room. He wouldn't have come if he _had known he had to sleep in the attic." 
Mr. Ripley said, "He'll sleep in your room over my dead body." 
I decided to intercede. "I have a suggestion. Since Mickey was counting on sleeping in Joan's room, why don't you let him sleep there and have Joan sleep in the attic?" 
All three looked at me. 
Then Mr. Ripley said, "Wait a minute. Suppose Joan decides to come down from the attic in the middle of the night?" 
"It's simple," I said. "Make Mickey promise to lock his door." 
were not accurate. Companies were threatening to not accept movie orders from Notre Dame. It was at this time that everything started being handled through Student 
Union. AlthQugh I never said I do not trust clubs, it really is unimpor­tant. The reason money is collected by Student Union is because the movie companies want some con­trol over the revenue, not because of my alleged lack of trust in clubs. It is a procedure that was set up three years ago when I was not even involved in Student Union. My trust, or supposed lack of trust, was never even considered when the procedure was adopted.

I am disturbed by the fact that none of the thr~e open letters from 
University adminstrators which appeared in Tuesday's Observer 
addressed the issue of, the source of, and the factors which perpetuate 
institutional racism at Notre Dame. What is most disturbing is that 
these issues were the ones which the concerned Black students asked 
the administrators to address in their letters. 
The seeds· of institutional racism lie in the pervasive ethnocentrism 
that engulfs the Notre Dame community and the continual fostering of 
this ethnocentrism by decision-makers. One factor which nurtures this 
ethnocentrism is the lack of sufficient opportunities for the members of 
the majority to come to know and understand (a) individual members of 
other racial-cultural groups as human beings whose cultures possess 
equal moral status to those of European origin and (b) the collactive 
aspirations of other racial groups if such aspirations exist and differ 
from the majority norm. In other words, the depressingly small number 
of "minority" students, faculty, and staff not only leads to their 
victimization, it also constrains the "humanization" of the majority. 
An appreciation of the functionality of human diversity is not 
reflected by cheering for large numbers of non-whites representing the 
University in athletic contests, nor by making charitable contributions 
to nameless victims of global politics who reside in what has come to be 
known as ''The Third World." Until the issue of the paucity of 
"minorities" on this campus is addressed head on, there can be no 
operational mechanism to guard against the perpetuation of 
institutional racism at Notre Dame. 

Institutional racism is often treated metaphorically by members of 
the majority, but it is not an abstract entity for its victims. As an 
example, following is the text of a communication that I received in the 
mail after the black student protest: 

"Can't you get those Louse-Bound Niggers to quit feeling sorry for themselves? The ignoramuses should realize that they are not going to get any sympathy from anyone who has some intelligence! 
No-Sympathy-Majority'' 
Attitudes such as these do not exist in a vacuum; they require at the 
very minimum a benign environment to survive. The correspondent 
didn't sign his or her name, but if I had the opportunity to dialogue 
with this individual, I would point out that his or her sympathy is not 
what is being sought; it is the provision of equal opportunities and 
services. Moreover, I would point out that it is individuals like those 
whose "humanization" process has been short-circuited that are to be 
pitied. 

In this regard, I also pity the overwhelming mass of students and 
faculty members at Notre Dame who eschew the opportunities to 
accelerate their humanization through the courses and extra-curricular 
activities which project cultural experiences of various non-white 
racial-cultural groups. For those who are seriously interested in 
ascertaining what Black students feel about this stiuation at Notre 
Dame and the factors underlying the recent demonstraton, I invite you 
to read the Black Student Affairs Committee's report on the result of a 
questionnaire administered last year. 
I also pity the Notre Dame community because the information that 
is provided to you by the Administration implicitly perpetuates the 
myth that increasing the number of "minorities" at Notre Dame 
implies lowering standards and admitting "unqualified" individuals, 
while it is admitted privately that it is the University's financial 
priorities that limit the number of minority students matriculating 
here. 

The seeds of ethnocentrism and consequently of institutional racism 
of Notre Dame do not "creep in" when our vigilance is less than 
adequate; they are integrally bound up in (1) existing course selection 
procedures including academic counselling services, (2) the existing 
recruitment process and admissions mechanisms, and (3) the 
structured and voluntary patterns of associations implicitly and 
explicitly encouraged by the University. We will have made a 
worthwhile beginning toward addressing the problem when large 
numbers of individuals, influential and otherwise, take periodic 
voluntary non-absent actions to eliminate it without being prodded by 
political actions.

THE CELEBRATION OF A SPIRIT 
by Dauid O'Keefe 
A bird may love a fish, but where would they make a home together? 
--Tevye 
Wednesday, when I went to rehearsal to get a better idea of what to look for when Fiddler On The Roof opened on Friday night, I was struck by what seemed to me to be an awfully misconceived Brechtian nightmare. It couldn't work, I thought. Dr. Bain is taking the environmental formula way beyond its intended limits. I struggled through the full-cast run-through with my knees perched indolently on the back of the seat ahead of me, staring between my knees at what I was certain 
was  a  well-intentioned  disaster  in  the  
making.  
All  of  this  doomsaying  owed  to  my  

conventional belief that the environmental theater approach best lent itself to small, intimate, soul-baring drudgeries that rely ever so heavily on their ability to impress the audience with the alarming immediacy of the loneliness or decrepitude or vanity or whatever it was parading among and around them. It sometimes worked, I was willing to admit, in comedies or musicals, as long as they didn't risk alientation by over-exertion. But to impose that gel­atinous approach on Fiddler, a show that relies on the rigorous structure of complete illusion for so much of its success, was an unthinkable miscalculation. That is what I thought. 
Although I was miles from the mark, there was unhappily, an element of truth buried beneath my otherwise exaggerated fears. There are problems with Fiddler, for the most part transitional problems that stem from the environmental aspects of the production. The lack of a curtain or blackouts· to punctuate the scenes insti­gates a blend of feelings, an unwholesome mixture in light of the fact that Fiddler relies on the establishment of competing emotions realized in some semblance of scenic integrity. It was precisely this failure in staging that muted the impact of such potentially strong numbers as "Sab­bath Prayer" and "Far From the Home I Love." Although both were wondedully sung, they were staged in such a way that the audience seemed to be left with a listless uncertainty about what they were supposed to feel. 
Another problem arose from David Weber's design of the "pedorming en­vironment.'' Chief offender among the few props was the monstrous, multi-purpose "wagon" that served, at one point or other, as a means of transportation, a resting place, a quiet spot to catch a nap, and a perch for the Fiddler. It is difficult to imagine what was being communicated by having Tevye drag this burden about, looking for all the world like Jacob Marley's ghost trailing a ball and chain. Daniel Daily did all he could to look at least unburdened, but even he couldn't prevent the clumsiness of the thing from turning an otherwise poignant ending into a kind of funeral procession. The "Corner" prop, an anonymous building comer that served alternately as the Inn, the Dairy, and the Tailor's, was cleverly conceived but badly abused, with some pedormers respecting the implied walls and others walking right through them. As far as the scenography in Fiddler is concerned, the scenes that worked best were those that most faithfully adhered to the creation of illusion in its strictest theatrical sense. 
But the problems in Fiddler were neither depressing nor devastating, a fact that owes as much to the natural charms of the show as it is written as it does to the irresistable charms of the show as it was pedormed last weekend. 
Daniel Daily {Tevye) is by now familiar to anyone who has seen a major production in the past few years. He has often impressed me as more of a technician than an actor, turning in pedormances that were as impeccable as they were emotion­ally sterile. But that was before I had seen Daily's Tevye, irrefutable evidence of an authentic versatitlity and artistic imagina­

tion that I hadn't noticed in past pedor­mances. As his career with the ND/SMC Theatre comes to a close, it only seems fair to call him what he is. He is, in every good sense of the word, a pro. It was a joy to see and hear his art. 
The rest of the cast is composed of solid talents as well as some uncertain abilities. Among the former, Lisa Colaluca and Shevawn O'Connor prove once more in Fiddler that they are as reliable as they are adaptable. Colaluca (Golde) demonstrates a superb sense of balance in her character. Together, she and Daily combine to make "Do You Love Me?" the most happily accomplished song in the show. O'Connor has always displayed a natural ability for comedy, and here she gives Yente, the matchmaker, a dimension that raises her from the depths of caricature to a somewhat more sophisticated level. 
Of the three daughters, Mary Oliphant (Chava) most successfully combines acting and singing. Joan Martel's voice carries her pedormance as Hodel admirably, while Maura Murrihy seems content to play Tzeitel quietly. As for the daughter's lovers, Michael King (Perchik) hurts an otherwise good job with a somewhat stale "Now I Have Everything." John Walker exhibited customary control and precision as Fyedka, but gives an even better indication of his considerable talents with a delightful little piece as the priest. Sean 
1 his immeasurable, precious gift for making his character not so much important or effective as he makes his character endearing. As Lazar Wolf, the butcher, Gary Aumiller is quite entertaining, al­though his notion of stage presence sometimes causes him to bellow and stomp about like an hysterical pirate. 
One of the delights of the show was the ability of some of the pedormers to make forgettable, functional roles things to remember. Matt McKenzie plays the heartless Czarist Constable with an inten­sity and dignity that convinces the aud­ience that he is, indeed, an outsider in Anatevka. It is a difficult role skillfully rendered. Also, watch what Mark Amenta does with Nachum, the beggar; Louis Spisto with the Rabbi; Steve Rodgers with Mendel, the Rabbi's son; and Ed Schwallie with Mordcha, the innkeeper, to under­stand that, on the stage,the part is as big as you make it. 
Although the music occasionally lags, (a phenomenon that seems to stem from a misunderstanding between the voices and orchestra as to who is accompanying whom), it is generally thoughtful and well-done. There is also a wonderfully idyllic ballet that serves very nicely to reinforce the "delicate intimacy of Tevy's "Chaveleh." 
The ND/SMC Theatre production of Fiddler on the Roof goes far in pointing out the underlying philosophy of the program: that a production is meant, not as an intellectual exercise, but as an experience that is, in the end, fun. While there may be aesthetic ideals that I disagree with from the erudite cliffs of the critic, there can be no denial that the audience was in the spirit of the show. From the informal welcoming ceremony, with cast members running through the aisles, shaking hands 
, and saying, "Shalom aleichem, shalom aleichem," ("Peace to you, peace to you,") until Tevye's final farewell, "Shalom aleichem," Fiddler works with and for the audience so honestly and enthusiastically that the audience has no choice but to work with them. It works so nicely that one believes that there may yet 
, be a home somewhere for the bird and the fish together.

Bakke v. Board of Education 
Case raises reverse discrimination issue 
by Bob Mader Staff Reporter 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first of a two-part series exploring the effects on the Bakke v. The Board of Education decision in California and the controversy concerning reverse discrimination. 
A small envelope delivered to the University of California at Davis on November 26, 1972, set into motion the most important legal battle in the field of race relations and minority groups since Brown v. The Board of Education. The envelope which arrived at the then six-year­old institution was an application for admission from a man named Allan Paul Bakke. 

Allan Bakke was an engineer at Ames Research Center in Palo Altn. a National Aeronautics and Space Administration laboratory that tested the effects of radiation on small animals and the effects of radiation on small animals and the effects of outer space on the human body. While working there, Bakke came into contact with physicians who blended their skills with engineering, and he realized he wanted to become a doctor. Bakke took courses in chemistry and biology part-time in order to have the prerequisite pre-med courses. Bakke had one big strike against him--his age. He was 31 in 1971, and although he was advised against applying by admissions officers at several schools, he refused to be discouraged. 
Bakke took the medical college admission tests and scored admir­ably--he ranked in the 97 percentile of all applicants nationally. In addition he had exceptional grades in college, laudatory letters of recommendation, and a well­written essay, spelling out his reasons for wanting to enter medi­cal school. But they weren't good enough. Bakke was turned down by Davis for admission three times: in April1973, again in August and in the following spring. 
Bakke claims he was not admit­ted because· he was white. Davis each year admits 100 first year students into their medical schools, and 16 of those places are specifi­cally set aside for minority stu­dents. The minority students get special consideration: the appli­cants are screened by a different committee, 2.5 grade point aver­ages in college do not automatically disqualify applicants, and MCAT 

Petition supports rights of Soviet dissenters 
by Joe Slovenic Staff Reporter 

Friends of Freedom, a bi-parti­san group which is a branch of the American Council for World Free­dom is circulating petitions to support the Soviet dissident's stand in favor of human rights. They are asking the 35 nations participating in the Belgrade Hu­man Rights Conference next month to insure faithful compliance of the signatories to the human rights · provisions of the 1975 Helsinki Agreement. 
Andy Baan, chairman of the petition drive at Notre Dame, announced that Friends of Free­dom petitions will be circulated during dinner on Tuesday. May 3 and Thursday, May 5. Copies of the petitions will be presented to President Carter, Congress, the 
U.S. delegation to the Belgrade Conference and the U.S. embassies of the countries attending the Belgrade Conference. 
The Belgrade Conference in June will determine how faithfully the signatories of the human rights provisions of the Helsinki Agree­ment have lived up to their word. The Helsinki Agreement was. ne­gotiated in 1975 by the United States. Soviet Union and other European nations to increase co­operation between the Communist and non-Communist blocs. I included provisions for·warnings of troop movements and support of basic human rights. 
The Helsinki Agreement was widely interpreted in diplomatic circles as a tacit agreement that the United States would recognize Soviet domination in Eastern Europe if the Soviets would respect basic human rights in those coun­tries. Much controversy has been generated by the Soviet failure to live up to the Helsinki agreement and their continued harassment of such dissidents as Alexander Solzhenitysn, Andrei Sakharov and Alexander Ginzburg. Since Presi­dent Carter took office, he has been active in criticizing Soviet viola­tions of the human rights provi­sions. 
Baan explained the Friends of Freedom's reasons for circulating the petition. "I think everyone in the world should be guaranteed freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press and freedom of assembly as we in America enjoy,'' he said. ''These rights are inalienable, as put by Thomas Jefferson, and everyone in the world should enjoy them. There are countries such as the Soviet Union where people do not enjoy these rights and that is why treaties such as the Helsinki Pact are necessary.'' 
"We back the movement of the 
Soviet dissidents because the So­
viets signed the agreement and did 
not live up to it," Baam added. 
"Anyone who signs these petitions is saying that he believes dissi­dents in the Soviet Union are right and hopefully , these names will put pressure on the Soviet govern­ment through the Soviet embassy to sign and live up to the agree­ment to be voted on in Belgrade." Recent statements from the Soviet government indicated their continued unwillingness to respect the provisions of the Helsinki Treaty in spite of American pres­sure. However. Baan believed the petitions will also support Presi­dent Carter and other human rights advocates who may feel they are 
st11nding alone. He also believes these signatures may help sway countries that are undecided about voting for the Belgrade Human Rights agreement in favor of a strong stand in support of human rights. 
The Friends of Freedom hope to obtain 100,000 signatures in this nationwide petition drive.

scores substantially lower than the average are acceptable. 
As a result Bakke sued the University of California for denying him equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. He trounced the University in the federal courts. The California Su­preme Court, in a 6-1 decision, ruled the Davis' admission policy is unconstitutional and the Bakke is entitled to admission. Davis has appealed the case to the United States Supreme Court which has agreed to hear the case probably in October. 
Minority groups such as The National Urban League, the National Conference of Black Law· yers, The Midwest Council of LaRaza, and the National Lawyers Guild, are furious. Charles Tur­chick of the National Lawyers Guild said the Guild charges Davis with colluding with Bakke, citing the paucity of the evidence presented by Davis. Director of the Notre Dame Center for Civil Rights Donald P. Kommers termed this charge conjecture, pointing out that Davis, along with the Associa· tion of American Law Schools would probably not take a case to the Supreme Court with the inten­tion of losing. 
James Stewart, director of the Black Studies Program at Notre Dame, noted that currently there are only 15,000 minorities in pro· fessional schools, and that not that many whites would be admitted even if affirmative action programs were struck down by the high court. Forty thousand Americans applied for the 14,000 places in medical school last year alone. "For me the issue is moot,"" Stewart said. "Bakke is a subter­fuge for institutional racism." 
The minorities' arguments are undermined by the fact that Davis did not cite past discrimination as the reason for instJtu= their

special admissions program. The Supreme Court has demanded proof of past discrimination in previous cases before ruling on the constitutionality of affirmative ac­tion programs. The Court does this, according to Kommers, so that a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act can be shown, and a court can order a remedy. It would be unjust for a court to order a remedy in the absense of a clear violation of law. "The remedy cannot transcend the problem," Kommers said. 
But Bakke's case, and the cases of others claiming reverse discrim­ination by medical schools has also been undermined. The National Observer recently reported that rich whites are buying their way into medical schools for prices ranging from $5000 to $25,000The National Observer also reported 
--The speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives has been indicted for allegedly extorting $56,000 from parents for his help in getting t their :hildren admitted to medical and veterinary schools. 
--Two other Pennsylvania state legislators face !trial 'or bribery and  conspiracy in similar alleged schemes involving a dental school. --Chicago Medical School in 1973 collected an average of $50,000 a piece from 77 out of 91 freshmen. School officials admitted under oath that the money influenced admission decisions. --UC Davis, also, admitted that the children of wealthy businessmen and politicians have been given special treatment in admission decisions. 
The conclusion of this series in tomorrow's Gbserver will examine the Bakke case's impact on Notre Dame, and admissions and affirma­tive action at the University. 
Maryann O'Neil receives St. Catherine Medal 
by Jean Powley St. Mary's Editor 

Maryann "Roonie" O'Neil. a St. 
Mary's junior. has been named as recipient of the St. Catherine Medal for outstanding academic and service achievements, an­nounced Gail Mandell, St. Mary's vice president of academic affairs.

She is also a resident advisor in Holy Cross Hall and a member of the varsity basketball team. 
The medal. which is sponsored by Kappa Gamma Pi. the National Catholic Honor Society, had for many years been awarded annuallv to an outstanding sophomore or junior until students' lack of inter­est caused its discontinuance in 1970. However. a significant change in students' attitudes prompted the Committee on Ac­ademic Standards to request the medal's re-establishment this year. 
Dr. John Duggan. president of St. Mary's, will present her with the award Thursdav. May 5 at 5: IS 
p.m. in room 161 LeMans Hall. The presentation will be open to the public.

Blue team wins spring finale, 49-10

by Paul Stevenson Sports Editor 
The Fighting Irish football team concluded their 
spring season this past Saturday with the forty-sev­
enth annual Blue-Gold Game, a contest which found 
the Blue defeating the Gold by a score of 49-10. 
The battle started slowly, with the Blue squad failing to move the ball as expected. In their first series of plays, the Blue team lost fifteen yards. On their next possession, quarterback Rusty Lisch fumbled on first down, giving the Gold squad the ball on the Blue 18 yardline. 
However, the Gold could not advance the ball, and 
a Joe Unis 34 yard field goal attempt was wide to the 
left. 

Two plays into their next opportunity, Lisch was intercepted by Mike Whittington on the 32 yardline. Once again, the Gold team could not move the ball against the tenacious Irish Blue team defense. The three-point attempt failed giving the Blue team the ball again. 
Seven seconds later, Vagus Ferguson lost the handle on the football, and the Gold team has possession once more. The Gold members could not advance the ball, however, this time Unis connected on a 25 yard attempt. 
From that point on, the rest of the contest belonged to the men in blue. The Blue team drove 80 yards, 47 on the ground and 33 via the aerial attack as Lisch hit three of four, to score the first touchdown of the afternoon. Ferguson found paydirt from four yards out to cap the drive. Dave Reeve added the point after, giving the first quarter score of 7-3. 
The Gold team then drove 19 yards from their own 20 to the 39 yardline when Luther Bradley came up with his first of three interceptions of the afternoon, giving the Blue the ball at the Gold 40 yardline. 
The Blue team found the goal line again, highlighted by an 18 yard strike from Lisch to tight end Ken MacAfee, on a one-yard run by Lisch. Reeve hit the conversion to build the Blue team lead to 14-3. 
The Blue squad reclaimed the pigskin after the Gold team failed to move the ball, and advanced the ball SO yards for the score. Ferguson tallied the six points on a one yard plunge while earning his second touchdown of the day. 
With just 2:32 remaining in the half, Ferguson found the endzone once again to conclude a seven play 37 yard drive. Once again, the freshman gridder reached paydirt from one yard out. 
Bradley regained the ball for the Blue squad ten seconds later on his second interception in the contest. Lisch hit Steve Orsini with a 12 yard flare pass to give the Blue their final score before halftime. 
Ferguson began the scoring in the second half for .the Blue team with a 13 yard sprint. Reeve connected on the extra point to give the Blue a crushing 35-3 lead. 
With only 35 seconds left in the game, Joe Montana led the Blue team to their final score of the afternoon. Highlighted by a 14 yard aerial strike to Dennis 1 Grindinger, the Blue score came on a five yard scamper by Steve Schmitz.

Women's track places third 
by Laurie Reising Women's Sports Editor 

The Notre Dame women's track team finished up their re~ular season Saturday afternoon on a hopeful note by placing third in the · Cougar Relays competition held at St. Francis College. The meet was won by the host school with Hunnington College coming in second while Indiana University finished fourth and Albion College fifth. 
In the 440 relays the team of Susanrla Behnke, Gina Robillard, Kathy McKann and Michelle O'Haren grabbed first place with their time of 53:2. This same squad barely ,missed finishing first again in the 880 relays. Their time of

The Irish women looked strong again in the 2 mile medley action with the team of Berry, Curtain, Hester and Malvezzi finishing third. Their time was set at 11 :58.5 The group took second place in the 880's with a time of 2:02. 
It was the winning combination of Behnke, Robillard, McKann and O'Haren competing again in the jumper's relay eventand they were equally successful. capturing first place honors with their time of 55:0.

9:19, a personal best. Another 
; stand-out performance was turned in by Arnie Gough who finished in third place while running the high hurdles in 14.6. Concluding the running events was the two mile relay team consisting of Dave Benkert, John Quinn, Ed Kristner and Dave Gutschenritter who made a good showing in this strenuous event. In the field event section of the meet the Irish faired well with Terry Stowe making a respectable showing in the pole vault clearing 14 feet six inches. George Lang had a personal best in the hammer throw tossing it 132 feet. Rounding out the field events and the meet was Mike Meyer's discus throw of 145 feet. The Irish faced much stiffer competition at the Drake Relays, in fact, most experts claim it to be the most prestigious relay meet of the entire season. Peter Burger, Ste.ve Welch, Kevin Kenny and Joe Strohman, representing the Irish in the four mile relay, placed twelfth out of a field of 29 teams, finishing with a fine time of 16:58. 
In the distance medley the team The Notre Dame track team will prepare for their only home meet of consisting of the same members, the spring season this Saturday against Toledo. 
The Gold team high point was directed by quarterback Kevin Muno, who found receiver Tyree Dickerson for a 40 yard strike, giving the Gold excellent field possession with only seconds remain­ing in the contest. Two plays later, Muno found Dickerson in the endzone from six yards out to give the Gold team their only touchdown in the annual competition. 
The Blue team compiled 231 yards on the ground, while ammassing 145 through the air. In contrast, the Gold squad lost 18 yards rushing, while gaining 72 yards passing. 
Ferguson Jed all rushers with 85 yards on 17 attempts. This performance earned him Offensive Player of the Game distinction. David Waymer and Willard Browner added 41 and 38 yards respectively. 
Lisch connected on 11 of 17 pass attempts, while Montana hit four of seven. MacAfee hauled in five passes for a total of 84 yards. 
Defensively, Ross Browner compiled three solo tackles and eight assists, including four sacks for a total loss of 24 yards. Bob Golic notched two individual tackles while also adding eight assists. 
Luther Bradley intercepted three passed during his afternoon performance. Because of this feat, Bradley was named Defensive Player of the Game by the press. 
The game was a typical end to the spring drills. This game is supposed to answer key questions as to who will be starting in various positions next fall. One of these spots has to be quarterback, a position which Lisch has claimed, but not without hesitation on Devine's part. 
"Yes Lisch has won the number-one quarterback spot," Devine responded to a question." "He's a dedicated athlete and a good student of the game." 
"However, Joe (Montana) has had a real good last couple of weeks in practice. He just happened to be off today. When a guy is out for a year, it's hard to come back so quickly." 
"I don't think you saw how well Joe has done this spring today," Devine added. 
Another concern is also centered around the starting backfield, who worked without AI Hunter and Jerome Heavens. Right now, this duo is counted on for their contributions in the fall. By that time, they should be healthy and ready for play. 
Ifthis tandum returns to the lineup at full strength, what happens to the backfield that played Saturday is another question. One solution under consideration is to use Heavens and Ferguson at both fullback and halfback positions. 
Waymer, who performed well on offense in Saturday's game, will remain on offense for the fall. Devine originally wanted to play Waymer on offense and defense for two weeks each. However, injuries in the backfield prevented Waymer's transition to defense . 
Receiver Kris Haines and tri-captain Terry Eurick were absent from Saturday's competition. Haines was suffering from a pulled hamstring, while Eurick did not participate because of a sore shoulder. 
The Notre Dame football team will report for fall practice on August 16. Picture Day will be August 17 with practice starting on August 18. 
formances by the team at both relays, although I also realize that some of the athletes could have done better,'' stated Head Track Coach Joe Piane. The Notre Dame track team will hold its only track meet of the season at home this when they host the 
mvPn:nv of Toledo.
