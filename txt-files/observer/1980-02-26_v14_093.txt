Record cro-wd enjoys Weekend 
_ 
by Chip Block 
Junior Parents Weekend was held this pas;: weekend and, according to Chairman Jim Riedman, the event went over "much better than expected." A record crowd of over 2,450 people attended the President's Dinner on Saturday. Though the event is not designed to make money, it did generate some revenue, he said. 
According to Steve Burgoon, financial chairman, the week­end brought in approximately $1,500. "Most of the money was made on the cocktail party," Burgoon estimated. The weekend was run on a very strict budget, and because of the unexpectedly large crowd, some money was made, he said.

COLLEGE STUDENTS 
You may be eligible for a two-year Air Force ROTC scholarship. The scholarship includes full tuition, lab expenses, incidental fees, a reimbursement for text· books, and $100 a month tax free. How do you qual· ify? You must have at least two years of graduate or undergraduate work remaining, and be willing to serve your nation at least four years as an Air Force officer. Scholarships are available to students who can qualify for pilot, navigator, or missile training, and to those who are majoring in selected technical and nontechni· cal academic disciplines, in certain scientific areas, in undergraduate nursing, or selected premedical degree areas. Non-scholarship students enrolled in the Air Force ROTC two-year program also receive the $100 monthly tax-free allowance just like the scholarship students. Find out today about a two-year Air Force ROTC scholarship and about the Air Force way of life. Your Air Force ROTC counselor has the details.

the blaze, but few parents were 
affected. Similarly, most ) uniors and their parents were at thePresident's Dinner when Goose's was raided. 
The weekend began with the cocktail party on Friday night. Saturday started with work­shops with the professors of the different colleges and was con­
cluded with the President's Dinner and a concelebrated mass. Rounding out the week­end was the closing breakfast on Sunday morning. 
Riedman said that a report would be written so that next year's junior class could learn from this year's program's successes and problems. He advises next year's junior class to "be prepared to do a lot of work, but it is worth the trouble.''

there disputed the report and 
said the strikes were 
continuing. 

An Associated Press reporter 
and another Western corre­

effectiveness of the general

Only a few stores were open,

Soviet soldiers in heavy T-55

On women and Law School j 


Lawyers advise students 


by Sal Granata Senior StaffReporter 
Emphp.siz,ng the moral quality of a Notre Dame Law School education and the practical aspects of life for women intent on practicing law, six members of the Notre Dame Law­community addressed a pre­dominately f:maleaudience last night in Hayes-Healy Auditor­
IUm. 
!'he seminar "Women in Law" was sponsored by the Notre Dame Pre-l.aw Society and attracted approximately a hundred interested students, according to society president Diane Rice. 
The speakers last night in­cluded Professor Patricia O'Hara, VIsiting professor of Law, local attorneys Joanne Schwanz and Carmen Piasecki, and three women frim the Notre Dame Law Caucus. 
All the speakers commented favorably on the quality of education at the Notre Dame Law School. O'Hara told her audience that "you will not find the same atmosphere here at other law schools.'' 
Adrienne Coffin, a second year law student, said that

there are "many really dedicat­ed professors here, and an awareness of moral issues in the law." She described the Christian Lawyers Forum as an example of moral awareness. This group meets regularly to discuss ethical questions bruught up by legal practice. 
Attorneys Schwartz and Piasecki concentratedtheir talks on relating their experiences as professional women success­fully maintaining normal family lives. Schwanz affirmed that it is possible to step out ofpractice tiH· a few years to start a family and then return to the law. But she cautioned her audience that it is prudenr to become estab­lished first. 
I'he ll)74 valedictorian from Notre Dame Law School, 0 ·Hara practices corporate law in the San Francisco area. She is teaching at Notre Dame while on a two year sabbatical. 
0' Ilara ourlined the history of w(imen in American law practice. She stated that today there are triple the number of wumen in Law School than ;here were in 1970. She said that · · -;heer numbers are breaking down the obstacles to women in the law Judge and clients stop

Upon graduation, Meyer performed much tht" same duties that his son Joe (DePaul '71) does now for him. Living in Chicago, the graduate­turned-sotial-worker scouted upcoming oppon­ents for Keogan until the latter arranged an interview for Meyer at Catholic High School in Joliet, Ill. Having turned down the high school job because he needed $1,800 instead of the offered $1,700, Meyer returned home Sunday 
1 night in time for an unexpected call from Notre Dame. They offered me a job as Keogan's assistant--! was there Monday morning." 
Even though he served as an interim coach while Keogan recuperated from a heart attack, Meyer refuses to take any of the credit. 
"I have no victories anywhere except for DePaul," explains Meyer. "I never took credit , for a victory there or for a loss." 
Yet one would have to twist Meyer's arm before he would admit that the Irish were 33-11 for the two seasons which he coached portions of. 
"No, Notre Dame has been very good to me over the years," said the 1979 Coach of the Year as he paused to reflect pensively on his long career. I made a lot of great friends: 'Moose' Krause, Fr. Cavanaugh--! even had Fr. Hesburgh in one ofmy classes, although I didn't realize It till later. 
''And Notre Dame is still very good to me. I think if it hadn't been for D1gger Phelps, I wouldn't have been named 'Coach of the Year'--1 think he told off all the coaches that didn't vote for me." 
Meyer also remembers Fr. Joyce fondly. 
...Meyer 

"Several years ago we could not give out scholarships because ofa certain ruling. I was at a Notre Dame affair and I seemed pretty depressed and as I drove Fr. Joyce back to the train, he asked why I was down." 
"I told him that we couldn't give scholar­ships," Meyer recalled with a shrug. "And he told me that he would send me some information about what the Big Ten schools were doing about the ruling. I took the information to our president and it convinced him--he said that I could give scholarships if I wanted--that it didn't matter." 
Meyer seems proud of his connection with Notre Dame; even though his Demons and the Irish clash annually. The plaque presented to him by the Monogram Club as their 1979 "Man of the Year'' hands prominently on his office wall, although a caricature of the Coach following a victory over Notre Dame hangs about it as a constant reminder of his deep DePaul roots. 
"One thing Notre Dame taught me to do was 
pray," offered the grandfather of 15, who is 
seldom found without his rosary. "The guys on 
the team call me 'Lucky Beads· because I always 
have them with me. I also went to Mass at Notre 
Dame every day, and that has carried over until 
today--we never play a ballgame with Mass in 
the morning or afternoon.'' 
"Notre Dame taught me a great deal," 
acknowledged Meyer with a thoughtful nod. 
"I'II always be indebted to them for that." 
It's funny, but no matter where you go, you'll 
always find alumni. But then again, what better 
place than in Alumni Hall?

Oassof '38 
Meyer recalls days at ND 
CHICAGO--As DePaul basketball coach Ray 
Meyer trudged into his office after practice, he 
was obviously spent. After a lengthy luncheon 
engagement, a hard rwo-hour practice and an 
houri of interviews after the workout, it seemed 
as if Meyer had answered all the questions, most 
of them a hundred times. 
With a labored yet warm smile, DePaul'.., 
coach of 38 years settled into a padded chair 
behind his desk for yet another intervie\\. 
"Coach, let's forger about basketball for 
awhile," I suggested. "Tell us what it was like 
at Notre Dame." 
Meyer, a 1938 Notre Dame graduate, leaned 
back 10 his chair as a glimmer rwinkled in his 
eyes and a faint smile began to inch across his 
ruddy complexion. 
It was a question he hadn't been asked, but 
was glad to answer. 
"Oh, we didn't have any of the freedom you 
fellas have now," explained the coach quietly. 
"You guys complain--we only had one night a 
month when we could !'tay out till midnight. 
"Lights had to be out by 10 p.m --we had to study by candlelight in the johns so the priests wouldn't find us." 
A residnet of Brown~on, St. Edward, Howard and Walsh Halls, the 66-year-old mentor also lived under the dome for a while under the watchful eye of Brother Austin. 
''I can still remember coming in real late one night after a basketball tournament my fresh­man year," recalled Meyer as he shook his head and smiled. "I was the only one who had permission, but there were rwo other guys with me. I walked to the desk to sign in--we had to. 
"I walked up the steps, and Brother turns to me and says 'All right, Ray, I signed the other rwo in too.''' 
Despite the discipline, boys still were boys. Austin had the habit of coming around and closing the curtains every night, a ritual which one of Meyer's friends, Ralph Jackowski, could not help but take advantage o( 
"Jackowski tied a black thread to my curtains and kept pulling them open whenever Brothe closed them. 
"I think we spent three nights sleeping on benches in the locker room for that,'' he added matter-of-factly. "Jackowski was crazy." 
As for the food, Meyer modestly contended that he was happy with it. "I came from a very poor home," admitted the Hall of Farner sheepishly. "Everyone else 
complained about the food--I enjoyed it." As for his classes. rwo teachers stick out in Meyer's mind. 
"I had a guy named Francis O'Malley for freshman English. He had graduated with the highest grades ever attained at the liberal arts 
school. 
Bill 
Marquard 
"I'll never forget, I was sitting in the back on my first day of class and this guy was using words 16 letters long," described Coach. 
"He k~pt going and going, and I started to !~ugh a ltttle. He wore glasses and was a little bi_t of a guy," chuckled Meyer as he indicated with hi_s left hand a diminutive figure probably knee-high to DePaul's current front line. 
"This _little guy came right down the aisle, stopped tn front of me and said 'Even the timid can commit murder'--1' II never forget that." 
"~ou don't. have anything like 'pencils up; penCils down, do you?" asked Meyer. 
"Raymond Murray used to teach sociology. When you walked into the room you had a paper at your desk with your name on it. He would say 'T~e questi.on f?r today_ is... ,' but you couldn't wnte an~thmg ull he said 'pencils up," recalled Meyer with a stress on the last rwo words. 
"We'd write for awhile, and as soon as Murray said 'pencils down' that was where they had to be--one more letter and he'd walk back and tear UJ? your paper,'' described Meyer with the enthusiasm ofan alumnus reminiscing at his class reunion. 
"Of course, you don't have anything like that now " A.memberofth_eNa_tionalCatholichighschool basketball ~hampwns m 1932, Meyer enjoyed an

TUJo-tnilers qualify for NCAAs 
by john Smzlh Sports Wnler 
, For the second consecutive 
weekend, the Notre Dame track 
t~m qualified in an event 
for\ the NCAA Indoor Track 
Ch~mpionship. The rwo-mile 
rela~team consisting of Jay 
Mir: da, Tim Macauley, Pete 
Burg r. and Chuck Aragon 
turnec in a sensational 7:28.5 
finish t1at easily qualified them 
for nexr'month's finals. Aragon 
had assured himself of a trip 
to the NCAAs last week by 
running the half mile in 
1: 50. 78. 
The relay team, despite their fine time, finished in second place by .3 seconds to the team from Kansas.But the J ayhawk runners had to give everything they had to edge Irish anchor­man Aragon at the wire. Aragon ran his split in 1:49.3. 
"We had Kansas running out of their minds to beat us," said a pleased Irish head coach in the rwo-mile relay; all four of our runners ran well, but they are all capable of going faster." 
In addition to Aragon's time, Miranda, Macauley, and 
"From what I figure, 
Burger were  clocked  at 1:53.1,  
1:53.1,  and  1:53.0,  respect­ 
ively.  

we have the fifth best colle~iate timt' in the country behmd Vilhnova. Oklahoma, Nebras­ka and Kansas; I feel we can beat Kansas if we meet them again. Oklahoma anddefending rwo mile-relay champs Nebras­ka figure to provide us with the most competition in the finals," stated the Irish mentor. "We have progressed from a very good team to one that is in contention for a national title, in a very short time. We haven't done much speed-work, yet, and we're just start­ing to come into our own right now."

The-team of Rick Rogers, 
Jacques Eady, Aragon and 
Burger combined for a '9:53.0 
time, just three seconds off the 
required finish. 
Not to bt· outdone by the other relay teams, the one mile relay team turued in best time ofany Irish one-mile relay team over the last six years, with a 
3:18 plus finish. Despite finishing only second in their heat, the team of Steve Dziabis. Eady, Jim Christian, and Bill Ribera had to be pleased. ·Other fine Irish performances were turned in by Rogers in the half mile, and Perry Stow in the pole vault. Rogers won his heat in 1:54 but finished sev­enth overall. Stow cleared a height of 15 feet, but did not P.lace.

gavt" Blue Demon fans the right 
to shout "DePaul is Back" on 
their bumper stickers. Athletic 
Director Fr. Robert Gielow still 
di~play-s one of these remants of 
sales campaigns past on a lamp 
in his office. In 1979-80. 
however, the fenders on the 
cars parked in the streets in and 
around Lincoln Park say "WE 
AR.E DePAUL. " The buttons 
on the lapels of local mechants 
( ncluding the lady who makes 
the gyros in the Student Union and probably couldn't distin­guish a basketball from a ripe ultve) now shout ·'DePaul Blue D~?mons --#1." 
This marvelous love affair grows each day, from the red and blue Terrible Towels in the bookstore to the string of marquees on North Lincoln Avenue above the card shops and movie theatres proclaiming DePaul's exhaulted position atop the weekly polls. 
For the past weeks, assistant coach Joey Meyer has even managed to join the ranks of.the 
Chicago media by spilling. the 

dupe on DePaul in his daily 
dtary that appears in the 
DePa:tl ...oops, Chtcago 
Trilut.e. Meyer professes, 
"'You thin!: about me writing a 
diary which really, I guess, 
might be kmd of stupid, but 
that's just the way Chicago is. 
They're dying for a winner, and 
they've fallen in love with 
DePaul." The people want to 
hear all they can about their 
Blu<" Demons. 
l"lle u1mmirment to a first 

c:.1ss basketball program has 
only been moving in full force 
since the early seventies and 
awund DePaul they're just 
beginning to notice the 
bendits. 
"Things that Notre Dame has 
taken for granted for a number 
of years," say~ Joey Meyer, 
· · Dl"Paul is just starting to come 
in111 --selling of the shirts at the 
game~, the big business, 
making money and all that. It 
ltliJks likt" a smalltime school 
making gtJod, and that's just wha1 iris.·· 
TIH changes around DePaul, though, have not caused any maj11r personality flip-flops among students or staff. It's the neighborhood, the media, and the local civic leaders who are .s~Jaking up all the glory they ran from DePaul's success. 
h1r now, the Demons must share the limelight with their city, their f:ms, their writers, and their buo.,inessmen. They'll keep playing Frank Sinatra's version of · 'Chtcago" at half­time--the Windy City'~ answer w New York'~ urban renewal theme song. And Jane Byrne will surely be prompted to tl1row a ticker-tape parade if the Blue Demons bring Chicago a national championship. 
Ten years from today, though, ~omebody else may be weanng 1 he buttons and riding around with the bumper stickers when somebody else comes home with a big fat number one. At DePaul , it should srill be business as usual.
