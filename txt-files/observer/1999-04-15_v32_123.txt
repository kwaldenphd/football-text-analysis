¦ -TllDENT SENATE 
Leaders approve budget after arduous debate 

By FINN PRESSLY 
Assistant News Editor 
The 1998-99 Stud11nt Senate con­vened orrn linal timn to hammer out the Student Union budget for nnxt year, and after charged debate from numerous parties, ultimatnly approved the plan. 
In attempting to divide th1\ money allocat<id from the Studnnt Activilins Fee and revenue from "The Shirt" project, student leaders faced deci­sions about tlrnir funding priorities, and several protested their allot­ment. Two areas that some called umlorfundcd wnrc gender and mul­ticultural mlations programming. 
"Tho gencli-r rnlations d!'partnwnt and ttw multicultural relations dopartment Inf the Office of tho l'rnsidenl I worn only allocated $:iOO each." said Jay Smith, student gov­ernment cxecutivii coordinator or Public llclations. "We're asking tlw Senato to fail this hudg11t. We belfovc it sends the wrong messagP to minority lsludnntsl 011 campus." 
Student Union treasurer Jamns Jesse noted, hnw11vor, that the Finandal Management lfoard ,FMB) is held to the sole task of approving budgets, not solving campus issues. 
"Wo give money based on feasibil­ity of budget proposals," said Jesso. 
Former Dillon senator Jason Linster questioned the budget for Executive Cabinet, a group of Student Union programming lead­
nrs. 
"Could somenrH' please Pxplain why the executive r.abirrnt rwnds $9,()00'?" he asked. 
Jesse explained that tlw morrny had b1rnn allocated for a wnekly full-pagn ad in Tlw ObsPrvPr to advertise campus ewnts. 
"This is quite a rnalislic sum to get away with one ad pPr wonk," hn said, adding that incrnased adver­tising may translate into a higllf'r profit for the organizations sponsor­ing Urn Pvents.

Training 
A true martial artist can make any experi­ence into training. This is one truth that I have tried to make a reality in my own lifo. Reing r,onsistnntly busy with many things to do, I hardly havr!

quatcly practice. Yet, 
despite my dizzying 

schedule, I have found that even In thn most 
mundane of chores I can further perfect my 
kung fu. !low is this possible'? The following 
am but a few examples of how I make scf\m­
ingly boring and tPdious work into subtle 
practices in the training of kung fu. 
Everyone knows how important your horsr is in battle. You would never charge into a fight without your horse. To do so would be utter suicidP. lf you had no horse and your crwmy did, then he would just run right over you. f.,,:_1-1Pping this in mind, I practice my horse stance when wailing is inevitable. While wait­ing in the line at tlrn /\TM, the market. or office, I planl my fod. turn knees out, and np1•n my hips to str<·ngthen my horse stance. This teclmique works even when I'm doing the dishes or watching TV. Even reading a bo!lk stimulatPs my mind as well as my body. 
In addition to keeping my horse, dishwash­ing and sorting is beneticial to eye-hand coor­dination as well as manual dexterity. My experie1m~s in South Dining I !all have provid­Pd several wnditions to exercise speed and agility. To be able to grab multiple dishes, utensils and eups in a short period of time enables me to quicken my hands for impor­tant blocking, striking and catching tech­niques. Handling freshly washed and hot plates also contribute hand speed similar to how children would play "hot potato." 
A simple task as walking to my dorm room provides an alternative to stair-climber machines. Being on the fourth floor, I get a good amount orstep climbing to strengthen my legs. Without the need for cumbersome weights or ,~quipmeni, I can get a good aAro­bic exercise by using the stairs rather than having to go Lo thr. athletic facilities. 
Books and bags can be encumbning when they are carried in relatively large numbers. llowever, that can be used to an advantage as walking f'rne weights bctwr,en classes. Again, the need for an exercise facilitv is eliminated with mundane objects serving "as weights. This system also proves to be very versatile, as morn books can be put into the bags for a more serious workout. With the addition of arm movnnwnt, bags become a training tool to pcrfoct arm motion and conditioning. 
Even the most boring and wearisome class­es can prove to be an asset to the martial artist-in-training. A boring and slceQ-inducing lecture can provide the perfect setting to test one's ability to meditate. Through concentra­tion, a studrmt can fight off natural sedatives that would otherwise make a lesser pnrson succumb to slumber and left vulnerable to attar:k. Or a second approach r,an be takfm to this. By stealthily positioning oneself' to avoid unwanted contact. one can effectivPly disap­pear from an instrur:tor's eye and bP left to sleep in dass. By subtle movements and manipulations, I have been able to quietly achieve an unconscious state of mind without disturbing my environment. Though the risks are great in this particular training technique, the bemdits arc in turn rewarding for those who can remain incognito. 
While thnsc techniques may not seem as striking for martial arts training, this same "hidden-ness" is what makes it so exception­ally potent. With discipline and imagination, one can perfect hf\r kung fu to levels beyond expectations.

Native Americans sue for rights to Syracuse University's land 
SYRACUSE, N.Y. 

Oneida County Native Americans asked the state government Tuesday to recognize their ownership of the majority of C1!ntral New York land. Tim Oneidas recently filed claims to six million acres or land, stretching from the Canac.Jian border in Lawrence County to southern Broome County, according to a Native American land rnclamation pamphlPt. 
The Native American nation expects to file a claim laler this year that will include the Syracuse area and Syracuse University, said Joseph lleath. an attorney for the Oneida nation. 
"This hill was undoubtedly an Onn11daga village," said He.ath, referring to the SU campus. "All of this land was theirs in 1770."

community members attended a dis­cussion Tuesday, hostBd by the Syracuse Social Movement Initiative, 
~ regarding Iroquois land claims. 
Thi\ Ounida, Cayuga, Soneca and Mohawk nations -all members of 1.lrn lroqunis Confederacy -also rcG<mLly filed land claims with tlrn st.ate government. 
A controversial chief executive officer of Oneida Industries said the Oneidas would sue thousands of CNY landowners and attempt to evict them f'rum the land, said Jnseph lleath, attornny for tlrn OnPida nation. 
The lawsuit, however, would only publicize the land reclamation movement and not result in eviction, 1leath said. 
"No land daim has evnr ncisultnd in taking individual's land if Uw per­son didn't want to snll it," he said. 
CP\JY rnsidf\nts rnac:t.nd to the land claims by organizing a protnst in Albany, calling t'or Governor G<iorgP Pataki to P-IHI tlw legal battl11. 
Iroquois reprnscntativns said tlwy do nol support using Pviction as a scare tactic. 
"Tim majority of' the Oneidas had no part in suing landowners," said .Joanne Shenandoah. an Oneida nation mernbl'r.

More than two months after the Board of Trustees

education or abolition. without the consent of the CFS

responsibility to end problems of sexual abuse and alco­

power tri determine the future of the Greek system be 
given to all students and not just the CFSC -was rejected 
after almost two hours of debate. The composition and 
tone of the mePting showed the extent to which the

¦ DlJKE UNNtBSITY Study solves problems with chemo 
DURHAM, N.C. 
Cancer researchers at l)uke University have gained new 

knowledge that could help the fight against cancer. The 
research, presented Tuesday at the American Association 
for Cancer Research meeting, outlined possible reasons why 
radiation and chemotherapy treatment in tumor cells are 
sometimes relatively ine!Tective. In the study, the scientists 
demonstrated that oxygen levels in rat tumor cells can 
change rapidly, often leaving tumor cells hypoxic -tacking 
sufficient oxygen. High levels of oxygen are essential to radi­
ation therapy because !1uctuation in oxygen levels leads to 
unstable oxygen atoms-called oxygen radicals, which attack 
the DNA of tumor cells, explained Mark Dewhirst, professor 
of radiation oncology and co-director of' the radiation oncol­
ogy program at the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center. 
The tumor cells then build up a resistance to radiation ther­

"More and morn our future depnnds on

Typically, between 8,000 to 20,000 peo­
ple takr. the Foreign Service exam each 
year, according lo Littrc·l. Of this number, 
about 200 to 220 pP-ople advance to take 
all-day oral examinations. Should they gain 
acceptance, tlrny am then placed on a list of 
potential people that can be called into ser­

particular needs and funding resources. 
Candidates that are called up receive an 
eight-week orientation and are assigned a 
post as a junior ollicer in a particular loca­

The State D11partment gives junior offi­
cers a live-year trial period during which 
they typically serve in two countries. If' they 
gain tenure. they may return to work in 
Washington or continue to specialize in a 
specific country or policy area. 

A candidate can repeat the Foreign 
Service exam as many timos as he or she 
dosires.

Media Gives No Rationale for NATO Bombing 
As I was getting rnady to write this column for today. I thought about what was happening in Kosovo these days, like the women and children getting carted off in one direction while their husbands, fathers and brothers arc carted off in another -to die. And I thought about how we wern bombing Kosovo and how we -and NATO ­were trying to contain the conflict. So I thought I would write an opinion piece on it. 
Nakasha Ahmad 

There is a reason why people suggest that one should write things down to "' get a clearer picture. Writing has always refined my ideas and put into dearer focus not just how I want to say something, but what I actually want to say. So I sat myself down with a vague idea about what I wanted to write about -what is going on in Kosovo and how somnthing is wrong. 
But when I started to write, I didn't know what I wanted to say. Bits and pieces of news fragments chased after onc1 another in my mind, trying to orga­nize themselves into a coherent and meaningful pattern, into some kind of black-and-while sense. I remembered hearing Senator John McCain on a talk show saying that we needed to go to Kosovo for our national interest to show the world that the U.S. was still a powrir -and adding thP humanitarian reasons as an afterthought. 
I remembered a representative from the Quaker l'aith on yet another talk show saying that bombing Kosovo is not the answer and can't solvn our problems. I rf'mcrnbPrecl the pictures of the refugees flooding into Albania and Macedonia. I remembered people debating about whether humanitarian interests should even affect American foreign policy and military involve­ments. And I remembered hearing oth­ers debating, not on whether we should have gotten involved for humanitarian reasons, but whether bombing Kosovo was the humanitarian solution. 
This is probably a really long way of saying that when l started to write, I didn't know what to say because I didn't have an opinion. At the begin­ning, I had thought the bombing was a good thing because I thought that this would stop the exodus from Kosovo. 
Now I don't know what to think. And I blame this on the lack of good, solid background information. I do realize that this is a complicated issue and that even if I had all the background infor­mation in the world I'd probably still be confused. The point is that I am deprived of the information that I need to really make an informed decision. 
If you read the newsp.apers or watch the television news or CNN, you get news about what happened that day ­how many bombs were dropped, how many missiles deployed, which high official made what promise -and to whom -the number of people dead and the number of people left. 
This is not to devalue that informa­tion. It is important that we know what is going on right now and that we be kept informed of what our country is doing. 
But we were never given the back­ground information that we would have needed to make an informed and intel-· ligent decision in the first place. The battle was not placed in context. We wcrcn 't told the history of the arna, or who started the conl1ict or what had taken place before. There was nu nar­rative -the news media treated it like something sprung out of the blue. 
What we needed -and what we still n,:od -is background information, 


context and the historv. Yes, it's com­plicated and v,:ould take time and space to tell. But why else do we have all­news networks? Isn't it to keep us informed? Surely newspapers can bump the story on Prince William's broken finger to give us some context on the conllict? We all know the rea­sons why this won't happen, but it would be nice, wouldn't it? 
We need to know what is going on. Not just because American women and men might be in danger, but bccausn there are human beings in clanger. 
Instead of the 1001 pundits on FoxNews. MSNBC, and CNN shouting theit· opinions -many complctnly uninformed-and winning their 1:i minutes of fame, we should havn back­ground and history on tlw con11irts affecting us right now. 

The news mndia have the purpose "to inf'orm, to instruct and to Pntcirlain." Surely the first two should have prnr.n­dencc over the latter?

No onn will dispulo Lim l'acL that Aparthoid was a lwinous affront to human rights and dignity. Tim outrage direct,:d toward Apartheid was wholly justifind. SurPly the dnnial of lngal rights -and most certainly tlrn denial of' human dignity intrnrPnt in the Board ol' Trustees' decision -is hardly less desrrving of scathing criti­cism. 
In April of 19fJ4, S<rnth Africa held its first all-racn elections. Jior the first time, every South African was given a roal voice. I vividly recall the sense ol' elation at cast­ing my ballot to rid South Afrir,a of' its. Apartheid past. At Notre Dame, wh(rn 1t comes to the non-discrimination clause, it appears that we don't even have a voice ­let alone a vote. 
One could argue that the Board of' Trustees, by reaching their decision in dosed session, by delaying thr, release of tlrnir decision and by consistently ignoring reasoned arguments from Notre Dame stu­dents, !'acuity, staff, clerics, alumni, prospective !'acuity and persons unaffiliat­ed with Notre Damn, resemble the intoler­ant Apartlrnid leadership who obdurately ignored world condemnation. 
Wlwn change nvrntually did come to South Africa, it was not the chaos and bluodshed prndicted by pro-apartheid fatalists; it resulted in a profoundly power­ful sensn of unity, equality and human dig­nity. 
Onlv wlrnn thr, non-discrimination clause is extnnded to include all members of the Notre Dame community will the University be able to claim that it truly fosters a spirit of inclusion.

Nine Students Travel South for the Center for Social Concerns' 

By COLLEEN GAUGHEN Viewpoim Editor
The lives and events of the civil rights movement that finally stirred the con­science of America came vividly to life for nine Notre Dame par­ticipants during spring break. The newest of the Center for Social Concerns (CSC) midsemester break programs, the Civil Rights Issues semi­nar offers students and staff an intense, hands-on learning experience that takes a critical look at the roots and misconceptions of the civil rights movement, the women and men who made it happen and what the impact has bPen on raee relations today. Tho idea for tho seminar was con­ceiveJ by llodney Cohen, director of urban programming at the CSC, who collaborated with senior coordinator Slwrrecia .Jones. "Most of the seminars tho CSC offers take you a,\ay from everyday reality," said Jones. "Wo wanted to develop a more tangible seminar that teaches how critical 1wHryday interaction is." ShP nxpluined that tho civil rights rnovpment has bcrome a popularized myth for the generation that just missed il, and that tlwrt! is a uced to oxplorn lh<' prrsonal rralities of all lfrnse who sacrificNl to make the move­ment happen, not just Martin Lutliiir King, .Ir. Tlw nin1i parlicipanls attended thre(' orientation sessions which included film prnsrntations, discussion and gu«)st s1rnakors, one or whom was l'rofossor Richard l'iPrce. who tcarhes 
a history course on the civil rights movement. "H.ights are constructed," said Pierce. "They are what \,\C 1;gree they are." 
He explained that the civil rights movement didn't begin in the 1960s but in the 1860s with the struggle for emancipation, and that the success of the 1960s is attributed to. the pivotal role of the church in the black commu­nity, as it was the only institution that was led, funded and supported by African­Americans at the time. 
In addition to attending the orienta­tion sessions, participants were also required to read several articles about the civil rights move­ment in preparation for discussion and the cen­tral focus of the seminar. a trip down south. 
The first stop was Atlanta, Ga., where the participants were immersed in the unique Africaa-t\merican community of th!' Atlanta University Cf'ntcr (AUC). Thn AUC consists of six histor'ical black colleges -Clark Atlanta Cniversity, :vtorris Brown College, Morehouse CollegP, Spelman College. Morehouse School or Medicine and the 


Interdenominational Theological Center. Participants stayed at the vari­ous campuses. 
"I've never been a minority before," said sophomore Colleen Garvey. "I have so much more respect for those who voluntarily place themselves in a situa­tion where they know they will be." 
One of the many featured events was lunching at Paschal's Restaurant, a central gathering place during the 
movement that earned the name "Little City llall." 
Other main events in Atlanta included a ler.ture by Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, th<' first African­Am c r i ea n woman to rep­resent Georgia in the U.S. House of Heprcscntativos, and a lncturn by Ambassador Andrew Young, 
a key leader during the civil rights mov('mcnt. Thl' group also toured thP Auburn Avcmuc Hcsearch Library, the Martin Luthnr King, Jr. Center for Nun, iolent Social Change and the llnrndon llouso, ihe home of Alonzo Ilerndon, a former slave who becanw the l'irst African-;\mcrican millionaire. 
From ,\tla.nta the seminar partici­pants travf'led to Birmingham, /\la.. whern they toured Kelly-Ingram Park, 
Image courtesy of the National Civil Rights Museum 
the Alabama .Jazz llall of Fanrn and Lim historic: 16th Street Baptist Church, where !'our girls were killed in a bomb­ing on Sept. 15, 1%3. 
The participants later met thn aunt of one of the girls killed in the bombing, whose very presence rnminded them how very rncnnt the struggle for civil rights really is. 
"Birmingham has an aura that exudes the historical spirit of the move­ment," said junior Stephen Valdez. "It manifests itself in the pnople you ment, the sights you see and the feding you get when you walk around Lim city." 
One of the unanimous highlights of' tho trip was an emotional visit to thn Birmingham Civil Rights lnstituk, which housos soveral intoractivc dis­plays on the history of tlrn civil rights movement, including film and 1rnw~ rootagn, a walk through a surround­sound room with voices depicting Ow climate ol' violence and intimidation that. rninCorcnd segregation in Lim South, and tlw f'ront half' of' a burrrncl out bus from the Frncdom Hidnrs. 
The participants also visitnd lloly Family El1)m(mtary and lligh schools whost) vice-principal William Kindall offered his personal cxpcrit)nccs during tho civil rights movnrncnt and insight on the current issues of' aflirmativn action and racn relations. Kindall reminded tlin group that civil rights issues aro still very much alivn and that the struggln f'or equality has only just begun. 
"This trip has a lot of' potnntial f'or tho future," said sophomore Alison Wcltnt\r. "I think pcopk would really want to learn more about tht)sc iss1ws now that tlwy havc tlw opportunity."

A scandalously clad cast goes to school with Restoration comedy 
By BRIAN SEAMAN ScL'llL' ·, hc:tter Cridc 
I first glanrn, with sillwu­t'ttes anrl shadows mas.king.

A
the! dC'lails of till' actors 

standing un stag(', "Tlw School !'or Scandal." which opP1rnd WPdnesday at Washington llall. ('ould SPPlll to bl' nothing mon• than a produl"lion or a moth-catnn 1)('riod piece. Yet as tlw lights come up, on1~ realizes that sud1 an assumption is far l'rllm tlw truth. 
While tlw shapes of the costumes on the artors standing on stage are very realistic, the patterns. colors and prints are anything but archaic. Onf' propPr lady with a white pow­dered wig has a model sailing ship sinking into her over-coiffed hair. while another wears a leather corset more suited to a dominatrix than a proper l.1dy of uppe1·-class London. An i11teresting. dapper man seems to han' a marijuana joint stashed away in the tuck of his wig for safekeep­ing. 
With such a first impression, it is obvious this production will be any thing but moth-eaten. 
These wildly unique costumes are the creations of designer Richard Donnelly and director Mark Pilkington. The production has been a dream of theirs for over a decade. 
"We have wanted to bring back the wittv and acerbic ideas of the Restoration," said Pilkington. "And when we finally got the opportunity to do this, we wanted to try some­thing new." 
"The School for Scandal" was first presented in 1777, yet the topics presented within it are timely even today. The story foilows a group of gossips who attempt to ruin the rep­utations of two seemingly upstand­ing brothers; a plot thickened by deception, lust and high comedy. 
Author Richard Brinsley Sheridan wrote the play in response to a growing trend of drama in which humor was evolving from laughing comedy to sentimental comedy. Sheridan responded with "The School for Scandal," a piece which is believed to be one of the greatest
·• and most hilarious English comedies ever written. The cast of 19 includes all classes of students, from seniors Rick Janor and Jennie Rener to freshmen Steve Donlan and Matt Lee, all of whom were chosen from a large audition pool to make up the cast. The choice of this play emanates from a 10-year absence of such a Restoration come­
cly, and il s1•nms appar1•11t that tlw 1·ast has thoroughly Pnjoypd lhP procnss. 
"Tlw cast as a whol1· was rclatiwly i1wxpPriPncPd with this typP of' tl1c>­al(1r, yet WP w1!r<' all rc·ady to work liard, ll'arn and have run, and this will bf' verv obvious in thP f'inal product," said sophomor(• .Joe llowarlh. 
p Ia r ill g H(' S 1o r a t i O 11 (' 0 111 I' dy i11 vvhkh man11Prs and rPputation are of utmost importancP may seem for­e-. ig n to m o de r n a u cl iP nl" (ls an d actors, yet thP cast and production staff' rose abovP lhis problnrn by immersing tlrnmselves not only in six weeks of intc>nsi> relwarsal. but also in a physical setting worthy of 18th century drama. 
The stage of Washington llall has been transformed into an English hall of drama, complete with billow­ing cords of red curtains and evrm footlights on the (•dgr ol' the stage, all designed by Bruce Auerbach. Freshman Ryan Cunninghan, who recently appeared in Pasquorilla East's production of' "Godspell." relates the importance of these his­torically correct clements to the authenticity of tho acting in the show. 
"Walking out onto the stage and being surrounded by the Restoration setting gives us a sense of realism, especially when our costumes are so extravagant," said Cunningham. 
Without a doubt. the costumes in this production are sure to be one of the highlights, and such anachro­nisms combined with modern pat­terns and fabrics will assuredly be of great interest to the audience. The intent was to match the color and design of the costume to help sug­gest the nature of each character. 
Each character has a distinct and viable personality trait, and the cos­tumes are designed as such. One particularly slimy character named Snake is dressed in snakeskin and each time his name is said, an odd sounding snake hiss resonates through the theater. Such punctua­tions of modern comedic elements, such as physical comedy, sight gags and double entendres, coupled with a Hestoration story, are bound to assure a unique evening of theater. 
Further costume innovations include a maid whose dress is made of red, gingham-print table cloths, a traveler character with a map of the world shirt and a license plate vest and a drunk whose shirt is covered with scattered scribblings of Budweiser. In this way, the play 


transcends the 18th century and forges a viable link to the present. 
Mark Pilkington. director for "The School for Scandal," wants to make such a link apparent to the audi­ence. He hopes that students will forgo all misapprehensions about this type of comedy of manners and enjoy the production, as Pilkington suggests. 
"This show is absolutely funny. People who see it are meant to have a good time, and they will," he said. 
The production concludes this year's Mainstage season. which included "Cat on a !lot Tin Hoof." "Getting Wrecked" and "The Angel's Cradle." 
The production opens tonight at 
7:30 p.111. and continues through Saturday night at that same time with an additional matinee Sunday at 2::rn p.m. Student tickets are $6 and can be purchasod al the LaFortunc Information Desk or at the door.

Recker leaves Hoosier 
dreams behind 
Associalcd Press 

AUBURN, Ind. 
Luke' Hecker. Indiana's leading scorer last season, said Wednesday IH1 would transfer to anothor college beco.ns(l he was not satisfied with his 1hwnlnpment as a. playor. 
The 6-foot-6 sophomorr swingman is the third starter f'or the Hoosiers to loav13 in the past two years. 
"This is the toughest deci­sion I have evflr made," Heckel' said in a f'axnd state­ment. "I love the state of Indiana, and playing for IU was always my lif'('long dream." 
ltecker had given coach Bob Knight one of his earliest commitments. saying even before his junior year at DeKalb High School that hn would play for tho Hoosiers. lie started 30 of 32 games and averaged 12.8 points a game as a freshman. then started ;~3 of 34 games last season, averaging 16.1 points per gamo. 
The former Indiana high school Mr. Basketball. who played both guard and for­ward for the Hoosiers, said he has not decided where he will transfer. lie will have to sit out one season and then have two years of eligibility remaining. 
"lt is not easy to l11avo my friends, my family and my home state," Hecker said. "I love to play baskPtball, and the thought of sitting out a year kills me." 
Guard Neil Heed left Indiana after the ·1997 sea­son, accusing Knight of physi­cal and verbal abuse. and later onrolled at Southern Mississippi, where his father is an assistant coach. In December 1997, center Ja.son Collier quit the team, saying he no longer could take Knight's constant criticism, 
uml enrolled ut C,eorgia Tllch. whom his f'uthPr playnd in the '1970s. 
Heck or. hownvor. indicatnd 
his decision was not bn('ausn 
or Knight. 
"l approdatc' tlw opportuni­ty givPn to Ill!' by coach Knight.," Im :,;nid. "Ilownvnr. I havo not be,m satislird with my dcvolopnwnt as a playor. I blame no one but mysPII' for this and lwliovn my dPv1;lop­ment will lwst IH· servrd in another program." 
Dick McKean, 11thldic director at DeKalb lligh School. said lw didn't know what prom pH)d Huck" r's decision. 
Humors that Bockpr was consid(~ring a t.ransl'er bngan to pick up during a slump in his play in .January. Ile was held to a single puinl in a loss to Michigan Sl.atn and didn't start the next game, when he managed .only sevHn poinl.s off the bench in an ovort.irnn lnss at Minnesota. Knight didn't say why Hecker did not start, although ,iarlier in tlw Big Ton season ho bonchad Hecker because of' his del'Pn­sivo lapses. 
Knight was at. a coaching clinic in Cuba and could not be reached for comment. Tnam spokesman Grogg Elkin said he had no indication Hecker was planning to leave. 
"There arc rumors every year about somebody," Elkin said. "Ile had been going through our offseason condi­tioning program, and ii' you're going to transfer,. why do that?" 
A statomnnt from tho Indiana athletic departmnnt and released by Elkin said, "We are very sorry that LukP has dccidrd to !nave Indiana University. lie has been an integral and important. part of' our basketball program the last two years. We will miss him. We wish him much suc­cess as he gons forward."

Is it too early to start figuring out magic numb<'rs? Ilow abouL putting playoff tickets on sale? 
At the rate tlwy're going, the Clnveland Indians could have tlw AL Crntra l locked up by Mav. 
s'andv Alo111ar hit his first homer ·since last August and Mannv Ramirez hit a thrne-run shot in Clev!•land's ninP.-run sixth inning as the Indians e.xte.nded tlmir winning streak to senm 'v\'(ldnrsday night with an 11-4 \'\in over the Kansas­City Royals. 
Cleveland, which bunched al! 14 of its hits in a three-inning span starting in the fourth, lrnsn't lost since opening day. t\nd with another game left against Kansas City and thrnr morn over thn weekend against Minnesota, it's going to take a superb pitching effort to stop the Indians. 
During the seven-game streak -their longest since 1995 ­t.hc Indians have outscored the opposition 69-28 and have 35 doubles, three triples, 10 homers and are batting .:-371. 
Roberto Alomar went 3-for-4 with two runs srnred and Richie Sexon had two hits for the Indians, who didn't get their first hit until the fourth inning off Kansas City starter Jeff Suppan (1-ll. 
RookiP Carlos Fobles hit an 
inside-the-park homer and dou­
bled for tlw Royals. 
Bartolo Colim (2-0) allowPd 
thrP(1 runs and sevPn hits in six 
innings to improvp to 3-0 
against th!1 Hoyals over thf' past 
two seasons. Ile struck out 
SP.Vl'.11. 
Sandv Alomar's two-run shot off Dm1 \V(~ngPrt was his first since Aug. l last season -a span of 13:i at-bats -and gave the Indians an 8<~ lead. 
Trailing 3-2, Hobbie Alomar opened the sixth with a double, and aft11r taking third on Ramirez's single, scored on Jim Thome's base hit. t\ft11r Travis Fryman singled in the go-ahead run, Sexson's two-run double put the Indians up 6-'.i. 
EnriquG Wilson hit a two-out single and moved to third when H.obbbie Alomar singled. The Royals had a chance to get out of the inning when Alomar got hung up in a rundown, but when Febles decided io throw to third and get Wilson. both run­ners got back safely. 
Hamirez followed with his sec­ond horner. a shot to right-om­ter that gave him a league-lead­ing 14 RBIs. 
Fr.bles' first earner IH)mi>r -a l.wo-run, inside-the-parker -in the second inning gave the Hoyals a 3-0 lead. 
T1m Spohr's RBI double put the BovaIs ahead 1-0 lead in tlrn second before Febles drove a 2­2 pitch from Colon to deep cen­tPr that kir.ked off the wall past Lofton and rolled toward right, allowing FP.b!es to circle the bases. 
It was jusl the second inside­
the-park homer in Jacobs Fif>ld 
history and came almost a year 
to the day after the other one. 
On April 15 last season, 
Cleveland's David Rell hit an 
inside-tho-park homer off 
Seattle's Handy Johnson. 
Suppan retired the first nine 
batters before walking Kenny 
Lorton to open the fourth. One 
out later, Lofton went to third 
on a wild pitch and scored on 
Alomar's double. 
l:ardinals 9, Pirates 5 
Darren Bragg hit his first two NL homers and the St. Louis Cardinals squandArcd a four­run lead before rallying with tho help of some sloppy Pittsburgh defense to beat the Pirat"'-9-5 Wednesday night. 
Manny Aybar (1-0) bailed out an ineffective Kent Merckcr with three scoreless relief innings and tho Cardinals won their S(1cond in a row even though Mark McGwire was O­for-4 with two strikeouts and a walk. 
The Cardinals' five relievers combined for seven shutout innings. 
Pirates rookie starter Kris Benson (1-1) rctirnd Mc:Gwirc three times, only to have trouble with the rest of the lineup, sur­rendering eight runs -six camed -on l O hits over 4 2/3 innings.

Benson was in trouble from the start as Fernando Tatis had a two-run double in the first and Bragg hit his first St. Louis homer in tlw second following Joe McEwing's single. Bragg homered .again in the eighth off relieV(!r Jeff Wallac1l. 
Benson helped get himself back in the game with a two­run double in the second -his first major league hit -as tho Pirates chased Mcrr.ker by sr:or­ing fiwi runs in two-plus innings to brielly take a 5-4 lnad.

Overtime goal gives Leafs win 
Associated Press 
TORONTO 

Former Islander Bryan Berard scored 42 seconds into ovPrtime to give the Toronto Maple Leafs a 3-2 victory over N1iw York on Wednesday night and a rlub-rncord 45th win of the season. 
Mats Sundin and Garry Valk also scored fo1· the Maple Lnafs (45-29-7), who clinched fourth place in the Eastern Conference and home-ice advantage for the first round of tho NHL playoffs. 
The team's prrvious record was set by the 1992-93 Maple Leafs (44-29-11 ), who finished with 99 points. 
Felix Potvin made 35 saves for New York in his first appearance against his for­mer teammates since being traded Jan. 9 to the Islanders for Berard. 
Mats Lindgren had one goal and an assist for New York, while Mariusz Czerkawski scored his 20th. 
Down 2-1 with 3:12 left in 
regulation, the Maple Leafs 
tifld it when Steve Thomas set 
up Sundin on a 2-on-2 rush 
and the Toronto captain slid 
the puck under a sliding 
Potvin. 
In the opening minutes of overtime, Thomas fed Berard during a 2-on-1 rush for the winning goal. 
Potvin. who missed two 
months with a groin injury, 
was coming off a franchise­
tying 55-save performance 
Monday in New Jersey. 
Curtis .Joseph, who made 22 
savr-s, recorded his 35th win 
of the season to surpass 
Potvin (1993-94), Mike 
Palmateer (1977-78) and .John 
Bower (1959-60) for the most 
Maple Leaf wins in one sea­
son. 
The Islanders had the first 
eight shots of the game and 
opened the scoring on 
Lindgren's power-play goal at 
6:04. 
Valk tied the game 6:58 into 
the second period off a 
rebound, but Czerkawski put 
the Islanders ahead again 
when he jammed the puck 
past Joseph from behind the 
net. 
Red Wings 4, Predators 2 

Larry Murphy set up two goals and Brent Gilchrist scored for the first time in over a year as the Detroit Red Wings beat the Nashville Predators 4-2 Wednesday night. 
Detroit has won nine of 11 games since making several big deals at the trading dead­line. 
Nashville lost for the third time in four games. 
13ill Ranford. one of Detroit's pickups, madfl 22 saves to earn his third victories in four starts for the Red Wings. 
Detroit is 5-1 against Nashville overall and 3-0 at home. 
Nashville got the first peri­od's only goal. With Chris Chelios in the box for rough­ing, Andrnw Brunette tipped Cliff Honning's shot between his own legs and through Ranford's. 
The goal. Brunette's 11th, ended a 15-game scoring drought. 
Detroit tied the game at 
8:51 of the second. Wendel Clark ripped a slap shot off Urn goal post and the rebound skipped to Mathieu Dandcnault at the blue line. 
Dandenault fired his own 
slap shot that sailed over 
Mike Dunham's shoulder. 
Sergei Fedorov made it 2-1 
for Detroit 50 seconds later. 
Fedorov took a pass from 
Murphy. split Dan Keczmer 
and Jan Vopat, and slid the 
puck under Dunham while on 
his knees. Detroit is 20-2-3 in 
games when Fedorov scores 
this season, and is under .500 
when he doesn't. 
Scott Walker tied it again at 
12:34 of the second when Nashville turned a poor Red Wings power play into a goal. Vitali Yachmanev picked up a loose puck and fed Walker for a breakaway, just as Ronning was coming out of the box. 
Before the period could end, 
the Red Wings had regained 
the lead. Dunham made a 
spectacular sprawling save on 
Murphy, but Gilchrist tucked 
the rebound into the net. It 
was Gilchrist's first goal since 
March 1998, after which he 
had undergone a hernia oper­
ation. 
Detroit made it 4-2 with a 
shorthanded goal at 2:50 of 
the third. 
Vyacheslav Kozlov took a 
drop pass from Igor J.arionov 
and put a slap shot just inside 
tlrn post for his 29th goal. 
Petr Sykora, acquired from Detroit during the offseason, 
made his NHL debut for Nashville. 
Hurricanes 3, Capitals 0 
Hon Francis scored a pair of goals and Arturs lrbe record­ed his sixth shutout of the season as the Carolina Ilurricanes defeated the Washington Capitals 3-0 Wednesday night. 
The victory pushed the Southeast Division champions four games over .500 with two regular-season games left ­assuring the franchise its fourth winning season in 20 years and first since 1989-90. 
Meanwhile, the Capitals lost for the fifth straight time and 10th in the last 12 games. Injury-riddled Washington, playing without leading scorer Peter Bondra and top defense­m an Sergei Gonchar, has been limited to only five goals during its five-game skid. 
Carolina led 1-0 before 
putting the game away with 
two goals in a 38-second span 
in the third period. 
Francis connected for his 
21st of the season and second 
of the game on a 5-on-3 
power play with 8:28 left, 
while Gary Roberts notched 
his 14th less than a minute 
later. 
Francis' first score in the 
first period gave him 20 goals 
for the 17th time in 18 l\HL 
seasons. 
The only time the center

Hey! You Seniors Out There! Jim Lies, C.S.C. 

Well, we've entered the home stretch. I wish I could provide here some pearl of wis­dom that could make these final days at Notre Dame all that you would have them be._ There won't prove enough time in each <;:1-ay, especially as the weather improves (if ever it does!), to spend with friends and to visit those places on this campus which mean the most to you, much less study! 
As r think back, oh so long ago, on my waning days at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, I remember most the late nights spent with those who had come to mean so much to me over the years. The gatherings I remember with particular fondness weren't the occasions when we happened into one another as we often did in the places we normally frequented. lt was those intentional times, those times that we went out of our way to gather and to do something special together, that I remember most now. As our days together grew fewer we found ourselves particularly atten­tive to just such gatherings: an overnight at the lakeside cottage of one of our num­ber; a Mass that we coordinated with a priest friend at one of the off-campus hous­es; a walk with a friend on the meandering paths beside the Mississippi 'which bor­ders the campus. 
I remember one night in particular which seems almost corny in the retelling but which meant the world to me then, and does still. Eight of us who had been particu­larly dose during our years together at St. Thomas decided that we weren't going to leave that place without ritualizing in some way all that we had known together and celebrate all the ways that we had grown together. Although we.were all busy folks, the reality of our imminent departure compelled us to make the time that we seemed never to have. Our schedules dictated that we would gather very late and very local. We settled on a weekend night in late April. We decided that we would head to the other side of the river by car and then wade out to a large sandbar which was easily accessed from that side and which had always beckoned us from the cam­pus side (however much the signs to the contrary might have discouraged more timid spirits). 
It was Midnight before we arrived with our provisions and a guitar in tow. We set­tled into a large circle, stoked up a small, albeit illegal, campfire and proceeded to remember, and to sing and to pray. We didn't really have an agenda, and I don't remember that any one of us felt particularly competent to lead prayer, but we just knew that it was what we had to do; we knew it was, somehow, the men and women we had become over our years together. We had become people who knew that we were somehow bound up not only with each other, but with God, and because of God. As we entertained, and feared, life beyond the community that we had come _to know and love, we knew ourselves to need something more than each other to sustain and nurture us, and in some sense, something more than ourselves to keep us together. We were headed in a variety of directions and vocations: to great professional opportunities, to the Peace Corps, to a domestic service program, to professional and graduate schools, and to unemployment. We talked and we hiughed and we cried, and as the sun was peaking up in the eastern sky we each took time to pray aloud for one another and for those things which most consumed our minds and our hearts on that early spring morning near the end of our senior 
year. 

• 
l warned you that it could sound corny in the retelling, and yet I make no apologies. This was a significant event in our young lives. And while it may, in the details, sound like a terribly "sixties" thing to do (it was actually the mid-eighties), there is a timelessness to such gatherings; unbounded, please God, by convention, and inspired in their "corniness" by the Spirit and by the love the we have for one anoth­er. When it comes to valuing and deepening some of the most important friendships that we've ever had, I refuse to believe that the late nineties are really all that differ­
-
ent than the sixties, or the mid-eighties. They are part and parcel of the human, communal experience, measuring and marking our passages on the journey of life. Dostoevski spoke of such a gathering in The Brothers K. .. "Let us agree that we shall never forget one another. And whatever happens... remember how good it felt when we were all together, united by a good and decent feeling, which made us better people, probably, than we would otherwise have been.'' 
There was nothing particularly noteworthy about our gathering, some fifteen years ago, other than the fact that it happened, that eight people took a little time to be together and to mark the holiness of their days together. It will surely go unnoted in the recorded history of human events, but for those of us who were there, it is one of the most memorable 111oments of our young lives. There is irony in the fact that the moment during which we gathered to remember all that mattered most to us has become the moment we most remember. I'll dose by simply urging each of you to attend to just such moments. Think twice before you say yet again that you're just too busy or that you don't have enough time; it's all the time you've got. The only 
l¦I 

shame greater than risking to gather in such a way, risking to speak the depths of 
0MPUS 

our truth to one another, is not risking it, and never knowing how rich life could

The loss marred an otherwise stellar performance by Stedman Oakey. The junior midfic]d('r scored thret: of Notre Dam(\'s four goals. David Ulrich and John Flandina assist('d on 0akey's last two goals. Steve Bishko scored the remaining goal on an assist by Brad Owrn.

fourth, loading up the bases with no outs. But three straight strikeouts allowed him to pitch out of the jam. 
The Irish took advantage of a record of fruitful fifth innings this season, outscoring their opponents 24-7 in the frame. First baseman Matt Nussbaum nailed the third Notre Dame hit that made its wav out of the infield for a single. Matt Strickroth cleared the bases on the first pitch to knot the game at two. 
Strickroth. who is hitting 3-for-6 in his last two games, including his first collegiate homerun last Sunday against Pittsburgh, is one of the many Irish who have surpris11d opposing pitchers. Nussbaum fits the same description, as he was the only Irish hitter to earn two hits Wednesday. 
"We spent a lot of time in the off­season with the mindset of just trying to get our.snlvns rendy to play," Nussbaum said. "Because with a 56-, 60-. dose to 70-game season, ,wery­onc·s going to get a chance to play. I know my cha111·1~ would come sooner or later; it just happen,•d to come sooner and I was ready for it."

"I just tried to put myself in the posi­tion out on the mound where I could throw strikes and hopefully give our team a chance to win at the end of the game," he said. 
Jeff Percontc started the eighth with a walk and advanced to second on a stolen base before left-hander Mark Ritz was brought in to face the lefty O'Toole. He hit a bouncer up the mid­dle that set up a Perconte play at the plate, which he beat out to tie the game. He injured his left shoulder on the play and immediately left the game. · 
Shortstop Brant Ust scored O'Toole for the first Irish lead before slugger Jeff Wagner picked up his only hit of 
the game to drive home Ust, making it 5-3. Ken Meyer shipped in to pinch run for Wagper and a double by Nussbaum drove him in for the final score of 6-3. 
The late-inning rally has become common­place for Notre Dame in recent games, now with 12 comeback wins this soason. 
"We always try to ju mp alwad to begin with," Nussbaum said. "It just so happens that we've be<)n sort or a slow-starting team for most of our games. ! think that's something we pride ourselves in, winning the late innings, the sev,rn, 1dghth and ninth innings. If you can win those three innings then you put yourself in a position to win a lot or games."
