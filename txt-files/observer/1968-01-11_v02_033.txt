News In Brief: 
Coley l 
Ocoley O'Brien, who has made a name 
for himself as runner-up to quarterback 
Terry Hanratty, is reportedly considering 
new fame as runner-up to John Moore, 
the latest declared candidate for Student 
Body President. O'Brien's candidacy for 
Student Body Vice-President is not yet 
official. According to John Moore, the 
Senator from Morrissey Hall, "Coley is 
still making up his mind." 
Moore, however, is a definite candidate 
for office because, he says, "I want to be 
Student Body President." 

O'Dea Quits 
0 Dennis O'Dea announced Wednesday 
that he has handed the reins of the Free, 
University over to St. Mary's Junior 
Suzanne Smither. O'Dea said, though, 
that he would continue to work with the 
Free University. 

Delphic Distress 
0 No}re Dame Senior Edward Kurtz plus former students Dennis Lopez and Mi­chael Bowler will appear in South Bend City Court Friday to face charges of vio­lating South Bend health and fire ordi­nances at the Delphic Oracle. Kurtz, man­ager of the Oracle, said Wednesday the trio would claim that police entered the premises without a warrant, that both ordinances have expired and long since been rewritten, and that neither ordi­nance applies to what is going on at the Oracle. 
Kurtz said the Oracle planned to con­tinue in operations and in fact expand into a cooperation. He said that, under the dance hall license granted to the club late last year, the club cannot be refused a license renewal. City officials denied a new license last week, claiming the club 

Alumni's Peculiar Love 
By TOM FIGEL 
Richard Rosenthal, the newly elected 
President of the Notre Dame Alumni, is a 
soft-spoken athletic man who speaks of 
Notre Dame in the way English teachers 
speak of Shakespeare. His eyes look far 
away and his phrases are careful. "There 
is a kind of particular love that alumni 
have for the University," he says. "As 
alumni, we get to appreciate more what 
Notre Dame means." 

As Alumni President, Mr. Rosenthal, 
34, is the chief representative of almost 
47,000 alumni in 176 clubs. The new 
Alumni Senate, which will consist of 
"between 50 and ISO men" is an "exten­
sion of communication" among alumni, 
a job the thirteen member Alumni Board 
has been unable to handle in years past. 
Mr. Rosenthal hopes that the Senate will 
also contribute to better student-alumni 
relations. 

Students and alumni are inter-related, 
he feels; since "students will spend more 
of their lives as alumni than as students, 
it is important that we get to know each 
other." To cultivate understanding be­
tween the two groups, Mr. Rosenthal 
suggests that "area clubs might have dis­
cussion nights with students from the 
same area" and that "members of the A­
lumni Board could meet with student 
groups." 

There are two reasons for the exis­
tence of the Alumni Association. The 
first is the bond of past attendance at the 
University; and the Association now 
works to satisfy the needs of men who 
wish to remain in contact with each other. 
Second, the Alumni organization works 
to help the University attain its goals. The 
alumni expect Notre Dame to be "the 
truly great university of the world. I think 
we've been particularly fortunate," 
Mr. Rosenthal says," that we've turned 
out not only competent engineers or' 
teachers but some substantial leaders­
solid citizens -as well." 
Mr. Rosenthal stresses the. willingness 
of the alumni to help the University real­
ize its goals. They are goals which do not 
originate, at least formally, with the alum­
ni. More often, according to Mr. Rosen­
thal, the University presents its plans to 
the Alumni Board and asks for criticism, 
and then for help. "I don't ever see the 
Alumni Board being competant to super­
impose itself over the Vice-President of 
Academic Affairs, for example." 
About rule changes (the abolishment of hours), the Alumni Board is usually "informed, rather than asked." 
If the University can make a strong argument for a program, Mr. Rosenthal feels that the Alumni will always be wil­ling to help; even if the program is total merger or closer cooperation with St. Mary's. "If we can be convinced that a course of action is helpful to the Universi­ty, we are of course willing to lend our help," he say~. 
The University's future potential is great, Mr. Rosenthal feels, and "wi1l be de­monstrated by what kind of leaders it turns out. I would be disappointed if we 
lost that ability to turn out competent citizens." The alumni are willing to sacri­fice their money and time to achieve Notre Dame's potential because "We see what the University is doing as a force for good, something valuable in our lives. It seems only natural that we would like to see this force of good continue and expand in all its fun tions." 
Senate Hears Bill Making Union Independent of S.G. 

A new plan for naming of the Student Union President was revealed to the Se­nate Wednesday night. The plan, which received its first reading in the Senate, calls for appointment of the Union presi­dent by this year's Union Board instead of waiting for next year's student body administration 
At the present time, the Student Body President appoints the Union Presi­dent. The Board which consists of the Student Body President, the Vice Presi­dent for Student Affairs, the Student Union Treasurer, two student senators, and a faculty member, approves the selec­tion. 
Under the new proposal, submitted by stay senator Bob Rigney, the Union Presi­dency aspirants will submit applicatiom to the Board independent of the Student Body President. The Board will select an applicant and submit the name for Senate ratification. 
In other business: the Senate passed by consent a resolution of Walsh Senator Pat Dowd calling for cars for second se­
mester Seniors. Senior Class President Mike Minton spoke for the resolution, 
Student Committee Seeks Recommendations for Study 
Administration-faculty-student Com­channeled to the committee. mittee for Student Life study, announced "The committee will be concerned today, that it is seeking recommendations as well with questions regarding why the from students for investigation by the University does this or that, what the Un­
which endorsed Senior cars and called for the Senior Class President to use his office 
to secure the right. 
Speaking in favor of his resolution, Dowd and Minton cited such factors as employment opportunities and social en­gagements as making cars essential for seniors. He called for immediate passage, saying action would be necessary at the General Assembly of Students if "Hes­burgh again turns a deaf ear to our reason­ing." 
Minto~ read the Senate a letter to Fr. Hesburgh citing reasons for change in the car rule. He cited the time factor in life of the second semester senior, plus the need for mobility. The letter stated "Cars could mean the difference between a good job opportunity or no job op­portunity at all." Examining the social factor, Minton reflected "Future plans should not be discussed in the back of a cab or over the road of a city bus." 
Minton wrapped up his contentions to Hesburgh by forecasting that senior cars would involve a maximum of 250 additional cars, and saying university parking facilities could handle this num­ber. 
A final piece of Senate business was approval of NSA membership dues and operations expenses. These called for Stu­dent Body election of NSA voting dele­gates, and student body subsidizing of on­ly these elected delegates.

committee. 

The Student life committee, a 15 man tri-partite board organized last sem­ester by the administration, met for the first time Monday. 
Committee Chairman and Vice Pres­ident of Student Affairs Rev. Charles McCarragher C.S.C. defined the purpose of the committee as a move toward "the betterment of student life, and student living, that any problem that affected the students on campus whether academic or administrative or otherwise could be iversity's attitude is on various campus problems and what students think should be done at the University in order to have 
the best results possible." 
For students to have a particular problem discussed by the committee, Fr. McCarragher said that the problem should be filed at the office of the Vice President of Student Affairs. The next scheduled meeting of the Student Life Committee is to be held January 31, the first day of the second semester. 

YR Meet 

The board of the Midwest Federation of Young Republicans will meet at Notre Dame late in February according to Notre Dame Sophomore Mike Kelly, Secretary of the Federation. Kelly predicted Tues­day night that the meeting will be an im­portant one, and serve as launching point for Federation offices and youth cam­paigns on the national level.

Patriot of the Year Award. ~-­
It's futile to say again why there should not be a patriot of the year award. But with the Student Body Presidency race upcoming, it may not be so futile to examine the election system perpetrated by Minton to bear this year's patriot. 
It was all going to be very simple, Minton said at the beginning. The Patriot committee was going to nominate some people and then the Seniors were going to vote for the Patriot. 
The Patriot committee din nominate some people but apparently they were the wrong

people; for after a meeting with Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, President of Notre Dame, Minton de­cided that the list of nominees should be enlarged. 
And enlarged it was, so as to insure that the one idiotic nomination, namely Paul Harvey, would not get Notre Dame laurels. 
Finally, after the nominees were nominated by the nominators, the seniors had their chance to say something. At least it seemed that way. 
But in Minton's Rules of Order things are never that simple. Let us go back to the thrilling days when seniors voted for things and the votes really counted. Counting I think is one thing Minton's committee failed to do. Because it is two months from the election day, one month from the day our great patriot will be here, and zounds! Good ole Mayor Minton hasn't announced the winner. 
What has been done is a~ simple as VietNam. 
.~'1nton and his committee realized that the man who won the patriot of the year award may not be able to make the speaking date. So they are waiting to see who will be able to make the en­gagement. Voila, enter the 1968 patriot. 
Makes one wonder why they gave the award in absentia to Westmoreland last year. Everything makes sense. At least it does according to Min­ton's rules. 
But who really cares about this patriot game? If anyone did they wouldn't let good ole Mayor Mike pull off a stunt like this. He's got just the principles we need for a man to sit on the elec­tion control board for the Student Body Presi­dential race next semester. 
After all, no one cares about that either. Min­ton will at least make sure the winner shows, which is about all you can say for the Patriot 
Party. 1111!!!!-~--~~-~-~~-­

I am thoroughly enchanted by the note of pure absurdity introduced into the question of course evaluation by your having substituted the word "profes­sors" for the word "students" in quoting my letter to Mr. Clark Stanton.

Those Magical Beatles 
By JOHN ALZAMORA 
Once again the Beatles have taken us by surprise. What more can they do after the "splendid 
time ... guaranteed for all" in the musical "summersets" and cartwheels of Sgt. Pepper's? The answer in day-glo letters and fantastical words is THE MAGI­CAL MYSTERY TOUR, a trip of its own kind. By rights this album should have been a patch­work of their singles released since Sgt. Pepper's plus a few ft\1­er pieces as we find in their album Yesterday ... and Today. Yet it has a unity and a character of its own to make it more than a collection of random recordings. 
"Wha?" you say. What's going on? Where are we being taken? Or, are we just being taken, per­iod. What's all this nonsense? Why is the prose of the story written in a nine year old's vocabulary? Why should I spend my money for this? Why; because "a splendid time is guaranteed for all", that's why. What the Beatles are doing in this album 
' is defining their position as en tertainers. They do work a cer­tain magic on us and change our experience of things. They are wizards of their own making and they do change shape with each of their songs. Filled with people of all age catagories the bus represents the total audience that the Beatles try to reach. The album begins with the title song "MagicalMysteryTour" which like the introduction to Sgt. Pepper's sets the mood for the rest of the album: Roll up, roll up for the Mys­tery Tmr They've got everything you 
need 

Satisfaction guaranteed. . . It moves on into "The tool on the Hill", a lyric about a Buddha figure who has no answer to the world except silence; it's a mys­terious tune, to say the least, which captures an occult vision of eternity. Yet what saves it from mummification is the light air of music echoing the big band ballads of the forties. Next we come to a rare instrumental, "Flying", that breaks into George Harrison's contribution, "Blue Jay Way". Unlike "Within You Without You" this cut does not attempt to make a mystic love statement about the merging of 
identities; instead, it sings sad to the deep reaches of loneliness as Harrison wails in his Hindu chant "Don't be long" for half the 
tune. The distant, hazy vocal and the images of alienation produce a total effect in the listeners mind. Bounding off this melancholy mood is "Your Mo­ther Should Know", a charming, nostalgic sing-along. Finally. we 
are given the best cut on the album, "I Am the Walrus", which ranks in the lofty category of "A Day in the Life". It is Len­non's poetry at its best. 
The second side is a group of the past releases such as "Straw­berry Fields Forever". Though 
they aren't part of the actual Magical Tour they are done in the same tone and hroad Beatie's manner. From this continuity between first and second sides the album is given a wholeness. And so the Beatles are able to weave their spell about our eyes and ears and give us a universe which we can only sense when the needle has slipped into the spinning groove of the first band of the Magical Mystery Tour.
