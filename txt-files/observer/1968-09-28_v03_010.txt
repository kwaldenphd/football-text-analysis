The Heisman 
It's a bit early to tell exactly who most deserves the 1968 Heisman Trophy. Thus, football writers, coaches and publicity directors currently are forming their battle stragegy. 
Depending on your source, there are anywhere from one to eight L~iadiators in that battle. Alphabetically, they are: 
---Bill Bradley of Texas 
---Brian Dowling of Yale 
---Chris Gilbert of Texas 

---Terry Hanratty of you know where 
---Ted Hendricks of Miami 
---Leroy Keyes of Purdue 
--Ted Kwalick of Penn State 

---OJ. Simpson of Southern Cal. 
Actually, Hanratty, Keyes and Simpson are the only serious 
contenders. That, anyway, is your assumption until you read Bob Pille of the Chicago Sun-Times, who says, "Hardly anybody except Terry Hanratty's relatives and an occasional errant publicity man sees another prime contender (besides Keyes and Simpson)." 
Although Terry disclaims any relation to him, Beano Cook of Football News predicts in a recent column that Hanratty will win the big bronze figure, presented each year by the Downtown Athletic Club of New York. Which is enough to give you second thoughts about Brian Dowling and Chris Gilbert. 
It's kind of like the presidential race, except that the candidates don't make their own speeches. They depend on outsiders for aid in that department, outsiders who, with one exception, are all proponents of the "hard sell." 
The loner of the group is ND sports publicist Roger Valdiserri. 
"You simply don't shove a Heisman Trophy winner down anybody's throat," says Roger. "Right now, Keyes and Simpson are the favorites for the award. Terry (Hanratty) is a contender, because he placed high in the voting the past two years. 
"But the people who vote for the Heisman Trophy are intelligent. They'll vote for a player because of what he does on the field, not because of any publicity I give him or because we have him on the cover of our pre-season football guide," Valdiserri explain_s. 
Indeed, Hanratty is not to be found on the cover of ND's '68 guide. On the inside pages, he rates a little more ink than most Irish players, but nothing extraordinary. 
Contrast that with the USC grid handbook. OJ. scampers off the front cover at you, and in color, no less. On the back cover, he runs a power sweep in black and white while, just above his head, a color banner reads, "All the way with OJ." 
The inside front cover includes four pictures of OJ. and 10 lay-it-on-thick quotes from coaches and writers. Inside the back cover: three more pictures, his complete 1967 statistics and a few paragrapsh which begin, "Two initials-OJ.-became synonymous with collegiate football in one short season." 
Pictorially, Purdue rates Keyes, Mike Phipps and Perry Williams equally. Each makes the cover in addition to a full-page picture inside. But the text is more partial to Leroy. It trumpets, ''This season Keyes should be the Big Ten's first Heism;:tn winner since Ohio State's Howard Cassidy in 1955." 
Hanratty-backer Cook explains Gary Behan's route to the award in 1967. "Vic Kelley, the publicity director of UCLA, was fortunate last year. First Coach Tommy Prothro gave Kelley a catchy phrase for Behan. Prothro called Beban, 'The Great One.' And second, Sports Illustrated, called by some the most influential publication in sports, covered the Tennessee-UCLA game, which was played early in the season. Beban was the hero and was on his way to winning the Heisman Trophy. 
"Little things can make a difference. Making the big play before many writers. Having a super game on television. A nickname. All these add up," Beano says. 
With more than I ,000 writers and broadcasters casting Heisman ballots, the "hard sell" route seems best. Certainly, no more than half the voters will see Keyes, Simpson and Hanratty in person this fall. That leaves only Beano's "little things" to help them make a decision. 
Today's game is the only head-to-head confrontation between top contenders before the balloting in late November. How important is this clash'? Important enough for Purdue coach Jack Mollenkopf to stop poor-mouthing his team's chances in mid-sentence last Tuesday and say, "If they don't give Leroy Keyes the Heisman Trophy after playing both ways against Notre Dame, they ought to blow it up!" 
To which we reply, ''T.H. for the H.T."

Terry, Jim Observe Anniversary 

The record breaking aerial 
artistry of pitcher Terry 
llanratty and catcher Jim 
Seymour had its debut Sept. 24, 
1966, when the University of 
Notre Dame Fighting Irish, led 
by Messrs. llanratty and 
Seymour, surpassed the Purdue 
Boilermakers, 26-14. 
More experienced and poised 
since their premier performance, 
the duct of Mr. Fling and Mr. 
Cling will find a bit of nostalgia 
in this Saturday's Notre Dame­
Purdue skirr1ish here. 
Two years ago on a sunny September afternoon in Notre Dame Stadium, the Baby Bombers, as I he sophomores were christened following I he match, exploded unto the collegiate football scene. In the :;inglc contest, split-end Seymour broke two Irish receiving records and tied another. Quarterback Hanratty completed 16 of 24 flings for t h rce touchdowns and 304 yards. 
After the game Notre Dame coach Ara Parseghian said, "lloth Terry llanratty and Jim Seymour produced beyond my fondest hopes. They showed all of us today just how good they arc." In the Purdue dressing room, Coach Jack Mallcnkopf could only say, "We were,'t prepared for Saymuur. We had no idea how great he was." 
And this was only the beginning. The llanratty-Seymour Show has coni inucd much to the approval of teammates and to the dismay of opponents. 
L.ast Saturday against the Oklahoma Sooners, the scintillating seniors opened their final campaign for the Fighting Irish. Both had been hampered somewhat by injuries and illness during the early fall drills. llowever, for the Oklchoma team of Coach Chuck Fairbanks and the 59,075 spectators assembled in Notre Dame Stadium, the combo looked anything but hampered. 
Sooner mentor Fairbanks commented following the game, "Everybody's been talking about the passing of Terry Hanratty and the receiving of Jim Seymour. They certainly arc exceptional ;>layers. I think they have improved since 1966 when they were sophomores. They 
Ruggers 

Open 
The Notre Dame Rugby Football Club will open it's 1968 season this Sat. against Wheeling College on the rugby field behind Stepan Center. The second team game will begin at 9 p.m., and tbe first team will play at 10 p.m. 
The Irish suffered heavy graduation losses this year, including All-Americans Bill Kenealy and Dick Carrigan. They arc, nonetheiess, optimistic about the coming season. The turnout of new players has been exceptional. Club President Mike Brennan commented, "We probably have the best balance and overall talent in the club's history." 

certainly  have  more  poise.  
expected  them  to  be  hard  to  
stop and  they were  excellent."  

llanratty threw 27 passes, completing 18, two of which were for touckdowns to Seymour. The effort placed llanratty second on the list of all-time Notre Dame hurlers. He needs only four completions to break Ralph Guglielmi's record of 209 set over a four-year perioed between 1951 and 1954. 
Seymour's nine pass receptions, totalling 101 yards and two six-pointers, gained for the lanky split-end the Irish career record ( 14) in touchdown passes caught. He is now the possessor of every Notre Dame pass receiving mark on a career basis. 
Will success spoil the former Baby Bombers who have now matured into the best passing combination in the 80 year football history of the Fighting Irish? 
As Coach Ara Parseghian says, "Getting a big head is a problem for many athletes, but for Hanratty and Seymour it hasn't been a difficulty either in their sophomore or junior seasons. Now that they arc older and more mature, I certainly don't think big-headedness will be a problem for them this year."

Gasser Unawed by Leroy, Purdue 
By JOHN HEINRICH Covering a receiver like Notre Dame's Jim Seymour is hardly a pleasant way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Oklahoma's defensive backs, who struggled u nsuccesfully to contain Seymour and the rest of the Irish recievers last week, can confirm that fact. Then imagine, if you will, how unpleasant it must be to have to cover Seymour not simply for an hour or so some Saturday but for two or three hours every day for three or four months. Surviving such an assignment without succumbing to a nervous breakdown would be a fair accomplishment. This task of being contmually victimized by S.:ymour and batterymate Terry Hanratty was last year nearly the exclusive property of Notre Dame cornerback John Gasser. Gasser came to Notre Dame from Logan Ohio High School. 
WIENER SCHNITZEL CHOICE BREADED VEAL 
He captained his football team 
and won all-state honors during his senior year. He also played basketball and baseball well enough to accumulate nine letters during his high school career. At Notre Dame he became a defensive back and served on the prep team, whose job it is to simulate the offenses and defenses of the week's opponent. 
Gasser's year on the prep squad was not as distasteful as it might sound. "We were like a club and we had a lot of fun," he said. "We ran the other team's defense. I got to cover Seymour a lot and if I got beat, well, I was just a prepper." 
During spring practice, however, coach Paul Shoults began to notice that Gasser was getting beaten less and less. Although he already had a wealth of candidates for the two cornerback spots, Shoults gave Gasser a tryout with the regulars

and he played well enough to be picked to start in the annual spring game. He responded with another fine performance and

when bll practice opened he was a regular at cornerback. 
Gasser's sudden rise from obscurity has not completely eliminated his doubts about his own abilities, however. I asksed him what his thoughts were prior to last week's Oklahoma game. He said, "I had confidence in everyone but myself." He certainly was more complimentary to his mates in the secondary than many writers (this one included) have been. He said he considers this year's linebackers "at least as good as last year's". He called fellow cornerback Ernie Jackson "an natural for the position with his great speed" and termed Tom Quinn "a great safteyman, maybe not as quick as Tom Schoen but otherwise just as good." 
Typically, he credited his fine performance against Oklahoma's potent passing attack to everything but his own efforts. He pointed out that each member of the defensive line had shared in the weekly defensive award because of their tremendous pass rush. He also felt that "Warmack wasn't throwing as well as he could. lie had men open but couldn't hit them." 
His confidence in the Jefensive unit is also reflected in his analysis of their chances against Purdue's offense today. Asked about Leroy Keyes, he commented, "Keyes is grat, but I think we can contain him." Would the return of tight end Marion Griffin pose any additional problems? Gasser replied "It really doesn't matter what the name is. It's just a guy trying to catch the ball." I also asked if Purdue quarterback Mike Phipps would put additional pressure on the secondary running sprintout type plays. He said that the Irish condidered Phipps basically a drop-back passer who runs only when nec;!ssary and would defense him accordingly. 
Although seemingly unimpressed by Purdue's big names, Gasser reflected respect for the overall abilities of its offense and in particular for its versatility. "They have a good basic offense and they execute well, like the Packers," he said, "and they also have a spread offense like the Dallas Cowboys." Gasser is confident, but well aware of the challenge Purdue will provide he and his teammates. 
John Gasser will be beaten on a play occasionally this season. 

• 
But Gasser's experience on I he prep team has taught him what it is to be beat~n. More importantly, his learning and the tutoring of Paul Shoults and John Ray have taught him the pride and sat is fact ion that comes from knowing IIC has not been beaten .

Make AP A Believer 
In preparing for Purdue, we go through the same rout inc that we do for any other team. But you cannot help to feel uneasiness on the field. 
The defense is working hard to come up with a way to stop the Boilermakers' potent offense, which is spearheaded by Leroy Keyes and !Vike Phipps. Notre Dame's offense, showing a very impressive attack against Oklahoma, realizes the goals will be harder to come by against the big and fast Purdue defense. 
Everyone in the country knows the importance of a victory over Purdue. 
Leroy Keyes said this week that he would have no trouble stopping Jim Seymour and, with our young defense, he believes they can outscore our offense. 
I don't think these things can be predicted, unless Leroy knows something that no one else in the country knows. All in all, the Irish are going to have a few surprises for Mr. Keyes and his teammates. 
The Notre Dame football team and, I am sure, the student body will join me today in welcoming back our co-captain Bob Olson. The defense did an excellent job against the Sooners, but it's great to know that we have the best linebacker in the country returning from an injury to call defensive signals. 
The Notre Dame team will never forget the defeat that Purdue handed to us last year. The locker room after the iame is one thing that we do not want to experience again. 
That loss was the first that the Class of '69 had suffered at Notre Dame. Everyone just sat in front of his locker, trying to tell himself we had lost. It was true. We did lose and we had to start all over again. 
This year, Oklahoma was our start and we would like to continue from there. 
The amazing part about playing for Notre Dame is that every year you find yourself playing for the National Championship. Some years you find yourself trying to defend the No. I rating and other years regaining it. In 1966, we regained the title; in 1967 we did not defend it successfully. 
And now in 1968, after one victory, UPI places us No. I ahead of Purdue and AP places us No.2 behind Purdue. Today, we will try to make AP a believer.

Irish All The Way 
NEW YORK liPI Notre Dame to paddle Purdue. 
That's the way I make it and if you care to know why it's because I listen to football coaches the same way I listen to the Pre~idential candidates. Extra carefully. 
I've listened to Jack Mollenkopf, the Purdue coach, and An: Parseghian, Notre Dame's head man, and Mollenkopf was more persuasive. lie convinced me. Not that Purdue was going to win but that Notre Dame wasn't going to lose. From that point I figured the rest out myself. 
Said Mollenkpf: 
"We have to get our share of the breaks against Notre Dame and we can't make anv mistakes. We also have to take away their passing of Ilanratty to Seymour principally, although they throw a lot ·to Winegardner." 
Everybody makes mistakes and well coached as they are, that includes the Boilermakers. I don't think they can go through an entire game without a mistake. Besitks ;ley're playing the game in South Bend and the Irish arc all fired up about last year. 
So my choice is Notre Dame. 
Some of my others arc Florida over Florida State in a head knocking session that could make Notre Dame and Purdue look like the semi-final; Tulane over Texas A&M because the Aggies weren't at all impressive when they were in with LSU, and North Carolina State over Oklahoma because in that low key way of his, Earle Edwards has quietly whipped together an even better ball club than everyone thinks he has.

Penn State over Kansas State -Wildcats arc in too deep in I his 
one. 
Maryland over Syracuse Oops, that'll happen once in a while. 
Pitt over West Virginia Yeah, yeah, I know, I picked 'em over 
UCLA, too. THE MIDWEST Southern CAlifornia Northwcster Northwestern has more depth than usual but not enough to stop the Trojans. SMU over Ohio State Oddsmakers say otherwise, though. THE SOUTH Miami over Georgia Tech I lome court won't make much difference. Clemson over Georgia Frank Howard has his Tigers thinking about nothing else but chewing up Bulldogs. Michigan over Duke could go either way. THE SOUTHWEST Texas over Texas Tech -Longhorns are better than what they showed against llouston. TCU over Iowa Just when the Hawkeyes thought they had something going, too. LSU over Rice -·Tigers' offense is too tough. THE FAR WEST UCLA over Washington State -The UCLA Coach was worried about Pitt so he sure must be in a sweat about Washington State. Stanford over Oregon -Indiana could be the Pacific Coast dark horses. California over Colorado -Although Colorado is capable of turning it around. THE PROS People arc beginning to wonder our loud -is this the beginning of the end for Green Bay? Arc the Packers starting to fade? It was not so much a matter of deterioration on our part as it was a case of ~innesota playing so well," he says. "We didn't play very well. The Vikings did. We certainly hope it isn't the beginning of the end. But there were things wrong with us in that game and several changes will have to be made." The Packers figure to have those changes made by Sunday when they should beat the improved Detroit Lions at Green Bay. Other NFL choices: Dallas over Philadelphia ~ No letup for the Eagles here. Los Angelas over Cleveland -George Allen has my sympathy. He says his front four still has to get in better shape. Minnesota over Chicago -Vikings look for real. Baltimore over Pittsburgh -Johnny Unitas comes home in style. New York over Washington-The Redskins could use a road map. This will be their third straight game away from home and it's obvious they're missing passes as much as good old home cooking. San Francisco over Atlanta -Next time the Falcons beat the 49ers will be the first time. New Orleans over St. louis Cards just don't seem to have the combination. Kansas City over Miami Dolphins seem to be all thumbs every time they go up against the Chiefs. Cincinnati over San Diego And they S<!id it couldn't be dune. Oakland at Houston -Raiders arc rolling up points like they're using an adding machine. New York over Buffalo !3ills still haven't gotten themselves collected.
