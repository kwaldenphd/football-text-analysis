As the 2003 football season draws to a close, Student Activities and "The Shirt" organizers arc beginning their search for a new project presi­dent and are continuing a con­test for original and creative designs that began earlier this month. 
Dave Brenner, president of the 2003 "The Shirt" project, was very pleased with this year's support of the shirt. 
"It was fantastic. It was awe­some to see the strong support from the students because the project is for them," Brenner said. 
Brenner, a Dillon junior, is looking for a president to replace him next year. Student Activities and Brenner are interviewing a dozen appli­cants, the highest number of applicants in the project's histo­ry. 
"There will be a strong presi­dent and hopefully a great shirt design when this contest is fin­ished.... When you have those two elements, it's easy to pro­duce a good shirt and have a successful season," Brenner said. 
The new president of the shirt will begin his or her term after the Thanksgiving holiday.

championship. By interhall football standards, that is Sports Wire a dynasty. And Editor everyone knows most players involved in a dynasty begin asking for outrageously selfish perks like parietal exemptions and catered press box lunches. But yesterday afternoon, these men of Siegfried were not just playing for themselves. They were also playing for their Owner. 
Raymond Siegfried II attendedNotre Dame from 1961 to 1965. He graduat­ed with a bachelor's degree in busiliess administration and in 1969 founded a small business with his father called The Nordam Group. Since then, The Nordam Group has done slightly well, now grossing over $1 billion a year. 
Yeah, slightly well. Ray and his wife Milano also have five children, many of whom followed in his footsteps to Our Lady's University. Yet despite all his individual success, Ray still remains intimately affiliated with the University, sitting on the Board of Trustees and donating generous sums of money. One such donation resulted in the construction of a dorm just north of the library. You don't need to play 20 Questions to figure out which one. 
Sunday afternoon, the Ray Siegfried Ramblers played in the House that Rockne built with the sleeves of their maroon jerseys adorned with the ini­tials RHS. You see, last year Ray was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. For the uninformed, you can't cure this disease with flu shots in the library. You can't cure it with anything. ALS gradually kills off the nerve cells that control muscle function. During this process, the victim's mind remains sharp as a tack, only able to watch as one limb after another becomes use­less and limp. The disease is terminal. 
For the past two years, Ray has been a fixture on the Rambler sidelines, and the players affectionately dubbed him "The Owner." And this owner treats his players like kings. When the Ramblers clinched a Stadium berth in 2001 and 2002, Ray picked up the check after taking the entire team out to dinner. With the gratitude of escaping North Dining Hall, it's no wonder the team has only lost two games in the last three years. 
However, Ray began to make fewer sideline appearances. In about a year's time, ALS had forced him from walking the sidelines to breathing out of a tube. There was no dinner trip this year, but Ray's inspiring email to the team was just as motivational, though less tasty. 
It was all they would need. With "Ray" written on his taped wrists, cor­nerback John Lira helped the Siegfried team follow through with its mission for the season-to Repeat for Ray. With all due respect to the Gipper, this one was for the Owner.

SMC students travel to Washington conference 
By ANGELA SAOUD News Writer 
Sixteen of Professor Claude Henshaw's students went to Washington D.C. last Wednesday for a five-day trip highlighted by the Annual Tax Conference and sponsored by the Tax Foundation. 
"The conference gave the stu­dents the opportunity to see how taxes work," Renshaw said. "It allowed them to see what we have learned in class put into action." 
The conference focused on pre­sentations from representatives in various branches of the govern­ment. and included Treasury Secretary John Snow. 
"It was really exciting to see the students getting into it," Renshaw said. "I think they got a lot out of it, and it was a reinforcement of applications I had talked about in class." 
Saint Mary's students has been invited previously to this confer­ence, but this trip marked the first time they were able to attend. 
Through funding from the Center for Women's InterCultural Leadership, Saint Mary's Board of Governance. the Tax Foundation and independent fundraisers, the trip cost each student less than $200. 
"When I estimated the original budget, it was supposed to be hun­dreds of dollars to attend," Henshaw said. "But this was a real­ly energetic group. They wrote up grants for BOG and CWIL them-

selves and set up the fundraisers on their own. I think that really said something about this group." 
In addition to attending the con­ference, the group also took tours of the U.S. Treasury building, the Capitol building and the White House and met with Saint Mary's alumnae who live in Washington, 
D.C. . 
"It was great to meet with the alumnae," said junior Michelle Cooper. "It was nice to be able to discuss with them what they are now doing with their Saint Mary's degrees." 
During free time, the students, along with Renshaw and his wife, Mary, went on a walking tour of the monuments and attended a play. 
To fundraise, students put up signs around campus to rent them­selves out as accountants. 
"For $10 professors or students could rent a student to do odd jobs like balance checkbooks or do yard work," junior Tricia Michalak said. "The fundraiser helped out in addi­tion to the grants we had already received." 
Overall, the students said the conference was beneficial to their futures. 
"I was able to learn more about politics. tax policy and procedures," junior Risa Zander said. "Tax poli­cies affect our lives more than we think. and now I feel like I know quite a bit more."

University receives science grant 
Special to The Observer 

The National Science Foundation has awarded $10 million to Notre Dame, Michigan State University and the University of Chicago to establish a Physics Frontier Center for Nuclear Astrophysics. 
Known as JINA, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics, the center is a collaborative effort of the three universities. Michael Wiescher, a Notre Dame nuclear astro­physicist and last year's win­ner of the prestigious Bethe Prize of the American Physical Society, will serve as JINA's first director. 
According to Wiescher, the five-year NSF grant is intended to foster an interdisciplinary approach to nuclear astro­physics that seeks to coordi­nate efforts between the astro­physics and nuclear physics communities, as well as those between experimentalists, the­orists and observers. The $10­million grant to JINA comes at a time when new generations of particle accelerators are being built or proposed that will recreate stellar nuclear processes in the laboratory and new earth-and space­based telescopes are leading to astronomical observations that trace past and present nucle­osynthesis processes in the cosmos. .

Council 
continued from page 1 
The Financial Management Board and the Judicial Council would remain autonomous units, reflecting their greater need for impartiality. CCC president Seth O'Donnell said that the CCC should also be a sepa­rate group, citing its duties to allocate student activities funds. "It's impor­tant that we keep CCC independent. It has a huge financial responsibility toward the clubs," he said. 
The Council of Representatives would be retained, though its mem­bership would change. Both vice presidents would have seats on the Council, along with the head of the residential council and representa­tives from the class councils, the CCC, the FMB and the Judicial Council. 
Sarah Keefer, co-chair of the Hall Presidents Council, said significant changes are necessary to allow for high-quality programming and effec­tive policymaking. 
"On the dorm level, there's not a lot of communication between the pro­gramming and policy sides," she said. 
Not all members were as optimistic about the new proposal, however. Student body vice president Jeremy Lao said the mix of elected and appointed officials might create con­flicts. "My main concern is that this is not a truly representative govern­ment," Lao said. 
In other Council of Representatives news:

"It's just a strange situation with 17 people leaving," he said. "We're fortunate that we have what we have." 
Although most 400-level classes were closed after junior and senior registration, Fredman stressed that sopho­mores were in no danger of missing out on requirements. 
He said the English depart­ment structures their courses according to a yearly plan that puts all students on track to earn a degree. 
"The traditions courses, methods courses and surveys that are intended for sopho­mores are still completely open," he said. "[The unavail­ability of electives to sopho­mores] helps reinforce the design that's already there ... Our department is not rigid, and we don't force the prerequisite situation, but the whole purpose of a traditions course is to tell you what's out there -they are not intended to be roadblocks, but to be stepping stones to get you where you need to be before choosing your electives." 
Fredman said sophomores in the major who narrowed their choices to specific electives too quickly were not taking full advantage of the department's diversity. 
"The [elective] courses every­one thinks are most popular are the ones that everyone has heard about," he said. "The tra­ditions course exposes you to your own interest and leads you track often make fair instruc­tion more difficult for profes­sors. 
"It's frustrating for faculty to direct courses meant for sopho­mores when seniors [who took their electives before the required traditions and meth­ods classes] jump back in," he said. "The students get frustrat­ed, as well, because they're learning material that's not on a level they're excited about." 
English professor and Keough Institute director Christopher Fox said he sympathized with students who didn't expect to find certain classes closed so early, but added that the department was still making efforts to accommodate their needs. 
"I am very sorry to hear that students are having trouble," Fox said. "But I do think this is a temporary anomaly." 
Fox said that some of his col­leagues discussed offering class­es in future years strictly for sophomores, and that at least one 300-level class is currently available for first year students. 
Sophomore English majors expressed mixed reactions to registration difficulties. 
"It's not so much about fulfill­ing the requirements, but about taking classes that I'll actually enjoy," Valerie Ralph said. 
Laura MacLean said she was not worried about fitting in the necessary courses because she plans to study abroad but believed the increased competi­tion facing her peers was a result of the growing popularity of the major. 

academics has raised the desire to get into English," MacLean said. 
English is not the only major at the University that has seen a recent upswing. The Department of Anthropology has quadrupled in the past five years, said professor Karen Richman. 
"In a way, you're a victim of your own success," Richman said. "If you become a popular major, your classes will become larger and the quality goes down." 
Richman also said that, despite an expanding faculty, most upper-level courses in the Anthropology department were already closed after senior reg­istration. 
"We've added 17 people [in recent years]." she said. "We keep hiring more people, but we have just a tremendous demand for classes." 
While this demand does not seem likely to die down for either English or anthropology majors, Fredman said he felt confident that registration con­ditions did not pose a perma­nent problem for sophomores. 
"We have to react to the trends," he said. "But our first responsibility is to save slots for the seniors who need the elec­tives to graduate ... ln a way it's better for sophomores to be directed into these first [tradi­tions and methods] courses before wandering into elec­tives."

Marion County sheriff's Lt. Phil Burton said the teen apparently was sticking his head out the window of the bus when he was struck by a tree limb while traveling on the city's south side. 

D.C. sniper convicted of murder 
Muhammad found guilty after six hours of deliberation, could face execution 
Associated Press 

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. ­In a verdict that could cost him his life, a stone­faced John Allen Muhammad was convicted Monday of using a high­powered rifle, a beat-up car and a teenage side­kick to murder people at random and terrorize the Washington area during last year's sniper attacks. 
The jury immediately began hearing evidence on whether the 42-year­old Army veteran should get the death penalty or life in prison. The penalty phase is expected to last several days. 
"We reserve the death penalty for the worst of the worst," prosecutor Richard Conway told the jurors. "Folks, he still sits right in front of you with­out a shred of remorse."

Brenner is optimistic about the design for The Shirt next year. 
"It's my hope to get a large number of designs and have a large set of ideas to choose from.... The record number of design applicants from last year are what made The Shirt so successful. We hope to see the same kind of response this year," Brenner said.

U.S. to provide $2.4 billion to AIDS effort 
Associated Press 
WASHINTON -House­Senate bargainers agreed Monday to provide $2.4 bil­lion this year to combat AIDS and other deadly diseases in Africa and other poor regions. 
The amount is $400 million more than President Bush proposed last February. The administration had defended Bush's request, attacked as inadequate by advocates of an aggressive global fight against AIDS, as all that could be spent effectively now. 
"We see the Congress really defying the president on this by going higher, and that is a very positive trend," said David Bryden, spokesman for the Global AIDS Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group. 
Congressional negotiators also agreed to provide $650 million for Bush's so-called Millennium Challenge Account, the president's plan to give foreign aid to coun­tries trying to make demo­cratic, economic and human rights reforms at home. 
That is half what Bush requested for one of his top foreign policy priorities. Lawmakers and aides, howev­er, said they would try provid­ing extra money later -per­haps in a massive end-of-ses­sion spending measure -to bring the challenge account's total to at least $900 million and perhaps $1 billion. 
Even so, the reduction 
underlines the budget pres­sures lawmakers face from mounting federal deficits, the weak economy and the cost of tax cuts as they try to com­plete overdue spending bills for the federal fiscal year that started Oct. 1. 
Last spring, Congress enact­ed a five-year, $15 billion plan for fighting AIDS and other diseases worldwide that Bush had proposed in his State of the Union address in January. That legislation set up the program, but left the provi­sion of money to future bills. 
The plan called for spending $3 billion a year for prevent­ing and treating AIDS, tuber­culosis and malaria in 14 African and Caribbean coun­tries, with the bulk of the funds to be aimed at AIDS. The effort was supposed to prevent 7 million new infec­tions, provide care for 10 mil­lion HIV-infected people ·and AIDS orphans, and provide therapy for 2 million others. It represents a near-tripling of previous U.S. efforts against AIDS. 
Lawmakers included $1.65 billion for the global AIDS effort in a $17.2 billion for­eign aid bill that House­Senate negotiators tentatively completed late Monday. They hoped to push it through Congress this week. 
An additional $754 million for battling AIDS abroad is to be included in a separate $138 billion measure for this year's health, education and labor programs. 
That health-education legis­lation is likely to be combined with several other unfinished spending measures into an enormous bill financing much of the government. Top law­makers hope that measure will be passed by Congress just before it adjourns for the year, perhaps by the end of this week. 
Bush proposed the Millennium Challenge Account in March 2002 as part of a long-term increase in the foreign assistance pro­gram. He called for $1.3 bil­lion for the account for fiscal 2004, which started Oct. 1, rising to $5 billion for 2006. 
Funds would go to countries meeting standards for good governance, health care, edu­cation and investment cli­mates. 
The bill also would block 
U.S. military and other assis­tance to Nigeria -but not humanitarian aid -unless it cooperates in the surrender of Charles Taylor, the deposed Liberian president who is wanted for trial on crimes against humanity charges. The administration opposes the sanctions, even though they could be suspended under certain conditions. 
The overall bill also has $731 million for combatting drugs in the Andean region of South America, matching Bush's request and about $1.5 million over last year's level.

IN BRIEF 
Inventories rise in Sept. 
WASHINGTON -America's businesses­which have been keeping supplies fairly lean -boosted their stockpiles of unsold goods in September for the first time in six months, a sign that companies may be feeling more con­fident about the economic recovery's staying power. 
The Commerce Department reported Monday that businesses' inventories rose by 
0.3 percent in September, a turnaround from the 0.4 percent drop reported in August. September's rise was the first since March, when businesses also increased their supplies at warehouses and backlots by 0.3 percent. Economists were expecting inventories to be flat in September. 
In another encouraging sign, the increase in inventories in September came even as busi­nesses' sales rose by a solid 0.6 percent, the biggest gain since July. 
Investors flee beleaguered Putnam 
BOSTON -Investors continue to pull money out of embattled Putnam Investments, with assets under management declining by $7 bil­lion in the past week and $21 billion overall since market timing allegations surfaced last month, the company said Monday. 
Putnam reported $256 billion in assets under management as of Friday. A week earli­er, it had $263 billion under management. At the end of October, the company had $277 bil­lion under management. A Putnam spokes­woman did not return a call seeking comment on the fund levels, which were reported in a filing by Marsh & McLennan Cos., Putnam's parent company, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Morgan Stanley settles accusations 
NEW YORK-Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a $50 million fine to settle charges that it pushed investors toward certain mutual funds in order to gain millions more in commissions and did not disclose the incentives to clients. 
Morgan Stanley is the second major finan­cial company to settle with regulators in a widening mutual fund industry scandal that has stained a growing list of firms and dis­mayed many investors. 


Markets fall on terror worries

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -New fears of terrorism sent stock mar­kets tumbling around the world Monday and extend­ed Wall Street's sellofT into a second week. 
U.S. investors reacted to market declines in Japan and Europe following reports that the al-Qaida terrorist network had claimed responsibility for weekend attacks in Turkey and named Japan and other U.S. allies as potential targets. But analysts said some of Wall Street's slide was due to normal profit taking. 
The Dow Jones industri­als fell more than 130 points before regaining ground late in the session. The declines came despite a better-than-expected report on business inventories and news that several compa­nies were in merger talks, which often gives the mar­ket a boost.

Travelers, St. Paul Cos. to merge 
Associated Press 

MINNEAPOLIS Travelers Property Casualty Corp. is combining with The St. Paul Companies Inc. in a $16 billion stock deal that will create one the nation's biggest business insurers, the companies announced Monday. 
The new company will be known as The St. Paul Travelers Companies and is expected to have total assets of $107 billion, the companies said. 
Company officials said the deal would create the nation's second largest commercial insurer behind American International Group, pro­viding policies for commercial liabili­ty, commercial property and workers' compensation. It should also expand the companies' geographic reach. 
The company will have its corpo­rate headquarters in St. Paul, Minn. But the commercial lines of the com­bined company will be consolidated under the Travelers brand and will be based in Hartford, Conn. 
St. Paul's chairman and chief exec­utive, Jay S. Fishman, will be the chief executive of the combined com­pany. Robert I. Lipp, chairman and chief executive of Travelers, will be the company's executive chairman until Jan. 1. 2006, when he is to become chairman and chief execu­tive, the company said. 
Travelers spokesman Keith Anderson said no layoffs are 
planned. The company, based in Hartford, was spun off from New York financial services giant Citigroup last year and employs 5,800 people in the greater Hartford area. 
"When we look at our total employ­ment base here in the Hartford area, we see that rising," Anderson said. 
Under the terms of the proposed agreement, Travelers shareholders would receive 0.4334 shares of St. Paul stock for each share of Travelers stock. That was worth about $15.94 at Friday's closing price of $36.77 for St. Paul stock. Travelers A shares closed at $16.03 a share on Friday and its B shares closed at $16.06 a share.

Isolation nation 

Whether from the puppets of mass media, the pages of elementary school textbooks or the White House press room, Americans have been and are being fed an outrageous lie: the myth of individ­ualism. This Kamaria Porter myth takes vari­ous forms and assumes many Breaking the guises, yet all its Habit manifestations converge to one desired result: the sustained power for the ruling classes. 
The myth of individualism runs rampant and undetected in popular culture as the seemingly innocuous story of the American dream. In movies, television shows and litera­ture, we find uplifting stories about how some poor wretch rose above his or her circumstances armed only with the tools of industry and persistence. 
Take the show "Biography" on A&E. It parades as a serious mini-docu­mentary-show when, actually, it uplifts the exceptional class -CEOs, movie stars and millionaires. Every night, Americans tune in to this and other programs and swallow huge portions of the "rags to riches" abstraction. 

Additionally, this myth demonizes the poor and unemployed as lazy handout-grubbers who are not pulling their weight in society. Indoctrinated with lies, the "haves" view the "have­nots" with hardened hearts and dis­dain, while they continue accumulat­ing wealth and possessions. 
Due to this pervading lie, people are also duped into believing class, race and gender issues are negligible. The ruling class gets away with containing people of color in hazardous urban areas filled with pollution, paying women Jess for their labor, and rewarding themselves with fiscal poli­cies to boost business and its leaders. 
From a young age, elitist historical biases indoctrinate Americans into false individualistic ideology. Not only are certain events and communities completely absent from history books, but writers distort and manipulate the past in order to perpetuate indi­vidualist themes. Important historical movements are whittled down to the experience of one or two people and diverse groups are presented as static and monolithic. Take any mainstream presentation of African-American or Asian-American history. If their tri­umphs and struggles receive any attention, it is minimal and showcases homogeneous images. 
Remember when George W. Bush and company marketed the Iraq war to us? It seemed as though, aside from the ambiguous evildoers lurking everywhere, Saddam Hussein was the only person in Iraq. This slimming down of an entire country to one tar­get seems to make bombing it not so bad. 
Politicians love the myth of individ­ualism. Their rhetoric continually plays off the American dream fabrica­tion to keep the working poor and financially destitute ignorant of the systemic causes ruining their lives, uses isolating language to make war sound benign and objectifies entire communities -global and local -to create and sustain blind support for the current U.S. regime. 
The worst consequence of this myth is that it discourages and marginal­izes the use of collective action to effect social change. The media and education sources hide and spin the injustices of our world; thus, appro­priate outrage is absent. 
People feel their only power exists in an isolated vacuum and refuse to collaborate or organize with like­minded folks enduring the same chal­lenges. 
Unions and worker groups have become suspect in the current American imagination. Plus, people who exercise their most important rights by protesting injustice created by the ruling classes get classified as traitors. · 

Basically, the masses feel organiz­ing is dead and useless. 
Yet we could not be more wrong. How do you suppose the wealthy and powerful maintain and increase their spheres of influence? By organizing. Remember the 2000 election when Bush relied on his friends and family to steal the presidency through the courts? Or how companies concen­trate power over the media in the hands of the few? 
I don't even need to mention the trade agreements NAFTA and FTAA, elite organizing at its finest. FTAA ­Free Trade Area of the Americas ­allows deregulation, environmental endangerment and loss of laborer rights to expand from three to 34 countries in the Western Hemisphere. Parading as a positive global initia­tive, the policy will increase economic disparities and make investors and business owners in participating nations richer. That's right; the ruling classes tell us that organizing will not improve our society-when it will ­while they perversely use collective tactics to keep each other in power. 
Look to the past or the present­organizing is the key. Individual action will not allow for change on a mass scale. See a problem, join or start a movement to raise awareness. Stop looking for another Gandhi or Dr. King. Beyond being advocates of justice and non-violence, these men -like most effective leaders -were master coalition-builders and organ­izers. Let's reclaim our traditions of mobilizing for change from the elite and rededicate organizing to the pur­suit of equity.

Support cross country teams 
Big East Champions. Great Lakes Regional Champions. These are some of the accomplishments of the Notre Dame women's cross country team so far this year, as we go into the NCAA Championship meet next Monday. Where's the support? Where's the coverage for one of the highest-ranked teams on campus? 
On Oct.. 31, the Irish women won the Big East Championship meet for only the second time in the pro­gram's history, and the men finished second for the com­bined highest placing of the two teams ever. The following Monday, there was a two-page foldout on how badly the foot­ball team lost to Florida State, but only a small article on the Irish cross country teams, lost somewhere in the sports sec­tion. 
Why not show some support to the Irish teams that are representing this University like champions? Winning the Big East is a huge deal, as evidenced by yesterday's front-page coverage of the men's and women's soccer teams in their tournaments for the title. 
This past Saturday, Nov. 15, the women's cross country team won the Great Lakes Regional meet, again for only the second time in the program's history. We secured an auto­matic bid to the NCAA championship, one of only 31 out of the 214 Division I teams in the country to proceed to this level. Again, there was not even a picture in the paper. Interhall football was on the front page. 
I'm sorry, but that's bull. Show some support, let the cam­pus know, so they can be proud of their nationally ranked team.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Marshmallow policy excessively harsh 
I am writing in regard to the enforcement of the marshmal­low-throwing policy within the Stadium. During the BYU game, many students brought bags of marshmallows into the Stadium, which has been obvi­ously against the Stadium rules since the beginning of the sea­son, and a few of these smug­glers were ejected from the game-fine. 
Other students were ejected, and in some situations escorted out in handcuffs (obviously nec­essary), for throwing these same marshmallows. Yes, throwing things, even the delectably flavorful products from Jet-Puff, can be very dan­gerous -point taken. However, for the BYU game it seems that the policy abruptly became more serious. now calling for the ejection of any person seen in possession of even a single marshmallow. 
Unfortunately, just before half-time I was in possession of one of these fluffy treats for a few seconds too long after being pelted by one and remov­ing it from my jacket. Before I knew it, I was being given an ultimatum by Mr. Roberto Escobedo (usher #1 000) and his section 29 platoon: Either leave on your own, or be dragged out by police. 

First of all, when did posses­sion of a single marshmallow become an offense punishable by ejection from the game (not to mention the last home game that I will ever attend as a stu­dent)? Secondly, why is it appropriate for ushers to treat cooperative marshmallow-tot­ing students like hardened criminals? When did the policy change from punishing throw­ers of marshmallows to punish­ing those who are eating them or picking them off of their clothes? 
Yes, the season is over, but this issue goes beyond marsh­mallows at football games. How can Cappy Gagnon and his bat­talion of Stadium ushers claim that they are looking out for the best interests of student atten­dees if their policies are so vague and sporadically enforced? 
Mr. Gagnon, make your poli­cies clear and enforce them accordingly. 
Mr. Escobedo, if you stop treating students like convicted felons, then that respect will be reciprocated and all of our lives will be a lot less frustrating.

that the col­lege itself plays a larger role in one's education. 
No doubt both factors influence one's experience, so I wondered, "What would life have been like had I gone to Oxford, instead of Notre Dame?" Though I have been here only a month, allow me to shed some light on the question. 
Dorms; It's Gotta Be the Dorms: 
The most noticeable difference between the two Universities is the resi­dential atmosphere. Here, each student is allotted a single -no freshman "closet" triples or elaborate loft schemes. Also, students are more dis­persed, about 20 to a house. throughout the college campus. The benefits of this set-up are obvious: more living space, more privacy, one's own bathroom and shower. 
However, I believe that Notre Dame has something special in its dorm tradi­tions. Even though the rooms are cramped, and the halls smell, and the parietals are, well. parietals, I would never have met my future friends with­out being thrown together by random assignment, or luck, or grace. Life at Notre Dame revolves around the dorms: We party together, we study together, we eat, sleep and live together. Here at Oxford, life feels more insular, more isolated; even being a part of the foot­ball (soccer) team and a singer in the lay college choir does not begin to com­pare with the community fostered under the Dome. 

Ars Gratia Artis: 
One of the perks of an Oxford education is the availability of high cul­ture. Two weeks ago, the other Domers and I trekked to Stratford­upon-Avon to witness a performance of Richard III by the Royal Shakespeare Company. The per­formance was pol­ished and profes­sional, the sets and lighting were clever, the setting was orig­inal (late 19th centu­ry) and the actors convincingly dis­played a wide range of emotion, from Richard's morbid lust to Margaret's frenzied ranti­ng. We will definitely be returning. 
Also. New College is blessed to host one of the world's premier boy choirs, the aptly named New College Choir. Being the choral music junkie that I am, I attended their recent per­formance of Durufle's setting of the Requiem Mass. Listening to their pleas for mercy in Latin, the counter-tenors and boys reaching as high as any soprano while the basses growled underneath was a moving and powerful experience. I felt as if I, too, had lost a loved one, and were begging for the release of her soul. There are concerts and plays performed throughout Oxford every day; the lack of the arts at Notre Dame is certainly one of its most glar­
ing deficiencies (though the new Performing Arts center will no doubt help). 
Think, McFiy, Think: 
This is probably the first column in which I am actually qualified to make a subjective 
judgment about Oxford's academics. My verdict? 
Academics here at Oxford are compa­rable to those at Notre Dame (no better, no worse). I must be careful the 
tutorial system is not as well suited to mathematics as it is for, say, philosophy, and since I have been enrolled only in math courses, I shouldn't definitively judge the Oxford system. However, for undergraduate science, the 

two Universities are equivalent. For arts and letters, I believe that the work load here is slightly harder. but that the graders are slightly more lenient. (Though I will be able to give a better account once I start Jurisprudence next term.) 
Keepln' the Faith: 
I chose to attend Notre Dame for many reasons; one of the most impor­tant for me was a vibrant faith life. At Oxford, by and large, faith is not as 
central to students' lives. I read a 
recent article in the school newspaper explaining why, explaining how 
younger people have no need for faith, 
how we are more skeptical, etc. But there is also a greater faith diversity 
here than back at home. 
One example: A New College student and I were chatting after Hall, when the topic of faith came up. He happened to be a devout Anglican, and asked me why Catholics prayed the Hail Mary. So I recited the prayer to him in Latin (he's a Classics major) and we went over the prayer line by line, all under the watch­ful gaze of the Virgin Mary, whose stat­ue happened to be hanging over the quad. (New College was founded Catholic.) Wouldn't happen at Notre Dame, or at least, such a situation is more unlikely. I enjoy the diversity of opinions here; part of the study abroad experience is being exposed to people from different ideological backgrounds. 
So, how different would life be had I attended Oxford? A lot. But the experi­ence wouldn't be better or worse than that at Notre Dame, merely different. So Domers, enjoy what is great about Notre Dame. Enjoy its unique balance of academics, athletics, residence life and faith. I'll be here enjoying what's great about Oxford: its tutorials, its tra­dition, its sophistication. That, and the free drinks after football games.

DVD REVIEW 
HBO delivers simplistic DVD set 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN 
Scene Movie Critic 
Love it or hate it. Sex and the City is an undeniably popular and culturally influential show. Look at any trend in fashion, and you can trace its roots to Sex and the City, and the same is invariably true of trends in all forms of recreation. To put it in no vague terms, the show is a product-placement para­dise. The show's appeal has been somewhat narrowed due to the fact that it is on HBO and not network tele­vision. but with its release on DVD, the show will continue to grow in populari­ty and reach an even broader audi­ence. The newly-released Season Four will be the focus of this article. but Seasons One through Three are also available to be purchased on DVD. 
Sex and the City follows four single women through the relationship rat race in New York City, each with a very different personality but none immune to bad dates or emotional ups-and­downs. Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker). a shoe-obsessed sex columnist. anchors the show's action, but the show gives equal time to her three best friends -Charlotte. Miranda and Samantha -as well. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is an art gallery manager who is a misty-eyed romantic at heart; Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is a lawyer who tries to recon­cile her need for independence with the dependency called for in relation­ships; Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is a man-eating sensualist who eschews the idea of marriage and embraces a very liberal view of sex. 

In the fourth season, the four women encounter imposing and challenging issues, but, as is the show's trademark, they are handled with the utmost comic grace and emotional sensitivity. Carrie must come to terms with attempting to move in with her boyfriend, Aidan, while still holding onto her independence, while Charlotte must grapple with getting back togeth­er with her husband and coming to terms with how much having a baby means to her. Samantha, the steadfast single, falls in love and wrestles with what love can do to a person. Miranda 
deals with losing her mother, and she must cope with getting unex­pectedly pregnant and raising a child as a sin­gle parent while main­taining a career. 
The DVD set is com­posed of three discs, each with six episodes. The set is very simple and easy to navigate, but simplicity is also one of the weaker points of the set. Aside from three episodes on the third disc with director commentary and a list of episodes and awards, the set has no extras. There is a link to the HBO website, and it has some extras but nothing out of the ordinary, though the trivia game is fun. There is no "play all" feature, so one has to press play to watch each indi­vidual episode. A description pops up when "play" is hit, so "play" has to be hit once more, which gets a bit mad­dening after a few episodes. Another annoyance is the fact that the opening credits cannot be skipped. 

The discs are played in Dolby 2.0 sound, and the dialogue-heavy episodes benefit from the clear audio quality. The color on all of the discs is bright and clear -a definite benefit for watching the vibrant and extrava­gant wardrobe of the show's women. 
Overall, the DVD adds little to Sex and the City, and it really leaves view­ers wanting more. It's great to be able to watch the show without subscribing to HBO, but it would add to the viewing experience if some extras. such as interviews with writers or cast mem­bers, were included. The DVD adds so little to the show that. if you've seen the show already. there's nothing to be gained by actually buying the season on DVD. The show has such a massive following and such a huge impact on popular culture that it really is too bad that nothing is added to this season's DVD release.

Pixar reels in the big fish

comment on the negotiations with BVHE, industry sources say that home video results for Nemo could sway the decision regarding a renewal with Disney. 
BVHE is under a great deal of pres­sure to have Nemo become the best-sell­ing DVD of all time, meaning that the two-disc collector's edition would have to top the likes of DreamWorks' Shrek, Warner Home Video's Harry Potter films and New Line Home Entertainment's Lord ofthe Rings series. 
"Finding Nemo has generated a great deal of interest, and the volume of bonus material on the second disc, I believe, will make this the best-selling title of the year on DVD," BVHE presi­dent Robert Chapek said. 
Pixar's partnership with Disney has always attracted top talent to its proj­ects, such as Tom Hanks in Toy Story, John Goodman and Billy Crystal in Monsters, Inc. and now Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres in Nemo. 
"I don't know anything about the poli­tics between Disney and Pixar or DVD and VHS," Brooks said. "All I know is what I've always known: It's always about the movie. It's all whether the movie is good or not. And in this case, I believe that the creators did an excep­tional job from beginning to end, and the extras on the DVD are actually spe­cial. They made a real effort to give the viewer more. 
"I have never been much for putting together a whole lot of extra material on a DVD," he said. "I look at a movie as

Heartfelt sorrow, uncontrollable laughter. genuine surprise and utter joy. The quest to find the adorable clownfish Nemo guarantees to invoke u rollercoaster ride of emotions in viewers of' all ages. 
Within the opening minutes, Pixar's spectacular underwater animation assures yet another blockbuster hit for Disney. Moreover, it is virtually impos­sible not to fall in love with the ener­getic and determined Nemo, hindered by his impaired tiny fin. 
As if the high-quality animation and delightful main character are not enough, the marine life voices further intensify Finding Nemo's appeal. Nine­year-old Alexander Gould effortlessly portrays the boyish voice of Nemo himself. Albert Brooks articulates Marlin, Nemo's overprotective and worrisome father, with ease. A hilari­ous addition to the cast is Ellen DeGeneres, who flawlessly depicts the extremely forgetful Dory, a blue tang.

Finding Nemo is the catch of the day at video stores. 
The animated tale sold a record 8 mil­lion DVD and VHS copies in its first day Tuesday, breaking the previous high of 7 million set last year by Spider-Man, according to Finding Nemo partners Disney and Pixar Animation. 
"The studio shipped 25 million copies but already has ordered more, figuring some stores might run out as early as this weekend," said Bob Chapek, presi­dent of Disney home entertainment. 
"We saw stores yesterday almost going through their inventory on day one alone," Chapek said. 
DVDs accounted for about 90 percent of sales. Total sales for Finding Nemo could rival the 32 million VHS copies that Disney's The Lion King sold in its initial video release in the 1990s, Chapek said. 
The numbers will be a key to whether Pixar decides to renew its distribution contract with the Walt Disney Co.'s Buena Vista Home Entertainment, which comes to term in 2005. 
The five movies Pixar has produced for Disney since the mid-'90s -Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, Monsters. Inc. and Nemo -have com­bined to gross about $1.2 billion at the domestic box ollice alone. 
As their deal nears expiration, Pixar has had discussions with several other major studios. While Jobs has refused to Bruce (Barry Humphries), Nigel the helpful pelican (Geoffrey Rush), the surfer turtle Crush (Andrew Stanton), the battle-scared Gill (Willem Dafoe). and Bloat the blowfish (Brad Garrett). Overall. Disney's animation team hand-selected a brilliant cast who generated authentic life within the characters of Finding Nemo. 
Quirky comments and hilarious scenes abound in this Disney/Pixar creation. Topping my list of favorites include two unforgettable moments involving three looming sharks and a mirage of sea turtles. 
Just as it seems imminent that Marlin and Dory are doomed to become the next shark snack, the great white Bruce surprisingly wel­comes the pair into a type of hidden fortress. There, a spin on an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting ensues. Bruce approaches the stand and proudly confesses, "It has been three weeks since my last fish." Within this scene, the shark three­some repeats the following mantra: "Fish are friends, not food." A fright­ening incident soon follows in which Marlin and Dory escape from the blood-hungry Bruce and continue 
towards their destina­tion of Sydney to find Nemo. 
After escaping from the sharks and bound­ing through a swarm of jellyfish, Marlin and Dory find themselves riding the East Atlantic Current with a multi­tude of laid-back sea turtles. Marlin is quick­ly greeted by one sea turtle, in particular,

who tranquilly proclaims, "Dude, Mr. Turtle is my father; the name's Crush." In this scene, the sea turtles, young and old alike, add surfer humor with repeated phrases such as "sweet," "totally rocked," "righteous" and "coo coo ca choo." 
The box office tallies further indi­cate the success of Finding Nemo. To date, the film remains unsurpassable as the top movie released in 2003. During its debut weekend in May, Finding Nemo grossed over $70 mil­lion. If that is not impressive enough, its worldwide box office total current­ly amounts to close to half a billion dollars. 
And wait ... there's more. Among the top movies of 2003, Finding Nemo rises above such smash hits as Pirates of the Caribbean, Matrix Reloaded, Bruce Almighty and X2 to round out the top five. 
The DVD bonus features make Finding Nemo a must-see spectacle. These features include a documentary on the making of the movie, virtual commentary, design galleries and vir­tual aquariums. Particularly, the docu­mentary piece is quite fascinating. This section provides behind-the­scene footage about the collaborative process among writers, editors, direc­tors, designers, sculptors and anima­tors to create the final version of 
Finding Nemo. 
The enjoyable characters, remark­able animation and astronomical box office totals are promises that viewers of any age will fall in love with Finding Nemo. All in all, I highly rec­ommend Disney's uplifting tale of fish life in the crystal blue ocean depths.

kind of a magic trick, and so I never liked revealing how everything was done. I used to say that you take every­thing from the cutting room floor and throw it together as 'extras' and then you've got a DVD. But these guys really made a special effort to bring something more to the DVD, the Jean-Michael Cousteau documentary about the Great Barrier Reef, for example, is a whole work in and of itself." 
Nemo writer-director Andrew Stanton. who has played major roles in all five Disney-Pixar titles, said he wanted to create a narrative using the main char­acters voiced by Brooks and DeGeneres to guide viewers through the bonus materials and, especially, the Cousteau short film. 
"I wanted to make viewing the extras on the DVD an extension of viewing the movie itself," Stanton said.

Nowitzki leads 3rd quarter rally in Mavs' win 
Associated Press 
DALLAS -Dirk Nowitzki overcame a slow start to ener­gize a third-quarter rally, and Steve Nash had his first career triple-double to lead the Dallas Mavericks past the Portland Trail Blazers 105-98. 
Nowitzki, who made his first two shots and then went more than 27 minutes without scoring again, had 20 points and eight rebounds. Nash had 14 points, 12 assists and a career-high 10 rebounds, the final one coming in the closing seconds and drawing a loud roar from fans. 
Rasheed Wallace scored 31 points and eight rebounds, and Zach Randolph had 26 points, 19 rebounds and six assists, but it wasn't enough to keep Portland from falling to 0-4 on the road. 
The fin~t meeting between the Mavericks and Blazers since their seesaw playoff series last spring rekindled some of the same emotions and drama, even if both teams have changed front-line players since then. 
Dallas won the first three games of the postseason, then lost the next three. In jeopardy of becoming the first team to lose a seven-game series after being up 3-0, the Mavs won Game 7 and went on to reach the Western Conference finals. 
This time, Dallas was in con­trol early, then Portland opened the second half by hitting six of seven shots to go ahead 67-53 midway through the third. Nowitzki was on the bench, hav­ing missed six straighl shots since making his first two and looking out of sync. 

Three straight 3-pointers ­two by Nash, one by Michael Finley -got the Mavs and the crowd going. Then Nowitzki returned, giving Dallas its five best scorers on the court togeth­er, and he scored right away. 
The Mavs' all-offense lineup tied the game at 71 and finished the quarter up by three. The Blazers got a 3-pointer from Matt Carroll and a three-point play from Wallace to go up by three, but Dallas answered with an 8-0 run to go ahead for good. Nowitzki ended that spurt with a jumper and two free throws. 
Knlcks 89, Celtlcs 86 
Michael Doleac scored the Knicks' final four points and grabbed eight of his nine rebounds while playing the entire fourth quarter, helping New York defeat the Boston Celtics 89-86. 
Doleac, subbing for starting center Dikembe Mutombo, made up for his two turnovers and a missed open jumper earlier in the fourth by hitting the Knicks' final shot from the field with 
1:55 left. Doleac's two free throws with 
5.4 seconds remaining provided the final margin. Paul Pierce missed an off-balance 3-pointer on Boston's last possession. 
The win was only the third of the season for the Knicks, who got 26 points from Allan Houston and 21 from Keith Van Horn -13 in the third quarter when the Knicks made up most of a big deficit. 
Kurt Thomas added 12 points and 17 rebounds, and Howard Eisley had nine assists. New York snapped its eight-game los­ing streak to the Celtics. 
Vin Baker led Boston with 20 points, and Pierce and Eric Williams added 17 each. 
After trailing by as many as 17 in the first half, the Knicks came back and finally took their first lead since the first quarter, 85-84, on a 3-pointer and a turnaround by Houston with 3:46left. 
After a timeout, the Celtics went for a quick 3-pointer off the inbounds pass but Pierce's attempt rolled around and out. 
Boston had to foul twice to send the Knicks to the line, and there were only 5.4 seconds remaining when Doleac went to the line and calmly sank both shots. 
Wizards 106, Hawks 97 
Jarvis Hayes keyed a fourth­quarter run with a go-ahead 3­pointer and the Washington Wizards snapped a four-game losing streak with a 106-97 vic­tory over the Atlanta Hawks. 
Larry Hughes led the Wizards with 26 points, and Gilbert Arenas added 23. Washington outscored the Hawks 30-19 down the stretch, started by the 3 from Hayes. 
Hayes, who played for two years at Georgia, rebounded from a shaky start to finish with 16 points. He has started every game in place of Jerry Stackhouse, who's out indefi­nitely after having knee surgery before the season. 
Jason Terry had 25 for Atlanta, which lost for the third time in four games, including two in a row at home. Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 20. 
A jumper by Jacque Vaughn gave the Hawks their last lead at 78-76 midway through the fourth quarter, but they went on a three-minute dry spell. 
After Jared Jeffries made a free throw to cut the margin to one, Hayes nailed a jumper from behind the arc, giving the Wizards the lead for good. 
Arenas later boosted the lead to eight with a layup, and he was fouled on the play. He missed the free throw, but Etan Thomas grabbed the carom and laid it in for a 10-point advan­tage. 
Hayes had a rough time in the first quarter, finishing 1-for-8. He got his shot blocked by Theo Ratliff just 38 seconds in -one of six blocks for Ratliff -and also made one turnover. 

Rockets 74, 76ers 66 

Cuttino Mobley scored 19 points, and Yao Ming and Jim Jackson each added 12 to lead the Houston Rockets to a 7 4-66 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. 
The Rockets, who won for the seventh time in nine games, took a lead late in the first quar­ter and never trailed again. They led by as many as 15 in the fourth. 
The Rockets shot only 33 per­cent, but the Sixers were even worse at 32 percent. Houston went 9-for-28 from 3-point range, while the Sixers missed all nine attempts. 
Both teams were awful in the third quarter, when the Sixers went 2-for-18 from the floor and Houston 5-for-24. 
The fans who come out from the crowd to shoot during those silly timeout promotions were more on target than anyone paid to play. 
Allen Iverson scored 15 points and Marc Jackson had 12 for the Sixers, who had their lowest point total of the season. 
Last season, Houston limited Iverson to 9.5 points per game, his lowest total against any opponent. Iverson didn't fare any better this time, with a 4­for-19 effort for his lowest point total of the season. 
Iverson went nearly 19 min­utes between baskets, including an 0-for-4 effort in the third quarter. He grabbed a loose ball rebound and sank a fadeaway jumper to make it 62-53, fol­lowed by a basket by Willie Green. as the Sixers cut it to seven midway through the fourth.

NFL Owens shines in 49ers' Monday night victory 
Associated Press 
SAN FHANCISCO -His catches were beautiful. His blocking was gritty. Terrell Owens thrived in the spot­light again -and he even kept his pens in his socks. 
Owens had a 61-yard touchdown catch among his eight receptions for 155 yards, and Tim Rattay went 21-of-27 for 254 yards in the 49ers' 30-14 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday night. 
llclped by two downfield blocks by Owens, Kevan Barlow rushed for a 78-yard scorn in the third quarter to break open San Francisco's fourth straight home victory. 
Fullback Fred Beasley also caught a 28-yard touchdown pass from Hattay, who added more spice to the 49ers' quarterback controversy with a second straight near-flaw­less performance in place of injured Pro Bowler Jeff Garcia. Former Steelers kick­er Todd Peterson also made three field goals. 
In the teams' first meeting since a rain-soaked game at Candlestick in 1999, San Francisco (5-5) dominated the matchup of defending division champions who have struggled so far this season. 
Tommy Maddox was 25-of­44 for 327 yards for Pittsburgh (3-7). which lost its sixth in seven games thanks to key defensive errors and Antwaan Randle El's fumble on a kickoff return, which allowed San Francisco to score two touch­downs in 14 seconds.

The NFL isn't the only pro league taking a fresh look at steroid use since THG was first detected this summer. Baseball, which will begin punishing players for steroid use next season, recently added THG to its list of banned substances. 
None of Oakland's players was available Monday. The Raiders got their first Monday off of the season, following a 28-18 win over the Minnesota Vikings, and reporters were barred from the locker room.

Those four Raiders became the first non-track and field athletes to appear. Dozens of other athletes have been sub­poenaed to testify, ranging from baseball's Barry Bonds to boxer Shane Mosley. 
An attorney for BALCO founder Victor Conte has said his client is a target of the -grand jury probe, which is believed to be looking into tax and drug issues. 
Conte has been accused by a 
U.S. Anti-Doping Agency offi­cial of supplying athletes with THG, but has denied that. 
On Monday, an attorney for Greg Anderson, a personal trainer for Bonds and other professional athletes, con­firmed his client also is a tar­get of the grand jury probe. Attorney Bill Rapoport said he does not know the nature of the accusations against Anderson. 
Internal Hevenue Service agents and other law enforce­ment officials raided Anderson's home on Sept. 5, two days after a raid on BALCO. Hapoport said items were taken from Anderson's home but he wouldn't elabo­rate. 
Hapoport said Anderson's only connection to Conte is as a customer, purchasing vita­mins to give or sell to the ath­letes he trained. 
Bonds is scheduled to appear Dec. 4 before the grand jury. His attorney, Mike Hains, has said he has been told Bonds is not a target of the probe.

Kasten 

restgns as Atlanta's president 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Stan Kasten left his job Monday as president of Atlanta's Braves, Hawks and Thrashers amid the decision by corporate owner Time Warner to sell the teams. 
·Kasten said he might offer to return to management of the Hawks and Thrashers once a pending deal was approved. He said he decided to leave now because of major changes going on within the teams' organizations, including likely payroll cuts by the Braves. 
"It was the whole package of things all at once. I just felt this was a real convenient time for me to make this move," he said. 
A group led by Boston busi­nessman Steve Belkin reached a deal in September to pur­chase the Hawks, Thrashers and Philips Arena for $250 million. The deal is expected to be approved within the next month. 
Meanwhile, the sale of the Braves has been put on the backburner by Time Warner. 
Belkin said he welcomed Kasten's availability. 
"Clearly he would be a seri­ous candidate because of his experience and knowledge. This frees us up to at least talk about it," Belkin said Monday. 
Kasten, 51, was perhaps the most powerful figure in Atlanta sports, the man who oversaw three of the city's four major sports teams. 
It all grew out of a chance meeting with former Braves owner Ted Turner at a base­ball game in St. Louis in 1976. 
Shortly after his graduation from law school, Kasten was appointed legal counsel of the Braves and Hawks. One year later, he was named assistant general manager of the Hawks. 
In 1979, Kasten became the youngest general manager in NBA history at 27. 
Additional duties came in 1986 when Turner named Kasten as president of the Braves and Hawks. 
Kasten surrendered the GM 
position with the Hawks in 
1990, hiring Pete Babcock. But 
he became involved with the 
company's third sports team in 
1999, taking over as president 
of the Thrashers when Harvey 
Schiller left. 
By that time, Turner was los­
ing his grip on the teams. His 
role lessened when TBS 
merged with Time Warner, and 
he was forced out altogether 
after a merger with AOL.

Huskies overcome 1st half deficit in win 
Associated Press 
STORRS. Conn. Connecticut needed 20 minutes to start looking like the No. 1 team in the country. 
The Huskies rallied from a three-point halftime deficit to beat Yale 70-60 Monday night in the opening round of the Preseason NIT. 
It was better than the last time Connecticut was a presea­son No. 1. The Huskies opened the 1999-00 season with a 70­68 loss to Iowa in the Coaches vs. Cancer Classic. 

The undermanned Bulldogs used a patient offense to spread the floor and keep the Huskies from getting out on the break. 
That changed in the second half as the Huskies used a 14-2 run to take a 48-37 lead and they went on to lead by as many as 17 before struggling at the free-throw line over the final4 112 minutes. 
Emeka Okafor, the AP's pre­season player of the year, had 21 points and 13 rebounds to lead Connecticut, which will host the winner of the first­round game between Vermont and Nevada in the second round on Wednesday night. 
Denham Brown had 15 points and Ben Gordon added 13 and six assists for the Huskies. who took the lead for good at 36-35 with 17:13 left on a fast-break dunk by freshman Josh Boone. In addition to getting on the break, Connecticut turned up the pressure defense as well. 
Yale, which was playing a No. 1 team for the first time in school history, committed just three turnovers in taking the 31-28 halftime lead. They com­mitted six turnovers in the opening five minutes of the sec­ond half and the Huskies were turning most of those into easy baskets. 
Dominick Martin and Edwin Draughn each had 14 points for Yale, which lost its 12th straight season opener.

Seniors eager to leave their tnark at Purdue 
Associated Press 
WEST lAFAYETTE, Ind. -It was a long, intense offseason for the Purdue Boilermakers. 
Exhaustive conditioning drills. Pressure-packed scrimmages. Gut-busting weight training. 
Through it all, there was one constant-seniors Shereka Wright, Erika Valek, Lindsey I licks and Beth Jones. 
Junior Hannah Anderson knows why. 
"Everyday we come down the tunnel [at Mackey Arena], look up and see that 1999 national championship banner," she said. "That's what our seniors have been working for. That's why coach brought them in." 
The four seniors comprise one of the most successful classes in school history. In three years, they have amassed an 85-19 record, two Big Ten titles and three NCAA tournament appearances, including a run-· ncr-up finish in 2000-01. This year, they've carried Purdue to a No. 5 ranking. 
Alas, none of them were here in 1999, the last and only time the Boilermakers won the national title. 
They came to West Lafayette as a highly touted recruiting class. Oh, how time flies. 
Now, those seniors are down to their last chance. 
"It's weird looking at it because it feels like I was just a freshman," Wright said. "Now you're in that position where you're leading a team back where you need to be, and where you want to be. It's excit­ing, but it's also scary because you realize you don't get anoth­er chance." 
The seniors say a national title would be the perfect punc­tuation to a stellar four years. They also know that if they don't make it back to the Final Four, many of their achieve­ments will be forgotten. 
"You are remembered by how you leave," Hicks said. "That's very true. That's how people will remember us. That's our ultimate goal: to go to the Final Four." 
Coach Kristy Curry says the sense of urgency has embold­ened her seniors. 
"I see great leadership," Curry said. ''I'm trying to get my senior class to be more verbal and not to be just action lead­ers. I like what they stand for. They're trying to make sure that they excel at everything they're doing." 
They all excelled Sunday against No. 7 Kansas State in the Women's Tip-Off Classic at Mackey Arena. 
In a 79-69 win, Wright and Valek each scored 16 points, Jones was 4-of-4 from 3-point range and Hicks had eight points and six rebounds. 
And it's not just the seniors who are feeling the pressure. The younger players are deter­mined to make sure they send their teammates out on a high note. 
"They came in as the No. 1 recruiting class and we want to send them out as the No. 1 class," sopho.more Carol Duncan said. 
Associated Press 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. -John Navarre's name is secure in Michigan's record book. 
His legacy in Wolverines lore is not. 
Navarre holds a slew of Michigan passing records, but those accomplishments are marred by an 0-2 record against Ohio State. 
Some believe the senior has to lead the fifth-ranked Wolverines to a win against the No. 4 Buckeyes to be remembered as one of the best quarterbacks to wear a winged helmet. 
"You have to block that out because that's just part of the hype," Navarre said Monday. "You can't focus on that when you're preparing for this game. 
"But obviously, how you do against Ohio State is a big part of any career here." 
Navarre has one last chance to succeed in this rivalry when the Wolverines (9-2, 6-1 Big Ten) host Ohio State (10-1, 6-1) on Saturday. The outright Big Ten title and an automatic Bowl Championship Series bid are at stake. 
Michigan coach Lloyd Carr doesn't think one game should define the career of any player. 
"What defines you is your character," Carr said. 
However, teammate Grant Bowman, who grew up in Columbus, Ohio, understands why Navarre's legacy hinges on the outcome of the Ohio State game. 
"It's probably unfair, but there's a lot of things in life that are unfair," Bowman said. "In big games like this, the oppor­tunities are bigger and the

chance for loss [is] bigger. That's what you've got to love about it as a competitor. If you don't love that, you probably shouldn't be in the game." 
Navarre, a candidate for two national quarterback awards, is finishing his much-maligned career with a flourish. 
The native of Cudahy, Wis., has thrown a Big Ten-best 21 touchdown passes, with only eight interceptions. 
He needs 218 yards to

become the first Michigan quar­terback to throw for 3,000 yards in a season, and he's two TDs short of Elvis Grbac's career mark of 71. He has com­pleted 67. 9 percent of his fourth-quarter passes for eight TDs and only one interception. 
But those numbers will pale in comparison to Navarre's record against Ohio State if the Wolverines don't win Saturday, especially because of his two previous performances in the series. 
In a 14-9 loss last season, he was 23-of-46 for 247 yards with two turnovers. He fumbled with 
2:02 left, then threw a game­ending interception just short of the end zone. 
"You want to focus on those plays, and not repeat them," he said. 
Navarre threw for 206 yards with two touchdowns, four interceptions and a fumble in a 26-20 loss two years ago.

NEW YORK -Alex Rodriguez became the sec­ond player from a last­place team to win a Most Valuable Player award, then confirmed that the Texas Rangers have talked to him about a possible trade. 
"Management has approached me with a situ­ation and some choices, and I'm just going to keep my doors open right now," Rodriguez said Monday from Mexico during a con­ference call. 
Rodriguez received 242 points for the American League award in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Toronto first baseman Carlos Delgado was second with 213 points, followed by New York Yankees catcher Jorge Posada with 194. 
Showing the split among the writers, 10 players received first-place votes, one short of the record set in the 1947 NL vote and matched in the 1977 AL vote. 
Last year, Rodriguez fin­ished second in MVP voting to Oakland shortstop Miguel Tejada and in 1996 he finished three points behind the Rangers' Juan Gonzalez. 
IN BRIEF 

NB~ approves plan for 
realignment 

NEW YORK -The NBA's board of governors approved a realignment plan Monday that creates three divi­sions of five teams each in the Eastern and Western conferences. 
The expansion Charlotte Bobcats, the NBA's 30th team, were placed in the Eastern Conference and the New Orleans Hornets were moved to the Western Conference. The Hornets previously played in Charlotte before moving to New Orleans two seasons ago. 
Joining the new Charlotte fran­chise in the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference will be Atlanta, Miami, Orlando and Washington. The Central Division will have Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Indiana and Milwaukee. Atlantic Division teams will be Boston, New Jersey, New York, Philadelphia and Toronto. 
New Orleans will play in the Southwest Division of the Western Conference with Dallas, Houston, 
"It means the world to me," Rodriguez said. ''I'm so proud. It really is a vali­dation to all the hard work and dedication." 
Rodriguez has completed three seasons of a $252 million, 10-year contract, the richest in baseball his­tory. He has been paid $56 million and gets another $1 million on Dec. 1. He also is owed $12 million plus interest in deferred pay­ments from the contract's first three seasons. 
Rodriguez said he thought there had been talks about a possible trade with "three of four teams" but didn't elaborate. 
"I did not approach man­
agement, management approached me," Rodriguez said. ''I'm just going to leave the door open." 
Texas general manager John Hart said last week he wasn't looking to deal his star. 
"We're not having any conversations with any team about Alex Rodriguez," Hart said. "If anybody were to call. of course we'd listen." 
While Rodriguez praised Texas owner Tom Hicks, he refused comment several times when asked about his relationship with Hart and manager Buck Showalter. 
Memphis and San Antonio. The Northwest Division will have Denver, Minnesota, Portland, Seattle and Utah. The Pacific Division teams are Golden State, the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers, Phoenix and Sacramento. 
Teams will play divisional oppo­nents twice at home and twice on the road. They will play conference opponents outside their division three or four times, and teams from the other conference twice -at home and away. 
Divisional winners each earn a playoff berth. The remaining five playoff berths for each conference will be based on regular-season records with no regard to divisional alignment. 

Ohio State moves into sec­
ond place in BCS 
Ohio State moved past USC into second place in the BCS standings Monday. Even so, the Buckeyes might need more than a win at Michigan to defend their champi­onship. 

The Buckeyes edged ahead of Southern California by 0.19 points following their 16-13 overtime win over Purdue. The Trojans lost ground in the computers and strength of schedule after winning 45-0 at Arizona (2-9). 
"That's great, I guess, but it doesn't really mean anything until we go up and play Michigan," Ohio State defensive end Will Smith said. 
Oklahoma (10-0) remained the runaway leader in the standings that will determine which two teams will play for the national championship in the Sugar Bowl. 
The Sooners have a 1.0 for poll average, 1.0 for computer-rank aver­age, 0.40 for strength of schedule, zero for losses and 0.6 bonus points for beating fifth-place Texas for a 1.8. 
Ohio State was second with 7.52 points, followed by USC at 7.71 and LSU at 12.21.

Since the USC game, and excluding the Boston College contest, Jones has had solid rushing statistics in every game ­averaging 135.5 yards in those four contests.

After scoring in the final minute of the first, the Irish came back to score in the first minute of the second as defenseman Brett Lebda took a cross-ice feed from forward Matt Amado and took advantage of a defensive breakdown to slip it past Pearce. 
Brown, while still picking up the shutout, may have gotten a little lucky in the second period. Following a turnover in the neu­tral zone, the Under-18 team came in on a two-on-one, fore­ing Brown to move to his right to guard the shooter. 
The Under-18 team's Jack Johnson received a cross from his teammate and had a wide open net, but hit the post as he tried to slip it in. Brown was able to get back in time to keep Johnson from getting another chance at the puck. 
Notre Dame added goals from Tim Wallace and Mike Walsh later in the game to put it away, and outshot the Under-18 team by a-count of 39-28.

Everyday on this campus, someone is made to feel that he or she doesn't belong. It may even be obvious to anyone except the person that is hurt. When I walk across South 
"'u'"'L I don't see anyone with at-shirt that ways "White Anglo-Saxon Males Rule!" But I 
see it in the attitudes of people and in the comments that I hear. "That's so gay," when someone disagrees with what a friend says. And I hear the embarrassment and desire in someone's voice when all her friends are going to shop at the mall, again, because there's nothing better to do on a Tuesday afternoon, when she can't afford a $250 shopping spree 
at Abercrombie & Fitch just for the heck of it! 

'mon-the guys are just using a common expression, it's not like they really said it to homosexuals. And the girls are just having a good time; it's not their fault that parents make a ton of money! 
And these arguments may be true. The guys might not really hate homosexuals and the salaries of their parents are not in the control of the girls. But everyone is capable of sen­tivity to others. 
of the worst things about discrimination on our campus is that the majority of stu­don't even realize that it is here! It's not aimed at the straight white upper-middle class Catholic population. For every blatantly hurtful action, there are hundreds of every-actions and comments that make certain groups of students feel unsure about them­. All of these little things combine to form a subtle yet unwelcoming environment discourages diversity, respect and acceptance of all on campus. 
y, Thesday, November 18th at 7 p.m., ADAPT (Advanced Diversity Action & Planning Team), a new group sponsored by the Office of Student Affairs, is hosting "Let's talk about it," an interactive event that will push the Notre Dame community to face the problems surrounding 
issues of diversity and sensitivity on campus.

Push 'em back 
Irish offensive line coming together after rough start 
By JOE HETTLER 
Sports Edicor 
They took much of the blame when Notre Dame's offense struggled this season, but after Saturday's win over BYU, they deservedly took much of the credit. 
The Irish offensive line has battled through injury and inexperience to become a bet­ter unit as the season has pro­gressed, and the results have been clear in the last few games. 
"The line has really matured throughout the season," tackle Jim Molinaro said. "We've had our tough times, but we're really coming together as a unit." 

-
The group did not allow a sack against Florida State, 
Boston College and Navy, before giving up two against BYU. They have blocked well for Julius Jones in his two 200-yard rushing performanc­es, as well as the tailback's 

161-yard game versus the Cougars. 
After losing four players to the NFL draft at the end of the 2002 season, this year's offen­sive line was a concern from the beginning of spring prac­tice. The only returning starter, guard Sean Milligan, was injured early in the sea­son and hasn't played since the Michigan game Sept. 13. Centers Bobby Morton and Zachary Giles have switched in and out of their position throughout the season, and tackle/guard Dan Stevenson hasn't played in two games because of an injury. 
That's left a thin offensive line even thinner. But the Irish have persevered and made great strides in the last several weeks. 
"I think anytime you put five guys -in our case nine -into the heat of battle, over a ten or 11-week span, you grow

MEN'S SOCCER 
Irish grab No.5 seed in NCAA Tourney 
Special to The Observer 
Good news continues to roll in for the Notre Dame men's soc­cer team (15-3-3). The 2003 Big East champions found out where they stand in the NCAA Championship, were ranked third in the nation and landed a team member on the College Soccer News Team of the Week. 
The NCAA Men's Soccer Committee announced the field of 48 for the 2003 champi­onship Monday. Notre Dame received the fifth seed in the tournament, the highest in school history, and will have a bye in the first round of action -a first for the program. The Irish were seeded fifth behind No. 1 UCLA, No. 2 Maryland, No. 3 Wake Forest and No. 4 North Carolina.

Lack of divers hurts Belles against Albion

HOCKEY 
Irish handle Under-18 team 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER 
Associate Sports Editor 
Although the jerseys were something new, the stellar goal­tending was not. 
Sporting a new gold third jer­sey, Notre Dame used 28 saves from freshman goaltender David Brown and goals from four dif­ferent players to take care of the 
U.S. National Team Development Program's Under­18 team in an exhibition match Friday by a score of 4-0. 
The Under-18 team, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., features the top under-18 prospects in the nation and has helped supply eight current Notre Dame play­ers. 
Notwithstanding the fact the results of the exhibition do not count toward their final season record, the Irish still came out hard and aggressive against the younger U.S. team. 
"This would have been an off week for us," Irish head coach Dave Poulin said, "but instead it was a chance for us to play a pretty talented team and try out some players in different roles." 
Despite the large number of youngsters on the ice for both teams, Poulin said it was senior forward Rob Globke -who assisted on the first goal of the game -who really helped keep the team focused. 

"I thought that Rob played outstanding tonight," Poulin said. "He really set the tone for the game and played it simple and smart. I was pleased with the way he set the tempo early." 
The Irish took the early lead with less than a minute left in the first period when Globke sent a crisp pass to forward Michael Bartlett, but Bartlett was unable to handle it. The deflection off Barlett's stick went right to forward Tom Galvin, who put a shot past the Under­18 team netminder Jordan
