Trustees Committee 
discusses student life 
by Tony Pace Editor-in-Chief 
The Student Affairs Committee of the University Board of Trustees discussed many aspects of student life and listened to presentations by student government leaders at a meeting held yesterday in th£"; Center for Continuing Education. 
Two specific reports were presented on the overcrowded housing situation and on the pur­pose of the Campus Life Council (CLC). A general report was made on student life, which included statements from student govern­ment leaders describing their re­SlJective organizations. 
The student life report also included a presentation by minority student representative Steve Travis asking for concerted llniversity action toward addressing the unique needs of minority students. In the report, Judicial Coordinator Jayne Rizzo also described recent CLC action which allows parietals offensed to be tried by hall judicial boards. 
The tone of the meeting was informal and descriptive. Student Body President Andy McKenna described it as a "chance for some 
positive exchange of ideas. es­pecially about the issues which have arisen in the past two months." 
The residentiality report, which was addressed to the overcrowding issue, was presented by McKenna and Badin Hall vice-president Mary Ryan. 
McKenna outlined three possible solutions to overcrowding which are currently being discussed by the CLC: The possible solutions are a l9ttery, with the stipulation
t· 
I that it must be done early in the school yc~r. reducing the amount of storage space in the halls to 
I .. accomodate more students rooms, ancf converting what is currently
I graduate housing to undergraduate housing. . Other solutions were put for­ward, including the possibility of subsidizing off-campus housing. However, ·the committee did not consider this feasible. McKenna and Student Govern­ment Off-Campus Commissioner John Fitzpatricks remarked that students no longer want to move off campus because it is no longer economical. Other factors cited in the decrease of students moving off campus were crime and transporta­tion problems. The Student Affairs Committee is a nine-person body and is chaired by John Schneider. The five other members present yester­day were Donald Mathews, Anthony Earley, Paul Hellmuth, University General Counsel Philip Facccnda, and Fr. Thomas Blantz. 
Those committee members not 
present were Jane Pfeiffer, the 
Honorable John D. Rockefeller IV 
and Catherine Cleary. 
. Trustees had the opportunity to 
see some of the overcrowded 
conditions first hand during the 
lunch break of the full day session. 
The CLC report, given by 
McKenna, focused on the proposal 
passed by the CLC on Monday to 
clarify ·its purpose. McKenna 
made the presentation in order to 
initiate discussion on the CLC. 
However, no proposals were made, 
and there were no votes on the 
matter. 
The steps of the formation of the 
CLC were traced by the committee 
but Schneider indicated that the 
board could not address itself to the 
CLC's statement of last Monday. 
Travis asked that the University 
reaffirm its commitment to minori­
ty students by addressing their 
unique needs and helping them to 
then become a part of the Universi­
ty model. 
Dale Atkins, who spoke on the 
Black Cultural Arts Council and the 
annual need for funding the Black 
Cultural Arts Festival, stressed, 
"We do not promote separatism. 
The people in this University are 
different but in our diversity we are 
united.'' 
Travis stated that the problem 
for minority students. at Notre 
Dame is not success but survival. 
Part of the reason for this, he 
explained, is that the support 
services here are not geared to the 
needs of the minority student. 
''Minority students don't come from the same places that usually produce Notre Dame studenrs,'' he said. He also explained that the cultural background of most minor­ity students is generally not regarded as equal to that of other students. 
Margarita Garcia further explained that the problems out­lined by Travis applied, to the Hispanic students as well as to black students. 
Rizzo descrioed the reclassifica­tion of parietals offenses as "con­current jurisdiction." In addition to hall rectors and the Dean of Students, parietal offenses may now be heard by hall judicial boards. The purpose of this part of the report was solely descriptive. Rizzo stated, "I'm not asking for a response." 
She went on to describe the improvements that have been made in the judicial process, specifically with the hall J-boards, since_last May. 
The meeting closed in a congeni­al, relaxed atmosphere. Student Union Director Bill Roche said, "I enjoyed it and I think it was a positive experience.'' · by Gregory Solman 
John C. Campbell wrapped-up his lecture series on the "Great Powers and the Middle East'' yesterday before a Library Auditor­ium crowd of about 60, ending the three-day event sponsored by Insti­tute for International Studies. 
Campbell followed his previous lectures on the "Dulles/Khrush­chev" and "Dayan/Nasser" eras with yesterday's talk, which focus­ed on Henry Kissinger and Leonid Brezhnew--the personalities who shaped the late 60's and early 70's. 
"There was not as much trouble choosing personalities in this era as there had been in others," remark­ed Campbell, one of the foremost authorities of the Mideast. ''Though this was not as clear at the beginning of the era as it was at the end.'' 
Campbell explained the Nixon guidelines to Mideast diplomacy, which, in his view, included "a recognition by Nixon that the exisdhg balance (of power) in the area had to be preserved'' and that crucial domestic political recogni­tion of the "strength of the Jewish community," had been made. 
The speaker characterized then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as a man who ''thought in global 
terms"  and  "who  put  his  own  
stamp  on  American  Middle  East  
Policy."  

The era ·in question ended with the October War of 1973, Campbell said, and was "somewhat like the SO's period in that it was a period of great events and crises.'' 
Campbell outlined the Arab, Israeli, American and Russian re­actions to the events which led to United Nations Resolution 242. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nassar, Campbell said, appealed to the Soviet Union for more arms, and, more importantly, direct Sov­iet participation in the form of manpower. ''The Soviet Union made a bold 
and important decision to provide ed." Nassar. with missiles and crews," "However, the language of the commented Campbell.

F=======~~===~===========:::::: World 
Mourning ends for Pope 
VATICAN CITY--The Roman Catholic Church ended its nine-day mourning period for Pope John Paul yesterday while a computer "simulation" of the forthcoming vote for a new pope showed the archbishops of Naples and Palermo as th~ front-runners for the throne of St. Peter. The computer study, using information· obtained second-hand, said Cardinals Corrado Ursi of Naples or Salvatore Pappalardo of Palermo would most likely be the new leader of the world's 700 million Roman Catholics. The research was conducted by the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago under direction of an American priest and sociologist, the Rev. Andrew Greeley.

Network black-out occurs 
NEW YORK--The three big national television networks were knocked off the air for almost ·15 minutes in much of the nation last night by a power outage at a telephone switching station in Chicago, a telephone spokesman said. Shultz said the outage occurred twice during prime time, once at 9:45p.m. EDT for 8 minutes, and again at 10:19 p.m. for six minutes. In most areas, the network shows interrupted the first time were "Hawaii Five-0" on CBS, "Quincy" on NBC and "Soap" on ABC. The second time, the shows were "Barnaby Jones" on CBS, "Weekend" on NBC and "Family" on 
.CBS. The signal for .all three networks is relayed by cables and microwave transmitters handled by AT&T. 
Senate hears Birch case 
W ASillNGTON ··The Senate Ethics Committee wants the Justice Department to decide if Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Ind., broke the law by taking campaign money in the Capitol from a friend of Tongsun Park. The committee says in a report scheduled for release Monday that is has "substantial credible evidence" that Bayh or an aide took $1000 from a businessman friend of Park in the Capitol on Oct. 8, 1974, despite Bayh's denial. The report quotes Park as saying that, in addition, he himself gave $1500 to $1800 to the senator, contrary to Bayh's denial ofthe allegations. Park, a South Korean rice dealer, became the center of the Korean influence buying scandal.

SMC reflects on history 
38 years ago today 
Therewere a few rules of St. Mary's College during the 1940-41 academic year: 
"Regular hours for sewing are allotted to all the pupils, so that they may keep their wardrobe in perfect order." 
"Regular time for receiving visi­tors is on Wednesday from 1:30 to 3:30, and all calls or visits must be received in the public parlors. Frequent or protracted visits are highly detrimental to the improve­me.nt of the pupils." 
''Parents should be the first to see ~he great disadvantage arising from pupils visiting home during the session.'' 
"In order to avoid all objection­able correspondence, letters writ­ten or received are examined by the Superior of her substitute.'' 
35 years ago today 
The Graduate School of Sacred Theology for Women, first of its kind, was established in 1943. Then, in 1946, St. Mary's became the first woman's college in the United States to offer theology to undergraduates as a college ma.ior. 
59 years ago today 
On November 15, 1919, students from St. Mary's college "witnessed their first Notre Dame football game."

At half time, I'm down on the field watching them to make sure that they know where they are going. If someone makes an error, I pull him aside late and ask him what happened." continued Spohrer. 
"The guard used to be more of a super-macho, tough group. Initia­tion used to be a big deal. It was fun, but kind of archaic," he· commented. 
"We still use initiation, how­ever, it is done to put the rookies (first-year guards) through some­thing together ·-then, they will become fast friends. We don't do it to embarrass anyone or put them on the spot,'' he stated. 
Spohrer said the height require­ment for the Irish Guard is 6'2". He explained the rule is not always strictly adhered to, because some 
years not as many tall people try

before the first game last year. "It was worse than a ROTC haircut. It was so short that I felt that my ears

wore a hooded jacket for the next 
two weeks," he mused. 
Mike Gies, a rookie, stated that 
his first haircut was so bad his own 
mother dido 't even recognize him. 
"One of the things I had to do for 
initiation was memorize the words 
to Thelma Houston's song, "Don't 
leave me this Way" --then I had to 
sing it on our bus trip to the first 
away game." Digan stated. 
Jack Prendergast, a second-year 
guard, stated that he enjoys being 
in the Irish Guard because of the 
friendship. "We're all pretty close

side. Also, I'd never before hung 
around with eight guys my own

Pro-lifer Hyde to address general public 
Rep. Henry Hyde (R-DI); leader of 
the pro-life forces in the U.S. 
House of Representatives for the 
past four years, will speak in South 
Bend Sunday evening. 
Hyde's non-political visit comes at 
the invitation of the St. Joseph 
County Right to Life Committee. 
Following a press conference at 
7:15 p.m., he will address the general public at 7:30 p.m. in the Century Center's Bendix Theater. Admission is free and the public is invited. 
In the House of Representatives, where he serves on the Judiciary, Banking and Finance and Urban Affairs Committees, Hyde is best known as author of the contro­versial "Hyde Amendment" to the 1975-76 Health, Education and Welfare appropriations bill. 
The amendment denied HEW authority to spend money on abor­tions except when the life of the mother is endangered.

Casey at the Bat 
==========art buchwald 
NEWS ITEM--Judge rules that women reporters must be per­mitted in baseball locker rooms. 
It seemed extremely rocky for Mudville Nine that day; They blew the game in Spring­field on a stupid double play. So when a girl reporter walked in their locker room, They decided to play ball with her to take away the gloom. 
Cooney made the first pass, and he fell upon his face; Burrows tried to sacrifice, but couldn't get to base. Flynn was left in right field, and never got her name; It looked as though poor Mudville would lose another game. 
Then from the locker players went up a joyous yell; It rumbled in the showers , it rattled in the deil. It struck upon the saunas, and rebounded on the flat; For Casey, Mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat. 
There was ease in Casey's manner, a smile on Casey's face, As he whispered to the lady, "Would you like to see my place?" "Pas ce soir," the lady said, "and please take off your hat." "That's no way to talk," Flynn said, "when Casey's up to bat." 
She frowned :n great dis­pleasure, a hand upon her hip. She .stuck a mike in Casey's face and almost cut his lip. • • Strike One," the shortstop called out, as he doubled up a roared . .. Casey•s swinging wildly and he hasn't even scored.'' 
Casey dug his feet in as he made another pitch: "'Let's have a drink at your place and take away this itch." "I have a date," the lady said, "so knock off all the chatter; 
Tell· me wny you blew the game as Mudville's greatest batter.'' 
''Strike Two,'' the catcher shouted as he rolled upon the floor. Casey blushed with anger for he could not take much more. ''I have a brand-new Caddy sitting in the parking lot.'' The news hen shrugged her shoulders, "I guess that's all you've got." 
"Fraud!" cried Casey's team­mates and the echo answered, "Fraud!" But a scornful look from Casey and the locker room was awed. They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain, And they knew that Mighty Casey would not foul out again. 
"Look, honey," he said plain­tively, "I'll talk about my pain. Let's do it over pizzas and a bottle of champagne." 
"I haven't time to mess around,'' the lovely girt cried out. "I've got to meet a deadline; that's what news is all about." 
The  sneer  was  gone  from  
Casey's lips,  his  teeth  were  
clenched in fear.  
He  put  his  ann  around  the  

gttl--she socked him in the ear. She took her mike and hit his hand, and kicked in the shin. ""Now tell me, when you get your breath, just why you didn't win!" 
Oh, somewhere in this favored land, the moon is shining bright, And girls are doing disco in pants that are too tight; And somewhere men are laughing and drinking Guiness stout, But there's no joy in Mudville­Mighty Casey just struck out.

of history. Last year's members of the Saint Mary's Rome program--sophomores from Notre Dame and Sain~ Mary's--were within close distance to the Pantheon, a perfectly intact temple to the Roman gods

Colosseum where gladiators fought and Christians were thrown to the lions, and the Forum where ruins of the most 
'{ 
important temples, government buildings, and marketplaces stand. 
The long Christian tradition in Rome could be experienced by students in the city. It was only a short walk to St. Peter's Basilica, the world's largest and perhaps

• most impressive church. With the special permission of the Vatican, students were able to tour the excavations under St. Peter's where archaeologists are trying to discover the original grave of St. Peter. A living reminder of the 2000 years of continuing Church tradition was the stu­dents' audience with the Pope. Our group was privileged to have the opportunity to see Pope Paul VI in the last year of his eventful reign, as he was carried in on his papal chair which has now been abolished after centuries of use. Churches in Rome are visible at almost every comer, and contain some of the world's most impres­sive art work, including Michelangelo's spectacular frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, 
~' which overwhelm the viewer at first sight. Looking at the religious tradition of Rome often makes a student wonder whether the Catholic Church is a divine or a man-made institution. I realized that many church 
i! 
customs and teachings have human ori­': gins, my realization that the Church has continued to grow through 2000 years strengthened my faith. 
A sad contrast to the glory of the Roman Empire could be seen in a walk through the modern Italian streets. The Hotel Tiziano where the women reside is located on the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, one of the principal streets of Rome named after the King at the time Italy was unified in 1860. Yet one could see political posters of the many differing political ideologies in Italy calling for communism, socialist demon­strations, the release of Aldo Moro (begged by both Christian Democrat and Communist supporters), and even monar­chy as the only way to restore order. These all testified to the fact that Italy was never really unified. Intense regional loyalties have caused so much conflict among Italians that they are unable to form a real 
.. nation. The Corso Vittorio Emanuele II had banks, stores for Italian consumers, tourist shops, Baroque churches, and sidewalk cafes featuring an Italian coffee called cappucino and good ice cream and choco­lates. Although middle-class prosperity prevailed on the business streets, poverty could be seen in the eyes of the beggars. In spite of Italy's industrialization, it still lags far behind the Germanic and Scandi­navian countries, the British Isles, and France, economically. · One popular misconception about Rome is that political violence is rampant in the streets. The activities of the Red Brigades are directed against political leaders and businessmen so they have little effect on the daily lives of Italians. The most serious demonstrations followed the killing of a Communist student in the autumn. Students have few problems as long as they do not participate in political demon­


Rome's Piazza Navona 
strations. The most common demonstra­tions are by feminists who are disturbed by the Italian men's possessive attitudes towards women. Italian girls are usually heavily protected by the family and are rarely seen in the streets at night. 
The academic side to the Saint Mary's Rome Program did a great deal to help the student learn about the historical and cultural treasures of Rome. Students in Rome this year have the great advantage of experienced professors like Mrs. Peggy Craig, an expert in art history and archaeology, Dr. Gabriel Bertoniere, an expert in early Christian archaeology, and Miss Carmella Merola, who is well-versed in Italian literature. Sister Mercita Lynch is the director of the program and lives with the women at the Hotel Tiziano. The men live around the corner at the Pensione Barrett and eat meals at the Hotel Tiziano. Mk's. Portia Spanu, a Saint Mary's gradu­ate who has been Assistant Director since 1970, guides students on an outstanding Lectures and Tours program which includes places like Pompeii, Greek temples at Paestum, the Miditerranean island of Capri, Emperor Hadrian's villa at Tivoli, the medieval town of Siena, 
• 
monasteries in the Apennines, and tours of the Forum and and St. Peter's with Miss Anna Lelli, an ardent anti-Fascist who was an interpreter to Churchill during World War II. The orientation week is spent in medieval, mountainous town of Assisi. 
The hundred students from the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame architecture programs live in hotels partially because Italian families are closed units that would not feel comfortable with a foreign student living in the house. This makes it more difficult for students to get to know Italians. Yet, many take the initiative to make friendships with Italians in ways like 
• teaching them English aJid meeting at bars. Italians are usually friendly towards Americans and are pleased if American make an effort to speak their language, even if it is not always spoken correctly . Social life in Rome at night is centered around discotheques, bars, and cafes. Students enjoy long dinners in restaurants featuring the Italian specialty, pasta, as the Italian lifestyle is much mot:e relaxed than ours. Prices in Italy are cheaper than in most European countries. A favorite pastime of students is sitting around the numerous monuments and fountains on the Italian piazzas. 
Ofcourse one of the many advantages of studying in Europe is the opportunity to travel. Students can visit the artistic treasures of Florence at almost any time since it is only four hours from Rome. Rome is only an overnight train ride away from the scenic mountains of Austria and Switzerland, the canals of Venice, and the beaches of the French Riviera and Sicily. At Christmas students usually buy a Eurail or Interrail Pass and tour countries like West Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, and Portugal. Trips to England, Ireland, and Greece usually take place during spring break or at the end of the year. 
A year of study in Rome is a great experience one will always remember. The opportunities to travel and learn about the culture and history of the different Euro­pean countries are as numerous as a student wants to make them. Although Italy may not be as modern, prosperous, or stable as some other European countries, it far surpasses any of the other countries for opportunities to learn about great works of the past in history, art, and architecture. Italy has great combination of natural beauty and manmade wonders.

The Irish Extra 
To replace MacAfee 
Montana finds new team of receivers 
by Ray O'Brien Sports Editor 
When Ken MacAfee graduated last year, Dan Devine must have wondered who would be hauling in crucial passes · on third and long situations the way "Big Mac" had done since his freshman year. Notre Dame's head coach had no answers last spring and the situation hasn't changed so far this fall. But instead of Devine finding one premier target for his ace quarterback Joe Montana, he has gotten half the team's backs and ends running pass patterns. 
Replacing MacAfee, a three-year All-American, was a big enough chal­lenge but the problem of finding a replacement has been compounded by the unfortunate occurrenceof injuries. The picture began to look bleak when 
-. · • split end Kris Haines pulled ligaments during two-a-day practices during the early fall. Haines, who was the leading returning receiver posting 28 catches for 587 yards last year, was the only bright spot in the passing game.. 
"It was really unfortunate,'' explained Haines. "I lived with Joe (Montana) this summer and we had a lot of time to practice and get down our timing. After I got hurt and missed a lot of practices, much of that timing was off." 

While Haines competed with the aggravated muscle pull in the first three games, his effectiveness was limited. The less than spectacular showing was accountable to more than just the injury. "I just was in a slump,"_ confided Haines. "My leg bothered me but I still wasn't playing the way I know I could." Could it be that the loss of MacAfee had put extra pressure on Haines? "I don't really feel any extra pressure," 
explained the Irish's wide receiver. "But I know people expect more of me. It is a lot harder without MacAfee around because the defenses we have faced have concentrated more heavily on the split end than the tight end. I just haven't been able to run the patterns planned." 
That is a problem that Devine is trying to deal with. After a phenomenal spring 
~ ' ' 
session, Kevin Hart was tabbed as the 
heir to MacAfee's cleats. But as I uck 
would have it, Hart tore a knee muscle 
right before the season opener and saw 
only brief action. ~ick Vehr then got the 
nod and performed adequately while 
Montana was having an off day. 
Since the opener, the tight end spot 
that had been such a sure spot for three 
years was now up for grabs. Devine has 
tried Dennis Grindinger there in addition 
to. Hart and Vehr and is attempting to 
break freshman Dean Masztak into the 
positionthe way MacAfee was prepared 
four years earlier. 
~ Grindinger made his first varsity catch 
against Michigan and the timing 
couldn't have been better as the recep­
tion was in the Wolverine end zone-good 
for six points. Since then Grindinger has 
started and been used mainly in running 
situatiorrs, totaling four receptions to tie 
Masztak for most passes caught by a 
tight end. Hart has been credited with 
one reception while Vehr has snagged 
two aerials bringing the tight end 
reception total to eleven. For now it 
seems that Devine will continue this 
shuttle system until one player stands 
out above the competition. 
Injuries have also made their mark in 
the flanker ranks. Tom Domin injured 
his knee right before the first game and 
had to undergo surgery putting an 
early finish to his season. 
"Injuries like Domin's have really hurt us," emphasized Devine. "His injury was strange because it came in a nearly non-contact situation. With the 90 scholarship rule into effect, you can't afford to lose too many players." 

No sooner had Devine uttered these words before he lost his second string flanker--again during a practice. "I just caught a pass wrong and split my middle finger," explained Pete Holohan. The dislocated bone kept him out of the Michigan State game and his standing for the encounter with Pittsburgh is doubtful. 
Holohan had a superb first game against Missouri hauling in five passes for 70 yards in the losing cause. Since then the flanker has been nearly

Pitt-Notre Dame clashes 
by Lou Severino Sports Writer 
The Pittsburgh-Notre Dame contest will not only match a pair of nationally renown schools, but will also serve as a showcase for several outstanding indivi­dual matchups. Here is a rundown on some of the most important battles which will take place as the Panthers and Irish collide on the turf of Notre Dame Stadium tomorrow afternoon. 
Pitt wide receiver Gordon jones [6-1185] vs. NO cornerback Dave Waymer [6-3 182]: After working one-on-one against Kirk Gibson last week Dave Waymer d~serves a rest. But the Irish cornerback will have his hands full once again trying 
to  stick  to  Jones  who  has  sprinter's  
speed (9.3  100)  to  go  along  with  fine  
moves  and  good  hands.  Jones  is  

enjoying another outstanding year with 
16 receptions in 4 games, good for 285 
yards and 2 TDs. The speedy All-Ameri­
can also possesses a school record streak 
of 20 consecutive games with at least one 
reception. Waymer shut out Gibson in 
the first half of last week, and although 
the MSU star finished with six catches 
he was unable to beat Waymer deep. 
That will be the objective this week: 
prevent the long-gainer. Dave Waymer 
has shown thus far this season that he can get that job done. 
Pitt quarterback Rick Trocano vs. NO secondary: The inexperienced Trocano's ability to pass may decide the outcome of. Saturday's game. The Panther rushing attack has not been very impressive, especially considering the quality of their, opposition through the first four games of the year. Pitt has averaged only 3.4 yards per rush against the likes of Temple, Tulane and Boston College. On the other side of the• coin, the ND secondary has been riddled by opposing quarterbacks who have completed 56 percent of their passes against the Irish. So it seems obvious that Pitt will challenge Dan Devine's club through the air. Trocano has passed well this year with 36 completions in 75 attempts for 487 yards. More importantly, the 6-1, 195 pound sophomore has thrown only one interception. The Irish pass defense which may be bolstered by the return of free safety Joe Restic will also need help from the frontline which must mount a better pass rush than they have shown in the past two weeks. 
NO offensive tackles Tim Foley [6-5 257] and Rob Martinovich [6-5 256] vs. Pitt defensive ends Hugh Green [6-2 218] and Dave DiCiccio (6-0 205]: Although 
football fans often overlook line play these two matchups will definitely be worth watching. It will be a case of size against speed in both cases. Green and DiCiccio are the Panthers second and third leading tacklers and will attempt to outquick their massive opponents. 
...... 
Green, an All-American candidate has not been pleased with his performance this season, but will be looking to harass Joe Montana from his right end position. On the offensive side Tim Foley has been blocking very well and will be utilized, especially in short yardage situations. Last week against Michigan State Foley opened up several gaping holes, freeing Jerome Heavens and Vagas Ferguson for ldng gainers~ 
NO center Dave Huffman ]6-5 245] vs. Pitt noseguard Dave logan [6-1 250]: Huffman will be trying to even the score against Logan who enjoyed an excellent showing in last year's Pitt-Notre Dame 

f.· 
game. Logan was named the ABC­Chevrolet defensive player of the game for his six solo tackles, two assisted tackles and two quarterback sacks in that game. Huffman continues to serve as the anchor of the Irish offensive line both on and off the field. Look for the Dallas native to avenge last year's battle with · an outstanding effort in the middle of the line. ::··· 

NO quarterback joe Montana [6-2 191] and his receivers vs. the Pitt pass defense: Montana turned in his finest performance of the season last week at East Lansing, completing six of twelve passes for 149 yards. However it seems likely that joe will have to gd to the air more often against the Panthers. The return of Kris Haines will be a big asset for the Irish. Haines caught three passes for 90 yards, including 35 and 44 yarders 
-in the first half before the Irish decided to stick to the ground game in the second half. Montana's other targets will be new flanker Jim Stone and tight ends Dennis Grindinger and Dean Masztak. The receivers will be working against a Pitt secondary which was expected to be the team's weak spot. But in the Panther's first four games this unit has accounted for eleven interceptions while allowing only 40 completions in 100 attempts. Free safety Jeff Delaney is the only experienced defender for Jackie Sherrill's backfield. One possible target for the -Irish is right cornerback joJo Heath, a converted tailback with only 4 games of defensive experience. The NO pas~ng will offer the Panthers their sternest test of the season. Hopefully the Irish will pass in both halves this week, and with more success than other Pitt opponents have achieved.

The Irish Extra 

==================================================================:============================================================================================================================================================================================ e ye.
The Irish Eye enters this week with renewed enthusiasm after picking per­fectly for the second time in five tries. That success was due to Notre Dame's second straight victory (although they' still have not beaten the point spread). Upsets were few last week but the top 
• powers showed vulnerability except Oklahoma who seems head and shoul­ders above the rest of the field. This week some of the top twenty teams are going to ge.t caught looking ahead. The Pitt-Notre Dame contest is at the top of the charts but keep an eye on the thriller between Rice and Texas Christian. Here are the outcomes of this week in college football. 
Florida at Alabama: Bear's boys barely beat Washington last week relying on a late touchdown to save them from oblivion. The report is that Barna ain't all they were cranked up to be. But this game is in their backyard and it is a conference game which, if you believe Bo Schembechler, is more important than the Super Bowl. Florida is no slouch but they are not the ones that are going to knock the Crimson Tide from a bowl bid. I'll go with Alabama by another late touchdown. 
Cornell at Harvard: This is the top 
contest in the Ivy League which makes 
you wonder why ND does not try and join 
the conference. Cornell has a porous 
defense so expect Joe Restic' s father to 
go wild with his 50 offensive formations 
and quadruple-threat backs. In the end 
all this trickery will produce three 
touchdowns and a lot of confused 
spectators as the Crimson roll to a 14 
point victory. 
Duke at Navy: Stop laughing! The Middies are 4-0 and if things keep going right for George Welsh, they will meet ND in Cleveland in three weeks with a 6-1 record (assuming they lose to Pitt which might be a common loss with their opponents). Duke is weak but they are the kind of team that Navy annually loses to. But with the game at . home, hopefully that will not happen and the Irish can pick up top twenty votes by beating a "military powerhouse." Navy 
sinks the Blue Devils by 10. 
Georgia at lousiana State: This is another big game in the SEC with LSU undefeated at 4-0 and hot on the heels of Alabama. Georgia has surprised a lot of people as they have managed to avoid losing so far. Too bad for the Bulldogs that the game is at LSU in a year when they have~ for-midable team. The game means too much to LSU so I'll bet that Charles Alexander runs wild and the Tigers run over Georgia by 17. 
Iowa State at Missouri: Who would have expected these two teams to go into this game as members of the elite top twenty in the nation. The Tigers are for real and 
they  have  Notre  Dame  to  thank  for  
giving them  a  big start.  Iowa State is  
right  behind  Mizzou  in  the  rankings,  

rounding out the top twenty with a 4-1 record. The difference in this game will be the fact that Warren Powers' squad has faced tough tests while the Cyclones are as yet unproven. The home field advantage makes the Tigers a six-point favorite in this battle of the Big-8 teams. 
Michigan State at Michigan: The Wolverines barely escaped a mediocre Arizona team last week rigbt after Bo said that his team would begin to roll and stop looking two weeks ahead. Maybe Schembechler has no control if the talent isn't there. If Eddie Smith stays as hot as he is and Darryl Rogers can get a defense together, the Spartans could pull off the upset. They could but they won't because this a conference game that makes all the difference in the world. I'll stick with the Wolverines by 
9. 
Ohio State. at Purdue: Woody's Buckeyes were lucky to get away with a tie against SMU. The vulnerable areas are in full view so closed practices will no longer help. Purdue is not scaring anyone but they did finally get that powerful offense together. The winner of this game will be Michigan's only threat for the Big Ten title which should make Wolverine fans happy. I smell and upset and I pray the Boilermakes stay away from dumb mistakes so they will win by 6 points and shut Woody Hayes up forever. 
Washington at Stanford: These Pac-Ten contests are always thrillers and are reliable upset opportunities. The ball will be in the air most of the game with Stanford's awesome aerial game pitted against the Huskie stingy defense. At 3-2, the Cardinals are lucky to be in the top twenty. This week they are going to have to earn their keep or they will be replaced (maybe by Notre Dame). That home team advantage weighs heavy on my mind, so I'll go with Stanford by 3. 
Texas A&M at Houston: Another in a long list of prime conference battles, both teams are ran ked in the top twenty with A&M sitting in sixth place unde­feated. Unfortunately Arkansas had more preseason press and is ranked third without a loss. Houston plays tough against several formidable foes but never has given the Aggies any problems. This· game just means too much to A&M and they know it and will try an pour it on for the press with a 17-point victory. 
Rice at TCU: The one you've been waiting for! I can't use either of these teams as a sure bet because they are playing each other and unless the rules have been changed, both teams cannot lose. This is the battle ot the cellar of the SWC. Both teams have been humiliated with 50 point loss margins. Between them they were 3-19 last season with TC taking the annual contest. Looking for a repeat this year as Rice holds the dubious title as "the most kicked around major college team in the country" for a sec~nd straight year as they lose by 14. 
Pitt at Notre Dame: The Panthers go into the game ranked ninth with a 4-0 record. Their offense has been paltry as they scored under 25 points or less in their first three games. Last week they easily knocked off Boston College but so did Navy the week before. As usual, their defense is stingy although there are not many superstars in the lineup. The Irish's problems change week by week, so there's no telling what will break down. The game will be close and the decision will come in the fourth quarter but strictly on the basis of talent shown on the field and on the sidelines so far this year, I MAY BE WRONG BUT I'LL PICK PITT BY 6.

of 62 receptions. 
The lack of dependable receivers has 
also had an effect on the passing 
accuracy of Montana although the senior 
signal caller puts all the blame on 
himself. "The timing on pass patterns 
hasn't been perfect but I haven't been 
putting the ball where I should when 
someone gets op~n." 
Kris Haines thinks the worst has passed and the Irish passing game will become a threat once more. "I feel like I'm back to full strength and we've gotten our timing back," mentioned Haines before the game with Michigan State. "If I can break out of my slump, it may open up the passing lanes for everyone which helps our entire offense." 
The senior seemed to have hit the nai1 on the head as he combined with Montana for three first half passes for long yardage. Hardly by coincidence, the rushing game had its most produc­tive game to date and the tight ends found themselves open. However, Montana completed only one of four tries in the second half as the ground game did most of the work. 
If the Irish are to find consistency in a so-far meager offense, Devine will have to come up with receivers that will keep the opposing defense from keying on the run or "Kris Haines. This Saturday will be a good test of just how far the passing game has come as Pitt boasts several capable defenders. The battle ten yards down field may decide the final score in this week's game and the final score an Notre Dame's 1978 season.

STOCKHOLM Sweden [AP] • Two Americans and a Swiss won the Nobel Prize for medicine yesterday for their discovery of a method for breaking apart genetic material that may eventually unlock some of the mysteries of cancer and heredi­tary diseases. 
The winners, chosen by· the Nobel Committee of Sweden's Karolinska Institute of Medicine, are microbiologists Daniel Nathans and Hamilton 0. Smith of John Hopkins University Medical School in Baltimore, and Werner Arber of the University of Basel, Switzer­land. 
The three, who will share the $165,000 aw~rd, were chosen from among 205 candidates, sources said. 
The awards put the United States well on the way to dominating the Nobel Prize list this year. The only other award announced so far, for literature, went to Yiddish author Isaac Bashevis Singer, a New Yorker. 
"Holy cowl Are you kidding?" the 47-year-old Smith exclaimed when told of the award by a reporter in Baltimore. "I just didn't imagine it would be

considered in that light. I'm flabbergasted." 
Nathans, 49, who heads the microbiology department in which Smith is a professor, said he was "delighted, expecially to win the award with Hamilton Smith and Werner Arber." The 49-year-old Swiss scientist returned from a vacation in the Alps Thursday and was told the news by a neighbor. "It's unbelievable," Arber told a reporter. 
The three researchers, whose breakthrough findings were made in the late 1960's and early 1970's, were cited for the discovery of "restriction enzymes" and their application to genetics. 
The enzymes -substances that act as catalysts for chemical reac­tions -enable scientists to separate out the basic units of heredity, genes, which are composed of the substance DNA and are carried on microscopic rod-shaped chromo­somes in the nucleus of cells. Then, by mapping the order of genes, analyzing their chemistry or creating new combinations, researchers can better learn how genes determine hereditary charac­teristics. 
''If we call this field genetic surgery, the restriction enzymes • are our knives," explained Reichard. He said the discoveries will provide new insight into pos­sible prevention or cure of body malformations and eventually hereditary diseases. 
Another Swedish professor, • Thomas Lindahl, said development of medical cures based on this basic research still is a long way off and the possibility of curing hereditary diseases through direct surgery on genes is ''sodistant it can almost be called science fiction.'' 
The discovery of restriction enzymes also made possible research into recombinant DNA, or "genetic engineering," which has stirred a wide ethical debate over the possibilities of manipulating genes and arbitrarily redesigning the human race. 
The Swedish professors played down these fears and instead stressed the beneficial medical applications. Diabetes specialist Robert Luft said, for example,_that restriction enzymes will be helpful in the future production of insulin.

Because all the members have had ballet or pompom experience, two-girl teams will take turns choreographing. "This should

Roberts, now a grocer and apartment manager in Chatanooga, TN, patented a socket wrench 15 years ago·-when he was 18 -but sold the rights to Sears & Roebuck Co. for $10,000. His wrench permits a mechanic to change sockets with one hand.

51  million,  which  he  picked  up  
Wednesday  from his la wyer.  
Robert's  attorney,  Lewis  G.  

Davidson, said U.S. District Judge George Leighton was reviewing the settlement and may award Roberts even more money and possibly restore the patent to Roberts. 
Roberts said he never would have sued Sears if "they had been honest with me in the first place." 
"They told me 15 years ago that there wasn't much need for my wrench, that it probably wouldn't sell very well," he said. "But Mr. Davidson proved in court that they were very excited and were already changing their whole tool line to adapt to my wrench." 
Sears spokesman Ernest Arms said Wednesday that the firm had no commet!_t on the case except that it had bought the rights ''at a price 
announced.

Irish open ''Fun Season" 

by Gregory Solman Assistant Sports EdJtor 
It is not difficult to understand why Tim Walsh, veteran defense­man for Notre Dame's LaCrosse Team terms the fall season as being "the fun season." 
Their season opener against Chi­cago LaCrosse Club ·is the last serious game they intend to play. Last Sunday, on Stepan Field, the Irish relied on a fast-breaking running game to take the lead midway through the first quarter and control the game until the final buzzer, winning 10-7. Tallies by John Gray, Paul Rizzo, Tim Walsh, Mike Caron, Carl Lundblad and John Romanelli made it easy for rookie Irish netminder Mark Tall­madge.

An hour after the Pittsburgh football ~ames ends, the Irish will take to the field again--this time, to face the Alumni of the Irish LaCrosse Club. 
''This game has become a tradi­tion in Irish LaCrosse," joked Walsh. "We put them up in a wing of a motel, get them tickets for the game, and throw them a big party, before and after the game. We have ~-great time.'' 
Walsh admitted that the fall season in LaCrosse is basically a learning one. 
"In the fall, we try to get new guys to try out, and give .them a chance to try their wings,'' said Walsh. "Wejustplay these games to see how we stand for the next spring, to try out new offensive and defensive strategies, and because 
Leo Latz lnterhall tradition In Season 
It's Homecoming Weekend at Notre Dame as the Fighting Irish host 
the Panthers from Pittsburgh. That's enough to get anybody 
excited . The national television audience on ABC attests to that 
fact. But this weekend carries even greater importance to nearly 
500 young men from the 15 men's residence halls on campus. 
This Sunday, the !-formations and the resounding clash of helmet on helmet will move from Notre Dame Stadium to the gridiron of Cartier Field. The names arid teams will be different too, because this Sunday marks the beginning of a new season at Notre Dame, the season of Interhall Football. 
No one knows quite when the interhall system began at Notre Dame. But the tradition and prestige associated with this program is undeniable.. It all began with the legendary days of Knute Rockne who thought of football ·as a character builder. Therefore, he thought that it shouldn't be restricted to the varsity level but open to everyone on campus. Dominic J. "Nappy" Napolitano, in his 50th year at Notre Dame, remembers the early days of interhall: 
"I came to Notre Dame in 1928, and the interhall system was going 
strong, so no one really knows when it all started. All I know is that 
Rockne started the whole think and his assistants handled the entire 
program.'' 
Napolitano continued, "During the early years, Rockne would 
send interhall teams on trips during Thanksgiving to play small 
colleges. In those days, students wouldn't travel during the breaks, 
so the interhall football trips meant quite a bit to the players. The 
inter hall teams held their own against the small colleges." 
IfRockne was the foundation of interhall, Napolitano certainly has 
to be the structure for its vast growth during the 30's through the 
70's. 
"Interhall is still the most popular activity we have in the intramural program at Notre Dame," explains Napolitano. "Yet, in days past, interhall was going stronger then, than it is now. We didn't have television and radio in those days, so football was about the only entertainment. In fact, we could only go out one night a month and then we have to be in by 10 p.m. So in the fall, a mob of kids would go out for interhall. The rivalry was tremendous and the competition was fierce. The rectors of each hall were really the backbone on the interhall program." 
Notre Dame's inter hall program is one of the few of its kind in the country. In fact only two other non-military type academic institutions maintain programs similar to Notre Dame's. They are Yale and Harvard. But the continuation of Notre Dame's program faced its stiffest challenge this year with the helmet controversy. 
"It has been a tough roadjustto get this season underway," notes Napolitano. "We have been fighting the helmet battle since May and have spend close to $15,000 for the new helmets. But thanks to people like Rich O'Leary, Tom Kelly and the rest of the interhall staff, this season will start Sunday." There have been other changes over the years in interhall. In fact, paging through the annals, one_finds that the championship games were played in Notre Dame Stadium. Another yearly event was a trip to play the inmates at the prison in Michigan City, Indiana. 
"Every year we would take teams to play the prisoners," recalls Napolitano. ''The kids really enjoyed playing the'se games because they were hard-hitting contests and then they would eat with the convicts after the game. It was funny because a normal conversation would include a Notre Dame student asking an inmate, 'What are you in for?' and the inmate would casually respond something like, 'I killed my wife.' It was really a good experience because they were doing a service besides playing football.'' 
Another fixture in the inter hall program is Professor Jim Carberry. Carberry, a 1950 graduate of Notre Dame, played inter hall here and has been an Irish Interhall mentor since 1962. 
"This is a tremendous program," explains Carberry. ••Because the kids are not playing for the roar of the crowd. They are playing as a matter of pride. Also, the amount of talent is tremendous. There are a lot of all-state and all-county people out there." 
Football prowess is indeed in abundance on the interhall gridiron. 
Interhall is known for its occasional knack of producing a varsity starter every few years. Ed Gulyas went down from the Dillon Interhall Team to walk-on to starting halfback on the Fighting Irish in 1970 and 1971. 
Inter hall Football has even drawn national publicity. In a 1970 issue of Sports Wustrated, writer Jerry Kirshenbaum described interhall football as follows, "How else account for the Notre Dame's intramural football program-not the collection of straggly touch players you find on other campuses, but 650 men happily banging heads as members of 18 fully equipped teams? It used to be said that Dmon Hall could whip Kansas State, bu't Parseghian, whose recruiting is keyed to convincing prospects at Notre Dame, discourages any talk that the campus abounds in surplus talent." It is evident then, that Sunday won't just be the start of another interhall football season at Notre Dame, it will be the continuation of vet another traditional and prestigious happening under the Dome. 
they are fun to play." 
This fall, one of the playe_!:s "trying out his wings," and proving quite successful at it, was Irish goalie Mark Tallmadge, who, after three years of playing de­fense, moved to the "hot spot" to fill a vacancy left by the graduation of three goaltenders last spring. 
''Somebody had to do it,'' laughed Tallmadge, refering to his 210-pound frame. "I really didn't mind ... .l fill up more of the goal than anyone else. 
"I've learned a lot this fall," commented Tallmadge. ''Our coaches, Rich O'Leary and Lenny Polk, and almost everyone on the team has taught me a lot about playing the position.'' 
"Chicago came out more physi­cally than we expected,'' reflected Walsh on the Irish win. "H they had come out playing a finesse game, I think they might have given us a harder time--we can play the physical game with anybody.'' 
"I think we were in better shape than they were," he continued, "and their talent certainly wasn't at its height." 
Both Walsh and Tallmadge are looking forward to successful springs, when things will get deadly serious for the Irish. On their schedule are such power­houses as Chicago, Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State, Purdue Ihe Notre Dame lacrosse team enters their ''fun" fall season of

and Bowling Green. 
Meanwhile, the irish are enjoying play. The Irish knocked off the Chicago lacrosse Club last Sunday, 
10-7, to get the fun started.

Poetry In Motion 
The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Yankees in LA. The score stood 4-3, two out, one inning left to play. 
But when Dent slid safe at second and Blair got on at first 
Every screaming Dodger fan had cause to fear the worst. For there before the multitude 
Ah destiny! Ah fate! 
Reggie Jackson, mighty Reggie, was advancing to the plate. 
Reggie, whose three home runs had won the year before, 
Reggie, whose big bat tonight fetched every Yankee score. 
On the mound to face him stood the rookie, young Bob Welch. 
A kid with a red. hot fastball --Reggie's pitch--and no­thing else. 
Fifty thousand voices_ cheered as Welch gripped ball in mitt. 
One hundred thousand eyes watched Reggie rub his bat and spit. . 
"Throw your best pitch, kid, and duck," Reggie seemed to say. 
The kid just glared. He must have known this wasn't Reggie's day. 
His first pitch was a blazer. Reggie missed it clean. 
Fifty-thousand throats res­ponded with a Dodger scream. 
They squared off, Reggie and the kid. Each knew what he must do. 
And seven fastballs later, the count was three and two. No shootout on a dusty street 
out here in the Far West 
Could match the scene: A famous bat; a kid put tc. the test. 
One final pitch. The kid reared back and let a fastball 'fly.
Fifty-thousand Dodger fans gave forth one final cry ... Ah, the lights still shine on 
Broadway, but there isn't any doubt: The Big Apple has no joy left. 
Mighty Reggie has struck out. by Jules l.oh
