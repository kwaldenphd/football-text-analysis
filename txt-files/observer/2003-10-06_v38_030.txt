ND showcases performing arts 

Director offers media sneak peek of new DeBartolo Center 
By ANDREW THAGARD Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame showcased its DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts on Saturday through a media tour. The tour utTered University publications and local television stations an up close look at the interior of the $62.6 million, 150,000 square foot com­plex that will house the depart­ment of Film, Television and Theater and play a vital role in campus life and the South Bend community, according to officials. 
"This is the single most compli­cated thing from an engineering and design perspective that Notre Dame has ever built," said John Haynes, Leighton Director of Performing Arts, as he led guests through the building. 
The project is by far Notre 
Dame's biggest contribution to the performing arts since the con­struction of Washington Hall in 1888. 
The building, which has grand entrances on the DeBartolo Quad and Angela Boulevard, is fitted with an exterior collegiate Gothic architectural style. The visible por­tion of the building primarily hous­es offices and classrooms and con­ceals two flat-roofed areas where the performing venues are located. 
Open spaces surrounding the Center will initially serve as park­ing lots but long term plans call for the construction of a new museum to replace the Snite and a new music hall -in e!Tect creating a cultural corridor on the south side of campus, Haynes said. Angela Boulevard, which currently curves inward toward the Center, will be straightened, making room for a public park and setting the stage for revitalization of the surround­ing neighborhoods that will include shops and housing.

NDPRESENTS new arts program 
By ANDREW THAGARD Assistant News Editor 
When John Haynes announced last week that he wanted the arts to be as pervasive as athletics at a University a steeped in foot­ball tradition, located in a state dominated by basket­ball, many wondered if he was crazy. 
The Leighton Director of Performing Arts, however, announced Saturday the creation of "NDPRESENTS," a new program focused on bringing talented artists from around the world to South Bend. 
According to Haynes, a major complaint among new arrivals to South Bend ­including students -is a lack of cultural program­ming. While the Morris Performing Arts Center hosts Broadway musicals and other popular commer­cial ventures, non-profit performing arts like ballet and orchestra are being neglected. 
"There's this great big gap [in programming]. and in that gap you don't get pro­fessional touring compa­nies," He said. "Half a mil­lion people don't have access to it, unless they travel to Chicago." 
The solution, Haynes said, is NDPHESENTS, a unique link between Notre Dame

Police: No rape drug 
involved 
Notre Dame students live in house where incident reported 
By SCOTT BRODFUEHRER 
News Writer 
The off-campus house where a 21-year old Saint Mary's student claims she was sexually assaulted Sept. 28 was inhabited by Notre Dame students, but there is no medical evidence a date rape drug was used, police said. 
The woman told police that she went to the Linebacker Lounge Sept. 27 with three other individuals, including a male friend of hers. While at the bar, she said her friend's roommate bought her drinks and they went back to their house around 3 a.m. and continued to drink. The woman said she was given a blanket and pillow to sleep on the couch, but woke up naked next to the roommate the following morning. 
She said she suspected she was sexually assaulted and that a date rape drug may have been used. 
Brent Hemmerlein, com­mander of the St. Joseph Family Violence and Special Victims unit said that a med­ical test was negative for a date rape drug. lie said he could not release information on the results of the other rape exams. The Family Violence and Special Victims

INSIDE COLUMN 


Beware the voucher 
Fall break is fast approaching and that means many of you will be heading home for the week to catch up on sleep and enjoy real food. For those of you flying, pay special attention to my story. 
It begins last 
December after final exams. The semester was over and I was ready to ditch South Bend and its crappy weather for my home in Orlando. I had booked a flight 


several months Andrew Thagard 
prior and arrived at South Bend 
Assistant
Regional Airport the prescribed two News Editor hours early. 
I checked my lug­gage, went through security, boarded the plane and began perusing the in-flight magazine. 
Then, the unexpected happened. 
I heard my name called overhead and learned that I would not be on that flight. Instead, I was being rerouted to Chicago's O'Hare Airport via bus. 
"Don't worry," the gate agent assured me. "You're being placed on a non-stop flight to Orlando, and you're receiving a free roundtrip ticket valid anywhere in the U.S." 
"Wow!" I remember thinking. "Sure the shuttle's a bit of an inconvenience but I'm not in a rush to get home and a free ticket sounds like a good deal." 
I eased the pain of the shuttle ride by creating a mental list of all the places I could potentially visit with my travel voucher. 
I got home safely, unpacked and put the voucher away in a secure place. 
If only the story ended here. Unfortunately, I made the fatal mistake of trying to use my travel voucher instead of simply framing it and hanging it up on a wall. 
Since then, I have discovered that just because I have a "travel" voucher doesn't mean I'm entitled to travel anywhere. 
For example, over the summer I tried to use the aforementioned voucher to book a flight for fall break, only to discov­er that no seats were available. I pro­ceeded to inquire about every single break we have this year. There was not a seat available for any flight I was inter­ested in over the course of the school year. 
The breaking point for me came sever­al weeks ago when I attempted to use my voucher to book a flight to Atlanta. A friend from home is getting married there at the end of January. 
"Sorry," I was told. "No seats avail­able." 
How is that possible? It's the middle of January, I called six months in advance and I was willing to fly out of South Bend or one of the Chicago airports. Something like two-thirds of all flights on the planet connect through Atlanta, there must be one seat. 
You (and US Airways) may think I've given up. No! I have made it my life's mis­sion to use this infernal voucher before it expires on Dec. 20. I don't care ifI have to fly to my departure point to take a red­eye flight to a destination I don't want to go to. I will use this voucher. 
As for the rest of you, remember my story and heed this advice: "Beware the voucher."

Bar at Unlv. of Nebraska serves oxygen 
LINCOLN, Neb.-There was no chance of students getting drunk by bellying up to a bar on the University of Nebraska-llncoln campus. 
The bar was serving bot­tled oxygen, not booze. 
''I'm not wasted," UNL stu­dent Tim Randall, 23, said after inhaling 97 -percent pure oxygen for about five minutes. ''I'm more relaxed." 
Students lined up for the chance to sit at one of three stools at student union Wednesday and inhale the oxygen scented with one of 12 aromas, including laven­der, vanilla and strawberry. 
You'd better not eat those stolen sheep 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. ­Twenty-one sheep stolen from a kudzu-munching herd might be tasty but could end up causing a big bellyache. 
The sheep were given their worm medicine one day before they were stolen last week, shepherd Meaghan Thacker said. And the worm medicine could make anyone who eats the sheep sick, she said. 
"If they haven't killed them yet, they can always bring them back," Thacker said. 
TODAY 
a:: 

The animals, valued at $2,000, are owned by New Hampshire-based Bellwether Solutions, which has a contract with the city to reduce kudzu, a fast-growing vine. A native of China, kudzu was introduced to the South 70 years ago to stop erosion-a big mistake. 
Kudzu grows at a rate of a foot a day in warm weather and chokes entire forests in weeks. Pesticides don't work well and humans tire of end­lessly hacking away amid the dense underbrush. Sheep, however, will eat it.

Founder of Habitat challenges students 

By MIKE CHAMBLISS 
News Writer 
Milton Fuller, founder of Habitat for Humanity International, addressed the Notre Dame community Saturday at the Hesburgh Library Auditorium during his visit to what he describes as "one of the most dynamic stu­dent chapters in the world." 
Fuller received a warm intro­duction from fellow humanitari­an and Medal of Freedom recip­ient, University President Emeritus Father Theodore llesburgh. 
"He took the Gospel rather seriously, sold all of his posses­sions for the poor and went to work building the kingdom," llesburgh said of Fuller. 
In his speech. Fuller told the story of Habitat's creation, relat­ing some of the program's great­est achievements. According to Fuller, the 28-year old program has provided housing for 150,000 families around the world. At a rate of one new house every 26 minutes, the program will have served 200,000 families and one million people by the year 2005.

building 100 homes. "We are making a real, concerted efli)rt to reach out to the Islamic world," he said. "We want to let them know that while we have religious differences, we don't hate them." 
Fuller emphasized the Christian message behind Habitat's work. which he calls the "theology of the hammer." 
"It's all God's idea. We are total plagiarists," he said. "Everything came out of the Bible. We don't charge interest to the poor. All we do is give our partners an opportunity and finance their house on the Bible­finance plan," 
Fuller said that the "theology of the hammer" calls lor people of all religious alliliations to lay aside their difl'erences and work together in expressing their faith and love through hard work. 
He posed a challenge to the greater South Bend community, describing a 1992 llabitat for Humanity undertaking that raised all inadequate housing to a decent level in the community where Habitat's headquarters are located. Fuller issued a simi­lar challenge to the Notre Dame chapter, the alumni group, area churches and community cen­ters to work together with 4,000 poor families residing in St. Joseph County in order to com­pletely eliminate substandard housing in this area.

continued from page 1 
The building consists of five per­forming venues -including a mainstage theater, concert hall, THX-certified cinema, organ and chorale hall and a studio theater -along with workshops for set production, offices and catering facilities. The Center is unique in that it is constructed on seven sep­arate foundations, ensuring that the different venues and scene shops will not interfere acoustically with each other. 
A long, two-tiered lobby that provides access to the five venues dominates the middle of the build­ing. The lobby, which boasts an expansive view of DeBartolo Quad and a ceiling with support beams painted gold and blue, is itself designed to serve as a venue and can accommodate up to 700 guests for black tie dinners or receptions. 
Malnstage Theater 
The Patricia George Decio Theater is the Center's mainstage theatre. It is designed to host both professional and student plays. 

"It's the first truly professional stage built on Notre Dame's cam­pus," Haynes said. "I can tell you confidently that there will not be a place within driving distance that's better to see a play." 
The theater contains a state-of­the-art performance stage with an orchestra pit. Unlike Washington Hall. the Decio stage is equipped with large wing space, ceiling gir­dles that can easily be moved and hollow spaces beneath that allow sides. 
A scene shop, with a 17 -foot high ceiling and a loading dock, is located adjacent to the stage. 
The room is capable of seating 350 patrons, including approxi­mately 7 5 in the balcony. 
"There isn't a single impediment to sight for any seat," Haynes said. 
Organ and Chorale Hall 
Adjacent to the main stage the­atre is the Center's organ and chorale hall, which will seat an audience of 100. 
The room resembles the sanctu­ary of a grand cathedral. As patrons enter the hall, their atten­tion will initially be focused on the wall opposite tbem and the one­and-a-half story organ that domi­nates it. The organ is currently being hand-made by Master Organist Paul Fritts in Tacoma, Wash. at a cost of$1 million. When complete, it will be shipped to campus and reassembled. 
"He's still making organs as they were made in the 17th and 18th centuries," Haynes said. 
The side walls of the three-story hall consist of three tiers of classic­style columns that rise to the ceil­ing, which is braced by wooden trestles that match the organ case­ment. 
The hall is unique for a perform­ing arts center, according to Haynes, and affirms Notre Dame's commitment to sacred and liturgi­cal music. Concert Hall 
The Leighton Concert Hall is the Center's largest venue and can accommodate an audience of up to 1,000. 
applied by craftsmen. When you walk into this room it will be utter­ly silent," Haynes said. "This is what acousticians call an infinitely tunable room." 
The hall will be used primarily for musical performances, includ­ing choral and orchestra concerts. The room can be configured to acoustically accommodate differ­ent types of performances from solo to large scale. 
Designers utilized the finest in acoustic technology. The floor beneath the audience is pocketed with special heating and air-condi­tioning ducts that allow air to be moved in and out in absolute silence. The upper ceiling of the hall is one foot thick to mask air traffic and includes a six inch con­crete slab, insulation, substrate roof and slate. The massive roof is supported by trestles that weigh 34,000 lbs. each. The combined weight was so great, Haynes said, that engineers were forced to pre­dict the length the trestles would slide to an eighth of an inch, then bolt one side down as the other rested on Teflon. The other side was then successfully bolted down. 
Adjoining the main concert hall is a smaller performance room that can be used for rehearsals or more intimate concerts. The room is simple in design, characterized by high windows on its west side. It will seat 70. Cinema 
Opposite the concert hall is a THX-certified cinema that can accommodate 200. The cinema is accessible via a separate entrance and will have a movie theatre style

Arafat declares emergency 
HAMALIAII. West Bank -Vasser Arafat installed an eight-member emergency Cabinet on Sunday with Ahmed Qureia as prime min­ister. an apparent attempt to deflect possible Israeli action against him following a suicide bombing a day earlier. 
Israel threatened last month to "remove" Arafat. without setting a time, and there were new demands for his expulsion after Saturday's attack by Islamic Jihad. Nineteen Israelis were killed in a crowded beachfront restaurant in the northern port city of Haifa. 
Aides to the Palestinian leader said he was clearly concerned about possible Israeli action aftnr the bombing. There was no direct move against Arafat on Sunday; instead, Israel bombed a target inside Syria that it claimed was an Islamic Jihad training base, striking deep inside its neighbor's territory Sunday for the 11rst time in three decades. 
Chechens get the vote 
GHOZNY -In their war-shattered capital and impoverished villages. Chechens voted for a president Sunday in an election condemned by critics as a sham but promoted by the Kremlin as a step toward ending a decade of violence and chaos. 
Authorities said no oflicial results would be available until Monday, but Hussian news agencies quickly reported that Kremlin­appointed Chechnya administration chief Akhmad Kadyrov appeared headed for victo­ry. as was widely expected. 
Chechen Prime Minister Anatoly Popov said preliminary results indicate Kadyrov won some 80 percent of the votes cast in 12 of 20 regions in Chechnya, ITAH-Tass reported. A candidate needs more than 50 percent to win the election outright and avoid a runoff.

Arnold ahead despite accusations 
SACHAMENTO, Calif. -Marching on the Capitol he hopes to claim in the recall elec­tion, Arnold Schwarzenegger said he sensed "an unbelievable momentum" Sunday, despite new allegations of sexual harassment and signs of a tightening race. The embattled incumbent, Gov. Gray Davis, signed a law making California the largest state to require employer-paid health care. 
A poll released over the weekend found Schwarzenegger's lead among replacement candidates waning with news of harassment claims. but the Hepublican remained ahead of the pack and voters still favored removing Davis from ollice in Tuesday's election. 
Schwarzenegger did not address the allega­tions during his march and rally at the Capitol. his only scheduled public appearance Sunday, but said Davis "has terminated opportunities and now it's time to terminate him." 

Mauled Roy in critical condition 
lAS VEGAS -Hoy Horn, the illusionist of the Siegfried & Hoy duo who was mauled by one of his tigers during a show. was able to communicate with doctors but still in critical condition and on a ventilator Sunday. 
The mauling could mean the end of one of the Las Vegas Strip's most popular shows. Its employees were encouraged to look for new jobs, and ollicials said that even if Horn recov­ers it's unclear whether he would ever be able to perform again in the rigorous show.

Syria demands UN condemnation 
Associated Press 

UNITED NATIONS Syria urged the U.N. Security Council to con­demn an Israeli airstrike on a purported terrorist camp near Damascus on Sunday, while Israel defended the attack and accused its neighbor of harboring terrorists. 
Syria's United Nations ambassador, Fayssal Mekdad, said the strike was blatant military aggression, telling an emergency meeting of the 15-member council that "Arabs and many people across the globe feel that Israel is above the law." 
The draft resolution calls for Israel to stop committing acts that could threaten regional security or expose "the already deteriorating situation in the region to dire conse­quences." 
The Israeli raid on what it claimed was an Islamic Jihad training base came in retaliation to a suicide bombing carried out by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad on Saturday. The bombing, at a restaurant in the Israeli coastal city of Haifa. killed 19 people and the bomber. EPA

IN BRIEF 
Vehicle road tests improved 
WASIIINGTON -After years of using a dry, 
mathematical formula to predict rollover risk. 
the government is adding a wheel-squealing 
road test intended to give consumers more 
information about a vehicle's handling capabili­
ties. 
Automakcrs say the road test will reward the best-handling vehicles in each class by high­lighting performance measures the formula could not assess. One example is stability con­trol. a system that applies brakes to specific tires and decelerates if it senses a driver is veering off course. 
The government's auto safety agency is con­sidering two different road tests and will announce its decision Tuesday at its test facility in Ohio. In the future. the government's five­star rating system for rollover risk will factor in both road tests results and the mathematical approach.

Proposal divides SEC officials 
Assodated Press 

WASHINGTON -After 
a series of corporate scan­
dals, the government's top 
securities regulator 
endorsed a proposal last 
year to make it easier for 
big shareholders to install 
directors on a company's 
board. 

Now, divisions have aris­en between William Donaldson, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and his fellow Republican commissioners. Also, the biggest U.S. pension funds insist the plan does not go far enough. 
Criticism also is coming from Evelyn Davis, who is known for putting Fortune 500 chief executives on the defensive at company annual meetings. She con­siders the plan to be biased in favor of large shareholders, such as pen­sion and mutual funds. 
"It's outrageous that these institutional investors would be allowed to put in directors while individual investors would be left out," Davis said.

Students riot after defeat 
Associated Press 
MANKATO, Minn. -Police arrested dozens of students during an alcohol-fueled riot in the streets following a home­coming football game loss at Minnesota State, Mankato. 
As many as 3,000 people were in a crowd that gathered Saturday night in a largely stu­dent residential area, some set­ting lire to trash bins, tearing down fences, smashing car windows and throwing rocks and bricks at officers, police said. 
Two officers retreated after reaching the scene and waited for backup. 
"When police backed off, the students were so excited because they thought they had defeated the cops," said Brian Boothe, a senior. 
Police in riot gear then used eye and skin irritants to dis­perse the crowd, and arrested 45 people. Four officers were injured by objects thrown at them, said Jim Franklin, the city's public safety director. 
The area became so danger­ous that it took an armored vehicle to pick up a student who reportedly wasn't breath­ing, Franklin said. Police also received reports of students being assaulted by fellow stu­dents. About a dozen people 
were treated for injuries at a nearby hospital. 
Franklin blamed 
alcohol  for  the  
problems.  
Witnesses  said

SALT LAKE CITY -The president and prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Sunday told members of the faith that they must "hold back the world" by resisting the everyday evil embodied in popular entertainment and the Internet. 
President Gordon Hinckley, speaking during the church's 173rd semiannual General Conference, said that while many not of the faith would support their values, "we cannot be arrogant. We can­not be self-righteous." 
The church's leader also noted he was pleased that the church-owned NBC affili­ate in Salt Lake City had refused to air a program of a "salacious nature," appar­ently referring to the net­work's new sitcom,

Texas 



primary unlikely 
Associated Press 
AUSTIN, Texas-The role of Texas in Democratic presiden­tial politics could be damaged by bitter Hepublican infighting over congressional redistrict­ing. 
As' the clock ticked Sunday without a deal on redistricting, a delay in the March 2 Texas primary became increasingly likely. 
That could leave state Democrats without much influ­ence in picking their party's nominee to challenge President Bush next year, since one of the Democratic candidates might have his party's nomination sewn up before a delayed Texas vote. 
Lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol had hoped to have an agreement in place by Saturday. No map had been filed by Sunday afternoon, and the House and the Senate left for the day. 
Gov. Rick Perry has cited Monday as the "drop dead date" for him to sign a map agreed on by lawmakers. With a required 24-hour waiting period before any map could be considered for a vote,· rhe Monday deadline was nearly impossible. 
The office of Secretary of State Geoff Connor has said the Legislature must adjourn and the bill must be signed no later than Monday to maintain the March 2 primary with new con­gressional districts. 
The Texas Senate approved the redistricting legislation Wednesday in an 18-12 vote mostly along party lines. The House adopted its own GOP­friendly map last week follow­ing two Democratic walkouts. 
Republicans, however, are arguing with themselves over the shape of three West Texas districts. House Speaker Tom Craddick, R-Midland, wants a new Midland-based district that would represent the oil and gas industry .

Hooray for the Cubs! 
Or, if they didn't win last night, "Wait 'til next year!" 
As I write early Sunday morning, either exclamation is a possibility, but 
I have to wait an  
agonizing after­noon to know.  Mike Marchand  
By the time you  
all read this on the way to class, in the dining  UndistinguishedAlumnus  
hall, or (as one  
ill-tempered  

grouch who e-mailed me recently to tell me where he read my columns) in the bathroom, the game will be over, and I will have either gotten drunk and cried (which means they lost) or just gotten drunk (which means they won). 
The devotion we have is an odd thing to explain to those people who aren't Cubs fans. Non-Cubs fans gaze upon us with an odd look on their faces, as if they were confronting a member of a masochistic religious cult, and wonder why we would waste our precious time following a team who hasn't had consecutive winning seasons in 30 years. It's as whimsical­ly illogical as dancing naked in the snow, and sometimes as painfully irra­tional as getting a tattoo in the middle of your forehead. OK, it's that painful­ly irrational often, not just sometimes. 
My best friend is a New York Yankees fan. Ordinarily, I wouldn't mind -the Yankees are a fine club, an organization so steeped in legends and traditions it's a wonder their games aren't broadcast on The History Channel. But what bothers me is that he used to be a Detroit Tigers supporter, but bailed on them because they haven't been any good in forever and turned to the Yankees just in time for them to win four World Series in five years. 
Cub fans hate bandwagon jumpers. And God willing, the Cubs will wipe out the Atlanta Braves, who started calling themselves "America's Team" when millions of fairweather nimrods started rooting for them and still refer to themselves that way even though the Yankees have supplanted them as the team most followed by mindless sheep. Choosing to cheer for the Yankees or the Braves just because they're winning is like hoping for the Harlem Globetrotters to win, or for Bugs Bunny to outwit Elmer Fudd. There's no effort required, and it upends the classic sports tradition, from Rocky to Rudy, of cheering for the underdog. 
The Cubs, meanwhile, have devoted fans despite nearly a century of futili­ty. They've lived and died with the Cubs. In fact, they've literally lived and died waiting for them to win a World Series. They last won one in 1908. That was seven papacies and 17 presidential administrations ago. That was four years before my great-grand­mother was born. 
I'm a Cubs fan because of Ron Santo, who played third base for the Cubs for 14 years and now serves as their radio announcer. Before the last game of this season, the team retired his jersey number. 
Santo has plenty of reasons to be upset. He's lost both his legs to dia­betes, he's been associated with the Cubs for 40 arduous, mostly losing seasons, and if all that weren't enough, while calling a game early this year he sat too close to a space heater and singed his toupee. And while his career was solid, since he was never a vital component of a championship dynasty, the Hall of Fame will probably never enshrine him. But he stood on the field upon

two prosthetic legs, watched a flag with his name on it take its place under Ernie Banks, and basically told Cooperstown to stick it: "That flag ... means more to me than the Hall of Fame. This is my Hall of Fame." 
I'm a Cubs fan because every game, celebrities sing "Take Me Out To The Ballgame" to honor Harry Caray, even though he died six seasons ago. I'm a Cubs fan because of Wrigley Field, which has remained essentially unchanged for decades. I'm a Cubs fan because no matter how long we wander through the desert of losing seasons, we know someday we'll reach the Promised Land. If not this year, then next year for sure. 
I'm a Cubs fan because I went to Wrigley on my 21st birthday, and even though I drank all afternoon and most of the night, I only paid for one beer the entire day. My fellow Cubs fans are that cool. 
Normally, at the end of a column such as this, I'd invite you all to watch the game with me, say at the new Hooters on Day Road, but since you all already know how it turned out, it'd be silly. So, invent a time machine, go back in time to last night, and join me in a Cubs victory.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Undergraduates deserve respect 
I don't know much about Notre Dame study-abroad programs. No, let me qualify that: most of what I know is based on participants' enthusiastic reviews, which would certainly disqualify me from expressing an opinion in Will McDonald's book acoording to his let­ter that ran Oct. 2. 
I take it that he has heard one too many undergraduates rave about his or her "ultimately hollow" experiences in Rome, London or where-have-you and would prefer that students stayed in South Bend to "pray, ponder, read, ask and wonder." He is entitled to express his view on the programs themselves, albeit (in my book) patronizingly. 
For me, however, Mr. McDonald's comments express a deeper problem with graduate students' view of undergraduates on this campus. I'm a foreign national. This is my sixth year here, and before I came here I had lived in five countries on two continents (then again, my experiences there might have been just as shallow and hollow as those of Notre Dame undergraduates studying abroad, but I leave the reader to judge). In any event, I am tired of hearing from my colleagues in the graduate school about the shallowness, cookie-eutter-ncss, Midwestern-ness, and so on of the undergradu­ates whom it is their responsibility to live among and to teach. 
Who is to say that when a given student was in Rome and eating gelato she wasn't also gaining a deeper perspective on her faith and on a different culture? More to the point, who is to say that Notre Dame students arc not perfectly well aware that "there is more out there than just Heckers, dorm parties and football"? 
I consider myself proud to have more than a few undergraduates in my acquaintance, and this has never been my experience of them. Let's look to our own narrow-mindedness before we start projecting it for others.

was moved, not out of the build­ing but into a back room where it would be out of view. 
CNN.com reported his response: "It is a sad day in our country when the moral foundation of our law and the acknowledgment of God has to be hid­den from public view to appease a fed­eral judge." 
This act of removing the command­ments was done in the name of preser­vation of church and state. I strongly support this separation. If it is not pre­served, there can be no trust in the elected officials of this country because they will not have to justify their actions in any way. 
In Ireland for most of the twentieth century, young women suspected of sexual impropriety were sent to live with the nuns and work in laundries in hard labor to atone for their sins. Many died there as old women. In Islamic countries today, women who have chil­dren out of wedlock are considered promiscuous. Those who have been raped can be murdered by a male fam­ily member, and this is called an honor killing. While this country was in its infancy, we burned and hanged men, women and children who were sus­pected of witchcraft. 
These actions were immoral and unethical, yet the officials responsible were able to claim a higher power. 
When there is no requirement of logic and sanity for judicial decisions, we enter a strange and horrible place. Any one of us, even the most religious, will admit that the Bible and other reli­gious writings can and have been inter­preted to ghastly and deadly ends. 
Separation of church and state is not so we can raise our children to be hea­thens, not because we are godless, but because government decisions need to be based on what is best for the coun­try, not what will best serve God, in whatever incarnation a government might adopt. 
To the end of keeping the church out of our state, we have begun to split hairs. Every small violation of the church being in the state has made big news and has brought out the knives of those on both sides. Last June the reli­gious and liberal frenzy was excited by the federal appeals court in California, announcing that "under God" in the pledge was unconstitutional. 
Sen. Kit Bond (R-Mo.) was quoted as saying, "Our founding fathers must be spinning in their graves. What's next? Will the courts now strip 'so help me God' from the pledge taken by presi­dents?" 
Many Liberal Democrats stood back watching their victory and nodded. Yes, there should be no mention of God in a speech or oath spoken by a president in a country where there is a separa­religious-based organization. 

There are no religious plaques in fed­eral buildings, but we quietly continue to restrict abortions and deny marital rights to homosexuals. As we wheel a big monument into a back room after driving a bunch of Christians into a religious fervor so that while their dis-world to be reborn.

Quiet 
The Red Tent
please? 
So it's the day before your test and you're looking for a nice, quiet place to study on campus, interruption-free. You ask your­self the question "Where might I be able to find a suit­

satisfac­tion?" 
Well my friends, I'm here to tell you that there isn't anywhere on campus that can fulfill this need. Although the university has designed several places that appear to be meant for quiet study, there's always that one annoying study group that ruins everything for you ... and everyone else in the study lounge. 
Sometimes it's the whole group making noise, laughing and messing around while everyone else is treating the room like the Grotto, but often enough there's the case of the single kid in the group whose parents just never got around to teaching him how to whisper. 
Personally, I like to call this kid the "loud, chubby kid with jean shorts and a cityscape T­shirt who loves to talk about capitalism's benefits," a name which was derived from a par­ticularly bad study experience of mine two weeks ago. Surprisingly though, the com­mon violators of study room eti­quette do in fact seem to have a strange fondness for nasty cargo jean shorts. 
I think the only thing worse than the single annoyance is the group who has taken on the "we're all strung out from studying so much" mentality. This is when absolutely any­thing said by anyone in the group is just unbelievably hys­terical to the other members of the group. Along with this comes the attempt at containing the laughter because the group knows they are in a quiet lounge. 
In most cases, this is even worse that open laughter because you, as the single studier, can see that the group knows they are doing some­thing inappropriate without fix­ing it. Nonetheless, this ridicu­lousness usually continues until someone says something to the group or until you decide to leave. 
As a suggestion, if you see your group digressing into this pattern, take a 15 minute break ... you need it. 
Along with such travesties comes a strange bond between all of the quiet studiers in the room. People who have never seen or talked to one another before begin to make eye con­tact and become friends, know­ing that they all have the com­monality of despising the obnoxious group in the room. Repeated looks of distress fly back and forth around the room, and thoughts of "should I say something to quiet them down" frequently run through students' heads. In most cases, however, nothing is said. 
To make sure that I was not the only one feeling this way about the situation, I decided to interview a few of my class­mates to see their perspectives. 
Junior Caroline Meehan said, "These loud studiers are the worst! The other day I flashed this group my 'You can't be serious' look five times in 15 minutes ... and you know what? They just got louder!" 
Sophomore Brian Reichart had similar things to say about this ever-present situation in the study lounges. "These groups are just frustrating. First they make you angry, but eventually break you down to the point where you want to cry and give up on all academic pursuits ... and sometimes even life itself." 
Junior Maureen Tate actually admitted that she was part of the problem, saying "You know what ... I think I might just be the kid in the cityscape shirt! Man, am I really that annoying? Wow, sorry everyone." She then proceeded to eat a quart of Ben and Jerry's Phish food in the next six minutes. 
Junior Dan Block had a unique view on the situation. "I kind of actually like these groups because they give me a good icebreaker for talking to super-hot study girls. I usually make eye-contact with them and say something like 'can you believe these guys?' From there I just approach the table and let my Dan-the-man cruise control take over." 
As a possible solution to this problem, I have laid out a list of places I believe most people view as quiet study areas on campus. These include the Como first floor lounge, the new basement of the library and every other floor of the library but the second, Bond Hall and any computer cluster. This leaves the second floor of Como, the second floor of the library, all of Lafortune, anywhere out­side and the big table in O'Shag for all of you loud studiers ... and arrogant, female, 5'7, blonde TA's who are "trying to host a TA session here." 
Now some of you might be thinking about the fact that the first floor of Coleman-Morse is labeled "social lounge." Don't worry about it; the students have converted it into a study lounge. The University can feel free to move the TV out of there at any time. . 
As you can see, group studiers, there are plenty of places for you to happily con­gregate and run amok on cam­pus while leaving adequate space for us easily distracted quiet studiers. Please take a cue and try to migrate toward some of the more acceptable places to be loud on campus ... and tuck away those jean shorts for the winter.

Thrashers player dies 6 days after car crash 
Associated Press 

ATLANTA Atlanta Thrashers forward Dan Snyder died Sunday night, six days after he was involved in a hor­rific car crash with teammate Dany Heatley. 
Snyder died at Grady Hospital from massive brain injuries without ever regaining consciousness, the team said. He was 25. 
Police said Heatley was driv­ing his Ferrari at about 80 mph on a narrow two-lane road last Monday night when he lost control, spun off the road and smashed into a brick and wrought iron fence. 
The car split in half. The players were thrown into the road. 
Heatley already was facing several charges, including a felony. 
"The charges will be upgrad­ed. It hasn't occurred yet," Sgt. John Quigley, an Atlanta Police Department spokesman said Sunday night. "I expect them to be upgraded in the near future." 
He said investigators will meet with the District Attorney's office on Monday morning. 
"It would likely be vehicular homicide first degree." Quigley said. 
Snyder underwent surgery for a skull fracture but never emerged from his coma. 
"We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Dan Snyder," the Thrashers said in a state­ment. "Dan was a teammate and friend to all of us. We feel a tremendous amount of pain as an organization and extend deepest sympathies to his fam­ily." 
Snyder, a center who had 10 goals and four assists in 36 games for Atlanta last season, had surgery on his ankle in September before the start of 
cheeks, then gamely clapped along with the crowd. 
"All those girls in the stands, that's the legacy," Hamm said. 
Time after time, maybe this was the greatest game ever played' in women's soccer." 

Hamm and the rest of the aging core of U.S. players had wanted so badly to go out with another Cup triumph this year and then Olympic gold in 2004. Now only the games in Athens provide an attainable goal. After that, Hamm will retire. 
"It was a hard loss because of the way it went down," U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry said. 
"They were bending and bend­ing, but they didn't break." 
Kerstin Garefrekes' header off Renate Lingor's corner kick glanced off the crossbar and into the net in the 15th minute, then the Germans withstood one U.S. threat after another. 
Two goals in the final two minutes sealed the win. Fittingly, they came from German stars Maren Meinert and Birgit Prinz. 
Meinert, the MVP of the 
WUSA professional soccer league this year in its final season, had planned to retire but was coaxed back to the national team. Prinz scored seven of Germany's 23 goals in its five World Cup matches. 
"Everybody had a chance," Prinz said, "and I think in the end we were lucky and we fin­ished our chances. We were totally excited to beat the U.S. We usually lose important games to them." 
Hamm and her teammates threat­ened only to be thwarted by the spectacular play of goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg and the rest of the German defenders. "We brought our 'A' game in terms of the attacking," U.S. coach April Heinrichs said. "That's a great team we played. I've got to think tha·t  BREAK OUT OF THE BUBBLE TAKE THE URBAN PLUNGE  
training camp. He was expect­ed to start the season on the injured list. Snyder signed with the Thrashers as a free agent in 1999 after playing four sea­sons of junior hockey for Owen Sound in the Ontario Hockey League. He spent most of his first three professional seasons in the minor leagues, helping Orlando win the International Hockey League title in 2000­01 and playing on the Chicago Wolves' American Hockey League championship team in 2001-02. He also played 35 games for Chicago last season, getting 11 goals and 12 assists.  Immerse yourself in the realities of urban poverty.

Special to The Observer 
The Irish started and ended their preseason with a 5-3 win over the Western Ontario Mustangs Friday night at the Joyce Center. 
The Irish got goals from five different players in the victory and solid goaltending from sophomore Rory Walsh and freshman David Brown as the duo combined to turn away 33 of 36 Western Ontario shots in the game. Senior right wing Rob Globke scored the game-win­ning goal just 15 seconds into the third period when he deflected a Neil Komadoski shot past Mustangs' goaltender Mike D'Alessandro to give the Irish a 4-2 lead on the way to the 5-3 win. 
"All-in-all, this was a good game to get over with," Irish coach Dave Poulin said. "Western Ontario is a veteran team. Most of their players have played major junior hockey. 
When you get a chance to schedule a strong team like this it gives you an opportunity to see your team perform." 
The Irish came out strong, outshooting the Mustangs, 17­11, in the first stanza while tak­ing a 3-1 lead. Brad Wanchulak started the scoring when he tucked a rebound of Chris Trick's point shot under D'Alessandro at 3:55 of the first period. 
Western tied the game at 5:01 · when Mike Rice controlled a rebound in front and flipped the puck past Rory Walsh to even the score. 
Notre Dame would get the lead back just 29 seconds later when Mike Walsh steered a Brett Lebda shot past D'Alessandro for his first of two points on the night. The Irish would get their lone power-play goal (in 10 chances) of the night at 16:39 with Tim Wallace cash­ing in off assists from Mike Walsh and Brett Lebda for a 3-1 lead at the first intermission. 
The Mustangs cut the lead to 3-2 with the lone goal of the sec­ond period as Jeff Martin beat Brown at 19:01 on just the third shot he faced in the period after replacing Rory Walsh with 9:51 left in the middle stanza. 
Globke, who along with Neil Komadoski was selected alter­nate team captain Thursday, gave the Irish their two-goal cushion just 15 seconds into the third period. Parked about 10 feet in front of D'Alessandro, Globke deflected a Komadoski shot from the center point to make it 4-2. 
An Irish turnover led to Western Ontario's third goal. Ryan Held knocked down Brown's clearing attempt on the right wing boards and was able to get a shot on goal before Brown could reposition himself. Held's shot got between Brown and the near post at 10:36. 
Freshman T.J. Jindra then got the insurance goal for the Irish when he and Tony Gill combined effort to bring in gritty, tough, on a two-on-one at 13:28 for the in-your-face players. Kids like 5-3 final score. T.J. Jindra, Jason Paige and 

"We really played hard and Matt Williams-Kovacs are those that's what I want to see," said kinds of players. They bring that Poulin. "We made a conscious style to the rink every day."

Irish beat two Big East foes 
By HEATHER VAN 
HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame continued its dom­ination in Big East play this weekend. 
Saturday saw the Irish shut out St. John's (18-5, 0-1). 3-0. Sunday, the Irish defeated Connecticut (11-7, 1-1) three games to one. 
Against St. John's, No. 17 Notre Dame (12-2, 4-0) turned in its best hitting performance of the season, hitting .369 on the match. Setter Kristen Kinder orchestrated the offense with 45 assists. 
Emily Loomis was once again one of Kinder's favorite targets, as she hit .500 with 16 kills. Loomis has been outstanding this season, hitting .500 or better in three matches already. Saturday's match was her 19th consecutive match with 10 or more kills, a streak that dates back to last year. 
Sophomore middle blocker' Lauren Kelbley continued her play of late, hitting .429 with 11 kills. Senior Katie Neff hit in dou­ble digits as well, with 10 kills. 
Senior outside hitter Jessica Kinder also added to the offen­sive explosion, with eight kills on .368 hitting. 
Since switching back to a S-1 rotation that they used last sea­son, the Irish have upped their hitting percentage to .319, after hitting .231 with the 6-2 rotation. 
However, the Irish have once again found strength in their blocking. They are ranked third in the nation in blocks per game, with 3.33. Saturday saw the Irish record 10 blocks on the match. 
Defensively, Meg Henican led the team with 14 digs, her eighth consecutive match with at least 12 digs. Freshman Danielle Herndon also had 11 digs for the Irish. 
Before Saturday, the Red Storm led the Big East in hitting percentage (.272) and opponent hitting percentage (.143). However, the Irish reversed that trend on them, hitting .226 high­er than their previous opponent. 
Notre Dame had a strong showing Sunday as we.ll, defeat­ing Connecticut (30-22, 20-30, 30-28, 30-18). 
Lauren Brewster matched her career high with 17 kills, and set a career high with .596 hitting percentage. She had one error in 27 attempts. Brewster leads the conference in blocks, and she was in on eight against the Huskies. 
However, the Irish hitters were not the story of this match, as the Notre Dame defense shined. Defensively, the Irish registered 88 digs as a team, with five play­ers having 10 or more. 
Henican once again led the way for the Irish, with 20 digs. This was the second best per­formance of her career. Jessica Kinder also played well again, with 19 digs. 
Loomis got in on the defensive action as well, as she set a career high with 17 digs. She is new to the back row, since in the old 6-2 alignment, she rarely played defense. In the last 15 games, however, she has been steady, with 41 digs. 
Herndon had 14 digs and set­ter Kristen Kinder added 10.

Special to The Observer 

The Notre Dame men's tennis team finished strong in the Tom Fallon Invitational, winning seven of 10 singles matches Sunday at the Eck Tennis Pavilion and. Courtney Tennis Center. The Irish, who post­ed a combined 26-14 record in the 17th annual event, will return to action Friday, Oct. 17 in an exhibition match against rival USC at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
Four Notre Dame players were unbeaten in the tour­nament, with a pair of them posting singles victories Sunday. Freshman Ryan Keckley was the only Notre Dame player to go 5-0 over the weekend.

Junior Jimmy Bass, who competed only in singles in the Tom Fallon, beat Army's David Collins 6-0, 6-1 Sunday for his third win of the weekend. Bass is 5-1 this fall. 
Also perfect on the week­end were a pair of tri-cap­tains in senior Matthew Scott and junior Brent D'Amico. Scott won a pair of matches in both singles and doubles to improve to 8-2 and 4-1, respectively, this season. 
D'Amico returned to the court for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in June. He won in his only two matches, both in doubles. 
Senior tri-captain Luis Haddock, ranked 64th in the nation in singles, pulled out a 1-6, 6-0, 1-0 (15-13) deci­sion against John Sabia of Army. Haddock finished his Tom Fallon Invitational career with a combined sin­gles and doubles record of 26-3. He was 16-1 in singles and 10-2 in doubles. 
Freshman Stephen Bass won four of his five matches, culminating with a 6-0, 7-6 (7-3) triumph over Army's Rafael Albornoz. Bass is 5-1 in singles and 4-0 in doubles in his young collegiate career.

continued from page 24 
Heading into the weekend, the Irish expected a Big East showdown that would go a long way to deciding who would win the Mid-Atlantic Division. They just did not expect it to be their game against Villanova. 
After thoroughly dominating No. 5 West Virginia Friday night in a 2-0 win that was not as close as the score would indi­cate, the Irish struggled against Villanova but eventually pre­vailed in overtime 1-0. 
"We had a hard one Friday night that took a lot of our legs, and we just didn't have as much energy as we'd have liked," said senior Kim Carpenter after the Irish survived Villanova. "We got the result that we wanted, so I guess that's what is impor­tant in the long run. 
With the two wins, the Irish move to 11-0-1 on the season and 2-0 in the Big East. The No. 2 Irish arc firmly in the driver's seat, having knocked otT the two teams that are most likely to challenge them for the division title. 
"Opening up the Big East with two of the better teams in the conference was a great way to start," Irish coach Randy· Waldrum said. "We've played some good competition to be put in this position before, and I think that helps you down at the end of the road." 
The Irish continued to domi­nate defensively, having now shut out their last three oppo­nents. In addition, they contin­ued their streak of not allowing more than two shots on goal by their opponents to nine games, as the Mountaineers and Wildcats only managed one apiece. 
The Irish opened the scoring early against West Virginia. Senior defender Melissa Tancredi sent a long pass from the right side to junior Mary Boland. whose shot sent the ball into the upper right side of the net only 84 seconds into the game. 
The Irish added another goal early in the second half. with senior Amy Warner forcing a corner kick. Tancredi deflected Katie Thorlakson's cross to Carpenter, who scored her third goal of the season to provide the final margin for the Irish. 
The Irish had some tense moments against Villanova, playing to a scoreless tie in reg­ulation. While they outshot the Wildcats 14-4 in the regular

Meagher was fol­lowed by junior Megan Johnson, who finished in 21st with a time of 18:00. Sophomore Jean Marinangeli, who was signifi­cantly behind Johnson as far as placing goes, rounded out the scoring top five for the Irish. The sophomore's time of 18:24 put her in 42nd place.

Last season, the Irish finished third at the same meet, a per­formance that -according to Connelly -wasn't impressive. But by the season's end, the Irish were third in the nation. 
"A couple of the kids who ran great for us [at the National Championships[ in November didn't run very well for us here a year ago," Connelly said. "It's really hard to guess as to where you are."

period, they failed to create as many good scoring opportuni­ties as in some previous games. 
Villanova threatened to take the lead in the first half, scoring an apparent goal 14 minutes into play that was waved off because of an offside penalty. About 10 minutes into the sec­ond half, the Irish also had a goal nullified because of being offside. 
"It's hard to play back-to­hack," Carpenter said. "We had a lot of people that went the full 90 minutes, and it's hard espe­cially against a team as physical as Villanova. They got on us early."

much-needed road win. They got it in their fifth shutout of the sea­son. 
For the second straight game, Notre Dame goalkeeper Chris Sawyer only needed to make two saves in the contest. His Pittsburgh counterpart Justin Lowery had to make nine. 
"Shutting a team out is defi­nitely one of the most important goals for this team," Richards said. "We figure that once we've scored one goal, no team should be able to beat us." 
The Irish outshot the Panthers 13-5 in the contest, and led in corner kicks 8-2, again dominat­ing the offensive stats. This time, however, they also ended up leading on the scoreboard, thanks to seniors Justin Detter and Chad Riley. 
Riley had a goal and an assist, to lead the team with three points. 
Notre Dame scored its first 
goal of the game just three min­utes in when Riley's corner kick was headed down by Kevin Goldthwaite. Goldthwaite headed the ball right to Detter's foot, and the senior forward kicked it into the net for his fourth goal of the season. 
"It's especially big on the road to score the first goal, because it kind of demoralizes the home team," Richards said. "It really takes the crowd out of the game." 
The Irish maintained their one­goal lead into the second half, until Riley put the game away for his team in the 62nd minute. 
Riley took a long shot from over 20 yards out and knocked it past Lowery. It was the senior's first goal of the season, while his assist on Detter's goal was his sixth of the year. 
Fellow seniors Greg Martin and Richards assisted on Riley's goal.

Belles slip up in defeat to Kalamazoo 
ByJUSTIN SCHUVER Sports Writer 
This was not the way Saint Mary's wanted to start the second half of its conference season. 
The Belles (10-9, 2-6 in MIAA) were unable to ever take control of their game Saturday on the road against 
"We just didn't come out to play," Belles coach Julie Schroeder-Biek said. "It was a really tough match to watch." 
The Belles hit an abysmal .014 in the match, and no player scored in the double digits for kills. Kalamazoo col­lected 45 kills to the Belles' 20. 
"This game was probably more a matter of not taking care of the mental aspect," Schroeder-Biek said. "We had a lot of little mental break­downs." 
The Belles committed 18 errors in the match. 
with seven kills and four kills, respectively. Defensively, Ann Cusack led with 20 digs, and Alison Shevik followed closely behind with 19. 
Earlier in the season, the Belles defeated the Hornets at home in five sets, but in this game they were simply unable to mount a comeback against 
Kalamazoo after 
dropping the 
first game.

said. "It was just

game. 

"We didn't talk as a team and didn't do any of the little things right that you have to do to win." 
The Belles will have Monday off before facing conference opponent Calvin at home Tuesday. Schroeder-Biek says her team will make the most of their practice time before that game. 
"There's a lot of things we can fix that we did wrong against Kalamazoo," she said. "When we don't communi­cate, we begin to splinter."

making his debut with the Irish, put himself in 12th place with his time of 24:56. 
"Benninger, oh my golly ­what a terrific race for a fresh­man," Piane said of his team's new asset. 
Senior and former All­American Todd Mobley was third for Notre Dame and 15th overall. At the same race last year Mobley finished third, but he was plagued by an injury for much of the second half of the season and is still on the road to returning to his old form. 
"Mobley will get better," Piane said. "He's just coming back, but he looked pretty solid today .... If we have a healthy Mobley, we're going to be pretty good." 
Even though Mobley did not finish as well as he did last sea­son, the Irish are currently in a much better position than they were at the same point last sea­son, according to Piane. In fact, the coach thinks the team is "way ahead." 
"The kids all had very good summers," Piane said. "We're deeper than we've been in years. That just means the 18th guy is pushing the 17th and right on down." 
To illustrate the great improve­ments the Irish harriers have made, Piane cites sophomore Sean O'Donnell, who finished 20th overall and fourth for the team. 
"How about O'Donnell where was he a year ago? lie's just improved by leaps and bounds," Piane said. "We had a lot of good performances. If you look at who was six, seven. eight and nine-we're going to get a lot better." 

O'Donnell was followed by sophomore Kaleb Van Ort, senior Brian Kerwin and juniors Eric Morrison and Ryan Johnson. 
In the Gold race for the junior varsity runners, the Irish took second place. The less experi­enced Irish squad was led by sophomore Vinnie Ambrico. 
"Ambrico ran great in the Uun­ior varsity] race. Slip him in [the varsity lineup], and we'll be even better."

Steatnrolling ahead 
Irish trounce No.5 
West Virginia, edge 
Villanova in overtime 
By ANDY TROEGER Sports Wrirer 

Heading into the weekend, the Irish expected a Big East showdown that would go a long way to deciding who would win the Mid-Atlantic Division. They just did not expect it to be their game against Villanova. 
After thoroughly dominating No. 5 West Virginia Friday night in a 2-0 win that was not as close as the score would indicate, the Irish struggled against Villanova but eventually prevailed in overtime 1-0. 
"We had a hard one Friday night that took a lot of our legs, and we just didn't have as much energy as we'd have liked," said senior Kim
.­
Carpenter after the Irish sur­vived Villanova. "We got the result that we wanted, so I guess that's what is important in the long run. 
With the two wins. the Irish move to 11-0-1 on the season and 2-0 in the Big East. The No. 2 Irish are firmly in the dri­ver's seat, having knocked off

Irish beat Panthers on road 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associare Sporrs Ediror 

Notre Dame made a state­ment early and then added an exclamation point at the end as the Irish defeated Pittsburgh on the road Sunday in a key Big East game. 
The No.4 Irish (7-1-3, 3-1-1 in Big East) scored less than three minutes into the game and added some insurance later to come away with a 2-0 win against the Panthers (3-8­0, 1-4-0). 
The Irish came into the game having lost to the Panthers in the last two matches against the teams. Notre Dame's last win against Pittsburgh came on Oct. 13, 1996. 
"I thought this was a very big win," senior defender Kevin Richards said. "We haven't beaten Pitt in a while. so it was a big win for the pro­gram." 
Coming off a 1-1 tie to Syracuse Thursday despite dominating the Orangemen offensively, the Irish were hoping to come away with a

No.2 women excel at home

The second-ranked Irish, competing with their two top runners for the first time this season, showed their prowess as they stormed through the muddy Burke Memorial Golf Course to take first place at the 48th annual Notre Dame Invitational among a competi­tive field. 
The Irish were led by one of their younger, though not inex­perienced, runners -sopho­more Molly Huddle. As was common last year, Huddle was closely followed by junior Lauren King, who took second place. The former All­Americans completed the soggy course in 17:12 and 17:24, respectively. 

Irish coach Tim Connelly, who said he expected a victory, was nevertheless impressed with Notre Dame's performance, par­ticularly since the team was still without two of its key athletes. 
"I knew we'd be really good with the first three [runners]," Connelly said. "We were actual­ly really good with our first four. I knew [the fifth spot on the team] might be a little iffy, and it was. We didn't have [senior] Maggie Nelson in there. We did­n't have [sophomore] Stephanie

Men ease through competition 
By JOE LINDSLEY Sports Wrirer 
While Eastern Michigan's Gavin Thompson took the indi­vidual spotlight at the 48th annual Notre Dame Invitational Friday, the Irish rolled through the muddy Burke Memorial golf course to take the team title at their namesake race. 
Last year at the same race, the Irish finished third on their home course behind Stanford and Michigan. The Cardinal was not present Friday, but the Irish, ranked 25th nationally, finished ahead of No. 29 Eastern Michigan, No. 12 Michigan and No. 7 Central Michigan. Michigan, with 92 points, fmished second to Notre Dame's 76 points. Eastern Michigan claimed third with 128. 
Irish coach Joe Piane natu-rally was pleased with the vic­tory. 


"It's the way you hoped it would go," he said. "We had a group of four kids that really did kind of work together pret­ty well through the first three miles, and they need to stay together a little longer." 
The Irish, who were running with their full battery of talent for the first time this season, were led by a sophomore and a freshman. Tim Moore finished in third with his time of 24:34. and freshman Kurt Benninger,
