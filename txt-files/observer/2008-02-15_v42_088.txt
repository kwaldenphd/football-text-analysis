Parents arrive at University for JPW 
By ELLYN MICHALAK 
News Writer 

This weekend, for the 56th consecutive year, the parents of Notre Dame juniors will visit eampus to get a glimpse of what their child's life is like while they are away from home dur­ing the annual .Junior Parents' Weekend (JPWI. 
JPW began in 1952 when University president emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh decided parents should become more involved in their students' lives at Notre Dame before the following year's graduation cer­emony. 
Every year, attendance for the event has grown and this year's JPW committee expects approx­imately 1, 7 50 parents to visit the campus this weekend. 

"Though the scale has changed, the core purpose of JPW has remain unchanged ­that is, giving parents an oppor­tunity to share the social, aca­demic, spiritual and residential life of University with their stu­dents," JPW co-chair Brian Fremeau said. 
He and fellow co-chair Leah Miller have been working hard to plan the event since April of last year. After months of prepa­ration, Miller said she is looking forward to the event with feel-

Lecture fights Muslim stereotypes 
Professor, international student talk about religious aspect ofhijab, burqa 
By NIKKI TAYLOR 
News Writer 

Dr. Fozia S. Qazi, a Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership (CWIL) Fellow and professor of mathematics, spoke along with Razia Stanikzai, a Saint Mary's senior international student from Afghanistan, about the western world's thoughts on Muslim women Thursday in the Student Center. 
The lecture, entitled "The 'Other' Veil: Muslim Women in the Western Mind," was a part of the Diverse Students' Leadership Conference (DSLC) hosted by the Student Diversity Board which has taken place at the College this week. 
The lecture's main focus addressed the way Muslim women are portrayed to the Western world. Qazi began by showing pic­tures of Muslim women who break the stereotypes. 
"The prevalent stereotype of Muslim women is homogeneity, but there is a great deal of diversi­ty," Qazi said. 
The Muslim practice of veiling is often associated with the oppres­sion of women in the Western mindset, Qazi said. She first showed how veiling is a fairly com­mon practice and is not as.o;;ociated with oppression in other settings. 
Most religions have some sort of veiling, Qazi said. Jewish women are often depicted wearing veils, as is the VIrgin Mary in Christian art. 
Veiling goes back to the days of colonization in the Middle East. Before the Europeans could colo­nize they had to see the natives as inferior and uncivilized as a ration­alization of their taking over, Qazi said. 
Stanikzai spoke about hijab, which is the Afghani practice of wearing a veil. Hijab literally tra.n.o;;lates "to hide from view," but it also means separation from something negative between you and your spiritual goal. 
A part of hijab is the burqa, which is traditionally associated with Afghan women. Many women in Afghanistan were forced to wear a burqa by the Taliban regime, which is part of

shooting 
Students ask question, "Could it happen here?" 
ByJOHN TIERNEY 
News Writer 
Notre Dame students expressed sadness and shock Thursday night at yesterday's shooting at Northern Illinois. The tragedy, in which at least six people, including the gun­man, were killed and 17 were injured, occurred in a lecture hall less than three hours away from Notre Dame's campus. 
Although this generation of Notre Dame students has grown up with school shoot­ings ranging from Columbine in 1999 to Virginia Tech last year, stu­dents haven't become immune to the tragedy of school massacres. 
"It was very tragic and scary. You have to wonder what's going on with those kids. It makes you wonder if something like that could happen at Notre Dame," sophomore Tim Nelson said. 
Many students had not heard of the shooting by Thursday evening, including a group of seniors who stood speechless after being informed of the news. 
Student body president Liz Brown noted that school shootings are becoming

over. 
Thankfully. 
Now we have all the time in the 
world to focus on the next religious 
and commercial holiday that will be 
celebrated on campus. And celebrate 
we will. 
Bring on St. Patrick's Day. 
This year marks the first year that the holiday does not fall during the time allotted by the University for spring break since 2005. Originally, this year's spring break was not scheduled for March 1-9, but the University changed the dates because they were in conflict with Holy Week and the Easter holiday. 
Therefore, students will be able to celebrate the traditionally Irish holi­day with their fellow Irish-faithful at both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
Now, this inside column is not going to turn into the places and ways you can cnlebrate that one day, but rather, I am here to let you know of the incredible idea that our Irish brethren have adopted for this year, and this year only, of celebrating for TWO days. 
The Irish Bishops announced in July of 2007 -see how late I am in letting you all know about this opportunity! -that because March 17 is the sec­ond day of Holy Week, the most holy week in the Catholic calendar, they are shifting religious celebrations for St. Patrick's Day to March 15. 
If you can do quick math in your head I know that you are already smiling. If you can't and had to check your cell phone calendar like I did, let me save you the trouble. 
The Irish Bishops have moved St. Patrick's Day to March 15­Saturday, March 15. 
The Council of Bishops in the United States have not made a similar decla­ration of shifting the feast day to the previous Saturday, and I'm not sure if they are planning on doing so. Therefore I don't think that we should exclusively celebrate St. Patrick's Day on March 15. 
Instead, I propose that we students spend two days celebrating the patron saint of Ireland who intro­duced the concept of the Trinity to the Irish people using the three leaves of a clover in whatever way you deem tilting. 
Whether you plan to wear a bit of green, speak with an Irish brogue, attend a St. Patrick's Day parade or partake in some green beverages, I hope that you enjoy yourselves on the upcoming holiday. 
Aftnrall, who is more entitled to cel­ebrate St. Patrick's Day than those who call themselves the Fighting Irish.

Police say Abercrombie also smashed a glass over the bartender's ear and head.

Sophomore student board holds events for parents' weekend 
By SARAH MAYER News Writer 
While most Saint Mary's students had the all-school formal and Diverse Students' Leadership Conference to break the monotony of winter, the sophomore class has an 
additional activity to keep things interesting 
Sophomore Parents' Weekend, which starts today and l a s t s through Sunday. 
The soph­
o m o r e board has planned the weekend for about two months 
and some of the events have been booked for a year, sophomore class president Camille Gebert said. 
"It has been a lot of hard work, but it will definitely be a fun weekend," Gebert said. 
About 200 parents will come to campus this week­end, Gebert said. 
There will be a few scheduled events, Gebert said, but she didn't want parents and students to run from place to place. 
"It's important to have a parent~ weekend because it's nice to be able to show your parent's what your life is like at school," she said. "It's nice to share a week­end of events

T h e first planned event is a meet and greet with pro­fessors taking place this afternoon. Parents will be able to purchase t-shirts and visit the bookstore, while they meet professors and listen to a performance from Saint Mary's a Cappel­la group, Bellacappella. 
For Saint Mary's women whose mothers also attend­ed Saint Mary's, there are two legacy receptions Friday and Saturday. The weekend's signature event, mass at the Church of Loretto, and a formal din­ner at the Century Center will take place on Saturday night. 
"This is by far the week­end's biggest event," Gebert said 
The dinner will include a silent auction and a raffle for baskets made by the sophomore board, parents and friends of the College. 
The weekend is about strengthening the relation­ships of Saint Mary's soph­omores and their parents, Gebert said. 
"I hope that this weekend brings a sense of unity and bonding between the daughters and their par­ents," Gebert said. "As we are growing up fast, and maturing into women, it's important that our parents be witnesses to this growth." 
Sophomore Kate Ortigara is excited for her parents to see the campus. 
"I hope my parents get a better sense of my lifestyle here and see the Saint Mary's atmosphere," Ortigara said.

put it all out on the table and let the chips fall where they may." 
Heish and Schmidt launched their campaign in September and have spent much of the year campaign­ing. 
"I think this is something that we've been planning for and that we were ready for to happen," Schmidt said. "We both didn't know what the results would be and we are looking forward to April 1 !when we take olTice)." 
According to Reish and Schmidt, they were able t'o attract voters with a plat­form filled with well­researched ideas and a com­prehensive campaign that included the Web site, bobandgrant.com. 
"Part of the campaign was connecting to the students and trying to make sure that wn're not any better than anyone else," Schmidt said. "The bobandgrant.com thing, a lot of people laughed at it, but it was something different -an informal way of presenting our ideas that was appealing." 
Once they take office, Reish and Schmidt say they will immediately begin to implement their platform, as well as accept student feed­back. 
"Day one we want to start connecting more to the stu­dent body," Reish said. "Gather our team and staff together and day one start with our initiatives and also connect to our student body to see what initiatives they want to see done." 
One of those initiatives they hope to accomplish soon is making DVD rentals in the Huddle free. But the pair also hopes that, over their year in office, they can significantly improve the overall life of the student body. 
"All of our ideas are researched and most of them can be implemented pretty quick. I think the free DVDs is going to happen quickly," Schmidt said. "Now that it's all said and done. I hope stu­dents realize that we truly 
do  want to  make  a  differ­ 
ence."  
After  learning  of  their  

defeat, Braun and Chamberlain gave a lot of credit to their opponents for the strong campaign they ran. 
"[Reish and Schmidt) defi­nitely ran a great cam­paign," Chamberlain said. "We just focused on running our campaign throughout the process. The student body made their choice, and looking back on it, even before we knew the final result, I think the student body is going to be in pretty good shape." 
After Monday's election, the pair realized that they needed to change their strat­egy. "What we did is took a look at our platform and looked at areas of weakness and prepared for the debate on Wednesday," Braun said. "By no means did we resign ourselves to the fact that it was over but we did realize that there were better ways to handle it. Hopefully we demonstrated that." 
Reish and Schmidt's victory also marked a change in a trend in student government dating back through the past four administrations in which either the student body vice president or the executive assistant to the president had won the top office the following year. 
When asked how he felt about being the person to finally break this trend, Reish responded he thinks 
the student body needed a fresh perspective and hopes to be part of the team that will accomplish that. 
Braun said she knew her current position as student body vice president did not guarantee her victory in this year's election. 
"We came in here approaching the campaign with the sense that nothing is guaranteed," she said. "The fact that it didn't work out for us proves that legacy is not the end-all-be-ali. That's probably the way it should be. In this ease I'm a firm believer in the idea that things have a way of work­ing themselves out, and it's for the best of the student body." 
Both Braun and Chamberlain said they do not know what they plan to do next, although Chamberlain said that right now he is just focused on getting through Junior Parents' Weekend. 
"I think that when God closes one door he opens a new window, and what that is, I don't know yet, but I'm excited to l'ind out," Braun said.

"Primaries are tough," said McCain, refer­ring to their earlier rancor. "We know it was a hard campaign and now we move forward, we move forward together for the good of our party and the nation."

Water deal could face renegotiation

The compact, signed by the governors of' the eight Groat Lakes states in 2005, would prohibit most diversions of water from the region's drainage basin and require each state to regulate water usP. 
It needs approval from the states' legislatures and Congress to take efl'eet. Minnesota and Illinois have ratified the compact, which supporters describe as essential to prevent Great Lakes water from someday being sent to thirsty Sun Belt states. 
Clinton's black supporters waver 
"You've got to represent the wishes ofyour constituency," says defecting superdelegate 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -In a fresh sign of trouble for Hillary Rodham Clinton, one of the former first lady's congressional black supporters intends to vote for Barack Obama at the Democratic National Convention, and a second, more prominent lawmaker is openly discussing a pos­sible switch. 
Rep. David Scott's defec­tion and Rep. John Lewis' remarks highlight one of the challenges confronting Clinton in a campaign that pits a black man against a woman for a nomination that historically has been the exclusive property of white men. 
"You've got to represent the wishes of your con­stituency," Scott said in an interview Wednesday in the Capitol. "My proper posi­tion would be to vote the wishes of my constituents." The third-term lawmaker represents a district that gave more than 80 percent of its vote to Obama in the Feb. 5 Georgia primary.

IN BRIEF Bernanke calls economy "sluggish" 
NEW YOHK -Wall Street retreated Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke predicted a "sluggish" economy until later in the yoar and more mortgagn­relatnd losses at banks. The Dow Jones indus­trial average fell 175 points. 
Though the Fed chairman's comments sug­gested the central bank is still open to further interest rate reductions, the tone was, as expocted, sombor. Bernanke said the housing and credit crises have weighed on the econo­my and curbed hiring. If the job market deteri­orates, consumer spending, which is crucial for economic growth, will keep dwindling. 
The Labor Department said Thursday the number of workers filing unemployment claims fell 9,000 to 348,000 last week. But after the January jobs report that showed the first net jobs loss in more than four years, Wall Street remains worried that businesses are becoming cautious about hiring and that unemployment will compound the debt prob­lems that have been slamming the markets and the greater economy. . 
After three strong days on Wall Street, investors found scant encouragement in Bernanke's testimony and cashed in their gains. 
Swiss develop underwater convertible 
GENEVA -OK. so the Swiss have invented a car that runs on land and underwater. But did they HEALLY have to make it a convertible?

That fictional vehide travelod on land and. when chased by bad guys in a helicopter, plunged into the water and became an airtight submarine -complete with "torpedoos" and "depth charges." 
But "Q" isn't responsible for this one. 
The concept car -which unlike Bond's is not armed -was developed by Swiss designer Rinspend Inc. and is set to make a splash at the Gennva Auto Show next month. 
Company CEO Frank Rinderknecht, a self-pro­fessed Bond fan, said he has been waiting 30 years to recreate the car he saw Roger Moore use to drive off of a dock. 
FEMA trailers fail safety tests 
Agency to rush Katrina victims out of 35,000 units and into temporary housing 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS-After downplaying the risks for months, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Thursday it will rush to move Gulf Coast hurricane victims out of roughly 35,000 govern-ment-issued trailers· because tests found dan­gerous levels of formalde­hyde fumes. 
FEMA Administrator R. David Paulison said the agency hopes to get every­one out and into hotels, motels, apartments and other temporary housing by the summer, when the heat and stuffy air could worsen the problem inside the trailers. 
"The real issue is not what it will cost but how fast we can move people out," he said. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said fumes from 519 tested trailers and mobile homes in Louisiana and Mississippi were, on aver­age, about five times what people are exposed to in most modern homes.

5 killed, 16 injured in university shooting 
Gunman dressed in black opened fire in Northern Illinois lecture hall with shotgun, handguns; four died on scene 

Associated Press 
DEKALB -A former student dressed in black opened fire with a shotgun and two handguns from the stage of a lecture hall at Northern Illinois University on Thursday, killing five students and injuring 16 others before commit­ting suicide, authorities said. 
The gunman fatally shot four women and a man in a "brief, rapid-fire assault" that sent terri­fied students running for cover, uni­versity President John Peters said. Four died at the scene, including the gunman, and the other two died at a hospital, he said. Two vic­tims were in critical condition. 
Investigators did not know what led the gunman, a former NIU graduate student in sociology, to spray bullets at the geology class instructor and dozens of students in the large hall around 3 p.m. 
"I kept thinking, "Oh God, he's going to shoot me. Oh God. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead,"' said Desiree Smith, a senior journalism major who dropped to the floor near the back of the auditorium. 
"People were crawling on each other, trampling each other," she said. "As I got near the door, I got up and I started running." 
Officials said 162 students were registered for the class but it was unknown how many were there Thursday. 
Lauren Carr said she was sitting in the third row when she saw the shooter walk through a door on the right-hand side of the stage, point­ing a gun straight ahead. 
"I personally Army-crawled halfuray up the aisle," said Carr, a 20-year-old sophomore. "I said I could get up and run or I could die here." 
She said a student in front of her was bleeding, "but he just kept run­ning." 
"I heard this girl scream, 'Run, he's reloading the gun."' 
Student Jerry Santoni was in a back row when he saw the gun­man enter a service door to the stage. 
"I saw him shoot one round at the teacher," he said. "After that, I proceeded to get down as fast as I could." 
Santoni dived down, hitting his head the seat in front of him, leav­ing a knot about half the size of a pingpong ball on hi'> forehead. 
The teacher, a graduate student, was wounded but was expected to recover, the school president said. He did not give details of the i11iuries. 
Peters said the gunman was not currently enrolled at the 25,000­student campus about 65 miles west of Chicago. . 
"It appears he may have been a student somewhere else," University Police Chief Donald Grady said. 
Seventeen victims were brought to nearby Kishwaukee Community Hospital, where one died, accord­ing to spokeswoman Theresa Komitas. School officials said four people, including the gunman, died at the lecture hall and two later died at hospitals. 
Michael Gentile was meeting with two of his students directly beneath the lecture hall when the shootings happened. He could hear the chaos a few feet above his head. 
"The shotgun blast must have been so loud," said Gentile, a 27­year-old media studies instructor. "It sounded like something was dropping down the stairs ... We had no idea what this was." 
Then, shorter, sharper noises he recognized as handgun shots. 
"There was a pretty quick suc­cession ... just pow, pow, pow," said Gentile, who didn't leave hi'> office for about 90 minutes. He used a surveillance camera just outside his office to confirm that the people knocking on his door were police. 
George Gaynor, a senior geogra­phy student, who was in Cole Hall when the shooting happened, told the student newspaper the Northern Star that the shooter was "a skinny white guy with a stocking cap on." 

JPW

ings similar to those in her class. 
"I am really excited about having my parents come to experience what my life is like here," Miller said. 'They will be able to see where my friends come from by examining their parents and be able to under­stand what makes Notre Dame so special." 
The weekend's events will commence tonight with an opening gala in the Joyce Center for all juniors and their parents. The ceremony is the most for­mal event of the weekend and is a chance for the students and their families to become 
acquainted with one another over appetizers, dessert and dancing. 
Saturday morning's events are designed to be more specific to each individual student. Juniors will begin the morning partici­pating in a college specific "col­legiate workshop" in order to offer their parents insight into their academic life at Notre Dame. For lunch, the families will return to the student's resi­dence hall to socialize with friends and families of the other residents. 
Following Saturday's luncheon is the JPW mass, beginning at 5:30, University president Father John Jenkins, will pre­side. Saturday's events will con­clude with the President's Dinner where Father Jenkins and junior class president Bob Reish will speak in addition to live entertainment. 
The weekend will conclude with a Sunday brunch in the Joyce Center. 
Many students study abroad during the spring semester of their junior year and, therefore, cannot participate in JPW. The committee has created a way for the parents of these students to experience the Notre Dame community by opening the event to seniors who studied abroad in the spring of 2007. Approximately 50 seniors and their parents will participate in the weekend this year. 
Fremeau offers an explana­tion for the reasoning behind the timing of the event. 
"Along with first-year orienta­tion and Commencement, JPW is the only other major event focused on parents as official guests of the University," he said. "The study-abroad pro­grams have grown in popularity at Notre Dame, especially over the last fifteen years or so, impacting JPW somewhat, but the weekend still draws a major percentage of the class each year." 
Senior architecture majors, who are all abroad during their junior year, host their own par­ents' weekend every spring. The program, called Expo Roma, showcases all of the senior's work from their previous year in Rome. The students decorate the lobby of Bond Hall to look like Rome, fly in a professor from Rome as a guest speaker and present a slide show of their time abroad to their parents. 
"I really liked [Expo Roma] last year because it was a really personalized Junior Parents' Weekend for us archies," Caitlin Shannon, a fifth-year architec­ture major said. "It's a weekend organized by us, and it's all about our experiences in Rome our junior year. It's a very per­sonal way to show our experi­ence at Notre Dame to our par­ents." 
The University's juniors are looking forward to this weekend with anticipation. For Miller, she sees it as a chance for her par­ents to be able to understand her life at Notre Dame. 
"With my parents coming here, a lot of stories will be shared between my family and my friends and their families," Miller said. "Having those mem­ories will serve and a reminder to why we love this place so much."

lETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Batman's superiority evident 
The Batman vs. Superman debate is the hottest thing to hit The Observer since the Vagina Monologues, and I commend The Scene for their bravery in printing Berrios' and Fitzpatrick's articles ("Superman more than mere mortal," "Batman's humanity is key," Feb. 12)­needless to say this is this year's version of "SMC Girls are Parasites" and a pre­cursor to next year's "Watlles vs. Pancakes," but I digress. 
Bruce Wayne is often discredited as a superhero because people argue that the large sum of money he inherited has enabled him to become the Batman. Money, these heathens argue, is his only superpower. However, Bruce Wayne is not merely a billionaire playboy, as he might come across in Batman Begins. We cannot forget that although there ar11 many billionaires in the world, it is not every day that Bill Gates hits the streets to fight crime. It takes bravery, courage, dedication, strong moral fiber and a life­long commitment to physical training to become a self-made superhero, and money cannot buy these things. 
Moreover, where does Batman shop for Batman gear? I must once again beg readers to forget what they have seen in Batman Begins and remember that Batman's secret identity is a closely guarded secret. lie cannot simply hire a scientist to create his gadgets, or a mechanic to build a Batmobile, lest he rouse their suspicions. Furthermore, last time I checked there are no local super­hero gear shops ... anywhere -as if Bruce Wayne or Batman could simply waltz into one and make a purchase any­way. No, it is Bruce Wayne's brilliance, (something else that money cannot buy), which not only helps him solve mysteries and talk his way out of sticky situations, but invent and build the many gadgets that make Batman the hero he is. 
Another important facet of the argu­ment that Berrios and Fitzpatrick Jell out of their own artieles is which superhero would win in a fight. The answer, of' course, is Batman. In the comics, Superman recognized his potential to bB a threat to humanity and entrusted Batman with a kryptonite ring to use against him should the need arise. Although this ring was destroyed (proba­bly to Batman's benefit, because kryp­tonite proved to be a careinogen) he did continue to keep kryptonite in his belt (presumably in a pouch lined with lead) and in the Batcave. 
Some would argue that Superman could easily vaporize Batman from space with heat vision, to which I respond, try it. Preparedness is Bruen Wayne's motto, and I am certain that in addition to his hip flask of kryptonite, he has outfitted his home, his vehicles and his suit to withstand at least preliminary blows from Superman's most outrageous abilities. Constant readiness proves that should a light between the two occur, Batman would be the surviving superhero. 
In closing, I would like to loosely quote a dassic 1995 film, Angus. Angus is a film about an overweight high school kid struggling to lit in. This movie best explains why Batman is undoubtedly superior to Superman in every way. Superman may stand fi1r "truth, justice and the Anwrican way" but that does not make him brave or courageous. A<> Angus' grandfather explains to him. "Superman is indestructible, and you can't be brave if you're indestructible." Instead, it's people like Batman, poople who "arc dill'erent, and can be crushed and know it. Yet they keep on going out there every lime" that are admirable. Don't be a Superman, he warns his grandson. Be brave, bn a Batman.

A tribute to our tainted water supply 
Before I begin, I would like to thank my parents for reading during this JPW week­end. Thanks. Mom and Dad. 
A couple of weeks ago (before I con­tracted the black plague and was quaran­tined to my side Bob Kessler 
room) I was over at The Hock doing some if 
lifting when I real-House 0 Stix ized that I had forgot­ten to bring bottled water with me. My 
choice: Risk my life drinking from the pos­sibly contaminated drinking fountains out­side the second floor gymnasium, or sim­ply go without water. While my mouth was desperate for some liquidy goodness, I attempted to persevere. I could not go without a swig, however, and I was forced to drink from the ancient spouts on floor two. Even though I can't assume that the sickness I got soon after can't be traced back to my unsafe workout hydration practices, I think my subjugation could have been prevented ifwe would simply follow the example of one Easter Heathman. 
Late last month, Easter Heathman passed away. In the weeks that followed his death, I read several obituaries describing how he was one of the first people to arrive at the scene of Knute Rockne's plane crash. In the years since this fateful event, Mr. Heathman main­tained the site, and led people on unoffi­cial tours of it. He even organized for a memorial to be built in our former coach's honor. 
Here on campus, while we refer to the football stadium as the House that Rockne Built, the building that was actually built to honor the coach is the Rockne Memorial, or, The Rock. For those of you who don't know, (the approximately seven fat people on campus) The Rock is where many students go to work out. While I sometimes swim or lift weights {the small­er ones), other people play basketball, racquetball, or run on treadmills. The facility is also used for freshman physical education classes, as well as fitness and dance classes throughout the year. Since countless students have come through the building to meet for Coach O'Sullivan's golf class, and so many have used The Rock over the years, it is almost shameful to our great coach that we honor him with such a downtrodden facility. 
Knute Rockne was a coach who undoubtedly cared a lot about fitness. I'm certain his teams were a hard-working, intelligent, nasty groups of men that were feared by teams across the country {a far cry from our current situation). These ath­letes undoubtedly went through tough practices under the summer sun, and probably took many water breaks drink­ing from the best sources that north-cen­tral Indiana has to offer. 
Are we really honoring him with this workout facility where students are afraid of contracting diseases from the water? I don't know if my recent plight with a flu­like virus is a direct cause of drinking Rockne-water, but it certainly would not shock me ifthe water in the facility is brought through lead pipes to get to the students who are counting on it. I could be wrong, but I even think one of the campus presidential tickets ran on a clean water campaign. I sure hope they won because we all know the student body president has enough power to get this done. 
Anyways, what we really ought to do to raise awareness about our water situation is bring in a celebrity who has experience cleaning up water. I'm thinking we bring in Erin Brockovich herself. She sure knows enough about cleaning tainted water, and I would think Notre Dame stu­dents are just the group of people that a justice seeking woman like Ms. Brokovich would be willing to help out. 
Actually, on second thought, nobody really knows who she is. It might be better ifwe just get her cinematic counterpart Julia Roberts to come to campus and speak on our behalf. I'm sure that could be fun. We could have her screen some mediocre romantic comedies like Notting Hill and My Best Friend's Wedding, and she could talk about that scene in Ocean's 12 where she acted as a woman pretend­ing to be Julia Roberts. 
Seeing as that probably wouldn't help, we should probably just fix the pipes. If we can spend the money to upgrade the house that Rockne built, we should at least be able to find some really rich alumnus to throw a couple million at us and fix up The Hock. I'm sure Fr. Jenkins would love to have another fence built across campus and spread the construc­tion to South Quad. It's the least we can do not only to stop the fear that is spreading across campus about the drinking water in the Rock, but also to honor the memory of our greatest football coach. 
If Easter Heathman can single handedly honor Coach Rockne at the place of his death, our administration should certainly be able to fmd a way to rightfully honor him at the place where he made a name for himself, and it would not take too much effort to fix the Rock into a healthy facility. 
Or, we could just get water bottles.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Unity crucial in big games 
During the past two weeks, we have had the privilege of seeing three outstanding basketball games against Providence, DePaul and Marquette. We've solidified our place in the Big East, and Mike Brey has distinguished himself as one of the game's best (and one of the classiest head coaches I have ever seen). Best of all, the excellence of our team and our coach has been provided to the national audi­ence through ESPN. There's been only one downside. 
The Leprechaun Legion has also had many opportunities to display its spirit. However, I've noticed that the cameras love to watch us dur­ing the Celtic Chant (read: Uppercut Song). Now. many dedicated Zahmbies have had excellent, front-row seats during these games. We're all familiar with the Zahm House tradi­tion of forming an X with their forearms during the Chant. This gesture is totally inappropriate during a nationally televised basketball game. When the game is Zahm versus Dillon or Cavanaugh versus Howard, dorm loyalty is encouraged. But when it's Notre Dame versus Marquette, the most important loyalty is to the Irish. 
The national audience has no concept of PE or O'Neill; when they see some students not following the rest, it's a sign of division and dis­unity. By making the X, Zahmbies are sending the message that they are more loyal to some­thing besides Notre Dame. They are saying they're more loyal to Zahm House than Our Lady's University. So Zahmbies, please, don't do that when the nation is watching. At pep rallies or interhall games or whatever, go ahead. Be proud of your dorm. But when we come together as a university, be loyal to your university. Be Zahmbies when you should be Zahmbies, and be Loyal Sons when you should be Loyal Sons. Then you can go back to your cheeky (when's the Bun Hun?) shenanigans that the rest of us find so annoyingly charming. 
Just remember: it's not God, Country, Stanford Hall, Notre Dame; it's God, Country, Notre Dame. We are NO; let's act like it.

'Monologues' ineffective 
Dear Notre Dame students, 

As an alumnus from Our Lady's esteemed University, I have a suggestion to you: Don't limit yourself. You are some of the absolute best and brightest students that America has to offer. I have spent countless hours analyz­ing Notre Dame's academic freedom debates throughout the years, especially with regard to the Vagina Monologues. 
I have to admit that I was pretty ignorant regarding the Monologues back in 2002, so in 2005 I started to read them. Then, with the wonderful invention of "YouTube," I have been able to watch almost every skit. Not only is this play inappropriate for Notre Dame, its performances are not suitable for any university, even the secular. 
Religion really has nothing to do with it. The play is vul­gar, tasteless and destroys the spirit of womanhood. My question to so many universities is, "why do so many believe the Monologues are the answer to end violence against women?" I do not see it as an answer but as an additional problem! 
We will not end violence against women until we appre­ciate women physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritu­ally. I am trying to be as open-minded as possible, but I cannot see how the Vagina Monologues could ever achieve this task. Wake up Notre Dame and use the gifts God has given you. Stand up for women and women's rights. There are countless ways to cooperatively work together as a university to end violence against women. 
The Vagina Monologues, which are unarguably antithet­ical to Catholic teaching, do not allow the University to work together to fight this battle. The Vagina Monologues turns off a majority of students and alumni due to its graphic nature and inappropriate language and actions. Let's work together. Let's really make a difference to end violence of all kinds, as a university united in Christ. You are all intelligent enough to fmd solutions to the world's problems in which all members of the Notre Dame com­munity can take part. There are better ways to fight these battles, ways that are in line with the teaching of the Catholic Church. Your job is to think of these ways. Don't ever sell yourself short! 
Dump the Monologues and begin fresh, and by the way, kudos to those students who have worked so hard over the years to develop the "Edith Stein Project." What a hero and role model to help shape the world's view of feminism. 
Greg Bergman alumnus Class of 1997 Feb. 13 
PERSPECTIVE: 2001 
The following extracts are from Letters to the Editor that appeared in The Observer in 2001 in response to Saint Mary's cancelling a production of 'The Vagina Monologues." 
Surprised by censorship 
Censorship is an ugly word. Vagina, apparently, is an even uglier one. Saint Mary's has decided to ban this year's performances of "The Vagina Mono­logues." Such a clear act of censorship should by no means be surprising, but it should also not go unquestioned. 
The decision to ban by itself would not be wholly shocking. After all, we are talking about a Catholic campus. The problem here lies in the fact that the play was performed last year on the same campus. 
... Last year's presentation generated an immense amount of discussion about sex on both campuses. Notre Dame's campus has been labeled rape-prone" by more than one lecturer, and one of the main fac­tors in that label is the repression of any open talk about sexuality. 
00. 

I hope some sort of agreement can be reached by discussing this and I hope people participate in this discussion. Nothing sends a more powerful message about us than apathy, after all. 
Jeff Eyerman O'Neill Hall Jan. 24, 2001 

Women's empowerment not expressed in 'Monologues' 
The last time I checked, rape and child molesta­tion were not women's empowerment issues. They were considered violence against women issues. 
00. 

One of the central messages of the show is that "great sex is possible between people who have absolutely no emotional commitment to each other." 
00. 

The show's final result is that it has condoned and glorified rape, child molestation, pornography and prostitution. 
In a world where feminists and all those who fight for women's justice have worked so hard over the years to gain respect and admiration for the way we manage our lives, I find it hard to see how this show could further that cause at all, other than giv­ing someone untold opportunities to say the word "vagina." 
000 

This play, in its language and its subject mat­ter, is not women's empowerment, it is a cheap way of getting attention and an excuse to act immature. Thank you, Saint Mary's, for not giving in!

There is a show running on the third floor in the back of Washington Hall that you might not know about. 
It's a play about stories: dark, violent stories. It's a play about truth, lies, torture, little green pigs, slow-motion smack-downs and vehicular behead­ings. Most importantly, it's a play that you don't want to miss. 
The St. Ed's Players have undergone a courageous endeavor with "The Pillow Man," which opened yesterday in 
"The

Washington llall's Lab Theater. The Pillowman" play is a work by the Washington young and famous 
Hall Lab 

Irish playwright, Martin McDonagh. Theatre When it first opened 
Thurs.-Sat.

in London at the Royal National 7:30pm Theatre in November 
Tickets: $5 

2003, it was to wide acclaim, eventually winning the prestigious Olivier Award for "Best New Play" in 2004. 
It's in these giant footsteps that the St. Ed's Players are treading. 
Director Megan O'Donoghue described the production of the play as having been a "really ambitious chal­lenge," partly due to the show's venue. 
Unlike a regular theater, where the audience directly faces the perform­ers, the Lab Theater is a "Theater in the Round." This type of venue places the actors in the center of a stage which is surrounded by the viewing audience. It's tough for performers because they must constantly shift their position, so as not to have their back facing any side of the audience for too long. 
However, the Lab Theater suits this production well. 
"Given the scale of this space, the show becomes a lot more intimate," assistant director Eddie Velazquez said. "It sets the mood for the style of the show." 
The style is stunning, hilarious and horrifying, but also one that psycho­logically challenges the audience from start to finish. 
The story is set in a totalitarian dic­tatorship, a place similar to East Germany before the fall of the Wall, only more painfully humorous. It fol­lows a few hours in the life of Katurian 
K. Katurian (Stephen Iwanski). Katurian writes hundreds of disturbing short stories but has only managed publish one in his career. 
His parents are dead and his only remaining family member is his men­tally-handicapped sister Michala (Katie Manfred), with whom he shares all the gruesome tales he writes. Katurian has a deep affinity with his stories, one that he'll sacrifice any­thing to protect. 
The play picks up with Katurian being interrogated by two police offi­cers for a pair of child-murders that bear strange resemblance to matching death sequences in Katurian's stories. One of the officers, Tupolski (Joe Edmunds). is a fast-talking detective whose chief interrogation method is to "disconcert and destabilize the prison­er with asinine nonsense." 
It's a method that works well, and he starts out by convincing Katurian that the totalitarian dictatorship is not about restrictions, but rather, about guidelines. He also claims he's tbe good cop. 
The bad cop, Ariel (Joe Vittoria), had a rough childhood -a fact that will get you beaten to a pulp if you bring it up -and he operates on a very short fuse, dealing Katurian beat-downs on a whim. While Tupolski tries to befud­dle a confession out of Katurian, Ariel just complains, "Why don't we just start torturing him and cut out all this s***?" 
The play takes a disturbing twist when Katurian finds out that his sto­ries have influenced someone in a pro­found way. That is, a profoundly sadis­tic way. But I won't spoil it for you. 
O'Donoghue and Velazquez have done an incredible job with the play's direction and the actors all spit off 
MARY JESSE I Observer Graphic 
their lines with impeccable timing. The interactions between the two cops and Katurian are an absolute riot and con­stantly tread between the hilarious and the shocking. 
Iwanski does an excellent job evok­ing our sympathy for his character's imprisonment and feelings for his sis­ter, while at the same time bringing out laughs with the occasional hot­headed outburst. Manfred convincingly pulls off Katurian's mentally-damaged sister. 
The show ironically opened on Valentine's Day. You won't find much in the form of materialistic, cutsie­tootsie love, but there's no lack of beauty. 
O'Donoghue said one of the reasons she felt so attracted to the script of "The Pillow Man" was because, "It's a grotesque story, it's horrific, but it's beautiful in the end." 
When you see Katurian recite the full story of the Pillowman to Michala, you'll know why:

Warning: Do not operate heavy machinery while listening to this album. 
Jack Johnson's latest, "Sleep Through the Static," is more of what we have come to expect from the island pop-rocker. It's filled with the same syrupy sweet, slow, smooth rhythms that drip from his guitar, and lull us into a gentle and tranquil state. 
This album features the same signa­ture sound that permeates the bulk of Johnson's work. Full of bar chords that wax Caribbean and the silky-voice that is clearly meant for the beach, "Sleep Through the Static" will appeal to the average fan of the Hawaiian native. 
This album sounds remarkably like his previous efforts (don't they all?). The CD appears to be the kind you pop in for some good background music, something that doesn't require your full attention. Maybe this is a good thing -but maybe it's not? 
The album lacks a signature song. There is no "Better Together" or "Banana Pancakes," or even a "Flake" or "Bubble Toes." These songs are the type of songs that seemed to make up the "filler" in Johnson's other efforts. 
Before all you island hoppers get your coconuts in a jumble, this isn't to say the album is bad. Actually, it's far from it. It's a decent album for what it is -a soothing mix of love songs and island tunes. 
Just don't expect for any of these songs to be catchy in the way that "Banana Pancakes" was. It's just not going to happen. Altogether the album is just plain forgettable. Not bad, not ­great-just there. 
There are a few songs that assert themselves, albeit not impressively. If there is a "hit" on this album, it is "If I Had Eyes." This is the sixth track on the album and has a borderline catchy piano-influenced sound. Like many songs on the album, Johnson swaps his acoustic guitar for an electric model. For this song, at least, it works. 
The title song, "Sleep Through the Static" is probably the second-best effort on the album but just doesn't have much going on. The song takes a political tone saying, "Who needs sleep when we've got love? Who needs keys when we've got clubs? Who needs please when we've got guns?" The song, however, is just not powerful enough to carry the anti-militarism message. 
The song "Angel" is just in time for the season of love surrounding Valentine's Day and is a nice little acoustic ditty. This song will likely find its way onto "Love Mixes" around the country, and rightfully so -Johnson seems to do his best work when writ­ing lyrics about love. 
Overall, the album is decent, but underwhelming. If only it had a few signature tracks, it would probably be a big seller. It's good -just not good for Jack Johnson. But if background music is what you are after, this album is for you.

Associated Press 
One of Brian McNamee's lawyers predicted Roger Clemens will be pardoned by President Bush, saying some Republicans treated his client harshly because of the pitcher's friendship with the Bush family. 
Richard Emery made the claims Thursday, a day after a congressional hear­ing broke down along party lines. Many Democrats were skeptical of Clemens' denials he used perform­ance-enhancing drugs and Hepublicans questioned the character of McNamee, the personal trainer who made the accusations against the seven-time Cy Young Award winner. 
IN BRIEF 

Oualifviru! races set ~e for 
Hendrick-Gibbs showdown 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.-They showed up as favorites, endured their share of failures and found a way to stay at the front of the Daytona 500. 
There's a reason Hendrick Motorsports and Joe Gibbs Hacing are the ones to beat in NASCAR. Now, they'll try to beat each other in a super showdown in the biggest race of the year. 
"It's going to be the epic battle, and it should be the battle of a lifetime and the century," Gibbs driver Tony Stewart quipped. "There may not be another battle of this proportion for the rest,of my life, my career, for the century. 
Stewart was of course overplaying the magnitude of Sunday's season­opener. But when Hendrick driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Gibbs driver Denny Hamlin each won a qualifying race Thursday, it set the stage for a fabulous battle. 
"It would be the easiest thing in the world for George W. Bush, given the corrupt proclivities of his administration, to say Roger Clemens is an American hero, Roger Clemens helped children," Emery said in a telephone interview. "It's my belief they have some rea­son to believe they can get a pardon." 
During Wednesday's ses­sion before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Clemens repeated his denials under oath, which could lead to criminal charges if federal prosecu­tors conclude he made false statements or obstructed Congress. 
''I'm not aware of Mr. 
Clemens having been charged with anything," White House deputy press secretary Tony Fratto said after being told of Emery's remarks. 
Emery cited Bush's deci­sion last year to commute the 2-year prison sentence of I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, his vice president's former top aide. Libby was convict­ed in the case of the leaked identity of a CIA operative. 
In addition, Emery said he thinks Bush would pardon Clemens even before an indictment or conviction, as President Ford did with President Nixon. 
During the hearing, Clemens cited his friendship with Bush's father, President George H.W. 
Bush, a baseball fan who regularly attends Houston Astros' games. Clemens said he was on a recent hunting trip when the elder Bush called with words of support. 
"When all this happened, the former president of the United States found me in a deer blind in south Texas and expressed his concerns that this was unbelievable, and stay strong and hold your head up high," Clemens testified. 
Emery said as he thought about the testimony overnight, Clemens' refer­ence to the call from the elder Bush convinced him the questioning by Republicans was a concert­ed effort. 

Dolphins release veteran line­
backer 
MIAMI -If Zach Thomas decides to play a 13th NFL season, it will almost certainly not be with the Miami Dolphins. 
Thomas, a seven-time Pro Bowl linebacker and one of the most pop­ular and productive players ever to wear a Dolphins uniform, was released Thursday, the biggest move yet in Miami's massive rebuilding project. 
"I have a tremendous appreciation and admiration not only for the Dolphins organization, but for the fans as well, for all of the support that they have given me," Thomas said in a statement, in which he thanked owner Wayne Huizenga, new football operations head Bill Parcells and general manager Jeff Ireland. 
The 34-year-old linebacker said he plans to play with another team next season. There's always a chance he could re-sign with Miami, although that seems, at best, doubtful. 
"I am healthy and look forward to playing in 2008, but will always consider myself a Miami Dolphin," Thomas said. 
Bryant chooses rest over 
surgery for injured finger 
EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -Kobe Bryant was diagnosed with a torn ligament in his right pinkie finger Thursday and the Lakers All-Star has decided not to undergo surgery that could sideline him for six weeks. 
The damage occurred when Bryant dislocated the finger at New Jersey on Feb. 5, and was aggravat­ed in Wednesday night's game at Minnesota. 
The team said Thursday that the damage was more extensive than first believed. There is a com­plete tear of the radial collateral ligament and avulsion fracture, in which a small bone fragment had been pulled off by a tendon.

After a three-month break in competitive play, No. 20 Notre Dame tees off the sec­ond half of its season at the Central District Invitational tournament in Parrish, Fla., on Monday.

"We'll be right on our heels a lot of tlw time on this one," Holt said. "This is tough corn pe­tition. Those are shots and playing holes and managing our game," Holt said. "We're able to work on our short game indoors at our new practice facility and work on our driving outdoors. I want to look to get us back into our mode, that thought process that comes with man­aging the game." 

As a result, the focus for the Irish this weekend is to ease themselves back into competi­tive play. 
"I'd like them to get eom­fortable again out on the 
course," Holt said. "If they can really hone in on managing the game and managing the course, we can save some strokes. l don't expect them to be spot on, l just want them to focus on managing the course and

"Golf is basically hitting can be fast depending on the weather.

After a practice round on Sunday, the tournament rounds will be played on Monday and Tuesday.

The Irish will kick off a tough Friday morning with a game against Utah (5-0). The Utes are off to their best start since 1985 and are a tough opening match for the Irish. 
Friday afternoon won't be any easier for the Irish as they are set to take on two-time defending NCAA champion Arizona. The Wildcats went 50­14-1 last year and will return six position starters along with All-America pitcher Taryne Mowatt. The Wildcats enter the tournament ranked No. 1 in almost every preseason poll. 
"I think that if we don't get the jitters, we will be able to play very well," Gumpf said. 
The Irish face Western Kentucky and No. 3 Texas A&M on Saturday. The second game will likely prove more trying for Notre Dame as Texas A&M is 5­1 on the season. But Gumpf said the Aggies are only one team of many in the competi­tive pool. 
"There are no easy teams in the field," Gumpf said. "Cal is the only team below .500, and they won't be for very long." 
The Irish wrap things up Sunday morning against California (2-4) before return­ing-home.

Firing Sampson could be costly for Indiana 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Getting rid of coach Kelvin Sampson might not be the solution to Indiana's prob­lems. It's a move that might just create a bigger mess. 
When Sampson was accused Wednesday of five major NCAA infractions, it immediately set off a widespread debate over what the university should do next and whether Sampson should contin­ue coaching at Indiana, which hasn't had a major NCAA rules violation in nearly half a century. 
"The thing I'm disappointed with is that the allegations have come out, and I feel we have to react in some way that's in the best interests of the team and the best interests of the university," trustee Philip Eskew Jr. said. "I think there are options." 
There's no guarantee the NCAA would reduce Indiana's potential penalties, and the university, which has spent the past decade paying millions of dollars to frred coaches and athletic directors, could wind up in another costly split-up. 

According to the contract signed in April 2006, Indiana pays Sampson an annual base salary of $500,000. With five years left on the deal, the cost could reach at least $2.5 million. 
Sampson's deal includes termi­nation clauses for violations of · university or NCAA rules that eliminate the payments. Attorneys, however, have differing views on whether the accusations, which include providing false or 
GIVE BLOOD!! 
misleading information to investi­gators, would allow Indiana to fire Sampson with cause and get ofl' the financial hook. 
Athletic director Rick Greenspan acknowledged Wednesday these are only allega­tions since the NCAA has not yet made a ruling, and the distinction could be important. 
"It [the contract] talks about sig­nificant, intentional or repetitive violations, so the question becomes when does it become a violation?" said Indianapolis

attorney Stephen Backer, a for­mer trustee at Indiana who works in contractual law. "That's the issue. I'm sure that's what they're meeting about today." 
The university has until May 8 to respond to the NCAA's report. Sampson and university officials are scheduled to appear before the infractions committee June 14, with a final ruling expected within a month. 
University spokesman Larry Macintyre confirmed Thursday that president Michael McRobbie was still consulting with the school's lawyers, trustees and administrators. Macintyre would not provide details on those dis­cussions but acknowledged both sides have to abide by the rules set forth in the contract. 
Macln tyre said Dorothy Frapwell, the university's counsel, declined to discuss Sampson's contract. 
Milton Thompson, also an Indianapolis attorney, believes there's another caveat, too. 
While he contends Indiana's report and Sampson's acceptance of the school's penalties in October amount to an admission of significant and repetitive viola­tions, the coach may still have legal protection because he was­n't fired four months ago. 
"There can always be a liability issue," Thompson said. "If they accepted the sanctions and didn't fire him then, that may be an area he could pursue." 
Other potential clauses that could absolve the university of a hefty payout include those for moral turpitude and conduct seri­ously prejudicial to the university. 
Both attorneys believe they are broad enough provisions that the university could use either one to make its case for firing Sampson with cause.

Laxers begin season with Canisius, Duquesne 
By MATT GAMBER Sports Writer 
Coming oil' an 11-6 year (3-2 Big East), No. 12 Notre Dame will host Canisius at 5 p.m. tonight before taking on Duquesne at noon Sunday. Both games will be played in the Loftus Sports Center. 
Despite losing five starters from last year's squad, including a pair of' all-Big East perform­~~rs, the Irish will enter tonight's season opener with both experi­ence and eonlidence, thanks in part to senior captains Caitlin McKinney and Becky Hanck. 
"We did lose some starters, but we've traditionally had a good bench and I think tliat's the case again this ynar," said MeKinnny, a two-timn All­American rnidf'inlder who scored 44 goals and recorded 21 assists a year ago. "With those

positions opening up, you do kind of hold your breath, but the people who have been in there have been doing awesome. It's nice to see new faces and fresh people in there." 
A highly-touted freshman class joins the returning cast of McKinney, Ranck, junior attack­er .lillian Byers -a two-time All-American who scored 58 goals last season -and junior midfielder Erin Stoeckert (21 goals, 15 assists) to provide the Irish with a balance of youth and experience. 
Coach Tracy Coyne said the ups and downs the senior class has undergone -from three wins as freshmen to a Final Four appearance as sopho­mores to missing the NCAA tournament last year -are a positive heading into another campaign. 
"Now, here this group is as seniors with a good perspective and a good vision," said Coyne, who is entering her 12th year at the helm of the Notre Dame pro­gram. "The younger players on this team have definitely felt the unity of the senior· class, and the seniors have done a great job outlining what we want to accomplish this season and then demonstrating that in practice." 
Between Ranck's ability to lead the defense by example and McKinney's light-hearted, more vocal leadership style on offense, the Irish seem to have just the right recipe for success. 
"The older girls on tho team have really been able to wel­come the freshmen and teach them how we do things," Coyne said. "Because of that, the bur­den really isn't on the younger players to have to do things other than follow the things the older players do." 
Coyne also said the athleticism of' freshman midfielders Kaitlin Keena and Shaylyn Blaney will have them starting soon. 
Though Notre Dame seems to have the leadership aspect of the game down, much is yet to be determined as far as playing strategy goes. The Irish have yet to even scrimmage heading into tonight's opening contest, a first in Coyne's tenure here. 
"I guess we'll find out !tonight] what our style's going to be," Coyne said. "Generally. we like to be an up-tempo, aggressive­on-defense type of team. 
"There are a lot of unknowns, but we know what we do well. We'll go out with a game plan, but we'll be ready in-game to make any adjustments that are necessary." 
While the Irish are still unsure of how their returners and new­comers will mesh during live games, one thing they aren't lacking is confidence. 
"It's not just about winning the Big East or making the NCAA Tournament -it's about winning every game and doing everything right, not having any regrets," Hanck said. "I don't think having the national cham­pionship as a goal is outlandish at all because we have so much potential." 
Quick to catch themselves before looking too far ahead, Hanck and McKinney both said the Irish will "take one game at a time", but dearly, the long­term bar has been set-high. 
That being said, the long road begins tonight. 
"The most important thing is that we have a lot of respect for Canisius and Duquesne," Coyne said. "So we're going to go out and bring what we need to get it done -which is win. Bottom line: 2-0 al'ter the weekend."

Irish take dovvn OSU to even their record 
By LORENZO REYES 
Sports Writer 
After participating in three matches in as many days at the ITA National Team Indoors, No. 14 Notre Dame has a lot on its plate this weekend as the pace of this season begins to pick up. 
The Irish started their three­game weekend home stand with a 5-2 victory over No. 47 Ohio State on Thursday bringing their record up to an even 4-4 this season. 
Irish coach Jay Louderback commented on the overall fatigue of his squad heading into the match. 
"Maybe they were a little tired," Louderback said. "This is the part of the season when we start to play a lot of matches grouped together. We have three this week and three the next. After the ITA [National Team Indoors], we went a little shorter in practice on Tuesday and Wednesday. One thing we really wanted to focus on was our dou­bles play over practice." 
The extra work paid off. Notre Dame secured the first two dou­bles matches against the Buckeyes to take the 1-0 lead. 
The national No. 3 tandem of senior Brook Buck and junior Kelcy Tefft took the first match 8-2 over Buckeyes junior Angela DiPastina and sophomore Christina Keesey. 
Sophomore duo Cm~mina Ciobanu and Colleen Rielley ensured the Irish would start the match 1-0 with their 8-3 ousting of freshman Paloma Escobedo and senior Caitlin O'Keefe. Sophomore Kali Krisik and freshman Kristen Rafael com­pleted the doubles sweep with an 8-6 win over Julie Blackmore and Cami Hubbs. 
"It was exciting to see our doubles play well," Louderback said. "We won all three and it signaled a great start to the weekend." 
The Irish carried the momen­tum lrom their doubles win into singles play. 
"It definitely set the tempo for the rest of the afternoon," he said. "We've started our last thwe or four down 1-0. and our players got tired of it. It's always tougher to play from behind, and I'm really excited we won all tlm~e." 
Keeping the momentum rolling, the Irish won the first 
t(!) 

three singles matches, claiming the victory in convincing fashion. 
Krisik took O'Keefe in two quick sets 6-1, 6-3 followed by junior Katie Potts' 6-1, 6-1 victo­ry from the No. 5 spot over Hubbs. 
Tefft played from the No. 1 spot for the first time all season and didn't cave under the pres­sure. Tefft's 6-4, 6-2 win over DiPastina clinched the win over the Buckeyes with the 4-0 lead. The junior improved her dual action record this season to an unbeaten mark of 8-0. 
Ohio State gained its first point once Buck came to face Escobedo. However, it was not the senior's play that gave the point away, but a rolled ankle instead. Buck was in position to take the match until she was forced to retire because of the injury. 
Notre Dame went on to pick up one more point as Ciobanu took care of Keesey in three sets for the 6-0, 3-6, 6-2 win. · 
The Irish won't have time to rest as Wisconsin comes to town for a 3 p.m. match at the Eck Tennis Pavilion today. The squad will get one day's rest before they continue their home stand against South Florida at 10 a.m. on Sunday. 
Knowing that his squad would face several tiring stretches throughout the season, Louderback focused on condi­tioning in the fall. 
"We worked real hard on con­ditioning last fall," he said. "Now we'll see how we did and it pays off." 
With the injured ankle, Buck will sit today's action, but may be back for South Florida, depending on her progress. Louderback had already been prepared to sit one of his players because of an NCAA violation that will force Buck, Ciobanu and Tefft each to sit one team dual match. 
"The players are scheduled to play in 25 matches in a season," Louderback said. "So we'll schedule 25 total matches in the season to cover those. Sometimes though, when our players qualify for the ITA Championships, they'll go over the 25 mark. With Brook [Buck] hurt now we can let her rest her ankle and get one of those sus­pensions out of the way."

"[Senior] Sheeva Parbhu was a big key to our two wins last weekend," coach Bobby Bayliss said. "When you have a senior who has been there you feel more confident. He won a match like he did on Saturday as a freshman over Florida State." 
Bayliss said the doubles teams played well last weekend after struggling in the previous match­es. 
"Both of our opponent's coach­es were impressed by the dou­bles play last weekend," Bayliss said. "Whenever you lose there is a greater sense of urgency to play well. We came out with more energy and were able to keep the momentum going against Wisconsin and SMU." 
In the win over Wisconsin, 
Parbhu pulled out a four-hour match that clinched the win for the Irish. Junior Brett Helgeson also won in three sets. 
The team's six freshmen have stepped up this season, Bayliss said. 
"The freshman are living up to or better than our expectations for them," Bayliss said. "They have each taken turns being in the spotlight. Tyler Davis is a very poised doubles player." 
The team is mostly healthy heading into Seattle. Bayliss said his squad has a few bumps and bruises, but no major issues. Bayliss also said strength and conditioning intern Eric Overland has emphasized stretching and cool downs after each practice. 
Although Bayliss wants to per­form well, he said he won't be disappointed with a subpar per­formance because the Irish have not played some of the teams in the Irish in points as a fresh­man and was named the LaxPower rookie of the year, was pulled over for OWl on Holy Cross Drive. 
Corrigan was confident the offense would still be effective despite the loss of Yeatman. "We practiced and played without Will this fall and last fall as well during football season," Corrigan said. "We have guys who have been playing together and used to running the offense in place." 
The contest with Loyola is just the first step in a tough opening stretch for Notre Dame. Four of the first five Irish opponents are ranked in the preseason top 25. 
"We look forward to playing a high level of competition," Corrigan said. "We have to prepare knowing we can't relax and have to start right away." 
The Irish and Greyhounds will face off at 1 p.m. at Diane Geppi-Akens Field.

the competition. 
"We want to continue our good play," Bayliss said. "It is a wide open event, but we want to play well. I will be happy with any result since we haven't seen some of these teams before." 
Another freshman who impressed Bayliss this spring season was David Anderson. 
"Anderson has come through against Duke," Bayliss said. "The doubles teams are really gelling and that will be key for our suc­cess in the close matches." 
Bayliss said junior Santiago Montoya, Davis' doubles partner, has also played well, but still has work to do. 
"Montoya has really improved his serve but it is an ongoing process," Bayliss said. "He is very coachable, and has worked weii with Davis."

"ShB's play­ing like a sen­ior," McGraw said. "She's just trying to do everything she can to put us in a good position." 
Wednesday's 99-76 win over Marquette was a good sign for the Irish that they could win without fresh­man forward Devereaux Peters, who tore her left ACL Sunday against Pittsburgh.

Rutgers, meanwhile, lacks a superstar but has a very bal­anced offensive attack. The Scarlet Knights feature three players -J.R. Inman, Corey Chandler and Anthony Farmer -who have double­figure scoring averages for the season. In addition, Rutgers freshman guard Mike Coburn averages 10.9 points per game during Big East play. 
Hillesland said the Irish are happy they do not have a long layoff and are hungry to get back on the right track. 
"We really thought we could have won that [Connecticut] game and it kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth," Hillesland said. "So we're def­initely eager to get back on the road and try it out against Rutgers."

The Marquette win also showcased Notre Dame's two best offensive facets, McGraw said: free throws and layups. 
Notre Dame hit 26-of-28 from the line against the Golden Eagles and had 54 points in the paint. Over its last five games, Notre Dame has shot 117-of-137 at the charity stripe for an 85.4 percentage. 
The Irish were also able to rack up 99 points with only one made 3-point shot. 
"That's amazing to me that we ean score 99 points with only one 3," McGraw said. "I think it's because we're driv­ing to the lane better. We had quite a few three-point plays last night. I thought that was good to see that we're finish­ing with contact and wH're running well."

The Irish will attempt to overcome potential symptoms of jet lag following a journey that began with the team's bus ride to Chicago on Wednesday, continued with Thursday's flight from Chicago to Seattle, and ended with the drive to Fairbanks from Anchorage, where the Irish landed via a flight from Seattle.

The wider ice surface will change up the passing and shooting lanes, and it gives an advantage to the quicker skaters. Defenders will be less conservative, and there will be less hitting because if the man with the puck gets loose, there may be no catching him. Between the long travel and the changes in rink size, this weekend might not look like the most ideal for the Irish to snap out of their winter dol­drums. Notre Dame won all six of its meetings with Alaska a year ago, but after a slow start under first-year coach Doc DelCastillo, the Nanooks have won three of four and beat Ferris State earlier in the season -a team that beat the Irish S-3 last Friday before

While most of the Irish spent the early part of this week preparing for a trek into unfamiliar territory, Pearce, an ABchorage native, was focused on a return to his childhood roots. 
"[Fairbanks] is about a six­hour drive from Anchorage, but Alaska's Alaska. It's all where I grew up and played a lot of my youth hockey," Pearce said. "For my parents and a Jot of the extended fam­ily all planning on making the trip up there, it'll be a neat experience." 
Alaska's Olympic rink, which is 15 feet wider than an NI II. or NCAA rink, will force the Irish to be wary of straying too far outside, Jackson said. 
"When you play in the Olympie sheet, you really have to make sure you don't get caught playing outside the dots offensively or defensive­ly," Jackson said. "If you do on the offensive side of the puck, you're not going to generate much offense and you'll be stuck playing perimetBr hock­ey. If you're drawn outside the dots defensively, that's when they may find opportunities we shouldn't normally give up because of the additional ice."

With only four conference games after this weekend, the Irish, who currently hold a four-point advantage over Nebraska-Omaha for fourth place in the CCHA, are looking to regain the early-season form that helped them win 10 of their first 12 conference match-ups. 
"We need to let last week­end !against Ferris State! go, let the last couple games get out of our minds, and not be stressed or worried about the NCAA [tournament! or being on the bubble," Pearce said. "It's definitely just about being focused on the game at hand ... and not letting the past or future dictate how you play in the present."

Aftllr an 84-78 loss to Connnctieut on Wednesday night, Notre Dame will again !wad east to play Hutgers on Sunday. And dnspitc the tough loss to the Huskies. the Irish had an upbeat attitude before practice Thursday. 
"I think our eonfidenec is still sky high," senior captain Hob Kurz said. "We've been playing great and one loss is not gonna derail our confi­dence in any way." 
Tlw defeat at Connecticut dropped Notre Dame's Big East road record to 2-3, but coach Mikn Brey said his team is excited to play away from the Joyce Center. 
"I lovn that we have another road game in an on-campus facility," Brey said. "That fan base is on us always -it's a tough place to play."

Believe it or not, the No. 9 Irish have traveled 4,R80 miles to arrive at this week­end's series -just to play a conference game.

While Alaska will attempt to exact revenge on the Irish for ending its season in the first round of the CCIIA playoffs a year ago, Notre Dame (20-10­2, 13-7-2) must focus yet again on escaping a 4-6-2 skid that dates back to a Dec. 29 loss to Massachusetts.
