THE 'WORLD TODAY 
Muslde Booed 
W ASIIINGTON, Pa. (UPI) -A group of Washington and Jefferson College students forced Sen. Edmund Muskie to interrupt a speech here yesterday bycontinuously booing him and chanting "stop the war." 
Terming their action the "first discourteous and contemptible reception" accorded him during the campaign, the Democratic vice presidential nominee told the students to select a spokesman to mount the speaking platform in front of the county courthouse and address the audience for 10 minutes. 
"I am not going to try to outshout you," Muskie said. 
The students, who made up about half of the crowd of 500, selected Rick Brody, bearded self proclaimed "revolutionary." Brody, who in turn was booed often by non-students in the 
crowd, spoke for about four minutes. 

Wallace And Who? 
INDIANAPOLIS ( UPI) -A spokesman for George C. Wallace said yesterday at a news conference in newly opened state headquarters here that there is a possibility the ex-Alabama governor's running mate in his presidential bid may not he chosen until after the election. 
Joseph Fine, Montgomery, Ala., a former state district attorney, fielded several questions from newsmen about the legality of having former Georgia Gov. Marvin Griffin's name on the Nov. 5 ballots as Wallace's vice presidential candidate when Fine had just said he was a 'merely a stand-in." 


Ford Frees Congressmen 

WASHINGTON (UPI)-House Republican leader Gerald R. Ford said yesterday that GOP congressmen elected from Wallace territory will be free to vote for George C. Wallace if the presidential election is thrown into the House of Representatives. 
Ford made it plain that those Republican !louse candidates running in those areas favoring Wallace could withhold support for Richard M. Nixon, their party's candidate, between now and election clay without incurring party penalties in the next congress. 

Caetano Replaces Salazar 
LISBON (UP I) -Law Professor Marcelo Caetano has agreed to become Portugal's second premier in 36 years and will form his cabinet today informed military and civilian sources said last night. 
Caetano will be sworn in tomorrow, the sources said. 
The appointment of Caetano, 62, head of Lisbon University's law faculty, would end the long rule of Premier Antonio Salazar. 79, who has ruled Portugal with an iron hand for 40 years as finance minister and premier. Salazar suffered a 
bra in stroke Sept. 16. 

Fortas Fllllbuster 

WASHINGTON (UPI) -The Senate began a filibuster unprecedented in its history yesterday against Abe Fortas' nomination to be chief justice of the United States, with no sign when-if ever-it might come to a vote. 
At the outset, Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield ' signaled perhaps the weakest link in the Fortas defense and opponents of the nomination were quick to pounce on it.' 
Rejecting all other charges against Fortas, Mansfield remarked it was ''unfortunate" that the associate justice acc~pted $15 ,O?O in law school lecture fees contributed by bus mess execut 1ves who might some day be involved in a case before the Supreme Court. 

Schlllebeecloc A Heretic? 
VATICAN CITY(UPI)-High Vatican sources said yesterday the Vatican is investigating the writings of a liberal Dutch theologian for possible errors, but denied reports he would be tried for heresy. 
The Vatican sources contradicted other liberal Roman Catholic sources who said they had learned the Vatican's powerful and conservative Congregation of the Faith was planning to try Prof. E.C. Schillebeeckx for heresy. 
"There will be no trial, but rather an examination of his works," the Vatican sources said. "Trials for heresy belong to past centuries. One cannot speak of heresy trials in this day." 
The sources said that if the Vatican rules there are errors in Schillebeekx's writings, he will be asked to correct them. If he refuses he will have to face the consequences.

DemandsAt Columbia 
NEW YORK (UPI) -A 
Student Council committee 
demanded on the eve of the fall 
term yesterday that Columbia 
University give its students the 
"exclusive" right to regulate 
their campus organizations. 
The new dissension arose as 
top administrators and trustees 
of the university prepared to 
address Columbia's 110,000 
alumni on nationwide closed 
circuit television Wednesday 
night to appeal for $200 million 
in funds for the campus torn by 
bloody student police clashes 
last spring. 
The executive committee of 
the Columbia Student Council 
demanded at a campus news 
conference that the university 
give the students the "exclusive" 
power to regulate their own 
organizations. · 
Council president Tomec 
Smith called for abolishment of 
the university Committee on 
Student Organizations, CSO, 
which now has final authority 
over student activities. Smith is 
one of the two student members 
of the committee which also 
includes two faculty and two 
administration representatives.

ASP: Frosh Senators 
Following up on its candidate meeting of Tuesday night, the Action Student Party held a special session last night for freshmen candidates. Meeting concurrently with the candidates' session, the ASP platform committee labored for three hours at finalizing planks on such questions as academic reform, hall life, and off­campus. 
Speaking to nine freshmen candidates of the party, ASP leader Peter Kelly maintained "The ASP will apply no pressure to party senators to support any particular piece of legislation they or their hall disagrees with. You as candidates are running on your party's program, but I would like you to remember that as senators you will represent first and foremost your halls and only secondarily your party. You serve the people who elect you and put their trust in you." 
Several of the freshmen candidates spoke strongly for ASP emphasis on maintaining freshmen representatives in the Student Senate. In a statement drafted by Greg Stepic of Badin and Tom Bezzi of Cavanaugh, the candidates contended "This is not solely an upperclass university. Because of the stay hall system there is a possibility that the voice of the freshman will not be heard in the Senate. We need the say of freshmen senators if we arc to have a truly representative government. The future of the Notre Dame student body depends on its future leaders and upon the experience and degree of involvement we can gain now." 
While centering on academic reform proposals, the committee heard strong pleas on the off-campus situation similar to those at the Tuesday candidates session. Senior Armand Gelinas told the committee ~·A firm ASP stand against the Administration attitude of operating in loco parentis concerning off-campus housing is one which must appeal to anyone considering. moving off-campus in the ncar 
future." 

Mexican Students Rioting 
MEXICO CITY (UPI)-Army troops with fixed bayonets clashed with student demonstrators again last night in front of Mexico City's Olympic headquarters. The incident broke a calm that followed student rioting which left at least six persons dead. 
The troops, backed by armored cars, charged 300 student demonstrators who burned a traffic policeman's motorcycle in front of the 10 story building that houses the headquarters of the Mexico Olympic Organizing Committee. Flames from the burning vehicle reflected off the Olympic baloon inside the building. 

There were no immediate reports of injuries, bur several ambulances screamed down a broad avenue nearby. The troops were backed by 30 armored cars. 
In other incidents students burned two trollies. They were dispersed by club swinging riot police. 
Earlier yesterday the city wo~s 
relatively calm after two days of 
rioting that killed at least six and 
left another 16 injured. 
Army troops and motorized 
cavalry units were pulled out of 
the sprawling National 
Polytechnic Institute, captured 
in nine hours of fighting 24 
hours earlier, but riot police 

remained on guard. 
Authorities outside the capital 

continued taking action against 
student threats to form 
disturbances nationwide. Several 
provincial universities had 
already been occupied by police, 
or warned to the mark by the 
Army.

On the Feast of St. James 


This is the fourth part of a series on Humanae Jitae by Michael Hollerich and Michael Patrick 0 'Connor. 

William G. Storey, a Church Historian in the Theology Dept., was among the members of our community who signed the Washington Statement against Humanae Jitae. . His reactions to the encyclical were expressed in strong terms of frustration and bewilderment. For years he has agitated for realistic changes in the structure of the Church in the face 
. of new situations. His criticisms, like those of so many aroused Catholics, cannot be dismissed as disguised apostasy, but are motivated by a deep love and concern for the Church. 
1 One such new situation is the changed role of women in society; they have traditionally been treated as "something less than fifth-class slaves." But the 

·Church has steadfastly resisted recognizing this, and part of the contraception struggle has been based on 
. an unwillingness to admit that women could, or would want to, take a hand in more avenues in life than had previously been open to them. Much of this clerical intransigence he finds to be just another instance of the innate conservatism of entrenched institutionalism, a phenomenon not unfamiliar to the 
church historian. 
He can admit no defense at all against contraception per se. "The contrived distinct ion between rhythm as a precess in accordence with nature and artificial contraception as a hiatus of the natural process is almost laughable." The proper attitude should not be one of finding some sort of moral loophole for incontinent couples, but of promoting 

 contraception as a positive good which can be fruitfully employed by man. 
The encyclical itself is subjected to similar criticisms: Dr. Storey sees no scriptual actecedents to justify such a decision. Nor can it be accepted as an address 'to all men of good will," since it claims authority by pure fiat, with no pretense of dialogue. "It is unreasonable to ask us to disregard fifteen years of 

. hard work and intense thought when . confronted by argumentation so weak we long ago rejected it." This is the blunder 
we raise questions that strike the foundations of an organization.

The Mail 

Questions such as: Who is running the institution? WhoEditor: wants to run for it? Who is goingHow an institution is to be to run it? This is what the Notre run is a question that is debated Dame community is asking itself endlessly. Only occasionally do of a pope who refused to take the advice of his own commission and who is successfully squandering the good will so painstakingly won under John XXI II. The Papacy had found itself in the unusual position of being listened to because it spoke wisely; apparently it has become uncomfortable with the arrangement and has decided to divest itself of its unfamiliar role of true leadership. 
Rev. James T. Burtchaell, C.S.C., recently appointed chairman of the Theology Department, is preparing an article for publication which will deal with the current dispute. In a recent appearance on WNDU television he displayed a similar cynicism in commenting on the reac;tions of the American episcopacy to the encyclical. He pointed out how cool all the American bishops were in their reactions to Paul's call "No more war, war never again" and the social encyclicals Mater et Magistra and Populorum Progressio. This is in marked· contrast to the present situation in which the bishops are now so concerned that Humanae 11tae be observed in its every precept. 
Rev. John Gerber, CSC, a member of the Notre Dame English Department, specializing in Modern British literature, wrote a brilliant article, published in Commonweal three weeks ago. Recognizing that many Catholics are faced with a "crisis of conscience" by a papal decision with which he too is in strong disagreement, he claims that there is in reality no either-or choice between Church and conscience, but that we must opt for both-and: Church and conscience. He bases his case on what Fr. John Dunne calls Christianity's "judgment of judgment," invoking the famous Pauline psychology of sin (Romans 7) to remind us of the universal which shares the ambivelence of human nature: the Church is both Body of Christ and Grand Inquisitor. We cannot afford to retreat from this moral ambivalence which ambivalence which extends to our very hearts by running from the human condition and becoming "polemicists against life" nor can we become moral vigilantes who hunt down interpretations

divergent from our Rome. Both are profoundly self-deceptive. To both liberals and conservatives Gerber directs the theme of Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor: 
How to lead men out of their subjection to the collective and into fuller possession of their unknown individuality; how to prompt in them the sort of inner freedom and graciousness which can only issue from their living in more conscious and reverential contact with the hidden and finally beneficient irrationality within themselves which they fear and thus-as our political experience teaches us-fasten upon enemies external to themselves. 

An analysis of the Council of Jerusalem (49 A.D.) reveals that the Church has from the beginning tended to define dogmas and to teach morals, not to define morals. By avoiding an absolutizing of categories of expression, the Council succeeded in preventing Christianity's restriction to a Jewish sect. A reexamination of what it means "to define dogma" in view of modern historical consciousness has resulted in a return to the New Testament style of confessing or giving witness to faith in a semi-narrative mode derived from the Old Testament. Thus even the relativity of James' compromise is seen with the disappearance of the four things enjoined upon non J ewi~h and Christian experience: that all honor is due to the 
Lord of all life. 
It is in this desire to remind man of his own insufficiency that Fr. Gerber sees the worth of Paul's encyclical. For our modern sin is "our secret, obscene urge to rationalize, mechanize and control the very springs and hidden sources of life in us; to achieve, if possible, even a 'mechanical operation of the spirit' through chemicals and electricity." The encyclical sets itself resolutely against this radically irregligous impulse to control life from within. The ground theme of 
Humanae litae is its insistence on the worth of our deeper desires, perhaps unrecognizable at the time; it is a valid warning against human hubris.

Four New Student Judicial Boards Operating 
BY DAVID FROMM 
Fur the first time in Notre Dame history an organized judicial system run by the students has been established and is now in operation. The new program will consist of four boards: the hall judicial boards, the campus judicial board, the lriparti t c board, and the off-campus board. "The main purpose of I he new system," said Dave Ryan, chairman of the campus judicial board, "is to unify the hall boards in procedure. 
"When you go before the hoard you should know what to expect. Thus, the whole idea of this situation is fairness to the student. We realize the system has faults, but are continually working on a more solid system." 
Individual hall boards will be comprised of eleven members and will have jurisdiction over the violations of its residents occuring in the hall. The campus judicial board will have the responsibility of making sure that established court procedure is followed and that just and unbiased decisions arc rendered by the hall boards. "This will 

bring about more uniformity," said Ryan. "In previous years one hall might impose a $5 fine for drinking in the dorm. A not her might evict a student for the same violation." The campus board will also try violations which do not come under the jurisdiction of the hall boards. It will be composed of 25-40 members including seniors, juniors, and sophomores. 
Any student who feels that he has not received a just decision from eil her board may appeal the tripartite board. The hoard consists of one member from the administration, one from the faculty, and one from the student body, all of whom arc appointed by the Student Life Council. 
Fifteen to twenty seniors, juniors, and sophomores compr isc the off-campus judicial board. Its administrative and court procedure is much the same as the campus judicial board.

Now And '72 

The radicals find the Clllirc present day American political system sickening and they arc making it known that they do. The liberals, Kennedy and McCarthy supporters among them, are sick of Election Year 'Ms. These young liberals might as well be classed with the quiet law-abiding citizens Richard Nixon calls his Silent Americans._ 
When llubert llumphrcy won in Chicago, the radicals and liberals lost. It is doubtful !hat Humphrey will continue winning. When he goes down he will drag with him good men, McCarthy and Kennedy supporters. Men like O'Dwyer and Lowenstein in New York, Joe Clark in Pennsylvania, McCovern in South Dakota, and Brademas in Indiana. O'Dwyer aiHl Lowenstein have not endorsed the Hump. The others have given him token endorsement. Nonetheless, all share the Democratic ticket with the Vice-President. They will all share in his defeat unless they receive split ticket votes or New Politics Party. If they do, what little is left to be won will be lost in November. 
McCarthy and Kennedy workers proved that creative student power docs exist. With Los Angeles and Cliicago in th~ past, nobody blames them for lacking enthusiasm at present. Gene McCarthy asked that his ideas be carried through on stale and local levels. If this is not done, if students sit and pout because they didn't get their way, their role in Politics '6R will deserve the often suggested epithet "A Children's Crusade." 
South 13cnd Congressman John Bradcrnas is in very real danger of defeat at the hands of Will Erwin, the llappy Hoosier. Brademas voted fer McCarthy. lie deserves student support for other reasons as well. Bradcmas, a former Rhodes Scholar, is an influential member of the !louse Education and Labor Commillce. lie has sponsored numerous education bills. lie taught political science at Saint Mary's College in '57-'SR, :111d is a nember of the Saint Mary's College Board of Trustees. Through llradcmas, Saint Mary's got a government loan for the new classroom hl1ilding and funding for the Upward Bound program initiated in South Bend this summer. Brademas is not a McCarthy or a Kennedy, but he too has responded to the same concerns as students have. Farmer Will Erwin has not. 
It is here in Soul h Bend that Brademas needs help. Students have the power to give him that help. Arter the convention, an NBC newsman made this prediction: if Kennedy and McCarthy supp,.rtcrs can learn as much in the next four years as the Mississippi l'reedom Democrats have in the last four, they will have their convention in 1972. It could happen.

Nixon Men To Organize 
At 7:00 tonight Notre Dame Students for Nixon will hold its first meeting of the school year in I 23 Nieuwland Science Hall. According to Tom Thrasher, co-chairman of the campus Nixon group, this evening's meeting will be used to establish a membership list, find potential hall co-ordinators, and discuss practical ways ND students can help in the drive to make Richard Nixon president. 
"more than door-bell ringers" were being sought. "While we want to get as many act ivc campaigners as possible for Mr. Nixon," he explained, "we're hoping that everyone who is in favor of Mr. Nixon and what he stands for will show that support by joining the organization." The absence of membership dues helps to keep expenses down and what few costs there are arc covered by voluntary contributions.
