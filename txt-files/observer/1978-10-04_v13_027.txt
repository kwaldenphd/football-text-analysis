HPC votes to draft proposal on parietals 
by Ruth Kolcun 
The Hall Presidents Council (HPC) last night voted unani­mously to draft a proposal to redefine parietals as a hall offense, in a manner similar to marijuana and alcohol use. Jayne Rizzo, judicial coordinator, told the HPC in the Sorin Hall Chapel that ''viewed in its proper perspective, parietals should be, by definition, a hall offense." 
The proposals on parietals will be presented to both the Campus Life Council on Monday and the Board of Trustees at their Oct. 12 meeting, according to Andy McKenna, student body president. 
Rizzo described the proposal as one that calls for a change in the jurisdiction of parietals, rather than a change in the rule itself. 
"We simply want to share jurisdiction with the University over the present system of pari­etals,'' Rizzo said. 
The proposal calls for categoriz­ing parietal violatons as "hall" offenses rather than "university" offenses. 
"There already exists an infor­mal policy on campus of keeping first and non-serious violations on the hall level at the discretion of the rector. We would like to have that policy formali2;ed and have the responsibility shared by the J-Boards and the rectors," Rizzo said. 
Rizzo's observations on the nature of the "informal" enforce­ment was a reference to a state­ment made by Dean of Students James Roemer at the Student Rights Forum last week. Roemer said that parietals were a "privacy and quiet hours kind of thing," and their enforcement is ''frequently kept on the hall level anyway." 
In other business, Chuck DelGrande, HPC chairman, told the council that the United Way Campaign ends Thursday, and Joan Jacobsen, Student Union representative, announced that homecoming packages--consisting of tickets to the Pittsburgh game, Neil Young concert, and the home­coming dance--are still available.

SMC faculty discusses mandatory retirement 
by Margie Brassil 
Members of the Saint Mary's Faculty Assembly discussed a reso­lution on compulsory retirement yesterday afternoon in Carroll Hall with Prof. Anthony Black, chair­man, presiding. 
Accorping to the new law passed by Congress, no one can be made to retir~ before the age of 70. However, there is an exception to this law which excludes college professors until June 30, 1982. This would mean that all professors reaching age 65 between Jan. 1, 1979, and June 30, 1982, could be made to retire, despite the new mandatory age of 70. 
Bob Borengasser, Business/ Economics instructor; Prof. Peter Smith of the Department of Mathe­matics, Prof. Deanna Sokolowski of the Department of English and Prof. Sylvia Dworski of the Depart­ment of Modern Languages pro­posed that the assembly implement a resolution that would give profes­sors the same rights as all emplo­yees to detain retirement until age 70. 
The proposal states that this policy would be equal and just to professors who otherwise are being discriminated against by the new law. 
Prof. Charles Poinsatte, Depart­ment of History, proposed that an ad hoc committee be appointed to look at the number of professors affected by the retirement law, the cost factor of their . lengthened teaching careers to the College and the effect that situation would have on tenure. 
There was some concern among the assembly member's as to whether the committee would look at the long-range retirement pic­ture or just this three-year period. It finally was resolved that an ad hoc committee should deal only with the three-year issue.-Long­range matters concerning faculty and administration will be explored by the standing Faculty Affairs Committee. 
Assembly members also dis­cussed English Department Prof. Tom Selsor's proposal for revision of the Rank and Tenure Committee which gives final recommendations to the president on faculty promo­tions and dismissals. According to Selsor, the idea behind this propo­sal was to give the faculty a more independent voice from the admini­stration. 
Selsor favors an all-faculty mem­bership of this committee which is composed of three faculty members and two administrative representa­tives under his proposal, commit­tee membership would be presi­dent and three faculty members chosen by the Faculty Assembly. 
Smith raised a recommendation 
that an ad hoc committee be 
appointed to study the proposal 
and report back to the assembly 
before the end of the year. This 
recommendation was approved, 
but Poinsatte moved that a report­
ing date for the committee be set 
for Feb. 1, 1979. This was also 
[Continued on page 2] works bill. 

''They could not come up with anything that was acceptable," the official said. He said Carter rejected compromise offers be­cause they would have been incon­sistent with the president's attempts to fight inflation and aid costs, claim it would be cheaper than Carter's proposal. 
The measure was passed last week but congressional leaders held onto it while compromise talks were under way. : 
Deputy press secretary Rex Granum said the biO, which con­tains 53 new water projects includ­ing 27 Carter didn't request, arrived at the White House late Monday. 
One White House source said Carter has until midnight Oct. 13 to act on the bill, or it becomes law without his signature. 

the poor. 
At his news conference last 
Thursday, Carter had declared, 
"If we contin11e the age-old policy 
of pork barrel allocations in the 
public works bill, this is a horrible 
example to set for the rest of the 
country." 
Two days later, Senate Majority 
Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W. Va., 
one of Carter's staunchest support­
ers on Capitol Hill, chastised the 
president. 
"Pork barrel -that's a code 
word, a buzz word that's been 
thrown around promiscuously for 
years about the public works 
appropriations bill," Byrd said, 
adding: 
"But if one has to shovel black 
mud out of his house or see the 
lives of his family snuffed out by a 
sudden flood, that flood control 
project is not pork barrel." 
Byrd vowed to vo.·ork for an 
override of the anticipated Carter 
veto. 
The White House official con­
ceded that Congress probably will 
override the veto. The measure 
passed both houses by margins 
much larger than the two-thirds 
majorities needed to put the mea­
sure into effect without the presi­
dent's signature. And the Demo­
cratic leaders in the House have 
joined Byrd in promising to fight a 
veto. 
"It's going to be extremely difficult. The odds are against us,'' the official saidd. "But the president said he would have . vetoed the damned thing if he had 
only one vote." . 
The White House figures the bill 
would cost $1.8 billion more than 
Carter requested.

counting only the first year's cost of 
projects instead of the traditional 
method of counting full, mult-year

MANAGUA, Nicaragua [AP) -Gun-toting Sandinista guerrillas--not the traditional cowboy or cop--are the new heroes of Nicaraguan youths.

OAKLAND [API -William and Emily Harris, who a month ago said they were proud they kidnapped Patricia Hearst, were sentenced yesterday to 10 years to life in prison for the crime. They had plea-bargained Aug. 31, and officials said they could probably be released from prison in five years. The Harrises were sentenced on four counts of kidnapping, false imprisonment and armed robbery in connection with the Hearst abduction.

Toohey speaks on alcohol 
by Rick Travers 
"Freshmen often get caught in a vicious stereotype of the macho ND student, and there is much concern here about it," was Campus Minis­try Director Rev. William Toohey's comment on the recent uproar over alcohol abuses on the Notre Dame campus. 
At a small, informal gathering in the basement of Flanner Hall last night, Toohey stressed Notre Dame's dedication to the total educational experience as the reason for the University's interest in combating this problem which he · indicated as "surprisingly bad." 
According to Toohey, the in­fluences and expectations put on students here to drink are a violation of their integrity and freedom. He stated that the attitude toward drinking must change if the University is to continue to provide a fine educa­tional experience. 
"There must be enough imagination and ingenuity on this campus for students to socialize without having to pack 100 people into a small room with the music so loud you con't even talk to the person next to you," Toohey added. 
He reiterated his belief that students should have a say in University regulations that involve them, including alcohol consump-· tion on campus. Students must take it upon themselves to insure responsible drinking, according to Toohey, and thereby eliminate the present friction between them­selves and the University on this issue. 
However, the Campus Ministry director seemed to show little faith that the students could accomplish this task. Referring to recent editorials in the Observer which stressed the maturity of college students in handling alcohol consumption, Toohey stated that
