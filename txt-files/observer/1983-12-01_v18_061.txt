Hail Liberty Bowl, capacityfilled, Notre Dame football is with you, Blessed are you among bowlgames, and blessed is ourportion, yourproceeds. Ho~v Liberty Bowl, contributorpar excellence, pay us our advance now and the remainder at kickoff 

The acceptance of the Liberty Bowl bid last week is an all-time low in the history ofcollege sports. The deci­sion affected not only Notre Dame football, but all col­lege programs because the the idyllic crusader for intercollegiate honesty is a hypocrite. 
No longer is Notre Dame a shining example of frurplay and honesty. Instead, because of a closed door meeting of the Faculty Board in Control of Athletics, Notre Dame now sits at the same table as N.C.A.A. 
Some argue the bowl bid should he accepted because minority students will benefit from the proceeds. Such thinking, however, is racist indeed. 
The University has put itself in quite an awkward situation if it truly supports minority scholarships. Are minorities, then, only to receive help if Notre Dame football teams go to a bowl? What kind ofa commitment is that to minority students? 
Actual howl proceeds will total little more than S6SO.OOO. And Athletic Director Gene Corrigan admits much of that will go to travel and lodging expenses for the team and band. 

Is lily-white Notre Dame helping minority students when it sits atop a S200 million endowment? 
Another sad product of the bowl hid is the way in which died-in-the-wool Notre Dame fans are literally caught in the all too familiar game of the "fair·weather 
fan."

Inside Thursday 
With high held Catholic guilt, fans are cast into the ultimate dilemma-ifthey do not support Notre Dame football when it falls flat on its face, they consider them· selves only "sunshine patriots." Many feel they should in good conscience celebrate the supposed joy of the Liberty Bowl bid. 
In this case, however, the true fan of Notre Dame must cry out agrunst such a perversion ofprinciples. Notre Dame has manipulated such guilt to the point 
where many concerned persons will not speak out against the bowl bid, be­cause Gerry Faust is 
cared about what students sajd before this incident. Why then do administrators fall back upon a student vote now? Are they trying to hide something? 
The Liberty Bowl docs not give a damn about Notre Dame's now-tarnished commitment to its principles or its record. 
It only wants Notre Dame because ofthe University's football tradition, and the money its fans will bring to Memphis. 
In referring to Notre Dame's decision to accept the hid, a Liberty Bowl representative told Ray Sons of the Chicago Sun-Times last week, "They are a great attrac· tion at 6-S, or whatever they arc." 
Indeed, whatever are we?

Survey reveals desires for campus changes 
ByJIM STONE 
News Staff 
Improved student fucilities in the LaFortune Center and more diver­sified campus activities were among the most requested campus im­provements by students in a survey conducted by the the Student Uni­on. 
"Our one objective, is to make people more involved in Student Union commissions and more aware of them," explained survey or­ganizer Jim Hennigan. Another goal of the poll was to come up with some ideas for a proposd Student Union night which is being planned for Dec. 8, he continued. 
The survey, which was contrived and distributed by the senior com­misioners of the Student Union, received more than 400 hundred responses, Hennigan explained. The Ombudsman office compiled writ­ten requests as well as phone sur­veys. 
Other ideas from the survey included; a campus restaraunt, a north quad laundry, more recent films, and career days. 
Hennigan reported that the responses revealed "a general ig­norance" about current Student Uni­on commissions. "I suppose what we're involved in is more of an awareness campaign of what the committees do," Hennigan said. 
The committee will be presenting the Student Union's operations to in­terested students on student Union night, which Hennigan said will be a "recruiting night" to garner interest for the commissions. He added that commissioners will have to "set goals to use more people and to ta:.:e a more active role in delegating authority." 
As a follow-up, January 18 has been designated the preliminary date for a leadership workshop in· tended to "overhaul" the commis­sions, Hennigan added 

Bus strikers consider new contract proposal 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Assisted by government mediators, a umon representing striking Greyhound Bus Lines workers considered making a contract counter-proposal yesterday in a quest to end a 28-day walkout. 
Meanwhile, a Greyhound spokes­woman said the company would resume bus service in nine more states by the end of the year. Greyhound, which served 48 states before the strike began Nov. 2, resumed limited service in 27 states on Nov. 17. 
One day after Greyhound managers in Phoenix, Ariz., vowed to "go forward full bore" with hiring replacements for the some 12,700 strikers, the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions was secluded in a downtown hotel here reassessing its position in the labor dispute. 
There was no early indication whether the strategy session, at­tended by federal mediator Sam Franklin, would lead to a revised uni­on negotiating stance or new direct talks between between union and Greyhound representatives. 
Later, Kay McMurray, director of the Federal Mediation and Concilia­tion Service, conferred with union leaders. As he left the hotel, repor­ters asked him whether the strike was going to end soon. He replied: "there's always room for opitimism," but the mediator refused to elaborate on that remark. 
One union official said members of the ATU bargaining council were continuing to meet among them­selves late in the day "to find out where we stand, and to find out what it's going to take to get them (Greyhound negotiators) back to the bargaining table." 
The strategy sessions were likely to continue today, said the official, who cited the union's self-imposed news blackout as the reason for his speaking anonymously. 
Sources fumiliar with the strike, who also declined to be identified publicly, said it was unlikely that federal mediators would summon Greyhound officials to the nation's capital for new negotiations in the absence of a new proposal by the union. 
John W. Teets, Greyhound's chair­man, had said Tuesday that "we have absolutely no optimism that a settle­ment will be reached." 
Teets, speaking to reporters at Greyhound's corporate headquar­ters in Phoenix, said the company might sell parts of the bus line as in­dividual franchises if it failed to make sufficient profit. 
The union's overwhelming rejec­tion of the company's latest offer ­a modified wage giveback proposal lowering pay cuts from 9.5 percent to 7.8 percent -left Greyhound with no choice but to hire replace­ments for the strikers, Teets said. 
The Amalgamated Transit Union called the strike of its 12,700 mem­bers on Nov. 2, and there have been no negotiations to ·;ettle the dispute >ince Nov. I 7.

ByMARY PACE 
News Staff 
A live jazz band and New Orleans­style food will be featured at this 
year's  campus-wide  Mardi  Gras  
celebration,  according  to  event  
coordinator Karen Klocke.  

This is in addition to the twleve· hour dance·a-thon which has been a part of the celebration for the past two years. Klocke said she hopes these changes will bring back some ofthe Mardi Gras spirit that has been lost over the oast two vears. 
The event is scheduled to begin on Friday, March 2. Also being planned in the Stepan Center is a fac­simile of famous dixieland jazz showcase, Preservation Hall, which will feature a live jazz band and New Orleans-style cuisine. 
Some of the t.vents being con­sidered include hall-sponsored booths in Stepan Center which would be decorated to depict scenes from Bourbon Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, home ofthe original Mardi Gras. 
The dance-a-thon is scheduled to 
be held on the following Saturday 
from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m. 
Up until two years ago, the Mardi Gras celebration featured a casino in 

Stepan Center which included roulette wheels, craps, blackjack, and other games. In 1981, however, the bishop of Fort Wayne-South Bend banned gambling in this diocese. The dance-a-thon replaced the casino following this decision. The proceeds of both events have gone to charity. 
The first organizational meeting of this year's Mardi Gras committee will be held on Thursday, December 8 at 7 p.m. in the Little Theatre in LaFortune. Students interested in helping out with any aspect of the event are invited to the meeting.

Other topics discussed during the meeting included the children of Saint Mary's faculty, who will be treated by the board to an afternoon at the movies. Invitations for this event were incorrectly dated December 14, but the event will be held this Sunday. 
The board decided that a last class day celebration on Dec. 14 was in order. Following classes on that day the College's students are welcome to stop in the Haggar Student Cen­ter, where Christmas cookies will be served. The event is designed to provide a break before the start of final exams.

Andropov illness slows Soviet political scene 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -The usual autumn government and party meetings have not been scheduled yet this year -evidently because President Yuri V. Andropov is too ill to of­ficiate. The strangely quiet political scene has led to speculation about who is running the Soviet Union. 
Soviet sources have indicated in 
past weeks that the country is on a 
kind ofautomatic pilot. 
Western diplomats, asking to remain anonymous, say they think day-to-day foreign policy decisions have been taken over by the military, led by Marshal Dmitri F. Us­tinov. 

The 69-year-old Andropov, his health a question mark since last spring, has not been seen in public since Aug. 18. 
 With so many uncertainties, the focus of attention now is on the failure of authorities here to an­nounce a meeting of the rubber stamp national parliament, the Supreme Soviet. 
This is a country where things 
tend to happen according to plan 
and tradition, and the Parliament 
session and meeting of the Com­
munist Party Central Committee ar~ 
always scheduled by mid­
November. 
The Soviet constitution says the 
legislature must meet twice a year. 
So tar this year it has met only once, 
in june, when Andropov was named 
president, consolidating his ab­
solute hold on power. 
Tradition holds that its meetings are announced 30 days in advance, and Associated Press records dating back two decades show that every session has been preceded by a 30­day notice. 

Those records also show that since 1962 no regular parliamentary 
session has ever been held later than Dec. 18. That was in 1974. Last year the Parlian1ent met on Dec. 22, but that was a special occasion to mark the 60th anniversary ofthe founding of the Soviet Union. 
. Soviets insist that a meeting ofthe Parliament will come in the second half of December. The country still has no formally adopted economic plan or budget for the coming year and those documents are the busi­ness ofthe Parliament. 
Andropov should attend the par­liamentary session as head of state. He reportedly is suffering from a heart and kidney condition and the latest rumors in Moscow say he has lost the ability to walk. Nothing, however, is known for certain about the state of his health. 
Tradition holds that the par­
liamentary sessions are preceded by 
a plenary session ofthe party Central 
Committee. 
At those sessions the ruling Polit­
buro makes top personnel changes 
and dictates the course of foreign 
and domestic policy. 
Unofficial records show 
Andropov's predecessor, Leonid I. 
Brezhnev, was never absent from 
public view for such a long period 
despite serious questions about his 
health dating from the mid-1970s. 
Andropov failed Nov. 5 to attend 
the Kremlin meeting marking the 
Bolshevik Revolution, or the Nov. 7' 
military parade to celebrate the 
event. Brezhnev, despite poor 
health, was at last year's parade and 
stood two. hours in freezing weather 
three days before he died of a heart 
attack.

Murderer executed after 10 years in prison 
Associated Press 
STARKE. Fla. -Robert Sullivan, a convicted murderer who spent ten years on death row, was executed in Florida's electric chair Wednesday after reciting a psalm in tears and thanking PopeJohn Paul II for trying to save his life. 
Sullivan, 36, his blue eyes water­ing, sat in the oaken death chair, took a microphone and read in a clear voice from Psalm 62 written on a legal pad: "and in God alone is my soul at rest, because my hope comes from within." 
A black hood was placed over his head and the executioner, also wearing a black hood, threw a switch sending 2,000 volts of electricity through Sullivan's body for two minutes. 
Sullivan twitched, then was still. He was pronounced dead at 10:16 a.m., six minutes after Gov. Bob Graham gave the go-ahead for the execution, ending a week of frantic legal maneuvering that reached to the U.S. Supreme Court and won the condemned man a briefstay.

Eight other Americans, all men, have been executed since the landmark decision by the Supreme Court to renew the death penalty. 
Sullivan, a Roman Catholic, spent ten years on death row and attempts by lawyers and death penalty foes, and ultimately the pope, carried on until the last moments ofhis life. 
"To all my peers on death row, despite what is about to happen to me, do not quit," Sullivan said. He also thanked the pope for "his per­sonal intervention asking that my life be spared." 
"I hold malice to none. May God bless us all," were his last words. 
Sullivan was sentenced to de::th for the April 9, 1973 robbery and murder of Donald Schmidt, an assis­tant manager at a Howard Johnson's restaurant in Homestead, "outh of Miami. 
Schmidt's credit cards and watch were found on Sullivan when he was arrested. Sullivan contended he was at a homosexual bar 40 miles away at the time of the murder and had wit­nesses to prove it. 
The body was shipped to Nashua, 
N.H. The whereabouts of his adoptive father, a Harvard-educated surgeon, and his mother, was un­known. The couple is divorced. 
Late Monday, a federal appeals court and later the Supreme Court, refused to spare Sullivan's life. A final appeal to the FloridaSupreme. Court and the federal appeals court, claim­ing electrocution constituted cruel and unusual punishment, was rejected in the morning. 
Graham, on an open telephone line with the prison, told Superin­tendent Richard Dugger that the last appeal had failed at 10:10 a.m. "There are no stays. God save us all," Graham said, as quoted by his general counsel, Sydney McKenzie. 
Vatican Radio reported the execu· tion without comment.

They said she was not a victim but a "victimizer" who used her EPA position secretly to tip off her for­mer employer, Aerojet-General Corp., and to help Republican politicians. 
Defense attorney James Bier­bower said Ms. Lavelle, the only EPA official to face criminal charges, had been made a "scapegoat" in a con­troversy surrounding the toxic waste program that eventually led to the resignation of former EPA ad­ministrator Anne M. Burford. 
While Lavelle dabbed tears from 
her eyes, Bierbower said she might 
have made some inaccurate state­
ments, but he blamed them on a 
faulty memory and not on any willful 
attempt to lie to Congress. 

She is charg~d with lying when she denied helping Republican can­didates and of lying about the date she first learned that Aerojet had dumped wastes at the Stringfellow Acid Pits in California. 
In his closing argument, prosecutor William Hendricks said Lavelle continued to handle the Stringfellow case because she wanted to "ingratiate" herself with her former company. 
Bierbower, in closing, said Lavelle's only crime was trying too hard to do her job. 
"Her work was her life and she cared about cleaning up America and helping the people," he said. "She came in and got things done and some of these longtime career people (at EPA) were not too happy with this hard-driving woman."

Euromissile deployment: upping the ante 
Editor's note: This is the second in a two-part series examining the deph~yment of U.S. missiles in Western Europe. 
lkspite tht:ir provocative and threatening qualities, the new U.S. missiles beingdeployed in Europe :tre militarily superfluous. The United States has already targeted everything worth ~argeting in the Soviet Union with our .30,000 or so other warhead'>.  
Michael L. Brennan 

And so it goes 
Then why deploy? To calm European kars of the United States "decoupling" from the defense of Europe, and to exhibit to the Soviet Union the political unity and resolve of the Atlantic Alliance. The issue has become a hattie hetweeen the superpowers for the hearts and minds of Europeans. 
The Alliance has held up under strain remarkably well thus far, but the consensus is disintegrating rapidly in the face of domestic politic.:al opposition in Europe. Nowhere is this more evident than in West Germany, the linchpin country. 
The opposition party. the Sodai-Democrats, voted overwhelmingly ( .3H.3 to 
14) against deployment last week, and polls 
indicate that 70 percent of West Germans are opposed to deployment. The final vote in the Bundestag followed party lines ( 286 to 226) in favor ofdeployment, but came after an em­bittered 13-hour debate. Thinking ahead, what happens if the Social-Democrats come into power after deployment? Will the missiles be sent back with no return address? 
Both Kohl and Thatcher were elected more on the basis of their domestic economic policies than on their pro-missile stances, and both are meeting stiff anti-missile opposition. The European peace movement, which may tum violt:nt, has scheduled major demonstra­tions for December 12, the fourth anniversary ofNATO's "dual-track" decision. 
In the now-defunct INF Talks, both sides were guilty of intransigence and propaganda ploys. It appears that the final Soviet offer, dis­mantling down to 120 SS-20s, was the most magnanimous and realistically acceptable proposal, yet it was rejected by the United States. 
Some Reagan critics have charged that the llnited States wanted deployment all along in order to regain nuclear superiority in Europe. Many think we used the INF Talks as a means of placating public opposition, and to make the Soviets appear as the villians. 
In deploying 572 new missiles, NATO will 
be committing itself to dependence upon this 
nuclear crutch in the event ofa westward con­ventional attack by the Soviet Union. Cheaper 

than conventional forces, nuclear weapons provide "more bang for the buck." 
The West European governments are happy to accept the missiles free ofcharge since they hesitate to increase defense expenditures in the face ofhigh unemployment and economic recession. Short-term economic considera­tions and expediency could have the gravest ofconsequences. 
Contrary to what many Americans believe, it is the United States expressed policy to use nuclear weapons first, to initiate nuclear war, in the defense of Westen Europe. By increas­ing our dependence upon nuclear weapons, we are lowering this "nuclear threshold." 
Prominent defense specialists such as Robert MacNamara (former Secretary of Defense), McGeorge Bundy (former N a tiona! Security Advisor), George Kennan (former Ambassador to the Soviet Union), and Gerald Smith (Salt II negotiator) have repeatedly argued for a conventional build-up offorces in Western Europe, rather than a nuclear one. Pursuing such a policy would enable the United States to declare a "No First Use" of nuclear weapons policy, as the Soviet Union did in June of 1982 before the United Nations General Assembly. Their reco~mendations have been refuted by the Reagan Administra­tion. 
The primary dilemna we face in this age of nuclear overkill is that more missilt:s no lon­ger ensure greater security, or buy greater political influence. Locked within the framework of nuclear deterrence, we have come to base our military strategy on percep­tions, rather than reality. We deploy more missiles as a statement of "resolve" or "will," rather than out ofmilitary necessity. 
The NATO deployment decision was flawed from the start, as we put ourselves to the test in a virtual "no-win" situation. Hopes for arms control look dismal. There is mount­ing opposition in Europe to deployment, and the Soviets are preparing counter­deployment sites. The situation will get much worse before it gets better. It is frightening that Reagan and others are viewing the recent Soviet walkout as some sort of U.S. "victory." 
In the face ofa crisis situation developing in Europe, we must avoid the smug com­placency ofviewing deployment as a political victory for the West, and realize that the Soviets are not about to buckle under. 
The true outcome has been unnecessary political damage to the Alliance (the full ef­fects ofwhich have yet to be seen), a growing European distrust ofAmerican motives, a fur­ther escalation of the arms race, increased U.S.-Soviet tensions, and therefore, an in­creased likelihood ofnuclear conflict. 
In that respect, we are all losers. 



Does God deserve God's own pronoun? 
Seated at tht· dinner table with a Thanksgiv­ing meal spread before him, my father began a traditional (if not outdated) blessing with tht words, "Lord God, Kingofthe Universe ... " 
"And Queen," my mother interrupted, unwilling to let the sexist reference pass. 
Keith Picher 

Profundity's demise 
"What?" my father asked, temporarily forgetting that ht· was in the middle ofa bless­ing. 
"God is no more a king than a queen," she added. 
"Lord (;od, King and Queen of the llni­verst·." he continued awkwardly, having lost his original train of thought. 
Many havt" criticized recent attempts to remove sexist language from prayer and scripture. Some right-wingers think these ef­torts are frivolous feminist ploys, and dismiss them with a "much ado about nothing" at­titude. 
Even left-wingers were upset by a recent "non-sexist" le<:tionary, published by a group ofwould-be theologians. Sifting through their versions ofwell-known passages ofthe Bible is like walking through a minetield. It's almost as if they typed the old lectionary into a com­puter and had the machine replace every "His" with "God's" and every "Son" with "Child" (as if Jesus were some sort of androgynous creature.) 
Feminists should be concerned about ex­clusive language, whether in everyday con­versation or liturgy. 
But the crime in exclusive "God talk" is not that it is unfair to women. rather it promotes an incredibly narrow vision ofGod. 
Everyone realizes that God is neither male or female in the same sense humans are (God has little need to reproduce.) Calling God a 

"he" is at best a metaphor, if not merely a weakness in human language. 
Some believe we arbitrarily assign the pronoun "he" to God in the same way ships and nature are seen as feminine. Of course there's nothing wrong with referring to a ship or nature as "it," though treating God as an "it" seems silly. 
Traditionalists who think God must be a "he" evidently understand "he" as the proper pronoun for the antecedent "Father." Since "Father" is only a metaphor, why should all other descriptions be inappropriate. Would Homer have wanted all literature from The Odyssey onward to refer to dawn as rosy­fingered? 
The point is, we shouldn't fool ourselves in­to thinking the pronoun "he" or the noun "Father" is anything more than a metaphor which stresses similarities, but is by nature quite incomplete, as any idea we have ofGod must be. In fact, many of the images Jesus of­fers for "The Father" gain strength from their differences, not similarities, to humans. 
So what pronoun should we usc for God, or 
does God deserve an exclusive one? 

Many who teach theology at Notre Dame 
and Saint Mary's avoid the whole mess by 
referring to God not as a he, she or it, but God: "God loved the world so much God sent God's only son." Proponents note that such language treats God differently than men, women and things -elevating God properly. 
Which is more important -avoiding a nar­row vision ofGod or avoiding pronouns com­pletely? The only compromise would be to invent a new pronoun which means "God's." Perhaps we could use "Az" as the pronoun form for God (the alpha and the omega) and "Azs" as the possesive pronoun. 
Perhaps this formulation seems a bit forced. But after thousands of years of calling God "He," how could one avoid sounding strange and different. 
When we stop referring to God exclusively as "He," we will make more of a statement about ourselves than God.

Dear Editor: 

Pt·rhaps "C::mpus t·omments," would become less of a lunchtime laughter and gain some respt.·ct if you would represent more dif­ferent kinds of people here. For instance, when you asked,"lf Notre Dame went dry, would you move off-campus?" you asked two engineers and two pre-meds (four throats).

Academic slums 
Dear Eel/tor: 

In James Carberry's editorial, "There's no business likt" bowl business," he refers to two State universities, the University of Nebraska and the: University ofOklahoma, as "acadt·mic slums." The remark is an insult to the Regents, the professors, the students and the graduates 
ofthe two schools, and it smacks ofelitism. 
While I have not attended the University of Nebraska, I can say that my relatives and friends who have graduated from the Univer­sity show no signs ofdeprivation from spend­ing four years in an academic slum. On the contrary, they have been well-educated and are very saccessful in professional occupa­tions. 
The administrators of state universities at­tempt to provide a gcnd education which is available and affordable to all those who wish to attt"nd -something that Notre Dame can­nor do. State universities provide a valuable public service and should not be derided be­cause they have priorities and limitations dif­ferent from Notre Dame's. People inside Notre Dame are fond ofcalling the University great. Do tht"y arrive at this conclusion by snet"ring at state schools? I hope not.

Kennedy article 
DearEditor: 

I was surprised and somewhat disappointed with Max Lerner's assessment ofJohn F. Ken­nedy's presidency in his article of November 22 (John F. Kennedy's Camelot Legend). Ler­ner refers to Kennedy's assassination as the 
death ofthe sorcerer and depicts the Kennedy character as one ruled by fun and playful­
ness. 

This is clearly a shortsighted analysis of a man shown to be America's favorite President by a latest Newsweek poll. It is unlikely that the American public could be so easily misled. There was obviously something behind the Kennedy mystique. Even Richard Nixon, after having been defeated hy Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, pointed out that no one can steal an election. 
Kennedy raised the nation's hopes like no other. The temptation for many historians is to blame him for not following through. Professor Lerner writes, "The reality about Kennedy is that all his life seemed to bt" a preparation for something that never came off." However, we cannot afford to overlook Kennedy's own words that although we are "rejoicing in hope," we must also be "patient in tribulation." I would suggest that Lerner reasses Kennedy and see him as he saw him­self, "an Idealist without illusions."

MISSION, Kan. -The NCAA ended a 19-month investigation of the University of Kansas yesterday hy handing the Jayhawks a two-year foothall prohation, which includes one year ofsanctions. 
The NCAA said in a release that Kansa.~ will not he eligihle for a postseason football appearance following the 1984 foothall season and that the Jayhawks may not ap­pear on television that year. 
The NCAA noted none of the ath· letic department staff memhers involved in what it called "significant violations" remained at the university. However, it said a for­mer assistant football coach -who was not named -must remain separated "from any involvement in the university's intercollegiate ath­letics program for a period of three years beginning Nov. 21, 198.3." 
Violations cited in the release in­cluded offering large amounts of money and henefits to prospective players; providing prospects with expense-paid visits to the campus; providing employment to athletes and filing false statements that Kansa.~ was in compliance with NCAA rules.

"It's wonderful that Larry Holmes ha.o; the finances and sustenance to retire. It is better for him to quit one punch too soon than one punch too late."

Page said the public would accept the winner of an elimination bout between him and Witherspoon as champion. 
"I've been guaranteed this shot and I'm gonna get this shot," he said, "with or without Larry Holmes." 
But both Page and his attorney, Miller, insisted there will be no tournament of top contenders to replace Holmes should the champ retire. 
"We're looking at one fight for the title," Miller said. "The top two guys should fight. If Holmes and Page don't fight, then it should be Greg and Witherspoon."

New method to select track Hall ofFamers 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS New procedures for selecting inductees into the relocated U.S. Track and Field Hall ofFame were approved by a committee of The Athletics Congress as th-:: organization began its annual convention yesterday. 
The Hall of Fame is scheduled to be moved to Indianapolis from Char­leston, W.Va, next fall. It will be housed in the new Hoosier Dome. 
"We want to create a Hall ofFame 

of the athletics community, not just 
TAC," said TAC Executive Director 
Ollan Cassell. 
The selection procedures ap­proved yesterday by the TAC Hall of Fame Committee will be used for the first time in 1984 and are not subject to approval by delegates to the organization's five-day conven­tion which ends Sunday. 
The selection procedure will begin with submission of nomina­tions fromJanuary through March I. 
The nominations would include three categories -athletes, coaches and contributors. 
TAC members, the Track and Field Writers of America, and TAC affiliate members such as the NCAA and the National Coaches Associa­tion would be able to submit nominations. 
Individuals would have to be out of senior competition for at least three years to be eligible for nomina­tion. 
An athlete would also need to have met specific criteria, such as having set a world or American record, won a world championship or Olympic gold medal, have led world or American competition in an event for three years, won at least four national championships and ac­hieved some other outstanding ac­complishment at the national or international level. 
A committee of 14 that would in­clude athletes, coaches, officials, media representatives and TAC would then review nominations to select candidates for consideration by a national panel ofapproximately 550-575 voters. 
The four nominees receiving the most votes each year and any others receiving at least 51 percent of the vote would be inducted. 
Cassell said he anticipated growing interest in the new facility and said it might obtain national sponsorship. There was also a pos­sibility traveling exhibits would be created to be moved around the na­tion. 
About 550 delegates are meeting ~t the convention. Most major legislation, on topics such as drug testing and awarding of sites for future national competitions, is ex­pected to be voted on Sunday. 
The lengthy process of selecting track and field officials for the 1984 Summer Olympics also was com­pleted yesterday, but selections are not scheduled to be announced un­tiiJanuary. 
As the host nation for the Los An­geles Olympic Games, TAC selects officials for the sport because it is the national governing body. 
"We began with some 600 ap­plicants who had to meet specific criteria of experience," said Frank Greenberg, chairman of the officials selection committee. "That group 
200. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for most and we created a selection process that we think has produced the the most experienced group of officials ever assembled." 
Greenberg said applicants had to make their desire to officiate in Los Angeles known in December 1981. 
"We then rated them during 1982 and had directors of every major meet in the nation, plus our own ob­servers, evaluate the officials," he said. 
"This year we've held meetings to decide the selections," said Green­berg. ''I'd estimate the six members on the committee spent about 100 hours in meetings to make the selec­tions. I know we're going to hurt some feelings and some people will feel dejected but I believe we've come up with a group the country can be proud ofin Los Angeles."

Then, on Tuesday night, Holmes told The Associated Press that he could announce his retirement as early as next week. He had scheduled a press conference at his hotel in Phillipsburg, NJ., for next Wednesday, but then called it off. 
Originally, the champion had planned to criticize WBC officials for threatening to withdraw title recognition from him if he refused to fight Page, but then it appeared he might use the occasion to announce his retirement. 
"It's not definite I will announce it next week, but ifnot, it will be in the very near future," Holmes told the AP. "I told my wife in the ring (after his one-round knockout of Marvis Frazier last Friday night) that I was through. I told her again tonight
