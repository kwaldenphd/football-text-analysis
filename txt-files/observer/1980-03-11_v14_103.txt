At Literary Festival, Hare huntors audience 
by Pam Degnan Senior StaffReporter 
''The theater is a rough and nasty place," explained David Hare, the British playwright and author of the controversial play Teeth 'N' Smiles. Hare was the second of a series of authors who will visit the campus this week as part of the 1980 Sophomore Literary Fes­tival. 
Hare humored a moderate­sized audience in Washington Hall last night with his reflec­tions on the "plight of a 
playwright''  and  the  super­ 
ficiality  of  the  American  
theater.  

Hare revealed to the audi­ence that a playwright must do what he can to raise the level of consciousness of the individual. The noted author stressed that an artist should not have to worry about the threat of cen­sorship. Hare commented on the recent ND SMC production of his play Teeth 'N' Smzles as an example of ''Catholic cen­sorship.'' 
"I can't understand why Catholics always have the urge to censor 'questionable' mater­ial. Everytime I write, I feel that I'm writing for a fanatic rel­igious sect," Hare said. 
"I've heard that Americans absolutely hate sex, drugs, and profanity--strip those from Teeth 'N' Smiles and all that _remains is absolutely nothing," 
the playwright added. 
Hare then captivated the 
audience with his reflections on 
his "humble origins" as the 
director of a small travelling 
theater group. The theater 
group, accordmg to Hare, had 
an "excess of capital" of $30 
and lived day-to-day out of a 
van. 
"If I learned anything from 
that experience, it was that one 
can not just 'get by' --it is the 
death of art. We should not be 
concerned with making money. 
Somehow if you don't think 
about money, it will eventually 
pop up along the way,'' Hare 
explained. 
The playwright then ad­
dressed the problems surround­
ing the American theater. 
"In the U.S., theater is 
geared towards the decorative. 
You don't value the moral arts 
as much as we do in England. 
Perhaps you have much more 
confidence in your society,'' 
Hare said. "There is no sub­
stantial role for theater in 
American society.''

Reagan looks to sweep South in today'Sprimaries 
(AP)-With a timely boost from John B. Connally's with­drawal from the presidential race, Ronald Reagan looked yesterday for a sweep of three Southern Republican primaries. President Carter was a sure bet t'o win big among down-home Democrats. 

Several ticketsfinish close in elections 
by Tom jackman 
Run-offs will be held tomorrow to determine 
Each of the three races were quite close, with 
winners  in  each  of  this  year's  three  class  
elections,  in whic h  initial  balloting  was  held  
yesterday.  

the two finalists never separated by more. than nine votes. Only two votes separ~ted rhe _uckets ofJim Veraldi and Mickey Turza1, who wlll face off in the contest for Senior class office. Nine votes was the difference between Junior class front-runners Michael Cassidy and Rob Ver­furth, and Sophomore class leaders Modesto 

Campus Campaign '80 
Ruggiero and Bill Hennessey were separated by just eight votes. 
Turnout yesterday among students was good, with better than 76 percent of the Freshman class voting, 61. 3 percent of the Sophomores and 
64.3 percent of the Junior class casting ballots. 
Ombudsman Election Chairman Tom Call said he was pleased with the operation of the campaigns and elections. and that_ there were no violations of rules by any of the five Senior, four Junior or four Sophomore class hopefuls. 
In the five-ticket Senior class race, the team of Jim Veraldi (Pres.)-Tim Ronan(VP)-Beth Toomey (Sec.)-Debbie Smith (Treas.) picked up 350 of the 1083 votes cast, or 32.1 percent. Two votes behind was the ticket of Mickey Turzai-J anie Revord-Dave Campbell-Chuck Meakin, which collected 348 votes, also 3'2.1 percent. 
Trailing close behind was the ticket of Keith Melaragno-Steve Notaro-Amy Olin-Bob Gerth with 22.8 percent, followed by the tickets of Chris Nunnelley-Donna Leary-Laura Leitzinger­Tom Jennings and Rockey Bleyer-Steve Laham­Anne Fink-Mary Beth Sterling, which tied with 
6.4 percent each. 
The team of Michael Cassidy-Megan Boyle­Keith Caughlin-Suzie Bautista finished first in Sophomore class balloting with 359 of the 1041 votes cast, 34.5 percent, just ahead of the ticket of Rob Verfurth-Kathy Collins-Kathleen Water­bury-Bob Murfhy, which collected 350 votes or 

33.6 percent o the vote. · 
Finishing behind the two run-off teams were the tickets of Mick Burton-Sue Kloskowski­Stasey Obremskey-Jim Finnerty, which _picked up 20.7 percent of the ballots, and Timothy Brady-Mark Mulholland-Beth Prezio-Matthew Lewis, which garnered 11.2 percent. 
The Freshman class vote was the closest ofall, with only 54 votes separating the first from the fourth finisher. The Modesto Rug~iero-Sara McGrath-Mark Michuda-Bill Mateja ucket cap­tured 258 of the 1204 votes cast for 21.4 percent, but the Bill Hennessey-Jenny Murtaugh-Tom O'Brien-Mike Doyen ticket was only eight votes behind, with 250, for 20.7 percent, to qualify for the run-off. 
Not far behind were the tickets of Robert Powers-Mary Kinsella-Chris Davis-Kathe Calla­han, which picked up 19.4 percent, and Jim DuBoyce-Mary Powel Jabaley-Mike Mills-Mary Coogan, which gained 16.9 percent. 
A statistical breakdown of the Senior class officers election shows that although the Jim Veraldi ticket carried only seven of the 23 halls (including off-campus) to Mickey Turzai's 12 halls, Veraldi captured halls such as Breen­Phillips, Dillon and Zahm by such large margins that he was ·able to gain admittance to the final 
ballot today . 

In Zahm, his home hall, Veraldi was the victor with 53 votes to seven for the other four tickets. Additionally, in Veraldi's vice-president's hall, Tim Ronan ofDillon, his-ticket won by 41 to 13 for the other tickets. 
Tumour was lightest among Sophomore class students, where the fewest voters out of the largest eligible class turned out yesterday. Again, home territory was important to each of the candidates. Mike Cassidy won his own hall

At stake in today' s primaries in Florida, Alabama and Geor­gia are 114 delegates to the GOP National Convention this July and 208 Democratic con­vention delegates. 
George Bush, seemin~ly more concerned about keepmg former President Gerald R. Ford out of the GOP race, says he'd settle for a "respectable" showing against Reagan. ''E­verybody assumes that all three of these states are strong Reagan states, and I know that," Bush said. 
The only other major Repub­licancandtdate,John B. Ander­sen, has no campaign organiza­tion in the three states and does not even appear on the Alaba­ma ballot. He chose instead to 
concentrate  on  the  March  18  
primary in his  home  state  of  
Illinois.  

Reagan was the man to beat in Alabama and Georgia, where he beat Ford by large margins in 1976. In Florida, where he narrowly lost to Ford four years ago, the former California gov­ernor held a coinfortable lead over Bush in the latest polls. 
The polls were taken before Connally dropped out Sunday, the day after he was thrashed by Reagan, 54 percent to 30 percent, in the South Carolina primary. 



Khomeini 

frustrates comnusston 
(AP) Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhol1ah Khomeini set tough new conditions yesterday for any meeting of a U.N. investi­~ating commission with Amer­Ican hostages in Tehran and the commission decided to leave Iran without seeing any of the Americans. 
U.N. Secretary-General Kurt W aldheim issued a statement last night at U.N. headquarters in New York saying the com­mission had suspended its work in Tehran but was prepared to return after consultations in New York. 
Iran's ruling Revolutionary Council, reacting to Khomeini's vow to "fight against the U.S. government until death,'' backed off its demand to take custody of approximately 50 Americans, who yesterday spent their 128th day as prison­ers of Moslem militants occupy­ing the U.S. Embassy. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh met with the five U.N. commissioners for four hours in an unsuccessful effort to persuade them to extend their stay. He told reporters early today the com­missioners, who arrived in Teh­ran Feb. 23, would leave later .in the morning. ''They have been here for 17 days and they couldn't stay any longer," he said. 
The commissioners had been on the verge of leaving last week, but were persuaded to ,stay after it appeared a week­'end meeting with the hostages was possible. 
W aldheim' s statement said the commission, "in the light of .recent developments and after consulting wtth the secretary ~general and Iranian authorities, has decided that it should ~suspend its activities for several 'days." 
It said the commission ts not now in a position to submit its re_port. It is, however, pre­pared to return to Tehran in accordance with its mandate and the instructions of the secretary general. when the situation requires.''

While the delegates in the Mock Republican Convention, held this weekend, attempt to catch up on the sleep they lost, George Bush, the candidate selected in the convention as the Republican nominee, will attempt to catch Ronald Reagan in Illinois armed with the support given him by Notre Dame students. 
''The Bush people in Illinois are already using the results from Notre Dame to show that Bush has a base with young people,'' Bill Kresse, Mock Convention chariman, said last night. 
The Mock Convention was an attempt to simulate the political process that will occur at both the Democratic and Republican conventions this year. The convention tried to keep close to the rules of the national conven­tions and to obtain delegates for each state that actually lived in their respective states according to Kresse. "Many states did vote the way their states would," Kresse said.

Because only Republicans are allowed at the national convention and all factions are invited to the Mock, the con­vention this weekend could not be called truly representative, however. 
''The difference was mainly in the population we drew from, that of young people," Kresse commented. Kresse further reasoned that Reagan will be much stronger in Detroit, since only Republicans are allowed. ''There will be a more conser­vative air. Still, the results may be quite the same," Kresse said. 
The results of the Mock Convention have been sent to the news media., and Bush was notified by telephone. The Rupublican National Commit;..., tee and William Simon, th·e individual voted to be Bush's running mate, were each noti­fied by letter about the out­come. 
Problems the convention had involved scheduling of speak­ers, the platform, and keeping a quorum on Wednesday and Thursday nights. Cost was not a problem, according to Kresse, as the convention stayed within budget. 
Scheduling of the actual can­didates as speakers was difficult, Kresse noted, but he ''was quite pleased with the speakers we received." Since the Indiana primary is not until Mary 6, it was not feasible for the candidates to make person­al appearances, Kresse said. 
The Convention is still at­tempting to schedule the candi­dates for visits later on in the year. Bush has indicated he may show up, especially after receiving the support of Notre Dame delegates, according to

that each would appear. 
On the Democratic side, Ted 
Kennedy and Jimmy Carter 
have been given invitations to 
aypear, but Kresse is not aware 
o their situations at the mo­ment. 
Concerning the platform rati­
fication process, Kresse ack­
nowledged that ''there was not 
enough time for the people to 
speak on the issues. I think that 
is unfortunate." 
The convention received many telegrams from candi­dates and the Republican Na­tional Committee pointing out that ''there are only a few truly national universities and of these, most don't have mock conventions, at least not as large," Kresse said. Kresse felt that the delegates were representative ofthe nation as a whole, even when it came down to voting for rock stars Billy 
Joel, Bruce Springsteen and others. 
"On the first ballot of the presidential nomination, it is a tradition to name favorite sons," Kresse explained. 
The near nomination of the Cookie Monster as Bush's run­ning mate was not felt repre­sentative however. ''Everyone was quite tired and in a good mood. The states had already determined they would change their votes before the balloting was over. They were just being silly, " Kresse said.

An Equal Opportunity Employer MIF 
In AugustaHall 


SMC considers ''0-C'' life 
by Toni Aantoos 
As the date for fall room {licks approaches , 
many upcoming seniors and Juniors an:: consi­
dering the advantages of "off-campus life on 
campus" in Augusta Hall at Samt Mary's 
College. 
Augusta Hall is a self-governing dormitory. The residents still must abide by all the college policies, but there is no one to supervise or check up on the students. The girls are on their honor to conduct themselves as responsible, respec­table adults. 
The building itself belongs to the Sisters of 
Holy Cross, but they generously allowed half of 
the building to serve as housing for about 65 
SMC students. The unique housing format 
began seven years ago as an experiment. 
Sister Karol Jackowski, director of Residence 
Life at SMC. explained that Augusta was started 
''to offer an alternative small group atmosphere 
for students who are 21.'' Only seniors were 
permitted to live in Augusta in the begmning, 
due more to lottery than by design. 
The wide banistered stairways and floors of 
polished hardwood, the marble statues and the 
ringing of the convent bells all eloquently 
express the tradition and history that is deeply 
rooted in Augusta's past and present. Augusta 
Hall was originally a home for novice nuns; thus, 
the building is revered by many of the nuns. 
All the incoming girls at Augusta are told of its {last, and they respect it. Mary Kay Fabian, a juntor presently livmg in Augusta Hall said ''we respect their (the nuns') wishes.'' She also expressed a sentiment of unity that grows out of the history of Augusta and the presence of nuns living on the same floor: "We're here for a different purpose (than the nuns) but still we share a common goal--to make the best of ourselves.'' 
When describing the living environment at Augusta, many occupants use phrases like "more independence," "keep an eye on each other," and "more relaxed." Verbalizing the keynote of self-governance, Fabian said, "If they (other students) are not being rowdy, it's their own business what they're doing." 
Mary Beth Connor, the R.A. 9f Augusta, expounded on the individual governing of one's actions in the dorm. "If there are any complaints or problems, the girls handle them among themselves." Even Connor's position is testimony to the independence of Augusta residents, for she is not an R.A. in the usual sense of .P.lanning functions for sections, etc. She descnbed her job ''more like a Hall director or a liason between the administration and the students." 
Hall Council President Sue Turcotte explained the different ways that the students' indepen­dence manifests itself: ''Some people think 'self-~overning' means no parietals and guys sleeptng over all the time. But it is not like that at all. The students' purposes for living here are different--they run in trends. Some students are the party type while others are more studious; it just depends on what you want.'' Karol explained this mixture of students by stating, "Augusta attracts the most responsible and the least responsible students.'' 
A semor currently living in Augusta, Rose Adler, experienced the independence and the structure of life in Augusta as very positive and unifying. "The atmosphere is much more relaxed,'' she stated. Adler also spoke ofa unity unknown to other dorms that is created by the fact that all but a few residents are seniors. "It's a lot more fun, more senior activities, you hear about more senior events. You are all going through the same things like trying to find a job, senior comps--you all understand the same things," Adler said. 
Expressing other advantages to Augusta life, Adler listed the larger-sized rooms, much more frequent and thorough maid service, more lounges and study rooms, and less students. 
The requirements to live in Augusta are that 
one must. be a junior or older, attend three 
mandatory meetings each year, and also get a 
good lottery number. However, a low lottery 
number does not always guarantee a room 
because the actual choosing is done first by 
class, then by loqery number. 
Conner described the chances of getting into 
Augusta as competitive. The purpose of the 
three meetings is twofold; first, to explain the 
responsibility required at Augusta and second to 
act as a self-eliminating process(because if one 
meeting is missed the student must choose with 
the last group and if two meetings are missed, 
the student can not qualify to live in Augusta. 
Turcotte echoed many students sentiments 
when she said, "It is a shame more dorms aren't 
like this." But Karol contends that "self-gover­
ning is a hard thing among peers to do.'' 
Self-governing works when students are not 
inhibited to stand up for their rights, but Karol 
adds, "it's hard for students to learn to assert 
themselves because they must live together." 
Thus, implying that students fear ''to rock the 
boat" by complaining. Quick to clarify, Karol 
added "Self governing is often thought by 
students as not rules, but this is not what is 
intended at Augusta; in fact, Augusta must 
follow all the rules as the other dorms.'' 
She did, however, admit to the liklihood of 
male guests staying all night. "We (at other 
dorms) make special exceptions to rules some­
times, I think Augusta does too, but how careful 
they are in making them, I don't know. That is a 
maJor criticism of Augusta life.'' 
The laxity of making exceptions stems from 
the sentiment Karol professes is a general 
occurence among Augusta residents: ''I think 
the biggest problem is the girls feel if something 
doesn't bother anyone, then it is not a 
violation." Karol, however, is pleased with the 
progress that Augusta's lifestyle has made, for 
"every year it is working better and better." 
Yet she also sees the shortcomings and stated, 
"Augusta Hall by no means is a model dorm." 
While believing Augusta is a "real healthy and good growing experience" for students, Karol does not see it feasible to expand Augusta's philosophy to other whole dorms. She professed, ''with larger groups accountabili­ty and anonymity diminish.'' 
Also, with more students the one-to-one basis used in Augusta would be impo·ssible "from a practical viewpoint there would be no one to take phone messages, maintenance req_uests, plan activities, etc. Mary Beth Conner ts swamped with this at Augusta and that's for only 65 students. You've got to have a landlady; our residences are not hotels,'' she concluded. 
Karol also stated that many drawbacks would occur if Augusta's philosophy was expanded on a large scale. She maintains that restricting visitation on floors preserves a sense of privacy community and safety; thus, open visitation would compromise the "homey atmosphere" that Karol believes is wanted by the majority of the students. · 
Karol believes that parietals are such a major issue because of limited space to entertain guests and not because students want an open visitation policy. 
Yet, Karol thinks it would be worthwhile to try to imitate the policy of Augusta Hall on a part basis, for example a section in McCandless or a floor in Regina. When presenting her ideas to students, she is met with positive comments. 
However, Karol feels there is a major lack of student participation on the subject of alterna­tive housing; thus, she is waiting for more student imput before initiating any plans. She explains her hesitation in doing anything further 
interpreting the students' silence as apathy to the idea, and she does not want to force anything on the students, rather hoping that it be the students' choice.

Inone-woman show 
Hawfield creates Dorothy Parker 
by Margie Brassil 
SMC News Editor 

Diane Hawfield captured the wit, cynicism, and social satire of author Dorothy Parker in her one-woman play last night in the Regina auditorium. The play, entitled appropriately e­nough Dorothy Parker, was created by Hawfield using some of Parker's lighter poetry, es­says and monologues. 
"I didn't originally intend to be Dorothy Parker. What I wanted was a string of mono­logues, but it evolved into this," explained Hawfield. Hawfield whittled down Par­ker's seven volumes of poetry and numerous monologues and articles to come up with a sequence of 19 pieces that showed Parker's own progres­sion in life from a young woman to a woman in old age. 
"Parker was a very difficult 
p"erson who seemed to have an 
mability to be content. She was 
constantly restless," Hawfield 
said. Her discontent with the 
society of the 1920's, the period 
in which most of her famous 
work was done, was reflected in the monologues. 
"The Waltz" particularly demonstrated thLs, showing one woman's contempt for the so­cial rituals· of accepting dances because it would be rude to refuse. 
According to Hawfield, Par­ker was a mistress of the monologue, a style which is most conducive to the stage. 
Several of the poems Haw-field used concerned Parker's attempts at suicide. Others contained her stand on femi­nism. "She makes feminist statements of the 1920's that are not really the same as today," said Hawfield. 
"I thought it was funny," explained Hawfield when asked why she chose Parker's works during the question and answer session after the play. "I liked her short stories. Her sass and rythym appealed to me as an actress." 
The idea for the play came when Hawfield, an assistant professor m the Speech and Drama Department, helf>ed a student prepare one of the monologues for a class. She had been preparing the piece 
========================== 
NDfreshmen turn towards ''middle-of-the-road'' 
Notre Dame freshmen are following a national trend to­ward political moderation on the part of incoming college students, according to an American Council on Education survey. 
Between 1972 and last fall, the percentage of Notre Dame freshman identifying them­selves as ''liberal'' fell 11 points from 35 per cent to 24 per cent, while the percentage of those considerin~ themselves ''conservative'' Increased 8 points from 17 per cent to 25 per cent. The "middle-of-the­road'' group remained relative­ly COf?-Stant, going from 45 p~r cent m 1972 to 49 per cent 10 1979. 
In the national freshmen 
group, the only difference over 
the same period was that the 
''middle-of-the-road'' category 
In the national freshmen 
group, the only difference over 
the same period w.as that the 
12-point loss suffered in the 
"liberal" column shifted more 
into the "middle-of-the-road" 
category than into the "conser­
vative" ranks. When compared 
to entering students at other 
highly selective private univer­
sities, Notre Dame freshmen 
are again more moderate in 
political orientation, with 75 per

"conservative," compared to 64 per cent at peer universities. 
Compared to all entering freshmen, Notre Dame first­year students show the same trends toward materialism and career success and away from political involvement, social amelioration, and personal growth, but at less pronounced rates. For example, between 1972 and 1979 the percentage of Notre Dame freshmen endors­ing financial success an an essential or very important objective increased from 45 to 55 per cent, while nationally the increase was from 38 to 63 per cent. 
At the same time the per­centage viewing the develop­ment of a philosophy of life as essential or very important slipped from 78 to 69 per cent among Notre Dame freshmen but from 75 to 57 per cent among all freshmen. 
The major attitudinal differ­ences between Notre Dame freshmen and those of other private, highly selective institu­tions arise on moral issues.

chairmen together to set up a course of action to expedite the platform debates which had bogged down Thursday ni~ht. 
"It was one of those political back-room stories, quite dra­matic. The state chairmen showed an uncommon quality of common sense. To me, it was one of the highlights of the convention," Kresse said. 
"Also, the delegates were fantastic. To have that many stick around until 5:30 in the morning to hear the results and then show up again at 2 p.m. the next day was just great,'' Kresse added. Kresse also noted that ''a nice part about the whole convention was that people had fun, expecially since 1t was not a party, but a political process.'' 
during the past two years and fmally edited it together for Women's Opportunity Week. Hawfield was assisted by her husband, Michael, and Cathy Hurst, a senior at Saint Mary's who directed the play. 
"It was great fun. Working with an imaginative actress who happens to also be my teacher is great experience," commen­ted Hurst after the showing. "This was her personal endea­vor." 
Hawfield said she plans to 
. eventually lengthen the play to two hours using some of Par­ker's more serious pieces. "Most ofher stuff is too long to use in a play. The editing was a matter of pulling out the ones that would hang together. You get so attached to some of the material that you don't want to cut it out,'' she explained about her work on the play. The set was sunply confined to what was needed for each of the pieces. "The Little Hours" required a bed which became the main stage, while "The Waltz" needed a larger open space with a table for a prop. Since the play was only one act, Hawfield showed the au­
thor's aging by adding a fancy dinner jacket or a shawl. Most of the progression was estab­lished through Hawfield's ac­ting, however. 
Dorothy Parker was the se­cond presentation for Women's Opportunity Week, sponsored by Student Government. Poet Gwendolyn Brooks will speak tonight at 8 p.m. in Stapleton Lounge.

Burger closed in third and was 
clocked at 4:18.5. 

The pole vault competition also played a .Prominent part in the Irish sconng as Perry Stow captured first place with a 15-6 vault. Freshman Steve Chronert cleared 14 feet to grab second place. 
The meet came down to two events, the mile relay and the triple jump; the Irish led 60-57. 
For awhile it looked like the Irish victory was sealed as Dziabis and Eady had the Irish in the lead after two legs of the mile relay with Aragon and Christian waiting to run. Aragon had just received the exchanged and was going around a curve when the third Iowa runner Craig Stanowski appeared to bump him. Aragon stumbled and nearly fell; he maintained his balance but not before Stanowski had bolted into a substantial lead. Both Aragon and Christian regained part of the valuable time but they fell two seconds short as Iowa finished in 3:22.40. 
When asked whether or not he thought he had been fouled, Aragon replied, "I thought so, but there was no curve judge so it doesn't matter. He (Stanowski) thought he had room to pass me on the inside. I wasn't about to give up my position; we bumped arms all the way around the curve. Afterwards, he said he was sorry, so he must of thought he pulled something." 
The loss in the mile relay vaulted Iowa into the lead at 62-60, thus setting the sta~e for Kazimi's and McAultffe's heroics. 
The Irish send the two-mile relay team and Steve Dziabis to next weekend's NCAA Indoor Championships in Detroit, before opening the outdoor season on March 29.
