The percentage ofelderlyAmericanswill 
nearly double by 2050, the year the U.S. population is expected to peak at 309 million, the Census ·Bureau estimates. According to the new study, persons over age 65 will make up more than one-fifth ­
21.7 percent-ofthe population in 2050, up from 11.4 percent in 1981. And the declining birthrate means that there will be a smaller share of people in the working years, 18 to 64, to provide for the elderly through tax or voluntary programs. While there were 5. 4 working age Americans for every one over 65 last year, that ratio is expected to dip to 2.6-to-1 in 2050, according to the study by the bureau'sJohn Long and Greg Spencer. "Two things combined, lower fertility rates and improved life expectancy, will make for a marked change in the relationship ofyounger people to older people," said , Long, "There will have to be provisions made LOr any program, public or private pensions, medical facilities, programs that support the: over 65 population." -AP 
When 80-year-old Bill Schluter was a boy, his mother would give him three square meals a day and put him to bed on time. Nowadays, she still does. Schluter's mother, Appy Kroll, is 1o6. About four years ago, when his wife died, Schluter asked his molher to move back in with him, and now they share happy times ,in their north Spokane home. "I give him three meals a day and put him to bed on time. That's the best I can do," said Mrs. Kroll. She also reads to him and sings along when he plays the piano. "She's a lot ofcom­pany -and she·can cook. Sure, I love having her here," Schluter said Monday. Visitors to their place may find the house warm with the sweet smell ofstewing prunes. Schluter is likely to be playing "When You and I were Young, Maggie" on the piano. If his mother coaxes him, Schluter will bring out his guitar.{lnd harmonica to play her favorite, "Beautiful Texas." "That's the way he used to amuse himself while I was getting dinner, especiallyon Sundays," Mrs. Kroll said. ­

A1V repair shop ownerhas been ordered to evict his 10-foot Burmese python, named Snuggles, after police received complaints of missing cats and frightened neighbors. Doug Mead was also told by police to get rid ofGeorge-a 6-foot tree boa-and a 36-inch com snake named Monik. Mead had used the reptilian threesome as watchdogs an attention-getters for his shop, even pos­ting a sign saying the premises were protected by snakes. "I trust them a lot more than I do people," said Mead, 41, of Norton Shores. "People will stab you in the back for a dollar, for a joint (marijuana cigarette). Snakes don't hurt anybody." But Muskegon Heights police Chief Willie Howell, ordering the snake eviction last Friday, said the reptiles had scared Mead's neighbors and caused near-miss accidents because ofgawkers in cars. "It's causing too much distur­bance within the community surrounding the place," said Howell, who cited an ordinance barring the keeping of animals other than 
common pets such as dogs and cats. -AP 
About 400,000 poor,elderly and unemployed families received five pounds of free cheese, but others hoping to get their share of the federal giveaway Monday and Tuesday were left frustrated and empty-handed. In Allen County, where 11,796 blocks of cheese were handed out, at least a thousand poor ami elderly people were turned away without cheese from the government's third cheese giveaway. In Marion County, here 187,000 pounds of cheese was given away, police were called to keep order outside a church when about 200 people in a line learned all the cheese had been distributed. Officials said the crowd became unruly" and began shoving each other, but no one was arrested. "The only problem we've had is that we didn't have enough cheese and we had people that were disappointed that were waiting in lines," said Jean Merritt, executive director of the Indiana Department on Aging and Com­munity Services, which headed the state's distribution effort. "We're planning to do another cheese distribution around Dec. 15. Instead of two million pounds we're going to do four million, plus 800,000 pounds ofbutter," Mrs. Merritt said. Demand exceeding supply was not uncommon. -AP

Easing the grip 
The Observer published a letter last week that Dean of Students James Roemer sent to alcohol distributors in the South Bend area, urging them not to deliver beer to student off-campus residents. Roemer's reasoning in sending such a letter was based on his fears that alcohol abuse has become a pressing problem. 
I could only laugh at the letter at first: How can he expect a beer distributor to turn away business like that, especially when students can easily get their al­cohol elsewhere? Fat chance. After thinking about it for a while, however, I realized that the lettershould not be a surprise to anyone; the letter was consistent with the University's policy toward alcohol use, and a move to control off-campus alcohol use seemed like the next possible step. 
Roemer's concern about alcohol use has always been apparent. He has, on more than one occasion, men­tioned alcohol as the top problem among college stu­dents. I do not deny the seriousness of alcohol abuse, nor do I question the beliefthat alcohol abuse is a rapid­ly growing problem on college campuses. I do believe, however, that all the talk at Notre Dame has only5erved to magnify a situation on campus which does not exist 
in the proportions Roemer  or  others  seem  to be  
expressing. The situation  ~  
can be compared to the mot­ 
her who fears that all the  
'horrible things she: hears in  
the news will happen to her  
children and, consequently,  
imposes all kinds of restric­ 
tions to make sure these 1  
things don't happen to her  
children. All this discussion  
has created a fear of some­ 
thing which is not a big  
problem.  
Roemer is justifiably  
afraid of the destructiveness  
ofalcohol abuse on campus.  
He has taken the steps he  
feels are necessary to insure  
that the problem never  
reaches the proportions it  
has on other campuses. One  

only has to look at the statistics which show the number of people who die in drunk driving accidents each year to realize Roemer's fear. The University should be on the alert to make sure that alcohol abuse never becomes a campus problem. 
I believe, however, that the means being used to achieve the desired goal are out of place, and could be achieving the opposite goaL 
Drinking in any amount has become the center of attention at Notre Dame. With all ·the restrictions governing the use ofalcohol on campus, it has become almost impossible for one to drink socially without feeling uncomfortable. One can certainly not deny that students drink, but is it necessary to view the issue as an evil which only occurs behind closed doors? Why is it that a group of young adults are forced to drink like teenagers, who drink in clandestine places to hide from their parents? Creating an atmosphere where drinking is looked upon as a serious character fault is just as dan­gerous as an atmosphere where there really is a problem. Students who drink infrequer-tly or moderate-Iy should not be made to feel as ifthey have a drinking problem. 

As a result ofall this tension, more and more students who would like to drink in a relaxed place will go to the residences oftheir off-c<!mpus friends. Ifstudents could drink and socialize in a comtoatable atmosphere, maybe fewer students would leave campus. In looking at the number of accidents that have happened to students who have left campus, one would have to agree that it is necessary to provide students with an atmosphere where moderate drinking won't have to be swept under 
aru~  Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students are more intel­ligent and responsible than they're given credit for. 
With all the hand-holding and regulations that govern the way we live, study and socialize, I wonder under what qualifications were we accepted. I'd like to think that our records did a little more than hint at a sense of self-discipline and respon­sibility. Roemer's letter is an insult to off-campus stu­dents, whose responsibility 
has been called into ques­tion. 
I have not suggested a to­tal abandonment of rules; rules have their place, espe­cially in cases where certain people aren't responsiblt: enough to live by them. I would argue, however, that if these rules did not exist, student's lives would change very little. I have repeatedly heard from ad­ministrators how mature and responsible the average student is here. The policies made, however, seem to be 
geared for a different type of student, a student that needs many rules to keep him from doing things that are wrong and damaging to himself. 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students need to be treated more maturely than they are now. More atten­tion needs to be given to how we have proven ou t r­selves, not to how we might fall on our faces ifsomeone doesn't hold our hand.

A basic manifestation of the importance of the athletic department to the student body at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's can be wit­nessed everyday as you open to the back sec­tions of your daily Observer. Our campus newspaper, which is the main source ofdaily information for most of the ND-SMC student body, is usually comprised of approximately 35-40 percent sports stories. Indeed, the sports section (and the comics) seem to be the only segment(s) of the paper that a sizeable majority ofthe studentsactually read.

There are other signs· that reveal the un­usually increased importance that the Notre Dame community places upon sports. There are the forty-five minute waits for court time at the Rock in basketball, or the huge crowds that Coaches Faust and Phelps regularly at­tract to their dormitory appearances. There cannot really be any argument that the most prevalent single discussion topic at Notre 
It isn't finals week. It isn't the bitter South Bend winters. No, it isn't even the abnormal social condition. The most trying experience at Notre Dame (besides attempting to digest ND Foodservice delicacies) is advanced registration.

Campus Quips 

When is registration? Good question. I usually don't know until I overhear someone in the dining hall saying that he got the last checkmark in the only section ofa course I've tried to sign up for in each of the last three semesters. 
By the way, since the Registrar hasn't bot­hered to tell all of us yet, advanced registra­tion starts this week. 
Registration information is a collector's item on many parts ofthe campus. I've always

On and Off 

In .America, the biennial ritual of electoral choice has left the public mind bruised but exhilarated. It was no zero--sum game, with ex­ultant winners and embittered losers, but curiously a trade-off in which both parties felt relieved ifnot satisfied. 
On athletes and athletics 
Dame is the standing of the various sports 
teams. 

Probably the readily explainable cause for 
the ND sports phenonmenon is the fact that 
the a great part of the Notre Dame student 
body have experienced highly athletic back­
grounds. Notre Dame is a university fairly 
unique in the respect that here we have for­
mer All-State or All-City high school athletc:s 
who were simply. not good enough to play 
major collegiate athletics at Notre Dame for 
one reason or another. 

It is extremely frustrating to a former ath­lete to merely "sit and watch" when the old competitive juices start flowing during the middle of a game. I have come to realize this during this past fall. Fortunately for me, I was able to make such a transition more: 
"gracefully" than many of my best friends whom I have observed for several years now at Notre Dame. Many of these former "star" · athletes still sit in front of television sets during Notre Dame football and basketball games, disbelieving that their athletic prowess could be inferior to the gold­
helmeted athletes on the screen. 
The frustration of having a spectator's role 
as their only outlet for their competitive spirit 

Rigors of pre-registration 
found it interesting how all of my friends off­campus will have their marksense forms by Thursday, while we in Lyons wonder if the Registrar has chosen to ignore us. Maybe they figure if we can't pre-register, we won't come back. Or, perhaps, it's because Lyons is in a different zip code than Campus View. (But 
does it matter that the Administration Build­ing is only a five minute walk away?) 
Finding out how to go about signing up for courses and -more importantly -which ones to take, is enough training to make any of us an investigative reporter. Small clues ­such as seeing 10 people lining up outside the finance office with fully completed marksense forms -lead us to believe that, not only is it advanced registration time, but it's the last day. 
Eventually, the first obstacle is surpassed ­we discover that it's time to pull out our num­ber two pencils and register. Step No. 2: Checkmark time. 
At 8 a.m., it's time for all students to line up 
1984: the four fears 
Yet what Ronald Reagan continues to face, 
and what will face whoever is elected in 1984, 
is a set of major fears that go with the territory 
ofAmerican democracy. 
The economic fear is foremost. Americans 
are worried about the long-term question of 
declining productivity and the fading of 
America's competitive position in the world 
economy. But it is an abstract anxiety. It 
doesn't become an immediate fear until it is 
translated into the daily life terms ofhe job the 
job holders, the jobless, the consumers. At 
that point it becomes a political reality. 
Reagan's economists are hoping that the business cycle will swing back by November 1984, cutting the 10 percent unemployment to 7 percent or even to 6 percent. If that doesn't happen, no Republican, whether Reagan or George Bush or jack Kemp, will stand much chance. 
The question is how intractable the busi­ness cycle and the economy are. The Democrats, who have come back t from the like groupies outside the department offices, anticipating the arrival of the department secretary -who probably enjoys registration week as much as students do. The long wait in the queue is intensified by basic registration fears: Will the class be filled up by time I get there? Do I have priority? Those unanswered 
questions make registration time as thrilling as camping overnight for Rolling Stones tick­ets or holding a ticket to the Illinois lottery. 
Unfortunately, by the time we discover if we are the lucky winners or not, the other class we had planned on checkmarking has al­ready been filled. The worst feeling is to wait in line for an hour, only to find out that the time was wasted -"I'm sorry, ma'am, but 486-78-2961 just isn't the right number to get into Finance 360-05." 
Priorities are a secret. Just what makes your 
I.D. number better or worse than anyone else's is a phenomenon that isn't divulged un­til after you've waited in line. (Or better yet, in january.) Maybe if the departmental offices 
dead to a world of new political promise, are working hard on an economic strategy that will grapple with the structural changes ofthe past decades. It means abandoning the naive reliance on subsidies, entitlements and public works, and finding a new mix. 
The Reagan economists will have to modify 
supply-side and austerity economics and find 
a mix of their own. Neither group is likely to 
succeed by 1984, but the penalty for failure by 
the administration will be harsher. 
The Social Security fear will continue until the system is restructured. That is unlikely to have happened by 1984. The best approach will be a bipartisan commission, to exclude party politics. But the political reality is that the Democrats won't give up a heaven-sent issue they can use against Reagan with the 
aging population. 

The crime fear is the most traumatic ofour time. In day-to-day terms it will continue, no matter what happens to the business cycle or to Social Security. 
often leads from constructive criticism concerning a certain athlete's play to an attack on the overall athletic ability of that athlete. Unfortunately, these people do not realize that their tone and/or ferocity oftheir attacks are the reason their friends leave the room in 
the middle of a game. The combination of jealousy and envy, when combined with a frustrated competitive spirit, is not a pretty sight. 
I also keep in mind that these athletes are generally trying their hardest in the face of great pressures and competition, something that people who have not played Varsity ath­letics at Notre Dame cannot possibly, and probably never will understand. 
Notre Dame athletes are generally assumed to be smarter than the athletes of other schools -"our jocks are smarter than your jocks ..." -but they are widely assumed to be less intelligent than the remainder of the student body. Of course, the john Krimms, Kevin Griffiths and John Paxsons of this Uni­versity are exceptions to the rule; yet, in the back of most students' minds, there is an un­said phase which is only uttered in selected company -"yeah, but they're white ..." How would we explain the Rod Bones and the Dave Duersons ofthis campus? 
The love-hate relationship that the students have for the Varsity athletes of Notre Dame is very complex; we love them when they win, we hate them when they take pride in their accomplishments. We hate them when they lose, but we like them when they befriend and associate with us. We hate them through our envy, but love them through our admiration 
Perhaps we could all take a lesson from Father Hesburgh, the University President of the most prestigious football school in the na­tion; a University President who mainly cares about a spotlessly honest athletic program and the respectability of the Notre Dame ath­letic tradition; and a University President who seems a breath offresh air in the N.C.A-A. as he has re-emphasized the student (and person) in the phrasestudent-atblete. 
The remark attributed to the President of the University of Oklahoma -"let's build a University the football team can be proud of' -rings as a sick joke to the disproportionate emphasis we put on sports. Let's n:-evaluate the relationship of the athletes and and stu­dents at Notre Dame; we are all Notre Dame students, and that is what we are all primarily here for. 
set reasonable and objective priority systems 
for different classes, and let us know 
beforehand, checkmarking wouldn't have to 
be like a Reader's Digest Sweepstakes. 
People like me find the registration process very confusing, but feel that when we ask questions about it, we are morons. What I'm beginning to realize is that I'm in the majority. The "figure it out yourself' mentality taken by the administration has the campus going haywire. 
Uncle! Tell me the secret, Mr. Registrar -I give up. I know Domers are supposed to be intelligent, but trying to guess when registra­tion is scheduled or if an I.D_ number has priority does not call for intelligence -only a psychic could succeed in these quests. 
Don't make us wait till January to see ifour "hit and miss" efforts were hits or misses. After all, aren't our classes the major reason we are here? Ifl'd wanted to enter a lottery, I would. However. administration, I and the rest ofthe students here, simply want to register. 
Mario Cuomo parried the issue skillfully in New York, but Tom Bradley was its victim in California. Many Democratic candidates have managed to protect themselves by joining in a law-and-order stance. But the spectre ofcrime on the streets and in the home will haunt a liberal Democrat like Kennedy or Mondale and help Reagan. 
The nuclear fear will grow unless Reagan strikes an agreement with the Russians by 1984 to start arms reduction. That too is unlikely, although it is possible in a second term if Reagan gets it. The nuclear freeze movement is more diagnostic than practical. A freeze would limit the development of American defensive weapons which are now in the planning, and which would add to deterrence. 
Yet in our time, before the end of the '80s, someone sitting in the nuclear presidency will have to make a start on dismantling the nuclear arsenal in both camps and thus also start on dismantling the nuclear fear.

illyJoel has always displayed a talent for making upbeat, infec­tious songs like "Only the Good Die Young" as well as catchy, ex­pressive tunes like "Honesty" or "just the Way You Are." While this .knack has garnered him an extensive string ofhits, it still has'nt enabled him to receive wide critical acclaim because many critics felt that he was simplywasting his ability through selfdramatization, a repetitious and immature lyrical stance, and a tendency for over­cautiousness. However, on his new release entitled The Nylon Cur­tain, Joel's talent comes into full focus to produce one of the major surprises of the music year.

PACE SETTER Placekicker 
Mike Johnston needs only two more 
field goals to tie Harry Oliver's 
record of 18 successful field goals in 
a season. He has now made 16-of-17 
for 94 percent efficiency. The 
record for a season is 80 percent and 
for a career, only 72 percent. 
Johnston is fifth in the nation in field 
goals, and 23rd in scoring. Not bad 
for a former walk-on in his first year 
ofintercollegiate placekicking. 
Speaking of pace-settees, Penn 
State Coach Joe Paterno has 
compiled a 17-year mark of 159-34­
1 for an .822 winning percentage ­
tops among active coaches with 
over 10 years' experience.

Players choose sides on NFL owners'offer 
NEW YORK (AP) -The Dallas Cowboys and Los Angeles Rams, and players on other teams, joined the New Orleans Saints Tuesday in giving conditional support to the National Football League club owners' latest contract offer, den­ting the union's publicly proclaimed solid front. 
Many players, however, also reaf­firmed their opposition to the five­year, $1.31 billion offer by the Management Council, and union leader Ed Garvey insisted that no team has formally voted to accept the proposal. 
Not unexpectedly, the NFL also called off next weekend's games. Half of the 16-week regular season -112 games -now has been af­fected by the strike, leaving no more than 10 games ifthe season resumes Nov. 21 and two weekends are made up. 
Garvey said the next 48 hours are crucial. "Even if you accept our timetable for moving the schedule ... you do start to run out of time," he said. 
Also Tuesday, the Management Council filed an unfair labor practice complaint, charging that New Or­leans player representative Russell Erxleben had been threatened by union officials for his dissenting views. 
Garvey said Monday night that 25 
teams had "more or less" rejected

Sugar Ray Leonard calls it acareer 
BALTIMORE (AP) -World wei· terweight champion Sugar Ray Leonard, who admitted he vacillated until the last minute, announced his retirement from boxing Tuesday night. 

-
"The final decision was made tonight, right here in the ring," Leonard said after making the an­nouncement to a crowd of more 
than 9,000 in the Baltimore Civic Center, where he launched his pro career in 1977. 
In answer t to a question shouted from ringside, Leonard explained his indecision during the six months since an operation to correct a detached retina. 
"Every day "it was a different answer," he said. "I didn't want to mislead the public." 
Leonard said he had thought about returning to competition for a time, but added, "then I forgot about 
it." 
Answering another question from the audience, Leonard said: "the feeling is gone. I will not come back. That's it." 
During his formal announcement, during which he thanked his family and all those connected with his career both in and out of the ring, Leonard looked toward mid­dleweight champion Marvin Hagler, a possible opponent who it was thought would produce a purse of SI5 million or more for Leonard. 
"The fight with that great man would be one of the greatest in the history of boxing," Leonard said. "It would be Fort Knox, and he's the on­ly man who could make it happen. Unfortunately, it will never happen." 
Hagler, one of the invited guests who spoke to Leonard as he sat in the ring listening to accolades, also made reference to a possible bout with the welterweight champion. 
"Leonard and Hearns (Thomas Hearns, whom Leonard defeated to become undisputed welterweight champion) was the showdown, but we've got to be the fight of the cen­tury," Hagler said. 
Prior to that, however, Hagler said, "I'u like to see Leonard go out with style, the way that he is." 
Public speakers included former heavyweight champions Muham­mad Ali and Ken Norton, former light heavyweight champions Mat­thew Saad Muhammad and Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, Leonard's manager Angelo Dundee. enter­tainer Wayne Newton and Dr. 

NEW YORK (AP)-Robin Yount of 
the Milwaukee Brewers, who 
capped his finest season by setting 
one World Series record and equall­
ing another, was named Most 
Valuable Player of the American 
League by a large margin on Tues­
day. 

Yount, a 27-year-old shortstop, received 385 points in balloting by a special panel of 28 members of the Baseball Writers Association of America, two from each AL city. Eddie Murray of the Baltimore Orioles was second in balloting with 228 points. 
Yount received all but one first­place vote. The other went to Reggie jackson of the California Angels, who finished sixth in balloting with 
I07 points. Third in the vote was Doug DeCinces of the Angels with I 78 points, followed by Hal McRae of Kansas City with I 75, Cecil Cooper ofthe Brewers with I 52 and 
Jackson. 

In all, 33 players received men­tion on the ballot on which panel members were asked to vote for I 0 players. Each first-place vote was worth I4 points, second place was wonh nine points and on down the line to one point for 10th place. 
Before this year, Yount's best season had been I980 when he set career marks with a .2':13 average, 2.3 homers and 87 RBI. But he eclipsed even that season in I982 with a bat­ting avt:rage of .3.31, one point be­hind league leader Willie Wilson of Kansas City, who ~at out the final game of the season to preserve his ..3j2 average. 
He also drove in II runs, hit 29 homers, stole 14 bases and com­mitted only 24 errors, while improv­ing his range at shortstop. 
Yount, whose bat cooled off during the American League playoff against California, was outstanding as the Brewers met St. Louis in the World Series. He hit .414 with one homer and shared the team lead in RBI with Cooper by driving in six runs. 
Although the Brewers lost the Series in seven games, Yount kept alive his chase for glory. He set a record with four hits in each of two games and tied teammate Paul Molitor for another record with six at-bats in one game. 
Asked on the eve of Game One of the World Series if he felt he deserved MVP honors, Yount dis­avowed personal goals. 
"The Milwaukee Brewers are the most valuable team," he said. "We have a great team. The year I had could not have come about if it wasn't for this club." 
Yount played only one season in the minor leagues, in 1973, then joined the Brewers the following year. He played in 107 games his first season and has been the Brewers' regular shortstop ever since. 
This year, Yount became the first shortstop to lead the American League in both total bases ( .367) and slugging percentage (. 578 ). He led the league with 210 hits and tied McRae for the AI. lead in doubles with 46. He was second to Molitor in runs with 129 and third in triples with IZ. 


ringside seats, with the gneral public charged S! and $2 for seats in the Civic Center. Proceeds benefitted Baltimore's summer jobs program for youth. 
He had played the event to the hilt the way one of the invited guests, Ali, used to do during his equally or­chestrated career. 
In August, Leonard said he could, indeed, walk away from a sport that has earned him some $35 million in purses and millions more from other sources. 
But just last week, while serving as

Ronald Michels, the opthamologist who operated on Leonard. 
Michels told the crowd that the operation was a success but added that he hoped Leonard would retire. 
Before the ceremony, Leonard's wife, Juanita, said, "I just told him if he didn't quit I'd break all his fin­gers." 
Leonard had not fought since Feb. 15, and his well-publicized decision came six months to the day since the 26-year-old welterweight champion underwent surgery to correct a detached retina in his left eye.
