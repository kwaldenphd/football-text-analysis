To the Editor. 
I have never met Jay Schwartz 
and therefore what I have to say 
does not proceed from any per­
sonal friction between us. I have 
more or less "followed" Mr. 
Schwartz's column in the Obser­ver and have thus winced period­ically over(what seems to me to be) his antipathy to just about everything imaginable. 
Mr. Schwartz seems a very bitter man. This is in itself, how­ever, no cause for outrage: Bob Dylan too has been described as an "angry young man," yet I am not at all embarrassed by Dylan's bitterness. The difference between Bob Dylan and Jay Schwartz (aside from the fact that Dylan is a poet and Schwartz very plainly is not) is that Dylan's an­ger has a point to it, a vision if you will. 
On the other hand, when I read Mr. Schwartz's recent (Feb. 
5) tongue-in~heek (hoof-in­mouth) diatribe against everyone from Tom Figel (whom also I do not know but whose articles have repeatedly hit home some­thing beyond mere invective) to Adam Smith, and everything from the bathrooms in the Senior Bar

to the Senior Bar (apparently the focus of his scorn), I could see nothing but a dirty wind. Per­haps Jay was making a funny. 
O.K. No objection, except that it was not funny, and it wasted space. 
But what is the substance be­hind his bitterness toward the camp.JS demonstration against Dow Chemical? He says (Feb. 12) we "the diehard contingent sang, sat and loved" (as if we were all hip­pies) in smug defiance of the "maintainers of the holy war orthodoxy," and detects in this a "distinct smell of intellectual paralysis." 
He accuses the demonstrators (all 100 of us!) of confusing the political basis of the Vietnam war for an economic one, imply­ing in this that the moral insen­sibility of most corporations, of which Dow is the current symbol, in no way contributes to the perpetuation of this war. Because napalm "just ... happens to kill innocent people just as other weapons destroy innocent peo­ple." Mr. Schwartz says our de­n.unciation of Dow is not "legiti­mate," the grand implication be­ing that we are "asking for a re­turn to a gentlemen's war," that is, that our moral indignation is not real, just self-righteous. 
The Mail 
Finally in one sweeping gen­eralization, he brands us a "rag­tag band of Trotskyites (Peter Michelson?) and religious pro­fligates" (Fr. David Burrell?), and dismisses our sincerity by sug­gesting that we might be more effective through the Mock Con­vention, as if none of us was in­tending to participate in it. 
I fail to see the method in Mr. Schwartz's bitter madness. And I fail to see why he should be allowed to waste an entire col­umn of the Observer just to vent his empty vituperations.

Bullet Waits And Turns 

By TIM O'MELIA 
If the charges which Mark Lane, author of Rush to Judf!· ment, levels at two Federal agen­cies are merely half true the government of the United States is in danger of being controlled by the Central Intelligence Agen­cy. Monday evening before a standing room only audience at Washington Hall, Lane accused that "President Kennedy rode into a trap that the FBI knew 
of'  and  that  the  assassination  
was  a  "plan  conceived  of by  
the CIA."  
Lane  said  that  Lee  Harvey  

Oswald, the presumed assassin of Kennedy, was a paid informer of the FBI and that Oswald cab­led a warning of the assassination attempt to Bureau headquarters five days prior to the murder. Lane said also that Kennedy was never informed of Oswald's re­port by the FBI. 
Lane ridiculed the Warren Re­port to the delight of the packed house while presenting evidence proving that sltots were fired at Kennedy from more than one direction, thus proving a conspiracy. 
Lane said that doctors at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dal1as reported that Kennedy was shot in the right temple and throat as welJ as the back. Ac­cording to the famous Zapruder ftlm Governor Connally was hit 
1.8 seconds after Kennedy. The Report claims that Kennedy and Connally were shot by the same bullet. Lane said this could have happened only if the bullet wait­
ed 1.8 seconds after hittingKen­nedy and made two sharp turns while hitting Conna11y. 
Asked why the CIA conspired to murder Kennedy, Lane said that he could only speculate but that he believed that they were dissatisfied with the Vtetnam policy. Kennedy had removed 2,000 of the 17,500 troops sta­tioned. 
Lane also said he has "wit­nessed movement from capital­ism. . . slowly, perhaps imper­ceptibly, but nevertheless toward 
totalitarianism." A standing ova­tion followed his talk.

EDITOR  IN  CHIEF PATRICK COLLINS FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3, 1966 NOTRE DAME, INDIANA 
Maine, Pueblo, Stupidity 
Remember the Alamo. Remember the Maine. Those simple words served to unite patriotic sentiment and give this nation cause for war. But who will remember the U-2, remember the Liberty, or remember the Pueblo? All of these were attacked by enemy forces, but they did not become rallying cries, nor did the military or the press attempt to use them to whip up 
jingoistic sentiment. Rather the Pentagon was embarassed because the plain fact was that all of these were spies, probing elec­tronic defenses and monitoring secret communications. In war time spies are shot. 
The United States has shown, through its interference in Guatamala, the Dom­inican Republic, Iran, and Bolivia, that it will defend the far provinces of its empire against all attempts at independence. The Cuban invasion, our aggression in Vietnam and our general buildup in Southeast Asia indicates to the world that we seek to expand our empire wherever possible. The long list of CIA inspired coups and palace revolutions proves that no one, not even an ally, is safe from our colonial policy. 
This fear and nevrousness is contin­ually being aggravated by the spy ships and spy planes that are always probing, monitoring, teasing, testing defensive reac­tions. It is all a game, but played in deadly earnest, and we should not be 
surprised when a nation's defenses react 
successfully according to plan and our spy 
is caught in its own trap. The chances of 
such a reaction are greatly increased when 
a nation fears for its safety and sees 
these spies as a direct threat to its security. 
The Pueblo was captured four miles outside the 12 mile limit of North Korea, but according to official sources, the exact locations of the ship cannot be ascertained positively for the eleven days that it main­tained radio silence. It could have easily strayed back and forth across the line or come close enough to really alarm the North Koreans. At the time of the cap­ture, there were five U. S. warplanes in South Korea. Four were on standby and 
armed with tactical nuclear weapons, the other was undergoing repairs. North Korea does not have the bomb and is under­standibly nervous about any weakening of its defenses. 
The list of remembers will continue in the future if the defense establishment does not pull back its spies. The massive role of the U.S. in Vietnam dates from the Gulf of Tonkin, an incident of a similar nature. With international tensions so heightened by the continuing escala­tion of the war, the administration must decide whether the small amount of infor­mation gained by these missions is worth the world war that another such incident may well touch off. 
On The Razor's Edge 
It is somewhat odd that in the midst of a Student Body President campaign wrap­ping itself around the issue of student po­wer and responsibility, that none of the candidates have addressed themselves to the issue of a strong student-financed press. Central to the expression and defense of student opinion and rights on any cam­pus should be a vigorous and independent student newspaper. 
With the birth of the Observer last year, Notre Dame got its first taste of a reform­
ing student newspaper. Publication increa­sed from a steady two per week last seme­ster to three per week at the present time. Layout has been continuously improved, both features and columnists expanded, and a cartoonist was added. The recent George Kennan Patriot of the Year story is only one example of the paper's ability to get both news and to defend the student body's right to knowledge about their Uni­
versity. 
But more importantly, we feel that the Observer has been on the leading edge of what's happening at Notre Dame. Editor­ially, we have strived to vigorously defend the rights of our student body in all areas of student life. In one sense, the Observer , has been the one consistent unifying force in the student body. 
But the Observer is still weak compared to other University newspapers, and the main reason for this is lack of money for publication. With a reasonable boost in fi­nancial support, the Observer could become a daily, increase its present campus news and features, and add on national and in­ternational news and columnists through wire service subscription. With the money, this could be done next week. 
Thus we regret that none of the candi­dates have recognized the potential power and influence of a stronger Observer in supporting their all-encompassing plat­
forms once in office. In any case, the stu­dents of Notre Dame have a right to a bet­ter student newspaper than we can publish at this time. We find it frustrating that in the midst of numerous Student Govern­ment expenditure extravaganzas, that the independent student newspaper-the fo­cusing agent of campus life-should be hampered in its size, quality and service to the student body by inappropriate finan­cial restrictions.

~'AT LEAST MINE HPP A~ AWNING." 

Dennis Gallagher 
Patriotic Gore 
"Patriotism," Dr. Johnson said, "Is the last refuge of the scoun­
drel." Without going into the matter of how this applies to our cur­
rent leaders, the statement certainly does catch at the diffuse uses 
of the patriot game. Not only does it serve Sen. Dodd to wave the 
flag as a tactic of diverting attention from his substantial misdeeds, 
but also patriotism serves as a final hiding place for the befuddled. 
Whatever your position on the war, so long as you keep think­
;ing about it and seriously discussing it, you can never be quite 
free from self-doubt. There is so much information from so many 
questionable sources to be digested. And the whole thing rests 
so nicely on individual evaluations that any minor religious experi­
ence or bit of striking information always threatens to turn you 
right around and make you decide the viewpoint you've been 
arguing for two years is absolutely false. 
But patriotism frees you from all this. Despite the fact that something like a majority of American youth wants rather desper­ately to avoid the military, the draft, for the patriot, becomes "a fact of life." The war in Vietnam, opposed by nearly a third of our citizens, becomes a "necessary part of national policy." 
And I am not speaking precisely of those who are politically conservative or militantly anti-communist. Rather, it seems some­how at the core of many otherwise rationally and pragmatically motivated individuals that America somehow cannot be basically wrong about anything. 
Patriotism is a kind of religious faith which involves a righteous 
indignation at opponents. The dogma is simple. We've never lost a 
war (officially), so we'll win this one as long as we keep the faith. 
Somehow, we cannot afford to lose, now or ever, or th_e myth 
will be broken. People who wouldn't think of letting religion affect 
their moral life still implicitly believe that our Christian culture will 
receive some kind of divine aid in the war against the godless. 
These people who believe in the manifest destiny of the United States are not the Birchers from Kansas. They are you, all of you will pretend a sort of disagreement and then fall into line. You think in terms of kill ratios, strategic points and national interests. You forget the cracking bones, the festering flesh, the piles of dead and dying. The rhetoric of patriotism makes it easy to forget the terrible weapons that snuff the spark of life out of a man be­fore he can even utter a cry of pain. 
Do you believe that middle class life is civilized and rational? I have loved this green land and the promise of the morning. Do you believe we have a duty to stop the spread of communism, whatever the cost? I have seen this land as a sleeping giant that could do much in goodness of soul and greatness of strength. Do you feel President Johnson is a fine man who has done his best in a difficult time? I do not love this war, nor the arithmetic that makes tv.enty Vietnamese peasants (perhaps Viet Cong sym­pathizers) worth less than one American soldier. 
In other less evil days I might have gone to war singing "God Bless America", myself a flag waver. Now, I must bestow my amor patriae on an idea of a nation that isn't quite and perhaps never will be realized. Am I then a traitor to this living land, in this time? The servant to Cornwall: "I have served you ever since I was a child; but better service have I never done you than now to bid you hold."

met Peter underneath a Council of It's somewhat disturbing to see all of Wholesale Distributors "Cooperation E-these campaign posters stapled to bulletin quais Progress" seal at a Washington, D.C. boards so early. Why it seems like just hotel. Invited by the exceutive directors yesterday that Chris Murphy was putting of the United States Student Press Assoc-row boats on our lakes, barbecuing behind iation (USSPA) editors conference, Peter, the dorms and employing an ombudsman his wife Polly Ester, and a handful of for our troubles. 
other Drop City, Colorado, denizens were 
doing their thing in the hotel's darkened Assembly 
Room. A light show flash­ing onto black and white fleur-de-lis-splashed walls, burning incense, and Jul­ian Bream's lute music, "from the royal courts of Europe" provided the pro­per mind-expanding atmos­phere. 

down on the floor to watch the walls and contemplate. Of course, some people walked in, took a quick look around and left more quickly than they'd come, mut­tering about those "dirty commies." Lots of kitchen wholesale people did that. 
(It was under their seal that the Drop City 
people had set up shop ...). 
I'd been hearing about the Drop City­ites all morning, so late in the afternoon I decided that the U.S.S.P.A. conference wouldn't be complete without meeting them. So I sat down on the Assembly Room floor to observe the scene. The group nearest me was involved in an ani­mated discussion of freedom; two bearded young men with shoulder length hair caught by forehead bands and wearing hodge-podge clothing led the conversat­ion. Peter Ral:bit, one of the discussion 
leaders, finally detached himself from the group and knelt down beside me. 
"Are you alright," he asked. After telling him that I was, I inquired if he was. Having positively assured me, Peter launched into a discussion of happiness (it doesn't depend upon material things... the Drop City people are happy with the discarded products from near by Trinidad, Colo. stores... happiness depends upon relationships with other people). 
Suddenly Peter looked at me intently and inquired whether I ever spent much time contemplating my naked self. I asked for a definition of terms and he came through with the idea of self stripped of all the protective shells that people throw up before other people, the shells that are the product of fear. If people can only calmly discard their shells and be aware of their naked selves -and the naked selves of others -there will be hope for the world. 
At this point, Danu, another Drop­
City-ite, joined us and offered me some 
incense. So we sat and talked some more 
about Drop City where anyone can do his 
thing or not do it. Some of its denizens 
make money with their poetry or art or 
music. But according to Danu, what they 
really need is some equipment to produce 
light shows. He says that they need a gig. 
I told him about the Delphic Oracle and 
suggested that he try them. Danu saunter­
ed off. 
But then there was Peter. Peter seemed 
sincere. The idea of stripping the self so 
that people can communicate, so that ev­
eryone can see each other as they really 
are, is his answer to the call for world 
peace. 
A former advertising copy writer, he 
thinks that he can best do this at Drop 
City, which he sees as an emanation point 
for the calm awareness that will bring 
about universal peace. 
Maybe he's right, maybe not. But I sort 
of hope that Danu can get a gig that will 
help Peter get enough lettuce to survive 
with his dream. 
Yes, it may not be easy to forget good ole president Chris Murphy, but it may be made easier in light of the present cam­paign. 
Actually there are few things that can be said that have not already been said about the four candidates for the Student 
Body throne. But we're going to try to say them as politely as we can. Because this is an elec­tion year and things sh­ould be said. . . Abe Lincoln said that. 
Dave Graham the yo­ung candidate from Lyons Hall as his posters so 


forcefully proclaim, is a campus con­servative in the tradition of one of our old favorites Ken Beirne. B.lt Graham is not as shrewd or as crafty as his ego. In fact he might easily be categorized as stupid when trying to mesh the student government into student union. Imagine the Student Body president MCing a Smokey Robinson and the Miracles Show 
at the Stephan Center. 
Then we have conserv oops liber-ahh Pat Dowd who is running on a conserable or a liberconserv. Well,you see it is hard to describe what Pat is really doing these rl:Jys cause when his political record looks 
like a checker board. But we're being kind here so we11 just say that he has a local political identity crisis complicated 
by a conservative by-faced approach to student problems. If you can understand that you can understand Pat. 
Now we turn to Chuck Perrin, who we like, but who we think lacks the exper­ience in dealings with the administration­the experience which we think is necessary for important political policies. He is idealistic, but idealism seldom is operable in the area of Notre Dame Student Government. 
Rich Rossie, the final candidate, is the most attractive in the sense that he knows what should be implemented here at Notre Dame and that he has a desire to get good things done. Like Perrin, Rossie too is idealistic, but his idealism is tempered by the knowledge of past and present attitudes of the adminis­tration. This is tremendously important in getting things done. 
But before we nose dive into the campaign, we would like to express our thanks to lame duck-to-be Chris Murphy and hope that the SUMMA trips have helped him overcome his acrophobia. 
----Tom Brislin--­
From The Back Of The Room 
While plodding through winter won­derland toward Keenan Hall in order to catch both Rossie's and Dowd's acts on the first night of the campaign, I suddenly had the queer realization that it wasn't really my election at all. All we shrewd seniors would be getting our asses out of the midwest in a few months. And Notre Dame would be remembered as Frank 
O'Malley, and not as stu­dent government or the Observer or all the other diversion. And that's the way it should be. 
But still you know that it's your University and al­ways will be, and that it's changed radically in recent years and is on the verge 


of achieving a great uniqueness. But most of the alumni don't seem to understand it. 
Glance at the recent Alumnus-tirades about "overeducation", "communism", etc. destroying the "real Notre Dame". Unfortunately, the student body doesn't seem to understand it either. At least it has been lacking in spirit and unification, constrained to action on the fringe of the University's development. The potential of its power has been wasted and Notre Dame has been the less for it. Student leaders, myself included, have always begged down their campaigns and actions over concern with disconnected peripheral reforms which everyone has always want­ed: better social life, reform the corrupt student government, more emphasis on the hall community, and similar political 
truisms that get votes when given with a smooth factual delivery. 
Rossie ambled down the hall with that gaudy blue and gold scarf (what a Notre Dame man!), covered with snow and near-frozen. A large group of freshmen formed in the lobby, and he began to speak. He didn't crack jokes. He didn't tell them that they should be meeting more girls. He didn't tell them that students 
~t places lived in near-penthouses in absolute freedom. He didn't tell them that every previous Notre Dame man that gave twenty or thirty hours a week to serving his fellows was a prideful, power­hungry bastard. He didn't really tell people, particular­ly freshmen, what they want to hear­and usually do-from a Student Body President candidate. Richard Rossie told them his vision of where Notre Dame was going, and what we as students could do together to make Notre Dame a great University. He told them how students could utilize their power to make this a better place to live and learn. I think that Richard Rossie feels that Notre Dame students are more intelligent than they have been treated, and that 
they have a capacity to contribute to the transformation of this University. With agonizingly slow words he struggled to tell Notre Dame men that they have been cheating themselves and their University. And all of a sudden you began to realize that the fat kid with the Southern accent was giving us an overview of ourselves and our University that we sorely needed. 
And you could sense in his words and his face and his motions that not only did Richard Rossie know what he was talking about, but that he possessed that rare compassion for his fellows desperately needed in refining the intelligence of a leader to solving the myriad of problems he will face. I would like to see that kind of man as representative of the student body at my University, even though my own years here are gone. 
About an hour later, I passed through the same area and caught the words of Pat Dowd: "Do you know that fifty-five percent of St. Mary's girls don't go out on weekends?" The eyes of the voters eagerly 
followed  him  around  the  room  and he  
met  them  with  both  g- smile  and  an  
answer.  

-Tom McKenna­So The Baby Could Walk 
For the past three and one half years the Student Government of the Univer­sity of Notre Dame has been an exercise in trivia. The main objective was securing an administrative capitulation (cars, cur­fews, private love-making) and providing 
the students \\lith bigger and better junior class parties. 
Campaigns were even better. Some of the greatest promises of this decade ussued forth from the aspiring politicos. The Rolling Stones were debated by Jim Fish 
and Rick Dunn. John Phil­
lips and the Blue Circle 
didn't want Minch Lewis~~~ to establish too many com­
mittees. And Minch wanted 
nearly everyone to have 
a position in "our student 
government. 
The campaign of 1967, 
proved to be something 
new. The emphasis shifted 
from social panaceas to students' rights. 
A political party played an influential 
role in the election but a political ma­
chine won. The A.S.P. lost, but her ideas 
triumphed. Along with boats in the lake, 
barbecues, mysterious islands, and thea­
tres in the round, the new SBP promised 
to push student power to the forefront. 
Chris Murphy was a slick politician. The 
question was whether or not he was a 
courageous one. 
Murphy promised a lot. His pamphlet 
gave the students fifty-four reasons to 
vote for Chris. He looked good, spoke 
well and acted like a winner. He was. But 
after the tabulation, skeptics abounded. 
He won't produce. He'll sell us out to the 
administration. He is only out for his own 
benefit. He'll concern himself with peri­
pheral issues. For a semester it looked as 
if the skeptics were right. 
Our president was flying about the 
country. The students' leader was stump­
ing for Summa -Notre Dame's greatest 
challenge. His accomplishments were non­
essentials-continental breakfast (with an. 
added fee), off campus apartments (twenty­
one year olds could now govern their 
lives), coat and tie rule (the senate 
helped but Riehle was the prime mover), 
organizational cars (returned to the num­
ber of the previous year) and course­
teacher evaluation (an impersonal compu­
terized evaluation of a, b, c, d, or none of 
the above.) Granted it was a first step, 
but it may keep the baby from ever 
walking again. 
There were some encouraging rumb­
lings -McCauley's stay hall. Anderson's 
judicial council, Wycliffs minority en­
rollment -but the outlook was as grey 
and overcast as any South Bend winter. 
Up until Wednesday, Feb. 7, Chris 
Murphy was a Student Body President 
of the old humdrum school. He had done 
well with the trivia and had played the 
childish "I -want -what -you -have" 
game with the administration. But with 
the declaration, "The student assembly 
is now in session," Murphy separated 
himself from the officers of the past. He 
and his fellow students took a giant step 
toward making themselves an active part 
of the university communitv. 
The next six weeks will be the most 
crucial of Murphy's administration. He 
has a program and a mandate. The stu­
dents are behind their president. Together 
they must carry their bills of assembly 
into actions of community. Everything 
is on the line. 
The assembly is just the starting point. 
Some call it the kickoff. It is now up to 
Chris Murphy and our student body to 
carry it in for the score. That, not 
Summa, is Notre Dame's greatest chal­
leng.

"Some of the engineers who graduated belore me complained that their education didn't mean much in their jobs. That's not what I wanted," says IBM's Jim Carr. (Jim is a Manager of Mechanical Process 
Engineering.) "At IBM I knew I'd be using what I learned. There's su much diversity here that you can usually work in the specilic area you choose. In my own case, I majored in Mechanical Engineering and minored in Metallurgy. Today my ME degree means more than ever. And I often use my metallurgical background. For example, I'm now working on a process development program that requires a knowledge of machine design, metallurgy, heat transfer, and chemistry, all of which I studied in school. "Another good thing about IBM's diversity is that it creates an interdisciplinary environment. You get a chance to work with and learn from people in many different fields. Since our industry is growing so fast, the people you talk to are likely to be working at state-of-the-art levels or beyond." There's a lot more to the IBM story than Jim has mentioned.

THE IRISH EYE 
Surely You Chess 
.................................... EYTOMCONDON 
REVENGE 
My experience with the products of Catholic women's colleges has been at times scintillating and fruitful and at other times lamentable and futile. But never was I more certain of incipient total victory than the night I suggested, despite 'The Wasteland,' a game of chess. 
Now, with a build-up like that, it must be obvious to the discerning reader that the evening ended in total disaster. It did. But before I describe the gore, I ought to 
 digress for a moment about chess. 
Chess is, in the immortal words of somebody, 'The Game.' It is the only game (as opposed to sport) in which one need not caress the capriciousness of Luck's personified femininity. One begins with the same number of pieces having the same potential and covering the same area as one's opponent. Success or failure depends entirely on the employment of ingenuity and wit, at least to a higher de­gree than the opposition. 
The origin of the game has fallen from history's tumbril. Its invention has been 
 variously ascribed to the Greeks, Romans, Babylonians, Medes, Jews and Persians. But, since one man's Mede is another man's Persian, we can only assume, be­cause the word chess comes from the Per­sian 'shah' for king, that the game began 
somewhere in the Middle East. 
Chess worked its way westward, and is incorporated into many of the legends of the early Christian period. It is said, for example, that the son of Prince Okar was killed by a blow on the temple struck by the son of Pippin after a chess game. Also, legend has it, the Emperor Charlemagne was presented a magnificent chess set by the Empress Irene, and then proceeded to lose his kingdom over the board to the always .crafty Guerin de Montglave. That may be a bit apocryphal, but it does point to the need for checks and balances. At any rate, chess arrived in England, the Per­sian phrase 'shah mat,' meaning the king is dead, was anglicised to 'checkmate,' and ches, became a universal. 
Chess is an opportunity for action within well-defined limits, perhaps a squar­ing of the Elizabethan 'circle.' In that con­text, perhaps it is not totally relevant to today's world; a game to be taken serious­ly by idealistic young men and dreaming old ones. It is however, only a game, and one that is at once enjoyable and thought­provoking. And there exists the element of hope provided by the order in chess. 
Enougl1, and back to my own contest. 
I had every right to expect victory; I once 
lost to Bobby Fischer in 17 moves (I 
might point out that he was playing 49 
other people at the same time and I was 
using an all-out defense). 
We commenced the match, I with the sinister black pieces and she with the pris­tine whites. I opened with a clever king's pawn gambit. She failed to counter it. In fact, her basic ploy was to distract me with subtleties like "Can the king only move one space at a time?'' and "whose turn is it?" To shorten the story, I won brilliantly, without losing a piece. It was still early, so I discreetly suggested a walk near a local pond. But no, she thougllt she'd better go to bed, because she had to get up early, to think about buying a summer dress. Would she care to 
go out the next night? No, she had to spend the evening thinking about last year's physics project. 
I, however, still recommend chess. Chess sets can be had almost anywhere; I recently added to the market by selling mine to a local 'pawn' shop. 
ND Hockey 
Along with their lift to varsity status next year, Notre Dame hockey players will get a new head coach, Charles (Lefty) Smith. Smith is presently coach at South St. Paul High School in St. Paul, Minn. He will also serve as manager of the ice skating facilities in the new Convocation Center. 
Smith, a 1951 graduate of St. Thomas (Minn.) College, has served as hockey coach at South for ten years, where his teams are 197-68-11.
