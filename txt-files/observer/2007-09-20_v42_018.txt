Endowment jumps $1.4 billion 
Dramatic growth continues; in one year, total increases from $5.08 to $6.54 billion 
By KAREN LANGLEY 
News Editor 
The Notre Dame endow­ment pool has grown by more than $1.4 billion during the last fiscal year. making it like­ly the University will continue to rank in the top two or three American universities in investment performance, Chief Investment Officer Scott Malpass said Wednesday. 
The endowment grew at an annual rate of 25.9 percent during the 2007 fiscal year ­among the top rates of return of all university endowments, Malpass said. 
This rate of return is markedly higher than the 
17.7 percent returns experi­enced by the TUCS Large Fund Median, a compilation of other endowment founda­tions and pension funds of more than $1 billion, Malpass said. 
The University endowment pool was $6.54 billion when the 2007 fiscal year endfld on June 30. A year earlier, the endowment pool was $5.08 billion. 
Investment strategies at Notre Dame differ from those at some peer institutions in that University investments must follow the guidelines of Catholic social teaching, Malpass said.

186 companies attend career fair 
Students meet with representatives; organizers say 600-800 interviews scheduled today 
By KRISTEN EDELEN 
News Writer 
Students brought resumes for representativp,s of 186 companies at Notre Dame's fall career fair Wednesday in the Joyce Athletics and Convocation Center (JACC}. 
Though students say the fair appnars geared toward business majors, Lee Svete, director of the Career Center and an organizer of the fair. said all students could berwfit from the vari­ety of companies represent­ed. 
"There is actually quite a bit of the marketing area 
represented here tonight, which is a career suitable for any major," Svete said. "General Mills, Target [and] even Abercrombie and Fitch from the corporate levels are here. These are the peo­ple responsible for branding and such. These are cre­ative opportunities." 
Until 2001, Svete said, the fair was "only associated with the Mendoza College of Business. It was even held in the Mendoza building. Moving it to the JACC has opened up the scene for underclassmen as well as a variety of other majors." 
Still, Svete said, many of the companies present 
offered opportunities geared toward finance and account­ing majors. 
There were also opportu­nities for engineering majors to contact companies including Nestle Waters and Chevron. 
Though Svete is proud of the fall fair, he said, the second career fair, held in January, will be "less busi­ness driven." 
Saint Mary's junior and finance major Erika Lowe was prepared for the large numbe'r of companies pres­ent at the fair. She had done research and was ready to talk to possible future employers. 
"It is a little bit intimidat­ing, but you just have to get in there and talk to people. You can't hold back on opportunities like this," she said. 
Off-campus senior Brian Ronan, also a finance major, targeted representatives from investment banks and consulting firms. Going into the fair, he was not partial to any company but decided to scout firms in attendance. 
The fair was once geared primarily toward seniors looking for careers but has evolved into something accessible for sophomores

Face book prompts concerns 
Job hunters fear scrutiny in hiring 
By ROHAN ANAND and NICK BOCH News Writers 
Facebook, undoubtedly the most popular social networking site for college students, is now posing a problem for those ready to apply for jobs after gradua­tion. 
User privacy concerns are believed to be the most common reason why a growing number of students have chosen to discontinue their Facebook accounts. Until last year, Facebook access was limited to high school and college students by requiring a school e­mail address in order to create an account. 
Now that it is open to the public, more students are growing concerned about how easily their informa­tion can be accessed by non-students -particular­ly important individuals like potential employers in the job market. 
"Students aren't protect­ing certain parts of their Facebook," said Lee Svete, director of career services at Notre Dame. 
In the past, employers have joined Facebook, Svete said, "and invited students to bfl Facebook

NLCentral in a nutshell 
As tho Major League Baseball snason 
winds down and tl1e divisional raens heat 
up, there is one division that has basnball 
wrltors puzziPd on who will take it. 
On tho one hand you have the young and vcwy talnnll~d Milwaukee Katelyn Grabarek Brnwnrs.

Milwaukee fans have boon hearing for ynars from the Brewers. mueh like the Cubs, that the talent will eome soon enough. We just have to be patient. 
The Cubs, who have not been to the World Series since 1945 and have not won it since 1908, are looking to get baek to the playoffs for the first time since thnir heartbreak in 2003. The Cubs man­agmnent went out and spent big time money on free agents and rnsigning play­ers already within the organization. They spent $136 million on Alfonso Soriano fi1r night years in hopes of solidifying thn lead -oil' spot. 
Soriano has been a key trigger in the oflims1~. but his home run produetion is down this ynar, and strikcouL'i have plagund his ofl'lmsive numbnrs. Despite his numbnrs, Soriano has provided a great lwlp to the ommso in front of lkrrnk Lee and Aramis Ramin~z.

Then there are the Brewers. The Bfi)Wers line-up card packs quite thn punch, and their starting rotation is noth­ing to scofl' at. 
Long gone are the pownr-hitting play­ers of Hiehie Sexson, now in Seattle, and Jeromy Burnitz. The Brewers have a few new power hitters. The names of Prince Fielder, Hyan Braun and Hkkie Weeks probably do not strike fear in the minds of' too many ba.'ieball fans quite yet. but soon these three will become household names. 
Fielder has been lighting up score­boards aeross the eountry this summer, blasting 46 home runs to lead the Brnwnrs power surge. Braun has made a grnat showing with the fimner pushover Brewnrs. 
The Brnwers' rotation is not full of big name pitchers, with the exception of Ben SheeL<;, and Jnll'Suppan, an offseason acquisition from division rival Saint l.ouis. Sheets has always intimidatnd opposing hitters minds. With a knee buckling eurveball and at times over powering fastball, he has quieted many a bat. 
Overall, it seems to be the Cubs division to lose. While they wern 8.5 games b1~hind the Brewers as late as June 23, they have brought themselves back into the race, and the next two weeks both sets of fans will definitely be scoreboard watehing. Bewarn world, the Cubs and Brewers are the teams of the future.

Vet extracts toy lizard from r~al lizard 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. ­Seven-year-old Finley Collins thought her pet 12­inch bearded dragon might be giving birth when she noticed an unusual protru­sion near the lizard's tail. 
But Finley's father, Jeff Collins, feared it might be something more ominous and rushed Mushu to an animal hospital, where a veterinarian pulled out a 7­inch toy rubber lizard. 
"I've never extracted a lizard from another lizard before," said veterinarian John Rossi. 
"The next thing I knew, I was seeing legs and a body and a head. It was very strange to be tugging on this thing," he said. 
By the time the rubbery lizard's legs began to appear, Hossi realized what it was. 
"We were all laughing," he said."

STUDENT SENATE 
Leaders address pollution 
Senators urge University to reduce emissions 10 percent by 2015 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
A resolution urging the University to pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 10 percent by 2015 passed unani­mously in the Student Senate Wednesday. 
The resolution, presented by Student Environmental Task Force co-chairs Felipe Witchger and Zaeh Einterz, also calls for a long-term commitment to carbon neutrality. 
The Task Foree is a volunteer group of club leaders that meets occasionally to discuss ways to make campus more 
environmentally  friendly,  
Einterz said.  
The  resolution  describes  

global climate change as "one of the most serious challenges facing humanity today" and says Notre Dame has a "moral obligation to safeguard Creation for future genera­tions." 
The resolution cites the grade of D-received by Notre Dame on the 2007 College Sustainability Report Card as a reason necessitating the resolu­tion. The data used in the study, conducted by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, was questioned by University administrators, who said that no one from the Institute ever spoke with a University representative and that the information used in the evaluation came only from Notre Dame's Web site. 
Einterz credited the University with looking at ways to decrease energy use and increase energy efficiency and said it has expanded its recy­cling program. However, Notre Dame still lags behind its peers in environmentally sustainable practices, he said. 
"One of the reasons for that," Einterz said, "is our adminis­trative support hasn't been as strong as we would like." 
More work can be done by the University, Einterz said. 
The purpose of the resolu­tion, he said. is "for the University to publicly say they are committed to dealing with climate change in a concrete and definable way." 
The resolution acknowledges that Executive Vice President John Affleck-Graves created the Energy and Environmental Issues Committee in January 2007. The committee's Web site says its intent is to "broaden energy and environmental awareness, report on Notre Dame green initiatives and advise University leadership on ceo-friendly opportunities." Witchger sits on the committee. 
Witchger said he did not have data on the current levels of greenhouse gases emitted by the campus. But he said 10 per­cent is a feasible goal for the University by 2015. Harvard University has reduced its emissions by six percent in the past two years, he said. 
"Ten percent is a very basic, a very small goal," Witchger said. 
If the University were more progressive, he said, it could probably reduce -emissions by 30 percent by 2015. 
"This ten percent would just give a public statement, saying the student body wants to take action forward," he said.

Iran warns of weapons readiness 
TEHRAN, Iran-Iran has drawn up plans to bomb Israel if the Jewish state should attack, the deputy air force commander said Wednesday, adding to tensions already heated up by an Israeli airstrike on Syria and Western calls for more U.N. sanctions against Tehran. 
Other Iranian officials also underlined their country's readiness to fight if the U.S. or Israel attacks, a reflection of concerns in Tehran that demands by the U.S. and its allies for Iran to curtail its nuclear program could escalate into military action. 
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Sunday that the internation­al community should prepare for the possi­bility of war in the event Iran obtains atom­ic weapons, although he later stressed the focus is still on diplomatic pressures. 
Fiery meteorite strikes Peru 
I.IMA, Peru -A fiery meteorite crashed into southern Peru over the weekend, experts confirmed on Wednesday. But they were still puzzling over claims that it gave off fumes that sickened 200 people. 
Witnesses told reporters that a fiery ball fell from the sky and smashed into the deso­late Andean plain ncar the Bolivian border Saturday morning. 
Jose Mechare, a scientist with Peru's Geological, Mining and Metallurgical Institute, said a geologist had confirmed that it was a "rocky meteorite," based on the fragments analyzed. 
He said water in the meteorite's muddy crater boiled for maybe 10 minutes from the heat and could have given off a vapor that sickened people, and scientists were taking water samples.

Tennessee lethal injection halted 
NASHVILLE -A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Tennessee's new lethal injection procedures are cruel and unusual punishment, interrupting plans to execute a killer next week. 
The protocol "presents a substantial risk of unnecessary pain" and violates death row inmate Edward Jerome Harbison's constitution­al protections under the Eighth Amendment, 
U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger said. 
The new protocol, released in April, does not ensure that inmates are properly anesthetized before the lethal injection is administered, Trauger said, which could "result in a terrifying, excruciating death." 
Troop bill fails to pass Senate 
WASHINGTON -Democrats' efforts to chal­lenge President Bush's Iraq policies were dealt a demoralizing blow Wednesday in the Senate after they failed to scrape together enough sup­port for legislation that would have guaranteed troops more time at home. 
The 56-44 vote -four votes short of reaching the 60 needed to advance -all but guaranteed that Democrats would be unable to muster the votes to pass tough anti-war legislation by year's end. The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Jim Webb, O-Va., was seen as the Democrats' best shot because of its pro-military premise. 
"The idea of winning the war in Iraq is begin­ning to get a second look," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who led opposition to the bill alongside Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

More violence takes toll on diplomacy 
Six killed, including Lebanese politician, and 67 wounded in latest bomb attack 
Associated Press 

BEIRUT -A powerful bomb killed an anti-Syria lawmaker and six others Wednesday in a Christian neighborhood of Beirut, threatening to derail an effort by an already deeply divided Parliament to elect Lebanon's next president in voting to begin next week. 
Antoine Ghanem, a 64­year-old member of the Christian Phalange party who had returned from refuge abroad only two days earlier, was the eighth anti­Syria figure and fourth law­maker from the governing coalition to be assassinated in less than three years. 
Coalition members blamed Syria. Damascus denied involvement, as it has for the previous seven assassina­tions, including the 2005 bombing death of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri -a killing that ignited huge protests that forced Syria to withdraw its troops after a three-decade occupation. 
Security officials said at least 67 people were wound­ed in Wednesday's blast, half of which had left the hospital by day's end.

Following its expression in Greek philos­ophy, Judeo-Christian tra­dition, the Eastern reli­gions, and postindustrial soeial criticism, Dallmayr explores the works of numerous thinkers includ­ing Bonaventure, Nicolaus of Cusa, Leibniz and Montesquieu. lie also suggests the notion's rele­vance to the turbulent present era and its appli­cability to contemporary personal conduct, civic virtue and political engage­ment. 
According to Cornel 
West, professor of religion and African-American studies at Princeton University, "Dallmayr is not only a major figure in critical theory and political philosophy but also an exemplary teacher who cares deeply about the future of paideia (the highest learning). Don't miss this powerful and poignant book." 
A member of the Notre Dame faculty since 1978, Dallmayr specializes in modern and contemporary European thought as well as in comparative philoso­phy and non-Western polit­ical thought, cross-cultural dialogue, and global human rights. He is the author of 14 books, includ­ing "Achieving Our World: Toward A Global and Plural Democracy"; 
"Dialogue  Among  
Civilizations:  Some  
Exemplary  Voices";  

"Beyond Orientalism: Essays on Cross-cultural Encounter"; and "Alternative Visions: Paths in The Global Village."

Another goal of the delega­tion is to put Notre Dame's work on global health issues "on a world stage," .Jacobs said. 
Archbishop Celestino Migliore, the Permanent Observer to the Holy See at the U.N., came to Indiana last spring and heard about what Notre Dame and Purdue were doing in the field of global health issues, Jacobs said. He then offered to hold the pres­entation event in New York City. 
Notre Dame turned its focus to global health publicly last fall with the Global Health Forum, which featured speak­ers who were leaders in initia­tives to address health issues around the world. In

Father Bob Dowd, a political science professor and the director of the Notre Dame Millennium Development Initiative, will give a presenta­tion related to Notre Dame's work in the village of Nindye, entitled "Partnering with Local Institutions to Fight Extreme Poverty in Rural Uganda." 
He will discuss using a holis­tic approach to address issues like health care, education and HIV/AIDs in rural Ugandan villages and the ben­efits of partnering with local institutions, like Uganda Martyrs, to do so, Jacobs said. 
Father Thomas Streit, whose work in Haiti has been fea­tured on Notre Dame commer­cials during football games, will discuss efforts to end ele­phantiasis, a disease carried by mosquitoes that attacks the lymphatic system and leads to the swelling of body parts. 
"It's a socially stigmatizing disease, and it's completely preventable," Jacobs said. 
 Streit's goal is to eliminate the disease by 2013. 
Stephen Silliman, a civil ·engineering and geological 
sciences professor, will give a presentation entitled "Partnering to Protect Quality Water in Benin." Silliman has taken students to Benin to work with and train villagers so there is a local, trained work force, Jacobs said. 
There will also be a presen­tation describing work done by Frank Collins, the George and Winifred Clark professor of biological sciences and the director of the Cent!u for Global Health and Infectious Disease, who has been assess­ing the ef'f'nctiveness of com­mon malaria control appara­tuses, like bed nets or insecti­cides. 
These four projects are cen­ten~d on relatively small loca­tions, but the lnssons learned in a place like Haiti can be "easily extrapolated and expanded," Jacobs said. 
"These efforts are important steps to understanding how local efforts can be expanded or scaled from regions to much larger areas across con­tinents," he said. 
Purdue will make five pre­sentations. Jacobs said Notre

Hichard Kuhn, the head of biological sciences, will present "Emerging Diseases and Lessons from the Common Cold;" Jess Lowenberg­DeBoer, the associate dean of the College of Agriculture, will give a presentation entitled "Nutrition and Bus.iness Development Initiatives"; and Stephen Byrn, the head of the Department of Industrial and Physical Pharmacy will dis­cuss "Pharmaey Education in Tanzania."

IN BRIEF 
Consumer spending slows slightly 
WASHINGTON -Consumer prices posted a rare decline in August while the battered hous­ing industry saw construction fall to the slowest pace in 12 years. 
The new economic reports Wednesday were seen as justification for the Federal Reserve's bolder-than-expected cut in interest rates to try to ward off a recession. Analysts said the waning inflation pressures gave the Fed the room to cut interest rates while the continued severe down­turn in housing gave the central bank a reason to move. 
The Labor Department reported that con­sumer prices dipped by 0.1 percent in August. It was the first decline since a 0.4 percent drop in October 2006 and reflected a big drop in gasoline and other energy prices. 
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department report­ed that construction of new homes fell by 2.6 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.331 million units. That was the slowest pace since June 1995 and put construc­tion activity 19.1 percent below the level of a year ago. 
New pricing raises food maker's profits 
MINNEAPOLIS -Charging more for Cheerios and Lucky Charms and Yoplait yogurt helped General Mills report an 8 percent increase in its first-quarter pro/it on Wednesday. The foodmak­er said more price increases might be on the way if' ingredient and fuel prices keep rising. 
"We are actively monitoring the need to pass along additional input cost pressures as they arise," Chairman and Chief Executive Steve Sanger said on a conference call with analysts. 
Golden Valley-based General Mills Inc. announced in June that it would shrink its cereal boxes slightly to make them more like competi­tors. Shoppers might have seen lower prices on each box, but the price for each ounce of cereal actually went up. General Mills raised prices on Yoplait in July, and also raised prices on Green Giant vegetables and in il'> food service division that delivers liJod to cafeterias.

authorities; Iraqi control would mean U.S. troops could transi­tion to less combat-intense roles. 
In an interview Wednesday, Jones said he and the other commissioners got the strung imprBssion from Iraqi officials they mnt in Baghdad this sum­mer that they want full provin­eial eontrol without further delay. 
"The wholfl process seems to be aeting as more of a brake on progress than a help," Jones said. "If the Iraqi government is willing, I think we should be putting as much on them as pos­sible. To have a sovereign gov­ernment that doesn't control all of its provinces doesn't make a lot of sense to me." 
In an Associated Press inter­view last week, Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. com­mander in Iraq, defended the transition process. It involves a series of detailed reviews and assessments by U.S. and Iraqi ollieials, eulminating with input by Petraeus and the most senior Iraqi government leaders.

The latest edition of the popular Madden NFL video game series debuted recently to hot sales, despite mixed reviews and grumbling about the lack of substantial changes to the game. Heasonably enough, people 
John Everett 
who pay $50 for 
each yearly edi­
Kids These 
tion hopn for more changes Days than just the cus­tomary updates to team rosters. Hecent versions of the game have included such innovations as Superstar Mode, where you develop your own player and try to turn him into an MVP, Owner Mode, in which you deal with such mundane details as how much to charge for parking and hot dogs, and the unpopular Vision Cone, which was supposed to make quarterback play more realistic, but which aggravated enough Madden loyalists that it was quickly scrapped. 
The problem is that too often these flourishes are added at the expense of functionality. During Madden game­play, the television screen is occupied with full offensive and defensive play­books, helpful hints from the coach himself, statistical charts and other distractions. 
This problem is endemic to society; take the new Notre Dame homepage as an example. Whoever was paid a lot of money to redesign the page has clearly bought into the idea that new neces­sarily equals better. The site is now a Web 2.0 hodgepodge of unnecessary videos and the background color, which is much harder to read against, has only the value of being new. The old site was highly navigable because of its sparse design and white back­ground for easier reading. Its only flaw was that it was not flashy enough, and so resources and time were wasted simply to junk up the site to appeal to people' with shorter attention spans. 
"Ooh, videos, and cool graphics and new colors. Ooh!" 
Facebook too, is indicative of this mindset. I know it sounds absurd to rhapsodize about the "old days" of a Web site that is only four or flve years old, but it used to be that a person would simply signify that they were a fan of "Arrested Development" by list­ing it as one of their favorite TV shows. Information was shared in a concise, readable fashion. And we all liked it that way. Now that same person can add up to four separate applications proclaiming their preference for the show, as well as eight separate Harry Potter applications, about a dozen new types of walls, and an LOLcats picture thrown in for good measure. 
Surely the people who add all these applications can not possibly realize the damage they are causing to the retinas of those unfortunate souls who navigate to their page just to leave a simple message. Buffeted ruthlessly by horoscopes and personality test results, the would-be messenger is dis­mayed, and gives up in shame. 
No matter what, our collective con­sciousness tells us that last year's product must be inferior to this year's, and in our search for complacency through consumption, simplicity and functionality are abandoned. Advertisers spend millions to sell us on the fact that we need this year's bells and whistles, but their work is not hard, because for the most part our brains are wired to be receptive to such messages. 
There is only one hope, and that is a return to simplicity. With that in mind, I have eschewed Facebook applica­tions, a decision I heartily recommend, and I have also reverted to a happier era in videogame history. I have for­saken Madden, and embraced Tecmo. 
That's right, Tecmo Super Bowl, the first and best football videogame to use the rosters of all 28 (not 32) NFL teams, except for those greedy few who denied Tecmo immortality by holding out for a few dollars more. I'm 

looking at you, Bernie Kosar, Handall 
Cunningham and Jim Kelly. 
Tho boauty of TSB lies in that what 
seems at flrst to be a simple game 
opons up into a world of inherent com­
plexity. Though there are only eight 
plays to choose from on offense, the 
true champion player knows he has a 
variety of options to attack from. Each 
teams' strengths and weaknosses can 
be utilized to near perfection. For 
example, Patriots quarterback Steve 
Grogan's tendency to drastically over­
throw ordinary receivers leads to 
throwing perfect jump-balls for Irving 
Fryar. Timm (that's right, two Ms) 
Hosenbach, quarterback of the Phoenix 
(yes, Phoenix) Cardinals may not be 
the greatest threat on the deep pass, 
but using short passes and rollouts, the 
advanced player can create quite a lot 
of confusion in his opponent. 
So come on, ditch the fancy modes, much too complex playbooks, and slightly more realistic graphics and join those few of us who know that sometimes you just can't stop Christian Okoye when you're playing with the Colts, that your kick returner's speed is tied to that of your left tackle, and that there's nothing more exciting than the rare double-jump cut-scene. You too can come live in a world where Joe Montana, Boomer Esiason and Vinny Testaverde are still playing quarter­back. 
Well, scratch that last one. I guess some things will never change.

Musings on the back porch of heaven 
Last Saturday, some of us -mercifully spared the trip to the Big House in Ann Arbor, or was that the Coliseum in Rome? -instead packed into the 6,500­seat Centre Antares, in Le Mans, France, for the Beatification Mass of the founder Father Lou of the Congregation DelFra of Holy Cross, Father Basile FaithPoint Moreau. It was the Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows. (Note to the Athletic Department: We should not tempt the spirits by playing big road games on the Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows-it is just asking for trouble.) A Mass of Thanksgiving followed on Sunday, in Moreau's home, Cathedrale de Saint­Julien in Le Mans. 
They were, appropriately, enormous celebrations. Beatification is the last major step before becoming a saint. All that remains is canonization, when Moreau will officially become St. Basile. 
Which raises the question -what exactly does it mean to be beatified? Or, as my nephew put it, "Is he in heaven, or ain't he?" Beatified, but not yet canon­ized. Is he, like, on the back porch of heaven? Eating hors-d'oeuvres but no entree? In the "Others Receiving Votes" but not yet the Top 25 on St. Peter's AP Poll? 
I looked up at the two-story high ban­ner of Moreau's portrait, hanging behind the altar. What was he thinking? 6,500 people chanting your name is enough to make anyone smile, though when you're already in heaven, isn't everything else a letdown? I followed his gaze down to the floor of the arena. And it was there that it hit me. 
The crowd was awesome in its diversi­ty. African priests in bold multi-colored robes from the Holy Cross province in Uganda peppered the otherwise white­clad celebrants. Bangladeshi sisters from the Holy Cross community, living among the poor in Bangladesh, danced up the center aisle to the rhythmic shakes of tambourines, bearing flowers to decorate the altar. The priest cele­brating next to me -a Haitian -spoke only Creole, our lone point of mutual comprehension an energetic, familial embrace at the sign of peace. Chilean students from Holy Cross' biggest school -St. George's in Santiago is a kinder­garten through high school with more students than Notre Dame -rowdily waved a Chilean flag and sang happy birthday in Spanish to one of their party, Mass hardly being a place to keep silent in Santiago. Domers studying abroad in Europe tried valiantly, mostly unsuccess­fully, to explain where Indiana is, and raised their fingers in swirls, the crescendo of "Gooooooooooooo Moreau" announcing the kick-off to the Mass. 
LeMans, France is three hours south­west of Paris, stuck rather uninspiringly halfway between le grand capitale and the Atlantic coast. It is hardly a place that makes you strut down Main Street thinking, "If my parents could only see me now .... " 
Yet, there we all were -from extremely different places on the planet, priests, brothers, sisters, and lay people, giving their lives away to the Gospel, under the patronage of Holy Cross schools, universities, social services, parishes, somehow all linked to a young priest with an idea in LeMans, France, as his world was falling apart around him in the rubble of the first days follow­ing the French Revolution. A man, only recently ordainedinto a persecuted Church, who founded an order dedicated to evangelization and Catholic education. The more I think about it, the more incredible it seems. We are all here because of him. 
This afternoon, in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities join to celebrate the beatification of Father Moreau. We will continue to celebrate throughout the year. And while the celebration is obvi­ously very much about Moreau -he is in heaven, after all, if only on the back porch -the Mass is, in a certain way, much more about us, one of Moreau's most amazing legacies. 
We give thanks to God today for a man who believed in the Gospel. Who spent his life for Jesus Christ and his Church, in some of the Church's darkest days. Who began to found kindergartens and grade schools and parishes in the middle 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Catholic character m_ore com_plex 
Greg Yatarola ("ND's Catholic-Don't be sur­prised", Sept. 18) appears to believe that the glossy brochures and booklets designed to sell Notre Dame to awestruck high school seniors tell the full and complete story of life at Our Lady's University. While, at first glance, this may be true (the literature should at least be an approx­imation of the truth), it becomes painfully obvi­ous with only a modicum of inquiry that this view is, indeed, false. No admissions publication could ever hope to be so exhaustive. While I applaud the author on his ability to ruffle feath­ers (something that I, too, enjoy), I am nonethe­less puzzled by his piece. Though he purports to "have no right to say whether you should be at Notre Dame," his opinion is thinly veiled. I am curious, then, to know exactly what Mr. Yatarola believes are the core components that make Notre Dame so obviously Catholic. One would be remiss not to highlight the opening Mass of the academic year, our flourishing chapter of Right to Life, and single-sex dorms as evidence of Notre Dame's Catholic character. But I suspect that Mr. Yatarola would not want to discuss the University's resistance to the goals of the Campus Labor Action Project, or to the efforts of those students who seek to bring fair-trade pro­duce to the dining halls, as further proof. Maybe Mr. Yatarola would rather appeal to campus sta­ples like Zahm's semiannual Bun Run, the ROTC program, University President Father John Jenkins's relationship with the Board of Trustees, or the fact that women comprise only 
19.5 percent of tenured and tenure track faculty. These, too, are facts about Notre Dame, a pre­mier Catholic institution. Does that mean that they also make Notre Dame Catholic? Surely the author remembers the debacle created when Jenkins suggested that the Notre Dame commu­nity critically engage the intersection of its dual role as both a Catholic university and a Catholic university-must we revisit this tired debate? While I cannot claim to speak for the rest of the "sad PSA misfits," I will say that many of my friends at Notre Dame do not consider them­selves the "typical Domer." Many, indeed proba­bly most of them are Catholic, yet they struggle with the same issues that I find troubling. But that is the crux of what makes them such good Catholics -they recognize the problems with the system and are Using their faith to inform their actions as they "speak truth to power." I invite Mr. Yatarola to attend a meeting of the Progressive Student Alliance when he is avail­able; we meet on Tuesday nights at 9:30 in the Great Hall, where we try to make Notre Dame a better place, Catholic or not.

of rural France. As more people joined him, he kept building, then started send­ing -first to Africa, then to the US (where Father Sorin, a bit of a rogue, stopped shortof his destination -he was supposed to go to California, but don't let yourself daydream too much­and overspent on a wild idea he had to start a school in Indiana), then to Canada, and Bangladesh. Others would follow to India and South America. 
This is the work of no human. This is the work of Providence. And yet, the mystery of the Incarnation, which is at the very heart of our Faith, makes the bold claim that God dwells among us most fully in a human being-most fully in Jesus Christ, but through Christ, in each of us. This is how God continues God's work in the world-through the inspired work of the human beings that constitute the Church. Some among us are heroes, whose work God blesses to inspire the rest of us, seize our hearts and mobilize our energies. And create places -like Notre Dame-that contin­ue the legacy long after the hero kicks his feet up on the back porch of heaven.

Fundraising valuedatND 
The comments by Kyle Cassily about benefactor Phil Purcell in last Wednesday's issue ("Benefactor deserves thanks for quiet gift," Sept. 13) of The Observer are a poor representation of fundraising at the University of Notre Dame. 
A member of the University's Board of Trustees, Mr. Purcell has contributed $12.5 million to the soon-to-begin renovation of Notre Dame's Joyce Center arena. Facilities are among the most impor­tant components of our athletics program (as they are for the campus as a whole), and they are critical to the recruiting process. Pinpointing benefactors such as Mr. Purcell is essential because that is how the University funds its facilities. None of us would be here ifit were not for these individuals, whose names you will find on buildings all over campus. From a fundraising perspective, identifYing the primary benefactor. especially when the person is in a visible leadership role, helps motivate and inspire others to support the University. 
Maybe the most unfortunate aspect of the negative comments by Cassily is the fact that students benefit the most from the gen­erosity of people like Mr. Purcell. 
Athletics is in the process of raising more than $68.5 million to upgrade our facilities. We're in the business of believing that $12.5 million contributions generally are good things. We think that most of you would agree. 
John Heisler senior associate athletics director Notre Dame Sept. 19 


Keep the career fair unrestricted 
God, Country, Notre Dame. The saying becomes embedded into our minds as the ideal priority of living. It is chiseled in stone at the entrance to the Sacred Heart Basilica. 
At Notre Dame we have a history of supporting our troops -our active ROTC programs, the Stonehenge memo­rial commemorating those who lost their lives in World War II. We are first and foremost a Catholic School, however immediately following our faith comes our duty to the United States of America. 
The article in the Viewpoint yesterday raises concerns about admitting the CIA and Raytheon into our career fair. Mr. 
Angulo, Ms. Hass, and Ms. Quiros bring forth various facts about the war in Iraq and concerns about the CIA's operations. While no one can refute their evidence, to suggest that we refuse companies who support our government and the armed forces to recruit at our career fair is asinine and ignorant. If anything we should be supporting these types of companies to recruit from our universi­ty. Corporations like the CIA and Raytheon, even other government con­tractors like the FBI and Boeing, need the best and brightest minds to keep our country safe. Refusing them the option to recruit at such a renGwned institution as ours would infringe upon our duty to pay service to our country. 
Furthermore, I would like to think that upon graduating from this illustrious university, the recognized men and women would have the competence and intelligence to choose their own career paths without someone restricting their options. The proposed exclusion of cer­tain companies due certain small aspects of their work ignores the other countless other industries that the CIA and Raytheon specifically are involved in. Raytheon's sole product is not the 5,000 pound bomb being used in Afghanistan. The entirety of CIA opera­tives is not solely involved in the War on Terror. 

The Career Fair at the University of Notre Dame is one of the best opportuni­ties across the U.S. to be exposed to an extremely wide variety of companies and to use that opportunity to explore a wide variety of career options. To thwart this opportunity would be a blatant mis­use of the wonderful prospects this great University gives us as students.

Last spring, Cart1~l moved into a "bub­bin" in Nnw York, whern the group mem­bers had 20 days to rm:ord their next album. "CartPI." During this process, the band had runs watching it through a glass window. Tlw end rnsult ol' this strenuous expnrinwnt was this self-titlnd album.

the movie theater. The guitars are simple and fast, and lead singer Will Pugh moans and screams about girls and, well, !.,'iris. 
The unimpressive lyrics sound like they have been sung by 50 other bands before them. lie sings about "looking into her eyes," "hiding myself away" and "needing you thcrfl." These words work for over­mnotional, sensitive teenagers who just found out their erush has another date to homecoming. But to the rest of the plan­et, Cartel sounds like another generic, boring, annoying emo band. 
"Cartel" does have a few strengths. It kicks off with "The Best," an almost seductive intro that ends too quickly. The 
next two songs, "Tonight" 
and "Lose It," are melod­ic jams that, while uno­riginal, make the listnner tap his toes and have fun with the song. As the album progressns, how­ever, these three-minute ditties become boring and irritating. The melodies, lyrics, and gui­tar rill"s all blend togeth­er into one brutal scream fest. 
Where this album real­ly goes bad is when Cartel tries to get musically "creative." Songs like "I Will !!ide Myself Away/1 Will Follow" prove that Cartel will never be the next Rolling Stones, much less the next Blink 182. 
This experimentation reaches an all­limn low at "Wasted," which half-heart­edly discusses cancer and bad parents with the chorus "We're wastnd." 
But wait, it gets worse. 
The pathetic plea is backed by march­ing band-style drums and horns. That's right, the same drums and horns you hear at football games. Whoever thought that a song about being "wasted" should talk about terminal illness and have a beat out of Nick Cannon's "Drum Line" should nevnr bn near anything that records any sound. 
And, to make things worse, "Wasted" comes baek at the end of the album as a remix with Wyelef Jean. A bad song is given a hip-hop boat, inducting a lazy rap by Wyclef about how much George Bush stinks (whieh is a first for conscientious rappers). Both tho song and the remix sound like bad ideas. 
No one should be shocked that Cartel made such a weak record becausn no one really expects the band to make a solid one. Cartel's job is to produee catchy pop­punk tunes that are radio-friendly. They succeed in doing this on a few songs, but

Animal Collective than first meets the ear. 
Though the band's founder and front­man Avey Tare (David Portner) and drummer Panda Bear: (Noah Lennox), both Baltimore natives, first released music together in 2000, they did not create an album under the name Animal Collective until 2003, when they picked up guitarist Deakin (Josh Dibb) and the Geologist (Brian Weitz). Their album was called "Ilere Comes the Indian." 
"Strawberry Jam," which hit stores Sept. 11, marks the eighth time Avey Tare has released an album and the third time all four of the members have collaborated on an efTort. With a splash 
of insightful songwriting and radical tunes, "Strawberry Jam" renews Animal Collective's distinctive sound.

Intricate, eclectic and smooth, the latest Dave Matthews album, "live at Radio City Music II all," eould be one of the best albums you buy this year. 
Matthews pairs up again with Tim Reynolds in his latest solo relea..<;e lor a very distinctive listen. Reynolds accounts for rnuch of this undeniably different touch through his virtuoso guitar accompaniment and rambling forays into ambient sounds. 
IIe sometimes strays from the bounds of the typical tonal music that most people are accustomed to and enters into a strange experimental zone -leaving the listener a little perplexed and uncomfortable. Thankfully these moments don't last long, but they leave a lasting impression. 
The great chemistry between Matthews and Reynolds is impressive. Matthews gives a great vocal performance, nailing both falsettos and screams in well-known songs like "Crash Into Me" and "Don't Drink the Water." Meanwhile, Heynolds keeps up a subtle, ornate baekground -an accompa­niment that pleases but does not distract. 
This album has an interesting mix of songs, contrasting starkly with "Live at Luther College," another collaboration with Reynolds. While "Uve at Luther" had many of the songs that are Dave Matthews Band

staples, "Live at Hadio City" shies away from tunes like "Anl<; Marching" and "Warehouse." The album instead favors less eommercial tracks.

Movie musical ofyore, we hardly knew ye. 
This Friday, "Across the Universe" enters theaters, the latest in a recent surge of movie musicals. "Across the Universe" takes its cues from one ofhistory's most storied bands, the Beatles, by using their catalog of songs as the basis for il'l score. 
These crazy times, they are a-changin'. 
With "Jersey Boys" f(~surrecting the Four Soa..<;ons and "Movin' Out" glorifying Billy .Joel, "Across the Universe" is the latest in growing trend of musicals using a per­lilrmer's library as the source lor their music. Which is fine if you like the original band or you're dying to see "Hanson: The Musical" (God forbid). 
For the rest of us. who miss the movie musicals ofold, we can either choose to sat­isfy our addictions with newer, more tradi­tional shows like "Wicked" and "Hairspray," or we can stroll down memory lane with our VHS tapes. As a huge fan of nostalgic sing-a-longs, I'd pick the latter. 
So, to prepare you for your soon-to-occur marathon of classic musicals, here's my top 10 list of recommendations. May you, too, find that bursting into song at passionate moments in life is normal, rather than a sign that you should see a therapist. 

10. "Calamity Jane" (1953): What's great about this film is seeing Doris Day and Howard Keel at the height oftheir movie musical careers. "Calamity Jane" is chock­full ofthe good stuff-a spunky heroine, a love-hate romance and classic songs like "Secret Love." 
9. "Meet Me in St. Louis" (1944): Released during World War II, "Meet Me in Saint Louis" is a surprisingly topical musical romp that touches on American anxiety in times of uncertainty and change. The film takes place during the 1904 World's Fair and showcases the versatility and real tal­ent of a post-Yellow Brick Road Judy Garland. 
8. "An American in Paris" (1951): Winning an Oscar for Best Picture is no small feat, but "An American in Paris" makes it look easy, with the effortless fun of Gershwin and the talents ofmusical vet Gene Kelly. S'wonderful, indeed. 
7. "My Fair Lady" (1964): Star Audrey Hepburn caught a lot of flack for playing this film's lead, Cockney flower girl Eliza Dolittle, rather than original Broadway star Julie Andrews. She holds her own in this classic, though, opposite Rex Harrison. 
6. "Fiddler on the Roof' (1971): There's something deeply affecting about the bitter­sweet blend of 'Tradition" and the encroaching future in this musical tale of a Russian Jewish family at the dawn ofthe 20th century. Plus, the songs, such as "Matchmaker, Matchmaker," are so gosh­darn catchy that you can't resist. 
5. "Singin' in the Rain" (1952): There's a reason why this film was named American Film Institute's top musical, and it's the powerhouse trio of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor to "Make 'Em Laugh" in this sweet tale of "talkies" in the 1920s. 
4. "The Sound of Music" (1965): Julie Andrews is ridiculously awesome. 'Nuff said. 
3. "South Pacific" (1958): Controversial for its time, this underrated classic deals with complex issues like racism, war and death. Unexpected, especially coming from a musi­cal with lines like ''I'm as corny as Kansas in August." 
2. "Oklahoma!" (1955): The first Rodgers and Hanunerstein collaboration, "Oklahoma!" is gloriously and unabashedly optimistic. Leads Shirley Jones (yes, of "The Partridge Family") and Gordan MacHae carry this mood-lifting musical, which fea­tures lovely songs like "People Will Say We're In Love." 
1. "West Side Story" (1961): This Best Picture winner is nothing short of a modern classic. Plus, it's my favorite, which is reason enough to give it a try. 
So kids, here's to hoping that these ten films are reason enough to keep you kickin' it old school. Or at least out ofthe arms of Hanson.

Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA-Four years ago, Donovan McNabb got off to a lousy start and Rush Limbaugh said the media propped him up because it was "very desirous" to see black quarterbacks suc­ceed. 
In an interview record· ed almost three weeks ago but aired Tuesday, McNabb said people wanted to see black quar­terbacks fail. 
Who's right? 
Both, if the benchmark is a disgruntled few; nei­ther, if the sample is larg­er than that. 
Whatever opinions the rest of us harbored about the topic were pretty much exhausted a decade or so ago, around the time black quarterbacks became commonplace in the NFL. 
It's a measure of progress that most of us understand a coach would play Satan at quar­terback -with the tacit approval of everybody from the team owner to the team chaplain -if he thought it improved his chances to win. 
We also understand the opposite is true, that Eagles coach Andy Reid would yank McNabb the moment he found some· body he believed could run the offense better. 
So maybe the better 

question is why McNabb decided to wake up those ugly echoes. 
He started life in the NFL as a guy with a chip on his shoulder pads, which made sense when you remember McNabb was booed on draft day in 1999 by a busload of Philly fans who rode up to New York for just such an occasion. And in those first few seasons, no mat­ter what the Eagles lacked a consistent ground game, game­breaking receiver or terra· cious "D" -McNabb seemed determined to prove he could overcome it all by doing more him­self. 
Then came success: the Pro Bowl selections, the string of NFC Championship games, a strong supporting cast and a very different McNabb. He cut down on reckless runs, quit forcing throws into tight spots and became the model of consistency. His high school coach watched McNabb play a game back in Chicago early in 2004, the season the Eagles finally reached the Super Bowl, and pronounced the transformation complete. 
"It's like everything else in life," said Frank Lenti, who has sent a half-dozen players to the NFL from Mt. Carmel High, "it takes a while to get comfortable in your own skin." 

IN BRIEF 
Everett Iookinf!_ to move to 
next phase of rehabilitation 
BUFFALO, N.Y. -Kevin Everett could be transferred to a Houston hospital by this weekend to begin the next phase of the Buffalo Bills tight end's rehabilitation, a person close to the family told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 
"That's the plan that probably by the end of the week, if progress remains the same, he'll be trans­ferred back to Houston," said the person, who spoke on the condi­tion of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of Everett's sta· tus. 
The person said doctors still are making arrangements to deter­mine which hospital would best suit Everett, who sustained the life-threatening spinal-cord injury Sept. 9 while making a tackle. The player grew up in Port Arthur, Texas, and now lives in Houston, 90 miles away. 
Puerto Rican horse loses 
I 25th consecutive race 
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -A Puerto Rican horse that can't win a race now has a claim to fame. 
Dona Chepa, a 9-year-old brown mare, finished last in a six-horse field at Camarero Racetrack in east· ern Puerto Rico on Wednesday, a 125th consecutive loss that is believed to be the longest in horse racing history. 
Track spokesman Joe Bruno said Wednesday's loss surpasses an equine losing record of 0-124 set by Australian horse Ouroene, who raced from 1976-83. 
There is no world governing body that tracks lack of success for hors­es, but Dona Chepa's penchant for losing at least beats other notable marks for futility, including Ouroene, Gloria Springs (106, Japan), Thrust (105, North America) and Quixall Crossett (103, Britain). 

Patriot's cheating makes 
coaches skeptical 
ATHENS, Ga. -Georgia is get­ting ready to face Alabama in a crucial Southeastern Conference game. The Crimson Tide is coached by Nick Saban. Saban used to work for Bill Belichick. 
Can you figure out where this is going? 
Yep, for the first time in his seven years as the Bulldogs coach, Mark Richt has totally closed practice for the week lead­ing up to a game. 
While doing his best to per­suade skeptical reporters that it has nothing to do with Saban's tactics, Richt seemed downright paranoid Tuesday when going over his reasons for the lock· down. 
"Things have changed in the last few years. It's not like it used to be. It's so easy for information to travel so fast," Richt said.

Wright, Alou help Mets snap losing streak against Nats 
Rockies get second come-from-behind win in two nights over Dodgers with Hawpe home run in eighth 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The New 
York Mets gathered in the 
infield for fist bumps and high­
fives Wednesday night, and 
while they had celebrated S3 
previous victorins this season, 
No. S4 somehow senmed so 
important. 
Beating the Washington Nationals S-4 behind Mike Pelfrny's good-enough start, David Wright's three HB!s and a hobbled Moises Alou's three hits not only ended New York's five­ganw losing streak, it allowed the NL East leadnrs to breathe a collective sigh of relief. 
Hmnembnr: It had bnen a full week since the Mets added to their "W" column, and they entered the day only 1 1/2 games ahead of the Philadelphia Phillins -New York's smallest division margin since mid-July. 
"It's a big win fi1r us. It's a win when we neednd one," said Wright. who topped 100 HBis for tlw third consecutive sea­son. "It seemed like everything clicked for us." 
About an hour later, the Mets got morw good news: The Phillies lost to the St. Louis Cardinals 2-1 in 10 innings, bumping New York's lead back to 2 1/2 games. 
The Mets have not been pitch­ing well, allowing the Nationals -the lownst-scoring ofrensn in the majors -to score 21 games in the series' first two games. 
But Pelfrey (3-7) allowed three runs in five-plus innings to win his third consecutive decision, and thn bullpen finally came through, with Jorge Sosa and Aaron Heilman combining for three shutout innings before Billy Wagner gave up an unearned run in the ninth. 

"It's critical when everyone comes in and shuts them down," Mets manager Willie Handolph said. 
It began with Sosa entering with runners on first and third and no outs in the sixth inning. 
"A real important part of the game," Sosa said through a translator. "I didn't want to make a mistake." 
Rockies 6, Dodgers 5 
Brad Hawpe hit a two-run homer in the eighth as the Colorado Hockies rallied for the second straight night in a win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednt~sday. 
Hawpn's homer to right came oil' Jonathan Broxton, who also gave up a two-run shot to Hyan Spilborghs the night before. Takashi Saito gave up a game­winning two-run homer to Todd Helton in the ninth on Tuesday night. 
Colorado, winners of four straight, moved a game ahead of Los Angeles in the NL wild­card race. Both teams entered the contest 4 1/2 games behind wild-card leading San Diego, who played Pittsburgh later in the evening. 
Garrett Atkins had a leadoff single in the eighth of Broxton (4-41. It was Hawpe's 26th homer this season and first since Aug. 29 against San Franeisco.

ninth time in his career that 
Holliday has hit multiple 
homers in a game, and third 
time this year. 
Brian Fuentes (2-5) pitched a scoreless eighth and Manny Corpas worked the ninth for his 16th save in 18 chances. Corpas has saved 16 straight dating back to July 7. 
Penny was in line for his 17th win of the season before the eighth inning. Penny went six innings, giving up four runs ­three earned -and nine hits. He also allowed a season-high three homers after giving up only six all season before Wednesday night. 
James Loney drove in three runs with RBI singles in the first and third, and a groundout in the fifth.

Josh Fogg lasted five innings, giving up eight hits and three runs. He was replaced by Hyan Speier. who gave up four straight singles to open the sixth, including one up the mid­dle to Penny to tie the game. 
Speier failed to get an out and was replaced by Jeremy Affeldt with the bases loaded. Affeldt allowed an HBI groundout to Matt Kemp, before getting Jeff Kent to fly out to deep center to end the inning. 
Yorvit Torrealba made the most of a second chance by hit­ting his seventh homer of the season in the second.

NASCAR 
Dale Jr. announces Pepsi deal for next season 
Associated Press 
DALLAS -With a swig from his 16-ounce Amp Energy drink. the robranding of Dale Earnhardt Jr. began. 
Earnhardt officially ditched longtime sponsor Budweiser on Wednesday, announcing deals with PepsiCo. and The National 
Guard  to  fund  his  No.  88  
Chevrolet  next  season  at  
I Iendrick Motorsports.  

Pepsi will market il<> Mountain Dew Amp Energy drink with Earnhardt. and NASCAR's most popular driver was pounding the product after an early appear­ance before 1,500 bottlers at Pepsi's annual convention. 
"They got me up at 5 o'clock this morning, so I've been able to test the effectiveness of the prod­uct," ho joked. ''I'm pleased to be sitting here and not yawning." 
Tlw new alliances mark a dear shift from the party-boy image Budweiser cultivated that made Junior a phenomenon. Now that he's 32 and growing up, Earnhardt is turning into a cor­porate pitchman. 

A genuine affmity for the prod­ucts he's associated with has made Earnhardt a sponsor's dream. So when he announced he was leaving Dale Earnhardt Inc. at the end of this season to drive for mighty Hendrick Motorsports, the phone started ringing. 
"I got phone calls from so many companies, some of them in the sport that I never talked to and some of them I had no idea even had any interest in the sport," team owner Rick Hendrick said. "It was just phenomenal the amount of interest that was there." 
But Hendrick didn't look out­side his existing partners. He quickly announced that Budweiser, who first teamed with Earnhardt in 1999, would not sponsor him in 2008 and began working out new deals. Hendrick has worked with Pepsi's products for almost a decade, and the National Guard is the primary sponsor on Casey Mears' car this season. 
The new sponsors will be joined by a new car number. Earnhardt has driven the No. 8 Chevrolet full-time for DEI since 2000, and he tried to take the No. 8 with him to Hendrick. But step­mother Teresa Earnhardt refused to give up her rights to it, and Mark Martin and Aric Almirola will co-drive it next year with sponsorship from the U.S. Army. 
The No. 88 was used by Robert Yates Racing, which asked NASCAR to transfer the number to Hendrick for Earnhardt. 
"Ralph Earnhardt drove the No. 88 Olds in 1957 and because of this number's history with the Earnhardt family, I felt car No. 88 should continue with Dale Earnhardt, Jr.," Hobert Yates said in a statement. 
In addition to new sponsor­ships, Earnhardt signed personal services contracts this summer

with Sony and Adidas, and unveiled a personally designed candy bar on Tuesday in Chicago. 
"I think there is a little bit of -a maturation of Dale Jr. as a brand," said Mark Dyer, CEO of Motorsports Authentics, the largest marketer of NASCAR merchandise. 

"I think they were ready to go in a different direction with his image. With the change to Hendrick, they were ready to switch their alignments and part­ners and I think that's a healthy evolution." 
NFL 

Leftwich joins Atlanta, practices for first time 
Associated Press 
FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. ­Byron Leftwich knew he would have to pick a new number when he got to his new team. 
Not that anyone in Atlanta is wearing No. 7. But, for the time being, it still belongs to Michael Vick, who awaits sentencing for running a brutal dogfighting ring while the Falcons try to recoup some of his bonus money. 
"We all know 7 is Mike's num­ber," Leftwich said Wednesday, standing at his locker after going through his first practice with the Falcons. "I figured I would just pick a number. Well, 17 didn't look good on me. I'm trying to look as slim as possible. So I just figured I would pick 4." 
No. 4, it is -though the real question in Atlanta is: How long before Leftwich is No. 1? 
The Falcons {0-2) have scored just 10 points and taken 13 sacks with Joey Harrington at quarter­back. Coach Bobby Petrino already took a shot at his starter, saying he's been holding the ball too long and needs to take more chances. 
Leftwich, the starter in Jacksonville the last four years but plagued by injuries, was cut just before the start of the sea­son. He returned to his mom's home in Washington, D.C., where he watched the Jaguars beat the Falcons 13-7 last Sunday. 
"I was in my mother's base­ment trying not to eat all that food," Leftwich quipped. "I want­ed to make sure I didn't get too big, so I would be ready when the opportunity came." 
It came the very next day. He flew to Atlanta to meet with the Falcons, who were apparently mindful of getting burned by Vick as they questioned Leftwich. 
"I guess they wanted to meet me and see what type of guy I was," he said. "They wanted to make sure I wasn't a knuckle­head." 
No word on if they asked Leftwich whether he owned any pit bulls. 

The Falcons' former starter pleaded guilty to federal dogfight­ing charges and figures to spend at least a year in prison. He also was suspended indefmitely by the NFL and is unlikely to ever play again for the Falcons, who haven't cut him yet merely for fmancial reasons (the team hopes to recover some of the bonus money from his record $130 mil­lion contract). 
Harrington, who signed with the Falcons to serve as Vick's backup and try to get his career back.on track, was thrust into the starting role by default. While he's completed more than 67 percent of his passes, he's accounted for more touchdowns by the opposition (Minnesota returned two interceptions to the end zone in Week 1) than his own team has scored (the Falcons managed one TD in the first two games). 
Despite his criticism, Petrino stressed Wednesday that Harrington is still the starter and Chris Redman remains the back­up. Leftwich will likely need a couple of weeks just to get a han­dle on the offense. 
"This will have no effect," Petrino said. "Byron comes in as the No. 3. I talked to him about it, and I talked to the other two quarterbacks about it. They both knew we were looking for a vet­eran guy. We wanted to be patient, take our time and make sure we had the right guy." 
Leftwich, who agreed to a two­year, $7 million contract, just wanted to get back on the field ­even ifit was only a practice field in the far northern suburbs of sprawling Atlanta. He took part in the nearly two-hour workout, then hung around afterward to throw some extra passes. 
''I'm a football player," he said. 'Til tell you, missing those last two weeks really bothered me, man, having to watch everyone else play and knowing I was healthy but couldn't go out there and be part of a football team. I'm just happy to be back out there."

NBA 
Jazz forvvard Kirilenko criticizes Sloan, detnands trade 

Associated Press 
SALT LAKE CITY, Ut. ­Roughly three months removed from their longest playoff run in a decade, the Utah Jazz could have a starting lineup with less firepower next sea­son. 
In a blog post made Tuesday on the Hussian Web site Sport Today, Andrei Kirilenko said he seeks a trade from the Jazz 
and voices his concern with playing next season for coach Jerry Sloan. 
The Salt Lake Tribune con­firmed that the post was made by the Jazz forward. 
Kirilenko, an NBA All-Star in 2004, had his worst season last year despite the Jazz winning 51 games and advancing to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1997-98. He played in 70 games, aver­aging 8.3 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game last season after playing in 69 games in 2005-06 and averag­ing 15.3 ppg, 8.0 rpg and 3.1 bpg. 
Despite a difficult NBA cam­paign, Kirilenko stood out at the European Basketball Tournament, leading his native Russia to the championship to clinch an Olympic berth. He was named tournament MVP and said on the blog that play­ing for Russian coach David Blatt helped him decipher his future. 
The Tribune translated part of Kirilenko's as: "In a week, I need to join the Utah Jazz again but quite frankly I'm not really happy about that. The past season was bad for me and I was really disappointed. I've thought about it a lot and I came to a decision. I want to leave Utah Jazz. The European championships that just ended became sort of a test for me and now I think I know what I want to do. 
"Coach Sloan is one of the reasons. It's not the only rea­son.... [Sloan's] main method to motivate players is to create a feeling of guilt. Our wages, our errors in games and what­ever we do beyond playing for the Jazz is also an excuse to criticize us. I want to play bas­ketball. I want to be happy playing basketball, but I don't want to be a robot in Sloan's system." 
Kirilenko's agent, Marc Fleisher, did not return phone calls Wednesday from The Associated Press. 
The Jazz open training camp on Oct. 6 and Kevin O'Connor, the team's senior vice presi­dent of basketball operations, expects Kirilenko in camp. 
"We explained to him when everybody was supposed to be back and we expect him to be here," O'Connor told the news­paper. 
Kirilenko said in his blog post that he told O'Connor of his request a few weeks ago but hasn't heard back from him. 
"I don't want to be there and mechanically fulfill a contract. Unfortunately, it's been more than a week, but I haven't 
heard from the Jazz leader­ship," Kirilenko wrote. "There's no response negative or positive and this silence is just one more evidence of the way they treat me. Nevertheless, I'm really hope­ful that Utah Jazz leadership will realize that our relation­ship is over and it's time for us to part ways." 
Kirilenko was frustrated with his role for most of the past season. Following Game 1 of the Jazz's opening-round play­off series against Houston, Kirilenko was visibly upset. He played limited minutes in the first two games of the series and was pulled by Sloan from Game 2 after missing a nine­foot jumper. 

He averaged 9.6 points and 
5.2 rebounds in the playoffs as the Jazz relied almost entirely on Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer, which led to some bit­ter comments in the locker room after San Antonio elimi­nated Utah, 4-1. 
Without giving names, Williams accused some team­mates of starting vacation early. Kirilenko was asked about it as he was cleaning out his locker and declined to com­ment. 
Kirilenko, one of the last remaining players from the John Stockton/Karl Malone era, signed a six-year, $86 mil­lion deal three years ago that made him Utah's highest-paid player. 
After the season, he com­plained to a Russian newspa­per about his role in the offense and that he felt he was being treated like a rookie instead of a franchise player. Sloan said in June that the team would keep Kirilenko but that Utah would also try to do what's best for the team. 
"We're not looking. I don't like to trade people," Sloan said. "But we've got to do what's best for the franchise, always. 
"He's got to come and play," Sloan said. "I mean, when he doesn't come and play hard. he can blame it on whatever he wants, but all I can say is what 
I see on the floor. We loved the way when he plays great. And he can be good all the time if he works at it." 
Kirilenko's contract could be a big hurdle if he wants out of Utah because other teams might be unwilling to assume the contract, which runs through 2011. 
O'Connor told the newspaper on Tuesday he spoke with Kirilenko.

Pettitte vvins 200th as Yankees close in on Sox 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK-Andy Pnttittn got 
a milestone ball from Mariano 
Hivera and the lint~up eard from 
manager Jon Torre. 
The Nnw York Yankees got 
another step dosnr to the top of 
the AL East. 
Pnttitte earned his 200th win, Hivera eseaped a bases-loaded jam in the ninth inning and the Yankees edged the Baltimore Orioles 2-1 Wednesday night to complete a three-game sweep that pull1~d them within 1 1/2 games of first-place Boston. 
"Wn'rn right thern and I mean we want to win it," Pettitte said. "We would like to win this divi­sion but just thankful we'rn play­ing good." 
llidnki Matsui homered and Doug Mientkinwiez seored on a wild pitch for Nnw York, whieh has won four straight and 12 of 14. 
"Wn spent an early portion of this year trying to lind our way," Torrn said. "and now that wlwn we eome to the ballpark we nxpnc:l to win. it's a nkn lf~eling." 
The Yankees (XX-641. a slmson­high 24 games ovtw .500, also opmwd a 5 1/2-game lead over l>ntroit (X:~-701 for the wild 1~ard. Now it's the division racn that is eapturing morn of their attention as the season winds down. 
Torrn said he heard the erowd roar in the ninth wlwn tht~ scorn­board showed the Hod Sox worn losing at Toronto, and Pettitte acknowlmlgnd checking on the Boston game. 
It's the dosest New York has been to first place since the Yankees trailed by one game before play on April 20. They began play on May 30 down by 14 1!2 games to Roston. 
"Four months ago, nobody gave us credit. And now we're close to winning tlw divL<>ion," Rivera said. 
Melvin Mora hit an HBI single in the sixth for Baltimore, cutting Nnw York's lead to 2-1. Mora advanced on a groundout, but Pettitll~ rntirnd Nick Markakis on an inning-ending flyout. 
Pettitte (14-8) got the first two outs of the eighth before giving way to rookh~ Joba Chamberlain, 

who had never entered in the 
middle of an inning. Pettitte trot­
tnd ofT thn field to a thunderous 
ovation from the Yankee Stadium 
erowd and doffed his eap as he 
rnached the dugout. Chamberlain 
struck out Mora. pumping his fist 
as he walked ofl' the mound. 
Hivera worked the ninth, allow­
ing a bloop. one-out double to 
Markakis. lie retired Kevin Millar 
on a llyout, loaded the bases with 
walks to Aubrey I lull' and Hamon 
Ilnrnandez. then threw a called 
third strike past pinch-hitter Scott 
Moore. 
Hivera got his 30th save in 33 chances, reaching 30 saves for the fifth straight season and the 1Oth time in 11 years. lie has saved 49 of Pettitte's wins, according to thf~ Elias Sports Bureau. 
''I've got 200 wins now b11cause he's as great of a doser as he is," l'ettittn said. 'Tve been very for­tunatn to be on a great team lor a long time and I wouldn't want anyorw nlse closing out my gamns." 
The slumping Orioles have lost 22 of thnir last 2X games. They scored just six runs in thn three garnPs against the Yankees. 
"Wn fully expected to win tonight," manager Davn Trmnbley said. "It didn't happen, but not be1~ause we didn't put forth the ell"ort." 
Pettitte allowed at least one runner in each of the first seven innings but his defense responded with thrm~ double plays, inducting one that ended the fifth and led to Jay Payton's second ejection of the series. 
Millar l11d oil' the inning with a single. lie was erased when Hull' grounded into a fielder's choice but Hernandez singled to give Baltimore runners on first and second. 
Payton then worked the count full before he looked at a called third strike. He wheeled around and started arguing with plate umpire Mike Heilly as catcher Jorge Posada threw out Ilernandez at second to end the inning. Reilly then ejected Payton, who threw his bat and helmet down as he stomped ofl' toward the dugout.

WoMEN's WoRLD CuP 

Chalupny leads U.S. attack 
Associated Press 
Lori Chalupny has experi­
enced three decisive moments 
in China. 
The first threatened her soc­
cer career. The last were 
much better: two eye-catching 
goals for the U.S. national 
team's quiet mid fielder. 
The latest goal came Tuesday after just 57 seconds, the second-fastest in tourna­ment history. It sent the No. 1­ranked Americans past Nigeria 1-0 and into the quar­terfinals of the Women's World Cup. 
"That goal, being my first World Cup goal, was an amaz­ing feeling," said Chalupny, a former defender prone to menacing late runs. On the Nigeria goal, she stabbed in a close shot off a header from Abby Wambach. 
ller other China goal carne eight months ago in the Four Nations tournament, where Chalupny's soaring 20-yard strike helped beat China 2-0. 
"That goal was a big confi­dnnce builder for me, showing that I can make a difference in these games," said Chalupny, who will guide the midfinld in Saturday's quar­terlinal against England in the northern industrial city of Tianjin. 
Another quarterfinal Saturday has North Korea fac­ing defending champion Germany in the central city of Wuhan. 
Chalupny (pronounced ka­LUP-nee) also had a scary moment almost two years ago in China. Playing in a tourna­ment, she sustained the last in a series of concussions and was sidelined three months. 

"I got hit in the nose, and I 
had concussions before in col­
lege, but this was icing on the 
cake," she said. "I feel I am 
100 percent over it and I'm 
not thinking baek toward it. 
When you are out on the field 
you can't afford to be timid or 
afraid." 

As the American forwards struggle to score in the World Cup, Chalupny, Shannon Boxx and Carli Lloyd provide the biggest threats out of midfield. 
On paper. the U.S. appears in good shape to win its third World Cup title. But the Americans, who are undefeat­ed in 50 straight games. were stretched in their first throe games in Group B -by far the best in the tournament ­against No. 3 Sweden, No. 5 North Korea and five-time African champions Nigeria. 
The group was so good that Sweden -runner-up four years ago-failed to advance. Several other strong teams will also fail to make it when the last group games are com­pleted Thursday. Then there are rising powers in Brazil. North Korea and host China. 
"Overall there is great pari­ty," American coach Greg Hyan said. "The top teams are no longer the top teams by miles." 
The U.S. has seored five goals in three games -three by Wambach. But it has missed dozens of other chances, a slightly worrying trend with the Sept. 30 final in Shanghai in sight. 
"You never put a lot of pres­sure on goal scorers or they will miss more," Hyan said. "The main thing for us is to continue creating our chances knowing at some point they just start falling. We just hope it's soon." 
The Americans have been 
relying on set plays and a stel­
lar defense. They probably 
were slowed by a few wet 
fields -training in California 
has not prepared the team for

"We don't typieally play in downpours and on wet slip­pery fields," Hyan said, refer­ring to Tuesday's rain-soaked game, which was played as Typhoon Whipa was nearing. "We just haven't had that experience. I guess we should have hosed down our lields to get ready for this."

Simpson posts $125,000 bail 

Associated Press 
LAS VEGAS -In a scene of legal deja vu, a grayer, heav­ier O.J. Simpson stood hand­cuffed in court Wednesday to face charges that could put him behind bars for life. The prosecutor who failed to get him a dozen years ago was there to watch, and news cameras tracked his every move as if they were covering a slow-speed chase. 
But as Simpson made his $125,000 bail on charges including kidnapping and armed robbery, legal experts were questioning: Could a former football star who beat a double-murder rap really do hard time for a crime that sounds like a bad movie? 
Police have laid out a case that makes Simpson the leader in a tense, armed holdup of sports memorabilia collectors. Some of the facts -including a curious record­ing of the confrontation ­don't seem so clear-cut. 
Legal experts say that issues such as who had right­ful ownership of the goods and the reputation of witness­es in the sometimes less­than-reputable world of memorabilia trading could cloud the pros~cution's case. 
Simpson has insisted he was merely retrieving items that were stolen from him earlier. 



NCAA FOOTBALL -SEC 
Alfred Beardsley, one of the collectors who says he was robbed at gunpoint by Simpson and several other men, told NBC's "Today" show before Simpson's hear­ing that he didn't think an audiotape made at the scene was accurate. Beardsley was arrested for a parole violation on Wednesday. 
The man who arranged the meeting between Simpson and the two collectors, Tom Riccio, has a criminal record. The other victim, Bruce Fromong, was recovering 
from  a  heart attack in a  Los  
Angeles hospital.  
"The  credibility  of  the  

cohorts in the enterprise would be a key issue at trial," said University of Southern California law professor Jody Armour. 
Agreed, .said Dennis Turner, a professor at the University of Dayton School of Law. "This is a pretty shady world and pretty shady characters dealing with each other in a pretty shady way." 
A key difference with the 1995 murder trial is that there are plenty of witnesses this time who place Simpson at the scene, including hotel video surveillance. Simpson has made no secret he went to the hotel room intending to take the memorabilia and told The Associated Press that a man who came with him brought a truck to cart away the goods. 
"It's not like the murder case involving his ex-wife and Ron Goldman, where Simpson had a completely different story in which he said, 'I was­n't there,'" said Doug Godfrey, a professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law. "A prosecutor only has to show intent. And the intent is, 'Were you acting in concert with someone with a gun to take property from someone?' If you were, you're guilty of armed robbery." 
Simpson attorney Yale Galanter said: "You can't rob something that is yours." 
Simpson, standing in court in a blue jail uniform and handcuffs, furrowed his brow as the judge read the list of charges against him. Gone was the slight smirk he flashed when he was arrest­ed. 
He answered quietly in a hoarse voice and nodded as the judge laid out restrictions for his release, including sur­rendering his passport to his attorney and having no con­tact with co-defendants or potential witnesses. 
Simpson did not enter a plea. 
"Mr. Simpson do you under­stand the charges against you?" the judge asked. 
"Yes, sir," Simpson respond­ed. 
Galanter said after the hearing that the $125,000 bond was reasonable. 
The oddity of the case has attracted a swarm of media, including Marcia Clark, who unsuccessfully prosecuted Simpson for the 1994 mur­ders and was reporting for "Entertainment Tonight." A helicopter television crew fol­lowed Simpson's vehicle leav­ing the court, strangely remi­niscent of the slow-speed chase in which he once fled police in a white Ford Bronco.

Alabama wide out adjusts to new fame after touchdown catch 
Associated Press 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. -The Florida Gators call it "Vitamin Addazio," a rousing pep talk before breakfast that wakes everybody up and gets them energized to play. 
It might be needed more than ever at Mississippi on Saturday. 
The third-ranked Gators face several challenges in their first road game of the season: travel­ing with such a young team ­Florida is playing 48 freshmen and sophomores -and having lost the last three trips to the Magnolia State. Even more con­cerning, though, is the rare, 
11:30 a.m. local time kickoff. 
"The red flags are up," coach Urban Meyer said. "That is a major concern. We don't have the answer. We're just going to keep researching it. I even asked some of the players I trust: 'How do we make sure we're ener­gized?' 
"[Tim] Tebow's fme. He goes to sleep charged and he wakes up charged. I'm not worried about that one. It's the dead fish I'm worried about. Believe it or not, we still have some dead fish that we have to awaken." 
Florida faced a similar situa­tion during Meyer's first season, when the Gators played Iowa in the Outback Bowl and had the same late-morning start time. 
Meyer called former Ohio State coach Earle Bruce and for­mer Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz for advice. They told him he needed to find a way to get the players going early. 
Meyer's solution? Well, some would call it a rude awakening. 
"When we wake them up, it's a circus," Meyer said. "There's no alarm clock going off. There's assistant coaches kicking doors in. Everybody does the same thing-. They rip the curtains open, open the windows, give them an orange juice and throw a newspaper at them and have fun with those guys." 

It worked so well the first time -Florida beat Iowa 31-24 ­that the Gators have used the same routine for every road game since. 
"Even when we play at night we do that," Meyer said. "The players, some of them look for­ward to it. Some of them proba­bly can't stand it. That's part of the deal." 
After the coaches get everyone out of bed, they walk a few laps around the hotel and then sit down for breakfast. That's when offensive line coach Steve Addazio takes over. 
"It's exciting," center Drew Miller said. "He gets up and brings a lot of energy and juice for us, trying to get us motivat­ed. It's just gets us excited and ready to play. He's always got spit flying." 
The Gators hope the pep talk, along with better play, will help them end a three-game losing streak in Mississippi. 
Nice catch 
Alabama receiver Matt Caddell had been quietly pulling duty as a blocker and a decoy, going without a catch in the frrst two games. 
That all changed in the final two drives of the Crimson Tide's 41-38 win over Arkansas, culmi­nating in his leaping touchdown grab with 8 seconds left. 
"That's the kind of guy he is," tailback Terry Grant said. "He's kind of quiet, then all of a sud­den he sneaks up and bites you." 
Caddell suddenly became the Tide's go-to guy with star OJ Hall hobbled late by a sore quadricep. 
Caddell had six catches for 54 yards on the final two drives, resulting in a field goal and his 4-yard touchdown. 
Caddell's nine-catch game was only seven fewer than he had all oflast season. 
But the soft-spoken senior did­n't use it as a chance to gripe about his lack of chances in the first two games, or lobby for more.

Overall. LSU has 1:~ sacks for minus-1 17 yards. They'vn allowed only seven points in three ganws. Not one starting quarterhaek has lasted an 1~ntirn game against them. 
Dorsey, who grew up in (;onzales, about a 20-minute drivn from TigPr Stadium, surprisnd many when he rnturrwd to LSU for his senior snason, to tlw delight of his tnamrnates, Tigers fans and his numerous friends and family who convnrgn on Baton Hougn to watch hi rn play.

llo had very little to prove after his junior season, when he was in on 64 tackles with three saeks and essentially caused the same kind of dis­ruption in opponents' back­fields that he's causing now.

This year's schedule for the Big East's pre-season favorite has been far differ­ent. 
The 2007 campaign started with losses against No. 12 Minnesota and No. 6 Florida. On the way to 4-6, the Irish also stumbled against No. 19 Ohio and No. 11 California. Another loss came to a Missouri team that was ranked in the top 20 at the 
time. 
Not only did the Irish face top compe­tition dur­ing the non-con­ference schedule, the sea­son's turn­ing point has already been reached. It

Junior outside hitter Matlorie Croal returned to the lineup against the Golden Bears, back from injuries that had sidelined her for the first eight games of the season. 
In a match that saw Notre Dame up 2-0, the Irish could not hold on for the upset. Cal won last three games and took the victory 3-2. Because of the devastating loss against a top-tier oppo­nent, Notre Dame could have just packed in its season in a style reminiscent of some recent Michigan State foot­

ball teams. 
But it didn't. 
Down 2-1 in their next game, on the road, to then­No. 22 Santa Clara, the Irish picked themselves off of the ground and made a come­back of their own. The Irish took the match against a team that beat them 3-0 a season ago. 
Now, Notre Dame is ready for the Big East portion of 
its schedule. Of the 16 remaining games for the Irish, 14 are against the usually weaker conference foes. 
Only one team in the conference is currently ranked-No. 21 St. John's. Notre Dame plays the Red 
Storm and one ranked non­conference foe, No. 22 LSU. 
The Irish are an exciting team poised for a winning streak. 
So don't give up on the Irish in their eight remain­ing home matches.

CELEBRITffiS BORN ON THIS DAY: Kevin Zegers, 23; Alison Sweeney, 31; Jimmy Fallon, 33; Trisha Yearwood, 43 
Happy Birthday: This will be a tough year to keep up and schedule your plans. Keep your priorities straight and say no to people who are trying to take advan­tage of you so you won't fall short with your own responsibilities. Think carefully about every move you make. Your numbers are 8, 13, 23, 26, 38,41 
ARIES (March 21-Apri119): Don't be afraid to go after what you want. Make cold calls, talk to your professor about your grades or your boss about a raise but do so with confidence. Love should be high on your list whether you are single or not. 5 stars TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Just be yourself. A dear friend or relative will be there for you and will encourage you to do things that you might not otherwise go after. This is a great day for self-improvement, short trips and getting superb advice. 5 stars GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Don't criticize or poke fun. You are likely to make an enemy or get into an argument ifyon aren't sensitive to the way others feel. Love may be on the rise but the opportunity to get together with someone from your past may lead you in the wrong direction. 3 stars CANCER (June 21-Jnly 22): There may be changes at work or to your everyday surroundings but that shouldn't cause you upset. Take time to adjust. An older relative will shed some light on a situation you face. Love, travel and intrigue will all go hand-in-hand. 3 stars LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Get a grip on what's really going on and you will be able to control the situation. Fun and games should be your goal. You will cap­ture some interest from someone who could tum into more than just a colleague or friend. 5 stars VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Be careful not to upset someone who is already walking a fine line. If you feel you need to make changes to your personal life, do so, but quietly. A secret matter will tum out to be your saving grace. 2 stars LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): You should be booking your next vacation or taking a short trip that will enable you to try something new and meet interesting, new people. You can make some excellent observations, resulting in good choices and gains. 4 stars SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): You may have to do a bit of fmagling but, once you have everything in place, you can sail through any obstacles and fmd your way to success. Money is in the picture so don't hesitate to present, promote and collect. 3 stars SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Don't let others confuse you. You may find it hard to sit still or keep secrets but it's in your best interest. Ifyou jump too quickly, everyone will know that you are a pushover. Anger must be avoided. 3 stars CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Someone may say something to mislead you. Follow your own path. Focus on fmancial moves, settlements, contracts or any other means of making money. Sudden changes in your direction will pay a huge dividend. 3 stars AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): By offering to help others, you will help your­self. This is the perfect opportunity to show you care. An issue regarding children may cause you stress. Don't get all upset before you find out the truth. 4 stars PISCES (Feb. 19-Marcb 20): Someone will stand in your way. Ifyou have done something in the past of which you aren't proud, now is a good time to turn a wrong into a right. An old friend or lover can teach you something that will help you move forward. 2 stars 
Birthday Baby: You have a daredevil side and are able to captivate others, making you an extraordinary leader. You are creative, original, energetic, aggres­sive and a good communicator.

Last-plaee Albion shocked Saint Mary's Wednesday, winning 3-1 in an MIA/\ conference tilt.

COMMENTARY 
Tough luck will not last all season 
Hard schedule mazn reason for team's struggles thus far 
Don't worry, fans. NotrP Damn's 4-6 rocord mPans nothing. 
/\bsolutoly nothing. 
Last snason at this timo, 
Notrn l>anw was (J-5 and prinwd for Big East play. With one look at the records, an unin­formed pnr­

son might Pat O'Brien 
say that Notrn Dame Sports Writer was a lot better last year going into conference play. That person would be wrong -the team's wins last year were against the likes of Bowling (;reen, Valparaiso and Butler.
