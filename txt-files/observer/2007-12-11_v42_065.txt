Students interested in Iowa caucuses 
Primaries hold national focus; NO groups eventually will support presidential candidates 
By KATIE PERALTA and JENN METZ 
News Writers 
When Notre Dame sopho­mores Lindsey !Iough and Matthew Callanan return to their homes in Iowa for winter break, they will be tossed right into the center of heated politi­cal races, as Democrats and Hepublicans battle in the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3. 
The caucuses, the first pri­mary competition in the country for the 2008 presidential candi­dates. have been a focus of national attention for weeks. Caucuses are different from

Students from '07, '08 classes receive degrees

News Writer 
Although most Notre Dame seniors will complete their degrees in May, 224 University students will graduate in .January. 
Tho number, however, ineludes graduate students as well as undergraduates, asso­ciate registrar Chuck Hurley said. 
"About half of these students aro part of the class of 2008 graduating early, and the other half arc class of 2007 students graduating a little late," he said. 
.January 6, 2008, is the offi­eial date of January gradua­tion. There is no graduation ceremony, but January gradu­ates can join in the May com­mencement ceremonies with tho rest of their class. 
Students usually walk with their elass. Hurley said. which means some January gradu­ates walked in the ceremony last May while others will walk this May. August graduates also have the option of walk­ing in the May ceremony. 
llurlcy said there are many reasons students graduate in .January. 
"There are so many special circumstances -everything from fina·ncial reasons to someone whose parent had cancer during their senior year so they took oiT a semes­ter and came back to gradu­ate," he said. "It's about what best !its that student."

Most primaries are decid­ed by secret-ballot votes, but Iowa has a system that requires voters to assemble at an assigned location, listen to speeches by supporters of dif­ferent candidates and publicly express support and be counted for one person running. 

Sen. Barack Obama, a Democrat from Illinois, and for­mer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican, cur­rently lead their respective par­ties in the state, according to a recent Des Moines Register Iowa poll. 
Hough, of Shelby County, Iowa, said she plans to partici­pate in the caucus in Des Moines. 
"Both parties have their own set of caucuses in Iowa, and most of the top-tier candidates will travel around to different locations to speak," Hough said. 
She said she plans to observe candidates before deciding whom she will support. 
"I think I want to get a better feel for things, talk to a few peo­ple there [in Des Moines], before making up my mind," she said. 
Callanan, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, also plans to participate in the caucuses. 
"It is going to depend on my work schedule and everything, but I have not had that much time to focus on the candi­dates," Callanan said. He said it was important to be informed about a candidate before he voted. 

"You should know where a candidate stands," Callanan said. 
The Notre Dame College Republicans and College Democrats have been spreading messages about Republican and Democratic themes to the University community. 
Each group works to elect members of their own parties to political office by gathering sup­port on campus.

After 11 years in the Notre Dame Sports Information Department, Pete LaFleur is moving on. 
LaFleur, a 1990 graduate of the University, will take a 

·job as the public relations director for Geneva Glen sum­mer camp i n Evergreen, Colo. During his time at the Sports Information Department, LaFleur worked with the hockey, golf, fenc­ing, baseball and women's soccer teams and -like the rest of the sports informa­tion staff -worked at every home football game. He is known among reporters and co-workers for his in-depth game wraps, extensive his­torical knowledge and the little-known statistics that were hallmarks of his notes packages. LaFleur said that his slo­gan in life has always been to go the "extra mile." "That's kind of been my approach," he said.

NDSP warns of break burglaries 
By JOSEPH McMAHON News Writer 
Local landlords and the Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) are encouraging stu­dents to safeguard their valuables as they leave for winter break. 
Burglaries and petty crimes on and off campus often increase just as breaks begin, NDSP said in an e­mail sent to the student body on Dec. 6. 
"We often experience an increase in thefts just before breaks, especially from Library study areas and the dining halls," the e-mail said. "Maintain extra vigi­lance on your laptops, book bags, purses, etc." 
For students who live off campus, NDSP is providing a Christmas storage option. Off-campus students can bring their valuables to the NDSP Investigation Section on the second floor of the Hammes Mowbray Hall on Wednesday or Thursday from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. or 
1:30 p.m. to 3:30. 
Many landlords, mean­while, have begun hiring their own security teams to patrol their properties and protect students' valuables. Mark Kramer, who manages more than 150 properties, said there was an attempted break-in on his properties last year during Christmas break.

But there is one part of South Bend winter that I can't stand­wiping snow off my car. 

Surn, I wiped snow off my car in high school. Every morning, I grabbed the brush from the back seat and knocked ofT whatever had aecumulated. 
But at Notre Dame, there's a huge dil'ferencn. I don't drive every day. So when I go to collect my car from D2, I discover not only the snow from tho night bnl'ore, but thn bliz­zanl from last Thursday, the ice storm from two wonks ago, a layer of f'ossiliwd hail and the remnants of thn tiny snowfall from before Thanksgiving that didn't evnn stick to thn ground but rnanagnd to stay on my car. 
And that's just on top of' the ear. Undnrrwath and behind it is a layer of' light brown sludgn that the snow plow has paeknd in so hard I'm afraid it will dPnt my bumper if I try to drivn through it. 
Unlik(~ tlw simpln daily brush ofT. n1moving all of' this snow is a solid half-hour job that r11quires both the brush and scrapPr nnds of my handy snow-rmnoval tool. Sonwtinws it also rnquires a shovnl. 
And it's not just tlw hassle of cleaning ofT a car covnred with a we11k's worth of' snow. That mueh cold wat(1r surround a ear is absolutnly awful for it. Evnry car stored in D2, D6 or thn C-lot over the wintnr is slowly rusting away. 

I have no rncours11 for this. All of cam pus parking is wide open to the elenwnts. 
But it doesn't have to be this way. 
The University should covnr all of its long-term parking (by which I mean certainly D2 and D6 and probably portions of the C-lot). 
This fits right with Notre Dame's long term plan. In the D2 area, two new dorms are planned. They will take space away from D2 parking. So why not build another level on top of' the existing lot? That would doubln thn parking, and cover the cars below. 
()('COUrse, the SPCOnd level WOUld also need to be covered, so how about a nice-looking roof over the top'! 
The same thing could be built in 1>6, next to where the University (eventually) wants to build a hotel. It would provide extra parking for the guests, while allowing students eovered parking-and saving us all from having to brush, shovel and scrape snow and ice off our cars. 
So, administration, what do you think?

Under current Student Activities Office rules, students cannot create groups to support individual primary candidates because those groups would be, by their nature, temporary. Furthermore, the CCC does not allocate funds to groups that support specific candidates for public office. 
Senior Josh Kempf, the chair­man of the College Republicans, said next semester, after many of the state primaries, the group will "jump into action." 
"Because they are primaries, we as a club do not support any candidates," Kempf said, adding that members do tend to per­sonally support various Republican Party candidates on their own. 
After the primaries, Kempf said, College Republicans and College Democrats will begin their official support for their party's presidential candidate.

"A lot of my friends will eome back and I get to see them for like 10 minutes because I've got a soccer game on Friday, then the football game on Saturday and a soccer game on Sunday," he said. 
LaFleur, who is unmarried and wants the time needed to start a family, said the rigors or his job limit how orten he sees his relatives. 
''I've had to miss a lot of weddings," he said. "For my nincns and nephews, I've

And because of that, 
LaFleur is returning to his 
roots. He attended Geneva

1990s, just after graduating 
from Notre Damn. 

In his new position, LaFleur will help Geneva Glen with their ambitious new marketing program, which includes upgrades to their Web site and brochures. 
"It's more of a nine-to-five 
job than what I have now," 
he said.

bly television and radio

sidering starting a eollege

Both LaFleur's uncle and 
father graduated from Notre 
Dame, as did both of his sis­
ters and three of his cousins. 
lie lived in Holy Cross Hall 
before tho dorm was torn 
down -and he stayed a few 
extra days to make sure he 
was the last one to live in it. 
In addition to working for The Observer, Scholastic and the Sports Information Department while in school, LaFleur was also elected president of Holy Cross llall. 

LaFleur's first job after col­lege was at the University of San Francisco, where he was paid $5,000 a year to do stats for all of their athletic teams. The job only ran dur­ing the school year, so he returned to Geneva Glen to work during the summers. 
In 1995, LaFleur took a job at University of Virginia, but only stayed there for a year before finding out about a job opening at Notre Dame. 
As he gets ready to leave, LaFleur said he is trying to get as much work done as possible for the fencing team so as not to leave his co­workers out to dry. 

"I've been working really hard to get ahead so I can just hand it ofT," he said. "I know what it's like when people leave and you have to pick up the slack. It's kind of been wearing me out a lit­tle."

Gore accepts Nobel Peace Prize 
Former VP tells big polluters to stand accountable, lead charge to reduce greenhouse gases 
Associated Press 
OSLO -Saying it's "time to make peace with the planet," AI Gore accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on Monday with a call for humanity to rise up against a looming climate crisis and stop waging war on the environment. 
The United States and China -the world's leading emitters of greenhouse gases -will stand accountable before history if they don't take the lead in that global challenge, the former vice president said. 
"Without realizing it, we have begun to wage war on the Earth itself," Gore said in his acceptance speech. "Now, we and the Earth's climate are locked in a relationship familiar to war planners: 'Mutually assured destruc­tion.' It is time to make peace with the planet." 
Gore was awarded the prize for sounding the alarm over global warming and spreading awareness on how to counteract it. His co-win­ner, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, was repre­sented by the panel's leader, Rajendra Pachauri.

IN BRIEF Ecuador threatens to drill in reserve 
QUITO, Ecuador -Ecuador will open bidding for a nu~jor oil project in a jungle nature reserve in Junn if the poor Andean country does not wceive international funding to abandon the pro­posal, the oil minister said Monday. 
The government is snr~king a minimum of $350 million a year from the international community f(lr 10 years not to drill in the Ishpingo-Tiputini­Tamboeocha fields located in Yasuni National Park. in Ecuador's northeastern jungle. The money is to compensate Ecuador for income it would have generated by drilling for oil at the site. 
The jungle area. which holds dose to 1 billion barrels of crude, is part of a UNESCO Biosphere Heserve. Some environmentalists say the reserve has more varieties of plant life than the United States and Canada combined. 
President Rafead Correa has said Ecuador was not asking for the money as "charity" but as a way for the international community to recognize its "shared responsibility" for preserving Yasuni as a major source of biodiversity. 
On Monday, Ecuadorean Oil Minister Galo Chiriboga told Teleamazonas lV that ifthe money is not collected by June 15, bidding on the fields will begin the following day. 

UBS loses $10 billion from subprimes 
ZURICII, Switzerland -UBS AG will write off a further $10 billion in losses from the U.S. sub­prime lending market, the Swiss bank said Monday, and raise billions in capital through share sales to Singapore and an unidentified investor in the Middle East. 
UBS said it will post a loss for the fourth quar­ter and may now record a loss for the full year as well. That comes on top of the 4.2 billion francs written off in its third quarter, making 14.2 billion francs ($12.6 billion) in writedowns from the sub­prime crisis by UBS this year. 
The Government of Singapore Investment Corp., a sovereign-wealth fund, is investing 11 billion Swiss francs ($9.75 billion), while an undisclosed strategic investor in the Middle East is contributing 2 billion francs ($1.77 billion). 
As recently as the middle of November, UBS had predicted a profit for the fourth quarter despite ongoing speculation about its subprime holdings.

Auto industry hit by slow market 
Nervous public blamed for sluggish car sales; workers forced to cope with changes 
Associated Press 
DETHOIT-TheN. Keller General Contracting Co. of Loxahatchee, Fla., probably should replace its 7 -year-old Ford F-350 Super Duty pick­up. 
But business in Palm Beach County isn't what it used to be, and like many contractors who work in Florida's slug­gish housing industry, co­owner Jennifer Keller isn't inclined to spend the money just yet. 
Not exactly what Detroit's automakers, who have spent the past two years shedding thousands of jobs and restructuring to avoid the industrial graveyard, want to hear. 
Just as they are about to reap savings from job cuts, globalization and a new cost­saving labor contract, and just as many of their new prod­ucts are starting to sell, the auto companies are staring at a slowing U.S. market. 
Because of the nationwide housing slump and the squeeze on credit, many auto industry analysts are predict­ing U.S. sales of just over 16 million vehicles this year. Many say that is likely to drop by 500,000 or more in 2008, the worst performance since 1998. 
"The mode for next year seems to be get through the year," said Jeff Schuster, exec­utive director of global fore­casting for J.D. Power and Associates. 
That's true for Keller, whose core business of remodeling stores has held steady, but concrete-cutting work on once-ubiquitous condomini­um projects has all but dried up. 
The diesel-powered F-350, one of three pickups in the family owned company's fleet, still looks great and runs well, Keller said. Although they probably could afford to replace it now, they are too wary of the future to borrow

Newspaper mogul Black gets 78 months 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO -Former newspaper mogul Conrad Black was sentenced Monday to 6 112 years in prison, far less than sought by prosecutors, for swin­dling shareholders in his Hollinger media empire out of $6 million. 
"Mr. Black, you have violated your duty to Hollinger International share­holders," U.S. District Judge Amy J. St. Eve told the silver-haired millionaire member of the British House of Lords known throughout the newspaper industry for his lavish lifestyle and flam­boyant use of words. 
Black also was fined $125,000 and ordered to pay part of $6.1 million in restitution. 
Prosecutors had asked for as many as 30 years in prison for the Canadian­born Black, saying he had not shown "one shred of remorse" for looting the company that once owned the Chicago Sun-Times, Daily Telegraph of London, Jerusalem Post and hundreds of U.S. and Canadian community newspapers. 
"Obviously, there's a great deal of relief' at the lighter-than-expected sen­tence, said Black attorney Jeffrey B. Steinback, who delivered a passionate, hour long appeal for leniency. 
Before the sentencing, lead prosecu­tor Eric H. Sussman urged St. Eve to impose a stem sentence as a warning to other potential corporate criminals and because that Black had not "shown one shred of remorse." 
Defiant to the end, Black told the court that Hollinger's stock was still in double digits when he was removed as chairman and suggested its current value of less than $2 a share was the fault of those who came after him. 
"I do wish to profess my profound regret and sadness at the severe hard­ship of all the shareholders at the evap­oration of $1.8 billion in shareholder value under my successors," Lord Black of Crossharbour said. 
But a shareholder, Eugene Fox, man­aging director of Connecticut-based Cardinal Capital Management Co., gave a victim-impact statement urging St. Eve to punish Black in a way that would warn other executives not to defraud the shareholders. He said Black showed contempt for shareholders. 
"He called us idiots and greedy fools," Fox said. Reporters asked U.S. Attorney Patrick 
J. Fitzgerald if he was satisfied with the length of the sentence. 
"Mr. Black is going to prison a convict­ed felon, convicted of fraud," Fitzgerald said. "So we proved the case. The bot­tom line is Mr. Black will do 6 1;2 years in jail. That's a serious amount of time. 
St. Eve rejected a request from prose­cutors to have Black locked up immedi­ately and gave him until March 3 to report to prison. At Steinback's request, she recommended the federal correc­tional center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, not far from the Palm Beach estate where Black has been living while out on $21 million bond.

Court says judges have leew-ay in cocaine cases 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON The Supreme Court, weighing in on an issue with racial undertones, ruled Monday that federal judges have broad leeway to impose shorter prison terms for crack c:oc:aine in a ease that bol­sters tho argument for rcdueing the diiTerenee in sentenecs for erack and powder cocaine. 
The court. by 7-2 votes in the crack ease and one other involv­ing drugs, upheld more lenient sentences imposed by judges who rejected federal sentencing guidelines as too harsh. 
The decision was announced ahead of a vote scheduled for Tuesday by the U.S. Sentcneing Commission. whieh sets the guidelines, that could eut prison time for as many as 19,500 fed­eral inmates eonvieted of craek crimes. 
Justiee Huth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the majority in the crack ease, said a 15-year sen­tenee given to Derrick Kimbrough was acceptable, even though federal sentencing guidelines called for Kimbrough to reeeive 19 to 22 years. 
"ln making that determina­tion, the judge may consider the disparity between the guide­lines' treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses," Ginsburg said. 
Kimbrough, a veteran of the first Gulf War, is black, as are more than SO percent of federal defendants sentenced in crack cases. By contrast. just over a quarter of those convicted of powder cocaine <Times last year were black. 
The Sentencing Commission recently changed the guidelines to reduce the disparity in prison time for the two crimes. New guidelines took effect Nov. 1 afler Congress took no action to overturn the change. Tuesday's vote is whether to apply the guidelines retroactively. 
Monday's Suprmne Court rul­ing grew out of a deeision three years ago in which the justices ruled that judges need not strict­ly follow tlw sentencing guide­lines. Instead, appellate courts would review sentfmces for rea­sonableness, although the court has sinen struggled to del'ine what it meant by that term. 
The guidelines were estab­lished by the Sentencing Commission, at Congress' direc­tion, in the mid-1980s to help produce uniform punishments for similar crimes. 
Justice Samuel Alito, who with 
Justice Clarence Thomas dis­
sented in both cases, said that 
after Monday's decisions, 
"Sentencing disparities will 
gradually increase." 
The second case decided by the court did not involve cocaine. The justices upheld a sentence of probation for Brian Gall for his role in a conspiracy to sell 10,000 pills of ecstasy. 
U.S. District Judge Robert Pratt of Des Moines, Iowa, deter­mined that Gall had voluntarily quit selling drugs several years before he was implicated, stopped drinking, graduated from college and built a success­ful business. The guidelines said Gall should have been sent to prison for 30 to 37 months. 
'The sentence imposed by the experienced district judge in this case was reasonable," Justice John Paul Stevens said in his majority opinion. 
Stevens cautioned federal appeals courts to step in only when judges abuse their discre­tion. 
Appeals courts in both cases tossed out the lesser sentences imposed by the judges. The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court to follow suit and order tougher sentences. 
Monday's rulings could embolden trial judges to vary their sentences from the guide­lines more frequently and dimin­ish the chances that appeals courts will overturn those sen­tences, said Douglas Berman, a sentencing expert at the Ohio State University law school. 
Kimbrough's case, though, did not present the justices with the ultimate question of the fairness of the disparity in crack and powder cocaine sentences. Congress wrote the harsher treatment for crack into a law that sets a mandatory minimum five-year prison sentence for trafficking in 5 grams of crack cocaine or 100 times as much cocaine powder. The law also sets maximum terms.

Bill Clinton aids Hillary's campaign 
Former U.S. president tells Iowa crowd about his wife's intelligence 
Associated Press 
AMES, Iowa -Campaigning for his wife, former President Clinton says that when they were starting out he was so struck by her intellect and ability he once suggested she should just dump him and jump into her own political career. 
That didn't happen, of course, and on Monday he gave an Iowa crowd his version of why it did­n't. 
"I thought it would be wrong for me to rob her of the chance to be what I thought she should be," said Clinton. "She laughed and said, 'First I love you and, second, I'm not going to run for anything, I'm too hardheaded."' 
Hillary Rodham Clinton is run­ning now, and husband Bill was stumping for her in the 2008 campaign's leadoff caucus state -two days after rival Democrat Barack Obama got a full week­end's worth of attention by bringing in talk show queen Oprah Winfrey to campaign for him. 
The former president opened a two-day swing through Iowa on behalf of his wife, packing nearly 500 people into a theater on the campus of Iowa State University. 
"She has spent a lifetime as a change agent when she had the option to do other things," he said. 
"I thought she was the most gifted person of our generation," said Clinton, who said he told her, "You know, you really should dump me and go back home to Chicago or go to New York and take one of those oilers you've got and run for oiTice." 
Now that she's a New York senator and in a tight Democratic contest -with Illinois Sen. Obama and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards -the former president said he wanted to persuade vot­ers that she has "the best combi­nation of mind and heart." 
He offered a self-deprecating view of the couple's early life in Arkansas. 
"When she came down there and we got married, I was a defeated candidate for Congress with a $26,000 salary and a $42,000 campaign debt," said Clinton. "If she were half as cal­culating as someone said, that's a really great way to run for president."

Hayden called to explain CIA tapes 
White House stays silent as Congress presses for answers 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Congress summoned CIA Director Gen. Michafll Hayden to Capitol Hill to explain his agency's dflstruetion of interrogation videotapes, as multiple inves­tigations began into who knew about and approved the dncision. 
Hayden is to testify in a dosed snssion Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and on Wednesday before the House IntelligPnce Committen. 
Among tho questions he '11 face is whflther Congmss was noti l'ied about the tapes' dnstruetion. The chairman of the House panni. Hep. Silvestre Heyns, D-Texas, said llaydnn's assnrtion last week that lawmakers were informnd "does not appear to bn trun." 
Hayden told CIA employees on Thursday that thn CIA had tapPd the interrogations of two t!'rrorist suspnets in 2002. 11~1 said Congress was notified in 2003 both of thfl tapes' existence and the CIA's intent to destroy them. 
The tapes were dostroyed ~~ 2005 but Congress was not tl1ld until 2006 at the earliest. The House Intelligence Committee did not learn of the tapes' destruction until March 2007, and then indi­rectly during a general brief­ing about the CIA's interroga­tion program. Heyes said. 
The tapes spanned hun­dreds of hours but "only a small fraction" showed the actual interrogation of the two men, a counterterrorism official said Monday. 
Most of the tapes of one suspect, Abu Zubaydah, were to document his medical treatment, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the tapes are classified. Zubaydah came into CIA custody with a gunshot wound and the CIA wanted to prove it gave him proper medical care in the event he died, the official said. 
The Justice Department and the CIA's internal watch­dog are conducting a joint inquiry into the matter to determine whether a full investigation is warranted. With that review ongoing, the White House counsel's office has instructed White House press secretary Dana Perino not to get into details with reporters. 
"l think that that's appro­priate, and I'll adhere to it," Perino said Monday. She said her previous statement remains accurate -that President Hush has no recol­lection of hearing about the tapes' existence or their destruction before being briefed about it last Thursday. 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Hice said Monday she has no memory of the CIA videotapes. 
Former White House eoun­snl Harriet Miers did know about them, and recommend­ed to the CIA in 2005 that the tapes not be destroyed, according to an offlcial famil­iar with the probe. The offi­cial spoke on condition of anonymity because the per­son was not authorized to speak about the inquiry. 
White House employees have been directed by the counsel's offlce to preserve all documents and e-mails relat­ed to the matter, Perino said. 
Attorneys for one detainee say the destruction of the tapes may have violated a court order and have asked a federal judge to hold a hear­ing. In a court filing, attor­neys for Yemeni national Mahmoad Abdah point to a June 10, 2005, court order telling the government to "preserve and maintain all evidence and information regarding the torture, mis­treatment, and abuse of detainees." 



Shooter had history at school 
Megachurch gunman was former student of missionary training center 
Associated Press 

COLORADO SPHINGS, Colo. ­The gunman believed to have killed four people at a megachurch and a missionary training school had been thrown out of the school a few years ago and had been sending it hate mail, police said in court papers Monday. 
The gunman was identified as Matthew Murray, 24, who was home-schooled in what a friend said was a deeply religious Christian household. Murray's father is a neurologist and a lead­ing multiple-sclerosis researcher. 
Five people -including Murray -were killed, and five others wounded Sunday in the two eruptions of violence 12 hours and 65 miles apart. 
The first attack took place at Youth With a Mission, a training center for missionaries in the Denver suburb of Arvada; the other occurred at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs, whnre Murray was shot by a security guard, though investiga­tors said he may have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
"Through both investigations it has been determined that most likely the suspect in both shoot­ings are onn in the same," police said in court papers. 
Colorado Springs police said the "common denominator in both locations" was Youth With a Mission. The training center maintains an office at the 10,000­member church. 
"It appears that the suspect had been kicked out of the pro­gram three years prior and dur­ing the past few weeks had sent different forms of hate mail to the program and-or its director," police said. 
Murray's relatives said they were grief-stricken and baffled. 
"Our family cannot express the magnitude of our grief for the vic­tims and families of this tragedy. On our behalf of our family, and our son, we ask for forgiveness. We cannot understand why this has happened," they said in a statement read by the gunman's uncle, Phil Abeyta, who fought back tears. 
In a statement, the training center said health problems kept Murray from finishing the pro­gram. It did not elaborate. Murray did not complete the lec­ture phase or a field assignment as part of a 12-week program, Youth With a Mission said. 
"The program directors felt that issues with his health made it inappropriate for him to" finish, it said. 
Police gave no immediate details on the hate mail. And the training centnr said that Murray left in 2002 -live years ago. not three -and that no one there can recall any visits or other com­munication from him since then. 
Earlier Monday, a law enforce­ment official who spoke on condi­
tion  of  anonymity  said  it  
appeared  Murray  "hated  
Christians."  

Investigators have not said whether Murray singled out his victims. But the two people killed at the church -sisters Stephanie and Hachael Works, ages 18 and 16 -frequented the training center, their uncle Mark Schaepe of Lincoln, Neb., told The Gazette of Colorado Springs. 
Authorities searched the Murray house on a quiet street in Englewood on Monday for guns, ammunition and computers. No one was home when a reporter visited the split-level brick home early Monday. Murray's father, Honald S. Murray, is chief execu­tive of the Hocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Center in Englewood. 
Matthew Murray lived there along with a brother, Christopher, 21, a student at Oral Hoberts University in Tulsa, Okla. 
A neighbor, Cody A'ikeland, 19, said the brothers were home­schooled. describing the whole family as "very, very religious." 
Christopher studied for a semestflr at Colorado Christian University before transferring to Oral Hoberts, said Honald Rex, dean of admissions and market­ing at Colorado Christian. He said Matthew Murray had been in contact with school oflieials this summer about attending thP school but decided he wasn't interested because he thought the sehool was too expensive. 
Police said Murray's only pnwi­ous brush with the law was a traffic ticket earlier this year. 
Senior Pastor Brady Boyd of New Life Church said the gun­man had no connection to the church. "We don't know this shooter," Boyd said. "lie showed up on our property yesterday with a gun with the intention of hurting people, and he did." 
The gunman opened fin~ at 
12:30 a.m. at the Youth With a Mission center. Witnesses said the man asked to spend the night there and opened fire with a handgun when he was turned down. They described him as a young man, perhaps 20, in a dark jacket and cap. 
Later, at New Life Church, a gunman wearing a trench coat and carrying a high-powered rifle opened fire in the parking lot and later walked into the church as a service was letting out.

This past weekend saw the theatrical debut of another children's fantasy book adaptation: ''The Golden Compass," based on the first volume in Philip Pullman's "I lis Dark Materials" trilogy. The movie has garnered a healthy sham of James Dechant nwdia attention rncPntly due to oblo­
Foregone
quy by various 
Conclusion

Christian organiza­tions. The groups point to the blatantly anti-Christian, even anti-religious, tone of the book and movie. Some of these critiques make the mistake of trying to contain art rather than letting it speak for iL<;e)f, good or bad, a misstep we can all appreciate hen1 on campus. 
Their concerns certainly hold merit. Pullman has dnscriblld his books as being "about killing God" with the express pur­pose of undermining the basis of Christian belief. The trilogy is a modern reversal of "Paradise Lost" in which the characters celebrate rather than mourn their independence from the divine, a rill' on the plot of Shelley's "Prometheus Unbound." Pullman is an outspoken, bel­licose atheist who sees evil in all organ­ized reli1-,rions and regularly speaks out against ecclesial hierarchy. 
The funny thing is, "The Golden Compass" and its sflquels actually do a better job of making a ease for humanism or atheism than they do attacking reli­gious institutions -which would seem the easier target. The book promotes free human action and virtue without any divine referent and makes serious, ardent ideological arguments for atheism. Its attacks against the Church, however, are laughable. Pullman uses priests in the book as cookie-cutter villains who pursue and harass the protagonists, but he demonizes them so unequivocally that his puerile characterizations of their institu­tion cannot be taken seriously. 
The Church clergy who make up the film version's evil antagonists-here referred to as the Magisterium -are even more laughable as a mass-produced

pastiche. They sit in their tower plotting how to captun1 children and suppress the world's freedom. Sinister music accompa­nies their few brief scenes and Christopher Lee, legendary cinema vil­lain, makes a short appearance as the token plotting mastermind. 
In case you're wondering, the movie is an average flick overall. Director Christ Weitz has watnred down the antireligious messagn considerably. The film moves quickly from one goal-orientnd action scene to another without giving the char­acters much time to develop any of the book's philosophical themes, played down in this version. In short, the books are better. 
Given the strident vitriol of "His Dark Materials," one can see why the Catholic League, an American anti-defamation organization, finds the movie upsetting. They say the film may bait viewers into buying the books for their children. Valid point. But their strategy for countering the book and film's message calls for a boycott of the movie. 
Unfortunately, the League does not understand that calling for this boycott only brightens the spotlight on the film. Perhaps "any news is good news" goes too far, but calling for a boycott on a film or book is like asking for a host of media attention. The Catholic League hopes the film's box office take will disappoint because of their efforts. Instead. you can bet all the attention they give it will only spike profits, no matter their relation to projections. 
The trilogy is profoundly anti-Catholic and anti-religious, even avowedly so. Nevertheless, there are elements in the books that make for a good story and a good tale -and many even make a good moral message. The plot is well paced and Pullman turns the book's universal themes into beautiful writing, particularly towards the trilogy's end. The Catholic League fails to recognize this redeeming content, but other groups do not. 
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops responded differently-and, as I see it, much more intelligently. It acknowlndges the bounty of ofl'nnsive material in the book but notes its dramatic reduction in this adaptation. The bishops' Film and Broadeasting O!lice even gives the film a positive review and calls it "an exdting adventum story with, at its core, a tradi­tional struggle bdwoen good and evil and a generalized rPjection of authoritarian­ism." They cite the heroism and self-sac­rifice exhibited by the film's altruistic characters. Mornover, they weleome the potential pedago1-,ric value to bn had in an honest inquiry of the book's contenl'i. "Rather than banning the movie or books, parents might instead take the opportuni­ty to talk through any thorny philosophi­cal issues with their teens," they advise. 
The film's varied responsfJS from Christians should provide a Jesson on how to deal with material that any group finds threatening or irreconcilablo. Trying to control the media rnalrn should be aban­doned in favor of allowing art to spnak il<> part. The message applies to everyone from government<> keen on suppmssing dissenters to colleges questioning the aca­demic validity of performance art. Notre Dame itsnlf hopnfully learnnd a lnsson when it questioned the place of 'The Vagina Monologues" here on eampus. 
That doesn't mean art is free to do whatever it wanl<> scot-free, but you can­not damp down on it from an authoritari­an position. Instnad of the "don't touch," hands-on· approach that the Catholic League advocates, we should adopt the constructive hands-on approach of the bishops. We must be willing to engage diflicult questions and grapple with provocative themes. We must welcome dissent.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Comics offensively unfunny 


U-WIRE 

Putting the I can' back in I candidate' 
By the time classes resume for the spring semester, voting in the 2008 election will have alnmdy gotten underway. With the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary in the very near future (Jan. 3 and 8, respectively) the Daily would like to take this last opportuni­ty to offer some parting reflections. 
We're excited about the upcoming election for several reasons. Eight years of an admin­istration that refused to face realities, both in the Middle East and at home. subverted the Constitution and never admitted its failings, was Staff Editorial eight years too many. A new face in the White House is long overdue. 
It has aL'io been nice to see the concrete proposals that have been coming out of primary races thus far. Instead of spewing nebulous Tufts Daily promises to end the war in Iraq and to fund universal heath care coverage, campaigns have put forth specific timetables for withdraw­
Tufts 
al and precise health care plans 
University
In short, we are hopeful that the next year will bring fruitful debate and a truly new direction for the country. But there is one aspect of the political process that we hope won't be too prevalent in the coming months: Attempts from candidates to appear folksy, down-to-earth, and just like the Average Joe are not wel­come, especially after nearly eight years of President Bush. 
Bush represented the worst of this anti-intellectual streak. Although he comes from the most privileged of backgrounds, his feeble attempts at scholarship in school seemed to be a personal way of rebelling against the elitist Ivory Tower 

A summa cum laude degree from Yale shouldn't be a prerequisite for presidency, but it sure doesn't hurt. What's most bothersome about Bush is his persistent lack of intellectual curiosity, manifested in the fact that he doesn't read daily papers and didn't seem interest­ed in succeeding in higher education 
We aren't looking for a president with whom we can sit down and drink a beer. We don't want an Average Joe ascending to one of the most powerful positions in the Western World; we want to see a leader who jumps at intellectual and political challenges and who can relate to the population without reaching to the lowest common denominator. 
A candidate who promises to be just like the rest of us isn't a leader at all, and being in tune with the needs of Americans does not eqliate to taking up the same entertainment and lifestyle choices of the rest of the country: 
We hope that the coming months will feature rich debates that go beyond the clothing choice of candidates and instead serve as forums for nationwide discussions. With any luck, the election will be headed in exactly that direction as we take up our books again in January. 
This article originally appeared in the Dec. 10 issue ofthe Tufts Daily, the daily publica­tion ofTufts University. The views expressed in this article are those ofthe author and not necessarily those of The Observer. 
Throughout this semester, the Obsnrver comics have continually offended me-all of them. Is it their topics? Their style? Certainly not. Any style or subject can be made into something funny. Wait, that's it! They're just not funny­such that I feel truly offended. I can hardly recall any Observer cornic inducing some sort oflaugh from me. Perhaps a short guffaw from "Black Dog" or a chuckle from "Tastes like Failure." Certainly nothing from the embarrassingly awful"Deuces Manor." But even those reactions arc few and far between. I attribute this to the often weak punch lines from the first two, and the relative absence of one in thf~ la'it. 
I know that comedy is purely sub­jective, but am I really alone with my criticism? For instance, I don't recall a single person among friends, classmates, and coworkers who has given me a positive response about the Observer comics. The best I have heard is "mediocre" or "Hey, they try." Maybe I should just ask more peo­ple; perhaps a random poll around campus would prove me wrong. But this late in the semester, that seems pointless. 
Instead, I hope that The Observer prepares a clean slate for next semester and takes out every comic from its syndication to give others a chance. I think the best approach for this is to hold a one week tryout for new comics and let the readers decide. (Please, no voting by e-mail. I'm sure someone on the Observer staff can ask around during meal times.) I know that I am taking these comics rather seriously, but previous Viewpoint letters prove I'm not the only one. "Offensive" materi­al doesn't bother me, but bad mate­rial does. Newspaper comics give Notre Dame students, both artists and writers, a chance to practice their creative skill<> and present them publicly. Instead, these comics seem to be in The Observer just so there are comics in The Observer. There are Notre Dame students who would work hard to create quality comedic material for The Observer, and we owe it these peo­ple to give them a decent chance. 

The comic to the right was drawn by the author ofthis letter.

While I agree with Pat McHugh that "Pie is an overlooked dessert option" ("Dining hall menu needs adjusting," Dec. 7), I must comment that the pie offered at the South Food Market is subpar, mediocre at best. McHugh would like to rectify this perceived "lack of pie" with more of the same. This is simply not the correct path to take. Hather, South Food Market should seek out new vendors in an aggressive campaign to improve the quality of pie offered. 
Only then should we begin to ask, "What is up with the Oriental line?"

MATT HUDSON I Observer Graphic 

If you were a new indie rock band that made a stunning debut in the past five years, you put out another album in 2007 (The Arcade Fire, Iron & Wine, The Shins, LCD Soundsystem, Feist, Beirut). If you were an already established indie rock band with a 
Sean Hoban 

long string of albums (Wilco, Ted Leo, Bright Scene & Heard 
Eyes, White Stripes), you also put out an album in 2007. As such, top-1 0 lists already creeping out on the internet and in the zines are bound to be weighed down by the big 
names. However, none of these bands/ musi­cians made my top 10 list. How come? While each put out pretty solid albums, they weren't phenomenal. To be blunt, it is the music lovers typical (and annoyingly over­used) statement, "Well, I liked their early stuff better." But it's true -mostly these bands borrow very heavily from the amaz­ing albums they put out in the past few years: Arcade Fire's earth -shattering self -titled, Iron & Wine's memorable collabo­ration with Calexico, Beirut's exploratory Soviet sound, The Shins folksy Simon & Garfunkel style. They each have added some new complexities, and were even remark­able, but just not top of the pile. Others have stuck pretty much entirely in the same slightly more fun generation of young music lovers. Vaguely sinister, but also lovely.

St. Vincent, "Marry Me." Competing with Jens for most beautiful record, every song is different, some jarring and some whisper soft, but all breathtaking.

7.

8. 
Bat For Lashes, "Fur and Gold." Hather creepy at first with a slightly Arabian nights feel, dark and aromatic, honest but confus­ing, easy to get lost in, etc. 

9. 
Kate Nash, "Made of Bricks." Alternately fun/ spunky, endearingly inno­cent/naive and ernest/ heartfelt, she replaces Lilly Allen as my favorite British girl singer.

2. 
Fiery Furnaces, "Widow City." The brother-sister duo add some tough rock & roll elements to their quirky, literary and downright weird sound.

Two hopeful Dolphins fans invoke St. Nick's help Sunday during Miami's 38-17 loss to Buffalo. The loss dropped the Dolphins to 0-13, causing worries about Miami coach Cam Cameron's job security. 
Cameron faces questions after 0-13 record 
Associated Press 
DAVIE, Fla. -When Cam Cameron began his first training camp as an NFL head coach in late July, he said he was unfazed by the many chal­lenges facing the Miami Dolphins. 
''I'm not a worrier," he said. "I don't go down that road." 
Maybe that's why Cameron appeared remarkably relaxed Monday. He even cracked a hint of a smile a couple of times. 
Most coaches would be ready to explode or implode. An 0-13 record tends to have that effect. But Cameron calmly repeated the pledge to per­severance that has become his mantra. 

"We've said it all along: We're not in the position we want to be in," he said. "But we have to face it. We need to deal with it. We need to attack it." 
The clock is running. Cameron has been on the job nearly 11 months and still seeks his first victory, which raises a question: How much longer does he have with the Dolphins? 
His job may be in jeop­ardy after only one season if he becomes the first 
coach to go 0-16. "We are all in this thing together," Cameron said. 
But his future may hinge on his players, a scary proposition because the team that may be remem­bered as the most woeful in NFL history seems to be getting worse. 
The Dolphins have lost their past two games by a combined 78-30. In Sunday's 38-17 loss at snowy Buffalo, Miami had a franchise record eight fumbles and tied a team record by giving up 24 points in the first quarter. 
The defeat was Miami's 16th in a row-a season's 
IN BRIEF Vick sentenced on charges
of dogfighting, lying 
RICHMOND, Va. -Michael Vick was sentenced to prison Monday for running a dogfighting operation and will stay there longer than two co­defendants, up to 23 months, because he lied about his involve­ment when he was supposed to be coming clean to the judge who would decide his fate. 
The disgraced NFL star received a harsher sentence than the others in the federal conspiracy case because of "less than truthful" statements about killing pit bulls. 
Vick said he accepted responsibili­ty for his actions, but U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson said he was­n't so sure. 
''I'm not convinced you've fully accepted responsibility," Hudson told Vick, who arrived in court wearing the black-and-white striped prison uniform he was issued when he vol­untarily surrendered Nov. 19 to begin serving his sentence early. 

Tibet barred from forming 
own Olympic team 
LAUSANNE, Switzerland -The International Olympic Committee has rejected an attempt by Tibet to field its own team at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 
More than 100 Tibet supporters­including some Buddhist monks ­waved banners and Tibetan flags outside the IOC headquarters Monday, as delegates from the unof­ficial Tibetan National Olympic Committee met with the organiza­tion's officials to discuss the request. 
"The IOC is not in a position to accept our application," said Wangpo Tethong, a president of the Tibetan group. 
Michel Filliau, a senior IOC official who took part in the meeting, said a rule change in 1996 meant only national committees from countries recognized by the international community can take part in the Olympics. 
worth. "Obviously it hasn't got­ten easier," Cameron said. 
The Dolphins are last and least in the league by such a wide margin they're already virtually assured of the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft for first time. 
Owner Wayne Huizenga last spoke to the media in October, when he said Cameron had done a "great job" keeping the team together and the atmosphere positive despite an 0-7 start. But Huizenga must be alarmed by the direction of a fran­chise that has become a national punch line. 

Royals' Guillen backed by
Umon in steroids case 
NEW YORK-The players' associa­tion filed a grievance Monday to over­turn the 15-day suspension given to Kansas City Royals outfielder Jose Guillen for violating baseball's drug program. 
Guillen and Baltimore's Jay Gibbons were suspended last Thursday by com­missioner Bud Selig following media reports that they received human growth hormone after January 2005, when it was banned by baseball. Gibbons chose not to contest his penal­ty. 
Arbitrator Shyam Das will decide whether Selig's suspension of Guillen was proper. The penalty is to be served at the start of next season. 
"It's been agreed that the matter needs to be resolved prior to opening day," said Michael Weiner, the union's general counsel. 
Guillen has not been charged by the government with a crime, and he is not known to have failed a drug test.

Associated Press 
TAMPA, Fla. -For the first timn in threP wncks, there's delinitivn word on Jnl'f' Garda's sore back. 
Tlw Tampa Bay quarterback is nxpn<~tnd to return to the line­up this wnek after missing two ganws and most of a third with a lownr back bruise that has kept opposing tnams guessing about his availability. 
Coach .Jon Grudnn said Monday that despite vague statnments lw made about Carda's status leading up to gamns against Nnw Orleans and llouston. he rwver plannnd his lwalth." 

"A lot of guys ean play hurt. Jeff clearly could have played," Gruden said. "It was our deci­sion as an organization to hold him for two games." 
McCown threw for 266 yards and no intereeptions, but was sacked four times and lost a fumble that set up a touchdown in a 2S-l4 loss that stopped the Bues (S-5) from clinching the NFC South. 
While (~ruden is looking for­ward to getting his regular starter back on the field, he said he saw enough from McCown the past two weeks to feel better about the team's back­

healthy," he said, "[and! if I

It's th.e falloff in wins in 
reeont years that has 
increased focus on Bowdon's 
age. 

"I do have an obligation to 
the university to win llJHWgh ·ball games," said Bowden, who is 14-11 the past two seasons heading into a Dec. 31 Music City Bowl game 
against Kentucky. 

Fisher, a disciple of the 
Bowden coaching family who 
played and coached for Terry 
Bowden, spent mueh of his 
time praising the family patri­
arch and avoiding details on what exaetly he agroed to. 
"This gives me some peace," said Fisher, who has .not boen a h.oad cocu:h before. 
''I'm content to wait for it." 

Torry Bowden, who has been out of coaching for a deeadn sinee being fired at Auburn, helped persuade Fisher to take the o!Tnnsivc coordinator's job earlier this year. TIH~ job opened when younger brother Jeff Bowden was bought out by dissatislind ' boosters late in the 2006 soa­son. 
A West Virginia native, Fisher was paid roughly $420,000 as offensive coordi­nator this year. 
that Gruden sent 

Garcia back into the game in the fourth quarter. McCown had a big day passing and led a last-minute TD drive to bnat tlw Saints two weeks ago, but was not nearly as sharp against the Texans.

After scandal, Jets will play Patriots 
Associated Press 

FOXBOIWUGII. Mass. -Bill 
Bnliehiek has been watd1ing 
vidnotapn of' tlw Nnw York .Jets 
-tlw kind that won't cost him 
$500,000. 

Tlw kind that could lwlp his 
Patriots stay unbnatnn rwxt 
Sunday by lwat.ing tlw tnam that 
turned him in li>r having an on­
liPid 1~anwra snoop on thn sidn­
lirw. 

In preparing for Sunday's :H­I:~ win owr Pittsburgh, Bnlkhirk studied tapP of' a ganw thrnn WPnks ParliPr wlrnn tlw .Jets upset. tlu StPPlnrs I !J-16 in over­linw. 
"My improssion of' tlwm was in tlw Pittsburgh ganw thny played vnry well. And thny bnat Pittsburgh," lw said Monday. "Tiwy havn sonw outstanding playnrs." 
Bnlichick didn't nwntion Jnts

a string of I:{ wins that loaves 
llw l'atriolo.; just throe short ol' a 
perli1d regular soason. 

In thn first quarter of that gamn, t.hn Jets had a Patriots sidnlirw camera shut down. Thny 1~omplairwd tlw Patriots wnrn trying to steal their coaches' defensive signals in violation of lnagun ruins. 
Thn punishmnnt: NFL eommis­siorwr Hognr Goodnll finod Bnlichick $500,000 and tho team $250,000 and took away orw of tho Patriolo.; two first-round draft 
choiCI~S. 

Is it payback tinw? Will thn juggernaut accused of running up thn score in some blowout wins make those look like sqtwakers'? 
Bnlidrick wasn't saying. 

lin was asked live times at his rwws confernncn Monday about llw impact or tho spying scandal on Sunday's rnmatch and responded with his stock answer: Bnlichiek will preparn the same way he dons li>r all games. 
Any addnd motivation? "We'rn 
going to approach it like evPry 
other game." 
And what is that approach'? "Just thn way we've done all of them. Como in. look at thP tihn. get togntlwr a game plan, try to ligurn out tlw bost way to attack and dnfend them. Try to win." 
Whotlwr Beliehkk or his play­nrs rnvnal thnir trun l'nelings, thn complaint about tlw camera should provide extra incentive. It did wlwn Nnw England cruslwd San Diego 3S-14 thren days after GoodPII slapped tho Patriots and their coach for thP shenanigans. 
"Aftl'r Pwrything that went on this wnnk. wo wantnd to do our bnst for Bl'lichick," Tom Brady said aftpr the win over thP <:hargPrs. 
And just last week. they used Pittsburgh safoty Anthony Smith's guarantee of a vktory to lirn themselves up. 
"W11 took it as a challengP. Wn wem going to como out here and show tlwm what we had," said .Iabar Gaffney, who burned Smith for a 56-yard touchdown rncnption. 
Even Belichick, who rarely criticizes an opponent, took a public swipe at Smith aller the game. 
"We've played against a lot bntt11r safeties than him," Bnliehick said. 
But lw was back in his bland mode Monday: "Thnre's no points for any quotns that were or wernn't in the paper. (The) plays that we exncutml woll, we gainod yards on. The plays that we didn't, we didn't gain yards on and there wore some of both." 
The Patriots had pulled out their previous two games by three points each with fourth­quarter comebacks against los­ing teams. Then they dominatod the Stnnlers, as they did most ol' thoir first 10 opponnnts, when thnir averagn vietory margin was 
25.4 points. 
Tom Brady throw for 399 yards and four touchdowns and wasn't sacked by a defense that had allowed the fewest yards in the NFL.

Illini go to Rose Bovvl for fifth fune 
Associated Press 

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. -The score at halftime was 56-3. Most of Penn State's starters spent the second half parked on the bench, and by the time the game linally Pnded, Illinois had given up the most points in Memorial Stadium history. 
Even for a program used to medioerity. that loss in October 2005 was a debacle. 
"During the game, I said, 'I've never been here before.' We were getting killed," Illinois coach Ron Zook n~called. "I said. 'Fellas, this is as bad as it's going to get. It will mwer be any worse than it is tonight."' 
In the silence and humilia­tion or that awful night, the sm~ds for a turnaround were plantPd. Two years later, the Illini are one of' the biggest sur­JWises in college football. Their 9-3 record is a seven-game improvement !'rom last year, and earned them an unexpect­nd Hos1~ Bowl date with USC. 
It is only the fifth time in school history -and lirst time since 1983 -that Illinois will go to Pasadena. 
"I expected to be in a bowl game," junior linebaeker Brit Miller said. "But to end up in the Hose Bowl was not expect­oct at all. ll' someone would have told us we'd end up in tho Hose Bowl in camp, we proba­bly would have looked at them a little differently." 
Doing things differently is what Zook set out. to do when hP arrivnd three years ago, six weeks aftPr being fired at Florida. 
Illinois was hardly a Big Ten power or oven a contender, really. At least, not in the last 50 years. Tlu~ lllini would usu­ally put tognthor ono impres­sivo season a deeadn, but records of 4-6, 6-5 and 5-5 were morn typical. After lllinois went to thn Sugar Bowl after the 2001 season, live los­ing seasons followed. 
"You don't go to college say­ing, 'I want to bo on a losing team.' Everybody wants to win," said linebacker J Lnman, who won only night games his lirst four y1~ars at Illinois. "To go 2-30 in your own confer­oneo, whore you'm supposed to be competitive, at a school like Illinois, that's not somn­thing to be vory proud of at all." 
Perhaps worst were the expectations. Or lack thereof. While a 7-5 season would be a disappointment at Ohio State or Michigan, that was consid-

en~d a great yoar at Illinois. And those years whon the lllini wnnt 2-9 or 0-11 '! Well. bas­ketball season was right around the corner. 
"I rnmmnber two years ago, it was the last game of' the year, we came out against Northwestern and there worn likn 20,000 poople," MiliM said. "It felt likn wn were back in high school again." 
But Zook saw potential at Illinois. lie alrnady had f~stab­lished himself' as orw of the country's hotter recruiters ­ho rocruitod most ol' Florida's national championship tPam last year -and despite his strugglns with the Gators, hn was confident he was a good eoach. lln and his staff just nnedod the right sntting, thn right players and tinw for thnir systom to take hold.

"When he played for Florida last year he had our number, so I knew hP was a good goal­temler," Savard said. "Phoenix had a lot of goalies, so their loss is our gain right now for sure."

NO SWIMMING AND DIVING 
Athletes to train in Florida 
By JARED JEDICK,

Sports Writers 
The most important part of the season is here for the men's and women's squads as the teams put in hard work that they hope will pay off down the road. 
The women get a much­needed break and are per­mitted to return home for Christmas. Irish women's assistant coach Joel White said time the swimmers spend with their families is key for establishing the men­tal and physical endurance necessary for their diff'icult upcoming training schedule. 
"The girls get to go home for seven days, the most ever," White said. "They need the rest to be ready for the remainder of a really long season that lasts until July and the Olympic trials." 
The men will get to take a break from swimming until Dec. 28. Once training resumes, the squad's intensi­ty level will pick up consider­ably. 
"We'll want to recuperate from exams, and we want everyone to be with their families for Christmas, but once we get back, we have a few weeks where we'll be training with great intensity," men's head coach Tim Welsh said. "The schedule goes straight on through the Big East Championships in February." 
Following the almost month-long break from com­petitive action, the men will

The Belles will visit Alma (3-4, 1-0) on Jan. 5 and Albion (6-1) on Jan. 9 before classes resume on Jan. 14. 
Saturday's 82-68 victory at Tri-State gave Saint Mary's its first conference win and marked the beginning of eight straight games on the road for the Belles. The team has yet to win consecutive games and has struggled with in­game consistency, especially during second halves of con­tests. 
The Belles have Jed at half­time in six of their seven games, outscoring opponents 240-178 in the opening peri­od. But the team has been outscored 246-227 following intermission. 
head to Boca Raton, Fla. to train beginning on Dec. 30. The athletes will then travel to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for their first-ever dual meet with Louisiana State on New Year's Day. The Irish will look to build on a solid showing at the Ohio State Invitational and hope to see improve­ments based on their rigor­ous training. 
The men, who are 2-3 in dual meets, will face an LSU

Henley said her squad has to display better fundamen­tals in order to reach a more consistent level of play. 
"We nend to continue to improve on our team defense and shutting down opponents in the paint, and we also need to focus on limiting our turnovers and taking away second shot opportunities from opponents," the coach said. 
Despite the Belles' early struggles, Henley is encour­aged by her team's efforts, especially the contributions of senior guard Alison Kessler 
(16.6 points, 6.0 rebounds per game), junior forward Erin Newsom (l1.6 points, MIAA­high 9. 7 rebounds) and soph­omore forward Anna Kammrath (10. 7 points, 8.1 rebounds). 
"At this point in the season, this team has shown that they can score a lot of points and that our transition game is pretty good," Henley said.

UL's Pitino still looking for SOOth career win 
second at the Georgia Tech Invitational. 
The most recent CSCAA national rankings indicate the meet should be competi­tive. LSU is ranked 21st with 92 points, while Notre Dame is only two points behind in 22nd. 
Following the holiday showdown with the Tigers, the Irish will stay in the Sunshine State and travel to Boca Raton for the Saint Andrew's Invitational on Jan. 5. 
The women, meanwhile, will head to Miami to train as soon as their break is over on Dec. 27. 
The team will follow a rig­orous schedule of training for a few days, then competing training, cardio and yoga. 
The team hopes this last push will leave it well pre­pared for the postseason. The men and women want to take this time to perfect their techniques and their tempo for the upcoming Big East finale. 
The women will return to competition in South Bend against Michigan, Indiana and Illinois on Jan. 10. The Irish hope to earn as many NCAA national championship automatic qualifications as they can.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. -Rick 
Pitino isn't much on nostalgia. 
The game ball from his first 
win as a college head coach, a 
75-71 win by Boston University 
over St. Peters as a fresh-faced 
26-year-old on Nov. 28, 1978? 
Missing. Ditto for most of the 
mementoes from Pitino's 30­
year coaching career. 
"I have no idea where most of 
them are, probably in storage 
somewhere," he said. 
That doesn't bode well for the 
ball Pitino will be handed after 
claiming his SOOth victory as a 
college head coach. His first 
shot at joining the 500-win club 
was denied Saturday, when the 
14th-ranked Cardinals lost 70­
65 to Dayton. 
His next opportunity will 
come against Purdue in the 
John Wooden Tradition next 
Saturday in Indianapolis. 
Reaching 500 wins is rarified 
air to be sure, but there's still a 
whiff of missed opportunity for 
the only coach in NCAA history 
to lead three different teams to 
the Final Four. · Pitino spent eight years 
coaching in the NBA during two 
stints with the New York Knicks 
and one with the Boston Celtics. 
If he'd been in the college ranks 
those years, adding the 23.5 
wins per season he's averaged 
in 21 years as a college coach, 
he'd be on the cusp of 700 wins 
by now. 
The number rises consider­
ably if you bump the wins per 
year to 30.8 -what Kentucky 
averaged under Pitino in the 
five years before he bolted for 
the Celtics in 1997. It was a 
heady pace that could have put 
the 55-year-old on track to sur­
pass 1,000 career victories. 
Mention to Pitino that his 
sojourns in the NBA might have 
cost him a shot at becoming 
college basketball's winningest 
coach, and he admits there 
were things he sacrificed by 
leaving the comfort of the col­
lege game. 
"From the standpoint of miss­
ing out on some golden years at 
the college level, then~'s no 
doubt I did that," he said. 
How golden? He's younger 
than almost all of the 16 active Division I coaches ahead of him in career wins, and none of them spent nearly a decade outside of the college game dur­ing their prime. 
Ask if he ever wonders what would have happened if he'd been able to resist the lure of the NBA, and he admits there are times he looks back at the brash young coach who kept one eye on the court and the other looking for the next opportunity and wishes he would have relaxed and just enjoyed what was in front of him. 
"I was so anxious to move on and prove myself both finan­cially and personally for myself and my family," he said. "I look back and I look at mistakes I've made, and the one thing I preach to everybody is learn from the past, don't live in it. Plan for the future, but don't live in it. 
"At Providence I was enjoying it. At Kentucky we had it rolling. I don't think there was a program any hotter at the time," added Pitino, who won the national title with the Wildcats in 1996 and lost to Arizona in the national champi­onship game a year later. "I wonder how long we could have kept it going." 
He'll never know. 
By '97 he had rf1stored Kentucky's reputation. But hav­ing grown up in the Northeast watching the battles between the Knicks and the Celtics, Pitino couldn't resist the oppor­tunity of trying to resurrect the NBA's most storied franchise. 
"l thought that type of situa­tion would be fun, it's what gets you going," he said. 
It ended up not going any­where. Pitino's collegiate suc­cess never fully translated to the pros, though he maintains the lessons learned with the Knicks and the Celtics made him a better coach. 
"It made me more mature, much more understanding of why you win and why you lose," Pitino said. "Although we lost and there were some rough times, l wouldn't trade the adversity."

Happy Birthday: You must move with the times but don't force change. There is money to be made if you put in the time and are willing to compromise. Fighting, being difficult to get along with, overreacting or inflating your worth will all lead to your demise. A partnership will be necessary so keep things ami­cable. Your numbers are 8, 14, 26, 28, 31,46 
ARIES (March 21-April 19): Gains are apparent if you are aggressive and follow through. Be proactive and go the distance whether it is a mental or physi­cal journey. Don't deal with personal issues or spend too much time at home today. 5 stars TAURUS (April 20-May 20): A relative or old friend will shed an interesting light on a problem you face. Love is in the stars and a change in the way you ap­proach someone will lead to a much better partnership. Restrict your spending. 5 stars GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Don't be daunted by the changes brought on by other people. By accepting what's going on, you will strengthen your own posi­tion. Someone you are in a partnership with may throw you a curve ball. Walk away or simply decline the offer. 3 stars CANCER (June 21-July 22): You will do much better if you don't get emo­tional about changes going on around you at work. Th{ less fuss made, the better off you'll be. A love interest is looking very positive. 3 stars LEO (July 23-Ang. 22): Take a step in the right direction and you will find you have plenty of followers. Strategize each move to optimize your good fortune. This isn't the time to show anger--set a positive example. 3 stars VffiGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Do a little shopping or plan to meet someone you enjoy for lunch but don't stick around home where things are likely to go wrong for you.

Be mGre patient and less of a know-it-all. 3 stars CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): You will have to keep a secret. If you share your plans with anyone, he or she will spill the beans. A different or unusual way of presenting something you can offer will probably tead to advancement for you. 3 stars AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): The help you offer others will pay big divi­dends.

Saint Mary's (3-4, 1-1 MIAAl will have to keep focused as the Belles head into a stretch that will see them play seven games between Dec. 21 and Jan. 9. That break schedule includes a pair of tournaments and three conference matchups. 
"We have a lot of basketball to play over the holiday break from classes, so main­taining our focus will be key," Belles coach Jennifer Henley said. "There are no bad teams in the MIAA, just bad records. You have to be pre­pared every night you step on the court to play, and you can never overlook an opponent." 
The Belles will play Hope College (7-0, 1-0) to open the Hope Classic in llolland. Mich., on Dec. 21. That game will count toward the MIAA standings. Saint Mary's will face either North Park (0-6) or Hanover (4-2) in the scr:­ond round of the tournament the next day. 
Saint Mary's will then trav­el to Westerville, Ohio, for

Jackson vvill not play 'patsies' during break 
By DAN MURPHY Associate Sporrs Ediror 
As the college hockey world enters its annual three-week hibernation, No. 6 Notre Dame finds itself in a very familiar position. 
At the onset of the break, the Irish (16-4) have a virtually identical record and ranking to last year's 16-3-1 team. After starting 4-3, coach Jeff Jackson has pulled together his young and talented squad to win 12 of its last 13 games against some of the country's top teams. Two of the team's four losses have come against top-five teams (a pair of 3-1 losses to No. 2 Miami and No. 4 Denver). 
"I think we started this year with a lot more questions than last year ... but once we got those answered we started to show we could be a pretty good team," Jackson said. "I think we are as far if not further ahead than we were last year." 
But the second half of the season will bring plenty of obstades for Notre Dame. Tho Irish are slated l'or two-game series with both No. 1 Miehigan and No. 5 Michigan State in January. 
Notre Dame's nnxt game will be on Dee. 29 against No. 9 Massachusetts at the Lightning College Hockey Classic in St. Petl~rsburg, Fla. II' they beat the Minutemen, the Irish will play the following night in the cham­pionship game against either No. 3 Colorado College or No. 16 Hensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 
Tho Irish won the first-ever Lightning Classic last season in late November, beating Air Force 2-0 in the final. This time around, the competition will bn much stiffer. 
"I wanted UMass and Colorado College in there because I know they are both good programs. Now that tour­nament is shaping up to be one of the best in the country," Jackson said. "I didn't want to go in and play a bunch or pat­sics." 
The third-ynar coach has played a big role in setting up the tournament and increasing the talnnt lcwol during his time at Notrn Dame. Jackson has a personal connection with mw or the members of the Tampa Bay Lightning ownership group, and the pair has worked together to
