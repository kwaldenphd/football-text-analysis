City office may forbid showing of unsafe films 
by Peter O'Brien Staff Reporter 
The Occupation, Safety and Health Administration branch office in South Bend has threat­ened to stop all showings of films in the Engineering Audi­torium according to Kathy Mal­kus, film co-ordinator for the Student Union Services Com­mission. This action will be taken unless the health and fire hazards which exist during the showings are eliminated. 
One of the only continuous social activities on the campus could end within the week, she said. 
''The Administration has the federal power to stop any activ­ity which threatens the life of any student," Malkus explained. 
In a recent letter to the University, the Administration stated their complaints, center­ing around "the smoking, litter­ing with beer cans and other disorders resulting from the lack of proper monitoring during the evening showings." 
Asks for consideration 
It is really not asking anything out of the ordinary, only that the students be considerate of other people during the film's show­ing, Malkus said. "All we want is the people to use common sense and decency," she added. 
Monitoring the students may be the answer, but the Adminis­tration may not offer that op­tion, and they cannot be blamed, Malkus stated. 
Malkus pointed out the Serv­ices Commission, which re­ceives 80 per cent of its revenue

Vote by Faculty Senate 
Appointments policy to be reviewed 
by Bob Brink Staff Reporter 
The Faculty Senate voted last night to resubmit to its Committee on Administration of the University for further consideration a proposal that would revise the current procedure for appointments of principal academic officers. 
Under the current appointment procedure, only department chair­men are appointed for specified terms. All other principal officers are appointed for indefinite terms, but are subject to review every 

five Senate subcommittee, said the GUATEMALA CITY,Guatemala AP--A tremendous earthquake jolt­ed a 2000 mile strip from Central America into Mexico before dawn Wednesday with the brunt of its force shattering Guatemala City. Wails crashed onto sleeping inhab­itants and one report said as many as 2,000 persons were killed. 
Col. Manuel Angel Ponce, the chief of staff said the figure of 2,000 dead is "conservative." He added that "alarming reports" were coming in from the interior of the country 15 hours after the .earthquake struck at 3:04a.m. local time and sent hundreds of thou­sands of Guatemala's 1.5 million pouring in panic into the streeets in pre-dawn darkness.

Calendar dates announced 
by Pat Cuneo Senior Staff Reporter 
Dean of Administration LeoCor­baci announced yesterday the se­lection of Sept. 11 as the Saturday class day providing for a 70-day academic calendar for the fall semester. 
The Saturday class day substi­tutes for the Friday after Thanks­giving, thus allowing students a four-day Thanksgiving break. The Friday sequence of classes will be transferred to Saturday. 
The 70-day calendar begins Aug. 31 with the mid-semester break scheduled for Oct. 16 through 24 and Thanksgiving break for Nov. 25 through 28. 
The last class day will be Dec. 14 with finals ending Dec. 21. 
Corbaci explained Sept. I I was selected as the Saturday class day because it did not conflict with any athletic events, especially football games. 
When Saturday classes were employed in past years, they were scheduled at the end of the semester. "It was more or less a toss-up, but we figured an earlier date would be better," Corbaci said. 
Corbaci and officials of St. Mary's College collaborated on the final draft of the fall calendar and said the spring session remains unchanged. 
No future Saturday classes 
"Saturday class days in future schedules will most likely not be necessary," Corbaci stated. 
Mike Gassman, academic com­missioner, was satisfied with the calendar on a whole. 
"For the first time, the students got the schedule they wanted. We now have two breaks and we start as late as possible and end as early as possible," he stated. 
Gassman added, ''Due to the calendar itself, the Saturday class

the students became concerned 
with an administrative policy and 
their views were heard as they 
brought about a change in the 
calendar. 

"The students wanted a calendar with two breaks, they were prop­erly informed of what was going on ·and they were consistent with the calendar they wanted," Gassman 
noted. 
He continued, "The administra­tion almost had to change the calendar to provide for a Thanks­giving break."

Visitors blamed for Fisher theft 
by Frank Tennant Staff Reporter 

The Fisher Hall burglars were not Notre Dame 
students, according to Dean of Students James 
Roemer. Roemer revealed yesterday they were 
students from an out-of-state college visiting friends 
here. 
The burglars stole over $200-worth of food and 
equipment from Fisher Hall food sales at approxi­
mately 4 a.m. Sunday. 
Roemer was contacted and informed that the stolen 
equipment was aboard a Greyhound bus headed for 
Notre Dame. A subsequent check with Greyhound 
proved the package had been sent. 
Roemer added a check to cover the remaining 
damages was also in the mail. 
''We are requiring full restitution for the damage,'' 
Roemer said. 
"After that I will contact the students to inform 
them never to come to Notre Dame again,'' he added. 
After the incident Bob Waddick, Fisher Hall 
president, stated there is a good case for bringhing 
back the hall monitors. This called into question the . effectiveness of security in residence halls. "The hall monitors basically were a fire watch with no police power," said Director of Security Arthur 
After one motion to amend the proposal was defeated, Senate member Paul Kenney motioned that the proposal be resubmitted to the Senate subcommittee. The Faculty Senate voted 18 to 10 to return the proposal for further consideration.

that 300. The quake seemed to hit hardest in the southern or old part of Guatemala City, populated mainly by pour families. The area is made up of two-and three-story masonry houses, built with no serious earthquake protection, that have been divided into apartments and makeshift huts. 
Seismological stations put the magnitude at 7.S on the Richter scale. "We would .call it a major earthquake," said a spokesman at the U.S. National Earthquake In­formation Center in Golden, Colo. "A magnitude of 8 would be a great earthquake." 
Officials said they feared many were killed as the buildings collaps­ed while the residents slept. 
Many persons wandered in a daze through the debris-choked 
Pears. With modern fire-detection equipment in the halls, Pears said, monitors were discontinued because it was not worth it to keep them. 
Although they did more than merely look for fires, Pears said, the added number of jresident . assistants in the halls along with students staying up late can do the job as effectively as the monitors. 
Pears also stated that in many cases rectors did not want monitors. 
No Increase In burglaries 
Pears pointed out there was no increase in the number of burglaries this year over the same time period last year. With the burglaries being "minimal," he sees no justification to bring back the monitors. 
"The students and resident assistants can do what the monitors did, and even better, if they want to become involved,'' he said. Pears added any rector can have a monitor simply by asking. 
Fr. Carl Ebey, rector of Fisher Hall, said, although there is no crisis stage on campus, he would like to see the monitors back . 
He added they cannot stop everything. If the monitor is in the basement, he cannot prevent something on the fourth floor, he concluded. 
Hall retains monitor 

Cavanaugh is one hall which still has a monitor. 
Mike Pavlik, president, said, "The security in our hall has been adequate." All doores, except the front, are locked at parietals and the monitor can see all that goes on. 
Pavlik stated, "the measures taken in the hall have been a great deterrent to burglaries."

A volcano south of the city was spouting smoke when dawn broke. 
There were no reports of casualt­ies in the other affected countries of Hondouras and EI Salvador, to the southeast of Guatemala, and Mexico, to the northwest. How­ever, the northern part of Hondur­as reported very heavy damage estimates. 
Guatemala government and res­cue authorities in the stricken town of 1.5 million inhabitants were trying to compile an estimate of the dead and injured but hours after the shock still had made no official report

Connally expected to receive key presidential appointment 
WASHINGTON AP Former Tre­asury Secretary John B.Connally is expected to receive a key assign­ment when President Ford an­nounces his reorganization of the 
U.S. intelligence system, White House sources said today. 
The sources said Connally, a former Texas governor, is in line for appointment to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which is expected to be strengthened as part of the admini­stration's overhaul of the nation's intelligence agencies .. 
Coleman to allow 
Concorde flights 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Secretary 
of Transportation William T. Cole­
man Jr. authorized two foreign 
airlines Wednesday to offer limited 
scheduled flights of the fast but 
noisy Concorde· supersonic passen­
ger jet into two U.S. airports for 16 
months. 

The order is effective March 4, 
but the 16-month trial period will 
not start until the first scheduled 
flight is made, probably in April. 
Coleman's order was challenged 
in court within minutes of its 
release. Several senators also said 
they planned to ask Congress to 
overturn the ruling. 

However, President Ford ex­
pressed strong support for his 
Cabinet officer and said he would 
stand behind Coleman's decision. 
Coleman's ruling would permit '

Connally served on the advisory board until his resignation as treasurer· in July, 1973. One year later, Connally was indicted by a federal grand jury and accused of taking illegal gratuities from a dairy co-operative. He was acquitt­ed of all charges in April1975. 
Ford is expected to announce details of the intelligence reorgan­zation in about 10 days. 
In other developments, the 
House Intelligence Committee is 
giving quick approval to recom­
mendations designed to give Con­
gress more control over secret spy 
operations launched in foreign 
countries. 
The panel, involved in considera­tion of a number of recommenda­tions resulting from its study of u~s. intelligence agencies, approv­ed proposals on Tuesday that would abolish the Pentagon's De­fense Intelligence Agency and re­quire intelligence agencies to let Congress see secret information. 
Proposals the committee has yet to consider include creation of a permanent intelligence committee and a requirement that all covert operations be reported to Con­gress. 
Other recommendations approv­ed by the committee would require a six-member group to advise presidents on all proposed covert operations-and require each of the six submit detailed reports to the president for or against each operation. 
The six members of the recom­mended National Security Council (NSC) subcommittee on foreign operations would include the secre­tary of state, secretary of defense and the director of the CIA. The subcommittee would replace NSC's 40 Committee. 
That recommendation stems from a finding in the still unpub­lished report that former President Richard M. Nixon directed the CIA to supply weapons to Kurdish rebels in Iraq, despite objections from Secretary of State Henry A, Kissinger, the CIA and the State Department, according to commit­tee sources.

Maura Donohue, cultural arts commissioner, defended last week­end's showing of Last Tango in Paris at Notre Dame in response to a letter criticizing the film in Monday's Observer. "Last Tango is not pornography," Donohue said. 
"Our aim is to pick out a culturally-oriented film series," Donohue pointed out. 
An X-rated film such as The Stewardesses would have no place in this series while Last Tango, although its rating is the same, is significant because of excellence in acting and direction, she explain­ed. 
She added the Cultural Arts Commission sponsors films that are important in the history of film­making, artistically produced and well directed, not because of financial success or mass popular­ity. 
Donohue expressed confidence in Scan Coleman and Laureen Goers, co-chairpersons of Cinema '76, who selected films for the series. including Last Tango. She praised their knowledge of the history and significance of films, good taste and discretion. 
Goers pointed out Bernard Bcrt­olucci, who wrote the story for and directed Last Tango, won best director award from the American Society of Film Critics for a previous tilm, The Conformist. 
"In Last Tango Bertolucci is not concerned with sexuality as por­nography," said Goers. "What he's really showing is that sex is overplayed in our culture as a solution to everything. And it isn't."

Although she and Coleman were concerned about bringing Last Tango to Notre Dame, they finally decided to do so on its artistic merits. Goers has not personally heard any unfavorable criticism of the film.

Benesh, however, expressed worries about future scheduling of controversial films. 
"I believe there should be some more specific guidelines for the kinds of movies shown," he said. "Perhaps the showing of Last Tango might spark some move to formulate guildelines.'' 
He suggested a separate com­mittee composed of students and faculty might be formed to judge controversial films if questions of propriety should arise in the future.

If these funds become non­existant, then campus-wide activi­ties such as parties, outings, free concerts and science fairs could cease to exist. 
The money from the Services Commission also keeps down the student fee. 
"Perhaps the most serious result would be no weekend movies, which are very often the only social activities for many students," she said. 
With concerts kept to a minimum this semester, movies become a ne· cessary social activity, the film co-oprdinator noted.

Dan Buckley, president of Mor­rissey, sees no major problem, only the "small number of irresponsible people in the hall." 
He said competent monitors should be hired and feels that could have helped what happened in Fisher. Buckley added the halls cannot afford to pay for them so it is up to the University. 
Waddick called tor "a re-evalua· tion of the system of monitors." He believes some type of monitors is necessary and the old type was better than nothing. 
Two televisions have been stolen from Fisher, and Waddick sugges­ted "hiring graduate students to do it and giving them more power." 
Vending machines 
Waddick said the lack of security hurts halls when they try to get vending machine games. He claimed, "The companies seem to think Notre Dame has a reputation for vandalism." 
"This rr.akes it hard for a hall to do business with them,'' he added. 
Ford Vending Co. has no mach­ines at Notre Dame this year although in previous years they the auditorium. 

This is a simple but essential request ifwe are to continue having movies, Malkus said. 
Considering there is no other place comparable to the Engineer­ing Auditorium to show films, there may not be any more movies, Malkus stressed. 
Washington Hall could not be used because there are so many bad seats there and keeping a person at each of the entrances would not be economically feasible, she pointed out.

The spokesman said most places will not let you have machines there is to be no supervision. 
Roemer said he will talk with Pears about "more effectively us­ing our present staff of Security." He does not see the Fisher incident as a justification for hiring more people. 
Roemer said, "there is no crime wave on campus." He said he is pleased with the situation this year.

Collegiate seminar class evaluated .. 
by WUUam Shaughnessy Staff Reporter 

Staffing is the major problem in the present Collegiate Seminar, according to the approximately twenty students who attended the open forum concerning the course in the lounge of the Library Auditorium yesterday afternoon. 
The forum was conducted by the committee a pointed by Isabel Char­les, acting dean of the College of Arts and Letters, to evaluate the Seminar. The committee listened to the students for over an hour. 
A major concern of the students was the lack of interest shown by 
12th Winter Olympics begin 
lNNSBRUCK (AP)  The East German teams set records in both the men's and women's luge events Wednesday and a Colorado couple grabbed hold of third place in ice dancing as the 12th Winter Olympic Games opened in this Alpine capital. 
Detlef Guenther, a 23-year-old East German technician, sped down the luge run on his back on a tiny sled in a record 52.38 seconds to edge three West German com­petitors. All must run three more times. Total times in the races which continue through Saturday decide the medalists. 
Margit Schumann of East Ger­many edged West German un­known Monika Scheftschik by a tenth of a second in a record time of 
42.85 seconds for the women's luge. The men race 1,220 meters, the women 870. 
In the first ice dancing competi­tion ever held in an Olympics, Russia's Ludmila Pakhomova and Aleksandr Gorshkov --five-time world champions and the favorites ht're -· took a strong early lead by winning the compulsory round. They took all three pattern dances easily. 
Two more rounds remain, Thursday and next Monday. 
They were followed by another Russian team, world titlists Irina Moiseeva and Andrei Minenkov. 
Making a bid for an American medal were Colleen O'Connor and Jim Millns, silver medalists at the 1975 world championships on their home rink in Colorado Springs. They were in third place, very close to second, in the intermediate standings of the competition.

Other students questioned the qualifications of their teachers. 
Student Mike Lavalle comment­ed, "Ifthe University is committed enough to this course to make it a requirement, they ought to spend the extra money to get better instructors.

The syllabus of the course was also discussed. Students pointed out the material was covered too quickly, often to the extent that the book was not given enough atten­tion. 
Tony Zipple, another student, proposed stretching the seminar over four or six semesters to insure that each book is covered in depth. Other students suggested covering fewer books during the present two semester seminar. 
Zipple also proposed grading the seminar on a pass-fail basis. Stu­dent Mark Grove felt that this would eliminate ''the student who feels obligated to spout x number of comments to receive an  A', but pa_y_s no attentton· to the _(l_Uartty of

what he is saying." 
Grove 11lso felt students should 
have more say in choosing the 
books they read. He said this would 
result in more students reading the 
books more thoroughly. 
One student also said students should be able to choose their instructors, if possible instead of being assigned arbitrarily to a particular section. 
There was, however, praise as well as criticism for the seminar. All but one student were in favor of continuing the course. 
Those in favor cited the course 
structure, the exposure to students 
outside their specialized majors, 
the acquisition of analytical skill 
and the knowledge gained about 
Western culture as benefits of the 
course. 
One student, Bruce Zerfas, countered, "I do not see what is so vital about Collegiate Seminar. The classes are usually dominated by a few students, which leads to poor discussions.'' 
"The books chosen have no value. I feel the course should be optional instead of required," he added.

Dantley excels as ND rips Explorers 
Record crowd watches A.D. bomb LaSalle with season-high 41 points in Irish's 108-89 win 
Toby Knight helped out with 13 rebounds. 
ND ski team finishes first 

by Ernie Torrlero 
In one of the best total team efforts of the season the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame downed La Salle, 108-89, before the largest throng ever to witness a collegiate basketball game in the history of Pennsylvania. 
Twelve Notre Dame players saw action in a performance highlighted by the devastating play of consen­sus All-American Adrian Dantley. Dantley scored 41 points and tied his career high of 17 rebounds before leaving the contest for the first time with just over two minutes left. 
Total team effort was the pass­word of victory as Notre Dame boasted four players in double figures. Freshman center Bruce Flowers hit for a career high 14 points while Duck William and Toby Knight netted 13 apiece. 
The Irish reeled off the first eight points of the contest before Ex­plorer guard Charlie Wise hit the first LaSalle points of the evening. "Sweet Charlie" as he is known in 
the City of Brotherly Love, was to net 26 points in a losing cause. 
With LaSalle in a man-to-man defense and 6'0" guard Daryle Charles guarding the taller Dant­ley, the Notre Dame scoring mach­ine was producing at will. Dant­ley's jumper with 8:30 left in the half gave Notre Dame a command­ing 27-12 advantage. 
It was the great height advan­tage that helped net Dantley a quick surge of points. The Wash­ington, D.C. native hit of six of his

The Notre Dame ski team cap­tured a first place finish in the combined scoring of the Detroit News Cup Race this past weekend at Alpine Valley in Michigan. The race, which was the second part,"' of a four part series hosted by the News, hosted ten men's teams and eight women's teams. 
ND captured the first place combined finish by placing first in the slalom event and third in the Giant Slalom competition. Captain Gordon Wilson finished ninth in the slalom race, jmust five-tenths of a second out of first. Freshman Pete Rowland placed 14th. In the slalom, Wilson was fourth, while Rowland was 12th and senior Chris Cannon finished 14th. 
The women's team finished fourth out of eight teams, with

first eight field goal attempts and at times single-handedly outscored the Explorers. 
The three-guard LaSalle offense, the same type of game plan which worked so well for Maryland just 
three days before, was forced to work from long range as the pressuring Irish defense forced numerous turnovers. When the teams went in for the halftime respite, the scoreboard told of a 
52-34 Irish lead. 
In the first two minutes of the second frame' LaSalle outscored Notre Dame 8-3 and cut the Irish margin to 55-42. With Dave Batton and Dantley heading the charge the Irish ran· off a string of ten unanswered points forcing LaSalle to play catch-up for the rest of the night. 
At the 14:00 minute mark, Toby Knight hit an outside jumper giving the Irish a 20 point lead, 87-67. On the very next basket, Dantley went to the hoop for a 
-driving lay-in giving him exactly 500 points on the season. The Irish reached the century mark when Bernard Rencher hit a free throw at the 2:24 left in the game. Digger Phelps substituted freely in the remaining minutes as the huge crowd of 16,297 prepared for the second game of the college extravaganza between Villanova and South Carolina. IRISH ITEMS: Dantley's 41 points gives him an even 1900 in his storied career. His 17 rebounds tied a career high set this year vs. Texas Tech and last year against

As a student here during the years of 1931-1934 Krause excelled in both football and basketball, and was named All-American in both sports. In basketball he once held the season and career scoring records for a Notre Dame player. He captained the basketball team in his senior year. 

Bernard Rencher, after seeing little action vs. Maryland Saturday saw a lot of play last night. His five-point total included the first free throw made in his collegiate career. 
Freshman Bruce Flowers tied a season high with his 14 points. Reserve senior Myron Shuckman netted five points in a less than two minute appearance for his colleg­iate career high. 
Though Wise's 26 points output was the best performance from a LaSalle guard all year long, the Explorers suffered greatly when Wise's backcourt mate Glenn Col­Iier could hit on only four of sixteen from the field. 
The Notre Dame coaching staff felt that for the Irish to win against LaSalle it was necessary for them to stop junior big man Donn Wilber from having a big day. Wilber netted 21 points, but fouled out with just over six minutes left. 
Notre Dame outrebounded the opposition for the 17th straight game. The Irish lead the country in rebound margin per game. 

The Irish hit on 40 of 83 field goal attempts. The 28 for 40 free throw percentage is the most free throws attempted and made in a game this year. Dantley was unstoppable in the Irish's drubbing of LaSalle last

Irish look to Pirus for surge 
By Tom Kruczek 
If the Notre Dame hockey team is 
to make the top four places of the 
WCHA this season and get a home 
birth for the upcoming playoffs, the 
one person who will be looked to for 
leadership on and off the ice is Alex 
Pirus. So we went to the Toronto 
native to discuss the Irish chances 
for post-season success. 
Thus far into the season, Pirus 
has netted 17 goals, and 8 assists, 
to give him a three year total of 48 
goals and 56 assists. His line is one 
of the most prolific in Irish history, 
as with Brian Walsh and Clark 
Hamilton they have combined for 
135 goals and 192 assists in not 
even three complete seasons. 
In those three years however, the 
team has not fared as well, losing 
three times in play-off action and .tying once. And this is something that Pirus and company aim to change this year. 
"We have to pull together and 
unify ourselves so we are all pulling 
together and not letting down. I 
think out chances are pretty good 
of opening at home the play-offs, 
but that means that we have to win 
some games to do that," Pirus 
said. 
The Il"ish (10-10-2 WCHA record) 
are currently tied for fifth place 
with Colorado College so all they 
need to do is move up one place 
before the end of the season and 
Notre Dame will open the play-offs 
at home. 
Coach Charles (Lefty) Smith agrees with Pirus that the Irish chances are good for a fourth place finish or better. "Looking at the rest of the schedule, you have to admit that our chances are good, because our three big series' are all at home. 
Smith was referring to the Mich­igan Tech series, Feb. 13-14, Michigan State the following week­end and then Minnesota-Duluth Feb. 27-28. Tech is the league leader and MSU is 6 points back in third place. 
Putting it into some statistical perspective, Pirus estimated that "we need to win 80-90 per cent of our games in order to finish better than fourth place and perhaps 65-75 per cent to get into fourth place. However, with games played back-to-back like we play them in the WCHA, sweeps are a tough 

thing to get and that's what we 
have to do." 

Actually, looking around the 
league, it appears that sweeps are 
a very difficult thing to get, as just 
Michigan Tech and Minnesota are 
well ahead of .500, while everyone 
else is floating right around the 
break-even mark. 

"It's hard to find the reason why we, and others have had trouble sweeping," Pirus explained. "I've been thinking about this a lot and the only thing I can think of is that there is a letdown after Friday night, especially if you win on Friday night.'' 
Pirus felt that winning is a habit-forming thing, like losing. The more you do of it in the past, the more you'll do it in the future. "I guess the way to explain it is that it's an electrifying feeling, and once you start winning a number of games, you don't worry when you fall behind, because you just know that you're going to end up on top in the end. Tech and Minnesota have it this year and it is a hard thing to get, but it takes hard work and a good winning tradition." 
However, one thing that can be noticed from statements made by both Smith and Pirus, is that they 
may be optimistic, but they are in 
the same breath, cautious. The 
combined record of the teams left to be played is 52-57; however, that record is brought down primarily by Denver and Wisconsin. The two teams who the Irish would have the easiest time sweeping because of poor records, will offer special difficulties because they will be played on the road. 
Denver is the mile-high city and Pirus pointed out that playing there gives problems because of the altitude. "You can only play 45 second shifts there, where here we play a minute and 15 second shifts usually. You get gassed up there a lot more easily." Wisconsin will be tough because the fans get riled up over hockey there, to say the least. 
The home games then will have to be the pivotal ones. The Irish will need to sweep Minnesota-Duluth and probably one other of the three and the best chance will be Michigan State. Then Notre Dame will hope to hope that the insanity that has infected the WCHA will continue and teams suddenly don't get hot.
