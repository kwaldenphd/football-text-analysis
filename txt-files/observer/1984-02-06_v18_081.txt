In Brief 
Purposeful dumpingofhazardous waste is viewed hy most Americans as a worse act than some homicides, the justice lkpartment said yesterday. Reporting on the largest survey of at­titudes towards crime to date, the department's Bureau of justice Statistics said public attitudes are more consistent than might be assumed from the disparity ofcriminal sentences around the nation. The survt."y, based on questions asked of60,000 people over age 17 in 1977, could be a first step in establishing uniform sentencing guidelines for judges and juries. The bureau said that the public ranked so-called victimless crimes, such as personal use of small amounts ofdrugs, among the least serious ofoffenses. But the agency said that most people consider bombings, corporate fraud, nmmmm mental pollution, and official corruption to be major offenses. The most serious offense, receiving a 72.I score, was a bombing of a public building in which 20 people are killed. The least serious of­fenSt.", receiving a 0.2 score, was a person under I6 playing hooky from school. The numerical ratings were mathematicall t y weighted so that a crime considered twice as serious as another would receive a rating double the other crime's rating. -AP

No hang-ups with SMC phone system 
Ma Bell hasn't rung the Belles of Saint Mary's telephones since the summer of I982 and although there are still some problems with the billing system there are few complaints. Recent gripes concerning Notre Dame's new phone system, Infonet, raised ques­tions about Saint Mary's system, ROLM. 
The old system, Centrex, which went through the now divested Bell system was just that, old and outdated; it was installed in the late 1960s. Problems with transmitting calls and computer data prompted the change along with the escalating cost to maintain the system. Ma Bell was getting greedy in her old age. During the past three years prior to the switch to ROLM, Bell exacted more than 20 percent price in­creases a year, but at the same time quality of service declined. Bell was using salvaged parts for repairs and according to Controller jason Lindower, prices should have declined because the equipment was fully depreciated and services were deteriorating.

call happened to be long distance, it had the effect of putting the call on hold, which resulted in outrageously high hills for 200-minute calls which never lasted that long. 
The College is the bill collector with the new system. Students no longer get bills from Indiana Bell (with the exception offoreign calls, priority calls and collect calls accepted hy students). A W A TIS line is used for long distance calls and the rates are based on Bell's rates less IO percent. The College didn't get the lowest possible

continued soon after the system was installed be­cause of problems with the hilling system's software. Until this academic year the features could only be used when dialing off-campus. Beginning last fall the con­ference call was reinstated and all features can be used when dialing on and off-campus numbers. Many stu­dents are not aware ofthe on-campus addition. 
Students were sent instructions on how to use the features when the system was installed and again last fall. Administrative Assistant for Communications Pauline Podlesak has offered training St."ssions in in­dividual halls to get students feeling confident about using the features. While only the hall directors at­tended, the effort has been made to inform students. That's a step ahead of Notre Dame students who were left guessing how to dial long distance. 
Like lnfonet, ROLM was not without its kinks. The obvious annoyance was phantom phone calls (phone ring hack resulting from not depressing the switchhook long enough between calls). Moreover, if the pr~vious same time it takes Notre

The Observer Nation of Islam leader campaigns for Jackson 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -In the Rev. Jesse jackson's moment of glory -a welcome home after his Syrian tri­umph -a chant rippling through the crowd called for another man. "Speak, Farrakhan. Speak." 
The man answering the call was Minister Louis Farrakhan, a spellbinding orator. His presence was a sign that jackson again had done something other politicians could not. 
Farrakhan is the leader of the Na­tion oflslam, an offshoot ofthe Black Muslim separatist group once led by Elijah Muhammad, who rejected the American political system and tradi­tionally regarded the white man as 
the "devil." 
Under Elijah Muhammad, "Politics was just a game among white folks. A black man had nothing to gain," says C. Eric lincoln, profes­sor of religion and culture at Duke University and author of"The Black Muslims In America." 
Yet how, Farrakhan, who scholars say copsiders himselfElijah Muham­mad's only true apostle, has im­mersed himselfin a campaign for the nation's highest office. 
Farrakhan, 50, says he will accom­pany jackson to City Hall on Thursday to register to vote for the first time in his life and bring hundreds ofothers with him. 
That even surprises him. "If you had told me just a few years ago that I would be participating with Reverend jackson in a presidential campaign, I probably would have thought you were a litde off," he said in one of the first interviews he has given in seven years. 
Farrakhan says he and other Mus­lims will help  jackson's voter registration drive by signing up to vote and "encouraging black people who felt locked out of the political process to do likewise." 
Tho~gh it is a cam_i)aign for a black man, Muslim scholars say it still is unprecedented for the Nation of Is­lam and Farrakhan. a protege ofMal· colm X who took over the slain minister's New York mosque after his death in 1965. 
But Farrakhan says his support of jackson's campaign is consistent with Elijah Muhammad's teachings. 
Elijah Muhammad, he explained, said "Ifwe have a black person who is standing up for justice and is not afraid to fight for the best interests of our people, we should give him the total backing and support of our people." 
In Jackson's candidacy, he says, "You see a person who is not only good for black people ...but ul­timately good for America." 
In recent months, Farrakhan also has proclaimed a willingness to work with othergroups -including whites -for social and political change. 
"There can be no more sidelines today," Farrakhan said at a Washing­ton rally withJackson. "We watched Dr. Martin Luther King march frmm Selma to Montgomery. The majority were on the sidelines." 
Farrakhan has accompanied Jack­son on the campaign trail in Wash­ington, Chicago and Detroit.Jackson aides consider him a surrogate for Jackson at rallies. Muslim bodyguards have supplemented Secret Service security in some cities. 
"God has opened my heart to my brother," Farrakhan said in Washing­ton. "I refuse to let Reverend Jesse Jackson to go down into the Valley ofthe Shadow ofDeath by himself." 
Some speculate Farrakhan, who journeyed with Jackson to Syria, may have been instrumental in the negotiations that capped the high­light of Jackson's candidacy -the release of captured U.S. airman Robert Goodman.

Entire Lebanese Cabinet resigns 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon -Prime Minis­ter Shafik Wazzan and his eight-man Cabinet resigned yesterday, and President Amin Gemayel said he might scrap the May I 7 troop withdrawal agreement with Israel as demanded by his opponents. 
Wazzan, a Sunni Moslem, said he was stepping down to allow forma­tion of a national coalition govern­ment that might help end Lebanon's factional bloodshed. 
After accepting the resignations, Gemayel, a Maronite Christian, called for a cease-fire and said he was inviting Lebanon's warring Moslem and Christian factions to Geneva for reconciliation talks Feb. 27. 
"The agreement (with Israel) has put us in an embarrassing impasse that led me to refrain from ratifying it," Gemayel said in a speech broad­cast on nationwide television. "I see it necessary to continue all efforts to find a formula that would guarantee the complete withdrawals (of foreign troops) from all Lebanese territories to safeguard Lebanon's in­dependence and sovreignty." 
A few minutes after his 15-minute speech, artillery shells and rockets could be heard crashing into Beirut's embattled southern sub­urbs. 
Earlier, Shiite Moslem militiamen seized control ofmuch ofthe road to the Beirut airport, where U.S. Marines are based, leaving the

The history of second presidential terms 
With Ronald Reagan riding high and raising all the excitement, let's talk ofsecond terms. 
They have been less frequent than we think. My memories as a young history student start with Woodrow Wilson, the first consecutive two-time president since Ulysses Grant. 
A college professor turned politician, Wit-

son was the liberal intellectual's hero. He hetd p<:ople by the spell ofhis words and ideas. He was litnate, eloquent, brilliant, vain and cer­tain that he possessed a pipeline to the AI· mighty. f-lis first term wao; crowded with historic legislation, and he fought a little war in Mexico. 
lie wao; re-elected in 1916 on a pledge to stay out ofthe war in Europe. He didn't. Allied armies beat back the Germans in a bloody futile war and Wilson dominated the peace. He carried his fight for the League of Nations to the people in a heartbreaking speaking campaign, was felled by a stroke and ended his term a paralyzed old man sitting in a wheel· chair. 
Franklin Roosevelt, elected in 1932, electrified the nation and world with his New Deal, and ran for a second term in 1936, on the issue of extending what he had built. He won handily over Alf Landon. 
His second term was more radical than his ftrst but he overreached when he tried to purge his party ofSouthern conservatives and pack the Supreme Court. The New Deal fal­tered, but FDR was rescued by the second World War which meant a war-readiness economy in America which gave the un­employed jobs again. 
Dwight Eisenhower's first term was a success, and in 1956 the war hero won for a 
second time over Adlai Stevenson who was a 
retread of Wilson. But his second term was 
trouble-filled as the nation moved toward the 
domestic tensions of the '60s and the misad­
ventures of the U-2 spy plane, the Paris sum­
mit and the Cuban revolution. 
After a first term in which he wound down the Vietnam war and established a detente with Peking and Moscow, Richard Nixon in 1972 rode a wave of triumph over a bumbling George McGovern. 
But even before· his victory he had set the fuse at Watergate which exploded his second term and forced him -after tortured writh­ing~ -into resigning. 
These have been the four second-term vic­tories in our time, after a full first term. What lessons, if any, do they carry for Ronald Reagan's prospects? 
Note that three ofthe four were charismatic -two as liberal reformers (Wilson and FDR) and one (Ike) as a war hero. Nixon was none ofthese but had a brilliant political mind and a driving will. Reagan belongs to the charis­matic group. 

Note also that both Wilson and FOR came to their second terms as leaders of a political revolution. So does··Reagan, a revolution-in­reverse against the ce~ralized welfare state of Roosevelt. 
Note Finally the use ofthe peacemaker role. Wilson's slogan in 19 I 6 wa~ "He kept us out of war' -and he plunged into one when reelected. FOR's second run.came before the Great War, but this third run -1940 ­against Wendell Willkie, repeated the Wilson slogan. Ike was in bet brilliantly effective in ending the Korean war and avoiding any others. And Nixon, although he inherited the Vietnam war, won in l972'for a peacemaker role with China 
Is there any doubt what Reagan's foreign policy slogan will be to match the one on the return ofthe economy.

Should Catholic laypeople wear Roman collars?: 
Should priests wear Roman collars? 

A re<:ent issue of U.S. Catholic includes a column, a survey and several letters on the question. 
The column, written by Dan Herr, favors the Roman collar. He argues that "too often

fanatics, in search of the trendy, push reform 
to the ridiculous. In other words, everything 
n<·w and untried is not necessarily good; and everything traditional is not necessarily ob­solete." 
lie thinks it is hard to distinguish a priest from a layperson these days. For the most part prksts "don't want to b<· bothned" by the symhollic dress -choosing to remain anonymous txcept when in the church or rec­tory "wh<·re they seem content to be as cleri­cal as ever." 
He also notes that clerics are practical, since priests "have about as much clothes sense as an iguana ... priests in mufti and ex­priests stand out like neon signs because of their outlandish clothes: a pink seer-sucker suit, blue walking shorts on beefy theighs parading down a busy city street, hand­painted ties, combinations of shirts and ties and suits that might have given Salvador Dati pause." 
The article's inconsistency should have struck even the casual reader. On the one hand Herr thinks priests should be more visabk, though on the other, he complains that priests stick out in public because ofpoor dress. 
Perhaps the best comment came from a reader who wrote, "I think Dan Herr is worry­ing about the wrong thing. What about the Catholic layperson who neatly conceals the fact that he or she is Catholic? ... It is vital that we become very real signs of the presence of Christ in our everyday life."

Alcohol pacifier 
DearEditor: 
Frank Leyes' lctt<·r of Fo::b. 2 "Alcohol over­kill" compares th<· prohibition of alcohol to tht· taking away of a baby's pacifier. He claims that once th<· "crying stage" is over the "child's horizons expand and he sees a wide opt·n world of possibilitil·s of which the pacifier is an exaggt·rated part." 
I find two major errors in this analogy. First, he contradicts his statement about the quality of Notre Dame students by comparing them to short sighted infants. Ifstudents are, in fact, "p<:oplt-of outstanding <:haracter," should th<·y not he entitled to make their own d<·ci­sion concerning akohol? 
Also, alcohol is not, as the pacifier, an exag· g<·rated part of the real world. Alcohol is a very intt·gral part of American society. From the three martini lunches to the wedding ren·ptions, alcohol is pr<·st·nt, acceptable and virtually unavoidable. College hao; always lx:en th<· place where children can grow into adults and It-am to function in an adult world. Why tht·n should the students not becom<" cd· ucatnl in drinking as wdl ao; math and English? 
The University claims to want responsible drinking but they threaten to rob us of the chance to learn to be responsible. Who can say that they've always done everything right the first time? 
As a junior, I can see marked differences in the way my friends and I drink now as opposed to the way we did as freshman. Sure there is some abuse on campus but that is primarily the 'uneducated' lowerclassmen. Is it not better to learn to deal with alcohol in college where a blunder is inconsequential rather than being pushed into an alcohol­ridden society unprepared and irresponsible? 
Rather than comparing students to children 
with pacifiers why not compare them to kids 
with bikes. Shouldn't we be allowed to fall 
down in the grao;s or on the sidewalk a few 
times than just being thrown into the street 
and told to go!

the Church is the People of God, not just the hierarchy. 
And so, in the interests of satisfying tradi­tional and modem Roman Catholics, perhaps laypeople should start wearing the clerical garb so priests won't have to. 
Yes, it might sound a bit absurd. But fashion designers can convince people that anything is stylish, given the chance. 
Such a scheme might cause a few headaches. Though Catholic laypeople would stand out, priests would be indistinguishable from, say, Protestants. But many conservative Catholics think there is little difference these days anyhow. 
Imagine, millions of Catholic laypeople wearing ~oman collars. It would be hard to walk dov. .1 a city street without running into someone with a magical black suit. 
Many U.S. Catholic readers seemed to think the ge-up carries with it some mystical powers. A reader from Minnesota says, "Just the sight of a Roman'collar can fill me with a deep sense of peace and well-being knowing that God is still present in our world." 

A writer from Texao; says, "I have always admired priests in clerical clothes and nuns in habits. It gives them much more dignity." 
And one writer from New York says she "just can't feel the respect for a priest who does not dress like a priest." 
If the outfit does have some magical power, why not have laypeople wear it? Ifit is merely a symbol, why do so few understand what it represents. How many Catholic laypeople have any idea why the suit is black and what the symbolism ofthe collar is? 
On the whole, 63 percent ofthe reader sur­veyed by U.S. Catholic agree that priests s~ould wear Roman collars. Bul at leao;t a few disagree. 
Eugenic Malinowski from Connecticut ao;ks, "Why in the wmld is it necessary to be able to point out a priest by his uniform?" 
To paraphrase her words, will they know we are Christians by our suits and collars or by our love?

Sir Obnoxious 

Love those lines! 
by Marc Ramirez 

features staff writer 

S
ir o_bnoxious is having difficulty understandingwhat people have agamst these frequent occurrences. Beauty, they say, is in the eye of the beholder, and when Sir Obnoxious beholds these supposed hassles, they become objects ofloveliness when seen in the right perspective. In fact, when it comes right down to it, Sir Obnoxious can honestly say that he loves lines. 
Yes, my dears, lines, the ones you find yourselves in at the wrong 
times at lunch and dinner, and the ones you get into ifyou want foot­
ball tickets, and the ones you encountered when you got BillyJoel 
tickets. Those lines. 
While exclamations of"Ooh, I hate lines!" and "Who organizes these things, anyway? I'd like to kill him" pass back and forth among the crowd, Sir Obnoxious merely stands back, takes it all in, and grins. For again, it is the classic case ofa situation not being seen in the right light, and again we have a blessing disguised as a curse. If the things people got upset about were only seen in the correct perspective, everything would be a lot easier for evetyone, includ­ing Sir Obnoxious. Those exclamations Sir Obnoxious has been hearing should be "Ooh, ain't this great?" and "Who organizes these things, anyway? I'd like to shake his hand and buy him a drink." 
Observe, my friends, and see what an opportunity for obnoxious­ness a simple line is ...and the longer the better. SirObnoxiouscan­not describe the chill which swims up his spine when he sees a chance to get in a line. Remember -lack ofmanners is the object here, and one must derive pleasure from such.lfifone doesn't, then one has no business reading Sir Obnoxious' column. 
Get in line with a smile (and here Sir Obnoxious has in mind the lunch crowds at the dining halls), and liven up the boredom by start­ing a pleasant conversation. Sir Obnoxious has found that these quips are often a great way to get people talking: 
"Hey, I heard some Food Inspection guys are here checking on today's hamburgers." 
"Did you see Dean Roemer on 'People's Court?"' 
"Ha ha! My docltOr told me I have Bubonic Plague! What does he know? Ha ha!" "Has anyone seen my pet scorpion Gus?" Unfortunately some people do not take well to this type ofcon· 
versation, and should you find yourselfbeing banished to another line, try something different. Take advantage ofdense crowds, the kind which pack you in so tight that you find it difficult to move or 
breathe. The BillyJoel lottery crowds, for instance. 
Step on people's shoes; reach around someone and poke them in the ribs or somewhere befitting to your imagination and individual nerve; breathe down people's necks with a sinister glimmer in your eye and tell them you have a fetish for throat skin -the time passes so much faster when you do more than stand and wait. For bolder veterans ofrudeness, try eatingfour orfive bowls ofdining hall chili before getting in a long line. You may be surprised at the results. 
A truly obnoxious person is never squeamish, and will stop at no­thing to achieve the results he wants. One tactical measure which Sir Obnoxious has always enjoyed has been "back cuts," a wonderful way to annoy someone whose guts you despise. Back cuts are amazingly simple, and consist ofsniffing out your arch rival, picking out the person directly in front ofhim or her, and asking for cuts in line on the condition that you will give cuts back to that person. What it all amounts to is getting cuts in line from your arch rival, of course. 
Patience may be a virtue (and that phrase sounds disgustingly like something Miss Manners would say), but lines are no place for such trivialities. Sir Obnoxious advocates, endorses, even signs his name to the appreciation ofoffensiveness, and hopes to alert grumpy souls to the endless possibilities available while waiting in line (or if you're British orone ofthat crowd, a queue). When handled proper­ly, any line can be: a fine line. 
DearSir Obnoxious: the other night I went to see Gary Larson at the Library Auditorium, and since I really like The Far Side, I made sure to get there by 7:00 (the lecture was scheduled for. B). Well, my friends and I grabbed four seats right in front, and at about 7:40, when the Auditorium was packed, two guys came and told us we were going to have to leave ,mr seats because they were reserved for the Student Union. Well, I got pretty upset because there hadn't been any signs or anything, and I thought it waspretty rude for them to tell us that. As it turned out they sat on the stage instead, and by the time we noticed that, some other people had come and sat in our seats. Tell me ifyou think they were rude-you're the expert. 
Signed, Sitting on the Far Side 
Dear Far Side: Boy, I've gotta hand it to that Student Union. If there's been any one entity which has followed Sir Obnoxious' advice as gospel, it's been them. Yes, to answer your question, they were rude, and darn good at it too. And where do you suppose our Student Government leaders sat during the lecture? One can only speculate. However, they have adhered faithfully to my advice as well, so Sir Obnoxious envisions them somewhere in front, possibly on the stage. Be proud ofyour Student l.hion-Sir Obnoxious is. Don't forget that they also handled the BillyJoel lottery, with all those wonderful lines (see above).

A
fter seeing "S"IIkwood," 20th Century Fox's Dec. release, it has become clear that there may be a problem with thisfilm. The problem would not be with the movie itself, but with the expectations ofthe movie-goer, who may see this film under the wrong pretenses. 
"Silkwood" is based on the per­sonal and professional struggles of Karen Silkwood, who dared to point out the lack ofadequate safety measures and quality controls in a plutonium-recycling plant where she worked. She took an active role in her union's effort to correct these defects, and subsequently began to sufferfrom high levels ofradioactive contamination. She died in a mys­terious car crash in 1974 while on her way to show documented evidence ofher plant's wrong­doings to a New York Times repor­ter. It is speculated that she might have been run offthe road. The facility she worked at was owned by a large corporaton, Kerr-McGee, working over-budget and quite un­successfully on a United States Government contract. 
From this, many viewers may ex­pect an action-oriented, "thriller" film. Yet,"Silkwood" is a biographi­cal film, which follows a much slower pace than what its advertise­ments may suggest. "Silkwood" is impartial concerning the cir­cumstances surrounding Karen's death and does not attempt to raise controversy, something it could 
In the limelight 
have used to attract viewers. In­stead, it avoids becoming a propaganda film. "Silkwood" has no surprises, and no twist at the end to 
make to make this movie memorable. It just relies upon solid 
performances from the cast. 
The real purpose of"Silkwood" goes much deeper than just to show the life and death ofKaren Silkwood. It tells us ofthe small deaths that workers die every day by com­promising themselves just to keep their jobs to survive. It shows the frustrations (and often futility) of people standing up for their rights. 
Meryl Streep (Sophie's Choice) stars as Karen Silkwood Her acting is ofher usual Academy Award caliber and she will most like­ly receive another Oscar nomina· tion for this performance. She gives vivacity and depth to her character, and this coupled with similarities in her appearance to pictures ofKaren taken at that time, make her ideal for this role. 
The supportingcast includes Kurt Russell as Drew Stephens and Cher as Dolly Pelliker. Russell, who has long left the Walt Disney studios, demonstrates his ability as a serious actor in this role. The film displays Russell's highquality, naturalistic ac­ting that was not captured in his last work withjohn Carpenter (Escape From NewYork, The Thing). Russell plays the role ofKaren Silkwood's lover and friend. Cher, of"Sonny and Cher" fame, has her first major studio film role as Karen's closest· friend.and roommate, Dolly. Her fme performance here should estab­lish her as a high quality actress. Cher should be a front-runner for the Best Supporting Actress category in the Oscars. 

Mike Nichols(The Graduate) returns to filmmaking as director and co-producer of"Silkwood" after eight years ofstage activity. His work is commendable, both in set­ting the mood and portraying the fear ofbeing contaminated and the pain ofthe harsh scrubbings ofthe exposed workers. 
"Silkwood," without question, is high quality cinema. The ftlm's only major fault is that ofmany Hol­lywood biographical films: it makes Karen Silkwood seem more heroic and in control than she probably was. It is doubtful that her intentions were as honorable and unselfish as they were portrayed. At times, the backround music of"Amazing Grace" seems overdone. Karen's high level ofradioactive contamina­tion was never proven to be caused by a company member. There is a possibility that it was self-induced. Also,the night ofher crash, the autopsy showed a high level oftran­quilizers in her system. 
Most ofall, it is important to remember the thrust of"Silkwood;" that forwqatever the circumstances, Karen Silkwood, like many other workers, give up part oftheirdignity and pride just to survive. "Silkwood" ·is well worth the price ofadmission and I highly recommend seeing it. 
Say goodbye to Walnut Grove 
T
onight at 9 the village ofWalnut Grove will disappear in a blast of smoke and fire, on NBC-TV's special two-hour "Little House," enti tied "little House: The Last Farewell." The show can be seen in South Bend on Channel 16. 
Michael Landon, who has not only starred as CharlesIngallsfor the past decade, but has served as the show's executive producer and main writer, admits that there was a lot of sadness involved when he wrote the script which calls f0r the destruc­tion ofWalnut Grove. 
"There was one main reason I decided to blow the town up," he says. "We leased this land (green farm country, 40 miles from Hol­lywood) and built every house, office, church and hut used in the show .There was nothing here when we started. 
"We were notified that when the lease was up we had to return the property to the same condition that we received it -in other words, all those buildings had to be removed. 
"I decided to 'Yrite a script where the town would go out in a blaze of glory."

in the game, netted seven of nine 
free-throw attempts in the last two 
minutes, earning him Coach Foster's 
praise. 
"Michad Foster has a lot of poise for a freshman," the Gamecock coach said after the game. "He played very intelligently. Tht: free throws that he made were very im­portant." 
Jimmy Foster led the team with 19 
points. Foster, a senior who had 
never before beaten Notre Dame, 
said afterward that it is a great 
feeling to beat the Irish. 
"It was an emotional game for me," he said. "They shut me down last year -they gave me my season­low five points -so I was really excited." 
The Gamecocks shot eight for I 5 (53 percent) in the second half, while the Irish hit only seven of 20 (35 percent) in the period. Carolina outrebounded Notre Dame, 33·23, in the game. 
The leading scorer for the Irish was Sluby, with I 3, while Kempton had 11. 
"I thought two things that were factors," Phelps continued,"were their offensive rebounding and the fact that we ended up shooting 41 percent for the game." 
South Carolina Coach Bill Foster added his impressions of the game. 
"They (the Irish) did a great job defensively," Foster said. "We could not get into our offense. We couldn't get into anything. Fortunately, our defense bailed us out at the other end." 
The Irish, now 14-6, will play host tonight to Vermont at the Athletic and Convocation Center at 8 p.m.

Sports Writer 
The fact that the Saint Mary's bas­ketball team lost both games at the Hanover College Basketball Tourna­ment was not the most upsetting part of their weekend performance. What was most upsetting was just how they went about the losing. 
For instance, Friday night's 75-70 loss to the Mountaineers of Berea College. While the score may seem innocent enough, consider that with only seven minutes remaining in the contest, the Belles held a com­fortable 68-55 advantage. 
Berea then took advantage of tur­novers and cold shooting, outscored Saint Mary's 20-2, and walked away with the victory. 
"I just can't understand what hap­pened in those final minutes", said a frustrated Mike Rouse, head coach for the Belles. "We tightened up, 
Hockey

Some sloppy play plagued Notre Dame both offensively and defensively in the second period. 
"We weren't playingour positions and we weren't moving the puck well," said head coach Lefty Smith. 
But quickly in the third period the Irish regrouped, got theiract togeth­er and jumped to a 6-2lead with two goals before the five-minute mark. 
Chapman and Reilly did the honors as each netted his second goal ofthe night. 
The crowd kept the Warriors motivated, however, as they came right back to draw within two at 6-4, capitalizing on shots by O'Grady and Garry Handelman before the mid­way point ofthe period. 
Unfortunately for the Warriors, the Notre Dame defense tightened and the offense added three more goals. Steve Whitmore, Mark Ben­ning, andJeffBadalich turned on the red light the final three times. 
"Their crowd was very effective for them tonight," said Parsons.

firsts in the 500-yd. free and 200-yd. 
I.M. while breaking the varsity record in the 200-yd. butterfly (in national qualifying time). She also helped teammates Margaret Man­nion, Byrne, and Whalen in their 200-yd. medley relay victory. 
Byrne, a junior, freestyled her way to two fU'sts, a second, and a third­place finish in four events. The firsts came in the two relay events, while the second and third-place finishes couldn't hit anything, and just lost all concentration." 
Saint Mary's played sound basket­ball for most ofthe game. The Belles pulled down 44 rebounds, including 13 by Betsy Ebert, I I by Elaine Suess, and 9 by Kris Pantelleria. 
The team even outscored the Mountaineers in field goals. Free throws made the difference however, as Saint Mary's managed only four of nine while Berea was putting in 21 of3 5 shots. 
"Our tendency to foul cost us the victory", said Rouse. "They went to the line four times as many times as we did." 
Pantelleria captured scoring honors with I5 points, while Suess put in I3 points, Ebert I2 points, and Lori White and Cyndy Short IO points. 
Saturday's 52-45loss to the Rebels of Thomas Moore College was remarkably similar to the previous game. The Belles were down 26-27 at the half, but with six minutes remaining fought back to take the 
"They got some quick goals and at times we seemed to let down. We just managed to outplay them when we needed to." 
Guay had 25 saves in earning the victory. Maziarek from Marquette made 43 in the losing cause. 
After a buffet dinner and recep­tion sponsored by the Notre Dame club of Milwaukee and an early morning arrival back at Notre Dame, the team came out Saturday just as eager to play in that night's contest. 
Instead, Saturday's game turned out to be no contest at all. The Irish quickly jumped to 4-I lead in the first period as four separate players scored for the icers. Parsons, Badalich, Reilly, and Dave Waldbillig all capitalized on the Warriors' inef­ficiency. 
John Hough tallied the lone Mar­quette goal at the 16:25 mark. 
Second peri od.scoring was very similiar to the first. The Irish again led in a 4-I trouncing of the War­riors, upping their lead to 8-2. Bowie, Parsons, Ely, and Whitmore sent the four pucks flying into the Marquette goal. 
Handelman was able to slip one by Tim Lukenda late in the second 
came in her specialties -the 100 and 50-yd. freestyle events. 
These four standouts were aided by a strong underclassmen bench which included Mannion, a fresh­man who placed second and third in the I00 and 200-yd. breaststroke and teammate Murtagh who also came in second and third in her specialty events-the 200 and 100­yd. freestyle events. 
Another freshman standout Kath­leen Kennedy showed her colors as she captured the 100-yd. butterfly in national qualifying time and grabbed a third in the grueling 200-yd. fly. During the meet three other team

lead at 43-35. Then fate struck again, 
as the Rebels outscored the Belles 
17-2 in the final minutes to win the 
game. 
"We just lost our confidence in ·this one", said Rouse. "We couldn't 
shoot, we ran into foul trouble, and 
in the end, we were turning over the 
ball like I couldn't believe." 
The team shot a dismal 18 of 62 from the field for 29 percent, and Ebert was held scoreless and pulled down just three rebounds. The game was won at the line again, as the Belles converted just nine of 14 shots while the Rebels put in 24-32. Pantelleria again led the Belles with 14 points, while Suess and Teresa McGinnis had IO points. 
Saint Mary's travels to St. Francis 
College in Fort Wayne tonight, to 
make up a game that was cancelled 
last week due to weather conditions. 
The Belles are sitting at 4-I2 on the 
season, and hope to avert the jinx of

test. 
period for the Warriors second and final goal ofthe evening. 
The third period saw the Irish hit for three more goals, all power plays. Bowie and Thebeau both used powerful shots early in the period to beat Maziarek. 
Parsons completed the hatrick at 
18:00 of the third period. He rounded out the evening's scoringas Notre Dame achieved its II-2 vic­tory. 
Lukenda needed just 18 saves to record the win while Maziarek had 45 in taking the loss. 
"We moved the puck extremely well tonight," said Smith. "We just had too much ability, skating power, and depth. And as a result, the games were not as exciting as we would have liked." 
The Notre Dame power play was four for six on the weekend. The Warriors were zero for nine. 
The Notre Dame string of con­~cutive home victories now stands at ten. 
The Irish will seek to avenge their lone defeat thus far this season on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at the ACC when they take on Lake Forest. The Foresters defeated 'the Irish 9-6 on January 25. 
members compiled a total of six third-place finishes and a stack of well-needed Belle points. 
Patty Juckniess grabbed two thirds in the I00 and 200-yd. back­stroke events, while Jean Wiegand copped two more thirds in the 100 and 200-yd. I.M.'s. Julie Gschwind added the last two thirds in her specialties -the 200 and 500-yd. freestyles. 
A pleased Coach Trees said, "Given the fact that we are un­tapered, this has been the best meet for us in two years." And it's no won­der. Overall, the Belles turned in some of their best times of the season as they smashed another four varsity records -leaving only three "pre-Trees era" records yet to be broken and qualifying more of their swimmers for national competition in March. 
Before the team looks toward the national meet, they have one more opponent to look forward to -tom­morrow at the Knute Rockne natatorium -as the Belles clash with the Fighting Irish women in their last dual meet ofthe season. 
Coming off a three-meet winning streak, the women should be able to make the annual rivalry against the Irish nothing less than interesting. If things go as well as they have been for the team, the Belles should im­prove their times even more in preparation for national competi­tion and attempt to take some of the fight out ofthe Irish .

College basketball roundup 
St. John's loses in overtime again 
Associated Pre!ill 
The overtime period has become the Twilight Zone for the St. John's basketball team this season. 
Playing their third overtime game in two weeks, and their fourth over­all, the Redmen lost 59-57 to second-ranked DePaul Saturday. In overtime games, luckless St.John's is 0-4. 
In a 12· 7 season, the Redmen have made a habit of down-to-the-wire finishes. They have been in conten­tion in every game this season ex­cept for two big losses to North Carolina and Georgetown. 
In other Top T<.:n games, top­ranked North Carolina routed The Citadel 76-60; third-ranked Ken­tucky was upset 69-62 by Alabama; fourth-ranked Georgetown rolled past Connecticut 87-62; fifth-ranked Nevada-Las Vegas beat Long Beach State 79-65; sixth-ranked Houston hammered SMll 76-57; seventh­ranked Texas-EI Paso beat Brigham Young 85-77; No. 8lllinois trimmed Northwestern 71-52; No. 9 Memphis State edged Alabama­Birmingham 53-51 in overtime, and 
lOth-ranked Maryland was beaten by No. 18 Georgia Tech 71-70 in two overtimes.

low all should be able to have their way against the smaller opponents. In fact, when asked how the Catamounts match up against the Irish, Whitmore replied, "We probably don't. Their inside, overall strength is tough. I think they'll be able to overpower us." Swingman Tom Sluby, leading the Irish with 
16.3 ppg, and point guardJoJo Buc­hanan will also play important roles. 
All the Irish will have to improve on their performan<.:es in Saturday night's game at South Carolina. Field goal and free-throw shooting will both have to improve if the Irish are to improve on their 14-6 record. 
In the only other meeting be­
tween Vermont and Notre Dame 
during the 1976-77 season, the Irish 
took home an easy win, 89-48. Asked 
why he was willing to take on the 
bigger and more talented Notre 
Dame squad this year, Whitmore 
knew his reasons. "We wanted to 
make money. Really, though, it's a 
good way to get some recruiting ex­
posure." 
All signs point to an overpowering win for the Irish. with no one from Vermont even expecting a chance for victory. But stranger things have happened, and if there is no im­provement on the part ofthe Irish, it could turn out to be closer than ex­pected.
