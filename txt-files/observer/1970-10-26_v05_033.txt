Goodell holds firm on Senate bid; battles against Agnew and polls 
Senator Charles Goodell speaking at Notre Dame last year. 
NEW YORK (UPI) Sen. Charles E. Goodel,(R-N.Y.), re­pudiated by Vice President Spiro 
T. Agnew and running behind in the polls, said last night that he will remain in the New York Senate race and will not let any­one run him out of the Repub­lican Party. 
"I have stood for election to the U.S. Senate and I shall con­tinue to stand for election to the 
U.S. Senate~'' Goodell said in a televised speech. "I think I can win." 
Goodell said earlier in the day his television address would be "extremely important," setting 
Problems in coeducation discussed at St. Mary's 
By Ann Conway 
Speaking to an SRO crowd in Carroll Hall Friday afternoon, Student Body President Ann Marie Tracey and Academic Affairs Commissioner Carol Hen­ninger sought student opinion on the future direction of St. Mary's College, especially in re­gard to coeducation with the University of Notre Dame. 
Coming on the heels of a leak­ed report last week that Notre Dame would go coed indepen­dently of St. Mary's, student opinion was heavily in support of a move toward coeducation. According to Miss Tracey, "we can't keep going the way we are now." If Notre Dame were to go 
coeducational independently of St. 
Mary's, there would be a definite 
effect both on the number of ad­
missions and the quality of stu­
dent. 
Discussion centered around 
the work of the coeducation re­
searchers, Dr. Rosemary Park 
and Dr. Lewis Mayhew, hired 
last year to examine the future 
of Notre Dame and St. Mary's. 
This report to be published De­
cember 25, 1970 will analyze 
the social and academic areas of 
the two schools and the effects 
of coeducation upon the two. 
After spending the past two 
weeks meeting with the stu­
dents, faculties, and administra­
tions of both schools, the re­
searchers found "profound irri­
tations." Dr. Park stated, "There 
are many problems here al­
though many are on a small 
scale. A lot has been accom­
plished, but a plateau has been 
reached and a new vision is need­
ed." 
She also stated that "there are 
three ways to view the present 
situation. First, there is a move­
ment toward cooperation and a 
growing mixture of the sexes on 
the two campuses. Secondly, 
both schools are in financial cri­
sis, and thirdly the young people 
want variety in their educational 
opportunities." 
According to the researchers, if Notre Dame went co-ed inde­pendently of St. Mary's, within three years SAT points at St. Mary's would drop and there off speculation that he might withdraw from the three way race as the only chance of defeating White House favorite James L. Buckley, the Conserva­tive Party candidate. 
Goodell said some had sug­gested he withdraw and support _ someone else, but he said he would not because "I've bee.n a Republican all my life." 
"Whatever happens in this election I'm not going to let any­one turn me out of the Republi­
can Party," he said. "I say to you that I have lots of counsel and I've anguished over this," Goodell said. "I be-
would be an eventual drop in people. If however, St. Mary's went co-ed without Notre Dame, it would have a rough time attracting people competing 
with a "brand name." 
Dr. Mayhew said coeducation would have several advantages. "There would be a minimum of friction between schools, greater efficiency, and a consistant pol­icy of student life." He sug­gested that perhaps the best sol­ution would be a reorganization of Notre Dame as a grouping of several colleges with St. Mary's 
forming  one  college  in  the  
grouping.  
Carol  Henninger  stated  that  

when this idea was presented to a meeting of the SMC faculty 
Panthers charged with conspiracy 
DETROIT (UPI) Fifteen per­sons who barricaded themselves in a house, described as a Black Panthers headquarters, for eight hours following the fatal shoot­ing of a Detroit policeman were charged yesterday with first de­gree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. 
At the same time, the great restraint used to handle a situa~ tion that could have been "a holocaust. . .1967 again and more" was commended by city and state officials who grimly re­member the riot here three years ago. 
Three youths-Ben Fondrun and David Johnson, both 19, and Eron Desaussure, 18-who remained in the near West Side house until police used tear gas to flush them out, were held without bond. 
The four young men and eight women who surrendered volunt­arily in the company of com­munity leaders including Acting Mayor Mel Ravitz and State Rep. James Del Rio, were held 
on  bonds  of  $10,000  to  
$25,000.  
A hearing for all  15  was  set  

for Oct. 30. 
Of eight others arrested near the scene, one was charged with assault and battery, one with destruction of property, five were released and another faces possible arson charges in the burning of a police car. The trouble began Saturday evening when two policement tried to break up the sale of Black Pan­ther literature. Police said the sidewalk was being blocked and persons were refused passage unless they took the literature. A scuffle followed and the offi­
cers called for help. 
One of the cars responding brought patrolman Marshall Emerson and a colleague to the scene. Emerson was shot in the hand, treated at a hospital and "the majority seemed to like the idea of SMC being the liberal arts college of the University." 
The disadvantages of coeduca­tion discussed by the students present at the meeting centered around the loss of St. Mary's identity; the loss of prestige of the degree from St. Mary's for graduates once it became part of the University; and the teaching assistants program at ND. According to Miss Henninger, "One reason for not merging is the teaching assistants program at Notre Dame. They have more interest in the graduate courses that they're taking than in the material for the courses they're teaching. We have no graduate

lieve it would be very wrong to let the forces of the right have their victory. 
"What they want most of all is to destroy me. What they want most of all is to see that I'm not elected. I'm going to fight those forces. My roots are Republican." 
Agnew has listed Goodell as one of many liberal Senators who have been "obstruction­ists"to President Nixon's pro­
grams. Goodell, who was sent to the Senate two years ago to fill the seat of the ~ate Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, said he was proud of 

his record and believed the Re­publicans needed diversity among its members. 
"I believe very deeply that the President needs progressives coming up with ideas," Goodell said. 
The speculation of Goodell's withdrawal also was prompted by his poor showing in the New York Daily News straw poll re­leased yesterday. In the poll he was running third behind Buck­ley and Rep. Richard Ottinger, the Democratic candidate. 
It was believed if Goodell withdrew his votes would prob­ably go to Ottinger, a liberal, and would enable the Demo­cratic candidate to defeat Buck­ley. 
"Now the News poll says I will lose," he said. "This is in the face of all other polls I have seen in the last three weeks. 
"The Daily News poll is im­portant, even though it's been two out of the last three

elections, including predicting Gov. Nelson Rockefeller would lose in 1966." 
Goodell's show began with a film of Agnew denouncing him. Goodell then appeared before the camera, standing casually and holding a pipe in his hand. 
"Freedom has died many ways, gloriously on the battle field, died in the halls of politics, selfishly in ambition and avarice of man," he said at the show's closing. "The most ignominious death of all is when freedom dies in its sleep. I've tried to provide 
leadership  to  awaken  our  
people."  
The  poll,  which  has  chosen  

the winners in 26 out of 30 elec­tions since 1928, gave Buckley 37 per cent of the vote, Ottinger 30 per cent and Goodell 24 per cent with 9 per cent undecided. The first of three surveys before the election, it was based on a

released. 
The 15 persons then bar­ricaded themselves in a nearby house. As officers arrived to iso­late the area, police said a gun blast from the house struck pa­trolman Glenn Smith in the head. He was dead on arrival at Detroit General Hospit:'l.l. 
Black leaders~ including Del Rio and Nadine Brown, a colum­nist for the Michigan Chronicle, a black newspaper, spent several hours trying to coax the occu­pants out of the house while po­lice looked on. 
The first 12 finally surren­dered "because Chuck Holt the Detroit leader of the National Committee to Combat Fascism, said the community around their house would be jeopardized if they didn't," Miss Brown, a petite, middle aged woman with an Afro style hairdo, said. 

Police Commissioner John Nichols then delivered an ultima­tum to the remaining three occu­pants before directing police to fire tear gas into the house "be­cause the situation in the peri­pheral areas was becoming tense." 

Detroit police lead a Black Panther party member to a waiting p-olice van late Saturciay after Black Panther party members barricaded an inner city house ~ar where one policeman was shot and killed and a second wounded. (UPI)

Ictus, the magazine put out by students in the Program of Non-Violence, will be published at least four times this year, with the first issue due in two weeks. 
This past June a memo was issued from Rev. John Walsh, who was at that timeVice-president for Academic 
Affairs, saying that Ictus would not be published this year. 
Dennis Lundy, John O'Reily, and John Dwyer, the editors of the magazine, went to see Rev. James Burtchaell, who assumed Fr. Walsh's duties when he was appointed University Provost. 
Fr. Burtchaell could give the editors no reason for the magazine's suspension, except to cite the University's financial troubles, and then gave the 
magazine approval to publish. 
According to Lundy, Ictus will undergo substantial changes this year. Besides being slightly smaller in size, the editors plan 
to avoid publishing political articles and to center around personal experiences instead. 
As an example of their new 
' representative to the Student 

direction, the first issue will 
contain an article by David Darst, member of the catonsville lJ who was killed in an automobile collision last year. 
Also, the. magazine will feature an article about Fred Schwartz, a former Notre Dame student who was killed in Africa while working for the Peace Corp. The article will consist of letters and other mementos compiled by Schwartz's mother.

The overall opinion expressed by those associated with the Sophomore· Year Abroad Program is one of continual praise. The director, various deans, and the participating students agree that for­eign study has proved beneficial for all. 
The program began in I964 in Inns­bruck, Austria, spread to Angers, France in 1966 and has since expanded into Tokyo, Rome, and most recently, Mexico City. The Innsbruck program is con­ducted at the University of Innsbruck (Leopold-Franzens Universitat), Angers' at Universite Catholique de !'Quest, and Tokyo's in the city itself at the Jesuit Sophia University. Rome is connected with no university as such, but is the ex­tension of the Saint Mary's campus in Italy, and Mexico City has the Univer­sidad Anahuac. 
It should be noted that the participat­ing students are still officially enrolled as members of the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College; and, that they receive no extra credit for going abroad, but are taught the required courses in order to achieve their necessary credit-hours. 
The program was created for the bene­fit of the individual as a student and as a person. Being educated abroad, it is felt, does not take anything away from a

Notre Dame education, but rather widens perspectives, allowing students to see their own culture from the inside. 
There are many advantages to be accrued in foreign study. Since the aca­demic and social programs abroad are less structured, the student tends to have more time for reflection and independent exploration. He also learns to understand and appreciate his own country and cul­ture. 
OBSERVER INSIGHT 
The director ot the Forei~n Studies__ 
Program (F.S.l'.),. Rev.. Lawrence Broestle, attributes various factors to the programs' apparent success. First, the immediate purpose of foreign study has been accompolished. Students return, having a more defined concept of their own community and the larger commu­nity about them. Secondly, they have . 
mastered another language, and thereby learned another means of communica­tion. Thirdly, and probably the most 
satisfying to Fr. Broestle and the faculty members involved, is that the students have been pleased, and regard their for­eign activities as quite enjoyable and re­warding. 
Robert J. Waddick, assistant dean of the College of Arts and Letters, also 
praised  the  program.  He  said  that  the  
courses  plus  the  experience  of  being  
abroad  are  extremely  important  and  

valuable to the student. He believes that the F.S. P. provides a new outlook for the individual and gives him a firm grasp of a foreign country's language and customs. 
The only drawback to the program, according to Waddick, has been the in­adequate counseling the student receives abroad. But this is being remedied this year, he pointed out. 
Another plus is the program's place­ment in the sophomore year -thereby letting the student get his required courses in before declaring a major and having to devote a great deal of time to that major. 
Dean Thomas Murphy of the College of Business explained that foreign study can also be very helpful to the business major. Students have a chance to observe comparative economic systems, different equity financing, stock exchanges, and monetary systems, he said. Students can also see how American banks and insur­ance companies operate abroad. Dean 
Murphy considers the program "highly successful" and encourages greater stu­dent interest _and participation. 
Freshmen become interested in the program for many reasons. Some find for­eign study useful in the fields, such as diplomatic relations, sociology, or lan­guage, which they intend to pursue after college. 
Students who wish to go next year and those who have returned this year said that they wanted to get similar things out of the program. Both groups wanted to receive a grasp of a foreign language superior to that which is available in an American classroom, and both groups wanted an opportunity to travel to other countries. 
Dan Doody, a freshman hoping to go to Jnnsbruck next year, wishes to meet' new people, and is curious as to the re­ception he will experience both as a for­eigner and as a member of the minority group that the Americans will be in lnns­bruck. 
Kelly Cushing, who returned from lnnsbruck this year, enjoyed the F.S.P. and its freely structured program, which allowed him to travel from Spain to Greece through Yugoslavia and as far north as Belgium. He agreed with Dean Waddick concerning the counseling ser­vice abroad, but said again, that it is being remedied.

Arrangements for the speak­ing engagement of Jane Fonda on November 8, at Stepan Center are now under discussion according to SUAC Co-chairmlll'\ James Metzger. Metzger said that he was discussing the speaking engagement of Miss Fonda with SUAC Co-chairman Missy Underman as well as Student 
 union Director Bob Pohl, whom Metzger said is not in favor of Miss Fonda's appearance on campus. 
A contract with Jane Fonda's agent has already been signed by SUAC, and whether or not Miss Fonda appears at Notre Dame, she will be paid. A final decision on the matter is expected tonight. 
Opinion has varied on Miss Fonda's scheduled speech. Stu­dent Body Vice President Mark Winings thought that "she might have something interesting to say," and that he would "let the people be the judge." 
Professor Norling of the His­tory Department remarked that she "was not a very rr,Qmising selection. (Sl\.e was) picked not because she knows very much,

Tuesday, October 27, a re­presentative from the Institute of European Studies will be on St. Mary's campus to discuss with interested faculty and students the Institute's program for study in Europe. Many students have participated in the program over the past few years. The representative, Mr. T. Tucker Glaser, said he hopes to encourage greater participation for the future. Mr. Glaser will be available for consultation in the Great Hall of LeMans from I0:00 a.m. until early afternoon. If you are interested in studying abroad, plan to see him sometime during those hours to acquaint yourself with this pro­gram.

but because there is a lot of publicity about her. People like this don't add anything to the intellectual atmosphere· of the place, nor do they have anything that's worth listening to." 
Chris Wolfe thought that Miss Fonda was asked to speak was because "she typifies what a woman should be and do to­day." He added that "she is awfully sincere, she's just ignor­~nt. She's the latest in a long line of people who are totally dissa­tisfied with society." 
Wolfe is confident that Miss Fonda will draw a "huge crowd." "Everyone knows what she looks like," he said. Miss 
Fonda  has  starred  in  recent  
a ward  winning  films  such  as

of the coeducation committee was that whoever we got as pres­ident should be willing to work 
closely with Notre Dame." One 
problem brought up was how 
the lack of stability of St. Mary's 
present situation would affect a 
candidate's willingness to accept 
a position which could be dis­
solved by coeducation or merger 
with the University. 
On the question of the re­
action of the Board of Trustees 
toward coeducation, Miss Tracey 
said, "We can realize that if 
there is unity behind the pro­
posal which we finally present to 
them, they'll have to recognize 
the problem and act on it." 
Finally, Miss Henninger stated, 
"The talks are proceeding very 
quickly and I think that Notre 
Dame and St. Mary's together 
will have a definite proposal 
soon for Drs. Park and Mayhew 
for future structure of a St. 
Mary's -Notre Dame collabora­
tion.

Earlier polls had given Ottin­

were clouded by Vice President

the campaign. 
Agnew has repeatedly at­tacked Goodell as a "radical liberal" and all but endorsed Buckely, while President Nixon withheld his endorsement for · Goodell and praised Buckley for 
supporting administration policies. Goodell is a leading Senate critic of Nixon's Vietnam policies and has sponsored legis­lation calling for a unilateral withdrawal of U.S. troops.
