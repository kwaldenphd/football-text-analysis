Council changes proposed at SMC 
By Alison Kittrell 
A budget report, a CILA re­quest, and restructuring community government were the main topics of discussion at the St. Mary's Student Assembly which met last night in Holy Cross Hall. 
The first item of business dis­
cussed at the meeting was a 
questionaire drown up hy Cecel­

explore the reaction oC the stu­
dents to the shortened fall sem­
ester.

Carol Lacey, SBT, an ary Jane Elias, SSO Comptroller, next gave· the quarterly budget report of the student govern­ment. The balance on hand on May 26, 1970, was $1,567 .83, and receipts totalled $14,000, making the total assets $15,567.83. Disbursements for the year were $5,046.11, leaving the balance on hand on Febru­ary 16, 1971 to be $10,521.72. 
Carol Lacey reported that this amount is more than has usually been left by previous administra­tions. There was some discussion about what to do with~ the money, but nothing was de­
cided. 

A request was made by CILA for money to help with their summer work projects in this hemisphere. After a motion to donate $500 to CILA was de­feated, another motion to do­nate $1,000 to CILA was passed. 
Miss Tracey then presented to the Assembly a letter from Sister Alma. The letter listed proposed changes in community govern­ment, but no copy of the lettei: was ever sent to anyone in stu­dent government. 
It was proposed to add two administrators, the vice-presi­dent of Student Affairs and the Vice-President of Fiscal Affairs, to the Academic Affairs Council. This raised the make-up of the Council from 3 administrators, 4 faculty members, and 2 students to 5 administrators, 4 factdty members and 2 students. 
Miss Tracy termed this new make-up "top-heavy.", referring to the overload of administrators on the council. Also in the letter it was noted that the council will accept recommendations from the faculty assembly and stand­ing committees but no mention 
was made of accepting recom­mendations from sutdent gov­ernment. Three administrators were also added to the Student Affairs Council, making the new proportions 5 administrators, 2 faculty, and 4 students. 
The Director of Campus Min­istry was added to the Student Affairs Committee, and a medi­cal advisor was added to the Health Services Committee. The Development Committee was dropped 
The discussion centered main­ly around the reason why the students were not consulted in the decision. Miss Tracey said that the situation "could have been avoided so easily·. I don't see why the administration chose to do it this way."

The two Dillon Hall residents noted that their campaign will be informal. They do not plan to campaign in the halls or "flood the campus with platforms and posters." Murphy said that their information would be "released to the Media"-the Observer and WSND. 
Sherman said that the Sherman-Murphy platform "has not been completely worked out," but explained that it should be ready by Monday.

The Co-Ed ProposalMust Pass 
Since the General Assembly of Students has breathed its last GASp without resolving anything other than that departmentals, departmentals, and Austin Carr respectively, draw better than Assembly, Assembly, and Assembly, respectively, it becomes doubly important to pass the pr,oposed Coeducation Bill in the Referendum schttduled for next Wednesday. 
SBP Krashna scheduled the Assembly in order to give the Board of Trustees a full and clear picture of the depth -of student support for full coeducation. If the General Assembly is any indication, students may not only prefer not to coeducate, but not to have anything .to do with women at all. The whole thing will leave a very bad taste in the Trustee's collective mouths, and only a strong affirmation of the bill in the Wednesday referendum will lend any credence at all to the contention that the bill is the will of the students, a contention Krashna must make if he is to win rapid coeducation from the Trustees. 
A weak showing, in turn, will probably mean that Park-Mayhew will win acceptance in its grotesque entirety. That the Assembly was a failure was partially Student Government's fault; it was horribly timed and the publicity was pervasively poor (the Student Union calendar said that the Assembly would be held Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at eight; in reality, it was scheduled for seven), but the major fault lies with us. We have been passive and non-vocal at the outbreak of the Park-Mayhew; and conspicuous in our absence at the Assembly which proposed alternatives to Park-Mayhew; if we fail to exercise our franchise on the final amendment we will be saddled with Park-Mayhew. And that will be our own t lgh luck.

Whot 1s Happening 
to our Faith 

With the late' Assembly now thoroughly GASsed, the Notre Dame student body appears ready for more serious things. ~ertainly '.the Alumni is. Why, just the other day the daily Rag received an epistle from a committee of concerned Notre Dame Alumni which called itself, appropriately enough, the Concerned Notre Da_m_e Alumni. They were particularly concerned about the state of rehgwn ?ere at the playing fields of du lac; and specifically_ co~cern~~ with the students veneration of a character temporarily Identified as the "Lovely Lady dressed in Blue." 
The letter written "for the Committee' by John T. Balfe, '20, 
K.C.H. som<~thing, has been endorsed by at least one of the nation's more gnostic theolgians, i.e. John T. Balffe, '20, K.T.C. something. Under the letter's masthead, which says -surprise -"Concerned Notre Dame Alumni Committee," is a patch of what has been momentarily identified as metaphysical poetry. 
"Lovely Lady dressed in Blue  
"Why don't students pray to  you?  
"Is it taboo?"  .  
Without  attempting  to  answer  such  a  profound questiOn (St.  

Augustine tried to answer the same question for years; eventually gave up in :something very near despair) John T. Balfe, '20, K C.H. something (his real name) gets to the meat of the matter. "On November 30, 1970," he writes, "an Open Letter asking 'What. is Happening to Religion at Notre Dame' was sent to:"-and then he mentions aU the people who got the letter. It turns out that he sent it tq 42 Trustees, none of whom replied, 45 Officers of the University" (whether he included J. Arthur is left to the imagination; I asked the guy who patrols my hall and all he did was eye his pistol nervously), and 22 Officers and Directors of the Alumni Association. Among the Officers of the University, only Father Sheedy deigned to reply; among the Officers and Directors of the Alumni Association, one called the Concerned Committee to say "I too am disturbed." Mr. Balfe unfortunately never elaborates on the Direcor's disturbance; it would have made for some interesting reading. 
He writes: on; it turns out that he talked with a CSC who in turn talked to "a recent graduate, Phi Beta Kappa, Wilson Scholarship, etc." Although no such name is listed under a list of recent gradutes (In fact, the:y're the names of two awards!) we will have to make a leap of faith to believe the CSC. The priest then goes on to relate that his frie:nd learned -from other priests, yet! -that "God "did not create me. Man created God." and "Jesus didn't know Himself whether He was God or not." 
This, of course, is serious stuff indeed. Young and tactile minds, such as those of youngsters here at Notre Dame, ought not to be exposed to such perverse thoughts. That would lead to loss of faith, and in one short step to public lewdness, obscenity, marijuana sniffing, and finally heroin addiction and demon w~rship. And here we can only echo Mr. Balfe's question, posed boldly mthe middle of his page, "Have you had enough?" 
But there: is more. If you want to learn about a "Pornographic Exhibit at Notre Dame" Mr. Balfe suggests you get hold of Fr. McCarragher. If you want to know about the "pre..Christmas campus 'Drug Raid"'' Mr. Balfe suggests that you get hold of the South Bend Chief of Police, whose name has moentarily slipped Mr. Balfe's alleged mind. If you want to learn about A-rtion, Mr. Balfe suggests that you "Read the Notre Dame offician campus daily 'The Observer' or 'The Scholastic."' Of course, we here at the daily Rag don't even print such naughty words like "a-rtion." We've been noticably clean since that reformed Lady Armwrestler came here and said all those nasty things about the Church. 
But these evil things do exist on campus, my spies inform me, and so we become indignant with Mr. Balfe in the next sentence when "Accordingly we accuse the Trustees, the Officers of the University and The Directors of the Alumni Association with (sic): 
"1. Neglecti!_!g their corporate and administrative responsibilities. 
"2. Making Notre Dame a non-demoninational University; of selling the Soul of Notre Dame for the proverbial 30 pieces of silver." (Though I here think we might have been a bit arrogant had 
we asked for more. ) "3. Deceiving Catholic. parents by not advising them that Notre Dame is no longer a Catholic University.. 
But never fear, Mr. Balfe and his Concerned Committee is going to pray a de,~ade of the rosary daily for us and for our spiritual needs of Notre Dame. He closes with the pithy thought: "Better to 
develop one Saint than I00 Scholars, and "May the Lovely Lady dressed in Blue help us pray and do and do ." 
Can we do more? Dare we do less?

Friday, February 19,1971 711B OBSERriER. 

There is a quality in some of. us, who were touched in our birth with traces of the Celtic imagination, by which we romanticize the past, fantasize the pres­ent and dream of futures that can never be.' Of my own childhood among the fisher-folk of the Maine coast, for exam­ple: I am fond of mistakenly remember­ing myself as a lad with spray-lashed cheeks, swarming over wharves bearded with sea-moss in the rockbound villages, or playing like a merboy among the whitecaps, the progeny of rugged skippers who have sailed for two and a half centuries ·before the mast. Actually, my personal and best known village was the largest city in the state. The last of my clan to follow the sea was a grandfather who retired from his poopdeck twenty years before I first sniffed the tuna­infested waters fringing the outer islands of Casco Bay. Except for summers spent on those islands in ancient, ancestral cottages that served as the places for our vacation retreats, my grandfather was my closest link to the sea. I remember how he would take me as a child to Fort Allen Park, in Portland, with its vistas that overlooked the whole bayside. There he would recite the Ballad of the Flying Cloud, or tell me of heavy seas encoun­tered off the Grand Banks, where his ship went down and every hand aboard except himself (including his father and his father's five brothers) perished in the storm. Sometimes, with a gleam in his eye

Dreams and memor1es 
as though he were remembering a night­watch in the waters out from Tunis or spars silver-tipped with starlight in the shimmer of a Sargasso Sea, he would speak of the shelter that a waited him in the Sailors' Snug Harbour, by which he meant, I supposed, the salvation he hoped for among the Galilean fishermen in heaven. 
But not all of my day-dre:>>:.;,,g i~ so reflective of memories that seem litted from the pages of Captains Courageous. Lately, for example, I have been imagin­ing myself as an actor treading the boards of. our local, campus theater. Specifically, I toy with the idea of trying out for the role of Mr. Bumble, the beadle of the workhouse, in the ND-SMC production of Oliver! Intimates who visit my digs in Keenan assure me that I am capable of a 
creditable performance as that bloated bag of meanness who is so heavily afoot in the lost childhood of young Twist, depriving orphans everywhere of their daily bowls of gruel and servings of lentil soup. Being a rector, I suppose, would bring out the Bumble in any of us, but it is doubtful that the anti-<:harms of a hall administrator, together with a privately­cultivated brand of uncouthness, could ever substitute for the lack of a play­actor's talent, which would be needed, I hope·, to make it appear verisimilitudi­nous that my own gracelessness ap­proaches that of a moral monster from the dark shadows of a Dickensian world. 
But it takes lit.tle talent to dream of a night behind the footlights, just as it took only a little imagination, two weeks ago, to announce the hope .of conducting a Lenten Retreat into Books during the Sundays of Lent. The mailman knows there was enough respon.~e to the an­nouncement; five times as many students wrote expressing a wish to be involved in the project as one could decently hope to accommodate. But a dozen practical rea­sons, including the arrangement of time and place, and an over-subscription by interested parties, conspire to defeat the plan. Sad to relate, I am haunted by an inner uncertainty of my own ability to elevate a literary confrontation into an experience of insights into the truths of the living God. I covet the respect of students too much to expose them to Sundays as dull, one can imagine, as those breakfasts where Billy Graham meets for prayer with the Nixons. To those who write, I say, you were charming to in­quire, and thank you. What you really need for such a Retreat into Books as I mentioned is a saint and a scholar. At the moment, my-credentials to either preten­sions are considerably tarnished. 
But my most ambitious and transcen­dent dreams involve my own sense of place in the discipleship of Jesus Christ. f\s a priest, one longs to play a role in the Parable of the Good Samaritan, Who binds up the wounds of the world. Every 111an is my neighbor; he bears in his flesh, just, as I do, the wounds of brigandry; love's anointing is necessary for his heal­ing. The difficulty with many men is that they do not even know they have fallen into the hands of robbers. If they find themselves struck down into the ditches of the Jericho road, they just lie there as 
though dead. The Samaritan, Who is Christ, awaits their cries in vain. Some­'times they perish in their aloneness; and all the while the Samaritan is searching for them, and they don't even know He is near. 
I think of the structures through which the work of the priest is done: hearing confessions, for example, in Manhattan churches, during the months of July and August~ The experience is like being stoned fo death by clods torn out of the dull, dead earth of Nerdsville. Nothing is less exciting than a stale transgression, especially as it is pre-packaged with ab­stractions for verbal delivery to a con­fessor: Masses missed, "bad thoughts" indulged in, night-prayers skipped. And the priest, sitting in the stifling darkness, wonders: does this soul breathe? Is he alive to the grace pf God's wonder? Is he gentle with love, lifting fledgling birds back into their nest, loving the lost lamb more than all the rest'? In despair of knowing, the priest offers the Our Father as a penance, and the dialogue of mercy is ended. 
I remember a night in New York when a young Puerto Rican approached me with his anguish on a street corner. He was twenty-four years old, he said, mar­ried for seven years, with four children credited to his fatherhood. He did not love his wife, he said; and he had never loved her. But as seventeen year old youngsters, they had been found in bed together by her parents. Shotguns had been trotted out, and a marriage per­formed before. a priest, out of deference to her family's sense of outraged honor. After seven years of loveless marriage, he said, he was so filled with hate for his wife's mother that he feared he was on the point of damnation. Could the father help him not to be afraid of the anger of God?  
I told him that such a marriage was no marriage in the eyes of God or the Church; that if the priest had known the circumstances, he could never have wit­nessed the exchange of vows; that the marriage courts of the Archdiocese could declare the marriage null and void, and that there is never anger in God, especi­ally with children who have been en­tangled by foolishness. In the end that young man went off without believing a word I had said, condemned to a tem­poral hell by his own fears. 
And I, with my touch of a Celtic imagination, wept a bitter tear; not out of a sense of a past romanticism or a future fantasy; but out of a sense of immediacy ugly with the failures of now. 



Sr. Alma discusses coeducation 
Last week, Sister Alma Peter, acting President ot' St. Mary's, was kind enough to consent to a discussion of coeducation with four Innsbruck students: myself, Dan Martuscello, Sue Rice and Maureen Gerety. It is with their aid and their q ues­tions that I am able to write this article. 
The discussion began by considering coeducation in general, its history, its faults, its ramifications, and so on. While discussing the history of coe!fucation, Sis­ter Alma brought the following fact to light: "Ten years ago I sent' three girls over to Notre Dame to take Prof. O'Malley's class, which they wanted to do. Well, the 'South Bend Tribune' found out about it, sent a photographer to the class and printed a story' about it. The local church newspaper then also printed the story, and the bishop found out about it and complained. It ended up with the three girls being withdrawn from the class. That was ten years ago. So I think that we have come a long way in the last ten years." The discussion then moved to contemporary developments; specifically, to the Park-Mayhew report. In response to the question of whether the report was a first step of a final con­clusion, Sr. Alma answered: "I think it's a first step. I don't think that the Boards of Trustees, in their meeting in Florida this March, will consider the Park-Mayhew re­port alone. I think that they are more interested in the reports from the admini­strations, the students, and the faculties. I really see no difficulties with the Boards of Trustees coming to an agreement." Sr. Alma then gave her opinion of the report in general: "I'd like to see some good come out of this report. Some people say I'm emplaced on the river, but I don't think I am. I want to see that what is done is good for the students at St. Mary's and Notre Dame, academically, socially, the whole thing. There are some 
improvements that can be made. And I don't see why they can't be." 
Sr. Alma was then-asked a question which, it seems, is causing a great many people difficulties: the subject of coed dorms. Her response: "I wouldn't oppose it. . .I can see it happening in the future." Sr. Alma was given the specifics of a plan for the institution of coed dorms, which I shall here summarize: one floor of each hall at Notre Dame, ideally, would be re­served for women; the same system could be used at St. Mary's to introduce men on campus. Sr. Alma responded to this plan in the following manner: "I could pro­bably go along with it. ..We have to move with the times." She went on to say that McCandless Hall at S.M.C. might be used as a coeducational dorm. In addition, "Regina Hall looks almost as if it was built for that purpose-as a coed dormi­tory-it has two separate wings, joined by lounge areas. It has been proposed that one of the lounges, which last year was not used, be used as a dining area for a coeducational dormitory in Regina." 
Sr. Alma was then asked about in­creased enrollment at St. Mary's, perhaps to a 3: I ratio. She explained that the present senior class at St. Mary's is relatively small because when the present seniors were freshmen, the classes before them were very large in size and there was very little room for the incoming fresh­men. But, Sr. Alma said; next year's freshman class should be·-"about 500." Asked about a plan for Notre Dame to allocate a portion of its incoming fresh­man class to young women--realistically, about a third-yet still have the girls be registered in S.M.C., although N.D. would provide the physical facilities of housing, Sr. Alma replied: "I have not heard that proposal as yet, so I would have to think about that. But I think that there would be opposition from Notre Dame alumni 
who want their boys to get an education left up to the individual departments. at Notre Dame." Sister was then asked if Now, after the Park-Mayhew revort, we she accepted the Park-Mayhew character-will have to wait and see what the Trus­izations of Notre Dame and St. Mary's as tees decide., being, respectively, ., graduate school-"Wait and see what the Trustees de­oriented and "humanizing."

point to the problem of financial difficul­ties of merger and coeducation. In re­sponse to a question of the support that the Holy Cross Sisters render St. Mary's, if, as outlined in Par:k-Mayhew, they might withdraw their support if St. Mary's merges with Notre Dame, Sr. Alma replied: "I think it could happen. I don't think it would affect the College at all. If St. Mary's was to be 'St. Mary's College in the University of Notre Dame,' then St. Mary's would be a part of Notre Dame, and we would have to find a new board of lay trustees who would be will­ing to back it all. As it stands now, the Holy Cross Sisters own all the buildings and land of the campus. . .St. Mary's finished in the black last year, while Notre Dame has a large deficit. So Notre Dame is not in a position now to buy the buildings at St. Mary's." Our final ques­tion in this out-of-the-ordinary rap­session was whether or not a student might fulfill the requirements of his major at the other campus. Sr. Alma's comment was this: "Previously this was Miss Terri Buck, a Notre Dame cheer­leader, is being fitted by Ice Capades wardrobe mistress, Beverly Banville, with one of Ice Capades lavish costumes. Miss Buck will make an appearance in the finale number of Ice capades Friday night, February 19. Ice Capades is playing at the Notre Dame Athletic and Convoca­tion Center through Sunday, February 21.

"The Social life of Notre Dame leaves much to be desired Cervas feels. "We believe co-education to be a reality; and a necessary one. Our ticket is an expression of that belief," he said. "We see no reason for not having by the beginning of next year co-ed dormitories, co-ed dining facilities, and fully co-ed classes." 
Cervas felt that the two towers should be woman's dorms, but he noted that that was completely up to the students. 
"We. have a different way of looking at things," Cervas said. "We look at them from a moral base. The Notre Dame community should base their lifes on moral concerns with a deep responsibility to all men."

The candidates "idea" was centered around three facets, Academic Life, Cultural Life, and Social (or Intellectual) Life. 
On Academic Life, Cervas noted, "Freedom is the big thing. Freedom is necessary for the individual to grow. Therefore, the structure must be as compromising the flexible as possible. The curriculum must be less stringent and the absurd
