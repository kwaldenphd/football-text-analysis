serving the notre dame -st. mary's community
Vol. IX, No. 43 Thursday, November.:f! 1974 
by Andy Praschak Staff Reporter 

The Notre Dame community proved its l'lectoral power Tuesday in a crucial test f the massive campus registration drive 
held prior to this year's election. 
Most sources agree that votes from the Notre Dame campus, Portage Township number one, proved decisive in some of the local races. Slightly under 1000 students voted out of the 1800 registered, electing the Democrat in every race but one. Votes are still unofficial pending completion of the official canvass. 
Overwhelming Support for Kovach 

In the race for State Senator, District ·Ieven, Democratic candidate Robert 
·ovach received 83 percent of the Notre Jame vote, over his Republican opponent, 
illiam Bontrager. Kovach received 722 ·otes compared to 151 for Bontrager. 'hese figures are contrary to District-wide otals which show Kovach narrowly efeating his opponent with 53 percent of he vote. 
"I deeply appreciate the support from he Notre Dame students," commented Kovach after the election. Kovach, who ·upports lowering the drinking age, assage of the ERA and reduction of >enalties for first time marijuana law lffenders, promised to honor his campaign ·ommitments and maintain an open door 
policy to all Notre Dame students. 
Kovach attrbitued his victory at Notre Dame mainly to his stand on the age of majority and the endorsement he received from Pat McLaughlin, student body president. The percentage of votes Kovach received in this precinct was the largest given to one candidate in any race. It is also the largest majority he received in any precinct, including his own. 
U.S. Senate Race 

Birch Bayh, democratic candidate for 
U.S. Senate, received 58 percent of the campus vote with Richard Lugar, Rf'publican candidate receiving 42 per­cent. Don Lee of the American Party received well under one per cent of the total vote. 
Statewide, Bayh defeated Lugar by the narrow margin of 52 percent. Estimates of 
ND campus responds to elections 


Birch Bayh and John Brademas won their respective elections statewide as well as at N.D. 
the final tally show Bayh winning reelection by 40,000 votes. During this academic year, Lugar campaigned on campus twice while Bayh made only one appearance. 
Rich O'Connor, . campus campaign manager for Bayh, expressed disap­pointment at the number of students who turned out to vote. "We're pleased with the victory here," O'Connor said. "However, we were expecting to get 60 percent of the vote." 
O'Connor pointed out that Bayh spent no actual funds on the Notre Dame campus. "The campaign was carried out by a lot of volunteers with literature from the main headquarters," he said. 
On the other hand, O'Connor cited the fact that the Lugar campaign on campus is guilty of illegal campaign practices, concerning the spending of funds. Ac­cordcng to O'Connor, some Lugar campus advertising attributed to student organizations was actually paid for by the Lugar organization down state. 
Brademas defeats Black 
John Brademas, incumbent Democrat, received 68 percent of the Notre Dame vote in his bid for reelection to the U.S. House of Representatives in the Third District, defeating his Republican op­ponent, Virginia Black. Black, a South Bend school teacher who campaigned strongly on the anti-abortion issue 
· received 292 votes to Brademas's 628. In the entire Third District, Brademas received 64 percent or the vote or 175,616 to Black's 100,380. Brademas is now serving his eighth term as representative of the Third District of Indiana. Black com­mented Tuesday that she had done all she could in the cam'paign and spent the entire day baking oatmeal cookies. 
One Republican Victory 

Notre Dame joined in the effort to elect Robert DuComb, the sole Republican victor, to the position of State Represen­tative from the Ninth District. DuComb's campaign included a last minute deluge of the cainpus with leaflets expressing his support for the ERA and lowering of the drinking age. 
In the same race, where two candidates were elected, the only democratic can­didate defeated, Virginia Bauer, also failed to place in the top two at Notre 
Richard Bodine, Democrat in the same race, received the most votes of the four candidates, following his endorsement by Pat McGlaughlin. Bodine also expressed a desire to reduce the age of majority. 
Campus-wide, the totals in the State Representative race are as follows: Richard Bodine {D)-598; Robert DuComb <R>-462; Elizabeth Bauer (D)-371· Richard Lindsey {R)-326. ' 
Democrats Win State Posts 

In the four races for state offices Democrats were elected by the stat~ populous as well as Notre Dame. Larry Conrad, Democratic candidate for Secretary of State, defeated his Republican opponent, William Allen, with 61 percent of the Notre Dame vote. 
Notre Dame votes chose Mary Currie over Jean Merritt for State Auditor. Currie, the Democratic candidate received 68 percent of the vote. ' 
Jack New received 67 percent of the Notre Dame vote, defeating Randall Miller for State Treasurer. 
The position of Clerk went to Billie McCullough, who defeated Pat Yoho with 74 percent of the campus vote. 
County Sheriff Race 

In the race for County Sheriff, the Democrat was chosen by the country and by Notre Dame. Dean Bolerjack, a Notre Dame graduate, received 70 percent of the campus vote over his Republican op­ponent, Nester P. Stachowicz and an In­depe_ndent candidate, Harold Morgan, who received less than one percent. 
In the race for Prosecuting Attorney pitting two Notre Dame graduates William Voor defeated his Republica~ opponent Wilfred Mayette and carried his alma mater with 65 percent of the vote. 
Richard L. Larrison who vowed to "bring the government back to the pe~ple," defeated the Republican, Jack Ellis for the post of County Commissioner in the First District. 
Voting took place on Tuesday, from 6 
a.m. to 6 p.m. in the basement of LaFortune. Students voting after 11 a.m. were faced with a half hour wait in line to vote on one of the two voting machines supplied by the county. A request has been filed to have more machines available for the next election, as the long lines may have deterd some registered students from voting. · 
Senior Club holds grand opening 
by Norman F. Bower Staff Reporter 
Amid bow-tied, bell-ringing bartenders and comfortable cushions, the renovated Alumni­Senior Club opened the season with a guitar group and approximately 880 patrons. 
The club's first night was a success, accoriding to General Manager William "Butch" Smith. He said, "It's not wall-to-wall, and that's the way we would like it to be. It couldn't be a better crowd and I couldn't be happier." 
Dirersified Atmosphere 
The old senior bar is now the newly organized, directed and decorated Alumni-Senior Club of the University of Notre Dame. The cracked walls and beer-stained floors have been replaced by what was called the "diversified at­mosphere" of the new club by Senior Class Vice President Bob Spann. 

A number of eye-catching new features have been included in the renovation which are bound to surprise anyone who ever saw the old arrangement. New flooring, wall coverings, paintings, paneling, lighting and a music system help create an almost country club atmosphere. 
The three areas on the first floor include a room length bar, a billiards and dance room, and a game room with assorted pinball diversions. 
The upstairs, formerly known for its 'dirt-ball decor', has now been turned into two very different areas, a tavern and a coffeehouse room. The new carpeting on the stairway is a tip-off that some improvements have been made which provide a very subdued atmosphere. 

The tavern has tables and seating plus piped-in music. The bar in that room serves wine, dark beer and malt liquor with cheese and crackers. 
A new concept in student bars has been set up in the dimly lit coffeehouse room which features couches and floor cushions for the clientele to rest upon, while being entertained by student musicians every night. 
Happy Hours 
From now on there will be ac­tivity at the club four nights a week. On Monday and Thursday, the hours will be 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday will feature

Gilligan discusses defeat 
By LEE LEONARD 

COLUMBUS <UPI) -Gov. John J. Gilligan Wednesday said his election defeat by former Gov. James A. Rhodes was "a repudiation of me personally," adding he does not believe a recount will change the results. 
The governor held his over­flow news conference less than 12 hours after Rhodes passed him in the early-morning counting and went on to an ll,OOO-vote victory in the race for governor. 
Gilligan, appearing com­posed, all but c~nceded the election results, whtch could be changed by a re~ount after. ~e official canvass IS made wtthm the next three weeks. 
The governor said he would change very little about the campaign he waged except "maybe I would try to be less arrogant." 
"I-regard the election as a repudiati_on of me personally." 
Gilligan said he -sent Rhodes a telegram conceding that the preliminary vote showed the former GOP governor as the winner. 
lillligan refused to second­guess his campaign, based, he said, on his accomplishments in the areas of tax reform, mental health care, school support and environmental controls.

Gilligan acknowledged that his" arrogance" might have played a part in his defeat but "you see standing before you today one of the least arrogant men in the human race."

CCUM schedules live-in urban study· class 
by Patrick T. Flynn Staff Reporter 

A one credit, 48 hour, "live-in" course is being offered by the Theology department over the semester break this January. The course, which is being offered in conjunction with the Student Activities office will send Notre Dame and St. Mary's students to centers of the Catholic Council on Urban Ministry <CCUM) in 11 American cities. 
The course was announced yesterday by the Student Activities office, who ask students interested in the course to contact them before this Friday. Student Ac­tivities will interview all students interssted in the course and select a maximum of 50. 
CCUM is a seven year-oldorganization focused on social ministry within the church, especially in the poverty and minority-group related activity.The group is international, but is membership is most extensively from American urban areas. 
Students enrolled in the course will arrange to spend two days at a CCUM center in one of the 11 cities, sometime between January 1 and January 11. The students will keep a journal before and during the two-day stay at the center, and turn in an evaluation of the center at the beginning of the spring semester. 
Students will be expected to pay for all travel expenses to and from the CCUM centers. 
The cities in which the CCUM course will be offered are: Baltimore, Washington, Pitt­sburgh, Cleveland, Boston, Chicago, Houston , Memphis, and Greeley <C"olorado)'. The course may also be offered in Portland and Milwaukee. Arrangements with these last two cities have not yet been finalized. 
"Each city center has one person who will 'connect' the students to the people working in the neigh­borhood, and also explain his own work in the neighborhood," said Prof. Jay Dolan of the History Department, wlio is assisting with the course. 
Dolan explained that the cities were chosen because of theype of work going on in each of the local communities. "The type of work each of the centers is engaged in varies from community organizing to locating housing to assisting senior citizens," Dolan said. 
"Thie idea behind the course is experiential learning," stated Fr. Tom Stella, director of Student Affairs. "The course will give students an opportunity to be in the middle of the traffic; to meet and live with the people serving and being served at a center of urban 
ministry." 
"The initiating idea for the program was the experiences of Cila <International Council for the Lay Apostolate) members working in summer projects with catholic social ministers," said Fr. Don 
McNeil, faculty adviser to CILA 
and author of the course. 
"It is my hope that through this 
course the same type of inter­
cultural experiences which CILA 
members have had on summer 
projects, can be made available to 
the university community at 
large," Me Neil said.

WASHINGTON  <UPI)  - In­ 
dependent  James  Longley,  who  
made  political  history  by  

winning the governorship of Maine, was the most successful of a handful of independent and third party candidates in Tuesday's elections. 
Longley won a slim 40 per cent plurality over George Mitchell, the favored Democrat, with 37 per cent and three-time loser James Erwin, the Repub­lican, with 23 per cent. 
Longley, a 50-year-old insur­ance executive, promised he would run the state like a business and retain his political 

independence.  "The  hundreds  
which  turned  into  thousands  
which  turned  into  Longley's  

Legion is the real victory," he said. Elsewhere the independents were not so successful: -In the North Dakota Senate race, environmentalist James 
R. Jungroth's 3 per cent could have been the winning margin for either GOP Sen. Milton Young or former Democratic Gov. William Guy. With 98 per cent of the vote counted, Young had 49 per cent to Guy's 48 per cent.

Government profs react to recent elections 
by Fred Herbst Staff Reporter 
While there seemed to be little surprise in the widespread Democratic victory in Tuesday's elections, a survey of Notre Dame professors' opinions concerning the reasons for the Democratic win and the impact of the election varied. 
Professor of Government and International Studies Paul Bar­tholomew and Associate Professor of Government and International Studies Michael Francis said the Watergate Scandal was the major reason for the heavy Republican losses. 
Disagreement arose from Professor of History Matthew Fitzsimons and Professor of Government and International Studies Donald Kommers who achnowledged the influence of Watergate, but cited the economy as the major issue. 

Statir.g that he couldn't pinpoint the major issue of the wwection, Assistant Professor of Govern­ment Peter Moody Jr. noted that Watergate "created an at­mosphere that greatly influencedl, the election." 
1 All of the professors saw the \election as a judgment of the 'current Ford Administration. 
Francis said the election results show a "lack of faith" in the current administration by the public. 
Stating that the results could stem from a "resentment" of President Ford campaigning for various Republican candidates, :Bartholomew abserved that Tuesday's results reflect a lack of ·influence on the part of the president. 
f The amount of damage suffered by the Republican Party was also disagreed upon by the professors. 
"damage can be overestimated," said Kommers. 
"Normally the out party gains in a 
non-presidential election." Fitzsimmons added that the 
G.O.P. "is damaged, but don't see it turning over and dying." 
Admitting that he isn't one to predict, Bartholomew said the Republicans will win the 1976 Presidential race. 
Off~ring an opposing view, Franc1s stated that the G.O.P. "are in big trouble for 1976." 
The professors agreed that the length of time before the Republican Party returns to "full strength" depends on the ability of the Democratic Party to keep the public satisfied. 
For the G.O.P. to regain its lost strength, Bartholomew allowed that President Ford must put the blame for the nation's problems on the Democratic Congress. 
The formation of a strong Democratic Congress capable of overriding a presidential veto was viewed as unlikely by the professors. 
Historically the Democratic Party is known for dissension from within. The professors stated that this dissension will continue and

The Notre Dame Chapter of the 
International Student Leadership 
Institute, ISLI, will hold its annual 
conference this weekend in the 
Center for Continuing Education. 
The highlights of the conference 
will be a series of group workshops 
and speeches by Father Robert 
Griffin, University chaplain, and 
Professor John Broderick of the 
Law School. 
Eighty to eighty-five high school 
students will participate, ac­
cording to Tim Puntarelli, 
Chairman of the ND chapter. The 
meetings are scheduled for Friday 
night, all day Saturday and Sunday 
morning. 
The ISLI is an organization run 
for high school students in the 
United States and Canada. The 
workshops, which are organized by 
Notre Dame students, try to 
establish self-awareness in in­
dividuals. They also help the 
students understand the repon­
sibilities of a leadership position, 
explained Puntarelli. 
The ISLI was started at Notre 
Dame in 1966 by Father Thomas 
Chambers, C.S.C., rector of 
Morrissey. Since then, the 
organization has spread, and 
chapters have been set up on the 
campuses of Stonehill College in 
Massachusetts, Clarke College in 
Iowa and Notre Dame College in 
Vancouver, Canada. 
The Notre Dame chapter has 40 
members on campus. Besides 
sponsoring the conference, chapter

Nixon has pneumonia in a

the condition as "pneumonitis" 
but hospital spokesman Norm

prevent the formation of an ex­ceptionally strong Congress. 
Bartholomew noted that this dissension is a result of the failure of the party to produce a single leader. 
While none of the professors claimed to have voted a straight party ticket, they did give their political views. 
Francis voted "mostly Democratic" due to the fact that he feels "the Republicans are so bad, not because the Democratics are so good." 
Kommers "tended to vote Democratic, mainly on economic grounds but not always." 
Fitzsimmons primarily voted Democratic due to the strong impressions made on him by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Fitz­simmons said he has had these 
impressions confirmed since Roosevelt's time. 

Moody voted Democratic because his family always has. 
Only Bartholomew voted Republican. He did so since he feels the Republican fits his moderately conservative

Ford views G.O.P. defeats optimistically 
By R. H. GROWALD 

WASHINGTON (UPI) President Ford sees the con­gressional elections as no defeat for himself nor his policies and asks the victorious Democrats to join him in beating inflation, the chief White House spokesman said Wednesday. 
"The President said to me he expects Congress to act respon­sibly; we will act responsibly; we will meet them half way," News Secretary Ron Nessen said. "He doesn't consider the economy to be a partison issue. 
"The President is holding out a hand and saying let's work together because this problem is too important to play politics." 
Nessen said there is "no gloom, no depression" in the White House. 
"It wasn't a very good day for Republicans and it wasn't a very good day for Republicans he campaigned for," Nessen said. He rejected any idea the Democratic tide was a rejection of the President or his policies although Ford campaigned for 47 candidates as Vice President and following his taking office Aug. 9, barnstormed across the nation for the GOP. 
"Nobody here feels yester­day's election was a vote of no confidence in the President's economic program," Nessen said. 
Although Ford called inflatioll the No. 1 campaign issue, Nessen said that "we wouldn't disagree that it was a 

New Congress waits 
anxiously 
WASHINGTON <UPI) -A younger, greener, more ener­getic and more liberal Congress stands waiting in the wings. When it takes power in January, the Senate may no longer find itself less conserva­tive than the House. 
Even the GOP felt the leftward swing of Tuesday's elections. Republicans who lost re-election bids or retired tended to be the older ones. In the new 94th Congress, the GOP House membership will be younger and more liberal than that which Gerald R. Ford used to lead. 
The elections tended to weed out mossbacks from both parties in the House. Nearly one member in four will be a new face, and once-dictatorial committee chairmen will have to share power --i)r risk losing it. 
Deatti, retirements, resigna­tions, losses in the primaries ­plus defeats of incumbents Tuesday -brought the number of new faces in Congress to about 100 in the House and at least 11 in the Senate. 
Despite all the changes and the Democratic landslide ill the House, it would be inacctarate to label the new Congress "veto-proof." 
Vetoes historically are over­ridden by coalitions which form and dissolve according to outside pressures Congress feels on specific issues. And there also is a tendency among Democrats, when they become numerous, to divide into war­ring factions. 
In addition, the new Congress was voted into office in large measure on the inflation issue, and new members know a "big spender" tag could hurt two years hence. 
Budget demands are so severe there will be little left for new spending, big or small, as congressmen face the problems of the '70s -food shortages, inflation, recession, the weight of petro-billions abroad, an1 -demands for institutional reform in Congress and throughout ~overnment. 
In the Senate, -Democrats won or were leading in races for 24 seats and Republicans won in 10 races. Democrats were 
1n WJ.ngs 
expected to hold a 62-38 advantage, a gain of four seats. 
In the House, Democrats won 49 seats previously held by the GOP while Republicans gained five former Democratic seats and were leading in another. The new House would be comprised of 292 Democrats and 143 Republicans. 
Many of the pressures to 
which Congress reacts come 
from the nation's statehouses. 
In the gubernatorial races, 27 
Democrats were elected while 
Republicans won six races and 
were leading in another. 
Combined with holdovers, 
Democrats would control 36 
goverships and Republicans 
would hold 13. In one state,

Ford is pushing for the lame duck Congress to enact his program -including economic action and confirming Nelson 
A. Rockefeller as vice president -and Wednesday beginning work on a hold-the-line 1976 budget.

Faculty Board to 
accept bowl bid 
by Jim Donathen Staff Reporter 

The Faculty Board in Control of Athletics yesterday decided to accept a bowl bid if one is offered, announced Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, university executive vice president and chairman of the faculty group. "The faculty committee discussed the possibility of a bowl bid and decid~d that if one is forthcoming, we wtll be free to accept," said Joyce. 
Joyce said the Faculty Board had not received an official bowl bid. Their decision was a response to the football coaching staff and players who indicated the desire to accept a bowl bid. 
Official announcement of bowl invitations is not expected until Nov. 16, the date the major bowl committees have voluntarily agreed upon. Yet, the Faculty Board's decision paves the way for a rumored rematch with Alabama in the Orange Bowl

In the outer offices of the White House Tuesday night if there was no gloom, there also was no joy. Wednesday Nessen bounded onto the platform in front of newsmen and opening his briefing with a smile and saying, "Well, it was only an election. It was not as if Ohio

Irish look to 
by Bob Kissel 

The young Fighting Irish hockey team hosts the Falcons of Bowling Green tonight beginning a non-WCHA two game series. Both games, tonight and tommorrow, start at 7:30p.m. at the ACC, with ND hoping to improve their 1-3 record. 
Notre Dame has had some problems in their first four league contests against Wisconsin and Colorado College. "We made a few serious mental errors, like changing on the fly before the puck was deep in Colorado's zone or the defense carrying the puck too far without dumping it in " explained Coach Lefty Smith. "Colorado was there to capitalize on the mistakes." 
. In preparation for the series ag~inst the Falcons, Lefty has made some hneup changes. Pat Conroy wtll center for Don Jackson and Kevin 'Frankie' N_ugent; Brian. Walsh at center, Alex Pirus at right wing, and Clark Hamtlton at left wmg are reunited; Mark Olive has moved from right wing to center between AI Karsnia and a healthy Ray Johnson· and frosh Don Fairholm will sub for the injured Geoff Collier as the pivot' man for Jim Augustine and Tim Byers. 
On defense Coach Smith maintains the blueline duos of Les Larson and Roger Bot.u·que, Jack Brownschidle and Paul Clarke, while pairing Lew Curry and knee-injury recovered Dave Bossy. Dan Byers and Dick Howe may see action in Friday's game. 
In goal Smith will start Len Moher Thursday night and John Peterson Friday night. Both Moher and Peterson have played well so far this season, a position Lefty Smith can smile about. 
"Both goaltenders, Len <Moher) and John (Peterson) have come up with many big saves when they were tested on good sh~ts " remarked Smith."These two kids have kept all the games close, both here and in Madison." 
-
"~inning both games is very important to our young club," noted Smtth, "we have to go on out and get some momentum. Practice this week has been good and lively--the guys don't feel as if the season is over because of the Colorado series." 
Bowling G_reen is a very experienced club at all positions, forward, defense, and tn goal. Three of their four top scorers are back Bob Dobek (44 goals-42 assists), Doug Ross (31 goals-35 assists), and Ri~h Nagai (26 goals-35 assists). Both goaltenders return from last year (Mike Luit and AI Sarachman>with a year of experience under their belts. 
"The Falcons' level of hockey is as good a taste of competition as we'll have all year," commented Smith. "Bowling Green will be up for the series because it is their first of the year and also a couple of wins could help their chances of getting an NCAA tournament bid." 
Tuesday night Coach Smith spent a few hours in Chicago's In­ternational Amphitheatre watching with great delight one of ths former proteges--Larry Israelson. Israelson was called up to the WHA Van­couver Blazers from their Tulsa farm outfit ot go against the Cougars. 
Larry made the best of his chance with the big team, assisting on the tying goal and scoring the winning goal. 
Smith was pleased, to say the least, with Israelson's progress from the 
collegiate ranks to the pros. His exuberance from the Blazers' game was 
reflected in yesterday's energetic practice. 

If the attitude at Wednesday's practice was any indication of things to 
come, the Irish are golden.. And with a few goals, the long faces around 
the ACC ice arena should change considerably.
