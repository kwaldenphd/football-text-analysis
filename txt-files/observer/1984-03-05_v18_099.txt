Dunked in Alcohol 
Studying takes a back seat to daydreaming these days and at this weekend's parties the most-asked question will undoubtedly be, "Are you going anywhere over break?" But the one thing we will try the hardest to put out of our minds in upcoming weeks is that upon our return, the alcohol committee finally may have reached its verdict on the fate of our liquor. 
It is necessary to qualify this statement with "may have reached its verdict" since Father William Beauchamp and his alcohol committee refuse to tell anyone anything about what's going on. 
Following the inaugural ACCENT lecture on "The Dry Campus Issue," Beauchamp allowed his fascist inclinations to show through when he proposed the question and anwer period would "at least be a ques­tion period. I don't know if we'll give answers of not." 
Well, pardon us for asking Father, so sorry to bother you with questions about something which will affect our social lives for the next few years. 
Beauchamp admitted the committee had made a pact of secrecy. "We agreed amongst ourselves once 
/ 

But the committee members are barking up the wrong tree anyway. If they really want to spoil our fun and waste away our livelihoods, they should not be considering an alcohol ban. Not everybody drinks to excess, and those who do, don't really enjoy it, at least not the morning after. 
No, if the committee sincerely wants to be the ultimate party-poopers, not to mention discouraging countless prospective applicants, the obvious solution would be to take away our basketball courts. Since

many students choose to play ball rather than socialize, the courts at Stepan and the Rockne Memorial are usually packed on Friday and Saturday nights. This is where we really spend our weekends, not nipping at a bottle or chugging a beer bong, as the committee seems to think. 
If they are truly determined not to allow us any fun 
at all, and to condemn us to a life of quiet 
unmolested by the ways of the world, they should take 
a bulldozer to the foul line and chop down the new 
Stepan floodlights. Rip those planks off the Rock:1e 
floor, boys. 
But perhaps they are afraid of student reacti(Jn to 
such drastic measures. In that case, they should ~imp­
ly ban basketball playing at hall parties. Post a priest 
at the door and frisk for basketballs, or worse yet, a 
hoop. 
Or maybe it's the problem ball-player that they're concerned about. That's easy, all they have to do is to set up a mandatory counseling program for those caught going to the hoop just a little too often. They could be lectured on the dangers of basketball abuse, such as temporary shortness of breath, increased perspiration and eventual flat feet. 
If they decide to go along with the campus-wide basketball ban the question would reamin, could students shoot a few baskets on football weekends when our athletic alumni are imbibing in a free throw or two? Or would they have to stand helpless on the sidelines? 
One drawback to this plan could be the students would go off campus to play. There they would risk being hit by wreckless autos as they walk exhaustedly back to campus. And everybody knows a student on the way home from a long night of basketball is an easy mark for muggers. 
After they graduate, what's to stop them from put­ting a backboard and rim in their backyard at home and shooting hoops all day long? Th,ip overdue supres­sion could lead up to attempts to slam dunk! 
Maybe we should forget all abou~ this proposal. It would be better to have studen~, play basketball responsible and under the supervisioh of qualified ad­ministrators. They could learn to play in moderation and enjoy the same as it was meant to be enjoyed. 
That might be a good solution to the alcohol ques­tion too, come to think of it.

for an incoming commissioner in­clude: a reliable OC newsletter, happy hours, new mealplans, and a better system of student parking surrounding the campus. 
Doug Honeywell, a candidate for OC commissioner, added, "I want to try and unite OC people with on­campus students and lift the apathy level of those off-campus through dinners and happy hours." 
Jim Hagen as commissioner would like to "work through the student senate and realize that the goals of OC students are also in the interest of on-campus students. We have many common goals." 
Ben Suplick has just one plan ­
He added, "I don't know if it (a policy change) will or won't" result in more students getting hurt, "but the University has a responsibility to teach people to drink respon­sibly." In general, he said, "people choos to break the law, and I think that's their prerogative." 
As for counseling rpograms, Tyson said, "There is evidence that education and awareness programs alone won't work. There has to be a policy" accompanying them. He said he has "mixed emotions" about using counseling as a disciplinary measure, but it must be made clear "there's a difference between a per­son who's an alcoholic and one who's an acohol abuser." 
"Not a large percentage" of Notre Dame students, Beauchamp said, "are alcoholics." According to Tyson, "the issue, obviously, is the person who drinks to get drunk." 
This attitude is what Beauchamp believes must be changed. "The hall party~ has become the standard" feature of social life, yet "after you graduate, you wouldn't be caught dead" at that kind of party. Students, he said, "should be con­fronted about drunkenness," because "it is not accepted in socie­ty." 
Beauchamp admitted most Notre Dame students drank before -com­ing here, but "the situation in which they had alcohol then was generally more controlled than here" because in high school "you had to go home and face you parents." Self­regulation here, Tyson said, "hasn't worked." 
Beauchamp said his main priorities are "to eliminate those situations which encourage alcohol abuse and to recognize state laws and liability." While "we can't ig­nore liability," he said, "our moral responsibility outweighs the legal responsibility. 
"Students," he said, "look at their drinking as a right when in reaity it is a privelege. And it's a privilege which can be taken away by this school. What you're allowec to do as an individual, when you put 7,000 of you together, perhaps there have to be some restrictions." 
"We take our responsibility to develop students' values very seriously," Beauchamp said. "if the current situation regarding alcohol is in conflict with what we stand for, then it's not to be changed."

If elected senior class secretary, Shinn said, "We'd like to take a lot of traditional events that worked well in the past, and add new ac­tiVIties, like off-campus open houses, Winterfest in Monte Carlo and Senior Initiation Week." 
"A lot of people are still asking us if we're serious," said Decker, leader of the "Mob" ticket. "I guess they think we're going to be in charge of Lebanon if we're elected. Ask any former class officer and they'll tell you that the job is

the point bounced off the helmet of a surprised Iowa State goalie, Mario Amantea, and over the open net behind him. 
In a last-ditch effort to salvage the game, Notre Dame trailing 3-2, pulled Lukenda in favor of the ex­tra attacker with just over a minute to play. With Cyclone's Graham Hanson off for holding, the Irish ended up with a powerplay until just 16 seconds remained in the game. An when Lukenda finally came out, Notre Dame had a two­man advantage for nearly 45 seconds. 
But despite several close calls in the late going, the Irish couldn't turn on the red light behind

about nine minutes left. 
Although in the final analysis, Sluby's points seem meaningless considering the fact that Notre Dame lost the game, that is not en­tirely the case. In hitting 14-28 from the field and 2-5 from the line Saturday, the Irish captain equaled 
the best single game performance 
of his Notre Dame career, which he 
set just over a week ago against 
Marquette. 
With his 30 points, Sluby also 

totaled the highest season point 
average for an Irish player since 
Adrian Dantley in the mid-1970's. 
He closes out the regular season 
with an 18.3 scoring average as the 
team winds up 17-II. 
Next up for Notre Dame is the 

National Invitational Tournament ­
the NCAA's are, no doubt, entirely 
out of the question now. The 
players, although certainly not hap­
PY with the outcome of this 
season's events, seem to be accep­
ting an NIT bid gladly. 
"We would have liked to get into 

the NCAA's but we didn't, so the 
NIT is fine," says Howard. "Post­
season is post-season. We feel go­
ing into the NIT like we can win 
that." 
The Irish will have a bit of a wait though. NIT action doesn't begin until a week from Wednesday (March 14), with first round games scheduled for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. The Irish will almost certainly get a first round game at home and the band is 
Amantea, who finished the game with 31 saves. Lukenda turned away 23 shots for Notre Dame. 
Neither team could score in the opening period, but each had some chances and the momentum gradually picked up as the stanza went on. 
Just 37 seconds into the second period, tournament MVP Paul Warden walked in all alone on Lukenda and beat him with a quick wrist shot to the glove side to put the Cyclones on the board first. 
It was Warden again at 6:09 tallying for Iowa State after he found himself all alone on the Notre Dame blueline where he knocked down a deflected pass and went in to capitalize on another breakaway. 
"We made a couple of key mistakes that cost us some goals," said Smith. 
Trailing 2-0, co-captain Brent 

Chapman got the Irish attack going when he beat amantea on a breakaway goal of his own at 10:48. Jenking goal at 13:24 put Iowa State up 3-1. Chapman's second goal of the night on a powerplay at 7:47 of the final period pulled the Irish within striking distance at 3-2. Bowie and Adam Parsons had the assists. Scott Breitenfeldt then escaped the swarming last-minute Notre Dame attack and iced the victory for the Cyclones when he hit the empty Irish net with just two seconds remaining. In Saturday's consolatiOn game, Marquette won a 6-4 victory from Illinois State. Notre Dame concludes its season with a 23-5-1 mark. Tourney win­ner Iowa State goes home at 10-12­
0. Marquette finished at 15-13 and Illinois State, 14-15.

Dayton upsets Notre Dame during second half snooze by Irish offense 

By JEI'F BLUMB 
Assistant Sports Editor 
DAYTON, Ohio -It could have been a replay of the Brigham Young game -or the Rutgers game -or the South Carolina game -or .. 
But this time it was the Dayton game, and the Notre Dame men's basketball team once again disintegrated in the second half Saturday, losing to the Flyers, 80­70. 
Irish coach Digger Phelps must be having some nasty nightmares these days. To see your team play well in the first half time after time, only to come apart at the scams in the second half when the game is on the line, must cause more than a bad dream or two. 
"This is one thing we have trouble with on the road. We always seem to struggle in the last lO minutes," said Phelps, who was visibly upset with the officiating of referees Phil Bova and Tom Rucker all day, so much that the Irish coach was mov­ed to chase after the two and con­front them in the tunnel afterward. 
"I just asked them if they wanted to look at tapes sometime," Phelps said of the post-game confronta­tion that saw heated words traded between the two parties. 
Phelps surely had something of a nightmare Saturday night after watching his team that afternoon. After streaking to an impressive 37­29 halftime lead, Notre Dame let Dayton crawl back into the game by losing the inside domination it

Irish fall to Cyclones 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team's bid for a playoff championship came up short Saturday night as the Irish fell to the Iowa State Cyclones, 4-2. 
Notre Dame reached the finals by virtue of a 10-2 thrashing of Il­linois State on Friday. Iowa State grabbed what turned out to be a come-from-behind 11-6 victory from the Warriors of Marquette in its Friday contest. 
Three seemed to be the lucky number for the Cyclones as it was Dan Jenkin's bank shot from the side of the crease off goalie Tim Lukenda's skate at the 13:24 mark of the second period that put Iowa State up 3-1 and proved to be the winner. 
The Saturday night meeting marked the third encounter between the two teams this season. Notre Dame had taken 4-3 and 6-4 decisions back in January when the teams squared off in Ames, Iowa. 
As for the Irish, luck just wasn't on their side as numerous scoring chances ended in disappointment. 
"We couldn't beg, borrow or steal a goal," said Notre Dame coach Lefty Smith. "Every time we came close, the bounces went the other way." 
The third period was probably the most frustrating for Notre Dame. Several excellent scoring chances were thwarted when passes were deflected at the last second or when rebounds came out to the one side where no Irish skaters were around to knock them home. The goalpost also worked in favor of the Cyclones on several occasions during the game. 
What was perhaps the closest Irish scoring play cam just after the midway point of period three when co-captain Joe Bowie's blast from

had  maintained  throughout  the  
first half.  
The  Irish  outrcbounded  the  

Flyers by a 20-6 margin in the first half and did not allow Dayton a single offensive board in the initial twenty minutes. Notre Dame was taking the ball to the hoop well and it showed on the scoreboard. 
Trailing 49-47, the Flyers were able to twice steal the ball and feed their all-time leading scorer Roosevelt Chapman for easy points, giving them the lead and momentum. It was off to the races for Dayton the rest of the way. 
Guard Sedric Toney rattled off 17 second half points after getting on­ly six in the first half and having all kinds of trouble controlling Irish point guard Joe Howard. 
"You've got to give Sedric a lot of credit. He had a nightmarish first half and then just turned it 
nuts." 
"I just did what I had to do," said Toney. "I got psyched up a little bit more for the second half." 
Tom Sluby did all he could to keep Notre Dame in the game, scor­ing 16 of his game-high 30 points in the second stanza. Sluby seemed to answer each Dayton basket with one of his own for about a five !,Ilinute stretch beginning with

Rejuvenated defense spurs Irish to upset top-ranked Lady Flyers 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Editor 
DAYTON, Ohio -The Notre 
Dame women's basketball team is 
beginning to show the same pro­
mise it showed at the end of last 
season when it won its last six 
games, and Saturday's 63-57 win 
over Dayton is a good example. 
The Lady Flyers entered the game with a 25-2 record, the No. !­ranking in the country in Division II, and a highly-potent offense that had been averaging more than 90 points a game at home. They had also been outscoring their op­ponents by about 20 points each game. 
On the other hand, the Irish had been having their difficulties on defense this season. Not that they had been a poor defensive team, but they were not as tenacious defensively as Mary DiStanislao ­coached teams of the past have been. Add to this the fact that Notre Dame was a poor 3-7 on the road and its chances against the Flyers did not look good. 
However, Saturday's perfor­mance was, in some respects, Notre Dame's best of the season. While the Irish did commit 28 turnovers (many of them because of ques­tionable traveling calls), they also forced Dayton into 25 turnovers of its own. Thanks to these turnovers, good rebounding, and tight coverage, they held the Flyers to their lowest point total of the season. 
"I'm real happy with the team's defense," said DiStanislao. "Defense has been a sore spot for us all year, so it was nice to have a good defensive game for a change. 
"This was a great win for us because Dayton's an excellent team. Who cares that they're Divi­
< 

sion II? They're an outstanding Division I team. It's a real good shot in the arm for us." 
The win was also significant because it was Notre Dame's third in a row -the first time this year that the Irish have won more than two straight. Now, with two games remaining, Notre Dame has won five of its last six to bring it record to 13-13, the first time it has reach­ed the .500 mark since it was 4-4. 
The Irish had to put together a solid, consistent effort to hold off the Flyers who wer getting a good deal of help from the referees. Despite the fact that the home team was whistled for only one foul in the entire first half, the Irish were able to hang onto a slim 27-24 lead when the teams went to the locker­room. 
Capitalizing on the outstanding inside play of center Mary Beth Schueth who grabbed six rebounds in the half and some good outside shooting by Trena Keys, the Irish were able to take a 12-10 lead 10 minutes into the game -a lead which they never lost. 
As Notre Dame widened its lead to eight in the second half, it ap­peared that DiStanislao's strategy for defensing the Flyers was work­ing. By collapsing on Dayton's two major inside threats, forward Donna Burks and 6-5 center Theresa Yingling, the Irish were taking away a good chunk of the Dayton offense. 
Although Burks ended up with 19 points and seven rebounds, she was held to below her average in both categories (21.4 points and 
11.1 rebounds a game). Meanwhile, Yingling was held to just five points. 
The Flyers made one last run at the Irish lead, however, as they cut the margin to just one, 45-44 with 8:15 remammg. However, Lynn Ebben hit a shot from outside and Keys completed a three-point play to increase the lead to six, and Dayton could get no closer than four the rest of the way. 
The Notre Dame rebounding in the secon d half was a major factor as the Irish outrebounded the Flyers 23-18 in the half, despite the fact that Dayton had been outre­bounding its competition by more than eight rebounds a game. Schueth, Keys and Lavetta Willis led the Notre Dame inside play with 26 rebounds between them. 
Schueth and Keys also led the scoring attack with 14 and II points, respectively, while Vonnie Thompson dished off a team-high five assists. 
IRISH ITEMS -Notre Dame will get a chance to clinch a .500 record when it travels to Loyola-Chicago on Thursday. The Ramblers have clinched the North Star Conference title and should provide plenty of competition for the improving Irish.
