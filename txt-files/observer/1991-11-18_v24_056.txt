The number of international students at the University of Notre Dame has doubled over the last ten years, according to a report from Arthur Grubert, Notre Dame's director of inter­national student affairs. 
By looking through Notre Dame's enrollment records, Grubert found that 699 interna­tional students from 66 nations are enrolled at Notre Dame for the 1991-92 school year. 
In comparison, during the 1981-82 academic year, the student body contained only 304 foreign students. 
According to Grubert, Notre Dame does not actively recruit international students; Notre Dame's worldwide reputation draws hundreds of foreign ap­plieations each year. 
International students yearn to study in the United States be­cause "a U.S. education is highly valued" by foreign com­panies, says Grubert. 
The first foreign student en­rolled at Notre Dame in 1929, according to Grubert. and the numbers have continued to grow.

Report: U.S., Allies guilty of violations in Gulf War 
NICOSIA, CYPRUS (AP) -The United States and its allies caused needless civilian deaths during the Persian Gulf War with indiscriminate bombings while projecting an image of "squeaky clean" war, a human right<; group says. 
Middle East Watch, in a re­port to be released today, says the allies violated international conventions by, among other things. bombing during the daytime, using bombs less pre­cise than they had to, and choosing targets that worsened food shortages and the health conditions of eivilians. 
The report, made available to the A<;sociated Press in Nicosia, also faults the allies for the si­lence they maintained about civilian casualties in Iraq, de­spite "persuasive evidence" of the bloodshed. 
Middle East Watch estimates that 2,500-3,000 Iraqi civilians died as a direct result of bomb­ings, but did not give an esti­mate of those who died due to disease or starvation connected with the bombing of civilian fa­cilities. 
"During the war, military briefs emphasized repeatedly the allies observance of the rules of war and persistently projected the image of a squeaky clean bombing cam­paign," the report says. 
The 402-page document, ti­tled "Needless Deaths In The Gulf War," was meant to "break through this carefully constructed image of a near­flawless allied campaign," says the New York-based group. 
In Washington, Pentagon spokeswoman Jan Walker said, "If we feel the allegations war­rant a response, we will make one. The air war was conducted

Duke defeated in Louisiana election 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) ­Democrat Edwin Edwards re­soundingly defeated former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke on Saturday, reclaiming the governorship he had lost in disgrace. The election riveted national attention on Louisiana, where many voters saw the contest as a tragic choice between a racist and a rogue. 
With 98 percent of the precincts reporting, Edwards had 1,056,090 votes, or 61 per­cent, to Duke's 674,548, or 39 percent. Turnout set a record for a Louisiana election-more than 75 percent of the state's 
2.2 million voters. 
Duke, a Republican state rep­resentative, was repudiated by most state and national GOP leaders, including President Bush, because of his white supremacist background. In addition to leading the Klan, he at one time publicly embraced Nazi ideology. 
Edwards, claiming victory before jubilant supporters at his headquarters, declared: "Tonight, Louisiana became first, first to turn back the merchant of hate, the master of deceit.

"The candidate may have lost," he told disappointing but cheering campaign workers. "but the message goes out loud and clear across Louisiana and across the country...The time has come to begin to heal the liberal welfare system that is causing crime, causing poverty, causing drugs, destroying the very basis of our lives." 
Speaking of his future in poli­tics. Duke, whose term in the Legislature expires this year, said, "I have no plans-no plans to run for any other offiee. But I have to say 'at this time.'" There has been speculation he might run for Congress, the Senate, or challenge Bush in some GOP presidential pri­maries next year.

Church static as world changes

The world around us is editor transforming. Today's college student has witnessed monumental changes and events which will fill the pages of our children's history books. 
Still, it seems as if the adage "The more things change, the more they stay the same" holds true for an important aspect of our generations lives-the Church. 
The typical American Catholic college-age student has lived with a Church that has been fairly static. We never experienced "what was really like" living in the pre-Vatican II Church. 
Our generation has lived its whole life in the post-Vatican II era without much religious change. 
Yet in this period of constancy in the Church, the world has changed dramatically. 
A feeling has developed among our genera­tion that the Church refuses to move into the present times. It is as if the Church does not want to adapt to a changing social agenda -­the reality in our world of AIDS, divorce and the like. 
The general feeling of the generation to­ward the Church is one of frustration -­frustration of a generation trying to live with a post-Vatican II Church run by a pre-Vatican II mind-set. 
Unfortunately, the American Church will probably splinter all too soon into fragments without addressing our generation about fundamental issues, such as: 
•Married 
priests. By limiting the priesthood to unmarried men, the Church sends a message to a large segment of its membership that they are not fit to carry out the formal message of Jesus. 

•Female 
priesthood. On what basis {beside the old standard one of "Tradition") can the Church continue to refuse women the opportunity to serve the Church in the priesthood? 

•Social 
and life issues. Divorce, abortion, euthanasia, and the big one --birth control. These issues all too often cause feelings of abandonment from the Church. 

•Church 
leadership. Why does the general Church membership have essentially no say where the Church is moving? The Church continues to be a male-dominated conserva­tive body. Furthermore, one often wonders whether the Church is for members or are members for the Church. 


It goes without saying that the Church does have official teachings about these issues. But, when was the last time you have heard a homily at Sunday Mass about birth control or abortion? 
It seems as if the Church is content to re­main with its static ideology in this era of social change in the world. Our generation cannot hold our frustration with the Church for failing to address the agenda which faces us is wrong. 
Instead, the generation must stand up and bring these frustrations to the attention of our Church.

or-Salvadorans are reluctant to entertain the vision of peace conjured up by an insurgent cease-fire for fear their hopes will be shattered. Almost without fail, Salvadorans reacted to the unilateral rebel truce that began Saturday with some semblance of hope. Their next reactions, however, were skeptical. Many Salvadorans expressed the common beliefthat the war has become "a business" for sectors of the armed forces loath to see it end. Armed forces spokesmen said there were no reports of combat after midnight Friday when the guerrilla truce took effect. Attempts to negotiate solutions to the war floundered in 1984, 1986, 1987, 1989 amid recriminations. Though the current U.N.-mediated peace talks have been by far the most fruitful, there is a deep-rooted reluctance to allow hopes to rise too high.

Pro-democracy rally sparks violence 
•NAIROBI, Kenya-Security forces used tear gas, bullets and clubs Saturday to disperse thousands of protesters following the arres~s of opposition leaders seeking to hold a banned pro-democracy rally. The government accused U.S. diplomats of having "m41sterminded and abetted" the opposition movement and expressed its "great concern and utter dismay." Saturday's unrest largely was contained in an area around the eastern Nairobi site of Saturday's proposed pro-democracy rally. It did not develop into the widespread riots that took place when police used similar force to break up a similarly banned meeting in July 1990. Later in the day, however, mobs threw stones at police and motorist in a nearby low-income district called Eastleigh. Security forces retaliated with rubber bullets and volleys of tear gas. The United States has called the crackdown a "blatant interference in civil and human rights."

Yugoslav victory in Croatia dooms truce 
ZAGHEB, Yugoslavia (AP) ­Victorious federal forees hoisted Yugoslav nags Saturday over a key part of the defense around besieged Vukovar, dealing a stinging battlefield blow to Croatia as the latest cease-fire deadline passed. 
It appeared the fall of Borovo Naselje, a village just north of Vukovar on the Danube River, and lighting in Vukovar itself doomnd the truce, just like the previous dozen. 
The European Community and the United Nations, both seeking an end to Europe's bloodiest conflict since World War II, have said that a firm cease-lire must be established before any peacekeeping troops are sent. 
Both Croatia and the federal army have agreed to permit a peacekeeping force, but have established different conditions. 
Army and Croatian officials met in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, on Saturday to discuss relief shipments to besieged Croatian cities including Vukovar and the withdrawal of the army from barracks in the republic. No agreements were reached. 
After the 6 p.m. (noon EST) cease-fire deadline, heavy fighting was reported to be continuing in Vukovar, a city that has become a potent em­blem of Croatia's defense against the Yugoslav army and Serbian insurgents opposed to Croatia's June 25 declaration of independence. 
Thousands of people are liv­ing in basements because Vukovar has been almost leveled in the three-month 
·siege. Serb-led forces are said 
to be no more than 200 yards 
from Vukovar's center. 
Machine-gun fire rattled and tracer bullets also flashed Saturday evening over parts of Dubrovnik-another besieged stronghold on Croatia's south­ern Adriatic coast, Croatian TV reported. 
Croatia's Foreign Ministry forwarded a letter from Vukovar's Gov. Marin Vidic-Bili to President Bush, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and several U.S. congressmen ask­ing for "help before it's too late." 
Croatian radio said the letter warned that the fall of Vukovar "could spark a series of changes in European borders that could plunge all of Europe into a bloody conflict." 
Croatian defense officials confirmed a report by the Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency that Borovo Naselje was in the hands of the army and Serb insurgents. 
Croatian officials in Zagreb reported that shelling died down on several other battle­fronts soon after the cease-fire deadline passed.

Klan camp to give· America 'a thousand' David Dukes

Breast implants allowed by FDA for now 
WASHINGTON (AP) -A Food and Drug Administration advi­sory committee last week rec­ommended that silicone-gel breast implants be allowed to remain on the market while studies continue to determine their safety. 
Here are answers to some commonly asked questions about these kinds of breast im­plants and the FDA's regulation of them: 
•Are silicone-gel breast im­plants safe? 
The FDA advisory panel overwhelmingly concurred that none of four implant manufac­turers seeking FDA approval had submitted scientific data sufficient to prove their safety. 
However, as panel Chairwoman Elizabeth Connell, a professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University in Atlanta, said: "This does not mean that we found evidence that the implants are unsafe. Instead, we found that there was not enough information to be certain about risks and ben­efits, one way or the Qther." 
The risks include hardening of tissue surrounding the im­plant, infection, bleeding, rup­ture of the implant and leakage of silicone inter the body. Questions have been raised about whether the implants can cause autoimmune disorders or cancer and whether they inter­fere with mammography tests. 
•These implants have been on the market for nearly 30 years. Why is the FDA just reviewing them now? 
The implants were already on the market when FDA was given authority to regulate them in 1976. The devices were "grandfathered" under the law, which allowed them to remain commercially available until the FDA reviewed them. 
In 1982, the FDA proposed putting breast implants in a regulatory category that would require manufacturers to prove they were safe and effective. The agency finalized that pro­posal in 1988. 
The FDA told manufacturers to submit their safety data by July 9, 1991, and the agency has until Jan. 6 to review it. The advisory committee, an outside ' panel of experts, was convened to help the agency in that re­view. 
• Does the FDA have to accept the advisory committee's recommendations? 
The panel's recommendations aren't binding, though the agency usually follows the advice of such committees. 

If the FDA follows the panel's advice in this case, it could ex­tend the Jan. 6 deadline to al­low the implant makers more time to collect data. The com­mittee, as a group, did not rec­ommend specific,controls or conditions of such an extension. Those would be determined by the FDA. 
• What is the FDA's next step? 

The_ FDA said Friday in a summary of the panel's meeting that the recommendations "will be given a great deal of consideration in the agency's decisions." 
At the start of the meeting last Tuesday, FDA Commissioner David Kessler promised he would require manufacturers to provide the information needed to answer safety questions because these devices have been implanted in more than 2 million women. And he said the FDA would take into account the benefits of the devices. 
• Why do women get the im­plants? 
About 150,000 silicone breast implants are implanted each year, about 80 percent of them in healthy women who want larger breasts and about 20 percent in breast cancer pa­tients after surgery.

Hailing Duke's defeat, Republican National Committee Chairman Clayton Yeutter said in Washington that the voters of Louisiana "with one pull of the lever. today struck a mighty blow against racism. bigotry and hatred. 
"... While we at the Republican National Committee do not celebrate a victory for the Democrats." Yeutter said in a statement, "we do happily ac­cept the voters of Louisiana's decisions to push away David Duke, whose ruse did not suc­ceed." 
Edwards captured majorities of the vote in areas where Duke had to do well, including parishes-taken by Duke in the Oct. 19 primary. In the largest parishes, Orleans and East Baton Rouge, Edwards swamped Duke. 
Duke had called East Baton Rouge a pivotal parish and said he had to at least split the vote. With 162 of 243 precincts re­porting, Edwards had 58,840 to 32,018 for Duke. 
Duke also lost his home parish of Jefferson. In the ma­jority-black Orleans parish, which includes the city of New Orleans, Edwards had 41, 087 votes in partial returns to Duke's 5,336. 
Duke was doing well in the rural parishes of north Louisiana, which was expected. But two-thirds of the state's population is in south Louisiana.

shooting might not have been prevented. 
The incident adds to the growing concern about safety in the Northeast Neighborhood. 
A male Notre Dame student and St. Mary's student were robbed by suspects claiming to have guns outside The Commons Oct. 27. Three days later, three Notre Dame stu­dents were robbed at gunpoint on Notre Dame Ave.

The report evaluates allied conduct under the laws of war, primarily the standards of the First Additional Protocol of 1977 to the 1949 Geneva con­ventions. 
It says the allies' overwhelm­ing air superiority and the pre­cision of their weaponry pro­vided an "exceptional opportu­nity" to conduct the bombing campaign in a manner that would avoid civilian casualties. 
But despite the allies' legal obligation to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties, the report says, "The actual conduct of the war fell short of this obligation in several significant respects." 
tried to convince voters they had reformed, abandoned their past and atoned for earlier indiscretions. 

The campaign, with its explo­sive racial and political implica­tions, drew attention around the world-and sent ripples of fear throughout the nation, especially among blacks, Jews and Republicans. 
Bush and other national polit­ical leaders of both parties de­nounced Duke, as did Louisiana's business, labor and political establishment. But some political experts, gauging the disenchantment of Louisiana's voters, said those denunciations only helped Duke's cause. 
Pre-election polls showed Edwards leading, and Duke be­gan a last-minute attack renew­ing old accusations that Edwards sold jobs in previous administrations. Edwards said the payments were campaign contributions legal at the time. 
The winner received an en­thusiastic reception from mid­dle-class white voters frus­trated by decade of recession in the oil-dependent state. 
Edwards led the field in the state's Oct. 19 open primary. Incumbent Gov. Buddy Roemer, a Republican, placed third. Edwards drew 34 percent to Duke's 32 percent and Roemer's 26 percent. 
Edwards, 64, was governor 12 years, 1972-80 and 1984-88. A silverhaired French speaker, he was credited with many suc­cesses, from farsighted re­structuring of oil and gas taxa­tion to keeping the New Orleans Saints football franchise from moving to Florida.

The nation with the most ND students is China with 113 stu­dents enrolled this year. India follows with 58 students, and Canada runs a distant third with 29 students at Notre Dame. 
According to Grubert, 80 per­cent of the international stu­dents at Notre Dame are in­volved in graduate studies. 
"Between 16-17 percent of the graduate students" and "less than 1 percent" of the un­dergraduate population are in­ternational students, says Grubert. 
Grubert says that although he has not yet noticed a large rise in the number of Eastern European students at Notre Dame, he does expect to see an increase over the next few years. 
This is the first year that a Romanian student has attended Notre Dame, and there is a student from the newly-inde­pendent nation of Lithuania as well. 

There are also 12 students from Germany, including one from what was once East Germany.

Royal Oak postal workers face loss 
HOYAL OAK, Mich. (API -WorktJrs sorted letters through tears Saturday as the post office where a fired employee killed four supervisors reopened for business. 
"You feel kind of funny walk­ing around the building," said Elaine Washington. a clerk who called police from the customer counter Thursday when Thomas Mcllvane opened lire. 
Bob Fisher, who was trans­f'tJrred Friday from St. Paul, Minn., to replace the Royal Oak postmaster, said his first order of business will be getting em­ployees to talk about the vio­lence. 
"The most important thing is the communication, the listen­ing, the understanding," said Fishtlr, a 30-year U.S. Postal Service employee. "Its' going to be a long healing process." 
Four supervisors were killed and live workers wounded in the attack by Mcllvane, -who shot himself and later died. Three other workers were hurt trying to flee the 31-year-old gunman. 
Fisher, 54, replaces Dan 
Presilla, who took a voluntary paid leave of absence. 
A uniformed guard greeted employees at the door where Mcllvane is said to have entered with a sawed-off .22-caliber ri­fle. Passers-by left flowers at the base of a flag pole.

AMIIERST, Mass. (API ­Striking graduate assistants at the University of Massachusetts say they're employees first, students second. Administrators say state Jaw puts things the other way around. 
It's an issue that students, educators, government officials and sometimes courts are thrashing out in battles around the country. 
Just last month, New York state's Public Employment Relations Board recognized the union for graduate students who want to represent teaching assistants in that state's uni­versity system. 
The question now lies at the vortex of a strike launched last week by hundreds of graduate teaching and research assis­tants at the 23,000-student campus here, the state systems' largest. 

The strike has forced cancel­lation of many classes, soured relations between students and administrators and threatened to worsen the school's already severe financial problems. 
The Graduate Employee Organization has demanded the university collect mandatory union fees from all graduate employees-in effect recogniz­ing the group as a bona fide union. 
The administration says it can't legally demand fees for a non-certified group, thought it wouldn't oppose a certification bid to the state Labor Relations Commission. 
N.Y.C. pqlice rid subway of homeless 
NEW YORk (AP) -The dank, dark subway tunnels that criss­cross New York City are filled with rats, garbage and feces-and hundreds of people who call the tunnels home. 
But many subway residents-who live in what some call shelters of last resort-were back above ground today as police carried out the latest of a series of efforts to get the city's thousand of homeless people into government-run shelters. 
The first evictions took place Friday night as police officers. picking their way carefully around the rats and garbage-and the subway's electrified third rail-began clearing out tunnels in Manhattan. 
The efforts to get the home­less to leave their public nesting places for shelters has drawn objections from homeless advocates who say the shelters are often more dangerous than subways, streets and public parks. 
Advocates opposed the June eviction of about 100 homeless people from Tompkins Square Park, on Manhattan's Lower East Side. 
The park, a haven for home­less for years, was then closed for renovations. Homeless ad­vocates have also protested plans to evict people from the city's Port Authority Bus Terminal. 
But Lt. John Homero, com­manding officer of the Transit Police's Homeless Outreach program, says no shelter could be worse than life in the tun­nels.

Democrats consider 'October Surprise' 
WASHINGTON (API -One of the central figures has been dead for four years, another for five. A third provides tantalizing clues that don't quite pan out. A fourth offers information that sounds too astounding to be true. 
Somehow, from a distance of a decade, Democrats in Congress hope to get to the bottom of the allegations that the 1980 Reagan-Bush cam­paign conspired to delay the re­lease of Americans held hostage in Iran. 
But in the so-called "October Surprise" investigation, the only thing that seems certain is that it won't be easy. 
To complicate it even further, Republicans oppose the probe Democrats are pushing, and the enterprise has taken on a partisan cast before it even be­gins. 
GOP lawmakers derisively re­fer to the investigation as "the October Surmise." 
"We have thought that if peo­ple were too anxious not to have this investigation, then perhaps we should have one," said Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., who with Rep. Lee Hamilton, D­IN.. has the task of leading the probe. 
For 11 years, rumors have persisted that the 1980 Hepublican campaign undercut President Carter's efforts to free the hostages, cutting their own deal to provide weapons to Tehran if the Americans were held until after Election Day-sealing Carter's defeat. 
If true, the charges border on treason and have mammoth implications for President Bush's re-election next year. 
If not, the decision by House Speaker Thomas Foley, D­Wash., and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D­Maine, to look into the mystery has exposed their party to ac­cusations of mounting a purely political vendetta against Bush, whose popularity has frustrated would-be opponents. 
The key allegations are that William Casey, Reagan's campaign manager; then-vice presidential candidate Bush; and Donald Gregg, now Bush's ambassador to South Korea, met with Iranian intermediaries in Madrid and Paris in the summer and fall of 1980. There, the allegation goes, they concluded the scheme to delay the hostage release. 
Bush has denied the allega­tions and his whereabouts on those days have been conclu­sively established. According to Secret Service r.ecords of his activities on those days, he was in Washington and on the cam­paign trail. ­
Several central players in the allegations have died. 
Casey, a veteran of World War II espionage who became head of the CIA, died in 1987. 
Cyrus Hashemi, an Iranian expatriate banker and deal-
maker who operated in the shadowy world of international arms trade and claimed knowl­edge of the meetings, died in 1986 after a brief and mysteri­ous illness. 

Many of those still available to investigators have serious credibility problems or only indirect knowledge of the al­leged events. 
Richard Brenneke, an Oregon businessman who claims CIA ties, has repeatedly offered in­formation that did not check out, and has changed his story when confronted with contra­dictions. 
Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, has put forth circumstantial evidence that some in his government were negotiating with the Republicans, but his informa­tion is vague and filled with suppositions. 
Gary Sick, a former National Security Council aide who has investigated the charges, now has laid out the best case for the conspiracy theory in a new book, "October Surprise." 
Conceding his efforts were hampered by a lack of hard in­formation, Sick nonetheless concludes that the Reagan-Bush campaign set up its own spy network inside the Carter administration out of its des­perate fear of an "October Surprise" that would free the hostages and rescue Carter's campaign.

The Observer/Joe Fabbre Saint Mary's student Moira Lydon discussed the reactions of Canadian firms to the North American Free Trade Agreement at the Notre Dame Council on International Business Development Fall Forum Thursday. 
NDCIBD Fall Forum discusses North American Trade Agreement 
BY AMY MARK 
Business Writer 
Mexico, Canada and the United States share diverse views on the implications of the pending North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), said several students at the Notre Dame Council on International Business Development (NDCIBD) Fall Forum Thursday. 
Saint Mary's students Moira Lydon and Nicole Samarzija discussed their experiences in Toronto during fall break on a NDCIBD delegation. 
As delegation members, they discussed the impact of the NAFTA on many Canadians. 
According to a survey, 76 percent of Canadian citizens felt that the agreement would be detrimental to their country, Samarzija said. 
Fifty percent of Canada's pollution comes from U.S. industry near the border and people felt it would only make the acid rain problem more severe, she said. 
Although the citizens ex­pressed discontent about the NAFTA, businesses believe the agreement will ease ties among the countries, remove tariffs and quotas, increase tourism, and give Canadian companies access to inexpensive Mexican labor, Lydon said. 
Firms also believe that Canada must trade freely in order to be globally competitive, she added. 
Notre Dame senior Dustin Klinger said that the benefits and disadvantages of the trade agreement for the United States would cancel each other out. As a result of the NAFTA, Mexico would import U.S. meat and grains, and the United States would lose horticultural exports, such as citrus fruits, to Mexico. 
Klinger said that American unskilled or semi-skilled work­ers would lose jobs to Mexican labor. 
Under the NAFTA, Mexico will be given the challenge of quality control and will have to meet international standards for quality, said Notre Dame .senior Rob Corrao. 
Small corporations would re­quire consolidation and special­ization that would result in ef­ficiency for the firms, he said. He also discussed the potential for the NAFTA area to become the largest market in the world as a result of the agreement, even larger than the European Economic Community (EEC). 
"Mexican and foreign enter­prises located in Mexico that make substantial transforma­tions in their productive pro­cesses will be assured perma­nent access to the North Amer­ican market," Corrao said. 
Kwan Kim, a Notre Dame economics professor, said that the trade agreement formalized liberalization of trade among the United States, Mexico and Canada, much of which had al­ready been in effect. 
"The participating countries are asymmetric," said Kim. Canada currently makes up 10 percent of the U. S. gross na­tional product. On the other hand, Mexico only contributes 4 percent of the U.S. gross na­tional product, according to Kim. 
Hll discussed problems con­cerning different monetary policies and the United States' political motives for signing the agreement. 
Kim said that he does not ex­pect much change to arise from the NAFTA. However, he does foresee the definition of free trade to turn from laissez-faire to protectionist, especially con­cerning the United States "Europe was the kingmaker of free trade, but the U.S. could become the champion of free trade," Kim concluded.

Dear Editor: 
Approximately two months ago, I contacted the security of­fice to inquire about student parking in the faculty, staff, and reserved lots at night. The representative informed me that students could, in fact, park in these areas after 5 p.m. Last week, I parked in the rear lot of the post office to attend a late-night review session at the law school. My car was ticketed. 
The following day, I called the security office and explained my confusion. I was told that stud(mts may park in the faculty and staff lots at night but never in the reserved parking areas. No such distinction was made when I first contacted their office. I would not have parked in the area if the representative had told me I was not allowed to. 
The lot I parked in is used by the workers of the post office, which, oddly enough, is closed at night. When I questioned the rationale behind never allowing anyone else to park there, I was told that the lot was to be kept

clear for "late-night deliveries." 
The representative told me that I could appeal the ticket, but it must be in writing. The appeal forms were in the secu­rity office. The following day, I drove to the Campus Security Building and began to fill out their form. As I sat there, one of the women in the office glanced out the window and remarked, "Oh, look, there's a student ticketer right now." 
Phil Johnson, Assistant Di­rector of Security, then emerged from his office. I told him that I had parked outside of the office and asked, "I'm not going to get a ticket while I'm in here appealing a ticket, am I?" Mr. Johnson replied, "Well, I hope so." It took me a moment to realize that he was serious. 
I told him that there were no provisions for parking outside of the security building for people appealing tickets. He in­formed me that my provisions were in my designated lot, Cl. I asked if I understood him cor­rectly-! was to walk from my 
··•• 

"designated lot" near Senior bar, across an icy campus, on a blustery, wintry day, to the se­curity building to appeal a ticket. He replied, "That's within the rules." 
Mr. Johnson also helpfully suggested the half-hour parking by the post office. Let's see-a ten-minute walk there, a ten­minute walk back. If I did any­thing more than write my name on the appeal document, I am confident that I would return to my car to find another ticket waiting for me. 
Mr. Johnson's final remark was that I did not have to come to the office in the first place. The office could have mailed the form to me. Thank you for informing me of that when I phoned. 
It seems to me that someone in the Notre Dame Family has forgotten his manners. I was not treated like a customer, a client, or a person in need. Mr. Johnson was flippant and pa­tronizing. I did not expect to receive such harassment from someone whose role is to pro-
ensure that the advantages of an academic and social envi­ronment promoting the fullest possible intellectual, physical and social flourishing of every student are not denied to gays and lesbians because of their sexual orientation. 
P-FLAG-ND&SMC will promote discussion, research, and action by grandparents, parents, faculty, staff, alumni and students who consider 
teet me and my rights. I also did 
not expect to receive a second 
ticket while I was appealing my 
first one. 
After my second ticket expe­
rience, I contacted the golf 
shop. During my four under­
graduate years at Notre Dame, I 
have seen many golfers use the 
D6 lot near the security 
building. I inquired if special 
passes were given to them so 
their cars were not ticketed. I 
was informed that they gave no 
special passes and that they 
have not had a problem. 
I also decided to test the va­.lidity of the "late-night delivery" 
reason for keeping the rear post 
office lot empty at night. It 
seems that post office workers 
use the lot between the hours of 
4 a.m. and 5 p.m. There are no 
deliveries at other times. 
Even if the fictitious "late­
night deliveries" did exist, why 
would parked cars impede the 
process any more than those 
parked there during the day? 
Many students, especially law 
students, use the library 
facilities throughout the night. 

GARRY TRUDEAU QUOTE OF THE DAV 
Why not let us make use of these spots which are close to the law school, well-lit, and ap­parently unused at night? 
The whole purpose of my original telephone call to secu­rity was to ensure that I under­stood the rules correctly so I could follow them. I was not trying to "beat the system." I am willing and able to follow rules if they are correctly ex­plained to me. However, we create and follow rules because they are functional. A rule that serves no purpose or does not benefit those who it is intended to benefit is anobstacle, not a rule. 
More importantly, I was not treated with the respect I de­serve. My years at the Univer­sity of Notre Dame have helped me realize the importance of being sensitive to others, the need for justice for everyone, and, most of all, the significance of the Notre Dame Family.

Local man holds the title of best Elvis impersonator in the world 
By TIM ROGERS 
Accent Writer 

It was a big night in Decatur, Michigan. The marquee outside the Penny Lane Pub read: 
TONIGHT ELVIS AND ALL YOU CAN EAT FISH $4.95 
Inside, men with handlebar mustaches and tattoos on their forearms filled the joint. Pre­sumably having eaten all the fish their bellies could hold, they eagerly awaited the King. They were not disappointed. 
Elvis took the stage shortly after 9 p.m. He wore a bell-bottomed, black jumpsuit with a cape. His manly sideburns framed his royal visage. lie crooned like only the King can and shook his hips. He worked the smoke­filled joint into a frenzy and ladies swooned. The mustached men drank beer. 
Between sets, Elvis mingled with his adoring fans, and up close, the King didn't look like himself. Maybe it was the lighting, but he seemed a little thinner than his velvet likeness. Well, it turns out that the King is an imposter and his real name is Doug Church. 
Church is a full­time Elvis im­personator who lives in South Bend. He also happens to be the number one Elvis -Doug Church impersonator in ------------------------------~-------the country. He 
won the distinction last August at the World Wide Elvis Impressionists contest in Memphis, Tennessee. He competed against 50 other Elvises who journeyed to Graceland from as far away as Japan. 
The Japanese Elvis didn't exactly have the right stuff to be the King, according to Church. "Because of his heritage, he didn't look much like Elvis," he says. 
Church took first place with his renditions "I Got a Woman," "Pork Salad Annie" (Church's personal favorite), "Release Me," and "How Great Thou Art." For his effort, 



The Observermm Rogers Doug Church, a resident of South Bend, strikes a pose during a recent performance in Decatur, Michigan. Church was recently named the number one Elvis impersonator in the world. 
Church took home a big first place trophy, some cash and two round-trip airline tickets to anywhere in the U.S. 
As would be expected, Church didn't just wake up one morning and decide to be Elvis. The triumph in Graceland came only after years of dedication and Church's single­minded drive to be the best Elvis he could be. In June, he quit his side job as a car wash manager so he could concentrate on his lip quiver and pelvic thrust. 
His quest for the crown began 10 years ago as a sergeant in the Air Force when Church entered a talent contest. He went on to win first place in the entire European command with his Elvis impersonator. 
From there, Elvis' soul gradually crept into Church. He made the transition from peas­ant to king by studying videos of Elvis and by cultivating a jelly doughnut physique. · 
The transition was recently made complete when Church decided to chuck his wig and fake sideburns for pragmatic reasons: Church tells a story about the time he was late for a gig, hurriedly styling his wig while it sat on his head. With a careless coif, he flipped the piece off his head and into the toilet. 
Real hair cuts down on prep time, but Church says that looking like Elvis 24 hours a day can get tedious. "Sometimes I feel like shaving these sideburns ofT," he says. 
When he goes to the grocery store, people tend to stare. "Sometimes it's annoying and sometimes it's invigorating," Church says. "It depends on my mood. A guy will ask me, 'Anybody ever tell you that you look like Elvis?' 'Not in the last 20 minutes,' I tell him." 
The burden of constantly sporting the King's likeness even wrecked Church's Hal­loween. The man with the perfect costume, all ready to go, opted to instead stay home. "I wear the suit enough. I didn't feel like throwing it on for Halloween," says Church. 
Missing out on trick-or-treating is a small price to pay for having the enviable job of number one Elvis. Church says that imitating Elvis allows him carry on the good will and generous heart of the King. 
"The main reason I like to do Elvis is because he was a charitable human being," says Church. "I'm not going to be just another Elvis impersonator. My overriding. goal is to do charitable works in the spirit of Elvis." 
Church belongs to the International Association of Elvis Presley Impersonators (IAEPI), an organization dedicated to helping orphaned and homeless children. The IAEPI has an extensive Elvis network that spans the country. Member Elvises send the organization money that they collect from raffies held at their performances. 
"It's a simple plan to help the kids," says Church, "and other Elvis impersonators are catching wind of what's going on." 
Church says that rumors about Elvis being alive hinder the IAEPI's work. 
"That's the kind of thing that hurts our organization-the craziAs, the whackos, the 'National Enquirer.'" They give Elvis a humorous connotation that hurts us," Church says. 
Church admits that he can't see himself with big sideburns forever. From car wash manager to Elvis impersonator, it's all part of a carefully orchestrated career plan. 
"The Elvis thing is just a launching pad," Church says. "I'll branch out. I can do 65 character imitations. But I'll do it as long as people want to hear it." He adds that it's gratifying to have his family see that he has made something of himself. 
If you want to catch the King's act, he dons his jumpsuit and swivels his hips at Daniel's Den in the Ramada Inn, 52890 U.S. 31 North, on November 29. Bring the whole family and don't forget to wear your blue suede shoes.

the Nittany Lions for the second straight time. 
Notre Dame took over on their own 30-yard line with 4:35 left in the half. Running with a vengeance, Tony Brooks busted through the line, breaking tackles for a 12-yard gain. 
Two plays later, Mirer then hit flanker Ray Griggs for 15 more, moving the Irish to the Penn State 26-yard line. Tony Smith found a seam in the Lion defense, and caught a Mirer strike for 15 additional yards. 
This set the Irish up with a first-and-ten from the 11. Bettis took the ball over right tackle for a very small gain. After a procedure call, the Irish were faced with a second-and-14 from the Lion 15. 
Tony Smith then caught a screen in the right flat and scampered to the Lion two be­fore being dragged down by safety Lee Rubin. After a time­out, the Irish tried to punch Jerome Bettis for the needed one yard, but he was met solidly by the Lion defense. 
With only 26 seconds until half, Notre Dame called timeout again, and talked over a fourth­and-one play. With a full house backfield, Rick Mirer sprinted left and threw at an open Rod Culver. Culver reached in desperation for Mirer's high offering, but he could not manage to control it. 
What could have been a mo­mentum shift to the Irish, ended up as the proverbial straw that broke this team's back. 
"This is not the type of team you want to try and play catch­up on," said coach Lou Holtz. "You score there, and you've got some momentum-it's 21­14, and you're going to get the football."

Swim teams come away from Ball State meet with mixed results 
By JASON KELLY 
Sports Writer 
There was some good news on the Irish sports scene this weekend as the women's swim team defeated Ball State for the first time ever, 141-123. 
The men's team wasn't as fortunate, however, dropping its third meet of the season, 128­115, to a tough Cardinal team. 
Jenny Dahl, Cara Garvey, Tanya Williams and Becky Wood won two events each as the Irish cruised past Ball State on the way to their sixth win of the season against only one loss. 
"To go down there and beat them for the first time was re­ally exciting," freshman Amy Bethem commented. 
It was an equally exciting meet on the men's side despite the disappointing result. 
"It was a tough loss," junior John Godfrey explained, "but it was a good meet that went right down to the wire." 

The men boasted some im­pressive individual perfor­mances, led by Mike Keeley's pair of first place finishes in the 1,000-yard freestyle and the 200-yard butterfly. Godfrey collected a win in the 200-yard backstroke, while the 400-yard medley relay team of Godfrey, Bruce Emery, Andrew Kiley and Matt Gibbons also came out on top. 
"I think we're very strong in the (individual medley) and dis­tance freestyle," said senior co­captain Jim Birmingham. "We have a challenge in the sprint and middle distance, but I think we're up to it." 
Both teams will face a tough challenge next weekend as they travel to the University of Illinois to face Kansas, Southern Illinois, Purdue, Illinois State and Northwestern in the three­day event. 
The women are heading into next weekend's meet with a great deal of confidence, and they cite their closeness as the main reason for their success. 
"Our team unity and support for each other is definitely the main strength of this team," Bethem explained. 
Despite dropping their record to 5-3 with the loss to Ball State, the men also appear con­fident as they prepare for next weekend's meet, largely be­cause some injuries depleted their lineup for Saturday's meet. 
"We would have won hands down if we had everybody healthy," Godfrey said. 
If the men heal their wounds and the women continue their winning ways, each team should pose quite a threat to their opposition. 
Holtz brushes aside rumors of departure 
By ANTHONY KING 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Coach Lou Holtz dispelled the rumors that he would not be at Notre Dame next year. 
"I hate to disappoint the Notre Dame people, but I'm going be at Notre Dame next year," said Holtz. "All I want to do is get the thing rectified at Notre Dame. Nothing else, pe­riod." 
Holtz is extremely anxious to get back and start working for 1992. "We will start 1992 on Monday," he said. "We're going back to spring practice and preparing for '92, getting back to the basic fundamentals. We just have to do that." 
Jerome Bettis tied the Irish single-season touchdown mark with his 18th touchdown. It came in the second quarter on his two yard run over right tackle. Bettis is also nearing 1,000 yards rushing for the season. Bettis rushed for 53 yards on 12 carries in

The break that may have changed the entire course of Notre Dame's season was the blocked field goal in the Tennessee game. Not only did it lead to the comeback of the Volunteers, but the injury to Craig Hentrich was one of the most costly in the sense that it affected so many facets of the game. 
The pass that got away at Penn State was another chance for the Irish to get a good break, after being down 21-0. But, as the tale of this season goes, it was not to be. 
"You get down, and you're on the road, and you fight your way back and you get back into the ballgame," said a disap­pointed Holtz. "You get close, and it just sort of disinte­grates."

Kicker Kevin Pendergast kicked the opening kickoff for the Irish. Pendergast is a junior on the Notre Dame soccer team that had never played for a competitive football team be­fore. 
He walked on the team this week when Holtz auditioned several soccer players on Wednesday. Pendergast had wanted to walk on in 1993 when his soccer eligibility was 
Penn State should be given proper credit. They made their own breaks, as they played tough defense and were consis­tent on offense. O.J. McDuffie, Tony Sacca, and Richie Anderson were the driving force behind the Lion offense. They converted on 9-of-15 third down attempts, and McDuffie and Sacca used the big play to put the game out of reach. Anderson also played a stellar game, rushing for 142 yards on 26 carries, and two touch­downs. Without their contribu­tions, Penn State isn't the same offensively. 
"They're better than anybody we've played since I went down to Miami two years ago," com­mented Rick Mirer 
used up. The junior from Con­necticut is majoring in envi­ronmental engineering. 
A couple records were shat­tered in Happy Valley this weekend. The attendance re­cord was broken this weekend at Beaver Stadium, as a record crowd of 96,672 came to see the finale of Penn State and Notre Dame. 
Tony Sacca broke the single­season passing mark at Penn State on his 18-yard completion to O.J. McDuffie in the first quarter. 
The last time a Lou Holtz coached team has lost two games in a row was in 1987. In '87, the Irish lost a close 21-20 heartbreaker to Penn State. The Irish then traveled to Miami and were soundly beaten 24-0. 
Demetrius DuBose sprained his knee in the fourth quarter of the Penn State game. DuBose said after the game that it was sore, but it should be fine after a few days rest. 
The Irish must now try to snap their two-game losing streak at Hawaii before they journey to New Orleans. Notre Dame should benefit from the open date this weekend, as it will allow the team to refocus on their goals. 
"I think it will give us a chance to go back and really work on our fundamentals, I think we've gotten away from that as the season went on," said linebacker Demetrius DuBose 
Lou Holtz promises that Notre Dame will get back on the winning track. "We will come back, I want to tell you, we will be back," proclaimed Holtz. "Don't bury us too quickly."

Hockey team bounces back to split series with Kent 
By MIKE SCRUDATO 
Sports Writer 
On Friday night, Irish hockey couch Hie Schafer was left with a lot of questions about his team. 
On Saturday night, he found some answers. 
The Irish split their weekend series with Kent as they lost 6-1 on Friday, but were able to bounce hack with a 7-5 win the following night. 
"We were two evenly matched teams," Schafer said. "Hockey is a game of mistakes. Friday night we made a lot of them, and Saturday we did not. That was the difference." 
Saturday's high-scoring con­test was decided by the Irish power play, which had been struggling prior to the game, <:onvnrting on only four-of-30 chances. In the 7-5 victory, Notre Dame was successful on four-of-five opportunities. 
"The power play is an impor­tant part of the game for us," Schafer commented. "Our passes were crisper and more accurate, and that is what makes the power play work." 
The Irish won the game in the second period as they outscored the Golden Flashes 2-0 on two power-play goals. The first of which was scored by Notre Dame's leading scorer, Lou Zadra, who netted his fifth goal of the year at 9:45 on a shot from the right of the crease. Sterling Black then scored his second goal of the night at 
16:28 to give the Irish a 6-3 lead. 
Also, in the pivotal second pe­riod, Notre Dame goaltender Carl Picconato made 11 saves 


Carl Plcconato 
to shut down the Kent offense which had scored nine goals in the first four periods of the series. 
"Carl did a great job for us. He was making saves with all parts of his body-he even made two with his head." Schafer said. "Defensively, we played sound. Defense is not just goaltending and defense-men; it is the forwards too, and they played well." 
The Irish -extended their lead to 7-3 at 2:52 of the third pe­riod when Troy Cusey scored his first goal of the season from the right face-off circle. 
After Kent jumped out to a 2-1 lead in the first period, Notre Dame responded with three unanswered goals by Black, Matt Osiecki and Tom Miniscalco. However, Kent de­fenseman Barry Cummins scored to cut the Irish lead to 4­3 before the first intermission. 
"Saturday's game was an ex­ample of what happens when you get it going early. It has an effect on the rest of the game," Schafer said. "We were sensing victory as opposed to sensing eminent demise. We didn't self­destruct." 
Unfortunately, on Friday the Irish did self-desiruct as Kent scored four goals on break­aways en route to a 6-1 tri­umph. 

The Irish were in the game for two periods, but the Golden Flashes broke the game open with four third-period goals, three of which were scored by left wing Neal Purdon. 
Kent opened the scoring when Jay Neal put a shot past Picconato at 2:31 of the first period, but Zadra countered for the Irish at 16:05 to even the score. However, the Irish were unable to score again as they were stifled by Kent goaltender Scott Shaw, who had 22 saves on the night. 
The Golden Flashes then took a lead they would not relinquish when Tim Evans scored with 18 seconds remaining in the second stanza.

tion was a lot better," said McGraw. "Her defense was bet­ter, and throughout the whole game, I don't think she turned it over as many times. Her overall game was a lot better." 
Forward Margaret Nowlin supported Marciniak with 15, while grabbing nine rebounds. Comalita Haysbert also added 10 rebounds for the Irish. 
Ranked third in the world, the Australian national team is largely the same squad that will travel to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
"Seven or eight of th~m will be (going to the Olympics). The majority of them will make up the Olympic team," said Aus­tralian coach Robbee Cadee. 
The Australians featured a very balanced attack, led by Robyn Maher with 14 points, and Vicki Daldy with 10. 
"They all seemed to be a threat," said McGraw. "No matter who came in, it seemed like they could score." 
Notre Dame had difficulty stopping any Australian rally, and with the absence of point guard Coquese Washington, lacked on-court leadership. Washington, a returning start­er, is out indefinitely with a knee injury. 
"I think Audrey Gomez has to be the answer (at point guard), because Coquese hasn't even practiced," said McGraw. "Kara ('Leary) has a lot of strengths, and Audrey has a lot of strengths, but Audrey has got to get into the rhythm more." 
While Leary started for the Irish, the duo split time at the point evenly. Leary committed only two turnovers in her 20

topic had ex-Ku Klux Klan member David Duke been elected governor, but Rev. William Beauchamp, executive vice-president of the University, refused comment on the issue. 
"We wouldn't want to specu­late on something that hasn't happened. We are pleased with the outcome of the election. The people of Louisiana have spoken as to who there choice is, and we think that has really little to do with the football game that's coming up on the first of January," Beauchamp said. 
Another hot item on the ru­mor mill was the dissatisfaction of the Penn State players about what they perceived to be a slight on the part of the bowl minutes of play. 
Gomez was impressive at times, making quick passes off the dribble and pushing the ball upcourt. She notched four as­sists and four steals for the 
committees. The Irish with an 8-3 record, including a loss to the Nittany Lions, are playing a higher-ranked opponent in Florida, while Penn State will be playing Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl. 
"I think there's always going to be speculation on that," Holtz said. "I can't comment about Penn State. They played a fine football game ... I have a lot of respect for Penn State." 
The Sugar Bowl committee downplayed any ill feelings they may have over bringing in an 8­3 team to play in its bowl. 
"Rankings don't always mean everything," said Mickey Holmes, executive director of the Sugar Bowl. "Notre Dame was our number-one priority. We got what we wanted."

"We went to the Cotton Bowl with the same thing somewhat in '87," Holtz said. "We finished disappointingly, went to the Cotton Bowl and played well for a half. I think there's a lot of similarities between this foot­ball team and 1987's. If there is, J hope what followed in '88 follows in '92." ­
Nevertheless, Holtz is confi­dent that the Irish will perform up to par on New Year's Day. 
"You got six weeks between now and when we play," he said. "We plan on bringing a good football team. I make no apologies for our football team. Absolutely none. 
"When we did get the invite, I was just absolutely delighted for it, but we also understand with it goes a sense of respon­sibility. Sometimes when you accept a bowl bid, that is a re­ward. We have something to prove."

Knights, Blitz fans celebrate interhall football titles 
.. ;:
Trick play leads Keenan past Zahm in defensive affair 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN Sports Writer 
Keenan Hall lost the battle but won the war, coming away with the men's interhall football championship Sunday at Notre Dame Stadium with a 7-3 victory over Zahm. 
Zahm dominated almost every offensive category, and was able to hold Keenan to only one first down on offense. Yet the Knights were unable to beat Keenan where it really counted, on the scoreboard. 
After having no offensive success the entire game, Keenan coach Phil Webby reached into his bag of tricks and pulled out the game-winning play-a 35-yard halfback pass with three minutes remaining in the game which caught the Zahm defense by surprise. 
Running back Brian Baker took a pitch from Keenan quarterback Matt Davis, stopped and threw across field to receiver Pete Knight for the
