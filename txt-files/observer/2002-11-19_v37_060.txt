You get the idea. Freshmen, wel­come to "South Bend winter." 

It doesn't take much in the way of meteorological skill to predict the weather here in South Bend. 
One look outside your window, and you too can get a job at WNDU telling people that it will be cloudy and cold -with an occasional chance of rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, locusts or a rational Notre Dame administration -from now until March. 
I figure I might as well get you used to the grayness that you've been noticing in the skies for the past few days. I think I should also get you all used to the two words that will domi­nate your winter vocabulary: lake effect. 
Yes, this is another meteorological trend that requires little meteorologi­cal assistance to predict. If it's cold and windy. you can bet about a foot of lake-effect snow is on its way. 
Recent winters have proven me wrong, but it's not exactly brain surgery to figure out that, sooner or later, it's going to snow. 
And snow or no snow, it's going to be cloudy and cold anyway. 
To my friends from the South: Welcome to the North. Hope you brought a parka. 
For those who haven't experienced it, the effect known as "South Bend winter" can be quite startling. 
Snow plows and salt trucks replace alarm clocks and video games as your biggest hurdles to attending class. 
One can literally spend entire months having not seen the sun. People actually pay $6 for a cup of coffee at Starbucks. The lakes on Notre Dame's campus deep-freeze in an icy shade of brown. The snow-covered campus still smells like ethanol. All of this will last for four months. At least. 
Did you ever notice all of the pro­motional material you got before you signed on to go to school here? Did you ever see any snow in any of those photos? 
I didn't think so. 

Snow is a South Bend phenomenon that is to be avoided at all costs. Sure, it might look good on a Currier & Ives cookie tin, but in reality (or at least along Lake Michigan). once it starts snowing it just does not stop. 
Underneath this neat little column of mine, our good friends at The Observer have attempted to bring you a fairly optimistic-looking weather forecast. 
Don't buy it. You know better. 
Just look out your window. 
Cloudy and cold, right?

Alumna reflects on Chocola campaign 
By NATALIE BAILEY 
News Writer 
One of the biggest lessons Erin Casey learned from her cxporience with the Chris Chocola's congressional run, she said, is to keep your eye on the prize. 
"It always helps to have the national spotlight on your race, Lut I had to focus on the dis­trict, on the people my candi­date would be serving," said Casey, a 2002 Saint Mary's graduate and finance director of Chocola's winning campaign for Indiana's 2nd Congressional scat. 
"It was a very highly contest cd race. It was very important to people all over the country, but I found that this made it important to see what the end goal was -to get Chris elected. In high-pressure situations, it is important to keep your eyes on the end goal," Casey said. 
Casey began working on the Republican congressman-elect's campaign in late February, 
minor in public relations. Casey began working with the finance committee, contacting current donors, looking for potential donors and organizing fund­raisers for Chocola's campaign. 
During her time as the finance manager, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, Speaker of the House Dennis Hasterl. Vice President Dick Cheney and President Bush have come to the area to lend their support to Chocola's cam­paign. Casey assisted with Cheney's visit and arranged all aspects of the dinner plans for 1200 guests during Bush's September visit to South Bend. 
"Having the vice president and president come were very large-scale events that took a lot of time to organize. There are so many things that have to be done for those types of vis­its," Casey said. 
Casey had worked on other campaigns prior to Chocola's, prior to graduation and has taking a semester off from continued her duties since the school in fall 2000 to work on Nov. 5 win. While finishing her Republican David McIntosh's degree in political science and unsuccessful bid for Indiana 
governor and working as a finance intern in 1998 for GOP candidate Sue Anne Gilroy's losing run for Indianapolis mayor. 
Casey said she finds cam­paigns thrilling and they keep her interested year after year. 
"There is always an excite­ment to campaigns. You believe that your candidate is going to help the people the most," she said. 
Casey will remain in South Bend throughout the next year or two to finish her work with the Chocola administration. She is originally from Indianapolis but she hopes to gain experi­ence outside the state. 
"Long term I see myself stay­ing political. working on differ­ent races around the country and moving onward and upward," Casey said.

CLC addresses The Parietals Question 
By MICHAEL CHAMBLISS 
News Writer 
Two representatives from The Parietals Question spoke to the Campus Life Council Monday about last week's parietals discussion and the future goals of The Parietals Question. 
Andrea Barton, a sopho­more from Walsh Hall, and Maggie Novario, a sopho­more from Howard Hall, informed council members about the new group's aims and the results of Wednesday's parietals talk. 
Another open meeting about how The Parietals Question should move for ward is planned for before the end of the semester, Barton and Novario said. The group also plans to con­duct a campus-wide survey on parietals. 

"Our ultimate goal is to have a coed option, which is what most Catholic uni­versities have," Novario said. 
Several members of the CLC warned the two sophomores not to fall into the trap of discussing the same worn issues of previ­ous parietals-questioning movements. Other mem­bers pointed out that pre vention of pre-marital sex was falsely listed as a rea son for parietals on the posters advertising last week's talk. 
"The purpose of pari­etals is to return tho com­munity to a community after certain hours, not to prevent pre-marital sex. If you get your premise right, you will have more support across the student body," said Heather Rakoczy, rector of Pangborn Hall. 
In other CLC news: 
The Communication Task Force unveiled a pre­liminary version of its new Web site. The Web site is being created so that stu­dents and administrators can post campus events in order to increase event attendance, reduce over­crowding on building walls and improve overall com­munication among stu­dents. 
Council members dis­cussed potential names for the Web site, as well as the possibility of a giant screen in LaFortunc Student Center displaying the calendar-formatted Web site.

Explosions rock US army base 
Associated Pre 
TOKYO 
Two explosions resounded late Monday outside the headquarters for the U.S. Army Japan, and a metal projectile and a crude mor­tar made from a metal pipe was found near the site, U.S. 
military  officials  and  
Japanese  police  said  
Tuesday.  

Police refused to comment on whether leftist extremists -who have used similar launchers in the past ­might have been responsible. 
No one was hurt by the blasts late Monday night, and there were no reports of damage. 
In Washington, Maj. Timothy Blair, a Pentagon spokesman, said an explo­sion had been reported about 800 feet from Camp Zama, the headquarters for the U.S. Army in Japan and the 9th Theater Support Command. 
Japanese police spokesman Narihito Sasaki said two explosions, believed to have been the sound of the mortar firing, were heard in a wood­ed area in the park just out­side the camp, which is just south of Tokyo. 
Sasaki said the launcher was found in the park and there were burn marks near­by. indicating it had been used. He said the pipe was pointed toward Camp Zama and was 21 inches in length and two inches in diameter. 
He refused to comment further. 
Police later found a round, metal projectile nearly a half mile away from the launcher on the balcony of a private home. A few roof tiles on the home were broken, but no one was injured, said anoth­er police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He refused to say how close to the base the home was. 
No projectiles were found in the base. 
Japanese newspapers reported that the launcher was made of a single metal pipe held in place by sand­bags and propped up by three legs. 
Army spokesman Capt. Benjamin Kuykendall added that because the blast occurred off base, the inquiry was being handled by Japanese authorities. He said that it wasn't immediately clear that the attack was directed against the base. 

Japanese police spokesman Narihito Sasaki confirmed that two suspicious men had been seen near the blast site, but denied that they had been arrested and said he had no further details on them. 
Pentagon officials said the 
U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii, which is responsible for U.S. forces in Japan, said there were no reports of injuries at Camp Zama. 
Leftist radicals in Japan are known for using similar projectile launchers in attacks on targets related to the U.S. military here. The attacks are usually more symbolic than dangerous, and injures or significant damage are rare. 
There are 2,000 U.S. troops stationed at the base, which is located about 25 miles southwest of Tokyo. About 50,000 American mili­tary personnel are stationed in Japan under a mutual security pact. 
Camp Zama public affairs officials said "appropriate force protection measures" were being taken. 

BOG stresses open relations between students and faculty 
By SHANNON NELLIGA_!'l 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's President Marilou Eldred met Monday night with the Board of Governance to create an open line of communication between the administration and students. 
Eldred expressed concern about the importance of relations between the two factions. Open communication between students and administrators is essential to deciding policies that affect every­one on campus, she said. 
"The things I miss most that I do not receive with this job is regular contact with the studcnl.5," Eldred said. "I try my best to increase contacts between students and the administration. I encourage the resident advisers, in the beginning of the year, to invite me to hall events.'' 
Katie Best, off-campus commis­sioner, illustrated the need for a link between the students and administration when it comes to choosing new faculty. She said students desire professors who have a diverse background and encouraged Eldred to take this idea into consideration. 
"We need a diverse faculty that will be a permanent fixture on campus," Best said. 
Eldred agreed with this senti­ment and explained that we are competing with larger universities who are also pushing for greater diversity. These universities are often located in larger cities that provide a greater outlet for cre­ativity and activity. 
"We often have difficulty draw­ing the younger and more diverse professors to the College because they are more attracted to the large college and city setting," Eldred said. 
Kristen Matha, student trustee, inquired about the impact of the Center for Women's lntercultural Leadership [CWIL] on promoting diversity in faculty. 
She believes that this is an excellent resource for the college to tap into when attempting to draw diverse professors to cam­pus. 
Eldred said CWIL is responsible for the increased diversity among the faculty. It has brought in nine fellows that reflect various ethnic and national backgrounds. 
"It [CWIL] is a good presence on campus," Eldred said. "Beyond bringing new faculty fellows to campus, it has made bringing speakers like Mary Robinson to campus more affordable," she said. 
Although students do not regu­larly think of communicating and interacting with women outside the college community, Eldred said CWIL allows for an open rela­tionship between the students and dynamic women in the communi­ty. It is these types of programs that will fulfill the students' needs when it comes to diversifying their educations, she said. 
Eldred also said that the Lilly Endowment, the program that funds CWIL, has set up a donation matching program for the college. This fund-raiser will hopefully be finishing up at the end of this semester for the Board of Trustees, but she hopes that BOG will be able to help with this endeavor into the spring semester. 
"It demonstrates a strong com­mitment and belief in the college when students participate in their own fundraising," said Kim Jensen, student body president. "Every little bit helps," she said. 
In other BOG news: 
Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl, stu­dent body vice-president announced a new proposal for the upcoming elections. She said most major elections will come under BOG. 
New procedures were proposed to evade confusion in the event that a tie occurs in an election. This new look at the constitution is a result of the tie that occured in the spring 2000 presidential elec­tions. 
Jablonski-Diehl said that in the event of a tic this year. the election will be decided by an appeals board composed of five seniors. This procedure allows for the stu­dent government to move towards a system that promotes a confi­dential judicial branch. 
"This is the best decision we could make when considering all the other options," Jablonski-Diehl said. 
After some debate and an expressed concern over the legiti­macy of this type of election sys­tem, BOG passed the new election procedure to go into effect for a trial basis for the next election. 
The executive board decided that BOG will no longer fund senior comprehensives. 
"It [funding for senior compre­hensives] does not fit into what the board considers to be co-sponsor­ship," Jensen said. 
According to Matha, this is merely a reinterpretation of the comprehensive funding policy by the new administration that will set a precedent for future funding of projects.

IRAQ 
U.N. inspectors call for cooperation in Baghdad 
Anociucd Press 
BAGIIDAD 
U.N. arms inspectors returned to Iraq after a four-year hiatus Monday, calling on President Saddam Hussein's government to cooperate with their search for woupons of mass destruction in the interest of peace. But Washington said it already sees likely violations. 
Chief U.N. inspector Ilans Blix and about 30 inspectors flew into the Iraqi capital aboard a white cargo plane emblazoned with the black letters "ll.N." as allied warplanes bombed Iraqi air defense svslems in the northern no-fly· zone. The U.S. military said the jel'i were fired on during routine patrols. 
!\t the White Ilouse, spokesman Scott McClellan said Monday the Iraqi anti-aircraft lire "appears to be a violation" of the U.N. resolution that sent the inspectors back to Iraq. 
It was unclear whether other countries on the Security Council would consider inci­dents in the no-lly zone serious enough to merit a response, because the council never explicitly authorized the patrols. Iraq considers such patrols a violation of ils sovereignty and frequently shoots at them. Defense Secretary Donald H. Humsfeld, traveling in Chile, said the United States is waiting for a paltcrn of Iraqi misdeeds before going back to the council. 
The return of the inspectors is widely seen as Saddam's last chance to avoid a devastating war with the United States. President Bush has warned Saddam that failure to cooper­ate with the inspectors will bring on an American attack and that Washington will pur­sue a policy of "zero tolerance" toward Iraqi infractions. 
Saddam's deputy, lzzat Ibrahim, told the official Iraqi News Agency that Iraq will work with inspectors to protect its people from America but will light "if war is imposed on us." 
Eventually more than 220 inspectors from 49 countries will be deployed, although how many al any one time would vary depending on what is required. At least 30 inspectors are American, the largest nationality represented, and at least live are women. At least six of the group are Arabs, and Mohamed ElBaradie, who over­sees the International Atomic Energy Agency, is Egyptian. 
E!Baradei and Blix, a Swede, sat down Monday night for a first official meeting with Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who acted as an Iraqi liaison for past inspectors, and Iraqi presiden­tial adviser Amir al-Saadi. 
After the two-hour meeting, 

Chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix (center), Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Elbaradei (left) and Iraqi official Hosam Mohammed Amin (right) arrive Monday in Baghdad. Their team has unprecedented authority to disarm Iraq as a result of a UN resolution.

Bin Laden tape promises new attacks, deemed authentic 
Associated l'rcss 
WASHINGTON 
The new audiotape of Osama bin Laden is an authentic, unedited and recent recording of the al-Qaida leader, U.S. intelligence officials said 
Monday after completing a  technical  
and linguistic analysis.  
The  CIA  and  National  Security  

Agency, which conducted the study, concluded the tape is what it seems: bin Laden himself, reading a statement that promises new terrorism against the United States. 
"It is clear that the tape was made in the Ia.st several weeks as well," said White House spokesman Scott McClellan. 
It was the first definitive evidence in almost a year that bin Laden survived . the U.S.-led war on his home of Afghanistan in the months after Sept. 11, 2001. 
While noting that "it cannot be stated with 100 percent certainty," McClellan told reporters that intelligence experts were sure that bin Laden had spoken. 
"It's a reminder that we need to con­tinue doing everything we can to go after these terrorist networks and their leaders wherever they are, and we will," McClellan said. 
The audio message gives little clue to bin Laden's location or his health, intelligence officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Some have wondered if he used audio, instead of video, to conceal injuries, sickness or a change in appearance. 
Officials believe he is probably hiding in a remote mountainous region along the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. There have been rumors that bin Laden was wounded or suffered some kind of kidney ailment. 
Officials are unsure why bin Laden chose now to speak. Perhaps he has recovered from an injury, or at last feels secure enough in his location to put out a message to his followers. He also refers to the ongoing U.S.-Iraqi conflict, and may have spoken in antic­ipation of a coming war. 
Previous public statements from bin Laden have served as preludes to ter­rorist attacks he masterminded, offi­cials said, and the broadcast of the message was a determining factor in a spite of terror alerts in the United States and elsewhere last week. 

"It is time we get even. You will be killed just as you kill," bin Laden said, after accusing the United States and its allies of a litany of wrongs. 
Officials also worry the tape could inspire his followers to strike, even without orders from the al-Qaida hier­archy. 
In the message, bin Laden apparently refers to the killing of a U.S. diplomat in Amman, Jordan, on Oct. 28, which is the most recent event he noted. It is unknown if al-Qai.da orchestrated the killing.

Blasts reported near U.S. Japan base: 
Two explosions were reported late Monday outside a 
U.S. military base near Tokyo, and a projectile launcher was found near the site. U.S. military officials and Japanese police said Tuesday. Police suspected it was an attack and that leftist radicals may have been involved, according to Japan's Kyodo news service. No injuries or damage were reported, Kyodo said. 
Police end Spainish school hostage crises: 
A teenager with a knife took his sister and 19 other children hostage at his former school and held them for hours Monday until a plainclothes officer overpowered him while delivering a pizza, ollicials said. None of the students was hurt in the 3 1/2 -hour ordeal at the Casal de !'Angel school in this gritty, industrial town just south of Barcelona. All the hostagos were 11 or 12 years old.

Court blocks Afgan detainee lawsuit: 
A federal appeals court Monday rejected a challenge to the detention of 600 or so Afghan war prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Ba5e, ruling that a group of clergy members and professors have no legal standing to intervene. The Coalition of Clergy., Lawyers and Professors sued on behalf of the prison­ers, many of whom have been held at the U.S. base in Cuba for about a year. The lawsuit alleged they have been denied access to lawyers and have been held without being charged, in violation of the Constitution. 
Ala. Judge loses Commandments case: 
A federal judge ruled Monday that a Ten Commandments monument installed in Alabama's judicial building by the state's chief justice must be removed because it violates the separation of church and state. U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson said he does not believe all Ten Commandment displays in government buildings are illegal, but this one crosses the line. 
Co-pilot's plunge apparently suicide: 
A man who plunged 9,000 feet from a small plane as it made a steep bank had apparently jumped, authorities said Monday. Russell Filler, 47, the plane's co-pilot. turned the controls of the single­engine Cessna 152 over to his flight instructor Sunday afternoon. then asked him to turn the plane sharply so he could get a better look at the ground. Waller County Sheriff Handy Smith said. Smith said Filler then opened the cockpit door and unfastened his seat belt as the plane flew over a rural area aboui 45 miles northwest of Houston. 
Poll: many think Iraq will not comply: 
Three-fourths in a new poll say they don't expect Iraq to cooperate with U.N. inspectors,. a develop­ment that would increase public support for U.S. military action. The ABC News poll out Monday said nearly two-thirds, 64 percent, would support U.S. forces taking military action to oust Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.

Delta changing retirement plans 
Delta Air Lines announced Monday a change in its employees' retirement plans as part of an effort to reduce rising pension costs. 
Delta said the change, which will affect all new employees after June 30, will reduce expenses by about $500 million over the next live years. 
If successful, the change would help the nation's third largest carrier at a time when its pensions are severely underfunded. In 2003, Della will have to spend up to $250 mil­lion in cash and take charges of up to $300 million to deal with the problem, according to Salomon Smith Barney airline analyst Brian Harris. 
The change, which will apply to all U.S. employees excluding pilots, will be from a tra­ditional defined benefit plan to a cash-balance plan. 
United stocks up on cost reductions 
Intensifying its push to avoid bankruptcy, United Airlines closed in Monday on a tenta­tive wage-cutting agreement with its 36,000 machinists -the key missing element in its plan to slash labor costs by $5.8 billion over 5 1/2 years. 
The carrier's pilots also contributed timely support for United's campaign for a federal loan guarantee, announcing they had ratified the recent agreement on their $2.2 billion portion of that austerity package. 
It confirmed their willingness to take 18 percent pay cuts lo try to revive the struggling airline.

Kmart Corp. may have to close more stores as part of its restructuring under bankruptcy pro­tection but the number will be nowhere near the 500-plus stores that were rumored to be on tho block, Kmart's chief executive said Monday.

"We haven't deter­mined how many stores, where they're going to be located," Adamson said. " ... We're going to close as few stores as possible and we're going to give stores a chance to get fixed."

Spanish school standoff ends 
Associated Press 
IIOSPITALET DE LLOBREGAT. Spain 

A teenager with a knife took his sister and 19 other children hostage at his former school and held them for hours Monday until a plainclothes officer overpow­ered him while delivering a pizza, officials said. 
None of the students was hurt in the 3 1/2-hour ordeal at the Casal de l'Angel school in this gritty. industrial town just south of Barcelona. All the hostages were 11 or 12 years old. 
Interior Minister Angel Acebes, speaking in the cen­tral city of Guadalajara. confinned the arrest and said the host.age-taker was a former student of the school who was expelled last year. 
Government officials said he was 16 or 17 and had demanded a $1 million ransom. He said he acted because his family needed money, the officials said. 
The Interior Ministry, disputing initial accounts. said there were 20 hostages altogether and that 16 were released about two hours into the ordeal. It was not immediately known if the boy's sister was among the 16 hostages he had freed. 
While the youth held the last four. police a"ked if he was hungry. and he asked for pizza. the Interior Ministry said. A plainclothes policeman came back with a pizza and overpowered the youth when he opened the door, a ministry official said. 
As a car left the schoolyard. apparently taking the assailant to a police station, a crowd swarmed around it and many people screamed insults. 
One unidentified boy who was evacuated from the school before hostages were released said teachers rushed to his and other classrooms and took students out of the building through the cafeteria. 
"They told us some man had slipped into the school," the boy told Spanish national radio. 
A teacher who identified herself only as Nuria said the hostage-taker rang the doorbell at the school as if he were a parent there to pick up a student. 
"Go to Sleep!" 
Pay attention to this article! You have a chance to win an $80 gift certificate to an area sporting goods store or a trip to a spa for a day of p a mp er i n g c o u rt e s y of UBWe112@ND. 
Now that we have your attention, there is an important topic to discuss. 
It's 2am, and you are finally sitting down to study for a theology exam at 8:00 the same morning. You figure you have six quality hours. Armed with a bottle of Mountain Dew, three unread textbooks and the determination to pull an all-nighter, you head for the study lounge. But you are missing one crucial element. 
Sleep. 
The average college student lacks an adequate amount of sleep. Faced with papers, exams, deadlines, parties, and Must See TV, sleep is often sacrificed because students view it as unproductive. 
Nothing could be farther from the truth. As a main component of a healthy life-style, sleep drastically affects daytime performance -both the quantity and the quality of sleep. 
A sleeping person goes through 4 to 5 cycles of Rapid Eye Movement and non-REM sleep a night. 
Non-REM sleep physically restores the body. Metabolism drops as much as 20% in an effort to conserve the energy needed to repair daily wear and tear. Growth hormone secretion peaks cturmg later stages or NREM sleep. 
REM sleep restores the mental functions of attention span, mood maintenance, self-confidence, and emotional adaptations to new environments. During REM sleep, the mind permits the closure of incomplete perceptions and memories by incorporating them into dream-fragments. 
While the sleep processes are important, a large concern for the harried college student is what happens when the mind and body do not get adequate sleep. 
About 100 Americans, or roughly 40% of the country, do not get adequate amounts of sleep. More than 50,000 traffic accidents occur annually due to mental fatigue. Lack of sleep leads to decreased attention, concentration, motivation, and memory function. A sleep-deprived person may experience increased appetite or eating during the following day and a decrease in body temperature. 
After a few weeks in which a person averages less than five of sleep a night, motor and mental performances begin to erode. Without adequate sleep, the mind cannot process data efficiently. Men who sleep less than four hours per night have a mortality rate 2.8 times higher than men sleeping more regularly. 
Sleep is important; there is no getting around that fact. Paying attention to nutrition and exercise is only part of a healthy· regiment. Food and physical fitness are more effective in fueling and strengthening the body when it is adequately rested. When the body is fatigued, precious energy goes toward simple functions instead of higher mental and physical processes needed by the college student. 
Getting the average 6-8 hours of sleep per night is difficult for a student. If increased duration is not possible, focusing on the quality of sleep is helpful. 

For example, going to sleep hungry leads to periodic awakenings during the night. Upon awakening in the morning, fatigue-type feelings may still linger. 
Alcoho I in itial!y facilitates sleep. However, several hours later, as the process of withdrawal begins, fragmented and disruptive sleep again lead to lethargy in the morning. 
Caffeine alters both the initiation and continuity of sleep. Some individuals who drink large amounts of caffeine during the day need to drink caffeine before going to bed to avoid caffeine withdrawal affects during the night. A daily dose of 500 mg of caffeine has a predictable inhibitory effect on sleep independently of the time of ingestion, because caffeine stays in the body for 8-14 hours. 
Nicotine is a stimulant that 
affects the sleep cycle. The morning 
cough of a veteran smoker indicates 
that during the night, bronchial 
secretion has pooled in the throat 
during the night. Thus a reflex cough 
develops during the night. Not only is 
the fact alarming in terms of over-all 
health, but after a night of coughing, 
the quality of sleep is very poor. 
For other suggestions on improving sleep quality, check out our stall notes and other signs around campus throughout the coming weeks.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Life is not black and white 
Issues like chalking color on our sidewalks arise through Viewpoint articles. Laughter, offense, discussion and even silence result. How cool. 
Matt Sullivan says to be thankful for the right to protest. Beth Jeub says she is. Paul Graham says workers need rights. John Litle says the leftists are classists. 
I don't think the threats from/onto Iraq are justified enough to warrant a war. Conveniently, on a chilly Thursday afternoon, the president came to visit my hometown. So as an exercise of my wonderful First Amendment right to be there, I stood in the area allotted for protesters. A variety of opinionated people accompanied me. all on the same yellow­police-taped patch of grass, each with a different intent. I saw my morn and sister across the street, in line with their tickets to go see their beloved president. What's the moral of the story? 
Life's not black and white. We live in the middle-ground. 
I'm one big hypocritical gray middle. I am a member of the Progressive Student Allicance, but I completely agree that the extreme left is classist. I've written "Killing is not the answer to killing," on sidewalks, but I don't think unioniza­tion is necessarily a good thing. I cannot support Bush, but I melt when I think of how cute my Bush-loving mom is. I preach about how awareness is one of the most important things, but I rarely pick up multiple new sources in one day. 
What's this have to do with the Notre Dame community? 
Political beliefs are important, but there are some human things like family that will always be trump. Our political system bifurcates all issues into "right" or "left," and while it is beautiful to see that there are many causes which can bring people together, it limits arguments. The benefits of First Amendment are exceptional. 
So let's not hastily clump. Let's not get too heated by all this debate. It's wonderful that it's going on, but let's all just re·cognize the middle-ground. 
Liz Fallon junior Pasquerilla East Hall Nov. 12 
America must provide moral clarity in a dangerous world 
President George W. Bush recently stated, "The United States possesses unprecedented -and unequaled ­strength and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of lib­erty and the value of a free society, this position comes with unparalleled respon­sibilities, obligations and opportunity. The great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom." 
I agree. 
The United States is the greatest nation in the history of humanity, and we have a responsibility to preserve freedom, lib­erty and equality around the globe. Time after time, the United States has proven itself to be a bastion of free thought, human rights, civil liberties and freedom -and it is essential to ensure that these ideals be extended to the oppressed and disenfranchised. 
Yes, I said it, but I said it because it is an absolute truth. The United States is the sole superpower in the world, and we must lead the world's people in their endless pursuit for liberty. 
The United States is a moral country ­a country whose ideals have led the world through a sea of darkness. The United States has inspired democratic movements around the world. Europe turned to the United States to help rid the world of the evil regimes in Germany, Italy and Japan. We succeeded. 
South Korea turned to the United States to contain the spread of commu­nism. We succeeded. Eastern Europe turned to the United States to catapult the collapse of the evil empire in the Soviet Union. Once again, we succeeded. This is our legacy -a legacy of strength and moral opposition to evil. 
It concerns me that a considerable por­tion of Americans, many of whom are in the academic arena, feel that it is unjust or improper to extend our morality to destitute and deprived nations. 
How can it be unjust to demand free­dom? How can some Americans, who enjoy such magnificent independence and prosperity, compromise with evil authoritarian regimes who slaughter their own civilians? How can America's most privileged citizens criticize the gov­ernment for extending the blessings of liberty? 
All too many people in this country take our freedom for granted. This type of behavior is irresponsible and hypocrit­ical. The ideals of human dignity and lib­erty are non-negotiable. It is not impolite or politically incorrect to demand these moral essentials; it is just and right. 
To ensure the continued existence of liberty in the United States and the world, we must maintain our military superiority. We must not be naive to the evil in this world -these threats are very real and must not endanger us any longer. As citizens of this great nation, we must recognize the evil before us and forcefully and responsibly rid the world of such terror. 
The United States cannot ignore anoth­er evil empire, such as the Soviet Union of the 1960s, to threaten free society. The aggressive regime of Nikita Krushchev brought civilization to the brink of nuclear destruction. Evil dicta­tors, with horrific intentions, were allowed to possess deadly weapons. This scenario is far too dangerous to ever let happen again. As President Bush said, "History will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have entered, the only path to peace and security is the path of' action." 
U.S. superiority is essential to the sta­bility, survival and peace of' this world. We must defend peace through strength. The last few decades, in which the United States has been the only superior strength, have been the most stable times in world history, and it is no coinci­dence -no coincidence because the United States exemplifies the level-head­edness to restrain and utilize power appropriately. Unlike other countries in history, we will not use our superior strength to destroy innocent lives or pur­sue imperialistic desires. Our strength will be guided by a moral compass. 
The United States is one of the few countries in the history of' mankind to send its own soldiers to die for the liber­ties of foreigners. We have built a repu­tation on defending the weak from tyran­ny and oppression, and now, more than ever, we must combine our moral and military strength to lead the world, once again, to freedom. Never before has such incredible might been harmonized with such moral principle. Ifwe remain com­mitted to our ideals, our service to the world will never be forgotten. 
I am confident that we will, once again, find the steadfastness and fortitude to remain committed to our ideals. We must take pride in our standards and not be ashamed to extend them to others. The United States has moral authority over oppressive dictatorships around the world -we always have, and we cannot negate our responsibilities now.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
PSA works to solve problems, not polarize people 
ll frustrales me that people are engaging in ridiculous behavior such as waking people up at 4 a.m. to bother them about political views. Serious. what on earth are you doing? Not only is it rudo, but I have only one thought: lf you really care about social justice, stop waking people at 4 
a.m. and instead use your time to actually address the issues that you like to spout about. 
I am in the Progressive Student Alliance (PSA), and that is not what I go there to do. Nor do the majority of PSA members I know. It maddens me that anybody would profess to care about social justice and then blatently disrespect someone. It goes against everything we believe in. 
Just an announcement to everyone: Personally, I don't run around having strange thoughts about chopping white people or business men up with a hacksaw or imposing some kind of weird socialist system that wouldn't work anyway. 
But ask me yourself, or talk to the people in your classes and dorms who are truly concerned about workers' rights. We won't eat you. 
It docs seem to me that there are many prob­lems stemming from corporate greed and policies that facilitate it, such as the lack of benefits and poverty-level wages that often subsidize enor­mous profits. 
Wal-Mart has been sued in 38 states for forcing workers to work off the clock so as to avoid over­time pay. Twenty-five percent or people who work in the United States earn poverty-level hourly wages, according to the Economic Policy Institute. 
Without even getting into the international gar­ment industry, the U.S. Department of Labor found that 100 percent of poultry plants and 50 
percent of restaurants in the United States to vio­late wage and hour laws. 
But this does not make me hate CEOs or think that all business is bad. Nor do I think rich peo­ple are evil. r am sorry if some people do. 
I think we need to work together to change problems, not polarize people. We need to hold businesses accountable for the way they treat our fellow humans. And we need to support their right to a voice at work, to get problems addressed without being afraid of losing their jobs and to negotiate for fair wages and condi­tions, which is often found through unions. 
What has come to my attention most recently is what is going on at Notre Dame, not the statistics of the rest of the world. For instance, many peo­ple here are feeling extremely overworked and simpl,Y don't know what to do because it seems that nobody is listening to them. Other workers have been made to feel afraid of ramifications if they talk about unions. 
Often unions can provide a voice and represen­tation on the job, a way to negotiate for fair wages and conditions and to ensure that troubles are addressed. I, along with many others, am simply asking the University to agree not to in behavior that hinders workers' attempts to unionize, but instead to voluntarily recognize a union if workers vote to join it. 
What do you think? I'm not going to hate you if you want to talk about it.

Comic insults Native Americans 
I feel obliged to question the editorial decision to run the comic "School Daze" in the Nov. 18 issue of The Observer. The third frame of this comic strip depicted an SYR gift obviously intended to be repossessed and used by the giver and not the recipient and contained a racial slur which should not have been permitted to run. 
Please be more careful in the future of using terms such as "Indian Giver." I assume, and sincerely hope, that it was mere thoughtlessness and not deliberate racism that led you to make the decision to publish a comic strip which used that ugly figure of speech. 
Did you know that we just finished celebrating Native American Heritage Week? This past Friday, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's hosted the well-known Native American actress Elaine Miles to speak to students about achieving their goals and dreams. 
I am relieved that your strip didn't run on Friday for her to see and ashamed that such a thing was published at all. I implore all members of the Notre Dame family to banish the phrase "Indian Giver" from their vocabu­laries and to reflect on the history of the indigenous people of this continent. In treaty after broken treaty, which party consistently took away what they had given and unfailingly reneged on their earlier pledges? 
Shame on The Observer for publishing this comic strip.

Dance policy change challenges dorm 
finances 
This past weekend, the men of Keenan Hall pre-partied, boarded buses and bowled the night away to the sounds of the Bee-Gees at our Disco Bowl dance. This dance was the second annual Disco Bowl, a tradition we look to continue. Both dances were great successes, but the costs for this year were significantly higher. Ticket prices increased more than $5 per couple from last year, yet we couldn't even afford to get a gift for the dance. 
The point I'm trying to make is that the $1,000 one-time subsidy is fairly useless. Vendors such as Beacon Bowl and bus companies now realize that they have no competition from in-hall dances and have subsequently raised prices. We paid $1,400 for buses alone. While the subsidy may help smaller dorms more, with Keenan's population of over 300, this "gift" amounts to about $3 a person, hardly enough to purchase a coffee mug or other small gift for the dance. I can see no reason why vendors would drop prices in the near future, leaving halls to take financial hit that comes from having an off-campus dance. 
Attendance at this semester's on-campus dances has been somewhat poor, with even some cancellations. This would lead me to believe that off-campus dances are more successful, however the aid simply isn't there to defray any of the costs. Before, wo could have an in-hall SYR where we could provide a good time for little cost. That option is now gone. I can see no reason why a school with as much financial stability as this cannoL find more money to help residence halls deal with the costs of their own policy changes. 
The administration has essentially left the halls out in the cold next year to either increase ticket prices dramaticaUy or forgo off-campus dances altogether. While this may keep the "fun" on campus, it may leave us disappointed as we sip from our coffee cups the next morn­ing.

Question arbitrary rules and punishments 
At Notre Dame, nobody has sex. Nobody does drugs, either. Nobody has fake IDs. 
On campus, it seems that people tend to avoid topics in order to safeguard them­selves from ResLife -this judicial system with arbitrary powers. 
In philosophy, we learn to discuss the meaning of justice, but somehow once outside the classroom walls, we are faced with promulgated yet unjust campus rules. People avoid saying they have sex because that's against Du Lac. People avoid saying they smoke marijuana because that's also against Du Lac -yet it's fine to say that freshmen, sophomores and juniors drink regularly. 
Under-age drinking is just as illegal as smoking marijuana, yet Notre Dame tol­erates under-age drinking. So while it's still illegal under state laws. it's tolerated to a certain extent on campus. The administration looked at the state Jaw and judged for itself what applied and did not apply for its students. 
In case of conflicts with these state laws, Notre Dame has a team of lawyers. If students decide to pick and chose what campus rules apply to them, they will simply be at the mercy of ResLife, whose decisions, at times, seem arbitrary. 
If you start thinking, is having sex real­ly worse than having a drinking problem? Have alcoholics had to write a letter of apology to The Observer? Somehow, at Notre Dame, we should publicly apologize for sex. Hello, scarlet letter. 
In a sense, I believe that stringent rules and the arbitrary decision-making power of ResLife leads many of us at Notre Dame to live in "bad faith" -to lead a public image that molds to Du Lac and ResLife's rules and to thus avoid aspects of ourselves that do not conform to Catholic or Notre Dame teachings-with­out questioning whether or not these punishments are just or unjust. 
Should we be afraid to discuss certain issues in the paper just because there exists this certain Big Brother with arbi­trary power? If we are to be a communi­ty, the laws cannot simply be the will of the administration. If we do live in a democratic community here at Notre Dame, we should have influence over the rules that govern our environment. We should not be at the whimsical mercy of ResLife. 
And this campus should ultimately be a place where students discuss "real issues" without having an impending fear of being unfairly judged or expelled. Aquinas argues that we, as rational crea­tures, have a natural inclination to live together in conversation. 
So perhaps together. we should ques­tion the existing rules and the punish­ments that follow defiance. Then we could analyze what kind of political com­munity governs us at Notre Dame -and whether we've got to tame it.

ALBUM REVIEW 

Nirvana releases a hit and miss 
By DAVID HARTWIG Scene Music Critic 
The recently released self-titled album by one of the '90s greatest bands has its high points, but leaves one feeling empty and unsatisfied. The first track, "You Know You're Right," is the only new material on the 14-track album, and it truly is a stroke of genius. It was the only song recorded during an ill-fated session in January of 1994. 
In the lhroes of his battle with heroin addiction, former lead singer Kurt Cobain missed the first few days of the session. All was not lost. though, as drummer Dave Grohl and bassist Krist Novoselic used the time to record and experiment with some of Grohl's songs. Several of these tunes would later appear in the repertoire of Grohl's post-Nirvana band the Foo Fighters. When Cobain finally showed up, the band recorded "You Know You're Right" in one take, with Cobain laying down only a few additional vocal and gui­tar tracks later that day. 
Perhaps this song is even more poignant as it is the last known studio recording of the brilliant-but-tortured singer/song­writer. Cobain committed suicide just four months after the song was recorded. for this reason alone, this disc is a must-have for all Nirvana fans and dedicated follow­ers of what would unfortunately become known as the Grunge movement. The rest 
of the 

album, however, 
leaves something to be desired. 
Nirvana 
Nirvana 
Rather than a
Universal t r u l y 
great col­lection of songs, this short CD is just a compi­lation of "radio Nirvana." The new disc has four tracks drawn from Nevermind, their breakthrough and most radio-friendly album. This makes the album seem more of a tribute to the industry powers that drove Cobain into depression and addiction than to the band that cap­tured a generation and became the catalyst to a pop culture movement. 

Surrounded by rumors of battles and legal settlements between Cobain's widow Courtney Love and Geffen Records, between Geffen and Novoselic and Groh! and between Novoselic and Groh! and Love, this release is embroiled in legalese and million-dollar deals . 
Compound this with the coming release of Journals, a book of Cobain's personal writings and diaries, and it becomes apparent that Nirvana's 
message did not sink in. It is rumored that Cobain's estate received at least $4 million for the rights to the book. Though it may give us more insight into Cobain's tortured mind and incredibly powerful music, it is sure to tell us that this kind of invasion of privacy is precisely the reason for Cobain's depression. 
Nevertheless, listening to this CD brings back memories of Airwalks. skateboards; long hair, baggy jeans and ugly plaid flan­nel shirts. For that reason alone, it may be

worth buying. Nirvana is likely the most important band in modern music and with the perversion of capitalism aside, the band should be remembered as such. Critics, both musical and cultural, will like­ly debate this and the effect of Cobain's sui­cide on music and pop culture for years to come, but this reviewer can only say go buy the album, crank it up and remember the old days.

U2 proves their worth 
By LIAM FARRELL 
Scene Music Critic 
U2 is an ageless. timeless band. Despite some hard times, they have managed to remain one of the most enduring and influential bands of modern music. Their music has ranged from the political to the bal­lad, to solid rock and roll. In addition, they have staged some of the most popular and financially lucrative tours and have made some of the best albums of the past decade. 
Their newest compilation of greatest hits, a sequel to the earlier collection Greatest Hits 1980-1990 showcases the music from this turbulent and phoenix-like era of U2's music. From the pounding and grinding "Even Better Than the Real Thing" to the final, soothing sounds of "The First Time," U2 has put together a collec­tion of songs that plays like a great mix tape. There is variety and scope, and no stone of the era is left unturned. Songs from Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Pop, All That You Can't Leave Behind and even the Passengers Soundtrack arc included. The listener is left with an excellent testament of U2's songwriting achievements over the past 10 years. 
Perhaps one of the best parts of this collection is that even if someone already owns all of U2's albums, this 
collection is still a must­have. There are two new songs, "Electrical Storm" and "The Hands that Built America," the theme song for Martin Scorsese's new film "Gangs of New York." Both songs are excel­lent exam­ples of how U2 has still maintained the creative energy that was so deci­sive and brilliant 10 years ago. "Electrical 
Storm" is a production of grace remi­
niscent of songs from Achtung Baby. 
The slow, wandering ode to immi­
grants, "The Hands that Built 
America," is a truly beautiful song. The songs included from Zooropa and Pop are all given new mixes, with 

the excep­tion of "Stay (Faraway So Close!)." 
Although it would be hard for a casual listen­er to tell the difference between the album ver­sions and the new mixes, one thing is for certain: The songs recorded for these albums are some of the most underrated work that U2 has done. "Stay" has one of the most intense and haunting guitar lines and choruses 

ever, and "Staring at the Sun" gets 
better with every listen. Placing the song recorded from the Passengers sessions, "Miss Sarajevo" on this collection was a fantastic idea, with the song only being available elsewhere on CD single or a lackluster 
album. A moving tribute to the victims of the Sarajevo conflict, Luciano Pavarotti's part on the song is chilling and can give even the most jaded lis­tener goosebumps. 
There are, unfortunately, some drawbacks to the collection. All U2 fans will have their own personal arguments for or against the songs included. It is disappointing that "If God Will Send His Angels" is only available as a B Side. The song "The Ground Beneath Her Feet" should be made front and center. 
The second disc of B Sides is also disappointing for most hardcore U2 fans. There are few new songs includ­ed besides "North and South of the River" which is a great addition. If it didn't have "Slow Dancing," "Two Shots of Happy One Shot of Sad," or their version of Elvis Presley's "I Can'dt Help Falling in Love With You,'' the B Side disc would be more of a rehashing of older material than a further exploration of U2's career. 
The bonus DVD included with the CDs has some good extras such as live performances, interviews, outtakes and song clips. It is amazing that with so many omissions and the hefty price tag, this collection is still a necessity for any CD collection.

CONCERT REVIEW 
Mayer am_azes Chicago fans 
SingerI songwriter John Mayer has more than good looks when live 
By EMILY TUMBRINK 
Scene Music Critic 
Numerous Notre Dame students 
made the trek to Chicago's UJC Pavilion Saturday night to sec singer and songwriter John Mayer in con­cert. 
Mayer was greeted by Lhou~ands of screaming fans when he stepped into the spotlight, opening his set with a solo acoustic version of "Love Soon," an energetic song from his recently re-released EP Inside Wants Out. Without hesitation, Mayer segued into "Why Georgia," the solitary spotlight replaced by lights illuminating the whole stage, revealing Mayer's band­mates already in position to jam. 
Following "Why Georgia" was the popular radio hit "No Such Thing," which seemed to be for many audi­ence members the sole motivation for coming to the show. 
The majority of Mayer's so-called fans sat down whenever he played a lengthy guitar solo or an unfamiliar song, missing some of the most bril­liant musical moments or the show simply because they had not heard them previously on the radio. 
Mayer. however. did not disappoint the loyal members of the audience. He not only played all but two or the songs from his major label debut Hoom for Squares. but also played the unreleased songs "Covered in Rain" and "Something's Missing," a tune which Mayer knowingly dubbed a "pee break song" due to its unfamil­iarity. 
"83," the obvious crowd favorite, 
was prefaced with a free-form intro that included the "My Buddy" commercial jin­gle and lyrics about Michael Jackson and Star Wars. staples from Mayer·s youth in the 1980s. The song itself energized the audience, most notably when Mayer digressed into partial covers of "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and "Let's Hear it for the Boy." 
He closed the set with "Neon," a song that explores his jazz influ­ences and never fails to show off his talent as a guitarist. After only a brief pause to tease the audience.Mayer returned to the stage. playing a solo acoustic rendition of "Comfortable." a per­petual crowd favorite from his humble begin­nings in Atlanta that remains a favorite to this day. His band then joined him for the remaining songs of the encore, "Love Song for No One" and "St. Patrick's Day," both from Room for Squares. 
Having released only about 20 songs in his short career, Mayer does not have a large amount of material to draw from. Luckily for concert goers. absolutely everything that he has 


John Mayer Is a relatively new artist, but his skills on guitar show years of experience with Influences In jazz, rock and soft acoustic melodles. 
released is worthy of inclusion in a live performance. There was not a single clunker among the 15 songs in the set. despite the boredom of some "fans" during the gaps between well known songs like "No Such Thing" and "Your Body is a Wonderland." 
Obviously targeting the show at his most loyal fans, instead of those who only know him through his recent suc­cess, Mayer was unabashed about his talent on stage. He utilized every opportunity to include guitar solos and improv jamming, showing the extent of his abilities with live per­formance. 
"Playing onstage is that truth that no one else can touch, which I really love. The reason I can enjoy the ups and downs, and the uncertainties, and the insecurities of the TV. radio. record career is because I know that every night I get on stage I'm going to be rooted in this really incredible truth, musically... being on the road really kind of is the alkaline to the pH balance of [my life]." Mayer described the concert experience. 
With his quick wit and boyish good looks, Mayer seems to be a more obvi­ous candidate to host MTV's THL than a legitimate musician. 
Critics, however, must keep in mind that this young star writes his own songs and is also proficient at playing the guitar, things that the majority of today's pop stars cannot claim. Mayer's musical talent stands alone. His marketable sex <ippeal is just an added benefit. 
With sweetly sensitive lyrics like "I loved you / gray sweatpants / no makeup / so perfect" no doubt assist­ing him in his efforts to get into the sweatpants of the ladies. Mayer's identity as the cJuelessly sexy boy­next-door cannot be denied. What girl wouldn't want to be wooed by such an understanding and honest male who so clearly places women on a pedestal? 
"I really don't want to be a hunk," he said. "I don't want to be Sensitive Hunk Guy. That's just a little fear of mine. But I think women can relate to the lyric side more. I know the guys are waiting for all the sappy songs too, but they have a front. which is the guitar playing." 
Despite the abundance of middle school girls in the audience shrieking about how hot he is. Mayer's heart­throb status has not interfered with his credibility as an artist. 
"Everyone kind of has their agenda. I certainly have no self-imposed limit. 1 wouldn't mind selling six million records. I would like to think though that you can sell six million and make every person who owns it feel like it's a personal experience. I may be ­wrong. I think that there's a way to be mainstream in terms of accessibility, but musically remain true in whatever it is you want to do," Mayer said. 
With no intention of selling out any­time soon. John Mayer is a breath of fresh air in the world of' c.lancing boy bands and wannabe divas. Time will only tell if he can avoid paying too much attention to the hype and con­tinue to play quality music for his true fans. From the sounds ol' Saturday's concert, he's headed in the right direction.

NBA 

Sprewell, Houston light up struggling Nuggets 
Associated Pres 
NEW YORK 
Latrell Sprewell returned to the starting lineup and scored 23 points, helping the New York Knicks defeat the Detroit Pistons 94-91 Monday night despite nearly blowing a 32­point lead. 
Allan Houston also scored 23 for the Knicks, who won for the second time this season ­but just barely. 
Detroit trailed by 22 when the fourth quarter began but pulled within one with 9.6 sec­onds left. Sprewell hit a pair of free throws with 4.7 seconds to go, and Ben Wallace threw away the ensuing inbounds pass to deprive Detroit a chance to tie. 
Wallace grabbed 19 of his 21 rebounds in the second half, thriving on the boards as the Knicks suddenly found them­selves unable to make a shot. New York was just 2-for-18 from the field in the fourth, with Sprewell going O-for-4. 
Improving to 2-8, the Knicks avoided having the worst record after 10 games in fran­chise history. 
Richard Hamilton scored 31, Cliff Robinson 19 and Chucky Atkins 14 for the Pistons, who lost starting point guard Chauncey Billups to an ankle injury. 
New York made 14 of its first 18 shots, a spree that ended with Howard Eisley's 3-pointer for a 34-18 lead. New York shot 76 percent in the quarter despite getting very little from Sprewell -three points and two assists in 8 minutes. 
Coach Don Chaney said he decided early in the morning to move Sprewell into the starting lineup in place of Shandon Anderson. 
"I just felt we need a win real bad. With him starting, we should get out to a jump start -which we need. I'd rather do it now than later," Chaney said. 
Billups went down late in the 
... _ first quarter when he collided with Eisley, and did not return. Atkins played the remainder of the game for Detroit, logging a season-high 41 minutes. There was no immediate word on the severity of Billups' injury. The Knicks exploited their matchups with the 5-foot-11 Atkins in the second quarter, 
posting him up with taller players to create easy baskets, Eisley assisted on three straight baskets in a 10-0 run that made it 48-22, and the lead reached 32 on a 3-pointer by Sprewell with 1 :35 left before halftime. 
Detroit made its charge in the fourth with a 16-2 run that ended with Hamilton catching an inbounds pass and going in from the foul line for an uncontested dunk with 24 sec­onds left, making it 91-89. Detroit then appeared to force 
the Knicks into an  8-second  
violation,  but  no  call  was  
made.  

Nets 99, Nuggets 78 
The New Jersey Nets embar­rassed the Denver Nuggets with more than just the score. 
Jason Kidd hit five straight shots and scored 13 of his 24 points in the first quarter to lead New Jersey to a victory over the woeful Nuggets on Monday night. The Nets might have gone a little too far in try­ing to put on a third-period dunk show. 
"That's us," New Jersey for­ward Kenyon Martin said. "It wasn't because the game was out of reach. We do that every game." 
With the Nets ahead by 28 late in the 
and we tried it. lt won't be the first or last time we try to do something out of the ordinary." 
Rookie Nuggets coach Jeff Bzdelik got off the bench quickly after Jefferson was fouled and started to move to the Nets' end of the floor. He just as quickly turned and walked back to the bench. 
Bzdelik insisted he was angry with his team rather than the 
Nets. 
"The way my team played annoyed me. This is the NBA, it's a man's league," Bzdelik said. "Nobody feels sorry for you. That didn't concern me. We allowed that to happen." 
Nuggets guard James Posey was more aggravated. 
"Like I said, you just never forget," Posey said. "They felt they could do it. It was the right thing to do, so they tried it. They just tried to get high­lights. You just keep it in the back of your mind." 
Hawks 117, Raptors 92 
Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 27 points and the Atlanta Hawks routed the Toronto Raptors Monday night after building a 29-point lead at halftime.

MLB 
Selig approves blockbuster Hampton deal 
Associated P rcss 
ATLANTA 
Left-hander Mike Hampton's trade to the Atlanta Braves was approved Monday by commis­sioner Bud Selig. 
The Braves called an after­noon news conference to dis­cuss the deal, which casts doubt on whether the team will re­sign starters Tom Gtavine and Greg Maddux, both free agents. 
Hampton was shipped to Atlanta al'ter a brier stopover with the Florida Marlins. They acquired the pitcher and out­!'icldcr Juan Pierre from the Colorado Hockics in exchange for catcher Charles Johnson, outlielder Preston Wilson, left­handed reliever Vic Darensbourg and second base prospect Pablo Ozuna. 
The Braves sent the Marlins reliever Tim Spooneybarger and a minor leaguer who has not been identilicd. 
Atlanta is responsible for just $5.5 million of Hampton's salary over the next three years, which could increase payroll llexibility. 
As part of the deals, Colorado pays Florida $6.5 million over the next three years, and the Marlins pay Atlanta $30 million over the next three seasons. 
In addition, the Rockies remain responsible for the $19 million Hampton is owed from his $21 million signing bonus 
This Weel< in 
and for a $6 million buyout of his. 2009 option, which was declined just before the trade. 
Hampton was a bust in Denver's thin air. After a 9-2 start in 2001, he went 12-26 with a 6.62 ERA for the Rockies. The 30-vcar-old left-hander was 7-15 this year with a 6.15 EM, the highest in the major leagues among qualifying pitchers. 
The Braves made an offer l.o Glavine, a two-time Cy Young Award winner who has spent his entire 16-ycar career in Atlanta. But the left-hander could get a more lucrative deal from the New York Mets, who last week offered a three-year contract worth about $31 mil­lion. 
Maddux, a four-time Cy Young Award winner, has been with the Braves for 10 seasons but seems even less likely to return than Glavine. His agent, Scott Boras, isn't expected to begin serious talks with prospective teams until next month. 
Two years ago, Colorado gave Hampton a $121 million, eight­year contract, a record for a pitcher, and the Rockies will wind up paying $49 million of the deal: the $21 million signing bonus, a $6 million salary in 2001, $8.5 million in 2002, the $6 million buyout of his 2009 option, a $1 million payment to the Hampton Foundation, plus payments to Florida of $2 mil­lion in 2003, $2 million in 2004 

Pitcher Mike Hampton fires a pitch during a game with the Colorado Rockies last season. 
and $2.5 million in 2005. 
Commissoner Bud Selig approved a trade Monday to send Hampton to the Atlanta Braves.

Wyoming fires head coach 
Associated Press 
LARAMIE, Wyo. 
Wyoming coach Vic Koenning was fired Monday. with his team struggling at 2­9 and one game left on the schedule. 
Koenning compiled a 5-28 record at the school in three years, including a 1-19 mark in Mountain West Conference play. He had two years left on his contract, with a base salary of $105,204 a year. 
"We believe that it is in the best interest of our program that we make a change at this time," athletic director Lee Moon said. "No one would ever question Vic's dedica­tion, and his work ethic. Unfortunately, sometimes those attributes do not neces" 
"The Cowboys had just one quality win [Air Force] in three seasons," Moon said. 
"The success of any program, ultimately, is measured by wins and losses." 
The school hopes to hire a new coach as soon as possible "and bring Cowboy football back to where we all expect it to be," Moon said. 
Koenning. 42, became Wyoming's 29th head football coach in December 1999. 
He said the team made "tremendous strides" -in the classroom and on the field -during his three years. 

"Unfortunately, we couldn't get enough wins on the field to demonstrate that progress," Koenning said. "This program will be suc­cessful with the character and courage that we feel like we've helped to instill in these young men." 
Koenning said he was at peace with the decision, but made no comment about his future. 

"My only regret is not get­ting to see the fruits of our labors," he said. "I very much appreciate the support of the great fans and followers of Cowboy football. After six years here, being a Cowboy is in my blood." 
Koenning broke the news to players Monday afternoon, Moon said. 
"Just like anybody else, when they sec change I'm sure they're concerned," Moon said, "but they're resilient and they've still got one more game to play and they have to go out and play." 
Fifth-year linebacker Herman White, a team cap­tain, said many players had grown close to Koenning, who was Wyoming's defensive coordinator and inside line­backers coach for three sea­sons before being named head coach.

NFL 
Maddox expected to return Monday 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH 

Quarterback Tommy Maddox has no structural damage in his injured spine and was walking in his hospital room in Tennessee on Monday, but the Steelers weren't ready to say when he can play again. 
"We're quite happy with his progress," team doctor Anthony Yates said at a news conference Monday morning. 
Maddox was hurt on the final play of the third quarter of the Steelers' 31-23 loss at the Tennessee Titans and spent Sunday night in the hospital with a concussion. 
He was expected to return to Pittsburgh on Monday night and be hospitalized in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center for further tests. But all indications were that his injury is not career-threatening. 
Maddox underwent X-rays, a CT scan and MRI exams Monday morning and no structural dam­age was detected. Yates said. Maddox was initially diagnosed with a spinal cord contusion -a bruising and swelling that includes hemorrhaging -but instead he has an interruption in the normal electrical activity in the spine. · 
For at least the next several weeks and perhaps longer, for­mer starter Kordell Stewart, whom Maddox replaced during the third game of the season, will be the quarterback. The Steelers (5-4-1) are at home Sunday against Cincinnati (1-9). 
At least 15 minutes passed Sunday at The Coliseum while Maddox was turned onto his back and strapped to a back­board after trainers cut off his face mask. Players for both teams knelt and prayed. 
Maddox was unconscious for about five minutes but never stopped breathing. 
Maddox was hurt while flip­ping the ball to Antwaan Randle El for a 2-yard gain. As Maddox fell forward. Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck put his forearm into Maddox's shoulder. Maddox's head rolled under­neath him slightly as he hit the ground, and he did not move. 
McNabb out for 6 weeks 
Donovan McNabb probably will miss the rest of the regular season and could be out for the playoffs because of his broken right ankle. 
'Tm looking at it like we don't have Donovan this season and we move on," Philadelphia Eagles coach Andy Reid said Monday. 
McNabb was injured on the third play of Sunday's game against Arizona, but he stayed in and threw a career-best four

touchdown passes to lead the Eagles past the Cardinals 38-14. 
The Eagles (7-3) have six games left. and hold a one-game lead over the New York Giants in the NFC East. The two-time Pro Bowl quarterback could possibly return for the playoffs, but Reid said it's too early to set a definite timetable. 
"It's somewhere in the six-to­eight week area, but that has to be determined," Heid said. 
McNabb, his family and the Eagles' medical staff are consid­ering options that include surgery or having his ankle placed in a cast. Reid expects a decision to be made in the next day or so. 
McNabb, who has never had a serious injury, had insisted he'd try to play against San Francisco next Monday night. He has made 53 straight starts, including playoffs. 
"In my mind, I'll be out there," McNabb said. 
But Reid ruled that out Monday. Koy Detmer will start in McNabb's place. A.J. Feeley takes Delmer's spot as the back­up. 
McNabb went down after he was sacked by Adrian Wilson and LeVar Woods on third-and-4 on the opening possession. lie clutched his right leg and stayed on the turf after losing the ball. but returned on Philadelphia's next series. 
X-rays after the game showed the break in his fibula. 
Unable to scramble because of his injury -which was original­ly thought to be a sprain -McNabb stayed in the pocket and threw TD passes of 2 yards to James Thrash, 3 to Dorsey Levens. 27 to Todd Pinkston and 9 to Duce Staley in the first half. 
Though he limped noticeably the entire game, McNabb didn't miss a play until coming out with 
4:49 left. He finished 20-ol'-25 for 255 yards and one intercep­tion, but he had no rushing attempts for the first time in his career. 
Griese possibly out 3 weeks 
Brian Griese's sprained left knee will keep him out of Denver's lineup against Indianapolis next weekend and could sideline him for three weeks. 
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said his quarterback will not practice this week after being injured in a 31-9 victory over Seattle on Sunday. Griese was hurt late in the third quarter when Seattle defensive tackle Rocky Bernard rolled into his knee. 
An MRI exam Monday showed that Griese has a second-degree sprain of the medial collateral ligament. 
Shanahan said the good news was that Griese didn't have much swelling or a dramatic loss of motion that typically comes with such an injury. 
Steve Beuerlein, who threw two four-quarter touchdown passes in relief of Griese, will start against the Colts on Sunday night. 
It will be the 37-year-old Beuerlein's first start since the final game of the 2000 season, when he played for Carolina. I le missed last season with an elbow injury.

Graduation took a heavy toll on a. club that reached the final four each of the past two years, reaching national rankings of 2 and 3 at the end of the last two seasons. 
Although expectations were lower, the club displayed a balanced attack as different players stepped up in each game. Allison Gienko's three goals paced the club in the opener. a 7-3 victory over Emory. 
The club hammered James Madison 11-4 in the second round, leading to the semifi­nal with the host Gobblers. 
Freshman Kristy Bohling found the back of the net three times as the Irish pum­meled Virginia Tech, 14-3. 
The Sunday finals found the Irish paired against Ivy League power Penn. Again, the Irish youth led the way as sophomore Kimmy Moore fired in four goals as the Irish emerged victorious, 9-4. 
With goalie Brigette Alge anchoring the defense, the Irish look poised to again challenge for national recog­nition. The club will return to the water next Sunday at Purdue. 
Ultimate 
Horrible weather this weekend in Knoxville made for an extremely cold, wet, and muddy David Baldwin Memorial Invitational at Tennessee. The Notre Dame Ultimate club made its sixth consecutive appearance in the 16-team field and opened with a 13-9 win over East Carolina. 
The Irish dropped the sec­ond game to Michigan, 13-7, on a swamped field as condi­tions worsened by the hour. 
Splitting  their  next  two  
games,  a  13-6  win  over

to Tulane, the Irish then made short work of ECU in a rematch, 13-8, placing the Irish in Sunday's quarterfi­nals. 
Rob Bruggner's Irish grew stronger each round as they posted a 13-11 win over a fine Virginia Tech squad, and then defeated highly regard­ed Clemson, 11-7, in the semifinals. However, at this point, tournament officials were forced to cancel the finals due to terrible field conditions. The Irish were awarded second place, due to the losses on Saturday.

In the Flying Junior class, Gaither paired with Saint Mary's Katie Roney in one boat, while Meghann Finerty and Matt Cassady crewed the second boat. 
Andrew Lappin and Commodore Mike Stephens soloed a pair of Lasers to complete the line-up.

The mens volleyball club hosted Northwestern and Club Nowak in action at Rolfs Sports Hecreation Center this Saturday. 
The Irish fielded two teams as ND1 finished undefeated. NDl 's front line of Andrew Mascarenhas, Tom Bradbeer, and Brad Weldon swept the Wildcats in straight games. 
After a rough start against Club Nowak, NDl bounced back to win 13-25, 25-23, 15­

ND2 dropped their opener to Club Nowak 25-14, 25-20. Fielding two squads enabled the Irish to develop depth and spread game experience among the entire squad.

The exclamation point came with a SportsCenter-worthy highlight with 8:40 left in the game. Carroll led a fast break down tho court and sent a behind-the-back pass to Dan Miller, who emphatically slammed a dunk home and drew a foul. 
After the game, Brey called the play "Showtime," Miller said he wished it was nation­ally televised and Carroll just grinned and hummed the SportsConter theme. 
That was just one of several fancy passes the Irish made all night. Led by Thomas' 11 assists, the Irish finished with 25 assists compared to 11 turnovers. 
While Notre Dame's offense impressed the 10,255 fans at the Joyce Center, their defense impressed their coach. The Irish frustrated IUPUI shooters all night, and would have set a team record for blocks in a game with 13 had they not broken the,same record Sunday night. 
"It's the first time since I've been here where we really have a defensive identity." Irish coach Mike Brey said. " ... Last year, we were a little bit of the smoke and mirrors because we couldn't stay with you for 40 minutes. I think this team is enjoying guarding ... and now I think we have some pride in that, and that's good to see especially in November." 
Once again, Jordan Cornette continued his spectacular defensive play. Fresh off rejecting a record-setting 11 shots Sunday, Cornette fin­ished with eight blocks against the Jaguars. 
But Cornette wasn't the only player anchoring the Irish up Miller now has two in two games with the Irish after fin­ishing with 17 points and 11 rebounds. 
Torin Francis also had a big night. After struggling in his college debut Sunday. Francis responded with 16 points and 10 rebounds. 
"I was so pissed Sunday after the first half, I know I stepped it up the second half'. but still," Francis said. "The whole team came out fired up and ready to play before tip off tonight, and that's what we needed to do." 
With the win Monday, the Irish improved to 2-0 on the season and advanced to the championship round of the Guardians Classic on Nov. 25 and 26. 
Notes: 
. Monday's game was a fami­ly reunion for Jere Macura, who squared off against his brother Pctar, a freshman at IUPUI. 
Petar only took one shot, a long 3-pointer that sailed wide of the basket, and his brother made sure to kid him about the miss after the game. 
"It's the first time I've seen him in three months," said Macura, whose mother trav­eled from Croatia to watch her sons play. 
. Irish center Tom Timmermans dressed but did not play for Monday's game, the second straight game he missed. 
But Brey said Timmermans, held out with back spasms, could have played if he was absolutely needed, and the coach expected Timmermans to be ready to play Friday.

second half lead changes, Illinois kicker John Cockman sent the game into overtime with a 48-yard field goal as regulation time expired. Maurice Hall, half of the tan dem filling in for injured fresh­man halfback Maurice Clarett, scored on an 8-yard scamper to give the Buckeyes a 23-16 lead in the first overtime. 
It took two questionable pos­session-related calls on end zone passes to keep the lllini from tying the game on their ensuing possession. Despite their perfect record, poor per­formances of late and a weak strength-of-schedule leaves the Buckeyes at No. 4 in this week's Sendwich Index. The Illini dropped only two spots to No. 62. 
Ohio State may face their stiffest challenge of the season against archrival Michigan next Saturday. Fortunately for the Buckeyes. they should have Clarett and his 6.0 yards per carry back in the lineup. 
Additionally, the game is being played in Columbus, where the Buckeyes are a much better team. Ohio State's average margin of victory at home is 26 points, despite playing opponents with an average winning percentage of .600, and the Buckeyes have won by an average of only six points on the road this year, though those opponents have an average winning percentage ofjust .420. 
The Red Raider Invader 
There was an aerial assault in Lubbock, Texas on Saturday but the only casualty was the Texas Longhorns' national championship hopes. 
Texas Tech's Kliff Kingsbury completed 38 of 60 passes for an incredible 473 yards and six touchdowns, while throwing zero interceptions in an upset victory over Texas. 
The Longhorns' Chris Simms kept the game close with 345 yards and four touchdowns of his own, but it was Kingsbury who struck last with 5:44 remaining, to give the Red Raiders a 42-38 win in a see­saw contest. With the win, the Red Raiders jumped 14 places to round out the top 25 this week, while Texas slipped three spots to No. 13. 
Kingsbury, who hasn't thrown for fewer than 268 yards in a game all year, clear­ly got the best of a fifth-ranked Texas defense that came into the game allowing an average of only 125 passing yards per game. 
So we can't help but wonder 
why 

Kingsbury isn't con­
sidered a 
frontrun­
ner, or 
even a con­
tender, in 
the 
Hcisman 
race?

mock 
Heisman voting, whHe Kingsbury is nowhere to be found in the list of candidates. 
On the year, Dorsey has com­pleted 152 of 279 passes for 2,265 yards, 18 touchdowns. and eight interceptions, good for a quarterback rating of 
141.8. Meanwhile, Kingsbury has completed 432 of 634 for 4,455 yards, 41 touchdowns, and only ten interceptions, giv­ing him a quarterback rating 145.4. 
Of course, Kingsbury has thrown the ball over twice as many times as Dorsey, but the Red Raider invader still has a better completion percentage, quarterback rating, and touch­down to interception ratio. Furthermore, opposing defens­es know that Kingsbury is throwing the ball nearly every down but they still can't stop him, whereas Dorsey has No. 2 Heisman contender Willis McGahee lining up in his back­field. 
Safe to say, if we had a Heisman ballot, Kingsbury would be No. 1 on it. 
Texas Tech concludes its reg­ular season against No. 3 Oklahoma in Norman this Saturday. Should the Red Raiders somehow defeat the Sooners. Texas Tech will win the Big XVII South division and face Colorado, who has already clinched the North Division, in the conference championship with an automatic BCS bid at stake. 
Sendwich Corruption? 
Despite recent suggestions that the Sendwich Index is more corrupt than Richard Nixon and Enron combined, we assure you that Notre Dame is indeed earning its No. 2 rank­ing in our computerized rank­ing system. 
The Irish, who have faced one of the toughest schedules in the country and emerged with only one loss, were able to move up one spot this w~_ek, as they slipped by former No. 2 Oklahoma when the Sooners took a major hit to their strength-of-schedule from the Texas loss.

Formula works again 
. Carroll ignites Irish, scores 26 
.... 
points in victory 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sport> Writer 
Seconds after drawing an offensive foul two-thirds of the way through the first half Monday, Matt Carroll hopped to his feet, clapped his hands and yelled, "C'mon, let's go" so loud veins started bulging at his neck. 
The Irish listened. 
Trailing IUPUI 18-17 when Carroll drew the foul, the Irish reeled off a 15-5 spurt to pull ahead of the Jaguars for good and cruised to an 89-45 victory. 
Carroll, who struggled to find the basket in Notre Dame's two exhibition games and Sunday against Belmont, finished with a game-high 26 points and earned MVP honors for the Notre Dame regional of the Guardians Classic. 
"Being a shooter, you have to be confident," he said. "Some nights you're going to be off, but you just have to hang in there and you'll get that good game." 
Notre Dame beat IUPUI the same way they beat Belmont Sunday -with tough defense and sudden offensive explo­sions. The Irish limited the 
Jaguars to just 17 second-half points, the second straight night the Irish held their opponent under 50. 
For the second straight night, the Irish offense struggled to find the basket early. In fact, lUPUI led most of the first half thanks to a stingy defense that kept Notre Dame's perimeter game in check and with a physi­cal offense that resembled a Rig East style of play. 
Carroll jump-started a stag­nant Irish offense with five quick points right before the momentum-shifting charging call. Nowhere was the explosion of Irish offense more apparent when Torin Francis made a basket, got fouled, missed the free throw and watched a Jaguar accidentally tip the ball in, putting the Irish up 24-20. 
"The ref said to me, 'Why does it take you guys 15 min­utes to start playing?"' Chris Thomas said after the game. "Maybe that's a good thing, maybe that's a bad thing. Hopefully we can play like that over 40 minutes." 
In the second half, the Irish looked anything but a team that struggled to find an offensive rhythm in the first half. The Irish scored 14 points on fast breaks, and wowed the crowd with a series of flashy passes.

Injuries hamper Irish heading into exhibition 
. Notre Dame faces OGBM All­Stars tonight 
By JOE HETTLER Associate Spores Editor 
It may only be the second exhi­bition game of the preseason for the Notre Dame womens basket­ball team, but coach Muffet McGraw is already concerned about injuries. 
Sophomores Kelsey Wicks and Katy Flecky, along with junior guard La 'Tania Severe are banged up as the Irish head into their matchup against the Ohio Girls Basketball Magazine All­Stars Tuesday night at the Joyce Center. 
"They're talented. It's really just a chance to play against women, the guys have been killing us," McGraw said. "It's just a chance to run our offense against [a women's team] and see what we can do ... it's more for us, really." 
Notre Dame may not play all of their players, although McGraw said every one will dress. Wicks has a foot sprain while Flecky is just all-around banged up. Severe has a sore wrist but is expected to start along side Alicia Ratay, Flecky, Jacqueline Batteast and Teresa Borton. If Flecky can't go, McGraw said one of the two freshman, Courtney Lavere or Meghan Duffy will get the start. 
I don't know if I'd go with Megan or Courtney, but definitely one of the freshmen," McGraw said. "It would depend on the match-ups." 
It's been two weeks since Notre both ends," McGraw said. 'We Dame last played and McGraw have more installed, so it wants her team treat the game as shouldn't be so boring.' ifit were the regular season. In their last exhibition game,

"It depends who they bring because they change their roster every night," McGraw said. 'That's probably why they get beat because they don't find a rhythm.'' 
McGraw added that playing in exhibition game against a team from the United States is more helpful for the Irish than facing a foe from another country. "It's better than playing a foreign team because their offense is more like the ones we'll see." 
After this game, Notre Dame will open their regular season against Cleveland State at home Nov. 26. The Irish then travel to
