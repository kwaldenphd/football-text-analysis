9/11 service 
prolllotes peace 
Seventh anniversary remembered at SMC 
By ALICIA SMITH News Writer 
Saint Mary's College Campus Ministry hosted a prayer serv­ice to remember the tragedy that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001 Thursday. 
The service was not only to pray for those whose lives were affected on 9/11, but also to encourage students to live in peace. 
"This is a time that we stop everything to come, and in a context of faith from different traditions, to join together in a unity of remembering, but also seeking peace," Director of Campus Ministry Judy Fean said. 
Peace was a· common theme throughout the non-denomina­tional service, which included prayers from Islamic, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian traditions, as students were called to help those who suffer, and live in harmony. 
It included several songs and a small sermon in honor of suf­fering around the world. 
"The singing and all the dif­ferent religious commentary from the different religions gave you a better understand­ing of the diversity of the world but yet how we can all come together as one and pray for

Students are excited and anxious about tomorrow's match-up between our own Fighting Irish and the Michigan Wolverines.

Lyons to hostCirque duLac 
Carnival to benefit Hannah & Friends 
By ELLYN MICHALAK 
News Writer 
Lyons Hall will host the first ever Cirque du Lac, a carnival event benefiting Hannah & Friends, this after­noon from 12-4 p.m. 
Hannah & Friends is a non­profit organization that aids special needs children and their families. Notre Dame football coach Charlie Weis and his wife Maura founded Hannah & Friends in 2003 in honor of their daughter Hannah. Born in 1995, Hannah was diagnosed with Landau-Kleffner Syndrome at the age of two. 
The Cirque du Lac carnival will feature 20 different game and activity booths from other dorms and clubs on campus, carnival food, live music and inflatables. Every activity at the carnival will cost a certain number of tickets which will be avail­able for $1, but all proceeds will go to the charity. There will also be a booth dedicat­ed to providing information about Hannah & Friends and asking for donations. 
"The games and food aren't expensive, but it's still not free," Cirque du Lac coordi­nator Maria Petnuch said. "We're hoping students real­ize that this for a great cause and they should come out

QUESTION OF THE DAY: WHAT ARE YOUR PREDICTIONS FOR THE MICHIGAN GAME THIS SATURDAY? 
MTVfinds nevv lovv 
When flipping through channels a 
few days ago, I saw the commercial 
for Paris Hilton's new reality TV 
show and realized that MTV has 
somehow reached a new low. 
While I enjoy 

watching "The Madeline Buckley 
llills" nvcry 

Monday, 1wnn News Writer 
when the only 

thing that happens is Heidi's sister 
dnleting three of Spencer's Tivo 
shows. most MTV reality shows 
make me want to throw my TV out 
the window and mourn the demise 
of quality television on the network. 
I thought that "A Shot at Love 
with Tila Tequila" was as bad as 
MTV eould get, but the network has 
given the green light to a show that 
looks like it could be even worse. 
This is, of course, Paris Hilton's "My 
New BFF." 

In the commercial promoting the show, Paris Hilton sits on a lawn chair and invites girls to come live together in one house and compete to be her new best friend. Each week she will eliminate someone until she !inds her "new BFF." Somehow Paris once again finds a way to get attention and earn money without doing anything worthwhile. Why aren't people sick of her yet? 
The entire premise of this show is pathetic. Women will appear on the show to get their 15 minutes of famn and perhaps access into an exelusive elub for one night, and Paris will get the exposure she craves. What is rna! or appealing about that'? In airing this new series, MTV has reached a new level of bad. 
What happened to the old MTV, the MTV that aired Thriller and made Madonna a star? It used to be a network devoted to promoting music videos in order to showcase emerging artists and create interest in new music among adolescents. The old format with VJs and music videos playing one after another seems to be almost completely dead. Every once and awhile the network will air a video, but for the most part MTV has abandoned music videos in favor of ridiculous and not that real reality shows. 
The format of MTV has changed so much since its TRL days, yet it is still one of the most popular net­works among teenagers. It is note­worthy that the network was able to reinvent itself in the age of the Internet, which made music videos non-exclusive to MTV. 
I just wonder if the network pro­ducers have reached the end of their creative rope in airing a show with such an awful premise as Paris llilton's "My New BFF." 
While reality TV doesn't lend itself to quality in general, each new MTV reality show somehow keeps getting worse. The network that launched so many bands' careers in the 80's and 90's has sadly become a bastion of trash TV and should no longer call itself Music Television.

Postman hoards 20,000 letters in Germany 
FRANKFURT A Scottish postman working in Germany hoarded at least 20,000 letters at home because he felt his work was too taxing, police said on Tuesday. 
The postman in Frankfurt was caught when a neighbor saw him tipping a mail delivery into a rubbish bin and alerted police. 
"It's worth mentioning the 23-year-old didn't deliver mail addressed to himself either," local police said in a statement. 
Investigating officers 
found rubbish bags and boxes full of letters and other post stashed around the man's flat and cellar. He told police he had got behind with deliveries because of his night school studies and felt too "over­taxed" to catch up. 
Police said at a conserva­tive estimate, the hoard, which the man had built up since August 2007, com­prised at least 20,000 let­ters. Two vans were need­ed to remove it. 
Fire brigade adds two Porsche cars to fleet BERLIN -Emergency patients in the German city 
of Stuttgart will be rushed to hospital with extra speed and style after the fire brigade added two custom­made luxury Porsche cars to its fleet. 
Each Cayenne model, a SUV worth about 70,000 euros, is equipped with a siren which Porsche says can be better heard by driv­ers and pedestrians and clears the roads faster. 
"It was a difficult process; the interior had to be com­pletely changed," Porsche spokesman Heiner von der Laden said Wednesday.

ND student \\Tins UpDown contest
Contaminated drinking 
Finance major defeats students across nation in investment competition

water effects 46 million 
Associated Press 
Testing prompted by an Associated Press story that revealed trace amounts of phar­maceuticals in drinking water supplies has shown that more Americans are affected by the problem than previously thought-at least 46 million. 
That's up from 41 million peo­ple reported by the AP in March as part of an investigation into the presence of pharmaceuticals in the nation's waterways. 
The AP stories prompted fed­eral and local legislative hear­ings, brought about calls for mandatory testing and disclo­sure, and led officials in at least 27 additional metropolitan areas to analyze their drinking water. Positive tests were reported in 17 cases, including Reno, Nev., Savannah, Ga., Colorado Springs, Colo., and Huntsville, Ala. Results are pending in three others. 
The test results, added to data from communities and water utilities that bowed to pressure to disclose earlier test results, produce the new total of Americans known to be exposed to drug-contaminated drinking water supplies. 
The overwhelming majority of 
U.S. cities have not tested drink­ing water while eight cities ­including Boston, Phoenix and Seattle -were relieved that tests showed no detections.

Language

"Chinese and Arabic are now very important for intercultural communieation and understanding and for international business," Chinese professor and assistant director of Global Education Alice Siqin Yang said. 
Yang's Chinese class has 10 stu­dents in its first semester. Some chose to take the language to get in touch with Asian backgrounds while others felt knowledge of Chinese language and culture would be beneficial to their major and future careers.

Chinese students also focus on the unique culture and customs of China. One method Yang used to showcase China's individuality and intensity was with the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics which she showed in class. 
Like Chinese, Arabic is also very diflerent from western languages, professor Heather Jones said. She teaches 15 students in her new class. 
Arabic consists of a 28-letter, 18­shape alphabet that is written right to left. It is spoken across the Middle East and North Africa in various dialects and is the lan­guage of the Qur'an.

Lyons Hall selected Hannah & Friends because they wanted to raise aware­ness about the foundation. The proceeds earned will benefit the construction of Hannah and Friends Farm, a residential community for adults with special needs. The program will be funded by Indiana Medicaid. 
"[Hannah & Friends is] 
something that is very close to the heart of Notre Dame. Started by our football coach, it's a charity and even if people don't know a lot about it they've at least heard of it before," Petnuch said. "Because we knew we wanted to have a carnival, supporting an organization that helps kids was an easy choice to make."

Zimbabwe government strikes deal 
HARARE, Zimbabwe -South Africa's president says he has successfully mediated a power-sharing deal between Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and the opposition. 
South Africa's Thabo Mbeki did not offer details, but said Thursday that the agree­ment would be signed Monday. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai told reporters the parties "have got a deal." 
Mbeki has been in Zimbabwe since Monday trying to work out how Tsvangirai and Mugabe would run a unity government. 
The key stumbling block has been how the two rivals would divide responsibilities and who would have the most authority. 
Mugabe had shown little willingness to give up much of the power he has held since independence from Britain in 1980. 
Chinese landslide kills at least 151 
XIANGFEN, China -A landslide that unleashed a three-story wave of mud and iron ore waste at an illegal mining opera­tion in China has killed at least 151 people and authorities fear the death toll could climb by hundreds more, state media said Thursday. 
In a matter of minutes, the sludge inun­dated an entire village of 1,000 people and an outdoor market with hundreds of cus­tomers on Monday in Shanxi province's Xiangfen county, the China Daily newspa­per reported, citing witnesses. 
State media put the official death toll at 151 people. 
One of the worst-hit areas was Yunhe, the village where the market was located. Yunhe sits in a valley at the foot of Tashan, the hill where the iron ore mine was oper­ating.

9/11 mourners gather to pay respects 
Acts of remembrance mark seven-year anniversary of terrorist attacks 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Familiar rituals of grief marked the seventh anniversary of Sept. 11 on Thursday as thou­sands paid tribute at the attack sites, the presidential candidates laid flowers at ground zero and children mourned parents they are barely old enough to remember. 
Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama called off their campaigns for the day, and in the late afternoon descended the long ramp into the pit of the World Trade Center site, bowing their heads and leaving the flowers in a reflecting pool. 
At the Pentagon, 15,000 people turned out for the dedication of the first per­manent memorial built at any of the three sites where hijacked planes crashed. It includes 184 benches that will glow at night, one for each victim there. 
"Thanks to the brave men and women, and all those who work to keep us safe, there has not been another attack on our soil in 2.557 days," President Bush said at the outdoor dedication. 
In New York. the crowd fell silent in a park just east of the trade center site at 8:46, 9:03, 9:59 and 10:29 
a.m. -the times when two hijacked jets slammed into the buildings and the twin towers fell. 
Alex, Aiden and Anna Salamone -now 13, 11 and 10 years old-wore old soccer jerseys belonging to their father, broker John Patrick Salamone, who was 37 when he was killed. They recalled playing in the yard with a toy wagon. 
"He was strong. He was funny. He always made me laugh," Alex Salamone said. "I wish I could remember more, but we were so young when he died." 
"We love you, daddy," said Anna. 
Still others chose to forgo the observances altogether and mark the day in quieter, more private ways. Kai Thompson Hernandez toast­ed her late husband, Glenn Thompson, at a beach, with his favorite brand of beer. 


"I try and celebrate his life rather than mark the place of his death," she said. 
Family members of the trade center dead and stu­dents representing the more than 90 countries that lost citizens in the attack ­Azerbaijan to Zambia to Vietnam -read the names of the 2,975 victims. 
Others descended seven stories below street level to pay respects where the tow­ers once stood. A giant crane, an American flag hanging from a hook, over­looked the anniversary cere­mony from ground zero, where office towers, a memorial and transit hub are under construction. 
The New York memorial is years away from comple­tion. Some of the mourners worried the progress on it would prevent them from being allowed to pay respects next Sept. 11 on the ground where their loved ones died. 
"When you walk through the site, you really feel like you're right where they were, and it's very raw," said Dennis Baxter, whose brother, Jasper, died while attending a conference at the trade center. "I think the spot should remain raw." 
Many family members reading names paused to thank the troops fighting the two U.S. war lauHched since Sept. 11, 2001, drawing applause on several occa­sions. 
"They took from us inno­cent lives in the names of their God," said Rosaria Reneo, whose sister Daniela 

R. Notaro was killed on Sept. 11, "and it seems some people have forgotten what happened here seven years ago." 
Edward Bracken said to loud applause that his sister, Lucy A. Fishman, was "mur­dered by coward men using their religion to say they are right and we are wrong."

AFGHANISTAN 

Anniversary marks deadliest year 
Associated Press 
KABUL -Insurgents killed two U.S.. troops in AfghanistaJl on the anniver­sary of the 9/11 attacks Thursday, mak­ing 2008 the deadliest year for American forces since U.S. troops invaded the country in 2001 for shel­tering Osama bin Laden. 
The deaths brought the number of troops who have died in Afghanistan this year to 113, according to an Associated Press tally, surpassing last year's record toll of 111. 
Afghanistan was the launching pad for al-Qaida's terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. U.S. forces invaded in October 2001 in response and quickly drove the Taliban out of power. 

Across Afghanistan, U.S. troops paused in silence Thursday to com­memorate the 9/11 attacks. At a U.S. base in Kabul, members of the New York National Guard. many of whom served at the site of the World Trade Center after the towers came down, remembered the attack on their home state. 
"For those of us who were there, served at Ground Zero, 9/11 is deeply personal." said Col. Brian K. Bale, the commander of the 27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. 
Maj. Stephen Bousquet, 34, of Buffalo, N.Y .. provided security at Ground Zero for three weeks after the attack. He now trains and mentors Afghan police, he said, "so American and coalition forces can leave one day." 
Osama bin Laden, leader of the al­Qaida network, is believed to be in the lawless tribal belt on the Pakistan­Afghanistan border. He had been shel­tered by Taliban leader Mullah Omar before 9/11.

Senior Tomas Castillo said that he will be painting him­self in Notre Dame colors for the game. 
Although Notre Dame 
dent population will still be supportive of the team despite how we do, especially since we're up against Michigan," he said. 
An Irish victory would be very exciting for Notre Dame fans, many students said. 
"I think if we win, fans are going to go ballistic," Riehm said. 
Michigan lost to Utah 25-23 on Aug. 30 and then beat Miami (Ohio) 16-6 last Saturday. 

Sophomore Cory Winland thinks that Notre Dame will be able to play well against Michigan because of these scores. 
"The San Diego State [game] kind of worried me, but I still think we're better than how we played in that game and Michigan hasn't really looked good this year," Winland said. He said he anticipated tomorrow's game 
to be more exciting, ener­getic and fun than last week­end's. 
Senior Teresa Nesbitt said she does not really know what to expect from the game against Michigan after the team's performance in last week's game. She also didn't see the Irish perform poorly last year because she studied abroad last fall. 
''I'm just going to hope for the best after last week," 
Nesbitt said. 
Other fans are hoping for a better season than the last one, as well.

Castillo said he had expect­ed the team to perform bet­ter last weekend. He said while there were "glimpses of glory" throughout the game, he felt things had not changed much since last year. 
"It seemed like the same old team. nothing had changed," Castillo said. 
However, Castillo said that the last quarter of the game against San Diego left him feeling hopeful.

IN BRIEF 
Democrats urge to freeze foreclosures 
WASHINGTON -Four Democratic sena­tors urged the mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Thursday to tem­porarily freeze foreclosures on loans they hold. 
The troubled companies, seized by the government Sunday, should help struggling borrowers swap their mortgages for more affordable loans and stay in their homes, the lawmakers wrote the new chief execu­tives and federal regulator now running Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
It was the latest sign of mounting congres­sional pressure on James Lockhart, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, to ensure that the companies use their clout in the mortgage market to help homeowners caught in the housing crisis. 
Super Bowl ad space nearly sold out 
NEW YORK -NBC has sold nearly all of its commercial time during next year's Super Bowl, beating expectations despite a soft advertising market. 
The network said Thursday it has sold 85 per­cent of its available slots. Strong categories include automobiles and movies. 
A dozen 30-second commercials sold for $3 mil­lion apiece. With only about 10 slots left, NBC could command even more money for each. 
Normally, about 60 percent of Super Bowl ad slots get sold by this time of year, when the profes­sional football season's final bout is still more than four months away. 
The Wall Street Journal reported on the devel­opment earlier on il'> Web site. 
Sporting evenlc; have been a rare bright spot for media companies facing declining ad revenue this year in the weak economy. Although television ratings have been dropping for years as audiences turn to video recorders and alternative viewing platforms such as computers and Apple Inc.'s iPods, people tend to want to watch big sporting events live and on high-quality screens.

PAKISTAN 
Bush okays secret raids into U.S. ally Pakistan 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Bush has secretly approved U.S. military raids inside anti-terror ally Pakistan, according to cur­nmt and former U.S. officials. The high-risk gambit prizes the death or capture of al-Qaida and Taliban extremists over the sen­sitivities of a shaky U.S.-backed civilian government that does not want to seem like Washington's lapdog. 
Bush acted in July to give U.S. forces greater leeway to cross from outposts in Afghanistan into the rugged area along the Pakistan border. Pakistan's cen­tral government has little control in this area, whern nxtrnmists havn found what U.S. officials say is a comfortable safe haven. 
Alrnady frustrated with what the U.S. perceived as a balky and inn11npl«~tn commitment to hunt­ing militants soven years af'tor the Sept. 1I attacks, oflkials said llw last straw came when it appeared Pakistani authoritins won1 passing tips to militants. 
One ollkial familiar with South Asia policy said the new ruins worn adopted in response to increasing problems with U.S.­Pakistani eounterterrorism mop­oration -particularly evidence that Pakistan's intelligence serv­ice, known as the lSI. had been compromised by militants and that some IS! elements were helping extremists. The official said extremists got Pakistani help before an attack July 7 on tho Indian Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. 
"Up to that point, the idea was to share intelligence with the Pakistanis and then proeeed but thorn was a lot of frustration with delays and problems, ineluding leaks to militants, in sharing the intelligence," the ollkial said. 
"This (the new order) is a reac­tion to that and it was sped up by the nwnlations about the pene­tration of tlw Pakistani intelli­gence service," the oflieial said. "It was decided that we had no choice but to free up the hands of our <:ommanders." 
Current and former U.S. fll'li­eials described Bush's orders covering spndal operations and <:onventional forces on condition of anonymity because "execute orders" aw classified. The order was first reported in Thursday's New York Times. 
The Associated Press reported in early August that senior U.S. intelligence and military aides were pressing Bush to give American soldiers greater flexi­bility to operate against al-Qaida and Taliban fighters in Pakistan -for example, sending U.S. spe­cial forces teams into the tribal areas to hit high-value targets. 
The "rules of engagement" have been loosened now, allow­ing troops to conduct border attacks without being fired on first if they witness attaeks com­ing from the region, according to a former U.S. official with recent access to administration think­ing. That would include artillery, rockets and mortar fire from the Pakistan side of the border. 
A senior U.S. military oflieial last week confirmed that a U.S. Special Forces attack had taken place about a mile across Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, killing at least 15. That ollieial spoke on condition of anonymity because the inter­nal debate over the U.S. response to rising violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border indudes discussion of classified intelligence. 
That Sept. 3 raid was the first use of the new authority, which allows military teams to target suspected terrorists in the dan­gerous area along the Afghanistan border, the officials said. At the same time, the administration secretly has given conventional ground troops greater latitude to pursue mili­tants across the Afghan border into Pakistan, they said. 
The focus is on militant havens that have grown on Pakistan's side of the border at the same time a resurgent Taliban has inereased attaeks inside Afghanistan. The situation led Bush on Wednesday to commit to sending more troops there. 
Washington wants Pakistan to do more to crack down on its side of the border. 
Pakistan's inability or unwill­ingness to mount a counterinsur­gency campaign inside the tribal area was discussed at a National Security Council meeting this week. aeeording to notes of the meeting provided to the AP. The notes-said Pakistan is still focused on lighting India and is "still denying the counterinsur­gency problem." 



Lehmnanlookstocurblosses 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK With 
Lehman Brothers' shares sig­
naling another steep drop on 
Friday. top executives are 
racing to put a sale of the 
beleaguered investment bank 
in place before it loses fur­
ther market value and eonfi­
dence. 

Confidence has waned that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. will emerge from the financial crisis as an inde­pendent franchise, and the No. 4 U.S. investment bank is scouring Wall Street for a financial lifeline. Executives worked feverishly in the past 24 hours to find someone willing to buy all or part of the company. bankers and industry executives close to the situation said. 
And the scrutiny is expect­ed to grow more intense Friday, with investors placing bets that Lehman's stock will again nosedive. Shares fell 41 cents, or 9. 7 percent, to $3.81 in after-hours trading; the stock skidded 41.8 per­cent to $4.22 during the reg­ular session in New York, and is down more than 94 per­cent for the year. 
That only puts more pres­sure on Lehman Chief Exeeutive Richard Fuld. who joined the company in 1961 as a college student and now serves as Wall Street's longest-serving CEO. He has tenaeiously resisted putting the company up for sale, but finally relented after a free­fall in its stock price and growing doubts about its sur­vival, according to bankers and industry executives. They asked not to be named because they are not author­ized to comment publicly. 
Bank of America Corp., 
Taya, Recruiter 

Japan's Nomura Securities, Franee's BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank AG and Britain's Barclay's Pic have been mentione'd this week as potential buyers. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.. which also was being talked about as a potential buyer, is not inter­ested, according to an indus­try official who ask not to be named. 
Lehman is also in close contact with both the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve about how to proceed. 
Government offieials. who asked for anonymity because of the sensitivity of the ongo­ing discussions, said that a number of options were being explored and that no decisions had been reached on how any deal involving Lehman would be structured. 
The Fed and the Treasury Department have been work­ing to help resolve Lehman's situation. Fed offici a is are having conversations with relevant parties and getting updates. It's premature to say what form any final resolu­tion would take. 
Any resolution of the Lehman troubles is not· expected to involve the use of government money which would set it apart from the billions of dollars that the government put at risk to facilitate the sale of Bear Stearns in March and to res­cue mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac this week. 
Randy Whitestone. a spokesman for Lehman, declined to comment. 
Lehman's losses soared to almost $7 billion in the last two quarters alone, primarily because of wrong-way bets on mortgage securities and other risky investments. 
It's not alone. Global banks have lost more than $300 bil­lion since the subprime mort­gage crisis spread to the credit markets one year ago. And the International Monetary Fund has suggested total losses globally could hit $1 trillion. 
Lehman Brothers hunted for months for a deep-pocket­ed investor to pump fresh eapital into the l'irm, a move that would help restore confi­dence and replenish its bro­ken balance sheet. Some ana­lysts said Lehman was asking too high a price, others guessed that potential investors found too much risk on its books in the current environment. 
Fuld tried to assuage nerv­ous investors on Wednesday by announcing a plan to sell a 55 percent stake in its prized investment manage­ment business and spin off its commercial real estate hold­ings into a publicly traded company. 
He cast a wide net fur potential investors, bankers and executives said, includ­ing stepping up talks with private equity firms such as Kohlberg Kravis Hoberts & Co. and Bain Capital. 
But analysts increased their criticism of Fuld on Thursday for not naming a potential buyer of its investment man­agement unit, which includes Neuberger Berman, and because they said Lehman would need to finance the real estate spinoff itself.

ELECTION 2008 
Palin defends her qualifications 
Republican vice presidential nominee struggles with foreign policy 
Associated Press 
FORT WAINWRIGHT -John McCain running mate Sarah Palin sought Thursday to defend her qualifications but struggled with foreign policy, unable to describe President Bush's doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against threatening nations and acknowledging she's never met a foreign head of state. 
The Republican vice presiden­tial nominee told Charles Gibson of ABC News in her first televised interview since being named to the GOP ticket that ''I'm ready" to be president if called upon. However, she side­stepped on whether she had the national security credentials needed to be commander in chief. 
Palin, 44, has been Alaska's governor for less than two years and before that was a small­town mayor. She was McCain's surprise selection for the No. 2 slot on the ticket, raising ques­tions about her readiness to serve in the White House, par­ticularly during wartime. 
McCain has defended her qualifications, citing her com­mand of the Alaska National Guard and Alaska's proximity to Russia. 
Asked whether those were sufficient credentials, Palin said: "It is about reform of govern­ment and it's about putting gov­ernment back on the side of the people, and that has much to do with foreign policy and national security issues." She said she brings expertise in making the country energy independent as a former chairman of the 
Alaska  Oil  and  Gas  
Conservation Commission.  
She  acknowledged  that  

national security encompasses more than energy but said: "I want you to not lose sight of the fact that energy is a foundation of national security." 
Palin said other than a trip to visit soldiers in Kuwait and Germany last year -"a trip of a lifetime" that "changed my life" -her only other foreign travel was to Mexico and Canada. She also said she had never met a head of state and added: "If you go back in history and if you ask that question of many vice presidents, they may have the same answer that I just gave you." 

Pressed about what insights 'into recent Russian actions she gained by living in Alaska, Palin answered: "They're our next door neighbors and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska." 
Foreign policy questions dom­inated the first of three inter­views Palin .was giving Gibson over two days. · 
In the interview Thursday, Palin: 
-Appeared unsure of the Bush doctrine -essentially that the United States must help spread democracy to stop ter­rorism and that the nation will act pre-emptively to stop poten­tial foes. 
Asked whether she agreed with that, Palin said: "In what respect, Charlie?" Gibson pressed her for an interpreta­tion of it. She said: "His world view." That prompted Gibson to say "no, the Bush doctrine, enunciated September 2002, before the Iraq war" and describe it to her. 
"I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do is rid this world of Islamic extremism, terrorists who are hell bent on destroying our nation," Palin said, though added "there have been mistakes made." 
Pressed repeatedly on whether the United States could attack terrorist hideouts in Pakistan without the country's permission, she said: "If there is legitimate and enough intelli­gence that tells us that a strike is imminent against American people, we have every right to defend our country. In fact, the president has the obligation, the duty to defend." 



Trade deficit raises 6.7 percent 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON America's trade deficit shot up in July to the highest level in 16 months as oil imports hit an all-time high, offsetting strong export growth. The deficit with China climbed to the second highest level on record. 
The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the deficit rose by 5. 7 percent to $62.2 billion in July, much worse than the $58 billion deficit that Wall Street expected. It pushed the gap between what America imports and what it sells abroad to the highest level since March 2007. 
The trade deterioration reflected the fact that crude oil prices hit a record in July, pushing America's for­eign oil bill to an all-time high of $51.4 billion, up 13.7 percent from June. 
The big rise in oil prices, with the average barrel of imported crude jumping to a record $124.66, pushed overall imports up by 3.9 
percent to a record $230.3 billion. 
That increase offset anoth­er strong showing for U.S. exports which rose by 3.3 percent to a record $168.1 billion, reflecting big gains in overseas sales of commer­cial aircraft, computers and U.S.-made cars. Exports have been the major bright spot for the U.S. economy in a year when the country has been battered by a pro­longed slump in housing, ris­ing unemployment and a severe credit crunch. 
The Bush administration points to the export gains as justification for its support of free trade. However, Democrats contend the administration's pursuit of free-trade agreements left 
U.S. workers exposed to unfair competition from low­wage countries with poor environmental records such as China. 
They blame the loss of more than 3 million manu­facturing jobs since Bush took office in part on the soaring trade deficits, 
employment losses that have hit hard in key presidential battleground states such as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has said he will renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico to get greater protec­tion for U.S. workers. Republican John McCain has accused Obama of seeking to erect protectionist barriers that will make America less competitive in the global economy. 
In July, the politically sen­sitive deficit with China increased 16.1 percent to $24.9 billion, the second highest gap on record. 
Critics contend the admin­istration has not done enough to combat unfair Chinese trade practices such as the country's currency system, which U.S. manufac­turers say keeps the Chinese yuan undervalued by as much as 40 percent against the American dollar. That makes Chinese goods cheap-

VENEZUELA 

Chavez orders U.S. out of country 
Associated Press 
CARACAS -President Hugo Chavez ordered the U.S. ambassador to leave Venezuela within 72 hours on Thursday, accusing the diplo­mat of conspiring against his government and saying he would also withdraw his own envoy from Washington·imme­diately. 
Chavez made the move in solidarity with Bolivia after his Andean ally expelled the U.S. diplomat there, accusing him of aiding violent protests. He said a new American ambas­sador will not be welcome in Caracas "until there's a U.S. government that respects the people of Latin America," sug­gesting that diplomatic rela­tions will be scaled back until President Bush leaves the White House. 
"They're trying to do here what they were doing in Bolivia," Chavez said, accusing Washington of trying to oust him. 
"That's enough ... from you, Yankees," Chavez said, using an expletive. Waving his fists in the air, he added: "I hold the government of the United States responsible for being behind all the conspiracies against our nations!" 
Holding up a watch to check the time, Chavez declared: "From this moment, the Yankee ambassador in Caracas has 72 hours to leave Venezuela!" He told his foreign minister to recall Venezuela's ambassador to Washington, Bernardo Alvarez, "before they kick him out of there." 
The U.S. Embassy said it was aware of Chavez's speech but had not received official notification. Embassy spokes­woman Robin Holzhauer said Ambassador Patrick Duddy is traveling in the United States this week. 
The diplomatic spat brings relations between the two countries to a new low and raises questions about whether it could hurt trade. Venezuela is the fourth-largest oil supplier to the United States, and Chavez also threat­ened to cut off crude ship­ments "if there's any aggres­sion against Venezuela." 
Chavez has threatened to stop selling oil to the United States on a number of occa­sions. But the U.S. is Venezuela's No. 1 oil client, and taking such an action would debilitate his govern­ment fmancially. 


Man acquitted of charges filed in 1964 
Associated Press 
JACKSON -A man acquit­ted this week on federal charges of abducting two black teenagers slain in 1964 is sick, has no criminal record and should be released from prison immedi­ately, his attorneys said Thursday. 
State and federal authori­ties, meanwhile, scrambled to review the decades-old case in hopes of keeping reputed Ku Klux Klansman James Ford Seale behind bars. 
Seale, 73, was convicted in June 2007 and spent just over a year in prison on kid­napping and conspiracy charges related to the abduc­tion and slayings of Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee. The two 19­year-old friends were allegedly beaten, weighted down and thrown, possibly still alive, into a Mississippi River backwater in May 1964. 
Federal authorities had praised Seale's conviction and three life sentences as proof that civil rights era killings had not been forgot­ten. But now that an appeals court has overturned Seale's conviction, his attorneys want him released immediately. 
"This new exceptional cir­cumstance, combined with the still existing factors of Mr. Seale's advanced age and debilitating health problems, makes continued detention inappropriate in this case," they wrote in a motion filed Thursday with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Seale is in a prison in Indiana, where he has been treated for cancer, bone spurs and other health prob­lems. His attorneys said in their motion that he is nei­ther a flight risk nor a danger to the community. 
A three-judge panel of the appeals court overturned Seale's conviction Tuesday, ruling that the statute of limi­tations for kidnapping had expired in the more than 40 years between the abductions and Seale's arrest. The case had been cold for years when Moore's brother, who was working on a film about the killings, found Seale in south Mississippi in 2005. Many thought he was dead. 
Federal prosecutors can appeal, but legal experts say it is unlikely the ruling will be reversed. 
Seale could, however, be tried on state murder charges, which have no statute of limitations. Mississippi's attorney general and a district attorney in Franklin County, where Dee and Moore were abducted, are reviewing the case. 
"This has been a collabora­tive effort since the beginning -our office, the U.S. attor­ney's office and law enforce­ment. And I've been in com­munication with them and obviously we're discussing our possibilities and dis­cussing what is our most advantageous way to pro­

Woman pleads guilty to arson 
Associated Press 
DETHOIT -A Detroit woman pleaded guilty Thursday to setting a New Year's Eve 1999 fire at Michigan State University, an act of ceo-terrorism, and also admitted roles in 12 other incidents. 
Marie Mason, 46. and Frank Ambrose, 33, were accused of pouring gasoline and starting a fire to protest research on genetically modified plants. Ambrose already has pleaded guilty and will be sentenced Sept. 22. 
Fumes from the gasoline caused an explosion. The fire caused more than $1 million in damage at MSU's Agriculture Hall. It also destroyed records related to the government's $2 million support for the research. 
"There was no intention to harm any living thing," Mason's defense attorney, John Minock, said in an inter­view. "They didn't intend to 
cause an  explosion. They just  
wanted  to  damage  some  
paper."  

Mason appeared in federal court in Grand Hapids to plead guilty to conspiracy and arson charges, ineluding an incident that destroyed logging equip­ment in northern Michigan a day after the MSU fire. 
SOUTH KOREA 
Kin1 Jong 11 suffers possible paralysis 
Associated Press 
SEOUL -North Korea's Kim .long II had brain sur­gery after a stroke last month and could have par­tial paralysis on one side, media reports said Thursday, after the South Korean government said the communist leader remained in control of his country. 
Fornign doctors, possibly from China and France, per­formed the operation after Kim. 66, collapsed about Aug. 15, the newspapers Dong-a llbo and .loongAng llbo rnportnd, citing uniden­tified govm·nnwnt oiTieials. 
Kim's condition has improved and he is not suf­fering from slurred speech, a disability ol'ten associated with a stroke. the reports said. 
llowever, he has suffered from sporadic spasms, according to South Korea's largest newspaper, Chosun llbo. citing a high-level Chinese official. 
Kim is the object of an intense personality cult in tho totalitarian nation and the sight of him su!Tering spasms before a massive crowd would be an embar­rassment that eould under­mine that status. lie missed a parade Tunsday eommem­
o rating th(~ eo m m u n is t state's founding 60 years ago. 
If Kim wore incapacitated, 
U.S. Attorney Charles Gross has called it "domestic terror­ism, plain and simple." 
The government says Mason and Ambrose were affiliated with the Earth Liberation Front, a radical band of envi­ronmentalists. They were married at the time but divorced earlier this year. 
Minock said prosecutors built their case against Mason with help from Ambrose, who tape-recorded their conversa­tions in 2007. 
Ambrose's attorney, Michael Brady, declined to comment. Assistant U.S. Attorney Hagen Frank could not be reached. 
The explosion at MSU burned Mason's hair and pre­vented her from finishing the message, "No GMO," on a wall, a reference to genetically modified organisms. She and Ambrose fled the building and drove 190 miles north to Empire. 
In her plea agreement, Mason also admits involve­ment in 12 other acts with property damage pegged at more than $2.5 million. 
They include the destruction of four homes under construc­tion in Washtenaw and Macomb counties and an attempted arson at an Ice Mountain bottled water pump­ing station in Mecosta County, all in 2003. 
it could have serious impli­cations for international negotiations on North Korea's nuclear disarma­ment. The talks recently hit a snag because of a dispute between North Korea and the U.S. over how to verify the North's nuclear pro­grams, and a delay by Washington in its promised removal of North Korea from a list or nations that sponsor terrorism. 
"I only hope that any situa­tion happening in DPRK should not affect negatively what has been going on in terms of denuclearization process" U.N. Secretary­General Ban Ki-moon told a news conference on Thursday at the United Nations, using the initials of North Korea's ofncial name. 
''I'm also concerned deeply by DPHK's decision to go back to reassembling the nuclear facilities. They must commit to their agreement among the six-party talks for the early realization of the denuclearization process," said Ban, who was South Korea's foreign minister before ta-king the helm of the 
U.N. in January 2007. 
Lee Cheol-woo, a South Korean ruling party law­maker, said in a radio inter­view Thursday that Kim is "recovering fast," has "no problem speaking and com­municating," and is "able to stand if assisted." 


PAKISTAN 

Prime nUnister supports U.S. rebuke 
Associated Press 
ISLAMABAD -Pakistan's prime minister on Thursday backed a harsh rebuke of the 
U.S. by the Muslim nation's mili­tary chief, a sign of a strain in relations seven years after the Sept. 11 attacks forged the two countries' anti-terror alliance. 
Pakistan's public show of anger with the U.S. comes amid revela­tions that President Bush secretly approved new U.S. military raids in that country. 
A former intelligence official told The Assoeiated Press that President Bush signed the classi­fied order over the summer. It gives new authority to U.S. spe­cial operations forces to target suspected terrorists in the dan­gerous area along the Afghanistan border. 
U.S. counterterror operations along the border are highly unpopular in Pakistan, whose new leadership is trying hard to show independence from Washington. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the classified order. 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he will press Pakistan to allow U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan to take a new approach to hunting Taliban and al-Qaida-linked militants who slip back and forth between the neighboring nations. But Brown offered no specifics on how the border could be better defended. 
Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the powerful but media-shy army leader, said a week after a deadly American-led ground assault in Pakistani territory that Pakistan wou1d defend its sovereignty and that there was no deal to allow foreign forces to operate inside its borders.

He said unilateral actions risked undermining joint efforts to battle Islamic extremism and warned that "the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country will be defended at all cost." 
"No external force is allowed to 
conduct  operations  inside  
Pakistan,"  he  said  in  the  
Wednesday statement.  

Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, in comments reported Thursday by state media and confirmed by his office, said Kayani's words reflected govern­ment opinion and policy. 
U.S. officials say clearing mili­tants from such pockets in Pakistan's semiautonomous tribal regions is critical to reducing attacks on NATO and American forces in Afghanistan. 
"Until we work more closely with the Pakistani government to eliminate the safe havens from which they operate, the enemy will only keep coming," Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. 
However, NATO insisted it won't launch cross-border raids into Pakistan. 
"It is not NATO that will be sending its forces across the bor­der," said alliance spokesman James Appathurai at a news con­ference. He stressed that the mandate of the 47,000 strong NATO force in Afghanistan stops at the border. 
"There are no ground or air incursions by NATO forces into Pakistani territory," Appathurai insisted. "The solution to the ten­sion across the border, or on these cross-border issues is first and foremost a solution to the growing extremism." 
An informal meeting of NATO defense ministers in London next Thursday and Friday will also discuss operations in Afghanistan. 
The former U.S. intelligence official said the Pakistani govern­ment is not told about the targets of U.S. attacks in advance because of concerns that the Pakistani intelligence service and military are infiltrated by al­Qaida and Taliban supporters. 
Also, the "ru1es of engagement" have been loosened, allowing troops to conduct border attacks without being fired on first if they witness attacks eoming from the region, the official said. 
Many Pakistanis blame their nation's alliance with the U.S. for fueling violence in their country, while U.S. offieials worry that Pakistan's government is secretly aiding militant networks -keep­ing them as a wedge against longtime rival India. 
Kayani's statement was signifi­cant because he so rarely speaks publicly and because he heads Pakistan's most powerful institu­tion. His remarks indicated he was sensitive to anger among Pakistanis, and possibly even within the military, over the assault and suspected missile strikes, analysts said Thursday. 
"It expresses a deep concern in Pakistan and was quite timely because of the feeling in Pakistan as if the army and the govern­ment of Pakistan has surren­dered to whatever Americans want to do in the tribal regions," political analyst Rasul Bakhsh Rais said. 
U.S. officials have acknowl­edged that American troops car­ried out the operation in South Waziristan but have not given details. The mission's goal and resu1ts remain unclear. Local res­idents said at least 15 people died.

Hurricane depletes Red Cross funds 

Relief organization plunges into debt, requests federal funding 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The wave of storms battering the U.S. has plunged the American Red Cross deep into debt as it rush­es to prepare for Hurricane Ike, prompting a searching look at how to stabilize its finances. 
Gail McGovern, who became the embattled charity's presi­dent in June, said even a request for federal funding is under consideration as the Red Cross seeks to become less dependent on spontaneous donations that arrive only in the wake of huge disasters. 
"We are going to explore every avenue we can to ensure we have a healthy Red Cross," McGovern said in an interview Thursday as her organization deployed 1,000 out-of-state volunteers to Texas to await menacing Ike. 
"We're brainstorming absolutely anything," she said. "We're looking at the possibili­ty of appropriations, whatever -because we want to be able to serve the American public." 
As of last week, when Ike was still a distant threat, the Red Cross said it has raised only $5 million to cover costs from Hurricane Gustav that will total at least $40 million, possibly more than $70 million. It has borrowed money to meet those bills, and now is incur­ring more expenses as it shifts response teams to Texas and readies its shelters. 
"The beautiful thing about the American Red Cross is we are going to be there when people need us," McGovern said. "As the disaster relief fund depletes, we will borrow money if we need to, to be there." 
McGovern said Red Cross officials were calling Gustav a "silent disaster" because it entailed sizable costs for shel­tering displaced people, yet did not trigger the flood of dona­tions that often follows more deadly and destructive storms. 
With Ike, McGovern said, the Red Cross wants to be ready even though it has no idea how damaging or costly the storm will be. It launched a new fundraising appeal Monday, and will get a plug this week­end when the NFL encourages donations with on-air and in­stadium announcements dur­ing its games. 
The Red Cross endured wide­spread criticism -some from within its own ranks -after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005. An internal report cited overwhelmed vol­unteers, inflexible attitudes and inadequate anti-fraud measures. 
One major change since then, McGovern said, is a greater focus on getting relief supplies into threatened areas before a hurricane arrives. 
"With Katrina, we had the supplies, but they were in the wrong place," she said. 
More broadly, McGovern said, the Red Cross needs steadier funding sources in addition to what she called "episodic fundraising" -the gifts, often relatively small, that pour in after a large-scale disaster rouses public sympa­thy. 
She said the Red Cross will always welcome these gifts, but wants to encourage corpora­tion donations and large con­tributions from wealthy indi­viduals that are not linked to the latest disaster. 
"The American public is going to be moved when they see a time of need," she said. "It's incumbent on us to be very clear about our mission so they understand there are other times to give, too. It's our responsibility to explain our mission better." 

Despite the depleted relief fund, and Ike's approach, McGovern said she was not anxious. 
"The reason I'm calm and cool and collected is because the American public always comes through for us ­always," she said. "We put out a campaign for our local chap­ters to raise money because of Gustav.... I've gotten e-mail after e-mail saying, 'We are behind you, this is a defining moment, we can do it.' 
"I just believe that this coun­try will not let harm come to the American Red Cross." 

Army sees rise in soldier suicides 
Associated Press 

DENVER -The Army's top medical officer says command­ers are looking to their counter­parts in the Air Force and in civilian agencies for ways to cope with an alarming increase in suicides. 
"We work real closely with the Veterans Administration, who have for many years taken the lead in this," Lt. Gen. Eric B. Schoomaker, the Army's sur­geon general, said Wednesday in a telephone interview. "We've also looked across the services and at other models that have been more successful than our own." 
The Army's suicide rate was 
18.1 per 100,000 last year, the highest since the service started keeping records in 1980. It was 
9.8 just five years earlier. The U.S. civilian rate is 19.5 per 100,000. 
Leading factors behind sol­dier suicides are troubled per­sonal relationships; legal, fman­cial and work problems; and repeated deployments and longer tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Army says. 
Schoomaker said the Army has redoubled its prevention efforts and looked outside for new models, especially to the Air Force, which he said suc­cessfully encouraged support systems to reduce suicides. 
The Army's program includes removing the stigma from ask­ing for help, encouraging sol­diers to look after each other and a campaign called ACE, for Ask, Care and Escort. 
"We ask that people extend themselves to a fellow soldier or family member that may be suf­fering," Schoomaker said. "We ask that you make the effort to ask, 'Are you in trouble?"' 
Offering care may be as sim­ple as keeping a weapon out of a troubled soldier's reach, he said. Soldiers and families should then escort the soldier to a medical facility. 
Schoomaker acknowledged that encouraging troubled sol­diers to ask for help requires a cultural change. 
"We are an Army that has historically been associated with strength and being imper­vious to threats to the human psyche and the body, and of course that's a myth," he said. 
He hopes to use the Army's "warrior ethos" to get soldiers to look out for one another's mental health. 
"It's an extension of our war­rior ethos that no soldier is ever left behind," he said. 
Schoomaker said the Army will analyze individual suicides and suicide attempts, police reports and incidents of mis­conduct as well as the overall numbers of suicides and attempts to see if the program is working.

The doctor is in 
A friend recently told me: "Lou Holtz is my old man crush." While I was sur­prised at the phrasing, I was not sur­prised that she loved Lou Holtz. If there is one person that 
Notre Dame (as well as St. Mary's) students unanimously love it is Fr. Hesburgh, but if there is another person that we love, that person is certainly Lou Holtz. Holtz might even be more Bob Kessler beloved on campus now then he was House ofStix when he left, and since he is coming back this weekend to speak at the pep rally, accept his statue and be honored at the game, I wondered why students still love him all these years later. 
"You wanna be happy for a day: Eat a Steak. You wanna be happy for three days: buy a car. You wanna be happy for a week: Go on a cruise. You wanna be happy for a year: Win the lottery. But ifyou want to be happy for the rest ofyour life: Win a championship for Notre Dame." -LH 
Not only does this season mark the 20th anniversary of Holtz's champi­onship (and embarrassingly our last), but it also marks the first year that stu­dents have entered this University hav­ing not been alive for said champi­onship. The oldest students here were eleven years old when Holtz was forced out, I mean resigned, from coaching here, yet we love him just the same. Having been this young when Holtz left Notre Dame, we must love Lou for rea­sons other than our memories of his coaching. I believe that the students today love Lou not only because of his Notre Dame legacy, but also because of his work on ESPN. 
"If what you did yesterday seems big, you haven't done anything today. " -LH 
When Holtz finally retired from coaching in 2004 he took a job working as a college football analyst for ESPN, and for the past several years he has worked on the College GameDay Final show with Rece Davis and Mark May. Working for ESPN, Lou Holtz has rein­vented himself and created new legions of fans at Notre Dame. While we would have respected his legacy regardless, Lou has reached out to thousands of new fans by proclaiming his undying love for Notre Dame every Saturday night on ESPN. His work at ESPN is made even more compelling because of the man who sits next to him in the studio: a Mr. Mark May. 
"There's only one way you get respect, and that's by looking some­body in the eye for sixty minutes." -LH 
If Lou Holtz is one of the men that Notre Dame Students love the most, Mr. May is one we collectively hate the most. For the past three years Mr. May 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Don't forget the president 
At the risk of redundancy, I would like to echo Mr. Heilbrun's ("A thanks to NDSP," Sept 10) thanks in Wednesday's Observer. We all are indebted to NDSP's courageous efforts to combat the growing menance of Natty shotgunning. I know I speak for everyone when I offer my unequivocal support for their commitment to qual­ity police work. 
If I might, though, I would like to further extend his thanks to the president of this fine university. It is only through Fr. John Jenkins care for and extensive understanding of his student body that this quality police work may continue. 
I'd keep going with this but, unfortunately, I lack the ability to mask my disgust with sarcasm. All it would take from the president is a modicum of effort to address off campus violence. A phone call, maybe two, to SBPD from South Bend's largest employer would speak volumes, but in a continuation of his pattern of gross negligence and ineptitude Jenkins refuses to put the issue on the table. 
If I sound angry, I apologize. Maybe it's because two of my roommates were assaulted this week­end. Maybe it's because the self serving, smug pat on the back our incompetent police force managed to sneak on to the front page of this paper struck a nerve. Or maybe it's because when another friend managed to squeeze his way into Jenkin's office hours and dared to raise the issue, the president dismissed him with patronizing lip service. 
What I want to know is what exactly will it take for someone in the University to at least pretend to care? Clearly repeated assaults rank somewhere below developing new dorms, growing the endow­ment and canceling the Vagina Monologues. I would have thought a multiple shooting would force them to act, but even after the tragedy in front of Club 23, no progress has been made. I shudder to think what would actually guilt our administration into action. 
So another year begins and we look forward to more irrelevant football arrests, empty talk and inaction. Sad isn't it? 
Michael Folger 
sentor 
offcampus Sept. 10 
has chastised Charlie Weis and the Notre Dame Football Team at every conceivable opportunity. Maybe this is because Coach Weis began his tenure here by crushing May's alma mater Pittsburgh, or maybe this is because May is jealous that he was never grant­ed the opportunity to attend our great University. Regardless, Mark May seemingly hates Notre Dame, forcing us to hate him. 
The thing is: I actually like Mark May. Let this sink in for a moment. 
At least, I like him insofar as he is the perfect complement for Lou Holtz on Saturday nights. Without May, Holtz probably wouldn't be as popular amongst students as he was when he was coaching. May and Holtz make each other more interesting. Their banter regarding Notre Dame is not only highly entertaining for us to watch, but it also keeps Notre Dame relevant at the national level (as opposed to having relevance equal to Cal Poly). Holtz and May arguing about Notre Dame is one of the primary rea­sons that I watch their show. In fact, it's a big reason why people watch any ESPN show. 
Tony and Wilbon. Lee and Kirk. Jay and Woody. ESPN has become a forum for sportswriters' arguments. The net­work loves to broadcast feuds, and we love to watch them. This adversarial nature brings a level of excitement to sports journalism that just does not appear in print. When we watch these shows, we want to jump into the argu­ment and make our own case for the teams and athletes that we love. 
That's why we love Lou Holtz, because he stands up for Notre Dame against Mark May. No matter how bad things look, Holtz will always believe in Notre Dame as an institution, and he will always be rooting for our football team. What's even better is that he does it in a way that makes us proud. He never yells back at Mr. May, he never gets sucked into the adversarial ESPN ethos; he will just laugh off Mr. May's comments and move on. 
"/ can't believe that God put us on this earth to be ordinary. " -LH 

Even though he has not worked here in years, Holtz is still an admirable representative for the university. We love him not only because he was our last championship coach, but also because no matter how poorly the administration treated him at the end of his tenure, he still loves and defends this university and our football team. We love him because he loves us. Then again, maybe we just love all of those great sound bytes.

The views expressed in this column are those of the author and not necessarily those ofThe Observer. 
Focus on what's important 
Christina Pesavento's article from Sept. 9, "Selfishness vs. Self-Sacrifice," reads ·like a recita­tion of Republican talking points instead of a rea­soned political argument. 
As is typical in an election year, unfounded char­acter attacks tend to take precedent over a discus­sion of the issues. I am not discrediting John McCain's service to the United States during the Vietnam War, including his time as a tortured pris­oner of war. He demonstrated bravery and courage, and he nearly sacrificed his life in service of his country. I believe that such loyalty to the United States is an important trait for a leader to possess. 
What bothers me is that McCain's military record and his time as a POW is constantly used, as it is in Pesavento's article, as McCain's primary and trumping qualification to be the next president of the United States, while Barack Obama is con­demned for having no such qualifications. While such an experience can provide valuable insights, the past two presidents, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, have had negligible military service records, and John Kerry, another decorated Vietnam veteran, lost the election in 2004. 
Pesavento is right about one thing-McCain's actions do "speak loudly enough to stand alone." Though Pesavento claims McCain is devoted "to America and to its people rather than to his party or to himself," how does this compare to McCain's voting with George Bush 90 percent of the time or his ownership of seven houses? McCain has also consistently voted against legislation for veterans' rights (despite being an heroic veteran), against a Martin Luther King Day for the state of Arizona, and against healthcare for children (SCHIP). Shouldn't we be focusing on this type of informa­tion in the upcoming election? 
Instead of criticizing Obama for the locations of his speeches, find a policy or plan to criticize. Instead of citing only McCain's heroic past, add to it by talking about his present voting records or his path for foreign policy. According to how Pesavento's article reads, Obama is "selfish" because he graduated from Columbia and Harvard Law, became the first African-American of the Harvard Law Review, and wrote an autobiography. As long as claims such as these are being made, we are being distracted from the real issues at hand in this election that will shape the future of our nation.

By JIM McGUIRE 

Anna Faris is one of today's best comic actress­es. with her wide-eyed charm and dead-on deliv­ery. The trailer for "The House Bunny" ("I think I ed some money over here by this manhole") y made people want to rush out and see it as as possible. Admittedly, without Faris, "The ouse Bunny" might have become more bogged own than it already is by cliched jokes about umb blondes and how wild and crazy those darn 
liege kids are. 

At the beginning of the lilm, Shelley Darlington 
Faris) is introdueed, a pretty and bubbly (albeit slightly odd) aspiring centerfold who lives with Hugh llefner, "Girls Next Door" style, at the Playboy Mansion. Life is great for Shelley until one day she is unceremoniously tossed from the man­sion for being too old (27 is 59 in bunny years),and is forced to fend for herself. 
Alone with nothing but her bust and blonde hair to help her, Shelley stumbles onto a college cam­pus (USC in disguise) and meets the misfits of the ZETA sorority house. 
Led by the nerdy but energetic Natalie, (the very funny Emma Stone from "Superbad"), the ZETA girls (a rag-tag group of Goths, tomboys, hermits and a pregnant co-ed) are iooking for a new house mother to help them attract pledges and save their house from being sold. Shelley takes the job, and hilarity and a serious makeover ensue. 
The House Bunny 

Starring: Anna Faris, Colin Hanks, Emma Stone Directed by: Fred Wolf 
The plot is c'on , , bUt one at in. Shelley tries to teach the girls how to flirt and be sexy with sporadic results, but it is only after the ZETA girls get total hair and wardrobe makeovers (i.e. they all dress like Shelley in skimpy pink outfits with too much make-up) that they are able to come out of their shells and start being popular with the rest of campus. 
The movie actually gets a little boring for a ; · · stretch of about 15 minutes in the middle, as pret-d ., ty people just don't have problems, but things eome crashing down when the ZETAs realize they have become elitist fakes like the girls in the other· sororities and blame Shelley. Everything works out in the end when the girls realize how much Shelley means to them and get her back on cam-: pus just in time to save the ZETA house with a rousing (if not odd) speech about loving yourself. 
"The House Bunny" as a whole is uneven. Things like the competition with the other sorority, and Shelley's courtship of the bookish Oliver (Colin Hanks) weren't as funny or 11eshed out as they were probably intended to be. None of those things really ruined the enjoyment of the film because one always knows that the next scene will feature Anna Faris getting into some sort o shenanigans. 
What really gets one laughing is the quote-wor­thy oddities that kept coming out of Faris's mouth, from ignorance of social mores ("I think I'll have the mahi-mahi, but can I get it with just one mahi?") to sheer absurdities ("! like that word. Manhole.") 
It's easy to find Faris's wacky, wide-eyed comedy style to be endearing, and it is fun to watch her start on a tangent, not knowing where she will go. Faris's Shelley, despite being perky and gorgeous, is really a lovable loser, craving acceptance and love just like all the ZETAs. Without Faris, though, one shudders to think about whf-t kind of unfunny mess "The House Bunny" might nave turned into. 
The movie may have you very well giggling like a schoolgirl. However, the plot was not compelling enough to keep one in ones seat by itself, and the burden of carrying an entire movie (especially a comedy) on your shoulders is more than a comedi­enne just acquiring her leading lady status should. have to deal with.

Twins fall further behind in AL Central race 
Moyer, Howard power Phillies past the Brewers to pull within three games of the NL East-leading Mets 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOI.IS -In the end, Minnnsota's bullpen blew another cmn-after the latest strong start by Francisco Liriano. 
This was a bad time for the Twins to stop hitting, though­not to mnntion make one big mistake on the bases. 
David DeJesus hit the winning single in the 1Oth inning for the Kansas City Hoyals in a 3-2 vic­tory at Minnesota on Thursday, keeping the Twins in second place for at least another day and wasting eight impressive innings by Liriano. 
"We didn't score enough runs today. That's the bottom line. Our pitching was great," said catcher Mike Hedmond. 
l.iriano's longest start since July 28, 2006, which matched the second-longest outing of his career. wasn't enough. Minnesota woke up one game back in the AI. Central race, with the White Sox hosting Toronto at night. 
Matt Guerrier (6-8) gave up two one-out singles in the 1Oth before DeJesus hit the first pitch from Dennys Reyes into lel't field for the lead, putting relievers on the hook for eight of the team's last 11 losses. The Twins have lost 12 of their last 18 overall. 
The seeds of defeat were sewn long before they lost for the fifth time in their last six extra-inning games, however. Minnesota, by far the best in the majors this year with run­ners in scoring position, squan­dered several opportunities to build a healthy lead against starter Brandon Duckworth and reliever Ron Mahay. 
After Carlos Gomez gave the Twins a 2-1 lead with a one-out HBI single in the second, he took a lead off first base and fell for Duckworth's slide step, froze, and stumbled. He got into a rundown and was eventually tagged out trying to dive back into the bag. 
"Just looked like he was not paying much attention," an upset manager Hon Gardenhire said. "lie just kind of jumped out there." 
Gomez said he wasn't trying to steal. 
"It happens. Nobody wants to be in a situation like this," said Gomez, whose energy and exu­berance has worked against him and his team many times 


CLASSIFIEDS 
this year. 

He wasn't the only offensive culprit. Alexi Casilla grounded into a double play to end the fifth, and Hedmond did the same to squelch a potential rally in the sixth after consecu­tive singles started the frame. With two on and two out in the seventh, Casilla popped out to third. 
"These guys get paid to get you out, and today they did that," Redmond said. 
Indeed, and Mahay, John Bale, Ramon Hamirez (3-2), and Joakim Soria (36th save) com­bined for five scoreless innings with only one hit and one walk allowed after Duckworth left two batters into the sixth. He gave up seven hits and two walks while striking out five. 
"We feel that anytime we get into the bullpen, we can match up with just about anybody," Duckworth said. 
The Twins haven't said that in awhile. Liriano retired 17 of his last 18 batters before turning the ninth over to Joe Nathan, who pitched a perfect inning. But Guerrier and Reyes could­n't get the outs they needed. Guerrier's ERA rose to 4.84. 
"These guys are fine. We're going to be fine," Hedmond said. "It's just a mindset. What's happened has happened." 
Phillies 6, Brewers 3 

Jamie Moyer can rest his arm when he retires. For now, the old man is doing whatever it takes to extend the Philadelphia Phillies' season. 
Moyer pitched five and two­thirds innings on three days' rest, Ryan Howard hit his major league-leading 43rd homer and the Phillies beat the Milwaukee Brewers Thursday night to gain ground in the playoff race. 
"He's been consistent all year," manager Charlie Manuel said of Moyer, the oldest player in the majors. "Goes to show you the old man can still pitch." 
The Phillies pulled within three games of the NL East­leading Mets and the wild card­leading Brewers by roughing up Ben Sheets (13-8). They remain four behind New York in the loss column. 
Moyer (14-7) allowed three runs and four hits, improving to 7-1 in his last 13 starts. The 45­year-old left-bander moved past Hall of Farner Juan Marichal and into a tie with Jack Powell for 49th on the career list with 244 wins. 

Pitching on short rest for the first time since 2004, Moyer kept the Brewers off balance with his usual assortment of batting practice-speed fastballs and even slower stuff. He left after Prince Fielder's two-run drive made it 4-3. 
"As I got deeper, I think I got a little tired a little quicker," Moyer said. ''I'm here, I'm healthy. Sometimes you have to step up." 
Fielder's homer was his first since Aug. 13, but slumping Milwaukee lost for the eighth time in 11 games. 
"This series has no more importance or value than the last series, but every day is important, every game is important," Brewers manager Ned Yost said. "It's must-win, that must be your mind-set in September." 
Ryan Madson pitched two innings, Chad Durbin threw one pitch to retire the only batter he faced with two on in the eighth and Brad Lidge finished for his 36th save in as many chances. 
But it was Moyer who gave the ailing Phillies a big lift by taking the mound and making sure they played with a lead. 
"Jamie did a great job," Howard said. "Anything is pos­sible with him." 
Sheets entered with a 20­inning scoreless streak, but couldn't extend it. The All-Star right-hander allowed five runs and nine hits in six innings. 
"We've got to win some games," Sheets said. "I got a good vibe when the game ended. I know we didn't win, but I feel better today." 
Howard connected in the first to give the Phillies a 2-0 lead. He launched a first-pitch fast­ball into the bushes beyond the center-field wall for his fourth homer in six games. 
"I have to produce runs," Howard said. "Whatever I can do to get the team going and provide a spark, I try to do." 
J.J. Hardy sliced the lead in half with a two-out homer in the third, but the Phillies answered with two runs in the fourth. 
Howard nearly hit another two-run shot, settling for an RBI double when his drive to center bounced off the top of the wall. It was his major league-leading 129th RBI. Pedro Feliz lined a two-out double just over right fielder Corey Hart's head to make it 4­1. 
Fielder had gone 67 at-bats without a homer before going deep in the sixth. 
Carlos Ruiz had an RBI dou­ble in the bottom half to give Philadelphia a two-run cushion. His eighth-inning suicide squeeze, a rarity for the Phillies, provided the final mar­gin. 
"I figured I might as well start trying to be a National League manager," Manuel joked. "I heard Ruiz as he was going up the steps ask somebody what the squeeze sign was. I figured he wants to squeeze, so I let him do it."

Associated Press 

NASHVILLE, Tenn. ­Titans quarterback Vince Young insists he never wavered in his commit­ment to football. 
All that concern over his mental state? He says he was upset as he dealt with his first serious injury, and he didn't realize he had to tell his mother where he was going any­more. 
Then the media went overboard. 
Young spoke publicly Thursday for the first time since Titans coach Jeff Fisher called police for help in locating the quar­terback Monday night because of concerns over his emotional well-being. His mother, Felicia Young, also told a local newspa­per that the quarterback had indicated he didn't want to play football any­more because of all the negativity he faced. 
"I was never depressed," Young said. 
He took questions from reporters for 16 minutes after watching his team­mates practice. His mes­sage? Don't question his commitment. 
"Football, this is my life. This is my dream. All I did all these years growing up to get to this point and never had an injury like this before in my life," he said. 
"It's a hard time 
because I'm a competitor, 
and I definitely want to be 
out on the football field 
with my teammates." 
Questions about his 
mental state and attitude started Sunday when the third-year quarterback was booed heavily by fans upset at his second inter­ception, and he appeared as if he didn't want to return to the game. Fisher · pulled his headset off and talked to him before the quarterback joined the 
rest of the offense. 
Four plays later, Young 
sprained his left medial 
collateral ligament when 
Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith crashed into his left knee. 

Young didn't go to the Titans' headquarters Monday, and Fisher went to his quarterback's house. The Titans also sent a psychologist and another team official to talk with Young. He was described as being emo­tionally down. Young said Thursday that lasted half a day and he was upset over his two interceptions. 
Fisher told Young to go take the MRI exam need­ed to determine the extent of the damage to his knee. Young didn't go. But with so many people at his house, Young said, he needed space to think. 
IN BRIEF Saints release Thomas,
include option for return 
METAIRIE, La. -The New Orleans Saints reached a settle­ment with injured defensive tackle Hollis Thomas, allowing the 12­year veteran to come back later this season with the Saints or any other team. "He knows if he gets this thing rehabbed and is able to come back 100 percent, then (returning to the Saints is) certainly an option," coach Sean Payton said after Thursday's practice. Payton initially announced on Wednesday that Thomas, who had surgery to repair a torn right tri­ceps, was going to be placed on injured reserve. That would have ended the defensive tackle's sea­son, but also would have kept him under contract with New Orleans in 2009. However, Thomas agreed to an undisclosed payment in order to get his release. 
Brewers' Kapler tears mus­
cle, could miss rest of season 
MILWAUKEE -Brewers right fielder Gabe Kapler has a torn muscle in his right shoulder and could miss the rest of the season. 
Kapler will stay in Milwaukee and undergo physical therapy with the team in an effort to determine whether he can return this year. 
The team said Thursday that Kapler is hopeful he can return this year, but gave no timetable for his recovery. 
He left Wednesday's game after making a hard throw to the plate in the sixth inning against the Cincinnati Reds. 
With the Reds leading 3-1, Kapler's throw kept Edwin Encarnacion from attempting to score on Jay Bruce's single, but Kapler, in the lineup for struggling All-Star Corey Hart, immediately winced in pain and grabbed for his shoulder. 
OSU's Wells downgraded 
to doubtful for USC game 
COLUMBUS-Ohio State coach Jim Tressel said Thursday it is doubtful that starting tailback Chris "Beanie" Wells will play Saturday night against No. 1 Southern California. 
Tressel said there was lingering soreness for Wells in his right foot after he worked out on Wednesday night. Wells did not practice with the team Thursday morning just before it departed for Los Angeles. 
"We were hoping he'd wake up this morning and feel even better than yesterday," Tressel said short­ly before boarding the team bus to the airport. "But it didn't happen. We'll see from here." 
Wells injured his right foot in the fifth-ranked Buckeyes' opener against Youngstown State, did not play last week against Ohio and has not had contact in partial prac­tices this week. He flew with the team on Thursday afternoon.

NFL 
Williams negotiated own contract extension 
Associated Press 
DAVIE, Fla. -Always one to go against the grain, Ricky Williams negotiated his own contract exten­sion with Bill Parcells and the Miami Dolphins, including a verbal agreement regarding a perform­ance bonus. 
Williams, 31, said he didn't ask the Dolphins to forgive the $8.6 million he has owed them since a 2004 ruling by an arbitrator. He said the extension upset his agent, Leigh Steinberg. 
"He's mad because I didn't talk to him about it," Williams said Thursday. "He was looking for­ward to me becoming a free agent." 
Williams could have tested free agency for the first time after this season. Instead, on Aug. 31 he signed a contract that included a one-year extension through 2009. 
The 1998 Heisman Trophy win­ner and 2002 NFL rushing cham­pion said Parcells offered the extension, and the deal was done in less than a week. 
"I trust my gut feelings about it," Williams said. "I thought about it, I talked to my family, I talked to my financial advisers, and my only concern was if I had a pretty good year, then I might feel like I was undercompensated. I brought that up to Bill, and he agreed, and we came to an agreement." 
The verbal agreement is for a bonus of more than $1 million if Williams rushes for more than 1,100 yards this year, he said. That will be difficult because he's split­ting carries with Ronnie Brown. 
Williams was to earn the veter­an minimum of $730,000 this year. The new contract adds a $93,000 roster bonus per game, which could bring his 2008 salary to $2.2 million. Next year his salary will be $3.3 million. None of the money is guaranteed. 
The Dolphins and Steinberg declined comment. Williams said his independent approach to the negotiations might not be right for most players. 
"It's rare to have a situation where you can trust manage­ment," he said. "The assumption most people make is that a team is going to look out solely for their own best interests." 
Williams has always taken an unusual approach to his career. The rapper Master P's agency negotiated Williams' first NFL con­tract, and most of that seven-year, $68 million deal with the New Orleans Saints was based on incentive bonuses difficult to earn. 
An abrupt one-year retirement and violations of the league's sub­stance abuse policy have limited him to 13 games since 2003. 


An arbitrator ruled Williams breached his contract by retiring, and he was ordered to repay the Dolphins $8.6 million in bonus money. The Dolphins have never tried to collect, and while they could garnish his wages, Williams said he saw no reason to raise the subject in contract talks. 
"It never for one day has ever been an issue," he said. "As long as the Dolphins and I have a good relationship -from Day 1 since I came back, it has never been an issue." 

Williams said the new contract means he's set for life financially, allowing him to support his three children and attend medical school when he retires from the NFL.

Freshman Jay Wooten added field goals of 43, 29 and 27 yards. 
The victory was the Tar Heels' biggest since a 52-17 win over Duke in 2001. 
The start is the best since 2000 for North Carolina, which is looking for its first winning season since 2001. The Tar Heels were 4-8 a year ago in Davis' first season. 
The start is worst for the Scarlet Knights since 2002, 

when they finished 1-11 in Schiano's second season. It also was the worst horne loss since being thrashed 40-0 by West Virginia that same year. 
In many ways, the Scarlet Knights looked like the Hutgers of old. They blew pass coverages on all three of Yates' TD passes, had a bad punt lnad to a North Carolina score and saw their senior quarterback turn the ball over three times. 
By the time the third quarter was over, North Carolina had a 38-6 lead and only a couple or thousand fans from the sell­out crowd of 42,502 were on hand for a derisive cheer when Teel threw a fourth­quarter touchdown pass to Kevin Brock. 
San San Te kicked field goals of 34 and 32 yards for Hutgers, which came into the season looking for a fourth straight bowl trip. After losing two at home, the Scarlet Knights need to turn things around quickly. 
Davis, who hired Schiano.as his defensive coordinator at Miami, saw his team improve markedly after struggling in the season opener against McNeese State. 
Yates finished 14-of-22 for 221 yards and matched his career high with the three TD passes. Tate caught four pass­es for a career-best 138 yards. His 69-yard touchdown catch was the longest of his career.

NCAA BASKETBALL 
Community mourns death of former coach 
Associated Press 
EL PASO, Texas Thousands of people filled the Don Haskins Center on Thursday night to remember the basketball coach in a memorial service that took on the atmosphere of a college game. 
The arena's television screens showed a 1997 roast of Haskins, known to the basket­ball world as "The Bear" and to fans and players as simply "Coach," while a spotlight shone on the 1966 NCAA 
"Coach Haskins lived to be a winner not just in the Xs and Os," said Nevil Shed, one of Haskins' starters on the 1966 team. "And he instilled in us that on the court you had to do your best, but after all this bas­ketball you have to be a winner in life. Each and every one of his players still has a good por­tion of Coach Haskins in them." 
Shed, the first to get the foul whistle from Brown, recalled fondly that while there were times -mostly in the midst of seemingly endless practice ­he hated Haskins he's a better

The score­board was lit up with the final score of that game­T e x a s Western College, 72, Kentucky 65 -as it was during a public view­

ing for Haskins on Tuesday. Haskins died Sunday. He was 78. 
The Texas-El Paso marching band was on hand and former referee Irv Brown even stood guard with a whistle to cut off speakers who went over their allotted time in a service that was expected to last three hours. 
Former players, coaches and others praised Haskins for his dedication to his players and offered censored versions of stories of a coach known as much for his skill as his color­ful language. 
man for having played for him. 
"I can always say I thank God for my mother and father and I can say thank God for Don Haskins and all he did for me," 
Shed said. 
Nolan Richardson, who played for Haskins during his first two years in El Paso and was a national champions as a coach at Arkansas, recalled seeing Haskins and his wife, Mary, arrive as a young coach in 1961. He said Haskins told him he couldn't "guard a tele­graph pole" and suggested he stick to football. 
"He was not political and you loved him for it," Richardson said. "What you saw was what you got. And I loved that so much. I tried to emulate that in my career. The championships we won (at Arkansas) with our kids, it all came from The Bear." 

Before taking the podium Thursday, Richardson described Haskins as a "men­tor and a good friend." 
"You are talking about a crown jewel," Richardson said. 
·Richardson said while Haskins never acknowledged knowing what it meant for him 
to start to five black players in the 1966 championship game against an all-white Kentucky squad, he believes Haskins always knew what he was doing. 
"He was a simple man with values," Richardson said. "Had he known the values he had maybe he wouldn't have been so good." 
Countless friends and former 

players, including Tim Hardaway and Antonio Davis, filled the arena's floor Thursday. 
Those who knew Haskins best said this week that he would have hated the spectacle of thousands of people paying tribute to him. But family friend Jim Paul said this was the one time they didn't give Haskins a vote.

Marquette  keeper  Matt  
Pyzdrowski near post.  

The rest of the first half saw the game settle down into a more back-and-forth eontest between both teams, and the Irish would enter the locker room with a 1-0 half­time lead. Irish coach Bobby Clark said he wasn't satisfied with the halftime lead. 
"We talk about eoming out strong every game, and we certainly drew Ithe players I attention to the fact that their performance dropped of'f' quite drastically in the second hall' of the first hall'," Clark said. 
Clark's words certainly seemed to re-energize his squad as Notre Dame turned a tight game into a blowout within the first 10 minutes of the second half. At the cen­ter of' it was once again was Donahue. 
Four minutes into the sec­ond hall', defender Jack Traynor hit an in-swinging 

free kick flicked on by mid­fielder Michael Thomas into a serum of bodies in front of the Golden Eagles net. Donahue was quickest to react and jammed the loose ball into the back of the net for his second goal of the evening. 
Six minutes later the junior midl'ielder turned provider as his low cross was received at the top of the box by Thomas, whose deft touch created enough space to fire far-post past Pyzdrowski. Donahue would complete his evening in the 64th minute when he poked home a loose ball after reaching it first. 
"You score one goal and you're happy as a wide mid­field player, so to score three goals is special," Clark said of Donahue's hat trick. "[Donahue's] served his time coming ofT the bench. Now he's in a starter's role, and h~'s re~lly taking advantage of that. 
Although Donahue's per­formance will be most remembered for his hat trick, the wide midfielder also looked dangerous in his more traditional role of get­ting wide and serving balls into the box -a point that Donahue emphasized. 
"My main job is to be step­ping on their backs and mid­fielders, just taking a touch and serving balls into the box to our big guys," Donahue said. "Last year, my role was more coming off the bench and raising the tempo. This year I've earned a start­ing spot, and hopefully I can keep the tempo raised from the start." 
About the only negative on the evening for Coach Clark and his squad came near the end of the first half when starting forward Jeb Brovsky left the game because of an injury. Clark said Brovsky felt he could have returned in the second half, but the doctors wanted to him out as a precaution. 
Regardless, Brovsky should have plenty of time to let his injury heal as Notre Dame's next game isn't until Sept. 19, when the Irish welcome St. John's to Alumni Field.

Field of 400 avvaits Saint Mary's in Peoria 
By KATE GRABAREK 
Sports Writer 

The Irish will test their mettle against more than 400 runners today at the Bradley Invitational in Peoria, Ill. 
Belles coach Jackie Bauters said she want.'> the team to get a good base time for the 5-kilome­ter race. 
"The team is looking great," Bauters said. "We have work to do, but I'm very happy with the start of the season." 
Earlier this season the Belles hosted the Alumnae Exhibition race. It was the first time the team ran together in a competi­tive format since losing its top two runners from last season. 
"I think the team ran great together during the alumnae race," Bauters said. "And while I believe they are all working very hard, without much outside competition I think it isn't as true of a representation of what we're capable of at this time." 
Last weekend the Belles took fourth place at the Ilokem Karem in Crawfordsville, Ind. The race was a relay format with the top three finishing teams contributing to the team score. Many upperclassmen stepped up to help the Belles fm­ish fourth. Junior Megan McClowry and freshman Adrianne Hodriguez, who fin­ished 1Oth overall with a time of 23:45, led the team. NAIA team Indiana Tech claimed the crown. 
One strength for Saint Mary's this year is its good mix of upper and und~m:lassmen. 
"I thought they wem gnmt at the llokem Karem," Bauters said. "Everyone really pushed themselves as hard as they could and I bdieve not knowing the caliber of the other teams was of bonefit to us." 
Bautnrs said she is looking f(Jr her team to go out hard and race well against the vast com­petition. 
"I want to see the team go out on the course and not hold bark." Bauters said. "We will be tirnd but I still want to see them men~.ally go in ready to com­pete. 
So far this season, the team is what Bauters expected it to be. She said there have yet to be many surprises and that no one has really stepped up, but instead runners have filled the voids left by the graduation of Megan Gray. 
The Belles head to the Calvin Invitational on Sept. 20.

Up first today at 3 p.m. is No. 16 Cal Poly (4-2), who in coming off a tough loss to No. 2 Nebraska. Senior opposite Kylie Atherstone, who earned her conference-record tenth Big West Player of the Week honors last week, leads the Mustangs. Atherstone aver­aged 3.78 kills and 1.11 aces per set and had a .342 hitting percentage as Cal Poly posted a 2-1 mark at its Sept. 5-6 Paso Robles Marriott Invitational. 
Before this year, junior set­ter Hailey Fithian's had earned just 125 total assists in 34 sets of action. Overcoming her inexperience, Fithian has already compiled 251 assists through six matches this year and fea­tures a 10.46 assists-per-set average that ranks second among Big West players and 47th in Division I. 
Things do not get any easier for the Irish on Saturday, when they face No. 4 California (5-0), Notre Dame's highest ranked opponent of the year thus far. The Irish took the Bears to five sets after losing the first two in a neutral-site match last sea­son.

four years.,,

After watching Gay, who were both U.S. relay fighting teams drop the Doug Logan injuries, joined 
baton in the USA Track and Field CEO 
Walker and 

400-meter pre­liminaries and seeing the U.S. men win only four gold medals, CEO Doug Logan has decided to form a panel of former athletes and coaches to analyze USATF's high-per­formance programs. 
"This will probably be an uncomfortable exercise," Logan wrote Thursday in his blog on the USATF Web site. "But, this is not a 'knee jerk' reaction, or a 'witch hunt,' or an attempt to castigate any­one. Indeed, this panel may determine that the factors leading to less-than-optimal performance were beyond anyone's control." 
The Americans took home 23 medals from Beijing ­
Hoffa in failing to win medals. S a n y a Richards (400), Allyson Felix 
(200) and Lolo Jones (100 hurdles) were other favorites who did not win. Wariner was beaten by another American, LaShawn Merritt, in the 400. 
Logan did his own analysis of the results and the num­bers were no better. 
Not counting relays, he said there were 66 individual per­formances in men's competi­tion and 65 in women's. Only seven of the men (10.6 per­cent) and 11 of the women 
(16.9 percent) performed at their peak level for 2008 in Beijing. 
Meanwhile, the relays that have long been considered 
America's signature event resulted in stunning disap­pointments, at least in the 400-meter races. Gay and Lauryn Williams were both involved in bad exchanges that knocked the U.S. team out in the preliminary round. Gay did not participate at the 
U.S. training camp in Dalian, China, where two intensive relay practices were held. 
"The expectation is that we should dominate" in relays, Logan said. "They are also the activity that we, as an organi­zation, should have the great­est control over. We select the athletes and train and coach them." 
Logan noted that since 2003, in world championship and Olympic competition, there have been eight 400­meter relay medal opportuni­ties. In four of the eight, the 
U.S. teams failed to make the finals. From 1999 through 2003, Americans won medals in seven of eight 400 relays. 
"We need to determine what has changed in the last four years,'' Logan said. 
The Americans did salvage things by winning both 1,600­meter relays, but their seven overall gold medals were one fewer than the previous two Olympics and only one more than their worst showings in 1972 and 1976, when there were fewer events.

to know some of the play­ers that they'll be lining up against." 
For some of these recruits, it's the first time they will have ever set foot on the Notre Dame campus. Becaus of this, the coaching staff will have to pull out all the stops to make an impres­sion. 
Four-star defensive end Davon Custis out of Columbus, Ohio, is a first­time visitor. The Saint Francis DeSales High School product liked the Irish early in the recruiting process, but later faded after some miscommunication with the Irish coaching staff. After the problem was solved, Custis is now on good terms with Notre Dame, and this visit could be what the Irish need to pick up another commitment. 
"Custis has never been to Notre Dame, so this first impression will be crucial," Frank said. "He's a smart kid, came from a similar environment in a Catholic high school, so he could like the campus. He's a big-time player that a lot of programs are after and could fit in nicely in this class." 
Another player that has yet to see Notre Dame is Nyshier Oliver, a safety from Jersey City, N.J. Oliver origi­nally committed to Tennessee, but later reopened his recruitment and saw an Irish offer come rolling in the following morning. Frank said he thinks this could potentially be a case in which a visit went a long way to swaying the player. 
"Nyshier hasn't been either, but he has a strong interest in the Irish," he said. "This is the first shot the coaching staff really has to impress him, and I think he's seriously considering Notre Dame. He's definitely going to take a serious look when he's on campus." 
Chris Bonds is a defensive end from Richland Northeast High School in Columbia, S.C., who will also be in attendance. Bonds is hearing from most of the schools in the Southeastern Conference and will need to see some impressive features of the Irish program if Notre Dame is to stay in the race. 
Not only will high school seniors considering the Irish be present against Michigan, but also juniors, who are beginning to receive their initial offers, will be there. For these recruits, it's essentially the first time many of them will be taking visits. 

A pair of Illinois blue-chip­pers, defensive end Chance Carter out of Loyola Academy and offensive line­man Christian Lombard from Fremd High School, are both visiting and stand in high regard in the coaching staff's eyes. If Notre Dame can showcase its program well, these visits from jun­iors could give the Irish an advantage in landing both of them. 
During these visits, the coaching staff will give the prospects a tour and field their questions. 
"It's not as intense as an unofficial visit," Frank said. "Because the coaches have to worry about the game, they won't have a lot of time to be around the recruits. They'll probably take them around campus, show them the [Gugliemo Athletics com­plex,] and meet with some professors. For the 2010 kids, these first impressions are real important to put the program on the map."

will be playing with their new No. 2 ranking. But Waldrum said the team isn't concerned with the number. 
"One thing that we've never really done is worry a whole lot about the rankings.... It's some­thing we haven't spent a lot of time and we don't really talk about it with the team," Waldrum said. 
"At the end of the day I think all of our players have been here long enough and the staff's been here long enough to know that it's how you end and not us, and a lot of teams spend a lot of time defending on us," Waldrum said. 

But that doesn't mean the Irish have altered their style of play. 
"We're not doing a lot of things differently than what we normally do in training because we see those styles an awful lot as we go through the season," Waldrum said. "But I think the key for us is just coming out with the intensity that we need to come out with and that we play with the speed we need to play with." 
And while the Irish have no intention of changing their tac­tics, that doesn't mean they won't look to get some different

But the one thing that's remained consistent in the Irish lineup is their defense. Carrie Dew, Schuveiller and Elise Weber have all remained in the backfield.

Junior Donahue's hat trick spearheads a 4-1 win over Marquette in first conference game 
By GREG ARBOGAST Sports Writer 
Last year Notre Dame won a share of the Big East Blue division title. If Thursday night was any indication, the Irish are in no mood to give up their crown. 
No. 5 Notre Dame wel­comed visiting Marquette with a convincing 4-1 defeat at Alumni Field in both team's first game of Big East conference play. 
The Irish started the game with a flurry of offensive chances serving multiple dangerous balls into the box, but it wasn't until the 17th minute t·hat Notre Dame broke through. A couple of one-touch passes found wide midfielder Dave Donahue, who served a cross into the path of a crashing Bright Dike. The forward's volley was blocked, but Donahue collected the clearance, took

Tonight is likely to be a Texas showdown -well, sort off. 
The No. 2 Irish are set to take on Southern Methodist University, but they won't be the only Texans on the field. 
Irish coach Randy Waldrum is a native of Irving, Texas, an alum of Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, and oh, before he came to Notre Dame, he coached at Baylor. Assistant coach Dawn Greathouse played for Waldrum at Baylor and graduated in 2001. But the list goes on. The Irish roster is composed of eight Texas natives, including stand­outs Kerri Hanks and Jessica Schuveiller.

First slate of tough teams for ND squad 
By JARED JEDICK 
Coming off a tough weekend in Idaho, there is no rest for the weary as the Irish are gearing up to face their stiffest test of year at the Diet Coke Classic in Minneapolis. 
On the docket for the Irish (3-3) are three ranked teams in the CBS College Sports Network/AVCA Division I Coaches Poll: No. 16 Cal Poly, No. 4 California and No. 11 Minnesota. 
Leading the team is junior outside hitter Christina Kaelin's 60 kills and freshman defensive specialistllibero firency Silva's 88 digs. 
Notre Dame's three victories have come against IPFW, Nevada and Washington State this year, but they have yet to face teams with the talent they are going to face this weekend. 
The Irish are coming off a 3­0 loss to Idaho in which they were only able to manage a .074 hitting percentage while committing nine service errors and six serve-receptions errors. Idaho put 15 team blocks on Notre Dame in the sweep.
