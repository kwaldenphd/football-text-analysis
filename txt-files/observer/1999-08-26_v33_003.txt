Telescope consortium broadens Irish horizons 
By ERIN PIROUTEK 
News Wrirer 

By joining an international consor­li um to build a Large Binocular Telcscppe (LBT). Notre Danrn hopes to strengthen its nationally respected astrophysics program as well as ben­
e l'it  undergraduate  and  faculty  
recruiting.  
"This is  a  new oru  in telescope  

building," said Torrence Hottig, asso­ciate physics prof'nssor who spnar­headoc! the University's 11f'fort to join tlrn consortium. 
The teloscopc. used to search for other planetary systems, will be the world's largest optical/inf'rarnd tele­scope on a single mount. With its twin 8.4 meter mirrors atop Mt. Graham in Arizona. it will be lhe pre­mier ol.iservalory for imagining plan­etary disks around nearby stars, Rettig explained. 
Tho tolescope, lo Im compleled in 2002. will also enablB study or the origin and ,wolution ol' stars, galaxies and tlw universe, Hettig added. 
"It will be a remarkable technologi­cal achievement capable of images that no otluir telescope can obtain," said Jef1'rcy Kantor, vice president and ussociat11 provost, in a stalenrnnt announcing the agreement. 
As a part of' llrn consortium. Notre Dame will have immediate access lo other telescopes operated by the University of Arizona ·s Steward Observatory. Aslronomy students and those conducting 11ndergraduate research will bnnelit l'rom LBT data, according lo Bruce Bunknr. chair of tlw physics clnpartnrnnt. 
"Being .i. memlrnr of this Uri' con­sortium will give u1Hlergraduatcs opportunities that lhey never had before." said Hnttig. 
Membership in Lim consortium is expected lo signilicantly impact !'ac­uity recruitment. llarvard professor Peter Garnavich will begin studying al Notre Dame in .January. 
"Already, it has marln a big dif'f'er­nncc," said Bunknr. "IGarnavichl was definitely attractnd bncausn or Urn Liff." 
Notre Danw's participation also is expected to foster acad(!Jllic coopera­tion; current consortium memb(!l'S include Ohio Stalo, University of' Arizona. Arcntri Astrophysical Institute and a German consortium of rnscarch institutes.

INSIDE COLUMN 



Big East welcomes Virginia Tech 
Chocolate is as 
chocolate does 
First of all, I have lo state that this isn't a "choice." It's genetic. Inborn. Do you think if I had a choice about this, I would ·choose to go 
against societal norms? To facH  cunsLant  
ridicule'' Don't you think I  ·  
would rather be normal?  
Well, here it is. I'm coming  
out of the closet:  
I. Do. Not. Like. Chocolate.  
I don't like chocolate. At  
all. In  any form.  What's  
more, I never have.  
I can hear you all gasping  
in horror and disbelief. I'm  
used to that. ff I said 1·ct  
bumped off a family mem• Laura Petelle  
ber, I might get some under­ 
standing. ff I'd run over a As sistant 
priest, I might get some sym­ 
Mapathy. Rut when I explain I  naging  
Edon't like chocolate, peoplP  ditor  
react as  if I'd just calmly  
announced I were an ax murderer.  

They recoil, gasp and demand, "What's WRUNG with you?" 
It's not normal in this country to dislike chocu­lat1!. My own mothnr frnquently forgets that in 21 years, I have never eaten chocolate and she oflcn tries to serve it to me (ol' course, !'vu never eaten broccoli willingly in 21 years, but she still serves me that too). 
Good friends or many yi-mrs, who I'm sure I've told lime and time again that I will not eat it, constantly ofter me chocolate. It can make things awkward at parties where someone has a home­made cake and really wants me to try it -and I look and discowr it's chocolate. I lry to chokn down a bite or two with a smile. before rnshing to_ find something to drink. Everybody brings M&Ms or chocolate-chot:olale t:hip wokitis to section meetings, makes hot cho(:olate on cold winter nights. and serves chocolate chippit~ pan­cakes as a breakfast treat. I'm lel't with whatever nun-chocolate munchablns I can rustli: up. 
The worst part about being anti-chocolate is thal everyone is convinced lhal he or she can "turn" you. John assures, "Oh you'll like Tl11S kind." Mary cajoles, "Just try a little. EVEHYONE likes chocolate." 
Everyone but me. 

It doesn't stop with l'riends. Waitrnsses, llight attendents and miscellaneous passers-by who overhear the conversation arn all amaznd when I refuse chocolate. "Oh, on a diet'?" they sympa­thetically ask. 
No no no no! No diet. Ijust don't likP chocolate. 
"Oh, you have such self'-rnntrol," they sigh enviously. What. like it's noble to not eat a food that makes you gag'! 
Someday we non-chocolate-eaters -all three of' us -are going to rise up in revolution, protesting years of forgoing desert because the only offering is chocolate cake. We'll get even for the years of shocked stares and disgusted looks. 
Until then, all you chocolate-lovers should try to celebrate th,~ diversity of' your non-d10colatD eating friends. Don't ridiculn us for b!)ing dilfor­enl. Don't insist that "normal" peopll~ like chom­late. And show your support for our alternativP life-style: serve a no11-d10colute dussnrt al y()ur next party. 
But above all, pleas,~. pl1mse, pleas,: do nol bake me a choculalli cake fur my birthday. And if' you do, don't expect me to eat it.

MORGANTOWN, W.V. 
The Big East Conference has found its 14th member and to nobody's surprisl', Virginia Tech is the 5eleciion. 
Conference Presidents Committee chairman B:ev. Philip Smith made the announcement Tuesday. 
For the Big East. this marks t.he first rull-member expansion since 1994, when Notro Uame, Rutgers and West Virginia joined the confer­ence. 
"We am very much excited for the opportunity to join the Big East as a full-time member," Virginia Tech Athletic Director Jim Weaver said. "lt's something this institution has held as a goal for months.,.

"We are very much excited for the opportunity to join the Big East as a full-time member." 
Jim Weaver Virginia Tech Athletic Director 
member of the original Big East Football Conference, which formed in 1991. 
The Big East Conference conducts 20 championships in 16 men's and women's collegiate athletics and Virginia Tech maintains varsity ath­letic programs in 15 Big East sports. 
Weaver said Virginia Tech ·s full­time membership brings "brand name identity in all of' Iour] marketing." 
"Right now," Weaver added, "we talk about the Big East from Labor Day to Christmas, and the Atlantic 10 from New Year's to Memorial Day. In between, we talk about what conference we are going to." 
The original Big East Conference was founded in May 1979. and included Boston College, Connecticut, Georgetown, Providence, St. John's, Seton Hall and Syracuse. Villanova joined in 1980 and Pittsburgh signed on in 1982. 
The conforence gained national acclaim during the mid-and late­1980s, when it became a power in Division I basketball and routinely advanced members to the Final Pour and national championship games. 

Colorado may lose documents 
UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO 

The University of Colorado at Boulder may lose a signil'icant portion of its world-renownnd human­righls repository. The preeminent archive program is not fiscally and philosophically compatible with the goals of the university's so-called "Total Learning Environment" initiative. sources familiar with the situ­ation told the Colorado Daily on Tuesday. CU Boulder's human-rights repository -currently the largest academic collection of non-governmental human-rights materials in the world -contains docu­ments donated by the Guatemala Human Bights Commission, the Soviet Jewry Hescue Movement, and the El Salvador Archive Project. The repository is also ho1mi to documents bestowed by Physicians for Human Hights, the Women's International Lnague for Peace and Freedom and the U.S. Department of State, which endowed f11es pertaining to atrocities by Iraqi secret police forces during the Persian Gulf War. 
Accused Arizona athletes will play 
AHIZONA STATE UNIVEHSITY 

_Arizona h_ead football coach Dick Tomey Tuesday ~aid the 14 loothall players accused of stealing money from a CatCard employee will not bn suspended and can play in Saturday's.season openor against Penn State. After delaying the release of the football players' names o~ the bas_is th~t the investigation could be compro­mised, Umvers1ty of Arizona police Tuesday identified the mainly freshman players under investigation. Included in the group are four athletes listed as second­string players on the Wildcats' roster. All are new to the University of Arizona program. Freshman wide recniver Bobby Wade, junior defensive end Austin Uku, sopho­more strong safety Zaharius Johnson and sophomore cornerback Anthony Banks are among the investigative leads on the list. But police are stressing that the play­ers have not been charged with any crime. "Th,ise men are investigative leads," said Sgt. Michael Smith, a UAPD spokesman. "They haven't been charged with anything." ,

VENEZUELA 
Chavez strives to root out corruption 
Auociated Press 
·cAllACAS 
Venezuela's Congress and the Supreme Court are in their death throes. The constitution is headed for history·s trash bin. Traditional political par­ties have retroated into obliv­ion. 
Such is tlw t'ate of" vietims of' 

President  H ugu  Chavez's  
"social  rnvolution''  in  
Venezuela.  

With litth1 or no resistance. Chavez, a former coup leader who sw1:ipt to power with promises to lift the pour and crush the corrupt, is achieving what long eluded revolutionar­ies from Mexico to Argentina: a wholesale. spectacular break from the past. 
It's probably still too early lo tell if Chavez's exploits will be good or bad for Venezuela. But lifo hem will definitnly never be the same. 
Chavez, a former paratruop­er who staged a !'ailed coup attempt in 1992, says a major shake-up of Venezuela's insti­tutions is necessary to root out some of the world's worst political corruption. Well over half the country's 23 million people live in poverty even though tl11: country sits on more petroleum than any nation outside the Middle East. 
But critics say Chavez's moves concentrate power in his own hands, eliminate democratic checks and bal­ances and work against his goal of reducing corruption. 
Chavez has raised Venezuelans' hopes like few leaders before him, despite an acute economic recession and the loss of some 500,000 jobs since he took office in February. 
The president has been criti­cized for giving the army a big­ger role in soci<~ly, appointing fellow coup plotters to top gov­ernment posts. But his use of soldiers to fix roads, build schools and tend to tlw sick has been well received, and his approval rating is over 70 per­cent. 
Gone are tbe days when two traditional parties -the cen­ter-right Copei and the center­left Democratic Action -con­trolled everything from horsP racing tu TV broadcasting to hiring at tlw government steel company. 

And many pillars or Venezuela's old political world do not wish to retire quietly into the night. "We are not museum pieces," protested for­mer President Luis Herrera Campins of Copei. 
Bul it appears Liley have little 
choice. 
A constitutional assumbly ­
conceiv!~d by Chav,i,. and domi­
nated by his supporters -is 
usurping the !'unctions or both 
Congress and the courts, nei­
ther of which appear willing or 
able to do much about iL 
Cecilia Susa, the president of 
the Supreme Court, resigned 
Tuesday to protest a court rul­
ing supporting tlrn assf1mhly's 
decision to give itself vast new 
powers to lire juuges and over­
haul the judicial system. . 
"The court simply committed 
suieide to avoid being assassi­
nated. But the result is th(i 
same. It is dead," Sosa 
declared. 
On Wednesday, the assembly 
-whose original purpuse was 
to draft a new constitution, 
Venezuela's 26th -discussed 
its next assault on Venezuela's 
establishment: a takeovtH of 
most or Congress's duties. 
Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole 
coalition, which won more 
than 90 percent or the assem­
bly's 131 seats in elections last 
month, has touted its decision 
not tu dissolve Congrnss and 
the courts as an example of its 
magnanimity. 
The truth is, lhere was little 
need to dissolve them formally 
because thev are alreadv 
largely defunct. Bowing t~ 
Chavez forces, the opposilion­
contrnlled legislature recessed 
last month, though its leaders 
announced Wednesday they 
will meet Friday to discuss the 
threats to Congress's existence. 
llenrique Capriles Hadonsky, 
the 27-ye ar-old presid en t of 
the lower house of Congress. 
said he has been keeping a 
"low prolile" to avoid "heating 
up tlrn spirits" of th11 powerful 
constitutional assembly. 
A new Congress and 
Suprnme Court are expected to 
emflrge from thn constitutional 
assembly, prnbably some lime ·early next year. 
But some worry Chavez will 
find wavs tu stack the institu­
tions with his f'ollowers, and 
that them will Im little room 
!'or opposition voices in the 
new Venezuela.

ISRAEL 
Negotiator delays Washington trip 
Associated P ce,s 
JEHUSALEM 
The top Palestinian negotia­tor delayed a trip to Washington Wednesday amid reports that the Israelis and Palestinians are close to a com promise on reviving a U.S.-brokered peace accord. 
Sacb Ernkat said he would continun talks Thursday with Israeli 11egutiator Gilead Sher on two major deadlocked issues: the release of 1'alesti11ia11s jailed for anti­lsrnel attacks; and a timetable for an Israeli with­drawal from the West Bank outlined in the accords bro­kered by President Clinton at Wve Biver, Md. last October. 
;,We were unable to bridge any of tlrn gaps," Erekat told The Associated Press after six hours of discussion Wednesday. "Tomorrow we hope to bti in a position to linalize these two issues." 
Erekat had been schedulf'.d to brief Secretary of' State Madeleine Albright on the peace talks Thursday, but canceled his llight to continue negotiations. State Dept. spokesman James Foley said Erekat was now expected in Washington Thursday night and would brief Albright on Friday. 
Erekat said he believed a solution to the talk's impasse would only come once Prime Minister Ehud Barak made a ''political decision" to com­promise. 
In a statement issued law Wednesday night, Barak's 
"We were unable to bridge any ofthe gaps. Tomorrow we hope to be in a position to finalize these ... issues. " 
Saeb Erekat Palestinian peace negotiator 
office said that ii' an agree­ment on a timetable was no1 reached soon, Israel would implement the Wyo accords as it saw fit. 
Barak's hard-line predeces­sor, Benjamin Netanyahu, froze Wye a month after he signed the accord. Barak, promising in his campaign to revive the peace process, trounced Nctanyahu in May elections. 
Initial Palestinian expecta­tions that Barak would imme­diately implement the pro­gram have all hut dissipated. 
The Palestinians say Wye mandates the release of 650 Palestinians jailnd for anti­Israel attacks; Israel says only 500 arc _eligible for release, and it refuses to let go Palestinians involved in killing Israelis. 
Both sides agree on the dimensions of' the Israeli withdrawal outlined in Wye -11 percent -but Barak wants to stretch it into next year, while the Palestinians want an immediate with­drawal. 
Palestinian negotiators, speaking on condition ol' anonymity, said talks were still d1mdlocked on prisoners, 
but were close to a break­
through on the withdrawal 
timetable. They said the 
withdrawal may be complet­
ed by January. 
Israeli army radio and the 

Maariv newspaper reported 
Wednesday that an agree­
m en t would be achieved 

"within a few days" and that 
a "fcstiV!l signing ceremony" 

would likely take place in Egypt and the Nile River Valley. 
In another sign of optimism, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday that overall peace talks with Israel could be wrapped up in the relatively near l'uture. 
The original peace frame­work was set May 4, 1999 as the date for signing a peace trnaty. When that date was missed, Arafat agreed to dnlay declaration of an inde­pendent Palestinian state by one year. 
Negotiations on a final peace treaty have not begun, but asked if it is realistic to r-ixpect tho peace treaty talks lo be concluded by next May, Arafat replied, "More realistic than anything else." 
Israel radio reported Wednesday that Palestinian police have arrested 12 mem­bers or militant Islamic groups opposed to the peace process. The arrests of the Islamic Jihad and Hamas mil­itants Tuesday night in the Bethlehem area, bring the number or Islamic militants ddairnid bv the Palestinian Authority fn rncent days to. 50, according to radio announcements.

probably know him better by the name i\ndy, the guy with bushy eyebrows in a Bull Shop whose segment has been the nightcap on the granddaddy of network news mugazines for longer than anyone can remember. But his surname or eyebrows aren't really important. and neither is my definition. Either, way he's made it. Fighting boredom like Andy might grapple with a quandary, I made the half an hour trip from my home in 1-won't-say­where to what I had been told was his in None-of-Your-Business. 0 could leak it I suppose. but discretiou is the gmatest l'orm of prowling, and I would hate lo encourage this type or behavior.) 
I knew how to get to Andy's, but had no real ...... business being there ­let alone a plan l'or when I arrived. I parked my car along his rural ­road, hallway in a ditch and 300 yards down a sloping drive­way from the summer place. It was a Thursday allnrnoun in mid-July, and Lhe stin was opprnssive, stilling activi­ty nverywhere in Llrn area. That's one dic!H~d way of saying it was hot out. Andy's housP faced the road, which 1nc•ant I had to ket)p my head turned 90 degrees to get a look al it. I started to fear a crick in my neck and wedgcid my right hand between Llrn !mad rest to massagt! in the swimt. Then I decided that the pain was just the price of b1dng a fan; no physical pnril is Loo grnat an obstad(~ lo spotting this sagn of sarcastk scribery. Andy had givlln nw counUtiss small chunks of his "60 Minutes" over thn ycmrs. and ct little pati(rncn hem was tlrn least I could do to rnpay him. 
I thought for a while of' getting out and climbing the small hill to Andy's front door. 
Fear did a little to dissuadt\ me, but not quite as much as speechlessness or disinterest. And thP heal: it was hot out them -and a long way up that driveway. 
I roally didn't have much tu say to Andy anyway, next to "llello" and "Nice column you turn out.'' By the time tho 

both or us got to the door and shared only that pleasantry, 
I'm sure we wpuld both have wished only that we hadn't 
bothered. There was probably a lot Andy could tell me -and not just because he is so many times published. renowned and had met the likes of lfomingway. Andy is one of' those people -old some might call it -who have been smelling the fresh newsprint of history for the better part of' a century. They carried fish home in the headlines I can only read about and study. I thought of some things I might be able to tell him, how the Mets wern l'aring r(-lcently or about tlrn bad dour handk1s on my Volkswagen, but I dBcided he probably wouldn't be interested. I've never been prcs1mt at a World War, but I bet it gives you a more profound perspective on things than you can get watching ESPN with three friends and a couple of beers.

I stayed about an hour at Andy's place with no sign of any­one. much less the successful and well-traveled author. If he did come uutsidn, say, to water the llow­ers, maybe Andy would walk down the driveway and greet m<i himself. Probably nut though: more likely he would see for himself how hot it was and return inside for some lemonade. I would if I were him. I thought about Andy 
as I sat there; his · unique style and the volumes of his work. !IP had been ask­
ing, "Did you ever wonder this?" or "What's up with 
that?" long before anyone had heard of' 
Seinfeld or D<rnnis Miller. Some might 
say Andy's success stemm<\d purely from the typ<' of pungent cyni­

reserved for grizzled old nrnn. Ile's get­

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 


Why learn a foreign language? 
In most of the world outside thti U.S.. an avfwag<i economically a!l1u­ent citizen will be lluent in two or three languages. Ytis, you say, people in other countries may need lo know English or G<irman in order to sur­vive in today's business world. Because you do know how to speak and write in English. you don't think you have this problem. By speaking only English, you may not havn an actual problt~m. but you will be al a disadvantage. 
Being reasonably fluent in a language other than English opens many doors. It offers you acc1iss to information in other languages: archives. news. literaturn, as well as personal contacts. These are important. no matter what field you're headed into. Being able to speak and write in a language other than English offers flexibility -not only because you will be a more valuable asset to your company, but also in terms of your own personal development. Speaking in another language allows you to think differently and approach problems with a dill'nrnnt frame of mind; Lhis lateral thinking helps keep you on your tons. 
Sneing above thn heads of fellow colleagues who have only bt1en exposed to one way of life may allow you see what they do not see and to prndict a problem bdoro it actually happens. One major setback lo American businesspnople in the modern world ol' global competition is prncisely the lack of a "larger view" -a world vinw with the ability to put oneself in the position or a German, for example. and to be able to reason as a German would. By learning a foreign language. you acquire not only the ability to communicate, but in the process of learning, you also absorb many elements of the other culture's mentality, values and ways of reasoning. This, in a world that very often seems to make no sense to mosl people, can be priceless in itself. 
If you do decide to "think diffenmtly" and dedicate the time and ener­gy tu learning another language, do not lee! discouraged if you have an accent or du not understand every word that is spoken lo you. The important thing is lo try to speak the bit you do know as clearly and correctly as possible. (Do not keep silent the entire time because you are afraid of making a mistake!) When an international guest makes an honest attempt at speaking the native language of the place she or he is visiting, it comes through as a sign of deference that will flatter even the citizens of Paris, changing the typical "haughty-Frenchman-stereotype" 180 degrees. 
But one can also venture beyond the popular Spanish and French. For example, why not dedicate your time to learning Arabic, Hussian, Portuguese or Chinese -all four of which aro among the most spoken languages in the world -while you are here at Notrn Dame'? Othnr lan­guage coursns offered al Notre Dame include Italian. Irish. German and Japanese -all of which could come in handy. Even Ancient Greek or Latin, also offered at Notni Dame, open the doors to a wealth of litera­ture and writttm history. 
If you are learning a foreign language and would like to practice it more ollen. there are many clubs on campus which gather w1rnkly or bi-weekly to chat. J\sk your professor or tho respective language department for information about clubs nearest your interests. There arn also numerous abroad opportunities for the open-minded. The cost or a immester abroad is usually the same as a semlistur at Notre Dame, but the experience is incomparable. Such an experionce will enhance tlrn f'ollowing semesters you do spend on campus in ways which you cannot imagine. allowing you to see and take udvantagn of opportuni­Lios you otherwise wouldn't have known existed. 
So if you are confronting your foreign language roquirnment as if it were a prison sentt'!lce. as a friend and colleague, I advise you lo look at it as an opportunity which you cannot afford to let go to waste. It is much more dillicult to find the time to learn a foreign language after college. If you're in doubt about how to till that undndded class, why not dedicate it to a language? You will get as much out of it as you put into it, as it is with most things in lifi.l. 
I guarantee it.

OK, so how many dil'l'Prent rncords were broken at th(~ summer b()X oflice of' 
1999? 
It is a difficult question considering every lilm pretty much broke a rncord or its own. "Star Wars Episodn l: Th(i Phantom Menac<~" has tlw largest opt:11­ing day box office gross. "J\ustin Powers 
2: The Spy Who Shagged Me" has llrn largest weekend opening of" a comedy. "Nolting !-:Iii!" bad broken the biggest Julia Hoberts opening until "Hunaway Bride" opened two months later. 
"Hig Daddy" wus the biggnst opening non-sPqual comedy, and "Tho Sixth Sense" was tlrn largest August opening in moviP history. Finally, "The Blair Witch Project" is bolicvcd to be lho most pro!Httble film in history, as its inilial $35,000 t:ost was !wavily ovtirconiP by its $120-million-and-counting box orlkti gross. · Even the box o!fo:e in gmwral brnke a record with nine dif'forenl No. l films in as many weoks, tlml streak 1•nding with this week's top tilrn, "The Sixth s,~nsc," which is in its third week us the No I 
film in Anrnrica. 
A monster beginning 
This increase in box office activity shows that Anrnricans havn an insa­tiable hunger for movies, or at !uast for moviti popcorn and soda. Following a tr:end that has lasted throughout the '<)Os, the summer movie season began a week early this year, when "The Mummy" had an enormous opening wn,iknnd with morn than $40 million. 

Coming in the footsteps ol' "Twister" and "Deep Impact," the success of "The Mummy" was especially moro impactl'ul considering that a certain lirsl episode or a certain space saga was opening shortly al'ter it. But America was ready, and it coughed up the dollars to make "The Mummy" 1999's first summer blockbuster. 
Then the_re was a little movie called "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom l\fonace." Hopelessly hyped as thn ltlrn with Lhe biggest potential in history, "l:pisodc I" canrn upon its May l lJ open­ing with so many expectations that pret­ty mud1 any outcom(i would be dis11p­pointi11g. 
This is why, i\vcn though llw lilm had a r(•curd-brnaking opening day, critics slill lambasted it for not making twic(i as much. This is why the media treated its opening weckenu" a failure, oven though it raknd in moro than $70 million. /\nd simply l"or not kicking "Titanic:'"s sunken ship out of the Lop box office spot, "lipisodP I" will most likely be ,;onsid­on:d a l'ailure in Urn wake ol' its hype. 
But the summer that was supposed lo Im all about J\nakin Skywalkcr and D,trth Maul soon bouurn1 tlrn summer of' a sf:cond helping or danger ,.. that is, Austin Powers. Yos, the world eonlinut~d to turn with 12-ycar old boys screaming ··Yeah. baby, yeah!" around the play-

Most importantly, though, was that "Austin Powers 2: The Spy Whu Shagged Mn" took most of the box olfice attention away from "Siar Wars" and refocused tlrn sumnrnr on gross-out humor and laughs, just wheni "'There's Something !\bout Mary" nndnd tlrn previous sum­me r. And s ti 11 . tlrn rn has be,rn n o t\usting Powers backlash. which means the third installnwnl of' "Austin Powers" will be just as big a blockbuster as its predecessors. 
Julia, Episode I 
To quell som11 of thti disgust that "Austin Powers" brought to audiences. particularly in thP f'orm of Fat Bastard, fortunately there was a gal named Julia to save the day. In "Notting Hill," Julia Roberts teamed with I!ugh Grant in yet another romantic conrndy f'or llrn date crowd. Holrnrts played a movie star to Grant's simple booksLorn owrnir. Though Hobcrts' role will n<\Vcr b<i considered her rurthest stretch, 0110 must rnrnem­ber audiences didn't t1xactly Pmbrace her "Mary Heilly" or "Michael Collins" roles. 
What mado "Notting llill" more than just another romantic comedy was its supporting cast of' vettiran British rnmir actors. More than anything it was their banter and comic intnrplay that rnsusci­tatod thn lilm rrom sul'l'nring a romantic heart attack. 
At least it was savt'd until Hoberts dealt the following words lu her on­screen beau: Tm just a girl, standing in front or a boy, asking him to love me." This line steorod the film into a realm of' corniness and unb1~lievability that was only exclamaled by un all too happy tinding showing llobc~rts and Grant with child, in tlw gardon when1 they lirst foll

"Lord have mercy. wou!dn'I watch that thing again," l'honix City managnr 

Tony Rasmus said af'l<)r being asktid if' we would review rnplays of his team's shutout loss to Toms Hiver. "IL would give me nightmares." 
Toms Hiver seems immune to the pressure that goes with trying to become only the third team in history to repeat as Little League champion. Monterroy, Mexico did it in 
1957  and  1958,  and  Long  
Beach, Calif.,  in  1992 and  
1993.  

After Toms Hiver beat Brow11slrnrg, lnd .. 3-1 on Tunsday, star pitclrnr and out­fiolder Eric Campesi sounded like he'd rather be planted in front of' tlrn vidtrn game machines in the players' lounge than on tlrn field. 
"I like playing with the Soalllc Mariners. I pitch with .Jamie MoyBr, and I especially 
like it because I like Ken Griffey, .Ir. lie hits those home 
runs,"  said  Campisi.  who  
along  with  Gaynor's  son,  
Casey,  are  the  only  two  

returning players from last year's team. 
"I don't know what I'll be doing during the off' day. Maybe play video games or something," catcher Chris Cunningham said. Toms Hiver had played three games in three days before Wednesday. 
"Actually, you'll be practic­ing," Gaynor quickly snapped back as Campisi laughed. 
Not far from the field where Toms Hiver practiced in front of dozens of fans, reporters and photographers, Phenix City took light batting practice with seven parents watching. 
Rasmus doesn't mind if the attention is focused on the 
"Beasts of' the East." lle's try­ing to keep his team from get­ting too distracted again by loud contingent of Toms River fans. 
"I think we got a better chance Thursday. It's got to be easier thn second time around," Rasmus said. "Any team's beatable." 
Phenix City. which is an average height of 5-foot-3, is one or the smallest teams in the eight-t,iam field but has packed quite a punch with six home runs in the two games since Toms Hiver. 
Is Phenix City looking to a~~nge it~ l~st l?ss? , . Yes, sir, said Hasmus 12­year-old son, Colby, gave up six runs and eight hits over six innings against Toms Hiver Sunday. 'Tm going to pitch my best against them."

"I just want to enjoy my sec­ond year at Texas," he said. "I just love the enthusiasm here with the football game Saturday. There's just so many positive people here at Texas." 
Gossett won the U.S. Amateur last week with a dominating 9­and-8 final round victory over Korean high school junior Sung Yoon Kim. 
He now has goals or winning the NCAA team and individual titles. I-le also wants to see how he'll play in threfi professional majors next season. 
As the U.S. Amateur champi­on, Gossetl can play in the Masters, U.S. Open and BritishOpen next year if he remains an amateur.

NFL 

Vikings QB returns to former hometown 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS 
Randall Cunningham faces 
his original  team  for  the  
first time tonight.  
And  he's doing it  as  the  

starter for Minnesota after leaving Philadelphia in 1995 as Hodn,~y Peete's backup. 
Cunningham, who spent 11 seasons with the Eagles, sat out in 1996 and returned to tho NFL as Brad Johnson's backup a year later. When Johnson got hurt last year, Cunningham produced his best season evr.r. guiding the Vikings to the NFC championship. 
"Smart and rnaturu, that's my approach as thP starter," Cunningham said. "I don't overwork myself' because I'm ]6 years old ·• 
Cunningham may be thti starter, but backup Jdf Georgo is turning heads at Winter Park. In two exhibi­tion games. he has complet­ed 15-of-16 passes for thnrn touchdowns and no inter­ceptions, running tlrn offense to near perfection. 
Gnorgo's passer rating is 
157.3 -the higlwst possible rating is 158.3. 
But lrnlh men insist thern's noll() of tho animosi­ty that's usually present betwe1rn an incum­bent quarterback and his ambitious backup. 
"He should be starting somewhere in the NFL," Cunningham said. 
Yet, Cunningham will do his best to sec that doesn't happen in Minnesota. 
Cunningham was 11-of-12 for 124 yards against Cleveland last week after a sputtnring start against tho New York Giants. 
He· II play most of' the first half against the Eagles, who seem just as excited about the reunion as Cunningham. 
''Handal! can still move around back there and make things happen," Eagles eornerback Troy Vinctrnt said. "He's still very much of' a threat and he has some great weapons to work with. Tho Vikings am going to look to light up the score­bo a rd. Thny have great receivers, a great running garnn and a big offensive li1w. Wo have to play well." 
l'hiladPlphia cornerback Al Ilarris said he's eager to test Cunningham and his tall trio of targets: Cris Carter, Handy Moss and Jake Heed. 
''I'm looking forward to playing against them. They havo size and can really go up and gnt llrn ball," llarris said. "Tlwy like to be physi­cal, which is the way I likP to play." 
NPw Eag!Ps coach Andy Hnid. whosP team lost 10-7 to 13altimorn and I0-9 to tlw New York Jnts. agnrns. 
"I like playing a team lik11 llrn Vi kin gs." Re id said. "They're a team that you like to rnoasure yourself against. That's l'inn with me. 

"!low about that? In front of,•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 
the world," Gossett said. "I just called il a bogey and laughed at it. Ob well, nice problem." 
Ttixas golf coach John Fields likus the fact his star player is sticking around. 
"I !e's got a lot of opportunities that he's going to have to look at over the course of' the next few years. I know sitting here at the University of' Texas, 1 sure wouldn't want him anvwhere 
el~~:~g~~~ •;ifi,.~f~;1~:i~fi~onth in the Walker Cup in Scotland against amateurs from Great Britain and Ireland. 
J\nd then it's back to the buoks instead of the potential big money on the pro tours. "It's another year to mature and another yoar to work on my goll' game,'' Gossntt said. .. It's also anotlrnr year of edu­cation and maybe a better vocabulary when I answer these questions."

ATLANTA 
The Cincinnati Heds came to Atlanta as one of the NL's hottest teams. They aren't anymore. 
Andruw Jones hit a three­run homer and Tum Glavine pitched seven strong innings as the Braves continued to dominate the Hcds, compet­ing a three-game sweep with a 5-2 victory W<'dtrnsday. 
Atlanta has a staggering 22-4 record against Cincinnati over the last three seasons. including six straight virtoril's this year. Overall, the BraYes have won seven in a row -their longest strnak of the s~1ason. 
The surprising Heels had won nin(-1 straight series before they arrived ut Turner Field.

After Cameron ·s homer, 

the Braves wasted no time erasing their deficit against former teammate Denny Neagle (3-5). Gerald Williams led off the bottom of the first with a double and Brei Boone reached on an infield single. 
Neagle had a chance to get out of the inning when he retired the Bravps' two most dangeroushittcrs. Chipper Jones pupplld lo shortstop and Brian Jordan grounded out. f'orcing Williams to hold at third. 
But Andruw J01111s f'ollowed ·with a towering drive that hit the top of thn left-field wall and bounced over for his 24th homer. Outl'ielder Grng Vaughn had tinrn to drift slowly back to the wall and make a leap for the ball, but 
it landed just beyond  his  
glove.  
After  tlrn  Heds  cut  the  

deficit to 3-2 on Dmitri Young's sacril'ico l'ly in the sixth. the Braves added two more run:-; in their half' to knock out Neagle. Andruw Jones doubled, Jose Hernandez hit a sacrifice fly and Eddie Perez capped the inning with an RBI single. 
Neagle surrendered five hits and all five runs in 5 1-3 innings. 
IIe retired 12 oI' 13 hitters in between the Braves' scor­ing frames. 
Tim Braves. who have baseball's best record (80­
