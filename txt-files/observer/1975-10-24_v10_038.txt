warld briefs 

MORRISTOWN, N.J. <AP)-A neurologist who specializes in the 
treatment of coma victims said Thursday that Karen Anne 
Quinlan's physical condition was too grotesque to describe, but said 
no physician has the right to take steps that could end her life. 
The testimony was by Dr. Sidney Diamond, one of three 
neurologists presented by attorneys opposing a request by Miss 
Wuinlan's adoptive parents that doctors be ordered to disconnect a 
respirator to "let her die with dignity." 
MADRID, Spain (AP)-Gen. Francisco Franco is showing signs of 
heart failure, his doctors said Thursday night. 
"The chief of state has suffered a relapse and incipient heart 
failure has appeared," a statement from 11 attending doctors said. 
The medical bulletin, the first since the 82-year-old chief of state 
suffered a severe heart attack two days ago, opened the way under 
the Spanish constitution for Franco to be declared incapable of 
continuing as Spanish ruler. 
There were reports that his government was making efforts to 
transfer power to Prince Juan Carlos de Borbon. 
ANDERSON, INDIANA <AP) A human skeleton, thought to be 
that of an Indian and several hundred years old, has been found 
near here by three youths playing in a gravel pit. 
Mrs. Wayne Gillespie said her son, GRoger, and twoof his sixth­
grade friends were tossing rocks into a pond on his grandfather's 
farm when they discovered sometning sitcking out of the ground. 
The boys started digging and found the skeleton of a man in the 
seated position with his hands clasped behind his head. . . . 
A sim iliar skeleton was found near here in 1963 and scientists said 
it was between 150 and 400 years old.

Spirit strong at Southern Cal.   
by Mary Reher 
Senior Staff Reporter 
"The Notre Dame-Southern California football game has become the fabled game of the year in Los Angeles," according to Kevin McKenna, editor of the 
Trojan Daily. 
"Students here are usually blase and take things for granted since we have a good team," he continued. "Even though this is definitely a big football school, there is not always a lot of spirit. But the Notre Dame game is an exception," he said. 
Cheerleader Jennifer Booty cit­eo such campus events for the game last year as a nightly pep rally the week preceding the game <some impromptu), posters hung all over campus and spontaneous parties, especially after the game. 
Although Southern Cal spirit was strong last year, McKenna noted that Trojan support in Los Angeles is not as overwhelming as the Notre Dame support South Bend. 
"When Notre Dame comes to California it already has a good deal of backing since about one-t­hird of the people in the area are Irish fans. It is completely dif­ferent when the Trojans plav in South Bend, though, because few Midwesterners support Southern Cal," he said. 

People still discuss the NDgame from last year, McKenna ob­served. 
The SouthernCalbookstore stills sells a clock whose face is a picture . of _the final score of last year's Trojan victory, he said. 
"The University-President framed the cover from the Sports Illustrated issue following the game," he stated. "It is a picture of Anthony Davis running down the field. In the lower right hand corner is a picture of the ND

Government role in energy 
Speakers spark debate 
by Phil Cackley Staff Reporter 
Two speakers with diametrically opposed views on the economics of the energy crisis concluded the third and final session of the Energy Conference last night in the Library Auditorium. 
The speakers on last night's program were Charles1 Wolfe, president of the American Economic Foundation, on a "Free Enterprise Approach to Problem Solving", and David Morris, co­director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, on "Systematic Approach to Problem Solving." 
The presentation was the con­cluding session in a three day Energy Conference sponsored by the Student Union Academic Commission. It was attented by an audience of about 50 people. 
Free enterprise works 
Wolfe began the program by giving a brief history of agriculture and food economy in 

America. He ~inted to the high , government intervention in the 
level of pr.oductton a!ld the fact t­hat the Umted States IS the number one food producer in the world 
today. , 
"I think this is the fruit of free enterprise at work," he said, asserting that America's position is not due solely to "a good piece of land." 
It would be logical, according to Wolfe, that other nations in the world would also use free ent­erprise, because it works so well. But this is not the case, he said. 
He outlined several examples of nations that have gone over to government controlled economies, particularly in agriculture. He specifically referred to Argentina and Russia, saying that in both countries agriculture has failed 
and those nations are now relying on imports from the rest of the
world, especially America. 

Wolfe claimed that just as free enterprise worked in an agricult­ural economy, it would work in . other types of economic systems, and in other types of problems-solving as well. 
He applied this claim to the energy crisis, stating that 
government "violations of free enterprisehast.adalottodowith
causing the energy crisis." "I believe we can solve this crisis if government will get out of the energy business," he stated. 
The government planted the seeds of the energy crisis in the
1930's, Wolfe stated, when price

This slowed down production, causing a domino effect with other forms of energy, particularly 
coal. He stressed that price controls do not work, saying this restriction 
and others, such as enviromental regulations, brought first a shortage of oil in this country, and then forced oil companies to develop oil resouces in foreign nations, including the Middle East. This in turn set up the conditions for the recent Arab oil embargo. 
Wolfe listed a number of pieces of federal legislation which he felt interferred and hindered the free market operation in the energy field. They included the Mine Health and Safety Air Act, the National Enviromental Policy Act <NEPA>, the Clean Air Act, and th­e Surface Mining Act. All of these laws either delayed energy projects like the Alaskan oil pipeline, or limited the efficiency of industry, such as in the coal industry, according to Wolfe. 
"Even the best intentioned 
free market is like throwing a monkey-wrench into the system " he stated. ' 
Wolfe called for a 'massive program of deregulation and decontrolling of the energy indust­ry" as the only method of solving the energy crisis. 
Mc,rris, who spoke next, said that although he disagreed with Wolfe's basic philosophy, he did agree with some of the statements made by Wolfe. 
Morris felt that government int­ervention was the cause of many of America's problems, both in the economy and the energy situation. But he felt that it was government intervention on the side of the big business that was doingh this. 
He stated that a market system of economy was good but that the 
United States has not oper&ted on one for the past several decades. This was due to the 
creation of big business by government actions. Morris felt t­hat it might be too late for the government to intervene "on the right side--because they don't 
know how to." 
Endofanera 
It is impossible to view the energy crisis piecemeal, according to Morris. Other matters such as 
the raw material crisis must also be considered.
"This nation has been on a 100 e~ergy s~urce ~hat.~s ~~mmng to g1ve out, he sa1d. Th1s IS the end of an era." 

Morris stated that in the relat­ively near future the United States was going to experience economic 
and governmental changes, an altered rate of consumption of products, and a change in the American way of life. 
Reasons for these changes were listed by Morris as being: 1) the limited supply of fossil fuels, on which our economy and way of life is based; 2Hhe fact that what remaining fuel reserves are dif­ficult to obtain; and 3) the en­viromental effects of continuing the current type of destructive technology being used. 
"No longer are we getting a free lunch. There are difficult decisions to be made on the trade­offs involved," he stated. He said he doesn't want those decisions being ·made by a few oil company executives, but would rather have an informed public acting as decision-maker.

The Story Of College Football's Greatest Coach As told By The Men Who Played For Him by John D. McCallum and Paul Castner 
WE REMEMBER ROCKNE is far more than a book only for sports fans. It is for everyone who believes in per­fection and the struggle to reach that goal. Knute Rockne was many men; a fascinating mix of vigorous activity and talents. He was a no-nonsense man with the highest of standards; making every minute of every hour count. 
Rockne has been dead for nearly 45 years, and there have been many books in the past ... so why another book? To share his spirit, ideals, determination and unfor­gettable personality with younger generations not lucky enough to personally witness this legend. And to rekindle the neglec'ted feelings of pride and accomplishment en­joyed from ajob well done. 
No other book has been able to capture the intimacy of his spirit quite like WE REMEMBER ROCKNE. And none will ever again be able to relate the behind-the-scene stories and emotion as have the 11 Men of Rockne." 
This is THE book about the man, his philosophy, prin­ciples and the game he loved. And it's told by the men who knew him best. Get to know him well!!! And make sure your children and grandchildren get to know him; men like Rockne are hard to find! 296 pages, clothbound

In the report, Cockrell, the Ombudsman director, stated, "T­he Ombudsman Service strongly believes that constructive change is easily attainable at Notre Dame. 
Our experience <with the LaFortune renovation) indicates t­hat if presented with reasonable, well-thought-out plans, the University is very receptive to our requests." 
The renovation was completed this year at a cost of $203,000. This figure is below the $250,000 allocat­ed by the Executive Board of T­rustees in March, 1974 for the 
purpose. Includ~d in the improvements were the remodeling of thfirstfloor

mostly by University students. Canavan emphasized that the project is only in te planning stage until th£ University decides whether or not to allowtlu village to be built on or very near the 
campus. 
When asked why· Notre Dame was considered for the ex­perinH'ntal site, Canavan pointed out the temperate climate and a major university atmosphere. "We have students and scholars her-e in different fields who could be vital to the developemt of the 
program," he said. 

Working with Canavan and Sondej on the proposal are Frank Pokego handling the financial matters, Joe Braun serving as a liaison with the Engineering Department, and Hank Miller as 
publications manager. 

Sondej examined the three goals his Hunger Coalition is striving for in this village project. "The ex­perimental village would be an educational model for the Notre Dame community on ways to lower one's standard of living," he said. 
He sees the proposer{ communi also as a stimulant to the Notre Dame intellectual community , noting that there would be ample opportunity for researching man's basic problems through analysis 
and evaluation of te project. 

"Finally, it could provide an opportunity for members of the Notre Dame community to put intc practice their religious and humanitarian convictons," he concluded.

Collective bargaining discussed for faculty 
,.
I 


by Kathy Byrne Staff Reporter 
The first of a series of lectures on collective bargaining for the Notre Dame faculty was held Thursday night at the University Club. 
Frederick Hueppe, associate professor of modern languages at St. John's University, Jamaica, New York, explained how the program was organized there. 
He termed collective bargaining 
a "creative contract procedure to 
protect the academic and 
financial interests of the faculty." 
Hueppe has been a member of 
the American Association of 
University Professors, the national 
caucus on collective bargaining 
since 1969, when St. John's 
organized their charter. 
He noted that faculty-senates usually have no legal basis at the bargaining table, and are often totally ignored by administration members. 
Some of the faculty gains at St. John's since collective bargaining has gone into effect have been faculty selection of academic deans; clear cut grievance procedures and a ccess to personal files. 
According to Hueppe the program at St. John's has brought faculty and administration closer together. This statement drew laughs from the large audience, which included faculty and ad­ministration from Notre Dame, St.

Also, John A. Schneider was identified as a 1931 graduate of Notre Dame. Schneider graduated with the class of 1948.

Charles Kellenberg, law professor, questioned faculty salary increases in view of world hunger and poverty. 
"We're not out for the jugular vein, it was a justified raise , backed up with ample statistics," Hueppe replied. He noted that the greatest increases went to librarians. 
·The audience did not seem overly favorable to the prospect of collective bargaining at Notre Dame. Many agreed that the faculty manual was a strong foundation for their complaints, and were wary of the time con­suming responsibiJities of faculty_ representatives to the AAUP.

The St. John's charter is based on two National Labor Relations Acts, which Hueppe termed "the cornerstones of our statement." 
Included in the charter are freedom of tenure; equal faculty voice in determining campus priorities, and prime responsibility in the area of student affairs..... 
The contract rules legally bind the board of trustees to consult with the faculty on any major policy changes. 
Financially, the faculty at St. John's has made definite progress. 
Salaries and benefits have in­creased by about 10 per cent each 
year since the programs im­plementation. Benefits include medical and life insurance, and complete tuition waivers for faculty children. 
Comparing Notre Dame to St. John's, Hueppe said that St. John's fiscal policy is more conservative than Notre Dame's. He noted that they refuse 31 2 million dolJars in state funds each year. This is done to stress the school's in­dependence. Federal grants are accepted, however. 
Several faculty members raised objections to collective bargaining at Notre Dame. They cited the faculty manual as taking the place of a labor contract. Many ex­pressed fears of legal interventions 
squelching faculty initiative. 
Hueppe replied that "The legal staff of the AAUP is brilliant," but conceded that St. John's ad­ministration is more passive than most, and tends to avoid con­troversy."

Comeback Trail 
liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~--art buchw aId 
WASHINGTON--The New Nixon was sitting on the J)Orch of La Casa Pacifica at San Clemente slumped in his chair staring out at the sea. The Old Nixon carrying a golf bag came out jauntily whistling "Hail to the Chief." 
"Where are you going?" the New Nixon asked bitterly. "I'm going to play golf with the Teamsters at La Costa," the Old Nixon said. "What a day." "How can you play golf after what we've been through?" the New Nixon asked. 
"Cheer up, Dicky boy," the Old Nixon said. "We're on the comeback trail. Look at this. We're on the cover of Newsweek magazine. Did you ever dream we'd ever make the cover of 
Newsweek again," . The New Nixon shook his head. "I don't get it. You never give up, do you?" 
The Old Nixon said, "You're damn right I never give up. They had me counted out after the presidential election in 1960. They said I couldn't get elected dogcatcher after I lost for governor in 
1962. But I fooled them, Dicky, and I'm going to fool them again. They haven't heard the last of Richard Milhaus Nixon.'' ''I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes," the New Nixon said.. 
"Wait until our book comes out," the Old Nixon said. "Just wait until they hear out side of the story. There will be more than Teamsters wanting to play golf with me then." 
"Richard," said the New Nixon, "do you really think we can make a comeback? Or are you just saying that to make me feel better?" 
"It's in the cards, Dicky. After my interviews with David Frost, the American people are going to see that all we were trying to do was protect the Presidency of the United States. Oh, there will be some who will say we lied and we cheated and we brought disgrace on the office. But we won't hate them for saying that." 
"We won't?" the New Nixon said. /'No," replied the Old Nixon, "but we'll keep their names on file .Cards and someday when we're back in power they're going to be (?orry they ever made an issue of Watergate." "What are we going to say about Watergate in our book?" 
"It was a mistake, and we should have taken more of an interest in what our staff was doing. They let us down. But we're not going· to blame them. We're taking full responsibility for their actions, no matter how contemptible they were and no matter how much we disapproved of the illegal manner in which they carried out our orders. As President it was our job to see that they did not violate the trust we had given them, in spite of all the other things we had on our mind during that momentous period in American History." 
"I think Peoria will buy it," the New Nixon said. 
"It will just be a matter of time. Dicky, before we're on top again," the Old Nixon said. "We'll take a trip to China, then to the Soviet Union and then to the Middle East. They love us over there, not like the creeps in this country who always had it in for 
us." The New Nixon was suddenly coming out of his lethargy. "You know, You might just possibly swing it," he said. "Six months ago I wouldn't have given 18 1h minutes of tape for our chances of making a comeback. But now with the book and the TV and the Teamsters I'm starting to feel like a new man." The Old Nixon slapped him on the back. "Atta boy, Dicky. Don't forget what they tried to do to Patton." "Richard," the New Nixon said, "do you think they'll invite us to the Republican National Convention?" "Invite us?" chuckled the Old Nixon. "Would you believe the keynote speaker?"

Letters to a Lonely God 
the sunshine ministr~ 
reverend robert griffin 


One of the really embarrassing ad­vantages of being the University Chaplain, with lots of spare time on one's hands to be used for the development of a really creative ministry, is that one is free, on warm, autumn afternoons, to sit on the low. gray polished wall outside the en­trance to the Memorial Library, and greet all the busy people who hurry by. Sitting there in the sunshine on my tuffet of stone, I eye the harried administrators, teachers, graduate students, and un­dergraduate liberal arts majors; and they eye me, and each of us envies the other. I wish I could be as obviously important as they are; they wish they could be as in­dolent as I seem to be. Their lives are controlled by a schedule of events, classes, and meetings. Government grants and contracts to the University are contingent on their efficiency and industry. The economy and politics of Third World countries depend on the studies they are making, the papers and books they are writing. Emerging countries look to them for leadership; Southeast Asians by the millions will perish, if they neglect to be energetic, and Europe will fall to the Communists. Truth itself will fail; beauty will falter; and culture will be trivialized, if their scholarship grows slack. The dialogue of civilized men will become as insipid as the chatter of television talk shows presided over by Joey Bishop. 
We are dealing here, of course, with the fantasy of an insecure cleric turned into sun lizard by th October afternoon. lm­portant work is being done by the people of Notre Dame, but nobody is claiming to be Messiah. It is not the students' fault nor faculty's fault if, in a world of brief cases and attaches cases, where the merest freshman goes around with a computer st­rappedtohis hip, there is a chaplain who feels as classy as a brown paper bag emptied of lunch. If I sit on a gray stone wall with mv back to a building which 
  e    j 
 
houses the wisdom of a million books, 
neither the faculty nor the students tell me 
my time seems wasted; they may not even 
feel that my time is wasted. After all, I did 
read a book once; they must know that; 
and I've walked through the library. I 
must have walked through that buidling 
two or three times. It's not their fault that 
I'm not compelled to attend meeting af­
ter meeting, held back to back, hour after 
hour, as they are. I've attended meetings 
oefore; and I still do, once in a while. I 
even used to attend meetings in the Main 
Building. 

If you don't have to attend meetins, how do you know if you're important, or not? That's what I ask myself. Few meetings, to attend; no computer on my hip; no brief case, or attache case to carry; no im­portant papers to put in a brief case, if I had one. I do have appointments. I write those appointments down in a little book with covers fhat seem almost like leather. I write down appointments and oc­casionally I keep those appointments. If it's warm. I sit outsde the library, talking to people who sometimes make ap­pointments. That's my life; and if oc­casionally I weep for a hectic schedule and a brief case full of secrets, whose fault is it? Nobody's; that's who's. It is cert­ainly not the fault of the scholars who are constantly riding th backs of hurricanes. I must know that I'm better off than those hustling pundits, because it is they who say to me: "What do I have to do to get a job 
lik.e vours?. ,
" 

"Put on weight," I'm tempted to say. "Lose your hair. Have trouble with your teeth. Become a sentimentalist. Let them say of you that you don't suit the image. Become a sentimentalist. Walk around with rumpled clothes in the company of a disreputable little dog. Then maybe someone will imagine that you are a pastoral figure, and give you the chance to prove it." If these words seem whining, they are not intended to be. It's only that sometimes I get scared of being inadequate at a job whose basic duty is to tell busy and gifted people that they are loved. 
I do think that wall-watching can be defended as a pastoral appraoch. If all the ministries had to be excercised in clean, well-lighted places at thee o'clock\in 
the morning, then the apostolate would most literally be an errand done in the darkness. Out of all the lost sheep of the 
House of Israel, I can remember only Nicodemus as the Gospel figure who came to Jesus by night. Most of the rest of his ministry took place out of doors, exceptfor the places where .He dined. He never seemed to use an office. Mountaintops and lakesides satisfied Him with their gran­deur, or fields where the corn was ripening, or meadows where the lilies were more radiant that the robes of Solomon. What need is there to catalogue the ob­vious? I would enjoy a ministry to seafarers, I could walk on the waves to work; but the Lord seems to keep most of the lake-rescues for Himself. I mention these things because there is an opinion that desks are required before one can properly be busy. That is like saying that grottos are needed before prayers can be answered, or that marriage can be con­sumated only in bed. 
, It may be objected, shouldn't preacher-types be peripatetic rather than wall­flowers? Weren't Francis of Assisi and St. Dominic wandering friars who might have built a waH, or leapt over a wall, but who would scorn to be lazy creatures who sat on a wall like Humpty-Dumpty? And we all know what happened to him. Obviously, there is a ministry of walking; I've even done it myelf. People who practice the ministry of walking are seldom caught at being ministers, because nobody knows what they are up to. A priest in mufti who walks is indistinguishable from a minor

The movies this week include Sounder and The French Connection. Sounder, starring Cicely Tyson and Paul Winfield, was an important film in 1972, critically praised and well-attended while touring the national theaters then. It focuses in­tensely on the trials of a black family during the Depression, a small circle of sharecroppers in Lousiana who endure separation, depression and the poverty of economic plight. It is an excellent drama and an admirable piece of direction on the 
~rt of Martin Ritl (Con~~), but the film's greatest difficulty is that it boarders on triteness and melodrama. Still, in comparison to the other black films Hollywood has given us, this is one of the contemporary classics, a black phoenix of 
cinema.  Tonight at 7 on 28.  
The  French  Connection,  that  over­ 
praised thriller of 1971 which  was  more  

like an excellent late-late show than the film of profound greatness which the Oscars had made it, will be televised Thursday at 7 on Channel 22. The strength of the movie is its truth-based script and an entertaining performance by Gene Hackman .<who was unfortunately awarded an Oscar for it). The film was voted the "Best" of its year by the Academicians <who must have been out to lunch for the voting), but regardless of that, it is at least exciting entertainment, and interesting because of its factual foundation. The plot is. based on New York's "Popeye" Doyle's investigation of heroine-smuggling attempt involving a multimillion dollar shipment of the inner­city drug. The most celebrated scene from the entire film is <typically, in the Bullitt tradition of money-making cinema ex­citement) the chase scene. Granted, it is a scene of gripping suspence, but must they <the Producers) also succeed in mutilating a beautiful bronze Pontiac? As a student, I have lost quite a bit of sleep over that scene and over that Pontiac.

The 18th-century classic about a young man's odyssey through the Inquisition, war and other oblique atrocities will be uniquely produced, using occasional animation and other special effects. To be shown Thursday opposite French Connection (at nine o'clock) on channel 34. Candide is portrayed by Ian Oglivy. The special of the week will be a re-run of the Missiles of October, a dynamic and edifying representation of the Cuban Missile Crisis of the New Frontier Ad­ministration. The three-hour dramatization is the work of Stanley Greenberg (of "Pueblo" success) and stars William Devane, Martin Sheen and Howard da Silva. It is strongly recom­mended. To follow French Connection. Bob Hope has a special on this week <again--it seems he always does). This one, however, is an anniversary show wrapping together, for nostalgia buffs, 25 years of vintage scenes from previously televised comedy shows.

them becomes a fixed point; that way, eventually, one of them might dance into the other's sight. As with stars, so with shepherds. Shepherds, at times, need to become fixed points, too. For the sake of the sheep, they need to walk through the vaJJey of the shadow of death. That is the Jesson of the Psalms and the tent chapter of John. But if they would tame the fox

assigned hours in the afternoon when they 
must remain almost perfectly still that is 
the lesson of Saint-Exupery. There are two places in the world where 
I have made my home: one is in New York, where the stoop-sitters are the best known and best entertained folks in the 
neighborhood. All street ministry in New York begins with stoop-sitting in places where you can see and be seen. The other place where I have lived is New England, in both Massachusetts and Maine, where I was born and raised. 
Up in Maine, we know the proper uses of a wall. I'm not sure if Henry David Thoreau would have known anything else to do with a wall but sit on it. Ifhe sat on it, that wall would become his instant Walden, where he could see the bees at work and the woodchucks at play, and he could become acquainted with a family of chickadees. At Notre Dame, we have no woodchucks that I know of, and only a very few bees, and the chikadees, if they come here, raise their families on the other side of the Jake. But there is a beauty of trees and grass and shrubs; they bear watching, until all our;-mood is reverence. And there are people here: girls who write poems and young men who tell stories. There are couples who whisper of babies to be born in their marriage, and there are children who wait for their fathers. There is the young theologian with a book to be read, and the middle-aged philosopher with a book to be written. There is the young man of twenty who says he will be married in the spring, and there are nuns and faculty widows. There are the com­mitteed Christians and the alienated Catholics. There are the saved, the lost, 
the despairing, the sweetly idiotic. There are the saints and the scholars, the humble ones and the great ones, there are the leaders and the followers. 
All of them come, sauntering or running, in weariness or rushed importance, by the 
walks leading to the library. They greet you with a nod, a wink, a grunt, a greeting, or a conversation; a few of them ignore you all together. 
For achaplain,~his is the world that has been given him instead of classrooms, libraries, computers, term papers, or research grants. They may not know they are his world; they may not Wi;lnt to be his world. They may resist allowing them­'selves to , be any part of his world. 
But' he comes there to that low, gray wall outside the Memorial Library. He comes to watch over those he might not otherwise see. For all his apparent indolence, he is really doing something, or at least he thinks he is. His work is not the student's work, nor the -teacher's work, nor the ad­ministrator's work, although it invovles elements'of all these kinds of dedication. Sometimes it just seems to be a kind of waiting. Sometimes waiting, or its ap­pearances, can be the most embarrassing work of all the chores that Universitv people are called to do. 

SMC auction raises $400 
by {'hris Hopkins Starr Reporter 

St. Mary's students bought $400 worth of goods in the continuance of the United Way auction Wed­nesday night in the cafeteria. 
Co-directorsCathyCoyne and Dr. Miller of the Psychology Depart­ment decided to continue T­uesday's auction because of its success and the remaining amount of donated goods. Tuesday's auction raised $400. 
"Faculty advisor Dr. Miller and Dr. Balka . of the Mathematics Department performed the auc­tioneering duties. They did a commendable job which showed in the students' generous response," said Coyne. 
Some of the more interesting items of Wednesday's auction included an authentic antique beeer keg from the 100 Center bought for $17, a personal dinner for six served by the Saga management for $17, a Kodak camera for $16, and Dr. Bam­banek's donation to paint a resident's room in her favorite color for $23. 
The St. Mary's community helped the United Way campaign by surpassing the $5,500 goal by at least $100, stated Coyne. The final ' J figures are not in yet, but the followed up. "Other students" he said, "will have to continue the 
momentum., not only now but in future years." 
"It was very good report," said Dr. Philip J. Faccenda, University counsel. ''This. is the first time in my memory that students have followed up a report with a follow­up report. That's the way to get things done in any field,'' he commented. 
"The study of student life is dynamic," Faccenda noted. "One of three things can happen to any given proposal; it can be satisfied immediately, it can be satisfied in long-range terms, or it can be dropped as student interests

John J. Rockefeller IV, former president of West Virginia Wesleyan College, found it "in­teresting that there was not total agreement over the future cour­se."

Rejects Ford's proposal 
House panel votes $10.7 billion tax cut 
Ry CARL C. CRAFT Associated Press Writer 
WASHINGTON <AP) -The House Ways and Means Com­mittee on Thursday approved its chairman's $12.7-billion plan for extending 1975 personal tax cuts into 1976. But it rejected attempts by President Ford's backers to require budget cuts to accompany new tax reduc­
tions.  
The  committee,  by  a  21-16  
vote,  accepted  a  plan  which  
would  amount  to  an  additional  

$2.6-billion tax cut next year compared with the 1975 Tax Reduction Act. The plan would permanently keep some parts of that law, restructure and continue others just for 1976, and discard some features of that law when they die Dec. 31. 
But first it rejected some parliamentary efforts to link the continuation of tax reduc­tions to congressonal action set­ting a federal spending ceiling for the next fiscal year. 
President Ford has said re­
peatedly  he  will  veto  any  tax­ 
reduction bi ll  that does  not  con­ 
tain such  a  ceiling.  

The proposal, by chairman AI Ullman, 0-0re., was accepted as part of the wide-ranging tax bill which the committee is pre­paring for presentation to the full House next month. 
In addition to the $12.7 billion in individual income tax cuts, Ullman has suggested another $2.3-billion reduction in taxes paid by businesses. 
After approving Ullman's in­dividual tax proposal, the com­mittee discussed but did not vote on changes in business taxes. It is to resume work next week. 
All 12 Republicans and 4 Democrats joined in opposing Ullman's proposal. The four Democrats included the com­mittee's former chairman, Rep. Wilbur D. Mills, D-Ark. The other three were Reps. Omar Burleson, D-Tex.; Joe D. Wag­goner Jr., D-La.; and Andrew Jacobs Jr., D-Ind. 
The Ullman proposal would extend and make permanent the 1975 Tax Reduction Act's special $30 across-the-board tax credit for every taxpayer or de­pendent for whom a taxpayer claims the current $750 person­al exemptions. 
That $30 credit would be re-

Caroline escapes bomb attack 
LONDON <AP) -A "very shaken" Caroline Kennedy nar­rowly escaped injury and pos­sible death Thursday when a bomb believed set by Irish ter­rorists exploded outside the townhouse of a crusading anti­tenorist member of Parliament with whom she was staying. A ehance telephone call saved her. 
But the bomb, planted under the car of Conservative Hugh Fraser. a longtime friend of the 
_ Kl'tmedy family, killed a promi­nent Bt·i tish cancer specialist who Jived next door. He was walking his poodle in the quiet, tree-lined Campden Hill Square in the fashionable Kensington district. Seven other persons, in­cluding a Filipino woman who worked as cook and housemaid for the Fraser family, suffered slight injuries. Fraser, 57, was thrown out of a chair by the blast and his forehead was slightly cut by flying glass. He said the 17­year-old Miss Kennedy, daugh­ter of the late President John 
F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Onassis, was in her bedroom when the bomb went off at 8:53 
a.m. and hurled jagged chunks of his white Jaguar severaL hundred yards in all directions.

He said Miss Kennedy had just finished breakfast and that he was going to drive her to Sotheby's, a London auctioneer of fine arts where she is en­rolled in an 11-month art course. 
He said a telephone call from a fellow parliamentarian de­layed their departure and kept them inside at the time of the blast, which shattered the win­dows of the four-story tow-of $30 apiece for the taxpayer and dependents in the family.

Notre Da:me-usc 
1975 
Tom Kruczek 

Notre Dameand Southern California may not be the oldest of college football's rivalries, but few can boast of the number of classic games that have evolved from that series. Names like Anthony Davis, O.J. Simpson and Pat Hayden from the Trojans spring to mind as stars from these games, while for the Irish Eric. Penick, Joe Theismann and John Huarte are just three of the many heroes from days gone by. 
In the overall series, the Irish hold a slight advantage over USC that has been cut noticeably in the last eight years. Notre Dame has won 26 while losing 16 with four ties. In the last eight years, the Trojans hold ilie edge, winning five times to just once for the Irish, with ties in 1968 and 1969. 
The first game of the series was in 1926 with Knute Rockne as head coach for Notre Dame. The Scholastic at the start of the season stated a fact that since then has been mentioned time and again; that the winner of the game would probably be the national champion. 
The Irish dream became sidetracked the week previous to the first USC encounter by virtue of a 19-Q loss to Carnegie, but that didn't diminish Notre Dame's first trip to the coast. Behind the passing of Arty Parisien, the Irish won 13-12 and ruined the Trojans bid for a national title. 
Skipping ahead to 1930, this contest has often been called Rockne's greatest personal triumph. It was also to be his last. Rockne died in a plane crash on March 31, 1931 with seven other persons over Kansas, but he left in his wake something that was never accomplished before in Notre Dame history. the winning of three national championships in the same decade. 
Notre Dame crushed the Trojans 27-0, outgained them 356 to 94 yards 
and Rockne, the master psychologist outcoached USC. AI Silverman in 
the book The Glor)' of Notre Dame recounts how the Rock did it. 
"The team was scheduled to stay overnight in Tuscon, Arizona and hold 
a practice session the next morning at 9:30. Rockne told his players he 
had left orders to have them called at 8 a.m. When the squad had . retired for the night, he slipped downstairs, and ordered the desk clerk to cancel all calls to Notre Dame players next morning. Silverman continues to explain how when the team finally began to trickle in to the field at 9:30a.m., only Rockne and Hunk Anderson, his assi~ant, were on the fieW. Rockne then t~d ilie ~am iliat he was
tllaking the trip against physicians orders, but he did that because he 
"wanted to make this trip and win this game in Los Angeles. From your 
attitude," he continued, "I'm the only man who really cares about k­
nocking those Trojans up into those nickle seats." With that Rockne left 
the practice. 
Rockne didn't leave Tuscon and head back to South Bend however. Onstead he found a high, isolated spot above the field and watched the most spirited workout of the season. Later the team pleaded with Rockne to stay for the game, which he did, leading them to Notre Dame's fourth win against one defeat in the series, and a second consecutive national 
championship.
The legend of Rockne may have been over, but in 1941 the second legend came to Notre Dame in the form of FrankLeahy· Leahy's record against USC was aremarkable7 wins, one loss and one tie. What was possibly his greatest contest against theTrojans came in 1948 when, with 35 seconds to play in the game Emil Sitko scored and Steve Oracko kicked· the point after to give the Irish a 14-14 tie and preserve a third straight undefeated season, with another unblemished record coming in 1949. That year NO went 10-o with a 32-0 bounding of USC for a national 
championship.The legend of Leahy ended in 1953 after a final 48-14 win over the boys from California· In 1964 on November 2, Sports Illustrated featured a cover stroy en­titled "Notre Dame Returns to Power" with a new legend emerging--Ara Parseghian. Four weeks later, Notre Dame's dreams of a national title, 
the first since 1949, would be ended abruptly by Rod Serman. That sameweekly magazine would then title a story 'A catch-and Crash Goes Notre Dame' as the hex of SI continued. 
Wl.th fourth,down on the NotreDamel5 and 1:43 to play in the game, the 
USC quarterback Craig Fertig called a pass over the middle. Sherman 
was open and in front of 83,000 people, Notre Dame, who had been number 
one since the sixth game of the season, was dethroned 20-17· 
John McKay was in his fourth season at USC and exhibited then some 
of his now-famous wit.

The Week That Was 
South Bend, but Parseghian was waiting 
for next year's trip back to the Los Angeles 
Coliseum to avenge the 1964 game. 
Coley O'Brien, replacing the injured T­erry Hanratty, threw three touchdown passes and the Irish demolished Southern Cal 51-0 in front of 88,520 stunned fans. McKay in a nearly silent locker room after the contest stated, "I guess I've never seen a better team than Notre Dame was today." 
He had good reason to say that. O'Brien, who was playing his first full game at quarterback, connected on 21 of 31 passes for 255 yards of the 461 ammassed. Jim Seymour pulled in 11 passes for 150 yards and two TD's. O'Brien was named back of the week by Sports 1llustrated for his performance but the magazine still felt that the Irish did not deserve to be called national champs. The reason was the celebrated 10-10 tie against Michigan State a week before the SC game. SI thought Nebraska should be number one, but the polls defied the Cornhuskers, the Crimson Tide and SI by naming the Irish as best. 
After 1966 the slate was less than im­pressive for Notre Dame. Ties in 1968 and 1969 were the highpoints until Eric Penick made his run in 1973, and Notre Dame finally triumphed 23-14. 
Last year shall be ignored. 
The Irish-Trojan series has featured great football and in one day another mark will be placed on the slate. It will surely not pale in comparison with the other 46 games. 


It was to be the week that was. Dusk was settling in on the wind swept Notre Dame 
campus. It was Tuesday,October 23, 1973 and the day had been a bitterly cold one. Ara Parseghian had spent the past tw hours overlooking the 84th edition of Notre Dame football, injecting comments, and witticisms here and there, and reflecting an image of fret that long had become a Parseghian hallmark. All were heading over to training table, the traditional chow-down in the North Dining Hall. 
"Say Ernie. Would you like a ride?" The voice was 
that of offensive backfield coach Tom Pagna. Pagna was never below picking up hungry hitchhikers for the short ride to supper. For the straggling few , it 
was a welcome relief that he'd even pick up famished sophomore student managers. 
Anyone who has ever seen Pagna coach must be impressed by the man's methodical teacher-like manner of coaching. He tutors his1backslike a drill

good blocking and running. Pagna had played for 
Parseghian in the early 50's at Miami of Ohio,later joining him as a coach at Northwestern i 1959. Like Ara, Pagna had waited almost seven years for this 
week. "I just have to believe," Pagna contemplated as we waited for the '74 Ford to warm up, "that this year we. are ging to do it. Everything is in our favor. The films show we can run certain plays on them. If there ever was a year, iliis , has to be it. I pray it's a nice day." The upcoming Notre Dame-Southern California game preoccpied 'many a mind on that Tuesday and many Tuesdays prior. The Irish were still stinging from a 45-23 Trojan massacre suffered the previous December. In that debacle, USC running back An­thonyDavisdemonstrated to ilie entire world how easy it was to score six touchdowns versus Notre Dame. To make matters worse, th Irish had not beaten the Trojans since 1966, with ties in '69 and '70 marring an otherwise perfect Trojan slate. In 1973, both teams had galloped off to liJzhtning starts. The two were undefeated and ranked high by the pollsters with USC holding a slight edge in' 'Doth the AP and UPI ballots. 1For this classic grudge-match.one which many believe dates back to the days of Troy, there could be no finer build­up. All week the Notre Dame campus shook wiili ex­citement. The men of Sorin created a mock Anthony Davis and hung the Californian messiah in effigy for all to see. A banner draped the front of Dillon Hall stating, "I will never again lost to a Notre Dame football team -John McKay, November 26, 1966." Impromptu rallies were the vogue in1the dining halls. Friday, October 26 saw the Observer issue one of its greatest issues.On ilie backpage Davis was pictured scoring each of his six touchdowns in 1972. The Sorin lynching was front-page material. Reserve ~lit end Willie Townsend was to utter the famous words which would make the issue a collector's item. A Willie so aptly put it, "The time is now." Saturday, October Tl finally arrived. What Pagna had feared most earlier in the week had come to pass. The day was frightfully overcase. By kick-off time, a mist shoruded over Notre Dame Stadium. On Southern 
Cal's first possession, freshman Luther Bradley perfectly read a Pat Haden screen pass. The ball arrived at the same time as Bradley did. Bradley slammed into split-end Lynn Swann, unleasing the ball from his grasp and catapulting Swann's helmet five yards beyond the collision. The tempo of the game was set. 

After a Bob Thomas field goal, USC's Pt Haden directed a nine-play drive covering 65 yards with Davis dancing in for the one-yard score. Another field goal by Thomas and a Tom Clements walk-in touch­down made the score 13-7 in favor of the Irish at the half. 
Throughout the first half, Pagna and Parseghian carefully toyed with the offense. Line coach Bill Hickey was on the phones to coaches Mike Stock and Brian Boulac, both of whom were sitting ill the press box. Pagna and Ara would confer and Parseghian would signal the play out tl Clements. A patient conservative game plan was to pay off. 
The coaches had noticed a weakness in the Trojan defense. Quickly, the offense was huddled around Pagna as he diagrammed a play in ilie crowded locker room at halftime. 
When the Irish returned to the field the rain had intensified. A Southern Cal punt put the Irish on their own 15. Ara told Clements to run the play that was explained at the half. Quickly the X's and O's sprung to life. Clements took the snap, Art Best drove through the left side of the Trojan front, Gerry DiNardo made ilie block of hisJife, right side tight end Dave Casper swept to his left joining reserve tight end Robin Weber in wiping out the rest of the left side interference and Eric Penick took the Clements handoff. Penick, his hips churning like an Italian 

winemaker  stomping  grapes,  broke  two  tackles  
andraced 85  yards  forthe  score.  Perfection  
personified.  

USCcame right back to score as Pat Haden his Swann with a 27-yard touchdown pass. Swann made an unbelievable grab as Tom Lopienski was with him step for step. 
Parseghian, still seething from ilie fact that Reggie Barnett was ejected ,from the game without warning, was screened out on the play. He raced up the sidelines demanding, "What the hell happened? Did aQybody see what happened?" 
The1Irish hung on to win 23-14. Just before the end of the game, J .K. McKay, a junior split end and the coach's con, could be seen in tears on the SC bench. It was ilie agony of defeat encompassed by the thrill of victory. 
Pandemonium reigned in the Notre Dame locker room . Ara clutched the game ball as he busily chatted with reporters. Pagna was wild with jubilation as he exlaimed, "We are all part of this great victory. I want to congratualte the student mangers. They did just as much to earn this win as anyone else." 
The~following Tuesday, Sports Illustrated came out wiili Notre Dame on the cover. The headline read, "Irish Stack Up USC." In the article Penick explained why he did not do a dance when he scored on that 85­yard run. "Hell," Penick laughed, "I'm no hot dog. This is Notre Dame." 
Indeed, a perfect ending to the week that was.

When they asked John McKay why his tailbacks carried the ball 25-30 times a game, he replied 'Why not? It isn-'t very heavy." 
The Tailback Tale 

He stands about six yards in back of the line of scrimmage directly behind the quarterback and fullback. He is hunched over, hands on knees, staring straight ahead at the defense. He wears dark red helmet and gold pants. His name is Mike Garrett, O.J. Simpson, Clarence Davis, Anthony Davis or now Ricky Bell. He is Southern California tailback and, next to Notre Dame quarterback, he ~lays the most glamourous position in'college football. 
Whatever his name, his acheivements over the past fourteen years defy belief. Eight times he has rushed for over 1000 yeards and ten times he has exceeded the Notre Dame school record total of 927. 
Coach John McKay talks about his great tailbacks in his book "McKay: A Coaches Story". The first was Mike Garrett, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1965. "Mike was only 5-9 and 185 pounds but at the time he was the greastest college player I had ever seen. He was a tremendously strong runner, so damn quick you couldn't believe it. He had much better speed than anyone ever thought he had. And when he was surrounded and going down, he could scramble along thegroundfor more yards faster than some people can run~5tanding up. Mike was a complete football player who did everything we asked of him -and we asked a lot." 
Southern Cal lacked a super tailback in 1966 <Good trivia question: who was the SC tailback between Garrett and O.J. Simpson? Answer: Don McCall) but a man nicknamed Orange Juice came along in 1967 and with McKay's help he stood the football world on it's ear. McKay comments: "O.J. Simpson stood 6·2, weighed 210 pounds and ran the 100 in 9.3. He was the perfect physical speciman for the position of tailback." 
One of McKay's great strengths is his ability to recognize talent and take advantage of it. Simpson averaged over 30 carries a game, including one time when he carried an incredible 47 times. We slipped 
O.J. the ball so often people said I was sadistic." 
Rich. Odioso 
Simpson set an NCAA career rushing record in only two seasons. His first wo years were spent at San Francisco City College where he was a defensive back and flanker but McKay saw the potential for a great running back. 
McKay again saw what no one else saw in Clarence Davis, who was a guard in high school. Davis gained 2,323 yards in two seasons 0969-70) as the TrojanTailback. 
Then it was another Davis, Anthony, for three years <1972-73-74) and a new Pac 8 record of 3.74 career yards. McKay describes Davis. 
''He's has very strong legs, fantastic body balance, long legs for a short man and a unique running style that reminds me of Gale Sayers. He has the ability to split himself like a . Russian dancer and keep run­ning." Davis was a quarterback in high school. 
And now there is Ricky Bell, the heaviest of the tailbacks at 215 pounds. In just six games since moving from fullback last year, Bell has already gained 1068 yards and scored nine touchdowns. McKay describes Bell, as "a super damn runner. He's fast, tough, big, and strong and has the acceleration a good back needs." 
The five tailbacks were all great runners and many have claimed that McKay was lucky to have such talent. McKay concedes their natural talent but also claims, "Great runners are not born. Great' runners are made. The talented young man must be taught how to run, where to run and how to challlenge the defense. And sometimes against his will he must be forced to become tougher than he wants to be." 
"USC backs run hard becuase we insist they run hard. We're always screaming "Run Hard!" We won't play anybody who doesn't." McKay also teaches his runners that, "There's one bad thing abut carrying the football-it attracts a crowd. No one takes a pounding like a top running back." USC backs are taught to absorb contact. They also are taught ac­celeration and concentration. 

Anthony Havis Then there is the naLure of the 1-formation which gets the best from a great tailback. It enables the back to run a large number of different plays. It provides him with optimum blocking and yet does not enable a defense to key .on the run exclusively. Passing has always been an tmportant part of the Trojan offense. This does not mean that Bell will run at will against Notre Dame tomorrow. Notre Dame has often been a~le to h?ld the tailback in check. Only one runner, Stmpson m 1967, has gained over one hundred yards against the Irish. McKay says "Whenever we've beaten Nore Dame its been with the pass." In 1975 things may be different. Vince Evans the Southern Cal quarterback is a great runner but has completed only 32 per cent of his passes and is bothered by a sore thumb. Bell has been averaging thirty carries per game an average only exceeded by . Simpson as a senior. Towmorrow more than ever the center of attention will be the USC tailback.

John McKay: 119-36-8 
Fred Herbst 

John McKay, head football coach at the University of Southern California, is no stranger to Notre Dame. 
In fact, McKay has practically made a habit out of ruining the season for the Irish. The Trojans have beaten previously undefeated Notre Dame teams five times <1931, 1938, 1964, 1970, and 1970, three times under McKay. Each prevented the Irish from win­ning national champiosnships. 
Against the Irish, McKay has a record of 7-6-2, but in the last eight years he is 5-1-2. 
Overall, McKay has a record of 119-36-8: 
Since rebuilding the Trojan program, he is 111-25­7 in the last thirteen years. McKay currently ranks 
eighth among active coaches in total number of 
victories. Bear Bryant of Alabama is the leader. 
McKay not only stops the Irish from winning national championships, he wins them himself. USC's Rose Bowl win over Ohio State last season gave McKay his fourth national championsip and his second in the last three years. Bear Bryant of Alabama and Frank Leahy are of Notre Dame are the only only other coaches to capture four national titles. 
The Trojans under McKay's direction, have won national championships in 1962, 1967, 1972 and 1974. They have finished in the top ten of the polls ten times, have won none Pacifie-S championships and have gone undefeated three times. 
The 51 year-old coach has also dominated the prestigous Rose Bowl. McKay has led USC to Pasadena eight times, a Rose Bowl record, and seven times in the last nine years. He has a 5-3 record in the · 
Rose Bowl. USC. 
The USC mentor is also the only coach to go to the Born in Everettsville, West Virginia, July 5, 1923, Rose Bowl four consecutive years.

Bli~np. Trojans herefor Irish clash 

(

~)_ 

by Bill Brink Sports Editor 
The Goodyear blimp is here, the rallies have begun and the bookstore is low on sweatshirts. It can only mean one thing. 
It's the one week that puts South Bend in the paper even more than New York City, and it's all winding down to tomorrow at 12:50 E.S.T. when the University of Southern California meets the Fighting Irish 
of  Notre  Dame  at  Notre  Dame  
Stadium.  
The  Irish-Trojan  contest  has  

been called the greatest inter­section revalry in college football and lately the clashes have borne that statement out. For the last three years, the winner of the NO­USC games has gone on th win the national championship. 
"Obviously they are an out­standing football team," said ND coach Dan Devine of USC. "It's the same Southern Cal football team that we've always played, they come here undefeated. They play exceptional football and play exceptionally well against us. The scouts say they are just as strong, just as fast and just as mature as ever." 
Though Devine has never faced the Trojans, he need only to look at
the past record to see the task that 
awaits him. Notre Dame has beaten USC only once in the last eight years, and twice in that time the Trojans have cost the Irish the national championship. 
If there is any small consolation in Southern Cal's undefeated (6-0) record this fall it lies in their rather unimpressive per­formances against mediocre teams. John McKay's squad has faced Duke, Oregon St., Purdue, Iowa, Washington St. and Oregon

The Irish Eye 
Ohio State and Michigan accounted for nearly half of the Big Ten's point total last weekend, shutting out tteir opponents 125-Q. The Buckeyes swanped Wisconsin 56-0 while Michigan routed Northwestern 69-o. Both teams will coast through the rest of their Big Ten segment until they collide in Ann Arbor November 22. 
The Big Eight juggled around a bit, with Colorado handing favored Missouri a 34-20 defeat. But Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska won, although the Cornhuskers had a little trouble with Oklahoma St., stifling a Cowboy rally to win 28-20. 
Texas edged Arkansas with it's strong ground attack, and Alabama rolled over a very respectable Tennessee team. Fifth ranked Texas A&M had more trouble though, notching only a 14-6 win over hapless Texas Christian. 
Tereshould be nothing surprising about this week's Big Ten results, and Colorado-Nebraska is the one to watch in the Big Eight. In the south, the Aggies meet Baylor and Georgia Tech travels to Tulane. 
The big match, of course, is right here in South Bend this week, where the Trojans of USC (6-0) clash with the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame (5-1). Southern Cal looked sluggish last Saturday in their. 17-3 win over Oreon, while the Irish pulled off another thrilling comeback to beat Air Force 31-30. 
Here are the Irish Eye's picks: 
Texas Christian at Alabama (Birmingham): The 
tide is moving so well that some say· Bear Bryant 
never ' tkes his team off the field, but just keeps them 
drivit··, back and forth all week until they meet each 
new o~:-:ment every Saturday. They won't even know 
the Horned Frogs are on the Field with them 
tomorrow. TCU has the nations longest losing streak 
in the nation at 16, and the Tide should have no 
trouble extending it. Alabama by 30. Georgia Tech at Tulane: The Green Wave overcame a 14-0 deficit last week to upset West Virginia, while Tech squandered their lead over Auburn. The Yellowjackets powerful ground game, still number on in the country, gives them the edge. Tech by 7. 
Baylor at Texas A&M: The Bears have tied Auburn and Michigan, and have lived on it all season. They were idle last weekend, but got killed by Arkansas two weeks age. Bubba Bean scored the Aggies two touchdowns in thier unimpressive victory over TCU but he leads a strong ground game that shouldgive the Aggies the edge. Texas A&M by 14. Oklahoma St. at Kansas: Both are good, but the Cowboys are better. OSU by 7. Iowa State at Oklahoma: The Sooners would have a

tougher time playing their own redshirts. They'll be looking ahead to contests with Oklahoma St., Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska, but stillhave enough to down the Cyclones. Oklahoma by 14. Rice at Texas: Owl couch AI Conover can pull any prank he wants, but he's still going to be watching Longhorn fullback Earl Campbell fly past him all day, unles~ he sec ides to shoot him. Longhorns by 20. Navy at Pittsburgh: Pitt has tuned up for this one with grueling contests against William & Mary, Duke, Temple and Army, but still the Middies will need a fleet to halt Tony Dorsett. Panthers by 7. Kansas State at Missouri: The Tigers turned the ball over twoce in a minute last week and Colorado took advantage of it. But quarterback Steve Pisarkiewiez runs a powerful Missouri attack that should control the Wildcats, who could not handle Oklahoma last w~ek. Ti~ers bv to 
California at UCLA: UCLA scores high, but the 
Bears scored higher last Saturday, chalking up 51 
points against Oregon St. If the Bruins show any 
defense at all, then John Sciarra will lead them by the 
Bears. UCLA by 7. 
Colorado at Nebraska: Nebraska has time and again 
staved off upsets, and that is what they will probably 
do tomorrow. The Buffaloes will gibe them a run for 
their money, but the Juskers will take home the pot. 
Nebraska by 10. 
Illinois at Michigan St.: The Illini handed Purdue its 
first victory last week, and that's a distinction: It's 
hard to follow an act like that, so they .ll probably just 
lose gracefully to the Spartans. MSU by 17. 
Indiana at Michigan: If Bo tries to tell us he's 
worried about this one then he's got more gall than 
even Woody Hayes suspected. His only concern is 
whether or not the Hoosiers dieced to show up. 
Wolverines by 45. 
Ohio St. at Purdue: After winning their first game 
last week, Alex Agase's Boilermakers will get 
knocked off thier cloud, shoved out of the stadium and 
deposited in the alley behind Ross-Ade Stadium. 
Buckeyes by 50. 
Northwestern at Wisconsin: These two great 
defensive teams gave up the 125 points that Ohio St. 
and Michigan totaled last week. But if the Badgers 
can regain their ego, and offense, they should win 
their last five games. Wisconsin by 7. 
Upset of the Week: Notre Dame over Southern Cal. 
In a contest like this anything can happen. So far the 
Irish have lived by that motto, and if they can score 
some of their famed fourth quqarter touchdowns a 
little earlier, they QJay be psyched enough to beat the 
Trojans. John McKay's team hasn't played anyone 
yet, and they don't like 'South Bend. ND by 3. 

members to shame. Fullback Mosi Tatupu has a 5.5 yards per game average, and quarterback Vince Evans is a strong runner also. Evans has completed only 32 per cent of his passes, but has 124 yards on the ground. 
"Evans is a great runner in his own right," says Devine. "There's no question that he's the most gifted running-quarterback I've ever seen. With Bell, Tatupu and (Dwight> Evans in the same back­field the defense cannot afford to make a mistake." 
The Trojan receiving corps is led by flanker Shelton Diggs, who caught the winning two-point conversion in last year's Rose Bow. Mike Howell is the tight end and Randy Simmrin is the split end. The offensive line returns All­American candidate Marvin Powell at tackle and Joe Davis at weak guard. 
Despite the much-publicized 

offense, it is the defense which is 
USC's strong suit this year. It has 
beld fast when the Trojan offense 
has sputtered. 
The big man for SC is 6-4, 240 lb. 

Gary Jeter, an All-American 
candidate at tackle. Jeter, the 
Trojan line's leading tackler last 
year, is very quick, running the 40 
in 4. 7. The rest of the defensive 
line is new this year, with Tim­
Rhames, Walt Underwood and 
Larry Nunnally joining Jeter. 
At linebacker, Kevin Bruce leads 

the way, with Dave Lewis and 
Dave Logie also excellent. Bruce 
led USC in tackles last year and

The feeling 


It never changes: the feeling that accompanies NotreDameSouthern Cal week has something to do with fever. It descends once each year, replete with all the symptoms of a life-or-death affliction that infects players and non-players alike. When it breaks, hearts-eit er Irish or 'Trojan-break with it. Indeed, no one in either camp can avoid it. 
It starts as a dull pain in the back of the neck. In August, when discussions of Notre Dame hopes for a national football title have reached their usual proportions, the "if" perennially attached to the prospect of defeating Southern California begins to trob. The pressure builds, the heat increases as the season gets underway. The most crucial vic tries against all other rival provide only temporary relief for the headaches, queasy stomachs, and nervous tension caused by the approaching "big one." Even those who would not relate these ailments to that imminent occurrence so admit when the time is finally upon them, and the tem­perature skyrockets, the fever that wracks them is the one they've waited for all along. 
That is where we are right now. Itis time to play USC. Preparing for battle with the archest of all our arch-rivals is like preparing for no other opponent on our schedule. Actually, Southern 'cal Makes it easy for us to get ready for this game. There isn't a player on the squad who wouldn't do anything to beat the Trojans. Year after year the remarkks, reactions and overall attitude conveyed by Southern California personnel prior to the game whip our anticipation of the meeting into frenzy. Likewise, losing to them proves more maddening each season. In the lst eight years, Notre Orne has defeated Southern Cal once. That is a shocking, embarassing realization. It is one that each edition of the football team feels honor-bound to avenge. The sting of every loss carries over from one season to the next. No doubt the memory of lash year's debacle in the L.A. Coliseum weighs heavily on the minds of every team member. Add to that th collection of losses to USC in the last decade, an one finds the key to a real hunger on the part of the Irish to turn the tide. The performances of both teams prior to the collision become im­material in light of a desire on the part of each to destroy the other. Won­lost records, national rankings, and bowl bids notwithstanding, neither team's season is complete until the challenge of aa contest between the two is undertaken. This year neither team has played overwhelmingly impressive foot­ball, though the Trojans have managed to maintain a number three ranking in the national polls. Both teams have endured costly errors in all of their games. We especially have consistently handcuffed ourselves with a tendency to commit mistakes at crucial points in the games. We have limited potentially impressive performances because of this, and in one instance, cost ourselves a victory. Up until now, our offense,which can move the ball at will, and our defense, which can stop any opponent hasn't sustained these charac­teristics long enough t cooperate with each other and play the kind of football we are capable of playing. All of this is behind us, however. Memories and mistakes fade equally fast when it comes down to playiing Southern California. We have worked hard this week to improve every aspect of our game. Every member of this year's team knows what lies in store this Saturday and what it will take to win. For us, exigency has a way of limiting carelessness. In our last two games, when the odds against us seemed hopeless, everything began to click, for us. Everything must click Saturday as well. For the time being, however, let ths Trojans consider us lightly. Hopefully they will anticipate a bumbling Irish team. If they expect to deal with a massive, immobile machine, like the ancient Trojans did whE7n they brought the great wooden horse within their walls, they will discover when they kknock on our wood this' Saturday we are a horse of a vastly differently color. 
Lewis leads this year. The Trojans have lost outside backer Mario Celotto though, due to a leg injury. Rod Martin replaces him. 
In the secondary, cornerback 
Ted Roberson is also out with a leg 
injury, but Danhy Reece, Clint 
Strozier, and Doug Hogan make up 
a solid defensive backfield. 
"Our defense has been very good," says McKay, "But it's much weaker now with the loss of Cellotto and Roberson. The out­side linebackers in particular are a key part of our defense, and any time you've got good spedd out there. it makes it hard for anybody I o get outside." 
The Irish meanwhile, are likely to have several starters that were doubtful at the beginning of the week. Fullback Jerome Heavens figures to be ready despite a knee injury, and Joe Montana, Steve Orsisi and Al Wujciak should be sufficiently recovered from hip pointers. 
Defensively, linebacker Doug Becker should start after missing the last two games with an ankle injury. Ross Browner, who did not start last week but saw extensive action, will also be in the starting lineup. Randy Harrison will be ready at free safety, with fresh­man Joe Restic backing him up. Restic is also slated to handle the punting duties, having set a Notre Dame single-game record last week with an average of 51.6 yards per punt. 
Toniorrow's game will be nationally televised by ABC.
