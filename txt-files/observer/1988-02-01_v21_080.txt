Largest Iowa newspaper endorses Dole, Simon 
Associated Press 
DES MOINES, Iowa -Iowa's largest-circulating daily news­paper on Sunday endorsed Re­publican Bob Dole and Demo­crat Paul Simon in the state's Feb. 8 presidential caucuses. 
The Des Moines Register, in departing from a tradition of not endorsing candidates before the caucuses, rejected Vice President George Bush for supporting the Iran-Contra deal and said Democrats would not have to apologize if any of their party's candidates won, except Gary Hart. 
The newspaper gave its ap­proval to the two senators from nearby Midwestern states in side-by-side editorials and ex­plained its decision to make the unusual endorsements in a sep­arate column by editor James Gannon. 
No other large Iowa daily so far has endorsed candidates in the precinct presidential selec­tion process, which provides the first voter test for six Re­publican and seven Demo­cratic candidates. 
The Register, which has readers across the state, where candidates have focused much of their early campaign, said that while it disagreed with Senate Republican leader Dole of Kansas on a number of is­sues, "it is usually possible to tell where he is coming from. And it is from a good place ­

Jerusalem summer programwill continue as planned 
By BRADLEY GALKO News Staff 
Students participating in the Jerusalem Summer Study Program are not ex­pected to be in any great danger though the semester program in Jerusalem was cancelled ·this year, accor­ding to Father Patrick Gaf­fney, a coordinator for the program. 
The summer program, which runs from June 11 to Aug. 7, is the "product of a consortium of four Catholic universities," namely Notre Dame, Fordham, Geor­getown, and Villanova, said Gaffney. Any student at any of the four universities is el­ligible to participate he said. The program consists of six weeks of intensive courses in Arab and Islamic Studies and two week-long trips which interrupt the normal curriculum. Three courses, "Intensive Conversational Arabic," "Modern Middle East History," and "Biblical Archaeology," will be taught for a possible 12 credit hours. 
Students will study and live at the Tantur Ecumeni­cal Institute just outside the city of Jerusalem in its Jor danian, Israeli-occupied sector. The institute .is run by the University of Notre Dame and was originally constructed in the mid-1960s under the auspices of Father Theodore Hesburgh. 
The Jerusalem Summer Study Program began last year but no Notre Dame stu­dents went, said Gaffney. "This year we hope to get a good number (of students)," he said. In addition to studies, students will be host to a wide range of extracur­ricular activities. "Tantur is so close to Jerusalem," said Gaffney, "(that) anything they want to do in Jerusalem" is open to stu­

The Holy Land is not always holy 
Where are all the protest marches? The charity rock concerts? The "moments of silence" on the steps of the Administration Building? 
Although I'm sure this doesn't come as a shock, Israeli soldiers eased from the picture about two score dissidents last month. 
Many are probably thinking, "Why does this guy think this topic deserves an inside column? Things of this sort happen all the time." Such observations, however, say something by them­selves. 
In the midst of continual reports of Israeli soldiers machine-gunning civilians, bulldozing houses to make way for Jewish settlers, and resorting to torture, nobody seems to care at all, including our self-proclaimed "idealists." 
No, I don't have an Arab girlfriend, and no, I haven't bought the Palestinian complaint 
. hook, line and sinker. Still, Domers aren't the only ones who are supposed to be a family, but rather the whole human race (Texas A&M being excluded, of course). Yet apparently a good Palestinian is a dead one, as far as we're concerned. 
Consider, for instance, how often the Western press labels Palestinian dissidents who just sabotaged an Israeli military installation as "terrorists" or "guerillas," while describing rebels in South Africa, who may have just raped, mutilated, or burned alive one of their opponents, as "fighting for social justice" or practicing "civil disobedience." 
I cited our contrasting attitude to the insur­gents in South Africa intentionally. Although I don't want to oversell yet another "cause," the number of similarities between Israel and South Africa are amazing. 
Political oppression? In the Israeli occupied territories, no political meetings or demonstra­tions are allowed, no anti-government newspapers or printed matter is permitted, and all political parties are banned. Also, there are mass evictions, demolitions of houses to make way for Israeli settlers, curfews and travel re­strictions. 
Human rights violations? Whereas South Africa has its Sharpeville massacre, Israel has its Qafir Kassem and Qibya. Furthermore, one need only consult the findings of Amnesty In­ternational, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Swiss League of Human Rights or the U.S. State Department to find ample evidence of torture. 
Forms of torture reportedly range from the application of traction to electric shocks. I could go on, but this is a Catholic university. In ad­dition, most of the above agepcies C<?nclude that such instances, far from being exceptions to the rule committeu uy overzealOus officers, result from a conscious, methodical policy.

vice tasks. The 750,000 Arabs in the West Bank are in much the same situation, receiving much lower wages and fewer benefits than their Is­raeli counterparts. None of the Arabs in these areas are allowed to enter Israeli settlements in these areas. 
Those Arabs not living in the occupied zones, live in ghettoes in the Galilee and Haifa districts or the "Little Triangle." In addition, educa­tional facilities are segregated and medical facilities in the occupied territories are inade­quate. 
One could justify all this on grounds it is nec­essary for Israel's security, being surrounded as it is by a sea of Gentile nations. Then again South Africa could do the same for its own policies, being surrounded as it is by a sea of Black nations. 
Nevertheless, even this justification becomes debatable. Judging from comments made by Israeli leaders, one wonders if the occupied ter­ritories stand as a buffer zone or as a new Israeli Lebensraum. As Golda Meir put it: "Do you really think that we are investing millions here in order to leave one day?" 
Now assuredly, it is easy to sympathize with the Israelis' situation. Nevertheless, if the Is­raelis have a claim to Palestine, so do the Dutch descendents to much of South Africa, since South Africa's indigenous Hottentots have long since disappeared--much like Palestine's original Canaanites--the land being invaded by the Dutch and the Bantus simultaneously. 
Yet whereas we won't even consider corpor­ate investment in South Africa, we continue to give Israel over $3 billion each year, including military aid. 
Why the discrepancy? 
You tell me why.

Dooley award given to grad for 'outstanding service' 
By CHRIS SKORCZ 
News Staff 
Notre Dame graduate Ceyl Prinster was awarded the 1988 Dr. Thomas A. Dooley Award in a ceremony at the Morris Inn Friday night. 
Established in 1983, the Dooley Award is given an­nually by the Notre Dame Alumni Association to the alumnus or alumna who has most clearly "demonstrated outstanding service to fellow men," according to the award criter.ia. 
Prinster's involvement in community service began during her undergraduate years at Notre Dame. She graduated in 1976 and was a member of the University's first full four-year class of wo­men. Prinster was a co-founder of the Notre Dame World Hunger Coalition. 
After graduation, Prinster continued to be active in social service through her involve­ment in the Notre Dame Club of Denver, despite being the victim of systemic lupus eryt­hematosis, a chronic hyperac­tivity of the immune system for which there is no known cure. 
Emphasizing the develop­ment of values and community service, Prinster instituted the Denver Club's Summer Ser­vice Project with the Center for Social Concerns. This six year-old program provides a sum­mer internship in community service for a local Notre Dame student in return for approxi­mately $1,200 in scholarship funds. The management and placement of participating stu­dents have been Prinster's duties and she has been almost solely responsible for the Proj­ect's fund-raising activities. 
In addition to her chairman-

state's precinct caucuses, which are set for Feb. 8. 
Babbitt, campaigning in Iowa, labeled Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' major proposals "a fraud" and said, "he has ducked and run from every tough issue." 
"That's not just a failure of policy," said Babbitt in remarks prepared for delivery at a Waterloo rally. "It's a fail­ure of candor, a failure of courage, and a political failure of the worst kind." 
A day earlier, Babbitt at­tacked Simon's description of himself as a "real Democrat." Babbitt said he plans an attack 
on Rep. Richard Gephardt 
during a college speech on 
Monday. 
Dukakis aides quickly dis­
missed the Babbitt assault as 
a desperation move. 
"It's his all-purpose charge 
against every candidate," said 
spokeswoman Lorraine Voles. 
The Dukakis camp, mean­while, was on the defensive over an incident involving a staffer -who has now left the Dukakis campaign -trying to "infiltrate" a Simon office. 
Both campaigns said Bill Taylor, who was a national campaign staffer for Dukakis, went to a Simon campaign of­fice in Cedar Rapids last week and volunteered to help with a phone-bank operation. 
"It was a dumb, stupid thing to do," said Dukakis spokes­woman Voles, saying that Taylor acted "completely on his own." 
Simon aides, demanding as­surances that it wouldn't hap­pen again, called the action a "cheap, stupid stunt." 
The Dukakis campaign also said Sunday that most of the governor's Iowa staffers have taken pay cuts of up to 50 per­cent in an effort to stay within campaign spending limits for the state, set down by the Federal Election Commission. They said the cuts were not due to a shortage of money. 
In endorsing Simon, the Des Moines Register pointed to his record as ''a man who has decent instincts and sticks by them."

Abortion issue needs rethinking 
January 22, 1988 marked the fifteenth anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in the case of Roe vs. Wade which legalized abortion in the United States. For the fifteen years that have followed the landmark ruling, heated arguments have occurred between right-to-life groups and pro-choice adv­ocates. Two disturbing facts, among others, still persist: the Supreme Court's ruling has legalized the killing of innocent human beings every year and so many Americans simply ignore this catastrophe. 
Rob Hahn 
guest column 
Th~ statistics surrounding abortion 
speaK for themselves. As Charles Rice, 
a professor of law at the University of 
Notre Dame noted in his book "50 Ques­
tions on Abortion, Euthanasia and 
Related Issues," since 1973, the death 
toll from abortions is greater than 20 
million; legalized abortion kills more 
than 1.5 million American babies every 
year; and in 18 metropolitan areas in 
the United States, abortions outnumber 
live births. 
The United States, along with other 
countries where abortion is legal, is 
dealing with an atrocity comparable to 
the Nazi Holocaust. Still, those in in­
fluential positions of government fail to 
do anything worthy of causing change. 
President Reagan has produced some 
sweet-sounding abortion-related rhet­
oric lately, but to be respectfully frank, 
"Where's the beef?" 
We Americans are also faced with those politicians who may be personally opposed to abortion but do nothing be­cause a pro-life stance contradicts their political philosophies. Take for exam­ple, Sen. Edward Kennedy and Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, who are prominent Catholic Democrats. To retain their incumbencies and remain consistent with their political ideologies, these two individuals have taken a stance of silence andt>r pro­choice. Worse yet, these two are only examples of those who have power to actually influence some change and do nothing. There are many others like Kennedy and Cuomo who could take ac­tion and let the general American public know about abortion. 
Another problem with the abortion issue is that numerous Americans simply do not know the immense prob­lems surrounding this tragedy. On Jan­uary 22, 1988, major media publications

in this country failed to even mention 
that it was the fifteenth anniversary of 
the ruling. The New York Times said 
nothing; the Chicago Tribune said noth­
ing; and even this publication failed to 
print anything, with the exception of 
the "Quote of the Day,"· which might 
have stimulated any opinion-forming 
thought on the abortion issue. The 
media, in one of the greatest positions 
of influence in this country, did nothing 
which might make the public aware of 
this issue. Instead of informing the 
public about abortion by placing a story 
about the Roe vs. Wade anniversary on 
the front page, the Chicago Tribune re­
ported on the front page that President 
Reagan wants money appropriated for 
more aid to the Contras. If Reagan 
worked as hard to overturn the Su­
preme Court's ruling on abortion as he 
does to gain more aid for the Contras, 
the decision very well may have been 
repealed by now. 

Perhaps one of the only philosophies 
of former Supreme Court nominee 
Judge Robert Bork with which this 
reporter concurs is his strong stance to 
work to overturn the Roe vs. Wade deci­
sion. One must at least admire Bork's 
integrity to face the abortion issue 
head-on during the intense questioning 
that surrounded his nomination. It is 
too bad his other viewpoints did not 
make his nomination more plausible, 
because America needs more people 
with the pro-life view in places of 
power. 

Still, it is alarming that so many Americans are not familiar with the Roe vs. Wade decision. Some fellow stu­dents questioned did not even know whether or not abortion is legal in the United States or other ramifications of Roe vs. Wade. People are not going to take action and work to put pressure to overturn the abortion decision, if they do not even know the basic facts about the issue. This ignorance persists as the killings of the innocent continue. 
The New York Times News Service recently reported that a new form of abortion is taking place in this country. Certain doctors have now begun offer­ing selective abortions to women who are either pregnant with more fetuses than they desire or more than they can safely carry. This practice of selective abortion has resulted in a pick-and­choose method, whereby, at times, a woman carrying more than one fetus will abort some and allow the remain­ing to proceed to birth. Using ultrasound techniques, doctors can reduce the number of fetuses carried

by a pregnant woman. A Philadelphia woman, after a sonogram performed early in her pregnancy, gave birth to twins after carrying six fetuses. In response to a different case of the same nature, Dr. Lawrence Platt of the Uni­versity of Southern California Medial Center in Los Angeles remarked, "It was a moral, ethical, and religious di­lemma." Where regular abortioys are horrible, this is even worse. How low has the medical profession sunk this time? 
Instead of making progress towards ridding America of legal abortion, those in the medical profession are devising different ways to perform the mass killings while, at the same time, politicians in the position to take action and create change, on the whole, are failing to sufficiently voice their pro-life views, much less take any action. As this process continues, the number of innocent humans who are victims of abortion continues to rise. The time is long overdue to admit our mistakes and change the Roe vs. Wade decision.

P.O. Box Q 
Right to censor protected by law 
Dear Editor: 
Mr. Mark McLaughlin's Jan. 15 arti­cle about censorship was prompt and focused, and it certainly proved the dif­ficulty in arriving at correct values. Even the Supreme Court disagreed about the Hazelwood, Missouri, High School newspaper case, to my amaze­ment. I thought the result was right, but I thought the Court did a bad job. 
Mr. McLaughlin asks whether any newspaper, school-sponsored or not, should be limited to publishing only the correct values, and who is to decide what those values are? Well, every­thing is limited to the correct value lest it be a lie, if that is not an over­simplified answer. The U.S. Constitu­tion leaves it to the people to decide what those correct values are. 
Just as long as we do not allow lies in the name of Free Press (as if Free Press is a higher good). Free Press is not a value. It is an accommodation. It regulates the government, not society. When Free Press becomes a principle to anyone who is in a position to do so, and he may exercise that responsibility according to his own rights, without any compunction whatsoever, and with the same Constitutional protection. The government is not his mentor. 
Neither is the newspaper fraternity. Freedom of the Press is a faculty that reposes in the people, not in the publish­ing industry (the Constitution does not protect the publishing industry). The press and the public are not two differ­ent things. Note that if a newspaper reporter may protect his sources, then so may I. 
The Constitution does not care whe­ther we have newspapers, and the judge errs who for some sentimental reason advances the idea that we shall have newspapers (as the Supreme Court recently resolved a complaint in favor of a newspaper just because it was "in the public interest" to do so). The Constitution certainly does not comtemplate a newspaper as someth­ing inevitably good and never evil.

Alcohol: 

TAMRYN ETTEN accent writer 
This is the first in a series ofar­ticles on alcohol education at Notre Dame. 
"Dennis" had 21 shots on his 21st birthday and never woke up the next day. 
"Dennis" was a student at a university like Notre Dame. He didn't know that alcohol could be lethal; neither did his friends. Now they do. 
"Most people don't know what their blood alcohol level is," said Dave Dannison, direc­tor of Notre Dame's Office of Alcohol and Drug Education, which will be having a dedica­tion ceremony in the LaFortune Student Center later this week. The office will help educate students about alcohol and its effects. 
One of the office's educa­tional functions is to teach people how to ascertain their blood alcohol content (BAC), the determining factor of life and death. A person who weighs I 00 pounds could reach the lethal limit if he imbibes 10 drinks in an hour. For a 150 pound person, that limit is around 15; a 200 pound person could reach that limit at 20. 
Knowing this might be 
handy, but as Dannison points 
out, "After three drinks, most 
people stop counting. They 
stop caring." 
At a certain level of BAC. the "buzz" of alcohol takes over without any of the negative effects of impaired ability to respond to stimuli, loss of judgement a drop in body temperature, and unconscious­ness. 
Get the facts 
"If a person can maintain a .05-.08 BAC level throughout the night, he would have a much better time and reduce the chance of having a hang­over the next day," said Barb Naser, executive director of the South Bend Alcholism Council. 
"Most students are binge drinkers and only drink on weekends," she added. "What they don't realize is that depending upon their drinking, their behavior and performance can be affected through the following Wednesday." 
Although alcohol education can instruct people on how to get the best "buzz" and keep alcohol from affecting their daily performance, it also in­forms people of the risks in­volved in both the use and abuse of alcohol. 
"Alcohol is the number two killer in America," said Naser, "followed by cancer and preceding heart disease." 
The facts are startling. "Den­
nis' " story, the one often used 
in alcohol lore, was unfortunate 
because his death was directly 
linked to intake of alcohol on 
one given occasion. Alcohol can be lethal in many other more subtle ways . 
"Many of the illnesses that people have are linked to abuse of alcohol," Naser said, "whether it's heart disease, cancer, stomach ailments intes­tinal problems, or high blood pressure." These diseases can eventually lead to death. 
Cirrhosis of the liver, the dis­ease most commonly linked to abuse of alcohol, kills 14,000 Americans a year. But alcohol abuse can promote the growth of other diseases by weakening the body's immune system, deteriorating the heart muscle, altering brain cells, triggering bleeding in the stomach and intestines, and changing hormone systems (which can lead to to im­potence in men and infertility in women). 
There are many other forms of "accidental" deaths linked to alcohol abuse. In 1986, drunk drivers caused roughly 23,000 highway deaths, and alcohol was implicated in roughly 3,000 drowning deaths and 9,000 suicides. 
In fact, alcohol-related high-

IRA's offer tax free haven for retirement investments 
By JOHN WHOLIHAN Business Writer 
Editor's Note: This is part of a continuing series on invest­ment opportunites avaiLable to Notre Dame students. 
Most seniors are now busily lining up a job, and the prospect of retirement lies far in the future. However, to en­sure having enough money to retire with requires one to begin planning a retirement fund as early as possible. 
Individual Retirement Ac­counts, usually refered to as IRA's, provide wage earners with a tax break and an oppor­tunity to save money. 
This segment of Wall Street at Notre Dame Avenue will ex­amine IRA's, and the different implications of the new tax law to IRA savers. 
IRA's initially started as a tax deductible savings plan of­fered by many financial insti­tutions including savings and loans, and brokerage firms. 
Savers could contribute up to $2000 a year to an IRA. The amount contributed was deducted from one's taxes. People found this "forced" 
savings plan  attractive:  the  
more  one  contributed  the  
greater the tax deduction.  

The recent tax law changes have altered the attractiveness of IRA's for some, but the basic plan remains the same. 
Anybody can start an Indi­vidual Retirement Account. The $2000 limit still applies, and savers can contribute this amount annually until retire­ment. 
Many IRA's are self­directed. That is, the money can be invested anyway the saver chooses. 
The real advantage of IRA's is that an investor is not taxed on any gains of the account. This includes capital apprecia­tion, interest, and dividends. 
The contributions and gains cannot be withdrawn without penalty until the saver reaches the age of fifty-nine and a half. 
The money withdrawn after 
One must decide whether to take an investment approach of safety, growth, or a combina­tion of both. 
For many people, an IRA is a nestegg: a guaranteed savings account at retirement. 
Others opt for investments that pay higher returns. These investors prefer growth invest­ments in order to counter infla­tion. 
After contributing to an ac­count for a number of years, some investors diversify their IRA's by investing for safety and growth. 
Before investigating any IRA investment strategy, one must realize that funds available will be relatively low due to the an­nual $2000 contribution limit. 
An initial stategy may in­clude safe investments, such as Certificates of Deposits (CD's) or money market funds. 
Those looking for safety will continue to invest in these se­curities and U.S. government securities. 
The interest earned on these instruments is not taxed, and these earnings, in combination with the next two years' contri-

Every other year, the Air Force Tactical Air Command has the Gunsmoke competition, a flying contest where pilots vie for "Top Gun", the best pilot in the country. Last October, Danny Hamilton became the first reservist in the competition's history to win the title. Hamilton was mentioned in Inc. Magazine as the founder of Microlan, a computer engineering, sales and leasing firm. He flies an F-16 on the weekends. 
The Air Force is going to take this successful businessman and family man for everything he's worth in their upcoming publicity campaign. Hamilton is going to be billed as the new Air Force flyer, and looks like he stepped off the screen of the movie "The Right Stuff." 
u The Last Word-Alan S. Binder, commenting on David Stockman's book, "The Triumph of Politics;" quoted in Inc. Magazine: "There are plenty of reasonable ideas for solving our economic problems--but when politics runs wild, sensible thinking gets shunted aside ... We still see the same political posturing, the same arguing over statistics (and the tricky accounting methods used to compile them), the same refusal to come to grips with reality."

The next question an IRA in­vestor faces is with whom to place the account. The answer depends on the investment strategy chosen. 
If an IRA saver chooses to invest strictly in instruments available through savings and loan associations, such as CD's, the investor could easily establish an IRA there. 
If financial securities such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds are chosen for one's IRA, the investor should consider setting up an account at a brokerage firm. 
Growth investors should wait to invest in stocks and bonds until after having saved roughly $5000. This amount al­lows the saver to create a diversified portfolio.

Win comes just as predicted 
Irish wrestlers breeze past foes at National Catholic 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
Before the National Catholic Tournament at Cleveland on Saturday, Notre Dame wres­tling coach Fran McCann all but predicted victory. 
At the tournament, the Irish wrestlers showed just why McCann was so confident. 
Notre Dame breezed past defending champion John Car­roll to win its second National Catholic title in the last three years. All10 of the Notre Dame starters placed, and seven of them won individual cham­pionships. 
"We went in with the idea that we had the shot of winning it," said McCann. "We had con­fidence. We knew it wasn't going to be easy, but we really hustled." 
Individual winners for Notre Dame included 118-pound soph­omore Andy Radenbaugh, 134­pound junior Jerry Durso, 142­pound senior Ron Wisniewski, 150-pound freshman Todd Layton, 158-pound freshman Mark Gerardi, 177-pound junior Chris Geneser and 190­pound sophomore George Logsdon. 
Logsdon and Wisniewski may have produced the biggest surprises of the tournament. Logsdon, a walk-on, came into the tournament with just a 7-8 record, but won the 190-pound division with relative ease. 
"He has improved a lot," said McCann. "He's really coming along. He didn't have a close match in the tourna­ment. He's got a lot more con­fidence now, and hopefully it will carry over to (NCAA) Regionals.'' 
Notre Dame hosts the NCAA Western Regional, which determines individual NCAA qualifiers, on March 4-5. 
Wisniewski, an NCAA qualifier last year, had a 7-5-1 record before the weekend. The senior co-captain dominated his division, leaving McCann wondering why a John Carroll wrestler was named outstand­ing wrestler of the tournament instead of Wisniewski. 
"I was really disappointed he wasn't named outstanding wrestler," said McCann. "He dominated everyone there. He had falls and technical falls, and beat the guy in the final 21-5. It was by far the most lop­sided final in the tournament." 
Other individuals placing for Notre Dame included senior heavyweight Domenic Prin­zivalli (third), 124-pound soph­omore Dave Smith (fourth) and 167-pound freshman Todd Tomazic (fourth). It was the first action for Tomazic since the collarbone injury he suf­fered over winter break. 
"He's at about 90 percent," said McCann. "The layoff hurt him in conditioning." 
Notre Dame's next dual meet will be at Nebraska next Sat­urday.

Irish swimmers beat Bonnies 
By GREG GUFFEY Sports Writer 
The Irish mens swimming team needed to be at its best to have a chance against St. Bonaventure Saturday, and the squad responded with its best effort of the season. 
The Irish used team depth to cap off a week of earnest prep­aration in downing the Bonnies, 114-103. The win, against a dominant team that awards scholarships, left coach Tim Welsh ecstatic. 
"The key factor in the meet was that it came from the in­side out," Welsh said. "I told the team that the idea of com­mitment, energy and prepara­tion of the group all came from the team and built to a peak this weekend. This was a com­plete team victory. Of the 29 actively training individuals, 24 scored points. "This is the strongest victory so far, and it was a total team concept. The team has put a list up in the

as many in the next two minutes to keep Kentucky on top. One basket was made pos­sible when Ellis was able to force a jump ball after Chap­man missed a shot, a play Phelps called one of the game's biggest. 
But the Irish had another 
shot, actually two more shots, 
but as the luck of the day would 
have, neither found the mark. 
After Winston Bennett over­
threw a long inbounds attempt, 
Rivers hit two free throws to 
bring the Irish within three 
with 24 seconds remaining. 
Freshman guard Tim 
Singleton then stripped Chap­
man in the backcourt, but amid 
some contact, Rivers missed a 
short banker and Jamere Jack­
son's attempt was blocked by 
Ellis. Davender, who led the 
Wildcats with 23 points, put the 
game away with six free 
throws in the final 11 seconds. 
Ellis, who found out he was think we can go undefeated the rest of the season." 
The womens squad, mean­while, bounced back from a Friday loss at Illinois State to down the Bonnies, 150-114. 
"This was our chance to mea­sure up to the Midwest cham­pion of last year," Welsh said of the Illinois State meet. "They are a balanced, strong, complete team. We showed considerable strength and we were able to create openings and prepare for our champion­ship meets. 
"We were able to keep opti­mistic and our energy fresh for today (against St. Bonaven­ture). We even swam better today." 
In the men's meet, the Irish took a 20-12 lead by taking the first four places in the 1000 freestyle; Brian Rini paced that attack with a first place. After falling behind 34-32, Jim Byrne won the 200 individual medley and the Irish led 42-41, a lead they never relinquished. 
Other winning performances by the Irish included Adam 
starting at forward opposite 
Bennett just before game time, 
scored a career-high 14 points 
and grabbed six rebounds in his 
first collegiate start. It was ''by 
far and away his best game," 
according to Kentucky coach 
Eddie Sutton. 
The freshman earned the 
Bernie Shively Memorial 
Plaque, given to the MVP in 
each Kentucky-Notre Dame 
game, and Richard Madison, 
who had been the starter 
recently, did not see any action 
because of Ellis' solid play. 
"I felt comfortable right 
away," said Ellis, the son of 
former NBA great LeRoy Ellis. 
"There are so many veterans 
that make it easy to fit in here, 
that you can just concentrate 
on your game and do try to 
make a contribution." 
Ellis, Bennett and center Rob 
Lock combined for 18 rebounds 
as the Wildcats became only 
the third team to outrebound 
the Irish, 29-25. 
"The biggest key for us was 
defensive rebounding," said 
Kentucky's Sutton. "We held Hirshfield in 3-meter diving, Rini in the 200 butterfly, Byrne in the 200 backstroke and Paul Godfrey in the 500 freestyle. 
The women started their meet against the Bonnies with a victory in the 200 medley relay by the team of Christine Moston, Becky Wood, Annette Quill and Tracy Johnson. The Irish also took the last three places to take the lead at 11-4. Moston won the 100 backstroke three events later to boost the Irish to a 36-30 advantage. 
The Bonnies took a 51-49lead, paced by wins in the 100 breaststroke and the 200 butter­fly, but Johnson put the Irish on top for good with a victory in the 50 freestyle. Other Irish winners included Andrea 
Bonny in the 1-meter and 3­meter diving, Kathy Quirk in the 100 freestyle, and the 400 free relay team of Johnson, Kelly Quinn, Quirk and Quill. 
The women host Eastern Michigan Tuesday, and both teams travel to St. Louis Friday and visit Ball State Sat­urday. 
them under double figures (in offensive rebounds, seven) which we haven't been doing very often this year." 
David Rivers led the Irish with 21 points, but was held to two-of-nine shooting in the second half with Rex Chapman guarding him most of the time. 
"He's such a great player that I just tried to stay with him and hopefully throw him out of his rhthym a little," said Chap­man. "You can't stop him, you just hope you can do something to contain him somewhat." 
Gary Voce added a career­high 18 points for the Irish (now 0-3 in Super Bowl Sunday games) and Fredrick hit for 14, tying his career high. 
"I'm disappointed in the way we lost," said Phelps. "I thought we made some mental mistakes we shouldn't have made that put us in negative situations. 
"We're a team that ab­solutely has to do the little things to be consistent."

MVP Williams etches name in record books 
"I didn't come here to be the The four touchdowns -all in a could walk and set up," Wil­Williams said that he thought to start a remarkable second-period ex­liams said. "No matter what the MVP award could have SAN DIEGO -Doug Wil­

liams' slice of Super Bowl his­tory has nothing to do with black and white, except for the print in the record book: 340 yards and four touchdown passes. 
No other quarterback, black or white, ever did better. 
Williams, the first black quarterback to start a Super Bowl, drove the Washington Redskins to a 42-10 rout of the Denver Broncos Sunday night. All week, Williams refused to make this a matter of race and he maintained that posture after being named the game's most valuable player. 
Rout 
continued from page 16 
Beginning with the 56-yard touchdown pass from Elway to Nattie! on their first play from scrimmage, the Broncos befuddled the Redskins in the first quarter with just about everything in their diverse playbook. 
While Washington was start­ing its first five possessions at its own 20 or worse and open receivers were dropping passes, Denver was moving up and down the field. 
There was a halfback pass to Elway, the first reception by a quarterback in Super bowl his­tory; a quarterback draw, shovel passes and runs when Washington was looking for the pass. 
But the Broncos couldn't finish off what they started. 
Their second drive stalled at the Washington 7 and resulted in a field goal, their third was thwarted when Alvin Walton, the strong safety who had 2 lt2 sacks, dropped Elway for an 18­yard loss, pushing the Broncos out of field goal range. 
After Washington went 1-2-3­punt on its first series, Elway went boom -and it was 7-0 Broncos just 1: 57 into the game. 
It was the simplest of pat­terns, Nattiel on a fly, streak­ing right by Barry Wilburn, who later had two intercep­tions. Nattie! caught the ball in stride at the 7 and fell over the goal line as Wilburn tackled him too late. 
It was the earliest touchdown in Super Bowl history, 3:39 ear­lier than the previous mark, when Dallas scored against Pittsburgh 12 years ago, 4:36 into the game. 
The Redskins got one first down on the next series, but Steve Cox had to punt again and back came the Broncos on a 61-yard drive on which Elway did everything pass, run and catch, the latter a 23-yardreception from running back 
Steve Sewell' to Whom he had 
handed off. But Elway Was thrown for a 
1-yard lOSS On a third-dOWn quarterback draw and the Broncos had to settle for 
Karlis' 24-yard field goal that made it 10-0, 5:51 intO the game  Washington continued to 
Start in bad field pOSitiOn -itS first four possessions began in­side its 20 and it fifth began at the 20. 

The Redskins were also kil-l 
ling themselves ·-Clark, Sanders and Kelvin Bryant all dropped passes in the first quarter and a holding call on 
Super Bowl," Williams said. "I just want to be the quarterback of the Washington Redskins." 
Washington Coach Joe Gibbs echoed those feelings. 
"Hopefully, we're at the point now where most people were looking at players, not colors anymore." 
Williams wiped out any ra­cial considerations with a record-breaking performance that matched or broke marks established by three of the greatest Super Bowl quarter­backs in history. 
The 340 yards broke the record of 331 set by San Fran­cisco's Joe Montana in 1985. 
Don Warren erased a 25-yard run by Smith. 
Finally, they did something right, starting the second per­iod the way the Broncos started the first. 
Two plays later, Smith broke through a huge hole off right tackle and raced by Tony Lilly on his 58-yard TD romp, the first score of his pro career. That made it 21-10 with 6: 27left in the half. 
Then, 2 lt2 minutes later, it was Williams again to Sanders, who went in motion to the left, cut diagonally across the field, and caught the ball all alone at the five for TD no. 4. 
No. 5, the 8-yard pass to Didier, came after Wilburn picked off an Elway pass at his own 21. Seven plays later, on third and 4, Williams lofted it softly to his tight end in the cor­ner to tie the TD pass record and shatter yet another record points in a quarter in any playoff game. 
The Redskins scored the only 
TD of the second half on 
Smith's 4-yard run early in the 
fourth quarter to break the 
touchdown record set by 
several teams, including the 
Giants against the Broncos last 
year and the Bears against 
New England in their 46-10 win 
two years ago. 
On their first offensive play of the quarter, Williams, who missed two plays on the previ­ous series when he slipped and suffered a hyperflexed left knee, hit Sanders on an 80-yard touchdown play to cut it to 10-7. 

plosion -tied the record of Pit­tsburgh's Terry Bradshaw in 1979. 
And Williams touched off the Washington powder keg with an 80-yard touchdown pass, tying the record for longest pass set by the Los Angeles Raiders' Jim Plunkett in 1981. 
Between them, Bradshaw, Montana and Plunkett own eight Super Bowl rings. 
Ironically, Williams got rol­ling after leaving the game with an injured left knee near the end of the first quarter. He was replaced for two plays by Jay Schroeder.

Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO -It was Doug Williams' dream pass, Ricky Sanders' fantasy catch, a per­fectly thrown ball caught in stride and a breakaway run for an 80-yard touchdown. 
It came with stunning, unex­pected suddenness, just 53 seconds into the second quar­ter, and was the opening salvo in the most ferocious one­period attack in Super Bowl history. 
If there was a single play, a single moment that presaged Washington's 42-10 victory Sun­day over Denver, it was that simple, elegant pass from Wil­liams to Sanders at a time when the Redskins were strug­gling. 
Only moments before, Wash­ington seemed doomed. The Redskins trailed 10-0 and Wil­liams lay on the turf clutching a painfully strained left knee. 
He had gone back to pass and hyperflexed his knee, bending it backward in a way it's not

the pain, I was going back in." 
Williams struggled through a tough first quarter as Denver jumped into a 10-0 lead. 
"We were not getting a lot of field position in the first quar­ter," Williams said. "There was some early drops and they were blitzing early. But I knew we could come back." 
Williams remembered that the Redskins had fallen behind 14-0 against Chicago in the first round of the playoffs and recovered to win 21-17. 
"I was confident," he said. "We knew things would even­tually go our way, just like in Chicago, and they did." 
gone to other Redskins, includ­ing running back Tim Smith, who set a Super Bowl record with 204 yards rushing. 
"It could easily have gone to Tim or Ricky .Sanders," an­other record-setter with 193 re­ceiving yards. 
"That's the type of team we are," Williams said. 
Williams said he thought that the Redskins defense made a major contribution by holding Denver to a field goal when the Broncos, leading 7-0, were in position to take a two­touchdown lead in the first per­iod. 

80-yard TD pass turns game around 
uesigned to go. He crumplea to the ground for a 10-yard loss on the Redskins' 25 while the hearts of Washington fans sank. 
The Denver fans had been having their way all game, cheering wildly from the mo­ment of John Elway's 56-yard touchdown pass the first time he held the ball. Washington fans sat quietly with little to cheer the entire first quarter. 
After a few minutes on the turf, Williams got up slowly and jogged off to show he wasn't seriously hurt. Jay Schroeder, who hadn't played in a month, came in with the Redskins facing second-and-20 on the 25. 
Denver greeted Schroeder with a blitz and the former Pro Bowl quarterback went down immediately from a sack by Karl Mecklenburg. The Redskins were marching back­ward with alarming speed. 
It all changed, though, within a couple of minutes. After an exchange of punts, Washington took over on their 20. Williams returned to the game with a play that called for Sanders to sprint straight out down the right sideline against corner­back Mark Haynes. 
Williams took the snap, stepped back a few paces and threw a hard spiral that Sanders snared on the run with outstretched hands on Wash­ington's 48. 
From there, it was no more than a foot race.

Associated P'ress 
The winning streaks are over for Kansas and Purdue, but the victories keep coming for Brig­ham Young. 
Kansas State ended Kansas' 55-game home-court winning streak Saturday, while Indiana halted second-ranked Purdue's 16-game victory string. No. 7 BYU remained the nation's only major undefeated team, improving its record to 15-0 with a victory over Air Force. 
Mitch Richmond scored 35 points as Kansas State beat Kansas 72-61 at Lawrence. It was the Jayhawks' first home loss since Feb. 22, 1984, when they were beaten by Okla­homa. 
"We've had some unbeliev­able victories in that streak," Kansas Coach Larry Brown said. "It's time to start over." 
Senior Dean Garrett scored a career-high 31 points, includ­ing the winning basket with five seconds left, as Indiana downed Purdue 82-79 at Bloomington. Purdue entered the game with the longest major-college winning streak in the country. 
At Provo, Utah, Michael Smith scored 23 points as Brig­ham Young defeated Air Force 95-75. All five BYU starters scored at least 14 points. 
"I like everything about BYU," Air Force Coach Reggie Minton said. "Their inside guys score and get the writeups, but it's the guards that do the things needed to win and so far nobody's beaten them." 
In other Top Twenty games Saturday, top-ranked Arizona beat No. 13 Illinois 78-70; No.3 North Carolina edged Georgia Tech 73-71; No. 4 Nevada-Las Vegas beat Pacific 92-67; No. 10 Oklahoma beat No. 12 Iowa State 96-91; No. 11 Pittsburgh defeated Boston College 73-67, and Vanderbilt beat No. 14 Florida 92-65.

On Sunday, No. 6 Temple downed Rhode Island 77-70, No. 17 Syracuse routed No. 8 Mic­higan 89-71, and No.9 Kentucky beat Notre Dame 78-69. No. 6 Duke did not play over the weekend. 
Arizona 78, Illinois 70 
Tom Tolbert scored 20 points as Arizona improved its record to 20-1.

But Fredrick was far from satisfied. A mistake in his friendly rivalry with Chapm.an and his team's loss stuck out' when he went over.the game. 
"He beat me pretty good," . said the Cincinnati, Ohio, na­tive. "He curled around the screen and I should have cut him off but I lost him.

this team. After we've been 
scored upon, we're not gloomy 
for long," said Sc'-~afer. "It's 
like 'Okay, so they scored. Now 
on to the face-off.' I like that." 
While Kent State stayed 

fairly close on Friday, the Sat­
urday game turned into a full­
fledged rout. 
Notre Dame had the game all 

but wrapped up by the end of 
the first period. The Irish once 
again blitzed Kent State in that 
period's closing minutes, 
scoring three times in the last 
five minutes to give Notre 
Dame a 5-1 lead. 
Mike McNeill, Hanzel, Her­

ber, Guay and Kuehl scored for 
the Irish in the first period. The 
Kent State offense, which had 
scored 11 goals in two ties with 
Notre Dame on Nov. 6-7, could 
not even come close to keeping 
pace with the Irish this 
weekend. 
Notre Dame held the Flashes 

to five goals in two games. Kent 
State junior Kirk Aldridge, who 
had 37 goals and 30 assists in 
30 games going into this 
weekend, was held to one goal 
and one assist. 
"Our goal this whole season 

was to minimize our goals­
against to under three (per 
game)," said Schafer, "and 
those five-goal weekends al­
ways help. 
After taking a breather in a 

scoreless second period, the 
Notre Dame offense, averag­
ing over six goals per game, 
went back to work. Rob 
Bankoske started the Notre 
Dame spurt with his second 
goal of the season, coming less 
then two minutes into the third 
period. After that, Kuehl 
simply overpowered an out­
manned Kent State defense, 
scoring two goals within 61 
seconds to give the Irish a 7-1 
advantage. 
Aldridge scored his lone goal 

of the weekend with 15:14 left 
in the game, then the Kent 
State massacre continued. 
Notre Dame scored three 

goals in the last minutes to win 
11-2. Bilton scored first, then 
Kuehl scored his fourth goal of 
the evening to make it 10-2. The 
final goal came from Frank 
O'Brien with just 25 seconds 
left in the game. 
One of the keys to Saturday's 

victory was Notre Dame's suc­
cess on the power play. The 
Irish had converted on barely 
30 percent of their power plays 
going into this weekend, but on 
Saturday Notre Dame scored 
four times in seven man­
advantage situations. 
"We spent some time on the 

power play this week," said Schafer. "The keys to a suc­cessful power play are being able to move the puck quickly, making accurate passes and shots coming right off the pass. At times this season, we've been guilty of killing our own power play by passing, pass­ing, passing and never shoot­ing." 
The Irish next face Air Force at the JACC on Friday and Sat­urday. Both games will start at 7:30p.m,

SAN DIEGO -Doug Wil­liams, Timmy Smith and Ricky Sanders ripped apart the Den­ver defense with a record 35­point, 356-yard second quarter as the Washington Redskins won the Super Bowl by routing the Denver Broncos 42-10 and shutting down John Elway. 
Washington spotted Denver a 10-0 lead, then came from be­hind for the seventh time in 14 wins this year to give the NFC its fourth straight lopsided vic­tory in the NFL's champion­ship game.

ND hockey pushes win streak to 10 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
Before the series it was ex­pected that the Kent State hockey team would have a hard time stopping the potent Notre Dame offense this past weekend at the Joyce ACC. 
It did. 

But the Golden Flashes, who averaged over five goals a game going into this weekend, might have figured that their own high-powered scoring at­tack would produce two close games. 
It didn't. 

Notre Dame combined a furious scoring attack and a solid defense to sweep Kent State, 6-3 and 11-2, in an Amer­ican Collegiate Hockey Associ­ation series. The sweep gave the Irish a school-record 10 con­secutive wins, 18 wins in their last 19 games, a conference record of 5-1-2 and an overall record of 19-2-2·. Kent State (0­6-2, 10-19-3), lost its fourth straight, and kept its stranglehold on last place in the ACHA. 
"I know it's getting old to say this, but our guys just worked very hard," said first-year Irish coach Ric Schafer. "We're on a roll, and they're on a roll the other way." 
Kevin Harkonen scored less than four minutes into Friday's game to give Kent State an early lead. It was the only lead the Flashes would see all weekend. 
The Flashes dominated the first period, outshooting the Irish 9-6, but goals in the last 

·.... 
eight minutes by Bruce Guay, Tim Kuehl and Matt Hanzel gave Notre Dame a 3-1lead. 
Kent State closed the gap to 3-2 when Pete Calleri scored 
2:39 into the second period. Brian Montgomery answered 10 seconds later with a goal, and the Irish led 4-2. After an­other Irish goal by Bob Herber, Kent State's Mark Esposito made the score 5-3. But the Irish answered again, with Tom Smith finding the nets just 16 seconds later to close the scoring at 6-3.
