Barkett wins SBP run-off election 
HPC chairman collects 52.3% 
of votes in race with Mooney 
,by T.C. Treanor 
John Barkett rode a huge plurality in his home hall of Morrissey to win a narrow victory over off-campus Senator Don Mooney in last night's Student Body Presidential run-off election. 
Barkett, a junior from Miami Florida, won by two hundred fifteen votes., one hundred seventy-four of which came from Morrissey. The runoff was the second in Notre Dame Student Body Presidential history. 
Mooney made several important gains since last Thursday's election, when he garnered only twenty-seven percent of thz vote total. He took Flanner, Grace, Stanford, and Zahm halls. all of Which Barkett won Thursday., and improved his margins in Alumni, Dillon, Farley, Howard and off-campus. Mooney also took Holy Cross, aithough his margin decreased since last Thursday. 
Barkett took every other on-campus hall, piling up big margins in Badin, Fisher Pangborn, and Walsh as well a~ Morrissey. The closest count was in Flanner where Mooney beat the HPC chairman by a single vote. 
Student Body President Dave Krashna announced the vote to a crowd of about fifty last night in LaFortune at approximately eleven thirty last night. Thz results were held up for a time while allegations of voter fraV9. in Fisher'and Walsh halls were investigated and dismissed. 
Mooney and his running mate Dan Sherry appeared at LaFortune shortly after the election to offer their congratulations to the winning pair. In a statement Mooney contended that "J~hn and Orlando will be able to do things that Dan and I perhaps didn'~ want to do." 
Mooney also thanked his supporters, and commented that "two thousand votes represented a pretty impressive com­mitment. "When asked about his future plans, Mooney promised to "do some pretty freaky things next year," but not in student government. 
Barkett appeared at about eleven thirty and issued a statement to the Observer. "I want to thank everyone for their help and time and belief in Orlando and me. It was a team effort," Barkett continued,"run by a great c3of)tain in Bob Weaver." 

SBP candidate Dori Mooney Barkett also had praise for the two men he defeated. "I congratulate Don and Dan anf Jack (campaign manager Candon) on running a great campaign and I hope the com­

"Orlando and I are looking forward to an exciting year," Barkett promised and he closed his remarks by ~aying '' ...Thanks to everyone agam. We will not let you down." · 
Vice-president-elect Orlando R?driguez a ju~ior ~rom Miramer, Puerto Rico, said he had praise for his opponents. "Don and Dan ran fine cam­paigns," he said. "I am very happy that we won, and very happy that the student body has placed this faith in me."

Community Relations Commissioner arranges for student-police conference 
Jack Candon, Community Relations Commissioner on the Student Body Cabinet has arranged for a Police Conference this Thursday Friday and Saturday. 
This conference serves a twofold purpose. First :through lectures and informal discussions police from South Bend, thz rest of the county and perhaps some of the security staff from thz campus will attempt to rij the Notre Dame student of common misconceptions concerning the policeman's role in society. 
Also, Candon feels the college student is ' "unfairly stereotyped", and he feels that these discussions will help the police officers see the students more as individuals. 
Candon stated thwt he was "very disappointed" with the response he has gotten from the halls. Each of the Hall Presidents was sent a letter concerning this conference, and only five halls have replied. 
Candon stressed thwt if any of the Hall Presidents wished to contact him concerning this, they were to call the student govern­ment office as quickly as possible 
and he would get in touch with them. 
Thursday, March fourth, from 
1:00 to 3:00p.m. Philip Facenda thz Vice-president of the Generai Council of Notre Dame will give the opening address in the Library Auditorium. 
Friday, from 1:30 to 3:00p.m., Renault Robinson, thz president of the Chicago Mro-American police society, will speak in the Library Auditorium. 
On Saturday from 4:00 to 6:00

Provost proposes 
COlflplete merger 
ofND and SMC 
by Mike Nevins 
The Rev. James T. Burtchaell released his coeducation proposal calling for "a complete incorporation of St. Mary's College into the University of Notre Dame." 
This proposaJ,copies of which were circulated to the faculties and staffs of both schools, will be considered at the upcoming trustees meeting in Key "Biscayn~ Florida; March 19-21. 
Burtchaell opened his proposal by calling the situation "amicable and optimistic. . .yet frustrated by recurring am­biguities." As a first example of this Burtchaell cited the fact that St. Mary's not Notre Dame needs the merger, but it is St. Mary's that is hesitant. 
At the same time he outlined the crisis for St. Mary's if Notre Dame were to go independently co-ed. While pointing out the "fact that Notre Dame and St. Mary's are nowise equals" he called for closer cooperation between the schools. 
The financial issue was seen as critical by Burtchaell. He claimed that Notre Dame is comfortable financially but "St. Mary's could be bankrupted by a few chaotic deficit years." Also it was noted that co-exchange costs Notre Dame over a quarter of a mi1lion dollars each year in the way of shared services and facilities. This, according to Burtchaell, cannot be continued unless St. Mary's is incorporated into Notre Dame. 
Another stumbling block cited is the diverse motivation in­volved. Burtchaell sees the students placing high priority on "shared non-academic facilities for dining and socializing." Meanwhile, administrators faculty and alumni emphasize "academic and institutional unity." The third major segment is the Holy Cross Sisters, whose new position wuould be "am­biguous." 
The final problem discussed is the identity of St. Mary's college. While claiming that "at Notre Dame we value our un­dergraduate program, par­ticularly in the College of arts and letters, precisely for its humanistic and liberalizing orientation", Burtchaell asserts that the only reasons for keeping St. Mary's College are "political and unwise." 
Burtchaell's solutions call for complete merger by the summer of 1972 emphasizing that "Coeducation is not an aption; it is a necessity for survival." 
Socially, Burtchaell. called for juxtaposing halls, not co-ed dorms, for men and women, with the possibilty of a unified food service system. The ultimate goal would be a two -to -one ratio. 
He further claimed that the merger of all parallel academic departments and administrative functions while, issuing all

Last night the St. Mary's Student Affairs Committee unanimously endorsed a letter to sophomore parents concerning the recent tuition hike and the administrative restructuring of thz college. 
By endorsing the statement, the committee felt that they could best show their disagreement · with remarks made by Sister Alma, acting president, at the Presiden_tial banquet during sophomore parents' weekend. 
At the banqust, the acting president indicated lthat the students, "a minority, bUt a thoughtless and articulate minority" might have been used by thz faculty in an attempt to dispute the administrative changes. 
In the meeting, however, Jean Gorman, chairman, clarified Sister's remarks with the statement, "The students were asked ifthey wanted the letters to be sent and thzy voted by sixty eight per cent to send the letters. This is not a minority. They weren't used by anyone." 
LeMans Hall president Margaret Conwell, a junior, suggested that other class presidents or hall presidents draft similar letters to inform parents on recent occurrences at 
the school. Mrs Josephine 
Barallat, Spanish instructo!, also 
felt that the letter should be 
circulated among the faculty. 
Laura Bayer, a sophomore and 
Regina Hall president, further 
explained the sophomore action. 
''Those who voted agsindx yhr 
lryyrt ertr noy nrvrddstily op­. posed to the content of the letter. They were against sending it to the parents prior to Sophomore 
Parents Weekend," she said. 
The committee members also 
investigated the AAUP censure 
at the meeting because their 
unqualified endorsement of the 
Sophomoreletter also includes an 
endorsement of the censure. 
Miss Gorman read 

correspondence between Sr. 
Alma and Sr. Franzita Kane, 
campus AAUP president, which 
not only explained the recent 
administrative chunges;but also 
explainsd some new ones in­
volving the elimination of the 
physical education department. 
''The chairman of the education department is very upset about the changes," revealed Dr. Thomas Conway, history instructor. ''Although the change was due to student apathy, it is a loss of a resource because the only dancing classes on either campus were part of the

Bomb racks out of the way Capital bathroom 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -'A powerful bomb exploded in an out of the way rest room in the U.S. Capitol early yesterday causing damages estimated at ''upwards of $300,000" and triggering speculation it was an "inside job." 
The 1z:30 a.m. EST blast, which caused no injuries, came 30 minutes after an anonymous telephone caller warned that the bomb would be detonated to protest U.S. support of South Vietnamese military operations inside Laos. 
One congressman said a "tremendous amount of ex­plosives" was involved in the bomb that went off immediately adjacent to the west wall of the Capitol. Built wometime between 1793 and 1800, some authorities have expressed fear that the sandstone wall would soon topple from its own weight unless reinforced or replaced. 
The wall remained intact. Capitol Architect George M. White estimated the damage at about $300,000 and said a daylong investigation produced no evidence that the blast further damaged the historic west front. 
An FBI spokesman said teams of fingerprint and bomb experts, still working at the site, had been unable to find any clues. He said that almost anybody could manufacture a bomb now with all the detailed literature available on the subject. 
Capitol police reported receiving two telephone calls-one from Chicago and the other from Spokane-inquiring about the extent of the damage before the story of the bombing was carried in news accounts. 
Capt. L. H. Ballard of the Capitol police said the calls were received within about one hour of the explosion, but the first news accounts were not until about 3:30a.m. EST, or two hours after the explosion. 
Asked if he inferred that police had knowledge of a conspiracy, or that persons around the country had prior knowledge of the explosion, Ballard replied, "No, but they knew." 
Senate leaders, noting that the explosion occurred in an un­marked men's rest room nor­mally used only by senators, and taking into account that the blast occurred at a time when the building is almost deserted, expressed belief that the bomb was planted by a person familiar with the workings of the Senate side of the Capitol. 
President Nixon called the bombing "a shocking act of violence which will outrage all Americans." But he was em­phatic that the bombing would not frighten the government into locking the American people out of federal buildinlls. 
.. sen. George S. McGovern, 

(D) S.D., the only announced 1972 presidential candidate, called the act "barbaric," but blamed it on "our Vietnam madness." 
House Democratic Leader Hale Boggs of Louisiana, reporting on an early investigation, said it had been determined the explosion resulted from "a very large amount of very powerful explosives-a tremendous amount of explosives." There was no immediate dollar estimate of damage. 
The explosion demolished the 12 by 12 foot men's room, and seriously damaged an adjacent barber shop. It also damaged a senators' dining room situated across the hall and caused some damage to several small offices nearby, including some on the floor above. 
A ground floor room 
The men's room, unmarked and normally used by senators, is on the ground floor of the Senate side of the Capitol-the north side­and lies immediately adjacent to the controversial west wall. 
Some critics have proposed that the wall be torn down as structurally unsafe. But the Monday explosion did not collapse the wall, even though it occurred at one of its most vulnerable spots. 
Capitol Police Chief James Powell reported what "appeared to be a serious crack in the wall," but noted it was not known whether it was a new crack or an

Congratulations 
The Observer wishes to extend its sincere congratulations to Student Body President-elect John Barkett for his victory in yesterday's election. At the same time we would like also to congratulate Don Mooney for his valiant effort to capture the post. 
The campaign, unlike some in the past, was relatively clean. There were instances of signs being ripped down and posters impugning thz motives of those supporting one can­didate or the other, but on the whole it was a good campaign. 
It has been the custom in the past for the losing candidate and most of his workers to shut themselves off entirely from student government. We hope that this will not be the case this year, as there were fine people in the Mooney camp who have valuable skills to offer. 
As for the defeated candidate himself, we trush :.that the Barkett administrationwill offer him a post which will enable him to utilize his talents to the maximum if he chooses to accept it. ' 
The swift and smooth implementation of coeducation will be the greatest task to face the Barkett administration when it takes over after spring vacation. By then the trustees will their decision on the course of action that the two institutions will follow in the next few years. 
What student government can do is to implement as many social changes as possible to bring the two student bodies closer together. Coed dining nights, low cost concerts and other things can be done easily and will help. 
The merger of the two student governments can also be affected quickly. Though Kathy Barlowe and Missy Underman ran with Don Mooney and Dan Sherry thzy stated several times that they could work with any of the candidates. Based on the experience of joining the two academic commissions for this year there should be no great problems in the way of merger. The process though, by necessity, will be longer since thz drafting of a new conf­titution must be carried out. 
Depending on what the trustees decide about thz Flannsr coed proposal, the University will face a housing shortage to a greater or lesser degree this April. The Barkett ad­ministratiQn must work in close coordination with the Hall Presidents and the office of 
studenr Housing to relieve this problem as much as possible. The best idea would be to shift as many freshmen as possible to those halls which will have available spaces and away from thoye who are short on rooms. A great effort must be made to protect as many residents as possible from being bumped out of their hall. 
This year some efforts were made to move Student Union's emphasis away from mass events towards smaller affairs. The Over the Hill Concerts and the ones held in Stepan Center are examples of this. In appointing a Student Union Director thz Barkett ad­ministration should pick a man whose philosophy coincides with thz concept of smaller and mord personal events. Therealso should be greater cooperation with the halls on some events. The Union when requested could provide information and help for hall social commissions and academic commissions. 
We hope that there will be no great problems in the transition period because of political friction between te Krash and Barkett groups. Both men are smart enough we trust to avoid any unnecessary disputes and to effect a smooth and orderly transferal of powzr. 
We wish Mr. Barkett and his people a most fruitful and successful year and we are sure he 
will justify the student body's faith in him through his actions.

Editor: 
In your editorial comments on William Ruckelshaus's speech (Observer, February 12), you agree with him that we must be willing to pay higher prices for goods if we expect industry to pay for pollution control. This strikes me as a singularly short­sighted view. Ruckelshaus says that "people are going to have to get used to these kinds of ex­penses if they are serious about cleaning up our environment." What is that but the same exploi­tative, irresponsible mentality that countenanced pollution in the first place? What is that but the arrogance of "I can have anything I want as long as I can pay for it"? The real problem lies much deeper than paying for a gigantic clean-up, though we need that too. 
With 6% of the world's popu­lation, the United &ates already uses 60% of the world's con­sumable resources. The scandal of such gross inequity aside, it is a fact that consuming these re­sources produces enormous amounts of waste matter. Per­haps what we must accept is not that we must pay more, but that we must use less. Perhaps the current ecological crisis demands noihing less revolutionary than that we Americans lower our famed standard of living. If we are really serious about cleaning up our environment, I suggest that we can no longer simply lay out a little more cash and then go right on consuming with the same unbounded enthusiasm for more and newer (and maybe not ever better) THINGS. We are clearly not serious unless and until we, society, the people, demand fewer cubic inches in our engines, fewer and smaller cars in our garages, fewer un­ne.cessary luxuries like air­conditioning and SST planes, 
fewer pre-pac aged convenience 
foods, fewer TV's and other appliances that have to be traded in frequently because they be­come obsolescent so fast fewer machines, in short, pr~ducing fewer things. The ~reasure of our willingness to give up some of our own status and comfort is the true measure of our concern ahout the environment. It might also have something to do with out Christianity.

Having lived in Dillon for three years I feel obliged to add a footnote to your "living con­ditions" section in the analyses of the Halls. 
Two years ago, despite desperate living conditions, there was a spirit of cooperation.and mutual respect witin the hall. Last year Dillon was blessed wth renovation that reduced thz number of resident¥ significantly. However this potentially positive factor was negated by the institution of the "Vikings". Under the guise of increasing spirit this group has turned the atmosphere of Dillon

Editor: 
Today, Ash Wednesday, the 6th issue of ictus prompts me to question thz ND-8MC campus. So far I have read, word for word, every article up to "The Notre Dame Woman". 
Three years teaching at SMC, 
three years investment in both 
ND and SMC students, three 
years experience with several 
splendid young men-students 
from every class level, prepared 
me to write this open letter. 
My initial reaction to ictus ­
attesting surely to the ef­
fectiveness of layout, art and 
general format -was shock. My 
response is a quiet readiness to 
pinpoint what I see as an SOS. 
l(There appears to be a 
tremendous void, an emptiness, 
that seeks to be filled through 
sex. Sex appears to be a glorified 
facet of campus culture that has 
literally over-saturated itself. It 
appears further that ND men-if 
the ictus articles have any 
valididty-have fallen prey to 
"conditioning" rather than 
coming to grips with manhood. 
2)The moody self-
consciousness and dreamy 
preoccupation with innocent 
discoveries appropriate to 
childhood are now seen anew as 
tantalizing insights (?). Can you 
not recognize them for what they 
are and move on to deeper un­
derstanding of the human con­
dition? Surely, by now, most of 
you have had a basic course in 
developmental psych.? 
3(There stands revealed a 
subtle destruction of both self and 
other, a form of sel-hate, 
emanating perhaps from 
repressed hostility? Can you not 
accept drives, instincts, and 
passions as the raw materials of 
human-ness in both man and 
woman? Is your expose an SOS 
(?), or a covert wish to be ad­
mired for your sophistication? 
4 (The evident fruits of all this: 
elements of guilt; "confession" 
to your peers, almost a com­
pulsion; bewilderment and 
confusion with your emerging 
adulthood; Emotional scarring; 
and a weary refusal of any 
responsibility to self or other. 
5(The publication of the content 
itself, under the auspices of a 
study of non-violence, is clearly 

identified as of Notre Dame. Is 
this not an attempt to destroy 

ND, supposedly cutting your 
umbilical cord from a womb that 
has ceased to nourish you? Or 
could it again be a plea for ND to 

be truly ND with all the virility of 
its rich heritage ? 

Are the authors testing to see 
how far they can go (as a child)? 

Are they ridiculing chastity and 
those who value it? Or are they 

again revaling a cry-from-the­
depths for help? 

The splendid young men I came 
to know in several classes belie 
the authenticity of the ictus 
connent. 

To stand idly by in the face of 
such content would beliemy own 
sense of responsibility to Truth 
and Love. 

Perhaps ictus should provide 
equal space anf artistic effort for 
an affirmation of Noore Dame's 

purposeful milieu so the 
tremendous void can become 
filled with strong truths and 
gentle wisdom. 
Sincerely, 
Ruth Thome

An Open Letter to Anita 
Mr. Raymond Fleming is an instructor 1968 at St. Mary's and the racist attitudes in the Department of Modern Languages of the nuns and other administrators of the at Notre Dame. He is a 1967 graduate of college in 1970 is that the tone is no longer Notre Dame. Mr. Fleming was a Fulbright subdued.) Father McGrath who was then scholar to Italy and a Woodrow Wilson President ofSt. Mary's, w;s continuously Fellow at Harvard University. He did his apologizing to both students and faculty of graduate work at the University of Upward Bound for the almost daily racial Florence and at Harvard. The following is slurs of the nuns. Father McGrath was one a letter he wrote to one of his ex-students of of the few administrators to en-an Upward Bound program. thusiastically support the presence of the

good nuns, perhaps I should go back in time about two and one-half years and ~ork my wa_y to the present. From what I ve learned m my many lengthy talks with black students and faculty around here I can assure you that my experiences have been the rule rather than the exception. 
I was. ea~ing dinner at St. Mary's when a nun satd m a somewhat subdued tone, "There are just too many niggers on our campus this summer." I suppose that it was my own naivete that causes me to wince at the words of good Sister of the c.o~gregation of the Holy Cros~. She was s~ttn~g at the table nex~ to mme in the dmnmg hall at St. Marys College. It was the summer of 1969 and the "niggers" ~e!e the Upward Bound girls who were hvmg on campus. I was teaching in the Upward Bound program and livingon the St. Mary's Campus. During the six weeks and t~ree days that I lived on the St. Mary. s campus not mo:e than two con­secubv~~ days p3:ssed Without one of the good Sisters lettmg the black people on campus know how much they wished that we " ... had stayed in Africa."

Milt lones 
be 4Q-50 black students admitted to st. Mary's College in 1970. I knew that I could trust Father McGrath to keep his word. It had been Father McGrath who had op­posed the racists at st. Mary's in order to allow black girls from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend the college. One minor functionary of the college has ad­mitted that some of last year's black freshmen were " ... accepted over the objection of the academic committee" and were only admitted by " ... order of Father McGrath signed by Father Downes." Father McGrath had helped to establish one of the most imaginative and effective programs for giving minority students a real opportunity to succeed in college, namely, the Office for Inter-Cultural Development. He supported the idea that no minority student from a disadvantaged background accepted by st. Mary's should have to work at an outside job during her freshman year. He also said that in order to further insure the minority student's integration into college life all incoming minority freshmen who wished to live on campus would be able to do so. Father McGrath saw t it that the Office of Inter-Cultural Development was funded with $14,000 to help achieve these goals. Out of these funds such programs as tutoring and 
recrUitment of more mmor1ty students were also to be supported. Instead of the usual red tape .that one usually finds in a program of this type, the program was rather simple: Father McGrath appointed Mr. Lem Joyner of St. Mary's Art Depa.rtment, ~very. dedicated black man, to direct this Office of Inter-Cultural Development and to make the day-to-day decisions concerning the welfare of the minority students. Wehnever the minority student .had a pr?blem, be it financial, academic! or emotional she could g~ to~· Joyn~r, h1m~elf a member of a mmor1ty, and fmd a friend ready to help her. Fa~er McGrath gave Mr. Joyner the special position of Assistant.to the President. . 
Father McGrath died last June, and It has not taken the bigots l?ng to e~asculate the. programs and repudiate the Ideals for which hestood. Instead of the 40-50. black students F3;ther McGra~ had proJected, Sr. Raphaehta has seen f1t to accept only a few black students (there are seven black students in this year's freshman class(. Sr. Raphaelita, who handles ad~issions, feels that the 24 black students m St. Mary's enrollment of 1,711 are too many. She has stated that the black girls " ... seemed to get along much better when there weren't so many·" Perhaps. Rap, .as the ~lack students call her, w1ll achieve her Ideal number of black students next year as all but eight of this year's black students plan to transfer to other more humane colleges next year. 
As you ~an i~agine, the .thought of a black m~':l s havu~g as much mdependence and dectswn makmg power as Mr. Joyner had under Fa_ther McGrath was too much for the go~d sisters to swallow, so on July 1 of 1970, JUSt a few weeks after Father McGrath's death, Sr. Alma Peter, who is now Acting President of St. Mary's, wrote to Mr. Joyner to sa~, "Dear Mr. Jorner, I pre~ume you re~hze ~hat the btle of As~tstant to President IS a pe.rsonal ap­pomtment an~ ceases Jo exist at the chang~ of presidency." Instead of having the. mmor_ItY .stude~ts concentrating on th~1r studies m thetr freshman year as they. ~id under Father McGrath's prestde~cy, St. Mary's has decided that these girls should now saddle themselves 
with additional loans. Mr. Lindower, St. Mary's Business Manager, tells the black students that they will appreciate their education more if they have to take out these additional loans. Of course, St. Mary's still tries to give thE: impression that it is digging deeply into its own resources to support these "unfortunate" minority students. They neglect to point out that when they "give" a girl $2,250 in financial aid, $1,000 of this is an O.E.O. grant, $1,000 a government loan, and $250 comes_ from St. Mary's College. 
The Budget Committee decided that the budget for the Office of Intercultural Development should be cut by eighty per cent. When Mr. Joyner protested this reduction, Mr. Lindower suggested that Mr. Joyner should resign (Anita, this is what is known as "the squeeze play" at the university level). Actually, Anita, if you have been engaged in anything as sub­versive or "militant" as reading the poetry of Leroi Jones, then you probably could not be admitted to St. Mary's anyway. Sr. Raphaelita calls the prin­cipals of thz high schools to find out if the black girls who apply are "militant." Unlike last year when all the black fresh­men who wishsd to reside on campus could do so, this year it has been decided that those black students accepted from the South Bend -area would become day students. This seems to be another one of Sr. Alma's "exciting new ideas" for helping the incoming minority students to make the transition into the Chrisitan community of St. Mary's College (there are many other inheresting.~ and educational experiences I have to relate to you about St. Mary's College, but i'll fill you in·on the details in my next letter). If by chace you should ever visit St. Mary's you would understand that E. E. Cum­mings was really talking abojt many of the nuns at St. Mary's when he wrote 
The Cambridge ladies who live in fur­nished souls are unbeautiful and have comfortable minds.

"George Jackson's Letters from Prison" 
Christianity an evil of western society, and sates that Catholic schools, which he at­tended, give one-sided educations full of propaganda. Many people might deny this, but perhaps they should ask themselves a few questions. Should there be any need for minority recruitment at a Christian University if George Jackson's con­demnation of Western Christianity is not true. If Christianity is so understanding and kind, why is Notre Dame so blatantly racist? Why are there only 120 blacks at Notre Dame and 16 at SMC? Why do things such as the Dayton situation (where an alumnus had recruited 48 blacks, only to have the 48 hear nothing further from the university and to find himself ter­minated ( ( OCCUR? These things will keep on occurring until someone stands up against them. George Jackson is that kind of someone. We must be like him here at Notre Dame, and all over this stinkpot of a nation so that we can make things the way they should be. 
George Jackson's letters will make you think about the situation you are in. He will show you that all men should not care how long they live, but how they live, how well, how nobly. This review has only given you a small taste of Jackson. It is one man's reaction to the book. Everyone should read the book for themselves and draw their own conclusions. Perhaps then they won't be astounded when not if, the day of pan­revolution occurs. Perhaps then they can understand how a black man can feel oppressed in America and at Notre Dame. Perhaps then they will understand the implications behind a statement like that of Jonathon Jackson (George's 17 year old brother) at the San Rafael courthouse; "Alright, gentlemen, I'm taking over 

George Jackson, whom Panther leader Huey Newton calls "The greatest writer of us all,'' expounds the inner feelings of all black people in his book "The Prison Letters of George Jackson." 
Brother Jackson, who is in Soledad Prison, Salinas, California has gone through numerous prison setbacks. He was arrested for a $70 robbery in 1960, and has never been realeased. He agreed to confess in exchange for a light sentence. However when time came for sentencing, he was given 1 year to life imprisonment. Because of his pride, his refusal to be unjustly mistreated by his white im­prisoners, he has been denied parole every year. 
In his book, George Jackson tells of the evils of western society. He says "Their philoSophy concerning government and economics has an underlying tone of selfishness, possessiveness, and greediness because their character is 
made lllp of these things." Jackson also comments that "they cannot understand that from wXH according to his abilities, to each according to his needs is the only way men can live together without chaos." This is one of the most powerful in­dictments of this sick society to date. The system of economy is indeed based upon greed as can be witnessed in the large corporations of America which have long exploited the common worker. Their profits come from forcing little firms into consolidation and forcing blacks, im­migrants, and other workers, to choose either low wages or no wages. Yet this was allowed by its best friend, American government, which was busy exploiting young African and Asian countries. Jackson talks of this in one letter. Jackson mentions that America loans to African countries at high interest and for rights to exploit minerals and other natural resources. However, China loans to 
African nations without exploiting them because--to the Chinese, the Africans are their brothers. Looking upon a situation like this, with whom would a black man abviously identify, China or America? 
Every American black man is embodied in George Jackson. For even though we walk the streets free from physical bars and chains, we are just as imprisoned as Jackson is. Our economic limitations for the most part are known at birth. We must face a white authority who will decide when we are wrong or right; how in­telligent we are, what we will learn and other facets of our lives which that white authority cannot, because of its innate cultural difference, ever understand black people enough to judge properly. We are also like Jackson because, if we do not do what the white authority likes, we don.t "get ahead" in this world. George Jackson remained a black man, and as a con­sequence lost his chance, year after year, of ever gaining parole. 
Jackson addresses all blacks, actually, when he writes his father saying "You must stop giving yourself pain by feeling that you failed somewhere. You have not filed by history and events, and people over whom you had no control. ..you must gain some control!" This statement should be adhered to by blacks on every level, national, state, municipal, neighborhood, and university. Yes, there must be im­provements on all these levels. However, I would particularly like to comment on their need on the university level, and more specificaly at Notre Dame. 
Until blacks, and those whites who will open their eyes, stand up and demand what should already be in existence, no improvements on the university level will be made. George Jackson calls

Editor: 
Congratulations for having thocou;age to print your editorial which appeared in Monday's paper. Itis encouraging to see the observer take a stand on a vital issue such as this. It seems that it is about time that the students here realize that the respon­sibility for many of the defects present in the Notre Dame community are not entirely their fault. The apathy of the students is often criticized and the absence of a "true Christian community" is blamed on them. Both criticisms are justified yet it seems tht pressure from the Administrations of the kind Fr. .. Fr. Burtchaell is exerting makes attainment of these goals extremely difficult. 
I For one who purports to be a man, a Christian and a religious, his conduct is inexcusable. To me, it is tantamount hypocrisy to claim allegiance to Christian principle and then to deny to deny justice, mercy and forgiveness. Is it mere idealism to assume that one should 
practice these virtues if one preaches them? 
Someone, whether it be Fr. Burtchaell, Fr. Riehle, or any other administrative representative, is setting dangerous precedent and making dangeous assumptions. To assume before a trial that the accused students are already guilty is unthinkable. Am I wrong in recalling that one is innocent

to deny students who have been 
proven innocent to return to their 
community appraoaches the 
antitheses of all that these men 
purport to represent. I am per­
sonally indignant and ashamed to

conduct is being tolerated in an 
environment whkch should be a 
miniature example of a working 
Christian society. 
Perhaps these administrators have allowed duty to blind them to their humanity. If this is the case, let them resign. If mere accusation of a crime is to be judged as sufficient grounds for suspension then no one is safe since we are all subject to ac­cusation. 
I stand firmly with the ob­server in challenging Fr. Burt­chaell to publicly justify his action and would demand that he revoke his thoughtless decision immediately. Sincerely John Pau'I Duffy 
Fr. Burtchaell, again 
Editor: 
My response to the editorial 
entitled "Burtchaell and the drug suspensions" has come to include certain reflections on the nature of authority. Those reflections were stimulated not only by editorial but also by a sermon given by Fr. Burtchaell which I happened to hear. In the sermon, which concerned the definition of authority, such key words as "power" "responsibilitgy" and 
"authori·t'y" a d s h k ' 
, n uc ey con­
cepts as apply to those who "who compel,' as opposed to those who "coerce" were discussed. As I understood the Provost, there are those who hold positions of im­portance, positions in which they are "responsible for many," but who do not have true authority, that is, the ability to compel men, out of love or respect for the administrator and the good of his doctrines, to act. Good leaders must strive to attain such an ideal. To my way of thinking, the truly great leaders are not those

who are concerned with their responsibility for the many who are under them, not only because it is human to exaggerate the extent of one's powers, but also because those many are not actually so very affected by their leaders as those leaders may think, they will stumble along as always and who it is that governs them will n not make such a great deal of difference. The great leader, then, is more concerned with the individuals who come into his life, for however long or short a period oftime :~r for whatever reason. Tlwse who are weaker in r~wer than the one in authrotiJ must come to him with a .:.on of trust and hope that he will deal well with them. They are rather like a person standing 1 helpless and with his eyes closed before a more powerful man. If that man chooses to touch the ~ ~yes of the victim gently but with '· strength, then open them and let that man see his concern and his mercy and wisdom, then the man who has been .bus touched might be able to see with great clarity, the weaker having been helped '· not hurt by authority. However, if the hand of power chooses to slap, the clos~d eye~, all that _has been 
accomplished IS the ~urtmg of the weaker ~an causmg tears to come. to his eyes so th~t all_ he sees IS b~u~red an_d he IS e!lubt­tered.

as with the potential they have for bringing such diffreent consequences to certain in­dividuals. Obviously, the higher the position held,the greater is the potential for good or evil actions. 
The relation of all of this to the suspension of the four students is fairly plaikn. That all four of those suspended truly fell under the category of being "an im­minent danger to the University" is difficult to believe, the vast majority would certainly have gone along unscathed, so it is hard to comprehend that it was a true sense of responsibility that forced the action. The movw seems unsound, not only politically, for certainly it will not engender student admiration, but because it seems to show a tendency on the part of the Ad­ministrators to exercise brute power whee mercy would have been more apt. The detaikls of this case are not available so I cannot say anything conclusive regarding it specifically, however it would seem that the higher the position of authority may be, and particularly at a Christia university, the more the one wo holds it should force his actions to be flied with moderation, reflection, an­d,always mercy. These ae often the strongest elemens of thse who lead wll, and perhaps par­ticularly those who lead the young. Hopefully, these ideals will temper te future decisions of those who hold positions of authority here and hav much potential for exercising that

1By the author of Rally Round tht Flag, Boya ... Dohir(iilli~ ... rlr.l 
Don't let success get you down 
Once there was an upwardly mobile r,nan whom I will call Case­ment R. Glebe (not his real name). Even as an· undergraduate Mr. Glebe didn't fumble and dither and grope for the meaning of life like some lazy long-haired slobs I could name. He knew exactly what life was about. Life was working hard so you could get good grades and graduate with honors and find a swell job and get married and move to Westport and have three children like every other decent American. 
And that's precisely what Mr. Glebe did. He graduated magna, got a swell job in the advertising game, married a girl, whom I will call Mavis Davis (her real name), who was not only service-oriented and achievement-prone but also had a real nice build, and they bought a lovely home in \\restport with electric baseboard heating and within three years they had three fine sturdy little boys-Flopsy, Mopsy and Seymour. 
To his sons, Mr. Glebe was a loving but stern father. He raised them to believe in his own guiding values-ambition, self-denial and hard work-and the boys responded brilliantly. Flopsy, the oldest, finished high school as valedictorian and was accepted by Harvard. Mr. Glebe was, of course, very proud and happy. The following year Mopsy was also valedictorian and was also accepted by Harvard. Again Mr. Glebe was proud but, to be perfec·tly honest, not q1,1ite so happy, for now he had two sons in Harvard at the same time, w:1ich is something no man in the world can afford, not eYen an advertising man. 
I 
~~~~:-~~e&-~----~J_~--~ 
Then a horrible thought struck Mr. Glebe. "Good grief!" he eried 
one night to his wife Mavis (her real name). "Next year Seymour gets 
out of high school. If he makes Harvard too, I am ruined!" 
He ran at once to Seymour's room and found the industrious lad 
doing his homework in modern Sanskrit, urban entropy, ethnic alge­
bra and societal dysfunrtion. "Son, have you eYer thought of becom­
ing a moral degenerate?" said Mr. Glebe to Seymour. "Wouldn't you 
like to drop out, maybe have an identity crisis, wear beads, get busted 
in Amsterdam, stuff like that?" 
"That's rich, Dad," said Seymour, chuclding, and went on to 
graduate as Yaledictorian and thence off to HarYard. 
Poor Mr. Glebe! So distraught was he with financ·ial worries that 
one day his mind finally buckled and he made a disastrous error. One 
of his accounts at the advertising agency was Dullbrau BePr which, 
frankly, was just an ordinary, run-of-the-mill kind of beer. Still, Mr. 
Glebe had managed to think up this real catchy ad\·ertising slogan: 
Drink Dullbrau ... it's better than nothing 
Well sir, sales were not entirely what the Dullbrau people had been hoping for, so they insisted on a new slogan. And Mr. Glebe, the poor devil, his mind unhinged by fiscal problPms, made the above­mentioned disastrous error. Here was his nPw slogan: 
Drink Dullbrau . .. it's better than Miller High Life 
Well sir, I guess I don't have to tell you what happenPd! Every­body in the country just stamped and hootPd and laughed till they wept. "Dullbrau better than Miller High Life, the Champagne of Beers?" they cried, stamping and hooting and laughing till they wept. "How droll! Why, 110 beer is better than MiiiPr! In fact, no beer is re­motely as good as Miller!" 
Then everybody finished stamping and hooting and laughing till they wept and went back to drinking MiiiPr High Life and enjoying every distinctively delicious drop. Dullbrau, of course, went out of business. Mr. Glebe, of course, got fired. His sons, of course, had to quit school. 
Today, alas, the once prosperous Glebe family is destitute and living in a macrobiotic commune in the former Dullbrau brewery. Ex­cept for Seymour. Though out of college, Seymour remained in Cam­bridge and now works at a three·minute girl wash on Harvard Square.

Laos wants foreign troops out 
VIENTIANE UPI -Premier ·Prince Souvanna Phouma has

The sources said Communist 
troops overran a battalion 
headquarters at Phoum Koum on 
the northern end of the Plain of 
Jars in north central Laos on 
Feb. 22. They did not say why the 
loss of the outpost had not been 
reported earlier.

Closer to Vientiane, the sources said three regiments of North Vietnamese troops has crossed "our lines of defense by massive infiltration" and now were in positions two to four miles east of the northeast defense headquarters of Long Cheng and Sam Thong. 
Souvanna announced his ap­peal for help in a speech to a youth group Saturday, but it was not officially reported until yesterday. 
"A few days ago my representative at the U.N. asked .Secretary General U Thant to intervene with the great powers 
' to restore the 1962 Geneva ac­cords and secure the withdrawal of all foreign troops operating in Laos. Without tcses foreigh troops, our difficulties can be quickly and effectively solved," Souvanna said.

Faculty who are full-time and have tenure would be granted tenure by Notre Dame. The only 
stipulation being that tenure granted after January 1, 1971 would be sugject to review by the department, dean and Provost. 
Full-time, non-tenured faculty would be granted equivalent contracts with salaries gradually ' being upgraded to Notre Dame levels. The Holy Cross Sisters would be offered a contract similar to the one now in force with the Priests of Holy Cross. Also, positions on the board of trustees and the Fellows of the University would be granted to the sisters. 
Burtchaell also called for several major organizational changes. First he proposed the creation of a College of Social Sciences (Sociology, An­thropology, Psychology, Economics, Education). and further to divide the College of Arts and Letters into a division of fine arts and a division of humanities. The division of fine arts, along with Law, and Social Sciences would then be located on the present St. Mary's campus. 
Om closing, The Provost "asks colleagues who have become closer friends of late to move into the university." He concluded: "A few will oppose the plan however presented. The many should no longer put aside their priorities for their sake."
