Jurors in New Port, R.I. got a rare glimpse yester­day of the fabled mansion where Claus C. von Bulow allegedly tried to kill his wife, viewing the marble bathroom where she fell into a coma and the closet where her son says he found an insulin-tainted hypodermic needle. Superior <::ourtJudge Thomas H. Needham said opening arguments would begin today, and the prosecution said its first witn t ess will be von Bulow's stepson, Prince Alexander von Auersperg. He was the first to voice suspicions that his stepfather tried to kill his mother and t enlisted a private attorney and detective to gather evidence. The prosecution wanted the middle-class jury to be familiar with the estate where the Danish-born financial consult­ant is accused of trying to kill Martha "Sunny" von Bulow. Prosecutors say von Bulow loved another woman and wanted his 
wife's $35 million fortune. -AP 
Two elderly residents of the affluent suburb of Morton Grove, Illinois surrendered four weapons to police yester­day as the nation's only law banning sale or possession of handguns took effect. Village employees said they answered about 2'5 telephone calls in the morning. mostly from news reporters asking if any guns had been turned in. The law was passed June H and has survived state and federal court challenges from opponents who say it violates the constitutional right to hear arms. All weapons surren­dered will be held for five years in case the ordinance eventually is overturned. Police said they expected few guns would be turned in and they weren't going out looking for them. "We haven't some kind of quota to fill," said Larry Schey, police chief in this village of 26,500. "We won't he kicking down doors to get handguns." -AP 
Reid Sheltonperformed Daddy Warbucks in the musical "Annie" in Boston for the 2,000th time Sunday night, and he says he's still delighted with the role. Shelton, who originated the role in the summer of 1976, was given a huge red, green and white cake with an iced replica of the orphan girl, and said, "All 2,000 (performances) have been wonderful." After the performance he was joined by other cast members, including his present Annie, Kristi .'vlcArdle, 9, of North Cape May, N.J., who first played Molly, the smallest orphan, in the show. Also on hand was Annie's dog, Sandy, whose real name is Buttercup. Shelton. who was nominated for a Tony for his Daddy Warbucks role, which he played I, I H9 times on Broadway, said, "I loved every minute ofit ... I've played with five wonderful little girls, An nics. It's a joy to work with the kids." He added, "The dogs all have been wonderful." -AP 
Hairs from Wayne B. Williams' head match 
hairs that were found under the clothing ofone of Atlanta's 2H slain 
young blacks, an FBI fiber expert testified yesterday at Williams' 
murder trial. The hairs found underneath I 1-year-old Patrick Bal­
tazar's shirt "could have originated from Wayne Williams," Harold 
Deadman said. He conceded that "hair comparisons arc not a 
positive means of association," hut added, "I have rarely seen in­
stances where hairs from two different individuls exhibit the same 
charceristics." Deadman's testimony came at the start of the sixth 
week of trial for Williams, a 23-year-old black free-lance photog­
rapher charged with murdering Nathaniel Cater, 27. and Jimmy Ray 
Payne, 21, two ofthe 28 young blacks whose deaths ovt:r a 22-month 
period have been investigated by a special police task force. 
Prosecutors, who are expected to wind up their case this week, are 
presenting evidence on I 0 additional slayings, including Baltazar's, 
in an effort to show a pattern that may fit the deaths. -AP 
Sen. Richard G. Lugar' R-Ind., urged the Reagan administration yesterday to make it clear that it will not renew economic aid to the Polish government without "genuine and fun­damental reforms." In a letter to Secretary ofState Alexander M. Haig Jr., Lugar said the administration's stated objectives ofan end to mar­
tiallaw, the release ofofficials of the Solidarity labor movement and 
the beginning of"internal dialogue" in Poland "are admirable as far 
as they go." "But far more reform in Poland will be required before 
any further U.S. assistance would he justified," Lugar added. Robert 
D. Hormats, assistant secretaryo state for economic affairs, last week told the Foreign Relations subcommittee on European affairs, which Lugar heads, that financial sanctions imposed by the United States "have made it clear to the Polish regime that it will pay a price for its repression."-AP

Stopping the presses 
Growing up with newspapers is painful in this day and age. 
Newspapers don't grow old with grace. They are choked off by a vicious economic environment until they begin to rot from the inside out and finally collapse in one last helpless gasp of journalistic precision. 
The Philadelphia Bulletin died last week, the fourth 
major daily to go under in the last six months. 
Like most newspapers. The Bulletin failed miserably 
as a business venture. The question is not so much 
whether newspapers will lose money. hut rather how 
much will they lose and. more importantly, how much 
will the publishers tolerate losing. 
In these days of conglomerates, chains and synd­
icates, the tolerance level is particularly low. For cor­
porations, the bottom line is hounded by a dollar sign. 
For those of us who have grown up with newspapers, other considerations come to mind. Fred :\1eyers. a Bulle/in photographer for 4 I years and winner ofa Pulitzer Prize. captured the feeling: "I feel I spent my whole life doing something worthwhile here. and now it's all down the drain." 
Even in the few markets where afternoon dailies are outselling morning papers. the drive to increase advl·rtising.. revenues to cover operating costs is 
relentless. And that drive from Buffalo. :"'lew York, destroys people. runs the computer system, 
My father is one of those always seeking to improve people. ,\1y father works ti1r the machinery that will The Buffalo Neu•s in Buffalo, someday put newspapers to New York.

The cor­ogy, and I would not give it poration doesn't tolerate up for the sake of saving losses as a local fa.mily does. newspapers. Tomorrow 
The News is one of the few cannot be held back for yes­afternoon dailies in the na­terday's sake. tion to dominate a major .\1y lament is not for market, but that's not newspapers, but for men enough. Market domination like Fred :\1eyers who go is nothing without turning a "down the drain" with 

profit to match. And The 
Buffalo News is losing 
money, lots ofit. 

In the newspaper world, there are essentially two 
ways to cut losses: One way is to cut staff, and the other 
is to increase advertising revenues through incn:ased 
sales. With increasingly fewer salesmen, it becomes -increasingly more difficult to sell more advertising. 
My father sells advertising. My father's friends sell 
advertising, at least those who still are working. After 43 
years of newspaper work, my father is watching his 
friends being turned to jelly by the high-pressure rush 
for sales volume. And perhaps his chiefhope now is that 
he survives to retirement, still two years away. 
Reading ofThe Philadelphia Bulletin's closing made me think of my father. I wondered how the shutdown

made him fed. I wondered whether he already is at the point beyond which he ca.n't he hurt any more by the folding ofanother newspaper. 
Craftsmen don't tell their sons of the pain felt when their art is dying. 
But growing up with a craft makes one sensitive to such things. Sure, people will always want to read. and journalism itself is not yet in danger of passing. hut the handwriting is on the wall for newspapers. 
:"'lewspapers today arc high-technology enterprises. Technology doesn't destroy, it diminates. 
"Our trade's done; I don't know where any of us will get a job." said one 37-ycar veteran of The Bulletin's composing room, whose occupation has been eliminated by machines. 
At The Obsen,er, the son 
of an advertising salesman 
newspapers; for my father, 
for the passage ofa dream to which he devoted a lifetime; and for my part, however small, in speeding that passage. 
I am a newspaperman. the son of a newspaperman. My father grew up with newspapers, but the newspapers he grew up with are dying. He passed that pain onto me, but he also bestowed a sense of purpose. 
That sense is summed up by the executive editor of The Philadelphia Bulletin, in a speech at an editorial meeting before the paper ceased operations: 
"We've got two more days to go. Let's do it right." Father, in whatever time I have left with what I call a newspaper, I will try to do it right. That's what the pain of growing up with newspapers has taught me.

Born in Rathgar, Dublin, on Feb. 2, 1882, the author of "Ulysses" and "Finnegan's Wake" both loved and hated his untry. "He wanted to free people from the demands of church and state which imposed conventions upon them," Richard EHmann, author of the standardJoyce biography, said in an interview. EHmann, an American, is Goldsmith Professor of English Literature at Oxford University, England. "I think the Irish have been a little slow to recognize Joyce's greatness but they have done their best to catch up now," he said.  Priestley said in his "Literature and the Western Man" thatJoyce did not invent stream-ot:consciousness or interior-monologue and what's more: "most of what we have been told about Joyce as the great modern master of the novel, changing the course of fiction, opening a way for later novelists, is nonsense." Novelist Evelyn Waugh once said of the Irishman: "he wrote absolute rot. You could watch him going mad sentenceby-sentence if you read 'Ulysses." Joyce's ambivalence toward Ireland led him to choose exile in Europe from his early 20s until his death in 1<)41, but he continued to write almost exclusively about Dublin. Educated by Jesuits, he became a fierce anti-Catholic, like the autobiographical Stephen Dedalus in "A Portrait ofthe Artist as a Young  million in highway tax funds to Washington in I<)80, the last year statistics are available. The state was allowed S90 million from the federal trust fund. West Virginia sent S55.7 million to Washington and was en­titled to $233 million. Some of those disparities are the result of extensive interstate high­way projects in a state, but a sig­nificant amount stem from the distribution formula. "There are quite a few concerns from states whose needs are greater than revenue collection within those states," says Charilyn Cowan, a transportation specialist with the National Governors' Association. "The question is whether these recipient states can raise the money (under new federalism )...If they have to look at only their own sources, they will have to raise taxes," said one Federal Highway Administration official, asking not to be identified by name.
