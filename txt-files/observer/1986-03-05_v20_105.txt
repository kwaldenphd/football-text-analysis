Domagalski, Switek to battle in run-off election 
By LYNNE R. STRAND 
Staff Reporter 

Jim Domagalski and Mike Switek will face each other in a run­off for Notre Dame student body president tomorrow after neither received enough votes to win yesterday's election. 
Domagalski and Laurie Bink received 2,095 votes, 47.8 percent of the votes cast. Switek and Don Montanaro tallied 875 votes, or 20 percent. 
A candidate needs to receive more than 50 percent of the votes to win the election, according to Tom Brennan, Ombudsman election of­ficer. 
Domagalski missed winning last night's ballot by 95 votes. 
Close behind Switek was the ticket of Bruce Lohman and Jim Crandall with 810 votes, or 18.5 percent. 
With 60.5 percent of Notre Dame undergraduates voting, this year's turnout was significantly higher than last year's total of 44 percent. 
"I'm very pleased with the tur­nout," said Brennan. "I think the constitution, anti-apartheid, and presidential guys all brought in the vote." 
In a distant fourth place was Mike Millen and Sheila O'Connor, who gathered 312 votes, 7.1 percent of the votes cast. Mike Torkelson

Notre Dame should divest from 
companies which have operations 
in South Africa, according to most 
students who voted in yesterday's 
referendum. 

Of the students who voted, 48 percent were in favor of divest­ment, 33 percent were against divestment and 19 percent voted "no opinion/not adequately in­formed." 
Fifty-eight percent of all Notre Dame undergraduates voted in the divestment referendum. 
"Everyone on campus has the right to express their opinion and I'm glad that they did," said University President Father Theodore Hesburgh when inform­
ed of the results of the divestment 
referendum. 

"I'm glad that so many people took an interest in the divestment issue," said senior John Dettling, a member of the Board of Trustees Ad Hoc Committee on South African Investments. "I'm also kind of surprised that it passed because I thought a Io.t of students would be swayed by Father Hesburgh's stand on the issue. 
"The results show that there is a substantial interest and understanding of the issue on cam­pus. Our voices will now be heard by the Board of Trustees." 
Dettling also said the next logical step is for more students to actively support the Anti-Apartheid Net­work in the network's weekly rallies. 
"It's also logical that Student Body President Bill Healy, as a representative of the student body, should advocate the position of divestment to the Board of Trustees," he added. 
Healy, however, said he was not convinced that most students sup­port divestment. 
"Only 48 percent of the students who voted at all chose divestment," said Healy. "The student body does not overwhelmingly support divest­ment. Thus, the Anti-Apartheid Network cannot claim to be representative of the students as a whole. 
"I will bring the statistics from the referendum to the Board of

New constitution comes up short 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI 
Senior Staff Reporter 

The student body rejected a pro­posal for a new constitution yester­day, leaving student government restructuring in a state of confu­sion. 
Although more than half the students voted for the constitution, it failed to obtain the two-thirds majority needed for adoption. 
Now, another constitution proposal will be presented to the Hall Presidents' Council tomorrow night. Whether or not the HPC has the power to adopt this proposal, however, is the focus of some debate. 
Nevertheless, proponents of the original proposal said they were upset by the proposal's defeat. 
"I didn't expect it to pass, not with the circulating petition misrepresenting what was going to 
happen," said Student Senator Jim Hagan. Brain Holst, chairman of the 
Committee on Restructuring, agreed with Hagan. "I'm disap­pointed because I think the issue got confused by the other pro­posal," he said. 
Opponents of the proposed con­stitution said they were glad the proposal was rejected. "I'm glad it didn't go through," said Carroll Hall President Steve Kern. "I don't think the senate would be effective in a 28 to 30 person body." 
Many said the latest constitution proposal, presented to the Student Senate Monday night, confused the students and helped defeat the pro­posed constitution. 
Student leaders disagree about whether the HPC has the power to adopt the latest constitution pro­posal. 
"If the HPC passes it, it is . adopted," said Healy. 
According to the present con­stitution, an amendment proposed by the senate may be adopted by a two-thirds vote of the HPC. 
Although the senate did not vote to propose the amendment, "It is in effect a proposal by the student senate," Healy said. The student senate had no say on it because the student body (by presenting the petition) "forced the hand of the student senate." Healy said no one opposed his interpretation at the senate meeting. 
Maher Mouasher, chairman of Ombudsman, disagreed with Healy's interpretation. "It is not a proposal by the senate, it is a pro­posal by tlie student body," said Mouasher. He said because it is a proposal by the student body, the present constitution does not allow the HPC to adopt it.

and John Kromer took 130 votes, or 3 percent. Tom Grier and Steve Guenther received 88 votes, 2 per­cent, while John Walsh and Pat Walsh received 70 votes, 1.6 per­cent. 
There were 106 write-ins and abstentions. 
All 24 dorms were won by either Domagalski, Switek or Lohman. Domagalski was supported by 15 dorms and off campus while split­ting the Howard Hall vote with Switek. Both Switek and Lohman won four dorms. 
Flanner and Breen-Phillips Halls supported their home candidates Domagalski and Bink, while Switek and Montanaro carried the vote in Cavanaugh, their home dorm, as well as Fisher, Keenan, and Sorin.

Some words for the losers: Lombardi was a psychopath 
I rad for student body president once. It was in grammar school and there were several other can­didates running, but people considered me among the favorites. And for an eleven-year-old politician it's not easy to keep these king of things in perspective. It's not easy for a 58-year-old politician. 
Swollen with the encouragement of my friends, I convinced myself I had it made. My campaign slogan was, "He'll keep us out of war." I made my best friend campaign manager and together we made these cam­paign buttons and hung them with yarn around the necks of just about everybody in the school. 
I gave a speech in front of the entire school assembly and paraphrased John F. Kennedy: "Ask not what your school can do for you, but what you can do for your schoo." All the other candidates used the same line in their speeches. 
Well, I lost. I was so sure I was going to win and I lost. One of the nuns told the losing candidates that if we wanted to see how many votes we got we could come see her after school. All the other candidates went, but I didn't. I walked home alone-hurt and angry. 
"How could I lost?" I demanded from the gods. Maybe I should have campaigned among the second­and third-graders more. Tough luck. 
I vowed not to return to school the next day. How could I go back and face all the people whom I assured I was a shoe-in after I lost? This may sound like a "Brady Bunch" episode, but I swear it's true. Of course, the next day I went back and it was kind of bad. But the day after that it wasn't so bad, and the day after that I barely remembered about the election. 
Funny, isn't it? I thought my life would be traumatized by this humiliating defeat and three days later I was playing cards with the person who beat me. 
There really isn't any moral to this story. Stories that come ready-made with a moral are obnoxious. Rather, the important thing is that this experience threw into question all my conceptions about the im­portance of winning, of being number one. 
In our society, we are always under some heavy pressure to be winners, especially young people. Look how often Vince Lombardi is quoted "Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing." These are the words of a certifiable psychopath. 
Winning isn't everything. It's meaningless. The ex­perience is infinitely more important. And that's the truth. 

In school athletics, whether it's on the peewee or the college level, coaches are constantly urging their athletes to be number one. Students are encouraged to study hard so they can get into the school that is their number one choice. Socially, boys and girls are pressured by their peers to hang out with the best crowd. 
Get into the job market and people have to hustle for the top slots-whether they're stock brokers or doormen. There are always winners and there are always losers. 
Too much emphasis is put on winning and not enough is put on doing. No matter how far a person goes, no matter how many things he or she ac­complishes, there's always going to be a new, bigger challenge. I've seen number one and number one is overrated. Pretty depressing. 
Whether or not yesterday's presidential election turned into a run-off or somebody earned enough votes to win, the fact is sooner or later there will be only one winner and six losers. 
The winner deserves to be congratulated for going an effective job. Being voted student body president of a school the caliber of Notre Dame is quite an ac­complishment. The winner deserves to be very proud. 
But here's to the losers.

Student radio stations announce new managers amid controversy 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
Assistant New Editor 
The new student managers for 
WVFl-AM and WSND-FM were 
elected last night, but the students 
who served as managers this year 
did not assist in the selection of 
their successors. 
Station managers Eileen Ridley 
of WSND-FM and Reginald Daniel 
of WVFl-AM resigned last week . and withdrew from their station duties after the adminstration ordered WSND-FM to stop airing a public service announcement from a homosexual group. 
Jesse Pesta was named as sta­
tionmanager of WSND-FM, and 
Sheila McDaniel as station 
manager of WVFl-AM. 
Ridley said she asked Assistant Vice President for Student Services Father Francis Cafarelli last week to allow WSND-FM to continue running the homosexual group's announcements with a disclaimer. 
The disclaimer would have said something similar to  fhese views do not necessarily reflect the views" of the station, Cafarelli said. 
When Cararelli declined the re­quest, Ridley submitted her resignation officially, she said. 
According to Cafarelli, running the disclaimers along with the an­nouncement would have created controversy just by their presence. The disclaimers also would have drawn additional attention to the announcements, he said.

Thirty men report to you. 
Although Ridley and Daniel's resignations became effective Fri­day, the station managers had stop­ped performing their duties two weeks ago after Cafarelli informed Ridley of the ban of the an­nouncements from the Gays and Lesbians at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
"I resigned becasue I felt that not airing the PSA (public service an­nouncement) was a form of censor­ship," said Ridley . 
Cararelli, however, said the issue of censorship "is not a valid point in this particular matter." 
He said University ad­ministrators banned the group's an­nouncements because "there has to be some concern for the interests of the institution relative to what goes out as part of our programming." 
According to Ridley, "It (the an­nouncement's ban) was contrary to what I think a public station is sup­posed to do, that it serve the public. 
"In other words, WSND con­siders itself, professes and defines itself as a public service station, and as such, has an obligation to the public," she said. 
Public service announcements, which are aired free of charge, par­tially fulfill that obligation, she said. 
Although adminstrators original­ly banned the announcement only on WSND-FM, Cafarelli said he later told Daniel not to air the an­nouncement on WVFI-AM. 
And can 
Daniel stated in his Feb. 28 resignation that "if they (WVFI­AM and WSND-FM) are meant to be Catholic or University stations then they need to be run as such and student managers aren't ap­propriate." 
"It has always been my conten­tion that this is not what either of the stations were meant to be . . . the resignation continued. 
Repeated calls to Daniel last night went unanswered. 
Ridley said that although her resignation hurt WSND-AM, re­maining with the station after the administration's decision would have hurt WSND-FM more. 
"I felt that someone had to stand up for the station and the principles involved." This includes here right as station manager to determine what is aired on WSND-FM, she said. 
Other executive board positions announced last night were Bill Her­zog as executive news director, Frank Mastro as executive sports director, Tim Mulrooney as pro­duction director and Mike Thesing as chief engineer. 
Cafarelli said he would like to meet with the new executive board soon to discuss such matters as the stations' finances and WVFI-AM's transmitting system but not the an­nouncement's ban.

Counseling follows LeMans baby incident 
By MARILYN BENCHIK 
StaffReporter 
Saint Mary's College officials are working to counsel students and answer their questions con­cerning the stillborn baby found last Saturday in LeMans Hall, according to Pat Rissmeyer, director of Residence Life and Housing. 
"Administrators at Saint Mary's College are respecting the privacy of the mother and her stillborn child while respon­ding to the general student population," said Rissmeyer. 
She said all Saint Mary's resi­dent assistants have had section meetings to answer students' questions individually. 
Off Campus Advisors are also trying to talk to people in­dividually, according to Rissmeyer. "In this way we are able to reach the entire student body," she said. 
"Some of the main concerns that students have are questions that deal with how the girl is do­ing. was the baby stillborn, and was the child baptized. The answer to that last question is yes," Rissmeyer said. 
"Our very initial concern was to work with the students who lived in the section where the girl lived and the incident occurred. There was a prayer service for the mother . and child Sunday night for students living in the section," she said. 
She added that many people have had varied reactions to a death in the community. 
"We are trying to provide an opportunity for students to talk about the incident. Students are free to talk to counselors at Career and Counseling and at Campus Ministry." 
"The entire community must remember not to judge people. The job of a Christian com­munity is to offer support to those who need it," she said. 
Mary Feeley, director of Campus Ministry, said, "The needs of the student body have certainly changed because some students are realizing their own vulnerabilities concerning this issue."

Student constitution debated once again 
By ALEX PELTZER 
Copy Editor 

Yesterday, while students were placing their votes for the referendum on the proposed stu­dent government constitution, the Hall Presidents' council discuss yet another constitution. 
Because the proposed con­stitution received only 53 per­cent of yesterday's referendum vote -short of the two-thirds vote needed -this new pro­posal now can be voted on the HPC. The Council will meet tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. to vote on the new proposal. 
The latest constitution pro­posal, brought to the Student Senate Monday night by former Judicial Council member Laura McKnight, was signed by more than 1,300 students, approx­imately 18 percent of the student body. This qualifies it as a stu­dent body proposal. 
There was much question last night, however, as to whether the HPC could adopt the latest constitution proposal. The argu­ment was about the fact that there is no provision in the pre­sent constitution for approval of a student body proposal. 
Student Body President Bill Healy said last night, however, that the latest constitution pro­posal should be considered a proposal from the senate. He said the proposal was brought to the senate and the senate is now presenting it to the HPC. 




(!i!ee~~l
(The Boss with the Sauce) proudly presents 

Thus, under Rule 2 of the pre­sent constitution, the HPC may approve the latest constitution proposal at the meeting tomor­row, Healy said. Rule 2 states that the HPC, through a two­thirds vote of its members, may approve a proposal made by the senate. 
However, according to Maher Mouasher, chairman .of Om­budsman, the student petition is not a senate proposal because it was not passed by two-thirds of the student senate. Therefore the petition cannot be adopted by the HPC under Rule 2. 
Kevin Howard, HPC chair­man, said the council should be discussing the latest constitution proposal instead of worrying about its legality. 
"It is our duty to vote on it, yes or no, and let Judicial Coun­cil decide on the legality of it," said Howard. 
Judicial Council Coordinator Karen Ingwersen refused to comment on the matter last night. 
Among other changes, the latest constitution proposal eliminates the senate as a governmental body. Five elected senators would remain, however, and would serve on the Campus Life Council, instead of having their own structure. 
Also, the HPC would be in­volved in the amendment pro­cedure, unlike in the proposal voted on yesterday.

now. We're going to campaign very hard Wednesday," he said. 
Montanaro, Switek's n,mning mate, said that "20 percent of the people made a statement with their vote today (Tuesday). We're anx­ious to see what percentage of peo­ple make the same vote Thursday. 
"It is true that we're uglier than fruit rollups and we're not afraid to admit it," he continued. 
"We're serious now," Switek said. "When we started. we weren't that serious, but now we're serious. We want to win. We think the students will appreciate a more relaxed atmosphere." 
Domagalski said his ticket was successful for two reasons. 
"The success we had today can be directly attributed to two things," said Domagalski. He noted his· ticket's "great campaign staff who worked very hard" and an "agressive style of leadership ideas. 
Referring to Domagalski and Bink, Switek added, "They ran a tough campaign. We've countered it with the only methods we knew." 
"It's important to remember everything starts with a clean slate on Thursday," Montanaro said. "We got this far having fun. We're just going to keep having fun. Ner­vousness is for the front runner." 
Added Switek, "We had a vague suspicion that we might have some success but nothing like this."

"The South Africa issue attracted a lot of votes. We had people specifically ask to vote in that elec­tion," said David Stephenitch, director of Ombudsman. 
"We also had a number of graduate students ask if they could vote on the divestment issue. Un­fortunately, this election was for undergraduates only," he added. 
Almost 300 more students voted on the divestment issue than voted on the revised constitution for stu­dent government. A total of 4,413 students voted on the divestment referendum, while 4,135 voted on the constitution referendum.

Student leads parade with luck of Irish 
By CLIFF STEVENS 
News Staff 
The luck of the Irish must be with Erin Brennan. 
Brennan, a Saint Mary's sophomore, will be the queen in Chicago's St. Patrick's Day parade this year. She was chosen last Friday night. 
Her duties began this morning with a bagpipe procession into Chicago City Hall for a photo session with the mayor. 
"I was shocked because it was such a big contest and I got that far," she said. 
Brennan, a Bridgeport, Il­linois resident, said photographs and names were the criteria for selection of the 188 finalists from the pool of approximately 1,200 Chicago area applicants. 
"If you're Irish, they could pick you," she said. "If you're not Irish. you'rt out." 
Brennan, whose father is Irish, said the final selection was based on appearance. She said 30 Cbicago businessmen, politi­cians, and lawyers judged the final contest. 
Her prizes included a paid vacation for two to Ireland and $5,000 worth of other prizes. 
This was Brennan's third year entering the contest. Last year, she was on the queen's court. "my dad has always entered me because his nieces have been in it before," she said. 
"My mom and my dad are just extremely proud." Brennan added. 
"A lot of people that I just know vaguely are all saying con­gratulations, but my close friends are giving me guff about the whole thing and teasing me to every end." she said.

'Opus' tries to put the fun back into ND elections 
We are Opus. Our friends have been ask­ing us why we have been flagging tests and coming home as the football team leaves for their morning practice just to write "From the Slush Up -a Penguin's Perspective of the Notre Dame elections." Yes, why. For fun 
Joanie Cahill & Karen Ingwersen a visit from the penguin 
(what we would like to say isn't printable but we think you've got the idea.) We both know how serious and intense things get around here during election time. We just hoped to lighten the mood and bring some fun to elec­tions this year. Hopefully we. succeeded in making people laugh and in making the can­didates take themselves a little less seriously. 
We consciously decided at the beginning not to make this a slanderous project. We abused everyone liberally -and everyone got abused. We would like to commend the can­didates for their good sportsmanship and for sharing their ability to laugh at themselves with all of us. We know that one of the can­didates has been offended by Opus. We offer our sincerest apologies -it was all done in fun. 
Meanwhile, in the last few days Opus has had a hard time waddling through all of the political mud. After all, that's why we wrote Opus in the first place -to enjoy the elections without fighting the mudslinging. We've heard rumors flying about candidates skir­ting election rules and even attacking Opus. 
A student government office shouldn't mean that much to anyone. We know it's not worth that much. Tell us please, do elections really have to be like this? 
That's why we wrote from a Bloom Coun­ty perspective. Elections seem to be more fun -and a lot less petty -down there. From a personal experience we know that elections here do get incredibly petty. Perhaps there shouldn't be any election rules, except a spending limit. It certainly would prevent the OBUD election committee from making the focus of elections the rules ihemselves in­stead of the candidates. And maybe ... just maybe ... it would allow the candidates to concentrate on real issues -and not on their political skills. 
There comes a point when you have to say let's cut out the backstabbing and the nonsense and remember that we are all human beings who deserve respect from each other. This should be especially true in what is supposed to be a Christian community. 
We hope that you have enjoyed Opus as much as we have enjoyed writing it. Bill the Cat says that a little more respect for each other might make things a lot more fun -all the time. And y'all know how Opus feels about fun!

Hesburgh's successor must guide in Assisian way 
The last time I visited St. Peter's, Rome, it was in the company of a professor of an­thropology. What a pleasure it was to have along someone who could cast a professional eye over the place and also cut through the complex reactions of awe and discomfort that St. Peter's elicits in Catholics like me. My anthropologist companion proceeded to place the building, as artifact, in a cultural context. St. Peter's, he said, is about power; it is designed to intimidate.

guest column 
A few days later, clutching privileged pink tickets provided by our Franciscan hosts (the tickets entitled us to front-row seats and a handshake from the Pope), we attended the Wednesday morning audience. The crowd was huge; as the Pope processed slowly down the aisle, the atmosphere was dithyrambic: people shrieked, pawed the air in vain efforts to touch him implored and ejaculated pieties and litanies of praise. Again the intrepid anthropologist's commen­tary was indispensable. 
The pomp and circumstance of monarchy, he observed, does not vary much from culture to culture. Hierarchical authority is maintained by much the same fneans in a Yoruba, British or Roman court. Drawing on his ethological studies, he said, too, that alpha males among silver-backed gorillas in the animal kingdom use comparable techni­ques to subdue rivals. 
Before we left Italy, our party made a pilgrimage to Assisi. The distance we travell­ed from Rome was much more than physical. The styles of Catholicism were palpably different. Assisi provoked those questions about commitment to the devout life which Rome's majesty manages to obscure. 
I confess to having an agenda for recalling these experiences. I wish to raise the issue of succession at Notre Dame. For three decades now, the University has been developing in the St. Peter's tradition. It is not too fanciful to see Father Hesburgh as a Renaissance figure -a Doge of Venice or a Medici prelate comes to mind -he has that sort of dowments; under his leadership Notre Dame has enjoyed a long period of heady growth.

However, institutions must be supple and prescient enough to know when to adapt if they are not be overtaken by the laws of en­tropy. Discussion on how to achieve more community, consultation and equality at the University, for example, is a matter of some urgency. To put it bluntly, Hesburgh's suc­cessor will have to consider guiding Notre Dame in a more Assisian direction. 
Itis a pity that students, alumni and facul­ty will not be canvassed about the selection of the next president. This, sadly, in in­evitable given the clericalism that is the unac­ceptable face of Notre Dame. In a struggle to gain a veto for the Academic Council on top administrative appointments -a struggle which he lost -Professor Goerner, a distinguished teacher from the government department, likened the University to a col­onial territory where the subjects (natives) are disenfranchised. The year was 1974. Things have not changed much. 
Another curious episode from the recent past illustrates the way things are done at Notre Dame. From 1971 to 1978 Father James Burtchaell was provost. In what seem­ed like an overnight putsch, he was gone; no explanation was given to the community for his sudden departure. Idle speculation abounded for a while, but like "good Ger­mans" we had learned not to question the authorities and the fait accompli was ac­cepted. 
Only last year, while reading the preface to Burtchaell's book "Rachael Weeping," did I discover what may be a clue to that mysterious exit. John D. Rockefeller Ill, who held strong opinions on population con­trol, had accused the Catholic Church of obscurantism on this issue. Burtchaell, who has a knight's errant relationship with the Church, took Rockefeller on in Newsweek. Fur flew. It is likely that because of his friendship with David Rockefeller, Hesburgh was displeased with this con­tretemps. My hunch is that this incident was not unconnected to Burtchaell's departure. 
When I was an undergraduate at Notre Dame, the "three B's," Burtchaell, Burrell and Bartell were the names usually bruited in any discussion of the succession. I am puzzl­ed by the fact that these contenders seem to have slipped into the background. Burt­chaell, in spite of an irritating seigniorial style, is an accomplished theologian with a

considerable reputation outside the Universi­ty. I have always admired his Christology. Burtchaell is a genuine intellectual, again with a reputation which is not confined to Notre Dame circles. His work on Islam has made him sensitive to ecumenical issues and his way of life is agreeably simple. Bartell's qualifications include presidential experience (Stonehill College) and work at H.E.W. dur­ing the Carter administration. His grasp of Latin American issues gives him an ex­perience that would be invaluable in any president of a prominent, North American Catholic university. 
What I fear most is the appointment of an apparatchik. It could happen. Men who have been hugely successful in a top job (and those around them), sometimes have an un­conscious desire to be followed by a non­entity. Consider what happened in the case of Winston Churchill. His successor, Sir An­tony Eden, was by no means the best talent on offer in the Tory Party at the time. Poor Sir Antony fell at the first hurdle, collapsing into a nervous heap during the 1956 Suez crisis. 
~otre Dame under an unimaginative, clencal bureaucrat could soon dissipate its potential to develop into a more secure, con­fident and egalitarian community, commit­ted to producing well-educated, sturdy Christians for service in our polarized and dangerous world.

Healy uses publication to attack his enemies 
Dear Editor: 
Bill Healy obviously felt it was time to pat himself on the back when he came up with the idea for the latest student government publication, "We The People." I suppose that makes sense, since no one else was going to do it, except maybe Father Theodore Hesburgh. 
The interview with Healy was very enlightening, but who was asking the ques­tions? I can only assume Healy, knowing himself above all others, felt that he was the only person qualified to conduct the inter­view. Healy uses this interview, as well as the entire publicaton, to attack certain groups and organizations that have caused him problems throughout the year. 
For example, contrary to what Healy in­sinuates, the recall was an independent ef­fort, by several students, not a product of the Anti-Apartheid Network. Doesn't he even know the people who wanted him thrown out of office? I guess there were too many to know them all personally. He also uses this interview to harp on his personal feeling about The Observer's financial statements. We all know how student government feels on this matter. Healy should refrain from using student govern­ment funds to print his personal accusations.

I was also pleased to see that "We The People had already determined the outcome of the student referendum before the students went through the pains of voting themselves. In addition, t.he poll in this publication that determines that students favor investment in South Africa should suf­ficiently sway the 18.8 percent No-Opinion votes to the "right" choice. I hope Healy remembered to mail a copy of "We The Peo­ple" to each of the trustees so that they can be properly informed of developments in the divestment issue. 
I won't bother to continue. A publication concerning the year in review is a good idea. The Year According To Bill Healy is a waste of the paper it was printed on.

Concept of the Tao expresses truths about Christ 
"In the beginning was the Tao, and the Tao was with God, and the Tao was God." 
... And so opens the Gospel according to St. John, as it has appeared in Bibles prepared for the Chinese. In your English translation it reads: "In the beginning was the Word, ...."The original Greek term, logos, translates most simply as "Word" but, in fact, conveys a number of truths: that Jesus Christ is "Meaning," "Utterance," "Cause," "Reason," "Principle." Good theology. Yet, the word-concept Tao ex­presses closely-related truths about Christ and His gospel that we, as well as the Chinese, might do well to know and respond to. 
David K. Seid 
guest column 

Tao means something like "Natural Law" or "The Way." Or better yet, "The Way of Harmony." The first Christians, before they were ever called by that name, were iden­tified as "followers of the Way." (Acts 9:2, 
24: 14). As we shall see, the principles of the Kingdom preached by the Prince of Peace are the principles of "The Way of Har­mony." 
One great truth conveyed by the Tao of Christ is that (s)he who would discover goodness must acquiesce to the way of yielding and renounce the way of striving. For there is but one sin; and there is but one good. The one sin is the will to power (Nietsche; Satan; "the world"). The one good is harmony with God (cosmic law; Tao; ap­preciation of unblemished being). The Tao Te Chin reads: "When the Tao is absent from the universe, the horses haul manure. When the Tao is absent from the universe, war horses are bred outside the city. There is no greater sin than desire, no greater curse than discontent, no greater misfortune than wanting something for oneself." In another place we read: "The highest good is like water. Water gives life to the 10 thousand things and does not strive. It flows in places men reject and so is like the Tao." In the same vein, but completing the thought, the Apostle Paul declares: "Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: Who, be­ing in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness, and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obe­dient to death -even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow . . . and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord." (Phil. 2:5-11). 
There are certain wordly philosophers and secularly-minded humanists who would vehemently reject the Way of Harmony as demeaning to the human spirit. And, indeed, they are profound thinkers -in their own unpopular way. In truth, as Taoism il­luminates, all realities exist in (bi-)polarity. For every Yin there is a complementary Yang. Comprehending any given reality re­quires not only a recognition of each polarity and how they exist in natural tension but also how it is imbalance -not a polar quality in itself -that results in evil. The truth that sin is disharmony is not alien to the Catholic mind as the Church has always defined heresy as taking one part of a truth and em­phasizing and exaggerating that one part as if it were and to near exclusion of the whole. Hence, one can best appreciate a philosopher like Nietzche -who ranted and raved against Christianity as effeminate, weak, life-denying, etc. -for providing a valuable critique of what happens when there is too much Yin and too little Yang. Unfortunate­ly, Yang-aholics like Nietzche are psychologically incapable of recognizing their own disease. Worse still, Nietzche, looking only in one direction with only one eye, and thus lacking depth perception, never really caught on as to how radical Christianity really is. He never saw the other half (the Yang aspect of Christianity) and could only perceive a caricature of the half (the Yin aspect of Christianity isolated from its harmonized context) he cared to see. Any Christian who has walked long with the Lord can bear witness that -because He is the Great Lover -God is the Great Iconoclast, the Despoiler of Illusions, the One who for­bids the denial of death and holds forth the spectre of life to the unregenerate soul. 
You see, as long as we are simplistically conscious or rigidly Yang-conscious, we en­cumber our lives with stupidity. Milton's Lucifer ("Better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven") comes to mind as an example of a creature that could only think in terms of "dominate or be dominated." The psychopathology of the chaotic/unbalanced mind precludes insight into how submission

Moslems 
CHARLES LOBDELL 
features writer 

Mention the word "Islam" to your hypothetical man on the street and the word terrorism may automatically spring into his mind. Media coverage sometimes gives the impression that terrorism is an essential part of the Islamic faith. Wrong. 
Abdelkader Abdelkader and Shamusdin Tareq Muslim graduate economic students at Notre Dame, said they are frustrated about the news media and its protrayal of the Middle East and Islam. 
The biggest problem is the con­stant use in the media of the phrase "Moslem terrorist,'' as if the two were one work, said Abdelkader. The media has a habit of only showing one view of the Islamic world, the one of guns and death, he added. 
There is another world, the world of the Koran, the Moslem holy book, in which its five elements of faith are specified. 
The first is the belief in the oneness of God or "Allah." The Koran defines it as, "Say! He is God, the one and only. God the Eternal, Absolute. He begets not, nor is he begotten. And there is none like unto him." 
"To believe in the oneness of God means to obey Him and disregard all orders to disobey Him," added Abdelkader. 
Secondly, the Moslems believe in the other holy books that Allah has revelaed to his prohpets. These books include the Jewish and Christian bible. Moslems believe that the Koran, though, is the only holy book still in its pure form, and thus it is the true word of God, ac­cording to Abdelkader. 
The thrid belief is in all the pro­phets. As with the books, Jewish and Christian prophets are includ­ed in that belief. Mohammed is the last prophet and the Koran is the message revealed to him by Allah, 

Abdelkader Abdelkader. 

said Tareq. Again, the belief is that while Allah has revealed messages before, the one revealed to Moham­med is the only message still left in the pure form. 
Angels serve as mediators between men and Allah, according to Moslem faith. They carry His Word and reveal it to the prophets. The Moslem belief in the angels centers around the characteristics of infallibility and uncorruptibility that the angels supposedly possess. 
The last belief is in the Day of Judgement. "He will give the true believers their due reward in the Paradise and He will punish the disbelievers in Hell,'' said Tareq. "Because many oppressors die before they get their punishment and many oppressed people die before they get their just right, the hereafter, for the Moslems, is the perios during which each will get his just reward." 
The Islamic definition of faith is composed of three elements, accor­ding to Abdelkader. "It is a creed in the elements, according to Abdelkader. "It is a creed in the heart, it is a word said by the tongue, and it is a practice in the behavior." 
"Faith means the sincerity of Allah in the worship. A believer 
. does something in the cause of 
Allah because he loves it, because 
he is satisfied by it, and not because 
he wants to show off or gain any 
personal benefits." 
"It is your tongue that expresses 
your beliefs and thoughts to others. 
You may know the truth, but this 
truth will stay unknown to the 
others until you tell them about it 
by yourtongue." 
Abdelkader further stated, "You 
need to practice what you believe in 
your heart and what you say to 
others by the tongue. The practice 
is the true test of your faith." 
There are over 20 Moslem 
students on campus and over 60 
families in the area. Moslem ser­
vices are held every Friday at Bulla 
Shed on Bulla Street (between the 
d-2 and c-2 parking lots) at 12:30 
p.m., with a discussion session that 
evening at 8. Arabic lessons are 
held every week at the community 
center on Cripe street. And once a 
month the families get together for 
a social gathering and prayer.

ND baseball team opens spring, travels to face Hoosiers on Sunday 
Chenail and Brad Cross have the tentative nods for this Sunday's doubleheader, although Gallo plans to use as many hurlers as he can. 
"If I've got somebody out on the mound Sunday who's hot, I'm go­ing to stick with him," said Gallo. "We're going to try to win these games." 
The loss of Buster Lopes and Joe Dobosh to graduation has left the team with some holes on the pit­ching staff. Chenail, a sophomore, posted a 4-0 record with a 3.22 ERA, lowest on the staff, and is hoped to build on those numbers this season. Cross, a senior, had the second-lowest ERA (4.43) in primarily relief duty last season. 
Joining Chenail and Cross on the mound this weekend will be seniors Steve Powell and Mark Watzke. Powell had 29 strikeouts last season and finished 6-4 overall, while Wat­zke 2-2 in 1985, surrendered just 38 hits. Freshman Derek Madden, drafted by the Minnesota Twins last June, is expected to add to the Irish mound strength. Gallo is counting on some new faces to deepen the staff, and many of the freshmen have already put in some innings in the fall. 
Indiana should prove a for­midable opponent. The Hoosiers feature strong hitting and have a host of returning players. Last year's games at Jake Klein Field were rained out, and the 1984 team split a doubleheader in Bloom­ington. The Hoosiers, who like Notre Dame are playing a few games before a spring trip, had to cancel a game yesterday at home. 
Three days at DePauw will follow next week for the Irish, who will play their home opener against St. Joseph's on St. Patrick's Day.

It may not look too much like Florida right now in Indiana, but if you pay close enough attention, baseball season is just around the corner. 
The Notre Dame baseball team opens its 1986 spring season this Sunday against the Indiana Hoosiers, as the two Midwestern teams prepare to battle the elements and maybe send a message to the major leaguers in the warmer climates, telling them where real men play baseball. "We're just itching to go outside," said Irish head coach Larry Gallo, now beginning his sixth year at the team's helm. "We're going batty playing inside every day." 
Batty or not, the Irish skipper holds an attitude of "cautious op­timism" when it comes to discuss­ing his team's chances for a suc­cessful season. Gallo and the Irish will be hoping to improve on last year's 26-27-2 overall mark and an inconsistent fall campaign that left the team at 5-11. 
Sunday's doubleheader in Bloomington is just the first of many difficult games in the coming season. The 1986 schedule features five teams from the Big Ten, a spr­ing break road trip to the California-Riverside Invitational Tournament and games against Oral Roberts and Houston. 
Notre Dame will play Sunday without the services of co-captain and starting shortstop Tom Shields and starting catcher Mike McNeill. Sheilds, whose .321 batting average, 40 RBI, 125 assists and 13 stolen bases last season got him drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates last June, will miss the season opener because of a combination of the flu and a shoulder injury. 
Shields, a senior from Devon, Penn., should be a key player in the Irish quest for a playoff berth. He and co-captain Rich Vanthournout are hoped to fill in for last year's devastating duo of Mike Trudeau (.366, 47 RBI) and Jack Moran (.314, 10 doubles). Vanthournout, the starting third basemen, is a first-team academic all-American, led last year's team in hits (68), hit at a .345 clip and scored 53 runs. The two seniors anchor the left side of the Irish infield. McNeill, who started the majority of the fall season behind the plate for the Irish, is still playing for the hockey team. Fellow sophomore Pat O'Brien will fill in Sunday, and sophomores Chris Flynn and Craig Pavlina promise to make the cat­ching position one of the more competitive spots this spring. 
Sophomore Tim Hutson and junior Ray Szajko will be roaming the right side of the infield at first and second base, respectively. Sza­jko's .313 batting average and three stolen bases last fall helped him emerge as the starting second baseman, but with the recovery of 

LarryUal/o 
Steve Skupien's ankle, Gallo plans to divide the time at second base. 
The outfield is perhaps the strongest and deepest aspect of the squad. The junior trio of Kenny Soos, Scott Rogers and John Loughran will lead the team. Loughran's .359 mark in 1985 leads all of the returning Irish players at the plate. 
"I'm not worried about our out­field because we have a very solid crew," said Gallo. "If we lose one of the hot gloves we've got out there, there are several qualified backups.'~ Steve Noll, John Flanagan, Pete Gutrich and Pat Pesavento will add to the Notre Dame bench strength in the field. 
The biggest question in the preseason is pitching. Kevin

Freshman works hard 
Schmitz leads Notre Dame swim team in his first year 
By BOB KEMPER 
Sports Writer 
Bill Schmitz is certainly a dif­ferent breed of cat. Dubbed "Bill the Cat" by a fellow member of the Notre Dame swimming team, the freshman from Zahm Hall displays qualities uncommon for an athlete in his first year of collegiate com­petition. Schmitz balances leader­ship ability with modesty in a most admirable manner. 
To measure Bill Schmitz's con­tribution to the swim team thus far, one needs only to glance at the results from the Feb. 27 Midwestern Collegiate Conference championship meet. In the meet's first event, the 500-yard freestyle, Schmitz took first place with a time of 4:47.01. In addition to scoring valuable first-place points, he set the precedent for the entire meet and let the other teams know that Notre Dame was a force to be reckoned with. 
Schmitz and the Irish will be in Chicago for the for the Midwest In­vitational, which runs from tomor­row until Saturday. 
"Bill is a very good distance freestyle swimmer and it is safe to say that in the next few years he will be an excellent one," said Irish coach Tim Welsh. "I am very en­thusiastic about his potential." 
Welsh noted that Notre Dame is fortunate to have landed such a gifted swimmer since it was a toss­up between Notre Dame and Duke University until the end. 
"Coach Stark (Notre Dame's previous coach) didn't recruit much," Schmitz said. "I was put on a mailing list and that was about the extent of it. Duke, on the other hand, was much more aggressive." 
A combination of factors led to 
his decision to attend Notre Dame, though, not the least of which is that his father is an alumnus. 
"I grew up hearing about Notre Dame," he said, "and it's difficult to avoid getting caught up in the tradition. In addition, I knew that they were building the new pool and could sense that the swimming program would change for the bet­ter." 
Schmitz noted that the team's success so far has indeed surpassed his expectations, and he is quick to laud his coach. "Coach Welsh has really intensified this program. We have improved so much over the course of this year. It's amazing. 
"The training is a lot different from what I did in high school. It involves much more distance work. If my high school coach would have said we were going to have a 5000-yard sprint for time, I would have told him he was crazy. But here it seems normal. Coach Welsh really knows what he is doing." 
When asked about his expecta­tions for upcoming seasons, his response is paradoxical. 
"I believe that my times will con­tinue to improve but I'm not sure if I will place as high next year," he said. "This is our last year in the MCC. We hope to get in a con­ference with St. Bonaventure, Cleveland State, Villanova, Syracuse and a few other teams. That would be a much tougher con­ference than the one that we are in now." 
With the times that Schmitz posted in the conference champion­ship meet, the Northfield, Minn. native qualified for the 500, 1 ,650, and possibly the 200-yard freestyle events in tomorrow's meet. The ever-humble Schmitz was reluctant to admit that he hopes to set a University record in the 1,650 yard event.

Welsh really helps." "It's something new and different to be first and lead a lane," he said. "In high school I swam with a teammate who was a double-state champion and another who is a Division III national champion now. And we all three swam the same events." 
Aside from being an excellent swimmer for the Irish, Schmitz is also trying his hand in recruiting. He has a younger sister, Martha, who is also an accomplished swim­mer and occasionally he makes an attempt at pursuading her to attend Notre Dame. 
"We're trying to keep it in the family," he said, "but my mother is not too happy about it. She went to Northwestern." 
Why is Bill Schmitz so sold on Notre Dame? 

"It's the family atmosphere," he explained. "It seems that many peo­ple have brothers and sisters or parents who have gone here, and the Notre Dame family extends to teammates and fellow students."

Tennis team grabs 2nd in tournatnent in Iowa 
By PETE SKIKO 
Spo~s Writer 
The Notre Dame men's tennis team invaded Iowa this weekend and captured second place in a four-team quadrangular at Iowa City. 
The Irish started slowly, losing 7­2 to the Huskies of Northern Il­linois in the opening round of play, 
but  rebounded  strongly  by  
dominating  Iowa State, 7-2,  and  
Iowa, 6-3.  

The team was led by freshmen Brian Kalbas and Tim Carr who played second and third singles, respectively. Each went undefeated on the weekend, and each won mat­ches against Northern Illinois in dramatic fashion. Carr was down a match point in the third set of his match before rallying to take the set in a tiebreaker. Kalbas trailed 5­2 in the third set against his oppo­nent before taking the next five games en route to a 6-2, 2-6, 7-5 victory. 
"I thought everyone played well throughout the whole meet," said Carr. "I felt we really should have beaten Northern Illinois -almost every match went to three sets." Six of the nine Irish matches went to three sets against the Huskies, the eventual winners of the meet. 
"If we could have played them (Northern Illinois) last, things might have been different," Carr continued. "Everyone played better as the weekend went on, and we

diana)." 
Cahill was 2-1 on the weekend, and this was his first singles action of the year. 
Sophomore Dan Walsh, who played number-one singles for the Irish in the meet, was also happy with the results. Walsh went 1-2 for the quadrangular, but lost two tough three-setters to Northern Il­linois and Iowa. 
"Kalbas and Carr had just super weekends," said Walsh. "We have a young team, and I'd say we're com­ing along really well. We got some tough breaks wi.th the three-setters over the weekend, but overall it was a good meet." 
The top six singles spots con­sisted of two sophomores and four freshmen. Senior Joe Nelligan, who would have normally filled a singles position, played only doubles over the weekend because of a sore knee.

"She definitely has the credentials. She has good speed, quickness, tremen­dous shooting ability and has really sharpened her defensive skills. "Her mere presence on the floor really has an impact on the team.  "I decided right before the sec­tionals in my senior year at Marion that I would come to Notre Dame.

Sorin utilizes fast-break offense, captures IH title with 63-54 victory 
By FRANK HUEMMER 
Sports Writer 

The 1986 A-league interhall basketball crown belongs to Sarin Hall. Sorin used a devastating fast-break offense to upend an in­spired Grace team, 63-54, and end Grace's Cinderella season before a full house in the ACC's pit. 
Grace coach Paul Derwent was pleased with his team's effort despite the loss. 
"We came out there knowing that we would be outsized and played quite hard," said Derwent. "We just did not have enough to win the game." 
Sorin coach Pat Collins also gave Grace credit for its play in the con­test. 
"Grace is a talented team and has good shooters," he said. "That's how they beat Morrissey, Alumni, and Planner. They were not going to roll over and die when we got the big lead. They just kept coming back at us." 
Chris Nanni led the way for the Sorin Otters in the victory as he hit for 20 points, many of which came off dazzling assists from teammate Collins. Meanwhile, Steve Takach used a soft touch from the outside and some power on the inside to pace Grace with 17 points. 
The game began with Sorin tak­ing complete command by poun­ding the ball inside as Rich DiBer­nardo scored the first six points of the game. After teammate Steve Buerlein tacked on a three-point play, Sorin had a quick 9-0 lead. Grace, however, would fight back: 
After Sorin had stretched the lead to 10 on a basket by Mike Scotty, Grace's Dan McGrath scored his team's final four points, the last coming on a breakaway layup with eight seconds to go, to closethegapto 17-9. 
Grace made a strong run to begin the second quarter, alrgely on the strength of Takach's six points, and tied the score at 17 with 5: 39 to go. After a Sorin timeout, the Otters came right back with an eight-point run of their own which was culminated by two Beuerlein free throws. 
Grace closed the margin to within four at 27-23 as Joe Hills tipped in a shot with 24 seconds left. That is how it remained at the half as Sorin was paced by Andy Heck and DiBernardo's six points while Takach's eight led Grace. 
The second half saw Grace take its first lead of the game at 29-28 on a basket by Takach, but that is where Sarin really turned up its fast-break offense and got it rolling in high gear. A couple of nifty passes from Collins to Nanni got things on track and soon the lead was 10 at 41-31. 
Grace cut the lead to six at the quarter by scoring the final four points. Sorin, however, wasted no time in the final period and built a 12-point advantage at 47-35. With 
2:47 remaining, they still held a 10 point lead. 
Grace refused to quit and closed to within 51-46 on a basket by Ralph Ferrara with 1:39 to go. After trading hoops, Ferrara's three-point play trimmed Sorin's lead to three at 55-52. 
That was as close as Grace would get as some clutch free throws by Nanni nailed the coffin on Grace's season. However, as Derwent said, it was a very good season indeed. 
"I was very proud of this year's team," said Derwent. "We had only two players returning from last year's team and we started out quite slowly but we got better. In the tournament we played as well as we did all year."
