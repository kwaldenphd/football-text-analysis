A former General Motors Corp. stenographer who said she was fired after dropping an idea on equality for women into a com· pany suggestion box has been awarded Sll9,985 in damages and back pay. Cynthia King, 25, won the award Tuesday in Wayne County Circuit Court, six years after her dismissal She said that in 1976 she suggested that since all male GM executives were addressed as "mister" by the women in her office, the stenographers and secretaries should be addressed with a courtesy title by the men. She also noted that men's nameplates bore their first two initials and last names, while the women's nameplates had first and last names. GM said in court that Ms. King's work had been unsatisfactory and there was no evidence ofse: discrimination, and it would appeal. ­

A Breen-Phillipshall monitor looked out the window at 3:10 a.m. yesterday and saw two young black males stealing bikes between B-P and Farley. A chase ensued and one of the suspects, aged 16, was apprehended at the Athletic and Convocation Center after a brief struggle. The suspect was holding a bag containing bolt cutters. The security report lists two students as complaintants in the case. Security still has a confisuted bike which is registered in Batavia, N.Y. Two students informed the monitor of the thefts and assisted in the cooperative effort to capture the thiefs. Security urges

Three UniversityofMassachusetts freshmen were killed when their compact car swerved into the wrong lane and struck a utility pole, which sliced through the car. Police Chief Donald Mala said speeding appeared to be the cause of the crash Wednesday night. He said autopsies and blood tests would be conducted to check for alcohol consumption. Officer Jim Jackson identified the dead as driver Patrick Farmer of Amherst, Meg Dolan of North Quincy and Brigitte Judge of Minneapolis. All were 20 and were to begin classes next week. "It was the most tragic accident ever here. We have never had three people die in a crash," Mala said yesterday.

A Saudi billionairewho lives in Miami and has a reputa· 
tion for spreading around his money has been invited to visit 
Cleveland by unanimous vote ofthe City Council. Shiek Mohammed 
ai-Fassi, 27, has said he will gladly visit any city which invites him, so 
the council passed the measure Tuesday night. "I don't think we can 
be so arrogant as to turn up our noses to someone seeking our 
friendship," said Councilman Gary Kucinich, a sponsor ofthe resolu· 
tion. 'James Neff, a columnist for The Plain Dealer, wrote in the 
newspaper's editions yesterday that he contacted Fassi, who said, "I 
am going to listen to my advisers and do it right away, because I am 
aware of the problems Cleveland has. We are going to take serious 
action in Cleveland, Ohio. I will buy a home there and have a place to 
rest and relax when I come there to check my investments." Fassi 
intends to donate up to S 100,000 to the city and invest a few million 
in local industry, Neff said. -AP 
Former astronautJames Irwin, just back from a fruitless ground search for Noah's Ark, says he may return to Turkey's Mount Ararat this month and make an aerial search. Irwin talked ofhis plans at a news conference at his office at High Flight, the Christian evan­gelical foundation that sponsored his trip. 'He wore a baseball cap to hide scars and shaved head resulting fm injuries suffered in a fall on the mountain. He lost four teeth and had surgery above his right eye and sutures on his scalp. "I still feel weak and have to take medica· tion, but I'm anxious to return to Turkey if it is possible," he said. He said he believes the ark is somewhere at the 14,000-foot level and could be discovered from a helicopter or high-altitude airplane. Bad weai:her prevented an aerial search in August, Irwin said. The 11-day expedition cost about SSO,OOO and Irwin said most of the money was donated by friends from Germany. -AP

Spirit of a Nation 
As Notre Dame's first night footbaU game approaches, 
with all the accompanying fanfare and controversy, and 
as news reports fill with allegations of code violations 
by colleges, athletes and coaches, ilt's time to examine 
the role ofsport in our lives. 
Moses Malone has just signed an "offer sheet" to play basketball with the Philadelphia 76,ers for ten times as much money each year as the president of our nation makes; Pete Rozelle, commissioner ofthe NFL, is trying to rewrite the nation's anti-trust legislation; the Univer­sity ofSan Francisco has dropped its ll>asketball program after years of NCAA investigations and penalties; and convicts are set free -as long as they are blue-chip athletes to boot. 
These facts indicate an improper emphasis on sport in this country. The most frightening aspect ofall this is that it is not only on the upper levds of competition that the problem arises. Indeed, on that level, where sport becomes an entertainment business, the added emphasis is more understandable. 
The greatest cause for worry is when the same ferocity and disregard for the social order carries over to the playground level 
I must admit that I have never learned to play games in the Queensbury tradition. 
The most vile feelings I have ever harbored toward an· other human being came about in play. 
I was involved in a supposed basketball game, which was, in actuality, a shouting and shoving match. I could live with the shoving, even though I didn't like it. But in the midst of the shouting someone made a comment about a very important part of my life. 
He probably thought the 

remark funny, and I might 
have, too, except that I 
spend about 65 hours a 
week with the group he in­
sulted. Sticks and stones may break bones, but words about friends go right to the core. 
With his remark, the game had ended for me, and a war had begun. The weapons were a basketball, a bitter tongue and a harsh vocabulary; tht: warriors were ten angry men, playing a game. 
When that game was over, I couldn't shake anyone's hand. We hadn't played basketball. I thought about that for a long time. I realized how much I had been provoked by a foolish thing said in the heat ofa contest, and I wondered what could have provoked him to say the thing in the first place. 
At the time, I couldn't really understand why a playground basketball game had bt:come such a bitter conflict. 
That same day, I watched Coach Herb Brooks accept ABC-TV's Athlete of the Year Award for the entire U.S. Olympic hockey team, gold medalists at Lake Placid. 
Brooks said that the players won the award through a unity of purpose and action, adding that their success was indicative ofthe "work ethic th:at made (the United

I apologize to any who might be offended, but that sentiment scares me to death. What happened to games? 
What madness drives us to this? Is it really the spirit that made a nation great that sets that nation aflame be· cause twenty young men play a game better than twenty young foreigners? 
Yes, I know that it was a beautiful moment when the underdog U.S. team won the gold medal before a nation of admirers -I know the high emotion that can be evoked by a single victory. 
Still, what have we done to games? Who plays in a nation that believes a hockey team reflects the work ethic that brought that country international 
prominence? 

The absence of play is everywhere in evidence: 
Do 
we really care that East Germany wins more Olympic medals than the United States? The athletes and committees constantly clamoring for U.S. training setups similar to the East Germans really care -they don't lose games, they lose face for their country in the eyes ofthe world. 

Is 
it really important that the Fighting Irish have not won an NCAA basketball title despite nearly a decade of tourney appearances (except for last year)? The critics find this record to be 


a major failure of Digger Phelps' coaching tenure. It is not sufficient to come and see; one must also conquer. Heaven forbid that the football team should win less than half its games. 
 Has Bookstore Basketball come ofage when players pout and moan to the point ofejection from the tourna­ment, when fans hound a referee and when an an­nouncer humiliates a player who has supposedly "choked?" Maybe Bookstore is bigger than we think, as Observer writers have suggested -maybe it reflects the attitude that made America great. 
Perhaps the connection between my loss of temper and a nation's attitude toward sport is tenuous, but I fear that it is not. I fear that we are a nation weaned on com­petition and bred for contention. I fear that it is not the constructive aspect of this attitude that prevails. I fear, too, that the point is too old md the subject too belabored for anyone to heed me. 
More importantly, I fear that there will come a time when I will not be able to control this "spirit ofa nation" that burns within me.

Judge finds crime preventton tmportant 
By KATHLEEN DOYLE 
SeniorStaffReporter 
Prevention is amore effective and 
less costly method of dealing with 
juvenile crime and delinquency, 
according to john Gonas, former 
judge of the juvenile court in South 
Bend. 
In 1955, during his term as judge, 
Gonas was invited to participate in 
the United Nations World Con­
ference on Juvenile Crime and 
Delinquency in Geneva, Switzer­
land. The objective of the con­
ference was to develop a preventive 
program that would deter the· 
juvenile crime that all countries 
were facing. Gonas returned to 
South Bend after the conferen.;:e and 
unofficially started the newly­
formed program in St. Joseph 
County after personally training 25 
co-workers. 
After the prevention program was implemented, the Health, Educa­tion, and Welfare Department analyzed the crime rate in eight In­diana counties. When the crime rate of St. Joseph County was compared to that of Adam County, a county similar in size, it appeared that the prevention program had decreased juvenile crime. At one point in Gonas' term, Adam County reported 501 juvenile offenses while St. Joseph County reported a mere 63. 
The prevention programs Gonas

utilized included a follow-up on 
truancy reports and a unique educa­
tional course for parents of juvenile 
offenders. These programs and 
others were discontinued when 
Gonas left office. 
"It costs the taxt>ayers 520,000 per year to maintain a juvenile offen­der in reform school," Gonas said. "Nine out of ten of these will go to prison later, after leaving reform . school. Prevention is a less ex­pensive and more effective method of dealing with juvenile delin­quency." 
Gonas is now attempting to obtain national publicity for prevention programs. He has appeared on local television shows and will soon be speaking on a show in Scranton, Pennsylvania. 
A frequent lecturer in sociology classes at Notre Dame and St. Mary's, Ganas has written two books on juvenile delinquency, The Chi/a ana the Court. and Delinquency: There's. an Answer. He is currently working on a third book, Over Fifty Years in Politics.

Before AT&T Breakup 
Consumersfa~e higher bills 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Con­sumers across the country are facing the prospect of sharply higher local telephone bills -in some cases more than a doubling -even before many local telephone companies count the cost ofseparatingfrom the Bell System. 
A survey by The Associated Press 
has found what appears to be a 
record dollar amount ofrate hike re­
quests now pending before state 
utility commissions -an estimated 
$6.2 billion in annual revenues. 
Telephone trade groups and 
regulators believe that's a record to­
tal, though suchshifting statistics are 
difficult to tabulate. Rate increases 
Teenager guiltyin Boston 
BOSTON (AP)-A black couple 
testified yesterday that a white 
teenager under court order not to 
harass his black neighbors exposed 
himself, urinated and made obscene 
gestures at them. 
The state asked Suffolk Superior 
Court Chief justice james Lynch to 
find Michael Gaine, 18, of Boston, in 
contempt of court. Prosecutors 
sought a $1,000 fine and asix-month 
jail sentence. 
Gaine was one of eight white 
youths who consented to an Aug. 19 
court order forbidding them from 
harassing blacks in the racially 
troubled blue-collar neighborhood· 
ofRoss Field. 
Describing the events on Aug. 22, 
Charles and Bertha Brooks and a 
friend, Debra L. Stewart, said they 
were standing in the Brooks' yard 
when Gaine slowly passed by and 
looked at them, then joined a group 
of young men and women in the 
park. The witnesses said Gaine came 
back toward them and stood in the 
park about 25 yards away, where he 
he exposed himself, gestured and 
shouted, "Hey, Bertha." 
Mrs. Brooks said Gaine's voice 
"was loud, 'nasty, mean and full of 
hate." 
The court order forbidding 
harassment was the first test of the 
civil provisions of the state's 1980 
Civil Rights Act. The case was 
brought July 9 by the state attorney 
general's office on behalf of several 
black families who claimed they had 
been harassed by the men. 
Lynch's order forbids the youths 
from stoning, firebombing or other­
wise intimidating their black neigh­bors. It also prevents them from meeting each other for one year in . certain sections of the neighbor­
hood.

are pending in more than 30 states, and most were filed without con­sideration of increased costs that may occur in 1984 when American Telephone & Telegraph Co. will spin offits 22 operating companies. 
Many experts expect a new spurt of rate increases then, but con· sumers will not have to wait that long before paying higher bills. Con­sider: 
The Bell System companies now owned by AT&T have requested or announced their intention to re­quest a total of 54.82 billion in addi· tiona! annual revenue. 
According to AT&T spokesman Pic Wagner, the Bell companies could have rate requests pending at any one time in 48 states plus the District ofColumbia As ofthe end of August, Wagner says rate cases were 
pending in 31 states. 
Two local companies in which AT&T is a minority owner -the Southern New England Telephone 
·Co. and Cincinnati Bell -have rate requests that total S164 million. 
The Gneral Telephone & Electronics Corp. (GTE), the na­tion's second largest telephone company, says its subsidiaries have requested or announced their inten­
tion to request $759.7 million in ad­ditional annual revenue from consumers in 1 0 states. 
Reports from state utility com­missions and from the U.S. Inde­pendent Telephone Association indicate roughly $412 million worth 
· of rate hikes filed by other non-Bell 
phone companies are still pending. 
That is despite the approval of an 
estimated $312 million worth of 
rate hikes for _independent 
telephone companies during the 
first six months of 1982, according 
to Henry Wieland, a spokesman for 
the independent telephone associa­
tion. 

"While I can't speakfrom personal 
knowledge, I think it's a supportable 
conclusion that the rate requests 
now pending across the country 
represent a record," said Eric 
Schneidewind, the chairman of the 
public service commission in Michi­
gan. 

"We have been saying for some time that the decisions being reachect in Washington would result in very, very sharp increases in basic local rates," added John Bryson, the chairman of the public service com­mission in California "And that's what is happening."

Inadequate? 

Repairs nearly completed 
ByJOHN BRESLIN 
News Staff 
As Hunziker Landscaping Inc. prepares to complete work in front of Fitzpatrick Hall, opinions vary as to the quality of the work done beneath the dirt. Leaks which have plagued the engineering hall since its completion in 1979 appear thoroughly sealed and ready for the rain. 
The leaks have caused damage to ceiling tiles and equipment in Fitzpatrick's two underground levels. According to James Carberry, professor of chemical engineering, "We've had pots and pans all over the place" in an effort to soak up the leakage. 
A shelf of water lies beneath the building, and Carberry says Ellerbe Architects thought it unnecessary to place a seal between Fitzpatrick and -t-his water leveL During heavy rains, water creeps up along the building and seeps into cracks in the under­ground levels. Assistant Dean of Engineering W.B. Berry says that in­ternal downspouts spanning the walls of the building were designed to remove rain from the roofand in­to the drainage system. 
During wint~r months water would melt off the roof and into the downspouts. Here the water would again freeze, cracking the spouts. Debris from Fitzpatrick's roof also clogged these vital waterways. In heavy storms, rain would then pour off the roof onto the ground in front of the building. A lack of adequate:· drainage left only Fitzpatrick's un-­derground roofto absorb this water. "Laboratory work was very difficuh while water dripped down on preci­sion equipment," noted engineering professorJJ Marley. 
· This summer, workers insulated the underground roof with three inches of rubber and styrofoan1­sheets. New drains had to be placed in front of Fitzpatrick since "th~ water was just sitting here,'' remarked Scott Stewart, landscaper for the project. Excess water will sity.

Financiers fear global lending crisis 
TORONTO (AP)-Fears ofan in­
ternational lending crisis haunt a 
week of talks by finance ministers 
and bankers gathered from across 
the globe in search of economic 
cures to the worldwide recession. 
The occasion is the 37th annual 
meeting ofthe two major world len­
ding organizations, the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
Economic leaders from more than 
140 nations are expected to attend 
sessions which get underway this 
weekend. 
The mood is grim. Grim about a deteriorating economic outlook for rich and poor nations alike; about mounting financial strains on the world's most indebted countries; about a widening rift between the United States and its allies over 1 --A· economic policies and rela­
tions with the Soviet Union. 
The main dispute at the formal meetings involves money: how much in new loans other countries can extract from the United States and how little the United States can get away with contributing to the IMF and World Bank 
Informal discussions will focus on 
the threats the international banking 
system faces from a growmg list or 
troubled debtors unable to meet 
payments on their multi-billion­
dollar debts, such as Mexico, Argen­
tina, Poland and Cuba. 

"Obviously, there is danger in the banking system at this point until such time as these problems can be worked out," concedes U.S. Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, who is heading the American delega­tion along with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker. 
In regards to the emergency aid plans that private and government lenders ae negotiating witJ:l troubled countries to avert defaults that could trigger a crisis, Regan said, "We're hopeful they can be handled and they can be worked out." 
Regan also noted that inflation is easing in the industrial countries, prices for imported oil have sof­tened, interest rates in the United States have fallen sharply and prospects are brighter for much im­proved economic growth in the in­dustrial nations next year. 
The IMF and World Bank do not see as many silver linings on the economic horizon. In their latest an­nual reports, thev nnred that tiPltt­money policies adopted by tne industrial countries to combat infla­tion have produced the longest world economic slump since the 1930s, high unemployment and steep interest rates. 
Anxiety about the longer-term economic outlook has been heightened by recent short-term financial crises.

f'CC begins debate on cable systetns 
wASHINGTON (Ap) _ Nobody 
, knows whether average Americans will ever prefer "reading" their TV sets instead of a newspaper, but the federal government may decide soon how such a system would work. 
With little public fanfare, a debate has begun at the Federal Com­munications Commission that could determine whether electronic in­formation services can be offered by broadcasters as well as cable TV operators and newspaper publis­hers. 
The issue is deceptively simple: can broadcasters demand that their electronic information services be carried by local cable systems? 
The answer may be crucial, however, because broadcasters maintain they can hardly be ex­pected to enter the electronic publishing business if the rapidly growing cable industry can deny them an audience. 
The broadcasters suggest a con­sumer who subscribes to ca'>le is not likely to go to the trouble oferecting or !llaintaining an antenna just to receive an electronic information service over the a1r. 
An electronic publishing service is one m which information -from news to airline sl·hedules to 
'Loc~lLegend' dies in lVIinnesota woods 
ELY. \finn. (AP) -The purr of 
outboard motors broke the stillness 
of Ottertrack Lake for the fir>St time 
in years yesterday as friends 
gathered for the funeral of Benny 
:\mbro:.e, a prospector and 
woodsman who died a local legend 
at age 82. 
The U.S. Forest Service bent its rules to allow motorboats into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area for memorial services for Ambrose, one 
of the last two people who lived on the 22 miles of wilderness water­ways in northeastern Minnesota. 
Ambrose's ashes were buried on the peninsula where he lived alone in a one-room cabin on Ottertrack Lake in sight of Canada, about 40 miles northeast ofEly.

Ambrose. a well-known ..trea guide. trapper and prospector. was found dead Friday by Forest Service rangers next to the burned-out remains ofa canvas shelter where he cooked in the summer. His body was taken to Ely, where it was cremated. 
The cause of death is unknown, but officials think Ambrose, a wiry, lean man with a stubble ofbeard, suf­fered a heart attack. 
"He was the kind ofguy who at 40 degrees below zero would come out of the woods with his wool shirt un­buttoned down to the waist," said Bruce Kerfoot, a local resident. "He was as rough and tough as they come."

There a~e tw~ different types. If 
the serv1ce IS one-way and 
transmitted by broadcasters on an 
unused portion ofthe normal TV sig­nal, it's known as teletext. If the service is transmitted via cable TV or telephone lines and is two-way ­meaning consumers can respond to the information they receive by answering questions or ordering merchandise, for example -the service is known as videotext. 
Videotext, with its two-way capability, is often viewed as an in­evitable winner over teletext. But a teletext system is normally cheaper to build and operate, and it might be years before consumers are com­fortable with the idea ofshopping or banking at home via videotext. 
The teletext-videotext battle can not get underway, however, until the FCC authorizes teletext service and answers a number of policy issues, including the cable question. Agency officials have begun review­ing written comments submitted earlier this year and a top staffer who asks not to be identified says a ruling should he made before the end of the year.

PAP said Piotr Sadowski, 22, of Gdansk, died after he "fell in the street" during Tuesday's riots. It said an autopsy "sh9wed features ofsud­den death, but no bodily injuries which could have caused death." 
It said rioters were being fined from the equivalent of S62 to H80, or sentenced to up to 90 day~ in jail. The average worker receives the equivalent ofabout S90 a. month.

The Semantics of Proliferation 
"Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind." Shakespeare, King Lear 
The military-industrial complex of this country has always relied on its own brand of newspeak in propagandizing the benefits of nuclear proliferation. In recent years, 
Patrick Mulligan 
Divided Line 

however, the bombastic jargon has assumed a more disturbing dimension. The manifesta­tions ofthis rhetorical campaign abound in all communicative modes. Essentially it is an at­tempt to conceal the horrific consequences of nuclear conflagration behind a facade of semantics. In the nuclear arms vocabulary, phrases such as 'dense pack,' 'first strike capability,' and 'limited nuclear war' have become popular designations for the un­
thinkable. 
In a subtle way, the average American is being inculcated with a nominal logic assert­ing the possibility -even desirability -of there being a 'winnable' nuclear war. By cloaking their scenarios in euphemisms, the denizens of the Pentagon hope to make the unimaginable recognizable. Perhaps the first step towards thwarting these schemes in­volves making ourselves aware of the sig· nificance ofmilitary word games. 
It must be remembered that we are not 
dealing with those who comprehend the ian· 
guage of shared humaniry. The military­
industrial complex has created its own 
linguistic constructs which exist outside the 
realm of human reason. The situation may be 
best described as an ossification of the im­
agination. In Pentagon-esc, statistics replace 
individuals on all levels. Twenry million 
casualties becomes 'an acceptable figure' ifwe 
can annihilate one hundred million commies. 
For the Pentagon tacticians, sheer numbers shield them from images of sizzling flesh and melting eyeballs. The notion that all moral anchors would be swept away in the after· math of_a nuclear exchange does not compute in Pentagon attack formulas. The numerical mentality absorbs all human sensibiliry; it is like a black hole which renders all humanistic considerations meaningless. 
Above all, the semantics of proliferation proclaim the gospel of quantiry. Already we have stockpiled enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world several times over. As the hundreds of megatons and millions of dead become more incomprehensible, the strategies of nuclear war become logistically plausible. Indeed, the reification of whole populaces lends credibiliry to the Pentagon's cavalier approach to nuclear holocaust. 
Should anyone doubt the validiry of these assumptions, let him consider the incon· grouos events ofthe past year alone. The Navy christened a nuclear weapon-laden sub· marine 'Corpus Christi.' The Army com­memorated the thirty-seventh anniversary of Hiroshima by detonating hydrogen bombs in the New Mexican desert. And Edwin Meese revealed his longrunning joke with Caspar Weinberger: they call the MX missile 'the Hal­lmark,' because they 'care enough to send the best.' Upon hearing such inanities one can only be filled with rage and despair and numb­ness. The arrogance implicit in their insen· 
sitiviry derides the aspirations of all mankind. This gung-ho militarism rejects all notons of social amelioration at the behest of nuclear hegemony. 
Perhaps what is most vile about this phenomenom is the alienation of human con­cerns, of human involvement, of human pos­sibilities. The military's utilitarian assessment of nuclear war represents a ilib dismissal of the sacredness oflife. Rather than acknowl­edge the responsibilities of being human, the propagators of nuclear semantics· use Jan-· guage as a means ofobscuring their apocalyp­tic designs. 
We must raze the verbal edifices of the military-industrial complex. If we become immured with the linguistic banalities of nuclear militarism we are lost. You see, the frightening thing about the Pentagon lunatics is that they are lucid in their self-contained logic. Lucid lunatics -even they might ap­preciate that term.

Notre Dame: the best and the worst 
It seems that most of the issues at Notre Dame that have attracted a great deal of con­troversy among both the students and the faculry -such as parietals, the "keg rule", tenure proceedures, etc. -have all been thoroughly covered by now. It is redundant to cover these same issues over and over again, and I really believe that after a certain point, editorials in the newspaper that rail against issues which the administration refuses to face only beats a dead hoi~e, so to speak. Yet, editorials, by their very nature are "political statements," and an editorialist should address issues that are "politically relevant" to those who read them. 
Robert lloyd Snyder 

Friday 

I do not truly consider myself a "political person," nor do I have much interest in "saving the world." My intent in writing this column is to ask those questions which many of us have asked ourselves, but have failed to see in print. Hopefully, I can speak to those at Notre Dame who deeply appreciate the op· portunities that this institution has to offer, but who are also concerned enough about what Notre Dame, as a Catholic establishment of"higher education," should and can be. 
Bear with me. I'm new at this. 
As with most upper~lassmen, lthlnk,-the realization that I had actually returned to this campus did not hit me at first, even though I ·had already moved into my room and was well about my rounds of seeing old friends. Every year, Notre Dame seems brand new; I can still remember the first time I visited this campus as an 8-year-old with my parents. To them, 
Notre Dame stood as an ultimate Catholic 
goal, a place that I would eventually graduate 
to after years ofmaturation, studious prepara­
tion, and hope. _ 
-Each autumn,_ ind(!ed,J also find the exodus from my home in Dallas to South Bend to be a Somewhat mind-boggling experience. I am al­ways anxious to confront the challanges that lie ahead, and to meet new people that I would not otherwise encounter. I met thefirst person I ever knew from Montana at Notre Dame. My first roommate was from Arizona. My girlfriend is from Canada. Back in Dallas, I was unsure that these places existed other than on maps. 
I feel that Notre Dame has allowed me to do 
things that J believe to be impossible anywhere else. Notre Dame, I feel, is a place where the best of all worlds co-exists side by side with many of the more unpleasant facets of life. It is a unique place, with the cor­responding unique problems that arise from having a student body that is 90 percent white Catholics and an incredibly ambitious athletic program. I am extremely proud ofthe fact that I am a member ofits student body. 
Yet there is a dark side to th~ nature of Notre Dame and her student body, a side that I feel is undeserving of the ideals which Notre Dame is supposedly established upon. 
Notre Dame is located in South Bend. This is an unalterable fact, and I have long chosen to stop decrying this town; however, there is a problem that arises from the vacuum of off· campus social activities, the age liq~itations in· herent to social activity at Notre Dame, and the seeming indifference of the universiry's administration to the problems ofsocial life at Notre Dame. This problem is the ease with which a good deal of students fall into al­coholism and alcohol abuse. I realize that this problem exists almost anywhere that one may travel in this country, but I feel that I have never witnessed alcoholism to such an extent as I have seen at Notre Dame. It is especially painful to see wholescale personaliry changes in one's friends and schoolmates due to al· coholism. Again, not a problem unique to Notre Dame, but a problem seemingly mag­nified on this campus. 
Notre Dame is, by the nature ofits small stu­dent body, a semi-closed sociery. By the third month of evey semester, all the faces in the dining halls, Corby's, and the A.C.C. are familiar and recognizable to everyone. 
There are also problems that arise out ofthe campus environment that are unbecoming to the ideals of Notre Dame which are con· tinuously pumped into our heads. I have found it hilfd to reconcile Catholicism with the slander of individuals that I have heard in the dormitories and classrooms of Notre Dame. I find it hard to attend chapel with a clear conscience knowing that I have engaged in idle "locker-room gossip" with my friends about women who are in attendance in the very same services. It becomes difficult to keep an objective position concerning people I barely know personally when one observes the jealousy and back-biting that goes on among men and women at Notre Dame. 
At Notre Dame, fashion and individual sryle is not invented; it is duplicated. Everyone well realizes who comprises the prominent faddist community ofNotre Dame. 
I am a white Catholic-raised male. A 
majority of the Notre Dame student body is 
the same. Yet, in probably 50 percent of all 
gatherings of 3 or more males at Notre Dame, 
the term "nigger" is used for blacks, especially 
the black athletes. I believe that this is a main 
cause of the semi-segregated nature of race 
relations at Notre Dame; it is well-known that 
in the dining hall where I eat, there has tradi· 
tionally been tables for the blacks, and then ·tables for "the rest ofus." 
Moreover, there is a fairly identifiable split between most of the athletes and the non­varsity segment of the student body. Football players hang out with football players, basket· ball players with fellow basketball players, soccer players with soccer players, etc. Indeed, while it is only natural that cliques develop among people who spend a great deal of time with each other, the separation be­tween Notre Dame's scholars and scholar­athletes often ranges on the abnormal. I have seen this br-;:ed jealously within those who have dreamt of being athletes at Notre Dame, and a fearful insecuriry among the athletes who are derided as "dumb jocks." 
There are many other irritating items which are worth mention; the continuous friction between the women of Notre Dame (supposedly the "smarter women"), and the women of Saint Mary's (supposedly the "prettier" portion of this community's women); the irrational strive for the "perfect preppiness" that afflicts so much of the stu· dent body, where social status can be ac· hieved through "looking right"; or even the seemingly anti-educational attitudes that most Notre Dame students pursue a degree with, hoping to use a diploma as a golden meal ticket to an Sl8,500-a-year job and happiness in Corporateland. 
But Notre Dame has its silver lining as well. 
There are hundreds ofworthwhile people on 
this campus who are well worth knowing, 
who are individuals instead of followers, and 
who can discuss something more relevant 
than Blair Kiel's competence as the Notte 
Dame quarterback. There are numerous ac­
tivities on and off-campus that are interesting 
and worthwhile that few of us even consider, 
such as community service, or any of the 
many campus clubs. 
Chicagd is only a train ride away. There are 
hundreds of men and women between Saint 
Mary's and Notre Dame who have given up on 
the "social scene" who would thoroughly en· 
joy some.company. There are young boys and 
girls in the South Bend area who would love 
t. 
the company of a "Big Sister" or a "Big Brother." Logan Center is just 'around the cor­ner from the Football Stadium. 
What I am driving at is that there are oppor· tunities here to make Notre Dame well worthwhile. Notre Dame is a good place and a good place to be. Notre Dame also has problems that we, as individuals, can overcome if we pursue them. 
Maybe if we spent less time bitching about what Notre Dame limits us to, and spent more time realizing that the magic of Notre Dame does not have to end after a couple ofmonths ofthe school year, then we could all see Notre Dame truly become what it aspires to be. 
P.O. BoxQ  
New Senior Bar DearEditor, I was angry when I read the article en­titled "Another Exciting Year ... "written by Ryan Ver Berkmoes. In his article, Ver Berkmoes attacked the Universiry for tearing down the old Senior Bar and build­ing a new one. I think Mr. Ver Berkmoes should be aware of the facts before he writes an article. He was correct in stating that the old bar had character but failed to realize it was a fire hazard. He stated the · 'new bar possessed. the charm of a bank. . Obviously, he hasn't bothered to look inside. The new bar is the best thing that has ever happened to a senior class. It is over three times larger than the old bar which · will alleviate the crowding problem stu· dents face at other bars. People will be able .to sit in beautiful oak booths, dance on two, dance floors, and enjoy a fantastic new facility with a charm ofits own. I Granted, the old Senior Bar does have a ·lot of great memories, but instead of condemning the University for building the students an excellent new faciliry,let's !thank them. Sincerely, Kevin Woods General Manager Alumni-SeniorClub

The melancholy Irish 
A ndrew Greeley, whom Ido not know, mentioned in .lUnote this morning that he hears I am a melancholy Irishman. "There are other kinds?" asks Father Greeley. Wilfred Sheed says a writer wouldn't even want to go to heaven if he couldn't write about it afterwards. I feel the same way about getting letters, although I am more responsible with my mail than that. Father Greeley's question (and I hope he doesn't mind) was helpful in making me decide to write for you about my mother's death. She died in Maine ten days ago, at the age of eighty-seven. Shakspeare's Coriolanus hesitated to show his wounds before a Roman mob in the way a conquering general was expected to do, because he had

contempt for the crowd. I hesitate to smudge words on the page ofa newspaper, because I respect you so much. I have acquired a local reputation as a laureate of lonliness; and I'm sensitive about students thinking I've 
pitched my tent in the land ofsadness. In twelve years of 
writing this column, I have often told stories ofmy mot­
her. Now I want to do so as a journalistic Amen. She is 
gone, and I'm getting used to the idea. Death, when it 
came, was welcome as a friend. 
Most ofthe Irish in me comesfrom my mother. Maura (I'm relying on memory) in Synge's play, Riders to the Sea, says as an epitaph offatalism to her sons, drowned off Galway, "They are all gone now, and I can be at· · peace." Nothing as bad can happen again. Dread departs, and one can be sadly content: no more rapping on wood to keep bad luck away. No more placating Fate 
-Fate, which is not quite God, though you can't be 
sure -that can suddenly twist events into an ap­
pearance ofcosmic irony. 
My mother, if she had lost her sons, could have 
spokep Maura's lines. I could speak Maura's line about 
my mother: she is gone; be.cause she is at peace, I am at 
peace with her going. 
I was a Catholic ahead ofmy mother, but I still feel I owe my faith and vocation to her. Once again, she was Irish; Anglo-Irish, perhaps, with her father born in Lon­don. The Irish, she would remind me, are a witty race given to thick headedness, drinking, and sentimentality which can be more than a little tragic. IfI were Mary Mulkerrin's son, 1 was some ofthose things too; a little better, and a little worse offin my bloodlines than my Yankee father. The Irish, traditionally, she said, were Catholic, though not all ofthem. Our family wasn't Catholic, and neither was she; but, by good luck or bad luck, she was closer to the Church than I was. She had met priests; she recognized a scapular. She once owned a rosary, and knew the words ofthe Hail Mary. Two secrets my mother kept from my father were her resis­tance ofhis harsh opinion ofCaholics and her admira­tion for Franklin Roosevelt as president. 
She fought my becoming a Catholic, because it would hurt my father. But early on, she accepted with reluc­tat1Ce my decision to become a priest. Whatever forgiveness my father offered me in the brieftime before his death, my mother coaxed out ofhim. 
Two years after I was ordained, my mother quitely ar­ranged her own life as a Catholic, without ever telling me a word. Out ofthe Church, she was a little Catholic; inside the Church, she had Protestant leanings. She would flavor the Friday fish with a few pork scraps to give it flavor. "What's the harm ofit?" she said, when I found her doing it. The rules weren't written with a comp1on sense as big as my mother's. She never played the role ofpriest's mother. Once, when there were 
strangers in the house, she introduced me as mister. 
Never, in twenty-eight years, did she attend a Mass of 
mine. Only at her funeral, last week, did I celebrate a 
Mass in her presence, when, God love her, she was a 
captive audience. The only sacrament I ever gave her 
was an absolution, when she was close to dying, and she 
didn't know it was happening. A few minutes before, 
she had asked: "Did you call me mama?" Death wasn't 
'kind to keep her waiting so long. 
With her little Catholic grandchilren, she was mother machree. She taught them their catechism, and they said morning and evening prayers together. Her own daily prayer for all ofus, she told me, was: "Keep them from pain, and keep them from sin." The simplicity of faith could not have been surpassed in all ofGalway. My mother, in an Irish way, knew the language ofthe heart. 
"The Irish are not the only ones who are melancho­ly," Father Greeley wrote me. They certainly have a gift for it, I'm sure he would agree, with their Cathleen Manourneens and their Isle ofTralee. My mother knew about the gray Galway shore, with its churchyards where the dead had died young; because ofthe poverty, they were better offthan the living. She would mention, as a part ofstory telling on St. Patrick's day, the women and children who had died in the great hunger with green foam flecking their lips because they had tried to eat grass. She sang one or two ofthe songs ofthe men and boys who had died in war for the honor ofCathleen ni Houlihan and the Dark Rosaleen. The sufferings she had heard bout became part ofher because she was Irish, and she understood the reasons why the Irish people wept. 
Rain began to fall as we were saying the final prayers 
in a cemetery at the edge ofthe sea The Irish say a 
gentle rain blesses the dead. Maine might have been 
Galway, with the good Maine earth as the land ofsaints, 
with green hills in the distance and the sea around us as 
tricky as life itself. 
My mother's final words to my father, as she left him, 
were: "Good night, Jerry." Taking my cue from her,l 
said: "Good night, mother." 
Andrew Greeley himself, I think, might have ap­
plauded the melancholy. 


DINER: more than justa meal 
'VJhen a motion picture can in­
W troduce us to characters whose qualities and faults allow us to empathise and grow to be pretty goo9 friends with what are actually two-dimensional shadows being projected onto a screen, that motion picture has achieved its goal. Barry Levinson'sDiner is an all too rare ex­ample ofsuch a film. 
Dennis Chalifout 
movie review 

Diner describes the lives offive guyswho frequent a Baltimore diner during the last moments ofthe 1950's. The heart ofthe film is based within the dialogue these characters carry on between each other. There is no real narrative to this film perse, but several sub plots or slice-of-life set pieces which in the end, get into a thoughtful examination ofmale cameraderie. A strong narrative is made unnecessary when a director is able to intimately draw his audience into the real lives ofvital <;:haracters. Perhaps what enables Diner to succeedmore than any­thing else, is the fact that it rein­forces a theme concerning the bonds offriendship with a true bond offriendship that develops between 
the audience and its players. 
The dialogue in this film is some of the best I have ever encountered. Subjects as diverse as whetherornot one intends to finish the other halfof one's sandwich, and the inability to pay off a bookie get the equal light they do in real conversation. But 
-The CQat of mostly

them 
Levinson achieves this qualitY -witli=­out becoming petty or pointless. All these subjects get equal attention among the five friends and, in turn, 
become equally important to us. 
What is probably the most pleas­ing aspect ofDiner (among a literal salvo of"nice touches"), is its ability to achieve its humor without stoop-, ing to the lower comic book type of humor that has infiltrated most of the comedies coming out of Hol­lywood today. Many ofthe laughs that Levinson serves up seem more like inside jokes. We are able to iden­tify with the humor within the con­text ofthe film and our own lives. 

Agood example ofhow this film attempts to set itself apart from "Animal House" fare is the opening shot. A subjective camera slowly tracks into a party. live music is being played and gradually we recognize the song on the sound track -"Shout". But as the volume increases, we discover that the song isn't really being played all that well. Levinson has rightfully chosen to sacrifice the flashiness ofa Hol­lywood music number for a truer mood which may not set our toes to tapping but gives us a more honest portrayal ofhow this party is being perceived by the main characters. 
The cast ofmostly unknown young actors has been assembled with such perfection that I cannot say enough about them. Suffice it to say tha every ounce ofperformance in this film is filled to the brim with the life that makes a film great. 
I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who would like to have a good laugh, meet some interesting people, and make a few cinematic friends. Diner is truly the "smile of  the year." 

W
ith one week ofclasses behind us and minor, varied assign­
ments ofnogenuine importance except that they may be on 
an exam on some obscure day weeks from now, "play" time is in 
abundance. Besides, Saturday and Sunday are for studying, not the 
nights. Though the list ofevents is small, that is not a comment on on 
their quality. 
At the heart of the weekend activity at Notre Dame/Saint Mary's are the various social gatherings we enjoy with our friends. You may choose to do that privately or with large groups ofpeople. If you should find yourselfwithout something to do, or your best friend and you are being terribly indecisive, turn to "Weekend" every Friday for some suggestions. · 
"Weekend" is the column to turn to ifyou have come to wit:s end 
and are looking forward (with great trepidation) to a lonely 
weekend evening with nothing to do. There are a few mainstay ac­
tivities, movies, the Nazz and Chautauqua, and peppered in between, 
theatre and dance productions, art exhibits and concerts. 
As we all have been experiencing this week, school work is slow 
gettingstarted. The theatre and dance departments are slowly begin­
ning to wind up for their seasons with open auditions having taken 
place Wednesday and last night and future auditions yet to be 
scheduled. We have these productions to look forward to in the near 
future. 
In the meantime, do not despair. There are enough things on 
campus to do to keep everyone occupied. 
Movies 
The first edition ofthe Friday Night Film Series will beAtlantic 
City. A film ignored by much ofthe mainstream audience, it brought 
Burt Lancaster an Academy Award nomination for best actor. It 
shows the east coast gambling city in all ofits glitter and decadence. 
Annenberg Auditorium is the sight for all presentations of both the 
Monday and Friday Night Film Series. Showtime is 7:30 and the cost 
is $2.00. 
As usual, Emil's flocks ofchemistry students are making room for the almost nightly Engineering Auditorium movie. Friday and Satur­day nights, Mr. Roberts, starring Henry Fonda, James Cagney and Jack Lemmon will be presented by the Film Club ofNotre Dame. One dollar will allow you to attend any one ofthe showings at 7. 9: 15 or 11:30 p.m. 
Music 
Acouple of musical events will take the stage this weekend. As a part ofthe "Catch that Domer Spirit" campaign to welcome us all back to campus, The Toons will appear on the south quad at 7 p.m. tonight. Ifthe skies insist on opening up and showering little rain droplets on us, it will be held in Stepan Center. 
On the Saint Mary's North Quad, SoundShowcase sponsored by. the I982-I983 Saint Mary'~ College Performing Arts Series will feature the sounds of"Uptown," "Straight Flush," and "The Tony Brown Band". Music fans can move to the sounds ofjazz, rock and · reggae as these bands play from I p.m. to 7 p.m. 
Art 
An exhibition of 20th Century Sculptors' Drawings from the Museum ofModern Art will open at the Snite Museum ofArt Sunday, September 5 and will remain on view through October I 0. The show contains works from the Museum of Modem Art's collection which spans the last one hundred years. The drawings range from rapidly executed sketches for achieved pieces to finished and independent works on paper which "serve as graphic analogues" to clarify the sculptor's plastic concerns. Some ofthe artists featured are Henry Moore, Claes Olenburg, Alexander Calder and Robert Rauchenberg.· The exhibit can be viewed during regular Snite Museum hours. 
outlook 
 Concerts 
The ACC will be occupied with two concerts this week for which 
tickets should be obtained soon. The concert stage will bring forth 
Rick Springfield and his band Tuesday night, and it will be dark for 
four days only to be lit back up for Barbara Mandrell and her show 
Saturday night. It's concert time for just about any music fan this 
week with these two visiting. Take the opportunity to start off the 
semester with one ofthese class acts. 
Although September 28 seems to be a long way off, it is not too 
soon to be thinkingabout tickets for Pure Prairie League's concert at 
the Morris Civic Auditorium at 8 p.m. that evening. Tickets are $9.50 
reserved and will go on sale this Thursday, September 9, at River City 
Recordsonlyat their store on U.S. 3I North. Morris Civic will not be 
selling tickets for this concert so you had best mosey on out to River 
City and buy them. 
Concert Postscript 
Notre Dame/Saint Mary's students responded heavily to "The Who" ticket package offered by River City Records. Because River City was treated to the sight ofNotre-Dame/Saint M!IJ'Y's students arriving via various means oftransportation includi lg bicycle and jogging shoes, they would like all ofyou ticket holders to know that they will be providing transportation from campus both afternoons at 3:45p.m. from the Main Circle. The buswill take you to River City Records where you will be checked in and reboard the bus to take you to the concert.

College :football season begins 
By HERSCHEL NISSENSON 
AssociatedPress 
Ready or not, here comes the col· lege football season. 
Tulane's hosts Mississippi State tomorrow afternoon and Coach Vince Gibson is in midseason form with the crying towel. Most coaches probably feel the same way Gibson does, but they don't express their feelings quite so eloquently. 
"You look at them and all their linemen's rumps are about this wide," Gibson lamented, holding his hands about four feet apart. "They are bigger than the (New Orleans) Saints. They are big and rough and well-coached and I don't know how we're going to stop them. We'll just have to hope they make a mistake." 
The first prediction of the year is that every team in the country will make at least one first down and score at least one touchdown this season. Even Tulane, which, Gibson will be surprised to learn, is only a 4-point underdog ro Mississipp. State. Gibson has this corner con­vinced, though ...Mississippi State 21-14. 
The first week of the season finds six members ofThe Associated Press preseason Top Twenty knocking hc:ads with each other. 
No. 1 5 Miami at No. 16 Florida 
(3.5 ): those late field goals still stick in the Gators' craw. Two years ago, Miami kicked one in the last second to rub it in and complete a 31-7 rout. Last season, Danny Miller caromed a 55-yarder off the"'!rfjright with 45 s'econds to play for a 21-20 Miami triumph. This time ...Florida 28­

No. 11 Clemson at No. 7 Georgia 
(favored by 1.5): will Herschel 
Walker play or won't he in this Mon­

prove after committing nine tur·

Austin wins 
McEnroe advances in U.S. Open 
NEW YORK (AP) -Riding his 
booming serve and moving to the 
net at every chance, top-seeded 
John McEnroe began the defense of 
his U.S. Open tennis championship 
Thursday by downing a stubborn Tim Gullikson 7-6,6-4, 7-5 at the Na­tional Tennis Center. 
Third-seeded Tracy Austin, the I98I women's winner, had to struggle to stave off the upset bid by Beth Norton 7-6, 6·3 in a second­round match. 
The night's final match, pitting No. 3 Ivan Lend! of Czechoslovakia against Tim Mayotte, was suspended when a heavy thunderstorm hit Louis Armstrong Stadium with Lend! leading 6-4, I-2, the Czech serving at 30-I5 in the fourth game. The match is scheduled to be completed today. 
Advancing into the third round of 
the men's singles were sixth-seeded 
Gene Mayer and No.9 Yannick Noah 
of France, while No. 13 Mark Ed­
monds~n of Australia was upset by 
Matt Doyle and No. I5 Raul Ramirez 
of Mexico lost to Schalk van der 
Merwe ofSouth Africa. 
In the women's singles, five-time 
champion Chris Evert Lloyd moved 
into the third round, while No. IO 
Barbara Potter became the first seed 
to be ousted. 
Mayer defeated Stefan Simonsson 
of Sweden 6-2, 6-I, 6-I; Noah 
stopped Brian Gottfried 6-3,6-4, 6-4; 
Doyle surprised Edmondson I-6, 7­
6, 7-5, 6-2 and van der Merwe ousted 
Ramirez 6-2,6-3, 5-7,6-4. 
Lloyd needed just 4I minutes to 
crush Kelly Henry 6-I, 6-I, while 
Potter fell to Ros Fairbank of South 
Africa 6-4, 6-I. 
The world's richest tournament, 
America's premiere tennis event 
runs through Sept. I2, when the 
singles champions will collect 
S90,000 each. 
McEnroe, completing a match 
which had been halted by rain and a 
light failure Wednesday night, 
showed the agility and mobility that 
has carried him to three straight U.S. 
Open titles. 
McEnroe and the right-handed half of the tennis-playing Gullikson rwins had traded service breaks and were tied 3-3 before a battery of lights on the east side of Louis Armstrong Stadium went out Wed­nesday night. Before electricians coud get the lights back on, rain, which had delayed play several times, began again and the match 
was postponed until yesterday. 
The two then held serve, sending the opening set to a tiebreaker which McEnroe won 7·2. 
McEnroe broke Gullikson in the flfth game of the second set as he began dominating play. The defend­in~ champion was holding serve at 

IU's Corso ma~res, ax~s _comedy routine 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) ­Did you hear·the one about the foot­ball coach.who was so funny no one took him seriously? 
That's what has happened to In­diana's Lee Corso, and he says it's time to tone down his repertoire of one-liners and anecdotes. 
"I haven't lost my sense of humor," he said. "But I need to gauge myself on how I use it. You can have too much of anything, including humor. I'm a deeper thinker than sometimes I give the impression, and it bothered me." 
Corso said his constant quips created an image he couldn't con­trol. Everywhere he went -news conferences, alumni gatherings, din­ners -people expected him to be funny. 
"I could sense it at times," he said, snapping his fingers. "Come on, en· tertain us, make us laugh. It got out of hand. Times change and so do people. I have in my own attitude toward . things. I'm older, more mature and a deeper thinker." 
The 46-year-old coach came to In­diana in I973 with a reputation as a prankster. He rode elephants, love or at 15, while Gullikson had to fight back from I5-40 in the third game and from deuce in the seventh. 

Gullikson took a 3-0 lead in the third set, breaking McEnroe in the second game. But McEnroe captured the next five games before Gullikson held serve, then broke McEnroe in the I Oth game. 
McEnroe broke right back in the IIth game, although Gullikson fought off four break points before falling. The champion, serving for the match for the eond time, then closed it out after going to duece. 
paraded turkeys onto the football field, brought his players to the games in a red, double-deck bus. His vibrant personality won a lot of friends. but not too many football games. 
"I think in my case, I allowed my sense ofhumor to be shown in a dif­ferent perspective than what it was. People took it as a sign ofweakness. 
"I kept telling people a sense of humor wasn't a sign ofweakness, but they didn't believe me. I showed a side of me that wasn't always there, but I did it for the purpose ofhelping the players and helping the program along. 

"I think it bothers anybody who has a sense of humor to be called a clown. I think anybody who as the God-given ability, or gift, to make people laugh would tell you the same thing. I went a little too far · with it." 
Corso's change of attitude has been noticed by his players. 
"He's definitely different," says defensive back Tim Wilbur. "He's still funny, but not on the tleld. He's gotten much more serious, and it is reflecting on the players. 

Today was thefinal dayfor tryoutsfor the women's tennis team, 
andplay was tough asfreshman and transfers both made a strong 
effort to place on the team. (Photo by Rachel Blount)

ENDICOTT, N.Y. (AP) -little­known Mike Smith fired a 6-under­par 65 yesterday and took a 2-stroke lead over Tom Kite and jerry Pate after the opening round of the $275,000 B.C. Open. 
Kite, who won the Professional Golfers' Association tour event in 1978, and late-starterjerry Pate held a one-shot advantage over 15 other players, who were stacked at 68, three shots off the pace. 
Smith started in the first threesome of the day and watched his score stand up throughout a long afternoon. 
"I wasn't crazy about teeing off at 8 am., but the sun came out and dried off the course," said Smith, a 32-year-old from Selma, Ala., who did not qualify for the PGA tour until 
1980.

Smith played the front nine in 5­under-par 32. He started a string of three straight birdies on the front '>ide by chipping-in from 20 feet away on the seventh hole. Another was an 80-footer on No. 15 for_his only birdie on the back nine.

U.S. Amateur begins, Nat Crosby defeated 
. . . 



BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) ­Veteran international player Jay Sigel and two U.S. Walker Cup teammates advanced with a pair of victories, while defending cham­pion Nathaniel Crosby was upset yesterday as match play began in the 82nd U.S. Amateur golf champion­ship. 
Sigel, the 1980 British Amateur champion, eliminated co-medalist Bob Lewis Jr., 3 and 2, in the early­morning start of match play, then edged Taylor Metcalfe, 1-up in 21 holes later in the day. 
Joining Sigel in the round of 16 were Walker Cup players Jim Holtgrieve and Corey Pavin and two All-Americans, Rick Fehr of Brigham Young and Jim Hallet of Bryant Col­lege in Smithfield, RI. 
Crosby, the pre-tournament favorite as the low amateur in the 
U.S. Open and recent winner of the prestigious Porter Cup, was eliminated in 19 holes by Tom Pernice Jr., a Kansas City resident who was graduated from UCLA last June. 
Holtgrieve, who defeated James Kilduff of Summit, N.J., 2-up in the opening round, then ruined Pernie's hopes with a smashing 5 and 4 vic­tory in the afternoon. 
Pavin, of Oxnard, Calif., had little trouble in advancing. He whipped Joe Tamburino, of San Jose, Calif., 5 and 4 in the morning, and Kevin Dil­len, of Paris, Tex., by the same score in the second round. 
Fehr, the Western Amateur cham­pion who lives in Seattle, had to rally on the back nine for a 1-up victory over Andrew Magee ofDallas. Then, completing a stretch of I 0 birdees in 22 holes, he overwhelmed Kevin Klier of nearby Rockland, Mass., 7 and6. 
Hallet, the Massachusetts and New England amateur champion, kept local hopes alive by edgingJim­my Squiers, ofConroe, Tex., 2 and I, and then out-lasting Troy Reiser, of Fort Worth, Tex., in 20 holes. 
Walker Cup player Frank Fuhrer breezed to a 7 and 5 triumph over Chip Hall ofJacksonville Beach, Fla., then was upset, 3 a,nd 2, by Dave Delong of Portland, Ore. 
Co-medalist Bob Stanger, the for­mer Duke golf captain who is assis­tant golfcoach at the school, moved alon t g with a pair of victories. He eliminated Stan Bickel, of Bellevue, Ky., 2-up, ;md Gary Iipski, of Cock­eysville, Md., 1-up. 
Lipski had upset All-American Willie Wood of Oklahoma State, 1­up, in the first round. 
Others moving into this morn­ing's third round were Julian Taylor, of Youngstown, Ohio; David-Tentis, of White. 6ear Lake, Minn.; Brad Heninger, of San Jose, Calif.; Kei Slater, of San Diego; Ro Biancalana, ofFranklin Park, Ill.; Ed Humenik, of Allen Park, Mich.; Timothy Krapfel, of Columbia, S.C.; Kent Frandsen, of Lebanon, Ind., and David Tolley, of Roanoke, Va. 
The third round will be followed this afternoon by the quarterfinals. The semillnals are Saturday. A 36­hole championship is set for Sunday.
