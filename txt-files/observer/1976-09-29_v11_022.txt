by Mike Towle Staff Reporter 

University of Notre Dame alumni contributed more than $3 million to the University in fiscal year 1976, 
. according to a report released by Notre Dame's Public Relations and Development Office. This total ranks as the third highest in the history of the University. Compared to other major schools across the nation, Notre Dame conststently ranks among the top in alumni contributions.

The number of contributing alumni in 1976 constitutes about SO percent of all solicitable alumni according to Conklin. He added. "In determining this percentage. only solicitable alumni are counted which leaves out unreachable alumni and those who are religion affiliated.

Senior Bar atmosphere will be diversified 
by Jim Hersuey 
Staff Reporter 
To diversify the atmosphere of the Senior Bar, a house south of the football stadium, the management has initiated a plan to develop a coffee house in the area of the dancing floor. 
Rich Johnson, assistant manager oi' theSenior Bar, said "One thing we felt we were lacking was campus talent ... lt (the coffee house) would be like the Nazz, but it would not take any­thing away from the Nazz." He said that they have plans for comedy entertainment as well as musical entertainment. 
Johnson also said, "We want to give the bar a different atmosphere on different nights. Last year it was the same every night. People basically came to drink and listen to loud music. 

He explained, "It's supposed to be a club, and every club that I've ever been in tries to alter its programs." He emphasized that they want the Senior Bar to be more than a bar. 
Included in this plan is a food sales room adjacent to the dance floor, live entertainment and the possibility of showing short films in the dancing room. 
The food sales operation, which is worked by Deb Mather and Kathy McGah, is a private business not affiliated with the bar. It opened last Friday night. Present­ly, they are selling sandwiches, hot pretzels and other items. They will probably start selling pizzas after the football season. 
Johnson said that, with the live entertainment, the coffee house will have a real bar atmosphere on Wednesday and Friday nights. On Thursday and Saturday nights, the pace will be slower. 
Johnson mentioned that, if the response to this article is favorable, live entertainment will start as soon as possible. 
rooms on campus. 
While waiting for their numbers to come up on the waiting list, the girls were assigned to Farley by the Housing Office. According to Kit Baron, Farley Hotel proprietress, and lately the basement R.A., "The girls have shown good spirit. lhey're trying to make the best of things here." 
Sophomore transfer student, Ann Buzald, noting that although the rooms are very cluttered, added, "I'm just happy to be on 
campus.  At  least  I'm  meeting

Jimmy blasts Ford's policies 
by Gregg B. Bangs Political Staff Editor 
Charging that President Ford's economic policies have placed a record 2.5 million Americans below the official poverty line last year, Democratic Presidential nominee Jummy Carter said the Republican administration has helped create a new class of poor for whom the American dream has been denied 
While speaking to a crowd of 8,000 at Portland Harbor, Carter said most Americans were "born to hope for a better life, trained for self-sufficiency and confident in the American dream.'' 
"But eight years of unemploy­ment and inflation have cancelled the promise, destroyed the self­sufficiency and denied the dream." 
According to a September 27 Associated Press report, Carter, while campaigning in Portland, Oregon, vowed he would never raise taxes on Americans who work for a living, or whose major source of income comes from salaries, instead of capital gains, interest and dividends. 
In several speeches made in Portland, Carter charged most tax loopholes benefit those who have an income above $50,000 and do nothing for the middle class wor­ker. Although he did not directly

say so, he indicated that the $50,000 and above income level would feel the greatest impact of his tax revision programs. 
Carter also told a crowd in front of the Federal Building Plaza in Portland that the "bloated mess" in Washington could be rectified only by an outsider. 
According to a Charles Mohr story that appeared in the Septem­ber 27 New York Times, Carter was "apparently trying to exploit re­ports that President Ford had received hospitality from a lobby­ist." 
Carter said change could not be expected from a "leadership that has been bogged down in Washing­ton for the last 25 or 30 years, deriving their advice, their counsel, their financing support from lobby­ists and from special interests." 
''They go to the same restaur­
ants," he continued "they belong to the same clubs, they play golf on the same golf courses, they com­municate with one another, they support one another in the absence of participation, understanding and control by the people ourselves.'' 
The article infers that Carter was referring to reports that William Whyte, a United States Steel corporation lobbyist. had confirm­ed that he had footed the bill for several golfing weekends for Ford when the President was a United States Congressman. Whyte also said he still has a "golfing friend­ship" with Ford. 
However, Carter has supposedly not made any mention of other reports that the Watergate special prosecutor's office was investigat­ing campaign contributions made to the President between 1964 and 1974.

Schorr resigns 
NEW YORK (AP) -Daniel Schorr. who weathered a con­gressional hearing about a leak of secret information, resigned Tues­day as a CBS news correspondent. He had been with the network for 23 years. 
Under suspension with pay since last February, Schorr said in a letter to CBS News President Richard Salant that remaining with the network might prove "a source of tension within the organiza­tion." 
Schorr said in an interview in 
Washington that his immediate 
plans were to accept a short-term 
professorship at a large university 
which he would not name and to 
begin thinking about writing a 
book. 
In accepting the resignation, 
Salant wished Schorr happiness in 
the future and added, "You will 
hereafter, of course, be fully free to 
pursue whatever line of endeavor 
you may choose--including full time 
employment on another network.''

"I think I'm out of network television for good in any regular way," Schorr said. "I'm not interested any more.'' 
He said he's not disenchanted and ''I'm not criticizing television and I'm certainly not criticizing television journalism.'' 
Schorr was suspended by CBS News after he turned over a secret congressional report on the CIA to the Village Voice, a Manhattan­weekly newspaper. He went before the House Ethics Committee last week but refused to reveal who gave him the report, on grounds that as a newsman he had a right to keep his source confidential. 
In reference to Schorr's appear­ance before. the committee, Salant wrote in accepting the resi'gnation, "You did a superb and eloquent service to all of us in journalism and, above all, to the principles of the First Amendment and the public's right to know."

House phone calls costing taxpayers 
EVANSVILLE. Ind. AP-Hundreds of telephone calls that cost Indiana taxpayers over $72,000 were made on Indiana House and Senate credit cards during a 12-month period ending June 30, the Evansville 
Press reports. 

In a copyrighted story, the newspaper said calls were made to such far away places as the Virgin Islands,-California, New York City and Alabama. 
"The calls were only part of the Senate and House long-distance calls that cost taxpayers $72,885 for a 12-month period ending last June 30." the newspaper said. 
"Lame duck Sen. Rudolph Clay, D-Garv. was the champion out-of­state ~aller. From June 8 to July 6 this \Tar. he rang up a record 85 interstate c·alls alone," the story continued. 
The calls. the story said, were made to relatives. business con­tacts. hotels and motels. and homes and offices of state legisla­tors when they were out of Indiana. 
A search of state records turned up the calls when the Legislature was not in session, the newspaper also said. 
In addition to credit card calls, there were three calls charged to the Senate's information-reception telephone placed from the Virgin Islands, including one number discovered to be a Bronx, New York apartment, and another from Puerto Rico to Beverly Hills, Calif. · 
"The out-of-session credit card calls ranged the width and breadth of the nation, from large cities to rural hamlets, from mountain re­sort areas to Florida vacation spots ,'' the story said. 
The newspaper also says Indiana taxpayers have been paying for hundreds of dollars worth of bou­quets for members of the Indiana House, their families, staff em­ployees, lobbyists and others. Most of the bouquets, it said, were given as an expression of sympathy during times of illness or death.

Kathy Kane, Walsh's President, said that they would definitely not in1pose a fine, but instead, are "encouraging girls to lock the room behind themselves." She noted that all room keys fit the laundry room lock. 
"It's not to be mean or anything, but we figure that if we keep guys out, they'd be willing to fight more to get machines in their dorms or something," Kane stated. She realizes the problem of the men, but said that women should have a right to use the machines tn their own dorms. 
Farley has had the policy of a $5.00 fine for the past three years. This is the first year of great enforcement though, because of increased male u.se of the machines, Kee said. 
Breen~Phillips is currently using a verbal and sign system to try keeping men out of the room. This, however, has not been too success­ful as the sign explaining the rules was ripped down just after it was put up. Breen-Phillips's laundry room is closed 24 hours td. males.

Judge Hunter's suspe·nsion to be future consideration 
INDIANAPOLIS AP -The h{diana Supreme Court probably won't consider a petition to remove Justice Donald H. Hunter from the bench until a regularly scheduled court conference Monday, Chief Justice Richard M. Givan said Tuesday. 
The petition was filed Monday by suspended Ripley Circuit Court Judge Lendall B. Terry. 
Terry alleged Hunter engaged in an unlawful conspiracy to protect Batesville attorney William W. Greeman from criminal prosecution for allegedly filing forged docu­ments in Terry's court. And he claims the conspiracy resulted in his suspension without pay from the Ripley County bench for alleged improper· conduct in April 1975. 
Terry petitioned the supreme court earlier this year for reinstate­ment. And he repeatedly made references to the alleged conspir­acy during a three-day hearing earlier this month to determine whether he is now fit to resume his official duties. 
In the petition filed Monday , Terry asked the supreme court to suspend Hunter from his position on the court and order the Judicial Qualifications Commission to in­vestigate Hunter's activities. 
"I t will be taken up in the due course of things,' Givan said. 
Givan questioned why Terry filed the request with the court rather than taking it directly to the judicial 
commission,  where  most  com­ 
plaints are filed.  
But he said the supreme  court  

had the authority to refer the matter to te commission if it deemed the situation worth investi­gation. If it does not vote for referral, the issue is dead, he said.

In Farley, the Hall Council decided to impose the fine but resident assistants refuse to en­force it, said Kee. Sr. Jean Lenz, 
the  hall's  rector,  was  also  not  
responsible  for  enforce ment,  she  
said.  

Breen-Phillips will decide after a few weeks if they will start fining men caught using machines, said Siegler. They will first, however, try to relieve the problem through communication of their rules. 
One Breen-Phillips resident stated a counter-view saying that she could see situations where men could use the machines: "I would say that if they don't use' it on a regular basis and no one's down there, and if they really need it, then it would be all right.'' She cited the example of a male with a broken leg whose roommates would not bring his laundry down to be done for him.

EDITOR'S NOTE: George A. Brown lives with his wife Mimi, and five year-old son, Cannon on a farm in Buchannon Michigan. For nearly ten years, Brown has removed non-consumable food from the dining halls at no cost to the University. 
Observer: Whl(n did you come to the United States? 
Brown:l came to this country from Jamaica in 1940. I came during the Second World War when the United States recruited men from other countries to work. I was twenty years old then and worked in Michigan picking mushrooms on a mushroom farm. OBSERVER:After your citizenship was reinstated, what did you do upon returning to the United States? 
BROWN: I left America for a few years and returned to Jamaica. I came back to Michigan, got married, and worked for the Clark Equipment Company. My wife and I oecided to buy a farm. Neither one of us had ever lived on a farm in .our lives. The family we purchased the farm from were only the fourth generation of farmers. The land was virgin land. My wife and I became farmers fast. We built the home we live in and cultivated the land ourselves. Our feeling is that this is God's country. You cannot take away what the Lord has blessed. I feel we have been blessed. 
At first I began my farm with a few goats. I now grown corn and raise pigs. 
OBSERVER: What are the proceedures you Jollow when feeding your pigs? 
BROWN: My farm as it now stands has ninety pigs. My farm has been inspected by the government and meet the proper standards. 
Each day grain must be fed to the pigs. They require a daily supplement of grain. Eight years ago I went to Notre Dame and asked if I could haul away the excess non-consumable food and waste from the dining halls. I was told that I could. I took the garbage away each evening. Accord­ing to the health standards, before the garbage can be fed to the hogs. the garbage must be cooked. I have a cooker 
A telephone call started things off: "Hey Gregg, we're sitting in line for Springsteen tickets. Wanna take a shift?" 
Waiting in line outside LaFortune didn't hit me as the 111ost appealing thing to do with a weekend. After all, just two short weeks before, I sat in line one morning for football tickets and ' come back the next night to purchase some America tickets. America's subsequent cancellation did not make me look forward to sitting out for nothing again. 
However, a good show sounded appeal­ing and my time shifts were very reason­able--7:00am to 1:OOpm on Saturday and 3:00pm to 9:00pm on Sunday. I could still see the Purdue game and possible get in some greatly needed study time to boot. To top it off, our group would start waiting at 3:00 pm Friday--two and one-half days before the sales. The promise of excellent seats won out over the concern of rain pounding on my head while sittin in line so I told my friend I'd join his waiting group. 
Although I did not sit straight thru the entire two and one-half days, twelve hours is a sufficient amount of time to observe any usual or unusual occurences that are intrinsic in a waiting line's nature. What follows are a few incidents that occurred during the weekend: on the farm.

Priolo is a small, grimy town on the Italian island of Sicily. The few trees that ·survive bear dust-cover­ed leaves, the air smells chemically foul and the fresh linen hanging on the balconies turns grey before it is even dry. 
For years, Priolo's 12,000 inha­bitants have stoically accepted the bronchial and intestinal disorders caused by the town's sprawling petrochemical factory, cement wo­rks and chemical magnesium refin­eries. 
But now Priolo is beginning to have second thoughts, in the wake of the disaster at Seveso, a town in northern Italy where the accidental escape ofTCDD dioxin poison from a factory forced the evacuation of 1500 inhabitants. 
Priolo's authorities are consid­ering a mass evacuation of the town because of its "intolerable" pollut­ion rate. 
In the rest of Western Europe. the press has zealously dramatized the Seveso disaster and examined in glossy detail the '· danger industries" and anti-pollution safe­guards in their own countries, asking: can it happen here? 
And no doubt a large partof the public has been shocked to learn that not only could it happen "here," but it had been happening "here" for years. 
Western European countries like France. Italy, Portugal and Spain have never considered the environment issue a high priority. Only in the Scandinavian countries,. Great Britain, West Germany and Holland has there been a show of concern. 
No pollution borders 
' I .

But unlike concern, po luuon knows no borders. Britain's heavy industries in the south billow out toxic fumes causing acid rains to fall on the pine forests of Norway, retarding or destroying tree grow­th. 
"<tctories in Switzerland, West Germany and France pour tons of mercury wastes into the Rhine River, \1 hich carries pollution thro­ugh Holland and into the North Sea. 
Threatened as well are historic towns like Venice, whose buildings and statues are menaced not so much by the rising tides of the Adriatic as by atmospheric polluti­on from the industrial complexes at nearby Mestre and marghera. 
And in Base, northern Switzerla­nd, the townfolk have suddenly become worried by a meteorologica I office report warning that their medieval town could turn into the "filthiest in the world." The villain: sulfur dioxide waste prod­ucts from local industry and excess heat from the nearby Kaiseraugst nuclear power station, Switzerlan­d's largest. 
What angered the Swiss most of all was the supression of the report by authorities for more than three years. while environmentalists fo­ught fruitlessly to halt the opening of the nuclear plant. 

Among Europe's major pollution problems in the Mediterranean, where the dumping of DDT. merc­ury, cadmium, crude oil and high-level radioactive wastes is threatening to turn a great sea into a dead mass of water much like some of America's Great Lakes. 
With more than 30 million touri­sts visiting the Mediterranean eve­ry year, its death would be a economic blow to the 18 European, Arab and African states bordering it. Tourists are already feeling the effects of pollution on their holida­ys. 
Shoreline waters in Greece are devoid of life, polluted by the massive, uncontrolled industrial complexes outside Athens. Beach­es along the Italian Riviera are littered with plastic and petrol wastage. And fishermen in France are bringing in fewer fish. 
In February of this year, 16 of the 18 Mediterranean states agreed at a TJnited Nations Environment Program (uNEP) conference in b.;rcelona, Spain, to take construc­tive steps towards halting the pollutinn before it is too late. 
And in order to help the experts and the public prevent further Sevesos, says Hans Mollenhauer, UNEP director in Geneva, they are now preparing a special register of toxic chemicals and ways to cope· with them 
Environmentalists try to arouse public 
But although the scientists may agree it will be up to politicians to apply the controls. And in the wake of Seveso, environmentalists are still wondering if the public is aware or aroused enough to make

Environmentalists have te.nd­ed -to be scientists, left-wing un iversity and political groups or lone crusaders such as Switzerland's Franz Weber. an energetic journa­list often compared to Ralph Nader. 
And with few votes at state on pollution issues, government offic­ials regard environmentalists, esp­ecially the "non-qualified" ones like students, as little more than a n).lisance. 
But a few groups have managed to overcome government or indust­ry resistance and scored environm­ental victories.

Similarly, despite the promise of newly-created jobs, the p..:upk of Marcholsheim in the Alsace, ir. eastern France, opposed the cons.­ruction of a German chemical factory which threatened to release dangerouli lead wastes into the atmosphere. 
And in 1975-, the French Minis­ter of Living conditions made a move to slow industrial pollution in populated areas by closing -eight factories until they complied with anti-pollution regulations.

BELFAST, Northern Ireland ­Two leaders of Northern Ireland's women's peace movement said yesterday they will take their crusade to the United States next week to plead anew with Ameri­cans to stop sending money that, the women say, fuels terrorism. 
Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan, co-founders of the non­partisan and nonsectarian six­week-old movement, said they will fly Monday to Buffalo, N.Y. at the invitation of the Public Broadcas­ting System (PBS). 
Williams said that they will appeal in a nationwide telecast to Irish Americans to cut off the flow of funds that they claim supports the Roman Catholic and Protestant gunmen waging terror warfare in Nortehrn Ireland. She and Miss Corrigan are Catholic, but their movement includes both Protes­tants and Catholics. · 
·'The people who give the money have no idea about where it goes.'· Williams said. "They are third­generation American Irish. They have just no idea about what is going on over here." 
She said U.~. money has been helping sustain the main guerrilla armies-the Provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army, the pre­dominantly Catholic guerrilla ar­
my, and two Protestant paramili­tary bands, the Ulster Defense Association and the Ulster Volun­teer Force. 
Britain and Ireland have fre­:JUently alleged that Irish-Ameri­~ans send money to Northern Ireland thinking it will be used fm rehabilitation. In fact, officials say,

The Provos are waging a bomb­and-bullets terror campaign to unite the Protestant-dominated British province of Northern Ire­land with the Catholic-led Irish Republic. The Protestant militants are fighting to maintain th.:ir control over the province.

Northern Ireland and the desire of .the people here for peace. They return home Oct. 7. 
The women formed their peace movement after three Belfast child­ren were killed bv a runawav auto during a gun battle betwee~ IRA terrorists and British troops. 
The children's funeral brought together 2,000 Catholic and Protes­tant mourners, and convinced Wil­liams, 32, that the time had come to put an end to the killings. Corrigan, an aunt of the slain children, joined her, and other housewives quickly flocked to their banner.

Pigs, Price and Pride 
The on-going fracas over how to dispose of 
dining hall garbage, through George Brown's 
pigs or through mechanical disposals and a 
trash removal service, is not a burning issue. 
However, it is a matter marked by contra­
dictions and at least apparent arrogance on the 
part of Edmund Price, director of food services. 
The dispute began early this semester when Price banned Brown from picking up garbage to feed his pigs. Price gave as his reasons "professionalism" and the fact that he did not want to be "pushed around" by student pressure. His action has brought student protests that he is wasting food which could be recycled through the pigs and that his arbitrary action mistreats Brown. At a meeting Monday with concerned students, Price cited problems with county sanitation standards, improved 
·efficiency and economy as reasons for the change. The students, led by Tom Soma, chairman of the Food Services Advisory Council, are not satisfied and plan to keep fighting (see Soma's letter on this page). 
Clearly Price's plan contradicts the Univer­sity's stand against food waste. Food services has berated students for wasting food and has decorated the dining halls with propaganda posters encouraging people to eat everything on their plates. Notre Dame has become a leader in the fight against world hunger; Fr. Hesburgh travels about the country warning of the need to conserve food for the starving 
billions abroad. Yet Price prefers to throw the food down the garbage disposal rather than recycle it. 
The arguments Price offered at Monday's meeting are generally weak. Brown has gotten the license needed to meet county sanitation regulations. In the broader view the new way is not more efficient since it replaced a closed recycling process with a dead-ended, energy­consuming, mechanical system. Economy is another dubious argument since the University now pays for disposal whereas Brown picked up the usable garbage for free. Price points to the fact that new disposals have been installed recently (presumably at some cost); garbage must be found to keep them busy. This is like saying, "Now that we have spent billions on a new army, we will have to find a war to put it to use.'' Even more ironically, dining hall workers report that the new system has choked on the increased garbage. 
Why then is Price so determined to drop Brown? Perhaps the true reason was revealed in his remark that he does not want to be "pushed around." That is a juvenile statement at best and hardly consistent with any "professional" attitude. Considering the weakness of his rational arguments perhaps he fears loss of face. Efficiency and economy dictate that Mr. Brown's pigs should get what garbage they can use. We hope that Price's 
pride will not stand in their way.

Brains 
vs. Brawn 

Dear Editor: We would like to respond to Chip Spina's article entitled "Goodbye, Northwestern." What does Mr. Spina have against Northwestern? Maybe he always wanted to enroll at N. U., but was refused. He must have some motive for writing such 


below-the-belt remarks concerning Northwestern's athletic depart­
. ment. Suggesting Northwestern join a high school legue, and referring to them as a ''Sesame Street Team" is not our idea of classy Journalism. The series between N. U. and 
N.D. probably should have been ended. We realize N.U. is not a football powerhouse like N.D, but they look at football a little dif­ferently than N.D. does. I think it would prove interesting if the grade point averages of the two teams were compared. We're not saying that Notre Dame's recruit­ing techniques are wrong, but neither are Northwestern's. They are just different. 
We have been under the impres­sion that Notre Dame exists in an atmosphere of class. I hope that impression is not an illusion which such as Mr. Spina create with their cranial-rectal inversions. The only thing worse than a poor loser is a poor winner. We hope N.D. contin­ues to win and also continues to have "class.'

Question 

of Morality 
Dear Editor: 
As chairman of the Food Services 
Council, and as one of the students ' who attended Monday's meeting concerning the Farmer Brown con­troversy, I feel that I must express some of our concerns regarding the situation which were not made clear by Tuesday's Observer arti­
cle . 
All of us who where present feel 
that there is more involved here 
than simple sanitary aspects of 
garbage removal. First of all, we 
are deeplv concerned by the neg­
lect to the dignity of Mr. George 
Brown. The way in which his 
services were terminated leaves 
much to be desired. I find it hard to 
justify the letter, followed by 
further cold letters in response to 
Mr. Brown's appeals on his own 
behalf. We are talking about a 
human being here, and I would find 
it very difficult to live with myself if 
I treated a man the way Mr. "Brown 
has been treated by our University 
hierarchy. 
Secondly, ' I seriously question 
the basic morality behind the 
disposal of large quantities of 
excess. food. This wasted food 
(example-leftover chickens, hams, etc) which cannot be consumed by students since it has been heated twice, is still usefull, valuable, and legally fit for consumption by animals -namely Mr. Brown's pigs. The sad reality that Mr. Price fails to elucidate is the fact that there is a large amount of food which is simply being placed down our University disposals. We are aware that the very nature of a large food service such as ours is often the cause of this excess food, and we are not condemning the fact that this excess exists. We do, however, question the moral justi­fication for destroying this left-over food. 
we realize that we are pleading a human issue in an increasingly professional-oriented society, but maybe it's aboul time someone started to confront the issues from the human standpoint for a change. We feel that, if a sincere effort is made, the university will not have to compromise their sanitation standards in order to re-instate Mr. Brown's service. 
As a result of our convictions, we are consulting experts and examin­ing the situation further. When we conclude our investigation we will present our findings to Mr. Price and any other necessary university personnel. I sincerely hope thatthey will be willing to listen, but, so far, I am really not convinced that they will.

Fire ant 
By Don Gardner Pacific News Service 

The controversial pesticid.e mirex -used widely throughout the South against tire ants-will be banned by the Environmental Protection Agency by the end of this year. 
An agreement between the EPA, the state of Mississippi and envi­ronmentalists to curtail use of the substance was reached last week following three and a half years of hearings into the' environmental and health dangers of the DDT-re­lated pesticide. 
Evidence presented indicated that aside from being relatively ineffective. the pesticide is toxic to many species, causes cancer in rats. and accumulates in human fatty tissue. It has been found in 40 pcr~ent of human tissue samples taken in the Southeast, leading scientists to fear the possibility of extensive cancer casualities. 
Fearing an almost certain EPA 

ban, Mississippi --the sole mar­
keter of mirex ant bait --petitioned 
the EPA one month ago to make 
the phase-out gradual. 
The resulting plan will allo\\­

Mississippi to continue to sell 
mirex in a diluted form for aerial 
spraying through 1977. Any re­
maining stocks will be sold through 
1978 for non-aerial application 
only. ­
However, the end of mirex may 

come even sooner from a different 
corner. The Hooker chemical plant 
in Niagara Falls. N.Y. which 
produces the chemical from which 
the bait is manufactured. has

announced it will no longer sell mirex to Mississippi unless the state idemnifies the company a­gainst all potential lawsuits. 
Hooker already faces the possi­bility of hundreds of millions of dollars in lawsuits resulting from mirex contamination of Lake On­tario. 
According to a high official in the EPA. "What we have hl!re is almost identically another kepone situation, only this one has inter­national implications. Mirex is all over the lake and Canada would like to use the lake for fishing." 
Mirex is known to decompose into kepone, the same chemical which has caused numerous severe illnesses and other environmental dangers in Virginia, where it was produced under contract with the Allied Chemical Co., which had developed the pesticide in the · 1950s. 
Allied also used to manufacture 

mirex, until the company sold out 
all mirex production to Mississippi 
earlier this year. 
War On Fire Ants 
The _dangers associated with 

mirex have been known since 1971. 
when the EPA first announced an 
intent to cancel the registration for 
the pesticide hecause of "a sub­
stantial question about the safety of 
mirex." 
. Allied appealed, however, and 
two weeks laterthe EPA reinstated 
the cancelled registration for both 
ground and aerial application. 
Since that time thousands of 

pound:, of mirex ant bait have been 
sprayed over millions of acres, blanketing the farm belt from East Texas to the Atlantic coast. 
The spraying, much of it done by federal and state agriculture de­partments, is continuing through­out the South despite the EPA decision to discontinue mirex pro­duction at the end of the year. 
The intended victim of the pesticide is the tiny fire ant, which was accidentally imported to the 
U.S. in 1918 from South America. The ant is feared for its painful sting. which leaves a small, itchy blister. Two persons with severe allegic reactions are known to have died from the sting. 
More important, the ants build large mounds, sometimes a yard high, which farmers say interfer with hay baling. 
Since the early 1960s, the U.S. 

Department of Agriculture has 
spent more than $150 million to 
control the pest. 
But th(' use of mirex and the eradication program itself have been controversial from the begin­ning. 
In 1967, the National Academy of 

Sciences issued a report which 
concluded that "eradication of the 
fire ant is biologically and tech­
nically impossible, and i-nadvisable 
were it possible." 
The report argued that the ant is 
a general predator, a beneficial 
insect because it eats other insects, 
including the harmful termite, 
sugarcane borer, soybean loopers, 
and corn earworms. 
A similar study revealed that when mirex killed most of the fire [continued to page 11]

.BFW uses citizenshipfor world's hungry 
by Marty Standiford Staff Reporter 

Bread for the World is a movem­
ent of Christian citizens who seek, 
through contact with government 
leaders, to make their citizenship 
work for hungry people at home 
and abroad. 
In keeping with the BFW goal of a committed, informed and politic­ally active nucleus of Christians in every congressional district, a gro­wing number of members and ·friends are banding together inloc­al groups to maximize their impact. With these goals in mind, members of ND-SMC's World Hu­~nger Coalition will establish a 
Bread for the World movement in 
South Bend, starting with an 
organizational meeting Wednesay, 
Sept. 29. It will be held in the 
library lounge at 7:00 p.m. 
Bread for the World is involved 
in issues of world hunger. It 
supports church agencies working 
against hunger and encourages 
citizens to contact their congress­
men on pertinent issues. 
Being informed about relevant 
legislation and current hunger 
programs is one of BFW's basic 
goals. Monthly meeting and 
newsletters are employed for this 
purpose. Current reports on issues 
that are before congress and the 
administration are distributed reg­
ularly. 
BFW is organized by state and 
congressional districts. A coordin­
ator in each state and most districts 
works woth a committee to organi­
ze membership. A phone system 
has made quick communication 
possible. 
Wednesday's meeting will start 
with a film based on Arthur Simon's book Bread for the World. It will outline the needs that exist and show how the U.S., and the world in general, has done little or nothing to eleviate these needs. 
The U.S. spends less than 1/4 of 1 percent of its GNP on developm­ent assistance abroad, while it spends literally billions of dollars on defense and proliferation of nuclear arms. One of the richest countries or the world, it ranks 13th out of the 18 industrialized countri­es who contribute. Congress has continued to decrease this assista­nce even further. 
Baby busted, but not fined 
CHICAGO -Frank Gauss IV 
tore up the legal notice that made 
him a fugitive from justice, stuffed 
some of it in his mouth and burped. 
The City of Springfield's Traffic 
Violation Department had just 
charged him with refusing to pay a 
parking fine. 
Frank Gauss IV had no comment 
when he got the notice Monday. 
He's 4 months old, the violation 
was on Sept. 3, 1975, in Springfield 
and that, said his parents, is an 
airtight alibi. "He wasn't born 
until May 21, 1976," said Mr. and 
Mrs. Frank Gauss III, both 22. 
The father said he wasn't near 
the Springfield area at the time. 
Mrs. Eleanor Baker, treasurer of 
the City of Springfield, said, "Let's 
just call it a combination of a 
computer error and a human error. 
The baby will not go to jail." 

Rick Slager cited as AP Back of the Week 
SOUTH BEND, ln. AP-Quarter­back Rick Slager, who set a Notre Dame record Saturday by comp­leting 12 of 14 passes for 231 yards and three touchdowns, was named the Associated Press national col­lege back of the week Tuesday 
night. 
"It's a thrill," said the S-foot­11, 190-pound senior from Colum­bus Ohio. 
"But the team is so much a part of it," he quickly added. "I just think it's even greater for the team. The offense has come a long way. It shows we do have an offense that can move and can score." 
Slager had completed only nine of 29 attempts for 114 yards and three interceptions in the first two Irish games, a 31-10 loss to Pitt and a 23-0 victory over Purdue. 
But his 12-of-14 passing in a 48-0 victory against winless Northwes­tern gave him a game completion percentage of 8S.7, breaking the former Notre Dame record of 81.3 set by Bob Williams against Michi­gan State in 1949. 
"I honestly had no idea the percentage was as high as it was," Slager said. "I didn't know I had thrown as many times as I did, or that the yardage was that much. 
"But throwing passes is SO per cent you and SO per cent receivers. It was nice the guys were holding on," he laughed. 
Slager put the Irish on top 6-0 late in the first half on the eight-yard touchdown pass to Wil­lard Browner. Seven plays into the third quarter, he connected on a 70-yarder to Tom Domin and the rout was on. The third touchdown pass was to Ken MacAfee. 
Breaking the record is always nice, Slager said, but "breaking any kind of record at Notre Dame is an honor." 
How was he able to do it? 
"Mostly because the offensive line had a super game," Slager said. "After the Pitt game, thetie was a time when everybody could have just given up. It's a tremen­dous credit to the coaches and th!e team they didn't give up, they had the guts to come back." 
Slager said his performance a­gainst Northwestern was the best of his career "passing-wise." 
"But I don't know if it was the most exciting. I think he most exciting game was in the opener against Boston College last eyar, the first game I started." 
Slager, who also is a member of the Irish varsity tennis team, doubts whether he will play pro football because of his size. A good offer, however. could change his mind, he admitted. 
"Everybody would like to say they'd like to play professional ball, but right now I'm looking toward law school. I haven't really thought about pro ball. I enjoy college football. b.ut I think this probably will be my last year." 
SMC netters finish third 
by Patti Doyle 

In the 1976 State Tennis Tour­nament, both the St. Mary's and Notre Dame women's teams fi­nished in respectable positions. Purdue placed first in the tourney with a total of 28 team points and Indiana U. followed them totaling 21 points. St. Mary's chalked up 18 total team points, placing them in the position of third out of 19 teams across the state. Behind SMC came DePauw with 14 points, and in a tie for fifth place was ND and Taylor with a total of 10 points each. 
For SMC, the number one sin­gles player Barb Timm was upset in the quarter finals by Taylor with a score of 6-4, 6-0. In the number two singles position Louise Purcell lost in semi-finals to I. U. 6-2, 6-3. Noreen Bracken, number three singles player for SMC also lost in semi-finals to I. U., 6-4, 6-4. Ann Daniels number four singles player was outscored by her opponent

Another study showed that while one application of mirex could kill up to 9S percent of the fire ant population, as many as 100 appli­cations might be required to elim­inate the remaining S percent. In addition, the EPA's fire ant expert, entomologist William Hol­laway, testified in 1974 that "there are no ... criteria for establishing that a significant nuisance or economically damaging infestation ·exists in the area where the interest for treatment has been shown." Holloway cited a study which showed that almost 30 percent of the more than eight million acres sprayed with mirex in 1972 "con­tained almost no ants and therefore probably should not have been treated."

likely to remain in living and

Ali decisions Norton; retains crown 
by Ed Schuyler Jr. AP Sports Writer 

NEWYORK AP -Muhammad Ali, calling on every trick he has learned in his long and controversi­al career, pounded out a unanimous IS-round decision over Ken Norton Tuesday night and retained his world heavyweight championship. 
The 34-year-old Ali, sometimes 
in the first six rounds were short right hands, many of them leads. 
But Norton gave as good as he got and after eight rounds it seemed to be anybody's fight. 
Then, in the ninth, Ali came out dancing and jabbing and the jab was effective. The champion also shook Norton with a left-right-left to the head in the round which ended with Norton scoring a solid right to the head. 
of three bouts with Joe Frazier--an opening loss and then two victor­ies. 
And Ali's final victories over Frazier and Norton came as cham­
. pion. "I'm at the end of my career," he said befor~ the fight. "I can't lose it now." 
The win, Ali's 19th in 20 cham­pionship fights, earned him at least $6 million and set up a possible $10 
The live gate apparently will top $3 million and break the all-time record of $2,658,660 paid by 104,943 people for the second Jack Dempsey-Gene Tunney fight in 1927 at Chicago's Soldier Field. 

Revenue also will come in from :lased-circuit television to 300 loca­·ions holding 1.5 million seats in ;he United States and Canada and from telecasts to 57 other coun­tries. 
round. Norton spat out a challenge to Ali to come in and fight. 

But Ali would not be intimidated into doing something that he hadn't decided on doing. 
On the other hand, Ali failed to upset Norton with any of the congames he has used to psych opponents in the past. He went right to Norton before the introduc­tions and glared at the challenger. 
floating like the butterfly he has bragged about, other times sting­ing like a bee with solid jabs and short right leads, seemed to control the tempo from the outset although Norton kept moving forward and landed the harder punches. 
Ali even resorted to the rope-a­dope defense he used when he wrested the title away from George Foreman. 
There was only one thing he did not do. He did not destroy Norton as he predicted he would do. 
Referee Arthur Mercante scored the fight 8-6-l for Ali while judges Harold Lederman and Barney Smith each had it 8-7 for Ali. 
The Associated Press had is 9-8 for the champion. 
Norton now has gone 39 tough rounds with the man who proclaims himself the greatest fighter of all time. The only thing he has to show for it is one victory, some real good money and a night of frustra­tion. 
The defeat probably wrote an end to Norton's boxipg career. At 31 , movies seem to be more in his future than fights. 
Ali, who predicted the fight would not go more than five rounds, came out flat-footed, gun­ning for power. His best weap.ons 
In the lOth, Ali was dancing and jabbing again and Norton couldn't do anything about it. Ali made it three rounds in a row, at least on the AP card, when he took the 11th round, in which Norton imitated Alis rope-a-dope, a tactic the champ had used earlier in the fight. 
Then in the 11th, Ali scored with two telling rights, both of them leads, ·and two good lefts to the head. 
But Norton kept coming and punching with all his power, al­though he was never able to land the punch that could turn the tide for him in the final four rounds. And Ali remained effective with his left hand right to the final bell, although he missed more in the final 12 minutes than he had for most of the fight. 
The 15th round ended with 
Norton,  weighing  217V2,  hulling  
the 221-pound Ali into  a  neutral  
corner  and  scoring  with  several  

hard punches to the head and body. 
When the final bell rang, Norton had a look of jubilation on his face. 
But when he left the ring a few minutes later, there were tears in his eyes. 
The victo.ry enabled Ali to end this rough-tough series the same way he closed out his historic series million match with George Fore­man sometime next year. 
Ali was to get SO percent of all revenue over $9 million, but it was not known what the final financial 
figure  would  be.  Norton  was  
guaranteed  $1  million  and  five  
percent of all revenue.  

An announced crowd of 42,000-­many paying $200--showed up for the first fight in Yankee Stadium since Ingema~ Johansson knocked out Floyd Patterson June 26, 1959. And it was the first outdoor heavyweight championship bout in the United States since Sonny Liston's kayo of Patterson at Chi­cago's Comiskey Park Sept. 25, 1962.

Walsh, Lewis cop lnterhall victories 
by Win Palmer 

Girl's interhall football began its second week of the season last night as Walsh Hall defeated Farley Hall by the score of 14-8 and 
Lewis Hall edged Lyons Hall in a thriller 18-14. 
Walsh 14 Farley 8 

Losers by the identical score last week to Badin Hall, Walsh came out throwing the ball and complete­ly dominated the first half. Quarterback Anne Eisele of Walsh completed 6 of 8 passes in the half, many of them coming on crucial third down plays. 
On their second series of plays Walsh, aided by a personal foul committed by Farley, 
scored on a 25-yard touchdown burst. The extra point attempt was no good. Then, after a Farley fumble, Anne Eisele com­pleted a succession of passes to Jay Decio that moved the ball to the one-yard line where Eisele sneaked into the end zone. She then tossed a three-yard pass to Decio for the two;point play. The score stood at 14-0 at the end of the first half. 
Farley came out fired up in the second half. Mary Ellen Burchett intercepted a pass and returned it to the Walsh 35-yard line. Several plays later, Debbie Bieber scamp­ered 28 yards to give Farley its first points of the afternoon. Chris Datzman ran it over for the two-point conversion to make the score 14-8. That was the final score as the Walsh defense would not allow Farley to get within 30 yards of the Walsh goal line. 
Lewis 18 Lyons 14 

In a match of two powerhouses, Lewis eeked out a victory in a miraculous manner. The first half was nothing out of the ordinary, in fact the play was often sloppy. Lyons received the opening kickoff and promptly managed to fumble the first two times they ran plays. Fortunately for Lyons, each time they recovered their own fumble. The teams traded interceptions

CBS also paid $1 million to show the fight on United States home television at a later date. 
Ali was the 8-S favorite and an even bigger favorite with the crowd, which chanted "Ali, Ali," as he entered the ring. 
Then, true to his word, the champion led the fans in a cheer of "Norton must fall. Norton must fall." 
Ali also talked to Norton in many of the rounds and, on two occa­sions, was told by Mercante, "Stop talking and start fighting." 
Norton wasn't completely silent, however, in the rounds when Ali was dancing, especially the final 
with Lyons· seemingly gaining the advantage as they pinned Lewis behind their 10-yard line. Then Sue Behnke broke off tackle and outdistanced the Lyons defense to score a 73-yard touchdown. The extra point attempt was no good. The half ended as Lyons was trying 
to score from the Lewis 15-yard I . h If t k 
line. TIS go ers a e 
On the opening drive of the 

second half the Lewis backfield tore Second in tourney
up the Lyons defense. Mary Ellen Pierce ran for 20 yards up the middle. Erin Burns squirmed for 22 more yards. Then Burns dashed for a 23 yard touchdown run to make the score 12-0 as the extra point attempt failed again. At this point it appeared as if Lewis would break the game open. But Lyons stuck back. On the ensueing kickoff Jill Delucia broke five tackles to score a 60-yard touch­down. The extra point attempt was no good. 
Both teams were stopped on their next possession and as Lyons took possession of the ball with less than five minutes remaining dark­ness was setting in. On an end around play, Michelle O'Haren galloped 60 yards to score the tying TD. On a crucial extra point attempt Delucia competed a pass to O'Haren for the twq-pointer to make the score 14-12 in favor of Lyons. 
The situation looked desperate for the Lewis players as they took possession of the ball with 2 minutes togo. The first two plays went. nowhere and Lewis was forced to use their remaining timeouts. Fifty yards away from the goal line, and with only 1:35 showing on the clock, Lewis ap­peared destined for a loss. 
But on the next play quarterback Robin Jenkins handed off to Erin Burns. Burns bumped into Sue Behnke while handing the ball off and the halfback came up to completely outrun the pack and dash to a SO-yard game winning touchdown. So what appeared to be a busted play turned out to be the winning touchdown.

The Notre Dame golf team turned in one of its finest perfor­mances in recent memory as they captured second place in the rain­shortened Indiana Intercollegiate Golf Championships yesterday. 
A field of 19 teams toured the 7 ,059-yard, par-72 Golf Club of Indiana course with host Ball State University coming out on top with a score of 375. Coach Noel O'Sull ivan's Irish were two shots back at 377, last year's champion Purdue was third at 381. 
Individually for the Irish, soph­omore Biv Wadden carved out an outstanding two-over par 74 on the rain soaked course to put himself in a four-way tie for the individual champtionship. A bogey on the second sudden death hole stayed the Glenview, Illinois native from victory as he came away with the runner-up trophy. Scott Steger of champion Ball State took the individual honors. 
Notre Dame Open champion Tim Saurs came in with a 75 as did freshman John Lungren. The other freshman on the squad, Dave Knee, finished with a 76 while Bob Belmonte, a senior, closed with a 
77. Team captain Rich Knee was plagued with penalty strokes and had to settle for an 81. 
The Irish will close their fall golf season with the Notre Dame Invita­tional on Monday, October 4. The 
ten-team event is slated to begin at noon on the Burke Memorial Course.
