Martinez flown to U.S. 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Reputed Medellin cocaine cartel money launderer Eduardo Martinez Romero was flown Wednesday night by U.S. officials out of Colombia bound for the United States, an administration offi· cia! disclosed. 
Drug Enforcement Administration agent Frank Shults said. "He's in the air; coming into the United States sometime in the early morn­ing." 
Martinez was flown out of Bogota on a DEA plane, Shults said. 
Shults did not say where the plane would land. 
Martinez was arrested during the first weekend after Colombia President Virgilio Barco launched a crackdown on drug traffickers in his coun­try triggered by the Aug. 18 as­sassination of leading presiden­tial candidate Luis Carlos Galan, an outspoken foe of the drug trade. 
The Bogota newspaper El Tiempo quoted Martinez after his arrest as saying he was in­nocent. 
"At no time have I had links to the Medellin cartel and I don't know any of its mem­bers," the newspaper quoted him as saying. 
In the emergency measures imposed by Barco was a re-in­stitution of the extradition agreement with the United States that had been thrown out by the Colombian Supreme Court in 1987. 
Martinez, 35, was indicted in March in Atlanta as a result of an investigation code-named "Oporation Polar Cap" that

Registration abroad changes 
By JOHN ZALLER 
Staff Reporter 
The Office of Foreign Studies will change its registration pol­icy for overseas students this year, according to Isabel Charles, director of foreign study programs. 
Charles said the change comes because of the University's new on-line regis­tration. The on-line registra­tion will make it possible for students to register for their classes by phone and confirm almost immediately their course schedules for the follow­ing year. 
"The actual use of telephones overseas (to register) may be a problem." said Charles. She touchtone phones, which are necessary for registration, or enough phones to accommodate students overseas. 
Charles added that if tele­phones were not a possibility for registration that either a FAX machine or an express courier would be used for re­turning the students schedules to the University for faster processing of schedules. 
The former registration pro­cess entailed sending a member of the faculty to the foreign study sites where he or she would collect the schedules and bring them back to the University. 
"We hope overseas students will have the same shot at

Over the course of two years, campus housing has switched from a situation of overcrowd­ing and freshmen boarding in study lounges to empty and partially filled rooms all over campus. 
The Office of Student Residences expected some over­crowding to occur this year, according to Director Evelyn Reinebold. In preparation for this, the office sent out a bul­letin last year to all dormitory residents stating that a lottery might be used to determine who could reside in the dorms this year. 
Reinbold said, "I don't really know for certain what hap­pened... I think there were more people who moved off campus and who didn't return to the university. That took care of the problem for us." 
"We have about 52 empty male beds and 64 empty female beds," said Reinebold, adding, "the reason for the number of female beds is because of the new [women's] dorms." 
The cause of the 52 empty male beds is due to Holy Cross Hall remaining open this year. No freshmen were placed in Holy Cross because it will be closed this spring, Reinbold said. 
Farley Hall is one example of the turnaround in housing. Its capacity is 248 residents and it presently holds 243 residents. Sister Mary Louise Gude, rec­tress of Farley said, ''I'm very pleased that the returning resi­dents (from Farley who are studying abroad) will all have rooms here. This is really a wonderful situation for us...I'm 
enjoying this flexibility." 
A major cause of the new flexibility in housing has to do with the two new women's dorms, Siegfried and Knott Halls. For the first time in 
Notre Dame history, all female transfer students were able to be housed, Gude said. 
Sister Patricia Clark, rectress of Knott Hall said, "Our situation is very good. We have about 235 girls with just a few empty spaces." 
Both Knott and Siegfried have a relatively large number of freshmen (over 100) , com­pared to other dorms. Over the next two to three years, how­ever, Clark said she anticipates a greater class balance. 
According to the Office of Student Residences, the University has the capacity to house over 6,300 students. 

SMC student survives plane crash 
By CHAD KERLIN 
News Staff 
One of the worst disasters of the year, the Sioux City, Iowa crash of a United Airlines DC­1 0, holds special significance for Saint Mary's College senior Kari Milford. 
She is a survivor -one of the 186 who were lucky enough to live through the crash and its fiery aftermath. There were 11 0 others who were not so lucky. 
Milford was flying home to Marion, Ind. after a visit with her sister in Denver, Colo. last July 19 when disaster struck. The flight from Denver to Chicago went horribly wrong when the plane experienced "complete hydraulic failure" due to an explosion in the rear engine. The plane, just seconds short of a level emergency landing, plowed into the earth in a cloud of dirt, smoke and flying metal. 
"I clearly remember all the flying glass and smoke every­where. And the noise ... I guess I've just managed to block most of that out," Milford said. 
Milford was travelling beside one of her nephews, her older brother and another nephew across the aisle in the second to the last row of the plane. 
"On my other side were two old ladies. I remember they shared their Oreos with us." Milford recalled, adding, "They didn't survive. I guess it's stuff like that that really bothers me so much." 
In fact, only a handful of people in her section survived-­both her nephews and her brother were among the lucky. 
The first indications of trou­ble came over the intercom when the captain reported that they were going to have to make "a rough landing." 
Milford recalls, "I didn't re­ally realize how rough they meant. I thought it was going to be like speedbumps or some­thing. i just prayed all the way down and hoped for the best. All the passengers were great­apprehensively calm. You could tell it was serious, though, by the looks on the faces and in the eyes of the stewardesses." 
"Instead of speedbumps, the impact shook us so much that I felt like I was in a dryer, being rolled over and over. We were told to assume the crash posi­tion and even though I tried as hard as I could, my head was still flung all around." 
"When the plane settled, the stewardesses just kept yelling, 'Unfasten your seatbelts and get out; it might blow!"' 
In the confusion, Milford didn't know if her brother and nephew across the aisle were alive or even where they were,

NATIONAL BRIEFS 
Wu'er Kaixi was among China's best, a promising student at Beijing Normal University when the June events at Tiananmen Square thrust him into the forefront and then into a night for his life. Wu'er, 21, is now at Harvard University, where he will try to keep the reform movement alive. He knows he may have started a life of permanent exile, but he said Wednesday that the horror of watching his friends massacred will keep him going. He and his girlfriend completed their escape from China in June. The China Information Center at Harvard has become his home. It is through this hub's telephones, fax machines and computers that he works to effect change in his native land. 
Students and teachers infected with the AIDS virus should be free to attend class without fear their disease will be made public, a new guide for the nation's schools said Wednesday. "Someone At School Has AIDS," released by the National Association of State Boards of Education, said the deadly virus "is not transmitted by casual, everyday contact" so confidentiality should be school policy. Parents shouldn't have to reveal their child's infection if the decision is sanctioned by a physician, who finds the child does not have secondary infections, such as tuberculosis, said the guidelines. The report suggests that school superintendents be notified, but even those "decisions should be approved by the infected person and a student's parents or guardians."

"Sometimes I feel like I am going crazy. I've got all this sex-drive going in me, pounding in me. burning in me. tantalizing me. It delights and yet disturbs me; it confuses me and bewilders me. What I do about it often bothers me and makes me feel rotten about myself " 
A line from a Judy Blume novel? No, not quite. Actually it's a prayer called "For Good Attitudes Towards Sex," from the "Day by Day" prayer book. Campus Ministry puts out this gem once a year filled with prayers for the Notre Dame student. 
The book has something for everyone including one "For a Pre-med," "A Nurse's Prayer," and "Cadet Prayer." One may pray "The Party" prayer prior to going out and in the morning try "Prayer before Examinations" in case you didn't get a chance to study. 
My personal favorite is "The Cafeteria" which begins "Today I complained about the food in the cafeteria. Forgive me, Lord." My guess is Bill Hickey likes this one, too. 
You're probably wondering if I have a point to all this or if I'm just trying to get a cheap laugh. I personally would not pull out this book and try to find the prayer for the lame journalist, but the book does present a larger point about Notre Dame. Notre Dame is a Catholic University and "Day by Day" is just a small symbol of that fact. A prayer book like this is available to those who chose to express their religion as such, but Christianity is found in so many other ways at Notre Dame. 
Notre Dame is a place where you can find a friend who will walk to the Grotto and light a candle for someone you love. At a small mass in a Notre Dame dorm fellow students will listen as you offer a personal petition and they will pray for you. Here students have rectors, assistant rectors and RA's that will listen to their problems and even sometimes offer unsolicited advice just because they care. 
You cannot attend mass with the President of the University at the Grotto just anywhere. And at Notre Dame this occurs fairly often. At Notre Dame people know when someone is in need and they send cards and hold masses. In Chapels across campus people hold all-night vigils when fellow students face death

prematurely. 
Students at Notre Dame give hours a week to volunteer just because they enjoy the pleasure they can give to others. It's not uncommon to hear of students who are excellent students, athletes, involved in dorm and campus activities, yet still find time to volunteer in various service activities. How many campuses had a Christmas in April where students gave up a day to clean up the local area? 
From Campus Ministry to the residence halls to the Center for Social Concerns a Christian atmosphere pervades throughout the University. One does not need the "Day by Day" prayer book or even to go to mass to experience the feeling of caring at Notre Dame-the caring that is an integral part of what Christianity at Notre Dame is all about. 
For a long time I didn't understand what it was to go to a Catholic university, I didn't think it meant anything different from going to any other school. But to you freshmen who don't yet realize why you're at a Catholic school, you'll soon find out. Wait until something goes wrong-you'll find help and kindness all around you whether you ask for it or not. 
You'll soon realize why you felt a certain way after the first time you visited this place. You'll know why you decided that you just had to come here. Notre Dame is a great university, but more importantly Notre Dame is a great Catholic University. It's hard to explain, but anyone who has been in need and been at Notre Dame has certainly felt what is so special about a Catholic university, especially this one. 
The formal opening of the school year will take place in Stepan Center at 10 a.m. Sunday, Sept. 10, with a concelebrated mass. The presiding celebrant will be University President Father Edward Malloy. All members of the faculty are expected to attend the opening mass and to participate in the academic proces­sion in academic robes.

Psychiatrists establish program for satanic teenagers 
Associated Press 
CIIICAGO-Psychiatrists and psychologists at Hartgrove Hospital bristled Wednesday at being called modern-day exor­cists, but they are creating one of the nation's first treatment programs to wean teenagers from Satanism. 
"In no way are we compara­ble to the old exorcists," said Michael Weiss, an adolescent psychologist at the North Side hospital, which plans to begin offering the program this month. 
"The kids who will be admit­ted will be here primarily be­cause of their behavioral and

"I told my nephew, 'Run! Run as fast as you can!' All around me were people I just knew were dead; some of them were still strapped in their seats. It emotional problems. No one will be hospitalized for strange beliefs or unusual values that we would disagree with," Weiss said. 
"I don't think there is any doubt Satanism is a growing problem," said social worker Dale Trahan, who has been re­searching satanic beliefs for three years and was contracted to organize the program for Hartgrove's new Center for the Treatment of Ritualistic Deviance.

Milford didn't get to the hos­pital for about an hour where they quickly set about scrub­bing the tar from her many wounds and setting her badly crushed left hand. 
Milford spent eight days in the hospital in Sioux City be­fore returning to Marion. There she had daily three-hour ses­sions with doctors until return­ing to Saint Mary's. She contin­ues to see doctors each week.

More such programs will be needed as police, teachers and parents learn to recognize in­volvement, said Jerry Simandl, a Chicago police youth officer and expert on satanic cults, who has helped train Hartgrove staff. 
"That's been the problem. There aren't places to take the kids," Simandl said. 
In the program, teenagers will spend four to eight weeks as in-patients and undergo in­dividual and group counseling. Most of the youths will be ad­mitted voluntarily. 
Hartgrove's facility -to be staffed by ~pecially trained psy­chiatrists, p:;;ychologists, social workers and nurses -should receive its first patients in two to four weeks, and initially will take as many as six patients at a time, Weiss said. A similar program exists at Denver's Bethesda PsychHealth. 
The new program will seek to undermine Satanism's underly­ing belief system, which ham­pers conventional treatment. 
Satanism "gives them the promise of power and privilege beyond anything they ever imagined. Not only can they have everything they want ... but can do so while totally in­dulging themselves in drugs, sex or any momentary plea­sure," Weiss said. 
"We try to help them see how unrealistic the promises are. Our ultimate goal is to make them able to function in the world so they can have a rea­sonable and successful life for themselves and not harm any­one else." 
Youngsters involved in Satanism often exhibit unusual behavior, which can include suicide attempts, violent rages, rejection of family, drug use, sexual promiscuity, a drastic drop in grades, intensified re­bellion, a strong interest in heavy-metal music, role-playing games or horror films, and the use of occult symbols such as "666" or upside-down crosses. 

SMC Board discusses Alcohol Awareness 
By LAUREL VITALE 
News Staff 
Saint Mary's Board of Governance met Wednesday to discuss plans for Alcohol Awareness Week and cultural diversity seminars to be held this semester. 
Student Body President, Lisa Catenacci, and student govern­ment leaders are involved in planning the Alcohol Awareness Week, which is scheduled for October 15-21. The activities are being directed toward peo­ple who are "aware of the po­tential dangers of alcohol but don't realize hvw easiiy over­whelming it can be," Catenacci said. 
There will be an alcohol and relationships panel consisting of students and faculty to re­late personal stories and ideas on alcohol and how it can be enjoyed but not abused. 
A cultural diversity seminar will be held October 12 with ac­tor Gene Carlo Esposito. The star of the movie "Do the Right Thing" will be facilitating a dis­cussion at Saint Mary's con­cerning cultural diversification on Saint Mary's and Notre Dame's campuses.

The change in registration comes at a time when some students ·are unhappy with the current foreign study registra­tion po !icy. 
"I was very satisfied with my course selection, but I know other students who had prob­lems, especially with the English department," said Mike Donovan. a senior philosophy major who studied in London during the spring semester. "There were quite a few dissat­isfied English majors in London," he added. 
"The problems that oceurred in London were the same prob­lems here," said Anastasia Gutting, director of the London Program. According to Gutting, the policy of eheckmarking courses makes course selection very uncertain even for those on campus. 
The London Program, inde­pendent of the Offiee of Foreign Studies, has already initiated using an express courier to re­turn sehedules for prompt reg­istration. The main problem with registering students, said Gutting, is the lack of personnel in the London Program office. 
"Hight now we have two peo­ple in the office to deal with 80 students eaeh semester and the Hegistrar's Office didn't seem conscious of that until last year," Gutting said. 
"We will see to it that stu­dents on the London Program have the same advantage (for registration) as all other stu­dents at Notre Dame," said Gutting.

Nation reacts to Bush plan to combat drugs 
Associated Press 
President Bush's pledge to fight drugs "block by block, child by child" was a popular sound bite on newscasts Wednesday, but when young people on one bloek were asked if the war on drugs could be won. most were pessimistic. 
"It's going to take a lot, because it's not just the students, it's like everybody, you know, policemen, people like that, the big people," said Yolanda Brown, 17, one of a group of students interviewed Wednesday outside T.C. 
Williams High School in Alexandria, Va., about Bush's speech the night before. 
The chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority, Vince Lane, said on "CBS This Morning" that the president had taken an important step by throwing down the gauntlet. 
"I was surprised to hear that we did get $50 million alloeated to public housing ....With about $30 million here in Chicago I can clean up every troubled 
high-rise  in  the  city.  So  the  
money  will  be  very  much  
appreciated."

The Observer is the independent newspaper published by the students of the University of Notre Dame duLac and Saint Mary's College. It does not necessarily reflect the policies of the administration of either institution. The news is reported as accurately and objective­ly as possible. Unsigned editorials represent the opinion of the majority of the following: Ed­itor-in-Chief, Managing Editor, Executive News Editor, Viewpoint Ed1tor, Sports Ed1tor, Ac­cent Editor, Photo Editor, Saint Mary's Editor. Commentaries, letters, and the Inside Column present the views of their authors. Column space is available to all members of the community and the free expression of varying opinions on campus, through letters, is encouraged. 
Making the grade without making the sacrifice 
It's 10:58 and you have two minutes to finish your pop tart, brush your teeth, pack your books and high-tail it to class. Though life may be a bit hectic at this moment, you may still have time to ask yourself one very important question. 
Why did l choose such an early class? Or possibly, why am l even going to class at all? 
Answering such a question might require more than a modicum of thought. After all, you've been in school for nearly all of your life, so there must be some reason for forcing yourself to make the trek to class. To get a good job? To make mom and dad proud? 
flow about because you might enjoy learning? Sorry, not on this campus. Saying those words at most parties is an offense punishable by expulsion, or at least, banishment to a corner by yourself. 
You're safe, however, if you

Viewpoint Editor 
answered. "I like to learn, but only in class. Outside of class I like to have fun." 
The column by Victor Krebs which appeared in Viewpoint yesterday gave a fitting answer. "What we do in class should not end in class, and what we do in our social life should extend into our class­rooms." We are the same people both in the classroom and out. If you view your education as a sacrifice, you might as well not be at Notre Dame. 
The desire to learn and the desire to have fun aren't mu­tually exclusive. The problem occurs when we separate our lives into "study mode" and "party mode." Both the desire to learn and the desire to have fun should exist side by side. Have fun while you're learning and learn while you're having fun. 
Learn while you're having

fun? Why not? All that's necessary is a little change in attitude. Be open to ~arning wherever you are, whether in a classroom, or in the dorm hallway talking politics at 
3:00 a.m., or at the Commons on Saturday night. 
You could even be learning at an off-campus party. What can you learn at an off­campus party? Much, though maybe not the same kinds of things you might learn in class. If one of the reasons you're going out is to meet new people you're already on the right track. 
Find out about other people. Find out what is important to them and what you like about them. Are they serving two kinds of beer? Find out which kind you like best. All this falls under "learning" as much as any classroom. You can learn even when you're not making an effort to learn, as long as you leave yourself open 
Notre Dame abounds with opportunities to expand your horizons. There is a wealth of information here, all free for the taking (or for $14,000, depending on how you look at it).Many of the resources that are available here will be much harder to come by after you leave. Make your learning fun and you won't let a day go by without discovering some­thing new. 

LETTERS 
Graduated tax falls short 
Dear Editor: 
Last Wednesday, Leona Helmsley was pronounced guilty of evading 2 percent of her federal income taxes between 1983 and 1985. Her lawyers disagree, claiming that the tax laws are written in such a way that she may not really have been legally responsible for that 2 percent. For the purposes of this letter, l will assume that the tax laws in this country are clear as a bell, and Leona Helmsley did fail to pay $1.2 million out of the $59.9 million that many people refer to as "her fair share." I wish to address the question: Is it "fair" that some people pay $59.9 million in taxes when they use less governmental ser­vices than the people who pay only a few thousand or, for that matter, no taxes at all? I also wish to examine the philo­sophical implications of a graduated income tax. 
Politicians long ago figured out that they could promise all kinds of special interest groups all kinds of money in order to get elected. I have never under­stood why it is considered a bribe to offer a politician money in return for a favor, but it is not a bribe when the politician offers money in re­turn for votes. The big swindle lies in the fact that the govern­ment does not make any money of its own. Every penny that it gives out, it must take from somewhere else. 
Right now, the majority of your tax dollars does not bene­fit you. Instead, they are spent on others all around the globe, on programs that in many cases are counter-productive to their causes. Hundreds of bil­lions of our dollars each year go to welfare programs in this country and others. To ask for money and help for people in need is the proper, moral way to conduct such business. To hold a gun to our heads and say, "pay up or go to jail" is stealing. Also, to the extent that you involuntarily work for other people, you are a slave. Is Leona the real criminal in this game? 
The concept of a graduated income tax is worse than a flat tax percentage. A graduated income tax essentially punishes the productive for being pro­ductive: the more someone pro­duces, the more that is taken from him or her. In this coun­try, the businesses that make the most money are the ones that have the most value to so­ciety. They produce the best products (if they didn't, they wouldn't be the ones making a lot of money), and they provide the most jobs. Their products, inventions, and ingenuity have made our standard of living the highest in the world. These are the people that, by our current tax laws, must pay the most taxes and the highest percent­age. 
On the other hand, there are people who never acquired the knowledge to be productive enough to support even them­selves. There are people who never stopped to think that they should not have children before they could afford them. These people do not pay taxes; instead they are paid out of tax dollars. The system ends up punishing the competent for being competent and rewarding the incompetent for being in­competent. A system that holds thinking and producing as vices and nonthinking and nonpro­ducing as virtues is doomed for destruction.

Fr. Nouwen shares his L'Arche family with NO 
.,;;· 

Father Henri Nouwen (I) and companion Bill Van Buren at L'Arche community in Toronto. Nouwen discusses 

the L'Arche experience tonight in Washington Hall. 
CINDY PETRITES accent writer 
Father Henri Nouwen is a man of passion. When he speaks, his hands fly. He points, waves, pounds on the podium, engaging and enthralling his audience. But it is not the former Notre Dame professor's pronounced Dutch accent or his wild gesticulations which captivate the crowd. He may be fascinating to watch, but his words are electric. At 8:00 p.m. in Washington Hall, Nouwen kicks off the Year of the Family as he returns with four members of his new family, the L'Arche Daybreak community, to share his story of involvement with L'Arche, his journey to Daybreak, and his reflections on the theme of "God's love in care and community." 
Nouwen, one of today's foremost spiritual writers and a former professor at Harvard, Yale, and Notre Dame, is currently spiritual leader of the L'Arche community in Toronto. He is accompanied by Gregory Lannan, Karen Neale, Joe Vorstermans, and John Guido who are members of L'Arche. An international network of more than 80 communities, L'Arche was founded 20 years ago by Frenchman Jean Vanier for mentally ~andicapped persons and their assistants to live together accordmg to the gospel. Nouwen and his companions live and work at Daybreak, the first L'Arche community in North America. 
Says Nouwen, "It's not an institution. It's not a group home. It's not even an organization which wants to help as many mentally handicapped persons as possible. It's a spiritual community where handicapped people are in the center. L'Arche

To be Continued 
Airing at 8:00 p.m. on Wednesdays, "Night" presents the adventures and scandals faced by the police force of a small Southern town. Inspired by a movie of the same title, this program fills each episode with clever writing, powerful storylines, and compelling characters. Carroll O'Connor (from "All In The Family") stars as Chief Gillespie, and his partner, Virgil Tibbs (Howard Rollins), is a police officer from Philadelphia whose fast-paced O'Connor), and Sergeant Parker (David Hart). 
The writers chose to deal with quite intense subjects, and they are aggressively portrayed. One episode, for example, copes with the problem of wife abuse. The storyline graphically presents the cruel and violent nature of this very real problem; however, the writers manage to add a twist to the plot, as they do in most of the episodes. 
As the mystery surrounding a

Southern woman's bruises evolves, so too does a mystery surrounding Tibbs' childhood. When the episode ends, the woman comes to grips with the fact that her husband --and 
exists not to help the mentally handicapped get 'normal,' but to help them share their spiritual gifts with world." Nouwen's words echo those of Notre Dame sophomore Anna Wiese who recently completed a nine-week Summer Service Project at the Daybreak community. Said she of her project, "It gave me a better understanding of what the handicapped have to offer to society. They are not so much disabled as they are differently abled." 
One of the individuals accompanying Nouwen is Gregory Lannan, 34. After suffering a stroke at age five and living in an institution for mentally handicapped people in Canada, he moved to L'Arche ten years ago. Lannan now works for a grocery store and will present reflections on his life from the institution to L'Arche tonight. Friday afternoon, he will also make presentations to a small group of interested students and faculty for the Psychology Department and to Father Patrick Gaffney's anthropology course. 
"Most people don't realize what the handicapped are capable of," agrees Center for Social Concerns Director Father Don McNeill. He stresses that Nouwen's talk will interest anyone who has worked with the mentally handicapped, who has a mentally handicapped family member, or who wants to learn more about the developmentally disabled. "There is so much beauty to be found in those considered the least of our brothers and sisters. There is so much they can teach us." 
Tonight in Washington Hall, Nouwen and his companions will attempt to share that beauty, to transmit that passion, and to show Notre Dame another example of God's love and care in the community which they call home. 
Adding to the intense realism depicted on "In the Heat of the Night" are the characters. Chief Gillespie is a compassion­ate, caring gentleman who uses all the resources at hand -­even if it means dealing with criminals to catch other crimi­nals. Tibbs, on the other hand, is an urban family man. He cares deeply for his wife and children, but puts everything in the back of his mind when dealing with a case. 
A review of "Heat" wouldn't be complete without a comment on Carroll O'Connor. His pres­ence in the program is flawless. His Southern accent is quite believable. Fans of "All in the Family" will be amazed at O'Connor's switch of character. He's genuine and superb. 
NBC's "In the Heat of the Night" is a compelling program

The burial coincided with the opening of classes at Yale, and many passing students wanted to know what was going on. There had been no announce­ment about the time or even the date of the funeral.

-he also got there in 1986 ­and he ended Noah's string of five-set victories and surprising success at Flushing Meadow. 
Just a week ago, Becker was headed out of the tournament he has never come close to win­ning. He was down two match points in the second round to Derrick Rostagno. But, with great help from a net cord, the second seed rallied and has gotten stronger since. 

For Noah, once ranked fourth in the world and now 23rd, it was a prime-time dis­appointment. The Frenchman had overcome a two-set deficit to beat Amos Mansdorf in a bitter third-round match. Then he outlasted No. 10 Alberto Mancini in another emotional match. 
But he had nothing left for Becker and once again failed to make a Grand Slam semifinal; Noah hasn't gotten to the final four of a major tournament since his French Open title in 1983. ­
On the women's side, Steffi Graf and Gabriela Sabatini, last year's finalists, took different routes into the semifinals. 
Graf, the top seed and defending champion, needed only 44 minutes to rout No. 8 Helena Sukova, 6-1, 6-1. It was the 11th straight victory over Sukova for Graf, winner of six

Falcons close to agreement with Sanders 
Associated Press 
SUWANEE, Ga. -Deion Sanders said goodbye to the New York Yankees Wednesday night and apparently headed for the Atlanta Falcons with whom he reached a tentative contract agreement earlier in the evening. 
The Falcons announced the 
agreement with the defensive 
back from Florida State, their 
No. 1 draft choice and the 
NFL's fifth overall, just as the 
Yankees were starting their 
game in Seattle with Sanders as 
the left fielder. 
Falcons spokesman Charlie Taylor said Sanders' agent was trying to reach the athlete and that the team wanted him in training camp Thursday to take his physical and begin practice. 
After striking out in the sixth 
inning, Sanders went down the 
Yankees dugout shaking hands 
and then was seen heading for 
the locker room carrying two 
bats and his glove. Luis Polonia 
replaced Sanders in left in the 
bottom of the inning. 
There are two late evening flights from Seattle to Atlanta. 
Taylor said the agreement came about 10 p.m. EDT after eight hours of negotiations in Suwanee between team finan­cial officer Jim Hay and Sanders' agent, Steve Zucker. 
No contract details were re­leased.

HALEIGII, N.C.-The NCAA's preliminary report on possible rules violations in the North Carolina State basketball pro­gram contains serious allega­tions but does not support elaims of drug abuse or grade changing, the school's ehancel­lor said Wednesday. 
The report, released to re­porters with the names of play­ers blacked out, focuses on claims that players sold com­plimentary basketball tickets and athletic shoes, received dis­counts not available to other students and accepted free food and lodging from athletic boosters. 
!lead basketball coach Jim Valvano said he did not know players were selling tickets and shoes, but said he could under­stand why they would. 
"If you don't have any money

and you only get room, board. books, tuition and fees, what do you do? How do you

go home for the holidays? How do you buy a birthday present? 
000 

So when someone said 'Why . would a kid sell a ticket?' I as­
sume the answer is -for the money," Valvano said. "Now does that make it right? I didn't say that, no. It's a viola­tion. 
000" 
Valvano said he was ready to suffer any penalties the NCAA handed down. 
The university will now try to follow up on the claims before going before the NCAA's Committee on Infractions. 
"I want to assure you we are taking these as very serious matters," Chancellor Bruce Poulton said at a news confer­ence.

ND wrestlers benefit from Soviet Union trip 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Associate Sports Editor 
It started out simply enough. 
A group of members from the Notre Dame wrestling team, touring the Soviet Union last summer. went outside with a bat and ball while staying at an Olympic training center in the eity of Minsk. 
The next thing they knew, they were introducing a large contingent of Soviet athletes to the game of softball. 
"We started playing, and all the Hussian kids started watching," Irish coach Fran McCann wrote in a journal he kept during the trip. "One by om1, they started to play until we had a bunch. It was like 
Good Morning Vietnam." 
That eventually led to a game between the Soviets and the Fighting Irish, who began their 10-day tour on May 22. the day after seniors Pat Boyd, Jerry Durson and Chris Geneser graduated. This game had quite a few moments of high comedy. 
"They were doing things we wouldn't even think of," said senior 118-pounder Andy Radenbaugh. "There were these shot putters there, and all they wanted to do was hit the ball. They'd just hit it, then sit there, laugh and watch the ball. They would forget to run." 
While that game lacked a lit­tle in the way of competion, Notre Dame's exhibition

Victory boosts Irish to 1-2 in young season 
Koneval scored at the 67:36 mark. Pendergast's overtime heroics allowed the Irish to notch their first victory of the season. 
Notre Dame coach Dennis Grace was glad to notch the 1OOth victory of his collegiate career, but was not too pleased with his team's performance. 
"It's a win. I'll take it," Grace said, "But we were lucky to come out on top. I was disap­pointed with the three goals we 
wrestling matches with Soviet club teams turned out much closer than McCann ever could have hoped. Notre Dame was the first collegiate wrestling team to make a competitive tour of the Soviet Union. 
"We were going over there just trying to be competitive and not be embarrassed," said McCann. "As it turned out, we easily could have won every match." 
The Notre Dame team, which finished 21st in the nation last year. had to com pete in freestyle wresting in the Soviet Union. The freestyle method differs somewhat from the col­legiate style the Fighting Irish practice in the States. 
Notre Dame still won one of four matches, coming within striking distance in each of the losses. 
The Irish lost 7-5 in two matches at Moscow, won 6-5 at Minsk and lost 8-4 to Leningrad, the fourth best club team in the Soviet Union. Pat Boyd, an All-American last spring at Notre Dame, went through the tour undefeated. 
"They were in season at the time too," said McCann, whose Notre Dame team had closed its season in March. "You'd figure that they'd be so much better conditioned than us, but it wasn't the case." 
The Soviet wrestlers also dis-

It didn't take long for Pendergast to come to the res­cue. Although he is the smallest member of tho team at 5'8" and 145 pounds, Kevin possesses the skills coach Grace has boen looking for on the front line. 
His first collegiate goal, on an assist from Mitch Kern, was a big one for the Irish. The men in blue and gold had to endure an intense thunderstorm on the way home, but if it hadn't been for the heroics of a 5'8" fresh­man from Simsbury, Connecticut, the bus ride home might have been a lot stormier. 

After toiling for four seasons as a backup quarterback, Steve Belles finally got his first start last week -at flanker. 
Actually, that start wasn't any great cause for celebration. He earned the starting role after Raghib Ismail had missed two days of practice with bruised toes. and left soon afterward to watch the Rocket put on a vir­tuoso performance (five catches for 121 yards) against an outmanned Virginia sec­ondary. 
"Rocket's our money man." said Belles. "If we're going uptown, we're going with him." 
Nonetheless, the new position allowed Belles, who has earned respect from Irish coaches and fans for his versatility, to add to his ever-growing resume. 
Upon arriving at Notre Dame from Phoenix (Ariz.) St. Mary's, where he quarter­backed the Knights to a state championship in 1984, Belles spent all his time on the side­lines backing up Steve Beuerlein and Terry Andrysiak at quarterback. 
Belles, the second leading passer in Arizona high school history, never has spent much time quarterbacking at Notre Dame, with a career total of three completions in seven attempts for 111 yards. two touchdowns and an interception. 
But over the last three years, the fifth-year senior has done everything possible to add to the Irish fortunes. He became a rarity among collegiate quarterbacks by contributing on special teams, and he has gained 143 yards on 38 career carries during his occasional turns at tailback. 
He even combined the two talents last sea­son against Air Force, lining up at tailback and taking a pitch from quarterback Tony Rice, then throwing a 50-yard touchdown bomb to Ricky Watters. 
The former high school free safety has even helped out on defense, making a tackle for a loss of one yard against Miami last season when the Hurricanes attempted to fake a punt. 
In his Fiesta Bowl homecoming, he gained 
Steve Megargee 
Football Notebook 
10 yards on three carries as the Irish won a national championship in his hometown. 
Now. with four years of experience and an economics degree in hand, Notre Dame's resident nomad may have finally found a po­sition he can call his own. 
With the Irish suffering from a lack of depth at the wideout positions and the emer­gence of freshman quarterbacks Riek Mirer and Jake Kelchner, Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz moved Belles to flanker two weeks be­fore the Kickoff Classic. 
"It's a lot more tiring here," said Belles. ''I've got to block instead of shying away. I've lost like eight pounds." 
The switch, to a position Belles has never played. probably spells the end for his days at quarterback and tailback. 
"It's fun," Belles said of his new position. "Instead of being more finesse and just knowing the situation, I had a chance to hit somebody. I really don't have any troubles catching the ball." 
Belles says he has received several tips from Notre Dame's starting receivers ­Ismail and split end Pat Eilers. Belles is listed as the number-two flanker with sophomore Tony Smith the second-team split end. 
Although he knows he needs some work at his new position, particularly in blocking, Belles is confident of succeeding at 11anker. From his years at quarterback, he knows what he likes in receivers. 
"If you know somebody can catch the ball well, you feel confident that if you throw it to them, they'll do the job," Belles said. "I know that as a quarterback. Tony (Rice) said he liked throwing to me, and that's all that mat­ters."
