Sec. of State Baker visits, offers East Germany U.S. support 
POTSDAM, East Germany (AP) -Secretary of State .lanws Baker ventured into East Germany on Tuesday and of­fered U.S. economic assistance to still another Soviet ally bent on reform. 
The bold and unprecedented visit to the site where the World War II Allies decided the future of a vanquished Germany was made after Baker sent a tele­gram to Moscow,. advising the Sovints of his intentions. 
In a 65-minute session with Prime Minister Hans Modrow and then a in separate talk in a 19th century church with Lutheran ministers. Baker reg­istered support for thn changes sweeping the one-time Stalinist state and said the Bush admin­istration was prepared to pro­vide the kind of help due Poland and Hungary as they turn to­ward market economies. 
But he emphasized that the change must be peaceful. U.S. officials said Baker was con­cerned that retribution against former Communist Party offi­cials could turn into uncontrol­!able violence with unpre­dictable consequences to its neighbors . 
Standing alongside Modrow at the conclusion of their meet­ing, Baker said they had talked about "the importance of mov­ing forward peaceably and in a stable way." 
"It is that, as much as any­thing else, that represents the political signal that we desire to send by being here today," Baker said. 
The prime minister, who was lifted by the changes in East Germany from a minor party post, told Baker the evolution in the country, which will lead to multiparty elections in May, was "irreversible," U.S. offi­cials said. 
Modrow's public statement was cautious. He said his ses­sion with Baker was the begin­ning of a dialogue that would turn out to be cooperative.

Security identifies suspect in LaFortune break-in 
By KELLEY TUTHILL 
Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame Security has a suspect in the November 30 break-in of the LaFortune Student Center, said Rex Hakow. director of Security. 
"We are trying to locate the suspect," said Rakow. He would not say whether the suspect was an employee of the University. but said that the person is a "town per­son." 
The fingerprints and the blood samples taken from the building were sent to a lab and he said results take several weeks. 
John Moorman, director of maintenance, said that the original damage estimate was $1 ,600. Now however he estimates that figure to be $2,000. 
He said that the South Stair doors on second and third floors of the building must be replaced at a cost of $400 per door. 
The information desk on the first floor had a window broken, Moorman said. 
The office door and win­dow in Room 201 must be repaired, said Moorman. In Room 216, he said a large office wall window must be replaced and on the third floor of the building, a door window in Room 315 was broken. 
The exterior windows have 
already  been  replaced,  
Moorman  said.  Windows  
were  broken  at  the  

Travelmore agency in the basement and the North ramp door, he said. 
"We are in the process of doing all the repairs," said Moorman. He said the lead time for the door delivery is somewhat long, but he hopes they will be replaced "in the next couple of weeks."

ND activities planned for '90's

Increased travel sponsorship, concert sponsorship, and fac­ulty involvement in extracurric­ular events are some changes students can look forward to in the 1990s, according to Joe Cassidy, director of Student Ac­tivities. 
Student Activities sponsored trips to athletic events and to foreign countries will be more common, he said. A summer trip to Europe in 1990 has been planned, and travel discounts and arrangements for the Or­ange Bowl will mark the first sponsorship of travel to an athletic event, as "there seems to be a demand there." said Cassidy. 
Concerts by progressive groups which draw smaller crowds will be held in Stepan Center, he said, and an effort will be made to arrange activi­ties which complement the aca­demic side of Notre Dame. 
"There's so much you can learn through experience," said Cassidy, "You can learn about something in a classroom, but to experience it gives you a much broader perspective." 

In conjunction, Cassidy men­tioned faculty help with student businesses, media, and organi­zations. 
The DeBartolo Center for Performing Arts, scheduled to be completed in 1992, will also have an impact on student ac­tivities, Cassidy said. 
The center's targets are the­atre and music, he said, and the new center will accommodate acts that otherwise might not appear in Washington Hall for lack of time. 
"We're starting to see an in­crease in student groups doing their own theatrical and musi­cal performances." said Cas­sidy. 
Additional buildings to ap­pear in the '90s include the ·Hesburgh Center Tor Interna­tional Studies, the DeBartolo classroom building, a new business school, and new grad­uate student housing. 
The Hesburgh CentPr for In­ternational Studies will house, among other things, the Helen Kellogg Institute for Interna­tional Studies and the Institute for International Peace Studies, according to Father William Beauchamp, executive vice president of Notre Dame. 
The center will consist of three buildings. One building will be made up of apartments for resident scholars, a second will have office space, and a third will have meeting rooms for the general public, said Beauchamp. 
The Hesburgh buildings should be completed in about a year, he said; the classroom building by 1992, and the busi­ness school around 1994. Addi­tional graduate housing should be built around 1992, Beauchamp said.

DETROIT (API -It's 7:16 
a.m. on Tuesday, March 19, 1996. 
You've finished a light break­fast and head toward the garage. You fish out a key chain from your pocket as you walk, push a button on a poker-chip size disk. 
The garage door opens. 
Inside sits the vehicle you bought two months ago for about $24,000. There is no dis­cernible joint between any of the windows and the plastic body parts. The car is a pastel blue, and sleek. 
Like the minivans of the last decade, the car can be used to haul dozens of bags of gro­ceries, a Little League team or baggage for a family vacation. 
Unlike the popular vehicles of the mid-and late 1980s, it is much more powerful, cleaner­running and more fuel-efficient. 
America's wheels in the 1990s probably won't be the stuff of cartoons and designers' dreams. The changes may come more in the materials they are made of and in what powers them than in what they look like. 
Automakers are working hard to shrink the time it takes to bring a car from a drawing board to the end of the assem­bly line. Consumers will find changes coming faster than ever as companies react more quickly to the marketplace. 

· Auto industry executives and observers predict the line be­tween trucks and cars will al­most disappear as the designs for each converge and the gov­ernment moves toward stan­dardizing safety requirements for both classes of vehicles. 
As you approach the vehicle, you push another button on the disk. 
The car's interior lights come on. Its engine starts. 
The driver's seat and back adjusts for you. The head/amps turn on. The radio comes to life, scanning to your favorite station and locking it in. 
The cellular phone on the console switches on, waiting for your instruction to call the office. 
A television-like screen lights up. It shows you walking up behind your own car. 
Advanced features in the cars of the 1990s will be limited mostly by the pocketbook. The technology is available today, and will be refined in the next few years, to make many things possible in a vehicle. 
But one of the main factors in 
owning a  car  -price  - will  
come into play.  
"Is  it  feasible?  Yes,"  said  

Tom Gale, vice president for design at Chrysler Corp. "Is it there for the masses? I think you have to step back and take a look at cost, market trends and regions of the country.

Bradford
partial, yet the freshman class of this Boehm esteemed University Graphic Artist finds itself subjected to a double standard. 
Head carefully into 

the infamous Honor Code and see what I ---------­mean. 
Appendix A of the llonor Code describes the policies concerning English papers. A doser look shows that this policy only deals with freshmen and the Freshman Writing Program. 
Father Oliver Williams, assistant provost and coordinator of the University Code of I Ionor Committee, said this policy was im­plemented before the Honor Code and applies to all students at Notre Dame. Upperclassmen trying to follow these rules might overlook this section because it dearly addresses freshmen. 
Secondly, Appendix A does not include any information regarding assignments other then papers. A student from any class can submit and re-submit computer programs (or parts thereof) for different classes, such as two levels of the same programming language; projects for classes such as architecture or art; or designs for a studio or a design class. 
In other words, it is entirely acceptable to hand in twice work other then papers. Williams said the reasoning behind not pre­senting the same paper was due to a belief that the student should go through the learning process involved in writing a paper. But isn't there scholarship involved in the creation of a project for any of these other courses? 
If upperclassmen are ever called to a I Ion or Code hearing on this subject they can truthfully say that it does not apply to them. 
This Appendix also does not go far enough to explain modified papers. It does not, for example, say whether one can reuse a work cited page or thesis statement. What about rewriting a fictional paper with the same theme? The slim Code of Ilonor pamphlet does not address these issues. 
On an extreme, the Department of English, which "developed and approved... these principles," insists that this resubmission of papers is plagiarism. I never though I would have to tell the Department of English this but ... ] According to the Oxford American Dictionary, plagiarism is "to take and use another person's ideas or writings or inten­tions as one's own." The use of a person's own paper is surely not infringing on the ideas, writings, etc., of a professor. The words, ideas and intentions are all the stu­dent's own. 
Williams said the Honor Code Committee has been meeting every other week to amend the Honor Code. 
Here is some advice to that committee: please make a code that is comprehensively fair by including all upperclassmen, clear about what is and is not permissible and concise so we don't have to decipher the code.

Mass transit in '90's doomed to increased congestion 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -The 1990s will bring new trolleys and high-speed trains, and ef­forts to develop hypersonic planes. But the decade will re­semble the '80s for people stuek in dogged airports and bumper-o-bumper traffic. 
"If you're looking at the '90s, the automobile will remain the dominant mode of travel," said researeher Lyn Long. of the In­stitute of Transportation Stud­ies at the University of Califor­nia, Irvine. 
"Because of increasing auto ownership and two-worker households. there will be more cars on the road and the sys-tern will never keep pace," she said. Urban traffic congestion will be "status quo or worse." 
The Federal Highway Admin­istration says 110 million U.S. commuters now spend 2 billion hours a year in traffic jams. That will increase to 10 billion hours by 2005. 
As usual. Southern California will be in the forefront of the traffic troubles. One study pre­dicts average speed on freeways and highways in this region will drop from 35 mph to 19 mph by 2010. 
Experts say air pollution and possible oil shortages in the 1990s will spur production of cleaner. higher-mileage cars; increased use of vehicles that run on methanol. natural gas. electricity or solar power; con­struction of more trolleys and other "light rail" systems; and more vacation travel by trains, planes and cruise ships. 
With the nation's expressway system almost complete, in­creased attention will be paid to "traffic management" mea­sures, like those credited with keeping Los Angeles freeways free-flowing during the 1984 Olympics, said Peter Gordon, director of the University of Southern California's Planning Institute. 
Traffic management includes synchronized traf!ic lights. me­tered on-ramps, carpool and bus lanes, quicker towing at accident sites, adding narrower lanes without widening free­ways, more one-way streets. re­versible traffic lanes, staggered work hours, and limits on times trucks can move goods. 
But these strategies haven't helped much in the past, and seemed to work during the Olympics because many people "were so scared (by gridlock predictions) that they stopped driving," said Langhorne Bond, ex-president of the American Association of State Jlighway and Transportation Officials. 
Dashboard navigation sys­tems that give drivers traffic information to avoid congestion "will gradually come into widespread use between now and the year 2000," consultant Robert L. French wrote reeently in The Futurist magazine. 
Twenty-live cars are involved in testing such a system on Los Angeles' Santa Monica Free­way. 
Beyond 2000, radar cruise controls might allow auto con­voys to speed down freeways at 70 mph, spaeed only feet apart. A prototype will be tested soon near San Diego. 

Baker 
continued from page 1 
World War II division of de­feated Germany, was added suddenly to his schedule late Monday night. 
In the morning, Baker sent a telegram to Moscow to advise the Soviet Union of his plan. There was no immediate reply. But a senior U.S. official told reporters on Baker's flight to Brussels on Tuesday night for meetings later in the week with NATO and European Commu­nity leaders that "the Soviets will be very pleased with the faet that we had this meeting." 
The official. who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both the Soviets and the East Germans had advised the United States that they wanted the reform to proeeed. "I don't anticipate any problem at all from that standpoint," he said. 
Baker is the first secretary of state to hold talks with East German officials. Two of his predecessors. John Foster Dulles in the 1950s and William Hogers in 1971. visited East Berlin. but they did not go be­yond the Soviet-controlled sec­tor of the former capital. 
Former President Harry Truman's participation in the Potsdam conference in 1945 earried him beyond Berlin. But Truman met with Soviet leader Josef Stalin and British Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and Clmlllmt Attlee. 
"I felt it was important that we have an opportunity to let the premier and the people of the (;erman Democratic Hepub­lie know of our support for the reforms that are taking place 
in this country," Baker said 
when asked to explain the deci­
sion to go to Potsdam. 
"We wanted to make sure 
they are aware of the support 
that exists in the United States 
for the democratic process. We 
also wanted to make it very 
clear that we support the pro­
cess of reform in a peaceful 
way," he said. 
The Lutheran ministers, some of whom were opponents of the Communist government, as­sured Baker they would con­tinue to advance reforms while also doing what they could to keep the political upheaval on a peaceful plane, the U.S. officials said. 
While Baker made no explicit promises to Modrow, they said, he held out the prospect of lower tariffs provided the East German government took legal steps to ensure the right to em­igrate to the West. 
lie also told Modrow that East Germany could expect the same kind of aid from the West that is being extended to Hun­gary and Poland "if you carry forward with your reforms as you have promised the people you are going to do, and you have a government that can speak for the people and that represents the people," a senior 
U.S official said. 
Before Baker crossed into East Germany he celebrated the opening of the opening of the Bnrlin Wall and made a speech outlining the Bush administra­tion's proposed "new architec­ture" for a changing Europe, with a larger role for the North Atlantie Treaty Organization and closer U.S. ties to the 12­nation European Community.

least 125 in the Michiana re­gion. The Center holds 125 homeless people. 
The paid staff of the center consists of an acting director. a volunteer coordinator, a shelter coordinator, a kitchen coordi­nator, and a security guard. In addition to the paid staff are over 200 volunteers. many of whom are students, faculty and staff members at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
Coinciding with the executive board's assuming management of the Center is the establish­ment of the position of execu­tive director of the Center, who will be responsible for imple­menting policy. coordinating staff and volunteers. and rep­resentation of the Center to the local community. 
The executive board will soon begin searching for someone to fill the position, and should hire a person by the end of January of next year, according to Warner. 
With the executive board as­suming leadership, the Center "could be a real significant model of how a community can face the problem of homeless­ness," Warner said. 
The board, with representa­tives from some key parts of the Michiana community, should be effective in getting fi­nancial support and getting more services for the Center. said Warner. 
"The plan now is to use this new organization (the executive board) to accelerate plans which existed from the onset," said Link. Although the Center has been running smoothly for the past year, the early opening of the Center "under critical conditions" made it hard to ef­fectively move ahead with initial plans. he said.

there is a shortage of 700

region. 

Also essential to the Center is 
financial support. The executive 
board will look for support 
from local businesses and indi­

The executive board will also look for national support, ac­cording to Link. The board will apply for governmental and foundational grants to help support the Center. 
Both Link and Warner are confident that the executive board will be effective in run­ning the Center. 
"We have two unique faetors in our favor," Warner said. "One is our four-way partner­ship in the endeavor to meet the homeless problem. and the other is the full-service ap­proach we are committed to developing."

Two Mexican drug lords get 40 years for murder of U.S. agent 
MEXICO CITY (AP) -Two Mexican drug lords were sen­tenced Tuesday to 40 years in prison each for the murder of 
U.S. narcotics agent Enrique Camarena, ending a case that had dampened relations be­tween the countries since 1985. 
"There is no chance of these sentences being reduced," At­torney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said. 
Rafael Caro Quintero, 37, and Ernesto Rafael Fonesca Car­rillo, 56, were found guilty of masterminding the killings of Camarena, an agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administra­tion, and his Mc";._,dn pilot, Al­varez said. 
They were tried earlier this year, but convictions and sen­tences are announced simulta­neously in Mexico. 
Time for related convictions of kidnapping, drug trafficking and weapons smuggling ·brought Caro Quintero's total sentence to 116 years and Fon­seca's to 144. The sentences are to be served concurrently. 
Fernando Arias, a spokesman for Alvarez, said Caro Quintero and Fonseca would have to serve 74 and 53 years respec­tively because of non-concur­rent time remaining from pre­vious sentences. 
He said there is no parole in drug-related cases, "not even by a single day." 
Don Hamilton, spokesman for U.S. drug control policy di­rector William Bennett, said in Washington: "It's certainly nice to see people like Caro Quintero off the streets. I think the United States and Mexico will both be the better for it." 
Ten other men were sentenced to the maximum term of 40 years for taking part in the killings, and 13 other men re­c.eived lesser sentences for their involvement in drug operations run by Caro Quintero and Fon­seca. 
All property and possessions of the two arc being confiscated as part of the penalty, Alvarez said. He had no figures for their holdings, but said the "list is very long." 
Both are known to have mil­lions of dollars in assets, in­cluding ranches, aircraft, lux­ury cars, houses, apartments, hotels and businesses. 
Tuesday's sentences were handed down by Judge Tomas Hernandez Franco of the 4th Criminal Court in Guadalajara, where Camarena was based. It is the capital of Jalisco state, 350 miles west of Mexico City, and a major center for the drug traffickers. 
E. Germany Communist Party admits to 'flawed socialism' 
EAST BERLIN (AP) -Pres­sun~d by a steady drain of disil­lusioned workers and increas­ing calls for reunification, East Germany's Communist Party conceded Tuesday that a flawed brand of socialism had hurt living standards. 
In the past month. the Com­munists have given up their le­gal monopoly on power and that has raised questions about their mandate to govern until national parliamentary elec­tions are held May 6. 
Secretary of State James Baker met in Potsdam -with Communist Premier Hans Mod-row in a show of support for the nation's reforms. 
One pro-reform group, Demokratischer Aufbruch, said Modrow and his Cabinet should step down. It does not appear that position enjoys broad sup­port, however, since Modrow retains a fairly high standing among East Germans. 
Communist Party leader Gre~ gor Gysi said his party would not allow a "foreign policy vac­uum" to develop despite the upheavals of the past two months. 
"What we need in this country through May 6 is stability," Gysi said when informed of the reform group's demand. 
West German Foreign Minis­ter Hans-Dietrich Genscher traveled to East Berlin to meet with the group's leader Rainer Eppelmann. No details of the talks were disclosed. 
The party's official daily, Neues Deutschland, blamed so­cialism for poor living condi­tions in the most blunt admis­sion yet of the party's culpabil­ity in the nation's political and economic crisis. 
"The governmental and ad­ministrative socialism has def­initely failed as a social system 
in our country," the newspaper said. 
But, it added, a new "democratic socialism" was in the making. 
The party appeared torn over the question of closer ties with West Germany, and the news­paper called for "a qualified partnership" acceptable to Eu­ropean neighbors. 
Allies of East Germany and West Germany have expressed reservations about a confeder­ation between the nations or eventual reunification, as pro­posed by West German Chancel­lor Helmut Kohl. 
But the economic crisis that has burdened East Germany's more than 16 million citizens with problems from pollution to scarce consumer goods con­tinues to drive away the na­tion's best hope for an im­proved future -its young workers. 
Baker visited the wall Tues­day and then traveled from West Berlin to Potsdam to meet with Modrow. It was the first time a U.S. secretary of state visited East Germany since diplomatic relations were established in 1974.

West overlooks rights violations 
Surprising as it may seem to most of us, the Chinese, the Eastern Bloc and Vietnam do not have a monopoly on human rights violations. Great Britain. the United States' dosest ally, seems not-so-very concerned about human rights these days as well. On Tuesday morning, December 12, the government of the British colony of Hong Kong began a forced deporta­tion of Vietnamese refugees to II anoi. The colonial govern­ment. with full approval from the British government, plans on dnporting 44,000 Viet­nanwse rnfugees over the eoursn of the nnxt few months, simply because thn government donsn't want to deal with them. Tlw defense of the Hong Kong government: the fleeing Viet­namese are boat people and therefore not "true" refugees. If that confuses you, you're not alone. 
'It never ceases to amaze me how governments can write off the persecution and murder of thousands of people without any real concern. Maybe Stalin was right; maybe the death of a million men is just a statistic.' 
Starting in June of 1988, 57,000 Vietnamese citizens fled their oppressed homeland in search of life elsewhere; these refugees initially sought shelter in !long Kong, the closest safe refuge (or so they thought). In response, the colonial govern­ment has decided that refuge is to be sought elsewhere; to that end, the government screens all the refugees, classifying 13,000 as "true" refugees and the rest as illegal aliens and migrant workers. The screening proce­dures used were so flawed that Amnesty International called on 
DOONESBURY 
Jim DeMarco 
On Human Rights 
the government of Great Bri­tain to stop thinking about de­portation of the refugees until a non-biased proeess could be applied. 
The refugees do not want to return. Two questions are raised by this action of the colonial government: Do we have any assurance that the llanoi government will not per­secute the refugees upon their return (assuming their forcible return is justified)? And how can the I long Kong government justify forcible deportation of people fleeing such a repressive regime, people who do not want to go back? 
To answer the first question, one need only to read Tuesday's New York Times. We know al­ready that the Vietnamese gov­ernment is not exactly known for the humane treatment of its citizens, especially those who find it necessary to flee to an­other country to escape op­pression. In the Times article, Barbara Basler quotes Christo­pher Bale, Hong Kong director of OXFAM, concerning assur­ances of safety for the deported refugees: '"At the moment,' Mr. Bale said, 'the bottom line with the Government appears to be to get an agreement where boat people can get out of the plane (in Hanoi) without being shot."' 
One wonders if the Hong Kong government even cares what happens to the 44,000 it plans to return to Hanoi. It never ceases to amaze me how governments can write off the persecution and murder of thousands of people without any real concern. Maybe Stalin was right; maybe the death of a million men is just a statistic. 
But why send people to cer­tain repression if you can af­ford not to? Well, says the colonial government of Hong Kong and the British govern­ment, they're migrant farm­workers and fishermen. What those who defend the deporta­tions seem to overlook is that the ranks of the refugees are also heavily made up of chil­dren. In fact, of the 51 refugees forcibly deported Tuesday, 26 were children. Those who de­fend the deportation also seem to think that oppression only works against those who are rich. "The rich are truly op­pressed in Vietnam, so we'll al­low them to stay in Hong Kong. But the poor aren't really op­pressed, especially farmers and 
fishermen, so we'll send them back to the worker's paradise." 
As a note of the brashness of the Hong Kong government's act, the soldiers who carried the 51 refugees away on Tues­day attempted to do so in se­cret. Reporters found them anyway, and when the refugees saw the reporters following their bus, they shouted and held up cardboard signs saying that they didn't want to go back, that they would rather die than return to Vietnam. But all this is justifiable to the Hong Kong government because these refugees are poor migrant workers (and children). 
But you need only to trans­pose the names of the Hong Kong and British governments with that of the United States and that of the Vietnamese regime with your choice of Latin American governments to see that it is not just the British who don't know how to deal humanely with refugees.

Room assignments not random 
Dear Editor: 
As students who, upon arrival at Notre Dame in 1986, discov­ered that the members of our residence hall were to be roomed together according to their racial background, we have to laugh at the defensive efforts put forth by Evelyn Heinebold of the Office of Stu­dent Housing in the latest issue of Scholastic. To read that, "We do the freshman room as­signments by random computer selection ... all we have is the student's name and social secu­rity number,'' one would believe that the administration on this campus is not aware of the segregationist tactics that are not commonplace in at least one of our "family's" residence halls. 
We refuse to believe that the housing assignments that were issued for Dillon Hall in 1986 (and the three subsequent years) can be attributed to a system guided by "chance". We would have to be more than naive to believe that any ho6s­ing assignment which placed all the black freshman in our dorm together would be a system based on random computer se­lection. Dillon Hall's current freshman class consists of six black students. Two of these students live together in a dou­ble; three live in a triple on the same floor, while only one is assigned to live with a non-mi­nority student. The situation in Dillon Hall has bnen similar during our four years at Notre Dame. In light of these facts, Ms. Heinebold's statements on this issue snem to be a misrep­resentation of what occurs in our dorms. 
Our criticism. however, is not directed solely toward Dillon's system. We have been made aware of other situations in our University's residenee halls in which members of minority groups have been placed to­gether in rooms or even in snp­arate sections. 
We do not believe that per­sons who see fit to place blacks and other minority students in special rooming situations are racist. Bather, we choose to believe that they are unin­formed and ignorant in their assessment of how these segre­gationist tactics will affect race 
relations at Notre Dame. 
We believe this to be true, and, accordingly, we would ask that those in the administration in charge of student housing look into this situation immediately and make the changes that are obviously necessary. If the University is truly concerned with race rela­tions at Notre Dame, it will provide the efforts necessary in making sure that segregation is not practiced here.

TORONTO (AP) -Seven Soviet boxers announced Tuesday they will train in Toronto for their first pro­fessional lights. 
''I'm sure we will succeed not only in the boxing ring, but in the business side as well," said manager Boris Gitman, a Soviet immigrant living in Toronto. "There is enough talent in the Soviet Union to go all the way to the top." 
The seven. all Soviet cham­pions in their weight classes, were introduced at a news conference by Gitman, New York promoter Lou Falcigno and Evgenie lstomin, a 

spokesman for the Ministry of Sport in the Soviet Union. Falcigno signed a deal with Soviets some time ago. 
"Perestroika and glasnost have opened up the Soviet Union so it's now possible to get Soviet boxers," Falcigno said. "One light between a Soviet heavyweight, of course with the right buildup,· and a Mike Tyson could easily be a quarter of a billion dollars." 
Though no dates, site or opponents have been lined up, Falcigno foresees the Soviets making their pro de­but in March. The boxers will train in Toronto.

Celtics still slumping despite return of Bird 
BOSTON (AP) -In story­books, the long-lost hero simply shows up and makes everything right. In the fantasies of Boston Celtics fans, that hero is Larry Bird. 
In the competitive world of the NBA. nothing is that simple. 
"I don't think Larry just walking into the gym is going to immediately make us a team that can't be beaten," Coach Jimmy Rodgers said. 
The evidence to support that contention keeps mounting. A quarter of the way into their season, the Celtics are a team in trouble. 
They are 11-9, just two games better than their record aftPr 20 games last year when Bird played only the first six games. Their 32-point loss to New York last Saturday night was their biggest deficit in nine seasons. They are last in the league at forcing turnovers, a statistic that verifies their lack of quickness and aggressive­ness. 
John Bagley, their only reli­able point guard now that Brian Shaw is playing in Italy, is out with a dislocated shoul­der. Their best shooting guard, Reggie Lewis, has a strained hamstring. 
And Hodgers seems to be playing roulette in using his guards in ever-changing com­binations that confuse players as well as partisans. 
The spotlight, as always, has been on Bird. 
On Nov. 19, 1988, he had bone spurs removed from both heels and missed the rest of last season. The Celtics, the winningest franchise in NBA history, didn't clinch a playoff spot until the final day of the regular season and lost to Detroit, 3-0, in the first playoff round. 
But they had an excuse. They played almost the entire season without one of the best players in NBA history. 
This season, that excuse doesn't work. A broken bone in Bird's back was.far less serious than first thought when it oc­curred during the team's sum­mer camp on July 29. He was practicing two days later. 
Perhaps expectations were too high. Boston went 7-1 in preseason games and won its first two regular-season games, the second at Chicago on Bird's basket with three seconds left. 
But only four players remain from Boston's last title team in 1986. It has taken time for Bird and the other veterans to mesh with six teammates who weren't on the team when last season began. 
"When you run people in and out a lot, there are different rotations and a different style," Bird said. "Everybody here tries to play together, so it's no big problem." 
Bird leads Boston with a 22.6-point scoring average, his lowest since 1980-81, excluding last season. He is second on the team with 9.8 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game. 
"It's a team sport," Rodgers said. "We're not depending on Larry Bird to be the only person out there to win basketball games for us." 
After hearing Bird say time after time that he feels fine,_ re-porters have stopped asking. Now they want to know why his shooting is so sickly. 

"I had some good opportuni­ties to score," he said after a 113-98 victory over the Knicks last Wednesday night, during which he missed 16 of 25 shots. "I just didn't hit them." 
He hasn't hit 50 percent of his shots in any of his last five games. He has missed 17 shots in two games, 16 in two others and 15 in another two. His ~5.3

field goal percentage is the lowest in his 11 NBA seasons. Did the long layoff hurt? 
"I don't have an answer for that," Rodgers said. "I just know that great shooters like that normally find ways to im­prove." 
For better or worse, at least Bird is shooting. He had felt constrained by Rodgers' em­phasis on moving the ball and spreading out the scoring. 
Redmen roll past Rams 
NEW YORK (AP) -Boo Harvey scored 20 points and No. 18 St. John's beat Fordham 68-60 Tuesday night, the Redmen's 21st consecutive vic­tory over the Rams. 
The last time Fordham (4-3) beat St. John's (7-2) was Feb. 13,1971. St. John's coach Lou Carnesecca has not lost to the Rams in 24 games. 
Fordham appeared to have a chance to end that streak when a bank shot by Andre McClendon tied the game 48-48 with 12:29 to play. 
But St. John's Billy Singleton scored the next four points for the Redmen and set up the next basket as the Redmen went on a 7-0 run. Fordham never got closer than five points the rest of the game.

CHICAGO (AP) -Brian Hill's 3-point basket snapped a 52-52 tie and unheralded Illinois­Chicago went on to upset 25th­ranked Michigan State 65-57 Tuesday night. 
It was the Spartan's first loss in seven games this season. S. Illinois 77, Evansville 73 
CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) ­Freddie McSwain made four free-throws in the final 1:15 to break a 73-73 deadlock and help pull Southern Illinois past Evansville 77-73 Tuesday. 
In the first half, the Salukis led 30-26 with 5:18 left when they capitalized on three technical fouls assessed to the Aces in less than a minute and increased their lead to 37-26 at the 4:27 mark. 
Junior guard Sterling Mahan scored 15 of his team-high 20 points in the first half. 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) ­Indiana University basketball coach Bob Knight made an on­air threat to stop doing his ra­dio show because it contained a beer commercial. 
Knight became upset during Monday night's broadcast of "The Bob Knight Show" on WXTZ-AM. He has been an out­spoken critic of drug abuse and in February agreed to help Gov. Evan Bayh wage a statewide campaign against drugs. 
On Tuesday, a station spokokesman said Knight 
would return to the airwaves next week. 
"He has a problem doing al­cohol-type commericials on his show, and we can respect that," said Randy Harris, oper­ations manager for WXTZ and WMJC-FM. "So the advertising agency has agreed not to put those type of commercials on the radio show." 
The beer commercials will, however, continue to air during the station's coverage of IU basketball games.

Cold shooting is not even the

the ball bl'fore putting it up,

Irish forward Keith

turnovers against Marqtwtte, 
says the problem is a lack of 
tenacity. 

"We've got to execute better and play with more aggres­sion." said the 6-9 senior. "Once the game starts, we should play aggressively, rather than trying to eo me back." 
1\lmer Bennett. who started with I>aimon Sweet in place of Fredrick and Jackson against Marquette, blames the turnovers on a lack of focus. 
"It all comes down to mental concentration," said the 6-1 guard. "We just haV!~n't had our heads into it the past two games. We keep having to fight from behind. We've got to come out and jump on people." 
If turnovers and poor shoot­ing are th1~ problems, it is tough to dismiss this losing streak by saying that things will get better with the return of l.aPhonso Ellis. A post player, Ellis cannot directly make the shooters get hot or help the backcourt maintain possession of the ball. 
Nonetheless, Ellis' return ddinitely will improve this team. The problem is that the schedule gets better also. With three losses already. you have to figure the Irish can only stumble seven more times to earn an NCM berth. Otherwise,

NCAA nails Wolfpack for multiple violations 
HAI.EIGII, N.C. (AP) -North Carolina State's basketball team was placed on two yt~ars' probation Tuesday and barred from the 1990 NCAA tourna­ment for violations that in­cluded tlw misuse of compli­mentary tickets and snnakNs. 
The NCAA said it did not im­
pose harsher penalties, indud­
ing a ban from tnlevision, 
because the school "undertook 
corrective and punitive aetions 
prior to the hearing." 
Interim chancellor Larry Monteith said there wnre no plans to fire anyone, including Coach Jim Valvano. 
Valvano said being barred from the NCAA tournament was "as serious a hurt and blow as I have had personally in my life." 
"We accept the NCAA find­ings and its punishment," he said. 
The Atlantic Coast Conference could have barred N.C. Statn from the league tournament, which gives the winm1r an au­tomatic NCM tournarm~nt bid. 
"They have the right to take that action," Monteith said. "If they take that action. we won't resist." 
But ACC commissioner Gene Corrigan on Tuesday said the Wolfpaek would be allowed to participate in the eonferenee tournament. 
"We had a meeting today," Corrigan told Haleigh radio station WHAL-FM. "It was a scheduled meeting and there was no thought that any of the business on N.C. State would bn coming down today. But I larold llopfnnberg, the acting athletic director, carne to the meeting and requested that the confer­

enee give them a decision today 
on th11 ACC tournament." 
Valvano said it would have 
been inappropriate to ban his 
team from the ACC tournanwnt. 
"I don't think that our partic­
ipation would adversPly affect 
anyorw." hn said, noting that as 
many as six ACC teams usually 
qualify for the tournanwnt on 
records alone. 
"I think our eonfnrence has 
that rnlative stnmgth that prior 
to the tournament you know 
who is in," he said. 
N.C. State narrwd $707,000 from last year's NCAA tourna­ment. 
The NCAA invnstigation, sparked by allegations of wrongdoing in the book "Personal Fouls," said that in the four ynars examined "there were as many as 650 erroneous designations" of ticknts in­tnnded for players' families and that "an excessive number of shoes wern issund with little or no eff~~rt to keep track of the shoes. 
Tickets wnre sold or fJX­changnd for mnrchandise worth up to $150 each, the NCAA said. Shoes, valued at $75 per pair, were traded for shoes and apparel of equal value at a local sporting goods storn, thn report said. 
"Personal Fouls," written by Petnr Golenbock, claimPd grades had bnen changed and positive drug tests kept serret to keep players eligible. In a telephone intervif'w from Pompano Beach, Fla., he said he was surprised the NCAA fo­cused on playnrs instead of "the tandem of Valvano and former Chancellor Bruce Poulton."

Yankees acquire Leary for two minor-leaguers 
NEW YORK (AP) -The New York Yankees said they needed to add another starting pitcher and they did Tuesday, acquiring Tim Leary from the Cincinnati Reds for two minor leaguers. 
The Yankees, whose 4.50 earned-run average was the second-worst in baseball last season behind Detroit, sent outfielder Hal Morris and right-hander Rodney Imes to the Reds for Leary and minor­league outfielder Van Snider. 
Leary, 8-14 in 1989 with a 
3.52 ERA, joins Andy Hawkins and Pascual Perez as definite starters. Leary said he wasn't apprehensive about coming to the Yankees, whose constant turmoil was one of the reasons Mark Langston and Mark Davis turned down George 
Steinbrenner's  millions  and  
signed elsewhere.  
"There's  always  that  un­ 

known factor," Leary said from his home in Los Angeles. "You 
read and hear about the con­troversy going on. That's something I'll get to see first hand. I'm just looking forward to pitching. The other stuff doesn't really bother me." 
Leary, a 31-year-old right­hander who is joining his fifth team, is 45-56 lifetime. He was 17-11 with a 2.91 ERA in 1988 but was just 6-7 last July 18 when the Dodgers traded him to Cincinnati with Mariano Duncan for Kal Daniels and Lenny Harris. Leary went 2-7 in 14 starts for the Reds with a 
3.71 ERA. 
"It gets real defeating when you come out of a game losing 2-1 and the chances are 90 per­cent you're going to get a loss," Leary said. 
He lost 13 games as a starter last year and the Reds and Dodgers scored just 17 runs in those losses. 
"LA gets tired after a while," Leary said.

Williams, Wood shining for Irish 
Duo has qualified for NCAA Swimming Tournament 

By MARY GARINO 
Sports Writer 
Until this year, no Notre Dame swimmer had ever quali-· 
fied for the NCAA Division I championships. 
Now,  suddenly,  two  have  
qualified.  
Junior  Becky  Wood  and  

freshman Tanya Williams both swam well enough this fall to earn lane assignments at the NCAAs, marking an achieve­ment for them and for the Notre Dame swimming pro­gram. 
Wood qualified last weekend in the 200-yard breaststroke at the dual meet between Notre Dame and Saint Mary's with a time of 2:19. 
The news is twice as good for Williams, who has been the most consistent swimmer for the Irish women's swim team this year. She qualified not only for one event, but for another as well. 
Her time in the 200-yard but­terfly (2:01) at the National Catholic Meet earlier this month was good enough for an NCAA berth. and she followed up that performance with an­other qualifying time in the meet against Saint Mary's last weekend. In that race, Williams swam a 4:22 in the 400-yard individual medley. 
But Williams' performance should come as no surprise. The Boca Raton, Fla., native was a finalist in the 1988 Olympic trials with a fifth-place finish in the 200-yard individual medley and came to Notre Dame as one of the most re­cruited high school seniors in the nation. 
Becky Wood 
"There are two things that are exciting about Tanya," Irish head caoch Tim Welsh said. " It's exciting to know that a swimmer of her caliber would choose Notre Dame, and it's exciting to know that she will continue to swim at the most elite level possible." 
Wood's swimming success story is from a totally diff~rent script than Williams'. Wood had never even swam a 200­yard breaststroke race before she got to college, and has trained hard for three years to get to the NCAAs. 
"I set the goal to make it when I was a freshman," Wood said. "I trained really hard in the summers, and I guess this fall it all came together. The team has been really support­ive." 
Wood's performance came a week after Williams qualified for the first time, giving her the motivation to push herself. 
"Knowing that she could do it made me believe in myself," Wood said. "The funny thing is, both of us swam really terrible in practice the week before the meet." 
Tanya Williams 
Both Williams and Wood have . given a bit of support to the 
Notre Dame swimming pro­
gram, which Welsh is hoping to 
mold into a national contender. 
The fact that two Irish swim­
mers qualified for the NCAAs is 
a step in the right direction. 
"Both qualifying times repre­
sent both ends of the sp~ctrum 
of national achievement," 
Welsh said. "We need people 
like Tanya, who are among the 
elite swimmers, and we need 
people with talent and ambition 
but who have not yet achieved 
national standards. It's now 
clear to everyone on the team 
that the door to the national 
championships is open." 
Using last year's results as a 
yardstick, the times for both 
swimmers would put them in 
the top ten in the country at the 
NCAAs, which will take place 
over St. Patrick's Day weekend. 
"Because the qwilifying stan­
dards are so tough, it's both 
unusual and exciting for a 
swimmer to qualify this early," 
Welsh said. 

Wood and Williams already 
hold university records, and 
they are hoping to add good 
performances at the NCAAs. 
Rutgers fires football coach after poor year 
PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) ­Rutgers University fired foot­ball coach Dick Anderson on Tuesday, citing the Scarlet Knights' poor record the last two seasons. 
Athletic director Frederick E. Gruninger said the decision was based on the team's field record alone. and praised Anderson's performance in strengthening the program since coming to the school in 1984. 
"However, as we project our program for the 90s, we needed to reverse a downward trend of the last two years which does not reflect our desired level of competitiveness and expecta­tions," Gruninger said. 
Anderson's record over six seasons was 27-34-4. The Scarlet Knights went 5-6 in 1988. They won two and tied two at this season's outset, then lost the next seven games. 
The university also fired all nine of Anderson's assistant coaches. 
Gruninger said a search for a replacement would begin im­mediately, and that the con­tracts of Anderson and his staff would be honored through the end of the academic year. 
Gruninger refused to provide details of the contracts, excect to say they were multi-year and that the university had the right to dismiss the coaches. 
The athletic director said he recommended firing Anderson, and the decision -made Tuesday afternoon -was ap­proved by "key" board mem­bers and the university's acting president, T. Alexander Pond. Anderson was informed shortly thereafter. 
Pond took over after the death Thursday of university president Edward Bloustein. 
"As you all can imagine, we are a community in mourning," Gruninger told reporters in a conference call Tuesday evening. "Once a decision was 
made, we felt it was important 
to get on with it very quickly." 
Reached at home, Anderson's wife said he was not taking any calls. 
"I feel that my staff and I have made a significant contri­bution to the improvement of Rutgers football," he said. 
When asked for Anderson's reaction to the news, Gruninger said: "Dick is just a tremendous guy. It's not an easy situation for Dick Anderson." 
Before coming to Rutgers, Anderson was an assistant coach at Penn State for 11 years, three of them as offen­sive coordinator. He also had assistant positions at Pennsylvania and Lafayette. 
He posted a 7-3 record his first season at Rutgers. 
Anderson played Penn State between 1961 and 1963 and participated in two Gator Bowls. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns but played weekend football for the semi­pro Newark Bears while pursu­ing a graduate degree at Penn State.

Redskins now on roll after loss to Cowboys 
IIEHNDON. Va. (AJ>) There's really no logical expla­nation for the rcsurgnnel) of the Washington Hedskins, who are 4-1 since a horrid loss to the lowly Dallas Cowboys last month. 
Who could have guessed that the Hedskins, racked by injuries and reeling with a 4-5 record after scoring only a field goal against the previously winless Cowboys, would rebound to stay alive in the playoff chase through mid-December? 
Not Coach Joe Gibbs. 
"By all rights, this shouldn't have happened," Gibbs said. "To lose that many players, and now to be playing better football than we were before. that shouldn't be the ease." 
Gibbs said he had no reason to expect the turnaround, con­sidering that Gerald Higgs, Mark May, Joe Jacoby and Darrell Green were among the starters out with injuries and Dexter Manley and Barry Wilburn were lost to the team 
because  of  drug  problems.  
Worse,  the  Hedskins  simply  
didn't  have  the  stability  re­ 

quired to be a winner. 
"In the first part of the sea­son we were awful," Gibbs said. "We made some great plays, yet we turn the ball over a bunch. It didn't seem like there was any steadiness in there, and there wasn't. 
"There were great inconsis­teneies, and I kopt waiting for (the team) to grab a formula, a chemistry." (;ibbs said. "I think we've got it now, amazingly enough, with a new bunch of guys." 

Hookie Mark Schlereth, the first native Alaskan to play in the NFL, has been a credible replacement for May, just as Ed Simmons filled in for Jacoby, and Earnest Hyner has made Higgs. now healthy, a second­stringer. 
The defense has been even more astonishing, considering that six starters in Sunday's 26-21 vietory over San Diego were on the bench or inactive for the season opener. Washington has surrend1~rcd only seven, second-half points in the last live games. 
A..J. Johnson and Martin Mayhew have replaced Green and Wilburn, Fred Stokes has moved in for Manley, and thn Hedskin defense is now ranked a respectable ninth in the NFL. 
"Our defense has jumped al­most 10 places in the league rankings," Gibbs marveled. "That really shouldn't have happened." 
The Hedskins' recent surge is reminiscent of their effort in last ynar's finale against Cincinnati, when Washington used the running of Jamie Morris to carry the eventual AFC Champions into owrtime before losing. 
Eagles ban sales of alcohol after incident with Cowboys 
PIIILADELPIIIA (AP) -Beer will not be sold at concession stands during Philadelphia Eagles games the rest of the season, a vending company ex­ecutive said Tuesday after join­ing the team and city in con­demning rowdy fans. 
"It was something that needed to be done," said Bruen Brown, general manager for Ogden-Allied Services Corp. 
The vendor is in the fourth year of a 15-year contract to sell beer at city-owned Veterans Stadium. 
Tho Eagles also announced a total ban on alcoholic bever­ages at tailgate parties sur­rounding the stadium. Until now, beer had been sold in the stadium for the first half of 

football games and drinking 
had  been  tolerated  at  one  
parking lot  south of  the  sta­ 
dium.  

The Eagles and the eity had asked Ogden-Allied to stop beer sales because they believed al­cohol abuse helped to cause snowball and iceball throwing and brawling Sunday at the Dallas game. 
The snowball attacks wors­ened as the game wore on. The Cowboys may have been the primary targets, but snow and icc hit officials, Eagles cheer­leaders and fans sitting in the line of lire. 
As the Cowboys left the field after the 20-10 loss, fans poured snow, ice and beer on them.

Spartans last ND test before nine-day break 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Associate Sports Editor 

Bnforn taking a nine-day brnak for smnester exams, thn injury-plagued Notre Dame women's basketball team hosts Michigan State at 7:30 Thursday night in the Joyce ACC. 
The Irish (4-1) alrnady are playing with just a nine-player roster because of kmw injuries that have Armin Schwartz and Dionrw Smith out for the sea­son. Of the "lwalthy" playnrs, guard Kanm Hobinson contin­ues to be botherPd by an ankle injury, Krissi Davis is listed as probabiP for tonight's game after spraining her baek against Marquette last wnekend and Comalita Ilaysbert and Sara I.inbschnr have come up with eases of the flu. 
All four of those players are normally starters. 
Irish coaeh MufTet McGraw also is concerned with the way practices have gone this week, with the players already pres­sured with end-of-semester deadlines and exams. 
"It's been pretty weak," MeGraw said of the recent praetiees. "It's that time of the year, where students are think­ing about finals. We just need to get our intensity for this game tonight, just play the game and then worry about fi­nals." 
Miehigan State should pro­vide enough cause for concern. The Spartans have played bet­ter than their 3-2 record would indicate, as one of the losses eame on a 73-63 decision to Stanford. The Cardinal cur­rently is among the nation's top 10 teams. 

The Spartans also lost 72-69 to Kentucky. Michigan State de­feated Temple 72-66, topped Cincinnati 63-50 and topped Central Michigan 71-60. 
"They're very athletic," said McGraw. "They rebound well and play very good defense. Individually. they are better than we are player-for-player. As a team. I'm not sure." 
Michigan State's top player is guard Eileen Shea. The 5-8 ju­nior is the Spartan's leading scorer with 17.2 points per game and also averages 5 re­bounds and 2.6 assists. 
"She's a good three-point shooter and just a good perimeter player," said MeGraw. 
Guard Marie Williams, a 5-8 sophomore, may be Michigan State's most complete player. She averages 10 points, 6.4 re­bounds and 5.2 assists per game. 
Center Sheronda Mayo (5.8 points, 7.4 rebounds) and for­wards Cherie Swarthout (9.4, 
4.2) and Taraisa Wills (6.8,

Statistics don't tell Guay's story 
Senior leader does the little things to help NO hockey 
By KEN TYSIAC 
Sports Writer 

For almost every goal that is scored in hockey them is some­body who makes a big check or digs the puck out of a crowd on the boards to set up the score. 
On the Notre Dame hockey team. more often than not se­nior winger Bruce Guay is the one who sets things up. Although he only has four goals and five assists on the season, Guay has contributed to the team in many other ways. 
"Scoring is a lot of fun," admits Guay, who hails from North Smithfield. Hhode Island, "but I also like to go into the corners, mix it up, and come out with the puek. 
"This year a lot of good goal scorers, like Sterling Black, Tim Kuehl and Dave Bankoske have come to the front, but I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I do what I can for a score, but I pride myself in baekchecking and keeping the other team from putting points on the board." 
In Guay's sophomore year, he had a chance to score quite a few goals himself. He played on a line centered by Irish great Mike McNeill and scored 23 goals and added 12 assists on a team whieh went went 27-4-2 in Hie Schafer's first season as Notre Dame hockey coach. 
"Playing with Mike McNeill was a great experience. It taught me a lot about the game. It was a really fun year,

as I played on a line with two seniors, we were winning and I was scoring some goals, too." 
But Guay fell prey to a deep thigh contusion late in the sea­son which caused him to miss the last six weeks of the sea­son. Guay says he never appre­ciated hockey so much as when he was hurt and unable to con­tribute to the team. After listening to Schafer talk about Guay, it's not hard to understand how much it would hurt him to be forced out of the lineup. 
"The word intense would de­scirbe Bruce Guay most accu­rately," Schafer said. "He really wants to do well in everything that he does. He will be a con­tributing member to this hockey team with or without scoring a lot of goals." 
Guay agrees with Schafer's assessment of him as an intense person. His intensity might have worked to a fault last season, when the team suffered through a losing season and Guay only scored 28 points in 34 games. 
"I've been brought up with a work ethic where I attack ev­erything with the utmost inten­sity. Last year was frustrating to me because I wanted to score more goals, but it just wasn't there. A losing season is difficult in any sport." 
Fortunately this past season hasn't been difficult for Guay or the Irish. Despite losing two games last weekend to Ferris State, Notre Dame has glided to an early 10-4 record in the first part of its season, and Guay has blossomed as a senior leader on the team. 
"The best way to lead is by example," says Guay. "If that means scoring goals, great, but if that means killing a penalty or making a check, I'm glad to do that too. I take pride in the defensive aspect of my game." 
Guay has managed to put the puck in the net a few times as well for the Irish this season. Against Ferris State he man­aged to tally one goal in each game, and even though Notre Dame was swept, Guay was pleased with his own play. 
''I've been saying it's going to come in buches when it comes. It really reassured my confi­dence in my ability to score. I know that if I get the opportu­nity and I'm in the right posi­tion I can put it away."

1984-85 season and 57-55 during the 1987-88 campaign. 
After taking on the Spartans, the Irish do not play again until Dec. 22, when they will host UCLA 
"The week off after this game will really help us heal. but we've got to win this one first," said McGraw.

Irish seek answers after lethargic start 
After leading Marquette to its first victory over Notre Dame since 1982, Warior forward Trevor Powell said he did not see anything particularly wrong with this Irish squad. 
"They seemed the same to me," said Powell, who exploited the Irish inside game for 25 points. "The improvement lies within us. We're Steve Megargee improved from a couple of years Associate Sports Editor ago." 

Sorry, Trevor. 

Though Marquette certainly has made great strides under new coach Kevin O'Neill, and is better than last year's 10-18 outfit, the Warriors still rank in a dass several notches below Louisville and Indiana. Lowly Loyola (Ill.) took Marquette into overtime last week. 
Four days later, Marquette defeated Notrn Damt~ by a dozen points. Tlw Irish had beaten the Warriors a dozPn times in a row before Saturday's contest. SomPthing defi­nitely is awry with this Irish club, losers of its last three games with 13th-ranked UCLA on the way. 
The Warriors gave the Irish a tough game in thP final week of the '88-'89 season, but the result was different. Notre Dame won that eontest 67-63 to clinch its spot in the NCAA tournament. 
"This game was similar to last year," said Irish guard and eo-captain Joe Fredrick. "Just last year, we pulled it off." 
Jamere Jackson made the gamewinning shot in last sea­son's win at the Bradley Center. On his return visit, the co­captain shot just 1-of-8 from the field. For the season. Jackson has eonnected on just 9-of-30 attempts, an ieP­cold 30 percent. 
Jackson, a 47 percent career shooter while at Notre Dame, averaged 13.5 points per game last season. Fredrick and Jackson's shooting are the keys to Notre Dame's perimeter game. 
"When Fred and I got going last season, it got the other guys juiced up," said Jackson. "I'm just not playing well
