Riehle explains security problems 
by Kevin McGill 
Ff. James Riehle, Dean of Students, addressed a meeting of the Faculty Senate last night in the Continuing Education Center, informing the members of, and calling for their help in, the serious problem of campus security. Sighting the violent events of this last weekend. he pointed out the weaknesses in the present security system and announced suggested solutions, including the locking at night of all dorms and the use of t1oodlights on the Main Quad. 
On Friday night, two Notre Dame students and two Army cadets were assaulted on campus. They were not robbed, but merely beaten. On Monday night,Ed Grimmer was knifed in front of Alumni Hall while attempting to pursue a youth who was part of a group that had robbed his hall. Fr. Riehle said that an off-campus student had been stabbed through the chest on Saturday night and is now in the hospital suffering from internal bleeding. 
"These are not just joy riding teenagers we have to deal with," Fr. Riehle said, "They are criminals. They have criminal records. One of the youths under su;pect is escaped from 
prison  and  has  been  arrested  
twenty-two  times for  automo­ 
bile theft."  

While Fr. Riehle feels that the Security Department ·is greatly improved in the four years that Arthur Pears has been its Director, he sees. it as still far from perfect. There is a great shortage of manpower. Only five men presently work the mid­night shift.

definite ideas about the efficacy of the exclusive black theatre." O'Connor went on to note that these ideas seem to differ from those of both Clause Browne and LeRoi Jones, two black writers who have attended the Festival in past years. 
Though not a playwright, the other personage who will defi­nitely attend is nonetheless a leading force in world-wide ex­perimental drama. She is a middle-aged black woman named Ellen Stewart. By found­ing the La Mama Theatre Group she became one of the initiators of the important off-off Broad­way movement. 
This theatre group will set up a theatrical workshop during Festival week, and O'Connor mentioned that "La Mama" will work with the ND-SMC Theatre as well as with the SLF. 
Besides announcing those who have confirmed their intention to attend the Festival, O'Connor emphasized that other writers will be present. 
There is Terrence MeNally, for example, whose tentative acceptance was received by the SLF this week. This gentleman first came to attention in I 965 with a full-length play on Broad­way called "And Things that Go Bump in the Night." More

"We should have a great opportunity for small seminar sessions be­cause many of our speakers will remain on campus for a good part of the week," O'Connor said. 
Dave Manfredi, associate chairman for the Festival this year, added, "We will also seek expanded St. Mary's participa­tion, and there is the possibility that an event might be scheduled there." 
Manfredi also mentioned that the financial preparation for the Festival will also be slightly different from past Festivals." "Patron cards have not been sold for the simple reason that our efforts to make money by

N D losing top Frosh applicants 
by Bob Higgins Dr. Peter Grande, Director of Admissions at Notre Dame said Wednesday in an interview that his latest statistics of SAT scores reveal that although 1970's freshman are more intellegent that last year's, Notre Dame is losing its best applicants to other schools. Statistics show that the mean score for applicants accepted but not confirmed is significantly higher than the mean for those accepted and now attending the university. Grande attributed this to a combination of two causes. 
First, Grande said that there are many excellent students applying to Notre Dame who are in extreme financial need and 
consequently expect to receive 
aid. If the aid is not received the 
students will turn to other 
schools who have more revenue 
with which to work. 
Secondly, he believes that many applicants chose Notre Dame as a second or third alternative, and upon acceptance at their desired school, lose interest in Notre Dame. 
Dr. Grande stated that more high school students are applying to Notre Dame than ever before. He sees this as a direct result of the increased staff of the admission office, which allows for more visiting of 
high schools across the nation. He said he feels that with the help of Alumni Clubs in the major cities, Notre Dame applicant pool could be increased to an even greater degree. Grande emphasized that increased application did not mean increasing enrollment. Rather, he said. it would increase 
the quality of the students 
accepted. 
On the same subject Grande later said that the admissions office plans to admit fewer freshmen next year and concentrate on increasing the admission of qualified transfer students. 
In speaking of the minority program, Dr. Grande reported that the year's program is working well, using the funds received from the Cotton Bowl, 1970, divided over a four year period. This insures that students with scholarships will be able to retain them until they graduate. _

Jane Fonda to spea" here 

by Greg Rowinski Actress Jane Fonda will come to Notre Dame in early November to talk on the possible alternatives to the present ills in our society. "I think that there is no weapon so powerful as the perception of the alternative," Miss Fonda has said in describing the purpose of her speaking tour. The Student Union Academic Commission is sponsoring her appearance November 8, at Stepan Center, beginning at 8 pm. 
Co-commissioner Jim Metzger feels that Miss Fonda is a uniquely legitimate speaker on this topic. He ranks her as the most active woman in social action today. Though considered a "jet setter", she has qualified herself in this serious endeavor by her firsthand contact with many of this country's minority groups. 
Her active involvement has been in two directions. First she went out to discover America in an automobile tour of this country. She sought to "meet the silent majority I had heard so much about.'' She also saw

A Sadie Hawkins dance, Ma­jors Nights, and interhall foot­ball games are all up-coming campus events being planned by Saint Mary's Student ~ervices Organization (SSO), according to Diane Shahade, SSO director. 
The Sadie Hawkins Dance, organized by the social commis­sion, a branch of the SSO, will be held on Saturday, October 23 at the Mishawaka Conserva­
"tion Club. "To complete the weekend's activities, plans are being made for Sunday open house al).d interhall football games," Diane explained. Mary Ann Weisy and Terrv Trenor of SMC are co-.chairmen of the weekend. 
Two "Majors Night" pro­grams, where Saint Mary's stu­dents can meet and confer with department heads and faculty in their planned major fields are being scheduled by another branch of the SSO, the academic commission headed by Missy Underman. The Majors Nights will be held on Tuesday, Octo-

her 27, and Thursday, October 29, according to Diane. 
The SSO, which is completely run by SMC students, coordi­nates the social, academic, com­munity services, student de­velopment, and public relations commissions in planning Saint Mary's main extra-curricular ac­tivites and services. 
Several projects, some fairly successful according to Diane, have been undertaken by the organization. So far, the SSO has held a -used book sale, arranged for Stapleton Masses every night. and provided for the sale of the Sunday editions of the Chicago 
Tribune  in  the  dorms  fron1  
1 I :00  a.m.  to  1:30 p.m.  each  
Sunday.  

In addition, Diane termed Senator George McGovern's ap­pearance and the response it drew from the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's student body a succ.ess. 
"The SSO is working to bring activities like this to Saint Mary's. I felt that McGovern's appearance proved that we could hold important events such as these at St. Mary's more often," said Miss Shahade. 
The SSO has several long range innovations in the plan­ning stages such as the establish­ment of a central meeting place 
for  Notre  Dame  and  Saint  
Mary's studen ts.  
"I  would  like to see  more  

students become aware of the SSO,'' Diane stressed, "and if there is, any service a student would like, I would be more than happy to hear about it." 
The SSO office, which is located in the basement of Holy Cross Hall, is open every Mon­day and Wednesday afternoon from one to three.

She has been arrested four times by military authorities and has a suit pending against Secretary of Defense Mecyin Laird. Miss FonMa met with Black Panther Party leaders and members and visited the Party's free breakfast for children and clinics. She talked with survivors of police raids on Party headquarters. Not satisfied with news reports of atrocities in Vietnam, she talked with soldiers about this situation. Fonda also has been identified with the situation of the American Indian. She visited reservations and Indian-occupied Alcatraz Island. After viewing the problem, she went on to her next step: direct action toward beginning some solutions. 
With lawyer Mark Lane, she founded an office in Washington, D.C., which collects complaints made by G.I. 's who have been illegally disciplined for expressing their First Amendment-bestowed rights. 
Some of these soldiers have been detained from one to five years in stockades. In this action, she has received support from some Senators and Congressmen.

BOMBINGS 
The recent series of bombings across the country -highlighted by the blast which destroyed a floor on a Harvard library-have signaled a new wave of terrorism by the radicals in this country. Terrorist bombs are nothing new to this country, but the present organized sequence of blasts is most disturbing. The New York Times stated recently that "between January 1969 and April of this year 4,330 bombs were exploded in buildings and public places in the United States, . , . and another I, 174 attempted born bings were forestalled ..." For most of these the "urban guerrillas" as the Times called them, have taken credit for these events. 
In New York last Tuesday an assembled group of media people listened to the taped voice of Bernandine Dohrn, a fugitive Weatherman leader. She proclaimed the start of a "fall offensive': all over the country. Thursday three explosions rocked the West Coast, while on Saturday a Queens County Courthouse was blown apart. 
There is a crying need for strong action on the part of public officials to combat this wave of terrorism. Yet additional FBI agents, authority to tape phones and the like, are stop-gap measures more often than not designed to soothe a jittery public's fears. 
Why, for example would a brilliant young lady like Angela Davis feel compelled tobecome a common gun moll to aid escaping criminals? Perhaps it was due, in part or whole, to the action of the California trustees and Ronald Reagan. Liklier still it would have been the attitude many people in this society are adopting that the establishment is basically immoral, therefore they have the right to ram their ideas down our throats by any means at hand. 
This is not the way to effect change in a society. It only heightens paranoia and leads to ugly repressive measures. Last year by Congressman Allard Lowenstein said that people are willing to correct the inequities in America if students take the time and trouble to go and explain to them what we feel is wrong. I

The Soft Parade------­
Women's Lib'' 

Women's liberation burst upon the scene this summer in New 
York. It was highlighted by a party in Southhampton where one 
young lady swam topless in her hosts' pool and a parade down 
5th Ave. on Aug. 26th, the 50th anniversary of women's winning 
the vote. 
The women who acted as organizers and spokesmen for the 
effort were a curious mixture of pushy loudmouths and tall 
sophisticated beauties whom one remembers seeing in 
photographs of radical chic parties. 
The militant females had of course, a long list of demands 
which they insisted be granted immediately, if not sooner. There 
were legitimate grievances; equal job opportunity, educational 
equality and equal wages. Naturally there were those demands 
which entailed someone, presumably the government, to give out. 
Such items as free abortion on demand, universal free day care 
centers, test-tube births and freedom from pain for the fem::le 
body will -except for the last which is most likely beyond the 
capability of the federal bureaucracy --cost quite a bit of money. 
The Women Libbers didrl t make any suggestion as to where the 
money could be gotten. One supposes though that if they really 
want these things they will be forced to acce,1t tax dollars from 
male chauvinists, at least at first. 
The basic tenant of the movement is that women constitute an 
"oppressed majority ' in this country. A superficial examination 
of the facts tends to confirm this statement. Men do hold most of 
the top posts in government and industry and in many instances 
women are paid less than their male counterparts in similar jobs. 
A large percentage of the advertisements which bombard us daily 
contain very beautiful and or very stupid females which extol the 
virtues of particular products. 
A closer examination of the facts however, tends to cast doubt 
on the central truth which guides the movement. 
One of the more astonishing items is that although men 
comprise approximately two-thirds of the nation's labor force, 
therefore excluding housewives, fully 70 percent of the nation st 
private wealth is controlled by women. If housewives were 
included in the total, one could hazard a guess that the 
percentage of female-controlled wealth would be higher. 
The implications of this fact are enormous. If our society is 
motivated primarily by economics, then it is quite obvious that 
many of societies' present ills can be laid at the doorstep of the 
women in this nation, not the male chauvinists. 
There is little doubt that discrimination against women exists 
in the field of job opportunities. However it can be pointed out 
that discrimination also exists for women in various fields. 
Females predominate such fields as teaching, library management 
and secretarial and stenography. Yet it is also true that men dig 
ditches, work in construction, mine coal, haul garbage, lift loads 
and tote bales. In short, they do all the menial, back-breaking and 
degrading jobs in our society. 
The implications of this fact are perhaps, the greatest of all, 
since they mean the difference between life and death. It is 
commonly known that on the average women live longer than 
men. It can be reasonably assumed that the labor men perform 
during their lifetime contribute to their earlier death. 
The predominant social mores are also affected by the 
movement. Such simple courtesies as rising to one's feet, holding 
the door and lighting a cigaret may no longer be due a liberated 
female. 
.Etiquette aside, the question i~ do women want to give up their position in this country -a position obviously more important and powerful than some make it out to be --for the dubious distinction of equality with men?

An Open LeHer 
Dear Maintenance and Other Minority Groups Opposed to a 
Rector Sharing His Digs with a Dog: 
Darby O'Gill is the name of the little brown and white, eight 
months' old cocker spaniel that lives with me at 120 Keenan Hall. Sometimes, if you see us puddle-hopping together on the Quad, you may think we are bad friends; that's only because I'm usually raging .at the beast with curses and hammering at his hinder-parts with my fi~ts. The reasons for this ungentle treatment are these: to discourage the pup from taking off in an independent search for friends and ice cream at the Huddle; and to promote his loyalty to his A.K.C.-registered leader so that he will not make a fool out of himself over every pair of dimpled, coed ankles that dance toward him on the garden path. The young Master O'Gill has some of the finest character traits known to dogdom; but he has not yet learned 
that loyalty to the Master is a puppy's highest form of service. 
But my problem at the moment is not to philosophize on the 
aberrant behaviour of young Darby. Rather, it is how to establish 
the rights of this litt.le guy to live as a member of the Notre Dame 
community. I feel he lives a very threatened existence: Maintenance 
doesn't like him; Security wouldn't J;e for him (though some of 
O'Gill staunchest friends are policemen): and the Dean of Students 
never sends over doggie bags. Last week, a Darby-watcher phoned to 
say there were rumors from the power structure suggesting tha~ the 
animal's days on this campus are numbered. For the rest of the 
week, every time the door open~:;cl, I expected to see Mr. Pears, 
armed with chair, whip, and a can of Mace, waiting to carry off my 
pet to a home for orphaned puppies. . 
One does not want to be sentimental about a dog. One sometimes 
feels embarrassed over the tender feelings he has for a dog. The time 
and care I give Darby, I often think, could much more profitably be 
given to a homeless waif. Should I, then, give ~p Darby O'Gi~l and 
send out to an over-populated country for a reSident ragamuffin for 
Keenan Hall'? I answer myself, only if the hapless mite could learn to 
live on puppy chow for seventy-five cents a week; and only if he 
could learn to shift for himself, with only a red rubber boot as 
company, on the evenings I dine at Frankie's; and only if he caul? 
learn to soil the campus lawns and not the Rector's rug; and only 1f 
he could be satisfied with occasional baths cadged off students 
visiting from St Mary's College and Zahm Hall. 
Darby and I have grown used to each other's ways. On the days I 
have money, he eats; otherwhe, he goes hungry, unless we can beg 
cookies from the Freshmen. He romps on the Quad, or 
accommodates Nature, early or late in the day, depending on the 
time I rise. He has little treats from Good Sales in the evening, on 
the days when I'm not fasting. In turn, every morning and evening, I 
search out the itchy spots on his ears and tum, and I scratch them. 
At night, when he has bad dreams, he knows he can plop d~wn by 
my bed, and I will let my arm dangle over so that _he can lick my 
hand until his fears are quieted, his heart stops racmg, and he can 
nap quietly once again. It is not an elaborate arrangement? but his 
little life is in my keeping, and he is the only thing that lives that I 
can call my own. · 
I nearly lost him once, after the first nine days of our being 
together, when he was eight weeks old. As he frisked about in my 
arms. I accidentally dropped him on his head in the drivewav. When 
he lay there on the pavement, as still as a broken toy, I knew the 
kind of tears that come when sadness touchesthe places in the heart 
where one is still a child. 
Then, in the late Spring, Darby's career as the .Rector's roommate 
seemed threatened from above; and for an anxious week, I sheltered 
him from the news that he might be expelled, as a health menace, 
from the University premises. Later, when I told him his tenancy 
had been approved by Fr. McCarragher and the County Health 
Officer, he puddled on the floor in an obscure commentary 
representing his own kind of insouciance in the face of red tape. But 
forever after, he has kept an old Observer shot of Father Mac, 
mounted, like Snoopy's Van Gogh, on the walls of his doghouse 
somewhere under the Rector's bed. 
After that until just recently, l thought that the young runt of his 
litter could grow up unmolested on Our Lady's quads. But now, 
dark fears springing from black rumors are feeding my feelings of 
paranoia on behalf of my pup. Each time Darby and I cross the 
campus, I can imagine disapproving eves, watching our prancing 
upon the turf. I can hear the voices whispering: "The pooch must 
go.' 
So, dear Maintenance Department, how does one establish a dog 
as a permanent fixture on this campus? Must he play football, 
become Provost, or be elected to the Board of Trustees? How can 
one gain tenure for his pet, .or secure for him ~ university 
appointment that will let him grow t.p as a member of Our Lady's 
household-at least until such a time that it is decided he needs other 
children to play with than th bttckaroos of Keenan, or until he 
decides to go off in search of fulfillment as the owner of his own 
stud farm? 
On becoming ordained, one might have expected to plead with 
Popes, rather than with maintenance departments, for the right to 
choose a companion for life.

" I am a janitor "' 

My name is Howard J. Borowski. 
Sounds like something off "I've Got a Secret," 
doesn't it? But that's the only way that I could 
think of to start this article. By telling you who I 
am. 
If you can not already tell, I am not a writer. I am a janitor. 
I am a good janitor. The people over at the personnel office always call me an "internal maintenance man", but I really prefer to be called a janitor. 
I work as a janitor, and I like to be called a janitor. When I am not called a janitor, I like to be called Howard That is my name. I like my name, and I like my work. 
But I am no ordinary janitor. I don't work in a factory during the all-night shift, like my cousin Freddie does. 
Freddie works as a janitm: because he can find no other job right now, Freddie doesn't lik,e being a janitor, but as he says, "It's a living, ain't it." 
He goes to work 5 days a week. He works. Then he comes home to his wife Emma. They have no children, they just have each other. Freddie and Emma are very happy together. 
Freddie is happy at home with Emma, but not when he is at work. He does his job, but he hates it. He hates sweeping the floors, wiping out the latrines, washing down the walls. Freddie hates everything about being a janitor. 
I have tried to tell Freddie that he is in the wrong place. That he should come to work where I work. He would like it here. But Freddie never listens to anyone. 
I don't work in a factory like Freddie. I work at the University here in town. ·1 don't work at justa college, I work at a University. 
There's a difference, you know. Freddie is young. He is only 32. He could have a good life here. 
I am not young like Freddie. I will be 63 in November. November 26th is my Birthday. Sometimes it falls on Thanksgiving Day. I don't know if it does this year, but when it does I have twice as much to be thankful for. 
I am thankful for those things that I have been blessed with, and the years that I have been given to use those blessed things. 
I was not always a janitor. For more years than 1 can rem em her I was a mason. Not one of those religious guys with the secret handshakes, but a stone mason. A mason builds things for people. 
A mason can-build a stone wall, or a maison. Maison is French for house. "A mason can build a Maison" is an old stonecutters ioke. You have to know some French though, otherwise you won't get it. 
I got too old though to keep on being a 
full-time mason. You have to lift a lot of hea"¥ 
stones, when you are a mason. Lifting a lot of 
heavy stones can hurt your back. 
It hurt mine. 
. That's why I am now a janitor at the University. 
I like being a janitor more than I liked being a 
mason. It was nice to build stuff, but when you 
finished, all you had was stone and cement. 
People liked the stone and cement, but that 
wasn't enough. 
It didn't have the purpose that being a janitm has. I think this is what the kids in my dormitory are talking about when they talk about relevance. 
But I am not sure. I do not go to college, I only work ·at the University. A janitor helps people. He is devoted not tc stone and cement, but to people. I get up every morning at 5, so I can be sure tc get to school by 6. 
r. The first thing I do when I get there is clean oul all the johns, before everyone gets up. 
When they do get up, all the johns are sparkling The kids don't have to worry about the mess, take care of it for them. 
I then sweep the hallways, or at least I used to ­until they put in carpeting. Now I use a vacuum that the University gave me. 
It takes longer to vacuum, but it looks muc~ better. I am happy to do it. j 
It makes the place a lot more pleasant for the kids. They are very important to me. It is for them that I work so hard. 
Someday they will make this country a lot better place to live in. Getting a good education will help them. I don't want them to worry aboul messy hallways, or dirty basements. I want them only to worry about getting an education. 
They can change the country, l just pray tney do it right. It is okay for them to ignore me. Sometimes they even snicker at me. That's okay, too. I work for them because I love them. 
I do not ask for love in return. I ask only that they get out of the University what they are seeking. I do my job, the job I love, to make it ~asier for them.

Co-ed consultants visit campus 
house going to be set up downstairs in LaFortune which we hope to expand greatly and work out a similar arrangement with St. Mary's in some way... Another thing that has been talked about for a long time and which many proposals have been made for is a new activities center, somewhere between Notre Dame and St. Mary's, hopefully some joint venture by the two schools, which would provide students from both schools an opportunity for infor­mal gatherings. Going into the concept of co-education, the informal personal relationships are some of the greatest assets to the program of co-education, and which need to be developed. And it's things like a new activities center, and coffee­houses, and just informal little places to get together that will hopefully accomplish that set­
up.  And it is in  this line  that  
we're  trying  to  develop  the  
social  aspects  of  Notre  Dame.  

There's a committee that's been formed (which is going to report to the board of trustees of Notre Dame) made up of a number of people from the faculty and students from both schools, which will really sit down and take a serious look at the whole situation and hopefully come up with some specific ideas to present. . .In the near future we're going to start setting up discussion groups within each of 
the halls on some informal basis where people can just come and talk and discuss the concept of co-education, what it means, what are its advantages, disad­vantaps, and possibilities here. 
"It's ridiculous," said Tom Keegan, another resident of the wing, "the University has sprayed three or four times but the fumigation only lasts for a few days. There are probably so many that you can't kill them all.'' 
The members of the annex complain that the roaches are coming from a cra~lway b~­neath the hall. Thirteen residents have signed a petition addressed to Fr. Thomas E. Chambers, Director of Student Residences citing instances of finding "cock­roaches in beds,'' along with students being awakened by roaches crawling over their faces and legs. 
In a letter, Fr. Chambers said that he was a ware of the problem and that he was doing everything possible to remedy it.

In a recent OESER VER inter­view, Julie and Tim also pointed out that these consultants, Dr. Lewis Mayhew of Stanford Uni­versity and Dr. Rosemary Park of U.C.L.A., are planning to be on each of the campuses next week to observe operations. Other subjects, such as the purpose of the research and development commission with regard to co-education, were also discussed in the course of the interview; the text is below.

everything, has to be focussed on the whole concept of co­education and brought into the whole perspective of co-educa­tion. It's not just academic; it's much broader. Academics is actually only one small part of it. 
OBSERVER: If co-education were to come about, how would it? Would ND and SMC go co-ed separately, together, or what? 
Julie: Mayhew and Park are consultants who have been en­gaged by both schools to do a study of a master plan of what procedure is going to be the best one for this particular Notre Dame-St. Mary's complex, and our programs probably going to be influenced by their report; our procedure for co-education is definitely going to be in­fluenced by what they recom­mend. It ranges from just separated entities, all the way into just one co-educational institution...with possibly St. Mary's as a college within the university .. .It's up to them to come up with the master plan. 
OBSERVER: What does it

what their report is going to be. 
OBSERVER: What is your corn bined commission attempt­ing to do now, in the short run? 
Julie: What we'd like to try for is kind of an open exchange between the departments. For instance the Notre Dame English department has already acknow­ledged the fact that English courses at Saint Mary's as well as at Notre Dame can fulfill their (the students') eight basic re­quirements for English at Notre Dame. However, St. Mary's hasn't yet made the same agree­ment with their students as far as allowing Notre Dame courses to fulfill the major requirements at St. Mary's. And what we're hoping to do is to iron these problems out in all the depart­ments that they are occuring in. Even the already merged depart­ments such as Speech and Drama are having their pioneer pro­blems, particularly with degrees, in the concept of a joint degree, which we would like to see in the near future. 
OBSERVER: These plans are still all with regard to academic co-education; what about the other, social, areas of co-educa­tion, which Tim mentioned? 
Tim: (There Are) several things that we're trying to do in the line of social areas...well, this commission already has done a lot of work with Mr. Price, (Mr. Edmund Price, head of the Food Service), in develop­ing the Huddle and extending the hours and getting students jobs in the Huddle itself.

I suppose what makes the new ABC Monday night pro football show a real departure is, you have to hit yourself on the side of the head sometimes to be convinced you have't tuned in on the Bob-and-Ray Show. 
First you get Howard Cosell, the man of a thousand syllables, who comes on as if he were reading the tablets of Sinai to a group of retarded children who are hard of hearing and unfamiliar with the language. 
Howard is the master of the innocent insult. A lawyer by profession, a broadsaster by accident, he is capable of some of the most impersonal slaps in the face in the history of television. "Johnny Unitas, they say you can't throw the long ball anymore, that you're through as a long threat." Dick Butkus, they say you're an animal.' Howard's questions have a strong aura of "Have you stopped beating your wife?" about them. He doesn't interview people, he prosecutes them. He implies he wants a definite yes or no, and no volunteering from the witness. He accuses, he doesn t interrogate. The unwary might think they had tuned in on the third degree of a known child molester. 
He's beautiful. He speaks with all the deliberation of a guy who has an arrow in his chest. He treats the game as if it were a pointless interruption of an otherwise brilliant monologue. "Bot (the way he pronounces'Bart') Stah (the way he pronounces 'Starr'), they~re booing you," he may say accusingly. You expect, in the next breath to hear, "How rlo you plead? 
Then Don Meredith comes on with a refreshing Texas twang like a harmonica around a campfire, a guy who is about to say, "Did you hear the one about ... " 
The football game. is quite incidental. They entrust that to Keith Jackson, who is quite capable but seems happy enough to stick to what's happening down on the field. 
They've saddled ABC with a few "dog" games this year-but it'~ not going to matter much: In fact, I might wish more of them were. I find Howard Cosell and Don Meredith more entertaining than a bunch of damn down-an-outs or safety blitzes. 
The charm of Meredith is, he comes on like a riverboat gambler with a heart of gold. He seems to have the life style of a guy who expects to be shot any day by a guy he dealt five aces to. Cosell is as deadly serious as an archangel. Howard feels he has to make somebody SQUIRM; Dandy, which is what the ball players call Meredith, has an"Aw, what the hell, we '11 punt" attitude. 
What Dandy is doing in a broadcasting booth is something for Dallas, Texas, to account for, anyway. He was the best quarterback the Dallas Cowboys ever had. And still could be. When he quit in 1968, he was still only 30 years old and had thrown for 17,119 yards and 135 touchdowns, and had led the Cowboys to two championship games, one of which he lost to Green Bay barely by seven points, and the other by four points. The year he quit~ he led the team to a 12-2 season record and the divisional playoffs. 
There is really no reason he should be reading defenses from a telephone booth instead of from a pocket. The Cowboys let him go with a shrug. But they· haven't done nearly as well without him, to put it nicely. 
The game I can't wait for is the Monday night game of Nov. 16 when St. Louis comes to Dallas, and so does Judge Cosell. Dandy will be keeping it light and amusing and easy on the ears when suddenly a voice from on high will come on interrogating Cowboy coach Tom Landry. "Tum? Tum Landry? They said Don Meredith couldn't win the big ones with this club. Now you can't win the little ones. Tum, will you tell the viewing audience what in the world the Dallas Cowboys are doing without Don Meredith suited up. Speak up, Tum. the microphone is over here." 
I'll tell you-that one should· make NFL Highlights Instant replay, and the Great Speeches of tne Century. All I can say is, Cowboy quarterback Craig Morton (pronounced "Maw-tun'') better have a good night-or they better put in a rule he gt!ts one call to his lawyer and is advised of his rights when he sees the hanging judge coming. 
Analyzing himself, what ad­justment does Farmer have to make to improve his effective­ness? 
The 188-pound pre-Law stu­dent puts it this way. . . "to possibly do a little less scni.m bl­ing, and a little more throwing." 
Football and golf are Farmer's chief athletic pre-occupations these days. Has football helped, or hindered, his golf game? 
"Football gives you a com­petitive instinct," says the ex­Missouri junior amateur 
champion, "that's hard to acquire just by playing golf alone." 
Okay, then, if some genie could endow you with on trait as a college qu~rterback, what would you request? 
Farmer's smile was bemused: "All quarterbacks probably would answer that one the same way. . .I'd like to have the fastest, and most accurate, re­lease in foot ball." 
Voices from the crowd 
Editor: 
In interests of Notre Dame publicity, especially that of Joe Theismann, I think the nationally televised game this Saturday is an ideal time to publicize Joe Theismann's bid for the Heismann Trophy. 
I suggest a planned effort to make a large banner which is sure to be shown to the national audience. The sign should simply read "Theismann for Heismann.'' 
Should Theismann have a great day, the announcers could not help but mention that Theismann would be a good choice. At this stage, it would take a great showing and as much publicity for Joe to beat out Archie Manning. 
I write to you _ as an influencing voice in starting such a publicity stunt. 
Thank you, 
A fan of Joe Theismann 
Frosh fencers meet Tuesday 
Freshmen, now is your chance 
to join the most winning team at 
the University of Notre Dame. 
That is the Fighting Irish fencing 
team. 
Coach Mike DeCicco has 
announced that there will be a 
meeting for all prospective 
fencers next Tuesday evening, 
October 20, at 7:00 p.m. This 
meeting will take place in the 
auditorium in the main 
concourse of the Convo Center. 
(Between the football coaches' 
and the basketball coaches' 
offices.) Anyone unable to at­
tend can call 7042 or 8469 
for information. 
No experience is necessary to 
start fencing As Coach DeCicco 
points out, there have been four 
or five All-American fencers 
who had no experience before 
coming to ND. Most varsity 
fencers are newcomers to the 
sport. 
The winning percentage of the 
fencing squad is an astronomical 
.847 and over the past four years 
their record is 744. 
DeCicco, who is the head of 
the National Fencing Coaches of 
America, will be assisted by 
former Notre Dame 
All-American John Biske. Biske 
was a foilsman in 1965.

Reds 'May' still 
World Series 
BALTIMORE (UPI) -Lee May saved the jittery Cincinnati Reds from the ignominy of being swept in four straight games by cracking a three run eighth inning homer Wednesday to beat Brooks Robinson and the Baltimore Orioles 6-5 in the fourth game of the World Series. 
The Reds were on the brink of being the 11th team in series history to lose all four games ­trailing 5-3 mainly because Brooks Robinson continued his spectacular play with a perfect day at the plate -when May slammed Eddie Watt's first pitch for the three run homer. 
So, the Reds are alive -but barely -as they trail 3-1 going in the fifth game Thursday, needing a victory to send the series back to Cincinnati on Saturday. 
The Reds have the satisfaction of knowing they are only the third team ever to come back and win the fourth game after losing the first three. But it's little consolation for them that both of those teams promptly lost the fifth game and were eliminated.. No team has ever come back from an 0-3 deficit to win the series. 
The Reds looked like losers much of the game-making three errors -but May's homer and 3 2/3 innings of hitless relief ball by Clay Carroll, who shook his fists in the air after striking out Don Buford to end the game, kept the Reds from being eliminated.. 
A crowd of 53,007 came to see the Orioles sweep and they were delighted for most of the game. 
Brooks Robins.on, who was 4 for 4, drove in . twO' runs and scored two and it didn't seem to matter that he was thrown out at the plate by Pete Rose in the third inning because Jim Palmer allowed five hits over the first seven innings and seemed to have the game under control. 
The Reds' top two sluggers, Tony Perez and Johnny Bench, were leading off the eighth but it didn't seem to matter because both were 0 for 3 in the game

many undergraduates patrol the parking lots. Fr. Riehle announced that as of tonight, Alumni Hall will be

Do_~e needs help 
Congressman Allard Lowen­
stein (Dem.-N. Y.), leading House 
dove and 1970 Notre Dame 
Senior Class Fellow, needs 
student help to win reelection in 
a reapportioned congressional 
district, according to organizers 
of a Notre Dame group of 
supporters. Elected through the 
aid of Notre Dame students in 
1968, Lowenstein is reported to 
be over 20,000 votes behind 
according to past voting trends 
in his new dist1ict. 
There will be an organi­zational meeting for students wanting to help Lowenstein in the campaign tonight at 7:30 in Rm. 127 Nieuwland Science Hall to discuss transportation and housing. Anyone interested in helping should be at the meeting or should call one of the following organizers: Lance Corey, 234-9632; Ed Davey, 6889; or Dennis Duggan, 8205. 
and to carry pistols. Oniy two regular c;~mpus Security men carry guns, and for their own defense, the force will soon be issued mace. 
At the chance of destroying some of the "quaint uniqueness ot the campus," floodlights will be established in the near future to illumine the Main Quad. Fr. Riehle said that for $188,000 a comples network of locks and monitors, such as found in many modern universities, could be constructed at Notre Dame_ He said that such a system would enable Security to do a better job in guarding the buildings and allow us to lay off a few men. It would pay for itself in five or six years. He felt, however, that there is very small chance that it will come about. 
The Security Department has a budget of $280,000 a year. It isn't enough, according to Fr. Riehle, and perhaps the Univer­sity had better review its 
priorities. Student driving fees and parking fines are !riven tn 
Security, but faculty members who amass as many fines as students, are exempt from 
paying them. 
Fr. Riehle appealed to the Faculty Senate to establish a much better report between the University and the Security Police. Ht! told them that they would be appalled to spend a half an hour in the guard shack 
listening to the verbal abuse that constantly born bards the men, and he urged them to build up respect for the Security forces in

fic tickets and when they allow questionable actions in the dor­mitories to go unreprimanded. If we see something we don't like in the students, perhaps we had better look to ourselves-as the faculty."

and Perez was I for 13 and Bench 2 for 14 in the series. However, Palmer walked Perez on a 3-2 pitch and Bench promptly singled him to third. Manager Earl Weaver, who'd made all the right moves in the series, decided to bring on Eddie · Watt in relief for his first appearance of the series to face May. May has been the Reds' best hitter in the series. And he clouted Watt's first pitch into the left field seats as the Oriole fans watched in disbelief and the small contingent of Reds' fans cheered. May, who also singled in a run for the Reds in the third, now has six hits and eight RBis in the series after collecting 34 homers and 125 RBis during the regular season. Manager Sparky Anderson of the Reds said he's decided not to bring his second game starter ­Jim McGlothlin -back in the fifth game on Thursday. He says he'll gamble with Jim Merritt, Milt Wilcox or Wayne Granger in that game. Granger, the top relief man, didn't start a game all year and Wilcox was bombed in the second game and started only two games in September after being called up from the minors. Merritt is the team's only 20 game winner but he's been ailing and hasn't pitched in the series. Baltimore will counter with Mike Cuellar, who was shelled in the second game, as its starter.
