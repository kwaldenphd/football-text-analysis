Campus ATMs shutdo-wn 
By WILL PUCKETT NcwsWrit<r 
Studcnl'i reported several inci­dents of malfunctioning ATM machines on campus over the Super Bowl weekend, reporting they were unable to withdraw money from them. 
The malfunctions were report­t!tl to have occurred in Beckers, LaFortune and North Dining Hall, primarily on Saturday, although the exact extent of the malfunc­tions is unknown. 
These problems were not part of a planned outage. nor were they part of a system-wide prob­lem, said to Wade Yoder, vice president and chief information officer at the Notre Dame Federal Credit Union. 
"The outages were just a set of coincidences, since we don't schedule maintenance on the weekends, and we received no notice that there was a larger out­age," Yoder said. 
According to Siegfried freshman Matt Brannon. the malfunctions were a large inconvenience.

SMC students experience teaching 
By TERESA NOWAKOWSKI 
News Writer 
For Saint Mary's students looking toward a future in teaching, the teacher educa­tion program at the College provides a rigorous training program designed to height­en experience in the field before graduation. 
Student teachers are encouraged to develop over­arching "big ideas" in which an important lesson is taught and the technical and normal curriculum requirements are taught within that idea. Students are required to observe and gain experience in the classroom beginning their sophomore year, which leads to greater confidence 
in student teaching as  well  
as  going into the field  as  a  
licensed teacher.  

This year's teacher educa­tion program includes 52 elementary, three elemen­tary-middle school, six mid­dle school-secondary and 23 secondary education student teachers. 
Kitty Green, an assistant professor of education and the program director, said that each of the students "have the right motivation and disposition to be great teachers." 
Senior Anne Courtney began teaching kindergarten at Darden Primary Center this semester. 

"A student teacher must have the right tempera­ment," she said. "Not just anybody can be a teacher; you have to be open to so much." 
A different disposition is 
required when observing and teaching in middle school versus high school. Junior Lindsay Downs has been observing in the classroom and finds that with "older kids, you're allowed to be more yourself." which leads to an increase in security and trust. Lindsay Evans, a senior student teacher placed with 9th and 12th graders at Clay High School, said that younger students typically exert higher imma­turity levels, thus leading to

It has come to our attention that MTV is deeply and fundamentally incapable of putting on a halftime show.

the moment,  
our attentions  

will be directed at a more pressing issue, of greater cultural import, and of wider scope in its commentary on ­nay, indictment of-American culture. 
Let us recall the cast of characters which filled that wooden "0" Sunday night: we saw, as mentioned, Ms. Jackson and Mr. Timberlake. We were presented with two rappers, one of whom does not profess to own a last name and another who insists on changing his bi-annually. We endured Mrs. Simpson-or is it Lachey? And lastly, we were visually and aurally assaulted by the all-American badass­ness of Mr. Rock, whose act's only redeeming quality may have been the post-menopausal aggressiveness of its drummer. 
On their own, these entertainers ­let us rephrase that, "professionals of the entertainment industry" -each merely leave us wishing for a real artist to fill the void they occupy. But when such a lineup is presented as the entirety of the night's musical output, it is not only we who shudder: Nature herself abhors such a vacuous display of bad taste and artistic incompetence. 
Those who seriously value popular music for its potential as an art form have long since learned that MTV will merely provide them an outlet for repressed masochism. MTV glorifies two things: MTV and the current fad. If your product does not tithe at the altar of popularity it is tossed out onto the trash heap; if it sold well last month, then the market is exhausted and it is time for something new and equally mindless. 
What is most disturbing, however, is not that MTV could produce, and CBS air, such a display without a single musician in the lineup (with, perhaps, the exception of the aforementioned drummer); no, what fills us with trepi­dation are the screaming mobs which surrounded Messrs. Combs, Haynes, Timberlake and Ritchie and Misses Jackson and Simpson, eating up their every offering as ifit were the latest chapter of divine revelation. These paragons of democracy are skilled beyond belief in doing exactly as they are told, enjoying everything they are instructed to enjoy, and voting with their dollars to ensure that no Billboard Top Hits list in the foreseeable future will be dominated by artists with any measure of articulation or idea content in their music. 
We greet with open arms the announcement that the Super Bowl has learned its lesson and will leave MTV to run its own competing program­ming. We only wish that it had been the debacle of the halftime show as a whole, rather than a celebrity wardrobe malfunction, which brought that decision about.

Camel roams Sweden road during snowstorm 
STOCKHOLM, Sweden ­It took some convincing before police would respond to reports of a camel on a southern Sweden road in the middle of a snowstorm. 
"We were somewhat doubtful at first," said police spokesman Sten-Ove Fransson in Skoevde, 162 miles south of Stockholm, of Friday's incident. "But then more people called, so we were finally convinced that there really was a camel gone astray on the road." 
Before police arrived, friends of the camel's owner came and led it back to a stable, where it has been kept while awaiting a home in a new barn. 
Owner Anneli Arvidsson said in a telephone inter­view that the 22-year-old Siberian camel, Emat, might have wandered off because of the absence of his usual companion, a horse. 
"On Friday, the horse had been taken inside the stable and the camel was left alone in the pasture, which proba­bly made him feel lonely," she said.

annoyed me," he said. 
Brannon said he attempted to use the North Dining Hall ATM on Saturday and the lower LaFortune ATM on Sunday. Both times, the machines displayed messages say­ing the transactions could not be completed, despite the fact he had adequate funds in his account. · 
"It looked the same as it always does, but then it was giving me errors," Brannon said. 
The credit union hires a mainte­nance company to provide immedi­ate service to each ATM if it should malfunction, Yoder said. 
"The machines are all set up automatically, so that if anything goes wrong with them, they call the service line and a service crew is sent out within two hours," Yoder said. "If it were to take longer than two hours, we would get a call." 
No such call was received this weekend, and Yoder said that, in quickly looking through his logs, the only thing that immediately attracted attention was one ATM that had a card jammed in it. Yoder said one machine in LaFortune has been having trouble with its receipt printer and that may have been a problem as well. 
"That receipt printer has been giving us trouble," Yoder said. "It's old and needs to be replaced." 
In addition to these two possibili­ties, there is one caveat that may have trapped some students. Yoder said the maintenance company does not make service calls after 10 
p.m. until the next morning. Thus, some students may have attempted to use the machines after service hours, especially on Saturday evening. 
Further analysis of ATM logs as to the specific causes of the outages was unavailable, but Yoder expressed confidence in the main­tenance company and quoted the uptime of the machines across campus as being from 98 to 99 per­cent. 
"We've been able to increase the uptime of the ATMs drastically ... which really only makes it easier for students, faculty and staff to use the machines when they need to," Yoder said. 
The credit union maintains 11 ATMs in a variety of locations on campus and regularly reevaluates where machines should be placed. As part of this, two ATMs were moved from the football stadium to the Joyce Center this year at the conclusion of the football season. The ATM in the Hammes ]3ookstore is also slated to be moved up to the front foyer from its current loca­tion. ·

Britain to probe Iraq intelligence 
LONDON -The British government said Monday it was prepared to follow the U.S. lead and investigate the intelligence on which Prime Minister Tony Blair based his decision to join the United States in going to war with Iraq. 
Blair was expected to announce on Tuesday an oflicial inquiry in an appearance before a parliamentary committee, just days after a senior judge cleared the government of allegations it distorted what it knew about Iraq's weapons programs to build a case for war. 
"Mr. Blair will announce on Tuesday morn­ing some sort of inquiry about the intelli­gence of Iraq's weapons before the war," a Blair spokesman said on condition of anonymity.

Bird flu claims two more victims 
Autopsies confirm deaths in Vietnam, Thailand; China says virus is spreading 
Associated Press 
BANGKOK-Asia's bird flu death toll rose to 12 with the announce­ment Monday of two additional deaths, while China said it suspect­ed the virus has reached poultry in one of its most remote corners. 
U.N. officials warned the out­break was far from over. 
The latest victims were an 18­year-old man in Vietnam who died Monday and a 58-year-old woman in Thailand whose death was con­firmed Monday to be from bird flu following an autopsy. 
"Bird flu remains a serious public and animal health threat and con­tinues to spread," said He Changchui of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. "The eruption of new infection cases in Thailand, China and Vietnam shows that the disease is far from being under control." 
FAO officials said they believe the disease is spreading in Thailand and Vietnam. but the situation is less clear for China. where investi­gators may only now be picking up previously undetected cases. 

The U.N. agency announced it was hosting an urgent three-day meeting in Rome beginning Tuesday on the bird flu crisis. 
Bird flu has struck poultry in at least 10 Asian countries, but infec­tions in people have been reported only in Thailand and Vietnam. 
Doctors in Germany were await­ing test results on a woman who recently returned from Thailand complaining of nausea, dizziness and fever. However, Herbert Schmitz, a virus expert at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, played down chances the woman has bird flu. 
The World Health Organization continued investigating the possi­bility two Vietnamese women caught the virus from a relative in what would be the first human-to­human transmission in this year's outbreak. But WHO said there was no evidence of a new straiQ that can easily be passed among people. 
Witness accounts were not con­sistent, but WHO investigators say the most likely centers on a family wedding. ' 
On the day of thft' wedding, Jan. 3, the groom and one of his sisters prepared a duck. The groom fell ill Jan. 6 and was hospitalized the next day. On Jan. 10, both the sis­ter who helped prepare the duck, as well as the bride -who did not -fell ill. The next day, a second sister got sick. 
The groom died Jan. 12 and the bride and two sisters were hospi­talized a day later. The two sisters died, but the bride survived. 
Investigators could not trace the infections of the second sister or the bride to exposure to birds. Neither human-to-human transmis­sion nor direct contact with sick poultry can be ruled out, WIIO said. 
Health officials may never be able to confirm what happened, in part because the brother's remains were cremated and because family accounts were conflicting. 
No other cases of people catching the virus from other people have been suspected anywhere else.

difficulty when attempting to manage a classroom. 
Managing the classroom is one of the bigger fears that student teachers hav­ing. Upon entering the field professionally, senior Lizzie Siefert worries most about developing interest­ing curriculums while maintaining classroom control. 
Like Siefert, many sen­iors worry about finding a job in the school in which they want to teach follow­ing graduation. 
"The schools that are more attractive are more attractive to teachers," Courtney said. 
Often, teachers have to take jobs in schools that they did not necessarily want. Some teachers also worry that the "big idea" curriculum taught at Saint Mary's is so new and dif­ferent from that taught in other states, it will not be well received. 
However, student teach­ers' excitement and drive shines through worries they may have. 
Senior Mary Kartheiser admitted she had no desire to accompany friends at Heartland on Thursday's nights while she taught at St. Anthony de Padua Elementary School. Instead, she was "excited to be planning the next day's lesson." 
Some advice these stu­dents would give to other aspiring teachers? 
"Appreciate every moment you have in the classroom with the stu­dents," said Siefert. Most agree with Evans that, "if you can get one student to change themselves some­how, then you've done something."

"It's clear that a lot of these comments are coming out of a lack of education," McGee said. 
To combat this, McGee said that she and others are work­ing on a proposal to bring before tonight's Student Senate meeting that would form a task force to investigate the feasibility of mandating a semester-long required course for all Notre Dame undergrad­uates that would focus on diversity. 
Members-used the remainder of Monday's meeting to view a video recounting a trip taken by Emily Chin, student body vice president, and other Notre Dame students to Nigeria for a conference on increasing dia­logue with Africa and to receive updates from the com­mittees. 
The RA training and gender relations committees did not meet last week and had no news to report. The CLC pur­pose committee continued to explore ways in which the 
organization could be used more effectively, Lao said. 
Wyatt Maxwell updated members on the success of a senior night held at Legends on Thursday that he and the senior privileges committee helped to organize. 
"[Senior night] was well received," he said. "[Legends] ran out of Corona and were two handles away from run­ning out of margaritas." 
Chin briefed the CLC on progress being made toward providing transportation serv­ices to students with tempo­rary disabilities. 
"We're continuing to look into increasing services for temporarily disabled stu­dents," she said. 
Chin cited free scooters available to students with tem­porary disabilities as proof of the committee's work on the issue but then retracted it after learning students pur­chased the scooters by stu­dents using their insurance and not through the University. 
"I must have been misin­formed," Chin said. "We were under the impression that the Provost's Office would now take care of it."

Mass to honor Stri tch 
Special to The Observer 
A memorial Mass for Thomas Stritch, professor emeritus of American studies at Notre Dame, will be celebrated today at 3:30 p.m. in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. 
Rev. Thomas Blantz, C.S.C., professor of history at Notre Dame, will preside at the Mass, and Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., president emeritus, will give the homily. 
Stritch, who died Jan. 22 in . Nashville, Tenn., was graduated from Notre Dame in 1934, joined the faculty the following year and remained at Notre Dame for the rest of the centu­ry. 
A Nashville native, Stritch 
came to Notre Dame as a stu­dent in the fall of 1930, received a master's degree and joined the faculty in 1935. Interrupted only by four years of naval serv­ice during World War II, he made the University his home for the rest of the century. 
He taught journalism, English and American studies at Notre Dame, chaired the Journalism Department from 1946 to 1957 and the Department of Communication Arts from 1957 to 1970. 
He retired in 1978 and contin­ued to live and work at Notre Dame, publishing a popular memoir, "My Notre Dame: Memories and Reflections of 60 ¥ears," in 1991.

IN BRIEF 
Bush seeks rise in SEC funding 
WASIIINGTON -President Bush is seeking a 13 percent increase in the budget for the Securities and Exchange Commission, includ­ing $18.7 million for new staff to work on its huge caseload of corporate and mutual fund misconduct. 
The $913 million request to Congress on Monday for the budget year starting Oct. 1 includes $20 million that the SEC was unable to spend last year because it couldn't hire new accountants and attorneys fast enough. 
Under landmark anti-fraud legislation enacted in 2002 amid the corporate scandals, Congress gave the SEC expanded powers and almost doubled the budget of the traditionally low-profile agency with 3,300 employees. 
ImCione employee testifies in trial 
NEW YOHK -Martha Stewart called lmClone Systems headquarters and demanded to talk to founder Sam Waksal to find out "what was going on" with Imclone's falling share price on the day she dumped her stock in the company, a former ImClone secretary testified Monday. 
Emily Perret, a former secretary to the now­jailed Waksal, said Stewart was "very hurried and harsh and direct" in the call on Dec. 27, 2001. 
The government says the call happened just after Stewart sold 3,928 shares of ImClone stock -the sale that triggered the investiga­tion that now has Stewart on trial for obstruc­tion of justice and securities fraud. 
Treasury to borrow $1778 
WASlllNGTON-The government expects to tap $177 billion from the credit markets this quarter, which would mark the largest amount ever borrowed in any quarter, the Treasury Department said Monday. 
The new borrowing estimate for the January-to-March quarter is bigger than the previous projection of $160 billion made in November. 
"This increase in borrowing is due to lower receipts, primarily from an increase in tax refunds, and higher outlays," the department said. Officials would not provide more detailed information.

Bishop responds to assertions 
Having been away from Peoria for a week, I was aston­ished and horrified to read upon my return home, the Jan. 27 letter from Edward Fitzpatrick which asserts that I was somehow a part of a cover-up regarding the conduct of James Burtchaell. I would like to say for the record that in the years when I s~rved as Rector of Dillon Hall (197 5 thru the early 1980's), I never had any knowledge of sexual mis­conduct on the part of Burtchaell. If I had, I would have immediately reported this to my superiors. During that era, Burtchaell was not only the Provost, but he was also a widely admired preacher, teacher and author. I like most others at Notre Dame would never have imagined him to be capable of misusing his ministry. I should also like to say that while we were both religious confreres, we were not close friends. Even the most clueless freshmen at Dillon Hall would have rather quickly noticed that there was per­sistent tension between Burtchaell and myself regarding all kinds of dorm issues, especially discipline. It was only some years later during my tenure as Religious Superior that I became aware of allegations being made against Burtchaell. I was a part of both the investigation and the subsequent process of his removal from public ministry. 
Even for a publication as notoriously without standards as the Notre Dame Observer, printing unsubstantiated and libelous charges against someone's good name is simply unconscionable. Your complete lack of professional judg­ment has now enabled some special interest groups here in Central Illinois to gleefully announce: "Bishop Jenky of the Catholic Diocese of Peoria has a history of covering up sex­ual abuse." You have done me a serious injustice that in the current climate will negatively effect my service as a bish­op.

Where Have All the True Patriots Gone? 
When the New England Patriots won the first Super Bowl after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, many peo­ple, especially embittered St. Louis Rams fans, alluded to a government Peter Quaranto conspiracy theory of rallying patriot­ism. Such ground­A call to less rambling Action ended this Sunday with the Pats' sec­ond Super Bowl win in three years, but questions of patriotism continue to hold relevance in our post-September 11th world. 
Since the terrorist attacks on that Tuesday morning, our world has never been the same. The question, though, that follows is this: Can we step out­side our culture enough to compre­hend how our world has changed? I fear that too many of us have neglect­ed to be critical of the forces at work in this new world. 
Responding to this changing world, the mass American populace has ral­lied around the flag and danced to the hit tune "Everybody get together, try to love George W. Bush together right now." Embracing nationalism, perpet­uated in "city upon a hill" language and wrapped in a dubious patriotism, the average American has played right into the Fox News "culture of fear." The clearest political consequence has been the current administration's blank check to "shock and awe" the world, as in Iraq, while avoiding the many pressing socio-economic reali­ties that plague our country and world, such as world hunger and poverty. 
The "culture of fear" is perhaps the most alarming of all these trends. In his 1933 Inaugural Address, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said the following, which is often overused in the senior quotes of high school yearbooks, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." A society driven by fear is not one that can adequately address the many needs of civil society .. 
More and more American citizens are beginning to realize these prob­lems, especially with the recent news of faulty intelligence about Iraq, but such citizens often have to face claims that they are anti-patriotic and anti­American. This then brings this dis­cussion back to where it began: ques­tions of patriotism. 
In the modern "you're.either with us or against us" age, perceptions of patriotism re11ect a divided society. For some, patriotism means a faith in and devotion to the goodness of America as the "city upon a hill" to prevail against all evil in this world. Yet for some others, patriotism means a commitment to actively call our country to higher ideals, particularly being a force for peace and justice in the larger world. 
As you can probably guess, I sub­scribe to the latter school of patriot­ism. American history, when not coat­ed in tall tales of Christopher Columbus finding America, is a history of mistakes and people rising to the challenges of such mistakes to move our country back to its ideals. 
In many ways, American history is a sad history. Ours is a country, founded on the genocide of Native Americans and the economics of the slave trade, which has been through and continues to go through battles over racism. women's rights, workers' rights, mili­tarism, systematic poverty and more. Such battles have only given way to justice when citizens have called our country to live up to its ideals, which is showing the greatest respect for our country. Hence, patriotism implies an active cynicism, rather than a blind passivity. 
Relating this to our world and the coming presidential election, it is imperative that each of us be critical of the present forces. We cannot allow a "culture of fear" to destabilize and pacify us into blind obedience to state. We have to truly evaluate our times in order to use our gifts and energies to set our country in the right direction. 
On Sunday, the New England Patriots showed us that true patriots. when they come together and believe in something, can achieve great things. This year, may we come together and believe great things, not out of fear, but out of hope that a bet­ter future is possible. 
Peter Quaranta is a sophomore polit­ical science and international peace studies major. As a Massachusetts cit­izen, he wants to thank and praise the New England Patriots for their second Super Bowl victory in three years. The Red Sox are next. Contact him at pquarant@nd. edu.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
A Superbowl peep show 
Like it or not America finds itself at war. Many have criticized our actions abroad as threatening America's "moral authority" around the world. Regardless of one's political views on the War on Terrorism. Iraq, etc. I would like to approach this lapse in "moral authority" in a.' different light. On Sunday, 140 million people in the United States and millions more worldwide watched this year's Super Bowl as well as the Halftime Show, which will go down as the most con­troversial ever. Justin Timberlake, while finishing his song with the lyrics ''I'll get you naked by the end of this song" proceeded to expose Janet Jackson's bare breast. While Timberlake claims it was a "wardrobe malfunction," CBS and my genera­tion's beloved MTV (both owned by Viacom) have apologized "to anyone who was offended" by the "unre­hearsed, unplanned, completely unin­tentional" actions. Yet MTV's own Web site produced an article entitled "Janet Jackson's Super Bowl Show Promises 'Shocking Moments"' posted last Wednesday, four days before the embarrassing moment. Meanwhile, 
MTV has pulled the article from its website (although you can still access it using Google). It is a sad day when the Super Bowl can no longer be a family show. 
All of which brings me to America's standing around the world. With mil­lions watching the Super Bowl inter­nationally, what message does the Justin-Janet peep show send to those around the world who wonder for what America is lighting? Are these the 'values' for which the brave men and women of our armed forces arc shedding their blood daily? When we talk about the ideals that serve as the cornerstone of this blessed nation, how do we expect to be taken serious­ly around the world when the percep­tion is that we fight for the right to televise a worldwide peep show? Worse yet, the executives at MTV and CBS do not have the courage to take responsibility for their actions. No wonder public opinion of the media is at an all-time low.

Base Presidential vote on 
facts, not purely faith 
I would like to thank Bill Rinner for his effort to inform -and instruct ­the Catholic voting populace. Unfortunately, however, I did not understand some of his argument. For instance, he asserts that Bush "facili­tated what Catholic social teaching considers an unjust war in Iraq." I have seen this claim made many times, but I have yet to see it defend­ed. I wish Bill Rinner had bothered to explain in exactly what way or ways the war in Iraq has violated clear Catholic social teaching. There has been plenty of disagreement over this issue among serious Catholic thinkers, so I find it odd for him to make it sound like a matter of accept­ed fact. The war was declared by competent authority, other means had been exhausted, and the good done has clearly outweighed the harm. Help us out here, Bill; we are not all as fluent in Catholic social teaching as you. 
Even if the war was unjust, though, one could hardly claim that unjust war is a core Republican value. Indeed, numerous prominent Republicans have questioned the war, including Senator Hagel, who may well be a strong contender for the nomination in 2008. The world will end, though, before a Democrat is nominated who would support any restrictions on abortion whatsoever. Abortion is the very heart of the Democratic platform; dissent from party policy on other issues can be tolerated, but not on abortion. That is why Senator Bayh, according to some reports, was not chosen to run with AI Gore, though Bayh would have helped the ticket much more than Senator Lieberman did. 
It is true, neither party is a perfect example of Catholic values, but that does not mean one is not far worse than the other. I cannot think of a sin­gle Republican plank that runs plainly contrary to Catholic teaching. You may suggest the death penalty. or free enterprise, but these are not categori­cally opposed to Church doctrine. 
What is really disturbing is that Rinner seems to be aggressively argu­ing that how we vote does not matter anyway. "No single vote will ever make you more or less of a Catholic," he claims. What if I vote for a skin­head? What of German Catholics who knowingly supported the Third Heich? An extreme example maybe, but rele­vant. 
The hostility Rinner shows toward people who consult their faith in moments of uncertainty is also alarm­ing. Heaven forbid we should ask our­selves what God would want us to do, when we cannot figure out what to do otherwise. "Listen to your conscience regarding political issues, not your religion," Rinner pontificates. Well, yes, sir! What if, however, our intel­lect has convinced us that Christ is who He claimed to be. and that the Church is what it claims to be ­would we not then be obligated to respect His teachings, as delivered by the Church, over our own views? 
Finally, Rinner commands us not to vote based on some "utopian religious view of how America should be that is inconsistent with the reality of the modern world." This seems to be an excellent recipe for not improving the world at all. If civil rights leaders had adopted that attitude, perhaps we should still have lynching. 
Ultimately, we all have to decide for ourselves how we vote, as we have to decide how we act in general; and we will be judged for all we do. The Church recognizes this, and provides us with guidelines, for our benefit. We can accept or reject them as we wish. For people like Bill Rinner to insist, though, that it is wrong for the Church to provide such guidelines, or for individual Catholics to consult them, borders on the very closed­minded intolerance he seems to con­demn.

CONCERT REVIEW 
Mae shows promise with live show 
At a concert in Toledo, Mae and other opening acts rocked fans 
By MAUREEN BUSH 
Scene Music Critic 
Luke's Barn was filled past capacity as more than 400 kids packed the tiny Toledo, Ohio venue Jan. 31 to see one of the most well-crafted concerts on the road right now. Mae, the headlining band took up­and-coming artists Copeland, The Working Title, and Slow Coming Day out for a nation-wide tour, hitting almost every major city in the United States. 
The show opened with What's the Point, who were celebrating their CD release party that night. These three gentlemen from Toledo had a fast-paced style with vocals and music seemingly representative of the latest trend in "scremo" rock. They put on a decent show and are likely to become more popular in their area, though their music was not particu­larly consistent with the rest of the musical acts of the night. 
Next was Slow Coming Day. This southern California quartet, made up of Orion Walsh on vocals and guitar, Brad Smith on guitar, Dave Stoots on bass and Jason Sheets on drums took the stage and began their set for their first time ever in Ohio. Though Walsh did not say a lot between songs dur­ing their seven-song set, the music spoke volumes. 
The band had impressive timing, knowing when to speed up and when to back down. "Behind Blue Eyes," the final song on their full-length release, Farewell to Familiar, was an excellent way to end a very good set. Slow Coming Day are incredibly tal­ented and will only improve with time. 
The Working Title from Charleston, S.C., was the next band to grace the tiny stage that night. It became evident before their set that lead singer Joel Hamilton was ready for a good time as fans responded to what he was saying during his sound check. Hamilton's unique voice and his rocking acoustic guitar were a very pleasant surprise. They played most of the songs off their EP, Everyone Here Is Wrong. 
The night kept improving as Copeland took the stage. Hailirig from Atlanta, Ga., Copeland has been gaining national recognition as of late for their newly released music video, "Walking Downtown," off their Militia Group-released, full-length titled Beneath the Medicine Tree. 
The band opened their set with intensity and it was incredible how well the music flowed. There was never a dull-moment as their full and melodic brand of music kept the audience on their toes throughout the whole set. 
The pinnacle act of the night was Norfolk, Va.­based quintet Mae. Made up of Dave Gimenez on vocals and guitar, Zach Gehring on guitar, Mark Padgett on bass, Rob Sweitzer on keyboards and back up vocals, and Jacob Marshall on drums, Mae pulled out all the stops for their first ever nation­wide headlining tour. 
The sound this band has developed is incredible. Playing like veterans, no two songs were similar, and each song portrayed a different aspect of emo­tion with its own personality. 
They began their set with an unreleased and rarely played song, "Tisbury Lane," then quickly 
sped up the tempo by breaking into the spectacular drum beats of "All Deliberate Speed," followed by "Runaway," both from their full-length Destination Beautiful. 
A beautifully crafted piano solo led the band into "Sun," during which technical difficulties ensued. Gimenez's microphone cut out toward the beginning of the song, and the crowd was left with only an instrumental version. The silence did not last long, as everyone in the room raised their voices to fill the void. The microphone was fixed just in time for Gimenez to dedicate "Soundtrack For Our Movie" to all the ladies in the room and then to play their catchy first single, "Summertime." 
They then finished up their set with current single "Embers and Envelopes," the melodic "Giving It Away" and fittingly "Goodbye, Goodnight." 
Anyone would be hard-pressed to find a band of this caliber. Mae played an excellent show to the well over-capacity crowd in Toledo. If they are this tight on their first nation-wide headlining tour, it will be interesting to see how they will progress to stardom and pow quickly it will come. Mae is an incredibly enjoyable band to watch perform. Their live show is one of the best out there, above and beyond expectations. 
Every band on this tour had innumerable amounts of talent that shohe through quite clearly to the audience. Not only did every band play well, they also stayed long after the show ended to meet their fans. The worst part of this show was that it had to end at all.

AUTHOR PROFILE 
Frolll baseball to books: a moment with John Grishalll 

By JOE HETTLER 
Scone Writer 
John Grisham always dreamed of playing professional baseball, beginning with his childhood days of listening to St. Louis Cardinal games on the radio. 
For two reasons, however, he never did. 
"1 played little league ball, high school ball and tried to play college ball, but I was scared of a fastball and couldn't touch a curve." Grisham said. "So that kind of nar­rows it down." 
So Grisham turned to writing novels ­his second dream. Sixty million books later, this dream has turned out just fine for the retired lawyer from Mississippi. 
"!Writing) was a secret hobby; nobody knew about except my wife," Grisham said. "Once I realized I was actual­ly going to finish ("A Time to 
Kill"). I thought it would be "Writing was a it around the house like any nice to write full-time -other kid."

Grisham's fifth such event in 
the past 10 years at various locations. 
"They're just wonderful events," he said. "I have a great time, and it's total fun. It's great for the players, because it gives them a Jot of attention and raises a lot of money." 
Grisham will be the keynote speaker at the event, which starts at 7 p.m. Former Notre Dame player Steve Stanley will also be at the banquet. 
Grisham worked as a lawyer for ten years before beginning his first novel. Once he started composing his first book, how­ever, Grisham said he woke up every day at 5 a.m. to write before heading into the courtroom. 
As his fans know, Grisham's consistency is one of his greatest abilities. His books have landed him on the national bestseller list nearly every year. After finishing his first book, "A Time to Kill," in 1987, he has produced a book almost ever year since, and he has been acclaimed by Publishers Weekly as"the bestselling novelist of the 90s."

Grisham said that. though writing novels is never easy, the finished product is usual­ly rewarding. lie and his family vacation every summer before he begins a new book, and he usually finishes the novel around Thanksgiving. 
"There is no shortage of ideas." Grisham said. '"The Last Juror' is number 17, and !novels! arc still fun to write. The words and ideas are still coming pretty fast." 
With Grisham's success has come addi­tional pressure, but Grisham thinks that pressure can only help his writing. 
"There's always pressure to deliver a good book," he said. "When I start writing a book, I want it to be the best thing I've ever written. Pressure is healthy because it keeps you honest. I'm serious about what I do, and I want to get better." 
Writing has not gotten in the way of Grisham's continued love of baseball. From his time as a child working on his parents' farm in Arkansas to working all day as a lawyer, Grisham always has looked for­ward to listening to the St. Louis Cardinal games on the radio. He used these experi­ences in his novel, "A Painted House." 
"The St. Louis Cardinals were on the radio every night, and that was our only contact with the outside world," Grisham said. "There was no television, so that was the highlight of every day -sitting on the porch and listening to the Cardinals. As soon as I could, I picked up a baseball and started throwing

MOVIE REVIEW 
Mona Lisa doesn't smile big 
By BECCA SAUNDERS 
Scene Movie Critic 
The 1950's, an all-girls school, Julia Hoberts, Kristen Dunst, and Julia Stiles -no one expected an Oscar, but this attempt at a female­focused ver­sion of "Dead Poet's Society" is much more disappointing than anyone expected. 
"Mona Lisa Smile," known by most as the latest Julia Hoberts film, is a movie with a good message that is nice to watch, but it is far from being called a great and entertaining film. 
Set in 1953, Julia Roberts plays the part of Katherine Watson, a lib­eral. Bohemian professor from California who moves to New England to teach at the prestigious female school Wellesley College. Watson is greeted by snobby girls, strict rules and heavy judgment from her stu­dents and the school. The snobbiest girl is Betty Warren, played by Kristen Dunst. Friends and roommates are played by Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Ginnifer Goodwin. Watson expects to find intelligent and driven women in the students at Wellesley, but instead she finds intelligent girls focused on fitting into the societal mold for woman at that time. Watson then goes forth on her mission to convert the assumptions of the girls, and the film ends with a mix of tears and happiness -big surprise. 
Although the costumes are terrific and Roberts' character is inspir­ing, not much of a message is conveyed in "Mona Lisa Smile." Roberts's character is seemingly contradictory, as she chastises the girls for settling for a life dictated by men, while at the same time she pursues a relationship with the male teacher known for affairs with his own students. While this imperfection does make Watson a bit more real as a character, it works more to make her seem hypocriti-

cal. Watson seems too noble to be so easily drawn into a relationship with the smooth­talking, war-hero Italian pro­fessor. The love story element seems thrown into the plot and hurts the cohesiveness of the storyline. 
As far as the acting itself goes, Roberts does a generally good job, playing a variation of the same character she plays in most of her movies: the unique, quirky, beautiful (insert profession here). 

Dunst and Stiles, the two other major stars in the movie, arc simply awful. They are awkward, not believable, and just plain annoying to watch. The motivations of their characters are unclear, and although the script left much to be wished for, the poor-caliber acting by these two is just inexcusable. Gyllenhaal and Goodwin, on the other hand, do a terrific job with their characters. Gyllenhaal shines as the fiery Giselle, and Goodwin is adorable as the quiet Constance. The rest of the acting is summed up in one word: bad. 
While "Mona Lisa Smile" is a poor-quality film in many ways, it does maintain some endearing elements. Sitting through it is not painful; it does bring a bit of laughter and a touch of tears to any person willing to invest himself in the .storyline. The film, however, by no means deserves to be recognized as a great movie. The only motivation to go see jt would be a love for Julia Hoberts and a discovery of $6 on the ground. Otherwise, just rent the good version with Hobin Williams.

NBA 

O'Neal suspended one game for criticizing officials 

Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS -Shaquille O'Neal was suspended without pay by the NBA on Monday, one day after using obscene language and publicly ·criticiz­ing the officials during a televi­sion interview. 
The suspension was announced just hours after O'Neal issued a statement apol­ogizing for the comments he made following the Lakers' 84­83 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Sunday. 
O'Neal will serve the suspen­sion Monday night, sitting out a game against the Eastern Conference-leading Indiana Pacers. It will cost him nearly $295,000. 
Lakers coach Phil Jackson called the punishment "rather severe and childish in some ways." 
Jackson said he thought a fine would have been appropri­ate and that the fans would be penalized by not being able to see O'Neal in the Lakers' lone trip to Indianapolis 
"The league is known for its vindictiveness," Jackson said. "But we didn't anticipate a sus­pension." 
O'Neal scored a season-high 36 points against the Raptors in his third game back after missing 12 because of a strained right calf, but was angered by the officiating. 
He made that clear in his postgame interview on KCAL­TV -conducted almost imme­diately after the game. 
"My message to [commission­er] David Stern is get some people in there that under­stand the game and don't try to take over the ... game because people pay good money to see good athletes play," O'Neal said. 
When reminded he was on live TV, O'Neal responded with another profanity before the interview continued. 
"My comments were made out of frustration in the heat of the moment," O'Neal said in the statement released Monday by the Lakers. "But I realize that my choice of words was inappropriate and again, I would like to apologize." 
The game in Indiana was the second of a seven-game road trip for the Lakers, who played without injured stars Kobe 
Bryant and Karl Malone,  as  
well as O'Neal.  
Jackson said "there was  no  

precedence" for the suspen­sion, but that the team will accept it and move on. 
General manager Mitch Kupchak informed Jackson of the news hours after the team was game-planning to get O'Neal the ball early and oft!Jn against the Pacers, Jackson said. 
"I didn't get any satisfaction from their reasoning," Jackson said. 
It was the latest in what has been a season full of injuries and drama for the Lakers. 
"There's never been anything like this in my tenure," Jackson said of the injuries and Bryant's legal troubles.

"Apparently, there was some sort of disagreement," Sanders said. "It took place very quick­ly." 
Neither Myers nor sports information director Randy Farley immediately returned telephone messages Monday night. 
While still at Indiana in March 2000, Knight was inves­tigated by the university after former player Neil Reed said the coach choked him at a practice in 1997. 
In May 2000, Knight was fined $30,000, suspended for three games and placed under a "zero-tolerance behavior poli­cy." 
In early September 2000, Knight was accused of grabbing a student by the arm, cursing and lecturing him about man­ners after the coach was addressed "Hey, Knight, what's up?" 
In September 2000, Knight was fired from Indiana for vio­lating the behavior policy. Indiana's president Myles Brand, now president of the NCAA, fired him for what Brand called a "pattern of unacceptable behavior." 
In late December, Knight went into a profanity-filled tirade after an ESPN reporter asked about his relationship with former player Steve Alford, who was also partici­pating in the interview. He later apologized for the incident. 
Texas Tech is 4-2 in the Big 12 Conference this season. The Red Raiders had been unbeaten in the league until last week, when they lost to Texas and Oklahoma State.

NCAA BASEBALL 
Former team manager becomes player for Stanford 
Matthews, from nearby 
Mountain View, didn't get on 
the field this past weekend dur­
ing his team's three-game 
sweep of Cal State Fullerton to 
start the season. 
He knows that will often be 
the case. But sitting on the 
bench sure beats the alterna­
tive. 
"I've got a ways to go," 
Matthews said. "I don't think 
I'm done yet. I've still got confi­
dence -maybe false confi­
dence -that I can help this 
team on the field." 
He certainly saw his share of frustrating times as he tried to prove he can do more than just carry bats from one hitting sta­tion to another. 
Matthews was a two-sport athlete at Los Altos High School, hitting .361 with two homers and 36 RBis in his two varsity baseball seasons. He led the team to its first playoff appearance in 15 years. In bas­ketball, he was an all-league selection three times. 
So, not making the Stanford team wasn't easy on his ego. Marquess offered him the job of manager because Matthews wanted to be involved in some capacity. 
"I was discouraged, but this has been my goal for a long time," he said. "I grew up in this area as a fan of Stanford baseball, and I decided to stick it out." 
He even grew up on campus. 
Matthews' mother, Tracy Schwartz. attended Stanford to get her master's degree in com­puter science when he was a boy. Matthews' father, Stephen, also has a Stanford degree. When MattheWs was about 8, they all lived in student hous­ing, within shouting distance of Sunken Diamond, the school's baseball stadium. 
"He just loved living there, and not just because of all the sports," his mom said. "He and my husband used to try to go to one match of each varsity sport. lie always looked at Stanford as being kind of a sec­ond home. We knew he kind of had a soft spot for it." 
Both his parents remember when their son called home with the news that he'd made the team. 

"We're especially proud that he has the stick-to-itivenss when it could have been dis­couraging," his mom said. "With various things, I'd say that's always been a character­istic of his." ·-­
Matthews is working toward a double major in economics and archaeology, so he stays plenty busy. Since he is a walk­on player, he doesn't have a baseball scholarship. IIe relies on financial aid and loans like most college students. 
"It's a mixed blessing," his dad said of baseball. "There are a lot of opportunities at Stanford that he has to pass on. He is interested in going to some archaeological digs and he's had to forego a number of opportunities. It's actually a choice between good things. 
"He used to get notes on his report cards that he was work­ing too hard on projects." 
His teammates don't doubt it. "He's a special guy," outfield­er Sam Fuld said. "You just don't see that very often. If you asked me two years ago if I thought he would be a member ·of the team, I would have said 
you are crazy." 

Associated Press 
STANFOHD, Calif. -For two years, Cameron Matthews hauled bats and helmets, raked second base during sliding drills. warmed up pitchers and shagged flies in batting practice -all the typical jobs of a team manager. 
Whenever Matthews had a moment to spare, he'd hustle to the cage for some swings or practice taking grounders. 
Stanford coach Mark Marquess noticed. So did 
Matthews' teammates, who have considered him a member of the roster all along. 
And now. Matthews gives new meaning to the term utilityman, as a full-fledged player for the Cardinal. 
"It's a great story," Marquess said. "I said at the end of the year, 'Do you want to try out?' He came out in the fall and was a player." 
Last summer, Matthews played on three different teams to improve his game-a men's team in San Francisco, another 
in San Jose and one at nearby 
De Anza College made up of 
collegiate players. There were 
doubleheaders both days of 
every weekend and scrimmages 
during the week, and practice, 
too, if his schedule allowed. He 
also found time to lift weights · at Stanford. His family barely saw him over the· break. 
Matthews believed all along 
he could play for the Cardinal, 
who have reached the College 
World Series a school-record 
five straight years. 

During fall ball, he hit .207 (6-for-29) with a home run and four RBis. He can play several positions and is listed as an infielder/outfielder. 
"I knew I could play at this level." said Matthews, who eats peanut butter and jelly sand­wiches as a game-day ritual. "I had the confidence building for a while. I'm glad I got the chance to show I could play." 
Pulling on the uniform as a player -the team manager wears the same gear -is a much better feeling.

"I think, obviously, we have  
to get to a new stadium even­ 
tually," Irsay said. "When you  
see old domes coming down, I  
think that is where it is head­ 
ed."  
The RCA Dome's seating  
capacity of 55,506 makes it  
the NFL's smallest stadium and  
it's the sixth-oldest facility  
among the AFC's 16 teams.  
Campbell said Indianapolis  
officials would discuss stadium  
plans in conjunction with  
other projects, such as an·  
expansion of the city's conven­ 
tion center.  
So far, though, Campbell said  
the city has not conducted any  
stadium studies or even deter­ 
mined possible building sites  
and that the city would not  
agree to a contra-ct without  
knowing the cost.  
"We're looking at everything  
-can we expand the conven­ 
tion center? -this is tough  
stuff," Campbell said.  
Either way, it's likely to be  
expensive.  
Campbell said the $10.6 mil­ 
lion figure was only a barome­ 
ter of what the city might owe

was likely to increase when

"That was one of the best

The Huskies (18-3, 6-1 Big

Okafor had his 14th double­

Belles topple Olivef77-69 
By STEVE COYER Sports Writer 
After seven straight losses against MIAA teams, the Belles needed an answer and fast. 
They finally put the question to rest. 
In a decisive 77-69 victory over Olivet College (7-13), the Belles (6-13) brought an end to their conference losing 

streak and received  a  timely  
confidence boost.  
The  Belles built  a  28-24  

halftime lead and played a consistent second half with an all-around team effort on their way to the win. 
When the starters for the Belles started to tire, the bench came through and con­tributed a total of 33 points. 
"The biggest positive to come out of our loss against Albion was the play of our bench," Bellina said. "The key is to get all 14 players on at the same time."

CLUB SPORTS 
No jump start after Michigan State win 
ByJOE HETTLER Sports Editor 

Twenty-seven days ago Notre Dame lost to Georgetown 76-73 to open up Big East play and d'ropped to an underachieving 7-6 and 0-1 in the Big East. 
With games against ranked foes such as Virginia Tech, Connecticut, Villanova, Miami and Boston College on the horizon, things were not going to get any easier for the Irish. But since then Notre Dame has rallied son. The Irish also have the most losses of any ranked team, but have been recognized for a strenuous schedule that has seen them post a 6­4 mark against top 25 opponents. 
That impressive record has also helped Notre Dame earn a No. 12 RPI rating. 
After Saturday's most recent victo­ry against a ranked foe, this time No. 23 Boston College, McGraw made a case for her team to be ranked. 
"I think we're a top 25 team," she 
said. "I think [the 
Boston College] win 
was very important for 
title. 

"1 give (the team] an A+ right now because I think if you looked at [our] schedule in the end of December and looked at what January was going to bring and to see six ranked teams on the sched­ule, and not a lot of easy games in between -every game was critical for us," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. 
Notre Dame (13-7, 6-2) is ranked No. 23 in the latest poll and ·it is the first time the Irish have appeared in a poll since the third week of the sea-Notre Dame's improved 
play are defense and 

mental toughness. The Irish lead the Big East in scoring defense, allowing just 50.2 points in league games.· The team has also played more physically and mentally focused down the stretch during close games. 
"I think this team has grown tremendously throughout this season, and certainly from last year [with its mental toughness]." McGraw said. "I

Special to The Observer 
Men's Volleyball 
The Notre Dame men's club volleyball team defeated rival Michigan State Friday in East Lansing, Mich. at the Michigan State Invitational. Backed by strong serving from Nico Lopez and Mike Toomey, the Irish dom­inated the Spartans in every aspect of the game. Notre Dame jumped out to a quick two games to none lead in the best-of-5 match with scores of 2 5-17 and 25-18. After dropping the third game, 25-21, the Irish finished the match with a convincing 25­15 win. 
Top performances came from setter Brad Weldon, the third starting Irish setter in three tournaments, and freshman middle Joe O'Connell who played in his frrst regular season match­es. 
The Irish opened Saturday with a disappointing loss to 
Michigan 25-19, 25-15, 25-23. This lull extended into the next match again Miami of Ohio. The Irish won the first game 25-22 before dropping two games, 25­17, 25-20. However, the Irish never blinked and rallied from an 11 point deficit to win the fourth game, 26-24. In a see­saw deciding fifth game, the Irish fell just short, 15-13 
The Irish will next take the courts in two weeks at the Ball State Invitational. Figure Skating 
The Notre Dame figure skating team competed in the U.S. Figure Skating Association's Midwestern sectional last week­end. The Irish placed fifth among five schools. 1\vo varsity powers, Michigan and Michigan State claimed the top two posi­tions, followed by Illinois and Wisconsin in a very strong field.
