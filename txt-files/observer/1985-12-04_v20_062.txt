Bishops urge synod to take stand on threat of nuclear war 
Associated Press 
VATICAN CITY -Canadian bis­hops yesterday urged an interna­tional assembly of bishops to take a stand on the threat of nuclear war and Third World debt, calling the issues two of "the most urgent problems ofour time." 
U.S. bishops attending the two­week synod promptly supported the Canadian initiative. 
"The future of the world hangs precariously on these two issue$," Bishop Bernard Hubert ofSaintJean­Longueuil, Quebec, president ofthe Canadian Bishops Conference, said in a written statement submitted to the synod. 
The statement said the synod should issue a message that affirms "the determination of Christians to take part in building a better world by confronting two of the most ur­gent problems ofour time ..." 
Hubert, who made the proposal on behalfofmore than 160 Canadian bishops, later told The Associated Press in a telephone interview, "The synod should convey a word ofhope to the world, and we can do so by expressing our shared preoccupa­tion over these two issues." 
Bishop james Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, told the AP he agreed it was "appropriate for the synod of bishops to express its con­cern about these issues." 
Young said, "Both are matters of great importance to the bishops of the United States as expressed in their 1983 collective pastoral letter on peace and in the pastoral letter on economic justice now scheduled for completionin November 1986." 
The 1983 document condemned first-strike usage ofnuclear weapons and demanded a halt to the growth ofsuperpower arsenals. 
A draft of the 1986 pastoral letter says U.S. foreign assistance should be geared to meet basic human needs and promote social and economic development rather than security interests alone. 
Pope John Paul II convened the 165-member extraordinary. synod to assess the impact of the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council, which fas­hioned far-reaching reforms in liturgy, ecumenism, church govern­ment and seminary education. 
Hubert suggested that the bis­hops' concern on the two issues be reflected in a pastoral message that will be issued at the end ofthe synod on Sunday. 
The message, addressed to all Cat-holies, is being drafted by a panel of five bishops. 
The pope has repeatedly called on the world community to work out measures to alleviate the "crushing debt burden" on Third World countries. 
He also has condemned the 
nuclear arms race, often warning of 
the dangers of"a nuclear holocaust." 
Before the Geneva arms limitation talks resumed earlier this year, the pope called on the United States and the Soviet Union to renounce "egoistic and ideological interests" for the successoftheir negotiations.

1970s were a dull time to grow up; decade's television shows prove it 
"Ttll the one day when the lady met thts fellow, 
And they knew that tt was much more than a bunch, 
That this group must somehowform a family; 
That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch." 
· Theme from "The Brady Bunch" 
Have you ever seen the television commercial for the 
record album that features theme songs from of old 
television programs? Ifyou haven't, keep an eye out for 
it. It's hilarious. 
It features a couple who would ordinarily be 
described as yuppies · but since that term has outlived 
its usefulnt:ss they would have to be called post-yuppies 
·· listening to this record and acting like idiots as the 
announcer recites the titles ofold television programs 
and fragments of the theme songs play in the back· 
ground. 
The problem is, however, 
that most of the songs are 
from programs which most 
college students today 
would recognize only as 
syndicated programs which 
were rerun on obscure 
channels at odd times ·· 
shows like "Green Acres," 
'r 
"Dragnet," "The Un­
touchables" or "Batman." 
It is humorous to watch 
the grown adults in the com­
mercial jump around like 
little children and scream in 
glee as the familiar theme 
from "The Andy Griffith 
Show" is played. But the 
commercial emphasizes 
something that is kindl of 
depressing: 
llte 1970s were a very boring decade to grow up 
during. 
Ofcourse, this statement applies to more than theme 
songs of television programs. The same conclusion can 
be reached by examining the music ofthe 1970s. 
Each decade seems to have had its definitive musical 
culture. In the 1950s the birth of rock and roll and an 
increase in the intluence of near-deity cultural heroes, 
such as Elvis Presley, marked an identifiable musical 
scene. 
In the 1960s, immediately recognizable are the British invasion, the "mods," and the psychedelic move· ments ·· and, ofcourse, the Beatles who were integral in defining all three. 
nie dawn ofthe 1980s brought a transition from the violence ofpunkdom to lrhe ascetic techno-pop of new wave. Now, in the middle of the decade, a common middle ground seems to have been found, as evidenced by the rising popularity of Madonna, Prince and Duran

Duran. The degree ofability and talent in these artists is irrelevent. Rather, they all can be readily identifiable as music of the 1 960s. 
In the 1970s, such an identification could not be found. Trends in music were fast and furious, and conse­quently without substance. First, the holdovers from the late 1960s, which included such artists as Led Zep­plin and Neal Young, put record albums out with the a sound suspiciously like that ofthe preceeding decade. 
These artists eventually gave way to a kind oi pure pop music that didn't do anybody any good, as defined \)v such groups as Paul McCartney and Wings· and Kiss. This gave birth to a rise in disco. Ha ha. Disco developed into a new popularity in country music. Then the punk music of England crossed the Atlantic and became toned-down in the form of approachable new wave. What a mess! 
This undefinability was not excusively confined to music. The same
.. 
phenomenon is apparent in other facets of popular culture ·· such as television programs. 
The 1960s gave us "The Ed Sullivan Show," "The Andy Griffith Show," and "The Dick Van Dyke Show." Creators back then had a problem with titles, I guess. 
The 1980s mean "Miami Vice." The 1970s? Can anyone name one program from the 1970s? W~ there television in the 1970s? 
Well, maybe "Saturday Night Live." But it is interest· ing that the only program that could possibly be iden­tified with the 1970s was centered on satire of American culture. 
Several factors can account for the confusion in popular culture of the 1970s that made the decade a boring time to grow up. Politically, the country was not very stable. The U.S. was just coming out of the bad dream ofVIetNam. Liberalism was thriving even under the squelching influence of conservatism, which was losing its credibility. The U.S. was one confused place. 
So when those of us who grew up during the 1970s come to be the ruling class and everything falls apart, don't blame us. We're all just victims of our environ­ment.

Afghanistan accused of mass civllian killings 


As!loclated Press 
UNITED NATIONS-A special U.N. investigator introduced a report Monday accusing Afghanistan of mass killings of civilians and per­secution of political opponents. The Afghan ambassador called it "cheap lies and fabrications." 
Felix Ermacora of Austria, as­signed to report on Afghanistan by the U.N. commission on Human Rights, presented the conclusions, unusually strong by U.N. standards, to the General Assembly's social committee. 
Ermacora said he was convinced "that I have obtained quite an ac­curate picture of the situation of human rights in Afghanistan." 
He said the government, in trying to modernize the country, is meeting resistance from Islamic fun­damentalists and traditionalists. 
"The government has tried to overcome this with all available ofbuses in Alabama.

SpeciaJ to The Observer 

Saint Mal)·s juniors who have 
strong liberal arts backgrounds are 
being sought by the University of 
Chicago for its Early MBA Program, 
according to Gail Mandell, chairman 
ofthe humanistic studies program at 
Saint Mary's. 
"Saint Mary's, one of15liberal arts 
colleges nationwide chosen to par­
ticipate in this program, is the only 
Catholic and the only women's col­
lege to be selected," said Mandell. 
Last year a committee of four, chaired by Mandell, selected two juniors from Saint Mary's to par­ticipate in the Early MBA Program. The three-year-experimental program allows selected colleges from across the nation to choose two of their best students to take a maximum of three courses, tuition free during the summer before their senior year on the-campus of the Unl\t:rsity of ':hicago.

He added that he feared that America has returned to the indif­ference of the 1950s and that a "spark is needed to bring us out of complacency." 
West encouraged people to make a commitment to social change and become aware of the problems ofminorities today. 
"There are many avenues for change," he said. "Mrs. Parks showed us a quiet one. That's why we're quietly remembering her today. 
"It takes courage for you to go beyond signing a petition. Sometimes you have to stand quietly and sometimes you have to open your mouth and say someth­ing." 
After West's speach the crowd 
sang "lift Every Voice and Sing" 
and "We Shall Overcome." 
Beauchamp ended the ceremony with a prayer in memory of Parks' courage and defiance.

participated in the program last 
year. Stathis, a communication and 
government major, and Kehl, a 
mathematics major, both agreed 
that this was a great opportunity for 
them. 
Stathis lived and worked at home while Kehl lived on campus. "Not only did the university give us a warm welcome," said Stathis. "They also kept in touch with us on a regular basis. I never felt alone." 
Stathis added that the program 
was intense and competitive but 
nonetheless a great experience. 
After graduation, Stathis said she

West encouraged those present to attend the two other scheduled events during the week. The Social Justice Forum will sponsor a dis­cussion of landmark civil rights decisions in the Law Building tomorrow night at 7 and an open discussion will be held in the LaFortune Student Center Fridayat 7p.m. 
Auls said both events are open to everyone. West said he hoped that any perceptions of minority problems would be aired at the in­formal discussion on Friday. 
"Faculty and clergy will be present and we would like stu­dents with experience and a lack of experience (with minority '1roblems) to come," said West. 
In addition to the three business 
courses, each student took a

Truck driver among 22. heroes cited for courageous deeds. 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH -A truck driver who was one of 22 people honored Monday for heroism says he let a fel­low trucker who los~ his brakes on a treacherous mountain road ram into his truck because the man "didn't have much of a chance" otherwise. 
"I figured we could both jump if we had ro," LouisJoseph Gallant said Monday. "At the time, itwas the only thing I could think of doing. We didn't have much time to decide." 
Gallant's bravery made him one of 1 3 Americans and nine Canadians honored Monday by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission. 
Six ofthe heroes died during their heroic deeds, and one award was granted anonymously to an American who wanted no publicity, said commission Assistant Secretary Walter Rutkowski. 
Each hero or hero's survivor received 52,500 and the Carnegie Medal. The Pittsburgh-based com­mission has cited 6,955 people since industrialist Andrew Carnegie founded it in 1904 to honor heroism in the United States and Canada. 
Gallant, 29, of Wellington, Prince Edward Island, was inching down Nova Scotia's Kelly Mountain onJan. 14, 1984, well ahead of fellow trucker john Waite, 28. Both are 

drivers for Midland Transport Ltd. of 
Moncton, New Brunswick. 
With his citizens band radio, 
Waite called for Gallant's help when 
he suddenly lost his brakes. 
"If I didn't let him run into the back of me, he would have had to jump and he would have been killed. So, I just told him to run into the back ofmy trailer," Gallant said. 
Gallant increased his speed from approximately 20 mph to ap­proximately 50 mph on the twisting downgrade before Waite's rig slammed into his trailer. Gallant then hit the brakes hard. 
"We slid down the mountain with my brakes locked, about a half mile altogether," Gallant said. "We finally came to a stop only about I,OOO feet in front of a horseshoer, I80-degree turn we normally take at about about I5." 
Gallant was uninjured and his trailer was barely scratched. Waite suffered a minor injury and his cab sustained approximately 56,000 in damage, Gallant said. 
Other winners identified by the commission included: 
Jean Louis Bertrand, 32, a store owner from Louis Creek, British Columbia who was burned while saving a 28-year-old man from a bur­ning pickup truck in Kamploops, British Columbia, on Aug. 26, 1984.

Danger of accidental nuclear war is increasing 
The American and Soviet people in­cinerated in a holocaust caused by computer error? It is on the verge ofhappening. Because of the total devastation that would be caused by a nuclear war, there is a tendency to believe that there are powerful incentives working against the conscious initiation of such a holocaust. According to a growing number of expert observers, however, the nuclear arms race is now reaching a point where the factor of human deliberation will no longer play an important role in this process. As this process becomes more automated, the danger of an unintended, ac­cidental nuclear war is increasing dramati­cally. 
Bill Mewes and Gary Houser 
guest column 
In the 1950s it would have taken 12 hours 
to deliver a nuclear warhead by plane. With 
nuclear weapons stationed ncar the target, 
this time has been reduced to 8 to 10 minutes, 
and accuracy has been improved from miles 
to a 100 feet. As a result of increasing speed 
and accuracy, each side's forces are becoming 
vulnerable to a lightening-quick first strike at­
tack. This has moved each side to rely more 
upon computerized early warning systems. 

Seeming inexplicable, inconsistent and un­predictable human "goofs" account for 50 to 70 percent of all failures of major weapons and space vehicles, according to Uoyd Dumas writing in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. The condlrions under which many weapons personnel work are monotonous, isolated and extremely stressful. Working under such con­ditions reduces the reliability and quality of performance and increases withdrawal and psychological instability. 
Statistics released by the U.S. Air Force covering 1977 to 1983 show that over 17,000 emergency action conferences were held be­cause offalse or unknown readings in our war­ning system. More serious false alarms have increased every year, going from 43 in 1977 to 255 in 1983. Such information is no longer released to the public. One such incident oc­curred on June 3, 1980, when a $.46 com­puter chip malfunctioned in the NORAD warning system and signalled that missiles from Soviet submarines in the Atlantic were attacking the United States. This alarm caused 76 B-52 bomber crews to board their planes 
and start their engines, 240 missile launch ot: ficers to go on alert in their bunkers, and lasted 3 minutes and 12 se·conds before the malfunction was located. 
The military term for an accident that oc­curs during the handling of nuclear weapons is "broken arrow." The Defense Department has released information confirming the oc­curence of 32 such broken arrows in the period from 1950 to 1980. One example oc­curred on Jan. 24, 1961. Two 24-megaton atomic bombs separated from the wing of a B-52 bomber as it was flying over Goldsboro, North Carolina. One bomb's parachute came open and it glided down to a soft landing. The other bomb fell freely and hit the ground with full impact. It was discoverc:d later that five of the bomb's six safety devicc:s had failed. 
Dr. Brian Crissey, formc:r Pentagon com­puter modeler, recently completed a prominent study, "Launching Policies and the Threat of Unintentional Nuclear War." He simulates several attack scenarios to determine how much time would be available before £he perceived "use them or lose them" point would be reached. He then applies this information to data on both current false alarm rates and the historical frequency ofsu­perpower crises. He assumes that in a crisis both sides will go into higher states of alert. His computer studies show that in these cir­cumst~lnces, an accidental launch can be ex­pected no later than 1990. That is within 5 
years. 
It is only quite recently that the subject of accidental nuclear war has started to become the focus ofserious study. All studies that have been completed so far are in agreement that the danger of accidental nuclear war is in­creasing. 

A U.S./Soviet nuclear weapons freeze would prevent further testing, production and deployment, thus reducing fears as well as even greater dependence upon computers controlling nuclear response. The sooner we stop the nuclear arms race, the safer we become. "Star Wars" would be a step forward in computerization and in the arms race, thus making our world much more dangerous. 
As interest in and concern about this issue grow, more studies are being initiated and more informational resources are becoming available. A newsletter has been started to keep interested people updated. 
Brother Bill Mewes, a Notre Dame graduate student, co-authored this with Gary Houser.

to write and tests to study for. But stop and 
think for a moment. What is really happening 
around you? I am not talking about the im­
mediate environs of the beautiful island we 
call Notre Dame. I am talking about the world. 
I am not condemning anyone for not taking an active interest in the affairs of the world. I am afraid I too would probably let myself get wrapped up in the pressures of academic life at Notre Dame, ifI were tht:re. But I'm not. 
Sure I miss Notre Dame. I miss my friends, dorm life, the football games and yes, even the food. But I also feel I am extremely lucky to have been placed in this alien environment. From here I have been forced to open my eyes to the world around me. How much more alive, how much more real the world becomes when you actually see, meet and speak with the inhabitants of those countries that always seemed so far away. 
The world takes on a whole new aspect. It gets sharper and you can see the details. The characters in the stories on the news take on names and personalities. I have spoken with people from Germany, England, Ireland, France and Japan. They too have opinions on world events. They have to because they are usually directly involved. I have found that Europeans are generally more interested in and knowledgable of world events than the average American. Of course, we have a.n excuse, but I find it to be a lame one. 
The countries of Europe are dependant on each other. They are so closely related, geographically and economically, that they must keep on top of the activities that occur within their neighbors' borders because many will inevitably affect them. America, on the ot­her hand, could just as well be an island. Sure, we have had our problems with Cuba and Mexico. And the Soviet Union is always giving us headaches. But how many of us watch the news each night? Or read a paper? We feel no immediate threats to our nation and therefore feel no need to know what is happening el­sewhere. 
But last summer, West Germany had problems with major spy infiltration by East Germany. The admission of Spain and Por­tugal into the European Economic Com­munity in January could cause serious problems for the wine producers of France and Italy. Meanwhile, at Notre Dame, the foot· ball team is looking better, but what are we going to do about Faust? Somehow the em­phasis I see put on sports and academics seems almost absurd in light ofworld events. 
I am not saying to drop your books and call Reagan and discuss the results of the Geneva Summit. We are attending Notre Dame to learn about our chosen fields. But I do· not think !<earning should come from books and labs only. One learns so much more about life and relationships by discussing the news, by paying attention to the world around you. Where else but on a college campus are we going to be able to discuss the things that con­cern us with so many people our own age? 
What I am suggesting is read a paper and get mad. Give a name to one ofthose unidentified 
Garry Trudeau 

guerilla sources in Afghanistan (located bet­ween the Soviet Union and India). Imagine what his (or her) daily life is like; what his friends and family are going through. The news is no longer just news. It becomes what it is -reality. 
Unfortunately, sometimes reading about the world that way tends to make one feel a bit overwhelmed. What on earth can I do about human rights' violations in Indonesia? Honestly, probably not a whole lot. There is no way one person can topple a crooked regime or feed all the starving. But we are not totally helpless. There are sources of power we have access to -organizations such as Am· nesty International and UNICEF and yes, even our government. We live in a democracy, remember? We can write to those senators and representatives that we elected. It is their job to find out what their constituents have on their minds. We can be informed of world events and at least have compassion and un­derstanding for what our brothers and sisters are going through. 
I consider myself lucky to have been born an American. We have more opportunities and abundances than anywhere else in the world. I have come to appreciate the general ease of life in America that I had before taken for granted. But even more importantly, I have opened my mind and eyes to the rest of humanity.

Points about Vatican II held no factual basis 
DearEditor: 
After three months at Notre Dame, I have finally been compelled to reply to the closed­minded ignorance and sexism of Rich Coglianese's article ofNov. 25. 
In the article to which I am referring, 
Coglianese told how fuolish the reforms of 
Vatican II really are. He spoke ofthe traditions 
that this council had destroyed and expressed

hope that Pope John Paul II's "extraordinary synod" would "reverse the dangerous momentum." 
Are you even old enough to remember a Latin Mass, Coglianese? Then how do you know itwas "beautiful Church tradition"? You proposed that people will go to Mass if they want to, regardless ofthe language. So, saying Mass in the vernacular cannot decrease atten­dance and only makes the Mass more relevant to the participants. 
You made another point that has no factual basis. You must have looked for a long time to find the part of Vatican II that denied papal authority, because it is not there. The same is true of female presence in the priesthood. These are individual cases which were never advocated byVatican II. And, while we are on the sexist rampage, why do we not relegate 1 women to the second-class citizenship of I

ND dormitories missing unity of Greek system 
Dear Editor: 
After journeying to Penn State, I have found one thing that Notre Dame is desperately mis­sing: fraternities and sororities. 
When most people imagine fraternity and sorority life, they think of the Delta House, Mandy Pepperidge, and 1.2 GPAs. I have found, however, that frats and sororities are nothing of this sort. Fraternities and sororities would bring to our University many elements upperclassmen are currently seeking. Frats and sororities give its members their own sense offreedom, unity and independence. 
Fraternities and sororities could be set up similarly to the way off-campus housing is. At Penn State, one street called "Fraternity Row" 
He has decided not to take any ofhis money out of South Africa. Well, really, it is not his money. It belongs to the school. But that makes no difference to him. And that is a sign ofdedication. 
One reason he gave for not taking any ofhis money out of South Africa was that Saint Mary's is an educational institution and not a political institution. And I for one agree with this. Your school is very educational. For ex­ample, your school has seminars on South Africa. Maybe there would not be such semi­nars ifthe president takes money out ofSouth Africa. Students should be studying things rat­her than trying to change them. 
Think of it this way: if your school, and ot­hers like it, and other people, and companies, and banks, and so forth, all took their money out ofSouth Africa, apartheid might disappear. But then what would there be for you, the stu­

he anxious eyes ofthe world were once 
again focused on Notre Dame. Touching 
every alumni, subway alumni, and sports fan, 
a rare iitrain of Hoosier mania swept the 
nation. 
What single event could have had such an 
dramatic impact on the world media · the 
Geneva Summit? Apartheid? Another hostage 
crisis? The USC cheerleaders? No, Notre 
Dame has chosen a new head football coach. 
The best part ofall ofthe excitement was 
ofcourse the speculation before the decision 
was made. Rumors about who the new coach 
would be spread like an epidemic. 
The Athletic Department wouldn't talk, so the over-eager sports world ran away with any name they heard from anyone... "I just heard from the guy next door whose mother is the secretary to the guy who just installed the carpet in Don Shula's new house in South Bend..." Or "I just sawJohn Madden wearing a Notre Dame tie while he was walking in the University Park Mall..." After many predic­tions and much analysis by every armchair sportscaster, sportswriter, and quarterback in the nation, Notre Dame chose veteran coach Lou Holtz to replace to succeed Gerry Faust. 
But what about those candidates who were rejected for the job? While recently burrow­ing for food in the trash bins behind the ACC I discovered a super secret file ofprospectiv~ coaches. I attempted to sell my discovery to The Midnight National Inquiring Globe, but they said that it was real and refused to print it. So now I present this secret document to you, the wonderful Observer audience. 
DOUBLE SECRET MEMO 
Dear Gene, 

Regarding those new coach candidates, we might have some problems ifwe hire any of them. I'm sure that Lou Holtz, Dick Vermeil, and Terry Donahue are excellent coaches, but this time we have to get someone who is universally popular to both the alumni and the students. I hear that ClayJunior High School has an incredible coach... Sorry, just kidding. Anyhow, I went ahead and screened about fifty candidates for the job. 
At first thought, I hoped that Woody Hayes could be lured out ofretirement. But, then I remembered th·at Notre Dame could not tolerate a coach who assaulted the visiting team members. Former olympic coach Bobby Knight also has the popularity to take the job. But he would probably rip out the bleachers and throw them at the referees. 
We could hire libya's Khadafy, then we 
could literally blow away our opponents. I 
also thought that Bha~an Rajneesh might 
make a good coach. Imagine the contribu­
tions that he could persuade the alumni to 
donate. Neither man, however, is catholic. 
Besides, it would be a pain to get them 
through immigration. 
Our ratilngs would skyrocket ifwe hired a 
professional wrestler like Hulk Hogan, The 
Iron Sheik, or Rowdy Roddy Piper. But then, 
I'm not sure ifbody-slammingour opponents 
would win games. 
We also offered the coaching position to 
Dick Addis, Bobby Rivers, Lee Iacocca, Lech 
Walesa, PopeJohn-Paul ll, Pee Wee Herman 
Bill the Cat, and Opus. But they all gracious!~ 
turned down the offer when they heard that 
Emil Hoffman had also been offered the job. 
On the basis ofoverall popularity, we asked Phil Collins to coach at Notre Dame. He also refused the bid, but he did offer to produce the marching band's next album, as long as he c:ould play all the drums. But ifwe want universal popularity among the sports fans ofthe nation, all we have to do is hire any USC cheerleader. 
So after much consideration, I present the two best choices to replace Gerry Faust : 
1 David Letterman -Think ofthe popularity among the students! He could insult the visiting teams with snappy lines while boosting our ratings. Paul Schaffer could come with him and take over as director ofthe marching band... We'd be unstoppable! 
2 The lite Beer All Stars-With all ofthose guys, we could change coaches every week. This rotation offamous ex-jocks would be certain to please everyone. Imagine Billy Martin throwing a tantrum on the sidelines. 
L.C. Greenwood could intimidate the referees by crushing beer cans with the palm ofhis hand. On the lighter side, some weeks we could have Rodney Dangerfield or Yakov Smirnoffcoach. They could drop one-liners while the student body chants "Less Filling ­Tastes Great." EvenJohn Madden could be slipped into the rotation. We could give him a colossal CBS chalkboard and let him ex­plain his plays to the home side. The variety and color of the lite Beer All Stars make them the optimal choice to replace Gerry Faust.

Epilogue: 
Obseroer News Brief, Dec. 13, 1985 
Notre Dame administrators discovered today that, due to a clerical error, alumnus Phil Donahue rather than UCLA coachTerry Donahue was hired as the new head football coach. Sensing a boost in his ratings, Phil Donahue has refused to void the fifteen year contract. At his first football press con­
ference, Donahue chose to cover the issues ofwomen priests, school censorship, and 'swinging couples. When a reporter from Sports Hlustrated questioned Donahue on his choice ofstarting quarterback, he was shouted down and pummeled by the middle· aged, housewife audience.

Miami coach Johnson gets wish as Hurricanes move to No. 2 in poll 
Associated Press 
CORAL GABLES, Fla.-Miami was accorded respect that Coach Jimmy Johnson felt was long overdue yes­terday when the Hurricanes vaulted to No. 2 in The Associated Press poll and within striking distance of their second national football champion­ship in three years. 
A critic of balloting in recent weeks because of his team's slow rise despite victories on the road over· Oklahoma, Florida State and Maryland, Johnson was ecstatic that the Hurricanes climbed from fourth in the next-to-last regular season poll. 
Miami has won 10 games in a row since losing its season opener to Florida and is traveling a path that is strikingly similar to the road it took to the national championship under Howard Schnellenberger two years 
ago. 
Schnellenberger's 1983 team also lost its opener to Florida, but rattled off 11 straight victories -including a triumph over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl -to claim the crown. The 1985 Hurricanes are headed for the Sugar Bowl and a showdown with Southeastern Conference champion Tennessee. 
"This team has made a lot of progress and has made steady im­provement throughout the season," said Johnson, who replaced Schnel­lenberger two months before the start of the 1984 campaign. "We're happy to have a high ranking. I think we're deserving of this ranking ... or higher." 
No. 1 Penn State, which com­pleted an 11-0 regular season a week earlier and will meet fourth-ranked Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, received 47 of 59 first-place votes and 1,164 ofa possible 1,180 points from a nationwide panel of sports writers and sportscasters. 
Miami received three first-place votes and 1,063 points to move past Iowa and Oklahoma, which had held · down the No. 2 and No. 3 spots a 
see poll, page 13 
week ago. Rose Bowl-bound Iowa collected three first-place ballots and 1,050 points, while Oklahoma dropped from third to fourth with five first-place votes and 1,048 points. 
The other first-place ballot went to Michigan, 9-1-1, which remained in fifth place with 935 points. 
The Hurricanes closed the regular season with a 58:7 mauling of Notre Dame last Saturday. In the aftermath, Johnson pushed aside suggestions that he tried to run up the score to impress pollsters, saying: "I couldn't ask our second-and third-stringers to not do their best." 
Smith attributes the Hurricanes'

From an Editorial of March 28, 1985 
"Best Idea Since Keynes.'' In what may be the most important contribution to economic thought since John Maynard Keynes's General Theory, Martin Weitzman, an M.I.T. economist, suggests an elegt~nt way to br~ak the link between employment and the business cycle. He set out hlS plan in a readable little b?ok called "The Share £c6nomy." The core of.his 1 dea is SOJnet~l ng 11 ke profit-sharing: to change our system of f1xed wages to one 1n which workers' incomes are detet"lnfned by company perfo~ance. Most workers are paid according to contracts. From the employers perspective, how much they're paid depends almost entirely on how many hours times the hourly rate. If the cost of extra h~urs is less than the extra revenues the work would yield, the employer h1res more ~eople. If workers insist on higher wages or sales fall, they get la1~ off. Professor Weitzman asks us to imagine a different pattern. Po1nt one: Suppose that labor. instead of negotiating for so 
many dollars an hour, negotiated for a share of company revenues. Point two: Suppose the agreement leaves the employer free to hire as many more workers as he wants. Attitudes toward hiring would be 
transformed. 


success to total team dedication and the development of quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who replaced Bernie Kosar when Kosar ga,ve up his final two years of college eligibility for the National Football League. 
Smith said he wasn't surprised the Hurricanes advanced two spots al· though neither Iowa or Oklahoma lost last weekend. "We feel like we were deserving to be ahead of both of them. This makes it right." 
Florida, 9-1-1 but barred from bowls because of NCAA probation, held onto sixth place with 903 points, followed by Nebraska, 9-2, which climbed from eighth to seventh with 779 points. 
Tennessee, which won the SEC 
title and a Sugar Bowl berth opposite 
Miami with a 30-0 shutout of Van­
derbilt, jumped from lOth to eighth. 
Brigham Young, 10-2, and Air Force, 
11-1, round out the Top Ten. 
The second ten consists of Texas A&M, LSU, Arkansas, UCLA, Alabama, Auburn, Ohio State, Florida State, Oklahoma State and unbeaten Bowling ~reen, which cracked the Top Twenty for the first timein 12 years. 
The Mid-American champions last appeared in the rankings in Septem­ber 1973 when the Falcons were tied for 20th for one week. Bowling Green will take an 11-0 record into the California Bowl against Fresno State.

Michigan takes over N·o. 2 in poll 
Assodatcd Press 
The first tipoff that Michigan might be moving up in The As· sociated Press college basketball poll came in the Tip-Off Classic, when the Wolverines knocked off second-ranked Georgia Tech. 
Yesterday, a nationwide panel of sports writers and broadcasters made it official, giving Michigan 12 first-place votes and 1,165 points · not enough to seriously threaten North Carolina's hold on first place · but enough to move the 4-0 Wol· verines up from third to second. 
In fact, the Stumbling Wrecks from Georgia Tech, who sat atop the preseason poll and slipped to second a week ago, are fifth this week following Saturday's nationally televised 49-44 loss to Michigan in Springfield, Mass., that put their record at 2-1. 
North Carolina, 5·0 and the win­ner of the Great Alaska Shootout last 

weekend, received 45 of a possible 63 first-place votes and 1,239 points.
. 

Duke also rode a tournament tri· 
umph norrhward in the rankings, 
receiving four first-place votes and 
1,1 12 points to jump from sixth to 
third. 

The Blue Devils won the in· 
augural Big Apple National Invila· 
tion Tournament last weekend in 
New York, defeating then-fifth­
ranked Kansas 92·86 for the title. 
And on Monday night, Duke, playing 
its second game in less than 24 hours 
and third in four days, routed East 
Carolina 98-66 to run its record to 
6-0. 

Syracuse, 3-0, remained fourrh in the poll with 1,054 points, followt·d by Georgia Tech with 910. Geor· getown, unbeaten in its first two games, received one first-place vote and 908 points for sixth, up two spots from a week ago. Kansas, 3·1, fell to seventh with 830 points. 
Oklahoma, 5·0, made a big jump 
from 12th to eighth place with 753 points. Kentucky and Notre Dame each moved up one notch . Ken· tucky, 3·0, to ninth with 693 points and Notre Dame, 2-0, to I Oth with 636 points and the remaining first· place vote.

NVA interhall basketball teams get ready to start battle for '86 crown 
By MICHAEL KEEGAN 
Sports Writer 
Last night marked the beginning of the 1985-86 interhall basketball season. According to NVA organizer Blll Carswell, every hall produces strong teams that enhance the level ofcompetition. 
"Strong competition, especially in the A-League, is present year after year," said Carswell. "There are very few dominating teams. Blow out games hardly ever occur because of the level ofIntensity ofeach team." 
Paul Derment, captain of the Grace I team, also feels that the com· petltlve level of interhall basketball Is extremely strong. 
"The league consists of some of the best athletes on campus," said Derment. "Because of these players, the level of competition is initially strong. Most of these athletes take the games seriously because for many it will be their last chance to play organized basketball. The level of intensity generated throughout the league almost makes it the same caliber of basketball played at many small colleges." 

The A-League consists of three divisions: the A.C.C., the Big Sky, and the Big Ten. The regular season con· sists of either six or seven gamt's depending upon the size of each division. When the regular season ends in mid-February, the top two teams in each division will be placed into the playoffs. 
For the moment, Carswell believes that no teams can be predicted as favorites in each divi· sion. The Towers, Flanner Hall and Grace Hall, however, are perennial powerhouses. 
"We can't get a feel for the power· house teams until the end of the season," commented Carswell. "The season really does not get into swing until after break. With only two games before break, we can only see which teams might be strong and which may be weak. 
"As proved in previous years 
though, the Towers are always 
strong," continued Carswell. "Grace 
for instance comes out playing 

The last club sport to wind up its fall season is the 
Salling Club. The club just completed a lengthy 
schedule which had the team racing almost every 
weekend. The results were impressive as the team col· 
lected a second, three thirds, and a fourth. In addition, 
the Irish qualified for the national regatta at Chicago. 
"The: team this year was much Improved over last 
year," said Club President Dan Dressel. "We did a little 
better at each regatta." 
In order to claim a spot at the Chicago regatta, the 
Irish first had to race in a qualifying regatta at th~ Uni· 
verslty of Michigan. The team took third, the last 
qualifying spot. 
Then over Thanksgiving break the Sailing Club 
went to Chicago to take on a field which included 
coastal powerhouses Rhode Island, Harvard, Navy, 
and Southern Cal. The Irish, putting forth their best 
effort of the year, finished tenth. · 
"Rarely do midwest schools beat schools not from 
the midwest," noted Dressel. "We were third among 
midwest schools, but we ended up fenth when you 
include the seven schools not from the midwest." 
The Sailing Club began its season with its traditional trip to the East Coast. And as traditional this trip resulted in a killing, as Notre Dame finished 17th out of 18 teams at the Yale regatta. Actually this trip is a very important experience-gainer for the team. 
The club then held the Notre Dame regatta on Diamond Lake in Cassopolis, Michigan. In a field of 18, the Irish placed a strong second. 
Other regattas included third place showings at Iowa and Marquette, and a fourth at Michigan. The team also raced a three-man sloop at Detroit, placing sixth, and two single-man boats at Northwestern, finishing eigth and tenth. 

zones on defense while using 
numerous set plays on offense. Their 
organization leads to many wins." 
All of the games take place in the ACC gyms numbered one to four. The games consist offour 1 0-minute quarters of running time. Any overtime contest will be decided by a three minute overrimc period. 
An interesting development to this year's league will be whether or not varsity football players will be allowed to play. With Lou Holtz in· forming the players of 6 a.m. mor­ning workouts throughout the winter, there is doubt as to whether he will allow them to play interhall basketball. Carswell believes that many of the teams depend on these players to enhance their chances to win. 
"It will be interesting to see Ifthe varsity football players will be allowed to play," said Carswell. "With Holtz coming in to coach, new team rules, such as morning workouts, will be added. These rules could prevent the fo01tball players from playing during the interhall basketball season." 
D Sailing Club, novice crew units enjoy great success as season ends 
Pete Gegen 
Club Corner 


The club raced four boats throughout the season. 
The skipper-crew combinations for these boats were 
Dressel and Ann Wiedemann, Tony Fink and Sarah 
Hussey, Ted Ganely and Barb Blanchette. and Mark 
Ryan and Priscilla Karle. 
The team has a short spring season which st:u-ts in 
late March with the Notre Dame Freshman Regatta, 
and includes races at Toledo and Ohio State. 
Much like the varsity crew teams, the Rowi111g Club's men's 11nd women's novice teams have done very well "this fall. 
In a race against Michigan, the women placed four boats in the top six. The men raced well against stiff varsity competition, but did not place any boats in the finals. 
In late November the teams entered one boat each in the Frostbite Reggata at Philadelphia. According to women's novice coach Gretchen Pugliese, the women gave the best performance over by a novice women's boat by winning a gold medal in their heat. And the men also raced well, placing fifth in their heat. The overall results are not yet available.

"I didn't have an opportunity to 
get the shots I wanted and to do 
what I wanted," said Rivers. 
"(Winston Morgan's) defense was 
good. There were things I didn't do 
because I couldn't." 
"We've worked really hard to get 
together out on the court and get 
things done together," said Knight. 
"I think It showed tonight." 
With that togetherness, the Hoosiers were able to defense an Irish Inside game that was expected to dominate the smaller Indiana squad. 
Of all the Irish frontline players, only Donald Royal V3 points) and Barlow (14 points) were able to score. 
In the rebounding department, where the Irish also were supposed to dominate, Notre Dame ended up with 31 to the Hoosier's 30. Indiana did a very good job keeping the Irish off the offensive board, often hol­ding them to one shot. 
"We knew they were going to try 
and push the ball inside because of 
their size," said Hoosier freshman 
guard Ricky Calloway, who finished 
with 18 points. "So we concentrated 
on keeping the ball out of the post." 
"Our scoring game inside broke down," said Phelps. "They did a good job against us. We have to have the inside game to be successful and tonight it was a negative for us.

Knight agreed with his couoter­part's assessment, adding that he ~a'> pleased with his team's work in the rebounding area. 
"We knew Notre Dame was a good rebounding team," he said. "We had to come close to neutraliz­ing that and we did, I thought. 
"I was really pleased with the way we played the game from the standpoint of doing what we were supposed to do." 
As for the Irish defense, it showed flashes of strength, but often came up lacking against the patient Hoosier offense.

Irish suffer first defeat of season as Alford sparks Indiana to 82-67 win 

ByJEFF BLUMB 
Sports Editor 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -Steve Al­ford considered the debt repaid. 
The Indiana point guard figured he owed Notre Dame something after being held to just four points in the 74-63 victory of the Irish last year at the ACC. 
Alford's 32 points, many ofwhich 
came on strong moves to the basket, 
keyed the. 19th-ranked Hoosiers to 
an 82-67 win over Notre Dame last 
night before 17,161 fans at Assembly 
Hall. 
"What happened last year was definitely in the back of our minds tonight," said Alford afterward. "Especially for me." 
Alfor'd got Indiana out to a quick 2-0 lead with a 1 5-foot jumper as the Hoosiers took early control of the game. That lead would grow to 18-9 by midway through the first half. 
Meanwhile, Notre Dame was struggling offensively, and things

Minnesc)ta officials decide Holtz will not coach Gopher's bowl game 
devote full time to his new head­
coaching position at Notre Dame. 
A three-member Minnesota 
search committee is looking for a 
new coach for the Gophers, and Giel 
said he is confident that a coach can 
be named before the bowl game. 
The athletic director said the uni­versity is grateful to Holtz for the job he has done in turning the Min­nesota football program around during the past two years. 
The Gophers are scheduled to play Clemson in Shreveport, La., Dec. 21 and Holtz had been prepared to coach the game, said Eddie White, assistant sports in­formation director for Notre Dame. 
"We don't want people to 11tink we pirated away their coach," said White. "We were all ready to let him coach their game." 
Holtz was named to replace Notre Dame coach Gerry Faust, who resigned Nov. 26, three days after a loss to Louisiana State made him the losingest coach in Notre Dame his­tory. Holtz, head coach at Minnesota the past two seasons, was hired the next day. 
Holtz talked individually with Notre Dame football players and as­sistant coaches yesterday in his first hectic week as head coach in one of college football's most prestigious and high-pressure programs. 
"I want to establish a line ofcom­munication between me and the players," Holtz said. "I want to put their minds at ease as far as the future is concerned, especially going into final exams. That's priority number one. 
"Number two is recruiting. We're going into that very hard," he said. 
Holtz will find, as did Faust, that Notre Dame no longer has first shot at the best Catholic high school players in the country, according to another former coach, Dan Devine. 
"There's no longer the feeder sys­tem where a product of a Catholic High School automatically goes to Notre Dame," said Devine, who coached at South Bend from 1975­1980. 
"You've got to go out and fight for those kids," said Devine who was in

BLOOMINGTON, Ind.-In the end 
It seemed the game was decided by 
defense. 
The Notre Dame basketball team never was able to get Into the flow of last night's 82-67 loss against In­diana, and much ofthe credit for that has to go to the disciplined Hoosier defense of Head Coach Bob Knight. 
"They worked real hard at what they did and they executed very well," said Irish captain Ken Barlow. "Coach Knight prepared them well." 
It certainly seems that way. Despite the high score, the game never seemed to open up for Notre Dame's David Rivers and its big men Inside.

nice, but ifCBS is going to pay me money just to sit around

champion to us. How about you, Dan? ·
