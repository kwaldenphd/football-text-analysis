Calendar change possible 
by Ed Hoslnl Sta H Reporter 

September 8th is the unofficial date for classes to begin for the 1976-77 academic year, and it appears that there is a possibility to change the calendar for a pre­Labor Day start, according to Academic Commissioner, Mike Gassman. 
Gassman mentioned that the Academic Council that established the guidelines for the 1976-77 school year. may consider another calendar for next year. Since the 1976-77 calendar has not yet been ratified by St. Mary's, the proposed calendar is only ten­tative. Gassman added the date of the Charismatic Conference would probably be noted by the Academic Council but it would have no direct effect to the Council's decision. Gassman stated that "if the council changed the calendar, then the conference would have to be rescheduled." 
Gassman agreed that if a new 
Co-ed housing topic of SLC discussion 

by Eileen O'Grady 
Starr Reporter 

The SLC met yesterday mainly to discuss the matters of co-ed housing, academic honesty and off-campus community relations. 
John DiPietro, speaking for the Planning and Policy Community, stated his committee was presently working on two areas: co-ed housing and academic honesty. 
A co-ed housing sub-committee was formed following up the COUL report's recommendations as presented to the Board of Trustees a few weeks ago. Student SLC representative Ed Van Tassel was nemed chairman of this committ-Pe. 
DiPietro said the sub-committee has three main objectives. "First an empirical study would be <·onducted to determine the type of interest and response a co-ed living ~;itualion would generate among 
students," he stated.

r Next, this infqrmation would be evaluated by university members. "The committee would also compare co-ed progams in effect at other universities and colleges," DiPietro added. Finally, the. committee would formulate alternative plans for implementing co-ed housing at Notre Dame. Anyone wishing to make suggestions or give their opinions about co-ed housing at Notre Dame should call Van Tassel at 3313.

calendar was introduced, there things that are floating in the air 
would be a definite possibility that it would provide for a mid­semester vacation. "The academic affairs of the university come first, and the conferences come second," he stated. 
Since the Notre Dame Academic \Council had decided last year that subsequent school years would 
have a post-Labor Day start, the National Men's Shepherds Con­ference (Charismatic Renewal> was scheduled for Aug. 24-28, 1976. The 10,000-13,000 members ex­pected for the conference will require campus facilities, in­cluding the university's dor­mitories. 
Mr. Richard A. Emge, Asst. Director of the Center for Con­tinuing Education, said that he and others were in the process of determining whether the Charismatic Conference would be held at an earlier date. Emge stated a definite date for the conference should be decided on by the end of this month; "Some 
DiPietro also outlined the Planning and Policy Committee's report on academic honesty. The committee intends to distribute a campus-wide "communique" stating their policies. 
"We wish to re-emphasize the ideal that the very essence of an academic institution seems to include, as a root principle, a high regard for personal honesty and integrity," DiPietro stated. 
He also added that academic honesty and integrity must come from thewhole community. "The life ol honor at Notre Dame must be an indivisible, shared responsibility," he said. 
Doug Stephenson, speaking for the Off-Campus and Community Relations Committee, enumerated their plan to integrate off-campus students more in the community. 
"We want to establish lines of communiation between neigh­borhood group leaders and students in their area," Stephenson said. "We would be using boundaries of neighborhood 
groups as boundaries for our purposes. In areas where there are no boundaries, we will create them," he added. 
"The plan will make students aware that they do have neighbors and it is also a way for people in the community to contact us," he described. 
"I can think of nothing but good that will come out of it," Stephenson added. 
Fr. Tom Tallarida, Director of Off-Campus Housing, presents the Proprietor's Manual which his office has drawn up. The manual, designed to aid landlords, Is available from the Student Affairs Office, room 315 of the Main Building. (Photo by Paul Clevenger) should be settled by Nov. 24th." 
Both the conference and regular classes could not possibly function simultaneously. Mr. Emge commented the conference would necessitate the use of such buildings as the ACC, Stephan Center, O'Shaughnessy Hall, the Engineering Building, Washington Hall and LaFortune Student Center. 
As for accomodating guests, Mr. Emge added that in 1972, the 12,000 people attending the conference filled every university residence hall, dormitories at St. Mary's, Holy Cross FJr. College, Valparaiso University and all the motels in the South Bend area. 
Mr. John F. Plouff, Managing Director of the ACC, said he had no information at all as to whether the conference date could be changed. Plouff added all in­formation pertaining to the rescheduling of conventions would be known by the University Calendar Office first.

AFROTC students like program 
by Bob Mader Campus Editor 
Second in series 
Most of the students in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps like the way the program is structured and administered. 
However, a few have complained of being overworked. One junior engineering student said he'll ~e required to carry a 23-credlt course load. 
Course of Study 
Freshmen and sophomores take one credit courses dealing with Air Force history. Freshmen study the role of the Air Force, Air Force mission and doctrine, and the major air commands within the service. Sophomores delve into the history of air power and the impact of technology. 
Juniors take three hours courses on U.S. defense policy, strategy of national defense policy, and socialization into the Air Force and sources of Air Force officers. 
Seniors study management an" organizational theory. 
Cadet Commander Frederick Roggero described the freshman courses as being "A-B". Junior Government and International Studies major Christopher Stuhldreher said he doesn't feel overworked. 
On the other hand, junior Larry Merrington said he "feels like he's beating his head against the wall." Merrington will be requir~ to carry 23 hours next semester. "It's going to be rough," he said. "I have 19 now and I need four more like I need a hole in the head." Merrington said he feels his first priority is his education and he'll probably drop some of his staff duties with ROTC. 
Another junior engineering 

, major said the officers are overly demanding. "In the past it was Notre Dame first and Air Force second. Now it's the other way around," he said. He'll haveto take 21 hours next semester. "It's get­ting to be much more like the Air Force Academy," the student remarked. 
All of the instructors must have a master's degree and volunteer for ROTC duty, according to Captain George Finan. Also, the in­structors teach topics within their major field. 
"Harvard and Berkeley have just restarted their programs," Finan said, "so the instructors have to be good because they're under the gun to start with." 
Student-instructor relationships are good according to cadets. 
"I don't feel any friction," Merrington said. "I don't feel I have to play kiss up to an officer. They all put on their pants the same way you do." 
Roggero noted that the unit gets involved in community services projects such as Big Brothers and Sisters. The instructors also get involved, according to Roggero, resulting in a great deal of in­formal contact between officers and students.

Insight 
Tne unit has sufficiently mast­ered drill and will not drill again until Spring, Stuhldreher said. He stressed that drill is important.as a self-confidence builder and that all of the sophomores have some opportunity to lead their flights in drill. 
One junior flight commander said he'd like to have drill more than once a week, but have the second drill period consist of team sports. "They're getting out ol three periods of phys-ed a week anyway," he said, "and some of the guys are in bad shape. The informal contact would be good." 
The unit commander, Colonel Norman Muller, said that the Air Force in the past two years has been oriented to "people programs" and that drill and other activities serve to teach the cadets how to organize and work with people. 
Muller stated that during each drill period the sophomores have an opportunity to lead the flight, act as flight sergeant, and carry the guidon (banner) , with the responsibilities given to different sophomores at various times. 
Muller also mentioned different forms of leadership training and management skills in the program. The unit recently held a drill competition among the flights, capped by a formal dinner known as a "dining in". 
The "dining in" was organized by Stuhldreher. According· to Muller, the dinner and awards ceremony, attended by top University administrators, went off flawlessly, and he cited this as an example of management and organizatonal training . 
"It was an excellent managerial experience," Muller said, "not just a big party." 
Cadet officers must also plan and teach leadership courses for the underclassmen, Muller said. 
Air Force SNAFU 
The most serious complaint of the students lies not in the ROTC program but in the Air Force itself. Congress ordered the Air Force to reduce its manpower and the service is making a cut-back on the number of pilots it is training, according to Stuhldreher. 
Roggero said his class of 13 originally had slots for ten pilots; now the number has been reduced to five. As a result the students who joined Air Force ROTC with the intention of becoming pilots have a number of options. ---They may terminate their contract with the Air Force. Their only obligaton is to pay the University for tuition, books, and fees for the presentyearwhich the Air Force has paid. ---They may take what is known as the "Palace Option." The students receive their commission at graduation, serve 90 days active duty, and spend four years in the Air Force Reserve. ---They may recategorize. In other words, a pilot candidate would choose to enter the Air Force to be trained as a navigator or engineer or in some support capacity such as personnel.

Birsic elaborates on free ticket allocation system 
by Martha Fanning Staff Reporter 

Tom Birsic, Student Union Director, explained the com­plimentary ticket allocation system while speaking at the Hall President's Council meeting last night, in f<'isher. 
Birsic outlined this year's method as compared to last year's and explained alterations. 
''Last year Student Union produced their own concerts and distributed complimentary tickets liberally," he commented. 
He noted that when Student Union produces a concert it receives 200 complimentary tickets, 100 of which go to the ACC per contract agreement. Due to the loss of $20,000 last year through concerts, Student Union has co-sponsored 2 of the 3 concerts held this year. 
"The number of complimentary 
tickets for the Rod Stewert and 
Jethro Tull concert was 100 and 50 
went immediately to the ACC," 
Birsic remarked. "There is no set 
formula for passing out these 
tickets. This year it has been done 
on an ad-hoc basis," he added. 

Lists noting the recipients of the 
complimentary tickets are printed 
up two weeks prior to the concert. 
Birsic also commented on this 

vear's first Armory Party which 
he describedas "very successful". 
Responding to the possibility of future parties, he said it is not ·known if they will occur. 
"We ran that party without liability insurance oecause the insurance fell through four days before the party was scheduled," he said. Insurance plans are being 
looked into but the cost is a major 
factor. 
Birsic also mentioned other 

services and committees under the 
Student Union giving the HPC a 
clearer idea of the scope of that 
branch of Student Government. 
Other business included 

discussion on hall allotments. 
Denis Sullivan, chairman of the 
committee, .reouested that the 
halls submit their budget requests 
again with priorities assigned to 
items for which the money was 
requested.
A rough draft of the HPC Par­

ticipation Policy was passed out 
for consideration by the council 
during the week. The council will 
vote on the policy at a future 
meeting. The policy was designed 
in order to eliminate any misun­
derstandings arising from ac­
tivities jointly organized and 
sponsored by the HPC and Student 
Government and or Student Union.

Merrington credited the officers with being very honest as to the odds of the seniors in getting pilot training. 
Merrington pointed out a number of causes of the foul-up. One is the ending of the Vietnam
War which left the Air Force with 
an overabundance of personnel. Another is the high cost of fuel which has caused the Air Force to cut down on the number of planes it 
has in the air. Merrington estimat­ed that it will take the Air Force at least two years to get down to a stable level of personnel, but in the meantime saw difficulties in get-
ling people to join AFROTC because of the morale problems of the situation. 
Merrington pointed out that the Army also had to cut its personnel at the close of the Vietnam War. "All they did was close their eyes, take a pencil and start slashing," he said. The Air Force's reducton in force has been a much slower process, he sain

Attrition 

Roggero said the attrition rate for his class hass been around 60

A few are academically disqualified. "One went on academic suspension," Roggero said, "and the Army took him." 
Most of the students in the program are not career oriented, Roggero stated. He said that 
nearly 85 percent resign their commissions after their four-year obligation is over. Pilots have a five-year obligation after the completion of their training.

Nixon tax evasion conspirator 
By {'~JHIS J. IIAHPER 
Associated Press Writer 

CHICAGO <AP> -A federal jury began deliberations Tues­day in the case of literary ap­
praiser Ralph G. Newman, who 
is charged with lying to govern­ment officials in what may be one of the last of the Water­
gate-related trials.
Newman, 64, a noted ap­praiser of historical documents, is accused in an alleged 
scheme to allow former Presi­dent Richard M. Nixon to claim 
an illegal $450,000 tax deduction for donating his vice presiden­
tial papers to the National Ar­chives in Washington, D.C. 
Newman is charged with ly­ing on two separate occasions to Internal Revenue Service agents about his appraisal of the former president's docu­ments, which span Nixon's ten­ure from 1952 to 1960 as vice president. If convicted, New­man could face a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
In Tuesday's closing argu­ments before U.S. District 
Court Judge Frank J. McGarr, 
prosecutor Jay Horowitz con­tended that the defendant
played an important role in a scheme to backdate a deed to the Nixon papers and allow the 
former president to claim the 
deduction. The 600,000 items were deliv­ered March 27, 1969, for storage 
in the National Archives but 
were not actually donated until April 1970, said Horowitz, the head of the Watergate special 
prosecution team in the case. Such tax deductions weren't allowed after July 26, 1969, un­der the provisions of the Tax
Reform Act of 1969. 

Nixon claimed on his 1969 tax return that he donated the pa­pers and took a $450,000 deduc­lion, which the IRS later dis­allowed and ordered him to pay $271,000 in additional taxes. 
Horowitz sketched a scheme in which Nixon's tax lawyer Frank DeMarco and White House lawyer Edward L. Mar­gan conceived a plan to evade the new tax act. 
Newman and DeMarco were indicted in February. Charges

You can earn a commission while you earn your degree. 
And that doubles your vocational opportunities. You can pursue either a civilian career or serve as an officer. 
Either way, Army ROTC trains you for success. You learn valuable leadership and management skills which usually aren't offered by any courses. 
You make no commitment when you enroll in the Basic Course. You can ace it or flunk it. Or, you can drop it. That all depends upon you. 
But you owe it to yourself to look into Army ROTC. It might be your thing. At least it's worth checking into.

Job Hunting Hazards 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii pattie coone~ 
This column is dedicated to all seniors, past and present, especially liberal arts majors; it is a guide on how not to job hunt. 
My case is somewhat different from that of most job hunters, in that I am allergic towork and consequently never was terribly ambitious. My one guiding principle in life is: Never do today what can be done tomorrow, or the day after. After receiveing a D in typing two semesters in a row sophomore year, I knew I'd never make it as a secretary; luckily I didn't want to be one. However, the ability to type over 40 words a minute is essential in job hunting. It became obvious that since I had a mental block where typing was concerned that I had to find a job that I wouldn't have to typefor. 
Two days after graduation I started looking at Want Ads and actually wentout on couple of interviews. Right away I decided I didn't like job-hunting and spent the next few days at the beach, followed by five days of visiting friends in New Jersey and New York. When I returned to Chicago I copped out by working for the Park District in their summer day camp program. After five summers of day camp one becomes quite immune to th monsters one is in charge of, so it wasn't much of a challenge; no one ran away, no one beat me up, no one got lost at the zoo and they even lined up in twos. 
At the end of August I was unemployed again. The only thing I was doing on a steady basis was going to weddings. I 
went back to reading the Want Ads again. The day I finally found a job stands out in my mind because it was one of the worst days of my life. 
It was 86 out and the humidity was about the same and raining on and off. I had one interview at 8:45 on Jackson Blvd., the second one at 11:00 at the Chicago Motor Club for claims clerk. At the Motor Club I took a "filing" test which I finished in four minutes onlytobe informed: "Oh, my, you're a college graduate. This won't do. You'll never be happy here, standing on your feet all day, bending over all these files, filing all day long." So much for that job. 
On route (walking) to my third interview I happened to glance down at my feet, which were bleeding. None of my job manuals had ever prepared me for this .I managed to get hold of some bandaids, only to be kept waiting an hour, which made me 10 ruins. late for the next interview, which made me half an hour late for the last interview. 
The last interview was on the far North Side. It would have been easy to take the "L" but I wasn't sure if where I was go­ing was an "A" or "B" stop. After boarding the bus I learned that both the "A" and "B" stopped where I was going. Of course it was raining and I had to walk two blocks before reaching my destination. 
All the walking and running finally paid off even though I 
was half an hour late; they offered me a job. Maybe they felt sorry for me caught in the rain, out of breath and obviously crippled. So contrary to all the job guides that say be punc­tual, look your best, be yourself and don't be nervous, I was late, looked a wreck with an umbrella stuffed under one arm, a jacket with a scarf hanging out its pocket under the other arm, couldn't walk straight and talked about 80 words a second, to make up for lost time. However, there must be an easier way.

uenice sta!Jing faithful to the sea 

leo hansen 

Where the sand and sea are joined upon the western shores of the Adriatic Sea, there stands a statue of marble and stone ­a Venus figure, the Ocean's daughter, the mother of Romanticism. 
She is the lover of all who come to pay her homage, those attracted by her fic­tional ideals and dream-like personality, those who have minds that breathe, with hearts that imagine, with eyes that softly express emotion. 
She is an enigma: her beauty is her siiimplicity, her mystery. She is free, but is faithful in her marriage to the sea, which has lasted for more than a thousand years. 
Yet her beloved is her most destructive foe, though somehow she survives the flood waters, waiting in the lurks to (Tumble her base of stone, and for the rape of the virgin. Still the sea is peaceful and gentle in its demise, reflecting her bright colours and the shiny gold, the shadows, the forms, the beauty. 
The forms (once we unveil our metaphorical Venus l are simple but selective: the dome and bell tower of S. (;iorgio Maggiore blurred by an October haze, gondolas and their masters, barber poles along the Grand Canal, the Bridge of 

Sighs, or even the basillica. These are 
strictly Venetian; they have no other 
place. 

Upon the island of Torcello, the begin­
nings of Venice were founded in the 
seventh century. Once a prosperous 
community, it perished and eventually 
disappeared, leaving today only the 
remains of two churches and two palaces. 
Of Rialto (significantly the adolescence 
of Venice) a little more of the past can be 
distinguished. For hundreds of years, 
Hialto was one of the most prosperous 
towns in the entire world. In the fourteenth 
and fifteenth centuries, before de Gama 
rounded the Cape of Good Hope, the 
commercial centre here was the envy of 
the Hepublic. From here fleets were sent 
out to all corners of the Old World, making 
itself and the Republic rich and powerful. Left today are only the traces of former times: the Bridge, covered by shops (now mostly tourist type, rather than the wine, poultry and meat, and cheese dealers of days old l and boats lined up along the canal filled with fruits and vegetables. But gone are the vendors' songs ('I tengo a ruta nuevella e a va si ni co Ia addirosa'), the famous brothel houses, and the elegance. In truth, when news reached that the Portuguese had rounded Africa, the banks 
faileo and a century and a half of 
declination was to ensue. 

Next, everything focuses on the basillica 
and the Ducale palace. The first basillica 
was born in the ninth century as St. Mark's 
tomb was stolen from Alexandria, and 
brought to Venice. As Venice grew and 
became more prosperous, its basillica 
grew despite fires and flood. Piece by 
piece, gold and glitter mosaics covered the 
stone structure of the basillica, the five 
domes, along with the coloured mosaic 
floor and symmetrical marble patterns on 
the walls. 

Protesting the church, figuratively and 
literally from the waters of the rampaging 
lagoon, is the Doge's Palace, with its 
famous pinkish-orange decor facade. Time 
is warped here; all of Venetian history and 
ttadilion is present in one structure. The 
palace is linked in stone with the church, 
which seems lost now behind the cam­
panile. 

Behind the gothic windows of the many 
palaces on the waterfronts about the city, 
there remains the spirits of an age past, 
and visions of splendour: young ladies 
dressed in white gowns, and men in dark 
suits with ribbon-tie and homburg, music, 
dance, festivity. And in the canals and streets below the 'Oh' cries of the gon­doliers and men pulling carts of goods over the steeped staired bridges. 



And in St. Mark's square, everything lives again, but only among the visitors and dreamers. The music is sentimental, the pigeons' motions bizarre, and the pairs of young lovers, cafe dwellers, and souvenir sellers all mingle together to compose the flavour, charm and magnetism of the Venetian experience. Perhaps this is the Venice that will be remembered when all is done, when the Old World is gone for good. 
Gone, too are the artists and poets who will live forever, side by side with the days of old: Igor Stravinsky, Robert Browning, Giovanni Bellini, whose bodies lay in Venetian soil. And Petrarch, Richard Wagner, John Ruskin, Dante, Goethe, Palladia, Lord Byron, Giorgione, Titian, and many others who have immortalized Venice in words, music and art. 
But now Venice stands alone, still faith­ful to the sea, whose intermittent plun­derings destroy a little bit more of a once solid relationship. Some of her stone has worn away and pigeons rest upon her weary shoulders as she poses many times over for artist and photographer. 





blessed be the peacebreakers 
We have a strong tradition of recognizing our heroes as women and men who have adjusted to adverse situations. There are those dramatic stories of per­sons who have bucked the odds of death, like that of the Andes survivors, breathtakingly chronicled in the runaway best-seller, A. live. We see examples all the time of persons who were marked by circumstances for tragedy, but who ad­justed to impossible conditions -no water supply, no food, no hope. They fought to live and they did. 
In his thought-provoking book, Uisturbers of the Peace, Colman McCarthy suggests a new type of hero -the woman or man who refuses to adjust. These persons differ from the classic heroes because the powers defied are not those of a wrathful snowstorm or a shif­ty sea, but the more dangerous forces that the rest of us, fearing rough body contact, learn little by little to go along with. This would include, for McCarthy, everything from great horrors like corporate irresponsibility, pollution of the land and government deception, to the small daily irks and gyps, such as ice cream con­taining fifty percent air, expensive shoes that come unsewn after a month, con­taminated meat, week-old cars already needing repairs of repairs. 
We have adjusted so well to all that goes on around us, McCarthy notes, that the abnormal has become the normal. The worst horror is not that tragedies are in­flicted upon us, but that we learn calmly to live with them, with hardly a fight. 
The fact the most people are docile sheep, or "good Germans," and adjust to horrors around them may be attributed to human flexibility, but maybe -just maybe -it's an adjustment to the sub-human. A new pattern of conformity is set, and in­sanity becomes sanity. Those who refuse to adjust are labelled insane. 

Rabbi Abraham Hesche! tells the story about a kingdom of long ago, where it happened that after the grain crop had been harvested and stored, it was discovered to be poison. Anyone who ate it went insane. The king and his advisers immediately took counsel as to what should be done. Clearly, not enough food was available from other sources to sustain the population. There was no choice but to eat the grain. "Very well," the king decided, "let us eat it. But at the same time, we must feed a few people on a different diet so there will be among us some at least who remember that we are insane." 
McCarthy writes about some "crazy" people, and they just may be the new heroes for our age, when so many conform to madness. We need reminders, like the character Alan Bates plays in King of Hearts, the film that captivated so many when it was shown on campus recently, who cause us to wonder if perhaps ad­justment is maladjustment and so-called sanity reaHy insane. 
McCarthy writes about mostly unknown 
people who quietly took stances of non­
compliance. They reached a point where 
they saw exactly the kinds of hell they 
were being led into by some corporate, 
political or social devil; and they said 
"No." They refused adjustment to some 
form of cheapness, guff, crime, grossness, 
or some kind of debasement in values that 
struck them as brazenly wrong. 
One of them, an upholsterer in New Hampshire whose child was tragically burned when his pajamas caught fire, refused to adjust to the horrifying fact that the textile industry, with the federal government's silent approval, continued to make clothing for other children that was highly flammable. 

That his own child was burned (twenty­five percent second and third degree burns) is tragic enough for Charles Virgine, but another horror is even more grim. He later found the same type of pajamas that burned his son still on sale at the same store. When Chuck investigated the situation of children's clothing that is higly flammable, he discovered to his amazement that three to five thousand deaths associated with flammable fabrics occur annually. Injuries are between one­hundred-fifty and two-hundred-fifty thousand. The highest risk groups are children and the elderly. 
All Chuck Virgine's efforts to get tougher government legislation met with frustration after frustration. The legislation was so weak that in a 1968 survey, the present tragically weak flammability standards were met by nightgowns and garments found on the corpses of nine burn victims, and on the bodies of seventy-four others who were injured. As a famous plastic surgeon said, "It's been known for a long time that children's clothing can be made flame resistant. The textile industry could do it anytime it1 wants. After all, the draperies and curtains in nightclubs are. That's regulated by the government. But for kids, nothing. It's economics, only economics. They're afraid of losing money." 
This is just one small example of the social sin most of us adjust to so easily; and the crazy people like Chuck Virgine are consigned to the lunatic fringe. He's a troublemaker, one of those· crusaders. He's crazy in his battle against the giantly powerful textile industry. Chuck put it this way: "You'd think that I was asking them to stop the machines and the mills. I've run into textile people and they act as if I'm out to destroy them. Naturally, they call me a communist; I'm destructive. And they're right -I'm destructive to fires. I have this strange hang-up of wanting to put them out, especially when kids are catching fire." 
But maybe it's not all for naught, after all. Perhaps people like Chuck Virgine preach to us a contemporary version of the same gospel first announced by Jesus; and maybe they give us some examples of how we might act for humanity's welfare (by considering involvement, for example, in a Public Interest Research Group like InPIRGl. 
Jesus turned the world upside down. He refused to conform to the patterns of his unjust, callous, insensitive society. He turned greatness on its head and said this was the only way it made sense. The madness of his gospel was the supreme sanity. "You want to be great, you want to rank first? Then do it just the opposite way you think it should be done. Ranking first means outdoing one another in concern, in service, in hospitality-just the opposite of what the world teaches you: competition, striving feverishly after personal gain." 
Jesus was crazy according to all stan­dards of getting ahead. He rejected power, might, wealth, dominance and force. He believed in making himself vulnerable to love and trust. Crazy? No, it just so hap­pens he was the leader of those who, like him, would be fed on that special diet (as in Rabbi Heschel's story), so that there would be among us at least some who remind us that we are insane if we are not 
"crazy" like them.  And  in  these crazy  
times,  we  may  need  all  the  crazy  
Christians we can get.

$12.4 billion in debts 
NYC's problems traced 
By I.EE MITGANG AP Business Writer 

NEW YORK <APl -A $26 
million entry in the New York 
City budget 11 years ago 
seemed out of place in the wil­
derness of numbers that total­
led $3.3 billion. 
Experts now say that small 
sum may have paved the way 
for the city's financial collapse 
II years later, as the nation's 
largest city now struggles to 
pay off $12.4 billion in debts 
and balance its budget. 
That $26 million was the first 
lime the city's politicians bor­
rowed money to pay for every­
day city expenses. 
In this case,former Mayor 
Hobert F. Wagner decided that 
rather than raise taxes or cut 
back on city services, he would 
take expense items -some 
consultant fees -and put them 
into the city's capital budget, 
which is financed by floating 
bonds and short-term notes. 
He was able to do this be­
cause in mid-1964, then-Gov. 
state legislature decided to al­
low the city to borrow money to 
pay for a variety of normal ex­
penses. 
The legal door was thus flung 
open for Wagner, former May­
or John V. Lindsay and Mayor 
Abraham D. Hearne to borrow 
for almost any expense item 
they pleased, while amassing a 
"hidden" budget deficit 
recently conceded by the 
Hearne administration at $3 bil­
lion. 
Expt>nsrs doublr 

In 1969 and 1970, Lindsay dou­bled current expense borrowing from $84 million to $151 million by switching manpower train­ing and job development from the expense budget to the capi­tal budget. 
In 1974, Hearne shifted $722 million in expense items to the capital budget. 
Last June, New York State Comptroller Arthur Levitt stud­ied the years when Lindsay was mayor and Hearne was comptroller, and found the city had used bonds to finance city salaries, library books, archi­tects fees, even interest on oth­er bonds. 
Most now expect the city's deficit financing of operating exrnses to top $1 billion in fis­ca 1975-76. 
"By borrowing to pay for op­erating expenses year after year, there develops a built-in, permanent need for more taxes, just to pay the interest on borrowings," Levitt said. 
The budget itself has quad­rupled in the past decade, from $3.3 billion in 1965 to a current $12.2 billion. 
Before Mayor Hearne was forced by the current fiscal crisis to lay off some 36,000 workers, the city's workforce had more than tripled from 103,000 in 1956 to 340,000 in mid­1975. 
Wages increase 

The floodgates for generous 
wage and pension benefits were 
opened by another Wagner de­
cision in 1958 to allow the city's 
workers the right to unionize as 
they wished. 
The unions first flexed their 
bargaining muscle in 1966, 
when city transit workers won 
a then-unheard of 15.7 per cent 
pay raise over two years after 
a crippling 12-day strike. 
Since then, the average tran­
sit worker's pay has gone from 
$7,222 a year to $15,125, up 109 
per cent, and some city unions 
have done even better. During 
this period the city's inflation 
rate has gone up 78.4 per cent. 
Over-all, a 1974 study by the Citizens Union Research Foun­dation showed that the city's pension costs had gone up more than 400 per cent in the past 10 years. Many workers can retire with at least half pay after 20 years of service, which is bet­ter on a percentage basis than terms offered almost anywhere else in the private or govern­ment sectors. 
A look at 10 years of city budgets by the Citizens Budget Commission shows that city pensions and salaries are not the whole story of New York City's fall towards default. 
Welfare times six 

Between 1965 and the present, welfare and social service costs have gone up six-fold to more than $2.4 billion. More than one million New Yorkers are on re­lief. New York foots a far larg­er share of its social services bill than any other large city, most of which have county and state help. 
Education costs, which in­clude a tuition-free college sys­tem even for wealthy students, have tripled to $2 billion. Since 1970, when open university en­rollment began, more than 19,­000 students were added, bring­ing the total to an estimated 270,800. 
The city's health costs, which include maintenance of 19 mu­nicipal hospitals, have likewise tripled to more than $1 billion. 
Other costs, including police and fire protection and environ­mental services, have also dou­bled and tripled in the past dec­ade. 
And debt service, the amount of budget money that goes to­ward paying off the city's bonds and notes, has gone from $470 million in 1965 to more than $1.8 billion -14 cents out of every city tax dollar. 
While costs have gone up, the city's corporate, personal and property taxes have not kept pace. 
Here, forces inside and out­side the city figure in, and they lie at the heart of the city's huge borrowing needs. 
Shirting populus 

New York City has ex­perienced great shifts of popu­lation since the 19th century, but the changes since World 
Wednesday, November 12, 197$ 
War II have been financially unfavorable. Prodded by feder­al government home mortgage guarantee and loan programs, the city's affluent moved to the suburbs in the 1950s to be joined by others fleeing crime and other urban ills through the 1960s. 
In the last decade nearly a million middle and upper­middle class New Yorkers have

left, replaced by a million of the nation's poor, many of whom became welfare cases. 
Along with the middle class, many businesses have left the city, taking with them an esti­mated 500,000 jobs in the past five years alone. Meanwhile, New York City's latest unem· ployment figures stand at 12.2 per cent, while the national rate is 8.6 per cent.

Japanese dog retires 
as team ball chaser 
KOMORO, Japan (AP) 
For four years, El, a male Box­
er dog, was the Tsukushi-Kai 
baseball team's ace ball cha­
ser, snaring foul flies behind 
home plate with his mouth and 
pumping his chunky legs to 
pursue foul balls outside the 
diamond. 
"El went after the ball like a 
pro," says his owner-coach, 
Masamitsu Sato, a company 
employe. "But he's getting old 
and we decided it was time he 
was retired." 
Last week the 8-year-old dog was honored at a ceremony by the Komoro Morning Baseball League, which awarded him a certificate and a large bag of bones. 
In his prime, Sato said, El thrilled fans by chasing foul balls like a seasoned ballplay­er. "He wasn't afraid to leap into the air, to climb over the fence or scamper about the wet grass." 
The Komoro Morning Basball League, made up of 38 amateur clubs, plays in the morning from May to October before the players report to their offices or factories, or open their shops in this small city about 90 miles northwest of Tokyo. 
"Although the league began as a means to keep us ama­teurs physically fit," Sato said, "many of us didn't relish trampling about the grass cov­ered with morning dew at 5:30 a.m." 
One day, Sato said, he no­ticed that El, a pedigreed Box­er for which he paid $660 eight years ago, showed interest in the game. 
"My original plan," Sato said, "was to have El help the boys train every morning doing road work." 
So Sato began teaching El to chase only foul balls in the out-

cases, but a neurologist who ex­But Dr. Julius Korein of New ami'led Miss Quinlan said the York University Medical Center ruling may set a harmful prec­said, "I'm afraid the decision is

going to make doctors afraid." 
"The care and treatment of a Dr. Korein, a leading neurolo­

patient and all decisions related thereto remain the responsi­bility of the treating physi­cian," said Dr. Max H. Parrott of Portland, Ore., president of the American Medical Associ­ation.

field and to stay off the dia­mond. El caught on and even­
tually became  an  attraction.  He  
also jumped for foul  tips  on  the  
third strike,  Sato said.  

"Of course," Sato added with a chuckle, "there were times when El got his signals crossed and he and the catcher would both dash for the foul ball be­hind home plate. There would be a tangle, usually with El c~ming out on top." 
year's 61, the previous high, and marks a steady increase from the 49 nations represented as the decade opened in 1970. 
The 308 students, an increase over last year's 302, showed a preference for the College of Arts and Letters for the first time. The majority in previous years leaned toward the College of Engineering. 
The 194 graduate and 114 un­dergraduate students include 82 in Arts and Letters, 78 in Engineering, 64 in Science, 50 in Business Administration, 32 in Freshman Year of Studies, and two in Law School. 
Taiwan, where Notre Dame recently opened a "year-abroad" program, dropped to third place in the number of students represented, after leading last year with 36 and the previous year with 45. The 27 students from Nationalist China are compared this year to India's 34 and Canada's 29. 
Freshmen, with 32 students. 
gical researcher who examined Miss Quinlan in October at her parents' request, said publicity surrounding the ruling would 
cause  many  doctors  to  continue  
hopeless  treatments.  
During  a  five-day  hearing  on  

the Quinlans' request, Korein said most doctors obey "an un­written law" in which treat­ment is denied when a case is beyond hope. 
Now, he said, when the same question arises, "doctors are going to be curtailed when it comes to turning something off. 
"The maintenance of an irre­versible vegetative state by ex­traordinary means is not equivalent to maintenance of life," Korein said. 
Doctors estimate Miss Quin­lan can be kept alive for more than a year by use of the res­pirator. 
It costt; $450 per day to keep Miss Quinlan alive. The state Medicaid system is paying the bill because she is 21, unem­ployed and without medical in­surance. It is estimated that since April Miss Quinlan has received care worth more than $120,000.

Gulf lobbyist admits delivering donations 
WASHINGTON <AP> -A former Gulf Oil Corp. lobbyist says he made a series of cross­country trips over a 14-year pe­riod to give politicians and Gulf officials sealed envelopes which contained cash in at least two instances. 
Frederick A. Myers told fed­eral investigators he made the deliveries under orders from Gulf's former top lobbyist, Claude C. Wild Jr., to public of­ficials or their aides in offices, airports, hotel rooms and wash­rooms and, in one case, behind a barn. 
He also said he made several trips each year to Capitol Hill to deliver sealed envelopes. Myers said he had no idea what the envelopes contained, except in two instances where he saw them opened and they con-
Myers said he neither asked about nor was told the purpose of delivering the envelopes. 
In a deposition with the Secu­rities and Exchange Commis­sion, Myers said recipients of the envelopes included: tained cash. 
Former Sen. Fred Harris, D­Okla., former Sen. Howard W. Cannon, D-Nev., and former Sen. D. Edwin Mechem, R­N.M., all in 1964; former Kan­sas Gov. William A very in 1966; former Indiana congress­man and current Veterans Ad­ministration head Richard L. Roudebush in 1970 and a "Mr. Farris," identified by Myers as a Gulf Oil district manager who

Prep team vital part of victory 
by Fred Herbst 

The names on the Notre Dame prep team's roster aren't familiar to most fans, but they're an essential ingredient in the success of the Irish football program. 
It's the responsibility of the prep squad to prepare thevarsityoffense and defense for whatever they may face from an upcoming opponent. The offensive prep team always runs theopponent's offense against thevarsitydefense during practice, while the defensiveprep team an opponent's defense against the varsityoffense. 
"When we stoppd Georgia Tech last Saturday," said Greg Blache, head JV coach, "the kids on the ofrensive prep team were just as responsible as Niehaus, Fry and the rest of them. The same is true of the defensive prep team, when the offense moves the ball they have a lot to do with it." 
While the varsity has the op­r)(lrtunity to execute what they practice on Saturday, the prep
-squad doesn't. "I get a lot of satisfaction from working with these guys," Blache said. "It's easy to practice when you know you'll play on Saturday. It's not that easy when you know you won't." Despite this, the prep squad continues to do its job. According to Blache the varsity has gone into every game totally prepared , thanks to the prep team. "It's tough for these guys to ~orne out here knowing they won't play in the upcoming game, but they realize that they're doing their part,"Blache said. "I have a great deal of pride in these guys, a lesser group of men would have 
quit long ago." 
There are a few incentives for 
players on the prep squad. By 
doing well on thf' prep squad, a 
player has a chance at being 
promoted to the varsity. Most of 
the players on the varsity team 
were at one time or another on the 
prep team. "No guy on the prep 
squad is satisfied," Blache noted, 
"and I won't have it an'' other 
way." · 
The prep squad also plays 
several games a year against JV 
teams from other schools. This 
season the team finished 
undefeated, rolling over four op­
ponent:, The prep squad had one 
game r ~maining with Michigan, 
but Blache cancelled it. "I'm fully 
aware that many people are 
second guessing me," he said, 
"and saying that I'm afraid of 
losing. But I'd much prefer them 
to second guess me, than to have to 
second guess myself when a player 
suffers a serious injury. I know 
who my football players are, and 
there's nothi!lg left for us to 
learn." He noted that it would be a 
different situation if the team was 
healthier. 
The double role, that of a separate team and 'hat of being a scrimage team for the varsity, presents problems. By working all week running an opponent's. offense and defense against the varsity, the prep squad has little time to practice their own offense and defense. , Consequently, the prep teain begins practice earlier than the varsity and remain after the varsity go in. 
The job of the prep team does have its personal rewards. "When you run a play all week and they 



Welch improving quickly 
by Mik~ Towle 

Steve Welch is quickly repudiating a theory concerning the transition from high school !eve} of athletic competition to the collegiate level. This theory assumes that the transition is too insurmountable a barrier for a freshman cross country runner to immediately overcome. After an, having to run five-six mile races ... would seem to require at least a year or two of gradual adjustment. You see, high school meets are usually held on courses only two­three miles in length and don't necessitate the physical endurace associated with the longer races in college. No great problem to Steve 
though, as he puts forth a simple philosophy: 
''There is a difference in that collegiate cross country requires you to run five-six miles at least at the same pace that you ran two­three miles in high school, I never saw half-mile hills like I have so far this year." 
Apparently, the Hannibal, Missouri native never met many other obstacles while in high sLhool, either, at least, not until his senior year. The sophomore sensation he was, Steve finished secon< · both the Missouri state crosse, ~rychampionship and the two m ·vent in track. He fell to third oss country a year later bd ,, ,anage towin both the stc..te, and two mile crowns. Luckil: 1e did so well his junior year, b( -.·ause there was to be no competition for him in his senior year at Hannibal High School. 
"I tore a hip muscle in the fall and then came down with ten­donitis in my left knee," Steve explains. "I was quite disap­pointed at the time and was unable to resume workouts until June this past summer." 
Early workouts consisted of daily, mile and a half runs and eventually saw Steve putting in weekly totals of 95 miles by the end of August. 
Now mid-November, the 
training has contunued to pay off .. dividends. Just recently, Notre 
Dame Coach Joe Piane elevated Welch to the number one position on the 1Irizh squad, and rightly so too. With captain Jim Hurt nur­sing a sore hip, Steve stepped into the top ranks by leading the Notre Dame contingent in each of their las-t four meets, including a 22nd place finish in the Notre Dame Invitational and an eighth place at Madison in the Wisconsin In­vitational. Such per­formances have been the trademark of the freshman throughout the autumn. In his first meet on September 13, he came in third in a double dual meet at P;Jrdue. Two weeks later, it was third again, this time at home against Michigan State, Don't be amazed though, because because Steve isn't. 
He says, '·f'm not surprised that I am running well this year. In every meet, I run a better race than I did in the previous meet. I consider myself a consistently, improving runner, not one that has up and down performances from meet to meet." 
Speaking of surprises, Notre Dame should not be overly sur­prised that Steve Welchdecided to enroll here, he was planning on coming here all along. He adds, "I chose Notre Dame not onlyfor its 
track-cross coutry program, but 


Irish regulars depend on the prep team to get them ready for the upcoming opponent. 
then you see the defense stop it on Saturday, you get a good feeling," said AI Bucci, prep team fullback. 
"Playing on the prep team (!oesn't really bother me," Bucci said. "I just like to play football. Besides, working against the varsity gives · you a chance to improve and maybe make the v~rsity ." 
"The big thing about being on the prep team is not being in­timidated by the varsity, you've got to go after them like you would anyone else," Bucci said . 
for the school itself. (Steve graduated first in a class of about 280 students). When you go to get a job afer college, it helps to have that diploma that says Notre Dame on it. Besides, I was influenced by their spirit and unificaton exhibited by the students when I visited some dorms last last year." 
Now that he is a student here, Steve should have no trouble maintaining that spirit because his Howard Hall roommate is Dave Benkert, a freshman half-miler who cameherefor similar reasons and puts forth an equal enthusiasm for the school. Steve gives an example of his own competitive spirit: 
"I came here hoping to quality for the NCAA championship in my freshman year and would like very much to reach All-American status before I graduate from here." 
This Saturday (the 15th), Welch will get the opportunity to realize his first goal when Notre Dame travels to Bloomington, Indiana for the NCAA district 4 qualifying meet. It could also be the day that Steve Welch completes the tran­sition from high school to college that is, if he hasn't done so already: 

The members of the prep team work as hard as any Notre Dame football player, but get few of the benefits. "The guys I've had this season have been exceptional people," Blache said. "They've helped me more than I've helped them in things like class, deter­mination and desire. They're always prepared, they maintain their academics and they 
never complain. They're a great tribute to Notre Dame football."
