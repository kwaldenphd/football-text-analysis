LBJ --No Come 
Despite what you might have read from other sources LBJ is not coming to Notre Dame to help celebrate the 125th anni­versery. 

One informed source said, "We talked to his secretary last night and he is canceling all engagements outside of Wash­ington five days before and five days after his daughter, Lynda Bird's, wedding." Her wedding will be the day after the sup­posed address here. 
Our source continued by say­ing that the announcement should never have been made. "They had no right to say what 
they did because engagements aren't confirmed til three weeks ahead of time as he doesn't al­ways know what'II come up next." 
Ten days after the Student Senate abolished the rule and a day after it ceased being inforc­ed, Rev. James Riehle, C.S.C., Dean of Students, formally abo­lished the coat-and-tie regula­tion. 
Fr. Riehle told the Senate Wednesday night that he had re­commended, upon student re­quest, abolition of the rule as early as October 8. The recom­mendation had gone to Fr. Hes­burgh, but no action had been

Students Needed To Watch 
A Student 

Gary Poils For Hatcher
Government Column 

·---~...................................._ 
Notre Dame students travel­tonight at 7:30 on the second organizers feel safety is not as­ing to Gary, Indiana, Tuesday floor of the Student Center. sured after dark in Gary. 
One of the most remarkable events in our memory was the meeting of the Student Senate of the University of Notre Dame du Lac at 6:30 last Wednesday in Room IC of the famous La Fortune Student Center. Guesting this year as master of ceremonies is Chris­topher J. Murphy Ill of the nation's capital, whose family is well known in those circles. 
The setting for the affair was as impressive as the campus itself. The University is the work of an architectural mastermind. Its buildings, of several architectural styles, are set off most pleasantly by the famous Sorin Ivy once·tended so carefully by Father Sorin himself. Perhaps most impressive of aiL though, is the La Fortune Center. the scene of last Wednesday's meeting. Boasting of such fa­cilities as the stunning Tom Dooley Room, the cozy Fiesta Lounge, and the spacious Murphy Ballroom, it was the perfect setting for the perfect evening. 
There was an air of out of this world elegance over all the pro­ceedings and everyone looked just spectacular in the new Senate look for 6 7-68. 
Christopher J. Murphy III himself, after much consultation, se­lected something standard from his abundant wardrobe: a stunning blue Gilbert's blazer with the Notre Dame monogram worked with a flair into the family coat of arms. 
Also an attention-getter during the evening was the senator from the lower east side, Mr. Donald Hynes. Always known for his devil­
may-care stance toward convention, Mr. Hynes on this occasion turned heads with a bright purple Carnaby shirt worn without tie or jacket. Later on in the evening, he donned a brown jacket of im­
ported wool but not until all in attendance had goggled at the string of beads he wore around his neck. Handcrafted and hand­painted, the beads were a source of constant attention and in some ways detracted from Mr. Murphy's program of amusements. The beads. according to Mr. Hynes, were on loan from the Vatican collection. 
Mr. Paul Higgins, known in Flossmoor, Illinois circles, seemed somewhat reluctant to engage in the festivities, no doubt for fear of getting sand in his coiffure. Others in Mr. Higgins' party were Mr. James Schaeffer; Mr. Edward Kickham, whom one wag claimed is the power behind Hatfield; and Mr. Lawrence Broderick of tele­vision fame. 
The assistant master of ceremonies was unavoidably late in leav­ing his spacious townhouse at 418 N. Hill St. When Mr. Thomas McKenna, of the prominent Madison McKennas, arrived, he turned a number of heads with his very daring fatigue jacket worn over an unbuttoned Gant shirt. 
The high point of the evening occurred when Mr. Philip Rath­
wig, the senior stay senator, displayed his always lively wit. His im­
itation of a blustering legislator fairly brought down the house and 
made him the affair's instant hit, a difficult task among such com­
petition. The senator kept those in the rear of the room thoroughly 
entertained. 
Also in attendance was Mr. Richard Rossie, more and more 
mentioned in some circles as presidential timber. At one point as 
the evening wore on, the senator from Mississippi seemed to have 
had more than enough but remained, nevertheless, to plow gamely 
through the remaining events. 
During the evening a crowd of on-lookers was allowed to gather 
in the rear of IC. These less notable individuals reflected the uni­
versal public mood, one of open-mouthed amazement at the even­

ing's amusements. Some, who had intended to stay for only a quick look, remained entranced throughout the evening and were not in the least disappointed. 
Although the mood of the affair was unbounded hilarity, there was some relief voiced when the affair ended in the wee hours of Thursday morning. A good time was had by all and those in atten­dance no doubt look forward to their next coming together.

No Rebef In Sight 
Those who have lived for a few years in South Bend should know the meaning of the words "no relief in sight." At the mom­ent, those words apply chiefly to the weather, as the eternal snows have reached Northern Indiana, probably not to depart until May. 
The Weather Bureau's forecast offers little hope, as it highs for today may reach the mid-30's, while tonight the temperature will once more nose dive into the 20's. There is a 50% chance of a measurable amount of snow, with flurries predicted through at least early tomorrow. If the snows are not enough Northwesterly winds of up to 25 rn.p.h. are expected to add to the misery. 
The South l:knd snows began in earnest during the second half of Saturday's football thriller, and by Sunday morning amounted to just short of two inches. Normally, the area receives seven inches of snow in November, but then again we were supposed to receive three inches of rain in October. However, the law of averages has yet to catch up with the weather in Northern Indiana.

CORAL 
A NEW AFTER SHAVE & COLOGNE 
The Notre Dame group, being mobilized by Mrs. George Neagu of South Bend, will go to Gary because whites in the steel city are afraid to work for the Negro candidate. However, Notre Dame organizer Dan Lewis, said, there is little to fear on the part of students because they will work in fairly peaceful precincts and will leave before dark. 
The exact role of the students will be to distribute Hatcher literature in white areas plus watch the polls. Hatcher will 
have radio cars cruising the poll­ing places, so any violations can be reported almost immediately.

It Ain,t The Same 
The abrupt onslaught of the snows, sig­naling the start of the bleak siege, came appropriately on our last football Satur­day. With the close of the home season,. our heroes head to the sunny South, ac­
companied by those loyal few who earned enough last summer to manage plane and refreshment charges. Many budding ro­mances will begin to fade as future Satur­days will find the roads separating Notre Dame' frC)ITI i~s flock of satellitl.! sister schools covered mostly with snow and ice. And with mommy and daddy also gone for the winter (it being unlikely that they would come up for anything else the place 
will offer), the University now sees fit to reclassify your own little c·:bLyl,ole as ex­clusively :.:. b;::droom. Your room is a prox­imate occasion of sin, a potential chamber of sexual license and damnation. But do not despair! Thank God that our Presi­dent, wherever he is, has not shirked his duty to protect us. 
Be reasonable boys. You do not nally 

want girls anytime other than on a foot· 
ball Saturday. They are an attack upon 
the collective masculinity prevailing in 
your dorm. In any case, your room is too 
small to hold more people than have be en 
stuffed into it by the Office of Stud.mt 
Account:::. If you really need to spend 
time with some girl (but just look aro'.md 
you, most of us don't), then roam to your heart's content through the spacious cqn­fines of Gorch Student Center. Its hours are liberal, and there are no beds, as such, to tempt you. And rest assured that Big Brother is watching. 

Someday. the day you get your diplo­ma, you will have been adequately habitu­ated to virtue. You can then trust your­self. Run loose, more or less, in the world. Instill in other men those values Notre Dame has given you. And keep in touch, particularly if you want tickets to the 
games. 
And fellas, you are being given more re­sponsibility every year. Whenever your tempers have run away with you, the Uni­versity has always seen fit to calm things 
down with some new student responsibili­ty. The golden concept of hall autonomy has given you some power over curfews, drinking, and general 'good order'. Some­day, long after you get your diploma, No­tre Dame men will probably have a say in the really important things that go on a­round here, such as in academic policy. Be patient. Notre Dame is an old institution. It is hard to change a tradition that has 
been so long ingrained, as football parietal 
hours. The place just hasn't been the same 
since compulsory daily mass went out. 

·Watch Out, Priest 
Although the Observer feels much more closely allied to Commonweal than to its rival America, and although we hesistate to commend any slick magazine, we must heartily support America for publishing something which we agree with. 
An assistant editor of America (the je­suit weekly newsmagazine which separates fact from religion) has suggested that Priests (those enemies of the people) should begin to wear the normal business dress of the American male. Now, we think that this is all a plot to reassert the waning influence of the clergy in America, and a such are opposed to it. 
They should learn their own place and stay in it. They got their own churches and their own schools and their own 
neighborhoods. Why should they want to come into ours? We've worked hard to keep our neighborhoods clear of their rot­ted influence, and we would really object to them coming in and tearin down the good work we done. Damn priests .. 
Can you imagine how difficult it would be to spot a Priest at fifty yards if he was not wearing a collar? Imagine walking down the quad and not knowing what people to hate! You know'm now, and that's the way that We like it. 
It would be like a nigger changin his skin ta white. We wouldn't know that we had to hate him until he told us he was a priest. Ah ask you, how can we fiPht the Catholic Conspiracy, if we don't know who its agents are? 
We don't want to see no CSCs in sheep's clothing. We make a convict show what he is, and God made the nigra black to show his inferiority, and we can't see 
why any priest thinks that he is better'm. 

This is simply another example of the Judeao -Masonic-Catholic-Communist­_Foreigner -Beatnic -Hippie -Poetical ­Revisionist -American plot, which is not unknown to the campus. It is growing, and is in large part not entirely unjusti­fied. The Clerics, at the University partic­ularly, have an image problem. While we grant that a new image will not replentish a corpse, an abandonment of the clerical collar would signify a break with past provincialism. (Never have so many been offended so often by so few.) We are con­vinced that this break has already been substantively made, but a material symbol 
would stgmfy good faith on their part, and ultimately lay the foundation for a campus on which we could cease to ob­serve such divisions as "we" and "they." 
There will always be enough causes for conflict. There will always be occasions for sincere disagreement over fundamen­tal issues, but why must our administra­tors propel our tip-toeing distrust into leaping-screaming paranoia, over such a simple issue as clothing. 


Q.no-l~et' . 11 

BY DENNIS GALLAGHER 
By the time the beloved reader peruses this, the event whereof I 
speak will be already fait accompli. The event, of course, is that 
Battle of the Bookworms, the General Electric (always mention 
the sponsor's name) College Bowl. 
The whole process began last spring, and for me at least it has 
been a somewhat harrowing experience. There were more cuts (to 
use a Tom Figel type metaphore) than in a Ray Berry pass pattern. 
And I survived each one of them by increasingly narrow margins. 
Starting from a certain emotional detachment and a general apathy 
towards whether I made the team at all, I gradually worked my 
way to the point where it was a ten point toss-up between making 
the team and a nervous breakdown. 
Anyway, I narrowly averted being the alternate. Because Bryn 
Mawr is strong in literature and weak in science, Prof. Carberry de­
c!ded it was better to throw English major Gallagher to the seventh 
s1ster rather than pre-med major Spinrad. 
I suppose I got involved in the trials in the first place largely for 
the same reasons that I went to see the Kingston Trio in concert 
a few years ago. It no longer interested me verv much but it was a 
part of my past aspirations and hence I owed some vestigial alle­
giance. Certainly, I can no longer see a game of academic trivia as 
having the same absolute validity as a test of intellectual capabil­
ities that it seemed to have when I was in high school. 
Yet I suppose there is a kind of itnpressiveness about a great breadth of knowledge even when it lacks depth. And it is the pnn­ciple of cocktail academia that those who do not understand media or know where Cheops is buried are anathema. And the College Bowl is certainly the big time of academic trivia. It should be pointed out that I don't object to it just because it is trivial. If it is no more important than a game of bridge or chess, certainly it is not less so. Kept within proper perspective, it can presumably be an innocent and enjoyable pastime. There is some question in my mind whether in fact it will. Be­cause I am on this team I was called to a personal meeting and shook hands with (yes, Virginia) Father Hesburgh. And the very presence of Messrs. Murphy and Conklin in the arrangements for travel and publicity remind us all quite forcibly that the University is a big time operation which an image to protect. We are consider­ing flying directly to Switzerland to seek asylum if we lose. But you have the advantage of me in knowing as you read this h~w. the whole thing came out. I am not, in fact, absolutely pessi­mistic. The team, particularly Greg Adolf and the Viking prince 
and captain Rick Libowitz, seems to me a basically bright group af!d they are confident of victory. Being myself subje.ct to stage fnght _ever s1_nce I played an unaccountably mute Wise Man (whose 
only lme ultimately was "Oh, no!") in a Christmas pageant at the age of six, I have certain visions of personal disaster. Not the least of these is a fear that I might curse and swear on live network tele­vision if I should happen to miss an answer. 
. Bu~ time will tell, or rather, has told. The view on Thursday mght IS too clouded for me to say any more than I think we have a chance. At all events, I ask our readers to remember that the con­clusion of this match does not demonstrate our academic superior­ity o~ inferiority to them fancy Eastern schools. One other thing, e~en 1f I pull a living statue or answer eight questions wrong, I'll kill anybody who calls me stupid.

THE SPREAD-EAGLE OF TECHNOLOGY AT GRUMMAN 
Ranges from inner to outer space 
Grumman has special interest for the graduating engineer and scientist seeking the widest spread of technology for his skills. At Grumman, engineers are involved in deep ocean technology... engineers see their advanced aircraft designs proven daily in the air over Vietnam, and soon ..in outer space, the Grumman LM (Lunar Module) will land the astro­nauts on the lunar surface. Grumman, situated in Bethpage, L.I. (30 miles from N.Y.C.), is in the cultural center of activity. Universities are close at hand for those who wish to continue their studies. C.C.N.Y., Manhattan College, New York UniversitY, Pratt Institute, Columbia University, State University at Stony Brook, Polytechnic Institute of Brook­lyn, Hofstra University and Adelphi College are all within easy distance. The surroundings are not hard to take. Five beautiful public golf courses are in Bethpage-two minutes from the plant. White sand beaches stretch for miles along the Atlantic (12 minutes drive). The famed sailing reaches of Long Island Sound are only eleven miles away. The informal atmosphere is a Grumm~n tradition, matched by an eljually hard-nosed one of turning out some of the free world's highest performance aircraft systems and space vehicles. To name a few  



Here then is the opportunity for graduating engineers. AEs, CEs, EEs, MEs, IEs, majors and Chemical Engineering majors  to take their place in the continuum of technology that is Grumman. Grumman representatives will be

I suppose most of us have been shot down in our lives.

But how else do they tell us that they've all decided not to celebrate Christmas, so we had better ab­stain from Yule-joy this year. 
Perhaps it is merely an armad­illo emotional chord which re­coils from a Notre Darner's ad­mission that he cried. You claim that we "wish only to 'cry' at society and not put out the ef­fort to change it." When we went to Washington, I don't think crying was Don Hynes' purpose and goal, nor that of the Rad­cliffe girl who, as we linked arms to protect ourselves from attack, shook so violently from fear that it began sympathetic vibrations in my body. To give it straight ­I don't think you can "over­emotionlize...about the issues," because the whole idea was an appeal to national emotion.

Unfortuantely you could not see things as they were since you had to rely on what you read in our press and heard on televis­ion. I am sorry for that. I wish we had the "mediocrity" of which you speak. It is less than that.

BY AL BERRYMAN 40-0.29-3.31-7. And now 43-14. Since the Era ofAra has begun, Notre Dame has scored more points against Navy than any other opponent except Pittsburgh. In 1964 John Huarte led Ara's forces into JFK Stadium in Phila­delphia. The Irish piled up 504 yards total offense as Huarte appli­ed what has been called the "Holloween's Day Massacre" to the Middies. He included in his performance that day a 74 yard pass play to Nick Eddy and a 55 yard pass to Jack Snow, both for touchdowns. The next year saw the Irish trailing 3-0 when, on the last play of the first half, Bill Zloch and Eddy teamed up on a screen pass play that was good for 55 yards and a touchdown. Notre Dame rolled in the second half as Nick Rassas threw in a 66 yard punt re­turn for a score, and the final read ND 29, Navy 3. The 1966 game was the first day John Pergine played outside linebacker for No.tre Dame. All he did was intercept three passes, and in general wreck Navy's chances. The Middies gained only 64 yards all day as the Irish rolled, 31-7. Last Saturday we saw the 1967 version of the annual battle. Notre Dame piled up more total offense than they did in 1964­
509 yards-and scored more points than they ever have against 
Navy. And John Cartwright, whom his coach modestly refers to as 
"the best in the country", was 8 for 25. 
The Irish moved with authority the first time they got the ball. 
Terry Hanratty took half the first quarter to move his team 67 
yards for a TD. Shelving the pass for this drive, Hanratty relied 
solely on Rocky Bleier, Bob Gladieux and Jeff Zimmerman to 
grind it out. 

The second quarter was Navy's undoing as the Irish rang up 28 points during the 15 minutes. Hanratty first hit Jim Seymour in the end zone with a 10 yard strike, and then took one in himself from three yards out. After the kickoff Pergine, who seemingly makes a habit of ruining Cartwright, picked off one of the Navy QB's passes and returned it 6 yards to the Irish 43. Six plays later Bleier again scored from the 2. Hanratty hit a couple of good pass­es in the drive, one to Zimmerman for 21 and one to Seymour for 
15. Gladieux got the last score of the period to culminate a 56 yard drive. 
The second half saw two Navy touchdowns, the first two they have ever s~ored on a Johnny Ray-coached defense. The statistics for the second half, however, showed that the Irish second string still outplayed the Middies-226 yards total offense to 119 for 
Navy. 
Notre Dame's touchdown went to Ron Dushney, who deserved it after the workhorse performance he put in during the second half. He carried 13 times for 82 yards, with his TD coming on a one-yard burst off tackle. Nick Furlong, caught the 2-pointer 
from O'Brien to finish the Irish scorin for the da .
