Could one of these men be the next ND president? 
Today, the Board of Trustees 10-member nominating committee meets in the Center for Continuing Education to vote on who it will pro­pose to the board to succeed retiring University President Father Thoedore Hesburgh. 
Tomorrow, the full 49-member board will choose, in all likelihood, the nominating com­mittee's choice. 
While most observers have centered their at­tention on Father Edward "Monk" Malloy, Fa­ther William Beauchamp, Father Ernest Bar­tell, Father Michael McCafferty, and Father David Tyson as likely candidates to succeed Hesburgh, I hope there remains the possibility for a "dark-horse" candidate to emerge. 
Maybe, just maybe, the Board will consider some possible successors who are qualified to serve the University in their own, unique way. 
Here are some alternatives; Board of Trus­tees, please take note. 
l.Billy Martin -The former manager has proven himself a winner wherever he has been made the head man. Martin's managing stints in New York, Texas, Minnesota, Detroit, and Oakland have made him popular all across the country, making him perfect for Notre Dame's national student body and alumni. Get Martin away from the pressures of George Stienbren­ner and New York, and I think he'll stop getting into barroom brawls that could embarrass the University. . 
Although by University rule, the next presi­dent must be a C.S.C. priest, I think if a few extra dollars and a lifetime supply of Captain Black chewing tobacco are put into the con­tract, Martin will take up the vows. Besides, just think of the publicity when the University president races down from the press box of Notre Dame Stadium to kick dirt on a football referee. 
2.Gerry Faust -We all know how much the man loves Notre Dame. Although his first go round as a man at the top at ND was not all that successful, what better place than Akron to regain one's composure and build leadership skills. His optimism and incredible enthusiasm would make him great for those fundraising cocktail parties. 
From Faust's well-documented trips to the Grotto, we know he's Catholic enough to join the ranks of Holy Cross, and he always said he would do anything for Notre Dame. Most im­portantly, he's got an escape clause in his con­tract at Akron, so you know he's ready and willing to come back. 
Chris Bednarski 
Assistant News Editor 

3.Pope John Paul II -He's a priest, so he's cleared hurdle number one. Add in the fact that in the last few years he has gained invaluable experience in the Vatican, and I would say he's just about ready for the job. The Pope loves to travel, so he would fill Hesburgh's shoes per­fectly, and his recent decision to fire Father Curran for liberal teaching at American Uni­versity make him perfect for Notre Dame's predominately conservative administration. The Pope's only drawback would be the long­term contract he's tied into with the Vatican. It's doubtful he has an escape clause for Notre Dame ala Gerry Faust and Lou Holtz. 
4.Clint Eastwood --If the trustees are looking for toughness in the new president, then Clint's their man. Who better to enforce the rules of duLac. "So the students want to extend parie­tals; Go ahead, make my day." He's been gaining valuable administrative experience at his post as mayor of Carmel, California and may be ready for the position on the third floor of the Administration Building. 
His largest drawback is his past experience as an actor. We know the perils of what can happen when a former actor becomes presi­dent. 
What are the chances the Board would actu­ally choose one of these candidates? Well, what were the chances that Mike Switek and Don Montanaro would be elected?

A computer program mal­function is responsible for the two-week delay in the distribu­tion of this year's University directory, according to Assis­tant Registrar David Kil. 
"Any changes put into the system after the middle of Au­gust were not picked up be­cause of a program problem," he said. 
As a result, the addresses of those undergraduate students who made dorm changes were not updated from last year, ac­cording to Kil. Also,"the campus addresses of graduate

students from St. Joseph's, Brownson, and O'Hare-Grace Residence Halls did not appear in the directory," he said. 
Kil recalled all the books before they were able to be dis­tributed for circulation at the last HPC meeting. A corrected version of the book was imme­diately sent to the printer, Uni­versity Directories, for reprint­ing. 
Kil emphasized that it is not possible to put the blame on 
anyone. "We have used the same program for a number of years and never had any prob­lem," he said, calling the mal­function "a quirk in the sys­tem." 
According to Kil, the reason for malfunction of the program has been discovered and "we know what to do in the future. It won't happen again." 
Kil, who said the books should be out by the end of this week or the beginning of next week, commented, "two weeks is an excellent response from the company," referring to the amount of time it took for the reprinting. 
"In the future we're trying to get the books out earlier than the traditional mid-October date," Kil said.

"I didn't even realize there was something wrong in my life. It sounds so weird, but al­cohol was just a part of our lives," said Connie, daughter of an alcoholic, at Saint Mary's alcohol awareness lecture Tuesday night. 
The lecture, entitled "Someone I Know Drinks Too Much," was the second in a se­ries sponsered by the Saint Mary's Alcohol Education Council. 
Representative of the benefits of alcohol therapy groups, Connie, a Notre Dame graduate, and Kristin, a Notre Dame senior who battled alco­hol and drug abuse, spoke of their experiences with al­coholism and discussed how they learned to deal with the disease. 
Connie spoke about her expe­rience with an alchoholic fa­ther and discussed how Al­anon, an alcohol support group counseling relatives of al-Like Connie, Kristen said she 
had led an unhappy life before 
becoming involved with an al­
cohol support group. 
Kristen said she began drink­ing and experimenting with drugs when she was 11 years old. Describing her life as one of living on excuses, Kristen said she never accomplished a thing. 
"I was an erratic person. I was always looking for fun, ex­citement, parties and freedom. It was as if I was afraid of something," she said. 
Kristen said she finally sought help for her problem after Christmas of her sopho­more year at Saint Mary's. 
"I just hit bottom and couldn't take being unhappy anymore," she said. It was then that she went to Alcoholics Anonymous for help, she added. 
AA helped her be honest with herself, Kristen said. Like Connie, she noted that alcohol hindered her from developing relationships. "I had no friends but a million aquaintances."

In her battle with an alcohlic parent, Connie said she be­carne an empty and unhappy person. "If I didn't have a brain then there would have really been no reason to go on," she said. 
Connie said she realized she could be an "Okay" person by getting involved in Al-anon aftr she saw how the support group had helped her mother. 
"Al-anon taught me to believe living was for continual growth," said Connie, "I had to detach myself from my fa­ther's problem and get on with living." 
Connie said that having anal­coholic parent was was very destructive for her when she tried to establish male and female relationships. With the help of Al-anon, she said, she learned to explore her spirituality and form good, meaningful relationships. 
Because of Al-anon, Connie said she feels she is gradually becoming the person she wants to be.

to go there." 
Rather than allowing moral decision-making to be taken care of by the invisible hand of Adam Smith or the "visible hand" of government, Goodpaster said he wants to defend a third way, the "Hand of Management." 
Goodpaster said the whole 

conception of management 
must change. "The corporation is a citizen of society," he said. It must look both inward and outward from both the eco­nomic and moral point of view, he said. 
The role of conscience must be institutionalized both inside the corporation as well as out­side, said Goodpaster. The company has to have respect for the employees as well as respect for the consumers and the general public, he said. 
"We have to go deeper than the rhetoric," he said. A corpo­ration's conscience is more than just a statement of values

that somebody pulls out of a drawer, he said. "We have to look deeper than that." 
Goodpaster also discussed the "Frankenstein problem," namely the question of whether this move toward type-3 think­ing and a corporate conscience will be a good thing or if society will be creating a monster. "The moment you move in the direction of corporate con­science as an agenda . . . " you face these three paradoxes, said Goodpaster. 
"The idea of corporations working under the same moral standards as we do has intui­tive appeal," he said. But the leadership of this organization is not elected or appointed to do this kind of managing, said Goodpaster, calling this the paradox of legitimacy. 
Managers usually motivate by appealing to self-interest, said Goodpaster. Thus, he said they face another paradox as they ask, "How do I motivate people to behave not just be­cause it's in their own interest but because it's the right thing to do."

Corby's hasn't been a bar, and

we've enjoyed it. ,
"My main objection is al­...., coholic beverages being sold ~ from that particular prop­, erty," he said. 
Said Renelada Robinson, center director for the associ­ation, "The main issue is that the tavern is not needed. We have enough taverns in tbe neighborhood. 
"We need to get on with the business of improving our neighborhoods. Let them sell Corby's and get a business the neighborhood wants," she said. 
Gourley added, "The present 
owners have no affiliation (to 
these past problems) in the 
transfer of the license." 
James Broad, owner of CTI, 
said CTI was only trying to con­
form to the ABB's proposal of 
divesting the assets. 
"CTI voluntarily gave it (the 
property, assets and license) 
up. We wanted to follow the 
ABB guidelines to the letter. 
We would like to sell the per­
mit," said Broad. 
"If the renewal is denied, 
then the asset has no value. 
Most of these funds will go to 
creditors," he said. 
Board member Harold Zyski 
offered the only vote in favor 
of renewal. 
"I'll vote for renewal so the 
man (James Broad, present 
owner of CTI) can sell the 
license," said Zyski. 
The proposed renewal was 
voted down by Joseph Szekendi, 
board secretary; Joseph

he used the opportunity to com­
plain that "a shroud of 
secrecy" around the Vatican's 
investigative process had kept 
him from even seeing the for­
mal charges against him. 
Malone, however, said, "I 
believe it is clear that the 
process employed by the Holy 
See was in accord with general 
principles of church law and 
procedures. The decision 
reached at the end of the 
process was made by the 
proper church authorities. As 
such, it deserves our respect 
and confidence." 
Sources familiar with the debate said that the verdict was softened a bit from an ear­lier version that would have declared the Vatican decision "just and reasonable." 
The final statement, said Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, indicated the bishops do not feel "the sky is falling in ... the church is about to explode, there is imminent rebellion on the part of the bishops toward the Holy See.'' 
Another conservative car­dinal, Bernard Law of Boston, said the statement indicated strong papal support by the bis­hops, and "at this moment, more than anything else, that has to be seen."

Small vote 
In response to Joe Merchant's View­point article of November 11 entitled, "Student Senate Must Push for Divest­ment," allow me to clarify a few facts and set the record straight. The Student Senate decided on November 3 to table the motion on recommending to the Board of Trustees that Notre Dame

It was r' not simply a matter of not having a r r mandate from the students, but more a reluctance to vote hastily without seriously considering the implications

out being reasonably ·sure of why we would vote a certain way. We didn't want to be swayed by emotional claims that divestment is the only moral al­ternative without really understanding the other side of this complex issue. 
ln light of this, during the subsequent week those of us, myself included, who didn't feel comfortable with their knowledge of the subject, researched the issue and tried to formulate an in­formed, intelligent position. This was capped off by presentations from legitimate representatives of both sides of the issue at the Nov. 10 meeting. Then, and only then, did we take a vote. I hope you would agree that the mem­bers of the Senate should not vote on any issues, especially isues of this mag­nitude, on a whim without intelligently formulating an opinion.

Student mandate calls for board to divest now 
This past Monday, the Student Senate voted on a resolution which I proposed concerning the University's investment policy toward companies engaged in business activities in South Africa. It is resolved that " ... the University should set a specific deadline for cor­
. porations engaged in business activi­ties in South Africa to disinvest unless the Government of South Africa makes significant progress toward disman­tling its system of apartheid and takes genuine measures towards negotiating with black leaders. If neither the cor­porations disinvest nor the Government makes significant progress toward dis­mantling apartheid by the established deadline, the University ought to com­pletely divest from these corpora­tions." The measure was passed by a slim majority, 8 to 7.

I worked overtime to present my col­leagues in the Senate with substantial material from both sides to make a decision, and felt betrayed by the final vote. Upon reflection though, the result has proven to be very revealing. Both sides present valid arguments. However, although each side would like to think that their argument is correct (as I did in proposing the resolution), 

Doonesbury 
neither can be absolutely certain that they are correct. Do corporations really aid in the dismantling of apartheid or are they lending economic support to the policy? Would the government of South Africa concede under economic sanctions? These are questions which cannot truly be answered. 
What one can be certain of is the cur­rent University policy which was estab­lished by the Board of Trustees last May. It basically states that the Uni­versity would divest if it became ap­parent that the corporations were not influencing the dismantling of apar­theid and if the situation deteriorated further. Has the established criteria been met? 
Since the last board meeting there have been numerous developments. In June, the South African government declared a state of emergency, vir­tually taking away any of the rights the blacks may have had. As a response, the United States government, through Congressional impetus, has imposed sanctions on South Africa. In addition, within the past month, numerous cor­porations have announced that they're divesting. Moreover, the Administra­tive Board of the United States Catholic Conference voted 47-0, on Sept. 10, 1986, urging the "consideration" of divest­ment to all Catholic institutions. The bishops claimed that their "religious and moral teaching is daily con­tradicted by apartheid." Is Notre Dame

did indeed pass a resolution on Nov. 10 recommending to the Board of Trustees that Notre Dame divest from compan­ies d~ing business in South Africa un­less by a specific date, which would be determined by the board, the govern­ment of South Africa "has made signif­icant progress toward dismantling its system of apartheid and has taken genuine measures toward negotiating with black leaders." The vote, however, was split down the middle with seven votes for and seven votes against the proposal before Student Body President Mike Switek cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the pro­posal. This clearly is not a mandate to the Board of Trustees to change their policy on divestment. 
I also do not believe that the student body has mandated divestment either. We cannot take the vote from last year's referendum on divestment as a call by the student body to divest. Based strictly on that vote, we find that the students are split on the issue. On the divestment referenum, only 2,082 stu­dents out of an undergraduate popula­tion well in excess of 7,000 voted that Notre Dame should divest. Only 58 per­cent of the undergraduates voted on the issue at all and, of those who did vote, not even half voted for divestment, while a third voted for not divesting and almost a fifth had no opinion on the issue. How can these underwhelming results be taken as a clear mandate by the students to divest? Until proven otherwise, I do not believe such a man­date exits or ever has existed. I just don't see the wholehearted, collective support by the student body as a unified call for divestment, as Merchant ap­parently does.

immune from such teaching? 
Again I ask, has the criteria of the present policy been met? This question will underlie the board's policy discus­sion. From all appearances, the answer is an unequivocal yes. Words mean nothing unless acted upon; therefore, the board must act. The resolution passed by the Student Senate and a similar proposal passed by the Faculty

Senate are viable alternatives. In set­ting a specific deadline one leaves hope that the situation will improve, while putting substance into the policy by genuinely threatening divestment, even if the process of divesting occurs many months later .

Cubs, Bears and ND? 
ERIC M. BERGAMO features copy editor 
For Andrew McKenna, interest in baseball bega11 very early in life. 
"In my youth, baseball was truly the national pastime, the sport that everyone had -the greatest Interest in. Professional football had not reached those peaks at that time," McKenna said. 
"I grew up in a major league city, a two-team city, in Chicago. So it was a matter of interest for everybody." 
That interest would become even greater later in life for McKenna, vice chairman of the Board of Trustees of Notre Dame and a member of the Class of 
1951. He helped save the Chicago White Sox from a possi­ble move to Seattle in 1975 and became director of the Chicago Cubs in 1981. More recently, as director of the Chicago Bears, McKenna's involvement in sports has expanded into the world of professional football. 
McKenna is also president and chief executive officer of the Schwarz Paper Company and serves on the board of directors of I I corporations and chairites. 
McKenna came to Notre Dame as a student in 194 7 during the post-war era. World War II had a profound effect upon the student population at that time, McKenna recalled. 
"College life at the time was a mix because there were many older students on campus who were veterans who had come out of the service from World War II and of course there were younger ones like myself," McKenna said. 
Notre Dame, at the time McKenna was a student. had not yet reached the level of success experienced today. 
"There was a cohesiveness of 
the school. The school was in 
many respects still in its early 
daysand was marchingaiong the 
road to the days ofthe leadership 
of Father Hesburgh. It was a 
school that had not yet quite 
achieved some of the greatness 
that Father Hesburgh has 
brought to it today." 
McKenna's first experience with baseball came at a critical moment. Chicago was in danger of losing the White Sox in a move to Seattle. 
In 1969, there had been a 
major league team in Seattle 
called the Pilots. The Pilots 
moved to Milwaukee to become 
the Brewers. 
After losing the franchise, the city of Seattle brought a lawsuit against the American Leauge. The lawsuit called for payment of damages incurred by the move or having the League give Seattle another team. 
When it was apparent that Seattle had a good case, the American League had to respond by either giving them a team at the end of 1975 or start paying damages. The American League decided to give Seattle a team. At that same time, the White Sox were owned by a man named John Allyn and were in very dif­ficult financial condition. The American League decided that the White Sox would be the team to move to Seattle. 
McKenna said he realized that Chicago was in danger of losing one of its institutions. 
"It occured to me, as well as other Chicagoans, that it would be wrong for a major city like Chicago to lose one of its long time franchises." McKenna recalled the moves of the Brook­lyn Dodgers and the New York Giants to Los Angeles and San Francisco respectively and how those moves broke the hearts of their fans. To prevent that from happening to Chicago, McKenna contacted an old friend who had been deeply involved in baseball in the past: Bill Veeck. 
"He had run several major league franchises and owned the White Sox at one time. He came back and put together a group of businessmen and purchased the White Sox from Allyn and saved the White Sox from moving_ to Seattle." 
McKenna remembers Veeck. who died in 1985, as having a profound effect on him and anyone who got to know him well. 
"He was an absolute rugged individualist and referred to him­self as a survivor. But he was loaded with common sense and had a great spirit. He had an in­tellect that he expected some challenges." 
''He had a perception of things that you just couldn't imagine. He had a sense about them and anticipated them. He's one of those kinds that doesn't come around very often." 
McKenna was chairman of the White Sox when they were sold in 1981 and "having been bitten by the bug," heard that Chicago's other team, the Cubs, were likely to be for sale. 
"Mr. Wrigley, who had been the owner, had died and his wife had died and his son was in an estate problem. I approached the Cubs and it was true that they could be purchased." 
"But it was also true that they weren't going to wait for some­one like me to syndicate a group to buy them," McKenna ex­plained. "They wanted a buyer who was going to put down one check quietly." 
Fortunately, it was the Tribune Company, of which McKenna is a member of its board of direc­tors, who put down that check. 
"It occured to me that they (the Tribune Company) would be a very logical buyer because WGN television telecasts their games and WGN radio broadcasts their games." 
"And right across the street from the Wrigley Building is Tribune Tower. I just knew that there would be a certain romance to a transaction of that sort," McKenna said. 
McKenna was named director 
of the Cubs after the Tribune 
Company purchased the Cubs in "Mike's done a terrificjob. He has a terrific way of handling ail con­stituencies: the players; the op­posing teams; the media. I think he's outstanding." 

Running back Walter Payton: "He looks as good to me today as he did ten years ago. When we need important yardage, Payton gets It for us." 
Quarterback Jim McMahon: "He's a very talented young man. His personal style may be differ­ent. but he's a winner. You can't be successful in football unless you have a good quarterbackand what makes one quarterback better than the other is the con: fidence he instills in his team­mates." 
Defensive tackle William "The Refrigerator" Perry: "A very, very nice man with a large family in South carolina. Who could im­agine a year ago that Perry would be a national hero." 
Football has become very popular in England the past few years and the Bears travelled to England over the summer to play an exhibition game against the Dallas Cowboys. 
"The sportsfans in London are very good. When we played there, ail the attention was on the Bears," McKenna explained. 
As vice chairman of the Board of Trustees, McKenna will be in­volved in two important issues facing Notre Dame: divestment and the election of Father Hes­burgh's successor. 
McKenna said that he does not 
believe that Coca-Cola's selling 
of their holdings in South Africa 
will have much influence on the 
board's decision. 
"Coca-Cola did what was ap­propriate for that company and I respect them for that and I think that Notre Dame will have to study its own circumstances." 
The search for Hesburgh's suc­cessor has been "a very healthy and lengthy process and very thorough," McKenna said. The final decision will be made when the board meets this Friday. 
McKenna had the highest praise for Hesburgh and his .35­year term as president of Notre Dame. 
"You could write a book. He took a school that had not achieved any greatness, but was a good school and on the way up. Just look at the record. He took the endowment from a single digit to $400 million. There are 9.3 endowed professor­ships on this campus. There has been the expansion of a number of buildings. The number of Notre Dame graduates who are leading major companies." 
"Hesburgh's role in the church, 
his role in the country and his 
role In the world has focused 
great attention on Notre Dame," 
McKenna noted. 
McKenna said he believes that 
the future for Notre Dame looks 
very good. 
"I think that Father Hesburgh, Father Joyce and Tim O'Meara, our provost, have placed Notre Dame In very solid condition. There is a great foundation for fultlllment of goats:' 1982. Two years later the Cubs, the most lovable losers in baseball, would be challenging for the National League Champi­onship. 
"That was a very rewarding thing," recalled McKenna. "The Cubs had been a doormat for years as lovable as they were. In a very short time period, we had set a timetable for turning things around and in 1984 we had a very successful year." 
"The only dissappointlng thing was when we went to San Diego after we won the first two games of the playoffs in Chicago and didn't win a game out there." 
Because of their immense ap-Super Bowl. McKenna said that he wasn't worried that the bad luck that struck the Cubs would also hit the Bears. 

The night before the game McKenna had dinner with Mi­chael Mccaskey, president and chief executive officer of the Bears, and were kidding about a possible Patriots upset. 
Among the guests that night was Dallas Green, general manager of the Cubs. Green and Mccaskey, McKenna said, were 
both professional enough not to be superstitious and yet also aware that sports are full, of little nuances of that sort.

Fumble recovery record 
Figaro works on pass rush 
By TERRY LYNCH Sports Writer 
Is it luck, or skill, or both? 
When Cedric Figaro fell on a fumble last Saturday against SMU, it was almost as if the scene of watching number 48 fall on a football that the other team's offense just happened to drop, had become part of the season ticket package. 
"I've never seen anything like it," says outside limeback­ers coach Kurt Schotten­heimer. 
But that is not really all that provocative of a statement. The fact is that nobody associ­ated with Notre Dame football has seen anything like it. Ever. 
The previous Irish record for fumble recoveries in a season was five, shared by six players. 
Phone 2n-6368 6402 Grape Road Across from University Park Mall on Grape Road 

Figaro has seven so far this season, and there are still three games left on the schedule. 
But Figaro, a junior, has played in every game since his freshman year, and hadn't come up with a fumble in all that time. So what's all that dif­ferent about this year? 
"This is the first year I've been concentrating on pass rushing," says the 6-3, 232­pound Figaro. "We worked on it a little bit in my sophomore year, but now we work on it all the time. 
"Most of it's just getting to the ball. Now we're creating the fumbles. Every day in prac­tice we work on getting to the ball. Last year (on the defense), we'd normally only send eight guys after the foot­ball and drop three back. This year we send allll guys. 
"Every day it's,'run to the ball, get to the ball," continues Figaro. "And if we get tired and start slacking off, coach Schott makes sure we keep going." 
For Figaro, this new style of 
defense may mean a lot more 
work, but it also means a lot 
more fun. 
"Last year it would depend 
on the defense we called as to 
what I'd be doing. Sometimes 
Bob (Banks) would drop back 
and I'd rush, and sometimes it 
would be the other way around. 
"Dropping back was fun, but 
I'm the type of player who 
prefers being in the contact 
zone." 

The contact zone is really 
where Figaro belongs, as was 
shown last week against SMU. 
One questionable call involving 
a late hit on SMU quarterback 
Bobby Watters cost the Irish 15 
yards.

our wrestlers beat guys who they lost to in the past." 
Notre Dame finished 13 points ahead of fourth-place Central Michigan, who won a dual meet between the two schools in 1985. 
Notre Dame has participated in the Michigan State Invita­tional in each of the past ten years. In the last three years, under the direction of McCann, the team has finished in ninth, sixth, and second place. 
"It is a very competitive tournament," said McCann. "Michigan State always ap­pears at the top of the Big Ten. Central Michigan is the defend-

for the sake of reference, that's one behind Missouri (77-0 losers to Oklahoma) and only 79 notches below the 21st­ranked Irish. 
Things are going so well for Faust, in fact, that rumors began circulating last week that Wisconsin was interested in hiring him to fill the Badgers' head coach vacancy. 
·Faust reportedly has an escape clause in his contract that al­lows him to leave the Zips if he gets an offer from the Big Ten, ACC, or, yes, Notre Dame. 
No word yet on whether any 
"The quarterback ran a naked bootleg and I really couldn't tell if he had the ball when I hit him," says Figaro. "After that play, I got a good hit on the quarterback and that got us back up again." 
The physical style of play Figaro has adopted was part of him long before he came to Notre Dame. In Lafayette, La., where Figaro played his high school ball, you either played the physical game or you didn't play at all. 
"Every game, every prac­tice was a war," explains Figaro. "I still like to play the rough style of football. Up North, it's a different game. It isn't as big up here. 
"Up here, guys help people up. Some players say 'nice shot' when they get hit during a game. Down South, if there's a back that comes to your side, you hit him hard and talk to him, and say things like, 'Don't come back here,' or 'Don't run over this way again.' 
"We played the game where we wanted the other guys to get mad at you or want to kill you,'' continued Figaro. "If they were thinking about that, then they wern't thinking of what they had to do as much. In high school, they taught us to do that." 
While three years up North 
have mellowed Figaro ("this 
year I helped one guy up"), he 
still adheres to a few rules from 
the deep South. 
"I won't let the other player know they got a good shot on me. During the game, I'll never let him know he got the best of me. It makes him wonder,'What's this guy think­ing?"' 
ing Mid-American Conference champions, and Ferris State is the Division III champion, so you can't be upset about where we finished." 
What Notre Dame can be up­set about is injuries. Both 126­pound Dave Carlin and 190­pound Dan Mitchell will be out for several weeks due to injur­ies suffered last weekend. Car­lin has a bad elbow and Mitchell has a sore shoulder. 
"The key to a successful season is to stay away from in­juries," said McCann. "Notre Dame has the toughest schedule in its history and we can't afford to have people out with injuries." 
The team's next competition will be a home dual meet against Air Force on Novem­ber 19. 
of the ACC schools are inter­ested. 
 

Paterno must be feeling very confident these days as he gets his team ready for its game with the Irish. At least that's the way it appears based on the coach's comments to the Chicago Tribune. 
"The first time I went to play at Notre Dame Stadium," he said, "everyone told me about the mystique. To tell the truth I didn't feel anything different. 
"I think Notre Dame has got a fine football tradition, but so do Alabama, Southern Cal, Michigan, and others. I don't think there's any unusual mys­tique about Notre Dame any longer, especially not to the younger kids."

The Irish could anticipate Lawrence would be a pretty good player based on his high school accomplishments. He was an all-state selection as a junior and a senior as a defen­sive back. He also earned honorable mention for the AdidasScholastic Coach prep All-American squad. 
It did not take long for Lawrence to get into the swing of things once he arrived, and he received some helping hands. 
"We didn't have much depth when I got here, so Troy Wilson and I were second-team right away, behind Stacey Toran and Chris Brown," he says. "That situation definitely helped me

develop quicker, and those guys really helped me, too." 
Now it is Lawrence who is the experienced member of the group. The 6-4, 194-pound bal­lhawk also packs a wallop as evidenced by his 23 solo tackles and 10 assists. Forbes says that Lawrence is also taking over the job of showing the younger players the ropes. 
"He leads by example," Forbes says. "He really en­courages the team from the sidelines, and just exerts a great deal of positive leader­ship." 
His experience and leader­ship show in his attitude toward drive-stopping. He likes to be the one the team can depend on to make the crucial play that stops a drive. 
"I just like to make the play that can turn the game around,'' the psychology major says. "I like any big play in general, whether it be a recovery, an interception or a big hit." 
Being in a position to make the momentum-stopping play is what the free safety position is all about. It is also what Steve Lawrence is all about.

Wrestling takes 2nd at Mich. St. 
By CHRIS KILEY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame wrestling 
team opened its season on the 
road this past weekend at the 
Michigan State Invitational 
and returned with a second­
place finish behind host Mic­
higan State .. 
Head Coach Fran McCann 
was aprehensive about the 
results. 
" It was a typical good news, 
bad news situation," said 
McCann. "Although we did 
come in second place, we still 
didn't win, and that was our 
goal." 
The surprise of the tourna­
ment was freshman Andy 
Radenbaugh in the 118-pound 
division. Radenbaugh won the 
tournament by defeating last 
year's tournament champion, 
who was also a NCAA qualifier. 
Three other wrestlers were 
also crowned champions. Pat 
Boyd won the 142-pound divi­
sion while both Ron Wisniewski 
and Chris Geneser won their 
respective divisions with pins 
in the finals. 
Lone senior Dave Helmer 
and 158-pound Dan Carrigan 
both looked respectable · al­
though they did not place. Cap­
tain Jerry Durso, however,

Irish defenseman Lance Patten (3) and the rest but the offense needs to increase its goal pro­of the defense played well against Kent State, duction at the Pointer Classic this weekend. 
ND needs improved offense tomorrow at Pointer Classic 

By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
After the Notre Dame hockey team lost two season-opening games in which the defense played well enough to win, Head Coach Lefty Smith is looking for an improved offense when the Irish take to the ice this weekend in the Pointer Classic. 
"The key to this tourna­ment will be our scoring ability. We have to put the puck in the nets," said Smith. "In our two games against Kent State, we played well defensively and only allowed six goals in two games, but we didn't play well enough offensively." 
·Notre Dame faces St. John's (Minn.) tomorrow at 5 p.m., then will meet either Augsburgh or Wisconsin-Stevens Pofnt on Saturday. Wisconsin-Stevens Point is hosting the tournament. 
"We don't know much about St. John's, but Stevens Point and Augsburgh are very competitive," said Smith. "We're certainly going up there with.the idea of winning, yet it's tough to see how they'll respond on the road." 
Smith is hoping that an ex­tra three weeks of practice will work to the advantage of the 0-2 Irish. Notre Dame had only two weeks of prac­tice before the 4-2 and 2-1 losses to Kent State. The Irish have had three weeks off since then. 
"We seem to have made some improvements on the power play, but we've only been playing against our­selves, so we can't really tell." said Smith. "We'd like to feel we've improved, but the proof in the pudding is when you go against some­one else." 

Three freshmen will receive starting assign­ments this weekend. Tim Kuehl will start on the front line, Kevin Markovitz will be on the defensive end, and Lance Madson will start at goalie. 
Kuehl scored in the season opener, and Markovitz had an assist in the same game. In the second game, Madson recorded 28 saves and al­lowed only two goals. 
"We've been pleased with our freshmen," said Smith. "Markovitz and (Mike) Leherr have done well on defense, Madson has been good in the nets, and Kuehl and (Bruce) Guay have done-

Merkel leads Irish at districts 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
As the snow begins to fall around the Notre Dame campus, most students are busy running towards the warmth of their dorm rooms. But for the 17 dedicated women of the Notre Dame cross country team, these icy days are just one of the many they have spent since August not just running, but outrunning their competition. 
The Irish hope to highlight an already impressive season with a strong finish in the NCAA District IV meet this Saturday. They hope to finish in the top 20 and possibly even better if the team runs well against the powerful teams of the Big Ten and Mid-America conferences, as well as against the defending National Cham­pions from the University of Wisconsin. 
Under the guidance of first­year coach Dan Ryan, the team will look to continue its consis­tently strong showings that have included first-place showings against 12 teams in the Southwestern Michigan In­vitational and against 14 teams in the Indiana Intercollegiate meet. 
Having finished second in the North Star Conference behind an experienced team from DePaul, the Irish will look to follow in the footsteps of junior Julia Merkel, who has led them to top-ten finishes in every in­vational they have competed in this year. 
Junior Kathleen Lehman and sophomore Theresa Rice will look to qualify for the NCAA champion-ship meet as well.

Green given brief look· at defen.sive back 
It wouldn't be the first time a Notre Dame tail­back switched over to defensive back, but it might be the most surprising. 
Following the tradition of Irish runners like Hiawatha Francisco' and Corny Southall, both promising tailbacks that were moved at one time in their careers to defensive back, Mark Green spent Monday afternoon's practice working out with the defense at the request of Irish head coach Lou Holtz. 
While the move itself may not be that surprising -Green was a standout defensive back in high school and played flanker for the Irish all last year -the timing is certainly so. The 6-0, 183-pound sophomore has gained 248 yards rushing this year while split­ting time with freshman Anthony Johnson, and with only three games to go it would seem unusual to make such a drastic change. 
"We've got some guys hurting in the secondary," said Irish secondary coach Terry Forbes, referring to the nagging injuries plaguing Marv Spence and Chris Kvochak, as well as the season losses of Brandy Wells and Mike Haywood. "Mark: is a talented all-round player, and we just wanted to look at him there in order to find the best combin­ations possible." 
While this may mean a permanent change for Green in the future, don't count on seeing him anywhere else but in the offensive backfield against Penn State on Saturday. 
"Mark's practiced on both sides of the ball this week," said Forbes. "We're not sure yet how we'll use him against Penn State, but he'll be a factor somehow.'' 
For the second time in three weeks, a Notre Dame player has been named AP Midwest Player of the Week. Irish quarterback Steve Beuerlein picked up the award this week after connecting on 11-of-20 passes for a career-high 269 yards in directing his squad to its 61-29 rout of SMU.

Two weeks ago, Beuerlein's favorite target Tim Brown received the honor for his performance in Notre Dame's 31-3 victory over Air Force. 
For Beuerlein, the award caps an impressive three-week stretch that has seen him settle down and complete a combined 32-of-53 passes for three touchdowns and no interceptions. This leadership has not gone unnoticed by Holtz, who credits much of his team's recent success to Beuerlein's im­proved direction of the offense. 
"Why have we been playing better?" asked Holtz. "I think Beuerlein has really played well. He's got more confidence and he's blending in well with the football team." 
On Saturday, of course, it will be critical to Notre Dame's upset chances that Beuerlein have a good day. Although the senior signal-caller had a nightmarish day in the rain at Penn State last season, he has had two of his finest performances against the Lions previously. In 1983, Beuerlein hit 14-of-20 passes for 257 yards, while in 1984 he com­pleted 20-of-28 for 267 yards. Both of those totals were career-bests in yardage. 

Holtz has one more thing to add to the growing list of reasons for the importance of the upcoming matchup with head coach Joe Paterno's Nittany Lions. 
So far we've all heard about the role it will play in deciding Notre Dame's bowl chances, Penn State's bowl choice, Miami's national championship bid, and the financial situation of the Fiesta, Citrus, and Gator Bowls. 
"Notre Dame and Penn State, Notre Dame and Southern Cal, Notre Dame and Michigan," said Holtz, "are all big rivalries that generate a lot of excitement. But because of recruiting it gets in­tense. They're all fine institutions and you recruit against these teams. Because of what's involved there, this game is so crucial."

Remember Faust Fever? It may still be accom­panied by dizziness and nausea in some Irish fans, but not so 300 miles east of here on the campus of Akron. 
The Fighting Zips have rolled up a 7-2 slate so far this season, good enough for a rank of an even No. 100 in this.week's USA Today computer. Just
