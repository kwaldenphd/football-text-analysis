Team morale high despite two losses 
By KELLY SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame t(>Otball is a virtual stranger to failure. And Gerry faust is certainly not ac­t'Ustomeu to losing. So the capacity crowd on hand for Saturday's I :30 kick-off against Michi­gan Statt· will be anxious to sec how the 1-2 Irish pick up the pieces and rebuild. 
"I've told our players they have two choices," ~ays their t·oach Gerry Faust. "They can eithcr give up aftcr thosc two losses and st·ttlc t(Jr an avcragc scason, or they can get up off the ground and kn·p lighting. They can be thc comcha<.:k team of the year." 
llow the lrbh respond to events of the past two wcek~ will tell bust a lot about the l'haractn of his team, as both he and the playcr~ havc come undcr some sharp criticism this weck in papers across thc country, including The Obsen,er, after drop­ping two games in a row. 
"You havc to expect that after you lose," says junior co-captain Phil Carter. "But the team's attitude is very positive. We just want to go out and stop all the talk, just get a win un­der our belt." 
Any loss is tough, but last Saturday's 1 5-14 heartbreaker was especially devastating be­cause Faust feels the team made big strides from the Michigan contest. 
"The Purdue game was a tough, tough loss," 
he confesses. "But one good thing we diu was 
regain the intensity we didn't have against 
.'vtichigan." 
And that intensity is a must to beat a team 
like the Spartans, Notre Dame's third straight 
Big Ten foe. "They're quick, they're physical 
and they're well-coached. They always play 
well against the best teams, and they always 
get up for Notre Dame." 
A key to stopping the Spartans tomorrow will be containing quarterback.John Leister. The junior threw for 204 yards against the Irish a year ago in his college debut. Lt:iste t r boasts 553 yards in the air this season with Hanker Otis Grant and split ends Daryl Turner and Ted Jones his targets. 
"He's a lot like Purdue's Scott Campbell," says Faust. "He can make the big play by either throwing on the run or running himself." 
While the defense must do their part by preventing the big play, Faust says his offense has to start putting more points on the board. He promises the Irish will start to show more flare, once they've established a solid running game. 
"We ran different things at LSU because we felt we could surprise them," he explains. "But against Michigan, there were certain things we tdt we had to do. And at Purdue, there were certain things their defense did that limited us." 
"We'll open things up, but you've got to have the basics down before you do the tricky stuff." 
Faust will put the running game back in the hands of tailback Carter. He turned in a spec-

Oliver and Anderson are playing for kicks 
By SKIP DESJARDIN 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Slowly but surely, Harry Oliver is closing in 
on most of Notre Dame's kicking records. His 
name has been mentioned prominently on 
various all-American lists. 
Less slowly, but no less surely, Morton An­
derson is becoming the most feared kicker in 
college football. He is on the verge ofowning 
all the Michigan State kicking marks, and a 
team of NFL scouts, assembkd by The Sport­
ing News, called him the nation's top place 
kicker. 
This week, the two will match up in Notre 
Dame Stadium, as the Irish take on the Spar­
tans. 
Oliver and Anderson have gone head-to­
head before, with the 5-11 Irish kicker coming 
out on top. His 4-4 performance last season in 
East Lansing was one of the only bright spots. 
in a lackluster Notre Dame victory. Ander­
son's only attempt ofthe game, a 29-yarder, 
was good, but he really didn't get a chance to 
show offhis talents. Nonetheless, Irish 
coaches are well-aware of his ability. 
"That guy is a real threat," admits head coach Gerry Faust. "He adds another dimen­sion to their offense." 
Spartan coach Frank "Muddy" Waters is well-aware of the abilities ofthe Struer, Den­mark native. You can't argue with the facts, and history has proven that Anderson pos­sesses deadly accuracy. 
"Morten is a threat to score for us every time we pas~ midfield," Waters says. "He has been simply sensational in all aspects ofthe game." 
Sensational may not be strong enough a word. Two weeks ago, in a game against Ohio State, Anderson got his name in the Big Ten record books by kicking a 63-yarder. The boot was just four yards shy of the all-time NCAA record. 
Over the course ofhis career, Anderson, who attended Indianapolis' Ben Davis High School on an exchange program, has hit 102 ofthe 105 extra points he has attempted. Still, he is far from satisfied. 
"I must become more consistent on field goals," he says. "That's 85 percent of my game." 
Actually, if he were to check his figures, it's more like half. As a matter offact, it's exactly half. Anderson has kicked 34 field goals, for 102 points. That, along with his 102 poims af­ter touchdowns, gives him a career scoring mark of 204 points, just 26 points shy of the MSU record held by fellow Dane Hans Niel­sen. 
Every Notre Dame fan has heard, by now the legend ofHarry Oliver, and the way his 51­yard kick into the win boosted Notre Dame to a miracle win over Michigan last season. Fewer know about the success enjoyed by An­derson in his only appearance to date in Notre 
Dame Stadium. 
With no time on the clock at the end ofthe 
first half, the Spartan placekicker booted a 53­

"Game of the Century"

"Why didn't you pass, Ara?"-Chicago Tribune. and others. 
The day was November 19, 1966, a little less than I 5 years ago. In that year, there were two No. I teams-Notre Dame and Michigan State, depending on which wire service poll one preferred. 
And, on a cold, dreary South Bend-like day. the two giants squared off in Spartan Stadium in East Lansing to decide who had rightful claim to the bcanstalk. 
Never before had a regular-season college football game captured the attention ofan entire nation like this one did. I 5 years later, it still remains the "game ofthe century." 
Spartan Stadium's capacity is 76,000, but a record 80,011 were squeezed in on this day. The media had it far worse, though; in a press box that was built for 210 reporters, 735 were packed in. On TV, 33 million people watched it on ABC (that, too, was a record). And in Plainville. Conn.. Our Lady of Mercy Roman Catholic Church even changed its normal Saturday confession time so as not to conflict with the end ofthe game. 
It was that big. 

The Irish, under then-third-year coach Ara Parseghian, were listed as four-point favorites, despite being the visiting team and being plagued by numerous injuries to key players. Starting quarterback Terry Hanratty had a separated shoulder, and star tailback Nick Ed­dy was also sidelined and unable to play. 
Despite being the underdogs, Michigan State jumped out to a 10-0 lead in the second quarter following a scoreless first period. A 42-yard pass completion from Spartan quar­

MSU: mixed memories for Carter 
By TIM PRISTER 
!>ports Writer 
Last year's game against Michigan State is one which Phil Carter would like to remem­ber -and forget. The junior co-captain broke Vagas Ferguson's single game rushing record on his 39th carry. However. iL was Carter's -lOth carry that not only cost him the record, but also some very valuable playing time. 
"I didn't even realize l had carried the hall that much let alom: rusht:d. for that many yards," said Carter. "They announced that l had broken the record while I was on sidelines after l had injured my leg." 
What Carter didn't realize was that the an­nouncement was actually incorrect since he had lost two yards on his final carry. 
"I wouldn't hl' telling the truth if! said l wouldn't like 10 break a few records. but I prefer to win. A lot of guys like to set goals for themsel\'cs. which b tine. But it doesn't make any sense to rush for all !hose yards and lose. In a case like !hat a record would be meaning­less." 
A I 000-yard season would have been vir· tually automatic had it not bl·en for the debilitating injury against the Spartans. Diagnosed as a bruise. the extent of the:: injury was considerably more severe than the simple word "bruise" indicates. 
"It was really strange because l walked off the tldd after the game," said Carter. "But when I woke up the next day.! couldn't move my leg. The swelling started up around the thigh and progressed down my leg to my ankle. It was three weeks before I could walk again." 
After missing the next four games, Carter appeared briefly against Georgia Tech and then resumed his heavy workload carrying 60 times in the next two games. 
"I like to carry the hall a lot," said Carter. "If the coach wanted me to carry the ball 50 times a game I would love it. But Coach Faust's offensive philosophy is different from last year. This year our offense is not based around one particularaspect. Teams have to be better prepared to deknse us because we show them more sets and formations. Consequent­ly, it's my job to be prepared when they call on me. since my role won't be as extensive. 

"Last year we didn't do anything fancy. we just ran right at our opponent. They knew our strength and it was simply up to the opposi­tion to stop us." 
"Coach Faust is really an incredible per­son." continued Carter. "He's M> enthusiastic and involved in the offense that sometime's he scares you. You wonder how long his en­thusiasm can last. hut it never stops. He knows the game and has a great awareness ofwhat to call in certain situations. There's always going to be second-guessing by the press but the team has confidence in him. The only second­guessing going on now is the second-guessing ofourselves, the team." 
Part of that varied offensive philo~ophy is the plan to usc the services ofGreg Bdl as well as freshman Chris Smith at tailback, thus keeping fresh. quick backs in at all times. 
"Greg proved himself when I was recover­ing froni a pulled hamstring earlier in the year. He had a great spring and it wouldn't have been fair to throw me in ahead of him when I recovered." 
Bell broke away from relative anonymity when he rushed for 50 yards against Navy, including a 27-yard touchdown romp. According to Carter, though. he knew Bell's capabilities. 
"Greg is a tremendous all-around athlete. He has great speed, he's a good basketball player and could pr(lbably be tough on a baseball diamond. We went fishing at the beginning ofthe year and he evei'l caught more fish than I did," joked Carter. 
"Chris is really going to be a good college tailback. Jiis combination ofspeed and strength makes him doubly effective. Last week he literally ran over two veteran defen­ders on one play.'' 
Carter attracted some attention ofhis own, 
rushing for nearly 2500 yards as a tailback at 
Woodrow Wilson High School in Tacoma, 
Wash!ngton. He was recruited heavily by srveral California schools and especially by the University ofWashington and the Univer­sity ofOregon. Yet it was Notre Dame's assis­tant head coach Brian.Boulac who helped sway his final decision. 
"All the schools out west had me spoiled,"said Carter. "They were constantly calling me and making these extravagant promises like telling me I would start as a freshman. 
"But !liked the challenge that :>Jotre Dame

fullback Regis Cavender to put MSU up. 7-0. Later in the quarter, Raye's 30-yard gallop around end paved the way for a 47-yard tleld goal by the barefooted Dick Kenney, and State was up 10-0. 
Notre Dame struck back before halftime, thanks to the work ofa pair ofbackups. Haltback Bob Gladieux, who replaced Eddy. caugttr a 34-yard TD pass from quarterback Coley O'Brien, who was Hanratty's under­vLudy, to pull the Irish within I 0-7. 
In the second hal( the defense took contnil. Notre Dame's defense, led by all-Americans Jim Lynch and Alan Page, stopped Michigan State on every possession ofthe second halt while the Spartan defensive corps, keyed by 283-pound defensive end Bubha Smith. were nearly equal to the task. In all. the two teams t:ombined for 16 punts on the afternoon. 
On the opening play of the fourth quarter, 
ND'sjoe Azzaro booted a 28-yard field goal to 
tie the game at 10-1 0. In the late stages of the 
contest, Azzaro's bid for glory, a 41-yard field 
goal attempt with 4:41 left, sailed wide to the 
right, and the game remained deadlocked. 
The trouble is, all of the above has now 
been forgotten by most, ifnot all, who wit­
nessed the game. Unfortunately, all that is 
remembered ofthe "game of the century" arc 
seven insignilicant running plays in the last 
minute-and-a-half 
With I :28 to go, and the score still tied at 10, Notre Dame took over, following MSU's eighth punt, at their own 30 yard line. The Spartans put in sevt·n defensive backs, as they fully expected the Irish to pass in order to get into field goal range to pull out the victory. 33,080,744 other witnesses expected the same. 
Instead, Parseghian ran seven straight run­
ning plays, which gained a grand total of 11 
yards and one first down, but were enough to 
waste Michigan State's three remaining 
timeouts and the remaining 1 :28. "We didn't 
play for any tie," Parseghian said after the 
game. "Nobody likes ties. But we weren't 
going to give:: Michigan State a chance of win­
ning in the final minute." 
As the final gun sounded, many boos and calls of"chicken" rained down upon the Irish. "We started yelling at them, things like 'com~ on, sissies,"' said Bubba Smith, no sissy him­self. 
But it was Notre Dame who. in the end. had 
the last laugh. Besieged by criticism for a full 
week after their Michigan State "cop-out," the 
Irish took it out on Southern California the 
next Saturday, 51-0. and t~ventually were 
crowned National Champions in both polls. 
Today. though. it is the "game ofthe cen­
wry" that is remembered most about the 
1966 season. It was a game that featured stel­
lar defensive performances, media hysteria, 
and controversy, the likes of which have not 
been seen in the I 5 years hence. 
But, except for the controvl·rsy. the 
memory has all but faded away.

Excavations at the site of a medieval church have uncovered a number or ancient treasures, including manuscripts and gold artifacts, authorities reported yesterday. Archaeologists said most of the artifacts have come from tombs. One of the most valuable finds at the nearby town of Pratola Serrar is a large gold crucifix inscribed in Latin, the authorities said. While the findings indicate a 7th century construction technique, the archaeologists said they have also come aross many brick formations of Roman style.

Record-high unemployment among blacks 
sent the nation's jobless rate to 7.5 percent in September while more people than ever before accepted part-time work, the Labor Depart­ment said yesterday. Nearly 8 million people were out of work last month -some 309,000 more than the month before -as overall unemployment jumped by three-tenths of a percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistcs said. The proportion ofthe.total U.S. population hold­ing jobs fell to 58.1 percent, the lowest level since December 1980. 
The number of "discouraged workers" -those who have abandoned their job searches -jumped by 1.1 million in the third quarter. The unemployment rate in August was 7.2 percent of the work force, following a decline to 7 percent the month before. This year's highest rate -7.6 percent in May. -was attributed by government analysts to a statistical fluke resulting from earlier-than­expected school closings. The last time unemployment reached 7.5 percent was November 1980. -AP 
Americans are usingcredit cards more frequently than they were earlier this year. But the caution that followed the controls of 1980 still lingers, prompted partly by new fees and high­er interest rates. "We're coming back," said Jim Matthews of Con­tinental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. in Chicago. He said the bank's Visa and MasterCard holders made four percent fewer pur­chases in the first eight months of 1981 than in the corresponding period a year earlier. In January, the number of transactions was almost 22 percent below 1980 levels. Dollar volume has increased -up 2.4 percent for the first eight months ofthe year, but Matthews said, "How much ofthat is due to inflation, I don't know." Like many other banks, Continental now imposes a fcc for the once-free cards. 
The annual charge of S1 5 caused people to be more selective, Mat­thews said. "They quit carrying multiple cards." -AP '

Police publicized the scam on Thursday after four women came forward with their bizarre stories saying they had sex with the strangers. Since then, more than 100 women on Long Island and in New York City called to say they too had been targets of the sexual con man and six more said they had gone through with the scheme. -AP

Union chairman 
Solidarity endorses Walesa 
<iDANSK, Poland (AI') -The Solidarity congress dected Lech Walcsa chairman of the 9. 5 million· memb<:r union yesterday in a strong t·ndorsement of his policy of com­promising with the Polish govern­ment instead of confronting it head 
on. 
Walcsa immediately promised to "try to break down factions" among the rank and file that have divided the year-old free union's first con­vention. He attributed his victory to his record during his unofficial leadership ofSolidarity. 
"Thar,ks for your support," the 38­year-old electrician told the cheer· ing unionists packed inside the Olivia Sports Arena. 
"I'm sorry that some of you 
hacked talk more than action." 
Walcsa easily defeated three other 
candidates. Solidarity announced he 
received 462 of the votes cast, or 
55.2 percent. 
R;u.lkal Jan Rulcwski, whose tlcry c:~mpaign speeches calling ti>r the union to stand up w tht· Sovkts and Polish authoritks had drawn cheer­ing applause, got just 6 percent of tht· vott·. 
\1arian Jurczyk, who heads the Solidarity chapter at the Sczcecin ~hipyards tll·ar the East German bor­der, got 2·l percent of the vote and Andrze (iwiazda, a longtime frn· tradt· union organiz<:r and tht·oretician ti>r Solidarity, got ncar· ly l) pt·rcetll of the vote. The other vote~ apparently were cast for write-ins or ldt blank. 
Walcsa, who had come under bit· ter attack by militants, praised the secret ballot process and promised he would seek the advice ofthe rank 
and file in running the union. 
"Let's follow the road to victory 
with a new tradition of bringing a 
chairman in a sack as opposed to a 
briefcase," he said. His allusion was 
to the old Communist Party system 
of the hierarchy naming party 
congress delegates and members of 
the Central Committee without 
grassroots input. Solidarity mem­
bers who belong to the party this 
year got the authorities to allow 
selection of delegates at the local 
level by secret ballot. 
"The more difficult it gets, the 
more advice I'll ask of you," Walesa 
said. "We can overcome every 
enemy, even ifhighly developed." 
Earlier this week, militant dclgates won passage ofa resolution criticizing Walesa and other leaders who had compromised with the Par­· liament on a bill granting workers some say in p ment. The first session of the congress, which ended Sept. 16, 
voted to demand full say in choosing 
managers and threatened to boycott 
anything less. \\'hen the congress 
reconvened, militants said the 
delegates' will had been ignored. 
Walcsa on Thursday got mild ap­
plause in his speech warning that the 
authorities "have the strength to 
beat us" and threilluting to leave the 
9.5 million-member union if he is ousted from the chairmanship. 
Delegate~ generally regard Walcsa as realistic although some· what dictatorial and the heavy ap­plause given tough-talker Rulewski was seen more as a retlection of the delegates' mood rather than voting intentions. 
The unionists voted earlier yester-

Administration's refugee quota policy, stating that it didn't retlect "reality", or operate within the "spirit ofthe law." 
Posner concluded that the Inter­
diction policy may cause problems 
for the Administration. 
He suggested that the biggest problem about the entire immigra· tion system is the fact that it is to politicized, commenting that the State Department shouldn't be in the "refugee business." 
Ms. Morris explained that there is a plan where an overall refugee coordinator will work outside the State Department, although the plan has not been approved. 
There is pressure in Congress for a the coordinator to be connected directly to the W'hite House, so the refugee policy cannot be used as an instrument of foreign policy and it can be more responsive to domestic Patty Mackay sbou·s tbe intensity ofan lrisb cheerleaderas she went issues, Ms. Morris concluded. tbrougb herroutines a/last night'spep ral(J'.

Big Ten football race heats up 
FREE PARKING CAll (219) 255-3068 FOR RESERVATIONS 
ByJOE MOOSHIL 
Associated Press 
The verr young Big Ten football race resumes today, but already defending champion Michigan and Purdue, the team that has had the best overall record in the con­ference the last three seasons, have their backs against the wall. 
"If we lose again we're out of it," 
said Michigan Coach Bo Schem­
bechler. ''That is a great deal of 
pressure to play under each and 
every week bul we have nobody to 
blame but ourselves." 
The reason is Michigan's earlier 
loss to Wisconsin. Purdue finds itself 
in the same fix because of an unex­
pected loss to Minnesota. 
Both teams will have the added 
burden of being on the road this 
week. Michigan is at Indiana and 
Purdue goes to Wiscon~in to play a 
game which will be televised 
regionally. 
Two other conference games are on the agenda with Minnesota at Il­linois and giant-killer Iowa at Northwestern. Ohio State takes on Florida State and Michigan State is at Notre Dame to clean up noncon­ference action where Rig Ten teams already have a lopsided 13-7 record against.intersectional foes. 
Because of this success against outside foes which includes Iowa victories over Nebraska and UCLA, a pair of triumphs over Notre Dame

observers feel there will be a real race in the Big Ten instead of the usual showdown between Michigan and Ohio State. 
As a result there will be special in­terest in the Minnesota at Illinois and Purdue at Wisconsin games where Illinois and Purdue are very slight favorites. 
And if the situtation comes down 
to going for a tie or a possible win­
loss, Purdue Coach jim Young indi­
cated he might go for a tie instead of 
the two points which lifted Purdue 
past Notre Dame I 5-I4last week. 
"Two losses and you're out of the 
Big Ten race," said Young. "One loss 
and a tic would keep us in the race." 
Young also was concerned about 
Wisconsin's defense led by nose 
guard Tim Krumrie. 
Wisconsin Coach Dave McClain 
called Purdue "An excellent football 
team. I think we're equally matched 
and the breaks should determine the 
game." 
Illinois rested last week. The Illini 
opened the season with a loss at 
fourth-ranked Pitt before knocking 
off Michigan State and Syracuse. In 
Minnesota, the Illini will be facing 
the only Big Ten team other than 
Ohio State that is undefeated. 
Michigan and Iowa are heavily favored but Iowa coach Hayden Fry is bothered by the rash of injuries suffered in the UCLA triumph. Nevertheless, the Hawkeyes should hand Northwestern its 24th straight defeat which would be four shy of the NCAA record of 28 shared by Kansas State and Virginia. 
Fry also is aware that Northwes­tern coach Dennis Green went to Iowa and said ''I'm sure Coach Green would enjoy nothing more than beating his alma mater."

Junior Kathy Ray also continues to get better. according to Galen. Ray leads the team in scoring and savs of the season so far, "I'm really cx~ited by all this. It'~ our best start ever in my three years here and it's just great. We also have the most skill ever and thl· most enthusiasm.

"On top ofthis season's success so far," Ray continues. "we have no seniors on the squad so next season looks even better." Other strong 
players include sophomores Clare 
Henry and Karen Koro\vicki. along with junior Deborah Raehl. who never played tldd hockey before she came to Nmre Dame. 
Galen is pleased with the fresh­men she has, but is most impressed with Mary Urn, Katherine Wagner and :-Aichele Rooney. "llrn is showing a lot of promise," Galen says. "Wagner is an excellent player, 
and Rooney is as \Veil, with two sis­ters playing here before her." With ten more matches, including one tomorrow against Indiana at I I 
a.m. on Cartier Field, Galen seems confident that her team will do well. Since there are only three Division II field hockey teams in Indiana, the Irish already have an automatic berth into the regional tournament. 
If they are successful there, they will advance to the national finals the weekend ofNovember 22. Galen feels an October 18 match at Colgate will provide a good guage o t f how successful the team will be on the national level, since Colgate was second in the nation last season in Division II. 
"'I think we'll do real well," Galen comments. "\X"e have a much im­proved team from last vcar and a tremendous amount of talent."

..... 
Second-year tidd hockey coach jan Galen has developed an excd­lent squad this season, having opened with a 7-4 record in its first thret:: weeks of play. 

Galen rt:turned eight starters from last year's squad, and added to that group tive on-campus recruits, three transfers, tive freshmen, and one;: girl 
who had been abroad last year in Paris. "We have a young group with promising depth," says Galen, ''and should produce;: a strong team. We learned a lot in camp, including a new systt:m, and improved there as well. We have a fine front line, and an excellent defense." 
Opening the seaso.n with such a flurry of victories did ·not surprise Coach Galen. but the margin of vic­tory in the early matches did. "I knew we had improved from last season." ~he comments, '"but until W<:.bt:at Kalamazoo 9-0, I had no id<:a how substantial our improve;:ments w<:rc, since we only beat th<:m 1-0 laM yt:ar." 
This te;:am abounds with outstand­ing individual players, such as junior 
-co-captain Giana Marron<:. Marrone leads the squad with two assists and has contributt:d to the;: team's excd­lt"nt front line. 
Galen says of Marrone, "Sh<: has displayt:d tine footwork and really needs no coaching. She works so hard, she <:ven came to me at the t::nd of last season and wantt:d her stick back to practice with in th<: off­season." 
Othe;:r outstanding players in· elude )<:anne Grasso, the team's Most Valuable Player last year. Galen says that Grasso's skills continue to improve and '"she gives the whole team a sense of contidence when sh<:'s hack there on defense."

1Rebounding from Purdue;preparing for MSUI 
.. 
There's not much a coach can do or say to ease the pain 
after the heartbreaking loss we suffered at Purdue last Satur­
day. It was a game ofemotional highs and lows for both teams 
and for us it ended on the lowest possible note. 
What made the defeat so difficult to accept was that our 
players showed such great determination in driving 50 yards 
in only 57 seconds for the go-ahead touchdown only to be 
stunned minutes later by a series ofgreat plays by Purdue and 
some last second heroics by Scott Campbell and Steve 
Bryant. 
On our own drive it took Phil Carter, our fine tailback, just 
three plays to go half the length of the football field. His tina! 
30 yards for the touchdown was an excellent display of his 
running ability. Unfortunately. Phil has seen limited action so 
far this year because ofa pulled hamstring he suffered on the 
first day offall practice. 
Purdue, ofcourse, must be given a world ofcredit for the way they were able to travel 80 yards in almost two-and-one half minutes, and to their quarterback Scott Campbell for coming up with the key plays that kept the drive alive. His final two passes, one for the touchdown and the other for the two-point conversion, were picture perfect. And when you consider all the pressure he was under in both situations, his performance becomes all the more remarkable. 
As some can imagine, our lockerroom was a solemn place following the game. Everyone had that empty feeling that comes after losing a close, hard-fought game. It is a feeling that stays with you until you win again. It is also a feeling that should serve as extra motivation for the next game. 
I felt in the second half we moved the ball rather consis­


tently but we just couldn't get it into the end zone. Four 
times we had the ball inside Purdue's 35-yard line and didn't 
get any points. and we·ve got to do better than that. 
Defensively, we have to tighten up things and get a little 
more pressure on the quarterback. Our secondary didn't do a 
bad job ofcovering but we;: gave Campbell too much time and 
he often made the play good by either throwing on the run or 
running himself. Even so, we did some good things at times. 
We stopped Purdue three times on fourth down, and even 
when they got down to our,one-yard line in the last minute of 
the game, we got great efforts on the tirst three downs, even 
pushing them back seven yards. But Campbell's fourth down 
pass play was the bt::ginning of the end. 
This week we will be playing Michigan State, our third Big 
Ten team in a row and the first of five consecutive home 
games in the next six weeks. 
Michigan State's quarterback, john Leister, is much the same kind ofplayer that Purdue's Campbell is, so our secon­dary and defensive line will again be severely tested. So far this season, Leister has completed 42 of 93 passes for ·553 yards and he has some excellent receivers in Daryl Turner. 
Ted jones and Otis Grant. 
O~te ofour big concerns, however, will be the health ofour defensive unit since there arc some starters still on the doubtful list because ofinjuries. Two ofthe players. lineback­er joe Rudzinski and deti:nsive end Pat Kramer misst:d the Purdue game and may not he r<:ady to play this week. Two others, defensive tackle Bob Clasby and cornerback john Krimm, may have to sit out our game against the Spartans. Offensively, we will be without the services of left guard Randy Ellis, who was unable to make the trip last week, and Dave Condeni. our split end who underwent surgery Sunday after sustaining a knee injury in last Saturday's game. 
Because there are a number of doubtful performers we will in all likelihood move other players up from the junior varsity team. We were able to get a numbt:r of these players some playing time last Sunday when they played against the Purdue reserves. Playing a four or tlve game schedule gives the junior varsity actual playing experience, the kind of ac­tion they normally cannot get during pranicc week. Our coaches then have an opportunity to vit:w the films and arc able to check on the progress ofeach player. advancing those that demonstrate they are capable ofhdping out in positions that need added depth on the varsity. It also give!> the players something to look forward to after putting in a lot of work helping to prepare the varsity for an upcoming game. The fun ofplaying in a game at any level is the reward for all the time spent on the practice Held. 
The game following a ·defeat becomes a double challenge for any team. Not only does i/ have to overcome the op­ponent, but there's the further challenge to prove to itself that it can overcome adversity. Good teams do both.

135 years 
Band celebrates anniversary 
By ROBERT WALSH 
Sports Writer 
The Marching Band of the Fighting lrish is celebrating its 135th anniversary ofcon­tinuous existence. The band has experienced a memorable and eventful past. The 1981 ver­sion looks forward to continuing that tradi­tion with the sense ofcohcsivencss and enthutiasm that has long been typical ofNotrc Dame bands. The first documented evidence ofa Notrc Dame band dates back to commencement of 1846. The band has played at "the circle" at the entrance of thc Univer­sity for students leaving in every war since thc Civil War. It played a bcnctlt concert for the victims of the Chicago Firc in 1871 and the band was giving conccrts for years before Theodore Thomas cstablished the Chicago Symphony Orchcstra. 
In 1887 Notrc Dame played its first football game and the band was on hand, and the group has not missed a home game since. The Notrc Dame band was among thc first in the United States to perform percision drills and picturc formations during the prc-game and halftime ft:stivities. 
Saint Mary's girls were added to the mcm­bcrship in 1970 and the group expanded its cocducational policy whcn thc University bcgan admitting women in 1972. The band was dcclarcd a "Landmark ofAmerican Music" in 1976 by the National Music Council and the Indiana Music Educators Association. Thus it is easy to see how rich a tradition the organization has. 
Thc prcsent director is Dr. Robert O'Brien, who has been the man in charge sincc 1952. The faculty assistant dircctor is Mr. Jamcs Phil­lips who received that appointment in 1965. 
Seniorjoe Wren is this year's president. He feels one ofthe most important factors ofthe Marching Band is unity. "The band here al­ways has been a highly spirited group," When says, "and this is because of the unity ofband members. This year we have 220 in the Marching Band, including 65 freshmen. We try to plan various functions among band members to try to promote togetherness." 
Wren says the band will continue to strive ' 
for excellence while planning a few new 
things. "We've already played at Michigan, 
and ofcourse we'll continue to play at all the 
home games and a possible bowl game if the 
Irish arc selected. We're always expanding 
our program. In fact, during this week's game 
against Michigan State, we plan on using a new
