Holtz shares steps to success 
By ANNE MARIE MATTINGLY 
Associate News Editor 
Them arc seven primary qualilios that comprise a happy and successful pnrson, said Lou 1loltz. form1)r Nolrn Dame foot­ball coach, in a lccturn Tuesday. 
"My philosophy is very, very simple, and basically covers seven simple points," lrn said i11 J'ront ol' a packed crowd, com­prisml mostly of' students. 'The first 01w is tlrn most important choicn you make every day. It's tlrn altitude you have." 
l loltz said that whether or not a person is content with his or her lifn is determined bv atti­tude. · 
"You can be happy or sad. Thul.'s a choice," he said. "You can succeed or fail. You can believe or· doubt, pray or curse .. . Life is a maW)r of choicns." 
Holtz explained that peopl11 are ultimately responsible l'or their happiness through the dncisions thny makn. 
"Whatever situation you !ind yourslllf' in, either good or bad, it's becausn ol' the choices you made," he said. "Altitude is a choicn." 
Ilnltz said that taking pride in making sacrificns is the second means to a succnssful life. 
"You cannot be anything with­out making sacrifices. That's the thing about Notre Dame," he said. "You conw here to get an education on how to make a liv­ing, but also an education on how to live. The second one might be morn important than the first ... If people think you do anything easy, they're wrong." 
A deep-rooted desire to

part of becoming successful, 
said Holtz. 
"You have to havn a passion to win, a passion to s11cceed," he said. "I never asked our athletes how many of them wanted to win. I asked them, 'Can you live with losing? Can you live with failure? Can you live with medi­ocrity?' ... Because if you can't, you'll do whatevnr you have to do in order to succeed." 
Notre Dame places a strong emphasis on excellence and the members of the Notre Dame

¦ INSIDE COLUMN 
Anger is a Gift 
Does the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., make you angry? I'm so enraged that it makes me sick. 
Why did it happen? What possessed those 
young men to destroy so many innocent lives? What made them so angry'! 
The list of questions goes on and on and the impossibility of acceptable answers shreds my conscious 

rationale. Mike Romanchek 
I'm torn because my News Copy Editor 
natural response is the 
same emotion that drove them to do what 
they did. 
"Anger is a gift," according to Zack de la 
Rocha of Rage Against the Machine. At 
times, justice emerges from passionate, 
anger-driven movements. I believe this. 
Then something like Tuesday's atrocity 
happens. How can the gift of anger be bene­
ficial when it is all too often destructive? 
Maybe I spend too much time listening to 
a band that supports "just, armed struggles 
for democracy" and socialism. Or maybe de 
la Rocha is right and anger can help. 
Anger is a gifi. when it is utilized in a 
manner that is not toxic to others. lt moti­
vates people to action when action is neces­
sary. 
So rather than asking unanswerable 
questions, ask yourself what you can do to 
make a difference. What will you do to pre­
vent that which makes you angry? 
Whatever your cause, whatever it is that 
makes your gut twist, do something about 
it. 
Do not sit on the sidelines and be a pas­
sive observer. We often think that tragedies 
and evil only happen to others when in 
reality we are as vulnerable as the next 
person. 
I was reminded of this Tuesday when the 
news reported that over 20 students were 
gunned down at a high school less than an 
hour away from the one I attended. I saw 
students running for their lives towards 
athletic fields that I once played on. I saw a 
community that closely resembled the one I 
grew up in devastated by three angry young 
men. 
At this point in time I'm not sure what 
exactly I'm going to do. 
I wish I had an easy answer. I wish the 
murderers had not had access to the 
weapons they used. I wish someone would 
have listened to the young men before they 
became killers. 
Unfortunately, in this situation, wishing is 
an action of the past and will not change 
what has happened. It is now time to work 
for the future. 
It is now time to put the anger to work. If 
it is sweatshops, civil rights abuses. home­
lessness. deforestation, domestic violence 
or school yard massacres that enrage you, 
make a difference. Educate yourself and 
others, join a movement organization that 
you believe in, inspire people to join your 
crusade and make a difference. 
We have all worked hard to be where we 
are today at these wonderful schools, and it 
is a privilege to receive the education they 
provide. But we must continue to work 
hard, not only for ourselves but for others 
as well. Use your anger. Detoxify the anger 
and use it to your advantage.

Miami of Ohio, BYU and New Mexico to cut men's sports 
NEW HAVEN, Conn. 
When Jason Woodland visited col­leges, he was looking for a school where he could wrestle competitive­ly and also find a stellar education. But after his first college season, the Miami University freshman knows he has wrestled his last inte.rcolle­gi.ate match. 
Miami University of Ohio, Brigham Young University and the University of New Mexico all decided in the past month lo cut men's sports teams. · Administrators cited financial and competitiveness concerns, but ath­letes and coaches said Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 caused the universities to unfairly close a total of eight men's teams and no women's teams. Title IX requires colleges and universities receiving federal funds to provide equitable opportunities in athletics 


Miami is cutting wrestling, tennis and soccer. and BYU and UNM will close their gymnastics and wrestling teams. UNM will cut men's swim­ming as well. 
Only Miami blamed the cuts specif­ically on Title IX. Fifty-five percent of Miami students are female, but women now comprise only 42 per­cent of intercollegiate athletes and receive only 31 percent of athletic scholarship money; 
In a statement, Miami officials said the university could not meet fed(1ral gender equity requirements without cutting men's sports teams. 
"The bottom-line concern is bud­getary," said trustees in the state­ment. 
"Miami cannot remain competitive in 22 sports on a budget appropriate for 17-18 sports and still meet Title IX requirements." 
Officials at BYU and UNM, who arc both members· of the newly-created Mountain West Conference, said they cut sports in which they could not remain competitive as part of the new athletic league, 
Carri Jenkins. BYU's director of media communication, said when other schools closed their wrestling and men's gymnastics teams, BYU's teams ceased to be viable. 
"In an indirect way !Title IXJ did come to bear on BYU's decision," Jenkins said. 
¦ INOIANA UN!VERSITV Fraternity 'bonds' through branding 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. 
The smell of burning flesh and the idea of scorching skin might sound frightening to a majority of the greek system. But for most of the members of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. it is a part of life. They are following a long tradition, mostly of African-American fraternities -getting branded. For the Phi Beta Sigma brothers, branding a "sigma" into their arms is a symbol of their brotherhood. "It is traditional, but not mandatory," Phi Beta Sigma member Ramone Demming, a senior, said. Demming received his first brand in 1994 on his left arm with his line, a kind of pledge class. Since then he has received four more brands. "[I got a brand] at first out of pride, then, sort of like tattoos, they got a tad addictive," Demming said. Demming's fraternity brother, junior Damien Piatt, also chose to get a brand. "It was significant because we all got them together," Piatt said. "It was a hell of a bonding experience." 
¦ UNIVERSITY Of ILUNOIS Jury convicts former bouncer of murder 
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 
A Champaign County jury found former Gypsy bouncer Robert Jurkacek guilty of first-degree murder but acquit­ted his former co-worker and roommate, Rubin Navarette, of the same charges Monday in connection with the death of University doctoral student Ernest Seri. Testimony in the trial, which began April 12, ended Friday when Jurkacek and Navarette took the stand in their own defenses. The jury apparently believed Navarette's con­tention that he acted only to break up a fight between Seri and Jurkacek. Jurkacek claimed his actions were merely self-defense, saying Seri had started the fight on the night of June 25. Much of the trial focused on the final blow to Seri -a kick to his face delivered by Jurkacek -who said he kicked Seri because he feared that Seri was bend­ing down to pick up something off the ground that could be used against him in a fight. 

¦ lJNtVERSlTY OF MICHIGAN Officials make 'Naked Mile' safer 
ANN AHB0R, Mich. 

What do you get when you take an innocent jog through town. add drunk euphoria and hundreds of University seniors on the verge of graduation and subtract their cloth­ing? The answer -the Naked Mile, a time-honored tradi­tion celebrating the end of the semester and the end of col­lege for many students. But in recent years, the size and safety of the famous run have come into question, prompting some students to take actions they hope will make the run safer for everyone involved. Michigan Student Assembly Nursing Rep. Jen Seamon said because the Naked Mile now attracts national attention, the crowds of spectators are more unruly than ever. This behavior, she said, can jeopar­dize runners' safety. Seamon has recruited morn than 200 volunteers who will line the runners' path to lookout l'or safety hazards and communicate with other organizers by walkie-talkie in case someone is injured. 
¦ UN1vrnsnv OF Missoum 
Prof steps down after anti-gay remark 
COLUMBIA, Mo. 

Sharon Wright, the University or Missouri associate pro­fessor some students accused of making anti-gay com­ments in her class, will not teach Political Science 341, Women and the Law, for the rest of the semester. On March 29, Wright agreed with a student who said she would feel uncomfortable having her childrnn associate with children of homosexual couples. Wright did not teach political science on Monday and will not teach it for the final two weeks or the semester. Wright said she has been misquoted to this point, and that she is being used as a martyr. "Some people want to use me as a symbol f'or big­otry," she said. "There arc some people on this campus who need to decide if they really want diversity." Wright said she agreed with the student to play "devil's advocat,1 and encourage discussion." Wright said MU has advislid her not to comment on her decision.

With llall's senior yPar com­ing to a close, one can only wonder what will happen next. 
"I plan on touring this sum­mer and then turning pro," IIall said. ''I'll stick to smaller tournaments at first, and hope­f'u lly progress from tlwrc. It takes Lime to get started on the tour." 
Fittingly. Dasso plans on playing with llall this summer. They plan on taking tlwir dou­bles talents to tlw pro levels and seeing how thny stack up. 
''I'm certain that Jen will do vnry well at the pro levd She's modest. but I know that she'll excel," Dasso said. 
Dasso seemed content wlwrn she is now. 
"That's a long ways away," Dasso said. "At this point, I can't ewn stand to think about Jen leaving."

Ramb.ler catc11er Jackie Geraci then hit a slow ground­ball to shorlstop Mel Alkire. who was unable to forcP the runner at the plate. 
The next batter grounded out but still managed to scorn the runner on third base. The two runs gave the Hamblers a 2-1 lead into the fourth inning. 

Alkire stepped to the plate in the bottom of the fourth and hit her seventh home run of the year to tie the game at two runs apiece. The rest of the game would be a pitcher's duel as neither pitcher surrendered another run through the sev­enth.

The story ofa lifelong love affair with the movies, CINEMA PARADISO tells of a young boy in a small Italian village, where the only puslimc is a visit lo the movies at the Cinema Paradiso. Enchanted by the 0ick,cring images, Salvatore yearns for the secret of the cinema's magic and is overjoyed when Alfredo, the projectionist, agrees lo reveal the mysteries of movie making to him.

It's funny how those Oilers s.tHiwon theStanley Cup·in 1990 without Wayne, who had left t)loJe.amJo.r Los Angelos and more money long before. But before we get to team loyalty, let's consider the host thore ever was: none other than Mario Lemieux. 
t~mloux. w4sselecte.d as lhe lirst player overnll in the 1984 NHl. entry draft because the Pittsburgh Penguins wore the worst tea.min the league the year before. Playing with no-names for yea.ts, Lemieuxracked up points like no other. He didn't need superstar linemates -he. MADE other players bettor. But Letnielp( willtell you his greatest achievement was taking the worst team and in seven years carrying them to the top of the h<lciey mountain in winning two consecutive Stanley Cups. Ho battled chronic back pain the whole time and never played a full NHL season {if he had, he surely would have challenged some of Wayne's sacred records). After the two championships, Lemieux Was diagnosed with cancer and even sat out a full season before 
· · ·· eventually playing one 
more and retiring as the only player ever (not even Gretzky can add this to his resume) to average better than two points por game for his career. Wayne played almost exactly twice as many 
games as Lemhmx, and it's a shame that hockey fans will never get to see Lemieux track down those 61 records. 
Gretzky never had to battle injury or health problems, and he never had to deal with less than all-star talent on his teams. And it still took "The Great One" and his Oilers four sea.sons to beat tho Islanders and final1y win the Stanley Cup. Then Gretzky left for more money In L.A., and then he left L.A. for more money in St. Louis, and then to New York for -you guessed it -more money. Lemieux was drafted by Pittsburgh and the lifotime Penguin's jer­sey number 66 will forev­er hang in the Civic Arena.

Bf\ing into anything like karate. drprf\ssed hip­pir.s, Dodge Carasans, the Long Island Expressway, high school proms, VViunebagos, the Jersey shore, astf>roids, Korn or pianos falling oul of windows, checking out Uw new album by Fountains of Wayne is a must. This quartet of pop­rockers deals with all of these suhjocts and more on Hs recently released album entitled Ctopi,t Park,.,ay. The CD marks its second release in two. yP-ars, and has bren called a "pop masterpiece" by Detour Magazine. Named after a slOre in Fountain, N . .J., these New York-based performers mix the sounds of Weewr. the Bea.tics and Teenage Fanclub. The band's press packet notes that "tlrnre are hints of everything from '60s icons like thP Zombies. th!' Bvrds and Simon a.nd Garfunkel: '70s AOTT dinosaurs like Steve Miller; laud I early New Wave stars like Devo and the Cars." A,·conling to Spin Magazine, "Fountains of Wayne are a 'fJ0s version of the onc-hil woudcrs in the movie 'That Thing You Do."' In fact. ]Pad singer/songwriter Adam Schlesinger wrote the movie's theme song. !n supµort of their first album. th() Smashing Pumµkins included the group on tour. Utopia Parkway is full of catchy chords and lyrics. In the midst of this bubbly pop rock, Schlesinger and co­vocalist Chris Collingwood sing such ear-pleasing lyrics as: "Will you stop pretending I've never been born / Now I look a little more like that guy from Korn." The album conveys the "songs from suburbia" sentiment 

with ballads or leenagm·s driving throllgh "Tlw VallPy of the Malls" on their way to lrnar Pink Floyd at tho "Laser Show." 
The album contains a token s11ppy lovP song. In "Denist)," tlJP. harmonious voc,ilists sing, "I know this girl named Denise/ She makns mo wnak in tho knc<>s ... ! lrnard slrn usf'd to Im marrind/Slw listl)ns to 1'1dT Daddy."

The music scene has become downtrodden with the rise of new classifications of music. Most people cannot even tell what most of the new categories actually mean. Prom grunge to alternative to acid jazz to sissy junk -does anybody know what happened to good old rock 'n' roll? There is a band that still plays rock 'n' roll -the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion (jSbXI. \lever heard of it? Well if not from the East Coast, it is not very sur­prising. Hailing from New York City, jSbX has been playing its own blend of blues, soul, rhythm and blues, punk, rockabilly, high-energy rock and rap since 1990. The band is unique with two guitars, drums and one of the best blues shouters. Jon Spencer. Spencer, whose vocal range is a Presley-Jaggar melange, is as emphatic and tension-filled as all the great blues singers, despite being born well above the Mason­Dixon Line. The band has continually transformed itself and has continued to evolve through its many influences. Its 1998 release, Acme, which is quite possibly one of the best albums of the year, transformed the band once again from a groove-laden, extremely danceable form of soul. blues, rap and R&B into a genuine form of fun-loving rock 'n' roll. This blues explosion may seem

very new and very bizarre if never heard before. 
The band's most recent release, Extra-Acme, a col­lection of b-sides from the Acme LP and alternate mixes, brings the band back to its well-established roots in blues, with the high energy that is seen on its earlier albums. Most of th(e tracks that are included on Extra-Acme shed a tot of the post-production elements of Acme and bring the band back to guitar rock. What is surprising is that a track like "Wait a Minute" did not make it on Acme. One thing is for sure, though: jSbX and its Extra-Acme is reassurance that rock ·n· roll is still alive and well.

Although his abilities had remained in tact, Nas· rhvmes were filled with a little more glamour and glitz· lhan his devoted rans had hoped. He was no longer prophetic; he was a playing star. Nas is "all races combined in nnc man / like tho '99 summer jam I bullet proof llumnrnr Man" as lie elo­quently put it on "Nas is Like," the first single from his long-awaited third release, I Am ...

League makes deal for franchise in L.A. Coliseum 
I.OS ANGELES 
l11 what could be the NFJ.'s lirst Sl billion deal for a stadium and franchise. tlw league wants to put a team back in tho Los 1\ngelf's Colis<'um. 
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue made it official Tu0sdav that thti 76-vear-old stactiuin" is t.lH'. leag11e~s choict1 for its :~2nd franchise. 
Yet to bP dntermino<l is who will own tlw team -developer Fd Boski and his New Coliseum Partners, or llollvwood deal­maker :vlichael ·ovitz. who Pnrlorsed the Colisernn last wef'k after abandoning his proposal for a new stadium in suburban Carson. 
Tagliabue did not rule out othf'r potential ownership groups emerging. 
At a Coliseum news confer­
ence. the cornmissionAr also said 
the l0ague·s team owners decid­
t>d against holding an auction 
for the expansion frnnc:hisf', and 
instead will set a price. 
Saying tho aim was to make 
tho New Coliseum a reality, 
Tagliabue addAd, "If WA suc­
ceAd in doing that. WA will he• 
talking about a project that will 
involve. in round numbers. $1 
billion of invl"stment. in tArms of 
the stadium. the Exposition Park 
area [site of the stadium] and 
the ownership of the team." 
The league owners voted 29-2 
last month to award the expan­
sion team to the Los Angeles 
area. the nation's second­
biggest TV market, on a condi­
tional basis. They set a Sept. 15 
deadline for reaching agreement 
with whatpver site and group 
thev chose for the team.

a deal can't be reached in Los

going tu have  an  auctfon, and  
tlrny've given  us  some guide­ 
lin~s. " noski said.  

He had thought the new fran­chise was going to go to the highest bidder. 
"Of all the things said today. I think that (a sPt price) was one of the best things we could hear." he sairl. 
Although there has been spec­ulation Roski and his backers would unite with Ovitz anrl hi group to get a franchise, Ovitz said, "I don't know anything about putting tho groups togeth­er. I know what we've been charged with individually. Wt>. both had separate meetings this morning. 
"You dirnrlv hearrl what thf' commissioner ~aid, which is that he wants to focus on a business plan and a public-private part­nership. They made the decision that they want to try to develop the Coliseum, and as far as I'm concerned, that's fantastic." 
Tagliabue seemed to think other groups joining the pursuit of a franchise \Vas remote, and noted Roski and Ovitz have a significant head start because of the work they've already done. 
"If other people with similar qualifications were to knock on my door or the mayor's or Mark's door. I think they ought to at least be heard," the com­missioner said, referring lo ol' laxes in California sitH'.P i'ornrnr lamllill i11 Carson, somP !\favor Hicbard Hiordan and someono namnd .Jarvis canrn on 12 miIns south of' the Colismrm. coti'ncilman Mark Hidley­tlw natinnlll scene."

what is the hnst way soci;t!ly and ni:onomically to go about doing that." 
"I think l'nrf'orma mighl think tlwy am taking into account how much students f'npl tlwrn is a rwnd !'or a new studPnt center but I'm not so surf' tlwy arr-," said Siefort. "I sen building on lo tlrn dining hall and Cl'('ating a studPnl cnntnr tlwrn as the only way to achi1wn what we am looking for." 
One of the P<!rl'orma scenario!,; s11gg1)Stnd turning the first floor of' Ln Mans llall, which !'urrnnt.ly servns as a residemce hall and honrn to adrninistra­tivo officos. as a student conlnr. 
"Turning Urn lirsl lloor of Lo Mans into a sturfnnl centnr is not thn answer," said Sinfnrl. "You can't have a studnnt center in a building wlrnrn lhrn·n ar<! quint hours, where there is only one nnt.nu1cn a(·.<·ns­siblc at night f'or security rnasons lrnrausP il is a rnsidnnco hall and whnrn you can't. havP loud noisn and music b<icause ther·e are residents living on all the other lloors." 
Perl'orma also suggnsted moving classrooms to 1loly Cross I!all which once served as a classroom building, emphasizing the importance or historical use or space. 
"I don't think that is tlw answnr," said Sicfort. "I think Madeh1va la currnnl classroom building! is an awesomo plare to have classes. We should updatn Madcleva tnchnologically." 
Another idea suggested by Pnrforma in o,w ol' llw sr,enarios was moving administrative of'lkes to lloly Cross flail for a numb1)r of reasons, one of whicl1 is that lloly Cross llall is tlrn first building pcrnpln SOP as thoy drive up the Avenue.

Coppedge says wealth produces democracy 
By JACKJE OSTROWSKI News Writer 
The movement of democratic ideas and their magnitude of change on a country is largnly a !'unction or timing. wealth and depth, according to government professors Michael CoppC'clgr. and Dan Brinks. 
"The movement of ideas and institutions is most­ly undefined," said Brinks in a JC'eture on Tuesday. 
In an effort to better define these ambiguities. Brinks and Coppedgfl display,,d sevpral graphs that chartrd positive and negativn correlations of idea diffusion being a function of wealth. 
Past studies or this subject hav1! had a t,mdency to underestimate tho importanco of' a country's population, said Coppedge. 
''[This new model] is a way of' smoothing out the impact of population so it's not linear." said Brinks. CoppHdge and Brinks designed a math­ematical equation that puts more weight on thn impact of population on diffusion. 
The results of their findings were signilicantly different from previous studies. 
"There an, some periods wlrnre countries am more likely to changn than others," said Coppedge. 
The years J989 to 1992 were given as examples when chnngn was much more liknly. 
Besides timing, wealth and diffusion dotermine the magnitude of change a country experiences. Lnrgcr countries have a higher probuhility of' changing to a democratic style of government. from one year to the next, according to Coppedge and Brinks. 
"Economic dAvelopmont makes countries stay put." said Coppedge, ci(lmonstrating that the wealthier a country is, the less likely it is to chang,:1 its style. 
They concluded that a country surrounded by democratic nations is more likely to change in a democratic direction than a country nnighbornd by non-domocratic countries. 
Coppedge and Brinks' lecture. titled "Patterns of Diffusion in the Third Wave or IJ111nocratization.'' was held in tho llosburgh C<mtor l'ur International Studies.

sought lo win an offer to coach at the L'nivrrsity. 
The segue launched into a doc­tored video of Conan O'Brien­esque talking heads rrpresenting Holtz and Hcsburgh. The skit poked fun at a demanding and impatient llesburgh and drew laughs from much of the audi­ence, especially its student mem­bers. 
1[oltz was the focus of the Life Treatment Centers' first roast thren years ago, and admitted the especially harmless naturf'I of Hesburgh's roast Ttwsday night. 
"I was roasted here two yPars ago and it wasn't anything like this. Priesthood is a good deal." lloltz joked. 
King. widow of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, was the evening's last roaster, and she squarely identified the diffi­culty in roasting Ilesburgh. 
"llow do you poke fun at a priest, especially n lender of his stature'?" King asked, before sharing some or her memories of llesburgh. 
She complimented him for achievements in r.ivil rights, nuclear disarmament, human rights and third-world develop­mem. 
"Lnt's see, not much grist for humor there." King admitted, before labeling Hesburgb "a sort of poster boy for 'overachievers anonymous."' Ilesbm·gh holds 139 honorary degrees -a world record -and has served 15 presidential appointments. 
"T wanted to personally thank you for your support of the civil rights movement." King told the man who served 15 years on the 
U.S. Civil Rights Commission. "With great adulation and respect, I gather with those here tonight to celebrate your dedica­tion to a more compassionate and humane society." 
Philanthropist Joan Kroc was another attendee with similar misgivings about roasting Hesburgh. She instead compli­mented his example of "toler­ance, good will and forgivancc." The widow of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc did take the occasion, however, to criticize Notre Dame's decision to add a Burger King to campus. 
Arthur Decio, University bene­factor, also expressed reluctance at the idea of roasting Hesburah. 
'Tm here with the best and the b1ightest friends of old and new, all for a great cause, but [ still can't make fun of Father Ted " Decio said. "The lady on the Dome blesses him and through him she blesses us." 
Former president Gerald Ford offered his wishes via video. He remarked on similarities he shares with llesburgh as a retired president and reminisced about a visit he made to Notre Dan~c on Saint Patrick's Day in 197:) -during a post-Vietnam, post-Watergate era when presi­dents rarnly visited r.ollcge cam­puses. 
He also spoke al.iout Ht1sburgh's work on the Presidents Clemency Board that rnviewed dralt dodgers and said Ilesburgh·s contributions made for "an unforgettable lesson in the forgiving business.

thanks for God, country and Notre Dame," Ford concluded. 
Columnist Ann Landers shared a story about the first time she met Hesburgh, in Phoenix in 1955. 
"His hair was jet black and so was mine. He's still sensational but now his hair is white and now I'm a blonde," Landers remarked. 
Jim Frick spent a 38-year <'arner 11,t Notre Dame, and his role in public relations kept him busy traveling with Hesburgh and provided ample roasting material. 
"Traveling with Father Ted can be very difficult because he's a night owl," Frick began. "Ile comes alive at 9 p.m., his feel nevPr touch the floor before nine or 10 in the morning and he stays up until two or three in the morning." 
Frick shared stories about traveling with a less-than-ami­able Hesburgh to early morning breakfast engagements, includ­ing one during which an irritat­ed 1-fesburgh was forced to meet with benefactors with a hole in his pants that Frick later had to mend. 
"J wasn't awarr mending the prnsident's pants was included in the job description for ,ice presidrnt." Frick said with a chuckle. 
Current vice president of UniYcrsitv relations William Sexton agreed that Jfesburgh was able to handle a diverse set of fundraising demands.

''I-Ie's a good fisherman and a good closer," Sexton shared. "I don't believe there's a person in this room who hasn't got a story about their prayers being answered or being helped by the work of this man." 
Former president Jimmy Carter offered his sentiments via a letter Holtz read to the audi­ence. Carter praised Hesburgh's role as a "public sPrvant, acade­mic innov,1,tor ... and global ambassador for tolerance and peace." 
Father Edmund Joyce, Hesburgh's right-hand man for 35 years as executive vice presi­dent. also shared memories of working with Hesburgh. A cross­country, post-retirement trip in an ITV provided framework for many of .Joyce's recollections. 
"Father Ted established a rou­tine of giving Mass every day in this van and giving each other homilies on alternate days. That's an experience few ha.ve had," Joyce noted. 
At evening's end, Hesburgh offered a warm thanks to those who came to toast him and help raise money for Life Treatment Center. 
'Tm deeply grateful to all of these good folk, not just for com­ing from so for tonight, but for being there over the years," Hesburgh said. "They're hem not because they're famous peo­p1e but because they're good people.... You're good and your goodness has sustained me. Many, many thanks."

than four hours aft.er the attack. Sheriffs spokesman Steve Davis said that suspe<'t was believed to be a friend of the gunmen but did riot take part in the attack. 
Wes Lammers, 17, was among several students who said the gunmen were targeting minori­ties and athletes at the 1,800­student high school. 
Other students said the killers might have been part of a group of eight to 10 students who wear black trench coats every day and are known as lhe "Trench Coa1 Mafia." 
"They are jerks," said Jason Gnrnr, 16. "They are really strange, but I've never seen them do anything violent." 
For hours after the attack wounded victims lay inside th~ building and police were unable to get to them. 
Outside, hundreds of officers from throughout the Denver area surrounded the school. Pranti<' parents were sent to a nearby ele1~entary school, where they searched for word of their children. Some students had called their parents on cel­1ular phones from inside the building. 
'foen-agers hugged parents and each other and wepl and they recalled the shootings. 
As TV images of the scene were broadcast nationwide, hcli­coptor ambulances used a sporl-; field as a landing pad, and offi­cers in helmets and camouflage gear took cover behind squad cars. Students who f'lcd the building wept and held their hands above their heads while police frisked them. 
Three youths wearing hlack ­but not trench coats -were stopped by police in a field near ' the school. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation said the three were friends of the gunmen who were bfling taken in for ques­tioning. 
Witnesses said lhc shootings took place around the school. including in the cafeteria and library. 
'"We heard the gunshots and we were running," said Kaley l3oyle, a junior.

Committee re-ranks remaining field 
By KERRY SMITH Sports Writer 
After hundreds of tournament match­ups, the original field of 581 Bookstore Basketball teams has narrowed to just 16. 
When Tuesday's Round of 32 ended, the members of the Bookstore Basketball Commission met and after much debate, re-rankrd the remaining teams. 
"Th(-! process was a straight democra­cv, .. head commissioner Brendan Poe said. "The commissioners who were familiar with the teams described how they've played in the tournament and then each commissioner voted." 
The commission rn-sceded the teams to create the bracket !'or Urn remainder of the tournament. 
The vote produred no surprises for the top spot. Primetime, seeded first before the tournament began, was the easy choice. 
"Primetime didn't do anything to deserve to be knocked down in the rank­ings," Poe said. "They're last year's champs and they deserve thf' number one spot. The decision was pretty much unanimous." 
Primetime, handily defeating its chal­lengers in each round, had little trouble making it to the sweet 16. 
'.vlalicious Prosecution and Keyplay.com follow at the second and third spots, respectively. Malicious Prosecution was ranked third in the original seedings, but strong and aggressive play earned the team the No. 2 position. 
"Malicious Prosecution is playing well as a team," Poe said. "As a commission, we didn't feel that Keyplay.com has played as well as they could."

Doherty brings in first ND recruit 
By TIM CASEY Spans Writer 
As Roy Williams' top assistant and chief recruiter at Kansas for the last seven years, Matt Doherty proved himself capable of landing talent. 
Through his hard work and relentless work ethic, Doherty lured Raef LaFrentz, Jacque Vaughn and Paul Pierce, among others, away from every major school in the country to Lawrence, Kan. 
Dohrrty may have found another gem in Ivan Kartelo, a G-!'oot-11-inch center from the Winchendon School in north­central Massachusetts, who signed Monday as the first recruit of the post-John Macleod era. 
Although offensively raw, Kartelo will be an inside pres­ence in a frontline returning only one player over b feet 8 
inches. 

"I feel comfortable that Ivan's going to be able to step in and play right away defensively," Winchendon head coach Michael Byrnes said. "I don't think Coach Doherty can count on him scor­ing double figures, but if Ivan gets minutes, he's going to get rebounds, assists and he'll dive on the floor. He'll give up every­thing for the team." 
Doherty's recent hiring played a major role in Kartelo's deci­sion to choose Notre Dame over Boston College, he said. The two met two weeks ago in Providence, JU., at the Converse JamFest high school basketball tournament. Kartclo did not play because of a twisted ankle. 
Byrnes has confidence in Doherty, a close friend through recruiting, and said he thinks Doherty's presence was the dflciding factor for Kartelo to sign with the Irish. 
"First and foremost, it was 
Coach Dolrnrty," Byrnes said. Ile got the [Notre Dame] job on a Tuesday, and on Thursday he was meeting with Ivan and con­vincing him how big of a piece of the puzzle he could be Lo getting Notre Dame. back to where they were in the early '80s." 
The chance to play alongside Troy Murphy, the reigning Big East rookie of' the year, also influenced Kartr:lo's decision, Byrnes said. Last season at Winehendon, Kartelo team11d with 7-l'oot-3-inch Bruno Sundov, who was activated yes­terday for the Dallas Mavericks. 
Sundov pushed Kartclo daily in practice, and Byrnes said Murphy can do the same f'or him at Notre Dame. 
"Ivan needs to polish his offen­sive game and that's why it's good that he pickfld a school with somebody like Troy Murphy," Byrnes said. "Ile can
