INSIDE COLUMN 

Protesters try to paint away temptation 
A crowd of over fifty New Yorkers stalked the streets of Harlem on a recent Saturday morning, splashing paint on private property and chanting slogans 


while four police cars Joe Moody
cautiously tailed them. Assistant News Editor 
They passed the ravage filled area abundant with bars, liquor stores, graffiti-covered projects, and a dozen or so men drinking out of paper bags. 
"Yield not to temptation," sang the zeal­ous crowd as they marched through the streets in a section of America where men have shorter lifespans than in Bangladesh. 
The group, made up of members of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, is actively protesting billboards enticing them to buy alcohol and cigarettes. They paraded down Harlem's streets with buckets and paint­rollers whitewashing them. 
"The board says 'Alive with Pleasure,' but tell that to someone dying of lung cancer," exclaimed the protest organizer. 
By palnting over the advertisements, they hope to diminish the constant temptation to smoke and drink among the young. 
Alluring billboards thwart the intentions of the anti-drug effort by flashing the se­ductive message of "Yes" to the ephemeral euphorias of spirits and smoke over grade­schools and impoverished neighborhoods. This small group has desperately resolved to taking direct action against corporate mega-giants. 
They realize that blotting out the adver­tisements will not eliminate the dangers of alcoholism and cancer among their youth. As one of the unimpressed bystanders, an elderly man, said, "It ain't going to work." Another man held up his drink hidden be­hind a brown paper bag adding, "This is a personal thing." 
These protesters were not sent by Presi­dent Bush. They're not part of any industry­
P.R. campaign. They're a group of desperate citizens living in the thick of the chaos and desolation created by misuse. They're a re­action to the action of the propagation of what becomes the final answer and reality to so many of their lives. 
Success is at hand. The vice-president of a major billboard company announced the company will remove liquor and cigarette billboards within five blocks of places of worship, schools, and play areas in New York, adding that the company will consider doing the same nationally. 
"We haven't had any complaints from anyone. If any of the companies do complain there could be some arrests," warned the local police Captain watching the group. 
A billboard worker, in response to the radical protest, drew cheers from the paint­slinging protesters as he papered over a billboard once advertising beer with a new message, "God makes house calls."

Graduates say Arts and Letters education appeals to businesses 
By KATE MANUEL News Writer 
The broadness of an Arts and 
Letters education and the ana­
lytic-thinking skills that such 
an education imparts were 
cited by three Notre Dame Arts 
and Letters graduates as the 
primary benefits of a liberal 
arts education in a lecture 
Tuesday'.lecture, "Can Arts and 
Lette.rs Graduates Find Jobs 
and, If So, Doing What?" 
The advice of John Buck, a 1966 graduate of the General Program of Liberal Studies who is now chief executive officer of the John Buck Co., a Chicago real estate firm,was to study as many fields as possible as an undergraduate and then study a specialized field as a gradu­ate, business. or law student. 
Buck said, "Your experience here is not to learn as much as you can. You should try to ex­pand your horizons and try to learn to think more clearly . . . You read people who have writ­ten about education, and the broad prevailing theme is to learn as much as you can." 
N. Don Wycliff, a 1969 grad­uate with a degree in govern­ment who is currently a mem­ber of the New York Times edi­torial board, also emphasized the ability of an Arts and Let­ters education to provide a broad background in many fields. He described his profes­sion of journalism as one in 
Mladenov elected to Bulgarian Presidency 
SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) -Par­
liament on Tuesday adopted 
legislation for free elections 
and unanimously voted Petar 
Mladenov, who initiated demo­
cratic reforms in Bulgaria, to a 
newly created presidency. 
The ruling Communists also 
renamed their disgraced party 
the Bulgarian Socialist Party in 
an apparent effort to distance 
themselves from their hard-line 
past and decades of unpopular 
rule in Bulgaria. 
The legislation for multiparty 
elections scheduled this June 
sets the terms for the first free 
balloting in Bulgaria since 
World War II. 
The legislation was agreed to 
last week following three 
months of tough talks between 
the Communists and the oppo­
sition, and was ratified by Par­
liament along with constitu­
tional amendments abolishing 
all references to "Communist" 
and "Socialist." 
Both the Communists and the 
opposition agreed last Friday 
to Mladenov's election to the 
new presidency. 
Mladenov had served as the 
Communist president of the 
State Council that was formally 
dissolved Tuesday. 
As in neighboring Romania and other East European coun­tries, the State Council under the Communists acted effec­tively as the legislature in be­tween infrequent sessions of the countries' rubber-stamp parliaments. 
Mladenov, 53, was elected to the new temporary presidency. He is to be replaced after the newly elected parliament ap­proves a new constitution. 
Elections have been set for 
June 10, with runoffs scheduled 
for June 17. 

which "knowledge needs to be a mile wide and an inch deep" but pointed to the importance of reading, analyzing, and being inquisitive in all job fields. 
"In journalism, I think in the entire realm of public writing," Wycliff said, "what counts more than certain knowledge is. certain habits of mind. I cannot think of a single course I took ­calculus, philosophy, theology ­that has not, in some way, en­riched my life and enabled me to do my job better." 
Christopher J. Murphy III, a 1968 graduate in government and international relations, is the president of 1st Source Corp. in South Bend, and he de­fended the benefits of a liberal arts education by saying, "An Arts and Letters education is the best preparation for life ­not just for a job." 
Neither Buck, Wycliff, nor Murphy questioned the pre­paredness of Arts and Letters graduates for jobs in business or high technology fields. "As an employer, the more well­rounded an applicant is -extra­curricular and sports are im­portant-the better. We look for people who have graduate de­grees, but I have a preference for those who have a broad perspective coming out of un­dergrad. We are not really in­terested in people who are looking for the quick dollar," Buck said. He also noted the appeal of philosophy and ethics courses, as well as volunteer work, sports, and en­trepreneurial thinking, to po­tential employers. 
Similarly, Murphy said, "All I learned in business school, I could have learned in the first six months on the job. Anyone with a college degree can get a job. There are certain technical skills that you must have to get a certain job, but I would much rather hire an Arts and Letters graduate, or a business gradu­ate who has taken all elective courses in Arts and Letters, than a strictly business gradu­ate. I can teach them how to add and subtract but I cannot teach them how to think." 
During the lecture, titled "Can Arts and Letters Graduates Find Jobs and, If So, Doing What?" all three graduates agreed on the importance of relatively good grades and persistence in getting a job. Murphy said, "It is important that you have relatively good grades." While the company for which Murphy works does not hire strictly on the basis of grades, it simultaneously does not consider applicants with a grade point average below a certain level. 
As advice to all graduates, not just those from Arts and Letters, seeking a job, Murphy pointed out, "Nothing is more successful than a pest. You take your talents and your ca­pabilities and sell them."

Marcos' lawyer claims Bush urged her to invest in U.S. 
NEW YORK (AP) -Imelda Marcos' attorney contended Tuesday that George Bush urged her husband to invest in 
U.S. real estate and that the CIA "was aware of every trans­action" for which she is on trial on racketeering charges. 
In opening arguments, de­fense attorney Gerald Spence also said he plans to call Bush as a witness. 
The lawyer said that Bush, then the vice president, was concerned about the Marcoses negotiating an oil deal with Libyan leader Moammar Gadafi and suggested to Marcos dur­ing a 1981 meeting in Manila, "Why don't you invest in Amer­ican properties?" 
The Marcoses, "who saw themselves as children of America," took the advice, Spence said. "They abandoned any further attempt to invest in Libya and began to put their money into New York real es­tate." 
In Washington, White House spokesman Steve Hart had no immediate comment .

Lithuanian representatives meet with Kremlin officials 
MOSCOW (AP) -A delegation 
from the rebellious Baltic re­
public of Lithuania met Tuesday 
with a major adviser to Presi­
dent Mikhail Gorbachev, and a 
Lithuanian legislator later 
called it a sign of hope in the 
confrontation. 
"We are very, very encour­aged," legislator Egidius Bick­auskas, Lithuania's representa­tive in Moscow, told The Asso­ciated Press. "If there are peo­ple who at least want to listen to us, it's very good." 
He earlier told reporters a three-member delegation, in­cluding Deputy Premier Ro­mualdas Ozolos of Lithuania, was meeting with Alexander Yakovlev, a Politburo member recently appointed to Gor­bachev's new Presidential Council. 
Also Tuesday: 
•The 
Supreme Soviet parlia­ment approved a bill setting procedures for secession from the Soviet Union. The law, which goes into effect when it is published in the Soviet press. requires approval by a two­thirds vote in a referendum and a waiting period of up to five years. Lithuania, forcibly incor­porated into the Soviet Union in 1940, declared its independence on March 11. The Moscow gov­ernment refused to recognize this and a crisis ensued. 

•The 
Kremlin restricted traf­fic at Lithuania's border with Poland, the republic's only bor­der that does not adjoin Soviet territory. Soviet officials told Polish border officials the crossing from Ogrodniki, Poland, to Lazdijai, Lithuania, was "temporarily" closed, the Polish news agency PAP said. 

•Lithuania's 
chief diplomat in Washington. Stasys Lozaraitis Jr., told reporters there he be­lieves the Soviet army may have taken the lead role from Gor­bachev in dealing with the cri­sis. He said the Soviet military show of force in Lithuania made him more pessimistic than before about his home­land's fate. 


Yakovlev is seen as a key aide to Gorbachev and is considered 
the architect of his policy of 
glasnost, or greater openness. 
Yakovlev led a parliamentary 
commission that last year re­
viewed the secret Soviet-Nazi 
pact under which the three 
Baltic republics -Lithuania, 
Estonia and Latvia -were ab­
sorbed into the Soviet Union. 
The commission's work led the 
Soviet Congress of People's 
Deputies in December to con­
demn the 1939 pact. 
Tuesday marked the first 
high-level personal contact be­
tween Lithuania and Moscow 
since just after Lithuania de­
clared itself independent last 
month. 
The talks, which Bickauskas 
described as "consultations ... 
a conversation," lasted for 
more than three hours. He 
could provide no details. 
"It is likely there would be no 
concrete decisions, but the very 
fact that they heard us is very 
good." he said. 
Gorbachev says he will not 
negotiate with Lithuania, but 
will hold discussions on any 
topic as long as the republic 
renounces the declaration of 
independence. 
"Independent states are not created in such a way in an overnight takeover," presiden­tial spokesman Arkady Maslen­nikov told reporters Tuesday. 
The meeting came amid in­creasing conciliatory signals from the two sides. 
The clash of wills ineluded Gorbachev's orders to Lithua­nians to hand over their weapons; the arrest by Soviet troops of some Lithuanian de­serters; takeover of several buildings in Vilnius. the Lithua­nian capital, by Soviet soldiers; movements of army reinforce­ments, and a war of words. 
Bickauskas said Lithuania had no means of implementing its proclaimed independence if Soviet soldiers continue to in­terfere in the republic. 
"We have declared indepen­dence,B but we very well know that tanks are moving on our soil every day and night, and they take over one building after another," he said. 

"We realize the Soviet Union has economic, political and military interests in Lithuania that cannot be cut all at once. These problems involve not only the Soviet Union and Lithuania but Europe and the whole world. So we need to talk. We want somebody to hold a dia­logue with us." 
Anatoly Lukyanov, chair of the Supreme Soviet parliament, spoke of "friendly ties" with Lithuania and said Moscow does not question its right to secede, as long as the republic follows proper constitutional procedures. 
But Gorbachev also met Tuesday with a leader of Lithuania's 35,000-member Communist Youth movement, who urged him to impose pres­idential rule in the republic. The appeal was broadcast on Soviet TV's national news. 
Soviet news media continued supporting attempts by Lithua­nia's minority pro-Moscow Communist Party to halt the printing of at least four pro-in­dependence newspapers at Vil­nius' central printing plant. 
Lithuanian journalists said the newspapers appeared as usual Tuesday, despite the building's being controlled by Soviet Interior Ministry troop­ers. 
On Saturday, Gorbachev is­sued an appeal to Lithuania saying secession talks could take place if Lithuania re­nounced the independence dec­laration. l-Ie said the republic's refusal could result "in grave consequences for all of us." 
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis responded on Monday with a conciliatory message. He said Lithuania did not intend to rush toward free­dom and invited a Moscow rep­resentative for talks in Vilnius. 
Bickauskas said a formal re­sponse to Gorbachev from Lithuania's Supreme Soviet leg­islature may emerge Wednesday and would be read in public gatherings throughout Lithua-

"But if somebody expects Lithuania to renounce its inde­pendence act, there will be no such answer," he said. 
Lithuanian Deputy Nikolia Medvedev expressed hope that Gorbachev's wording, which never mentioned independenc1~ declaration directly, left room for compromise. 
"This is the thin line for ma­neuvering ... , " Mcdvedev said. "But first, we have to hold ne­gotiations about negotiations."

Lecturer: Ethics must be learned by model 
By NATASHA WILSON News Writer 
Students would enter the business world with a stronger ethical vision if business schools would include real life scenarios in their courses on ethics, according to Notre Dame Associate Professor of Management and Associate Provost Father Oliver Williams. 
Many business schools em­phasize the study of formal ethical principles to the exclu­sion of stories or narratives, Williams said at a conference on ethics Tuesday. 
Business ethics text books are "almost always concerned with principles," said Williams. lie recommended that business professors present concrete examples to teach students how to "recognize a moral obliga­tion and then use principles and rules to justify the obligation." 
"Rules and principles take on meaning in that they are de­signed to promote and protect a humane way of life with all its values as they are understood in the community," the profes­sor said. 
Business schools have the re­sponsibility to teach students to distinguish between positive and negative examples of be­havior, Williams said. "It's re­ally a question of helping [theml train their vision." 
Many senior executives are concerned about the false vi­sion of young newcomers to the business world, Williams said. For example, convicted insider trader Ivan Boesky received cheers of approval when he de­livered his "Greed is Good" speech to students at the Uni­versity of California at Berke­ley. Boesky's speech inspired a scene in the movie Wall Street, he said. 
"The moral life is not so much a matter of thinking clearly as it is a way of 'seeing' the world. The Johnson and Johnson Credo is a good exam­ple of an attempt to provide a humane world view for all con­stituencies," Williams said. 
The Credo of Johnson & 
Johnson states "that the 'first 
responsibility' is to customers 
and their welfare and the com­
pany's last responsibility is to 
stockholders and their need for 
profit." 
"The Johnson & Johnson Tylenol withdrawal was not so much a matter of telling the truth (principled action) as it was of being true to its promise (virtuous action)," Williams said. 
The professor presented Nes­
tle's marketing of infant for­
mula as an example of a nega­tive business practice. 

"Stessing the freedom of choice of consumers, Nestle management never really ap­prehended the fact that most Third World mothers did not have the capacity to make an informed choice about infant formula nor to use the product safely. 
Although Nestle's top man­agers probably were familiar with formal ethical principles, they "didn't see the issue as its problem. They seem to be op­erating with the outdated no­tion of 'let the buyer beware,"' Williams said. 
During his presentation Williams read part of "The Ethics of Virtue: A Moral The­ory for Marketing," a paper which he co-authored with Patrick Murphy. The article will be published in an upcom­ing issue of Journal of Macro­marketing. 
The Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Religious Values in Business sponsored the confer­ence on "A Virtuous Life in the Business Story." The sympo­sium brought together scholars from various disciplines to dis­cuss the recent trends in theol­ogy that are applicable to busi­ness. 
Williams and ND Professor 
of Management John Houk are 
co-directors of the conference 
and of the Center for Ethics

Companies receive stiff fines for hiring children for dangerous jobs 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Fines against fast-food restaurants and other businesses are climbing toward the $3 million mark for thousands of child la­bor law violations uncovered in a three-day federal sweep, of­ficials said Tuesday. 
One businessman called the effort by the Labor Department "nitpicking" and a "crusade." But spokeswoman Johanna Schneider said the department's "responsibility is to enforce the letter of the law." 
She said companies had the right to appeal the fines if they thought they were unfair. 
The number of violations grew from 7,000 to nearly 11,000 after federal investiga­tors gave the case files further review, officials said. The total is about half the number for all of 1989. 
Civil fines on the businesses involved are expected to total 
IAMERICAN WCANCER 'SOCIETY~ 
$2.9 million, up from the $1.8 million originally predicted fol­lowing the March 12-15 sweep, said William Brooks, an assis­tant secretary of labor. 
Most of the violations in­volved teenagers working more hours or later hours during the school week than is allowed under federal law. 
But there were also 1,450 youngsters age 14-1 7 who were illegally employed in dangerous jobs, such as using power­driven meat-slicing machinery, dough mixers and paper­balers, the department said. 
An Arby's fast food restau­rant in Santa Fe, N.M., was fined $12,550 for various viola­tions, including some for putting youngsters to work in dangerous tasks. A similar fine was levied against a Sizzler Steakhouse in Omaha, Neb., for the same type of violations, of­ficials said. 
Larry Pabian, who runs four Sizzler Steakhouses in Omaha and one in Lincoln, said most of the violations came from a dis­crepancy between Nebraska law and federal law on how late 15-year-olds can work. He said the Nebraska law sets a 10 
p.m. limit while federal law is more restrictive. 
Pabian called the federal reg­ulations regarding operating meat slicers "antiquated" be­cause the rules prohibit work­ers under 18 from operating the machines. 
"Operating the machine ­that's a fine, and then wiping off the machine -that's an­other fine," he said. 
"'rhe violations were not na­grant at all. In most cases. they involved kids working 10 min­utes beyond their three hours," Cheney said. "We feel that we've obeyed the spirit of the law."

Southerners still remember Civil War 125 years later 
HICIIMOND, Va. (AP) ­When Gen. Ulysses Grant's troops chased the Confederate government from Richmond, a slave named James Wilder hid in a tobacco silo. 
"lin almost suffocated in that silo," recalls the slave's grand­son, Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder. recounting the story passed down through his fa­ther. 
Instead, Jamns Wildnr emerged to find himself sud­denly a frne man, and thn city, which had been bombarded for months, wrapped in names. 
Grant rode on 95 miles to Appomattox, where Gen. Hobert Lee surrendered the South's main army seven days later on April 9, 1865, and Wilder went on to beget the fa­tlwr of the nation's llrst black elected governor. 
Though 125 years have passnd since the end of the Civil War. it still is ingrained in the consciences of many Southern natives. 
Stories about the war are reaching more people than ever through a growing number of battle re-enactments, battlefield tours, books and specialty magazines, and through the celebrated movie "Glory," about the Union's first black regiment. 
"There are so many events being re-enacted that we can't knep track of them," said David Roth, editor of Blue and Gray, a magazine with the motto "For Those Who Still llear The Guns." 
The regional and racial divi­sions exacerbated by the "War of Northern Aggression," the term still used by some South­erners, are beginning to close, and the symbols of the Old South are becoming more anachronistic.

"That's all. This is England, not America," he snapped at an American reporter. 
Again, the Home Office's lig­ures differed. It said prisoners still controlled two wings and officers regained control of the ground floor of another and parts of the ground floor of two other wings. 
The guards regained control of four wings and the prison kitchen on Monday.

"There is no such thing as a pro-choice Catholic politician," said Vaughan. "The Catholic who actively supports pro­choice positions is committing a sin." Vaughan said that if you commit a serious sin and die unrepentant, you go to Hell. 
"In my opinion," said Vaughan "a public warning about the risk of going to Hell is more effective !than excom­munication!." lie added that his warning to Governor Cuomo had no effnct except to make Cuomo angry. 
"I never c~ompared Cuomo to Hitler," said Vaughan. lie said that he did compare Cuomo to the World War II German sol­diers who said that they were personally against killing Jews, but who believed that it was not their decision to make.

Sweeping clean air bill wins Senate approval 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Senate overwhelmingly ap­proved sweeping air pollution controls on automobiles, facto­ries and power plants Tuesday after a decade of struggle over whether to strengthen federal clean air laws. 
The new controls, which are estimated to cost the economy $21 billion a year when they go fully into effect, were approved by a vote of 89-11. 
President Bush, speaking in Indianapolis in advance of Sen­ate action, called it "a historic vote" that would "affect gener­ations to come as we work to build a cleaner, safer America." 
After the vote, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, "We're pleased and we'll, work for passage in the House." 
Senate approval shifted the clean air debate to the !louse where a similar bill is being written by the Energy and Commerce Committee. Hcp. John Dingell, 0-Mich., the

panel's chairman, said he plans 
to have the committee vote by

House measures will then still 
have to be worked out. 
Senate Majority Leader Ge­
orge Mitchell. D-Maine, ac­
knowledged the new require­
ments would be expensive to 
industry, but argued "the costs 
of inaction will be higher than 
the cost of this bill." Health ex­
perts have estimated air pollu­
tion may account for 50,000 
premature deaths every year, 
he said. 

"We can no longer delay," said Mitchell, who has sought federal controls on acid rain for nearly a decade and made the clean air bill his top priority as Democratic leader. 
"The American people want action. They demand action," he continued. 
But to many senators, par­ticularly from the Midwest, the vote represented an agonizing choice between elnaner air and concern about thn impact of the new controls on employment and electric bills back home. 
"This bill will absolutely decimate my state of Illinois," declared Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill. ~hose state has utility plants that rely on high-sulfur coal as well as coal miners whose jobs will be jeopardized by new mea­sures to combat acid rain. 
Dixon was among only the 11 senators who voted against the legislation. 
"I cannot vote for legislation that will destroy the livelihood of thousands of hard working men and women ... that will bring economic ruin to com­munities throughout Ap­palachian and midwestern states," said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who unsuccessfully had sought financial help for coal miners affected by the bill. 
The final vote came after a brief flurry of excitement over an attempt by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., at the last minute to change the permit requirements of the bill and make it easier for businesses to comply. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., called the 34-page amendment "an ambush" that would hamper enforcement of the new re­quirements and hinder civil 
suits a ainst polluters.

Destruction of symbols obscures history 

Wu Junhong Hannah 
The Mongolians are removing statues of Stalin. The Hungari­ans have broken into pieces a statue of Lenin. Elsewhere in the communist world, similar things are happening, and peo­ple cheer wholeheartedly for such exciting "historic" moves. 
Every time I see such scenes, I wish I have the power to stop the people from taking these "Leninist actions." I would like to ask what they are trying to achieve, changing history or forgetting history? 
It seems quite obvious that we can neither change nor for­get our history. We can only 
learn from it. While everybody may not agree on the evalua­tions of Lenin, Stalin, or Mao, none of us can deny that they have made history. It is a his­tory we cannot afford to for­get. It is a history we must let future generations know about. And remember. 
Just like flags, statues are symbols. Human beings tend to place too much value on sym­bols. For symbols people have done much without hesitation. They have fought. They have conquered. They have killed. And they have died. But nobody can claim symbols are unim­portant. After all, it is through symbols that we communi­cate.The question needed to be asked, however, is where the place for symbols should be. If symbols become more impor­tant than life itself, then we are in trouble. 
However, unlike burning a flag, which can be mass pro­duced, destroying historical statues is not simply getting away with symbols. It is a deeply regretful gesture. Just search around the world today and see how many of those statues are left, which people are so eager to break. Not many at all. These statues not only tell us something about the history, something about the cultures, something about the people, but they are often ad­mirable pieces of art. 
Ironically, the need of getting rid of these statues under to­day's cry for freedom and democracy reminds me of the Cultural Revolution in China in the sixties. Churches, temples, ancient monuments, statues of Confucius were being destroyed all over China. Mao and his revolution became the only truth. Nothing else, not even history, was acceptable any more. Not even to look at. To­day they have only regret left with which to face our younger generations. Maybe a lesson, too. 
In my hometown in the north­east of China, there lies one of the biggest statues of Mao and many workers, peasants, and soldiers around him. I have had my pictures taken there ever since I was a little kid, wearing pins of Mao and holding his red books. These pictures have al­ways made me wonder and made me think. 
Someday I hope to show these pictures to my children and grandchildren, who will have a small clue about these things. Or, I would rather take them there and tell them about this unforgettable part of their his­tory, if the statue is still there.

From its Parlinst bnginnings in tlw electrical power genera­tion and distribution systems. electrieal engineering has evolvPd through telephone, ra­dio and television to microelec­tronic!!' and modern computers. The electrical engineering pro­gram at Notre Dame has fol­lowed a similar development. 
Today, a typical electrical engineering student receives a strong background in the basic seinnces, especially physics and mathematics, and a broad background in eleetrical engi­neering including drruits, ele<:­tromagneties, eleetrophysics and computers.

At present, a student may choose one of two sequences-­the standard sequence or the computer sequence. The differ­ences between the two se­quences occur during the junior and senior years and differ in the core curriculum, as well as in the electives. In both se­quences, the first two years of study are identical, concentrat­ing on fundamental principles in circuit and mathematical analysis. 
Graduates with a degree in electrical engineering are em­ployed in the semieonductor, power, aerospace, telecommu­nieation, radio, television, com­puter and defense industries. Many electrical engineers take up consulting, which can com­bine creative insight with any one or several of the industries mentioned above. The electrical engineer is well prepared to do work in research, design, de­velopment, manufacturing. field service, and may also be successful in sales, market analysis and management. 
There is one notion about electrical engineering that is not a misconception--the notion that the program can be difficult and, for most students, is very time-consuming. It is fairly uncommon to find an electrical engineer who watches TV all day and goes out every night. There are a few, of course, but they are the exception and not the rule.

bP part of thn Notw Dame tradition." Obviously this explanation has its subscribers, but a typical reaction to this answer will bn about as pleasant as rnactions to Lenten Fridays at thn dining hall. 
The jock: "I guess it's because of the competition." This would seem to be the most popular answer, but most pnopln enter the tournament knowing that they won't see past the first or second round. When I pressed the respondent about the reality of his answer, he said. "The whole campus gets really competitive-at least it's somPthing to do." 
The glutton for punishment: "Because we've never won." llow many people at Notre Dame besides this group enjoy frustration? Needless to say, this team lost on Tuesday. 
The HOTC extremist: "Because of the attention we attract from using boots." It must bn quite a crowd pleaser to sn€ live shavelings running around t1.e court with black army boots on their feet. 
The truthful: "To get in the paper." Then I guess Fish Don't Use Ambnsol and Satanie Embryos must bn happy. 
The practical: "To put it on my resume." Here is a combi­nation of two wonders at Notre Dame-resume hysteria and bookstore basketball-rolled into one. 
The dejected: "Bncausl' I've never scored." My heart goes out to this guy. lie's a senior so this tournament was his last chance. and he went about 0 for 10. I hope he scores some time in the futun~. 
The selfless: "We always draw a good crowd, and that's

good for the tournament." I hear NBC is considering televis­ing all bookstore games from now until 1995. 
The thrifty: there's no quote but Elnvl'n Games for Five Bucks apparently saw thn value in such a venture. 
The most common: "t<or the hell of it." Again, I encouraged elaboration, and the response was. "Well. it seems like the thing to do." 

Presumably thn reason why so many people do it is because everyone else dons it, and join­ing would make the tourna­ment that much bigger-a psychology similar to the burning desire to be in the Guiness Book of World Hncords. 
And because of this psychol­ogy, it is a tradition on campus that joins so many others in making our nwmories of Notre Dame starry-eyed and golden.

his way. 

In his book, The Game Behind 
The Game, former CBS execu­
tive producer Terry O'Neil 
writes about the days when the 
anchor monsters did have free 
reign in the network system. 
O'Neil, a 1971 Notre Dame 
graduate and the innovator of 
March Madness and the CBS 
Chalkboard, portrays Brent as 
a backstabbing know-it-all, an 
obsessive news mongrel. 
But the anchor monster won 

out; O'Neil was forced out of 
CBS because he didn't comply

Winfield ends slump in loss to LA 
Fort Lauderdale (AP)-On a day when ex-teammate Willie Randolph punished the Yankees with four hits and they were four runs behind before they came to bat, all was not bleak for the New Yorkers. 
Dave Winfield finally got a hit. 
The Yankees absorbed a 6-1 exhibition pounding from the Los Angeles Dodgers at Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Tuesday, managing just six hits against John Wetteland, Jeff Bittinger and Jim Gott. One of them was a seventh-inning single by Win­field, who missed all of last season because of back surgery and was 0-for-17 so far this spring. 
Winfield celebrated the occa­sion by tipping his cap and bowing as the crowd cheered. 
"It was a pretty long drought, about 500 days be­tween hits," he said.

that led to his dismissal. 
What was it about Brent that turned some people off? The viewers didn't like his abrasive style, his know-it-all demeanor. They grew tired of the inces­sant hype he brought to each sporting event, be it champi­onship basketball or roller derby. How many times did you mutter, "What the hell's he babbling about now?" 
Maybe his detractors were correct, given the fact that Brent spent 17 years in front of network cameras and not one Emmy Award fell his way. Some say Brent was too good, too diverse. How could one man successfully manage all those responsibilities? 
Yet, through all the Superbowls, NCAA Championships, Laker games and Bud Bowls, we still didn't recognize the real man behind the navy-blue sport coat. He grew up on a ranch in Big Timber, Mont., where he vowed to someday become a sportswriter. After a stint at the now-defunct Chicago American , he dabbled in radio and eventually joined network television in 1968. 
On the road, he's gotten into two highly-publicized brawls: In 1975 he went toe-to-toe with fellow Chicago journalist Tom Fitzpatrick and just last year he knocked over some restau-

His peers certainly respect him. Said ESPN sportscaster Chris Berman: "He's the best there is. Period. Because when I watch him anchor, I know what hits you." What hits you is in­stant adrenalin. You couldn't wait for that Saturday football game when Brent delivered that patented preview with the CBS theme song resounding in the background. Brent brought a sense of credibility and profes­sionalism to each event. He prepared for each game as if it was his last. He made the color analysts better color analysts. That's something CBS will never replace. 
"Sports is my life," Brent once said. "I would rather watch or talk about a sporting event than anything else." This is a man who actually outgrew the entire network. Some peo­ple think ABC may come knock­ing if Monday Night Football regular AI Michaels is lured into the baseball package at CBS. Turner Broadcasting may be an option. But, believe it or not, Musburger's dream job calls for a return visit to Chicago to broadcast Cub games on WGN.

"We played really well in the pool play," said cap­tain Tom Martin. "especially against Minnesota." 
Aftnr a forfeit by Loyola early on Saturday, the Irish handlnd Quincy College (15-3, 15-6) and Illinois St.(15-9, 15-12) to make it to the Final Four. Unfor­tunatnly, the Irish lin ally met their match against Michigan St., falling 12-15, 15-6, 12-15. The Spar­tans wnnt on to boat intrastate rival Michigan for the championship. 
"We played them (Michigan St.) four times during the season and we only beat them once." commented Martin. "They've replaced Michigan as our arch ri­val." 
Dave Bose and Tom Martin were named to the AJI-Tournament Team. Martin led the team in kills for the weekend with 40. Jim Jeffrey followed him up with 37 while Mike Sheedy and Andy Sullivan added 35 each. Jeffrey led the Irish in blocks with 21 and setter Pedro Nemalceff had 11, a big number for a 5-10 setter. 
At the National Tournament the Irish will have 
Wisconsin, Tennessee and Marshall in their pool. 
"We've played Wisconsin in the past couple years and they're always tough," observed Martin. "They have a real strong high school program in their area. We don't know anything about the other two teams." 
While the sun wasn't around to do it, the Crew Team managed to shine at Saturday's Notre Dame Crew Classic. The team had a total of five first place finishes. St. Thomas had the next highest number with two. Notre Dame finished first in the Men's Novice Eight, Men's Open Four, Women's Open Four, Men's Open Eight and Men's Lightweight Eight. The Women's Novice Eight finished second in its race. 
The Men's Lightweight Eight turned in the fastest time of any run all day as they traversed the 1750m course in 5:20.66. The boat was coxswained by Jill Jacobs. ller crew consisted of Kelly Townsend at the bow, Mike Bertin, Mike Whitman, Eric Waffner, Don Leslie, Chris Murdy, Dave Ruppel and Bob Gregory at the Stroke. 
"Minnesota was our main opponent," explained starboard Leslie. "We took a boat-length lead right from the start and held it the entire race. Everyone really pulled hard and we just had a great row." 
Minnesota finished a long eight seconds behind the Irish. After an extended break, the Notre Dame/St. 
Mary's Gymnastics team had a successful meet at Purdue last Saturday. Katie O'Shea. Maura Leonard, Julie Leonard, Kevin Marks, John Stavrokos and Dan Hickle all performed well in the meet. Teams from Indiana, Purdue and Miami of Ohio tested the squad. The Irish may have gotten their best com­petition from a very talented six year old girl who entered the meet for exhibition. 
The Crew team isn't the only team who docs it on the water at Notre Dame. The Sailing Club is back, trying to build on their successful fall which in­cluded a trip to the Tinny Angston Hegatta last November. The future of Notre Dame sailing got its first taste of intercollegiate competition two week­ends ago in the Freshmen Icebreaker Hegatta on St. Joseph's Lake. The regatta featured ten schools in­cluding teams from Ohio Wesleyan (first place), Xavier (second), Lake Forest College (third), Min­nesota and Wisconsin-Green Bay. Notre Dame fin­ished sixth. "The finish really isn't that important," said club co­president Watts Hudgens. "We had 12 people who went out and had some racing expnrienee. Our main goal was to make sure they all got on the water and we did that." 
This past weekend the team competed at Miami (OH) against the likes of Ohio State and Purdue, as well as top three finishers Wiseonsin, Michigan and Western Michigan respeetively. Notre Dame finished fifth. 
Dave Kraemer skippered the A boat that finished fifth while Moira Sullivan was the crew. Chris Knapp (skipper) and Kurt Gause piloted the B boat to a fourth place. 
The club will send one team eaeh to Michigan State and Purdue this weekend.

through new contract negotiations for several months, and he demanded a resolution by Sunday. What he got was a slap in the face. 
Musburger fell victim to network television's emerging pro­cess of elimination: When the talent becomes bigger than the network, lose the talent. The sports networks no longer want to showcase the "anchor monster", the do-it-all sports host. One minute you'd see the droopy-eyed Brent on the set of "The NFL Today" and the next minute you'd hear his nasal voice behind the ninth hole at Augusta. The CBS people grew especially irritant of Musburger's overbearing control behind the scenes. Producers would work days on scripts and assignment sheets for an up-coming event only to have them ripped up by a stubborn Musburger, insisting they do it
