Students, criminals roo111111ates in Dis111as 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Wrirer 
When Keith Romine was released from prison after near­ly 25 years of inearceration, his biggest adjustment to normal life was to the advance in com­munication technology. Homine -who began his imprisonment berore the age of mass cell phone usage and personalized ringtones -said he still mis­takes the cell phone rings of his eollege student housemates for the radio. 
Romine is currently a resident of the Miehiana Dismas House, a halfway house in South Bend that serves as a prisoner reha­bilitation program. In Dismas Houses across the eountry, col­lege students live side by side with former offenders. 
The Dismas program -whkh takes its name from the thief who asked for forgiveness whiln being crucifind beside Jesus ­was started in 1974 when Fath11r Jaek lliekey, then a Catholic chaplain at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, said he believed recent prisoners and eollege students could mutually benefit one another. 
Iliekey based the program on the idea that both groups are going through major transitions in their lives. Whi111 on11 is preparing to enter soeiety for the first time, the other is preparing to re-enter sodety.

on drugs. 

Do you ever watch commercials for medicine and think, "Man, I have all those symp­toms, I must need Midol." Then you realize, "No, I'm a guy, I don't need Midol, I'm just cranky because some­one borrowed my scissors and I don't know where they are, and I need to cut this tag off my shirt because it's scratching my neck ... and I have a stomach ache because I drank a cup of nacho cheese at the dining hall." My friends do that all the time. I try not to let them watch much TV. 
I've been showing the signs of drug use all week-if I saw a commercial for a hallucinogenic drug, my reac­tion would be similar to those of my friends with the Midol commercials. But I think I can explain it. 
It started, like most weeks do, on Sunday. 
I woke up at 3 p.m., ate four slices of pizza and some Doritos, went Superbowling (watched a boring foot­ball game), then, after little debate, went back to sleep. Sure, I felt like a bum, but I didn't think much of it. 
On Monday, everything started get­ting bizarre. I laughed during a diver­sity presentation for basically no rea­son. I laughed at my friends whenev­er they looked at me, and I laughed while doing most of my homework. At night, I went to see "Run Lola Run." AND I WAS FREAKING OUT. That movie is out of control. People were yelling in German and traveling back in time and robbing banks -it's a lit­tle too much for me. I was seeing col­ors and shapes of which I am now permanently frightened. And thus began my philosophizing. 
I'm in a Cosmology class, which for me is extremely unhealthy. I stay up at night thinking about black holes, parallel universes and extra dimen­sions (Professor Kolda, ifyou're read­ing this, just straight up tell me if aliens exist or not). The worst part about it is I don't know anything about black holes, parallel universes or extra dimensions except what I've heard on "The Twilight Zone," "Seinfeld," and The MuppetVision show at Disney, respectively. 
This whole "Universe" thing is real­ly a problem for me. It's a little too complicated, and it's been treating me funny lately, so ifit wants to fight, I'll fight. You hear that Universe? You're not infmitely big. You don't scare me. There are more prominent mysteries than you, such as: How did I not know that they make chocolate Lucky Charms until like two weeks ago? Or: How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop? Or: Who has my scissors? They're blue and I want them. Give them back. 
Man, I can't believe it's only Wednesday.

Woman does 'mouth-to­beak' to save chicken 
ARKADELPHIA, Ark. ­Sometimes a chicken does have lips, just sometimes not her own. Marian Morris saved her brother's exotic chicken, Boo Boo, by administering "mouth-to­beak" resuscitation on the fowl after it was found floating face down in the family's pond. 
Morris, a retired nurse, said she hadn't had any practice with CPR in years, but that she was interested to see ifshe "still had it." 
"I breathed into its beak, and its dad-gum eyes popped open," Morris said.

Late Night Olympics raises $8,394 for needy 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Writer 
While Saturday's Late Night Olympies did not bring in quite as much mo1wy as last year's event, the $8,394 raised undoubtedly will be just as appreciated by the St. .Joseph County Speeial Olympies. 
Assistant director for HecSports Bill Heagan said he was pleased with the funds raised by the approximately 1,200 participants -slightly fewer than the 1,300 people who participated in the 2005 Olympics, but higher than the 2004 count of 1,1 00. 
"We may not have made $H,500 like last year, but we'll still be able to send a big check to Speeial Olympics," Heagan said. 
Penny wars brought in the biggest chunk of the funds ­$2,313 -trailed closely by $2,282 from entry fees. 
Heagan described the 20th annual event in the Joyee Cnnter as a "great combination of a wide variety of competi­tions and fund raising." 
Many of those competitions were dominated by the MBA team, whieh garnered its first vietory Saturday and ended the four-y1~ar dynasty of the Keough-Wnlsh Family team. 
Keough-Wnlsh Family placed sm~ond, trailing the MBA team by 294 points. The Carroll­Zahm-MeGiinn tmtm was third, 
and Pangborn-Sorin finished last. 
Since l'irst participating in the Late Night Olympics three years ago, the MBA association has been a competitive squad. Mo Sabet, the association's president, said tho event's organizers were highly moti­vated and encouraged mem­bers to participate in the events and also to donate money. 
"We're really trying to show our face on campus and be part of Notre Dame as a whole," Sabot said. 
Target golf, Nerf football, broomball, volleyball and dodge ball were some of the games offered Saturday night. Broomball was one of the most popular sports, with all avail­able slots filled. St. Ed's and Cavanaugh won that event. 
Pasquerilla West sophomore Bethany Comfort played in the volleyball tournament. She said she liked the brother-sister dorm teams and the chance to participate in an athletic con­test at Notre Dame. 
"I did athletics in high school, but I'm not good enough to be on a varsity sport here, so it was kind of a chance to be ath­letic," she said. 
Heagan said he encountered no major disciplinary problems at this year's event.

Studies intensify as MCAT loon1s 
Pre-professional majors utilize test courses to improve chances 
By ADRIENNE RUFFNER 
News Writer 

With April creeping up on the horizon, junior pre-med students missing recently from parties or other social events are likely buried in the library or nearest study lounge. 
Pre-professional majors interested in attending med­ical school have been study­ing for the April 22 Medical Colleges Admissions Test (MCAT). They spend hours studying on their own and taking Kaplan test prepara­tion classes. 
''I've been studying since about October," junior Dave Olson said. "My Kaplan class started then ... we meet for three hours every week." 
Junior Kate McCartan said she also is taking Kaplan classes, but she began them in .January because she was abroad in Dublin in the fall. 
"I don't regret going abroad, but studying is a lot more work right now than it would have been," she said. "The MCAT and your GPA are the most important things for getting into med sehool, and it's tough to bal­ance classes and studying for the test." 
The MCAT is divided into four parts. The physical sci­ences, biological sciences and verbal reasoning sec­tions are multiple choice, and each is scored on a scale from one to 15. The fourth section, writing skills, con­sists of two essays and is scored with a letter grade from J to T, with T as the highest. 
"Each week in the Kaplan course, we have a lesson on organic chemistry, biology, general chemistry or verbal reasoning," McCartan said. "For me, the hardest part of the test is a tie between physics and organie chem­istry, so I want to concen­trate on those." 
No one has ever gotten the perfect score of 45, accord­ing to the MCAT Web site. 
"I, like many other pre­meds, think that organie chemistry is particularly dif­ficult," Olson said. "So the biological sciences section, which includes biology and organic chemistry, will defi­nitely be the hardest for me." 
Olson said although the test will be difficult, he thinks his study schedule will prepare him well for the MCAT. He will forgo the beach to spend his spring break studying on campus. 
"Well, last year, I had planned on going to South Padre [Texas)." Olson said. "But after starting all my 
reviewing, I've decided to bite the bullet and stay at Contact Adrienne Ruffner at NO and study." aruffner@nd.edu 
McCartan said she plans to go home for break but will spend her time "studying in libraries and taking practice tests." 
The MCAT Web site said the test takes approximately nine and a half hours, including an hour for lunch and two 10-minute breaks. It costs $210, and the regular registration deadline for thn April 22 test is Man~h 17. 
McCartan said her Kaplan course has been very helpful in preparing her for the long day of testing. Before the test in April, she and others in the Kaplan course will take five full-length tests. 
"At Kaplan, they give us Jots of tips, everything from how to study to what to eat for lunch on the day of tho test," McCartan said. "They told us not to eat turkey because it will make us sleepy." 
While the MCAT is very important to their futures, students will be glad when the test -and the stress ­is over. 
"Immediately after tho test, I'm going to celebrate with some senior pre-med students," Olson said. "Then I'm going to call my mom and tell her that I did awe­som,;-. and then I'm going to eat.

start to taper because someone can only take so much heart-· break," sophomore Matt Biscaia said. 
Freshman Joe Mancuso said he expects fewer students to pack the Joyce Center for tonight's game against Rutgers University. 
'Til be there because I love basketball, but it's hard enough to generate interest with a string of [tough losses] that basically crippled our chances to make a post-season run," 
that at the very least, the games have been exciting," she said. "With the team so obviously giving it their all [and] never quitting, I feel -hope -that the students will still have it in them to continue supporting Irish basketball." 
McCann said she hopes there are "good crowds" of students for all of the remaining four home games. 
"No one likes to lose, but it's too early to throw in the towel," she said. "It will just kill me if we don't have a full student section on hand against DePaul to say goodbye to the seniors as they play their final game for Notre Dame. If nothing else, they deserve that." 
But sophomore Francisco Del Valle said Notre Dame's failure to win games will deter his home game attendance for the remainder of the season. 
"I might go to the Marquette game because it's the only good home game left, but at this point, I have lost all hope for our team," he said. 
McCann declined to comment on how lowered attendance might influence the number of tickets allotted for students in future seasons -which at this point would be speculative ­but which has historically has been a factor. 
"Students have voiced con­cern that more tickets should be made available; however, since attendance dropped [dur­ing the 2004-2005 season], the ticket office -and rightfully so -was not going to give out any more student tickets," said Matt Walsh, who chairs the Student Senate's University Affairs committee, in an Oct. 26 article in The Observer. 
Mancuso said attendance is "a big concern" because Irish head coach Mike Brey has been trying to get the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents more and better seats for the past few years -but "we have done nothing to support him." 

"I hear the JACC might be redone in a couple of years, and if the students don't want to get the short end of the stick again, we have to continue supporting the team," Mancuso said. 
The Leprechaun Legion has planned promotional events for the rest of the home season, including wigs for the first 150

According to the program's brochure, the mission of Dismas House is "to reconcile former offenders to society and society to former offend­ers."

The Dismas staff designs a re-entry program specific to each former offender to focus on problems such as substance abuse or mental health issues. 
Residents must commit to a 90-day stay at Dismas. While living at the house, they are required to find a job and start saving money. Each resident should save $1,500 to $2,000 dollars before he or she leaves to be able to live a stable life on his own, Kaczmarek said.

ing to cook meals, per­form chores around the house and even live in the house for a semester or year. 
Romine said he espe­cially enjoys the student intera.ction he has had since arriv­ing at Dismas in early January. He said he is the last one to leave the dinner table, and uses this 

time to converse with students about politics, international world events and national events. While in prison, Romine kept up with current issues and used his time to study so he could come out of prison prepared to re-enter society as efficiently as possi­ble. 
"I coined a phrase many, many years ago that, 'I'm in prison, but the prison's never been in me,"' said Romine, who found a job with Medallion Plastics, Inc. just eight days after his arrival in South Bend. "You know, I kept my head screwed on right, I've done positive things. You know the jobs that I took when I was in prison were going to be jobs that were gonna benefit me when I got out." 
Notre Dame senior Emily Pike, who has lived at Dismas since May 2005 and is transi­tioning back onto campus for the end of her senior year, also said she enjoyed the interac­tion between students and recently-released prisoners. 
"Living at Dismas was one of the.best decisions I've made as an undergraduate student," Pike said. "It's really easy, I think, when we live at Notre Dame, to think that South Bend is Notre Dame and Notre Dame is South Bend and it's really not. It's a very different place and it's unfortunate that a lot of students don't get to experience that." 
Pike said she agrees with the founding concept of Dismas ­that a close correlation between stages of life exists between students and former offenders. 
"When they've been down for a while, it really helps for them to see other people who aren't sure what they're going to do either," she said. 
With Pike moving back to campus, Kaczmarek is looking for more volunteers. Dismas needs mentors for the resi­dents as well as tutors and drivers. The staff is also look­ing for students who will live in the house. 
Kaczmarek said students who have volunteered at Dismas previously have had positive experiences with the program. 
"I think that from every stu­dent I've worked with, they've always said they got more out it than they gave," Kaczmarek said.

Del Valle said the Irish are "probably the best 39-nrinute team in the NCAA," but unfor­tunately that doesn't equate into a post-season presence. 
"I actually had hope in the fact the we could still make it to the Big East tournament, but we just can't complete a game," he said. "We are not bad. We play at the same level of our competition in every important game. We just need to lock it up." 
Unlike some of his peers, Mancuso said he is still "enthu­siastic" and has not lost hope for the embattled Irish. 
"We've proven we can play with the best on any given night," he said. "All we have to do is make a run and get into the Big East tournament and continue that run throughout the tournament. A win at UConn would not hurt either." 
Mancuso said the 
Nationally, the rate of former convicts who fall back into their old ways once released from prison is 64 to 7 5 per­cent, Kaczmarek said. The rate for people who lived at Dismas is only 35 percent. 
"Some of the hardest things for former offenders is to find housing, to find counseling for drug or substance abuse . . . to find medical health care or mental health care and to find employment," Kaczmarek said. "Former offenders are at a very high risk to re-offend, but if they have support, they

10,000 salute Coretta Scott King 
Four U.S. presidents pay tribute to 'the first lady of the civil rights movement' 
Associated Press 
LITIIONIA, Ga. -Ten thousand mourners ­ineluding four U.S. presi­dents, numerous members of Congt·ess and many gray-hairnd vetnrans of tho civil rights movement-­said goodbye to Corntta Scott King on Tuesday, with Presidont Bush saluting her as "a woman who worked to make our nation whole." 
The immense crowd filled the Nnw Birth Missionary Baptist Church -a modern, arena-style megachurch in a suburban Atlanta county that was onee a stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan but today has one of the most affluent black populations in the country. 
More than three dozen speakers at the funeral took turns remembering the widow of the Hev. Martin Luther King Jr., who worked to realize her husband's dream of equali­ty for nearly 40 years after his assassination. She died Jan. 30 at age 7R after bat­tling ovarian cancer and the ell"eets or a stroke. 
The president ordered nags flown at half-staff across the eountry. 
"Coretta Scott King not only seeured her husband's legaey, she built her own," Bush told thn crowd. "I laving loved a leader, she became a leader, and when shn spoke, Americans lis­tened dosely." 
Former President Clinton urged mourners to follow in her footsteps, honor her husband's saerif'iee and help the eouple's children fulfill their parents' legacy. Former President Bush said the "world is a kinder and gentler plaee because of Coretta Seott King." President Carter praised the Kings f'or their ability to "wage a fip,rce struggle for freedom and justiee and to do it peacefully." 
The funeral at times turned political, with some speakers decrying the war in Iraq, the Bush adminis­tration's eavesdropping program, and the sluggish response to Hurricane Katrina in mostly black New Orleans. 


The Hev. Joseph Lowery, who eo-founded the Southern Christian Lnadership Conference with Martin Luther King Jr., drew a roaring stand­ing ovation when he said: "For war, billions more, but no more for the poor" -a takeoff on a line from a Stevie Wonder song. The comment drew head shakes from Bush and his father as they sat behind the pulpit. 
The lavish serviee stood in sharp contrast to the 1968 funeral for King's husband. President Lyndon 
B. Johnson did not attend those serviees, which were hnld in the mueh smaller and older Ebenezer Church in Atlanta, where King had preached. 
Coretta Seott King's body was to be placed in a crypt m~ar her husband's tomb at the King Center. which she built to promote his memo­ry. The crypt is inscribed with a passage from First Corinthians: "And now abide Faith, Hope, Love,· These Thrne; but the great­est of these is Love." 
Over the past snveral days, more than 160,000 mourners waited in long lines to pay their respects and file past King's open casket during viewings at ehurehes and the Gnorgia Capitol, where King became thn first woman and the first black person to lie in honor. 
"She made many great saerifices," said Sean· Washington, 38, who drovn from Tampa, Fla., with his wife and children from a disability centnr to attnnd the funeral. "To be in lwr presenee once more is something that I would def­inite(~ cherish, no matter what.

NATO troops fire on protestors 
Associated Press 
KABUL -International peacekeep­ers clashed Tuesday with Afghans protesting drawings of the Prophet Muhammad, leaving three demonstra­tors dead and prompting NATO to send reinforenments to a remote northern dty. 
Senior Afghan ollkials said ai-Qaida and the Taliban could be exploiting anger ovnr the cartoons to indtn vio­lnnce, whieh spread to at least six cities in a seeond day of bloody unrest in Afghanistan. 

Demonstrations rumbled on around the Muslim world, and the politieal repereussions deepened, with Iran suspending all trade and economic ties with Denmark, where the draw­ings were first published. The Danish prime minister called thn protnsts a global erisis and appealed for calm. 
In a new turn, a prominent Iranian newspaper, llamshahri, invited artisl<> to enter a I lolocaust cartoon competi­tion, saying it wanted to see if frnndom of expression -the banner under which many Western publications reprinted the prophet drawings ­also applied to Iloloeaust images. 
The drawings -including onn depicting the prophet wearing a tur­ban shaped as a bomb -havn touched a raw nerve among Muslims. Islam is interprntnd to forbid any illus­trations of Muhammad for foar they eould lead to idolatry.

Teen found guilty in family murder case 
Associated Press 
ALAMOGORDO, N.M.-Jurors convicted a 16-year-old boy Tuesday of killing his family and hiding their bodies in a manure pile on newsman Sam Donaldson's ranch in southern New Mexico. 
Cody Posey was found guilty of murder in the deaths of his step­mother and stepsister and vol­untary manslaughter in the death of his father, who worked as Donaldson's ranch foreman.

the teen's shoul­der. 
"I just held him like I would my own son," Mitchell said. 
The jury, which heard three weeks of testimony, began delib­erating on Monday. 
Posey was arrested a few days after the bodies of his father and stepmother, Paul and Tryone Posey, and his 13-year-old step­sister, Mary Lee Schmid, were found on Donaldson's Chavez Canyon Ranch in July 2004. 
Prosecutor Janice Schryer claimed that Posey's parents were loving, but said the youth didn't like ranch life and "took the opportunity to relieve him­self of those expectations and that life." 
Mitchell argued that the teen, who was 14 at the time of the slayings, was abused by his par­ents. 

He described years of physical and psychological abuse and said the flashpoint to the mur­ders came when Paul Posey burned the boy with a metal welding rod after the teen refused to have sex with his stepmother the night before the slayings. 
On a videotape shown to the jury, Posey tearfully said he shot his stepmother first so she wouldn't call 911, then killed his father, then Mary

Posey could face life in prison on the first-degree murder charge in the death of his step­sister. State District Judge Waylon Counts said a sentencing hearing would be scheduled within 30 days. 
Verlin Posey, brother of Paul Posey, told reporters outside the courthouse he was pleased with the verdict but disappointed the teen wasn't convicted of first­degree murder in his brother's death. 
"I didn't like it, but I can live with it," he said. 
Ellen Brust, whose son was married to Cody's biological mother, spent two weeks attend­ing the trial. She offered her support for the boy. 
Katrina victims homeless 
Thousands are evicted from hotels, few have any idea where to go 
Associated Press 

NEW ORLEANS -Hauling everything he owned in a plas­tic garbage bag, Darryl Travis walked out of the chandeliered lobby of the Crowne Plaza, joining the exodus of Hurricane Katrina refugees evicted from their hotel rooms across the country Tuesday. 
The occupants of more than 4,500 government-paid hotel rooms were ordered to turn in their keys Tuesday, as the Federal Emergency Management Agency began cutting off money to pay for their stays. 
Far more people -the occu­pants of at least 20,000 hotel rooms, many of which housed entire families -were given extensions by FEMA until at least next week and possibly until March 1, said FEMA spokesman Butch Kinerney. 
FEMA said it gave people every possible opportunity to request an extension. 
"We've bent over backward to reach out. We've gone door­to-door to all of the 25,000 hotel rooms no fewer than six times. And there are individu­als who have refused to come to the door, refused to answer. There are people who have run when they saw us coming -those are the ones that are now moving on," Kinerney said. 
FEMA maintains that as many as 80 percent of those being forced to check out this week have made other living arrangements, ranging from trailers to receiving federal rent assistance to living with relatives. 
While many of the evacuees leaving the Crowne Plaza said they had found other housing, several said they were now homeless. 
Travis, 24, and his five child­hood friends -all in their 20s -had been living on the floor of another evacuee's hotel room, never having registered. 
"All I got is a couple pairs of pants and some shirts. The pressure is on," said Jonathan Gautier, 26, one of the six, who was also carrying a single plas­tic bag filled with clothes. 
Wheeling out her boxes of 
percent either failed to contact FEMA or made other housing arrangements, said Frank Michel, a spokesman for Mayor Bill White. 
"People need to begin to take responsibility for themselves," Michel said. 
In New York, around 50 pro­testers including both evacuees and activists gathered at the steps of City Hall to protest the evictions. 
In Oakland, Calif., demon­strators carrying signs and chanting "Evict FEMA" tried to present an eviction notice to employees at a FEMA branch

"They just connected it yes­terday," Kinkella said as she loaded bags, boxes and suit­cases into the back of a pickup on the curb outside the hotel.

The U.S. Treasury Department confirmed that the Hotel Maria 
Isabel Sheraton in Mexico City was told to expel the Cuban delegation in compliance with the U.S. embargo against business with Cuba or Cubans. The meet­ing was moved to a Mexican-owned hotel Saturday. 
"The hotel in Mexico City is a 
U.S. subsidiary, and therefore prohibit­ed from providing a service to Cuba or Cuban nationals." said Brookly 
'The hotel in Mexico City is a U.S. subsidiary, and therefore prohibited from providing a service 
to Cuba or Cuban nationals." 
Brookly Mclaughlin Office of Foreign Assets Control spokesman 
McLaughlin, a spokesman for the department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. He was referring to the Helms-Burton law, which tightened U.S. trade sanctions first imposed against Cuba in 1961. 
"The hotel acted in accor­dance with U.S. sanctions," he said. 
The hotel -part of the chain of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. -said in a statement it "deeply regrets this incident and any inconvenience it may have caused." 
The statement said Starwood's policy "is not to discriminate against any person because of their nationality or any other reason, and to always respect the laws of countries where its hotels are located." 
Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Luis Ernesto Derbez said the Mexican government is considering a diplomatic com­plaint against the United States in the case. 
He said his department had formally started a complaint process against the Sheraton for violating investment and trade protection laws, and that the hotel would have 15 days to respond. The hotel could face fines of nearly $500,000 or even be shut down, officials said. 
"I think that there was evident contempt for Mexican law on the part of the Hotel Maria Isabel Sheraton ... and it is going to be punished for discrimina­tion, consumer fraud and, more­over, for applying laws that do not apply in Mexico," Derbez told reporters in London, where he is on an official visit. 
About 30 people protested outside the hotel on Tuesday, waving Mexican and Cuban flags and yelling "Get out Yankees!" The demonstrators plastered the glass doors with signs reading "Shut down" and "Closed for bowing to U.S. impe­rialism and harming national 
sovereignty." 
U.S. 
efforts to extend its embar­go of Cuba across international bor­ders led to a burst of patriotic indignation in Mexico, Canada and other coun­tries in 1996, producing "anti­dote laws" meant to outlaw compli­ance with the 

U.S. 
measures. 


For the most part, the laws went largely unenforced. But

VANCOUVER, British Columbia -Canada unveiled a 16-million acre park Tuesday, a protected area more than twice the size of Yellowstone, teeming with grizzly bears, wolves and wild salmon in the ancestral home of many native tribes. 
Closing another chapter of the wars between environ­mentalists and loggers, the Great Bear Rainforest is the result of an accord between governments, aboriginal First Nations, the logging industry and environmentalists. 
It will stretch 250 miles along British Columbia's rugged Pacific coastline ­the ancestral home of groups whose cultures date back thousands of years. The area also sustains a rare white bear found only in British Columbia. 
"The agreement on these areas represents an unprece­dented collaboration between First Nations, industry, local governments and many other stakeholders in how we man­age the vast richness of B.C.'s coast for the benefit of all British Columbians," said Premier Gordon Campbell, who was accompanied by native dancers and drum­mers for the announcement and formal First Nations blessing.

now the hotel chain finds itself trapped between a U.S. govern­ment intent on punishing Cuba and a Mexican government fear­ful of seeming weak in an elec­tion year. 
Other U.S. companies could face a similar dilemma. 
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the United States had been contact­ed by Mexico regarding the inci­dent. He declined to give more details. 
Kirby Jones, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade Association, which hosted the event, noted that a Starwood-owned hotel in Cancun, Mexico, had hosted similar conferences between Cuban officials and U.S. busi­ness representatives without incident. 
The three-day energy meeting, which wrapped up Saturday, was the first private-sector oil summit between Cuba and the United States.

"This innovative rainforest agreement provides a real world example of how people and wilderness can prosper together." 
Canada, the Sierra Club of Canada and ForestEthies, the Nature Conservancy, Tides Canada Foundation and several private

The events of the last two weeks have convinced me unequivocally that I am not normal -at least what normal is here. I mean:I liked "The Vagina Monologues" when I saw them in my first year. I liked them so much I went the next year and bought a T-shirt. And even then, I joined the cast of the show last year and wrote an op-ed interviewing organ­izers and actresses on what the V-day movement means to them at Notre Dame. For whatev­er odd reason, something in the play spoke to me, each year drawing me back to see and support it. I am Catholic and so far living in the full spirit of teaching on sexuality. Yet, "Vagina Monologues" addressed an important issue in my life -violence against women, which I witnessed in my home life. Nowhere else on cam­pus were people talking about rape and domestic violence but at "The Vagina Monologues." So I was glad for the show. 
Then the [former! Queer Film Festival. Not being gay, I was also drawn to this event. I felt I was toler­ant, meaning I did not want to see or hear anything about it. Later, I came to know and befriend many gay stu­dents at Notre Dame and relate with their feelings of marginalization and alienation for who they were. I too felt similar, having a minority back­ground, and felt that if I could learn more about the experiences of people struggling to belong to their commu­nities through some films, it would be up my alley. 
What I actually found were some intriguing, fun and engaging movies about love, relationships and finding yourself. There is nothing really dif-

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

ferent about the [former] Queer Film Festival than any other series of film showings because the challenges of the human condition -composing yourself amidst a lot of crap, finding someone to love you despite your crazy flaws and trying to be good for something in the world -do not change with sexual orientation. These events, made square-peg-like me feel a little more normal at Notre Dame because a bunch of'people liked these events and wanted to have this dialogue. 
I am perplexed as to how these events present the epitome of what is threatening the Catholic character and student life of this University. Where to begin? Daily, I am plagued with worry about things that are threatening our integrity and collec­tive Catholic soul more than "The Vagina Monologues." It keeps me up nights thinking that no worker on this campus will believe Notre Dame is Catholic because we do not pay a living wage or have a union -both rights demanded by Catholic social tradition. I am really worried Notre Dame football fans do not think the University is Catholic because mili­tary planes fly over the stadium, while Catholic teaching says we should be making peace and not par­ticipating in the death of people in war. I am concerned that prospective students will not know Notre Dame is Catholic because the weekend activi­ties of binge drinking do not include holy wine. 
Mostly I am really concerned that students do not know the fullest teaching of Nostra Aetate-the 1965 document declaring the spiritual bond between Jews and Christians of sharing a relationship with God and a justice tradition to bring about a heaven on this earth -since we had no type of events to celebrate the 40th anniversary of this document and erasure of a Catholic theology of contempt for Judaism. It was only two weeks ago I heard a Notre Dame leader even allude to the document, sadly not to elaborate on anti­Semitism found in Catholic theology, not to explain the particulars of the document nor to announce a speeial briefing on Vatican II teaching on Judaism before the upcoming show­ing of Anti-Semitic works of art including "The Merchant of Venice" and the "Passion of the Christ." Where was University President Father John Jenkins talking about Nostra Aetate and the Jewish-ness of Jesus not displayed in the film when Jim Caviezel led students in the rosary? It made me sick hearing this teaching thrown out there so conve­niently and glibly when the person saying it has not shown a commit­ment to furthering the teaching on campus at important junctures. Moreover, at the student address, Jenkins did not even say Nostra Aetate as he did to the faculty, but made sure to reiterate Hitler thoughts on Jewry to hammer the point home. But, I am the abnormal one, remember. 
If my affection for the two naughty events, justice for workers, ending domestic violnnce and Nostra Aetate make me atypical, I say thank God. II' you be as abnormal as I, good luck to you, because the future of expressing yourself though campus program­ming is looking dim. 
Kamaria Porter is a senior history major who wishes like Curtis Leighton -who is tall and honorable -that we had a Jewish studies minor and believes Jews and Christians Throughout History should be a required class to ·graduate. !-)he's going to be a community organ­izer for the IAF. She can be contacted at kporter@nd. edu ifyou haoe no idea what that is. 
The views expressed in this column are those of the author and not nec­essarily those of The Observer. 

Academic freedom and common sense 
I have followed with interest through The Observer's excellent coverage the controversy respecting "The Vagina Monologues" and the Queer Film Festival and would like to note with gratitude the note of uncommon good sense introduced by Meaghan Garvey in her letter of Feb. 1. I suspect that if everyone who has not read the Monologues remained silent, the volume of the debate would strikingly diminish and its substance markedly improve. I suppose most might agree that academic free­dom of broad scope is of central importance. So, too, is maintenance of the University's Catholic character; and accordingly there must be limits to academic freedom, but close cases should be resolved in its favor. Accordingly, where there is tension, proper resolution depends on the facts of the particular case. I'm not sure much more can usefully be said in terms of guiding principles -though a great deal more certainly is being said. 
For my part, I supposed that the fuss over the Monologues was probably unwarranted -until I read the play. Then the question became, for me, not open to rea­sonable debate. Violence against women is but a footnote -just a handful of pages. The body of the play is a paean, couched in the most graphic language in the rele­vant lexicon, to illicit sex of all varieties short of bestiality (including sexual seduction of a minor by an adult). Strip those passages, and there is no play. If the University may not exercise control respecting this play, it is hard to imagine any meaningful bounds to academic freedom. 
As to the Festival, ol'le should know not simply the films, but, more importantly, the public stance of the panelists and the messages they brought. I know something of the former and can reasonably infer the lattnr; but to discuss this would unduly extend this letter and perhaps blur my purpose, which is simply to commend Garvey's commnnts for your readers' consideration.

Beyond either-or 
freedom applies to other faculty members at Notre Dame and, in its respective way, to students &'i well. A<; an intellectual commu­nity we have critically important academic opportunities that are lacking at higher­ranked, sneular institutions and vitally needed by the wider world. 
Nothing in University President Father John Jenkins' address suggest<; any threat to this expansive aeademie freedom that we enjoy at Notre Dame. Rather, he ha<; asked whether Notre Dame, as a Catholic univer­sity, should oblige itself officially to sponsor cerutin events which "in name or content dearly and egregiously" are "contrary to or ineonsistent with the fundamental values of a Catholic university," such that Notre Dame would bo or would seem to be sanc­tioning something which, as Catholic, it simultaneously professes to oppose. Jenkins ha'i suggested that it should not, lest it act or seem to act self-contradictorily. 
Jenkins' position is more complex than some of his crities have alleged, although in my view it needs furthtw dew~lopment and rnvision. Some responses thus far have rm:ast what he said in crude, "good vs. evil" binaries eharaeteristie of our debased national politkal discourse and of funda­mentalisms of all kinds. This does not seem productive. Jenkins' address prodsely does not a<;sume or imply a simplistic, zero-sum game: either we plaee no restrictions on any publk event officially sponsored by the university and thereby become "greater" and ostensibly more Catholie (or incremen­tally more secular'?) because more "inclu­sive;" or we formulate restrictions which, no matter how carefully articulated and prudently implemented in choosing not to sponsor enrta.in public events. anl umta­mount to censorship and mark us as a ret­rograde, conservative ba'>tion unworthy of the appellation "university," indifferent to our studenL'i, certain to lose top faculty and donor dollars and bound for ignominy as a third-rate institution. In this scenario it is all or nothing, greatness versus embarra<;s­ment, real university versus pseudo-univer­sity. Either we're liberated or we're oppres­sively Catholic. 
Such a dichotomy har; little if any bar;is in what Jenkins said. At the same time, ques­tions about the relationship between spon­sorship and endorsement merit serious con­sideration. For example, might an event dearly inimical to Catholicism be sponsored a'i part of legitimate inquiry and a stimulus to discussion, yet insistence on its regular repetition and/or expansion suggest endorsement and imply a political advocacy that goes beyond academic freedom? If so, then there might be a point at whieh repeated sponsorship connotes endorse­ment; a one-time or occasional perform­ance of "The Vagina Monologues" or an equally controversial event would be regarded differently than its regular repeti­tion. A test of the University's commitment to academic freedom might be its willing­ness to sponsor almost any event, even those inimical to Catholic values; a test of its Catholic character might be its willingness not to sponsor that same event over and over, lest it seem to be evangelizing in a sus­tained manner against itr; own mission. 
Jenkins' request for "careful listening" and "reasoned argument" is not well served by creating caricatures and taking sides. The University ean and I hope will do more, as Jenkins pledged he would, to oppose all forms of violence against women in a foeused and sustained manner, aeknowl­edging the deep concerns, genuine f(mrs and horrific experiences of those who champion Ensler's play. In no respect should these be minimized or marginalized. Yet our concerns and actions should also acknowledge wider realities. In university settings, date rape is an appallingly wide­spread form of violence against women. Multiple studies have shown tho high per­centage of date rape cases in which one or both parties had been drinking aleohol. often heavily. It would seem, then, that if beyond raising awareness and generating discussion, we earn about redudng actual violence against women at Notre Dame, students should join faculty and administra­tors in doing everything possible to discour­age excessive alcohol eonsumption and espedally binge drinking. Or do we imagine a wonderland in which studenl'> party as much as they wish, date rape disappears and no one regrel<; upon waking up the hooking-up of the night before? 
Jenkins' address raises complex ques­tions. Let us seek to formulate fitting answers. I see no obvious models for us in the endeavor to create a Catholic, great research university in this age. But this open-endedness L'> precisely what is exciting <J,nd important about Notre Dame and its ambitions: we are being invited to partici­pate in an original exercL<;e of institution­building, not to submit to the patterns and conform to the precedents of other institu­tions. 
Sectarian Catholic universities such as the Franciscan University of Steubenville or Ave Maria University can oller no instruction. They are not research universities, and their missions seem too narrowly, inwardly Catholic to allow for (in Jenkins' words) "a variety of views expressed vigorously, even 
thoso contrary to deep values of 
Catholicism." Rejecting such institutions IL'> 
models doubtless will displmL'in thos1~ 
Catholics who want to refashion Notre 
Dame in their imagn and likeness. 
Neither will the best private secular uni­versities such as Sumford or Princllton suf­fice for Notre Dame. We must lnarn all that we can from them, f(lr they have mueh to teach us, but we cannot uncritieally mimic them without forsaking our Cat.l10lie identi­ty. They forf(lited commitment to thnir rdi­gious traditions (or in some ea'ies never had one) and forbid consideration of religious positions on thoir own terms in thn ci<L'is­room. Rejneting such institutions a<; models doubtless will displna<;n those uneasy wit.h Notre Dame's Catholic charaetnr, particular­ly if they equate secularization with progress and hopn that the University will eventually "get ovnr the whole Catholic thing." 
Finally, traditionally Catholic universities whose Catl10lic identity IHL'i benn perhaps irretrievably eompromised will not do. They are dillieult to distinguish from sneular uni­versities in all but cerutin devotional respect<;. Their lack of' vigorous diswssion about how to be both lirst-ratn and Catholic lbstnred thnir uncriticalnmulation of highly ranknd, sneular institutions. A'i a n~sult, they appnar to have f(wf(litnd any serious commitment to Catholicism and Catholic intelleetual traditions. H1~jecting such insti­tutions &'> models doubtless will displmL'in those who think that Catholidsm 's "univer­sality" should oblige Notre Dame to sponsor all things for all pnople. But a university that gauges it'> identity primarily by how much it tolerates, that speaks of truth only as something to be pursund and never <L'i someone already incarnate and that is embarr&'iSfld to be a witness because it no longer knows what it is witnessing to, is arguably no longer a Catholic university. 
A'> it is, we are uniquely and questioningly Notre Dame. Now all of us, faculty, student'> and alumni, have been invited to partidpate in becoming Notre Dame, helping to build a Catholic, great research university by dar­ing to discover how to be different a<; well as similar, by exercising our minds critically, and by refusing to simplify complex ques­tions.

Survivor advocate, 'Vagina Monologues' speak for victims 
I've bnnn a rape victim advocate for quitn somn time. I have completed two snxual1L'isault training courses for a total of nnarly 100 hours of training. I've handled dozens of hospital calls and spontaneous dL<;dosuros from friends, rel­at.ivns and strangers. I have seen as many dillernnt reac­tions to thesn experienees IL'i I have survivors. I have tried to livn through nach orw with the survivor a'> if it wa'i my own expnrienee. I'm what you eould call a "rapn expert," if such a thing exisL<;. 
A'> an advocate, you arn uwght that there are three things that are thn most imporumt to convey to a survivor. Tell the survivor that you believe him or her. Tell the survivor that hn or shn hiL'i options. Finally, tell the survivor that, no mat­ter what, what happ11rwd was not his or hnr fault. Period. Nothing you do, say, take or drink entitles someone to 1L'>sault you. Nothing. 
I think that convincing a survivor that thn assault wa'i not his or hnr fault is the most ditneult of the three. We arn all proJ.,rrammPd along thn way to think that the things we do and say "muse" sexual a<;sault. Short skirts, drinking too mw:h and making tim dedsion to go up to somnone's room alorw are d<L'isie exarnplns of ways we find to blamn sur­vivors fi1r whatlHL'i happmwd to them. Even if we don't think we do it, we do. Wn expnd survivors to be rnsponsible fi1r tlw behavior of another person. We expect them to answer fi1r their own choices and justify their "role" in pro­voking that behavior. We expeel. survivors to explain how and why they got themselves raped. 
I suspect that Brian MacMichael didn't intend to demon­strate one of the most eomplicated and compelling reasons why "The Vagina Monologues" is so important when he wrote in to the Viewpoint section on Monday. But he ha'>. MacMichael probably wouldn't ever ask a survivor outright what he or she was wearing on the night of the a<;sault and comment on how that choice brought on the attaek. But he would a'ik the women performing "The Vagina Monologues" why they eater to the "ba<;e sexual pa<>sions of male viewers." No, these two things are not the same ... exaetly. But both questions a'>k the object (victim or per­former) to answer fiJr the bnhavior of the subject (perpetra­tor or audience member). Following this Iogie all the way down the slippery slope leaves us back where we started­in a world where women cannot speak out, eannot tell their stories and must answer for the actions of another. 
Nowhere in his letter does MaeMiehael hold his sexually ravenous male viewers aeeountable as part of the greater problem of violenee. This is eommonly the result of sexual assault-a survivor is asked to justi!y his or her actions while the perpetrator never answers for the crime. Women's lives are our lives. Our experiences are our expe­riences. Women must not be forced to censor our lives and experiences to make up for the possibility that these experi­ences will be viewed a<; an invitation to objectify us -or to rape us. We are not responsible. We cannot, and will not, answer for the behavior of others. We must work to changn the possibility that women will bn viewed IL'> objeet'i -or assaulted -instead of a<;king wom1m to eensor their lives. 
MacMichael's view of "The Vagina Monologues" also espouses a view of men which I, frankly, lind oflimsive and, for the most part, inaecuratn. I'm sure that them am men who go see the play fi1r il<; frank diseussions of sexuality and female genitalia. I'm sum them aro a fi~w. But many, and even most, of the men who go to see the play go fi1r the right reasons. They may have a f.,rirlfriend who wa'i IL'isault­ed, a mother who endured years of domestic violence or a sister who WIL'> abused a<; a ehild. Men can be, and are, mueh more earing, eomplL'isionato and snnsitivn crnaturns than MacMiehael seems to think. I will bn sitting nnxt to one of them at "The VaJ.,rina Monologuns" this Monday night. lie has stood by me through thick and thin, supported me through everything that h<L'i crossed my path. lin h<L'i bmm my best li'iend for many years and will mntinun to be for many more. lie is an example of the best ofwhat men can be for womfm. And I doubt that hn is tho only one out thnre. Many men are "getting it"-and I hope t.hat MaeMiduwl will be one of them.

MOVIE REVIEWS 

.Medieval period piece offers thrills, romance 
By ERIN MCGINN Scene Critic 

Most people know about the romance of Romeo and Juliet or the legendary love between King Arthur and Guinevere, but fewer are aware of the mythic tale of Tristan and Isolde. 
This movie, based on a Celtic fable, begins in England after the fall of Home and during a time when England is struggling to find its own foothold. Standing in the way is the King of Ireland, who mercilessly controls the land of Briton. 
Lord Marke of Cornwall (Rufus Sewell, "A Knight's Tale") wants to keep the tribes of Briton united to eventually fight King Donnchadh of Ireland (David Patrick O'Hara) for their own land. The first scene of "Tristan & Isolde" depicts a brutal Irish invasion where 
against the Irish. After a series of battles and events, the injured Tristan winds up under the care of Isolde (Sophia Myles, "Underworld"), the daughter of King Donnchadh of Ireland. Tristan and Isolde keep their true identities hidden from the other, and their forbidden love flourishes. 
Once Tristan returns to Briton, he agrees to fight in representation of Lord Marke in a tournament held in Ireland, where the win­ner is given the hand of the Irish princess, Isolde. Tristan wins the tournament and must give his beloved over to his adoptive father. Their lo.ve must be continually kept secret and is forbidden more than ever before. The second half of the movie con­sists of their dangerous love affair in Briton and the continual trials of Briton to become one body against the Irish.

Newest name in horror films delivers 
By MARK BEMENDERFER Assistant Scene Editor 

"Eli Roth" is a name for which horror aficionados should watch. In an age of remakes, sequels and tired genres, he's practically a solitary beacon of origi­nality in a stagnant sea. 
His latest work is the recently released "Hostel." Half "Eurotrip," half horror film, it manages to raise itself above the recent flood of uninspired tripe. That's not to say that the movie is without flaws, however. 
Much like Roth's earlier work, "Hostel" isn't a perfect movie. His pre­vious movie, "Cabin Fever," was a cre­ative homage to classical horror movies while standing well on its own. However, it left a little to be demanded in terms of plot and pacing. 
"Hostel" would have profited immensely from being a longer resourceful European, Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson), who joins in their escapades in Amsterdam. 
While in Amsterdam, Josh, Paxton and Oli meet a Russian named Alex, played by Lubomir Bukovy. He recom­mends a spot further inland, a place that is supposedly virgin country for tourists. They agree to the plan and journey inward by train. After a run-in with a strange individual, they arrive to find all the reports were true and the country is perfect for tourists. 
Things are obviously not as they seem, however, ~nd people begin to disappear. This is when the movie ceases to be a raunchy teen comedy and veers sharply into the realm of horror. It is also where the film falters a little. 
The film doesn't emphasize the hor­ror enough. It turns from an effective, unique horror into a rather standard revenge flick. While this doesn't

been better exe­cuted if it had been played out longer. The movie did a commendable job building up to the first climax, then doesn't hold it long enough to sustain to the end of the film. 
The horror-related elements are highly effective, however. The situa­tions in which the characters find themselves are as realistic as they are dangerous, making the film more chill-ing for viewers. It's a decent thriller that interested audiences should appreciate. 

Fans of movie gore will also have reasons to watch the film. Fingers, hamstrings and eyes all meet disas­trous ends to sharp instruments, mean~ ing the weak-at-heart should not apply. 
Fans of the famous Japanese director Takashi Miike should watch the film as well, as he makes a guest appearance about halfway through. For those unfa­miliar with the name, he has directed some famous foreign movies like "Audition," "Ichi the Killer" and "Dead or Alive." 
"Hostel" is obviously not for every­one. Violent and raunchy, the film caters to only a select audience. That audience will find some enjoyment, even if the film isn't perfect. 
Everyone else will probably be better off watching more light-hearted fare.

aspects, keeping a brisk pace throughout the flick. 
As previously stated, the first half of the movie plays in a similar fashion to "National Lampoon's Eurotrip." Two recent college graduates, Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson), are treating themselves on a trip through the major teenager and young-adult spots in Europe. They meet up with an off-kilter but 
duties. Although 

Reynolds didn't find favor with his epic "Waterworld," his histor­ically-themed films such as "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" have helped him learn how to create compelling worlds of warring nations in earlier centuries. 
"Tristan and Isolde" attempts to please all parties viewing the movie. The romantic viewers are given love scenes and become involved in the doomed romance. The movie also relishes in violent battle scenes between the tribes of Briton and the Irish. While each group of scenes have their OWn merit, the trouble comes in the transition between the scenes. The movie feels uneven at times when it switches back and forth between the two moods. 
The performances of the actors are good, but not outstanding. The truly standout per­formance belongs to Rufus Sewell, who plays Lord Marke. What really draws the viewers into the love triangle is that Sewell portrays a truly likeable character. While the audience longs for Tristan and Isolde to be together, the viewers are also sympathet­ic to the plight of Lord Marke. James Franco is a very attractive Tristan, and while he is convincing, he isn't very com­pelling -although this is more due to a lack of character development in the script rather than Franco's performance. Myles' Isolde is pretty, but again, there is a lack of deep character development. 
Overall, "Tristan & Isolde" is a good romance with plenty of adventure and bat­tles to entertain both sexes, though it does­n't amount to much more than that.

DIRECTOR OF THE DIVERSE: A 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Scene Writer 
Through a deeade-long eareer that has taken him from Taiwan to New York to llollywood, Ang Lee has become one of the world's most rnspeetod directors. 
Ang Len was born in Taiwan in 1954 and later graduated from the National Taiwan Collegn of' Arts. His life then brought him to the United States, where he graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a Baehelor of Finn Arts degren and then from Nnw York University with an Master of' Fine Arts de~-,rree. While at NYU, he was an assistant dirnetor on Spike Lee's stu­dnnt film. ".Joe's Bed Study Barbershop: We Cut Ileads" {1983). 
Af'tnr graduating. his directorial debut came with the film "Pushing Hands" in 1992. This film nwolves around an ageing Tai Chi master who moves in with his son in New York. This causes conllkt with the son's novelist wifn, who suiTors writer's block becausn of the presence of the father. The film focusnd on generational conflicts and metaphorically placed the 
PROFILE OF ANG LEE 
conflict on the Tai Chi technique of "push­ing hands." 
His next film, "The Wedding Banquet," was released in 1993. It included the gen­erational conllkt of the first fllm but also presented Lee's first film in which part of the conflict involved characters who are homosexual (he returned to this topic with "Brokebaek Mountain"). A young homo­sexual Taiwanese man must fake a wed­ding for his conservative parents so that they do not discover he is living with his partner. This film was a critieal suecess, earning Golden Globe and Oscar nomina­tions. It also won a Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. 
After 'The Wedding Banquet," Lee eom­pleted the trilogy of films dealing with Taiwanese culture with "Eat Drink Man Woman" in 1994. This film garnered a Best Foreign Language Oscar nomination. Lee then went on to direct his first major llollywood film, an adaptation of Jane Austen's "Sense and Sensibility," in 1995. This film was nominated for a Best Picture Osear and won the Best Adapted screen­play Oscar. With a major Hollywood film under his belt, Lee went on to create what many regard as his best film, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in 2000. 
This film brought Lee's love for the land­scape shot to the fore, a technique he would later use when filming Weste(n America for "Brokeback Mountain." The plot was a complex weave of love, loyalty, want and loss. He was inspired by watch­ing wuxiapian films, a Hong Kong style involving knight-errant characters and theatrics. In an attempt to connect with his heritage, he filmed parts of the lilm on the mainland of China, resulting in beauti­ful shots of deserts, mountains and forests, along with stunning fight sequences, choreographed by "The Matrix" maestro Yuen Wu-Ping. "Crouehing Tiger, Hidden Dragon" became the highest grossing foreign lan­guage film in history, nominated for Best Picture and Best Director and winning four Oscars, including Best Cinematography and Best Foreign Language Film. 
Lee then took a three-year hiatus before returning in 2003 with the comic book adaptation "Hulk." It received some eriti­cal support but was accused of being too psychological and lacking in aetion. Then, in 2005, Lee returned to drama with "Brokeback Mountain," adapted from the short story by E. Annie Proulx about two homosexual ranch hands who fall in Jove while working together in Wyoming. Though thn topic of some controversy, Lee handles the topie beautifully, showcasing emotionally impacting performances from Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal and presenting gorgeous shots of the American West. This film has bmm nomi­nated for Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards, along with a Best Direetor nod for Lne and a Best Aetor nod for Ledger. 
Lee is noted for his filmic diversity. lie choosns wide-ranging topics. moving skill­fully from a Jane Austen adaptation to a Hong Kong-style epic to a love story between two ranch hands. I lis topics also promote diversity and discussion, as most of his films are eoncerned with Chinese culture or homosexuality {or both in "The Wedding Banquet"). With his skillful use of the camera and the pnrfimnances he is able to illieit from his actors, he is one of' the best living directors in Arnnriea.

DVD REVIEWS 

'Hustle and Flow' a hip-hop masterpiece 
By CHRIS MCGRADY Assistant Scene Editor 

Pimpin' ain't easy. Neither is good acting. But in the ftlm "Hustle and Flow," front­man Terrence Howard, who plays the lead character DJay, proves that both have a place in modern cinema. 
"Hustle and Flow" is written and directed by Craig Brewer and is a new look at the world of underground rap. The film is simi­lar to Eminem's breakout movie "8 Mile"­except in place of Eminem, it has a real actor, and in place of a bad movie, it has a good one. Other than that, the idea is the same: meet the poor man from the streets and watch him try to make it as a rapper. 
Howard, who was nominated for an Academy Award for "Best Actor" for his role, plays an embattled street-hustler pimp named DJay who is constantly fighting a battle to make enough money to pay the rent. In between dealing marijuana and soliciting prostitutes, DJay is trying to find a way to keep his sanity in a world permeated by sex, drugs and violence. After a late­night rendezvous at a strip club, DJay is confronted by a homeless man who sells-him an electronic Casio keyboard for a dime-bag of drugs. Little did DJay know 
that the keyboard would change his life. 
Soon thereafter, DJay meets up with an old high-school friend Key (played by Anthony Anderson), who owns a recording company. With some testy lyrics (including the catchy line "whoop that trick") and some surprisingly cleanly-cut music tracks (Dr. Dre who?), DJay begans to produce his own brand of Memphis-southern rap out of the back room of his dilapidated home. His only shot at fame, however, is to push his demo tape to Skinny Black (played by Ludacris), a home-grown Memphis rapper who has all but completely forgotten his roots. 
This movie is powerful for several rea­sons, and overall, it was nominated for 15 different awards. 
Howard's role is key, and he plays it mas­terfully. DJay is meant to be the type of character who is both loved and hated, and Howard's control over this part is the rea­son this movie shines. On some levels, the viewer feels sorry for DJay -his plight is all but hopeless, as he lives a life of crime. On other levels, the audience has to feel a disdain for DJay -he solicits women for his own needs. But realistically, DJay is caught in· a web of sin that he cannot escape without help, and this help is from his music. His lyrics speak of the pain of his 
position, the struggles of liv­ing on the streets as a hus­tler and of trying to find a purpose in his corrupt life. Eventually, through his tri­als, DJay realizes the women he prostitutes have dreams just as much as he does and seeks to provide for them as well. 
The music in the movie is surprisingly decent, espe­cially considering all of DJay's tracks are performed by Howard himself. The tracks have hints of Nelly's St. Louis style, as well as rapper DMX, and it's easy to begin swaying to the music. The supporting roles are as important as Howard's and played well by Anderson, as well as Nola (Taryn Manning), one of DJay's prostitutues. 


The movie seems to give a true feel to the underground world of rap in the poorest neighborhoods in the country and helps the audience to identify with the personal strug­gles ofDJay and his clan. 
The movie is as much a "hood-flick" as it is a film about spiritual and personal growth. Howard's character visibly changes throughout the movie and grows increas­ingly on the viewer. By the end of the movie, it is hard not to root for DJay and his cause, which ends up being about much more than music. It is about hopes and dreams and the message that even those in the most down-trodden of states possess them.

Bay's latest an underrated sci-fi thriller 
By SEAN SWEANY Scene Critic 

Would you be willing to prolong your life for 60 to 70 years for the cost of $5 million? What ifthat meant creating a clone of your­self that could feel. think and love just like you can and then killing that clone in order to save your own life? 
The issues at hand in a situation like this are not that far fetched and are tackled in the recently-released DVD "The Island." 
This 2005 film by Michael Bay ("Armageddon") explores not only the question of what it is to be a human but how humans can play God with the lives of others. The film begins with viewers know­ing little more than the protagonist, Lincoln Six Eeho (Ewan McGnOJgor, "Big Fish," the "Star Wars" prequels). Echo believes he is a survivor of a worldwide contamination and lives in a seemingly utopian environment. He and other "survivors" await removal to "The Island," the last uneontaminated spot on Earth. 
Lincoln soon discovers that his life is a lie and that there is no "Island." When his best friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson, "Lost in Translation") is select­ed to go to the Island, he escapes with her. They receive help from an employee at the company, played by Steve Buscemi ("The Big Lebowski," "Armageddon"), who tells them that they are clones of wealthy people who plan to harvest their organs when they themselves become sick. From here, the two embark on a high-octane adventure to alert the world to the crimes committed at the cloning facility. 
The first part of 'The Island" is straight up sci-fi and feels much like 2002's "Minority Report." After Lincoln and Jordan escape, the movie becomes a typical Michael Bay action movie, in the vein of "The Rock," "Armageddon" and "Bad Boys." Bay pulls off some white-knuckle action scenes, including a very long high­speed chase scene where numerous cars and trucks are destroyed by train wheels rolled off a moving truck. 
The acting in this movie is quite good on the whole. McGregor and Johansson have good chemistry together and have the physical ability to do many of their own stunts. The evil leader of the institute is played by long time bad-guy Sean Bean ("National Treasure," "Goldeneye"), who 
turns in a respectable per­


formance -although the writing for his part has a far greater potential than is realized. 
'The Island" is different than any of Michael Bay's former films because it con­tains an intelligent, coher­ent storyline. The story is not without its problems, but it is one viewers can engage and has characters that are complex and interesting. The future portrayed here is unique without being too outlandish and provides much to look at onscreen. The movie also raises serious questions about the practieality and morality of cloning in an age when these concerns could soon become legitimate. While the film was poorly received in large part due to a bad marketing campaign, it is worth seeing -if not for the questions it raises, then at least for the action. 


Although the filii?-is worthwhile and entertaining, "The Island" DVD itself is a big disappointment. For being such a big-budget film, the DVD includes only one fea­turette. Though it is an interesting look into some of the special effects done in the film, it is too brief-there should be many more featurettes and extras than provided. Additionally, the fact that the video transfer quality is average at best makes this DVD a disappointment. 
While the film itself is worthwhile, until a special edition loaded with special features is released, "The Island" DVD is only worth a rental.

TURIN, Italy -In a public relations move with Supersize irony, McDonald's rolled out its much-hyped "packaging with nutritional information" on Tuesday at -of all places -the Winter Games.

The "packaging with nutri­tional information program" is the burger chain's latest effort to add healthy-sounding sound bytes to its traditional menu fare. Beginning Tuesday in Turin, and later this month in the United States, food boxes and wrappers will carry icons and numbers (but no written words) showing calo­ries, protein, fat, carbs and salt content. 
The symbol for salt is three diagonal dots (to look like the top of a salt shaker), the sym­bol for protein is three blocks (the "building blocks" of ener­gy), and the symbol for fat is two horizontal lines with ver­tical bars (Think of a tape measure).

There also was more than one instance of salty irony in the media blitz. 
Turin's outskirts are home to the Slow Food movement, which formed 20 years ago when incensed Italians protested plans for opening the first franchise -at the base of Rome's legendary Spanish steps. 
But in a country where two­hour lunches are standard, as are long, late dinners with sumptuous courses and flow­ing wine, the Italians lost their battle. 
There are now 330 McDonald's franchises in Italy, 24 of them in the Piedmont area surrounding Turin, serving 600,000 meals per day.

TENNIS 

U.S. announces Davis Cup tea111 
Associated Press 

SAN DIEGO Andy Roddick is determined to help the United States win another Davis Cup, no matter how long it takes. 
"Davis Cup is definitely on the top of my list of priori­ties," Roddick said Tuesday, talking about the busy sched­ule he and other players have. 
The United States has won the Davis Cup 31 times, but not since 1995, so Roddick and the current crop of young players have yet to take it. 
"That's something that's a huge, huge goal for me per­sonally and for us as a team," he said. "It would be so tough not having accomplished that goal, then to sit out and not commit to it. 
"I've told the captain [Patrick McEnroe] that I'm committed to this cause as long as he wants me here." 
Roddick and James Blake will play singles, and twins Bob and Mike Bryan doubles in Davis Cup first-round matches against Romania that open here on Friday. 
Last year, the U.S. team of Roddick, Andre Agassi and the Bryan brothers lost to eventual champion Croatia in the opening round. 
Although the United States is heavily favored against Romanian singles players Victor Hanescu and Andrei Pavel and the doubles team of Razvan Sabau and Horia Tecau, McEnroe is cautious heading into the best-of-five matches. 
"Romania has a couple of very tough players, good guys that are veterans," he said. "Pavel especially has played a lot of good Davis Cup. Hanescu has had a very good last year, especially. He's a tough player. We expect a tough match. 

"We're certainly looking to be primed and ready to go." 
Only 23, Roddick is a Davis Cup veteran with a 17-6 record since making his first appearance for the United States in 2001. 
He smiled and recalled con­tributing to the American team even earlier, as a 10­year-old fan at the final in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1992. 
"It's what some people con­sider the best single Davis Cup team ever with [Jim] Courier, Agassi; [Pete] Sampras was on the team, but he wasn't good enough to play singles. That's how good 
this team was. Some brother 
of yours  was  there, too,"  
Hoddick  said, nodding  to  
McEnroe.  
John  McEnroe  and  

Sampras played on the win­ning doubles team as the United States downed Switzerland 3-1. 
"One of the cool things I remember is the Swiss peo­ple brought their big cow­bells," Roddick said. 
He and one of his brothers set out to counter the cow­bells. 
"We ended up finding these bike air horns. He was on one side of the stadium doing it, I was on the other," Roddick recalled, grinning. 
"I asked Jim Courier a cou­ple of years ago if he actually remembers it. He goes, 'That was you? Gosh, those things were annoying."'

EWING. N.J. -Wayne Gretzky's wife and about a half-dozen NIIL players placed bets -but not on hockey -with a nationwide sports gambling ring financed by Phonnix Coyotes assistant coach Hick Tocchet, authorities said Tuesday. 
Gretzky, hockey's greatest player, is in his first season eoaching the Coyotes and is a part-owner of the team. 
Actress-wife Janet Jones was among those implicat­ed, two law enforcement ofTicials told The A'isociated Press, spnaking on eondition of anonymity because no bettors have been publicly identified. 

Asked about her involve­ment, Gretzky laughed and said, "Oh really? I don't know. You'd have to ask her that." 
State police Col. Rick Fuentes said an investiga­tion into the New Jersey­based ring discovered the processing of more than 1,000 wagers, exceeding $1.7 million, on professional and collnge sports, mostly football and basketball. 
The developmenL<> came at a sensitive time for the NIIL, whieh is trying to win back fans after a season-long loekout and just days before many of iL<> best players will showcase their talnnt at the Turin Olympies. 
Tocchet was served with a eriminal complaint Monday and was expected to travel from his Arizona home to answer charges of promot­ing gambling, money laun­dering and conspiracy, Fuentes said. 
A criminal complaint informs Tocchet of authori­ties' intention to formally chargn him and the nned filr him to arrange to travel to New Jersey for formal eharging, or face arrest. 
"It's not a hoekey-rnlatt~d issue, it's a football thing. And at this time I can't eorn­ment any further," Tocchnt said after the Coyotes prac­tieed Tunsday. 
Gretzky said Tocdwt would be on the bnnch for Tuesday night's honw game against Chicago, and it would be "business as usual." 
"1\veryone in thn world is innocnnt until proven guilty," {;retzky said. "lin's a great guy and a good frinnd. lie's just going through a tough tirnn right now, obviously, and we've got to lnt it run iL'i eourse. It's a situation that's obviously a eoneern for thn organization at this point."

IN BRIEF Alexander reveals Super
Bowl injury 

KIHKLAND, Wash. -Turns out dropped passes, penalties and disput­ed officials' ealls weren't the only things going against the Seahawks in the Super Bowl. 
League MVP Shaun Alexander revealed Tuesday he sprained his right foot during the Seahawks' championship loss to Pittsburgh Sunday. 
"I didn't even know it happened, but it swellnd up," he said, hours before he and six teammates flew to llawaii to play in this weekend's Pro Bowl. 
Alexander said he will get treatment in Hawaii before deciding whether to play on the swollen foot. He got hurt while rushing 20 times for 95 yards in Seattle's 21-1 0 loss to the Steelers. 
The league rushing champion and single-season record holder for touch­downs said he considered the Pro Howl "an honor" he did not take light­ly. lie was selected for the game for the third eonsncutive season. 

America at risk of losing its 
Olympic influence 
TUHIN, Italy -Ameriea's dimin­ished influence in the international Olympic movement could be even further eroded this week. By Friday, the United States could be left with­out a single voice on the Olympics' most powerful body. 
Jim Easton and Anita DeFrantz are both running for seats on the policy­making executive board of the International Olympic Committee. Members say they run the risk of splitting the vote and both losing. 
Other U.S. interests will also be at stake at the three-day IOC general assembly opening Wednesday on the eve of' the Turin Games. Softball and baseball, voted out of the Olympics seven months ago, are hoping to win reinstatement for the 2012 London Games. Friday's IOC executive board elec­tions shape up as among the most significant and tightly contested in years. 
Steeler fans celebrate fifth 
Super Bowl victory 
PITTSBUIH;IJ -Some fans waited 26 years for this Super Bowl cnlnbra­tory parade. Others were too young to remembnr the Pittsburgh Stnelnrs' last championship. Somn wernn't even born. 
It didn't matter Tuesday as fans of all ages jammed a mile-long parade routn -I 0 or more people deep in many spots -to thank thn team for securing the long-sought firth Super Bowl win. 
Sixty-seven-year-old Evelyne Potts recalled being downtown for the last victory parade when her sons were both in elementary school. She said she wasn't going to miss this onn. 
"I wanted to be part of history," she said. 
"We just love 'em, that's all," Potts said. 
And the players loved the fans baek. Safety Troy Polamalu twiee dove from atop a piekup truck into the cheering crowd.

MLB 
Giambi returns to public's embrace 
Former 'pariah' now active with charities 
Associated Press NEW YORK -Jason Giambi didn't have to apologize for this. Nearly a year to the day after he fidgeted through a news conference in which he all-but­admitted using steroids, the New York Yankees first base­man was celebrated for his charity. No longer a pariah, he beamed with pride as he spoke Tuesday in a hospital auditori­um along with former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman and country singer Garth Brooks about a new play­room facility they helped fund for sick children. "It's been a lot of hard work and a lot of grinding it out," said Giambi, who overcame injury and illness to become the 2005 AL Comeback Player of the Year. Last Feb. 10, he fended off questions as his agent sat by his side. This time, his mother, father and wife were in the audience at Mount Sinai Medical Center, listening to praise for his good deeds. "Every New Yorker, they love to see somebody face adversity and still stand tall and not fall by the wayside," Giambi said afterward. "They Like to see you 
man up and you take your beat­ing, but you just keep going and ticking and keep working hard. 
And they love those stories. It's a tough town here, it really is, and a lot of players fall by the wayside out here." 
One year after winning the AL MVP award with Oakland in 2000, he was given a $120 mil­lion, seven-year contract by the Yankees. He overcame a slow start in 2002 to post big num­bers, but then a knee injury caused him to slump in the sec­ond half of 2003, and a parasite and a benign tumor felled him in 2004, when he hit just .208 with 12 homers and 40 RBis. 
After spending much of the offseason regaining strength, he worked for many months with hitting coach Don Mattingly to find his lost swing and was booed by Yankee Stadium fans -unhappy he hit just five home runs during the first three months and left many runners on base. His stroke finally returned in July, and he wound up batting .271 with 32 homers and 87 HBis. 
He says he spent much of this offseason preparing for 2006. 
Spring training starts next week, with Yankees position players due to begin workouts on Feb. 22. 
"I feel great. I'm ready to go," Giambi said. "Last year, before the season started, I missed a couple of months just trying to get healthy, so it's been exciting to start from Day 1 like I've normally done, training and working out." 
He said his weight is about 235-240 pounds, and he looked a lot meatier Tuesday than he did a year earlier. Giambi says he hasn't felt this good since 2002. 
"He's telling me all the work he's doing. Hopefully, that's the case," Yankees manager Joe Torre said at another function later in the day. 
When Giambi reported to Tampa, Fla., last year, he immediately went out to sign autographs for fans, trying to repair his relationship with them. In the end, he made peace with them by becoming productive again at the plate. 
"I think it will be a lot easier," Torre said. "At this time last year, we were having a press conference at Yankee Stadium that was certainly uncomfort­able to sit in, and I know it had to be 10 times more uncomfort­able for him. With that stuff all behind him and just baseball ahead, and the second half of the year Last year, I think it will be a more enjoyable spring for him." 
Giambi was happy to talk about baseball matters: how he helped successfully recruit Johnny Damon to join the Yankees, and his unsuccessful talks with Nomar Garciaparra. Giambi thinks Damon will help Loosen up a clubhouse that often seems stiff, at Least during the time outsiders are allowed in. 
He revealed that Torre allowed him to pump up the tunes last season -loud music had largely been absent in the Yankees' clubhouse in recent years. 
"That was a big step in the right direction," Giambi said. "Joe was like, finally, 'Oh, fine, go ahead, play the music. I don't care.' Donnie would tell me to turn it on every day, and Jete." 
The Yankees' clubhouse often is empty in the hours before games, with captain Derek Jeter often the only regular player in front of his locker dur­ing times reporters are given access.

SUPER BOWL XL 
Controversy still surrounds gatne 
Associated Press 

The NFL defended the officiat­ing in the Super Bowl, and Joe Montana defended himself. 
Two days after the Steelers beat the Seahawks 21-10 in the NFL title game, the league said Tuesday that the game was "properly officiated." 
"Including, as in most NFL games, some tight plays that produced disagreement about the calls made by the officials," NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in a statement. 
Meanwhile, three-time Super Bowl MVP Montana denied reports he had asked for $100,000 to appear with other past MVPs at pre-game cere­monies. He left Detroit on Friday, and returned home to attend his sons' weekend bas­ketball games. 
"I had told them both Lsons] that I'd be there for their games and that we'd watch the Super Bowl together," Montana said in an interview with ESPN. Later, Montana added, "The Super Bowl is important to a lot of people but, to me, it was more important that I was home with my boys." 
Two-time MVP Terry Bradshaw and Miami's Jake Scott were the only other MVP's who didn't attend. Bradshaw reportedly wanted to be with his family, and Scott was traveling in Australia. 
The officiating, though, has been a the major topic of discus­sion since Sunday night. Hight after the game, Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren suggested that a first-quarter offensive interfer­ence call on the Seahawks' Darrell Jackson, negating what would have been the game's first touchdown, probably should have been "a no call." 

Holmgren, a former chairman of the NFCs rule-making compe­tition committee, fueled the debate Monday during a rally for the Seahawks at Qwest Field when he said, "We knew it was going to be tough going up against the Pittsburgh Steelers. I didn't know we were going to have to play the guys in the striped shirts as well." 
The questionable calls: 
+ 
Heplays on the offensive interference call showed that Jackson's arms made contact with Pittsburgh's Chris Hope and that they separated after­ward. Under the rules, pass interference took place but sometimes the call isn't made. 

+ 
The first TD of the game scored on a third-down rollout by Steelers quarterback Ben Hoethlisberger late in the first half. Hoethlisberger appeared to come down short of the goal line, but it was unclear on replay whether he had gotten the ball to the line before going down. Referee Bill Leavy upheld 



the call because there was not enough incontrovertible evi­dence to overturn it. 
+ 
Holding call on Sean Locklear in the fourth: Locklear's penalty erased an 18-yard completion from Matt Hasselbeck to Jerramy Stevens to the Pittsburgh 1 that would have put the Seahawks in position to go ahead 17-14 with around 12 minutes Left. It was a close call that was difficult to see on replay.

+ 
One call that clearly appeared erroneous came after that penalty, when Hasselbeck threw an interception to Pittsburgh's Ike Taylor, then made the tackle but was ealled for a block below the waist, giv­ing the Steelers an extra 15 yards. They scored soon after­ward on a pass from Antwaan Randle El to Hines Ward. Heplays showed Hasselbeck never made contact with the player he was supposed to have hit illegally, instead going straight to Taylor to make the tackle.

OT 
continued from 24 
Dating back to their 62-51 loss to then-No. 1 Tennessee on New Year's Eve, the Irish have trailed by double figures in nine of 12 games. 
"They're just so disappointing to watch sometimes," Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw said. "I mean, we just make so many mistakes, after mistake, after mistake on the same play, it's disheartening to watch sometimes." 
Twenty-three seconds later, sophomore guard Charel Allen hit a jumper and Notre Dame once again began clawing its way back from a big deficit. 
The Irish were able to erase the margin in little over nine minutes, tying the game at 52. 
They had been here before, too. 
Over the course of the past five weeks, Notre Dame has consis­tently found itself down big. But the Irish have fought back from those deficits surprisingly well. In that stretch, they cut the deficit below three points in five of the contests-winning two. 
Allen, who didn't even start the game, was the engineer of the comeback. The guard scored all 14 of her points after half­time, shooting 7-of-10 from the floor in the second half. 
"I thought [Allen] did a nice job when she came in," McGraw said. "She made a bunch of shots and that's what we needed to do." 
On Notre Dame's next posses­sion after tying the game, guard Lindsay Schrader walked to the free throw line with all the momentum squarely behind the Irish. They were surging and poised to take their first lead of the game. And they had put themselves in position to pull off the biggest upset win in program history. 
As Schrader missed both free throws, one could almost see the wind go out of Notre Dame's sails. 

Though an Allen jump shot briefly gave the Irish the lead at 58-56 inside the fmal two min­utes, Notre Dame did not resem­ble the team that had so quickly erased a 21-point Villanova lead. They managed only eight points in the final seven minutes, and allowed the Wildcats to score with backdoor-cut plays that had been so deadly in the first half. 
"You claw all the way back from down 20 and you can't get a rebound or make a free throw to seal the win," McGraw said. 'Tm -I'm just frustrated." 
In overtime, Notre Dame failed to recapture the magic it had for those nine minutes in the second half. The Irish struggled from the free throw line and let Villanova dictate the tempo and come away with the win. 
Tuesday night's game was the third Notre Dame contest that had gone to overtime this sea­son, tying a record set by the '95-96 team. In those games the Irish are a disappointing 1-2 ­the same mark as the team from a decade ago. 
Mter the game, senior guard and team captain Megan Duffy summarized the squad's resolve. 
"One thing about this team is we are not gonna give up when we're down," she said. 
Her next statement, however, has come to defme the team's recent reality. 
"It's really nothing unless you can pull it out in the end," she said. 
In the end, losing hurts. 
And losing in overtime after a monumental comeback hurts more. 
But the Irish know that by now. They've been there before.

earn the win. I should have called a timeout when I saw 
triple-double for the Wildcats with 10 rebounds and 10 assists to go along with her 14 points. 
With 2:08 remaining in over­time, Villanova was up by two but had just one second left on the shot clock. Suez-Karni drew a holding foul on Irish guard Megan Duffy, and the senior forward hit both free throws to give the Wildcats a four-point lead. 
"I got beat time and time again defensively in overtime," Duffy said. "If you can't stop them, you can't win." 
But Duffy, who sent the game to overtime with a driving lay­up from the left side with 11 seconds left in regulation, responded on offense, with a self-created three-pointer that cut Notre Dame's deficit to one with 36.8 seconds left. 
"I just tried to get a shot off," Duffy said. "I saw 
the play broke down and we didn't have anything." 
The Irish struggled for the first 24 minutes of the game to establish an offensive rhythm, and the Wildcats took full advantage of Notre Dame's mistakes. 
After several consecutive games with serious shooting woes, the Wildcats shot 50 per­cent in the first half and fin­ished 7 -of-15 from behind the three-point line for the game. 
"I have no idea what hap­pened," Villanova coach Harry Perretta said. "When the game starts, with this particular team I have absolutely no idea what's going to happen." 
Villanova led 32-20 at the half, and with 16:31 left in the game, Kate Dessart Mager made a lay-up to give the Wildcats a 43-22 lead.

tried to trap Villanova (13-8, 4-6) in the backcourt after the basket, but Wildcat point guard Betsy McManus got the ball away from the defenders and into the hands of Jenna Viani, who led all scorers with 22 points.

The Irish pushed the ball up the court, but they couldn't set up an open three-pointer for the tie. Duffy tried to draw contact on a desperation three with nine seconds left, but no foul was called, and Viani col­lected the rebound. 
good," he said. ''I'm panicking." 
Perretta's worries were pre­scient fears. From that point on, the Irish began to quickly chip away at the difference. 
Allen sparked the Notre Dame comeback, scoring 14 points on 7-of-1 0 shooting from the field in the second half. Allen scored eight points 
· in the five minutes after the Wildcats went up by 21, and Notre Dame had the lead down to 12. The Irish then held Villanova without a field goal for the next four-plus minutes, and a Lindsay Schrader free throw tied the game at 52 with 
7:14 remaining. 
But Notre Dame would lose its momentum seconds later, when Schrader missed a pair of free throws that would have given the Irish a two-point lead. Suez-Karni converted on a three-point play after she was fouled by Allen on a layup. 
Thanks to another five­minute stretch during which Villanova failed to make a field goal, the Irish managed to tie the game again and then take their first lead of the game with 2:08 remaining in regula­tion when Allen hit a leaner in the lane. 
But Viani made two layups in the final 70 seconds for the Wildcats to give them a two­point lead until Duffy's basket tied it. 
Notes: 
+ 
The last time an Irish opponent had a triple-double was Jan. 24, 1989 when DePaul's Diana Vines regis­tered 23 points, 11 rebounds and 12 steals. 

Suez-Karni's triple-double was the first by a Villanova player since 1987, when Shelly Pennefather achieved the feat for the Wildcats against Providence. Pennefather is now a cloistered nun in Virginia. 

+ 
Had the Irish won the game, it would have set the record for largest deficit over­come in program history and tied the second largest come­back in NCAA history. Notre Dame came back from a 47-31 halftime hole against Connecticut to win 90-7 5 in the 2001 Final Four, en route to its national championship. The NCAA record is 22 points, and the Irish would have tied the Big East mark set by Marquette last month, when the Golden Eagles came back from a 21-point deficit at West Virginia to win.

Irish lose in overtime after late comeback 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame erased a 21­point second-half deficit Tuesday but fell short in over­time against Villanova, losing 69-65 in front of 6,300 fans at the Joyce Center. 
"We lost the game at the end when we couldn't get a defen­sive rebound," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "We took a couple of quick shots and we just ... consistently beat our­selves by missing free throws. ... We just can't seem to make them when it counts."

Rutgers presents tough test 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
At the risk of sounding obvious, Notre Dame coach Mike Brey made his major goal for tonight's game against Rutgers absolutely clear. 
"Douby can't get 50 [points]." Brey said before Monday's practice. "We've got to slow that down."

Illini ace Irish with sweep 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
Despite a heroic effort, the Irish were unable to stop the bleeding against the Illini Tuesday, dropping their third straight match to fall to 2-4. 
No. 3 Illinois shut out No. 28 Notre Dame in a match that was decidedly one-sided. 
"Illinois is for real," Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said. ''They could win it all this year. They are the best team we've faced." 
The doubles point was the closest part of the match. Andrew Roth and Eric Langenkarilp took the match at No. 3 with an 8-3 victory.
