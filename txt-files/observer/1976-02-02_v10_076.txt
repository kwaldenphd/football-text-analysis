In this contest you will have an 8-shot revolver and must shoot the RFK picture three times, and in the process, hit five bystanders. The trick here is to hit the picture from behind at point-blank range, even though you are standing in front, three feet away. The second trick is to put three holes in the booth's ceiling and one in a doorframe. This may all seem impossible but the Los Angeles Police Department says it is very easy. One shot passes thru RFK and into the ceiling, bounces off a beam above and comes back down, and then bounces off the floor before striking the bystander. Simple. And don't worry about putting a hole in a doorframe. That was just a misprint. Once finished, you will have no recollection at all of what you did, not even under sodium pentathol. First prize will be a 5 by 8 glossy of Richard Nixon at his 1968 Inauguration. 
There may be some clown, probably a former congressman from New York, who will want to examine the booth's ceiling and doorframe to see if you really did all that. And he may be joined by a bystander and by Charles Manson's prosecutor. Don't worry. The Mardi Gras Committee will destroy the evidence. Then you will go on to Washington, D.C. to compete with finalists from all over the country in the July 4th National Gang Bang. Be sure to do well there. The CIA, FBI, Mafia, and Russian Secret Police will be recruiting. 
Afterwards, there will be a party at the White House celebrating 200 years of freedom.

on the hard snapping beat of the percus­sion, leaving us breathless so that we are helplessly caught up in "Whirlwind." With barely a pause the synthesizer reenters swirling around the muted sounds of the other members of the band. Then Ferry enters biting, snarling, asking; then demanding to be taken in by his metaphor for romantic rapture. Manzanera's sting­ing solo can only flail away harmlessly in the face of such a tempestuous wall of sound. 
"End of the Line," finds Ferry again casting himself in the loser's role. True to the mood of the piece, Ferry plays a honky-tonk riff on the piano backed by some melodramatic fiddling by Jobson. By the song's end we find him walking in the sun because he has "no love to keep him warm inside." 
The only real churning rock and roll number on Siren is "Both Ends Burning," with its impassioned vocal and stop-gap­ped, raving sax that seems to resent the intrusion of the strings. It is followed oddly enough by the most stylized piece on the album. "Nightingale" has Ferry asking the romantically symbolic bird to stay with him and help fuel his melancholy. A nice touch is added with the airs of the oboe placed on the periphery of the strings to bring a sense of wistfulness to the scene. 
Not all the songs on the album lean toward a romantic sensibility. "She Sells' is a-bouncy number that alternates disco funk with a sharp crisp beat and has the singer cooly disparaging his lover using newspaper jargon to suggest the lack of communication that exists between them. "Love is the Drug" opens the album with a thumping militaristic bass line backed by a quivering synthesizer. Ferry barks out the words amidst shrill horns that surge to a chorus undercut by discordant chords. It is a lament for lost innocence. Ferry's romantic world become's today sterile reality where love is only another high. It is fittingly ironic then, that by the time we get to "Just Another High," the last song on Siren, we have come full circle. Ferry is singing to all of us when he contradicts any notions we may have gotten from the opening cut. He confesses that he too has played the game but has disastrously fallen in love with someone with his former attitude. Ferry's jilted lover, "his heart aching, his spirit breaking," ever the Byronesque hero, is left to wander off in the sunset vainly searching for the love that has been denied him.

Blackcaucus to participate in mock convention 
by Maggie Brydges Staff Reporter 

A black political caucus has been organized to act in a lobbyist capacity for the mock political convention, according to conven· tion delegate Chuck Wilson. 
Wilson, one of the two black delegates to the mock political convention, organized the group in early December. The idea was inspired by a similar student caucus formed in the interest of women's rights. 
The group's membership has grown since its initiation, and Wilson hopes to procure more members by generating enthus­iasm for the group and its goals. 
The current participants in the caucus are planning to act as spokesmen for their views and are also canvassing the campus to find out the views and ideas of other students. Wilson stated that one of his objectives was to try to institute these new ideas into the group's platform. 
The goals of the caucus are greater equality for blacks in areas of labor relations and standards, national economic policy, busing, housing ·and health care. These objectives were arrived at by unanimous consent at the caucus' first meeting. 
According to Wilson the candi­dates that come closest to support­ing the views of the political caucus include Fred Harris, Sgt. Shriver, and Jimmy Carter. 
Due to the caucus' late forma­tion, Wilson feels that the group won't achieve its full potency until the mock election. At that time, he 
Astronomer predicts that asteroid may strike earth 
CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) · Like a dolphin playfully leading a ship to sea, an asteroid more than a mile wide skips back and forth across the earth's path. Like a shark, someday it probably will take a 20-mile bite out of the earth's side. 
There is a 75 per cent chance the asteroid, tentatively called "Fast moving Object Helin" for its discoverer, astronomer Eleanor Helin, will smash into the earth within 24 million years, creating a crater some 20 miles wide, Mrs. Helin said in an interview Satur­day. 
''It is the closest thing to the earth other than the moon in the solar system," said the 40-year-old Camarillo astronomer who discov­ered the asteroid with an 18-inch telescope at Mt. Palomar, near San Diego, on Jan. 7. 
Mrs. Helin, affiliated with the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said the asteroid is in an orbit around the sun which is almost identical to the earth's. 
"It spirals back and forth across our orbit," she said. "It loops around us once a year, each time crossing our path." She said its year is 348 days, compared with the 365 days it takes the earth to orbit the sun.

THE PARTY'S OVER. 

All too often, when the party ends, the trouble begins. 
People who shouldn't be doing anything more active than going to sleep are driving a car. Speeding and weaving their way to death. 
Before any of your friends drive home from your party, make sure they aren't drunk. 
Don't be fooled because they drank only beer or wine. Beer and wine can be just as intoxicating as mixed drinks. 
And don't kid yourself because they may have had some black coffee. Black coffee can't sober them up well enough to drive. 
If someone gets too drunk to drive, drive him yourself. Or call a cab. Or offer to let him sleep over. 

Maybe your friend won't be feeling so good on the morning after, but you're going to feel terrific.

Student-Railpass covers 100,000 miles of track in thirteen European countries, all the way from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. And $195 buys you unlimited Second Class rail travel for two whole months. On a student's budget that's some deal. In fact, the only thing cheaper is thumbing it or wearing down your heels. Besides that, the trains are fast (some zip along at 100 mph), clean, comfortable and fun. You can go and come whenever you like. And

Hockey team splits with Colorado 

by Tom Krucek 

Colorado College's goaltender Eddie Mio turned away a total of 91 shots in two days, while the:>fficials whistled a total of 80 minutes in penalties as Notre Dame and Colorado College split in weekend action at the ACC. The Tigers won Friday night S-4, while the Irish won Saturday 3-1. 
Friday night's game was marred by 22 penalties, ll on both squads. Looking at those totals, it would appear that the game was a free-for -all, which it wasn't. The two officials, Tom Yurkovich and Stan DuBois, trying to keep the game in hand, called the game so tight that neither team could make a move without being sent off the ice. 
"The referee's had a great bearing on the game." Coach Charles(Lefty) Smith observed af­ter the first encounter. "They destroyed both team's momentum on several occasions and just called the game too tight." 
The game began the way the series was to proceed, as just 57 seconds into the game, Notre Dame's Brian Walsh was chased for tripping. CC wasquick to take advantage of this opportunity, as less than a minute after the penalty was asessed, Wayne Holmes won a face off, got the puck back to Curt Christofferson at the point, who found Larry Soltvedt open at the right point and beat goalie Lenny Moher with a slap shot just inside the left post. 
The Irish then tied the score three minutes later, benefitting from a Tiger penalty. The Irish kept good pressure on Mio during the time that John Stampohas was resting for a high-sticking, but could manage just one shot on goal. 
Then, seconds after the penalty was over, Kevin Nugent coming down on the left side wound up and rifled a rocket that Mio rejected, but lost control of the rebound which Don Fairholm picked up and put into the net over the goalkeep­er's right shoulder. 
Notre Dame then jumped in front at the 7:25 mark. oft) e first period. as Jack IBrownschidle picked up his sixth goal of the season, beating Mio on a slap shot from the left point that somehow made it through a crowd of players that screened the All-American goalie. Assisting were Paul Clarke and Alex Pirus.

The Irish then closed the first period scoring at 9:48 on a power play, as Notre Dame had a two man advantage with Greg Smith and Mike Haedrick both off the ice. Clarke got credit for the score on assists from Clark Hamilton and Walsh, beating Mio on a rifle from the top of the left circle. 
Lynn Olson narrowed the Irish lead to a single goa\47 seconds into the second period on a beautiful pass from Mike Straub. But Notre Dame came right back while short­handed as Don Fairholm picked the puck off Smith's stick, and came in alone on Mio, faking once and putting the shot over his right shoulder. But this was to be the last score for the Irish and the difference was Mio. The senior goaltender rejected 24 shots in the final period while Tony Palazzari scored in the second period with Dave Hanson and Rick Pracht scoring in the final frame to hand the Irish their tenth loss in WCHA action. 
Saturday night, the referee's continued theilwhistlin_g ways, this time for 18 infractions. Notre Dame was caught 8 times and the Tigers 
10. The game turned into a battle of goaltenders with John Peterson making several key saves including a breakaway stop while Mio turned his second excellent performance, turning back 43 shots. 
The Irish jumped in front 2-0 on an unassisted first period goal by Don Fairholm and Walsh. The action was somewhat non-spirited in the period, with the majority of the action coming at the 12:41 mark of the frame when Dave Delich and Pracht were chased off for elbow ing and charging respectively, and took on a fan in a one round fight in back of the penalty box. 
The second period was likewise unspirited, with Colorado coming within a lo'(oal at 6:19, Smith scoring

**********' 

warm-ups saw their whole offense right there. The Terps work an attack similar to Indiana's "motion" offense, and their weave is it's core. They set up a box, with two guards and two forwards in each corner of the half-court. The third guard then begins to weave with the two other guards near the mid-court line, until one of them will accelerate around his defender to the foul circle where the process begins again with that guard and the two forwards. Finally one will accelerate again to the middle of the foul lane and up to the hoop, but they always go to the middle. The Terps rarely shot outside, and won't unless a team goes into a zone against them, in which case they unleash their .564 shooting percentage. Their offense works because they're so quick that they can beat their men on the weave and go around them. 
**********

Best human sacrifice of the game goes to James Tillman whose defense on Adrian Dantley consisted mainly of how long he could go without fouling out. It took him but nine minutes in the second half to pick up the four fouls that put him out of the game at the 8:24 mark, but he had neutralized A.D., who failed to score even after Tillman had departed. The problem is that Digger has sensibly set up the offense not to look solely for Dantley, but the big forward's dominance of the first half had left the rest of the Irish cold. Notre Dame made only ten of their 31 shots in the second half, amassing only 23 points in the period. The Irish were missing the balanced scoring attack that has propelled them to their impressive recent victories.  til *
