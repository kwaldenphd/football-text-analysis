French try to keep life normal despite beefing up security 
Associated Press 
PARIS -Tile French, keeping a wary vigil for more terrorist bombs in tlleir midst, are trying to juggle normal routines with new security steps that some say play into tile bombers' !lands. 
Police switchboards buzz witll calls. 
One caller said a pile of leaves outside City Hall could disguise a bomb. Tile leaves were swiftly removed. Tile Stock Exchange and two Metro stations were hastily evacuated for wllat turned out to be false alarms. 
In tile northern city of Caen, a young woman dumped a parcel on a post office counter and hurried away. Police evacuated tile building, and the bomb squad raced up. Tiley found let­ters, stamped for mailing. 
In the past eight days, . four bombings llave killed a total of tllree people and injured more tllan I 00. Tile most recent bom­bing, on Monday, was inside tile central police station. 
Even before Monday's bom­bing, new anti-terrorist measures were implemented, in­cluding visa requirements for visitors from all but the I 2 European Common Market countries and Switzerland. 
The French, who tend not to suffer officialdom lightly, quietly submitted to opening bags and even body searches at depart· ment stores, theaters, restau­rants and other public places.

"I am delighted tile police arc on tile job," an elderly woman remarked, interviewed on televi­sion along the Cllamps-Elysees. "There are not enough searches for my taste." 
Some commentators warned that tile security measures or­dered by Premier Jacques Chirac played into terrorists' hands, creating a mood of fear and doubt. 
Some worried that using the armed forces to supplement gendarmes and border police es­tablished a worrisome precedent for a democracy. Others said the imposition of visas would scare off tourists. 
The Metro, Paris' underground railroad, is as crowded as usual, but passengers glance under their seats and eye fellow riders with some suspicion. Many, fearing a bomb in the subway, use the buses. 
Responsibility for the bom­bings has been claimed by Middle Eastern terrorists who have issued almost daily threats to raise the stakes until the gov­ernment releases Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, reputed leader of a group called the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions.

Hostages

Lebanon. Islamic Jihad says it holds three American hostages and killed a fourth. It is uncertain who carried out the kidnappings last week of two other Americans. 
Islamic Jihad's latest com­munique and the handwritten letter were in a packet left out­side a Western news agency in Moslem .west Beirut. The packet also contained a Polaroid photo­graph of Jacobsen in pajamas, almost identical to one of him released with an Islamic Jihad statement in Beirut last week. 
"Why was Reagan interested minute by minute with spy jour­nalist Daneloff but he is not in­terested one minute in our story?" asked the letter said to have been handwritten by Jacob­sen. Daniloff's name was mis­spelled. 
In a separate, typewritten, Arabic-language statement Is­lamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, said the Reagan administration had made "concessions in the

have to say 'no'," said Kretz. 
"Even when we get the encour­agement from our rectors, there is so much gray area left open to interpretation by officials that we still get shut down," said St. Edward's Hall president Andrew Barlow. 
Director of Student Activities Joni Neal decided to cancel the planned tailgaters of the classes of 87 and 89 because the events would take place in an atmo­sphere conducive to drinking. said HPC members. 
The question was raised why these events were cancelled while the tailgater sponsored by Grace Hall was not. 
In other HPC news, the council is preparing a proposal to make student government a per­manent resident of the Lafor­tune Student Center. In the new Lafortune occupancy contract student organizations are refered to as "tenants" and must re-sign the contract annually. 
The HPC is also regulating the service of the "Buzz Bus" begin­ning this weekend. A brief dis­cussion clarified the policy that students will be picked up at 8 off-campus locations but will not be permitted to get off at bar stops.

The fire was put out he said, adding:"We don't know why they (the missing miners) didn't come up." They may have been over­come by the fumes "or were trapped some way," he said. 
Hill said all of the miners known to have died were in the vicinity of the fire, but he did not know if they were engaged in the welding operation or what was being welded. He said the fire broke out on the 15th level of the No. 2 shaft. 
Eight rescue teams went un­derground, Hill said. 
"The fumes spread through the working areas of the No. 2 shaft," Hill said, and he believed the fatal gases were carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. 
South Africa's mines depend on black miners who are re­garded as migrant workers. Fac­tional fighting at the all-maiP. hostels in which the workers live claimed more than I00 lives in the first six months of the year.

Daniloff case which provoked many question marks in the hostages' minds." 
The three captives were "com­paring what the (U.S.) govern­ment did in the 'Daniloff' case with what it is doing for them," the statement said. 
"Are not we Americans?" asked the letter which bore Jacobsen's name. 
Islamic Jil,ad, which espouses the Shiite fundamentalism of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, has demanded that 17 comrades jailed in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in 1983 be freed in return for the hostages. Kuwait refuses. 
The latest Islamic Jihad state­ment called on Americans to pressure the Reagan administra­tion into altering its stand of refusing negotiations, and so "put a happy ending to the (ordeal of the) hostages." 
Daniloff, Moscow correspon­dent ofU.S. News & World Report magazine, was released in cus­tody of the U.S. embassy on Friday after 13 days in prison.

ND falls to Illinois and Miami in weekend women's tennis play 
By SHEILA HOROX 
Sports Writer 
Amidst the activities of the football weekend, the Notre Dame women's tennis team was preoccupied with the task of hosting Illinois and Miami (Ohio) to open its 1986 fall season. 
The Irish, however, were upended by both teams, and the loss to Illinois was particularly difficult since every year it seems Illinois is able to squeak by Notre Dame in the close matches. This year proved to be no different as the nemising lllini beat the Irish, 5-3. 
All three Notre Dame victories came in singles play. Michelle Dasso, the No. I singles player, defeated Stacey Knollef, 6-3, 6­
2. Alice Lohrer outlasted Carie Costigano 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, and co­captain Tammy Schmidt crushed Astrid Eichner 6-0, 6-2. 
Stephanie Tolstedt lost a tough three set match to Sandra Goern, 6-3, I -6, 3-6. Natalie Illig lost to Susie Stout 1-6, 1-6 and Resa Kelly was defeated by Loren Smolensky 1-6, 2-6. 
Tied 3-3 after the singles matches, the Irish hopes of a vic­tory inevitably rested on the out­come of the doubles matches, where Notre Dame must send out three new doubles teams onto the court. 
The team of lllig-Lohrer were beaten by Eichner-Knollef 2-6, 2­6, and Schmidt-Sullivan, playing at the No.3 doubles position, lost to Stout-Costigano 1-6, 5-7. The top team of Dasso-Tolstedt, after splitting the first two sets with Daw-Goern. did not play a decid­ing set because Illinois had already clinched the meet. 
On Saturday, the Irish squared off against Miami. probably the strongest opposition on their schedule. Miami won eight of nine matches. Sophomore Illig registered the lone Irish win by defeating Jane Filus 3-6, 6-2, 6­
3. The match boosted Illig's con­fidence after a disappointing loss Friday to Illinois' Stout. 
"Against Illinois," she said, "I wasn't into the match, I didn't have any concentration. The loss was mental so I decided to get my act together against Miami." 
To counter the rining shots of Filus, Illig was instructed to be patient. try and slow the pace of the match, and not attempt to out-gun her opponent. The ad­vice netted Illig a three-set win. 
Dasso and Tolstedt played well in close matches that ended in defeat. Dasso's 7-5, 6-4 loss could easily have gone her way, as could Tolstedt's 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 deafeat to Jill Joslin.

The Notre Dame volleyball team lost its match against 19th-ranked Western Mic-
Irish lose to Western Michigan despite impressive performance 
higan last night. Brian O'Gara has all the details in his story below. 
By BRIAN O'GARA 
Sports writer 
The Notre Dame volleyball team dropped a dramatic, hard­fought match last night in the ACC Pit to a powerful, 19th­ranked Western Michigan squad, but the young team came away with a wealth of experience. 
"I am very pleased with our play," said Coach Art Lambert "but disappointed that we didn't win. We did some really good things out there, but made some critical errors as well. These will go away in time -we're a young team." 
The evening's first game fea­tured a dramatic see-saw battle between the Irish and the Broncos. The two teams traded the lead four times and were tied at 9, I 0 and 13. The Broncos, playing with confidence and finesse at the net pulled away at the end to take the first game, 15-13. 
The two teams began game two in the same fashion, match­ing point for point and kill for kill. The Irish were gaining con­fidence with every point eager for an upset. But a series ofcom­munication breakdowns flus­tered the Irish, and Western Mic­higan quickly pulled away, 
Sooners still 1st 

running off six unanswered 
points and taking the second 
game, 15-7. 

With their backs to the wall, 
the Irish came out for game three 
to play perhaps their best game 
of the night. Three Western Mic­
higan mishaps and the powerful 
kills of sophomore Mary Kay Wal­
ler put the Irish on top for a quick 
6-1 lead. The Broncos showed 
their poise to stage a comeback 
and tie the game, 9-9, but the 
Irish dug down to run off their 
own streak of six unanswered 
points with well-orchestrated 
teamwork to win the third game 
15-9. 

This set the stage for the eve­
ning's final match, which had fhe crowd of386 on the edge of their seats. The teams battled to a 3-3 tie, but the Irish pulled ahead and reached a 9-6 lead on the splendid performance of fresh­man setter Taryn Collins. Collins had four quick sets to sop­homores Zanette Bennett and Mary Kay Waller as the Irish sought to pull even in games at two apiece. But the Irish put a few kills into the net and the Broncos took advantage, pulling to a 9-9 tie and quickly increas­ing their lead to 13-9. The young Irish would not break, however, and rallied behind Waller and 
Kathy Cunningham to a !3-!2 margin. In the end, despite their efforts, the Irish could not hold off Western Michigan and dropped the final game, 15-I 2. 
"We handled their multiple of­fense, which we rarely see, fairly well," said Lambert. "We're a young team. That last game we went with two freshmen, three sophomores and a junior. You don't get much younger than that." 
Sophomore Mary Kay Waller came up with one of her best performances in an Irish uniform and was an intimidating force at the net as she lead the teams with 16 kills, while freshman Kathy Cunningham added I 0. The team's other freshman, Col­lins, registered !3 sets and played a key role in games three and four. 
''I'm very pleased with Taryn," said Lambert "We moved her to setter and she performed very well." 
Next up for the improving Irish is a trip to the Bradley Tourna­ment this weekend. 
"We made ourselves felt tonight" concluded Coach Lam­bert. "We're getting better. Somebody down the line is going to pay." 

Irish take 20th spot in AP poll 
Associated Press 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. -A grin flashed across the face of Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz Tuesday when he learned his once-beleaguered Fighting Irish had earned a national ranking. 
But just as quickly, he turned off his smile and took the pose that most polls don't matter. 
"Only the last one," he said. "l just want to be better than Mic­higan State." 
Michigan State is both Notre Dame's next opponent and the team the Irish displaced for the No. 20 spot in the weekly Asso­ciated Press college poll. 
Notre Dame edged into the na­tional rankings after a strong performance in a 24-23 loss to No. 3 Michigan. It was the first time the lrisll appeared in the rankings since the second week of last year, when Gerry Faust was tile coach. 
Notre Dame team captain Mike Kovaleski. who had 17 tackles against Michigan, brushed off the poll, too, despite his team­mates' hunger for recognition after the trauma of Faust's final year stole most of the 1985 headlines. 

"For me, ratings after the first game and the preseason don't really mean anything because you've got I0 games to play," Kovaleski said. "It's not how you begin the season, it's how you end." 
While Notre Dame was crack­ing the Top Twenty, Oklahoma, the defending national cham­pion, was retaining the No. I spot, despite being idle last Sat­urday. But the Sooners' margin over No. 2 Miami, Fla. shrunk. 
The Sooners received 55 of a possible 59 first-place votes and I, 175 of a possible I, 180 points from a nationwide panel of sports writers and broadcasters. 
Miami. which raised its record to 3-0 with a 6 1-I I rout over Texas Tech last Saturday, col­
lected one first-place vote and 1,099 points. Last week's first­place votes also were 55-l, but the point differential was I, 175­1,050. 
Michigan remained a distant third with 1,000 points, and was followed by the same three teams as a week ago -Alabama with 992 points, Penn State with 938 and Nebraska with 924. 
Washington, a 40-7 winner 
over Ohio State, vaulted from I 7th to seventh and knocked the Buckeyes out of the rankings. Penn State, Nebraska and Wash­ington each received one first­place vote. 
Louisiana State, which beat last week's No. 7 team, Texas A&'M, 35-I 7, climbed from I4th to eighth with 747 points and dropped the Aggies to 16th. 
Baylor, a 38-7 winner over Louisiana Tech, soared from I 2th to ninth with 629 points. Auburn, idle last Saturday, slipped from ninth to Ioth with 615 points.

Spartans play host for first road game 
Isn't it gredt, this poll i.>us;ness? 
Tile Irish played their hearts out Saturday, but lost the heartbreaker. Still, Notre Dame moved into 20th place in the Associated Press poll. At this rate, the last few seasons would have ended with top-I 0 ran kings. 
The key, of course, is that the Irish looked very good in losing by one point to a highly-ranked team. 
Notre Dame's opponent, Michigan State, also lost a tough one at Arizona State. So do not expect them to offer their sympathy by laying down in East Lansing. 

Rick Rietbrock 
Irish Items 

Tile two teams are moving down the same road at this particular time, but their paths will veer away from each other as a result of Saturday's meeting. 
Michigan State is expecting this year to be a big one. They began the season ranked 20th, and are considered strong finishers in the race for the Big Ten title. 
They obviously do not want to enter the Big Ten season with a losing record, which a loss to the Irish would assure. 
The Spartans are no longer a member of the Big Ten's basement bunch. Head Coach George Perles has done an outstandingjob rebuilding the football program and the Spar­tan faithful are expecting bowl bids to shower them at season's end. 
But the focus on Spartan centers on Lorenzo White. He led the nation in rushing last year with I, 908 yards, including 123 yards against the Irish. 
Last week, Arizona State held him to just 6 I yards on 24 carries, and Foge Fazio has to be praying for a similar per­formance from his defense. 
The problem with keying on White is that senior quarterback Dave Yarema is back from an injury that hampered him last year and put up the best numbers of his career last week. 
Middle linebacker Shane Bullough leads a tough defensive unit that hopes to hold the Irish in check a little better than their friends froni Ann Arbor did. 
The Irish had little reason to expect much from this season except for the fact that Lou Holtz was here and Gerry Faust was not. That quickly changed with one good showing. Now the talk is once again on which major bowl we should elect to play in. Fans will be fans. 
But regardless of the overreaction, the Irish did give reason for delusions with their play in the opener. Steve Beuerlein had one of his best days with 2 I completions. His play also reflects the fine job of the offensive line since Beuerlein had a lot of time to get rid of the ball. 
There are several factors that the Irish will have to overcome in order to defeat Michigan State. 
First they must guard against a letdown. The hoopla sur­rounding the first game, aiming for that opener for nine months, Lou Holtz' first appearance on the sidelines and the quality of the opponent all contributed to the luster of the game. 
But it wasjust one game and their attention must be turned to Michigan State. Good teams can beat patsies without being in the game, but good teams cannot beat other good teams that way. Michigan State is a good team. 
Second, this is the first road game of the year. No screaming student body to greet them. No natural grass. And in case you forgot, the Irish could not capture a single victory on the road last season. That trend must be changed. 
Third, the Irish are winless against teams from the state of Michigan this year. That cannot continue. 
This is an interesting game for both teams. The winner can go on to have a very successful season. The loser will have a longer road ahead, despite being a good team, in all likelihood. 
Even if then~ is such a thing as a good 0-2 football team, the Irish do not want to see if they can be it. If they do lose it will be interesting to see how far they move up the polls.

Those who were sick of seeing Pinkett right, Pinkett left and Pinkett up the midole certainly had fun watching the Irish move the ball with a widely assorted package of plays. 
Using the !-formation as well as the single-back offense worked well for the Irish. But the show-stealer was the wi<>ll­bone, which had been anticipated since the arrival of Holtz. 
Steve Beuerlein looked very comfortable with the wishbone and made several nice last-second pitches that enabled the running backs to get around the corner. 
In the single-back offense, Mark Green moved outside to a receiver spot which he grew accustomed to last year to make several big gainers on screens. He showed, once a·gain, that he has good hands as well as having a productive day on the ground. 
The combination of these factors produced nine Notre Dame drives of 75, 66, 24, 66, 38, 65, 63 and 46 yards. The Irish were not forced to punt for the first time since the Air Force game of 1977.
