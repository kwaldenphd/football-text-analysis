Tragedy struck Saint Mary's during spring break when senior Kristi Morris was killed in a car crash on her way to Myrtle Beach, S. C. "She was fearless and young. She wasn't threatened by the things that could hurt her," her mother, Margie Wasoski told WNDU. "I begged her not to go that night, not to drive straight through." 
The accident occurred at 9:43 a.rn. on Saturday, March 12, near Clinton, 
S. C., according to Cpl. Mark Gosnell, a spokesman for the South Carolina Highway Patrol. 
Morris was driving to Myrtle Beach with a friend, Sara Williams. a junior at Saint Mary's. They decided to drive through the night on Friday to gain time in South Carolina. Morris appar­ently fell asleep at the wheel and careened into the guardrail on the side of the highway. She was declared dead at the scene, while Williams suf­fered a broken pelvis and other bro­ken bones, according to South Carolina police. 
Williams was taken to Spartanburg Regional Medical Center. She was released from the hospital on Monday. Williams was doing well and is

INSIDE COLUMN 
Popes and 



prophecy 
On the Ides of March (only coincidentally my birthday) last week, nearly 500 people were killed in a Waco-like conflagration in Uganda. Like some sort of Catholic Branch-Davidians. these eschatological radicals believed that the Virgin Mary had promised them that March 15 was the end of the world. And for them it was. 
Though it is easy to dis­tance oursPIVPS from this kind of radical action. most of us are still fascinatPd with prophecies regarding the Paronsia and the Eschaton. (For those of you who slept through Theo 100, that's "the Second Coming" aud "the end of time"). Aside from the Christ and the Antichrist. the most promi­nent ligure in most prophe­cies is that of tlw Pope. 
:½ost well known of arcane Christian prophets is Nostradamus. Buried in his esoteric and enig­matic quatrains can be found references to the last pope of all time. Nostradamus describes a man born as a Jew ... the first Jew to hold tlrn papal office in centuries. 1 IB will be known by the same name as the first pope. and he will reign at the same time that the third and linal antichrist will come to political power. The Cardinal Archbishop of Paris converted from Judaism at an early age and is thought by some to be papa­bile. Some ask, "Is this coincidence?" and "What happens ifhe is elected pope?" I guess we can only wait and watch. 
Less well known are the prophecies of St. Malachy. Attributed to the 12th century Irish bishop of Connor and Armagh, these prophecies consist of a list of notes on 112 popes, from his time to the end of the world. Questionable in their authenticity, the notes each describe some­thing of the pontiffs coat of arms, pontificate or personality. While some are as vague as the qua­trains of the better known Nostradamus, some descriptions, of even modern popes, are striking­ly clear. The real kicker? After Pope John Paul II, there are only two popes left. Though he does not actually specify that there will be no other popes between his last two, there have as yet been no gaps in his 800 year old list. The last bishop of Rome will be called Peter the Roman and will reign in a time of both unusual peace and unprecedented turmoil. 

Radical conservative Protestant leaders and televangelists have often pointed to the Apocalypse of John to identify the pope as the beast, identified by his blasphemous name. They point out that there have already been five popes named Sixtus, and the sixth of this name would be the harbinger of doom because of his name's similarity to the name of the beast: 666. 
v\'hether you take any of these seriously, or think they are nonsense, we arc all called to remember that no one shall know the day or the hour. Moreover, ifwe are caught unawares when the Christ comes again we will be left in the outer darkness, where there will be a wailing and a gnashing of teeth. 
Not a pleasant thought, is it?

Illinois freshman treated for meningitis 
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 
A University of Illinois student was treated and released auring spring break for a bacterial infec­tion that could have quickly led to meningitis. Brian Firfer, a freshman in engineering. was admitted to Carle Foundation Hospital March 10 with a 104­degree fever and rash. lie was diagnosed with a Type B meningococcal infection. The bacterial infec­tion can lead to meningitis -the inflammation of the lining of the brain and ~pinal cord -and meningococcemia, an infection that spreads throughout the body. The infection was controlled at the hospital because it was caught shortly after the symptoms appeared, said McKinley Health Center Medical Director Dr. David Lawrance. [f' the infec­tion is not caught in its early stages, it can lead to the loss of limbs or death. FirJ'er said he was treated with intravenous antibiotics and was released in good condition March 14. Firfer said people who had close contact with him were treated with antibiotic pills. Members of Firfer's fraternity and students in his dorm were also contacted by univr,rsity officials.

Former Indiana chancellor dies at 97 
BLOOMINGTON. Ind. 
Legendary former president and chancellor of Indiana University, Herman Wells. passed away Saturday night from pneumonia and heart failure at the age of 97. Wells. who had suffered from heart problems, died in his home at about 7:45 p.m. Wells, recently named IU's "Man of the Century," served as university president from 1938 to 1962 before becoming chancellor. Among his many accomplishments. Wells was instrumental in the desegregation of IU, a proponent of academic frne­dom and developing an overall vision for tlrn campus' architecture. He is also widely credited with improving the cultural atmosphere of the university, initiating the construction of the IL' Auditorium in 1941 and develop­ing the School of Music. The university experienced its greatest growth under the leadership of Wells, with the student body nearly tripling from 11,000 in 1938 to 31,000 in 1962. Ho also widened its scope to encompass the globe, adding study programs such as Ilrbrrw and Folklore. "Lt's remarkable that he brought all of that to the fore during a time wlwn American isolationism was pretty strong," said IU Vice President Kenneth Louis.

MADISON, Wis. 
Napstcr Inc., the controversial MP3 trading software company that allows usPrs to download popular songs over the Internet, has recently been banned from various universities nationwide. 
Although UW-Madison has not yd banned the software. the issue has not gone unnoticed by lJW staff. 
Senior technical managers at UW's Division of lnfol'mation Technology discussed the issue in a recent meet­ing and broug-hl it up to the 1rntwork staff a short while ago, said Brian Rust, marketing communications manager for DolT. 
"If we start noticing a problem with excess travel on tho network, we'll investigate and issue a recommenda­tion and a report to the administra­tion," he said. "At this point, we have no plan of taking action." 

Recently, numerous universities across the country have clashed with Napster.

People did appear to be what was most important to Kristi, at least according to 
her mission staterrrnnt, which she wrote it as part o/' the curriculum of the social work major. Her mission was "to respect and uphold the digni­ty of families, through chari­ty inspired by hope, for the benefit of the larger society."

While no petition can formally place Dole on the GOP ticket, organizers hope to generate a groundswell that convincP.s the presumptive Republican nomi­nee. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, to pick the former Cabinet secre­tary and ex-American Red Cross president as his running mate.

Sweatshop meeting held today 
ByTIM LOGAN 
News 'X-'rirer 
On college campuses nation­wide, students have been demanding their universities take a tougher stand against labor abuses in apparel man­ufacturing. 
In recent months, those­demands have focused on the groups that have formed to combat sweatshop labor. Specifically, activisls have asked universities to join the fledgling Workers Rights Consortium (WRCl, an alliance of non-profit, pro­worker groups. instead of the year-old Fair Labor Association (FLA), which has both activists and corpora­tions on its board. 
Several major colleges and universities have agreed to join the WHC, and at Notre­Dame, anti-sweatshop activists will ask University president Father Edward Malloy to follow suit today at an open meeting. 
The Progressive Student Alliance has presented a March 27 deadline for Notre Dame to join the WRC, and will discuss the move with Malloy in the public meeting, at 5:30 in 10 l DeBartolo. University counsel Carol Kaesebier and William Hoye, chair of the Task Force on Anti-Sweatshop Initiatives will also attend, 
The organizers are opti­mistic that the meeting 1,vill be a success. 


schoo1 ·· ur 
·Rob Kellv int 

"We hope we're going to be able to present our case for the living wage, the FLA and joining the WRC and have a discussion around that," said Aaron Kreider of the PSA, which requested the meeting. 
Hoye, who has led the Task Force since its im:eption in August, and whom :vtalloy asked to attend, said that he was anticipating a good dis­cussion. 
"Any time you have a chance to sit down and talk with people who are con­cerned about this issue, it's a good thing," he said. 
The issue that is likely to dominate discussion is tho possibility of Notn:i Dame join­ing the WRC. Eighteen schools have joined the consortium, including Indiana University and the Universities of Michigan and Wisconsin. Many of these institutions have joined after large-scale student activism on their cam­puses. 
The WRC differs from the FLA, of which Notre Dame and more than 120 other schools are members, because it consists largely of non-profit organizations. The FLA board is divided ev1rnly between workers rights organizations and corporations that manu­facture apparel. with one seat for a university representa­tive. Critics say this heavy cor­porate presence weakens the FLA's ability to affect change. 
"It's like the fox guarding the chicken coop," Kreider said. "Whereas the WRC is based largely on [non-govern­mental organizations], and I think they would hold corpo­rations to a higher standard, and they do." 
The Task Force is studying WRC membership, according to Hoye, and has requested information on the group's structure, governance and monitoring systrm. But they have not yet received that information. he said. and thus will likely not make a recom­mendation before the PSA's deadline, which arrives Monday. 
The deadline comes less than two weeks before the WRC's founding conference on April 7. Activists note that the University will be able to play a greater role in shaping the consortium if it is a mem­ber at that meeting. Hoye said he had hoped to send a stu­dent member of the Task Force to the meeting, in order to gather information about the WRC. 
If Notre Dame joins the group. the University must turn over one percent of its licensing revenue, Hoye said, and the Task Force wants to make sure that membership will complement the University's other anti-sweat­shop initiatives before signing on. 
The Faculty Senate asked the University on March 7 to join the WRC, and Kreider said the PSA would circulate a petition and solicit endorse­ments from campus groups in support of the move.

The Texas governor's latest spending report shows he began \ilarch with just $7.5 million -a tenth of the $73.9 million war chest he amassed while vanquishing a tougher­than-expected challengo rrom John McCain for the Hepublican pn')sidential nOini­nation.

A judge has given Owens' sister temporary custody of tlrn couple's 6-and 8-year-old sons and 5-year-old daughter. A custody hearing is sched­uled for Tuesday.

Winfrey's lawyer said his client was unjustly being blamnd. "It's clrmr thP govern­ment's interested in scape­goats," William Swore said.

found two part-time jobs at a

Mount Morris Township home 
just north of Flint. 
The commute required tak­ing two buses each way. On som<' days, she left home at 
8:30 a.rr1. -not returning until 11 p.m, During those days, family members and friends watched the children while she was gone, she said. 
Then, eight clays bPfore the school shooting, she was evict­ed for falling behind on the rent. Owens said she couldn't find anothor affordable place, so she sent her sons to her brother's house and her daughter to lrnr sister's, She wouldn't say where she stayed herself. 
"My brother is really responsible. Ile made sure they ate, he made sure they had clean clotlrns to go to school, he made sure they took baths and he walked tliem to school ovPry day," she said. 
Allegations of guns and drugs in the house are news to her, she said.

you this snippet of that genteel gentle-men's domain ­otherwise, look for it only in the mem­ories of plaid-wearing, t\merican Express Platinum Card-waving alum­nus, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a civilization gone with the wind... 
Friday last, Matt Harrigan, of 724 Crace Hall, hosted a delightful soiree featuring loud obnoxious music and large quantities of cheap beer. The singular Mr. Harrigan, whose hobbies, according to his <logbook entry, are "music and sports," co-hosted the event with his roommate, fellow fresh­man Mike Warrnsby. Exclusively invit­ed to the intimate gathering were a bunch of guys from Warmsby's 20th Century American Literature class and the entire north wing of Regina Hall. 
Preparations for the evening began as early as 4 p.m. on he day of the soiree, when Harrigan took stock of his posh bachelor digs (enhanced this semester by a fresh coat of beige paint, liberally applied over the sum­mer holiday by the renowned design firm University of Notre Dame Building Maintenance.) lie took a daring rcdec­orative plunge, concerned that the room did not present exactly the wel­coming atmosphere he desired ("Oh, *&%#, it smells like%$@ in here, Warmsby!" were his precise words, this reporter has learned) An open, airy effect was achieved by removing the four sweatshirts, two pairs of cot­ton briefs, and 18 Papa John's boxes that formerly adorned the floor of 724 Grace Halt and cramming them into the nearest available closet. A 10­minute search was made of the imme­diate section for a can of air freshener; as their most resourceful comrades, Craig "Mad Dog" Swope and Tom "Epworth" Epworth were not receiving callers at the time, having repaired to a small gathering down the hall to partakP. of a rousing round of' Rebel Assault II, the gallant hosts made a search of the corridor's janitorial sup­ply pantry and saved the day with sev­eral refreshing squirts of Lemon-Fresh Pledge directed in the general vicinity of their closet. 

A daring avant-garde decorative theme was chosen for the festivities. Harrigan and Warmsby installed black-tight bulbs and a magenta lava lamp. purchased the previous after­noon at the University Park Mall branch of SpEmcer's Gifts. These addi­tions lent an enchanting accent to the gentlemen's line furnishings, a magnif­icent 1978-circa orange and brown nappy couch with several unidentilied stains on the left arm, and a chi-chi minimalist table fashioned from an ironing board balanced across two plastic crates. 
The first ladies to arrive were glam­orously whiskt~d from Regina Hall to Modern Quad via a splendidly orange Transpo shuttle bus. Among the early guests wern Amy Townsend, fetching in a completely original Eddie Bauer mock turtleneck. Her roommate, Lisa Whittier, opted for an earthier look, which insisted ofjeans and at-shirt whimsically emblazoned, "TIIE ONLY 
4.0 I EARNED AT NOTHE DAME WAS MY BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL." Accompanying them was a member of their biology lab group, Grace llallows. 
no one remembers for certain what she was wearing, although Townsend feels certain that The Gap was some­how involved. 
As the fire safety capacity of 724 Grace llall was exceeded by approxi­mately 97 people, the temperature hovered around a delightful 128 degrees Fahrenheit. An excellent vin­tage of Natural Light was served. along with a delicately mixed libation consisting of Watermelon Schnapps and lime grnen Jell-0. 
"/\ shockingly bold taste, with a mar­velous, plummy bouquet," evaluated a party-goer who gained entry to the sparkling assembly by assuring the student standing guard at the door that Im kind of knows Mike from the Freshman 0. "Beats the crap out of tlrn Meister Brew the guys upstairs have." 
"You can't even taste tlrn alcohol! It's like I haven't been drinking at all!" loudly added Whittier, who then asked the live people nearest to her if they thought it was really hot in lrnre, too. 
The guests were serenaded by, among other notables, Dave Matthews and his band. Donna Summers, D.J. Jazzy Joff and the Fresh Prince, and Dexy's Midnight Runners. t\ttempts to move about in time to the music with some semblance of rhythm was ven­tured for a time and enjoyed by all. 
The eVfming was brought to a glori­ous denouement when everybody got out after the last Natural Lite disap­peared and "Tubthumpin"' was playod for the 54th time. Harrigan judged the gala an unmitigated smash. 
"Next time, though," he said, "we'll have a strobe light."

Let's end the graffiti dance 
It's time to 

laugh at fear 
Over break I went to the dentist to get some cavities lilled. I halt1 going to the dentist. I'm terrified of it. Every time I have to go I drnad it for weeks, and when the actual appointment comes around I can barely drive myself there. Sitting in the dentist's chair on Thursday Ijust about passed out hyp,wventilating. I rlon't know why I am so scared of tho den­tist. I havn nevHr had a cruel. sadistic, or even an unpleasant dentist. It's my own personal irrational phobia; I don't even prntend to he brave about it. I just whine and mope and shake a lot when I havo to go. 
So as I was sitling there. mouth agape\ wishing the dentist would stop drilling, I lr.t my mind wander to other things that pPopln am afraid of', as though thinking of' other people's pho­bias would somehow lessen my own. During my semester abroad in Spain I trave!Pd a lot with a woman who had a pathological foar ol' lish. She wouldn't go near them, much less cat onr,, until her Spanish family tricked her into eating tuna pizza. I remembl'l" WI' were in Barcelona in the Olympic village area, wh,m• tlrnre is a long wooden bridge with gaps brtw1wn tlw slats. Tim wawr beneath the bridge is illumi­nated by dozens of bright lights. and you could sec thou­sands or fish finning around bPlow. She could barely make hcrsdf' cross that bridge and ki1pt glancing nervously down at tlwm, as though tlwy wnrn suddenly going to rise up and swarm lwr. 
Oncn someone askPd her. "What about those harmless litLIP lish that nibblo on your toes whih1 you're wading'?" Slw wont white and had to sit down beforr. mustering a n'sponsP: "Those are llw worsc kind." 
A formPr roommate is seriously terrified of missing the X-Fi!(1s. It goes beyond a simple dcsirn to sec the show. She gets sweaty and anxious if' she isn't around on Sunday nights to sen il. Even if she knows the VCR is set to tape it, Hvcn if she is positive she will be able to get back in time to watch it, she starts to get jittery around 8:30 p.m. She knows that missing a week won't kill her, and she's not nven all that dcsperat(1 to sec it, but the fear that she will miss smrn~thing important overrides her normal life. 
Another friend of mine replied thal she is terrified of spi­ders. In lrnr words, '"Completely irrational, but big hairy spiders. Or littlti hairy spiders. Or even little hairless spi­ders. I can't even touch pages in National Geographic that have pictures or spidrrs." 
I got another response that would have made me laugh if not for its serious, sort of panicked tone. "The weirdest thing I'm afraid of is eating 'Death by Chocolate' ice cream. It's all psychological. obviously stems from my fear of death ... In tPrms of' tlw ice cream in particular, it's just silly, yes, but l always thought when I was little -that if I ate 'Death by Chocolate' icn cream -that it would turn out to be 'lit­Prally' corrnct." 
Wl1ile tlin drntist drilled and I fidgeted, trying to get away without causing myself morn harm, I considered the fear I hear most oftcm. l work in the Emergency Department at the Elkhart General Hospital. whern one o[ the things I spend my time doing is talking to people about being in the EH. Many of them, probably half. express a fear of doctors or of hospitals, of b.lood or of needles. This always makes me stop and think, because I am fascinated by all of these things. As a premed major. I plan on centering my life around them. Yet some people feel the same way about getting blood drawn that I do about going to get my tf~eth ckaned. I think it is interesting, too, that the things we are most afraid of we admit openly. I walkHd into the dentist's of'ficn and told IW(ffyonP I talked to that l was scared -the hygcnist. the dentist, Lim other people in Urn waiting area. Although nearly everyone qualified them with a "It's silly" or "This is really dumb, but ... ," all of the people I polled for tbis column quickly announced their biggest fears.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Honor donors in church 
l wish to respond to the letter of Salvadora Hernandez in The Observer March 6, 2000. The letter in point was headlined "Don't discriminate in church." 
Apparently the writer was deeply offended that she was asked to sit in a side aisle at a 5 p.m. mass at the Basilica, as a portion of the main aisle was reserved for the participants of the Scholarship Pcllowship Recognition Weekend. I would like to point out that tho attendees were about 250 in number hardly taking up the bulk of the Basilica. As for a wedding, a special group, it is customary to give the honorees the privilege of sitting togeth-
The Graffiti Dance was a memorable point in my Freshman Orientation at Notre Dame late last summer. Unfortunately it was memeorable for all the wrong reasons. Besides becoming very good at finding a place left on my t-shirt for people to sign and relating my name. dorm and probable major, I came away with nothing more than a t-shirt full of names that meant nothing, phone numbers that would never be called and disbelief in the fact that the graffiti dance was supposed to be the highlight of official Freshman Orientation social events. 
So, what is so bad or wrong about this time hon­ored tradition at Fresh O'? Well, I guess not that much if you don't want to consider that we hold a "dance" were no one is dancing. Go watch the graffiti dance and there is absolutely no one danc­ing. Barely audible music and throngs of people walking around searching for that next phone number to fill up the remaining space on their shirt does not constitute a dance. Fine, so perhaps all that is needed is to change the name of the event. Well, let's try renaming tht=m ... how about "Waste of Time on Basketball Courts." 
Recent meetings have brought the downfalls in the current "dance" into the spotlight.. At the most recent CLC meeting our very own Student Body President Elect, Brian O'Oonoghue gave as his rea-

Somehow I feel the letter of Miss Hernandez indi­cates an ultra-touchy and whiny attitude. Miss Hernandez acknowledges the generosity of these donors have made it possible for her to attend Notre Dame. Was it really asking too much of her to extend a gracious courtesy to this group by allowing them to sit together in the main aisle?

son(s) for keeping the "dance" the following state­
ment, "There is a meat market mentality, but no 
one gets rejected." So I guess according to Brian 
it's okay to accept a meat market mentality. Let's 
really sit back and think what is meant by the 
phrase, "meat market mentality". The phrase 
implies that those at the dance, both male and 
female are viewed not as potential friends, but as 
pieces of meat, and thus call for the respect given 
to a piece of meat. 
I believe that our student body and especially those freshmen of the futre here at Notre Dame deserve and should demand BETTER than a "meat market mentality" for those who are becoming part of our Notre Dame family. Further di!>cussion is needed to search for an alternative to this cur­rently accepted "meat market" of a culminating social activity for freshmen at our University. Walking away with a shirt full of names and phone numbers does not help anyone orient themsleves to any aspect of Notre Dame.

CONCERT REVIEW 
Oasis gets back to basics in Japan 
By SEAN KJNG 
Scene Music C:riric 
Oasis continued its string of sold out concerts ar-ross Japan March 
5. delivering a hard-hitting 90-minulP set to over 15.000 hollering fans. Arter an often tumultuous and self'­twaluating two years for this band. Japan is the perfecl place to get back to just playing bluP-collar rork 'n' roll and lr,tting th11 rest take rnre of itself'. 
Nobody outside the United Kingdom has mor<-' consistently supported Oasis than the Japanese. Afler the Gallagher brothers· presence nearly caused riots on the Tokyo subway during their first visit here in J994, younger sibling Liam f'elt fit to der,larC'. " ...Japan was mega. It was like a '%" llard Day·s Night!" The quotr was or coursP a direct reft>r­encf' to the 1963 BP.atles film, in which Liam's idols are endlessly chased through the streets of London by adoring fcmalP fans. Liam's initial Japan euphoria of six years ago may be well behind him now. but the band's latest album. Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants. has been nonethelrss resting comfortably atop the HMV Tokyo album chart since its release here on Feb. 21. And wherev­er you go. you cannot avoid hearing the album's first single "Go Let It Out" at least once a day. 
Oasis take the stage in near apoca­lyptic fashion. as the translucent cur­tain drops and the semi-dancrablc "**"*in' In ThP Bushes" breaks the pre-show jitters at an almost deafen­ing volume. The af'ornmenlioncd "Go Let It Out" is then followed bv the mellow, optimistic "Who Fenls l~ove." Many people i:ount this song among their ne"\' album favorites. but this slow a song shouldn't be played this early on. Oasis quickly atorrn for this minor glitch with a string of' heavy­handed hits that includes "Super• sonic." "Shakermaker"and 1995 B­side cull favorite '·Acquiesce." 
After a bit of a lull with harrnlt>ss enough new tracks "Sunday J\1orning Call," "Where Did It All Go \Nrong" and ''Gas Panic," the Pvening shifls into sing-along gr.ar l'or good by way of "Holl With It." "Stand By Me" and "VVonderwall." The easy highlight of tlrn night is everyone thumping up and down in unison to the T. Rex•like "Cigarr.tles and Alcohol." complete with a pseudo impromptu jam session of "American Woman" tacked on for good measure. As if to allow everyone to regain themsr.lves after that onr.. elder sibling and scmgwriter Noel set­tles into the reflective "Don't Look Back In Anger." only to have fire­starter Liam soon return for a fist­clrnching rendition of "Live Forever." 
As if to spell out the obvious. Oasis close the night with "Hock 'n' Holl Star," a song written long before they even beg:an to realize their eventual fate of being near•permanent fixtures on the world celebrity circuit and the front pages of Britain's most rancid tabloids. 


The show's only notable disappoint­
ment is the absence of anv of the nPw in-your-face tracks like "Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is" or "I Can See a Liar." But, there's no reason to be too concerned. Tonight. we're all rock 'n' roll stars; it doesn't get much better than this.

dub scene. Entire walls or music stores are covered by Club Compilations. all of which arc virtually the samP.. con­taining around 40 1;r so essentially similar songs. 
The Club 2000 dance hits release is no exception. Available in virtuatly any record or grocery store here in London. Club 2000 is a perfect taste of the club scene. without having to pay an outrageous cover to be surrounded by a sea of trendy, black-turtlenr,ck­clad Hritish pr.ople and clumsy American tourists. From the very beginning of this two-disc, 43 song compilation. il is dear that there will be no attempt at profundity made as the original mixes of these songs are presented in continuous manner, ideal for a three•hour dance party or torture session. 
The first three tracks are the strongest on the release -one need not g;.J mui:h further to understand what "dubbin' in the new millennium" is all about. The Artful Dodg<'r is posi­tivelv Dickensian on "Hewind." Tho Wamduc Projei:t chime in with th<' hit of the season, "King: of My Castle." And Bob Marley vs. Fun kStar De Luxe's bastardized version of "Sun Is Shining" shows that in full combat. Funkstar Do Luxe is able to utterly destroy the old Soul Hebel. 

From there, one becomes literally entranced by thr, continuous and monotonous disco beat, which rever­beratr,s through the soul until it becomes absolutely unbearable. 
But disco-dancin' music is not really about expression. It's not about sitting around and finding important social messagr,s in the mixes. llather. it is about drunken, ecstatic hedonism, sweaty bodies grinding: against each other on an illuminated floor. and about finding: that certain special someono sexy enough to wake up next to just once in a lifetime. For this. the music is perfPctly conceived, and l count myself lucky for having had the opportunity to experience the London disco scene in its entirety. Disco is not dead. It is constantly renewing itself in ever•more mindless and repetitive forms. And God F3 less us all for that.

however, was the song that I listened to over and over. 
"Minnesota 01rn" and "Every Time I Win" are probably the band's strongest marks on the album But tlrn band's greatest asset would have to be the sweet yet edgy, versatile voire of lead singer Hoffman. Her Yoice has a Gwen Stefani-like sound, but still unique enough to blend per­t'Prtlv with the band. This talented young singer. who ran tackle anything from Guns 'N Roses to The Cardigans. has the potential to lead American Standard to larger venues, even out­side of good ol' South Bend. 
I think these guys are going lo bP. around for a while. Thev sure deservfl to be. The band, howPver, currently marketing its album on the Internet, has recently stumbled upon other bands with the same name. In addi­tion to the trademark infringement issue with a certain toilet manufac­turer, fans should watch for another name change sometime soon. Armed with a yet-to-be-decided new name, the band will fine tune their live show for a national tour in the summer of 
2000.

HOCKEY 
Irish luck runs out in Detroit 
ByTIM LOGAN Spom Writer 
When Notre Dame hockey coach Dave Poulin took the reigns of the fledgling program in 1995, he set a goal for his tAam: Reach the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) semifinals at Detroit's Joe Louis 

Carlson

Arena. 
Pou Ii n and the Irish realized that goal last week when they won two out of three games against Ferris State in the quarterfinals, the first time since 1982 they have won a playoff series and advanced to "Hockeytown." 
But, on St. Patrick's Day, in Detroit. their luck ran out, and the lrish foll 4-0 to the Michigan State Spartans, who then topped University of Nebraska-Omaha 6-0 Saturday to claim the confer­ence title. 
After the loss, Poulin remained positive about his team's accom­plishment. 
"lt was a very significant step," he said of reaching the semifi­nals in the CCHA, one of college hockey's top conferences, for the first time in 18 vears. 
He particularly thanked the seniors, who joined the program when it was in its infancy, and who led it to this point. 
"They saw a vision I had," he said. "Joe Louis Arena was a big part of that vision and becoming one of the top teams in the CCHA." 
The Irish faced Michigan State, a long-established conference power, in their semifinal match. Despite donning kelly green jer­seys for the first time in its hock­ey history, Notre Dame came out flat in the first period. 
And the No. 9 team in the country capitalized. 
The Spartans scored three times in the first 20 minutes of play, and spent the rest of the game stymieing the Irish offense. They added an empty net goal in the final minutes to make it 4-0. 
"We were never able to get our offense going early and they fed off that," he said. "They're a very good defensive hockey team and they feed off of you getting frustrated and your lack of offense." 
The Irish mustered a mere 20 shots against the CCHA-leading Spartan defense, their lowest total since a h-0 drubbing at the hands of Northern Michigan on Jan. 14. 
The green jerseys were a sur­prise, and the players only learned of them upon arriving in the locker room before the game. But this appeal to St. Patrick was not enough to bring the Irish a victory over the Spartans, who wear green in ev<Jry game. 
"Emotionally, I think it was a lift," Poulin said. "It would've been great if it was a deciding facror, but something like that isn't going to do it. It's a small, small piece." 
Notre Dame played Michigan State four times during the regu­lar season, \-\inning once, losing twice and tying once. The Irish clinched home ice in the first round when they tied the Spartans 2-2 on March 3. Friday's game was the most lop­sided of the season between the two teams. 
To reach "The Joe" Notre Dame first needed to win a best­of-thrce series with Ferris State March 10-12. The Bulldogs, who beat the Irish twice during the regular season, came into the Joyce Center seeded sixth in the conference, but with a better overall record than Notre Dame. 
Game One was a back-and­forth battle that was still. in doubt in the final seconds. Junior forward Dan Carlson gave Notre Dame the lead for good with 
In both 1998 and 1999. they also dropped the third game. 
But not this year. 
The Irish jumped out in front early i.n Game Three, scoring the first two goals, and hung on to win an intense game 4-2. after junior forward Ryan Dolder sealed the victory with an empty 
net goal ­ his third of the tour­ 
nament  - with 16 seconds  
remaining.  

Notre Dame's first three goals came from some unlikelv con­tributors -junior forwards Matt Van Arkel and Jay Kopischke and senior defenseman Tvson Fraser. The trio had combined for just 10 goals all season, but they were in the right plare at the right time against Ferris State. 
When the final buzzer sound­ed, the Irish, and many fans at the Joyce Center, waited to hear the results of the game between seven-seed Nebraska-Omaha and four-sred Northern Michigan and find out who Notre Dame would play next. 
If Northern Michigan won, Notre Dame would face Bowling Green in a play-in game for the fourth seat in the semifinals. Bowling Green, who finished No. 8 in the conference, had elimi­nated third-seed Lake Superior State the previous night. If Nebraska-Omaha prevailed, they would face Bowling Green in the play-in, and Notre Dame would head straight for Detroit.

left, putting the Irish up 4-3. 
The team clung to this lead for the rest of the game, relying on the strong play of defensemen Tyson Fraser, Nathan Borega, Sean Molina and Sean Seyferth and golden-helmeted goalie Tony Zasowski, who made a brilliant save to preserve the lead with 17 seconds remaining. 
Ferris State dominated Game Two, earning a 6-1 victory. The Bulldogs went up 2-0 early, and then scored a short-handed goal at the start of the second period to take a 3-1 lead. They never looked back. · 
It marked the third year in a row that the Irish had won the first and lost the second game in the best-of-three quarterfinals. 
Michigan 1. The Irish were going to Detroit. 
"It's something we've been waiting four years for," Borega said. 'Tm kind of numb to it right now." 
The last time Notre Dame reached the conference semifi­nals was 1982, when Poulin was the captain and Michigan State beat them 4-1. Poulin scored the lone goal. The Irish left the CCHA in 1983 and did not rejoin until 1992. 
Last season was the first time the team had earned home ice for the first round since rejoining the conference. 
They lost to Northern Michigan 2 games to 1 that year. This year was the first time they have won a playoff series. 

MEN'S TENNIS 
No. 36 ND places fifth in Blue-Gray Classic 
By RACHEL BIBER Sports Wricer 
Heading south was no vaca­tion for the Irish men's tennis team as they made their annual trek to the prestigious 16-team Blue-Gray National Classic in Montgomery, Ala. March 16-19. 
Thirty-sixth-ranked Notre Dame finished the four-day event tied for fifth and improved its dual match record to 9-5 by posting a 2-1 record in the competition. 
The squad suflered a loss to 5th-ranked Illinois, but netted impressive wins over 26th­ranked Virginia and 38th­ranked University of Alabama­Birmingham. 
Notre Dame put up a heroic fight to capture the doubles point against

Notre Dame improved to 8-4 after Farrell locked up the win. and set up a second round bat­tle against the Fighting Illini. 
For the second time in two weeks Illinois r:ame out on top over the Irish with a 5-2 victory on the second day of tourna• ment play. 
The lllini's 13th-ranked Cary Franklin avenged an earlier loss to Sachire in the No. 1 sin­gles match with a 6-2, 4-6, 1-0 (10-6) win. 
Taborga provided the lone singles win for the Irish with a 6-4, 6-3 defeat of Illinois' Jamal Parker at No. 4 singles.

into singles play. 

Seniors Ryan Sachire and Trent Miller teamed up to defeat 46th-ranked Tommy Croker and John Winter 9-8 (7­
4) at No. 2 doubles, while sophomores James Malhame and Casey Smith squeaked by the Cavaliers' Hobert Abendroth and Brian Hunter 9­7 at No. 3 doubles. 
All-American and 10th­ranked Sachire of Notre Dame was handed his first loss in seven matches against Virginia's fifth-ranked Brian Vahaly in the No. 1 singles match 6-3, 6-3, allowing the Cavaliers to even the score at 1­

Taborga put the Irish in the lead with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Croker at No. 4 singles, and Andrew Laflin extended the advantage to 3-1 with a 6-3, 6­2 victory at No. 5 singles. The Cavaliers closed the gap when Smith dropped a tight three-set match at No. 2 singles, 7-5, 2-6, 1-0 (10-7}. 
Brian Farrell, playing in his first match since February 27, showed no signs of rust, provid­ing the clinching win for the Irish with a 6-3, 6-4 win at No. 6 singles.

tiebreakers. 
"We're disappointed we didn't beat Illinois," Bayliss said. "But it just wasn't meant to be. It was probably the best match of the tournament." 
The Irish were able to recov­er from the Illinois loss by beat­ing the Ui\B Blazers 5-2 in the final match of the weekend's competition. Notre Dame swept the doubles for two points and won three singles matches to beat the Blazers, improving to 9-5 ,-vith the win. 
"The doubles was a highlight for us," Bayliss said. "To do as well as we have lately is a plus." 
Under the new experimental dual-match for.mat, the Irish took a 2-0 lead by winning all three doubles matches. Taborga and Talarico came away with the No. 1 match with an 8-4 victory, while Miller and Sachire and the duo or Malhame and Smith both post­ed 8-4 wins at Nos. 2 and 3 doubles respectively. 
Notre Dame's lead was widened to 4-0 with wins by Smith and Farrell over their UAB opponents. 
Laflin then overcame a shaky start and rallied for a 1-6, 7 -6, 1-0 ( 11-9) in the No. 3 singles match to clinch the victory.

IRISH INSIGHT 
Irish look for redemption with solid NIT performance 
With the Irish shut out of an N(AI\ tour­nam,mt bid. Matt Doherty's club has united 11round tbe common goal of earning n1demption by winning thr National Invitation 
·1·ournamci1t. 
Tlrny've put !heir 'A' game faces on and the Irish appear well on LhPir way back to playing in Madison Squarn (~arden. aftnr bi~at­ing the Mirhigan Wolvf'rines 75-65 in the first round and the Xavier Musketeers 76-64 in the second round. 

"We want to prove the Committcc ,,vrong by not letting us into the NCAA tourna­ment," sophomore forward Harold Swanagan said. "We're out Lo prove some­thing. That's our mihds0t every game. We're going to go out there and play our hardest and show everybody that we could have played in the Tournament They made a mistake." 
Getting a couple or live victories in the NrT would surelv show the selection com­mittee that the Irish were worthy of anoth­er look. 
"We fed like we'rn out here with some­thing to prove," Murphy said. "We want to prove to the NCAA tournament that we belonged in there, and maybe make them think twice about what they did. Xavier was a team that was a bubble team, and we beat them. We're just trying to show people that we should have gotten in." 


Notre Dame shook off the disappointment of mLc;sing the NCAI\ tourna­ment by focusing on extending their season in the NIT. 
"Everyone would like to go (o the NCA\ tourna­ment," Dohertv said. "But the fact that we're here, 
we're going to make the 
most of it. Our kids shook 
that NCAA deal off and 
were able to come out 
and beat Michig11n and 
Xavier." 
The Irish aren't content 
to put away their uni­
forms for the season just 
yet. Although they've 
already postC'd more wins 
than any Notre Dame 
team in the past 10 years, 
they want to keep 
improving their record. 
"Most people, I think. 
ifwe lost today, would 
say, boy you had a good 
year," Doherty said. "You threatened to 
make the NCAA tournament. You made 
the NIT. You beat Michigan and lose 
today, it's okay. And I told them at pre­
game meal-I don't want that thought 
creeping into your head. 
"Yeah, people feel you had a good year, 
but I want more," Doherty said. "I want 
20 wins. I want to win on national TV I 
want to keep playing. I want to practice 
tomorrow. We had a little gut check 
there, and our kids came through.." • 
Doherty got his 20 wins with the victorv 
over Xavier, and now he's looking for No~ 
21. 
The Irish are out there playing so they wind up with no regrets come the end of the season. They're going after every rebound and playing defense like their life

is on the line. 
"The kids, they're tough," Doherty said. "They compete. Did you see them diving on loose balls? I mean, that was fun. Matt Carroll, Jimmy Dillon, David Graves. !just think they're a tough group of kids." 
Sophomore David Graves must have been starving for a little redemption Monday. He

led the fiery Notre Dame effort early, scor­ing 21 of his 24 points in the first half, and fighting for nine rebounds in the victory. 
Guards Jimmy Dillon and Matt Carroll were all over the floor for the Irish, diving for every loose ball and some that weren't. 
The other two Irish starters, Murphy and Swanagan, played substantial mmutes despite recent injuries. 
Swanagan scrambled for seven rebounds and scored seven points in 26 minutes of play after hurting his knee in the Michigan game. Murphy sprained an ankle in practice Sunday, but battled back to score 21 points and nine rebounds in a physical 36 minutes on the court. 
Nobody on Notre Dame's men's basket­ball squad wants to close out the season without an NIT Championship banner to hang in the Joyce Center. But it won't be a cakewalk getting there. 
"Just because we're on the bubble doesn't grant us the right to win this NIT," Doherty said. "The NIT's pretty strong and probably stronger this year than it's ever been because teams like Notre Dam<', Vanderbilt, Virginia, Villanova, didn't get into the NCAA tournament. I don't want the guys to have any regrets." 
Three more wins, and they won't.

The lrish's µre-game 1~outinc would make the Armed forces proud. Prior to each game, dur­ing stretching drills, the Irish players sit in a certain order in the circle. On the road the order is different from the home games but is always eonsistf'nt. 
"You have your away positions amt your home positions," Henderson said. 
Then as they head to the Joyce Center from their stretching exercises in the Pit, the team sings a special song, always the same one, out loud. Last ynar the song was "It's so bard to say Goodbyn" by Boyz U Men. This season, it's a secret. 
"We'd rather not say what the song is," said a group of players including Henderson, Meaghan Leahy and Imani Dunbar, "But Nicle [Ivey] is the best singer." 
While they won't reveal their lucky pre-game song, the Irish players did acknowledge that their team song (which is dilTer­ent than the pm-game tune) has changed from Sisco ·s "Thong Song" during the regular season to 
Sonique's "It feels so good" for the NCAA.'s. 
As they prepare for warm-up drills, Henderson leads the team but Kelley Siemon must go first in all the drills. Except fur the free throw shooting d1ills where Henderson goes first and Alicia Ratay shoots third. Henderson also touches the "Attitude of a Champion" sign in their locker room first before the team enters the arena. 
During the NC.AA tournament, the Irish become evrm more supPrstitious. 
The players approached McGraw before the Sflasou began. asking for the green uni­forms. It wasn'l an easy proposi­tion. as they first had to get approval from the administra­tion. The powers-to-lie complied with their 
request but stipulated that they only wear them on certain occa­sions. This weekend's games was the fourth and fifth times they wore the new uniforms on the season. the first thrm~ coming earlier in the season in victories over North Carolina and Libcrtv in the Wachovia Women's · Invitational and a loss al Purdue. 
After winning the first two games in the NCM's wearing the green. the Irish have come up with a sensible conclusion. 
"We'll wear them as long as we can." Hflnderson said. 
In addition to the green uni­forms. the entire team paints their nails grnen for the tourna­ment. including the managers, trainers, and anyone associated with the team. Ewm the males have one of their pinky fingers decorated in grefm. Radio announcer Jeromy Gray has also been coerced to paint bis pinky. 
A new tradition also began this weekend. Just as they were about to head lo the sidelines for the beginning of Friday's game, Ivey and Erika Haney began to dance a jig. The rest of the team followed the duo's lead, huddling in a circle and showing some· dance steps. Accordingly, the Irish gathered for their rendition of the jig before Sunday's second round victory over George Washington.

2. Junior star Mir.belle Dasso rallied to claim her eighth-con­secutive No. 1 singles victory, defeating BYU's Eline Chow 3­6, 6-0, 6-2. in a match that set the tone for the day. 
Inspired by the ·play of their star, the Irish won four of the rnmaining five singles matches in straight sets, demonstrating lo the Cougers that the possibil­ity of an upset was rnmote. 
Becky Varnum, Kelly Zalinski, Nina Vaughan and Katie Cunha all scored impres­sive straight set wins clinching victory and running the team's winning streak to five. 
Sophomore Lindsey Green suffered the team's only set­back, dropping her No. 5 sin­gles match in straight sets. 
The Irish were equally effoc­Live in doubles play. The pair­ing of Cunha and Dasso netted an easy No.1 doubles win, while Varnum and Vaughan added a No. 3 doubles triumph. 
Hiding high on a five match win streak, tlrn Irish hoped their luck wouldn't run out as they headed further west to meet the Wave of Pepperdine on Saturday. The Wave. howev­er, would prove too much, as they rolled over the Irish 7-2, raining down on the Irish and ruining what would have been a belated St. Patrick's Day parade.

Having already clinched the match in singles play, the Wave continued to drown the Irish in taking two of three doubles matches. 
After a stormy finish to their west coast trip, the Irish will hope for sunnier skies when they return home to face the Jayhawks of Kansas next week.

WOMEN'S NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP 

Notre Dame pulls aw-ay from San Diego in first round 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 
Associare Sporrs Ediror 
The No. 2-seeded Notre Dame women ·s basketball team (26-4) opf'ned NCAA tournament play with an emphatic 87-61 win over San Diego (17­13). 
The Irish owned the game from start to fin­ish. They jumped out to a 10-1 lead on two quick baskets by junior All-American Ruth Riley, two free throws by freshman Alicia Ratay and two buckets by senior Julie Henderson. 
They never looked back. 
"My teammates knew that [Jessica] Gray was a little shorter than me," Riley said. "So they were looking for me inside, and I was just happy I was able to connect." 
The Irish increased their lead throughout the first half. Senior guard Niele Ivey scored nine of her 14 points in the first half, and Riley laid in 12 of' her 14 in the opening peri­od. 
San Diego was no pushover, though, as they orchestrated a 16-7 run in which six Toreros scored. 
"They never quit," Notre Dame head coach Muffet Mr,C;raw said. "Every time Wf' thought we could put them away in the first half, they came back. We have to get away from the point of being up 15 and letting them back in the game. And that's where WA need to g11t that killer instinct."

At halftime, Notre Dame led San Diego 42-31, a gap the Irish thought should have been greater. 
"We really didn't feel like we were doing much on defense," Riley said. "We needed to pick it up a lot with our intensity and getting out on the shoot­ers." 
In the second stanza, the Irish clamped down defensive­ly. They held tho Toreros scoreless from the field for nearly Aight minutes. 
"That was exactly what we were looking for," McGraw said. "We had somA miscom­munication in the first half, and they got some open looks. We wanted to work on our switches a little bit more and get a hand in their face. I think that with a hand in their face, that's why they shot so poorly for those eight minutc·s." 
Senior guard Danielle Green finished off the stretch with an off-balance driving lay-up that extended the lead to 66-40. 
"I was looking for Ericka [Haney]" Green said. "She was open for a second there and then I looked back again and a defender was on her. I was already up in the air, and I just threw it up in there. It was just all reaction." . 
Mr,Graw enjoyed the li1xury of giving her bench significant playing time. 
Four players scored in dou­ble digits for the Irish -Riley, Green, Ivey and reserve Kelley Siemon with 13. All 12 players on Notre Dame's roster scored in thA game. 
"It's definitely important that wt1 gt1t our bench involved in the game," McGraw said. "It's the NCAA tournament. We want to get them some expr.ri­ence so that if we need them. we're able to use them later on.

The Notre Dame men's lacrosse team struggled in its three-game stretch last week. 
The Irish started off by beating both Denver (12-8) and Air Force (10-6), despite inconsistent play on offense and defense. But the poor play of the Irish caught up with them against Loyola as they were blown out by a score of 12­2. 
Against Denver Notre Dame got out to a quick 4-0 start in the first period. John Harvey sparked the lead with two early goals and lin­ished the afternoon with his first career hat trick. 
Despite the early lead, the spo­radic play of thfl Irish enabled Denver to edge their way back into the game when the Irish defense gave up six goals in the second and third periods. 
"We had the chance to put them away and we didn't," Notre Dame head coach Kevin Corrigan said "We arc not finishing when given the opportunity." 
With the game tied 7-7 entering the fourth period, the Notre Dame attack broke out of their shell and scored four quick goals to give them a commanding lead. 
"It was nice to come out in the fourth quarter and execute," Corrigan said. "We are playing well at times but we should have shut them out in the first half when we had the chance." 
Two days later Notre Dame 
Irish win two before ending week with loss 
took on an 0-4 Air Force team that hadn't beaten the Irish in 12 years. Junior Tom Glatzel led the Irish offense and tied a career high with five goals. The Irish took a 10-2 lead into the fourth period. Hut. with the chance to put the Falcons away the Notre Dame defense gave up four quick goals letting Air Force right back in it. 
"We didn't play that well but we did what we intended to do which was win," said Corrigan. "We were easily in control and we would have liked to finish it off with more pizzazz. We need to be more consistent." 
The inconsistency of the Irish would come baf'.k to haunt again as they suffered a huge 12-2 pounding from a highly ranked Loyola team. Loyola came out fired up and scored two goals in the first 15 minutes. Instead of fighting back hard, the Irish gave up an unprecedented eight goals in the second period. 
"We lot them finish the game in the second quarter," said Corrigan "We lost poise and didn't execute and we can't put ourselves in that position." 
The Irish got on the board in the third period with a goal from Chris Young, but it wasn't enough as they ended the day with only two goals, -the second fewest in the 19-year history of the pro• gram 
"Their defense played harder than we played and we shot poor­ly," said Corrigan. "We were just out hustled and outplayed."

"The guys Wl'!'f! setting some tn~nrnnclous sr.rccns for me ~ind Llrnir big m1rn weren't hnlping off the scrt>ens." Gra\lis said. "I was getting opnn and so I kept shooting it. It ('pit gn!al so I kPpt putting it

"Wp wanted to slop Murphy. but w11 felt lO win we would havP to guard the thret>-point lilw and it's evident we didn't do that," Prosser said. "It's not like we said we wanted lo slop Murphy and let the other guys beat us." 
However, it was Murphy and the supporting cast that did the Musketeers in. Xavier took a 45-44 lead with 16:27 left in the game. but Notre Dame came storming back with a 15-4 run to build a 10-point lead midway through the sec­ond half. 
The Irish did a good job of breaking the Musketeers' press and running their half· court offens<l. Graves was called upon to break the press on several occasions. 
"Coach really studied their press:• Graves said. "It's their main defense and they prac­tice it everyday, so we had to pick it apart. It was tough for them to press us, since Coach stressed lhe spacing so much. !--le put me on the wing and ran some isolation for me. We had to get the ball up some­how." 
Notre Dame's half-courl exe­cution, however, struggled in thP late stages or the gamP as they were held scoreless for ncarlv six minutes. The Irish made up for it with stifling defense lhat allowed just six points over those six minutes. 
Murphy made two big hoops down the stretch and clutch free throw shooting helped the Irish pull away. 
"There was too much time left and we had to score." Doherty said. "We were either tired or tentative, but I was concerned. They cut it to three. but Troy went back door and made the basket and I think that was a big play." 
Murphy, who was playing with a sprained ankle, fin• ished with 21 points and nine rebounds. Gravtis, however, led the way with 24 points and nine boards. Freshman Matt Carroll added 13 points and five assists, while Harold Swangan scornd seven points and grabbed seven rebounds. 
The Irish shot 47 percent from the field and 53 percent from beyond the arc. Notre Dame also outreboundcd Xavier. 41-30. 
Maurice McAfec paced Xavier with 18 points on 6-of­15 three-point shooting. Kevin frey had 11 points and Lloyd Price added 10 in a losing effort for the Musketeers.

18-point Ir.ad midway through the game. 
"I came out really aggres­sive. I think that has been missing from me all season." said Green. "l am pleased that my teammates were looking for mfl. I finally had that ener­gy. passion and enthusiasm. I just need to continue that and the team needs to continue that throughout the rr.st of the tournamf'nt." 
Thr, Irish struggled in the opening minutes of the con­test. however. Taking the ba.11 to the basket early, the Colonials earned a quick 8-5 edge on the Irish and forced center Huth Riley to the bench with two personal fouls. 
But the Colonials' perfor­mance wHnt down hill from there as GeorgH Washington missed 16 consecutive shots and allowcrl Green to key a 14-0 run fur the Irish. 
"We st.arlcd off wHII and whpn you play fthe Irish] your main focus is to get Hiley in foul trouble," said Colonials head coach Joe McKeown. "If vou can do that, then ynu don't ~ant to let their othe·r players beat you and I thought Green destroyed us in the first half. She had 16 points and she got them at times when it really opPned the game up." 
The Colonials were unable to get their shooting back on track and finished shooting just 28. 3 percent from the floor on the night. 
"I think [Notre DamH] played well defensively," said Colonials guard Marlo Egleston. "We got a lot of good 
shots. As a team we make them all the time -sometimes they fall and sometimos tlrny don't, that's part of the game. Tonight was not one of the good days for us." 
Sloppy defense only exacer­batfid the underdog's poor shooting. The Colonials com­mitted JO fouls and sent the Irish to the frno-throw line 45 times. 
lvev. who was onlv 5-8 from the lloor, added 10 points l'rom the Irish from charity stripe. 
"Niclo is thP key to our tPam. Sim showed that tonight." said Irish head coach Muffet McGraw. "She did a great job of controlling the tempo. She knows when to sfow down anrl pick up the pace. She knows when to shoot and when not to. She playHd a really intelli­gent llonr game tonight." 
The second half wasn't anv nicer to the Colonials than thr. first.. Able to produce enough offense for onlv one serious run midway in ttie second half, the Colonials wont on an l 1-4 run, but the Irish answered with an 18-5 run of their own and maintained a 30-point lead for the final minutes of t.he game. 
Hiley. who sat out most of the first half, played a big olfonsive role in the second half and finished with 14 points. 
fiuard Alicia Hatay, who went 3-6 from behind the arc, add eel 11 points, making for fivr. Irish players in double fig­ures. lfonderson's 14 points marked a season high and matched her career high-scor­ing record. 
With the win, the Irish travel to Memphis, Tenn. to take on :'lo. 3 Texas Tech in the Sweet 16 this Saturday.

Washington wasn't Notre Dame's final appearance on the court this season. 
With llenderson and Green at the helm, the second seed­ed Irish knocked out the No. 7 seed Colonials from tourna­ment action with a 95-60 routing at the Joyce Center. 
"We knew it was our last game in the back of our minds," said Henderson. "When I got out there in the last three minutes I realized this was the last time on the Irish floor. It was a little emo­tional. I was happy our team played well." 
Senior point guard Niele Ivey, who will return for the Irish next season, led the Notre Dame offense with 23 points as Henderson and Green combined for 30 and made key baskets in the first half to propel the Irish to an

. Irish don green jerseys for St. Patrick's day game 
A l'ew moments beforP the starting lineups were announced on Friday night. the sparse Joyce Center crowd suddenly camr alivn. 
It wasn't for a celebrity sighting or an obnox­ious ran making a scene. 
Rut rather the Irish fans' reaction was dirnctnd towards the wonrnn's bas­kcitball team's choice of attire for their !irst round NCAA tournament game against San Diego. As tlrny 11,~adod towards the bench to prnpare for their introduc­tions, the Irish players took offthnir warm-ups, rr,vnaling predominantly green uni­forms, with white numbers outlined in gold, appropriate for St. Patrick's Day. 
"We wanted to save them for tonight," head coach Mullet McGraw said referring to the uniforms. "San Diego was nice enough to wear their light uniforms." 
The rnlatively new uniforms paid dividends for the Irish. at least according to the players, as they rolled to an 87-61 victory. Whether they wore white. blue, red, or yellow uniforms, it was quite obvious they still would have beaten the over­matched Toreros. 
But don't tell that to this superstitious team. 
Amidst all the quiet confidm1re, obvious talent and cohesion of the No. 6 Notre Dame team lies a group that truly believes in their rituals. 
For seniors JuliP Henderson and Danielle Green, who always room together on road trips, their game day starts at 8 a.m. with a call from Mrs. Henderson. 
"One day we did that [having Mrs. I lenderson call! and me and Danielle both had excellent games," Henderson said. "So we've done it ever since." 
Niele Ivey's mother leaves a message on the voice mail before each game, which the players must listen to. Thr, starting point guard also always wears a red sports bra under her uniform. 
Ruth Hiley is known for her white Adidas head­band. But she only wears it during games. In practices, the All-American center is headband-

Notre Dame defeats Xavier, advances in NIT 
By BRIAN KESSLER Assistant Sports Editor 
When your team has just blown a 10-point second half lead and hasn ·L scored in nearly six minutes, what do you talk about during a media timeout'? 
If vou an" Notre Dame hrad coach Matt Doherty, you listen in on the Notre Dame band and explain to your team what a horrible drummer you once 
were. 
and the band was playing so I popped my head out and was telling the guys how I used 
to play the drums at s t Raymond's grammar school," 
Doherty said. "One day my parents bought me a drum set and I was so bad after awhile that when I came home they sold thr,m. We talk about stuff to keep them loosp, and have run. You can only say so much in a timeout." 
Whatever he said it kept the Irish loose and confident down the stretch, as Notre Dame (20-14) made 11-of-13 free throws and outscored Xavier (21-12) 9-3 in the final two minutes to pull out the 76-64
