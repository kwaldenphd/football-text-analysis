Gallup rating down 
Congressmen. media urge Nixon to quit 
by United Press International 
Several of the nation's leading newspapers, Time magazine and a Republican senator called Sunday for the resignation of President Nixon, whose re-election some of them supported just a year ago. 
Sen. Edward M. Brooke, R-Mass., became the Republican senator to call for Nixon's resignation. 
Asked if he thought Nixon should step down, Brooke said, "I have reluctantly come to that con­clusion ... There's no question that President Nixon has lost his effectiveness as the leader of this country." 
A number of other senators said mail from constituents was running about 6 to 1 against the President, CBS News reported. 
Lowest rating since '69 
The latest Gallup poll showed only 27 per cent of those surveyed supporting the president-far and away his lowest rating since taking office in 1969. 
Chairman Howard W. Cannon, D-Nev., of the Senate Rules Committee, said his mail indicated "there are many people in the country" who believe the president plans to quit despite White House statements to the contrary. But Cannon said in a CBS-TV interview he did not feel Nixon would or should resign at this time. 
Brooke, in an ABC television interview, said of the president: ''There is no question that he is a patriot and I hope that he does reconsider his decision relative to resignation.. J don't think the country can stand the trauma that it has been going through for the past month. 
it has been like a nightmare." 


Time's first editorial 

Time magazine, in its first editorial in 50 years of publication, said that Nixon should resign because "he has irredeemably lost his moral authority, the confidence of most of the country and therefore his ability to govern." 
"The most important decision of Richard Nixon's remarkable career is before him: whether he will give up the presidency rather than do further damage to his country," the magazine said in its latest edition, noting that its now defunct sister magazine, Life, endorsed Nixon for president in 1960, 1968 and 1972. 
The Detroit News, a staunch supporter of President Nixon in the past, said Nixon should step down after Michigan Congressman Gerald Ford has been confirmed as vice president. 
"If he does not resign, serious consideration should be given to his impeachment," the News said. The Denver Post, noting that one year ago to the day it editoriallly supported Nixon for the presidency, said: 
"History would think well of a Nixon decision to step down, not as an admission of guilt, but as a recognition that the needed trust essential to the conduct of his offi~e has been lost," the newspaper said. "Richard Nixon would gain stature by such a selfless move." 
The New York Times said that President Nixon should quit because a "surging torrent" of events has stripped him of his "capacity to act as chief executive." 
"The one last great service that Mr. Nixon can now perform for his country is to resign. He has been trying to 'tough it out' for too long at too great a cost to the nation." the Times said. "As long as he clings to office, he keeps the presidency swamped in a sea of scandal and the American public in a morass of concern and confusion." 
The Gallup Poll showing Nixon's sharply reduced support, was conducted the wekend of Oct. 19-22-the same time as the firing of special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox and the resignation of Attorney General Elliott Richardson. 
The 27 per cent approval for the way Nixon was doing his job, compared with 68 per cent in his favor less than a year ago, according to the Gallup organization in Prin­ceton, N.J. 
To the question, "Do you think the president should be impeached and compelled to leave the presidency, or not," the response was 33 per cent yes, 53 per cent no and 15 per cent with no opinion.

Festivities held Saturday for Law Building completion 
by Mary Kay Baron Staff Reporter 

A festive charm distinguished the events celebrating the dedication of the Kresge Law Library, held 'Saturday in the Notre Dame Law School. Inviting over 300 guests, the Law School commemorated the com­pleted renovation of the building. 
Fr. Theodore Hesburgh initiated the day's activities with a concelebrated mass and a blessing of the Law School building. 
The faculty and students school then toured guests, hosted a reception in the student lounge and climaxed the day's activities with a dinner in the Law Library. 
Special guests at the dinner included Kenneth Montgomery, who recently established the Kiley Fellows, and Judge Riger J. Kiley of the United States Court of Appeals for theSeventhCircuit. U.S. Senator from Indiana Birch Bayh, joined in the day's activities, but could not stay for the dinner. 
Gratefully acknowledging the $750,000 gift from the Kresge Foundation were Thomas L. Shaffer, Dean of the Law School, and Thomas F. McKenna, president of the Student Bar Association. 
Prior to the final benediction by Fr. Edmund P. Joyce, Fr. Hesburgh expressed his gratitude to the speakers at the program who included Stanley S. Kresge, Chariman of the Board of the Kresge Foun­dation; Associate Dean of the Law School David Link· Professor of Law Edward J. Murphy; and Provost Fr: James Burtchaell, who emceed the dinner-time ac­tivities. 
Focusing the contents of his speech upon the model life and integrity of Sir Thomas More, Hesburgh stated, "The world needs kinds of people who are 
willing to live as martyrs and as human as Thomas More." 
Hesburgh continued that it was More's philosophy that every true subject is bound to have respect to his own conscience more than anything else. He quoted More as saying, "If this conscience be not enough to keep a man of faith, let him not live." 
Highlighting the renovations of the Law School building in terms of its expansion and refurbishment, many new features from a modern legal teaching facility in a traditional Gothic setting with contemporary design features. The $1.6 million project, which doubled the building's original amount of usable space, included a modernization of the existing structure and the construction of an addition to the building's east end. Supporting the modernization was the $750,000 grant from the Kresge Foundation, funds from the federal government and con­tributions of Notre Dame law alumni. 

In lieu of renovation, the Kresge Law Library now has tripled its capacity to store books and can now seat every member of the law student body. While wide balconies ­provide study space and casual reading areas, the new library also features sefveeral study

Bowen visits St. Mary's campus 
by Fred Graver Staff Reporter 

Indiana Governor Otis Bowen visited St. Mary's College on Friday afternoon, meeting briefly with Dr. Edward Henry, President of the College, then with the Board of Directors of the College's Parents Council, and finally toured the College's Parent­Delinquent Education Program. 
Bowen held an impromptu news conference while visiting with Henry. He discussed Watergate, the Energy Crisis, and state property taxes with local repor­ters. 
In a brief meeting with the Parents Council, Governor Bowen encouraged the organization by saying "my feelings on education have always been known;J feel it is one of the most important things a state canconcernitself with." 
The Governor's main objective was to tour the Parent-Delinquent Education Program.· He toured with the teachers of the program and met with some of e students. When he asked one of the students how this program differed from the public school system, the student replied, "I don't know.. 
it's just far out." 

Governor Bowen encouraged the students to help the program succeed, explaining that this is a pilot program for a larger state­wide system !lOW being developed. 
"So this makes you all very im­portant people," he said. 
The main purpose of the PDEP is to assist youth, particularly junior high school students, in developing positive self-images. The students receive in­dividualized instruction in academic areas; provisions are made to stimulate hobbies of their own interest; counseling is held on an individual and group basis; and a physical culture program is provided. 
For Life Science library 


Dedication ceremonies held 
by Bob Quakenbush 
Staff Reporter 

Formal dedication ceremonies for the University of Notre Dame's Kirsch-Wenninger Life Sciences Research Library were observed Saturday morning in the Galvin Life-Science Center. Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, University president, officiated at the dedication and Fr. James Burtchaell, Provost, was the principal speaker. 
Alexander M. Kirsch, C.S.C., and Francis J. Wenninger, C.S.C., were two Holy Cross priest­scholars who served as the first two directors of the department of biology at the University. Kirsch, Notre Dame's first geologist, began the University's first fossil collection, and both could be considered as two of the Univer­sity's first life-scientists. 
The Wenninger-Kirsch Biology Hall, located on the North Quad, already honors their memory. The hall formerly housed the depart­ment of biology. However, that building will soon be rededicated Haggar Hall, in recognition of a generous grant by the Haggar family which will permit its 
renovation. 

"Therefore," said Burtchaell during the ceremony, "we decided to bring their names to the center of this hall (Galvin) so that their memory won't fade from Notre Dame." 
A little bit of research, Burtchael revealed, uncovered the fact that this will be the second biology library dedicated to their memory. 
In 1948, the old biology library had been dedicated to them by recently deceased Fr. Kenna. 
After Burtchaell 's opening remarks, Hesburgh formally blessed and dedicated the library in a brief ceremony. 
Within the library now hangs a large marble plaque bearing the following inscription: "May studies here during the unfolding 
years bring growing radiance to the light of scientific learning enkindled at Notre Dame by Fathers Alexander M. Kirsch 0855-1923) and Francis J. Wen­ninger (1884-1940), priests of the Holy Cross, teacher-scholars in the life-sciences, deans, they have sown the seeds of learning which through years of patient growth give rich yield: thirty fold, sixty fold , a hundred fold." 
The text of the plaque, which was completed only Thursday, was inspired by Fr. Charles Sheedy, C.S.C. 
The bookplate which will adorn the inside covers of the library's 22,000 volumes was designed by Fr. Anthony Lauck, C.S.C. The bookplate features a simplified version of the University's official crest, the outlined silhouette of a microscope, and the words, KIRSCH-WENNINGER . LIBRARY.. Souvenir bookplates were distributed to those in at­tendance. 
The more than 50 persons at­tending included Dr. Paul Wein­stein, chairman of the biology department, Dr. Morris Pollard, chairman of the department of microbiology, several faculty members, their wives, students, and friends of the University. 
After the ceremonies, student­conducted tours of the Galvin Life­Science Center were offered to the guests. 
780 tickets donated for student exchange program 
by David Kaminski Staff Reporter 

A final 380 football tickets donated between 1 and 4 p.m. Friday boosted the ticket total to 780 for the fourth annual student ticket exchange held for the Navy game last Saturday. 
In addition, nearly 40 students volunteered as monitors and another 15 students drove area children from their schools to Notre Dame and back again after the game. 
The biggest number of tickets, 380, went to the Neighborhood Study Help Tutoring Program sponsors of the ticket drive. Another 130 children from Logan Center went to the game on the donated tickets. 
Other groups benefiting from the ticket drive were the Northeast Neighborhood Center, Sr. Marita 's Day School, and the Big Brothers of St. Joseph County. 
With the exception of the Logan Center children, who sat together

in section 30, children sat in various parts of the student sec­tions. Students working on the ticket drive sat up late at night matching the seat number of 
volunteer monitors with donated tickets so that the children could be supervised during the game. 
All 780 tickets were not used, according to Art Wesselman, director fo the ticket drive. By Thursday night, Wesselman still needed 300 tickets for groups outside campus and he wasn't sure if he'd get enough tickets to meet all requests. By the time the big wave of donations came in on Friday afternoon, a few of the groups requesting tickets had 
given up hope. In order to solve this problen1 in the future, Wesselman hopes that 
. Notre Dame students will be allowed to donate tickets in the dining halls instead of only at the ACC. In this way, students might donate their tickets sooner and ticket drive organizers might know earlier in the week how many tickets they will have to work with. 
The Neighborhood Study HelpProgram expressed , 
thanks to Don Bouffard and Mike Busick of the tickets office as well as Robert Cahill, business manager of athletics, for their 
cooperationand supervision of the ticket drive.

The students have been referred to PDEP through the South Bend probation department for acts of juvenile delinquency. 
The parents of the students receive weekly group counseling, group instruction in the study and discussion of the role of the parents, and help in un­derstanding the factors relating to juvenile delinquency in the home. 

Governor Bowen's visit marked the second time in recent months that a political figure has toured the PDEP facilities. Senator Birch Bayh <D-Indiana) visited them in August. Bayh had stressed the "need to develop productive, law· abiding young citizens, not only for the sake of the young people who confront the juvenile justice system, but for s~_!ety as well."

ticipate in them, the team travelsall over the midwest as well as 
New Orleans, Boston, Florida and New York. 
The club normally sends one or two teams to participate in tour­naments. These teams are com posed of two people who work with each other throughout the tournament. The members of the Number one team this year are Hayes and Jeff Rajchel, another junior. Senior John Flanagan and Sophomore John Lund are the members of the second team. 
These· two teams generally travel to the more important meets of the season, but everybody on the squad gets to compete for the club at least once this season; mostly due to the tremendous amount of meets that Notre Dame is com­peting in this year. 
The subject for debate remains constant throughout the whole season, as was decided prior to the season in a resolution set forth by the National Debate Society. This year's subject deals with the Energy Crisis. 
The form of a Debate Tournament is somewhat com­plex. When two teams engage in a debate, one team starts off with a ten minute introduction that favors the given subject of debate. A negative ten minute introduction is then given by the other team. The other team member of the positive team then gives a "constructive >peech." This lasts for ten 
ninutes, afterwhich the negative team also gives a constructive >peech. 
After these two speeches, four five minute rebuttals are given by each team. Thus, each match lasts forty minutes. In a tournament, a team will usually have eight such matches, which can lead to a fairly exhausting three days of debating. 
In a tournament sponsored by Central Michigan, the Irish went to the quarterfinals before losing to the eventual tournament winner, Eastern Illinois. 

Notre Dame sponsored a tour­1ament earlier this fall. The .vinner was Purdue, another ex­cellent debating team. Notre Dame did not compete in this tournament. Looking ahead into the later stages of the season, Hayes thinks that the Irish are one of the best teams in the midwest along with Purdue and Michigan. If Notre Dame can defeat these teams and win the Midwest regional, it could find itself in the Nationals this

ND depth charges by Navy, 44-7 
by Vic Dorr Sports Editor 

If turnabout is indeed fair play, Ihan what transpired in Notre ,)arne Stadium on Saturday af­lernoon was the pinnacle of 
,ecency and equanimity. 
Coach Ara Parseghian's fifth­ranked Fighting Irish football feam collided with the Midshipmen .1f the U.S. Naval Academy, took

fast and furious final half to

The game was a complete

'hiladelphia, which saw the two

he floor of Veterans' Stadium until 
:o.l'e Dame posted a 42-23 victory. The Irish hung up a 35-0 lead after the opening 30 minutes of last year's encounter, and then hung on during a lethargic second half to earn their triumph. 
But on Saturday, in front of a 48th consecutive home sellout crowd, there was no in­surmountable lead posted at the end of the first half: Notre Dame led only 14-0 at intermission. Nor was their any second-half let­down: ND's number one offense, capitalizing on a pair of Navy turnovers scored twice during the first four minutes of the final half and made the game's outcome academic. 
It was only a question of "how much" after the second of these TD's and for Navy's beleagured defenders the 'how much' turned out to be plenty. 
Not even a plethora of second­team fumbles could keep Par­seghian's Irish from tallying 30 second half points and chalking up their third-largest margin of the two month-old season. 
"The first half of today's ball game went just about as I'd ex­pected," admitted the Notre Dame coach. "We were afraid that an emotional letdown might follow last week's game with Southern Cal, and in the first half today we were a bit sluggish--offensively and defensively. 
"But we played better in the second half, except for the (six) fumbles by our reserves, and Navy's turnovers early in the third quarter blow the game wide open for us." 
Though the Middies amassed only 80 yards total offense during the first half--ND's first half figuers were 103 total yards--the visitors moved the ball without fumbles and without interceptions ("How he held onto that ball when
