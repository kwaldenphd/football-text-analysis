Senate oveJ1urJns salary resolution 
WASIIIN<iT(lN l'n:~ident Reagan invoked limitt:tl diplomatic and aviation restrictions on \loscow last night in re:-.pon:-.e 10 the downing of a South Kort·an airliner and :-aid. "This crinll' against humanit~ mu:-.t nt·\-er he lorgollen." 
lie imposed no lOugh enmomic :-.anl'lions and he loresworc venge· anet: agam:-.t the Soviets. ht• said, despite "the savagery of their crime."· 
l :sing a tape recording of a Soviet pilot announcing to a ground con· troller that "the target is destroyed" two seconds alter a missik was launched, Reagan demanded an accounting and an apology from the Soviet l nion. 
Speaking 10 the nation hy tdevi· sion and radio from the Oval Ofike. the president rderred hmr times to "what can only ht· called the Korean Air l.ine ~assacrt·." 
"Our immediate challengt· to thi:-. atrm:ity i:-. 10 ensure that we make the skies safer and that we seek just compensation lor the families of those wl~o wert· kilkd." Rt·agan said. 
lie called lor 1he Soviet:-. to com­
pensate victims ol the air tragedy. 
Otficials in \1ost·ow have not ad 
muted shooting down the Korean 
Air Lines !light last Thursday, hut ac­
knowkdgt· llrmg warning shots at it. 
The Boeing-.. -carried 269 people 
to their tkaths. 
llowever, Reagan said he was presenting "tht· incontrovertihk evidence that the Soviets were responsihk" and then reviewed the three-hour tlight that ended in death for those on the ~ew York-10-Seoul tlight, which included 61 l .S. resi­dents. 
The pre:-.ident unveikd a series ol restrictions agamst \1oscow. includ­ing cancdl<ttion ol an agreement on transportation cooperation. 
lie said the l nited States has reaf­firmed its han of Soviet planes Jan· ding at l .S. airports. asked other countries to ;1dopt similar restric· lions and is "examining additional steps we can take with regard to Aerotlot t;~eilities in this country." 
lk praised Canada. which earlier in the day announced that it was suspending the Soviet airline's lan­
ding  and  refueling  privileges  in  
\tontreal  and  (iander.  New­ 
foundland.  

The l nited States alone could do lillie to restrict the Soviet l nion':-. commercial aviation activities, hut a suspension of landing rights and ac· tions taken in cooperation with other nations could have a sig· niticant impact. 
"This allack wa:-. not just against oursdves or the Repuhlic o! Korea," said Reagan. "Thi:-. was the S<n iet l nion against the world and the moral precepts which guide human relations among people everywhere.

Regardless of whether or not one agrees with the European view, it is important that America's leadership not ignore it.

Showcase 
A summer under the Dome 
by Margaret Fosmoe 
F
our-color glossy brochures ofan idvllic sunnv lakeside haven are how ~ost stud~nts are introduced to Notre Dame. The brochures are splashed with shots ofthe Dome, the Grotto, the football stadium and smiling students swimming in St. Joseph's Lake and riding bikes. The literature that accompanies them paints a colorful pastoral pictureofa pensive yet carefree midwestern setting. 
Then the students arrive in In­diana and find out that the Dome L~ closed off, the fish in the lake nibble and it's very hard to maneuver a bike through three feet ofsnow. 
Most forget all abo_ut the brochures and settle in for four years ofbooks, dining hall cuisine and Hoosier weather, punctuated by the occasional football game, happy hour and summer vacation. 
There are some, however, who freely elect to experience a summer under the Dome. 
Asummer on campus is a glimpse at a part of Notre Dame that most people never see. It's like finding a way into the fourteenth floor ofthe library or sneaking a peek into Hes­burgh's office when the secretary isn't looking. 
Asummer under the Dome changes your whole perspective on the place. Any picture of Notre Dame is not complete without the summer. 
The campus, deserted after graduation, takes on a totally dif­ferent personality. For once. the lakes become the focal point. The ducks, no longer tormented by legions of joggers, flock day and night to the northeast cornerofSaint Mary's Lake. 
Wandering across an empty quad without the fear of being decked by a errant frisbee or a careening golf cart is an odd sensation. Thousands ofdollars worth oftlowers and greenery added a few weeks earlier for commencement seem to be there just for you. 
One of the most striking dif­ferences is the color. Most under­grads are all too familiar with the dull brown ofdying sod in late August and the endless white that measures a yard deep through most of the winter. But june at Notre Dame is dripping in a deep brilliant emerald green. 
The handful of people here be­tween the departure of the seniors and the arrival of the summer ses­sion students are housed in Lyons and Morrissey. Living in a traditional dorm on one ofthe oldest parts of campus makes one very much aware of the history that pervades NO. 
While the modern decor and com­forts ofthe PastJuerillas and the towers are convenient, there is a 
sense ofcharacter in the buildings 
next to the iake that is noticeably lacking on returning to th t e Tower Quad. 
Nature is very visible. The usual chipmunks, squirrels and birds are everywhere. Watching the growth of the new additions to the nearby Domer poultry community becomes a daily habit. And, unless you've spent a summer at Notre Dame, you've probably never seen the muskrats that populate the lakes. 
The things that alums romanticize on football weekends and the stu­dents ridicule the rest of the year don't seem so schmaltzy in summer. The campus is very conducive to relaxation and thought. Walks around the lake, a rarity during the year, become second nature. The Dome viewed from across the lake 
seems just the proper distance to 
put your life in perspective. 
It's a few weeks later, when the 
summersession students arrive, that 
you're reminded this is a learning in­
stitution. Even then, it's different. 
Classes are more light-hearted, stu­
dents and professors are more laid 
back. 

Warm sunny Saturdays, a rare gift 
during the year, are plentiful. Some­
how, though, Sundays are even bet­
ter. During the year, Sundays are 
hectic irksome reminders that \1on­
day looms just beyond the horizon. 
But a summerSunday at Notre Dame 
is the way Sundays were meant to 
be. 

Asummer under the Dome also 
means experiencing the assorted 
groups that meet at Notre Dame 
each year. The Charismatics, the 
sports camps, the l\1arriagc Encoun­
ter groups, the home show people, 
theJehova Witnesses all dwell on 
campus for part ofthe summer. For a 
week in july when the American 
Youth on Parade convenes here, you 
don't dare go outside without 
looking up to avoid an ill encounter 
with a stray baton. 
Alumni take on a whole new ap­
pearance in the summer. While chat­
ting with a grad experiencing his 
fiftieth year reunion, it really hits 
home how ephemeral four years 
here are. Lewis Hall is transformed 
into Alumni Family Hall, summer 
vacation spot for hundreds ofalum 
and their families. Listening for the thirtieth time to a middle-aged alum describing his carefree undergrad years in Lyons to his wide-eyed listening progeny cannot help hut 
leave one a changed person. 
The summer also means being on hand to guess where they're going to add the new sidewalks this year, to watch the Huddle decor move into the 'HOs and to forge new paths as a means ofavoiding the obstacle course created by the evening sprinklers. 
The best part ofa Notre Dame summer is that, for perhaps the first time, you grow to appreciate the place. So much ofour time here is spent cursing the administration, cussing the food and complaining about college life in general. But watching the bats circle the Dome on a clear summer evening orsitting on the bench next to Old College 
late on a sunny afternoon changes all that. Suddenly you find it doesn't matter that the Dome is closed off, the fish don't seem as voracious as before and somehow you know that winter will never return. Even the oppressive heat takes a back seat to other things. 
In the summer, keg rules don't 
matter, the food seems almost 
bearable and campus parking tickets 
go ignored. Even the transcripts that 
arrive in July listing you as a fresh­
man ROTC medieval history major 
seem laughable. For the first time, 
it's really enough just to look around 
and think to yourself~ hey. this place 
isn't so bad. 
In early August the summer ses­
sion students leave and the campus 
is once again deserted. For a few 
weeks the campus is your own again. 
The new sidewalks are dried, the 
summer ducklings are almost full­
grown and the sod is turning brown. 
Then the students start wandering 
back to campus, you relocate your­
selfin your regular dorm and things 
return to normal. The food is bad 
again and there's no more time for 
reflective walks around the lake'. 
Memories ofsummer get pushed to 
the back ofone's mind. 
But after a summer under the 
Dome, you never quite view the 
place in the same way as you did 
before. When your roommate starts 
another endless barrage of_Indiana 
jokes or complaints about a profes­
sor, the weather or the football 
team, you have to smile to yourself 
It's almost like knowing a secret. A 
summer at Notre Dame is a thing 
that most people never experience. 
The silver posts look the same and 
the people don't act any differently, 
but somehow you're different be­
cause you've seen the complete 
picture. 

For those concerned

naugurating its tllm serie~ tomorrow night, the Cen­ter for Social Concerns presenL~ "The Year of Living Dangero·usly." Don't let the gun on the campus publicity posters scare you. Although this is not an "Oftker and a Gentleman" type love story, it is most of­ten referred to as a romance. 
Mel Gibson ("(jallipoli" and "Road Warrior") and Fonda-like Sigourney Weaver ("Alien") sizzle in the romantic leads. Australian Peter Weir directs this tlick which springs from a setting ofpain and sufkring, an en­vironment of intense poverty: Jakarta, the capital of In­donesia, in 196S. 
During this year this beautiful eastern country could not conceal the poverty stricken conditions and distress of its people. It is in this year that Sukarno, the pre!->ident of Indonesia boldly speaks out as the voice of the Third World. lie openly proclaims Indonesia'!-> 
greatness in dellance ofthe whole western world. Con­sequently Sukarno captures the loyalty and adulation of his impoverished subjects. He insists that his people will witness in 196'; the climax of his presidency, the year ofconfrontation, a year he dubs "TheYear ofLiving Dangerously." 
This unlikely setting ofjakarta's seething streets and slums provides the backdrop for the tllm's main attrac­tion: the romance between (juy Hamilton. an ambitious Australian journalist, and Jill Bryant. an attache to the British embassy. 
Besides the romantic aspect~ oftl:e tllm. this tllm also addresses a question posed over a hundred years ago by one man obsessed with the eternal dilemma ofpoverl)·, Leo Tolstoy, "What then must we do'" 
·~·Ar'l'entertaining introduction to the Social Concerns Film Series, "The Year of Living Dangerously" can be viewed Tuesday and Wedne~day nights in the Engineer­ing Auditorium. The projector will start rolling at~ and 9:.)0 and admission is s I. 

S11rvival of the Fittest 
by Marc Ramirez 

'y,rell, two years have passed, and I'm still here. 
'W And Heaven help me. so are they. 
They were here before I came, and they will continue to be here long after I am gone. No, not even mQving to a different tloor, not to mention different section, of Howard succeeded in outsmarting them. They're still after me, and l struggle to get to sleep at night, be­cause although their silence leads one to question their presence, I know that they are there, waiting, just waiting ... 
"Yo, Lenny, you still behind me, or what?" 
"Yeah, yeah, Bubba, I'm right here." 
"Well, come on, then. We don't have all night, you know." 
The two of them ran out of their hiding place, as quietly and 
cautiously as possible. Bubha's keen senses told him where they 
should go. 
"To the bed, Lenny! Let's go!" 
"But wait! What ifhe wakes up?" 
"lie won't, you idiot, not as long as we're careful! You weren't kid­ding about this being your tlrst run, were you?" 
Bllbb~ trekked down the wall with incredible speed t{>r his size, and felt disappointment with himself for bringing Lenny along. Dumb rookies, he thought, panic at any little noise or movement. I shoulda stayed back East. 
With Lenny on his tail, Bubha realized that there were more im­portant things on his mind. Food, for instance. They scurried across the shag carpet and crawled up the bed. 
"Ah," said Bubha as he reached the summit where the person lay sleeping, "just as I thought. Cheese and crackers." "Jl'm scared," whimpered Lenny. "I mean, so close to him and all ­what if he wakes up?" 
"Lenny, you're a Hoosier insect as sure as my name's Bubba 
Boldroach! Ain't you got any guts? Not as tough as us Philadelphia 
roaches, I guess." 
Bubba began feasting on cracker crumbs that had been scattered 
car•elessly the evening betore at the f(>ot ofthe bed. Lenny hesitantly 
joined him. 
After the crackers were gone, they moved on to the bits ofcheese 
farther up the bed. Bubba was a big eater, being more than twice as 
big as Lenny, who was just under an inch long. He had been reared in 
the Philly sewers; he was streetwise and experienced. · 
"Bubba," said Lenny as he burped, "did you ever lose any friends on one ofthese forays?" 
"Yeah, last week, in fact," Bubba answered. Lenny nearly choked on his cheese. "Yeah, ol' buddy Ralphie. We was over in room 417, looking t<>r apple pie, when all ofa sudden the door bursts open and thb guy comes in, raging mad. Ralphie and I made a break for the hole under the sink, but that dude grabbed one of his Nikes and 'airr:ed foflta{pnie.'Last 'thing I remember was diving into that hole 
and hearing a splatter on the wall. lt was bad news. man." 
Bubba saw Lenny's ne-rvousness and added, ''I'm gonna have to 
show you the tricks, Lenny. Like pretending you're dead, and 
disappearing the moment they turn around to grab something to 
smash youse with. And then, ofcourse, you'll naturally mutate a little 
to blend in with the carpet in the hallway. And then I'll show -Len­
ny. get away from there!" 
Lenny had scampered onto the person's knee in order to munch 
on the cracker crumb that had stuck there, and it was too late. The 
leg twitched, then kicked, and Lenny tlew off, stunned. 
"Run!" yelled Bubba. "C'mon! Under the door!" 
They're out there. But I'll show them. I got one ofthem last night, 
in fact. 
The little sucker was crawling on my leg when I woke up, and he 
bolted tor the door when I flicked on the light. As I jumped out of 
bed I saw another one, as big as my thumb, almost as large as the 
door. Picking up .the latest issue of.Sportsillustrated, Iwent for the 
small one. 
'"Bubba, wait for me!" cried Lenny as he tumbled over the edge of 
the bed and onto the carpet. 
Bubha turned and saw the person with the magazine raised high in 
the air, ready to strike. He looked at Lenny. confused and frightened. 
and estimated Lenny's chances. 
Sorry, Lenny, Bubba thought, and he darted under the door. 
Darn roaches, I thought as I smashed the Nebraska Cornhuskers 
down on the carpet with most of my might. I stepped on the 
magazine and ground it into the tloor viciously. 
!looked under it at last and smiled. It was dead, all right. The big one was gone and out of my room. l\1ission accomplished. Disgusting things. 
''Let this be an example to you all!" I bellowed, pointing at my vic­tim's remains. But they'd be back. I knew it. 
"Okay, Person. You got him. You got dumb ol' Lenny. But you still have me to deal with, and there's thousands more where I came from. You can kill us, but we'll just keep on coming. We were here before you, and we'll be here long after you're gone. because after all, weare the most genetically perfect creatures ever tc exist on this earth. We'll always he here, Person. You remember tltat. 
We'llatwavs be here."
