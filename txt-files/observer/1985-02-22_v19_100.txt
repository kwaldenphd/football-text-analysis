Yarbrough convicted of firing at FBI agents 
Associated Press 
BOISE, Idaho -Avowed white supremacist Gary Lee Yarbrough, who admitted he was a "frontline Aryan warrior," was convicted yes­terday of assault for firing a gun at three FBI agents. 
The U.S. District Court jury deliberated about five hours before returning the guilty verdict. 
Yarbrough had testified he never intended to harm the agents when he fired a .45-caliber handgun in their direction on Oct. 18 and he said he was trying to "get their atten­tion" because the men failed to ac­knowledge his shouts. 
He was the last witness before the jury began deliberations. The jurors were urged by Yarbrough's attorney to ignore the defendant's character and views and decide only whether an assault took place. 
"You're not trying to determine if he's a good guy or a bad guy," defen.se· attorney James Kaufman said. 
FBI agent Michael Johnston tes­tified Wednesday that Yarbrough shot directly at the officers, who were dressed in jeans and flannel shirts and were riding in a borrowed 
U.S. Forest Service pickup truck on Yarbrough's driveway. 
Yarbrough, who has been linked to the june 18, 1984, slaying of Den­ver talk show host Alan Berg, also testified he didn't know the three men were FBI agents. 
"I figured they couldn't read," said Yarbrough, explaining the truck had to pass at least three "no trespass­ing" signs. 
Yarbrough said he ran to a door and "yelled at them as loud as I could" trying to get them to stop. The pickup truck drove over a log Yarbrough had put across his driveway past the house, he said. 
After the truck left Yarbrough's property and turned onto a road, Yarbrough said he tried to catch up to the pickup by cutting through the wooded area behind his home. He said he fired a .45-caliber semi­automatic handgun while aiming at least 1 5 feet over the pickup truck "to get their attention." 
He was standing about 35 to 40 yards away from the pickup truck, agents said. No one was injured. 
Yarbrough, who said he practices shooting targets · at least once a week, testified t.hat he can "easily" hit a one-foot diameter target with a .45-caliber automatic from 50 yards away four out offive times. 
Eldon Cutler, a member of the white supremacist Church of Jesus Christ Christian, or Aryan Nations, said he had been target shooting with Yarbrough and said a pickup truck moving at 1 5-20 mph would have been "almost like a standing target." 
Yarbrough said he left the Ayran Nations several years ago and was renting the rural Sanpoint home un­der an assumed name because he didn't want people to know of his past affiliation with the neo-Nazi Whidbey Island, Wash., house fire group. He also said he served a after a stand-off with authorities. prison sentence in Arizona tur bur­

J-Board bars public from next assembly

The March 12 Judicial Council meeting will be closed to students and The Observer, Judicial Coordin­ator Tim McDowell announced at last night's council meeting. 
According to McDowell, the Judi­cial Council will discuss how hall rectors are handling the judicial functions of their respective halls. He feels ifboth outside students and The Observer are excluded from the meeting, then hall commissioners I will be able to discuss the issues in­volved freely. 1 
"1 don't want (the hall commis­

sioners) afraid of telling the truth. I 
j
want honest things coming up," he said. "I don't have anything against The Observer. but I don't want (the

hall commissioners)worrying about being misquoted." 
McDowell says hall rectors may 1 not be informing students accused ofhall offenses ofall of their rights. 
"If you commit a hall offense, 
lyou're supposed to have a choice be­
i
tween having your case heard by your hall's judicial board or your rector unless it is a very sensitive case. I'm not sure if the rectors are telling students that they have a choice," McDowell said. 
McDowell also plans to discuss how the hall judicial boards are operating. According to McDowell, "We have to find out how the judi­cial boards are performing their role as working judicial units of the Uni­versity. The only way to find out if the judicial boards are working ef­fectively is to find out what's actu­ally happening." 
Also brought up at last night's meeting was the apparent apathy of some hall commissioners to their re­sponsibilities as commissioners.

ND tax-help program continues 
ByCATIIYANN REYNOlDS 
StaffReporter 
The Notre Dame tax assistance program will again prepare income tax forms for members ofthe South Bend community this spring after preparing 1,837 single-family returns last year. 
Refunds from forms prepared last year netted more than $244,000 in refunds, according to Liz Carroll, public relations director of the program for the past two years. 
The program, in its 14th year, is run by senior ac­counting majors at Notre Dame. It has gained more support from accounting alumni in recent years, said Ken Milani, faculty coordinator. 
The Notre Dame program has its own training program and record keeping, but the Internal Reve­nue Service provides the forms and the Volunteer Income Tax Accountants safeguards the legal aspects. 
Some accountants in the program are alumni con­tilling to serve the South Bend residents filing tax returns. 
A certified public accountant and alumnus from Price Waterhouse in Chicago, Dave O'Brien, has come back to South Bend to volunteer for the pro­gram. 
When asked about legal problems and responsi­bilities, Milani said the IRS may call the program about a person's file, but the program is protected by VITA, and not legally responsible. 
While following "normal procedure," said Milani, the IRS can call the customer for details and lets the volunteer program know when the problem is re­solved. 
Besides South Bend residents, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's workers/groundskeepers, housekeepers, and kitchen help have in recent years been assisted by student and CPA volunteers. 
Carroll said Notre Dame's tax program offers assis­tance at " 1 0 different locations in South Bend set up in public buildings, like church halls, and libraries so that service is available at least three hours a week at various shifts." 
"Two groups of students volunteer at shut-ins," said Carroll, "when people can't get to a center." 
Notre Dame's volunteers are available at the Cen­ter for Social Concerns from 2:30 to 5 p.m. on Wed­nesdays, or by phone at 239-5296.

Getting there is half the fun if you can figure out the password 
Ever wonder why the grass is so green around the guardhouses at Notre Dame? Perhaps it has something to do with the bull spread around there by students trying to drive on campus. 
It seems getting past the gate guard truly has become the great Domer drivers' pastime. 
In terms of size, the battle is a mismatch. More than 1,000 registered cars form the backbone of the assault force, armed to the teeth with the latest excuses, the most modern pleas. And on the defense are two mere defenders of the pedestrian campus, veritable Custers in a sea a four-wheeled Indians. 
But all the Fords, Chevys and Hondas are no match for security's trump card: the little switch that raises the gate. If the gate isn't raised, even the most prestigious automobile can go down in flaming defeat, having to back up in embarrassing retreat. 

Officers with Notre Dame security take this immense responsibility in stride · all in a day's work sort ofstuff. But they know that every car they don't let on is one more 
car they won't have to tow burgh. out of a fire lane or out of "I want to go to church." 
some rector's parking spot · ticketing it first, of course. Who can blame them? Few things provoke as heated an outcry as a pilfered parking space. 
"It would be nice if we could let a kid in on his honor, but it's sad we can't do it that way. That's why we have to have a lot of rules," says William Krill, a shift commander and a 13-year veteran with the depart· ment. 
"We do bend the rules a lot with that pass, and under certain circumstances we try to help students out as much as we can," says Krill. 
"Yeah," you're saying to yourself. These guys might act like Boy Scouts in the office, but get one ofthem in a gate house and he becomes a modern-day troll. Or so it seems. 
Officers admit the chances ofgetting a car on campus vary with the person on duty, how many cars are already on, the time of day and probably what side of the bed the officer got out of. 
But examine for a moment what these dedicated men and women and blue must tolerate: clueless tourists, demanding faculty, rowdy and often tipsy students...on normal days. What happens when officers refuse to let student on? "Some get furious and squeal their tires or cuss you out. Or they throw something at you," says Ken Cooper, a 2-year officer. 
Said another officer, "The athletes are the worst ones of all. They think they have some sort of special

priviledge because they play on a team around here." "Let 'em walk," he says, "They need the exercise." But, to be fair, any driver's commitment to a Walden· 
like campus usually evaporates under the pressure of rain, snow, cold or a beer or two. Realizing one ofthese conditions will be in effect 90 percent of the time, one should have a strategy ready. 
To see what works, why not ask the the judges them­selves? The Security Department certainly has heard them all. Here's what has been tried (and failed): 
''I'm a brother in Corby Hall." And I'm Father Hes­


At 2 a.m.? 
"I 
need to pick up my trombone." You can carry it. 

"I 
have to drop off some things for a party." How 'bout that Alcohol Policy. 


In general, the best advice is to tell the truth. Says one officer, "If a student is honest to me, I'll let him on, but ifhe tries to B.S. his way through, I won't." 
But, let's face it, no secur­ity guard will let someone on who admits, "I'm lazy and don't want to walk." This is where creativity comes in. 

According to one officer, ifyou can't be honest, be crea­tive. 
Try keeping a spare crutch in your car. Or large boxes in your trunk. Or ifyou always dress nicely, say you are picking up your date for a formal. Many sources indicate that girls, in general, have an easier time than the guys do. 
But don't crash the gate or go in on the wrong side. The security folks say thay don't like to play Starsky and Hutch, but they didn't order V-8s in those blue Chrys­lers for nothing. Also, a new gate costs Jl7. 
In sum, give it your best legitimate shot. But ifyou get on campus, avoid parking in front ofdumpsters or in the middle of the quad. Security says it will begin ticketing with a vengence if the problems continue. Or as one officer told me, "Once it starts warming up, we're really going to start pounding the hell out of these students." Perhaps getting by the gate is only half the battle after all.

Icy sidewalks produced by weather are a probletn for students, faculty 
By MARTIN RODGERS 
StaffReporter 
Epileptic movements. A blood­curdling howl or scream. A loud thud. Laughter. Embarrassment. Pain. 
Just when everyone thought it was safe -and warm enough -to go to classes, the problem of icy sidewalks, a product of last week's heavy snowfalls and the subsequent warming trend, can now be a daily pitfall for students, faculty, staff, and maintenance alike. 
"I fell today outside of Washing­
ton Hall on my way to class," said 
Laurie Chu, a Farley freshman. "It 
was embarrassing. I'm from Hawaii 
and this ice thing is a new, painful 
experience. 
"Why don't they do something? 
One week it snowed hard every day 
and they never plowed. It was slip­
pery and the paths were so narrow. 
It's dangerous," Chu said. 
Physical Plant Director Don 
Dedrick is aware ofthe problem and 
the complaints it prompts. He 
assures that his he and his crews will

continue to "struggle against the forces ofnature" this winter. 
Dedrick says the primary problem is when the severity of the weather is continuous as it was last week. It was "very hard to keep up," he said. 
He also said the extreme cold prevented sodium chloride from working. Sodium chloride is only ef­fective when the temperature is be­tween 20 and 2 5 degrees, he said. Dedrick added plow blades do not clean all the way down to the surface of the sidewalks and that they leave approximately four inches of snow on the ground which develops into ice. 
Finally, Dedrick emphasized the task is a tough one -Notre Dame has approximately eight miles of sidewalks -and that his crews are doing the best job they can. Much of the staff, for instance, worked ap­proximately 16 hours a day la"t. week. 
The problem is similar at Saint Mary's. "Why don't they just pour water all over and let us (ice) skate to class?" said Megan Comstock, a Holy Cross sophomore. "I don't know how many times I've fallen. I'm going to kill myself one ofthese days." 
A potential problem is ifsomeone would injure himself and decides to sue. Notre Dame Counsel Philip Fac­cenda stated, however, he could not recall any such suit in recent years. Such a suit, said Faccenda, would have to be one of "personal injury due to negligence." He noted one could sue the University for anyth­ing, even a common head cold, but would not be likely to collect. 
The city of South Bend similarly has had to deal with unclean streets. The city is not accountable for cleaning the sidewalks, however, having delegated that responsibility to private property owners, said a representative of the South Bend streets department. 
"I've tried every shoe, sneaker, and boot on the market to get me across campus safely," Fisher junior Skip Holtz said of the frozen precipitation on the walkways. "I've come to the conclusion that I'm going to have to order a pair of Bat(man) boots from the Hall of Justice. JPW was great but would have been a lot better ifI didn't have to carry a chisel around to get my mom's heels out ofthe ice. 
"You should have seen the guy I saw coming out of Dillon the other day. His head and feet decided to change places and then he was just laying there. He was one hurtin' cowboy."

Five hundred students at Saint Mary's have signed up to participate In the Wednesday Lunch Fast which began on Ash Wednesday. Three dollars per student participating in the Fast will be donated to charities by SAGA food services, said Anne Gallagher, co-chairwoman of the program. Colleen Flynn also chairs the program. 
Gallagher pointed out, however, that the actual number of students participating may be closer to 300.

Bangladesh, a women's craft cooperative. Locally, proceeds also have gone to the Justice and Peace 
Center in South Bend. Possible charities this year include Africa and variousemergencyreliefcenters. 
Gallagher described the fast as a "conscience builder." Said Gallag­her, "At Notre Dame, the Hunger Coalition holds a Wednesday Lunch Fast throughout the year. Over here people were beginning to forget 
why they were fasting." Gallagher says having the Fast during Lent is more "conscience-raising." 


Farm aid deal terminates filibuster 
WASHINGTON-The Reagan ad­ministration reached an apparent agreement yesterday with filibuster­Ing farm-state senators who agreed to a package offering slight improve­ments in federal credit aid for farm­ers. 
"I think we've got an agreement if the (Democratic) caucus agrees," said Sen. ). James Exon, D-Neb., a leader of the filibuster that had held up confirmation of Edwin Meese Ill as attorney general and a S7 billion highway bill. 
The tentative settlement came after a full day of meetings involving the Senate Republican leadership, Democratic and GOP farm-state senators and Agriculture Secretary John Block. 
Participants said the improve­ments included written assurance that the administration will provide adequate money for both direct and guaranteed farm operating loans, money that would be used for spring planting. Such assurances have been given repeatedly and publicly by Agriculture Secretary John Block over the past several weeks. 
Also agreed to was a softening of conditions farmers must meet to receive federal loan guarantees ­specifically in the cash flow they must show after payment of loan obligations and living and operating expenses. That level was reduced from the I I 0 percent in the current administration program to 100 per­cent. 
Another provision agreed to was an increase in levels of loan guaran­tees to farm banks. Rural lenders, many of them suffering from the worsening financial condition of their borrowers, had sought to mini­mize their risk through federal back­ing. The negotiations produced agreement to raise the level of federal guarantee by 5 percent each year, up to a maximum of 90 per­cent.

"We only get money from SAGA for 
the people that keep the Fast. The final answer as to the amount of money that will be made lies in the number ofpeople that keep the Fast for the five weeks ofLent," she said. 
Sign-ups for the fast took place from Monday through Wednesday last week. Although sign-ups are over now, Gallagher commented, "It would have been nice if more people had signed up, but it's their own choice."

Iowa State University farm econo­mist Neil Harl, who has been a leading analyst of the extent offarm­ers' current credit woes, said the ad­ministration's already announced credit relief program would have helped about 50,000 to 60,000 of the 240,000 producers nationwide in financial stress. 
The changes extracted by the filibustering group will extend that aid to another I0,000 troubled farm­ers, Harl said.

Indiana University students calling for resignation of WilliaiD Bennett 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -Indiana University students have sent a message to President Reagan calling for the resignation of U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett, a student organization announced yesterday. 
The Indiana University Student Association approved a resolution calling for Bennett's resignation in reaction to a statement the secretary made last week. 
Bennett was quoted as saying Reagan's proposed financial aid cuts for higher education "may require of some student divestiture of certain sorts · stereo divestiture, automo­bile divestiture, three weeks at the beach divestiture." 
The students' resolution urged Reagan to "carefully select a strong advocate of higher education to serve as a replacement for Mr. Ben­nett." 
"I don't expect the resolution to influence whether or not Reagan asks Bennett to resign," said the sponsor of the resolution, senior Chris Salloway. 
"But I think it will make Reagan examine Bennett's statements, his philosophy and his role as secretary of education. We are the first stu· dent body to address this issue, and if our strategy works, there should be a snowball effect," Salloway added at a news conference yester­day. 
Ron Rawald, a junior and presi­dent of the student organization, said letters with a copy ofthe resolu­tion were sent to Reagan and Ben­nett on Monday. 
No response has been made by either Washington official, he said. 
Rawald said letters and copies of the resolution were also sent to 65 Indiana colleges and universities, as well as all Big Ten Conference schools.

peal the verdicts, reached after about four hours ofdeliberation. 
Elder, 41, who directs the Roman Catholic Church-sponsored Casa Oscar Romero shelter in San Benito, near the Mexican border, said his conviction on five charges would not deter him from his activities. 
"I'm proud that I am following the best traditions of my faith and our country," Elder said. 
Merkt, 30, was found guilty on one count of conspiracy but inno­cent of two counts of tranporting two Salvadoran aliens. 
"I don't know whether to cryor to yell about the injustices both here and there," Merkt said, referring to El Salvador. "I believe it is time to yell. I will persevere." 
Sanctuary activists say they are helping refugees on the premise that international and U.S. laws, includ­ing the 1980 Refugee Act, grant legal asylum to refugees who are fleeing political persecution and violence. 
Elder could be fined up to S28,000 and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Merkt faces a maximum five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. U.S. districtJudge Filemon Vela set sentencing for March 27. 
Merkt already is on two years' probation for a similar conviction in May and could lose her probation pending the outcome ofa March 15 hearing in Brownsville. 
"I was grateful," assistant U.S. at­torney Robert Guerra said. "We only try people that we believe we have a good case against." 
Merkt, a volunteer at the shelter, was accused of taking the aliens from the shelter to a McAllen bus station on Nov. 21. 
Elder was charged with two counts ofconspiracy and two counts ofhelping two Salvadorans enter the United States illegally. He also was accused of driving two aliens on Nov. 8 from the U.S.-Mexican border to the shelter. 
He was acquitted last month on charges of transporting three Sal­vadorans in March 1984. 
One of the Salvadorans in the latest case, Jose Andreas Mendez­Valle, identified Elder and Merkt as the Americans who helped him and four other aliens after they crossed the U.S.-Mexican border. Another Salvadoran with him, however, could not identify the defendants.

In McDowell's opinion, many commissioners did not know what duties were expected from them when they were appointed by their hall presidents. He felt a lack ofcom­munication was responsible, but was uncertain who was to blame. 
"We don't know where the prob­lem lies. We need to find out exactly where the communication gap is oc­curring for the new commissioners so that they know their responsibili­ties and duties as members of the council next year," he said.

Later in the meeting McDowell announced the possibility of creat­ing a position on the Judicial Coun­cil for an off-campus student. The off-campus representative would have full voting rights on the coun­cil. 
"What I want to create is a posi­tion where the off-campus student could be represented in a voting capacity on the judicial body," he said. "Should an off-campus student be accused of a University offense, they have a right to know about the judicial process and their judicial rights, which the Judicial Council promotes." 
Also announced at last night's meeting were the dates for the up­coming class elections. They will be held March 5, and if necessary, run­offs will be held March 7.

Authenticity originates 
with moral consistency 
Human being.-; are natural organizers. We seem to automatically seek consistency in our experience and beliefs and, at times, invent consistency where none exists. Nowhere is this tendency more prevalent than in our most serious moral considerations. This ten-
Charles Boudreaux only solitaire 
dency towards "surface consistency" often leads to betraying the life principle from which those tenets arose. 
The most serious moral question, one might claim. are the ethics concerning human life and death. The secular humanist believes in the innate worth of each human being. Those holding religious belief believe in ser­vice to all "neighbors;" that is, the world's population. 
To point out the dangers of surface consis­tency, let us use as example the individual who maintains abortion to be wrong under all circumstances. A person who arrives at this decision necessarily believes the fetus to be either a human life at conception or so sure to be one that it should enjoy the same rights as any other human being, most importantly, the right to live. 
'Iltis decision entails holding as fundamen­tal that human life is unequivocably prized and/or sacred, depending upon one's founda­tion In humanism and/or religion. 
What are the ramifications of this belief? In keeping with human nature, one would want a stronger position by applying his or her beliefs on the preservation of life to areas other than abortion. Examples would lead to possibly new beliefs that war and capital punishment are wrong. 
If we continue to generalize, we will find ourselves face-to-face with some nasty conse­quences. 
A belief that all life is to be preserved rapidly brings the believer to two serious so­cial problems. The first is the problem ofover­population and starvation in underdeveloped nations. 
Admittedly, two possible "outs" exist. The food supply could be increased through bet­ter cultivation or provisions from more developed nations. Birth .control, whether natural or artificial, could be introduced. The first solution sounds good, but the West does not seem to show a concerted response unless an Ethiopia-sized develpos. If the "preciousness of life" opinion-holder accepts birth control, he or she is forced to accept the notion that fecundity is not always a good thing, a challenge to that person's consis­tency. 
The second problem is perhaps the more morally difficult. With the continual develop­
ment of artificial organs and other forms of 
medical technology. it will not be long until 
we can create the "human superman," the in­
dividual who can be sustained indefinitely on 
life-support devices. The moral quandary 
arises when the "superman" decides that he 
no longer wants to live, thereby begging the 
question ofthe right to die or the "living will." 
The individual who believes absolutely in the 
sanctity of life-and many doctors are in this 
category-would want to sustain the individ­
ual's life at the expense ofhis or her free will. 
This sort of moral morass is just where the 
consistent moral tenet falls short of a true 
morality. We seem to have secured quantity of 
life rather than quality, a position which 
seems to miss the point of both the religious 
and the humanist messages. Underlying the 
tenet of "absolute preservation of life" must 
be a deeper meaning. What is life? Heartbeat? 
Happiness? This answer, the true tenet 
beneath the surface statement ofour morality, 
may be much harder to discover than the 
seemingly consistent statement "preservation 
oflife." 

How, then, are we to decide between the 
human, the inhuman, and the humane? We 
seem to be left with two undesirable alterna­
tives. We could hold on to our sample policy 
of "life first"; while consistent, this sort of 
policy seems to miss the underlying moral 
principle from which it was derived. Instead, 
we could have a policy which is inconsistent; 
while not risking the danger of "surface con­
sistency," each of our individual moral posi­
tions would be weakened because of the lack 
ofconsistency across our ethical spectrum. 
It seems that our only way out is a mongrel 
blend of these two alternatives. We need to 
ask ourselves where our consistency should 
lie: should it rest, for example, on the surface 
of the word "life" or on the underlying 
meaning ofthat word in terms ofour true fun­
damental moral belief? I believe we must be 
consistent to our fundamental belief or life 
principle, not consistent from particular tenet 
to particular tenet. This mixture, of course, 
has its own drawbacks. Without a policy that 
features surface consistency, one must look 
much deeper for moral answers that are in 
turn much more difficult to come by than 
before. 

Is my proposal that ofa variable morality? It 
may appear so to some. I do not claim to have 
proposed any answers or made any judgments 
on the sample moral problems I mentioned. 
What I propose is consistency in terms of 
one's central moral belief is the only consis­
tency which allows one to be authentic. Ifwe 
really look to see where we want to place our consistency, we can center our beliefs on , moral bedrock, not on "surface consistency."

Reagan has complicated 
aid to troubled farmers 
David Stockman is right about farm sub­sidies, and so are his critics. This is a compl­icated matter that Ronald Reagan has tangled into even tighter knots. 
Campaigning, Reagan could not define "parity," but he was for or against it in differ­ing time zones. He has a long record ofsaying 
Garry Wills 
outrider 

that agriculture should return to a market basis, but in 1982, his second year in office, farm subsidies ran three times what they had been in Jimmy Carter's last official year ( $12 billion, against $4 billion). In fact, before Reagan took office, the subsidies had never gone above S6 billion. 
Reagan managed to combine this largesse with a heavy rate offarm closures, which is in itselfno mystery -most farm aid goes to large­scale farmers. Only to the marginal was this aid not, marginally, enough. 
The best argument against Stockman is in terms of timing. The government has ex­tended just enough aid to help those smaller farmers expand, and now a credit cutoff will make them lose even their original holdings. 
Since there is always an answer to every an­swer in this merry-go-round world, Stockman might reply: There is no good time to cut a failing program -each moment you challenge it can be presented as especially inopportune, and the longer you put off the difficult deci­sion, the worse does everything become (including the matter of timing). 
But Stockman's boss must bear a good deal 

Fighting and backbiting 
hurts our government 
Editor's Note: Because ofa production er­ror john Perez's column appeared incor­rectly in theFeb. 14 issue ofThe Observer. It is reprinted here in itsproperfonn. 
By now, everyone is sick to death of the Great Notre Dame Election Scandal of 198S. For those of you who were hiding under a rock for the past week or so and didn't hear about it, I'll briefly reiterate the story, hope­fully for the last time. It seems that one SBP/SBVP ticket committed several infrac-

tions ofcampaigning rules, was caught, had its candidacy withdrawn, and ultimately had its candidacy reinstated. In the process, a whole bunch of "important and influential" people connected with the electoral process and stu­dent government resigned. Space limitations preclude my providing the scorecard neces­sary to keep track of who did what and to whom on this merry-go-round. 
In the aftermath of this mini-Watergate (Domergaten one must wonder not only what the role ofstudent government at Notre Dame is, but who is "student government". The Student Senate? The Ombudsman? The Hall President's Council? 
A couple of days ago, I asked roughly a dozen of my friends who the student body president was. Only three replied "Rob Ber­tino." None of them had any idea who their student senator was. A few could describe OBUD's functions. Most had an idea of what the HPC was. My point is: If these bodies are such a vital part of our community and sup­posedly play a major role in student affairs, why don't we hear or know more about them? Are they really fulfilling the needs of the typi­cal student, or are they just a source of nifty­of the blame for the truly extraordinary crisis that farmers are facing. Reagan's record deficit is keeping interest rates high, making farm loans unpayable. while it keeps the dollar high, making exported food unsellable to many customers. 
High as interest rates are in general, they have been running three or four percentage points higher for farmers -precisely because farms have become a bad risk, and banks that do agricultural business are themselves at risk. 
Even Reagan's great achievement -the taming of inflation through a recession that had us at I I percent unemployment in his first term -has hurt farmers, bringing down the in­flated value of their assets while their interest payments were going up. 
There is no clean solution -the mythical market will never be restored. But the myths of parity must die, and as much government aid as can be cut without massive bank col­lapses must be cut. The main thing is to dis­criminate in f~ vor ofthe smaller farms -which is exactly the opposite of Reagan's approach 
. to everything else. His first term set records in the closing of small businesses. His second term is already beginning to set records in the closing of small farms. The friend of "enterprise" is really a friend of bigness; of trickle-down, as Stockman admitted in an­other context; and there is not enough, in Reagan's vaunted time ofprosperity, to trickle as far down as he is driving the lower ranks of our society.

who admitted their guilt. It strippul thcm ol 
their candidacy. A job well done. 
Then the Student Senate steped in. ll oH:r· turned OBUD's decision and restored the guilty parties to the ballot. Why? -we don't know. The decision was made in secret, and no explanations were offered. Is this a job well done? 
Ultimately, an ad hoc election committee ran the elections, accomplishing what usually takes months to organize in a mere two days. The elections were conducted without inci­dent. However, all is stil not well. 
The problem is obvious: nobody really knows who is responsible for what. Egos take precedence over rules. Our "leadership" has no direction. A policy of"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" just will not work. The people with the most potential power and in­fluence are least in touch with the student body as a whole. The election fiasco was merely a symptom of this disarray in general. 
Despite the good intentions of many, our present system ofstudent leadership is a joke. It is a very bad joke. Like any bad joke, it reflects as poorly upon the perpetrator as the victim. We have the people and ideas to make our community truly great, we only need a push in the right direction. Better organiza­tion and communication is that push. 
The campus leadershipmust realize that in­fighting and backbiting will get them, and us, nowhere. Goals and objectives must be set. Strategies and programs to achieve these goals must be implemented, maintained, and reviewed. Responsibilities must be assigned, and the various governmental bodies must respect each others' duties and decisions. Most importantly, they must remember whom they represent -the students. Closed door meetings and secret ballots are tools of dictators, not legislators. We have a right to know what's going on and why. Isn't getting fair representation what elections are all

P.O. Box Q 
Pettifer's commentary riddled with feminism 
DearEditor: 
Ann Pettifer once again has indulged 
Observer readers with one ofher pathetically 
misinformed commentaries riddled with the 
belligerent feminism that has become her 
trademark. In her most recent article she has 
warned the sophomore class of the dangers 
involved in their asking Pope John Paul II to 
speak at their commencement. 
She makes atrocious insinuations concern­
ingJohn Paul's intentions. Pettifer accuses the 
pope of being unjust in his dealing with 
church theologians. She sees his silencing 
men such as Hans Kung as being threatening 
to academic freedom. She states, "The class of 
'87 must ask itself whether a man who would 
suppress the findings of an academic inquiry 
belongs at a university commencement." If 
the findings of an intrinsically subjective 
report are in contrast with the church's teach­
ing,John Paul II has every right and, in fact, the 
duty to denounce them. Especially if the 
report is misrepresented as the church's 
stance. 
The most blatant perversion of reason of 
which Pettifer is guilty is her manipulation of 
Schillebeeckx's writings concerning the early 
church. She alludes to the difference between 
the role of the priesthood in today's church 
and the early church. What is your point Pet­
titer? Of course the roles were different. Are 
you implying that the early church was per­
fect? If you would bother reading the New 
Testament past the Gospels you would find 
hundreds of examples of the problems that 
riddled the early church, however, the early 
church should consider itself lucky for not 
having to contend with these heresies being 
published in campus newspapers. 
Pettifer sees the pope as a despotic ruler on 
an inquisitional church. Any astute reader can 
plainly see that Pettifer's zealous feminism 
clouds her judgment of the pope. In all her 
whining one can see she glides over a very 
important fact. When Christ chose his 
apostles -apostles to which he would intrust 
the job of spreading his word -he chose 
twelve men. Oh, no. MaybeJesus Christ was a 
male chauvinist. Just because the church has 
delegated certain jobs to a certain sex does 
not mean that women are incapable offull par­
ticipation in the life ofthe church. To say they 
are is an affront to women such as Teresa of 
Avila, Catherine of Sienna, Mary of Magdala, 
and the Blessed Virgin Mary. 
Paul Douglas Morrissey Hall 
A mature person is one who has an open mind 
DearEditor: 
This letter is written in response to the Feb. 18 Viewpoint guest column by Ann Pettifer. Pettifer raises some points concerning the re­quest by the sophomore class representatives to have Pope John Paul II speak at their class commencement. In her column, Pettifer argues that the pope would be the wrong per­son to speak at the commencement. 
She begins her arS~;ument by stating that the pope is from a long line of "lousy popes." Whether or not this statement is biased, ex­tremist or incorrect is not relevant to any argument against this pope being invited to speak. If President Reagan wished to speak at commencement, we would not cite the exam­ples of earlier presidents against him. Presi­dent Reagan would certainly not be turned down because Thomas Jefferson was a male chauvinist slave owner, Franklin Pierce was a drunkard and Nixon was a crook. The faults of these past presidents have no bearing on whe­ther or not Reagan would be a good speaker or is a good president. Likewise, the example of past popes has no relevance to any argument against our present pope. 
Pettifer continues by attempting to present the pope as an unjust figure. She writes that we should be revolted at the trial of the "scholarly Dutch Dominican Edward Schil­lebeeckx." According to Pettifer the Vatican has been "hounding" this liberal theologian due to his view that, in the absence ofa priest, a community should celebrate Eucharist with a person of either sex presiding, even if he or she has to be ordained, post haste. 
It is true that the Vatican does disagree with Schillebeeckx on this point, which comes more from his scholarly view of the early church, by the way, then from an advocacy of changing present policy. This is, however, not the primary reason that he has come to the attention of the Vatican. The major problem concerning Schillebeeckx is that he sometimes appears to question the divinity of Christ. As a Dominican priest and a widely read Catholic theologian, it is not surprising that the Vatican should ask for an explanation of his ideas when they conflict with the tradi­tional views of the Church. This is not a new thing for Schillebeeckx. His writings have brought him before the Vatican several times in the past. After his explanations, he has remained, at least at present, a Catholic theo­logian in good standing. 
Pettifer continues her argument by claim­ing that, because ofthe Pope's attitude toward the ERA and his opposition to women in the priesthood, he would not be a good speaker. Not wishing to get anyone up in arms, 1 will neither support nor argue against the pope's stance. However, I do not think that his stance is relevant to whether or not he would be a good speaker. Pope John Paul II is powerful, influential religious and political leader in the present world. Whether or not we agree with him on all things, he is certainly a man worth listening to. After all, if we only listen to people that we agree with, wewill not learn or grow. 
Pettiferclosed her column by stating that "a mature Catholic is a Christian who sees con­version as an ongoing process." I end my let­ter by stating that a mature person is one who listens with an open mind.

Chance to vote on SBP could have been denied 
DearEditor: 

I would like to address two issues, as stu­

dent body treasurer and as a member of the Student Senate. In Wednesday's "Inside" column, Tom Mowle proposed the abolishment of the Stu­
dent Senate. As mentioned in his news analy­sis, a function performed by the senate is to set the budget for student campus organizations. This consists of 80 percent of the student ac­tivities fee or $210,000. A solution, according to Mowle, would be for the administration to set the budget; the administration has no say, presently, in the allocations of the student ac­tivities fee. 
A student activities fee is a fee paid by the students to be used explicitly for the students, according to the student's wants and needs. Who else would be better qualified to budget the student activities fee than students, and involved students at that -the Student Senate. 
The sentiment around this campus for the last few years has been that the administration has too much "control" in the students' social life. Mowle seems to advocate more adminis­trative control; control that has not been con­tested by the administration. 
The recent decision by the Student Senate to permit the Pat Browne-Joanie Cahill ticket to be reinstated in the Student Body Presiden­tial campaign has been a very hot topic, at least in The Observer, for the past week. From resignations ofvarious senate members to the proposal ofabolishing ofthe senate have been the only responses to the decision made last Saturday afternoon. 
I was one of the eight senate members to vote the Browne-Cahill ticket back into the race. 
In making a decision, one cannot just look at the infraction, enforce the prescribed punishment, and shut the book. This seems to be the way many students and senate mem­bers have looked at this issue. Campaign rules were broken, thus the candidacy, per the elec­tion rules, must be forfeited. 
In this case, however, I felt that we, the sen­ate, had to look at the consequences of our decision, and not only "enforce the rules." 
Had the Student Senate disallowed the Browne-Cahill ticket to run, the senate, in ef­fect, would have elected the next Student Body President, a the remaining ticket of Healy-Lawrence would have, therefore, been unopposed. 
I know the Student Senate does not have much clout, as stated by its adversaries, but do you feel the senate, a body consisting of 15 voting members, should have decided who the next student body president and vice president would be? 
I sure as hell don't. And it seems that the 1,051 students who voted for Browne-Cahill felt the same way. 
I, or the senate, obviously do not condone the actions taken by Browne-Cahill during the campaign. Thus, we did apply restrictions on their future campaigning before the election. 
The students knew full well of the infrac­tions, per The Observer. Thus, the students should be the ones who choose their next stu­dent body president and vice president. 
I hope the student body somehow ap­preciates that they were given the opportunity to vote in 1985 for their SBP/SBVP by the senate. Because, if some sen­ate members and The Observer editorial board had their way, the students would have been denied the chance to vote for student body president. 


AlfredNovas StudentBody Treasurer 


Blatantly ignorant to expell Browne/Cahill 
DearEditor: 
In response to Frank Andreano's article 
concerning the expelling ofPat Browne. I too, 
feel compelled to make the following state­
ment. Andreano's suggestion that Browne and 
Cahill be expelled is probably the most Judi· 
crous and blantantly ignorant statement I 
have heard come from one of the supposed 
future leaders here at Notre Dame. 
As a friend of mine put it, why don't we all 
just take Pat and Joanie down to the Grotto 
and shoot them. Andreano's statement makes 
him far more a disgrace to the University than 
he claims Browne is. For Andreano to suggest 
such an disproportionate punishment and 
then to imply that he is part of the highly 
moralistic society here at Notre Dame is about 
as hypocritical a statement as one could make. 
Clearly Browne's actions were wrong. He 
knows it, and has told me he is sorry about the 
whole affiar but that he has to face it and take 
what he deserves. Andreano seems to think 
that Pat's mistake warrants that his future 
should be considered ruined. Pat does not 
deserve to attend any graduate school, or for 
that matter, obtain any desirable job he may 
wish to seek. This is what Andreano's state­
ment implies, as this would be the case ifhis 
suggestion be carried out. 
Pat has done nothing less than make one of 
those once-in-a-while big mistakes that we all 
make. To suggest such a fate as Andreano 
proposes in immoral, unethical and in my 
opinion un-Christian. Andreano would do bet­
ter in the future to make sure he thinks before 
he makes such hideous remarks. 
I have known Pat Browne for fourteen years and am proud ofit. I knowwhat kind ofperson he is and it gets me quite angry when I read such attacks on his character. In my opinion Pat is one of the most hard working, con­cerned and good natured people I know. Had he realized the severity of his actions beforehand, things would have been different. 
Although it does not justify his actions, Pat's past accomplishments and the hard work he has put in for our benefit, should say some­thing about him. I hope that before anyone. else equates his actions with those of a com­pletely immoral, uncaring person they take this into account. 
My wish is not that Pat andJoanie's mistakes go unnoticed and forgotten but, that perhaps a few of us are taking things a bit too far in our allegations against them. 
It's too bad Pat didn't realize the severity of his actions because they cost us all the chance to have another hard working and concerned Student Body President. 
Ifmy reasoning here is wrong then I suggest we all meet at the Main Circle, as we did for the basketball team. Only this time, wear white sheets and carry torches. Andreano will lead us over to Pat's room and then down to Joanie's and finally we'll run them off campus. Let's all get together, as Andreano put it, and show everyone just how moral we can be.

derson is likely to start junior Chris Nikchevich (6.4 ppg.) in the shoot­ing guard slot alongside playmaker Marty Perry, a deft passer who leads the team with 95 assists. 
The Cougar guards will have their hands full, though, now that the Irish backcoun is at full strength. Fresh­man David Rivers now has his full complement of racing partners in Scott Hicks, Dan Duff, and Joseph Price, and that's a fact which pleases Phelps. 
"We got our three-guard rotation (Rivers, Hicks, and Duff) going against Fordham, and that's why Rivers was so much more effective," 
Friday, February 22, 1985 ­
notes Phelps. "Now we can concen· trate on getting the ball to Rivers and letting him go, knowing that we can give him a rest when he needs it." 
Rivers has shown he knows what to do with the ball when he gets it, pumping in 14.6 points a game while leading the team in assists. Still, his play is obviously enhanced by the presence of some backcourt help, primarily Hicks, who scores at a 9.0 ppg. clip. 
The closest matchup will be in the front line, where a young BYU con­tingent will match up with the vet· eran Irish frontcourt. The Cougars will be looking for help for Saarelalnen from 6-9 forward Alan Pollard and 6-10 center Tom Gneit­ing. Pollard, a freshman, has been a pleasant surprise on the inside, net· ting eight points a game while hauling down nearly seven

"Our front line is in a groove now," comments Phelps. "They're complementing our backcourt well, and we've found the seven guys we'll live and die with." 
Phelps hopes that his Irish and their tournament hopes will do more living than dying tomorrow.

"Janice Streit is an effective player," said DiStanislao. "She is a big, bulky kid who takes up a lot of space in the lane. I think she also will make a difference." 
The Irish, meanwhile, should be rested and up to the challenge. They are playing staunch defense, holding their opposition to only 59.6 points per game. Furthermore, Irish for­ward Trena Keys is comingoffone of her best games of her career, a 28­point performance against Loyola. 
"Basically," says DiStanislao, "We're playing well, but DePaul is still going to be a real challenge. They play an up-tempo offense, but they are quite strong inside as well. They are a deceptive team, and it's going to take a good game to beat them." 
Ifthe Irish continue to play as they' have of late, they should be able to play that good game against the Blue Demons.

Saint Mary's basketball upset in home game 
By PAM CUSICK 
Sports Writer 
Playing its final home game of the season, the Saint Mary's basketball team had hoped for somethingother than the upset that Purdue University-Calumet handed it by a 67-44 margin last night at the Angela Athletic Facility. 
The Belles had just rebounded from a loss to Valparaiso University Wednesday night, 63·50. They now look fotward to tomorrow after· noon's showdown with the Univer· sity of Michigan-Dearborn for an on-the-road opponunity to improve its current 4-13 season record. 
The Lady Lakers ofPurdue moved to an early lead on the impressive performance of freshman forward LeeAnn De Young last night. The 6·0 forward dominated play on both ends of the coun, and Purdue went on intimidating the Belles with its fierce defense and inside play to build a 34·21 halftime advantage. 
The Belles were plagued by poor shooting from the field, hitting only 16 of their 62 shots for a percentage of .258, and they could not rally against the Lady Lakers. 
"Purdue intimidated us of· fensively and defensively. They gained control of the game from the beginning and we had no spun to cut into the margin," commented a disappointed head coach Marvin Wood after the game. "It was, percentage-wise, our worst shoot· ing game ofthe season." 
The top scorer was junior forward Beth Kreber with 16 points, while senior guard Teresa McGinnis, and senior forward Elaine Suess each contributed seven points to com· plete the Belles scoring perfor· mance. Kreber, McGinnis and Suess commited three fouls each. 
The Lady Lakers of Purdue were 

not the only threat to the Saint 
Mary's basketball team's record this 
week, as Valparaiso jumped ahead to 
steal another victory away Wednes­
day night. 
"They (the Crusaders) are a big, 

strong team. Their 2·2·I zone press 
got the ball inside," said Wood. 
"Defensively, they played well and 
had good balance throughout the 
game, shooting 17·I8 from the 
field." 
The Belles travel to Dearborn, 

Mich., tomorrow afternoon to take 
on the University of Michigan· 
Dearborn to try to shake off the ap· 
parent losingways that have plagued 
them recently. Game time is 2 p.m.

we: have: to prove: it to ourselves and 
to our opposition." 
Tonight's match with the: Spartans should not provide: the: Irish with too great of a challenge:. Michigan State's individual fencers have all fal· 
lc:n upon bad luck as none have: rc:· corded a winning percentage: better than . '500. This, along with the: ap· pointment of a new head coach this season, has sidetracked a usually potent Spartan attack. 
"This team is not as competitive as other Michigan State: teams of the: past," said DeCicco. "We should be able to fence: all of our fencers and give our fourth, fifth, and sixth men a shot at monogramming for the season." 
Tomorrow, however, is a different story. The tournament will involve 14 different dual matches, six of which will include: the Irish. 
Opening the: action at 9 a.m. on the: center strip, the Irish will be facing Chicago. Against the: Maroons, the Irish are 37-8 lifetime:. On Feb. 9, in Detroit, the Irish faced Chicago and soundly defeated them, 24-3. 
At 10:30 a.m., the Irish wlll face the: Purdue: Boilermakers. Once again. as in the: Chicago match, DeCicco does not foresee any great difficulties. Against the: Boilers, the Irish have only lost twice in 29 out­ings. Last year, Notre Dame beat Purdue:, 23-4. 
As the Irish fence into the noontime hours, the action will pick up with Northwestern, Wisconsin, Illinois and Wayne: State providing four straight, solid challenges to the unbeaten Irish. 
Earlier in the: year, the: Irish travelled to Wayne, Mich., where they met and downed the defending national champions, Wayne State:, in their backyard by a I'i-12 margin. A meet schedulc:d with Illinois on Jan­uary 26 in Columbus, Ohio, was can­celled because: ofa blizzard. 
Of the four major challenges, Northwestern may prove to be the weakest if any can be considered as such. DeCicco, nc:verthc:less, is hoping that the scheduling of the Wildcats before the others will gradually build up his squad to a point at which they can meet per­haps the three best teams in the Mid­west.

foil and excellent in epee," said DeCicco. "Against Northwestern, I'm hoping that we can really get serious. Wisconsin, Illinois and Wayne: State: are almost equal in size." 
Throughout their history, the: Irish have winning records against all of their opponents. Against the Wildcats, they are 19-4. Against the Badgers, 34-1 0, and against the Illini, they arc 29-12. Against the Tartans, they arc: 24-14. 
Meeting any major collegiate team always is a challenge for the Irish when one considers that the Irish fence without any scholarships. Nc:verthc:less, the highly regarded Irish will be looking forward to proving themsc:lves this weekend as the odds-on favorite to win their third national championship in seven years. 
Last year, after winning the Great Lakes Championship and going into the: NCAA tourney as the top-seeded team from the Midwest, the Irish stalled in the finals and wound up with a third-place finish. 

"I'm looking this weekend for our nine: starters who will be going to the Great Lakes Championships (March 2 at Notre Dame:)," said DeCicco. "If we sweep the six meets, then we could begin talking national championship. Even if we lose: one or two, we would still be a 'good' team." 
Startingfor the Irish in the foil will be junior captain Mike VanderVel­den ( 26-6), defending national foil champion Charles Higgs-Coulthard (24-1 ), and the oncoming junior Craig Funai ( I 5-6). 

In the: sabre, the Irish will go with senior captain MikeJanis ( 24-2), and juniors Don Johnson ( 18-'i) and John Edwards ( 14-4). Junior Tony Consoli ( 1 0-6) may or may not be available for action as he is suffering from a pulled stomach muscle:. 
In the epee, senior captain Andy' Quaroni ( 27-3) will anchor the Irish 

squad. Juniors Christian SChc:rpe ( 25-'i) and Mike Gostigian ( 8-2) will add depth as the Irish hope to get at, among others, Ettore Bianchi. Bianchi, a Wayne State: senior who won the national championship in the epee last year, always plays tough against the Irish. In their ear­lier meeting he was 3-0. 
Fencing alongside: the men will be the women's squad. At 9-4, the Irish are looking to beat some stiffcompe­tition and emerge as a true con­tender for one of three team spots for the NCAA tourney to be chosen from the Midwest. 
"In order for us to get there (the NCAAs) we're going to have to knock off an Ohio State or a Northwestern," Said DeCicco. "Wayne State will also certainly be one team up for the nationals also." 
As with the men, the women should be able to overcome the Spartan challenge tonight. Against Michigan State, they arc: 7-0. 
Tomorrow, the women will face some of the toughest competition in the Midwest. Keying the success for the Irish will be a concerted effort on the part of DeCicco's four starters. 
According to DeCicco, freshman Molly Sullivan ( 31-4) should anchor the squad reasonably well and has a good chance of going undefeated. Needing eight wins per match, DeCicco is looking for Sullivan to provide him with three to four of those: wins. The rest will have to come from junior captain Janet Sul­livan (23-20) and sophomores Vit­toria Quaroni (27-12) and Cindy Weeks (25-16). 
"Molly Sullivan will certainly be one of the individuals in the nation­als," said DeCicco. "Janet Sullivan, Vittoria Quaroni, and Cindy Weeks­one of those: girls is going to have to come through for us to win." 
In tomorrow's action the Irish will be: facing four teams against which they have winning records:

team," said DeCicco. " When he chose to come to Notre Dame, I was thrilled." 
This far into the season, Scherpe has compiled a 25-'i record and combines with senior Andy Quaroni to form possibly the most devastat­ing one-two epee punch in the country. 
Scherpe was born in Krefeld, West Germany, where he grew up fencing in an nation internationally recognized as a fencing power. 
He: compiled an impressive record fencing for two years at Cal State-Northridge. His outstanding personal record of 57-9 earned him all-American honors both as a fresh­man and a sophomore. Last year he finished tied for second in the nation in the epee division.

This weekend's actions should provide the: spectator with some: outstanding action for free admis­sion. The men will try to maintain a 20-game winning streak and the: wo­men will look to better their record beginning tonight in the ACC Fieldhouse at 7 p.m. and tomorrow at 9 a.m. 
"Ifyou get a degree from here, it's easier to get a good job," said Scherpe. "It (the: Irish fencing team) is one: of the superior teams in the country, and we should have a good chance to win the: national champi­onship in at least one of the: next three years." 
According to Scherpe, the key to winning the: title: will be the Great Lakes Championships next weekend where the Irish hope to qualify a maximum of two fencers in each weapon. 
"It (a national championship) depends upon how many people we: can qualify for the nationals at the Great Lakes next weekend," said Scherpe. "If we could qualify all six people -two in each weapon -then we should have a good chance to win it or at least finish in the top three:." 
For the present, Scherpe will have ample opportunity to expand upon his already good record and help the Irish continue on their unbeaten string this weekend.

Second year 
SMC holds indoor soccer tourney 
ByDIANE PRESTI 
Sports Writer 

This weekend Saint Mary's Col­lege will play host to its second an· nual indoor soccer tournament. 
The teams returning from last year's tournament will be Michigan State University, Marquette Univer· sity, Indiana University, Northwes­tern University and Notre Dame. New to the tournament will be Eas­tern Illinois University and Hope College of Holland, Mich. 
The tournament is sponsored by the Saint Mary's Soccer Club and the Saint Mary's Athletic Department. 
Saint Mary's coach John Akers ex­plained why the College holds this tournament. 
"Saint Mary's has a good indoor facility, and women's soccer is growing in the area," Akers said. "Our club has grown to the point where it can compete with most Midwest schools." 
The action will begin tomorrow morning at 9:00 and continue through the day until 5 p.m. Play will pick up again at 9 a.m. Sunday and go until the championship game at 3 
p.m. There will be one match every 
hour on both days. The eight teams will be broken up into two divisions with Saint Mary's faired well.

21 years at ND 

Jack Lloyd makes ACC exciting 
ByJEFF BLUMB 
Assistant Sports Edttor 
Tim Kempton goes up for the of­
fensive rebound and comes down 
with the ball. But before he can go 
back up with a shot, he is fouled. And 
because Notre Damejs in the bonus, 
Kempton steps to the free throw line 
and readies himself to shoot. 
"At the line for the Irish," comes 
the call from ACC Public Address 
Announcer John 'Jack' Uoyd, "Tim 
Kempwn shooting one and..." 
"The bonus," the student section 
finishes the sentence in chorus. 
Most students, though, know very 
little about Uoyd, the man behind 
the microphone at Notre Dame bas­
ketball games for the last 21 years. 
Following part-time work as a radio play-by-play announcer of high school football and basketball games, Uoyd started doing public address for Notre Dame basketball in '1964, the year John Dee became head coach of the Irish. The two had become acquainted in 19'51, when Dee was a Notre Dame assistant coach and Uoyd was allowed to do some traveling with the team be­cause his father was a good friend of John jordan, head coach at the time. 
When De~ returned to the Univer­sity to assume head coaching re­sponsibilities, he asked Uoyd to be the announcer at home games, which then were held at the now­gone Notre Dame Fieldhouse. The Irish moved over to the brand-new Athletic and Convocation Center in 1968, and Uoyd moved with them. 
A 19'58 Notre Dame graduate, Uoyd has had his moments in 21 years of announcing the names of some of college basketball's finest players. 
"You don't change a mistake once you've made it," says Uoyd. "My best faux pas of all time was in 1971 when we had the first round of the NC..AA Mideast Regional here. AI McGuire was here with Marquette and his son Allie was playing for him. 
"Love Story was the big movie at the time. Allie had come out of the game and later reported back to the scorer. As he was going back into the game, I said, 'Returning to the Mar­quette line-up, Ali McGraw. 
"I didn't realize that I had said it, and I heard the section full of Mar­quette students hootin' and hollerin' and wondered what was going on. After the game, a doctor from South Bend came up and told me. I didn't realize It until he told me." 
At the same time, Uoyd also has had a lot offun with names. 
"The name that was the most fun to work with," he says," was prob­ably Orlando Woolridge because it could be dra~ed out. It started out as simply Orlando Woolridge, and then over a period of time I started dragging it out. As he got to his senior year. I was really dragging it out. 
"I also had a lot of fun with Kelly Tripucka's name. People always told me that it sounded like I was getting sick to my stomach when I said it. 
"I've done other people's names in different ways," continues Uoyd. ''I'll look at a name and say, 'Is there 
something I can do,' and then some­
thing normally happens, and it's 
spontaneous at the time it happens. 
The John Paxson thing was one of 
those spontaneous type things and it 
happened in his junior year. All of a 
sudden, and I don't know what 
prompted me to do it, but it just hit 
me to put a 'He's' in front of every.­
thing I said for him, and it caught 
on." 
The names ofpresent Notre Dame 

players present a problem for lloyd ­
they aren't any fun. 
"The honest truth is," he says, "is 

that today there aren't really any fun 
names to do things with. I guess, if 
any of them, it would be Barlow. 
There's not a lot ofthings you can do 
with it, but it's a two-syllable name 
and the last syllable is low, so I just 
drop my inflection. 
"But other than that, we really don't have anybody right now that has a name you can really play with. I've been trying to think of some­thing for David Rivers, and I'm sure that by the time he's a senior some­thing will happen." 
A first for Uoyd came about this year. The students have become in­volved in something that he does, finishing the sentence for him whenever he announces that a player is shooting the one-and-one. 
"It's interesting, but for probably 14 or I'5 years, this is something I've been trying to do," Uoyd comments. "And this year is the first year that they've ever done it, picking up 'the bonus.' I have no idea how the stu­dents picked that up. 
"I can't recall which game it was, but I did 'one and' and said 'the bonus,' and as I said it I heard the students do it. I thought, 'Arc they picking this up?' The second time I did it they did it again, and I thought, 'They are picking it up.' The third time, I quit saying 'bonus' and realized they were into it, and they've done it ever since." 
Uoyd was born in Michigan City but has lived in South Bend all ofhis life. The owner of his own business, Uoyd Insurance Agency, he also has been the football press box announ­cer since 1965, in addition to volun­teering his time to announce the semifinals and finals of the Bookstore Basketball tournament, where he is at his humorous best. 
The father of five children, Uoyd realizes that his responsibilities as public address announcer at the ACC go beyond simply reciting names, numbers and personal fouls. 
"It's definitely part of my job to create excitement," he says. "In an arena like the ACC, with the people so close to the floor, I think it's part of the program that you can get the students and fans into the game more by something you do." 
Uoyd may be required to do a lot of talking while selling insurance during the day, but don't think h~ doesn't enjoy the talking he does over at the ACC in his spare time. 
"The thing I really enjoy about my job is being around young people," Uoyd says. "I think being around young people, and seeing the things that go on at a university or college, helps you to think and be young yourself. 
"In addition, it's a release from the things that I do all day long. You know, you go to work and you're un­der pressure all day at work. It's a relaxation, and everybody has differ­ent forms ofrelaxation. I guess this is mine." 
It may be true that Uoyd enjoys being around young people at the games, but it is probably more true that young people enjoy being around Uoyd. His unique way ofan­nouncing not only makes the game more exciting, but also makes a Notre Dame basketball game more than just a basketball game.

Notre Dame and BYU meet with NCAA tourney at stake 
By CHUCK FREEBY 
Sports Writer 
It has been said that every Catho­lic dreams ofgoing to Notre Dame. It has also been said that every Mor­mon yearns to go to Brigham Young University. Tomorrow, one Catho­lic, Digger Phelps, and one Mormon, Ladell Anderson, will be trying to make another drellf!l come true. 
Making the NCAA tournament. 
Unfortunately, only one will make progress in acheiving that goal to­morrow, as Notre Dame and BYU square off on the basketball court of the Athletic and Convocation Cen­ter. The game is listed as a sellout, and WNDU-TV will televise the clash, with tip-offslated for 2 p.m. 
Notre Dame enters the contest with a 16-7 record, following an im­pressive road win over Fordham 
Still leading conference 
Women take on DePaul at ACC 
By MARlY BURNS 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's basket­ball team got a much-deserved respite yesterday after its pasting of 1984 North Star Conference cham­pion Loyola (Chicago), 84-59, Wed­nesday evening at the ACC It will be business-as-usual today, though, for Mary DiStanislao's conference­leading Irish, as they prepare for a Sunday afternoon contest against 
Dt-Paul at 2 p.m. at the ACC 
lbe 14-Birish, who are now 7-1 in the conference, have been playing their best ball of the season lately, as they have racked up victories in nine of their last I I matches. DePaul, on the other hand, is comingoffa defeat Wednesday to Detroit which left them at I 7-7 on the season, and 5-5 in the: conference. 
Wednesday night, which gave the Irish their seventh win in their last nine outings. BYU comes in with a I 5-l0 mark after knocking off Air Force last Saturday to win their eighth contest in their last I I tries. 
With both teams finishing the season strong, Phelps said he realizes the importance ofSaturday's contest to both squads. 
"They're similar to us in a lot of ways, and they have a good shot at the NCAA, too," Phelps said. "As far as we're concerned, this is a home game, a student's game, and a chance for us to get our 17th win. We've got three home games left, and we need to win all ofthem." 
Phelps knows that winning those games will not be an easy task, as BYU comes in with a potent offense which averages 75 points an outing. Spearheading the Cougar attack is 6­
This game may, indeed, turn out to be a serious challenge for the Irish, since it was the Blue Demons who handed the Irish their only NSC loss of the season, a 72-64 drubbing in Chicago on jan. 27. 
"The memory of that game will motivate our players," said DiStanis­lao. "We have to remember it, and guard against making the same mistakes. They (the Blue Demons) are pretty much the same team, and they're going to come in here sky­high to beat Notre Dame." 
In that game at Chicago, the Irish led by five points at halftime, despite shooting a woeful 36 percent from the field. DePaul, which shot an even worse 32 percent in the half, turned things around in the second stanza, hitting 58 percent of its shots and outrebounding Notre Dame, 20-1 5. 
Among the stars of that contest 

6 senior forward Timo Saarelainen, a member of last year's Finnish Olym­pic team, who has averaged 23.3 points per game. However, Phelps said he has no special plans to com­bat the Helsinki hot shot. 
"We'll just play our game," con­tends Phelps, who was impressed with his team's defensive showing against Fordham. "Wednesday night, our defense helped put us in our of­fensive situations, and that's where we got our scoring balance." 
Saarelainen isn't the only offen­sive weapon in the BYlJ arsenal, as guard Scott Sinek also has proven to be a scoring threat. Sinek has averaged a shade over I 0 points a game, but may miss tomorrow's con­test with a dislocated right kneecap.· Should Sinek not be ready to go, An-

was 5-5 DePaul guard Sally Ander­
son, who scored 24 points, and 5-10 
junior center Tracy Manuel, who 
grabbed 13 rebounds to comple­
ment her 16 points. 
Notre Dame can find consolation, 
perhaps, in noting that it is not the 
only team to have trouble contain­
ing those two DePaul standouts. 
Anderson, a sophomore, is averag­
ing 19.9 ppg. for the Blue Demons, 
while Manuel contributes a 10.9 
scoring average to go with her 8.9 
rebounds-per-game clip. 
"Sally Anderson was a big factor in 
the first game," said DiStanislao. 
"She is a very effective player from 
outside. We are going to have to play 
better defense on her."

Hockey team ends season with Wolves this weekend 
ByED IX>MANSKY 
Sports Writer 
As this season, which marked the return of varsity hockey at Notre Dame, swings into its final weekend, the Irish are hoping to extend their present three-game winning streak and finish in style as they play host to to the University of Michigan­Dearborn tonight and tomorrow at the ACC Both contests begin at 7:30 p.m. 
The latest victory string has en­abled Notre Dame to improve its record to 9-16-l. The Wolves of 
Dearborn arrive at Notre Dame with a 16-13-l mark. 
Along with the games, this final weekend of 1984-85 will feature the annual Parents Weekend celebra­tion. The activities culminate prior to Saturday night's face-off when team members honor their parents with a traditional red-carpet intro­duction ceremony. 
And for Irish seniors Steve Ely, Al Haverkamp, Tom Parent and Rob Ricci, the weekend series will mark their final appearances in a Notre Dame uniform. Two other seniors, co-captain Brent Chapman and Tim Reilly, have been granted an extra year of eligibility by the NCAA due to last season's participation on the

Fencers put unblemished 

record on the line at ACC 
By MICHAELJ. CHMIEL 
Sports Writer 

For the first time this year, the Notre Dame fencing team will bring 
its talented and undaunted act home to compete before a friendly 
audience this weekend, as the Irish will play host to seven Midwes­
tern foes in the ACC Fieldhouse. 
Tonight, the Irish will make up a postponed dual meet with the 
Michigan State Spartans at 7 p.m. Tomorrow, the unbeaten Irish will 
have their 16-0 record challenged as they play host to four Big Ten 
teams and the defending national champions beginning at 9 a.m. 
"I'd pay to see this action," said Irish head coach Mike DeCicco. 
"Basketball can't compare with the importance of this weekend's 
fencing. It's like facing Georgetown, St. John's, and DePaul on the 
same day." 

After fencing on the road since the season began in early january. 
the North Dome of the ACC will be a welcome sight for the Irish. 
Considering the harsh weather which the Irish have had to face in 
their travels and the unfriendly surroundings ofsome nine different 
sites, the Irish have been extremely sound and have been exemplify­
ing national-championship form. This weekend, though, the Irish 
must prove themselves against the likes ofWayne State, Illinois, Wis­
consin and Northwestern back-to-back. 
"We have had a better season than I would have expected," said 
DeCicco. "In order to come away and say that we have a shot at the

Scherpe gives the Irish experience in epee division 
By MARK STADTMUELLER and MICHAELJ. CHMIEL 
Sports Writers 

The Notre Dame men's fencing team has enjoyed great success 
this season and appears to be heading toward a national champion­
ship. One of the reasons for the team's prominence has been the 
outstanding performance of junior epeeist Christian Scherpe. 
Scherpe, along with junior epeeist Alex Gruman, transferred to 
Notre Dame after attending Cal State-Northridge for two years. 
"I was here as an exchange student for one year (in 1981 ) and if I 
would have gone back to Germany, I would have gone back to the 
eleventh grade," said Scherpe, a native ofWest Germany. 
"It would have taken me three years to get my diploma, but I 
already had it in California. 
"I applied to Cal-Northridge, and they took me. I would have been 
graduating from high school now (in West Germany), but now I'm 
graduating from college next year." 
After Cal State-Northridge, finished eighth in the NCAA tourna­
ment last year, the school was forced to disband its fencing program. 
A faculty member at his former school knew Irish head coach 
Mike DeCicco and recommended that Scherpe apply to Notre 
Dame. Scherpe and Gruman both applied to Notre Dame and were 
accepted, much to the delight of DeCicco. 
"Scherpe has been a welcome addition to an already good epee
