By MICHAEL CHAMBLISS 
News Writer 
In his capacity as chairman of "The Charter for Protection of Children and Young People," former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating spoke Monday to a packed house in the llesburgh Center Auditorium on the topic of politics and vocation. 
A Hepublican and lifelong Catholic, Keating served as gov­ernor of Oklahoma from 1995 to 2003. lie is widely known for his attempts to mitigate social ills such as drug abuse, child abuse, divorce and domestic violence through mobilization of the clergy. Keating has also been lauded for his strong lead­ership after the 1994 Oklahoma City bombing. 
Keating spoke at length about the obligation of Americans to participate in public life. 
"Every one of you has a voca­tion to politics. We all have an obligation to serve," said Keating. He added that the merging of the public and the private sectors is essential for the success of the United States. Keating, who could only serve a maximum of eight years as Oklahoma's governor, said he believes term limits support this healthy mix. 
"The role of a Catholic should be to present himself as a per­son of honor and integrity, a symbol of what a citizen should be like," said Keating of lhc role of Catholics in American public life. 
Helating numerous personal stories and anecdotes. Keating highlighted the importance of equality and the individual voice in /\merica. Keating pointed out that although only 3 percent of Oklahoma's popu­lation is Catholic, his basic right to be heard has enabled him to incorporate his faith into public policy. 
"They don't see it as preach­ing, The public in Oklahoma has embraced all of these agen­das as the right thing to do," said Keating of policies such as his initiative to promote mar­riage. 
Keating also addressed the recent sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic Church. 
"There isn't a greater calling anywhere to serve God than in ministry, but something hap­pened and people saw evil f'ace­to-face and they turned away," said Keating. 
The former governor is cur­rently involved in a study to root out the causes of behav­ioral problems in the clergy and the lack of vocations. Keating expressed disbelief at the number of scandals that

By MATT BRAMANTI 
New,Wri1er 
Student government's Judicial Council announced the results of Monday's class council elections. Each four­person ticket represented can­didates for president, vice president, treasurer and sec­retary. 
Freshmen overwhelmingly elected current freshman class treasurer James Leito and his ticket to lead the class of 2006. The ticket also included Kate Distler, Mark Seiler and Anna Skoien. Freshman class presi­dent Dave Baron, who decided not to run for re-election, endorsed the ticket. 
According to Leito's cam­paign Web site, the group's priorities include improved Joyce Center seating for bas­ketball games, a sophomore tailgating section at football games and "weekend-long ser­vice events extending into the South Bend community." The Lcito ticket. one of four on the ballot, garnered 57 percent of the nearly 1,100 votes cast. The nearest challenge came. from Matt Goulet, who walked away with 16 percent of the votes. 
Sophomores found only one ticket running for junior class council. Katie Barrett narrow­ly won election in a race char­acterized by low turnout and large numbers of abstentions. Barrett, who ran with Jim Mooney, Beth Ward and Anne Raih, narrowly escaped with 53 percent of the vote. Only 490 members of the class of 2005 cast ballots. Barrett's campaign information was not available. 
Jazmin Garcia was elected in a landslide to lead the class of 2004. Garcia, who ran with Chip Marks, Katie Conklin and Carol McCarthy, secured 73 percent of the vote in the two­ticket field, handily defeating a ticket led by Megan Horner. Garcia, who ran under the slo­gan "Doin' it with class for 2004," aims to continue sever­al initiatives begun by the cur­rent senior class council, led by Matt Smith. 
According to Garcia's cam­paign Web site, the ticket plans to continue the popular Margaritavillc event, create a "class 21st birthday" and begin production of a senior yearbook.

SMC candidates state platforms 
By EMILY BRAMMER 
News Writer 
Eight tickets presented their platforms at the Meet the Candidates night Monday at Saint Mary's during an enthu­siastic question and answer period before today's class boards election. 
Two freshman tickets run­ning for sophomore class board focused on how they propose to keep lines of com­munication open with their classmates. 
Andriana Bauer and Elizabeth Goers, as former freshman class president and vice president, respectively, emphasized ways to continue the good work of the current board and ways to further unify the class of 2006. Plans include a semi-formal dance at a bowling alley and inte­grating the sophomore class with the upper class through a "Big Sister Program." 
"We have a strong founda­tion from the year to build on," Bauer said. 
Freshmen Michelle Fitzgerald and Amelia Oliva, also running for sophomore class council. place class unity as their first priority. 
This ticket plans to present a resolution to Residence Hall Association for an ATM in each residence hall. Fitzgerald outlined the tick­et's plans to buy advertising space in The Observer once a month in order to publicize sophomore events. 
"Looking at past precedent and keeping lines of commu­nication open is key," Fitzgerald said. 
The two tickets running for junior class board emphasized the importance of technology in maintaining open lines of communication with the members of their class. 
Emily Pernotto and Barbara Kier) comprise a four-member team platform belonging to the Saint Mary's basketball team. They emphasized the skills learned as members of the basketball team and pro­moted themselves as hard working leaders. , 
Their primary goal is to uti­lize the Class of 2003 Instant Messenger username in order to communicate with the class on important events and updates. 
Catherine White and Mary Pauline Moran also empha­sized the importance of the Internet for communication purposes. The ticket wants to build an interactive junior class Web site where they could actively track polls and allow people to submit cre­ative work. 
"The Internet would be a tool fur bringing people together," said White. the presidential candidate. 
They wish to focus on plan­ning quality junior events rather than increase the quantity of them. They would eventually like to recognize the. accomplishments of the talented members of their class on their Web site and around campus. 
Both tickets for the senior class board are dedicated to making their upcoming senior year full of exciting and mem­orable experiences. They offered their ideas as to potential projects and activi­ties they would like to plan for next year. 
Linda Janke and Abagail Van Vlerah intend to explore ways the senior class can help with the concerns of the stu­dent body should they be elected. Part of this plan includes bringing back monthly service projects and volunteering opportunities at the Young Women's Christian Association. 
"We're trying to bring back the monthly service projects that we had our freshman and sophomore years here at Saint Mary's," Van Vie rah said. "We want to give back to the community we're living in." 
In addition to reviving com­munity service projects, the ticket plans to kick off a "Big Sis/Lil Sis" project in conjunc­

Editor

where snow falls once a year and the entire city becomes as helpless as a student facing an early morning Organic Chemistry test, I wasn't sure what I would do to survive. There would be no thrills of football games to keep me occupied, no leisurely readings of textbooks while relaxing on a comfortable bench overlooking the Golden Dome -no aimless strolls around campus without a par­ticular destination in mind. I sincere­ly hoped that I would not confine myself to my dorm room, living off of Diet Cokes and the chocolate chip cookies my roommate's mother would send. 
Fortunately for me, I get out quite often, dressed in more layers of clothing than I ever thought humanly possible and a pair of huge hiking boots I only imagined Army ROTC cadets wear. I rush off to class and the dining hall as often as I did in the fall, although at a slightly faster pace and with more unmentionable mut­terings under my breath. Most importantly, however, I have found a relief from the piling up of snow and schoolwork that shattered all wor­ries of days spent under a warm comforter -Notre Dame basketball. 
Thanks to a few eager friends, I now relish the chance of arriving incredibly early to the JACC to gain a coveted seat from which to watch an energizing game of thrilling baskets, heartbreaking misses and raucous fans shouting insults prepared by legions of fans with too much time spent in front of a computer. I have learned the subtle art of tricks meant to rattle opposing free-throw shoot­ers and enrage opposing coaches, watched thrilling last-second victo­ries and shouted for men and women I once knew very little about. 
Although the men's games are inherently exciting with rowdy fans and stands packed with more people than available seats, I have found women's basketball to be enjoyable as well. I don't think I. or my father have ever been as excited as we were watching Ruth Riley sink last­second free-throws to ice a national championship. I enjoy watching crisp passes, aggressive drives to the hoop and an invigorating sense of youth and excitement that will only be honed with more experience. 
When my friends from warm places inquire how I'm doing in the South Bend, I respond that things are going better than l had expected: the cold no longer affects me as much as it once did. Maybe it's all the warm blood flowing through my veins as I watch a tip-off that keeps me going.

Saddan1 Hussein challenges Bush to televised debate 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD 
Saddam Hussein indicated on Monday that he does not intend to follow U.N. orders to destroy his Al-Samoud 2 mis­siles, and challenged President Bush to an internationally televised debate via satellite linkup. 
In a three-hour interview with CBS anchor Dan Hather, the Iraqi leader said he envisioned a live debate with Bush along the lines of those in a U.S. presi­dential campaign, according to the net­work. 
Hather reported on the interview dur­ing the evening newscast. CBS said it planned to broadcast excerpts on Tuesday and the entire interview on Wednesday. 
Rather said that Saddam walked a lit­tle stiffly when he met with him but was calm and "unhurried" during the inter­view. 
Regarding chief U.N. weapons inspec­tor Hans Blix's order that Iraq destroy its Al-Samoud 2 missiles, Rather quoted Saddam as saying: "Iraq is allowed to prepare proper missiles and we are committed to that." 
Asked whether the Al-Samoud 2 mis­siles are "proper," Saddam was quoted as replying: "We do not have missiles that go beyond the prescribed range." 
The order was issued after interna­tional experts determined the missile flew farther than the 93-mile limit set down by the United Nations in 1991. Iraq maintains some of the missiles overshot the limit because they were tested without warheads and guidance systems. 
"This is not a serious issue," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said of the reported debate offer. "There is no debating his need to disarm." 
Fleischer said Saddam's comments about the Al Samouds represented "open defiance" of the United Nations. "lie refuses even to acknowledge that the weapons are prohibited," Fleischer said. 
Iraq has until the end of the week to begin destroying the missiles, compo­nents and other related systems. If it fails to do so, that could give impetus to a draft U.N. resolution submitted Monday by the United States. Britain and Spain that would pave the way for war. 
Iraq had suggested it was trying to persuade the United Nations to allow it to keep the missiles after technical modi­fications worked out in talks with U.N. technicians. 
WORLD NEWS BRIEFS 
North Korea test-fires missile into sea: 
North Korea test-fired an anti-ship missile that landed in the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said Tuesday. U.S. and Korean officials said the mis­sile was likely a small, conventional one, not the ballistic rocket that U.S. officials fear can possibly hit parts of the western United States. 
Colombian rebels label captives POW,s: 
Colombian rebels declared Monday that three cap­tured Americans were "prisoners of war" and will be freed only as part of a broad prisoner exchange with Colombian government. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, demanded a demilitarized zone from the Colombian government in order to exchange tho three Americans and dozens of Colombian soldiers and police for insurgents who are in Colombian prisons. 
NATIONAL NEWS BRIEFS 
U.S. charges 55 with selling drug gear: Federal authorities charged 55 people with trafficking in illegal drug paraphernalia in an investigation they said targeted the nation's biggest Internet distributors of marijuana bongs, crack pipes and other drug abuse gear. In coordinated raids on Monday, officials con­fiscated "thousands and thousands of tons" of paraphernalia from companies boasting up to $50 million in annual sales, said Mary Beth Buchanan, U.S.' attorney in Pittsburgh whose office is leading the "Operation Pipe Dreams" investigation along with the Drug Enforcement Administration. "No one would possibly use these items for smoking tobacco," Buchanan said at a Justice Department news conference. Attorney General John Ashcroft said the sale of drug paraphernalia has exploded on the Internet. making it easier for teenagers and young adults to buy it. 
Ashcroft says terrorism alert still high: 
The threat of a terrorist attack against Amcricu remains high and there are no plans to down­grade the nation's terror alert, Attorney General John Ashcroft said Monday. U.S. intelligence­gathering continues to show enough of a threat to warrant keeping the alert level at "high risk," the second-highest level on a five-color scale, Ashcroft said. The level was raised to orange on Feb. 7, prompting the government to impose extra security measures and causing jitters throughout country. "The constant and continu­ous evaluation of the factors that go into the development of threat level have not changed in a way significant enough for the threat level to be changed," Ashcroft said. Other Bush administra­tion officials. notably Homeland Security Secretary Tom Hidge, have indicated the level could soon be reduced to "elevated." the middle of the color scale.

Convicted spy won't face death penalty 
Associatrd P rcss 
ALEXANDRIA, Va. 

The government's attempt to impose the death penalty on convicted spy Brian Patrick Regan was rejected Monday by the federal jury that convicted him of offering to sell U.S. intelligence to Ir·aq and China. 
Regan, a former' Air Force master sergeant. was found guilty last week on two attempted espionage counts and a single charge of gather­ing national defense informa­tion. He was acquitted of attempting to spy for Libya. 
The Iraq conviction required the jury to consider a second question: Did Regan offer doc­uments concerning nuclear weaponry. military satellites, war plans or other major U.S. weapons systems? 
Jurors deliberated nearly seven hours over two days before deciding he did not, a decision that spared him the possibility of the death penalty. 
Ethel and Julius Rosenberg were the last Americans put to death for spying. They were executed in 1953 for conspir­ing to ·steal U.S. atomic secrets for the Soviet Union. 
Regan still could receive life imprisonment when he's sen­tenced May 9, but his lawyers claimed victory with Monday's decision. 
Defense attorney Jonathan Shapiro said that with a possi­ble war with [raq looming, "it took a lot of gutsn for jurors to forgo the death penalty. 
U.S. Attorney Paul McNulty said he was satisfied with the outcome of the case. Justice has been served in this case," he said in a statement. "Mr. Regan is now a convicted spy. For this betrayal of country, he will pay a heavy price." 
Regan, a 40-year-old, mar­ried father of four from Bowie, Md., had worked at the National Reconnaissance Office, which operates the gov­ernment's spy satellites, first for the Air Force and then as a civilian employee for TRW. a defense contractor. 
Prosecutors never claimed Regan actually passed secrets. But they said he was desperate to get out from under $117,000 in credit card debts and draft­ed a letter to Saddam Hussein offering to sell U.S. intelligence for $13 million. He made simi­lar offers to Chinese and Libyan officials. prosecutors contended. 
Using his access to a classi­fied Internet network, Regan looked up dozens of top-secret documents. including satellite photos of Iraqi missile sites. He was arrested Aug. 23, 2001, at Dulles International Airport outside Washington while boarding a flight for Zurich, Switzerland. 
Regan was carrying informa­tion with the coded coordinates of Iraqi and Chinese missile sites, the missiles that were stored there, and the date the information was obtained, prosecutors said. He also had the addresses of the Chinese and Iraqi embassies in Switzerland and Austria in his wallet and tucked into his right shoe. 
Defense lawyers said Regan might have fantasized about spying, but never copied any­thing of value and had no real intention of selling secrets. In court, attorney Nina Ginsberg called his actions "childish," "unprofessional," "nonsense" and "harebrained." 
It was unusual for the case to even reach trial. The govern­ment, wary of disclosing classi­fied material in public, normal­ly agrees to plea bargains in espionage cases. 
It also surprised many that the government sought the death penalty in a case in which sensitive material never was passed. In cases much more damaging to the govern­ment, the CIA's Aldrich Ames and the FBI's Robert llanssen were sentenced to life in prison. 
Ginsberg said Monday that the verdict should send a strong message to Attorney General John Ashcroft "that he has way overreached on death penalty decisions.· 
McNulty's statement did not address the government's rea­sons for seeking the death penalty, but prosecutors argued during the trial that the classified documents Regan looked at would have caused severe harm to U.S. national security had they been passed to a foreign government.

are only now coming to light. 
"There are people who look the other way when lives are being shattered or destroyed. It is an inconceivable evil," he said. 
Keating, who is known to be tough on criminals. responded briefly to a question about cap­ital punishment. Admitting that capital punishment is one of the most challenging issues facing leaders today, Keating explained his reasons for sup­porting the policy. 
"I distinguish between guilty human life and innocent human life. I think that it would cheapen life to say that Timothy McVeigh will not pay for what he did," said Keating. 
He added that his is "basical­ly the Catholic Church's view," explaining that while the pope does not believe in capital pun­ishment, the official teachings of the Church do not yet con­demn it.

IN BRIEF 
Weather cuts into February sales 
The snowstorm that hit the Eastern seaboard a week ago wiped away retailers' much­hoped for Presidents Day sales bonanza and made what already was expected to he a tough month even more difficult. 
J.C. Penney Co. and Federated Department Stores Inc. and Target Corp. lowered their forecasts for February sales, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it expected results at the low end of its estimates. Target Corp. said results were coming in below expectations. "February was weak to begin with, and on top of that we had the snowstorm and the rain­storm," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Hetail Trend Report, based in Montclair. N.J. "Even without the weather, February would not have been a barn-burn­er.'" 
Pilots' chief opposes new carrier 
United Airlines' pilots union reiterated strong opposition Monday to the company's proposal for a low-cost carrier even as United pushed ahead with the concept by naming an official in charge of il. 
In the latest sign of dissent within bankrupt United over starting a discount airline, pilots' union chief Paul Whiteford sent CEO Glenn Tilton a letter saying the sides are "miles apart" on the planned carrier "with no progress in sight." 
Meanwhile, a United executive told a bank­ruptcy court judge that the airline is looking Into the possible closure of its hubs in Los Angeles, Denver and Washington as part of its reorganization plan. Dow Jones Newswires reported. Senior vice president Gregory Taylor said the company was asked by its board of directors to consider the hub clo­sures as an alternative, along with the possi­ble sale of the airline's Pacific operations. 
Company spokesman Joe Hopkins insisted that United has no intention of closing any of its five hubs and is exploring various restruc­turing alternatives.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 
"lnequality is a fact. Equality is a value." 
Mason Cooley 
U.S. aphorist 

The Vagina Monologues. The Girl CuJture Exhibit at the Snite. You can't swing a tampon these days without hit­ting something having to do with the fem­inine experience. Though we've already celebrated 30 years of co-educa­
tion at Notre Amy Schlll 
Dame (Today ice cream, tomorrow equality!), I'd like Tuesday Voice 
to take a few moments to reflect on what it's like to be a girl and how this experience plays out under the Golden Donrn. So let's talk about 'ginas, and I'll try my best not to hurl elephant dung at the Virgin Mary. 
It's hard to discuss anything bordering on feminism here precisely because any attempt to do so is seen as a direct attack on the Mother of God, as a rejection of what a good Catholic woman "should" be. According to Notre Dame iconogra­phy, if I'm not Our Lady, I must be the Samaritan woman by the well. That is, I either need to figure out a way to have babies without having sex (ah, the perfect woman), or I have to have several hus­bands and maybe a few more men on the side. I can be a virgin or a whore. 
Indeed, this binary opposition is very much at play in our community, though in an odd way. When Notre Dame girls aren't being called ugly (but you're glad we're here, right?), we're being called prudes. In other words, if we actually try to live up to the example of Mary, we are judged negatively by men, and ifwe don't, we are judged as sluts by both men and women. Anyone else confused? 
That's right, men and my Church make it very difficult to be a girl, but women don't help much either. Why are shows like "Joe Millionaire," which are in the business of objectifying and ridiculing women (don't get me wrong. I was hooked), more successful at selling femi­nine products than Maxim subscriptions? Psst ... women like to judge women too. 
It's a sad fact that for whatever reason, many girls like belittling other girls as much as they like complaining about how guys belittle them. I don't remember the last time I was in the dining hall "ithout hearing such com­ments from women as, "What is that girl wear­ing? How slutty." 
"Look at her ­she's anorexic." 
"Too much makeup. Where does she think she is?" 
"I wonder if our hateful comments towards mem­bers of our own sex are really a reflection of our own insecurities stemming from internalized unreal­istic expectations imposed by a male­dominated society ... ooh, Yo-cream!" 
Okay, I only wish I had heard that last one. The point is, girls, with the help of some wack gender norms and a prevailing fear of what women could become when freed from these norms, have painted themselves (and their nails) into a tight corner. 
So here's my dilemma. It's freezing out­side, and I want to go to the dining hall. I could dress comfortably in sweat pants and be judged by male Domers (all in sweat pants) as a typical ugly, definitely­not-going-to-put-out-tonight Notre Dame prude (and !just wanted a taco stick). Or, I could perform the feminine, face the cold and wear a skirt, only to be judged by my sweat-pant clad sisters (and I just wanted to look nice). And, of course, if I decide to stay home and write a column about this wacky situation, I'll be labeled as femi-nazi (whatever that means) les­
bian who only spells women with a 
"y." What's a girl to do? So yeah, it's hard being a chick. My Church makes it 
dillicult. guys make it diffi­cult, girls make it difTicult and all that bleeding 

makes it difficult (Honestly, what is the deal with that?). I don't 
pretend to know how to solve this problem, but l 'm hoping in tli'e future we can all be open to dialogue, to 

expressions of woman­hood that are more attainable and desirable than the options currently available. I think it would be really cool if I could walk around campus without being the object of a. condescending gaze, male or female, if I could just 
be who I wanted to be, wear what I wanted to wear, write what I wanted to write. For now though, I gotta go. Who has time to write when there are legs to be shaven?

Can a preventive war be just? 
The U.S. government reportedly may drop its federal court prosecution of Zacarias Moussaoui, "the 20th hijacker," and try him instead in a military tribunal lo avoid giving him access to al Qaeda prisoners. The tri­bunals, with limit­ed procedural rights for defen­dants, were estab­lished by President Bush to try non-cit­izens for terrorist violations of "the laws of war and other applicable laws." They are constitutional, and would be so even to try U.S. citizens. under Congress' power to punish offens­es against the "law of nations." 
If Moussaoui did what his indictment alleges, he was an enemy combatant vio­lating I.he laws of war. lie should have been tried in a military tribunal rather than in a civilian court as if Sept. 11 had involved only ordinary domestic homi­cides. I !is possible transfer to a military tribunal reminds us that, regardless of Iraq, we already have a major-andjust -war on our hands, against Islamic ter­rorists. If there is a significant connection between Iraq and terrorists an attack on 

Iraq could be justified as an aspect of that just war. 
The "just war" theory is a method of moral reasoning to prevent war and to minimize its effects if it does occur. The requirements for )us ad bellum, justice in going to war, are; proper authority, just cause and right intention. The Catechism lists further details; "ITlhe damage intlict­ed by the aggressor must be lasting. grave and certain;" war must be a last resort, with "all other means impractical or inef­fective;" "there must be serious prospects of success;" and "the use of arms must not produce evils graver than the evil to be eliminated." Jus in bello, justice in fighting a war, requires proportionality and dis­crimination (non-combatant immunity from intentional attack). 
Pope John Paul II ha:s emphasized, with reference to Iraq, that war "is always a defeat for humanity" and cannot be waged "except as the very last option and in accordance with very strict conditions." On Nov. 13, the U.S. Catholic bishops opposed the Iraq war in a major but guarded statement. They affirmed the fact-dependent nature of the just war cri­teria and the deference owed to the gov­ernment's evaluation. The bishops said "We offer not definitive conclusions, but our serious concerns and questions. People of good will may differ on how to apply just war norms especially when the facts are not altogether clear. Based on the facts that are known to us, we find it difficult to justify the war against Iraq, lacking clear and adequate evidence of an imminent attack of a grave nature." But then the bishops conceded: "There arc no easy answers. Ultimately, our elected leaders are responsible for decisions about national security." Similarly. the Catechism notes that the "evaluation" of the conditions for a just war "belongs to the prudential judgment ofthose who have responsibility for the common good." 
A preventive war is not intrinsically wrong, but it is more difficult to justify. It is debatable whether the administration has disclosed convincing evidence that Iraq aids, or is about to aid, the terror net­work or that Iraq is an imminent threat to the United States. But, as the bishops implicitly acknowledge, the public does not have a right to disclosure of facts where that would be contrary to national security. The governmental decisions here are entitled to the benefit of the doubt up to a point of incredibility that does not appear to have been reached in this case. One factor is that we no longer have an adjudicated liar in the White House. 
In any event. all of this shows the wis­dom of the framers of the Constitution in putting the decision on declaring war in the hands of Congress rather than in one man. The President has a war power, to enable him, as James Madison said, "to repel sudden attacks." Congress, unwisely but probably validly, has authorized the President to decide whether to make war on Iraq. So war or peace will be decided by one man. 
On a positive note, we at Notre Dame can do something real for the cause of peace. "[T]he surest ... way of establishing peace on the face of the earth," said John Paul II. "is through Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament." Eucharistic Adoration is held in Fisher Hall chapel on Mondays and Tuesdays from noon to 10 
p.m. and on Fridays in Sacred Heart Basilica from noon to 5 p.m. Contact Monica Mata at 634-2938 or at smata@nd.edu "The time you spend with Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament," said Mother Teresa of Calcutta, "will help bring about an everlasting peace on earth."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Support for minority recruitment endeavors 
Admission is about the person as well as the score 
I was dismayed to read the short-sided views of fellow Notre Dame students who were opposed to Father Malloy's position in support of the University of Michigan. The whole idea of the admissions process is to invite those who would enhance the community to come. The issue of ranking qualities of applicants seems completely logical because there are a variety of traits that University would like to draw. While it is clear every student needs to put forth significant effort, some factors that con­tribute to one's acceptance are truly beyond one's control. The high socioeco­nomic status of an individual's parents for example, is not within the control of a stu­dent, and yet, is an undeniable factor in acceptance because of the advantages awarded to that student throughout life. 
Supporting Michigan questions what value is placed on certain knowledge, experiences and potential. I do not think the clarity of a differential geometry class with or without minorities present is the issue. The college experience is about preparing individuals for life. In reality, the standardized tests that some praise create a homogeneous environment through tho culturally-biased questioning. To create a diverse environment, it is nec­essary to look at factors besides racially repressive testing that can measure cer­tain skills. We want an excellent educa­tion. but it must contain more than acade­mic knowledge, such as applying a learned mathematical formula. We must learn how to relate to fellow students and individuals who arc not exactly like us. 
If we are cultured in an environment that only praises certain features, we will be at a severe disadvantage after gradua­tion. The consideration of race with a plethora of factors is significant because it facilitates learning varied cultural quali­
ties; although ethnicity should not be the 
sole basis for admittance, one should be 
given value for a feature making one dis­
tinctive. Notre Dame's support for Michigan goes beyond racial barriers and is at the core of the University's traditions. While the legacy tradition could never be chal­lenged in court, it is clearly part of the admissions process and can seemingly admit "less quali­fied" students. However, legacy is simply another component that makes a student distinctive in admis­sions. I think individuals 
are unique because 
of their own accom­
plishments and 
because of God's bless­

ings; the admissions process seems to capital­
ize on both. Admission is not only about scores, but also about the person, his/her experience and what he/she rep­resents. While one's score or GPA might not be as good, that does not neces­
sarily make someone less qualified. One 
may be equally, or more so qualified 
depending on the measuring stick.

Entire community must work to create diversity 
The University of Michigan's affirmative action controversy and the cover story in last week's Scholastic have led me to ponder Notre Dame's recruit­ment of minority students. I applaud the Admissions Office and the Notre Dame Minority Alumni Network, whose recruitment endeavors have been 
instrumental in increasing minority enrollment. But if we really want to make strides in creating more ethnic diversity, it will require recruiting efforts from individual alumni clubs and current 
Notre Dame students at the local level. Admissions staff personally visit many minority students with interest in Notre Dame, says James Riley of the 
Admissions Office and make recruitment stops at "minority feeders," or schools with corps of gifted minority students. Notre Dame minority students, on 
behalf of the Admissions Oflice, and members of the Minority Alumni Network make phone calls to minority high school students to answer questions 
and encourage them to apply to Notre Dame. 
Despite the commendable efforts of these groups, many talented minority students will still have no contact with any representative of Notre Dame. Individual alumni clubs and current Notre Dame students -regardless of race -can help boost 
minority applications by searching their home com­munities for impressive minority students who have not been actively recruited by Notre Dame. Notre 
Dame students and local alumni can personally visit these minority students, and alumni clubs can attract minority applicants by creating minority scholarship funds. A minority high school student is more likely to consider Notre Dame if he receives encouragement from respected individuals in his home community. Notre Dame alumni and we students must recognize the importance of increasing ethic diversity at our University. 
A 1996 survey by the Noire Dame Office of Institutional Research found that 89 percent of minority alumni were either generally or very satis­fied with their Notre Dame education. Minority students do thrive at Our Lady's school. Let"s support current minority recruitment endeavors and put forth our own efforts to increase minority enrollment here. The task of creat­ing greater diversity on this campus falls upon the entire Notre Dame family.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Cat Power is purrrrty good 
By JOSE deWIT Scene Music Critic 
It has been five years since Cat Power's last release of original material and three years since their last release altogether ­a well-performed collection of covers -so, understandably. their new album, You are Free, arrives charged and burdened with long-standing and welf-settled expecta­tions. Whetl1er it lives up to its demanding expectations is a question that is unfairly severe for any artist, and its answer is unfairly impetuous when it is demanded of an album this fresh. 
This is especially the case when tbe artist in question is Cat Power and the album in question is a.s moving and mature as this one: alongside Cat Power's earlier albums, You are Free is a flower. and to appreciate it in a light so harsh as this. without allow­ing its delicate beauty and subtle profundi­ty to develop and emerge from its rosebud and shine in its own right, would be care­less and presumptuous. 
Cat Power is the vehicle for the singing and songwriting of Chan Marshall, the daughter of a traveling pianist from the South. She left high school to pursue her own musical talent and began to establish her own reputation after making a name for herself as an opening act for Uz Phair. Her fame grew steadi­ly, helped along by the support of several big names -such as the drummer from Sonic Youth, Steve Shelley. who became part of her backing band -but most­ly on account of her beautiful. melancholy voice and her unques­tionable song­writing talent. Her backing band has changed since those days. but You are Free remains faithfully strong but gentle, true to the powerful, effective. yet delicate style that has been representative of Cat Power as it has developed over the span of her past five albums. 
You are Free begins as gently as it ends, with a slow, soft piano-driven track along­side Marshall's deeply emotional, expres­sive and affecting voice. Slow, soft and gen­tle describe the first track accurately, but "I Don't Blame You" is everything but sooth­ing. Marshall's voice is coarse and hesitant, though it remains as clear and flawless a.c; in any of her other songs. It is accompa­nied by a simple piano progression that is as tremulous and uncertain as her singing throughout the piece that gives the song au eerily troubled, fragile mood which bestows on the listener a sense of a certain longing. 
This saddened mood, however, does not last long. The album's spirits are uplifted with the upbeat, energetic "Free." "Free" is easily the mosl spirited out of a handful of more dynamic. animated songs that are peppered throughout the album. It stands out, bursting with vigorous, anthemic lyrics and a simple, vibrant sequence of chords on distortion guitar. 
This louder, more raucous, more hard­rocking side of Cat Power -reminiscent of their style on earlier albums -reappears on the darker, slower fourth track "Speak for Me," whlch finds Marshall's singing in the most furiously passionate of its moods. This same style is present in the faster­moving, angrier seventh track "He War" and the slower, drum-driven bitterness of the eight track "Shaking Pape1:,.. in which 
the frantic, quivering tears of the lead guitar, which trem bles in and out of hear­ing through the song, appearing less and less as until it dis­appears toward the end. betrays as much des­peration and pain as Marshall's voice in the song. 
The major ity of the album is more akin to Cat Power's la.c;t collection of original material 
· Moon Pix, in 

w h i c h Marshall's lonesome, forlorn singing asserts itself as the vital and defining ele­ment in the band and is accompanied almost entirely by her own work on the piano or guitar. 
This style is at once the album's strongest element and its greatest short­coming. On one hand, the solitary voice along the simple piano and guitar work is what gives it its characteristic and singular sad, lonely, melancholy mood. Its stark, simple style gives You are Free its intimate, personal character, not only in its wistful, bittersweet sadness and its somber, brood­
ing tension 




and angst, but also in its cathartic, reflective earnestness and its frag­ile, delicate gentleness. Marshall sings a beau­tiful, cathar­tic song about frus­trated love in the third track, " G o o d Woman." "Nan1es," the 11th song on t h e album, is a slow. s a d . painful s o n g about c h i l d abuse that is agonizing a n d beautiful at once. It leaves a throbbing ache, felt in the very pit of the stom­ach, that lingers a r t e r e a c h excruci­ating lis­t e n . 0th er tracks shine in t h i s album, like the lonely, emotive, broken­hearted, yet hopeful, "Maybe Not," the resigned, frustrated hopefulness of "Fool," and "Werewolf," a despondent, miserable ballad about ic,olation, loneliness and alien­ation. 

There are some points where You are Free tends to falter, lacking direction and energy. While the album is mostly consis­tent in the rhythm and progression of its songs and it maintains itc; pace elegantly, there are places where it appears to stum­ble and lose the energy it has built up along its course. It is at these points where it seems drained and jaded and feels like it is barely stumbling along 
In some parts, particularly in the latter half of the songs, the album seems ram­bling, weak and sleepy, lacking direction and force and leaving the listener weary, unengaged and eventually uninterested. Barely lasting more than two minutes, "Baby Doll" seems to wind on indefinitely, making for a restless, tedious comedown after the rush of the euphoric fury of "He War" and the trembling bitterness of "Shaking Paper." "Half of You," a short, folksy, cute-sweet-love-ballad," could be bearable or maybe even pleasant if it weren't followed by the hypnotically repeti­tive "Keep on Runnin'." "Keep on Runnin"' is an endless, uninteresting, wailing piece that winds along tediously for an unneces­sary four minutes. This is a shame, because the combination of these two lack­luster songs leave the listener too disen­gaged from the album to enjoy "Evolution," a calm, dreamy. melancholy song that expresses the common mood of the album beautifully -a piece that would otherwise have shown to be a tender, placid and pow­erful culmination for the work. 
You are Free invites the listener to take its songs in with a calm mind, closed eyes, a silent, open heart, and careful. patient P.ars. It allows the listener to come and sit in its shade and appreciate its beauty along with its sorrow and its hope. And while it shows at times that shade is just as good for sleeping as it i,; for thinking, feeling and resting the heart, and while it seems like the shade of its more unexciting pieces tends to overshadow some of its more beautiful material, You are Free is definite­ly not an easy listen. 
It is diflicult to take in attentively at first. Its delicate nature contains much of its beauty more subtly than many audiences are used to hearing, and many of these treasures cannot be found without careful appreciation, and a subtle and contempla­tive mood. Marshall is an extraordinarily gifted songwriter with a strikingly versa­tile, expressive and beautiful voice. As an interpreter of emotional, heartfelt, heart­breaking, heart-mending songs about love, passion, pain, forgiveness, people, self and meaning, Marshall is almost unparalleled in talent. 
Next to her, most other women singer/songwriters seem shallow, melodra­matic, wailing, moaning. whining, cater­wauling, unauthentic, fabricated, plastic, superficial divas. She is at once profound and accessible, gentle and forceful, angry and forgiving, calm and passionate, soft and resounding, unassuming and over­whelming, and she's pretty cute -and if that doesn't make Cat Power's You are Free worth giving a listen or two, well sweetheart, nothing will.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Walkinen blend only the best 
By BJ STREW 
Scene Music Criric 
No desire is more natural than the desire f'or good new music. Some might say that these guys remind them of a more refmed Strokes, some might counter that they sound more like early U2. There's a shade of truth to both claims, but The Walkmen have a unique sound that builds on the two, and easily surpasses both. 
They're newer. 
They're better. 
This band is essentially a group of friends, who after a mediocre foray in major "labeldom," have come together to record their own album. Thank God the ex-Jonathan Fire*Eater crowd jettisoned their sound when they left Drcamworks, opting to follow the indie route: producing their own album out of their own Manhattan studio, Marcata Recording, with leftover funds from a Dreamworks advance. 
Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me is Gone is the result of that work. It is anoth­er example of the gorgeous order spiraling out of the din, the scenester maelstrom of New York City. Like their art-rock com­rades Interpol, The Walkmen furnish their album with a smooth consistency, simplici­ty, a distinct mood and feel, yearning vocals courtesy of erstwhile Recoys front­man Hamilton Leithauser and their trade­mark upright piano. The Walkmen gradu­ally build effectual melodic concoctions from very simple foundations in a way that often hits you just before it leaves you. 
Things start rolling with the pounding, droning, melancholy momentum of "They're Winning." The two-minute opener emerges with a gen­tle crescendo of a single piano note followed by quickly, steadily strummed guitar and plodding bass, each shifting chords infre­quently, while the drums and cymbals sound slightly louder with each beat. Leithauser enters halfway through the song with his idiosyncratic billowing and trembling voice. A few sec­onds after The Walkmen 
reach the harmonic

eerily reverberate against the vocal pinning, the song is over. Naturally, one is left wanting to hear more. 
From the beginning of "Wake Up," com­plimenting the punctuated, then rolling drum beats and abbreviated, strumming guitar, the piano dreamily plays a counter­melody. which Leithauser sings against. The combined effect feels like a break­through: The Walkmcn reach new musical ground through familiar and simple meth­ods. 
Leithauser's athletic delivery straddles the sonic fence between Casablanca,; and Bono: a vigorous. slurred wail that blends perfectly with the ringing guitar chords. And the songwriting is deft, but never overwrought. Their songs wrestle with the classic problems of anxiety and isolation, helping mold the tone of jaded nonconfor­mity -reactions to the current era' s bleak consumerism. 


Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me is Gone is a stunning album, brimming with stark splendor, sounding warmer, lusher and more natural than everything else out there right now. On this debut, The Walkmen deftly unite radio-friendly hooks and structure with less conventional. more atmospheric songs. as well as combine a sense of elegy and entropy throughout. 
They prove they arc more than guitar­heavy prep school art-rock. They are more than The Cure meets Joy Division meHL'i Hadiohead meets Pavement meets U2 meets the Strokes meets whatcver-the­hype-unfairly-says. They are what Notre Dame needs to listen to. They arc a good new band.

Irish narrowly lose to Wildcats 
ByJOE LINDSLEY 
Spom Writer 
Once again, it was a close match for the Irish. 
With Notre Dame leading 3-2, and lhe final two matches near completion. No. 44 Notre Dame was on the verge of an upset victory over No. 40 Northwestern Saturday. With a victory by either freshman Patrick Buchanan or sopho­more Luis Haddock in those last matches, the Irish would have earned their first upset win of the season. . 
But the Wildcats hung on. Tommy Ilanus topped Haddock in a closely contested 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (3-7), 7-5 triumph, tying the score. Thon, seconds later, Buchanan fell, as did the hopes for an Irish victory, as Adam Schaechtorle won 6-7 (6-8), 6-3. 7-6 (7-3). Northwestern won 4­3. 
Against Michigan State Wednesday, Haddock had saved the day for the Irish with his victory in the linal match. After fighting for a long time Saturday though, he could not do the same against I!anus. 
"I had a pretty tough match," Haddock said. "I couldn't put it together at the end." 
Last season, the Irish were 10-0 at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. This spring, they are 0-5. But the Irish, 3-6 overall, began the day with the hope of winning their first home victory of the season. 
"It's pretty surprising that we actually have a better record on the road right now," Haddock said. "The past few years here at home we were unbeatable." 
The Irish have seen some tough competition at home, though, and have suffered a few dose losses. Notre Dame start­ed to turn around a season that began 0-4. and the team secs signs of improvement. 
"We're definitely playing bet­ter than we did at the beginning of the year," Haddock said. "I thought we played a pretty good match !Saturday]. We put our­selves in the position to win." 
For example, for only the third time this spring season, Notre Dame claimed the dou hies point, to go ahead 1-0. 
Junior Matt Scott and sopho­more Brent D'Amico upset Scaechterle and Josh Axler, ranked 31st nationally in dou­bles. Then, after a loss by juniors Nicolas Lopez-Acevedo and Ben Hatten, the_ Irish took the doubles point with the 8-6 victory by Haddock and senior tri-captain Brian Farrell. 
Although winning the doubles points. in Haddock's words, "makes a huge difference," the Wildcats came back. D'Amico was defeated for only the sec­ond time during the spring sea­son as Axler won, 6-1, 6-3. Farrell and Scott brought the score to 3-1 with their victories. Farrell defeated Chuck Perrin, 6-4, 6-2, and Scott, ranked 119th in the nation, triumphed over Jackie Jenkins, 6-2, 7-6 (7­4).

In a weekend of play that included bouts with three top 25 teams, the 19th ranked Irish were jostled a little as they added three l_osses to their record. 
Notre Dame was edged 4-3 by both No. 25 Kentucky and No. 11 Tennessee, on Monday and Sunday. respectively. Before· their southern road trip, the Irish were defeated 5­2 by Duke, the nation's No. 1 team. 
"It was definitely a little dis­appointing," junior Alicia Salas said. "(Although] we knew we were playing top teams." 
The Irish began well against Kentucky as they claimed the doubles point_ There were some good moments in singles, too, with junior Caylan Leslie upsetting No. 48 Nathalie Roels, 6-3, 6-4, and freshman Kristina Statsny winning over Shannon Stafford. 6-4, 6-1. lt was Leslie's third singles victo­ry of the weekend. 
"We played a lot better in doubles . . . but we fell short in singles," Sa.las said. 
Salas was defeated by No. 34 Sarah Witten, 6-1, 6-2. Senior captain Katie Cunha, sopho­more Sarah Jane Connelly and freshman Lauren Connelly were all defeated in straight sets also. 
The doubles point was a high point for the Irish Monday. 

"The first day, what was disappointing against Tennessee was losing the dou­bles point," Salas said. "That could have made a difference in the match for sure." 
Against the Volunteers. the duo of Cunha and Statsny upset the 22nd-ranked pair in the nation, 8-6. The previous day Cunha and Statsny also defeated Duke's Hillary Adams and Kelly McCain, ranked 13th nationally. 


The Irish went into Friday's match with Duke with the atti­tude that they had nothing to lose, and the 5-2 loss was not entirely disappointing. 
According to Salas, the matches with Tennessee and Kentucky were "improved, but at the same time disappoint­ing." 
The Irish have more tough competition looming ahead, with No. 42 Wake Forest and No. 14 Texas coming to the Eck Pavilion Friday and Saturday, respectively. The team hopes to use their experi­ences from last weekend's tough slide to turn potentially close matches into Irish victo­ries. 
"These were two of our clos­est matches of the year," Salas said. "Being a young team we just learn a lot by getting in these close matches, realizing how important the doubles point is. If we win the doubles point. [we have to] realize that it's still very possible to lose the singles."

Irish lose 3 to top 25 teams 
Basketball author signing at Hammes 
Special to The Observer 
The author of a newly released book about the rigors of coaching college basketball will be autographing books at the Hammes bookstore Tuesday. 
Brian Curtis wrote his book, "The Men of March: A season Inside the Lives of College Basketball Coaches," by fol­lowing four Division 1 mens basketball coaches during last year's season. Notre Dame coach Mike Brey was one of those coaches and his experi­ences are recorded through­out Curtis' book . 
The first chapter involving Brey explains the nerve­wracking week that led up to the hiring of Matt Dougherty as Notre Dame head coach in 1999. 
The book goes on to tell about Brey's eventual hiring at Notre Dame and the ups and downs of the 2001 -02 Irish season. 
The book also describes the experiences of Iowa's Steve Alford. UCLA's Steve Lavin and lllinios's Bill Self during last season. 
At points in the book, Curtis 
weaves different coaching examples from the four coach­es and compares and con­trasts them. 
He also shows how Brey and the other three handled slumping players and mistakes while coaching. 
Curtis has received praise from numerous sports figures and commentators across the country, including Bob Costas, Lee Fowler and Seth Davis of Sports Illustrated. 
"Brian Curtis has put togeth­er a rare, insightful and thor­oughly reported look at the highest levels of college bas­ketball. Anyone who watches and follows college hoops is going to love this book," Davis said. 
Curtis wrote this book by fol­lowing all four coaches around duriltg their preseason, regu­lar season, conference tourna­ments and finally into the NCAA tournament. 
He takes turns describing the series of triumphs and struggles each coach and his respective team go through as the season moves forward. 
He will be signing his book for most of the day Tuesday.

first half, running up and down the court for easy layups, while coercing the Irish into playing their up-tempo style of play. 
"Certainly I take my hat off to Connect.icut, J thought they played fabulous basketball." Irish coach Mike Brey said. "They really had us back on our heels in the rrrst half. They hurt us early with layups, then we adjusted a little bit and then they're drilling threes. I don't think we can take both away with [their] kind ofspeed." 
Anderson provided much of the spark for Connecticut in the first half when he drilled 5 of 7 3-pointers and had 15 points at halftime. The Huskies also got significant contributions from Marcus White, who grabbed 14 rebounds in a reserve role. 
"We get contributions from different people at different times and that really makes it special," Calhoun said. "Of all the wins this year, clearly the kids were happiest with this win. This was on the road, in a tough environment against an awfully good basketball team that can do some very good things. We were able to impose our quickness on them tonight." 
Matt Carroll led the Irish with 28 points, while Chris Thomas added 19. 
"You tip your hat off to them. They played a hell of a game," Carroll said. 'Tm proud of our team, I think we made a nice run in the second half, but it's tough especially against a team like UConn when you get down that many to comeback and try and get a win." 
Notre Dame actually jumped out to an early 15-8 lead on 3­pointers from Carroll and Thomas. But the Huskies quick­ly turned that deficit into a big lead by ripping off a 38-16 run to end the half. Anderson led the charge. knocking down five 3­pointers, despite playing just 10 minutes in the half. His trey with 
11:12 left in the first half gave Connecticut a lead they would not relinquish. 
As the Connecticut run contin­ued throughout much of the first half, Notre Dame became increasingly frustrated with their opponent and the referees. Thomas became especially upset after no foul was called when he attempted a layup with just less than eight minutes left in the half. Thomas argued his case before a television timeout and then added a few more comments after the timeout. That extra jawing got him a technical foul 
The Huskies stretched their advantage to 17 in the early moments of the second half before the Irish started to crawl back into the game. Notre Dame cut the lead to 10 with 14:12 left in the game, before Anderson drained his sixth 3-pointer of the game. 
But Notre Dame wouldn't quit and got the lead down to 10 again at 63-53 when the Connecticut bench picked up a technical foul after Carroll had been fouled. The Irish got their best free-throw shooter on the line for four straight shots and Carroll hit them all. Suddenly Notre Dame was within six points. 
After Okafor missed a jumper on Connecticut's next posses­sion, Dan Miller drilled a 3­pointer to get Notre Dame with­in three at 63-60. Connecticut scored the next five points before Miller hit another 3­pointer to cut the Irish deficit to two. 
But Notre Dame would get no closer as Connecticut scored the next seven points and hung on to win by eight.

poorly -or as well -as the 
Irish played Monday night, 
Connecticut was simply that 
much better. Yet Notre 
Dame still lost because it 
dug itself a hole two points 
too big. 
When the Huskies nearly doubled Notre Dame's offen­sive output after the first television timeout, the Irish couldn't respond. First, the Huskies sliced through the lane by scoring lay-up after lay-up. Then, when the Irish buckled down into the lane, Connecticut made them pay from behind the arc. 
When the Irish needed a defensive stop, they couldn't get it. When they needed a momentum-changing bas­ket, they couldn't get it. 
And it didn't help that the SWAT team lent Emeka Okafor to the Huskies for the season. 
"Every time we came down to hit a shot, it felt like they came down and hit two -and a lot of those were threes," said Matt Carroll. who watched his chances of going undefeated at home disappear faster than the Joyce Center crowd in the waning minutes of Monday's game. 
The wheels finally came off the bus when Thomas thought he got fouled on a lay up, but didn't get the call. He lazily jogged down the court, watched Ben Gordon drill a 3-pointer to give the Huskies a 30-23 lead, watched Mike Brey call a 30-second timeout, then came back on the court and watched an official serve him a technical foul. 
Thomas then spent the next five minutes watching from the bench. Big Monday appeared close to becoming Black Monday. 
"We weren't composed to make a run in the first half," Brey said. "It was going to come in the second." 
And come it did. The Irish came out of the locker room like a different team and whittled a lead that got as big as 17 points down to a two-point game. Thomas, who played a key part in Notre Dame's dismal first

half, scored 10 points as Notre Dame cut what was once a runaway game into a 68-66 nail biter. 
Yet Notre Dame, weary from trying to come back against a team with a signif­icant quickness advantage, never scored that final bas­ket. 
That's often the story of Notre Dame's season so far. They're brilliant most of the time. They're discombobu­lated some of the time. And when they get out of sync, that's when Notre Dame games quickly become excit­ing for opposing fans. 
Figuring out what makes Notre Dame tick is difficult, and figuring out what throws them off-balance is even tougher. But it's obvi­ous when the Irish are rolling and when they aren't. 
Throughout the season, the Irish have a tendency to get hot early, then tem­porarily wilt while the oppo­sition mounts a brief come­back before pulling away for the victory in the final min­utes of a game. To Notre Dame's credit, its six losses have come against high-cal­iber teams. 
But in the NCAA Tournament, every team is a high-caliber team. And if the Irish can't figure out a way to play "Notre Dame basket­ball" for 40 minutes, as every player described Notre Dame's second-half output, then they'll be watching the second week­end of the tournament from their dorm rooms. 
The Irish played like a first-round washout the first half. They transformed into a Final Four-caliber team for most of the second. 
If the Irish decipher the difference between the two teams, they'll be playing games through late March. 
The Irish valiantly tried to come back and win against the Huskies. But "it seemed like they always had an answer," Carroll said. 
Even as his team searched for its own.

FENCING 
Irish finish season 
ByMAITLOZAR 
Sports Editor 
With the competition at the Michigan State Duals being lower than what the Irish usually see, coach Janusz Bednarski made his lineups with the future in mind -both this year and next year. 
Bednarski used a combi­nation of the regular fencers along with the walk-ons as the mens and womens fenc­ing squads went 4-0 to com­plete their regular seasons. 
"We are usuaJiy relying on them [the walk-ons] heavi­ly," Bednarski said. "Even in some cases, we are giving the back-up fencers the ability to learn for next year which is crucial since we are losing seven seniors. l sacrificed some results to give them the opportuni­ties." 
Those seven seniors, Ozren Debic, Gabor Szelle, Matt Fabricant, Jan Viviani, Anna Carnick, Meagan Call and Liza Boutsikaris com­bined for a 32-1 record in their last regular season meet. 
Debic's 43-1 season gave him the fifth best single sea­son winning percentage (. 977) and he finished third (.952) on the career winning percentage list. Szelle ended his career with the sixth most regular-season wins 
(182) in Notre Dame history. Debic and Viviani finished with the best career win­ning percentages in their respective weapons. 
Carnick finished her career with 179 wins, which puts her 10th on the wom­ens overall wins list and third on the epee list. Call and Boutsikaris tied for 11th on the womens list with 168 wins.

freshman, Pierce was a phe­nom in the 155-pound weight division. But Pierce was stopped short of fighting his way out of the Joyce Fieldhouse when he lost in the semifinals. 
As a sophomore, Pierce again blazed his way through the 155-pound weight divi­sion. But this time there was no roadblock in his path to the second dome of the Joyce Centor. Pierce earned a spot in the finals and was victori­ous before a large crowd. In the two short years since he picked up a pair of boxing gloves, Pierce adroitly parried and pummeled his way to the top of his weight class. 
But Pierce disappeared from the campus's boxing elite as quickly as he had appeared on it. Neither an injury nor a precipitous decline in skills were to blame, as Pierce spent the boxing season abroad during his junior year. The decision lo bypass defending his title was not an easy one. 
"It was tough," Pierce said. "I wanted to stay and fight but it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to go abroad." 
Now a senior, he has faced a long road back in order to capture another title. The journey spanned two conti­nents. one ocean and a jump in weight class. Now boxing in the 160-pound weight divi­sion, he has had lo adjust his style. 
"There are taller guys ­I'm not tall," Pierce said. "I need to fight low, work the opponent's body .and wear him down." 
Pierce was successful so far, defeating Jesse Shallcross 1 minute, 28 seconds into the first round during his opening 

match Sunday. Pierce found it tough to gage how far away he was from peaking due to the abbreviated fight. He finds scouting other fighters to be of little use as well. 
"With all the training, you never know how you'll do until you get out there," Pierce said. "Seeing oppo­nents fight doesn't help much because they'll fight different­ly against me." 
With the semifinals on Wednesday, Pierce has been able to shed his teaching role and concentrate mainly on fighting. As a captain, he taught novices the basics of fighting in the fall and helped lead the other boxers in 
workouts during the spring. He has advice for any stu­dents considering boxing next year. 
"Definitely give it a shot," Pierce said. "My main goal this year was to pass on to the younger guys how much fun I've had with the cama­raderie and hard work ethic. There's also a higher purpose with the money that we donate to Bangladesh. Our chaplain reminds us before each fight that it doesn't mat­ter how we do, because we are already champions."

Irish start season with tough games 
By AARON RONSHEIM 
Spom Writer 

After a rain-drenched week­end at the NFCA Leadoff Classic, in which the No. 23 Irish played only three games instead of the scheduled five, it looked like the sun would shine on the Irish as they led No. 17 Alabama 4-0 going into the sev­enth inning on Sunday after­noon. 
Irish pitcher Steffany Stenglein retired the first two batters before lightning struck as the Crimson Tide scored seven runs before the inning was over. 
"Against Alabama we played a great 6 2/3 innings," Irish head coach Deanna Gumpf said. "We were one out away from keeping them scoreless and we let the gates open and from there they took over. We hit well, we pitched well. and we played defense real well for 6 2/3 innings. We just have to finish it." 
Alabama first basemen Jackie McClain started the scoring in the seventh with a three-run homer that brought the Crimson Tide within one. Coach Gumpf responded by making a pitching change as she brought in freshman Heather Booth to get the last out After a walk, Alabama out­fielder Jackie Wilkins hit a two­run home run to put the Tide in front 5-4. Alabama would score two more runs in the inning before the Irish recorded the third out. 

After rain postponed all of Friday's action, the Irish took the field Saturday to face No. 4 California, the defending national champions. Soon the Irish found them down 2-0, when Bearcat catcher Courtney Scott drilled a two-run homer over the left field wall in the first inning. 
In the bottom of second, the Bearcats would score four runs on only two hits, and took advantage oftwo Irish errors..

"Against Cal, we didn't get it done defensively," said Cumpf. "And when your pitching isn't consistent and you don't get it done defensively you are not going to win a ball game," 
Notre Dame's only scoring chance came in the top of the third when the Irish loaded the bases with one out. But California pitcher Kristina Thurson struck out pinch hitter Carrie Wisen and induced shortstop Andria Bledsoe to pop up to end the inning. 
After facing Cal the Irish squared off against Illinois State on Saturday afternoon. This game materialized into a pitcher's duel as Illinois State's Corey Harris and Notre Dame's Heather Booth both posted zeros on the scoreboard through seven innings. 
In the sixth inning rain came down for the second time, as the game was postponed until Sunday morning. 
In the bottom of the eighth inning the Irish would finally score when center fielder Megan Ciolli doubled into left field to plate Llz Hartmann. 
Booth finished the game with eight shutout innings, along with eight strikeouts, as she improved to 3-1 on the young season. 
Even though the Irish are 3-4 in the young season they have been playing some. of the top teams in country. 
Cumpf thinks that these early tough games will help the Irish down the road as they look to improve on last year's result, a loss to Nebraska in the Regional final. 
"We play this tough schedule for a reason," Gumpf said. "These are the teams we will face in the regional tournament to get to the College World Series and we need to find out what we need to do to beat them. Can we get there? Absolutely."

Belles look to beat 
the Flying Dutch 
By HEATHER VAN 
HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's has not had the season that it hoped for, howev­er, their first-round matchup tonight with nationally ranked Hope in the MIAA tournament gives them a perfect opportunity to turn a negative into a positive. 
The task at hand is great for the Belles (6-19. 2-12). as they face the Flying Dutch (25-0. 14­0), who have proved to be a force to be reckoned with nationally. as d3hoops.com ranks them sec­ond in the colliltry. They average 
78.7 points and 44.9 rebounds per game. 
Hope is led by a balanced attack that features Amanda Kerkstra. (16.3 points, 9.3 rebounds per game). who shoots 57 percent from the field. and Amy Balthmanis (9.6 points. 3.9 assists per game). 
Saint Mary's will counter with offensive firepower of their own, led by sophomore Emily Creachbaum, who averages 12.4 points and 5.8 rebounds per game, on 49 percent shooting. Next up in the scoring depart­ment are freshmen Bridget Boyce (7.2 points per game). and Anne Hogan (7 points, 4.6 rebounds per game). 
However, the last time these two teams met on Feb. 5, Saint Mary's had many troubles on offense, as the Belles shot only 21 percent from the field, opposed to the Flying Dutch's stellar 51 percent shooting. Regardless. Saint Mary's is excit­ed to play tonight. 
"The only way to go into this game is with the idea that we have nothing to lose," coach Suzanne Bellina said. "The last time we went up there, we left with a really good feeling." 
Bellina was referring to the last time these two teams met, when Saint Mary's was only down 33­25 at the half, despite losing 77 ­37. 
However, the Belles are ready to play, as seniors Kristen Matha and Shaun Russell look to finish out their careers on a high note. Russell, (6.2 points per game). who averaged 15 points in her last two outings, is playing extremely well for Saint Mary's. 
"Our team knows anything is possible," Bellina said. "That's why you play the game." 
The eighth-seeded Belles face the top-seeded Flying Dutch at 
7:30 p.m. at Hope College, in Holland, Mich.

Ramsey falls just short of qualifying 
By ERIK POWERS Sporrs W ricer 

After six months, 11 meets, three school records and one MIAA championship, Megan Ramsey's season is finally over. 
The SMC swimming star start­ed strong at this weekend's NCAA qualifying meet but was unable to muster a final burst of energy in order to earn a spot in next month's championships. 
Ramsey took third in the 100 butterfly Friday, but did not have a fast enough time for the national cutoff. Ramsey was quick from the beginning, reach­ing beyond her previous limits in order to eclipse her best previ­ous pace by .2 seconds at the 75­yard mark. Her body could not match her mind's determination for much longer, and Ramsey's pace slowed precipitously. 
"I felt strong and powerful at first, then I felt like I was lucky to get my arms out of the water the rest of the way." Ramsey said. 
Her coach, Greg Petcoff, offered a similar view of the race. 
"I think the first 75 was a lot of heart, and the last 25 was a lot of pain from the season," Petcoff said. "A season of training and meets just hit her right there." 
After Ramsey's record-setting race at the MICA championships the previous weekend. she advanced into uncharted waters for Saint Mary's. Petcoff designed his conditioning pro­gram to have his swimmers peak at conference and was unsure of how Ramsey would taper at the qualifying meet. Friday's race confirmed .that Petcoff had his swimmers peaking at just the right time, even if the summit lasted for only one weekend. 
In her other race, Saturday's 200 butterfly, Ramsey decided to start refining her stroke for next year. Ramsey experimented with counting her strokes and attempting to get more distance with each arm. While the changes weren't good enough for her to qualify, she nonethe­1ess finished in a promising eighth place. 
"The 200 was interesting," Ramsey said. "My times were down and we realized that I wasn't going to make the cut. so Petcoff had me try something new." 
Now that the season is over, Ramsey is experjencing mixed feelings. She will miss the cama­raderie and security of the past few months, but she appreciates the rest. 
"The end of the year is bitter­sweet," Ramsey said. "We're like a family with the time that we spend together everyday. It will be nice to have the break -we need it mentally and physically, but I'll miss the faces."

who are closest to you. Admit that you're not always right. *** 
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Do what needs to be done so that you don't upset 
anyone who is counting on you. Someone you have become friends with 
probably has a greater interest in you than you think. Be careful how you treat 
this new friend. ** 

CANCER (June 21-July 22): Take the initiative and do as much as you can 
when it comes to work. Your job will be much easier if you empower people 
instead ofcomplaining. *** 

LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): This is a great day to have some fun. Make plans to do 
things with good friends, your lover or even family members. You'll find out 
something new. ***** 

VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Don't be too quick to address emotional issues. 
Busy yourself with programs that will enhance your looks, make you feel good 
about yourself and in general will keep you out of trouble. ** LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Someone you meet at a group meeting will share some valuable information with you. Getting out and mingling with others will 
broaden your outlook and open up doors. ** 
SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Don't let anyone talk you into slacking or taking 
time off on such a productive day. You will feel so much better if you can get 
things out of the way. *** 

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): You'll want to be involved in .... 
everything and in a position of control. However, if you become difficult to deal with, you may end up being shut out of a leadership position. ** CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Your detennination coupled with your ability to observe others will help you get to the bottom of things as well as reach your set goals for the day. You may want to consider taking a different course of 
action.*** 

AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Don't bog yourself down doing too much for 
everyone else. Ask for help. Spend time in the company of people you enjoy 
being around. ****
