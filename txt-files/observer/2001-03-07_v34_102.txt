Diversity Board's accomplishments in question 
By MYRA McGRIFF 
Nev.s Writer 
As elections for the Student Diversity Board approach, the Board's accomplishments are in the spotlight. 
The Student Diversity Board set out to bring a cul­tural awareness on campus when it began in the fall of 2000, but people on campus have different ideas as to whether the Board accomplished as much as it could have and what it needs to do in the future. 
"Through co-sponsorship, doing events we want to educate people. to tell them that there is more to Saint Mary's campus," said Akmaral Omarova. presi­dent of the Student Diversity Board. 
But some students believe the Board has not been educating people on Saint Mary's campus. They do not see the Board focusing on the cultural issues and broadening how students view each other. 
"They focus on other issues but seem to be ignor­ing the racial part that is already here. I see mem­bers of the Board on campus that pass me and still don't talk to me," said Deon Thompson, member of Sisters of Nefertiti. 
Some of the Board's events, such as last semester's Thanksgiving cultural potluck dinner, never came to fruition, once again making it more difficult to edu­cate people about the unique makeup of Saint Mary's campus.

Higher pay leads students off-campus 
By ERIN LaRUFFA 
News Writer 
While many of their peers are working at places like the Huddle Mart or Hesburgh Library. some Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students choose to venture out into the South Bend job market. 
For some, income from off-campus jobs is an important supplement to financial aid. 
Notre Dame sophomore Shana Blair -who receives about $15,000 in scholarships, while the rest of her tuition comes in the form of loans -works at Colorado Steakhouse to cover additional expenses. Blair used to have an on­campus job at the library, but actually makes more money as a waitress. 
"I need to use that money for every day expenses," said Blair. "I couldn't work enough hours at the library." 
However, money stu­dents earn at off-campus jobs can hurt them when they apply for financial aid, a process they must go through yearly. 
Cortney Swift, who works in the Office of Financial Aid as coordinator of the Student Employment Office, explained that there are two types of financial aid. With one form. money comes from Notre Dame, while the other form is work-study aid that is par­tially federally funded. 
No matter what type of aid a student receives, total financial aid ­including loans, scholar­ships, grants and work­study -cannot exceed a certain amount per stu­dent, Swift said. That amount is based on tuition, room and board, books and supplies, expenses and transportation costs. Although the actual amount differs somewhat among students, the aver­age maximum amount this year for a Notre Dame stu­dent is $31,600, according to Swift. 
Money earned at an off­campus job is not counted as part of a student's financial aid, and therefore is not included when figur­ing out the maximum aid a student receives. However, that income does show up on the student's FAFSA application for the follow­ing year. Swift said.

INSIDE COLUMN 

-who's at your table? 

When you visualize Christ's Last Supper with the apostles, what does Christ and the apostles look like? 
For Renee Cox, an African-American artist, she visualized Christ at the Last Supper as a nude 
black woman. Apparently, this is unacceptable to some individuals Nnamely the New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
And how did Giuliani describe the work by Cox entitled "Yo Mama's Last Supper" which was displayed at the Brooklyn Museum of Art? His take on the artwork was, "disgusting," "anti­Catholic" and "outrageous." He also proposed setting up a committee to set "stan­dards of decency" to regulate what kind of work is dis­played at museums receiving public funds. 
Giuliani and the rest of the individuals who are in an uproar over Cox's work are entitled to their opinion, but I think that anti-Catholicism is not at the root of their protests over Cox's nude black Christ. This is misogyny in full force and is indica­tive of the anti-woman discourse that pervades our society. The anti-Catholicism complaint is an attempt to disguise the sexism in these com­ments. 
When I heard Giuliani's comments over the art­work. I was confused at why he chose to label the work "anti-Catholic." I've always been taught that Christ looks like whatever I want Her to look like. For me, Christ is a woman because I can relate best to that image. Christ is routinely por­trayed in primarily black churches as being black. 
Interestingly enough, according to an article in The New York Times, a work that portrayed Christ at the Last Supper that was exhibited earli­er at the same museum (the Brooklyn Museum of Art) did not raise the ire of Giuliani nor garner any sort of comment. Perhaps then it is the race of the Christ figure in Cox's work that bothered Giuliani. 
Whether it is the race, sex, or perhaps both of Cox's image of Christ that disturbs Giuliani, it is clear that he and others upset over Cox's work are threatened because the image of Christ as a black woman challenges the white-male dis­course that dominates Catholicism. 
It's sad that Giuliani cannot see or fathom thinking of Christ as anything other than a white male. Although if he is best able to relate to Christ as a white male, that is his prerogative. However, he should not then call a woman's art­work "outrageous" "disgusting" and "anti­Catholic" when she chooses to visualize Christ as anything other than a white male. As for the "standards of decency" committee that Giuliani wishes to put in place, whose standards will these be? According to Giuliani's standards, Cox's work would not make the cut. Why is it that a nude black woman portrayed as Christ is indecent? 
A news flash for Giuliani: White men do not 
have the monopoly and final say on how people 
choose to visualize Christ. 
When I think of who is at the table in my vision 
of the Last Supper with Christ, I embrace the idea 
of Christ as a woman. And I am sure that She 
would welcome Giuliani and any others at Her 
table. If the Church truly strives to be inclusive, 
then Christ -whether male or female, and of 
any race -should be welcomed.

Syracuse students not invited to Clinton's speech 
SYRACUSE, N.Y. 
Room 4-201 in the Center for Science and Technology had all the familiar surroundings of a Syracuse University classroom. 
An overhead projector stood in a front corner, rows of chairs lined the floor and a wipe-board covered the front wall in the room where Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke Friday about the upstate economy. 
But no students filled this room -they were not invited to Clinton's first visit to Syracuse University after her election. 
"There was a lot of people on campus who worked really hard to get her elected," said Ben Riemer, SU Student Association president. "We were really well connected to the local Hillary campaign." 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY 
Student makes E. coli breakthrough 
STANFORD, Calif. 

Production of penicillin alternative erythromycin has just become quicker and cheaper, thanks to the work of Blaine Pfeifer. a doctoral student in the Chemical Engineeering Department at Stanford University. Pfeifer's research was published in an article in the March 2 issue of Science Magazine. Pfeifer, who is working in the lab of Professor Chaitan Khosla, was able to genetically engineer Escherichia coli bacteria to mass produce the antibi otic by replacing E. coli genes with genetic material from other bacteria. Pfeifer was assisted by postdoc­toral researcher Suzanne Admiraal. Erythromycin is naturally produced by soil bacteria, Saccharopolyspora erythraea, to inhibit nearby bac­teria strains that may compete for resources. The process lacks speed because the S. erythraea popu­lations grow slowly, only doubling every four hours. By contrast. E. coli populations can double in just 20 minutes.

OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY 
Vandals graffiti president's house 
COLUMBUS, Ohio 
Ohio State University administrators were surprised 
as they prepared for work Monday morning. Both 
Bricker Hall and the home of Ohio State President 
William "Brit" Kirwan had graffiti sprayed across 
them, protesting a research project at OSU. Painted 
slogans covered the exterior walls of Bricker Hall, 
which houses the university's administrative offices, 
including Kirwan's office. Vandals also glued the locks 
of the building shut. "There is no way we can tell 
exactly what [the graffiti] means, but it's probably 
referring to ongoing research," Earle Holland, OSU 
spokesman. "Ask Dr. Y Why, Stop the Killing, 
OSU=Profits Over Pain, Stop Killing Cats and 
Cat+Meth=Bad Science" were displayed in large red 
letters covering all four sides of Bricker Hall. "Dr. Y" 
refers to Dr. William Yonushonis, director of laboratory 
animal resources, who has spoken in favor of animal 
testing in research projects conducted at the College of 
Veterinary Medicine.

"The issue is something that affects SU students currently and in the future," said Tim Schlittner, College Democrats president. "It is preposterous." 
Schlittner, a sophomore politcal science major. said he plans to complain about the exclusion of students from Clinton's speech to the event's organizers, including those on campus. 
But a university spokeswoman said the event was not meant for a student audience. 
"It was a very focused thing," said Judy Holmes, who helped organize the event.

Police find alum football player stabbed in burning home 
By MARIBEL MOREY Assistant News Editor 
As a football player at Notre Dame in the late l 940s, Richard Cotter was a hot commodity. "He was quiet and modest and according to all the women the best looking. All the Saint Mary's girls flocked him," said Terence Meany, law partner and friend since the first grade. 
After graduating from Notre Dame, he led a quiet life as a pilot and then later as a law partner and father of 10. 
Now 60 years later, Cotter and his friend, Mary McIntyre were found murdered in 
his Austin, Minnesota home Feb. l 7. 
Stacey Cotter, one of Cotter's adopted sons, has been charged with the killings. 
"Stacey had been involved in other criminal 

acts," Terese Amazi, 
Cotter

Austin chief deputy sher­iff. "Family members are the ones who put us on to him from the very beginning." 
Stacey currently refuses to talk to law enforcement, while the police plans to get him on for first degree murder, said Amazi. 
"There are several [of the children] who've had brushes with law enforce­ment, but he's had the most extensive criminal record," said Amazi. "He is convicted of wrongful imprisonment [kidnapping] and he's a registered sex­offender." 
Under Minnessota law, sex offenders must report all their daily activities at all times, but there might have been

lapses, said Amazi. The prosecutors might be using this point in their inves­tigations. 
Mower County Sherriff Bary Simonson said both 73 year-old Cottter and his longtime friend McIntyre, 68, died of "homicidal violence." Authorities believe the fire that destroyed the home was likely set to cover up evidence. 
Simonson said it appears the fire was intentionally set and might have burned for an hour or two before neighbor Tom Branden called 911 at 5:14 a.m. 
Reports from medical examiners in 
Ramsey County indicate Cotter 
was stabbed to death; however, "they can't determine what caused the death because of the bad con­dition of her body [due to the fire]." said Amazi. 
McIntire was visiting Cotter to help him with his recooperation after a hip replacement surgery in 
December. She was there to help 
him out, said Amazi. 

Cotter and his ex-wife divorced years after raising five adopted children and five children of their own. 
After graduation from Notre Dame in 1951, Cotter returned home to Austin, Minnesota and reunited with old friends. Meany and Cotter continued on to the military. "We started first grade and went to law school together. In the military we were briefly separated because Dick was a pilot," Meany said. 
After the military, Meany and Cotter joined to form their own law firm. Cotter had been an attorney in the Austin area for 40 years, but retired four years ago. "He was still somewhat active as a personal representative for probate matters," said Meany. 

Cotter was actually still working a day before he was found dead..., saw him [in the office] the day before he was murdered. He came into the office and he was talking how well he was doing with his artificial hip he had replaced," said Meany. 
But Meany stresses that Cotter was a quiet man and preferred to be at home rather than socializing and playing golf. 
"While I spent a large part of my life with Dick, he was very quiet," Meany said. "He was a good friend, a goo~ partner and he took care of his family." 
In Notre Dame, Cotter was a reserve halfback/fullback who earned three monograms, one each in 1948, 1949 and 1950. He carried 16 times for 64 yards for the 1949 national champi­onship team, said John Heisler, assis­tant athletic director. "He was also a four-time finalst in the Bengal Bouts." 
The case is still under investigation, and Amazi stresses that it is up to Stacey whether the trial will drag on. "Right now it's up to Stacey if he wants to talk," Amazi said.

But while Hughes expressed no reservations about WRC membership, both Hoye and O'Donoghue said their enthusi­asm about joining the still­fledgling organization comes with some concerns. 
Hoye said the WRC's com­

plaint-based policy of monitor­
ing factories potentially allows 
many sweatshop labor prob­
lems to go unchecked. He also 
voiced concerns about univer­
sities comprising a majority of 
the WRC's membership but 
only a third of the presence on 
the board of directors. 
O'Donoghue raised other 

doubts. 
"I have very serious issues 

with the WRC. There are some 
questionable things about the 
group that still concern me," 
O'Donoghue said, calling the 
WRC decision "a huge leap of 
faith" despite his task force 
vote in favor of joining the con­
sortium. 
O'Donoghue said he doesn't 

foresee WRC membership fur­
thering the University's anti­
sweatshop initiatives but 
rather Notre Dame advancing 
the WRC's global impact.

Notre Dame is currently co­chairs the university advisory council of the watchdog Fair Labor Association (FLA) and continues to study living wage issues in the United States and abroad. 
The University is now estab­lishing a regional watchdog committee for Mexican and Central American factories, making it the only college in the country to have its own monitoring system. 
In June, Notre Dame will also 

become the first university to 
prohibit the manufacture of 
products sporting the Notre 
Dame insignia in countries that 
ban worker's rights to organize 
or form unions. That includes 
China, the second leading 
manufacturer (behind the 
United States) of Notre Dame 
goods. 
Hughes praised the WRC 

decision and other anti-sweat­
sho p efforts but called for 
additional student input on 
future endeavors. 
"If I have one concern about 

Uoining the WRCJ. it's the way 
the decision was handled ­
with minimal student repre­
sentation on the task force," 
Hughes said. 
She said the PSA is willing to 

work with other student orga­
nizations and University offi­
cials on current and upcoming 
anti-sweatshop projects.

"It doesn't go against their financial aid, but we would count their earnings against next year's financial aid eligibility," she said. 
Therefore, for some students, working off-campus could actually hurt them. 
For someone like Blair, however, that is not the case. She explained that a combi­nation of her hourly wages and tips at Colorado Steakhouse make it worthwhile for her work there. 
Financial aid is not always a considera­tion for students with off-campus jobs. 
Notre Dame senior Yasemin Gadelhak, who works at Lula's, decided to get a job to help cover living expenses when she moved off-campus. 
"Living off campus gets expensive," she said.

the food,' said Omarova. 
Although its cultural event for last semester ran into obstacles, the Board was able to make steps to improve the campus for those students with disabilities. 
"The Board has given a voice to disabled students. Last semes­ter we were able to propose measures to improve accessibili­ty on campus for disabled stu­dents and hopefully money will be set aside to make those changes," said Sara Mahoney, a member of Students with Disabilities and Diversity Board. 
The Boardalso plans to pack the month of March with activi­ties. Featuring events ranging from International Women's Week to Hunger Awareness Week, each member of the Board has taken on a cause. 
"We are working on getting students to sponsor a child with the Sisters of the Holy Cross in Mexico. If this works we want to start sponsoring children around the world," said Virginia Brewer-Delgado. 
Along with helping the world, 

the Board is trying to involve the 
South Bend community in its 
effort to enrich Saint Mary's stu­
dents. 
"For Disabilities Week we 

want to bring in the Logan cen­
ter. We want people to see that 
Saint Mary's is not just one 
homogenous community," said 
Omarova. 
Even though the Board is planning events for March, some students think the Board can play an even bigger role on campus. 

Some students, like campus activist senior Maureen Capilla, are concerned because they want a Board that is visibly active. 
"They haven't done much and they have a lot of work ahead of them," said Capillo. 
Utilitizing its resources is key, said Jamie Newcomb, Board member. 
"Having all these people in one place is an incredible amount of power only if we use it," said Newcomb. 
One of the efforts of the Board to increase dialogue on campus this semester has been to hold student forums to discuss vari­ous issues. 
The first forum in February was so successful that a second was held the next week to con­tinue the discussion on diversity and stereotypes people harbor. 
The Board also wants to use the forum as a place for student opinions. 
"We want to get Saint Mary's community into dialogue about any issues students have," said Omarova. 
The Board acknowledges there is much to be done to work on creating a culturally aware campus. 
"It is an ongoing challenge and 
daily struggle. The more we talk 
the more we open and I think by 
next year we will be in a differ­
ent place," said Terri Johnson, 
advisor and director of 
Multicultural Affairs at Saint

Students not receiving financial aid can still work on campus, according to Swift. She said her office posts positions on its job board web site. Salaries of students not on financial aid are not considered work-study, and so their salaries must be fully funded by the University.

KABUL, Afghanistan 
Taliban troops interrupted demolition of two giant stone Buddhas to celebrate the Muslim fes­tival of Eid al-Adha, but will continue destroying the statues when the holiday ends, a Taliban offi­cial said Tuesday. 
Parts of the massive statues -the larger of the two was believed to be the world's tallest stand­ing Buddha -have been destroyed and demoli­tion will continue when Eid ends Thursday, Abdul Salam Zaeef, the Taliban's ambassador to neighboring Pakistan, said in Islamabad. 
"\Ve don't know how long it will take to destroy them, but they will be eliminated," he said. 
The Taliban's reclusive leader Mullah Mohammed Omar has ordered all pre-Islamic statues in the country destroyed, including the two towering Buddhas hewn from a cliff face in central Bamiyan in the third and fifth centuries. 
Their destruction, as well as thousands that of other relics, including a 2,000-year-old seated bodhisattva, has generated international out­rage. In Buddhism, bodhisattvas are people of great spiritual awareness who help others reach enlightenment. 
ThP-U.N. Security Council on Tuesday con­demned the Taliban's order to destroy the relics as an "incomprensible and wanton" act of vio­lence against the country's cultural heritage. 
Council members joined other U.N. bodies. governments, religious and cultural organiza­tions in urging the Taliban to halt the destruction of an important part "of the world's cultural treasure." 
An eyewitness report earlier said Taliban sol­diers were firing anti-aircraft weapons at the giant statues. 
"I am being told from Kabul that they are using mainly explosives because the statues are very strong," Zaeef said. "We do not want to spend more money or resources to destroy them. That"s why we are using explosives." 
He said troops have demolished 25 percent of the two Buddhas. The Taliban's Information and Culture Minister Qatradullah Jamal said earlier that the legs and feet had already been destroyed. 
Reporters trying to reach Bamiyan, a valley in the Hindu Kush Mountain range nearly 80 miles from the Afghan capital of Kabul, were turned back by Taliban troops armed with automatic weapons. 
Most other Buddhist statues in museums throughout Afghanistan have already been destroyed, said Taliban officials who did not want to be quoted. 
It's not known whether the priceless bodhisatt­va is among them, but one Afghan source said "everyone believes it has been demolished. No one believes it is still there." 
Islamic clerics within the Taliban ranks were outraged by the bodhisattva's naked torso when the Kabul Museum was briefly opened last August. The statue was quickly encased in glass.

Parents praise Notre Dame family 
A week ago my husband Harry and I had the privilege of being a part of Notre Dame's wonderful Junior Parents' Weekend. It was a fun and memorable experience that we both enjoyed immensely. 
Along with our daughter Hyland we also did what most Domers do everyday: ate in the dining hall, visited your beautiful bookstore and listened to Father Edward Malloy, Father Joseph Walter and other faculty members and pro­that my husband joins me in thanking you as students for making our stay one that continues to fill our heart with pre­cious memories. You were kind, helpful and respectful.

inevitably hands will begin shooting Essays up across the class­
room. 
How will this be graded? Is this what you want us to do? Can I show you a draft? And when the professor fails to provide them with a clear formula, a deliberate recipe for a good grade, they panic. 
Notre Dame does not have a creative 

student body. Its strongest colleges are 
science and business which I think sets 
the tone for the rest of the University. 
Our alumni are known for their mergers 
and I.P.0.s, not their debut novels or fea­
ture films. Even the campus seems to 
lack that philosophical feel to it that you 
get when you walk through Ann Arbor or 
one of the Ivy League campuses out east. 
No, you'll never confuse South Bend 

for Oxford, but what we as intellectuals 
lack in creativity we make up for in 
elbow grease. 
For a Catholic university there's quite a 

Protestant work ethic here -weeks like 
this it's especially evident -and it's 
heightened by a Catholic sense of guilt 
that I suspect is the pulling force keeping 
so many students home studying on 
weekend nights. 
I've been told that in a national study 

our average workload at Notre Dame 
was in step with the top four schools in 
the nation. I question how scientific such 
a study can be but even so it's a telling 
ranking and to me not a surprising one. 
Part of the reason our workload is so 

heavy is because people here seem to 
thrive on it. Notre Dame students are like 
academic Rudy's. We may not be the 
smartest or cleverest or most privileged 
in our previous education but we'll out­
work, out-hustle, out-extra-credit you 
into the ground. 
Check that. Extra credit at Notre Dame doesn't really exist. Extra credit is offered, don't get me wrong, but the whole notion of extra credit is that cer­tain students will do additional and more challenging work in order to raise their grade in relation to others. At Notre Dame, more often than not, virtually everyone in the class does the extra credit. Since most classes are graded on a curve this means extra credit acts like 
required credit. 
And no matter how ludicrous the ways of generating credit get, the students never flinch. A few years ago a science professor here promised extra credit to any of his students who went to watch his elementary school son play soccer. Off they went, 50 strong, to watch an Indiana children's soccer game in the name of higher education. 
But don't misunder­stand me; I'm not com­ing down on a healthy work ethic. No doubt it's an admirable char­acteristic for a student body to have -and it's why big Chicago accounting firms swoop in every spring and take Darners by the hundreds off to cubicle lives on the Golden Coast -but with everyone working so hard here grading becomes tricky. 
Grade inflation is a problem at 
ll 

universities across the country, espe­cially in the liberal arts where objectivity is often lost in a tiring web of opinions. With no right or wrong answers or no clear cut grading key how do you justify giving an A, B, C or {gasp) a C-to a stu­
den~ . 
If you grade according to how hard the students work then nearly everybody deserves an A or high B because at this school as with other top universities stu­dents will work themselves silly to beat the bell curve. If you don't award most of 
them A's, they could do serious harm to themselves. 
But it's wrong to give grades based on the amount of effort a student gives. Working hard is a means to success but not an end. In America, we tend to champion work ethic as a byproduct of our rugged frontier origins -but work ethic shouldn't carry too much signifi­cance in academia. 
This could be why America has nev~r

revives Romero's spirit 
In the days before his death on March 24, 1980, Salvadoran Bishop Oscar Romero said in his homily, "I must tell you, as a Christian, I do not believe in death without resurrection. If I am killed, I shall arise in the Salvadoran people." 
Romero was assassinated because he spoke to the people 
Jim Paladino

of El Salvador about the pover­ty of the masses, calling on people of God to take action. El For a More Salvador went through years 
Just and
of bloody civil war that robbed 
Humane World
the nation of many of its young people and much of its natural 
resources. 

Economically the country was set back decades and only recently are some gains being made. Until the earthquakes in recent weeks. 
El Salvador continues to experience earthquakes on a daily basis, some 60 in total -not just after­shocks. Over a million people are homeless. The estimated poverty rate of 40 percent rose to over 50 percent of the population after the first quake hit. 
The people of El Salvador could use the sprit of Oscar Romero now. And his spirit is alive here at Notre Dame. 
Al Sondej was a member of the Notre Dame Class of 197 4, my class. The class that is able to boast Notre Dame's first astronaut, James Wetherbee, who is scheduled to take off in Space Shuttle Discovery on Thursday of this week. But Al Sondej is also a hero of that class. 
Many people to this day remember Al faithfully outside of the North Dining Hall every evening meal, collecting money for people in poverty. A bench there commemorates his efforts. 
During the 1970s Al responded to an earthquake in Guatemala by traveling there to help in relief efforts. Al has since passed away but friends of his from the class of 197 4 have established a fund in his name here at Notre Dame to assist in poverty relief efforts. 
This past week members of that group approached the University with the hope that a fit­ting memorial for Al's years here at Notre Dame would be to send the proceeds (amounting to sever­al thousand dollars) from Al's fund to El Salvador through Catholic Relief Services. 
Romero's spirit lives on. and so does that of Al 
Sondej! 

The week after spring break, Notre Dame will 
commemorate the 21st anniversary of Romero's 
assassination with the Annual Oscar Romero 
Lecture. Lectures and a prayer service will be held 
on Monday and Tuesday of that week. 
As we remember Oscar Romero we can all take 
this opportunity to also remember his sprit that 
lived in Al Sondej and continues to be present in our 
lives on this campus. In Al's memory students will 
be taking collections outside of both the North and 
South Dining halls and at the Monday Romero lec­
ture at the Hesburgh Center Auditorium. 
Please remember our sisters and brothers in El 
Salvador as they raise money for earthquake relief 
and rebuilding efforts through the Catholic Relief 
Services. 

Keep the spirit of Romero and Sondej alive in our midst!

Man triumphs over technology as CBS game show loses 
Technology has been screwing people over for more than 100 years. Every time your computer crashes or you watch the "Personalized Settings" box take forever loading up in t~e lab. technology is screwing you. 
But technology screws over corporations too, not just indi­vidual people. It seems that technology has been screwing CBS forever. 
During the Grammys this year, the CBS Jeff Baltruzak edit people kept missing Eminem swear­ing on the air. As a result, several naughty words kids hear everyday on the 
playground were said on America's last Short Circuits moral compass ~ television. 
You probably don't remember Michael Larsen, who used technology to screw over CBS back in 1984. Larsen, an unemployed ice cream truck driver, competed on a little game show you might remember fondly: "Press Your Luck." 
"Press Your Luck" was the game show where people dressed in teal and bad 80s hair competed for thousands in cash and prizes. People hoped not to hit "\-Vhammies," which were little cartoon characters that took all your money to buy more blue eye shadow, which was the fashion at the time. 
Contestants would watch a flickering board and then hit an enormous orange button to stop the board. all the while chant­ing "No Whammies, Big Bucks. no Whammies, Big Bucks." 
Larsen taped every episode of "Press Your Luck" and figured out by pausing his VCR over and over that the game board had only six random patterns. This is like "Jeopardy!" recycling questions, hoping that "nobody pays attention to Alex Trebek anyway." . 
Larsen memorized the patterns and went from Ohw to Los Angeles to seek his fortune like some covered wagon pioneer from the 1800s. What is not clear is if he left Ohio to avoid kids running up to the ice cream truck with 100 pennies want­ing to buy a Fudgesicle. . 
Once it was his turn to play on the show, Larson kept gettmg hitting the "Big Bucks" square, racking up $20,000, then $30,000 on a game show where winning 10 grand was a big day for a contestant. 
About this time, the show's producers realized they were getting screwed, and CBS had sinister emergency meetings to deal with the Larsen problem. 
Larsen kept spinning, and eventually got to over $110,000. At this point he stopped because his concentration began to slip and he got lucky on a couple spins that he did~'t h~t right. 
It's a shame that he did stop because he had a kid gomg to Notre Dame and $110,000 wasn't enough to cover the tuition hike in 1984. Apparently they had a "budget crisis" back then too. (I made that up). 
CBS only aired the episode with Larsen twice, and when t~ey sold the rights to the reruns to the USA Networks, they put 1t in the contract that USA couldn't show the Larsen episode, probably out of bitterness. CBS also added 10 more patterns for the board to stop future contestants from screwing them the way Larsen had. 
So here are the lessons to be learned from Michael Larsen: 
1. 
If you have technology, it will eventually screw you. 

2. 
If you're going to make a game show, put really dumb peo­ple on it and save yourself some money. 

3. 
Game shows have permanent bad karma. They let people win money, and then they take it away. It's like teasing a dog with a Milkbone. You can tease the dog all you want, but even­tually he will bite you in the leg. · 


Who will technology screw next? It's hard to tell. But I, for one, hope it w.ill he CBS.

Who wa 
From game shows' earliest days 

By C. SPENCER BEGGS Assistant Scene Editor 
Game shows attract die-hard followers of all ages, fans who live to hear Bob Barker yell, "Come on down!" or hear Regis ask, "Is that your final answer?" 
From the earliest days of quiz shows, these armchair players have competed right along with the contestants on their TV screen. Game show addicts are found across the country, and Notre Dame is no exception. 
Sophomore Sean Milligan, reigning cham­pion of Playstation "Jeopardy!" in Fisher Hall, considers himself a game show guru. 
"I think game shows are the best thing that ever happened to TV," said Milligan. "Where else can you do absolutely nothing and still be a hero for a day?" 
Like many of his hall mates, Milligan enjoys his daily fix of game shows. His favorites include "Jeopardy!," "The Price is Right," "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" and "Temptation Island". 
Milligan is confident in his game show stratagems. "'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' I rule that game," he said. ''I'd win at 'Temptation Island' and 'Survivor' at the same time." 
Sine~ his childhood, Milligan has been watching game shows and planning his shot at the million dollar question. Of course, the jackpot was not always $1 million. 
In fact, the first game show had no prize and was not even aired on television, proving just how far the genre has come since its conception. 
History 

Today it is almost impossible not to recog­nize the phrases "Is that your final answer?" or "I'd like to buy a vowel." The catchy theme music from "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune" is impossible to get out of your head. You're humming it right now, aren't you? 
Yet while these programs have become a staple in American popular culture. the game show as we know it today is surpris­ingly young. In 1923, only 13 years after the first public radio broad­cast, two ambitious young men ­"Time" maga­zine co­found er Briton Hadden and his circulation manager Roy Larsen made world history. With the strike of a chime, the two men pre­miered "The Pop Question Game" in an attempt to increase the readership of the fledgling news journal. 
"The Pop Question Game" con­sisted of a selected guest answering one question, or "skull test," before the chime's last note sounded. 

No prize money was offered on "The Pop Question Game". No fancy cars or dream vaca­tions were won with the correct answer. Moreover, the creators of the game show concept had no idea how big their publicity stunt would become. 


Now In Its 28th season on CBS, "The Price Is Right," hosted by Bob Barker, is the longest running game show In television history.

Another show, FOX's "'Greed," pits people against each other in a way unlike other earlier quiz games. In "'Greed," contes­tants must play cooperatively and against each other at the same time. 
Again, the show focuses on the par­ticipants them­selves rather than the game. 
Game Show Flops 
Unfortunately. many ideas in game shows have not been received with the enthusi­asm of "Survivor" and "'Temptation Island." Because of the relatively low production cost of game shows, thou­sands of hours of 

The first radio show to have a real game show for­
mat was the "Professor Quiz" show, which debuted 
in March 1937. The show boasted a host, an 
announcer, a studio audience and prizes. 
"Professor Quiz" aired on CBS, at that time a 
radio station like all the other major networks. By 
the next year, other networks had taken notice of 
the successful idea, and soon there were over 200 
programs with a similar format. 
Shortly after the first for-profit television broad­casts, games shows made the transition to the little screen. The first commercial television game show, N BC's "Uncle Jim's Question Bee," aired July 1, 1941. The show beat out the more famous "first" game show -CBS's "Truth or Consequences" -by a few short hours. 
"Uncle Jim's Question Bee" was actually the direct descendent of the "Professor Quiz" show. When the original host of "Professor Quiz" became 
ill. he was released from with contract with CBS. After recovery, he was hired to host "Uncle Jim's Question Bee" by CBS's biggest rival. 
Before Regis and "Who Wants to be a Millionaire," there was another catchphrase on America's lips. Beginning in the 1940s, NBC's "Dr. I.Q." set the standard for pompous and overly loquacious hosts. Each night an assistant would announce with great gusto. "I have a lady in the balcony. Doctor." 
While the phrase may not be as catchy as the famed "Jeopardy!" category "potent potables," "Dr. 1.Q." defined the America's game show in a way no other program had done or would do for 50 years. The vaudeville pomp and grandeur of "Dr. I.Q." is apparent in almost every game show seen today. 
Today's Game Shows 
Modern game shows have moved from being purely quiz shows to incorporating different gen­res. For example, "American Gladiators" combined prize incentives with a physical challenge aspect. A more recent trend in shows like "Temptation Island" and "Survivor" is to tap into the relatively new arena of the real-life documentary. 
Newer shows like MTV's "Fear." which places people in situations deliberately designed to play on

locked away in stu­
dio yaults. 
For example, in 
1982 Greg and John Rice, twin midgets, hosted the unusually titled "That **** Quiz Show." The show was based on a gambling premise between teams of players with unusual jobs or backgrounds. 
Unfortunately, the offensive nature of this premise caused the show's cancellation two months after it premiered. 
Another ill-fated game show, 1961 's ..You're in the Picture," was hosted by Jackie Gleason. In this game, situation panelists were set in a picture 
frame and obscured by a screen, except for their 
heads. 

By asking yes-or-no questions. contestants tried to 
ascertain what the panelists were doing behind the 
screen...You're in the Picture" was so disappointing 
that Jackie Gleason apologized to the audience in 
advance before the second episode was filmed. 
Luckily, the networks had the good sense to pull the 
plug before the second episode aired. 
The basic premises of more successful game shows have evolved little over the last 60 years. A look at "The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows" exposes how often producers repackage old themes. "The Price is Right" is suspiciously similar to the 1947 show "Missus Goes A-Shopping," and comedy improv show "Whose Line is it Anyway" closely resembles Jack Lemon's "The Ad-Libbers" from 1951. 
Do You Want To Be A Millionaire? 
It is easy to sit back and watch faceless contes­tants match their wits against the masters, but does everyone have the chutzpa to actually apply? The selection process is not as hard as one might think. 
"Jeopardy!" offers contestant interviews year­round. The interview consists of a 50 question test. Those who pass the test go on to a videotaped mock session of the game filmed by none other than host Alex Trebek. The lucky hopefuls who make it past the taping will then have their names put in an active file for a year, during which they may be called upon to attend a real "Jeopardy!" round. 
The selection process for "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" is less exclusive. Interested parties may call in and play a telephone version of the game during announced hours. 
Winners of the round are entered into a random computerized drawing to play a second qualifying round. If successful. the parties will again be placed in a computerized random pool and may then be called as contestants for the show. 
Strategies to win at the games are widely varied. A brief look at the games section of any large book­store reveals numerous titles on how to succeed in each show. Some books recommend systems for managing time while others claim to have advanced knowledge of what questions the quiz will pose. 
Those are strategies too involved for connoisseurs like Milligan. 
"The trick to winning at 'Jeopardy!' is being fast on the buzzer and knowing way too much useless stuff," he said. "In 'Survivor' you have to make friends, but not really be their friends." 
It may be a while before you see Milligan's face in the hot seat of a quiz show, but he is confident that if anyone is brave enough to step up to the buzzer, he will soundly show them what it means to be a true game show guru. 

Contestants spin for big money and ask to buy vowels on CBS's "Wheel of Fortune," now in its 18th sea­son starring Pat Sajak and Vanna White.

"We beat a hell of a team," Huskies' head coach Geno Auriemma said. "I think it should have ended when it was 76-all and we all could have gone home." 
The victory was bittersweet, however. for the Huskies. Shea Ralph, last season's NCAA Final Four MVP. went down late in the second half with a knee injury. Ralph, who twice has torn the anteri­or cruciate ligament in her right knee, apparently suf­fered the same injury in her left. 
"On the examination, it said. "I was really disappoint­ed that she didn't have some­body in front of her when she shot that." 
Bird then broke a 73-73 tie in the game's final minute, hitting a three-pointer from the top of the key. Riley coun­tered with a lay-up 10 sec­onds later to pull the Irish within one. 
Bird then dribbled the ball out of bounds, setting up a possible game-winner for the Irish. 
UConn center Kelly Schumacher fouled Riley in the lane. The Big East player of the year hit the second free-throw after bouncing the first off the back of the rim.

that she tore properly the anterior head coach defending

"Every time I come home and say so-and-so's been practicing great or playing great, I jinx them," Auriemma said. "I came home before the tournament started and I said, 'Shea Ralph's going to be the MVP of the tournament."' Without Ralph and All­American Svetlana Abrosimova -who already suffered a season -ending left foot injury on Feb. 7 -Bird stepped to the forefront. The point guard, who fin­ished with a team-high 15 points on the night, hit more than just the crucial game­winner. In the closing seconds of the first half, Bird nailed a run­ning three-pointer from just inside the half-court line to put the Huskies ahead 52-46 heading in to the locker room. "We were trying to go get into man-to-man," McGraw 
in the 
game's 

final sec­onds. 
"I think the crowd was defi­nitely a factor," McGraw said. "At the end of the game we had a foul to give, but we didn't have a timeout left to kind of organize things and tell them that." 
Riley was named to the All­Tournament team following the game, along with team­mates Kelley Siemon and Alicia Ratay as well Connecticut's Ralph and Asjha Jones. Connecticut freshman guard Diana Taurasi, who scored 14 points, including four three-pointers, on Tuesday, was named the Tournament Most Valuable Player. 
Riley led the Irish with 23 points and nine rebounds. She played only 33 minutes as she committed four fouls. 
"I think they wanted her on the bench, so they kept going at her," McGraw said. "I think they had some success doing that." 
Siemon added 16 points, 
eight rebounds and two steals for the Irish while Ra tay scored 14 points, including three three-pointers. Point guard Niele Ivey touched for 11 points while handing out nine assists. 
"We don't play well if Nie le Ivey doesn't play well," McGraw said. "She played extremely well today. I think our balance has been really the key for us." 
Despite trailing by six at the halftime buzzer. Notre Dame had one of its best shooting halves of the season. The Irish hit 60.7 percent of their field goal attempts in the opening half, while limiting the Huskies to 52.5 percent from the floor. 
In the second half, the Irish defense got even better. Connecticut attempted 39 shots from the floor, connect­ing on only 10. 
The Irish shot only 40.7 per­cent in the second· half. McGraw attributes the shoot­ing woes to the fast pace gf the game's first 20 minutes. 
"Our game is to run," McGraw said. "We played our own game but in the second half I think we paid the price for it. I think they did too, because their shots weren't dropping." 
Connecticut backup center Kelly Schumacher, averaging only 6.1 points per contest coming in, came off the bench to score 10 points playing inside against Riley. 
"Schu knew I wasn't happy with her, because she wasn't practicing very good," Auriemma said. "She was looking at me with this look on her face like 'You're an idiot.' She said, 'Put me in." I said. 'All right, go in."' She would never say that before." 
The Irish now have a week off before hosting the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament in the Joyce Center. Opponents and game times will be announced Sunday. 
McGraw hopes to see her team face off against the Huskies for the third time this season in the Final Four. 
"We're extremely hopeful that there will be a trilogy," McGraw said. "We're both No. 1 seeds so if it plays out as it should, we will should get another chance to play." 
Classic 
continued from page 20 
an Instant Classic. 
By this weekend, Connecticut will probably erect a Sue Bird statue. According to Bird, how­ever, if the final seconds ended differently, she would be hung in effigy. With 16.3 seconds left and Connecticut ahead 76-75, center Kelly Schumacher set a screen for Bird, who drove past Niele Ivey. Bird took a few dribbles before the ball bounced off her leg and went out of bounds for the turnover. 
Forget that Bird sat out the previous night's semifinal due to back spasms. Forget that Bird finished with a team-high 15 points. Forget that 33 seconds earlier. Bird hit a three-pointer to give the Huskies a three-point lead. 
"I knew if I didn't hit the game winning-shot," Bird said, "there were going to be problems in the University of Connecticut coach­es· offices." 
In the other coaches' office, Muffet McGraw and company must be pleased. Ruth Riley, after struggling offensively the past two games, accumulated a line (23 points, 9 rebounds, 3 blocks) worthy of the National Player of the Year award. The Irish shot 50.9 percent from the field, out rebounded the Huskies 42-39 and received a 16-point 8­rebound performance from All­Tournament member Kelley Siemon. 
And although they lost, Tuesday's game may have been more impressive than the 96-72 win over then No. 1 Connecticut on Jan. 15. In that contest, Notre Dame played flawlessly while Connecticut seemed shocked and startled and even "gave up," according to Bird and coach Geno Auriemma. 
On Tuesday, Notre Dame did not handle the Connecticut pres­sure as well as before, Riley got into foul trouble, and the Huskies found the gaps in the Irish zone. a defense that caused nightmares for the Huskies in January. 
But even with those problems, the Irish still had a chance to win their 
first-ever Big East tournament title. "I feel better about this game [than the 54-53 to Rutgers on 

Feb. 171," 
McGraw said. "This game I 
feel we played at least pretty 
well. There's a lot of good things 
to take from it." 
Auriemma had the same reac­
tion. Sort of. 
The Huskies' eighth straight tournament title was spoiled by bad news. Shea Halph, a second­team All-Big East selection and the team leader, tore the ACL in her left knee with 5:18 left in the first half and will likely miss the remainder of the season. 
Ralph. the Big East Player of the Year last season, joins for­ward Svetlana Abrosimova, the conference Player of the Year in 1998-99 on the sidelines for the NCAA tournament. Abrosimova injured her left foot on Feb. 1 and underwent surgery to repair a torn ligament. 
Before the injury, Ralph had 11 points, 6 assists and 3 steals. 
"Somebody asked me [before the tournament], 'Have you seen a different look in your players eyes?'," Auriemma said. "I said 'No, they all look just as dopey as before, except for Shea Ralph.' You can't play better than the way Shea was playing. It's impossible. She was on her way. She was on her way." 
Connecticut is on its way to the NCAA tournament as the nation's top team. Although they will be without Ralph and Abrosimova, ·the Huskies have more depth than a Father Hesburgh sermon. Five players scored in double figures and eight played more than 14 min­utes on Tuesday. 
When the NCAA brackets are announced on Sunday night, both teams will likely be No. 1 seeds. So another game is possi­ble. 
"We're extremely hopeful that there will be a trilogy," McGraw said. For now, the focus remains on Notre Dame-Connecticut II. 
A few minutes after the con test, while the Connecticut play­ers were accepting the tourna­ment trophy, one Husky fan in Section 109 shouted to no one in particular. 
"That was a great women's basketball game," he said. 
He's wrong. 
That was a great basketball game.

said Tuesday during a break

"Everyone likes to see a

Keeping the game moving 

does not necessarily require 
rule changes, but possibly just 
more delay of game calls in 
accordance with the existing 
rules. 
Campbell said that, during a session with some GMs on a committee to discuss the issue, these questions were raised: "Why try to bring in new rules to make the game continuous? What's going on with our pre­sent rules and how have they eroded: skaters shooting the puck on purpose into the stands; a skater on purpose falling on the puck; a goal­tender freezing the puck when there's no opponent near 
h. ?"
Im. 

He said the committee has been filtering through some suggestions and studying the results of a questionnaire sent around the league. 
"Why would we even consid­er blending new rules into the game, trying to figure out how to call them consistently, when we already have rules, whether they were put in there one year, five, 10, 15 years ago, that have been eroded," he said. 
"We've all seen games where the guy intentionally stops play to keep the puck in his hand. It was called years ago, but it's not now," Campbell said. 
length of the 
intermissions, 
we're not going 

to change that. But can we get 
the players to move the puck, 
not just stop the play? That's 
what we discussed," he said. 
Studies have shown that 
goalies freezing the puck is 
the most frequent cause of the 
game being stopped. 
If the league does decide to 
enforce some of the rules to 
speed up the game. it obvious­
ly will take some getting used 
to. 

"You let the players and offi­
cials know in training camp, in 
exhibition, and that's it. Then 
I don't think you'll see it hap­
pening much," Campbell said. 
He also said that the league was, at the behest of the play­ers' union, going to look again at how the fight-instigator rule might be modified to make it clearer. 
Also at Tuesday's session, the first of three days the gen­eral managers are meeting in this desert resort, Anaheim GM Pierre Gauthier said the Mighty Ducks were still trying to help Guy Hebert, the team's goalie since it came into the league in 1993, land with another team. 
Hebert became expendable Monday when the Ducks swapped Teemu Selanne to San Jose for goalie Steve Shields and left wing Jeff Friesen. 
Phoenix GM Cliff Fletcher said the Coyotes, who traded holdout goalie Nikolai Khabibulin to Tampa Ba.y on Monday for three players and a draft pick, are still shopping. His list includes a defenseman or two and maybe a wing ­all preferably young. 
"I think you saw in the big trade we made yesterday that we got a draft choice, a 19­year-old and a 21-year-old," Fletcher said.

Boston College from a 3-13 Big East record a year ago, the worst in the conference to 13-3 this season. the best of any team. 
"The two guys who were selected player of the year were from championship teams," Brey said. "I think it just sends a great message. It's so good when your individual award winners come from championship teams or teams that are in the hunt." 
In the process of rebuilding Boston College, the 6-1 sopho­more Bell scored 20.1 points per game. good for third in the Big East, and a third-best 2.6 steals per game. 
"I never envisioned myself being here so soon," Bell said. 
Eagles' coach Al Skinner also got credit for Boston College's turnaround, capturing Big East coach of the year. 
Seton Hall freshman Eddie Griffin won rookie of the year, after leading the Big East with 19 double-doubles and the nation with 4.5 blocks per game. 
Providence junior John 
Linehan. a point guard, won defensive player of the year. as the 
Friars improved from 4-12 in the league a year ago to 11-5 this season. 
Syracuse's Preston Shumpert and West Virginia's Calvin Bowman shared the award for Most Improved Players, with the voting slighting Notre Dame senior point guard Martin Ingelsby. 
Ingelsby, who played a limited reserve role a year ago, now averages 37.9 minutes per game as a team captain. He has posted the best assist-to-turnover ratio in the Big East at 3.49, while fin­ishing near the top of the league in assists. 
"I thought Martin was so deserving," Brey said. "I wanted it so bad for him -something, maybe most improved, maybe third team." 
Ingelsby seemed more inter­ested in getting more team wins than individual honors. The same goes for junior forward Ryan Humphrey, who was named to the third team All-Big East, but could have made a case for being a second team selection. Humphrey scored 14.3 
points and pulled down nine rebounds per game in his first season as a transfer from Oklahoma. 
''I've just got to take it as it comes," Humphrey said. "The only thing that matters are the team goals. As long as we win the championship, that's all that matters." 
While Brey thought Humphrey could have been picked a bit higher, he also thought Ingelsby or sophomore shooting guard Matt Carroll had the types of seasons worthy of all-conference selection. Then again, the Irish coach recognized that their snubs indicated the quality of Big East players. 
"There's a lot of good players in our league," Brey said. "They've really grasped winning and chasing a championship and going back to the NCAA Tournament. So the individual things have been brushed off pretty quickly, and they're going for the team goals." 
Big East Tournament play begins today. The Irish have a first-round bye, and will face the winner of tonight's Miami­Pittsburgh face off Thursday at 7 p.m.

NHL 
Gretzky, Coyotes see big changes 
Associated Press 
PHOENIX 

Not even a month has passed in the Wayne Gretzky era. yet the Phoenix Coyotes have already fired and hired a gener­aI manager and traded the team's holdout goalie. 
On Monday night. Phoenix sent goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin and defenseman Stan Neckar to the Tampa Bay Lightning for defenseman Paul Mara, for­wards Mike Johnson and Ruslan Zainullin and a second-round draft choice. 
The first major player move made on the watch of managing partner Gretzky may just have been a way to unload one of the two All-Star goalies in Phoenix. 
But speculation also remains that this could be the beginning of a number of deals the team will make to reduce its payroll before next Tuesday's NHL trad­ing deadline. 
Coyotes GM Cliff Fletcher said Tuesday he will "absolutely" make additional moves but hedged as to whether they would occur before the deadline. He has spoken with several gen eral managers concerning Phoenix captain Jeremy Roenick and leading scorer Keith Tkachuk, both of whom Fletcher believes will still be members of the Coyotes on ·wednesday night. 
"We're looking at it with an open mind," he said of the possi­bility of trading Tkachuk. Fletcher said the offer would have to be perfect to let go of a player who's on pace to score 40 goals for the fourth straight sea­son. 
"I don't know if that deal's there. If not, he's a very good hockey player and we're happy to have him." 
Fletcher was more definitive about the immediate future of Roenick, who becomes an unre­stricted free agent at the end of the season and has been negoti­ating with the Coyotes. 
"You know nothing's going to happen before the trading dsad­line," Fletcher said from a GMs meeting in La Quinta, Calif. "There's no situation here where we would say: 'If you don't sign before the trading deadline, we're trading you.' That's not an issue." 
Trading Roenick and Tkachuk has been mentioned as a way to offset a financial burden incurred by the new owners. Principal owner Steve Ellman said the Coyotes will lose $20 million by year's end while play­ing in an arena with many limit­ed-view seats. He also went through a series of deadline extensions to secure the $90 million needed for last month's purchase. 
Tkachuk commands $8.3 mil­lion this season, but Gretzky said last month he wants him to stay. 
"I hope to build a team around Keith Tkachuk," he said. ''I've said that from Day 1." 
Gretzky also made a commit­ment last year to keep Khabibulin, the second-win­ningest goalie in franchise histo­ry. But with Khabibulin's high salary demands and the stellar play of Sean Burke -who has almost single-handedly kept Phoenix in the playoff hunt ­
· the five-year starting netminder became expendable. "The numbers Nik was throw­ing out were respectable, but we couldn't bite the bullet," Gretzky said. "It's good for him, but we had to better our hockey team, and we're getting some young guns to help." Youth has become a top priori­ty for the Coyotes, who recently lost 35-year-old forward Claude Lemieux to an ankle injury for the remainder of the regular season. Fletcher, who took over for Bobby Smith just two days after Gretzky became managing part­ner, said the team's wish list includes a winger and a couple of def ensemen. Three-time· All-Star Teppo Numminen is out with an ankle injury and the Coyotes have suf­fered through a five-game win­less streak in which they have yielded 25 goals. 
Red Wings topple Canucks 4-3 
Associated Press 
VANCOUVER 
Steve Yzerman scored twice as the Detroit Red Wings continued their dominance of the Vancouver Canucks with a 4-3 victory Tuesday night. 
Yzerman made it 3-1 on the power play at 15:43 of the second period, then added the eventual game­winner 4:25 into the third on a one-timer from the slot. 
Martin Lapointe added a goal and an assist, and Mathieu Dandenault also scored for the Red Wings, who haven't lost to Vancouver in more than three years. 
Markus Naslund scored his 38th goal, and Ed Jovanovski and Daniel Sedin added power-play goals for the Canucks, who fell to 0-13-3 against Detroit since Feb. 6, 1997. 
Naslund made it 4-3 with 5:30 left to play. 
The Canucks had several chances to get even after they pulled goalie Dan Cloutier. and went on a power play. But Vancouver couldn't get the tying goal past Manny Legace. 

Legace finished with 20 saves to improve to 19-5­4. 
The Hed Wings, who have lost just once in 14 games (11-1-3-0), moved one point ahead of St. Louis for first place in the Central Division. 
Detroit finished 1-for-7 on the power play. but scored twice just after a man-advantage expired. 
Jovanovski staked the Canucks to a 1-0 lead mid­way through the first peri­od, but Lapointe tied it at 
14: 59. just two seconds after Naslund stepped out of the penalty box. 
Dandenault gave the Hed Wings the lead for good with a wrist shot from the slot 7 :31 into the second period, six seconds after a Vancouver penalty expired. 
Danie[ Sedin made it 3-2 and moved into a tie for the rookie goal-scoring lead when he tipped twin brother Henrik's point shot past Legace with 1:30 left in the second period for his 18th goal.

men in the scoring column trail­ing only Michigan's Jeff Jillson (10--18-28). 
Among Lebda's seven goals two were power play goals. two were shorthanded goals and one was a game-winning goal. The offensive-minded defenseman finished third on the team with 112 shots on goal. 
In December, the 5-10, 195­pound blueliner became the first Notre Dame player since 1994 to score five points in a game when he had a goal and four assists in a 7-3 Irish win at Nebraska­Omaha. 
A product of the U.S. Under­18 developmental team, Lebda is the fifth Notre Dame player to be named to the CCHA all-rookie team. He joins current team­mate, David Inman (1998-99) along with Mark Eaton (1997­98). Joe Dusbabek (1996-97) and Jamie Ling {1992-93) to receive the honor. He is the sec­ond Notre Dame defenseman named to the team, joining Eaton who is currently playing for the Nashville Predators in the National Hockey League. 
Lebda was selected as a CCHA rookie of the week on Feb. 25 for his play in Notre Dame's games at Alaska-Fairbanks when he had a goal and three assists, helping the Irish to a tie and a victory. 
Gill scored 11 goals with 15 assists for 26 points while Globke scored 1 7 goals and added nine assists for 26 points. His 17 goals were second among CCHA rook­ies behind Jeff Campbell's 23. 


All three Notre Dame fresh­men finished the year with 26 points to tie for third in team scoring. This marks the first time since the 1978-79 season that three freshmen finished the year with 25 or more points in one season. 
The CCHA rookie-of-the­year Award will be announced on Thursday, March 15 at the CCHA Awards Banquet in Detroit, Mich.

WOMEN'S BIG EAST TOURNAMENT 
Bird flies over Irish 
Last second shot hands Huskies Big East Tourney 
By NOAH AMSTADTER Assistnat Sports Editor 
STORRS. CONN. 
So they said Sue Bird was injured. 

On Monday, Connecticut's point guard sat out her team's Big East semifinal win over Rutgers with a sore back. Tuesday, the junior made a last-second lay-up to give the Huskies (28-2, 15-1) their ninth consecutive Big East Tournament championship, topping the Irish (28-2, 15-1) 76-74. 
The Huskies' victory avenged a Jan. 15 loss to the Irish in the Joyce Center, the only time the Irish have ever beaten the Huskies. 
With 5.1 seconds remaining, Ruth Riley hit a free throw to tie the game at 74. Bird took the inbounds pass and sprinted the length of the court. She took the ball right at Riley in the lane, letting it fly high above the rim. 
Nothing but net. 
Who said Sue Bird was injured? 

"I saw Ruth stepping up with her hand up and I thought she was going to get a piece and it was going to be an airball," Irish head coach Muffet McGraw said. 
Said Bird: "I definitely have a lot of confi­dence in that type of situation. I caught the ball and I just went." 
The shot provided the perfect climax in an exciting game that featured six lead changes and four ties. Connecticut twice led by as many as eight points, but Notre Dame kept storming back. 
see HOOPS/page 12 

Irish, Huskies play a game for the ages 
STORRS, CONN. 

And so this conference championship game culminated with an injured Sue Bird driving down court, stopping for a split second. falling away, and connecting on a front-rim grazing, game­winning prayer. How appropriate. 
One possible season­ending injury, two buzzer­beaters. six All-Big East performers, and enough excitement that made even the normally reserved Alicia Ratay show some emotion. 
Who said the female version of Dr. James Naismith's century-old sport was boring? 
"I felt like every play, the way the crowd was reacting, was the game-winning play," Bird said. "Even every time we would hit just a sim­ple lay-up." 
In the sports journalism field, superlatives are written more frequently than nouns. We tend to over-hype, overanalyze and over criti­cize. Even unimportant regular season games are treated like something special. 
But Tuesday night's final? 
Forgive the following: It may have been the most memorable game in conference history. By this weekend, ESPN will probably deem it

Hungry Irish storm into New York looking for title 
By KERRY SMITH Sports Editor 
The trophy had already switched positions in the locker room. The markings on the banner had been earned and the T-shirts had already been printed up. Notre Dame was just waiting for the final buzzer of Sunday's game against Georgetown to sound to official­ly step into the limelight with its first Big East division title. 
Motivation was lacking -and the No. 13 Irish played like it in their 79-72 loss to the No. 20 Boyas. 
"We won [the division] a week ago by 30 points," Irish power forward Troy Murphy said. "The trophy was here three or four days ago. We should have definitely focused more on this." 
But regardless of an end-of­the-season slide with two straight conference losses, the Irish will turn their focus to something they have not earned yet -to a trophy they want, but need to play for -The Big East Conference title. 
Heading to New York this week, the Irish have earned a bye in the tournament's first round and will first step on the court Thursday against the win­ner of today's Miami/Pittsburgh matchup. 
And the Irish are confident that they have not lost any momentum heading into the postseason. 
"We're No. 1 in our division," Irish forward David Graves said. "You can say it's wide open -like the whole season has been with a lot of upsets that you couldn't predict -but we believe that we can win the Big East Tournament. We have every intention of adding anoth­
"We,re No. I in our division. You can say it's wide open ... but we believe that we can win the Big East Tournament. We have every intention ofadding another banner in the Joyce Center."

er banner in the Joyce Center." 
That confidence in ability and excitement about the possibili­ties the postseason offers for his squad is what head coach Mike Brey expects from his 19-8 team. 
"The guys don't feel as tired and the bumps and bruises don't hurt as much in March," Brey said. "They'll tell you that. There's a bounce in their step even though they've logged so many miles." 
The miles the Irish have logged have been tough ones. Brey's squad turned up the heat in the season's early going, amassing a 9-2 record before entering into the conference schedule. The team hit some stumbling blocks, however, when they lost three out of four on the road in the midseason to Syracuse, Seton Hall and Kentucky. The Irish looked on par to finish the regular season on a roll with eight consecutive wins in the Big East, but have dropped three of their last five to Seton Hall, Connecticut and Georgetown. 
Despite the setbacks of late, the Irish are convinced they are as sharp as ever. 
"I don't think we've lost an edge,'' Murphy said, "We won 19 games this year. This is 
where we should be. Nineteen 
wins. I think we're all right." 
Ready or not, the Irish have a 
formidable task ahead of them. 
In order to capture the confer­
ence championship, the team 
needs to come up with three 
wins in three days -a tiring 
thought for a squad that relies 
heavily on a six-man rotation. 
The Irish will stick with their 
usual starting line-up of 
Murphy, forwards Harold 
Swanagan and Ryan Humphrey, 
and guards Matt Carroll and 
Martin Ingelsby. Graves, who 
lost his starting position this 
season will continue to play a 
dominant role off the bench. 
"[Graves] is one of the biggest positives [on the team]," Brey said. "He's confident and I think we have him in a good frame of mind. We're going to need all six ready to go." 
Even if all six key players are primed for playing time, the Irish may need to look to their bench more than usual the fur­ther they advance and the more. tired the players get throughout the tournament. 
Brey will look to reserves for­ward Jere Macura and guard Torrian Jones to give the key unit a rest. 
"Jere and Torrian have been good," Brey said. "We don't go in with preconceived minutes for each player. We have to have them ready to play. They've learned the last five weeks to be ready even if they haven't been rewarded with big minutes. Three straight games would be difficult. Jere and Torrian will need to steal some minutes for us." 
But before the Irish can worry about multiple games, they have to pass the first test Thursday night. 
Brey's squad plans to concen­trate on their intensity level and quickness to outmatch either the No. 4 seed in the East ­Miami -or the No. 5 seed in the West-Pittsburgh. 
"[We're going to need] quick­ness to the basket and quick­ness in the lane," Brey said. "[Teams] beating us to the ball has bit us a few times this sea­son. That's something we need to identify in New York and identify beyond." 
But Brey and the Irish are 

hungry for another banner to hang up in the Joyce Center and are ready to earn it this week­end. 
"I think we'll be ready to play," Brey said. "I'm glad we're playing on Thursday because the team could use a little bit of rest. It will give us an advantage to be rested and get in the right mood. We'll go to the banquet, get into the atmosphere and be ready."

Ingelsby makes good on senior season 

Ingelo;;by said. "We went out to dinner and just talked basketball. He said, 'I couldn't have been more happy to hear that I have a senior point guard.' He gave me a lot of confidence in myself, and he gave me the ball from day one. From day one, I knew that this was my team and I was going to be the point guard." 
Brey and Ingelsby clicked from the start. Their personalities were similar, both calm and collected, laid-back yet focused. 
"I think our demeanors are similar," Brey said. "He's the perfect point guard for me, that's all I know. I have the utmost confidence in him." 
While Brey trusted Ingelsby's abilities from the start, many others were not as upbeat. 
Fans and preseason magazines alike ragged on Notre Dame's team captain, knocking him as the one weak link in an otherwise strong Irish team. They ques­tioned his speed, his defensive ability, his capacity to counter former high school All­Americans in the Big East. 
But if Ingelsby hadn't given up on him­self the year before, he saw no reason to start now. 
"I took that as a challenge to go out and prove myself, that I could play at this level and play at this level well," Inge Isby said. "I think I've done that so far this year, and I think those people are quiet now." 
Ingelsby's half right. The naysayers aren't quiet, but they're not critical, either; they're outspoken in their support for the senior, and with good reason. 
"I think he's surpassed all the expecta­tions we had for him this year," junior for­ward Troy Murphy said. 
He's maneuvered his way through the Big East regular season, helping the Irish post 11 league wins, three more than their previous best. He's played a team-high 
37.2 minutes per game this season, the rare break usually coming at the end of a blowout victory. 
In his comeback season, Ingelsby's dished off 6.6 assists per game, 11th-best in the nation and third-best in the Big East. Despite bringing the ball up the court, he averages less than two turnovers per game. Oh, and the team's top 3-point specialist also hit a game-winning shot against 10th-ranked Boston College Feb. 21. 
Not everyone was surprised. 
"I expected it," Carroll said. "Just from playing with him last year, I knew that he was a great player." 
Brey agrees. 

"I just think you're seeing the culmina­tion of a young man who's worked very hard to be a good college player, and it's all coming together his senior year." 
Even more key than his stats are Ingelsby's intangible contributions to the team. The calm senior never gets flus­tered, even in the harshest of road envi­ronments. He keeps his composure, setting the example for his teammates. 
"You'd never know if he was winning or losing just to look at his face," said Rose Ingelsby. "That's the way he is. He never gets too upset." 
Ingelsby's senior season has earned him an invitation to the Port Smith camp in early April, a chance for NBA and overseas scouts to check out the potential draft players. If playing professionally doesn't work out, coaching is surely in Ingelsby's future, possibly at Notre Dame. 
"I would like to, definitely, especially coming back under Coach Brey," Ingelsby said of returning to the Irish in a different role. "I feel like he's the one that recruited me. We have a great relationship on and off the court. He's the type of guy I'd like to work under." 
The feeling is mutual. 
"He would be a guy I'd love to have back here someday," said the first-year Irish coach. "Maybe he goes away first and then comes back, but he would be a guy that I would be very interested in." 
Not Done Yet 

It would be hard to ask for much more from anyone, let alone a player so under­estimated at the season's start and so overlooked a year ago. 
Ingelsby's not quite done refuting his critics' claims, however. 
While winning eight consecutive Big East games and capturing a division banner was a thrill, that's not enough for Ingelsby. He's got a Big East Tournament to win this week, and the NC.AA Tournament on his mind as well. 
"We're really happy with the way things have gone this year," Ingelsby said, "but we're not satisfied." 
If anyone's entitled to a little satisfaction, it's lngelsby.

. Captain rebounds from bumP-Y year to start at point guard 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN Associate Sports Editor 
Martin Ingelsby's transformation from forgotten to indispensable took just three days. Somewhere between Matt Doherty's decision to pack his bags for North Carolina on July 11 and Mike Brey signing on as the new Irish men's basketball coach on July 14, Ingelsby became the point man for Notre Dame. 
The full transition would take a bit longer. Inge Isby had plenty of people to convince of his ability to lead a top-25 team, but with Brey as coach, the ball and the team were in Ingelsby's hands once more. 
Less than eight months later, Ingelsby has proved himself quite capable of stand­ing up to Big East competition. The senior captain has been more reliable than the mailman in pushing Notre Dame to a Big East West Division title and a likely NCAA Tournament bid, logging overtime minutes on the court and leading the conference in assist-to-turnover ratio. 
The comeback couldn't be sweeter for Ingelsby. 
Season to forget 
Ingelsby returned home to Philadelphia for Christmas 1999 entertaining thoughts of transferring, with his Notre Dame future seemingly spiraling into a black hole. 
Ingelsby had started all but two games at point guard during his first two years, both under then-coach John MacLeod, but during the first months of his junior season under Doherty, he'd slid out of the starting five and further and further down the bench.. 
Ingelsby began the season sharing guard duties with senior Jimmy Dillon. In a sea­son-opening 59-57 upset of Ohio State, Ingelsby scored 14 points, including two 3­pointers in the final two-and-a-half min­utes. He remained in the starting lineup through the sixth game of the year, but in an overtime loss to Indiana, he saw just 11 minutes of court time. 
The next game, Ingelsby found himself beginning the game in his warm-up clothes. He never learned what caused the demotion. 
"There was really no explanation for why it happened," Ingelsby said. "It was just like, something had to change, and it was me." 
Questions began creeping into the for­mer Pennsylvania player of the year's mind. What was wrong? Could he get more playing time elsewhere? Should he stay at Notre Dame? 
He talked things through with his par­ents, Tom and Rose Ingelsby, who told him 
one-on-one

to pray about it and hang in there. 
"He hit a little bump in the road last year," said Tom Ingelsby, a former NBA player who coached Martin's Archbishop Carroll High School team. "I think he han­dled it maybe better than some of us did. He handled it with a lot of class, and he never lost his self-esteem. He hung in there and stayed competitive, and then this year he's come back and had a very, very solid season." 
Ingelsby read and reread an Abe Lincoln quote sent by his younger brother that read, "I will prepare, and sometime, my day will come." He got support from guys on the team, especially fellow Philly native Matt Carroll, then a freshman. He learned who his real friends were -the ones who stuck with him as close as his Fisher Hall roommates. 
Ingelsby filed all the suggestions away, then made his own decision. Despite the unsettling year in which his playing time dwindled to single digit minutes by sea­son's end, he didn't waver. 
"I made a commitment to Notre Dame, and I was going to stay for four years no matter what," he said. "I thought about it [transferring], but I knew I had to deal with adversity. I was going to make the best of it. I just wanted to come in and work hard, and hopefully things would change." 
Through it all, the unflappable Ingelsby stayed behind his team and his coach. No matter how much the situation bothered him, he wasn't one to cause a scene. 
As a result, few people realized how tough the benching was on him. He'd had a basketball in hand "since he was born," although his dad estimated Ingelsby didn't 
. begin organized basketball until the ripe old age of 5, so to have the game pulled from under him was unnerving. Not only was the 1999-2000 season frus­trating for Ingelsby individually, it was dif~ ficult from a team standpoint as well. The Irish just missed an NCAA Tournament bid, instead being disappointed with an NIT berth, where they lost in the finals. "I felt that if Martin had played more last year, they would have been in the NCAAs," said MacLeod, who recruited Ingelsby. "With Martin out there, the guy playing Martin can't leave because Martin's going to make a lot of shots." Ingelsby wasn't sure how his final year would develop, if he would get the starting nod once Dillon graduated, but he decided to remain at Notre Dame long enough to find out. 
A Perfect Match 
The answer came last July when Brey took over as head coach. One of the first moves for the former Delaware coach was to drive up to Philadelphia, take Ingelsby out to dinner and tell him what he had in mind for the senior-to-be. 
"One of the biggest changes was when Coach Brey came up to my house,"
