NewSMC alcohol policy outlined 
By LIZ HARTER Saint Mary's Editor 
As Saint Mary's students came back to campus last week they were met with a new alcohol policy outlined in the College's Code of Student Conduct that was distributed by Slandah Dieujuste, the director of residence life and judicial affairs. The policy, introduced on Aug. 21, has been mentioned in many of the mandatory section meet­ings resident assistants (RAs) held with their residents throughout the week. 
While the alcohol policy did not change drastically, accord­ing to Dieujuste, it was rewrit­ten by a small group of admin­istrators and students to "pro­vide students with as much information about the commu­nity values and the conduct process." 
The policy now places a limit on the amount of alcohol stu­dents who are over 21 can have in their rooms at one time. It also outlines Medical Amnesty and "Good Samaritan" policies and allows students who are 21 to pos­sess alcohol in their rooms even if their roommate is not

Just three years after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, students from the area are anticipating the outcome of Hurricane Gustav, and remembering the last time a hurricane headed for their homes.

Student Government plans for eventful year 
Improving town-gown relations, increasing political interest among Reish, Schmidt's initiatives 
ByJENN METZ News Editor 
Sitting in the Student Government office on the second floor of LaFortune, student body president Bob Reish held up a sheet of paper with a long list of ideas. 
"Hopefully some of these will actually work, and I think the majority of them will, so we're really excited," he said. 
Reish, along with student body vice president Grant Schmidt, explained some of those ideas to The Observer, detailing their agenda for the 2008-2009 aca­demic year. 
The pair, elected in the spring, have separated their responsibili­ties, each tackling individual proj­ects that together will focus pri­marily in engaging the student body as a whole in student gov­ernment and in the goings-on of the University, keeping in tune with one of their campaign plat­forms: bridging the gap.

Bishop ordains three 
Holy Cross deacons 
By JOHN-PAUL WITT News Wrirer 
Three seminarians were ordained as deacons Sunday in the chapel of Moreau Seminary. 
Aaron Michka, Vincent Kuna and Dr. Charles McCoy were ordained by Bishop John I>'Arcy of the Diocese of Ft. Wayne-South Bend. 
As the new deacons were ordained, Bishop D'Arcy pre­sented them with a book of the Gospels, instructing each to "Believe what you read, teach what you believe, and practice what you teach." 
Bishop f)'Arcy instructed the new deacons that the key to being a good minister is "over­coming self-centeredness," because the work of a minister is "not about me, it's about the word we preach," he said. 
The responsibilities of a dea­con include witnessing mar­riages, performing funeral rites, performing baptisms, and reading the Gospel in Mass, according to Bishop D'Arcy. But unlike priests, deacons cannot celebrate a Mass, hear confes­sions, or give last rites. 
Prior to their ordination Sunday, the three professed vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience in the Congregation of lloly Cross in Sacred Heart Basilica Saturday. 
This ceremony made the men full members of the congrega­tion, since they pledged them-

Their ini­


tiatives for Reish this year include making a more political­ly-active campus, getting more freshmen involved in student government and improving com­munity relations with South wake. 
He, along with other Notre Dame students who claim Louisiana as their home state, remember anticipating that storm on the eve of Hurricane Gustav. 
Gustav was downgraded to a Category 3 storm Sunday, according to the meteorolo­gists at the National Weather Service, a classifi­cation it is expected to keep when it is forecast to make landfall today. 
Cordes, a native of New Orleans, has lived in his home for 21 out of his 22 years. During Katrina, his

Reish and Schmidt have been working with a number of groups on campus, they said, to set up a mock election, to take place ten­tatively in October. 
"We want to make sure we at least provide a channel for Notre Dame studento; to be able to dis­cuss what's going on, to be able to debate, to be able to stand behind their own stance that they've developed, to be able to learn from other students,"

ND student starts waterski club 
SAO approves new RecSports club, members to practice in Michigan 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 

Junior Adam Carlson knows that when people think Notre Dame, they don't usually think water­skiing. But he's hoping the newly-formed waterski club can change that. 
Waterskiing was approved as an official student group by the Student Activities Office (SAO) in August and now it is a club under RecSports, said Carlson, the group's founder. 
But there won't be any waterskiing on Notre Dame's campus, he said.

Day partying 
In thrn1~ full years of higher edu­
c.ation I have learned quito a bit. I 
try to pass on as much of that 
information as is possible. From 
the philosophy of Socratns to how 
to properly smuggln food from tho 
dining halls. I know all of these 
will hnlp me in the future. One 
week into my 

senior campaign Dan Murphy 
I think I have 

discovered one Sports Editor 
of the more 
important 

nuggets of wisdom of my career ­
the art of the day party. 

Day partying is the often under­used tool of euphoria that consists of a group of people who gather in a large outdoor area to drink, eat, and play any lawn game you deem appropriate. Wikipedia and dic­tionary.com have yet to post any definitions of day partying so that one is my own and open to improvements. 
With football games, assign­ments, and South Bend winters looming in the not so distant future I urge all of you to take advantage while you can. I can say from per­sonal experience, there is nothing else on earth that is quite like a day party done right. 
For most of my college life I would anxiously await the sunset before cracking a beer (O'Douls before I was of legal age of course). But we all must learn to open our minds and think outside the box of usual social events. We are not vampires, there's no rea­son to hide from the great out­doors. Don't let the drinking con­ventions or past generations hold you back. 
I realize for some of you, hope­fully not too many, it might bB nerve-racking deciding what to do when you can elBarly sne and hear members of the opposite sex in a social situation. It certainly was for me. llern arr~ a few suggestions for aetivitins to hold you up without the crutch of pounding Journey music and dark, smoke-filled rooms. 
Beer Pong and other convention­al drinking games get a little more exciting when played in the great outdoors. but make surn to keep a few extra water cups nearby because twigs and dirt in your beer will put a damper on your day. 
A Bean Bag set is also a staple of the day party experience. Bags, also commonly referrnd to as Cornholn, is a fun gamn for all to play and allows each player to con­sume at their own pace. A set is easy to put togBthnr with a trip to Lowe's or llome Depot. I would suggest going all out and giving your set a nice paint job. This pro­vides for a solid c.onversation piec.n for after you ask your new friend where they are from. what dorm they live in, and what they are studying. 
Other more extravagant items that I would highly suggest include a vollnyball net, kiddy pool, boece set or slip-and-slide. 
But with musie, beer, and sun­shine anything else you c.an dream up is just king on the c.ake. Go out there and party it up.

Man finds dead shark in Lake Michigan 
TRAVEHSE CITY. Mich. -There's no telling what might turn up in Lake Michigan. 
Hieh Fasi of Traverse City says he found a dead 2-foot shark in the water while fishing on West Grand Traverse Bay on Wednesday. 
The saltwater fish was a juvenile blacktip shark, said Mark Tonello, a fish­eries biologist from the Michigan Department of Natural Hesourc.es. 
Tonello said someone might have eaught the shark off the Atlantic 
Coast and kept it on iee while bringing it to north­ern Michigan. 
Another possibility is that the dead shark was dumped by someone who had kept it as a pet, Tonello said. 
Museum wont remove "blasphemous" art 
HOME -An Italian museum Thursday defied Pope Benedict and refused to remove a mod­ern art seulpture portray­ing a erucified green frog holding a beer mug and an egg that the Vatican had c.ondemned as blas­phemous. 
The board of the Museion museum in the northern eity of Bolzano deeided by a majority vote that the frog was a work of art and would stay in place for the remainder of an exhibi­tion. 
The wooden sculpture by the late German artist Martin Kippenberger depicts a frog about 1 meter 30 em (4 feet) high nailed to brown cross and holding a beer mug in one outstretehed hand and an egg in another.

Saint Mary's opens nevv ye·ar vvith mass 
By SARAH MAYER 
News Writer 
Father John Pearson, of Saint Mary's Campus Ministry, discussed the hidden beauty found in everything at the Saint Mary's opening mass Sunday. 
Before mass, Sister Hosanne, who lives in the Saint Mary's Convent, said there was not enough room for all the Holy Cross sisters that wanted to attend in the church but they were watch­ing through closed circuit tel­evisions. 
"They are praying for you on a regular basis," she said. Pearson presided over the Mass. 
He started his homily with a prayer from Saint Augustine. The prayer highlighted the beauty that is all around us, which was the theme for the mass. 
With the great weather out­side, "it's easy to say wheh we see all the beauty we see today that it is a glorious Earth, but when the wind is howling and the branches are frozen, that is when we have to see God's beauty," Pearson said. 
He said that when the beau­ty changes, God does not change, and pointed out the beauty found in every person in the students' lives. 
"Think of all the security workers and dining hall staff. When asked about Saint Mary's College they would say, we're beautiful because we reflect the Lord," he said. 
He said beauty can also be in things students might find unpleasant. 
"Think of your roommate, your RA, or the grass cutter who cuts the grass at 6 a.m. 
and you just wish he would wait till 8 a.m. They're beau­tiful because they are trying to do God's work," he said. 
Pearson explained that the beauty he was talking about was present because of the students' search for God's will. 
"As a Saint Mary's commu­nity we are all trying to find our own way. We are a group of people finding out what God wants us to do," he said. "Even if we have trouble find­ing that out, who is to say we are not beautiful?" 
He reminded the students present of the importance of the Holy Cross family and the Holy Cross education. Heferring back the founder Basil Moreau, Pearson stressed the need to educate the heart just as much as the mind. 
"Whether we succeed or fail," Pearson said, "we have no right to say we are beat, because God created us and our God is beautiful." 
At the end of Mass, College president Carol Ann Mooney spoke about the concept of community. 
"Our Catholic school is part of the Holy Cross family. This family benefits society because take our education and put forth it in all of our efforts, and there for, society is better," she said. 
As a gesture of unity, Mooney gave lighted candles to eight members of different academic and administrative departments on campus and a representative from each of the four classes. The students received the candles with the message "receive light and alter you, as Jesus promised."

ND students 'disabled' for day 
Architecture students experience what it's like to be disabled first hand 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 

Last Friday fourth-year archi­tecture students had the opportu­nity to walk in a disabled person's shoes -or, in some cases, crutch and wheel around Notre Dame's campus as part of a day-long event sponsored by University Disability Services and the School of Architecture to help students understand the importance 'of designing with all people in mind, according to a University press release. 
The 4 7 architecture students experienced three different phys­ical handicaps -some had to be on crutches for part of the day, others were confined to wheel­chairs, and others walked around with blindfolds simulating indi­viduals who were physically handicapped or blind. Additionally, some students had the task of leading others around campus, according to senior Tereza Schiable. 
Architecture students in their fourth year are required to focus on regulation codes and accessi­bility in their designs, she said. 
"Empowerment, inclusion and independence are things that we should strive for in our designs," she said. "We should make peo­ple who are handicap feel like they could get around in any building that we designed." 
Students followed their normal class schedules in the morning, navigated Notre Dame Stadium in the afternoon and attended a lecture presented by Jack Catlin and Gigi McCabe-Miele of LCM Architects on designing in com­pliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to a University press release. 
According to Schaible, this was the first year that the School o( Architecture, in conjunction with the Office of the University Architect, has teamed up with Disability Services to host such an event. 
The day's experiences offered different perspectives on the challenges of being a disabled student on campus, she said. 
"There were a lot of things I had never really noticed before. It was really hard to get up the ramp of LaFortune [Student Center] in a wheelchair," she said. "It made us more aware of how a small thing such as the steepness of a ramp can really affect people with disabilities." 
Senior Brian Droste said his experiences on crutches and in a wheelchair presented challenges to getting around campus that he had not noticed before. 
"One thing I was most sur­prised by was that none of the sidewalks of campus are com­pletely flat. You were constantly having to correct yourself in a wheelchair," he said. 
Droste said he was surprised how difficult it was to climb ramps in a wheelchair. 
He added that he was disap­pointed in how the handicap ramp of LaFortune is used. 
"The garbage that gets taken out [of LaFortune] is taken down the ramp. The ramp is stained with garbage juice and smells terrible," Droste said. "The humiliation of rolling across garbage juice was really eye­opening and frustrating." 
Schaible also said she noticed how disorienting being in the din­ing hall was when she was blind­folded. 
"It was really overwhelming because you could hear people all around you," she said. 
While some buildings on cam­pus presented challenges, others were more accessible, Droste said. 
Notre Dame Stadium was one such area that made it easy for people with physical handicaps to get around, he said. 
"Surprisingly, it was easy to get around the stadium. The handi­cap section has an excellent view, although there is no handicap seating for wheelchairs in the student section," he said. 

Schaible explained that the day's events were an eye-opening experience for architecture stu­dents because it stressed the importance of universal design. 
"It was an important experi­ence for us because we have to learn how to design with all peo­ple in mind ... Designs have to be accessible to everyone without just adding a handicap ramp last minute, so that you are not sepa­rating or disrespecting people," she said. 
Additionally, Droste said the event made him realize how the smallest details can affect how disabled people enter buildings and get around campus on a daily basis. 
"I learned how every little detail makes a huge difference­an inch or two can really make someone's life a lot easier whether it's the width of a door to a bathroom or wheeling up to computer and not being able to fit under the desk," Droste said. "These are things people take for granted. We have to think about how to incorporate everybody to get into a building without having to go in the back way." 
The day's events will impact the work he does in the future, Droste said. 
"I have a newfound respect for people who deal with [disabili­ties]. It was a really positive expe­rience for us to draw on in our designs or in policy," he said. 
Last Friday will also have an impact on Schiable's outlook, she said. 
"Most of us really enjoyed learning from the experience. It is something that will stay with me for a while," Schaible said.

Reish 
continued from page 1 
Schmidt said. 
The two stressed the impor­tance of this year being an elec­tion year that will culminate in historic results, regardless of what ticket wins. 
The University, through a letter signed by Reish and University president Father John Jenkins, will formally invite Senator Barack Obama and Senator John McCain to campus, a formality that has been in place since 1952, Reish said. 
"This is on behalf of the entire University -This will be one big venue, Notre Dame as a whole," he said. 
"I think the clarification that we make," Schmidt said, "is that it's not a rally, it's not a campaign event. We're not being partisan in any way, we're not being biased. We're trying to inform the student body of [the candidates'] policies, of their stances, and of their beliefs." 
Possible topics of discussion during the candidates' potential visit to campus might include issues particularly affecting the state of Indiana, college students or family values, Schmidt said. 
"They will educate, as opposed to campaign," he said. 
Another Heish-Schmidt initiative is the student census, a student government survey to be con­duced once a semester covering a variety of topics in relation to stu­dent life, including academics, athletics and social concerns, Reish said. 
"So many times, I think student government does things because we think they're good for the stu­dent body. We're elected repre­sentatives and [these changes] will be a direct result of student voice. And I think that is what our over­all dream would be," Reish said. 
The one area the census will not cover is the inner workings of stu­dent government itself, they said. 
"As far as student government, we have a clear vision, but it's kind of behind the scenes," Reish said. "I don't think students are necessarily going to see those changes, but I think it's going to bring about an improvement for the student body in the future. We might not see the direct benefits." 
The pair said they will focus other efforts on improving student life, including working to initiate using Domer Dollars off campus, an issue explored last spring, as well as launching a free DVD rental system, predicted to begin sometime in September. 
In order to increase the fresh­men involvement in student gov­ernment, Reish and Schmidt are introducing a new program: the Freshman Leadership Experience (FLEX). 
"This is a whole new venue; it's never been done before at Notre Dame," Reish said. · 
The FLEX program will be sep­arate from the freshmen class council, immersing between 25 and 30 students in student gov­ernment, "essentially doubling the amount of people getting involved with student government," he said. 
"You're only here four years. lf you can plant the seed earlier, hopefully four years from now there'll be more leaders around campus," he said. 
In order to connect with other student governments, Reish and Schmidt are working to establish a Midwest council, comprised of colleges and universities at a com­parable academic level with Notre Dame, like Northwestern and the University of Chicago. 
Other events to begin this year will include the Last Lecture series, something that received a huge response when the pair was running for election, Reish said. The series, which according to the pair was a Notre Dame program in 2002, will feature professors on campus giving what would be their "last lecture." A book by the same name by Carnegie Mellon University computer science pro­fessor Randy Pausch, who deliv­ered his last lecture in September 2007, has become a national phe­nomenon. 
The pair are working on what they call The Big Event -a cam­pus-wide community service day. 
Schmidt said he is concerned with increasing community rela­tions. He said this year's off-cam­pus fair and Transpo tour of South Bend were successes. 
"There are some opportunities in South Bend that some students don't know about. It's important when you go to a University to at least know you're surrounding area, and people know about South Bend as much as the city would like," he said. 

Their efforts regarding this year's forum on sustainable ener­gy will materialize after the event on Sept. 24, they said. 
Plans for a "What's the deal?'' question series are also in effect, which will explain some of the lit­tle-known but important facts about why things are the way they are at the University, Reish said. 
Reish and Schmidt said they hope to make their office more student-friendly. "I think some­times student government is seen as a stiff organization and we're trying to make sure it's welcoming in here," Reish said. "We're nor­mal kids."

21, as long as the underage roommate is not consuming the akohol. The person who is 21 must be present if there is an open container of aleohol in the room, like a beer can or bottle, that cannot be recapped, and students under 21 who do not reside in the room may not bB present if anyone is drinking. 
Bnforn this year it was illegal to have alcohol in a room in which a student who is under 21 resided. 
"The values listed in the Code of Student Conduct are values that wn have always held as a community but never spnllnd ·out in writing," Dinujustn said. "The difference Ibntwenn our old alcohol policy and tlw nnw onel is that it is now being spelled out more explicitly." 
She said the biggest changes to the policy arc the Medical Amnesty and "Good Samaritan" policies which worn put in writing beeause the College's primary concern is safety and the committee who put the new poliey togeth­er wanted to "make it dear to students that wn would never want them to jeopardizi~ thnir safety for fear of getting in troubln," she said. 
The Mndical Amnesty policy allows students to seek assis­tance during an alcohol or ollwr drug-related emergency without facing disciplinary aelion for possessing or using the aleohol or drugs as long as the student contaets the police, College security or a member of the residenee life staff' for lwlp. 
Aeeording to the Code of Student Conduct, the student reeeiving medical assistance would then be required to meet with a member of' the counseling staff' for an assess­nwnt within live College busi­ness days and as long as the student complies with all directives from the counseling staff she will not face discipli­nary actions for the aleohol or

selves to live as unmarried mfm in community with other mem­bers of tlw congregation, which is found in the United States as well as "in service to others in Latin Anwriea, Africa, Asia and across the world," according to remarks made Sunday by Father Peter Hocca. 
The three had all been Notre Dame students prior to entering the seminary. 
Dr. McCoy completed a PhD in mathematics in 2000 from Notre Dame. Kuna graduated with a Bachelor's of Business Administration from Notre Damn in 1999, and Michka graduated in 2004 from the Old Collegn undergraduate semi­nary at Notre Dame. 
The ordination comes after seminary studies of' four years for Mil:hka and six years for Dr. Md:oy and Kuna, in which the candidates studiml philosophy and theology, completing a Masters in Divinity degree at Notre Dame, according to Father Pete McCormick, the assistant dire<:tor of vocations for thn Indiana province of the Congregation of lloly Cross and rndor of' Keough IIall. 
In addition to classroom work, t.lw thnw nwn comp!Pted "pas­drug violations. 
The Good Samaritan policy is similar, though it has to do with providing safety for stu­dents who may seek medical help for an intoxicated student. 
It states that "as members of Ithe Saint Mary's] community, students have a responsibility to each other," and states that a student will not face discipli­nary action for possession or use of alcohol or drugs if she remains with the individual until medical assistance arrives. To qualify for this poli­cy the student must contact the police, College security or a mmnber of' the residence life staff and schedule an appoint­ment with Dieujuste. 
Many students think these new policies are helpful and give a more safety conscious atmosphere to campus. 
Senior Jessica Sobczyk said she thinks these policies will provide students with more of an incentive to help their friends if there is a potential medical emergency. She said she thinks students weren't going to their HAs or other authority ligures during possi­ble medical emergencies because they were afraid of getting in trouble. 
"They seem like good policies that could help keep students safe," she said. 
While Sobczyk thinks the Medical Amnesty and Good Samaritan polices arc good, she has a problem with the second half' of the new alcohol policy -the limit on the amount of alcohol a student can possess in their room. 
The College has always had a "subjective limit" on the amount of alcohol a student can personally possess though it was never a defined amount," Dieujuste said. This year though, the subjective limit is now specific. Students may possess either one 12­pack of beer, one half-gallon of wine or one pint of hard liquor. liard liquor was never out­lawed on Saint Mary's campus even though it was banned from Notre Dame in 2002. 
This limit was placed on stu­dents because the committee that rewrote the policy 
toral" or service assignments, ranging from working in a parish to working with troubled kids in a juvenile justice center. 
"These men completnd sever­al years of study of philosophy and theology as well as ministry assignments that helped each one determine where best to use their individual gifts in preparation for being ordained," Fr. McCormick said. 
The men will serve as "transi­tory," or temporary, deacons, charged with "proelaiming the Gospel and performing works of charity with the help of God," Bishop D'Arcy said. 
"They will be recognized as men who came not to be served, but to serve," Bishop D'Arcy said, "They have consecrated themselves to God forever." 
Generally, deacons ordained at Notre Dame can serve as assistant rectors in dorms, work in lloly Cross parishes around the world or work in Campus Ministry at a lloly Cross univer­sity, depending on the individual skills of the new deacon. 
For the next year, Kuna and Dr. McCoy will serve in parishes in the United States while Michka will be assigned to Monterrey, Mexico. All three are to be ordained as priests in April 2009.

believed it made sense to be 
more explicit about what 
amount of alcohol is consid­
ered personal use, Dieujuste 
said. 

"We understand that a stu­dent's room is her home and we trust our of-aged students," she said. "[But] it made sense to allow of-aged students to consume alcohol in their room while reminding them of their responsibilities." 
Sobczyk, who is 21, thinks this limit is too strict and makes it seem like the admin­istration doesn't trust students over 21. 
"While I understand their desire to limit the chance that a resident's room becomes a full service bar, I believe they took the regulations too far," she said. "By the time she's 21 a student should be mature and responsible enough to be able to decide how much alco­hol she would like to keep in her room. I'm sick of feeling like I'm doing something illegal when, if I lived in my own house, I'd be perfectly within my rights." 
Senior and 22-year-old Jessi Porter agreed with Sobczyk's argument saying she has taken a lot of issue with the new poli­cy. 
"I think that if you are over 21 you should be able to decide on your own what is a reasonable amount of alcohol to consume and have readily on hand in their room," she said. 
Dieujustc said while there is a limit on the amount of alco­hol a student can keep in their room the HAs and staff will not be going into student rooms to cheek if students have above that amount nor will they be inspecting students' bags as they enter a building. 
"I see this more coming into play when we have to confront a room where a roommate is over 21 and there is a concern­ing amount of alcohol present in the room," she said. "While, as a 21-year-old, she may have alcohol, that amount must be within limit."

"That was one of the first 
things [RecSportsl told me," 
Carlson said. "'You know 
this isn't going to be on Saint 
Mary's or Saint Joe's lake."' 
Instead, Carlson and his club mates will practice at Indian Lake in Michigan, which is close to Dowagiac, Mich., where Carlson is from. 
Carlson spoke to The Observer on his cell phone Sunday as he stood on a sandbar in Indian Lake. Carlson and some of his friends from Notre Dame had gone away to Carlson's home for the weekend, and were about to go tubing and later waterskiing, Carlson said. 
''I've been waterskiing my entire life, so I've. always been interested in it," he said. 
Carlson's parents arc avid waterskiers, and his l'irst time "skiing" was when he was two years old, when he sat on a platform board that carried him behind the boat. 
"I don't even remember my first time waterskiing, because I've been doing it for so long," he said. 
When he came to Notre Dame, Carlson noticed the University did not have a waterski team, a void that Carlson decided he wanted to fill. The several-month­long SAO club recognition process began last November, Carlson said, and ended with his club being approved in August. 
Through word of mouth, the group's Facebook page and through the RecSports Web site, Carlson said he's contacted by several people interested in waterskiing. 
Fifth-year senior Steven Feutz, the elub's captain, has 18 years of experience as a waterskier, he said. llis dad, a competitive waterski­said. "This morning, I was actually at home skiing with my dad and my brother." 
As captain, Feutz said he'll be coaching the other mem­bers of the team who have less experience. 
"It's a little bit hard to learn," Feutz said. "Just like any sport, you pick it up rea­sonably fast, but then you spend the whole n~st of your life trying to get better." 
The waterski club will start its season next Saturday, Carlson said, with a tournament in Ohio, at a lake about three hours away from Notre Dame. 
Carlson has never compet­ed in a waterski tournament before, but he's been to sev­eral of his brother's tourna­ments. On Saturday, he and other members of the Notre Dame water ski tnam will be competing in three events ­a slalom competition, in which the skiers maneuver around buoys, a trick por­tion. where the skier has twenty seconds to do as many tri1:ks as possible and a jump over a platform. 
Without seeing the compe­tition, Feutz couldn't predict how the new Notre Dame team would do this weekend. 
"I imagine this will be, more than anyone else, a 
learning  experience  for  
everyone," he said.  
It's  too  early  to  tell  

whether Notre Dame will gain recognition for its water skiing, Feutz said. 
"Florida is the waterski capital of the country, but Purdue is one of the top 10 water ski schools in the country, so if' we keep devel­oping it, we can certainly generate interest and improve our ranking," he said. 
The team will compete in at least one more tourna­ment this year, Carlson said. The water ski club will hold a meeting for all interested skiers at 7 p.m. Wednesday in room 306 of LaFortune.

age 6, he said. Contact Kaidynn Riely at "It's a family thing," Feutz kriely@nd.edu

Report: U.S. troops fired at first 
KABUL, Afghanistan -An Afghan army commander said that U.S. and Afghan troops were fired on first from a village where a government investigative commis­sion says scores of civilians were killed, according to a report released Sunday. 
The chief of staff for the army's Herat corps told the head of the government's investigative commission that shots were fired early Aug. 22 from Azizabad at U.S. and Afghan troops. The troops had gone to the village on a raid. 
But the report, released by the office of President Hamid Karzai, did not specify who fired the shots. 
"When the ANA (Afghan army) and coali­tion troops got close to the village, firing started after the ANA unit stopped, and the coalition forces conducted the operation in the village," the report said. 
Russia to aid separatist regions 
MOSCOW -Russia's president said Sunday his country will give military aid to the two separatist regions at the center of the war with Georgia -signaling Moscow has no intention of backing down in the face of Western pressure. 
Dmitry Medvedev also warned that American domination of world affairs is unacceptable, though he insisted that Russia did not want hostile relations with the United States and other Western nations. 
Medvedev's decision Tuesday to recognize the Georgian breakaway provinces South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent drew condemnation from the West. Though no other countries have followed Russia's lead, Medvedev reaffirmed the decision on Sunday.

Quarantine ends at two hospitals 
EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. -One of two Missouri hospital emergency rooms reopened Sunday, a day after being shut down under quarantine when eight people sickened by a dangerous chemical's release sought treatment. 
Price McCarty, an FBI spokesman in Springfield, Ill., said the chemical release Saturday at the Ro-Corp. plant caused no deaths, countering a statement earlier Sunday by an East St. Louis' city official that two people had died. 
The chemical, which authorities said was likely the highly toxic material nitroaniline, was released when a barrel was dropped at the Ro-Corp. plant. 
The eight people sickened -identified by the FBI as mostly Ro-Corp. workers ­remained hospitalized Sunday. 

Michigan mayor offers plea deal 
DETROIT -Lawyers for Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick have proposed a deal in which he would plead guilty to two felonies, make restitution and serve five years' pro­bation in exchange for avoiding jail time, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
The Detroit Free Press quoted "a source familiar with all aspects of the negotiations" as saying Kilpatrick's legal team also said he would give up his law license, not run for office for two years and do 300 hours of community service.

FORT WAYNE, Ind. -Gov. Mitch Daniels logged about 85 percent as many flights in state aircraft in the first seven months of this election year as he did all of last year, a newspaper study found. 
Daniels used state aircraft -primarily two state police airplanes and a Department of Transportation helicopter -52 times in the first seven months of this year, com­pared with 61 flights during 2007, a review of state records by The Journal Gazette found. 

Gulf Coast waits for storm la11Ldfall 
Katrina devastation on the minds of residents, government three years later 
Associated Press 
NEW .ORLEANS -With a historic evacuation of 1.9 million people from the Louisiana coast complete, gun-toting police and National Guardsmen stood watch as rain started to fall on this city's empty streets Sunday night -and even presidential politics took a back seat as the nation wait­ed to see if Hurricane Gustav would be another Katrina. 
The storm was set to crash ashore midday Monday with frightful force, testing the three years of planning and rebuilding that followed Katrina's devastat­ing blow to the Gulf Coast. 
Painfully aware of the fail­ings that led to that horrific suffering and more than 1,600 deaths, this time offi­cials moved beyond merely insisting tourists and resi­dents leave south Louisiana. They threatened arrest, loaded thousands onto buses and warned that anyone who remained behind would not be rescued. 
"Looters will go directly to jail. You will not get a pass this time," Mayor Ray Nagin said. "You will not have a temporary stay in the city. You will go directly to the Big House."

IN BRIEF 
Boeing union calls for strike 
NEATAC, Wash. -Leaders of Boeing Co.'s Machinists union called Friday for a strike after rejecting the aerospace giant's "best and final" contract offer. They urged union members to reject the offer in a vote set for Wednesday. 
The Chicago-based company hoped the pro­posal, which provides added pay and incentives to workers over three years, would help it avert a labor standoff. The talks come as Boeing tries to keep up with a backlog of plane orders and avoid more penalties caused by production delays of its next-generation passenger jet. 
Tom Wroblewski, district president of International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge 751, said the company's offer fell short in terms ofjob securi­ty, wages and medical coverage, among other areas. 
"We did not take lightly the fact we recom­mended a strike," he told a news conference. "This is not just talking about 27,000 members. This is talking about 27,000 members and their families." 
U.S. income down, spending slows 
WASHINGTON -Personal incomes plunged in July while consumer spending slowed signifi­cantly as the impact of billions of dollars in gov­ernment rebate checks began to wane. 
The Commerce Department reported Friday that personal incomes fell by 0. 7 percent in July, the biggest drop in nearly three years and a far larger decline than the 0.1 percent decrease analysts expected. 
Consumer spending edged up a modest 0.2 percent, in line with expectations, but far below June's 0.6 percent rise. When the impact of ris­ing prices was factored in, spending actually dropped by 0.4 percent in July, the weakest showing for inflation-adjusted spending in more than four years. 
The July performance for incomes and spend­ing reinforced worries that the economy, which posted better-than-expected growth in the spring because' of the rebate checks, could stumble in coming months as their impact fades. 
Gustav prompts rise in gas ~prices 



Fuel cost up for first time in more than six weeks, oil prices still falling 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Retail gas prices swung higher Friday -the first increase in 43 days -as analysts warned that a direct hit on U.S. energy infrastructure by Hurricane Gustav could send pump prices hurtling toward $5 a gallon. 
Meanwhile, oil prices ended the day slightly lower, falling for a second straight session. But prices fluctuated sharply as some traders feared supply dis­ruptions and others bet the government will release supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if Gustav wreaks havoc in the Gulf of Mexico area ­home to a quarter of U.S. crude supplies and 40 per­cent of refming capacity.

Department of News and Information's reckoning­have taken the first steps toward get­ting something the majority of Americans (75.5 percent of them, give or take one tenth of one percent) don't have: a college degree. Let that sink in for a moment. Fewer than one in evPry four Americans over the age of 1 S have a college degrHe, according to the Census Bureau's 2006 American Community Survey. 
Of course, exactly what that degree does for you is a bit vaguer. The Census Bureau, naturally, has a statis­tical answer. It sets the value of a bachelor's degree quite literally: about $2 million over the course of a life­time, which, you might tell whoever pays your tuition, is not a bad return on investment. Plenty of artieles and web sites describe what a bachelor's degree gets you in economic terms as well, if a little more subtly ("a secure future that comes with a steady pro­fession that can ride out any economic rollercoaster," or "more prestigious employment and greater job satisfac-

tion"). Others can only resort to the sort of empty, meaningless language of second-rate pitchmen or motivational speakers, saying that a degree "teach­es you to solve more of life's prob­lems" or lets you "tap into your poten­tial and challenges you to perform at your peak." 
Explaining the worth of a degree in these terms isn't particularly satisfy­ing. Truthfully, I think it borders on insulting; surely all you future degree­holders didn't decide to come here based on a dollar amount or a bit of marketing jargon. How else to summa­rize the college experience, then? Is it the sum of classes taken, papers writ­ten, languages learned and groups joined, or does that make it seem like mere skills-building and vocational training-everything that a liberal arts education claims not to be (and what does it mean if we don't, for example, perfectly remember how to solve differential equations or the causes of the French Hevolution)? Is it something more intangible and immeasurable, like promoting abstract and complex thought or Socratic self­reflection? Or is it just supposed to provoke a deep-seated sense of rest­lessness and world-weariness? There probably isn't a good answer to this dilemma, and even if therp, was, it wouldn't fit in a Viewpoint column (personally, I think it's the third option, particularly for degree holders in the humanities). At the very least, 
however, it is worth asking what wp,'re doing here, and exactly what it means -if it means anything at all -to join the degree-holding minority of the population. 
Finally, therP is the matter of evPry­one else. Some combination of ability, hard work, preparation, circum­stances and luck got each of' you here and will get the vast majority of' you through to getting that diploma. And once you get it you'll be a part of an exclusive elub of' degree holders-an elite, if you like. But I'd also be willing to bet that many of you go on to jobs where, for whatever reason, you prob­ably won't work with people outside of this elite, at least not as peers or equals. Amid all the beginning-of-the­year talk about the Notre Dame bub­ble, it's easy to forget that it can go on l'or a lot longnr than thn l'our or so years that you're here. You could probably go through life thinking that getting a degree, nspceially one from Notre Dame, also confers a monopoly on thoughtfulness, curiosity or intelli­gence. But if that's all you've taken away from college, then you might wonder if, in fact, you have really learned anything.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Campus construction ugly and inconvenient 

I would like to express my frustration with the overwhelming amount of construction going on around campus this fall. After a long, relaxing sum­mer, I came back to what is comparable to down­town Baghdad right in front of my own dorm, not to mention the travesties being constructed by the main entrance. Scaffolding on the Basilica when the students and their families come back? Great timing. 
I have tried to contact the University architect on numerous occasions, but he either screens my calls or I am referred to someone else. Sir, under your direction, this beautiful university has been trans­formed into a severely obtuse conglomerate of con­struction equipment and questionable contractors. 
·Edifices like Jordan Hall of Science, Duncan Hall and the Gug look like giant scabs on the face of Our Lady. There are not nearly enough cemented walk­ways for student accessibility and the amount of unnecessary trees that are planted every year is staggering. I suggest that you start working towards making us proud of our campus; you are starting to make Stepan Center look brilliant. 
Rusty Marsh sophomore Siegfried Hall Aug. 28 

Price changes irresponisib le 
Upon returning to campus, I was disappointed to learn that printing on computer lab and dorm printers is now priced at 10 cents per page instead of 10 cents per sheet as it has been in the past. As a result, double-sided printouts cost 20 cents instead of 10 and there is no fmancial incen­tive to save paper and print on both sides of a page. With the University's emphasis on sustainability this year, it is disappointing to see the incentive removed for this environ­mentally friendly practice.

Offshore oil drilling fails to tap into basic logic 
Ever seen that bumper sticker that reads "Four­thirds of Americans don't understand fractions?" Well it may be a joke, but it's no laughing matter that a recent survey shows three-fourths of Americans support increased offshore drilling. They're wrong and the entire 
U.S. economy and foreign rela­Ryan Quinn tions -not just the polar bears -will pay for it if they don't 
The Daily 

wise up. 
Gamecock

It seems simple, right? We don't have enough oil right now, so we just get some more. In the Atlantic, the Artie, the Amazon, wherever, it doesn't matter. But the fact is that we won't be able to extract any crude oil for another 10 years. We'll have to run the legislation through a gauntlet of vetoing Democrats, build the oil rigs, the refineries and the pipelines and even after all of that, experts indicate that the amount of oil extracted will likely be minimal. 
But everyone already knows that. So why the 75 percent support rate? Because pro-drillers, includ­ing John McCain and the governor of the great state of South Carolina, have extolled the "psychological factor" of building our own plants, citing that since the oil market is based largely on speculation, the mere threat of drilling our own oil will drive prices down. 
True, speculation does affect prices, but are they really insinuating that OPEC -the people who actu­ally control the world's oil supply-don't know that it will take 10 years for the first drop of oil? And fur­thermore, that OPEC doesn't understand that it will still control the majority of U.S. oil when the decade is up? Ludicrous. 
Barack Obama stated recently that his energy poli­cy, which promises nearly 100 percent independence from foreign oil, will take no more than ten years to complete. But even that promise is fading quickly. As the race between Obama and McCain tightens, Obama has began pandering to that stubborn three­fourths by reversing his position, allowing limited offshore drilling along with his initial plans. 
Worse yet, he has suggested releasing 70,000 bar­rels from the Strategic Oil Reserve. Not only has this tactic been denounced by experts as fruitless in reducing prices, it is worrisome to all those con­cerned with homeland security and has neocons Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh ranting about how it'll be impossible conquer Europe if American tanks don't have gas in their engines.· This is especially sad since Obama had denounced the gimmicky gas-tax holiday. 
Unless these three-fourths wise up soon, there won't even be an alternative energy policy to endorse. Then it'll be too late to change opinions, and that is something that our wallets, cars, children and yes, even the polar bears, will never let us for­get.

COLUMBUS, Ohio -The Beanie watch is on for the Buckeyes. 
A day after Ohio State star Chris "Beanie" Wells fell back in a heap with an injured right foot, the sec­ond-ranked Buckeyes could do nothing but wait and hope that their Reisman Trophy contender would be quick to recover. 
Wells went down early in the third quarter of a 43-0 victory Saturday against overmatched Youngstown State. 
Ohio State spokeswoman Shelly Poe sent an e-mail to reporters Sunday, restating that Wells had no broken bones. 

"It's not likely that there will be any update until probably after some initial treatments and therapy," she wrote. 
Coach Jim Tressel said Saturday team doctors told him the X-rays were nega­tive and the injury was not turf toe. 
Ohio State can probably get by without Wells on Saturday when the Buckeyes host Ohio. That's not the case the following week, when they visit No. 3 Southern California in a huge nonconference. 
"You see one of the guys go down and you hope he's all right," linebacker James Laurinaitis said after the game. "Chris is a tough guy. I hope it's not serious. 
You hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground." 

Judging from how Wells writhed on the field in pain, the injury did not appear to be a minor one. A crowd of more than 105,000 thought so too. The Horseshoe was practically silent for several minutes while doctors and trainers attended to Wells near the goal line. 
"I may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before," Wells said through Poe moments after the game. "Something just didn't feel right. Then I think I felt a pop. But the X-rays are OK, so we'll see how it feels in a day or two." 
Wells, who has been hin­dered by nagging injuries throughout his college career, fell to the ground in pain before he was even hit after taking a handoff at the Youngstown State 2. He fumbled the ball away before there was contact, then fell backward while medical personnel rushed to his side. Tressel even ran onto the field. 
"As I handed the ball back, he didn't even grab the balL" quarterback Todd Boeckman said. "I didn't know what to expect, didn't know what he did. He went down and he was in some serious pain." 
After he was helped off the field, Wells was put on a motorized cart and taken to the locker room.

As Federer made that signal, the 1970s song "Still the One" by Orlnans rang out through Arthur A'ihe Stadium on Sunday, mark­ing the end of the four-time defending champion's 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over 28th-seeded Hadek Stepanek in the U.S. Opnn's third round. 
Aetually. for the first time in a while, Fnderer is not No. 1 -in th11 seedings for the hard-court (;rand Slam tournament or in the ATP rankings. Those honors bdong to Hafad Nadal, who bmtt Fndnn)r in thn lopsided French Open and npie Wimbledon finals and hL'it wnnk Pnded his record

"That's the advantagn I havn. If I were to win a big tournament again, one of those Slams, what­Pvor, right away I have tho invin­dbility fa<:tor again, which is grnat tiw mo." he said. "So that's what I'm working li1r. I was that dosn in Wimbledon. so I hopn to go a stPp further and win it this timn." 
It's bnen a poor-by-his-stan­dards -and. lot's bn dnar, only by his lolly standards -smL'ion for Fndernr. whose 12 losses alrnady arn more than he absorbed in any entirn ynar from 2004-07. llis two titles, at minor nvents, are his fewest nntering the U.S. Opnn since 2002.

"If you have to hear about any­

"It's a goal," Jankovic said, "but I want to win a Grand Slam."

"I didn't even really sweat," Hammer said. "I could have played longer." 
Muller looked as though he could have, too, even though his match against Almagro stretched beyond four hours. 
Muller never had come baek from a two-set deficit in his career before doing so in the second round against Tommy llaas. Now he's done it twice in a row -despite winning a dozen fewer points than Alrnagro, 187­175, and making 25 more unforced errors. And Muller broke serve only once all match, in the final game.

Open era -and now the first man or woman from the country to reach the fourth round. 
''I'm the first one actually to do everything. I mean, that's not my goal -to be the best in Luxembourg," he said. 
This isn't his first moment in the spotlight at Flushing Meadows: Muller stunned Hoddick in the first round in 2005. Since then, Only Federer has beaten Roddick at the U.S. Open, in the 2006 final and the 2007 quarterfinals. 
Those are part of Federer's 30 consecutive victories in the hard­court major championship. The three wins this year have all come in straight sets, and Federer was truly tested only briefly by Stepanek. 


Associated Press 

NOHTON, Mass. Sunshine began to bake the greens, the wind kept players guessing and the birdie cheers kept right on coming Sunday in the Deutsche Bank Championship, the final one for Mike Weir. 
His third birdie over the final five holes gave him a 4­under 67 and a one-shot lead. 
And it meant next to noth­ing. 
"I've got my hands full," Weir said after patching together a good score despite marginal shots. 
First came a pair of 63s from Ben Crane and Camilo Villegas, the kind of score no one thought possible in such blustery conditions. Then came the steady surge of Sergio Garcia and Vij ay Singh, and a late charge from Ernie Els and Jim Furyk to set the stage for the Labor Day finish. 
Expect everyone to work extra hard to win the Deutsche Bank Championship. 
"One less than the guy who comes in second," Gareia said when asked what it would take to capture the second stop in the PGA Tour Playoffs for the FedEx Cup. 
It starts with Weir, who hit only half of the fairways and half of the greens. He has been around the lead all week, but had to grind out a score to stay there, ineluding a superb 7-iron to 3 feet on the 14th, chipping in for birdie on the 15th and the l'inal birdie on the 18th. 
Weir was at 17-undnr 196, the 1Oth time the Canadian has had at least a share of the 54-hole lead on the I'GA Tour. lin has converted only of those chances into a victo­ry. 
"There's great players on the leaderboard," Weir said. "Some guys that arn hungry to win for the first time, guys that haven't won many times. and I'm trying to do the same thing. I just want to keep playing my type of golf. Hopefully, I can hit it a little 
better and find  a  few more  
fairways."  
Villegas  ignored  the  

swirling wind and took only 22 putts in his round of 63. which put him in the final group Monday with Weir, one shot behind and perhaps his best chance for his first PC~A Tour victory. 
Three shots bnhind were Garcia (68) and Singh (69), part of the playoff last week at The Barclays that Singh won to move atop the FedEx Cup standings. 
And right behind them were Furyk, who birdied three of his last four holes for a 69; Els, who made eagle on the final hole after nearly holing a S-iron and posting a 69; and Crane, whose 63 carne much earlier in the day. 
Ten players were separated by five shots going into the Labor Day finish, the kind of shootout the Deutsche Bank Championship always seems to produce.

Teatns prepare to flee frotn Gustav's path 
Associated Press 
As Tulane's football team embarked on an unexpected trip to Birmingham, Ala., with Hurricane Gustav on their minds, center Michael Parenton figured it couldn't be any worse than the last time the Green Wave left campus with a major storm threatening Louisiana's coast. 
"We've been through it before and we made it," Parenton said, recalling the 2005 season, when Tulane played all its games on the road after llurricane Katrina flooded most of New Orleans. "We'll be all right." 
Across south Louisiana, col­lege and pro teams spent the weekend packing up and leav­ing their regular training sites for safe havens away from the coast while, in many cases, try­ing to remain focused on the season ahead. 
The New Orleans Saints, who like Tulane spent their entire 2005 regular season outside New Orleans, were in Indianapolis, where they intended to practice until Friday. The Saints tentatively scheduled a Saturday walk­through back in New Orleans, hoping their Sept. 7 regular­season opener against Tampa Bay still can be played in the Louisiana Superdome. 
The New Orleans Zephyrs, the Triple-A affiliate of the New York Mets, canceled their last two home games of the season on Sunday and Monday. 
After canceling its game next Thursday at New Mexico State, Nicholls State's football team told players to evacuate and seek refuge with their families as Gustav threatened to unleash catastrophic damage in the low-lying town of Thibodaux, La., nearly 60 miles southwest of New Orleans, where the school's campus sits. 
Louisiana-Lafayette and McNeese State football players also were told to ride out the storm with their families and stay in touch with coaches, who would give them instructions on when and where to regroup. McNeese spokesman Louis Bonnette said that if Gustav hits Lake Charles hard, as Rita did in 2005, the football team would join the schools' soccer, tennis, volleyball and cross country teams at Northwestern State in Natchitoches, La. 
McNeese's football team has experience with setting up shop on another campus. After Rita left 6 feet of water in Cowboy Stadium, the squad spent sev­eral weeks at Southeastern and had some games canceled or rescheduled. Since the storm, Cowboy Stadium has had lights repaired and a new field installed. 
The Southeastern Louisiana football team left campus in Hammond on Sunday, bound for Oxford, Miss. University spokesman Matt Sullivan said the team had been invited to use practice fields and the weight room at Ole Miss while preparing for next weekend's game at Mississippi State. 
A day after its season-open­ing victory over Appalachian State, LSU held meetings on its Baton Rouge campus, where head coach Les Miles told play­ers to take Monday off and find a safe place to stay before reporting back for team meet­ings tentatively scheduled for Tuesday at 1 p.m. 
"We'll kind of wait this thing out, hopefully come through OK and go from there," LSU spokesman Michael Bonnette said. "First and foremost, Coach Miles' concern is obvi­ously safety for players, staff and their families." 
While hurricane force wind may reach Baton Rouge and knock out municipal electricity, LSU's campus, including foot­ball facilities, have backup power. LSU's next scheduled game is at home this Saturday against Troy. 
The NBA's Hornets, which spent two seasons in Oklahoma City after Hurricane Katrina, are supposed to open training camp in about a month. Their training headquarters are on the West Bank of the Mississippi River, deemed one of the more vulnerable spots on Louisiana's eastern coast to flooding when Gustav pushes water from the Gulf of Mexico inland. 
Because it's the NBA's offsea­son, players were out of town and front-office employees left town to be with friends and rel­atives. However, team spokesman Harold Kaufman, who was with family in Dallas, said majority owner George Shinn had contacted New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin to let him know he was ready to help in the storm's aftermath. 
Parenton, who is from Thibodaux, said he expected Tulane and other teams that were displaced by Katrina and Rita to handle the aftermath of Gustav with strength and lead­ership. 
In 2005, Tulane spent the entire fall semester taking classes and training in Ruston, fmishing 2-9. 
Yet Parenton, now a senior, never thought of it as a lost sea­son. 
"You hear all the horror sto­ries from that year, but when you think about it, it was really something special we went through," Parenton said. "It wasn't anything we signed up for, but to be a member of that team, I'm proud of that and the way we hung togethe.r. I feel like this team can handle the exact same things and be suc­cessful." 


MLB 

Astros rally against Cards 
Padres nip Rockies in ninth thanks to Rodriguez's walk-off single 

Associated Press 
HOUSTON -A three-run deficit doesn't scare a team that's play­ing its best baseball of the season. 
That's why the Houston Astros didn't panic when they got behind by three in the first inning. 
Ty Wigginton and Hunter Pence hit home runs during a six-run first inning and the Houston Astros held on for an 8-5 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday night. 
"It was early in the game," Pence said of the three runs Brian Moehler gave up. "And you know Moehler's going to battle. He ended up pitching a great game for us. You know he's a gutsy guy and he's aggressive and going to give us a chance. We just had to get some runs for him." 
Moehler (10-5) went six innings and allowed three runs and seven hits, striking out a season-high tying six. He improved to 4-0 in seven career starts against the Cardinals. 
"Moehler did a little bit of bend­ing," manager Cecil Cooper said. "He did a great job of keeping us close." 
In the third inning, the Cardinals got a double play on what appeared to be a missed call by second base umpire Marvin Hudson. Pence was on second with one out when Humberto Quintero hit a liner to center field, where Skip Schumaker dove for the ball. 
Schumaker jumped up as ifhe'd made the catch and threw to shortstop Cesar Izturis to double up Pence. As Cooper argued the call with Hudson, replays clearly showed the ball bounced into Schumaker's glove. 
Cooper was ejected from the game. It was his fifth ejection of the season. 
"I was sitting in my seat and saw it," Cooper said. 'Tm an old man and I saw it with my natural eyes. He blew it and he refused to get help. That's the thing that upset me. He said he saw it as no catch. 
"That took a run off the board for us and probably at least a dou­ble away from a kid who's scratching for hits." 
Schumaker admitted the ball hit the ground. 
"I didn't really know what the deal was," he said. "I knew it short-hopped me and I popped up like I caught it. I knew it was a short-hop. I also knew it was a tough one. It was up to the umpire and it was a tough call for him to make." 

Manager Tony La Russa was more concerned with the rough start by Braden Looper. 
Looper (12-11) went 4 1-3 innings and allowed eight runs and 11 hits and three walks to take the loss. 
"He was just up," La Russa said. "That's not his game or anybody's game and he got it up and got nailed. 
Looper had no excuses. 

"Basically, the guys put three runs on the board for me and if I did my job we would have had a good chance to win the game," he said. "Unfortunately, I didn't. 
"I just had to make an adjust­ment and get the ball down. I kept trying to pound the strike zone and get ahead, and I was just missing a lot and falling behind. When you do that, they're going to make you pay." 
The Astros won their fourth straight and improved to 20-9 in the month of August, third best in the National league behind Chicago and Milwaukee. 
San Diego 2, Colorado 1 
Jake Peavy feels like he's pitch­ing as well as ever, even ifhe isn't piling up the wins for the San Diego Padres. 
Peavy had a season-high 13 strikeouts in eight shutout innings before Trevor Hoffman blew the save in San Diego's victory over the Colorado Rockies on Sunday. 
Luis Rodriguez singled in the winning run in the ninth as the Padres handed the Rockies a cost­ly loss in their playoff chase. 
"It's just been one of those years," said Peavy, the 2007 NL Cy Young Award winner. "I feel like I've thrown the ball fairly well. But, of course, the bottom line is 9-9. It's not fun to be a .500 pitcher in the win-loss column. 
"But I can't control wins and losses. I can only control any of the other numbers and I think they are comparable to what I've done in all the good years I've had." 
Peavy limited Colorado to five singles and walked two, throwing 114 pitches. He lowered his ERA to 2.69, second-best in the NL to San Francisco's Tim Lincecum (2.43). 
"It's a big letdown when you think you are going to win, you're one out away from winning and you don't win," Peavy said. "For the team to come right back and score like that, it's huge." 
Hoffman (3-6), the career leader with 551 saves, surren­dered a pinch-hit RBI single to Chris !annetta that tied it at 1. It was his fourth blown save of the year. 
Rookie Will Venable led off the bottom half with a base hit against Taylor Buchholz (6-4) and advanced to third on Brian Giles' one-out single. Rodriguez fol­lowed with his winning hit. 
"I was looking for that pitch," said Rodriguez, who also drove in Peavy with a two-out double in the fifth. "He doesn't want to throw me a good fastball." 
Colorado, which has 24 games left this season, started the day six games back of Arizona in the lackluster NL West. The Diamondbacks hosted the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday night. 
San Diego (53-83), with the sec­ond-worst record in the NL, swept Arizona in a three-game series before taking two of three from the Rockiies. 
"Every loss is difficult, but you run out of games and they have more meaning," Colorado manag­er Clint Hurdle said. "It's hard because your starting pitcher went out there and battled a guy with probably more electricity." 
Jeff Francis kept the Rockies in the game with seven strong innings, allowing one run and six hits. 
But Peavy was tough as he reached double digits in strikeouts for the 27th time in his career and third time this season. 
"It was like I came off the field and I am going right back out again," Francis said. "(Peavy) was having 1-:2-3 innings. He was fan­tastic." 
Peavy, who retired 13 straight batters at one point, did not allow an earned run in a home start for the fifth time this season and has limited the opponent to two earned runs or less in 11 home starts. 
Colorado had a few scoring chances against Peavy, but went 0-for-4 with runners in scoring position. The best scoring oppor­tunity came in the first when Scott Podsednik drew a leadoff walk and stole second with one out. But Peavy struck out Matt Holliday and Brad Hawpe. 
Peavy's 13 Ks also tied the major league single-game high this season, done eight times pre­viously.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. -Hich Brooks knows Kentueky's young and inexp<~rieneed oll"ensn isn't going to seam any­body.

Kentueky returned two Louisville fumbles for toueh­downs and snt up another seom with an interception in the Wildcats' 27-2 vietory Sunday in the Cov11rnor's Cup.

"We were able to come out and execute everything we wanted to," Kentucky line­hacker Micah Johnson said. "I was expecting us to have a gmat p11rlimnancn and we did. I just wasn't e~pecting all of those turnovers. 
Neither wnre the Cardinals. 

Louisville coach Steve Kragthorpe was hoping for a fresh start after a disappointing debut last season. Instead, the Cardinals appear to have plenty of work ahead if they want to dimb back toward the top of the Big East. 
Sunday, the Wildcats emphat­ically proved the Cardinals weren't even the best team in the state. 
"You've got to take good care of the football." Kragthorpe said. "Wn just didn't do a good 1mough job on offense. Our defense gave us opportunities but we didn't take advantage."

Smith, who fumbled away his first kickoff and watched his first punt sail over his head, returned the ensuing kickoff 93 yards untouched for the first score of his career. It was Colorado's first kickoff return for a TO since Jeremy Bloom's 88-yarder at Kansas State in 2003. 
Not to be outdone, Mosure answered with a 90-yard TO return in which he broke two taekles around his 20-yard line and sidestepped desperation dive by kicker Jameson Davis as he plunged into the end zone to pull the Rams to 21-14.

Georgia DT out for season 
Associated Press 
ATHENS, Ga. -Georgia defensive tackle Jeff Owens will have knee surgery and miss the rest of the season, making the senior the second starting line­man lost by the top-ranked Bulldogs in the past month. 
Owens tore the anterior cruci­ate ligament in his right knee in Saturday's 45-21 win over Georgia Southern. Coach Mark Richt said Sunday that Owens will have season-ending sur­gery. 
Georgia lost starting left tack­le Trinton Sturdivant from its o!Tensive line during preseason practice. · 
"At this rate we won't last very long," Hicht said. "We can't afTord mueh more there. I think we've got pretty good depth still at both spots if you're thinking about trying to finish out the season, but much more trouble there and we might really get thin." 
Georgia senior Corvey Irvin will join junior Geno Atkins as the starting defensive tackles 
Saturday  against  Central  
Michigan.  
Irvin had  a sack and shared  

the team lead with six tackles, ineluding two for losses, against Georgia Southern. Atkins had four stops. 
"Corvey actually played an outstanding ballgame," lUcht said. "lie played the most snaps of the interior linemen and had the most production. Geno did­n't play as many snaps but was probably as productive per play." 

Irvin has never started for Georgia, but he played in 12 games last season after trans­ferring from Georgia Military College. 
Defensive tackle Kade Weston, expected to be the team's top backup, missed the opener with a sprained knee and is not expected to play next Saturday against Central Michigan. 
Owens started every game last season. 
Hicht said Owens has bnen scheduled for reconstructive knee surgery on Sept. 9 and plans to return for his fifth year of eligibility in 2009. He played in all 13 games as a freshman and can have a medical redshirt year this season. 
Hicht said he has no doubt Owens, who already had been projected as a possible high pick in the 2009 NFL draft, will return next season. 
"Oh yeah, I don't think there would be any question about that," lUcht said. "He knows it could be a blessing in the long run if he rehabs well and gets maybe even in better condition than he was this year. So he's looking at the bright side right now." 
Georgia will depend on sopho­mores Brandon Wood and Hicardo Crawford and freshman DeAngelo Tyson for depth behind Irvin and Atkins. 

Georgia's offensive line will receive a boost in depth with . this week's return of starter Clint Boling, who was suspend­ed by Hicht for the opener. 
After losing Sturdivant, Georgia had four new starters on its offensive line in the open­er, including frnshman guard Cordy Glenn. 
Hicht said Boling would move to the right side of the line and Josh Davis, who started at right tackle, will move back to left tackle, where he will compete with Kiante Tripp for a starting job. 
"OITonsively it will be good to have Clint back in tho lineup," Hicht said. "That will help." 
Boling made 11 starts as a freshman last season, 10 at right guard and one at right tackle. 
Hicht said Boling, Glenn and Ben llarden will compete for tho two starting jobs at right guard and right tackle. 
The offnnsive line is still inex­perienced. but the return of Boling gives the unit more depth than Georgia has at defensive tackle. 
"We're hoping to go into this ballgame with eight or nine guys who could play," Hicht said of the o!Tensivn line. "That's not bad."

Saint Mary's drops first 2 gallles 
Lack ofoffense contributes to pair of losses to Hiram, Case Western 
By ALEX BARKER Spons Writer 
Poor second-half perform­ances and an inability to score goals doomed Saint Mary's as it dropped both matches at the season-opening Case Western Reserve tournament this week­end in Cleveland, Ohio. 
The Belles struggled to find their offense against host Case Western falling 4-1 on Saturday. Sunday's match against !Iiram proved to be more of the same as the Belles once again failed to find their offensive rhythm in a 3-1 defeat. 
Against Case Western, Saint Mary's fell behind early but tied it up shortly after when senior forward Lauren Hinton connected with junior forward Micki Hedinger in the 15th minute for the Belles' first goal of the season. This success was short-lived, however, as Case Western would dominate the rest of the game putting two more goals in before half­time and_ adding a fourth shortly into the second half. 
Senior Nicole Beier started at goalkeeper for the Belles, recording four saves, but was replaced at half-time by Junior Patty Duffy who finished with six saves. 
In their second game, the Belles got out to a better start getting an early goal from freshman midfielder Taylor 
Please recycle 
Paton to take a 1-0 lead. Once again, however, the Belles could not maintain their momentum and Hiram scored an equalizer in the 30th minute. 
In the second half, the Belles could not fmd the net and gave up two late goals in the final seven minutes that sealed their fate. 
Duffy played all 90 minutes in goal for the Belles and recorded 10 saves. 
Saint Mary's will look to get their first victory of the season as they take on Manchester College this Wednesday at North Manchester, Ind.

Mets bullpen holds on to four-ru1tlead 
Associated Press · 
MIAMI -A four-run cushion was sufficient Sunday for the New York Mets. Now they'll try to hang onto a lead in September. 
The Mets' battered bullpen came through with three shutout innings to close out a 6-2 victory over the Florida Marlins, pre­serving New York's one-game lead over Philadelphia in the NL East. 
Four weeks of the regular sea­son remain, starting with a three­game series beginning Monday at Milwaukee, and the Mets are mindful of their collapse last September. 
"It has been a motivating factor the entire year," manager Jerry Manuel said. 
Pedro Martinez pitched six innings for only his second victo­ry since July 7, and the Mets homered three times against the fading Marlins. New York won

two of three games in the series, leaving third-place Florida seven back. 
Last year New York went 5-12 down the stretch to squander a big lead in the East and miss the playoffs. 
"Until I see that last day when we've won the division, I'm not going to be relaxed," Martinez said. "Hopefully things can be dif­ferent. I don't think this team is giving you any hints of showing what happened last year. It's a different group." 
The problem last year wasn't Martinez, who went 3-1 in September, and Sunday's per­formance suggested he's ready for another stretch run. The first two batters to face him scored, but those were the only runs he allowed. 
Martinez (5-3) gave up seven hits but only one walk. 
"Nothing special, just a quality outing," he said. "I had to battle a lot. I was a little sluggish but managed to use my experience." 
Martinez won with a fastball that rarely exceeded the low 80s. 
"Pedro was Pedro," Manuel said. "He didn't have his greatest stuff, but he pitched magnificent­ly." 
Back-to-back home runs in the third inning by Nick Evans and David Wright put the Mets ahead to stay. Carlos Beltran added his 21st homer. 
Five relievers combined to close out the win. Aaron Heilman, who walked in the win­ning run Saturday, stranded two runners to end the seventh. Shortstop Jose Reyes made a div­ing catch of Jorge Cantu's liner with two on to end the game. 
Scott Olsen (6-9) gave up six runs in 6 1-3 innings and fell to 0-5 in eight starts since July 19 . 
The defeat meant that for only the second time in Marlins histo­ry, they went an entire month without back-to-hack victories. They were 11-17 in August. 
"I think we have a run in us where we'll win five, six, seven in a row," manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "I still believe that." 
Martinez earned his 214th career win despite a rough start. Hanley Ramirez reached on a single to begin the first inning, took second on a wild pitch and came home on a double by Luis Gonzalez. A groundout and sacri­fice fly by Mike Jacobs put the Marlins ahead 2-0. 
Martinez stranded two runners in the second and again in the third before settling down to retire the final eight batters he faced. 
Beltran homered leading off the second. Rookie Evans, relish­ing his first pennant race, hit his first career home run to make the score 2-all. 
"Being my first year in the major leagues, you couldn't ask for a more exciting team and sit­uation to be put in," he said. ''I'm enjoying every day of it." 
Two pitches later, Wright hit his 27th homer --the 27th allowed by Olsen. 
"Oly threw pretty well," Jacobs said. "Unfortunately we didn't score enough runs. That's been out story the last month or so ­not scoring runs." 
New York added three runs in the seventh on RBI singles by Reyes and pinch hitter Ryan Church, and a sacrifice fly by Beltran. 
Then it was on to Milwaukee, where September awaits.

HOROSCOPE 

CELEBRITIES BORN ON TIDS DAY: Alexa Vega, 20; Sarah Chalke, 32; Chandra Wilson, 39; Willy DeVille, 58 
Happy Birthday: Bring on the charm and you will win your way into whatever situation you desire. Partnerships of all kinds will flour.ish. You will be the one to put things back in order and make them work. Know your value and you will be respected and rewarded. Your numbers are 5. 20, 26, 32, 39 
ARIES (March 21-Apri119):You may find yourself all wrapped up in a situation that you cannot change. Try not to let your emotions run away with you, causing a small issue to become something unmanageable. Don't get angry or lash out. 
TAURUS (April 20-May 20): You can make some personal changes or at least alter your surroundings to get a differenl take on whatever situation you are facing. A sense of accomplishment should be yours for your hard work and stay­ing power. Celebrate. 
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): You hold all the cards, so don't give in to anyone younger or older trying to put one over on you. Believe in yourself. Love is mounting and a question of commitment or taking a relationship to the next level should become quite clear. 
CANCER (June 21-July 22): You'll be caught in the middle if you meddle in the affairs of others. Be a listener not a contributor. You'll be emotional but, if you can keep a lid on it and comfort rather than preach, you will win in the end. 
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): You can multitask to your heart's content and spin things in your favor. There may be a power struggle with someone who challenges you but, as long as you don't waffle, you will have no trouble defeating whatever or whoever comes your way. 
VIRGO (Aug. 23·Sept. 22): Keep a handle on what everyone is doing but don't interfere. Personal purchases will turn out to be a disappomtment and a costly ven­ture. Don't be pushed into spending on something you don't need. 
LffiRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): You, someone you are close to or both of you will be out of control. Take a timeout and spend the day relaxing at home where you won't be tempted by others to get involved in something you shouldn't. 
SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Tie up loose ends in preparation for what's to come. Change is heading your way. Venture to get in touch with people out of your jurisdiction or geographical area. You'll be surprised by the response. 
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): This is no time to Let up on what you are trying to accomplish. Give your all. If you don't stay ahead today, you will never get caught up. Someone will play emotional games with you. The Moon is in Virgo initiating detail and intelligence. Helping others in a coura­geous manner will bring positive results. 
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Look beyond what others are doing. If rou are tempted to get involved in someone else's project, do the math and see if its prof­itable. Do your own research and you'll realize you'll have more going for you by doing your own thing. 
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): You can push through a deal, purchase some­thing substantial or invest in yourself and your future. Money issues will arise but someone who owes you will pay back handsomely --or you will find, come into or be given a gift you didn't expect. 
PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Agree to meet halfway and you will accomplish more. Change is required within your partnerships in order for them to continue to work satisfactorily. Less can be more.

By MIKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 
This past weekend, the Saint Mary's golf team competed in its first competition of the year at the Ferris State Bulldog Invitational at the Katke Golf Course in Big Rapids, Mich. 
The Belles were one of 16 Division II and Ill teams entered in the tournament, finishing third amongst the Division Ill schools that com­peted in the invitational. The team f1nished with a combined score of 671 after two days of competition. 
Entering their first tiiUrna­ment of the year, the team had a number of questions to answer. Because of injury con-corns, the team was forced to start three freshmen that had yet to play at Katke. Despite their inexperience, coach Mark Hamilton was pleased with the outcome. 
"Considering that we played three freshmen in th1~ starting line-up that had never seen the course, I was pleased with the outcome," Hamilton said. "We still have some work to do, but we're on the right track. Our goal was of being the low D-Ill in the l'ield was not accomplished, but the two teams ahead of us played very well."

By GREG ARGO BAST 
Sports Writer 
Looking only at the scoreboard, it might seem that two different Notre Dame teams showed up this past weekend in the AdidaslllJ Credit Union Classic. 
No. 3 Notre Dame started the weekend losing 3-0 against No. 12 Akron before rebounding to defeat Duke 4-1 Sunday after­noon to leave the. team's record at 1-1-0. Irish coach Bobby Clark, however, !(~It that the final seore of both games didn't accurately tell the story. 
"We should have done better [against Akron!. but we wem in the game a lot more than the score suggested," Clark said. "Sunday was maybe a reversal because I >uke was in the game a lot morn than the score suggest­ed."
