A Notre Dame student fell out a fourth-floor restroom win­dow in Pangborn llall Friday night. 
Freshman Frederick Sharky was rushed to St. Joseph's Medical Center and a spokesperson for the hospital said Sunday that he was listed in serious condition and is in the intensive care unit. 
According to Rex Rakow, di­rector of Security, the incident occurred between 11:45 p.m. and midnight. The student fell from a window that was op1mnd 18 inches. he said. 
Hakow said the student fell out of the west or back side of Pangborn onto a loading dock. He said he was not sure what the circumstances of the fall were, "but it appears that the student was near vomiting." 
No blood alcohol test was taken, said Rakow. 
Sharky was placed in a neck brace and a back board and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance, said Rakow. 
The student is a resident of Stanford Hall. 
"He's coming along fine," said Brother Viator Grzeskowiak, rector of Stanford Hall. 
Pangborn's rector, Father Wilfred Borden, declined to comment. 
Three new computer systems bought,by ND

News Staff 
Three new computPr systems were recently acquired by the University to support research as part of a four-year, multi­million dollar effort to upgrade and expand the computing fa­cilities on campus, according to Donald Spicer. assistant provost for university comput­ing. 
The systems, a CONVEX C220 and two smaller CONVEX Cl20s. give the University community processing capa­bilities that were previously available only off-campus, Spicer said: "Essentially, their primary capability is to support 
comp~.tationally-intensive 
tasks. 
The addition of the CONVEX systems has improved large­scale computing on the campus, said Spicer. The CONVEX sys-terns are computer networks, and users may log on through modems. 
"The CONVEX system is a class of computing power that did not exist on campus previ­ously. Off-campus ties will stay in place, but not everything will have to be done remotely. It's intended that these two (the off-campus and on-campus computing systems) will com­plement each other," he ex­plained. 
Users of the new system will include faculty, graduate stu­dents, and undergraduates af­filiated with research projects, said Spicer. "People who need this resource will be those in the fields of science, engineer­ing, business, and economics." 
In addition to the new sys­tems, a new computer store and repair shop have recently

Jogger returns who asks to be punched 
By KELLEY TUTHILL 
Assistant News Editor 
A man in a navy running suit approached three differ­
ent  groups  of  females  
Sunday.  
According  to  Joseph  

Araman, captain of Security's afternoon shift, the first incident occurred at 
5:32 p.m. when two females were approached near Gate six in the JACC parking lot. 
Araman said the man asked the students what time it was and proceeded to tell them that he was jogging, had cramps and needed to be punched in the stomach. 
The women declined to help him and went to Cartier Field and told a representa­tive from non-varsity athlet­ics who called Security on a radio, said Araman. 
The second incident oc­curred at 7 p.m., when a fe­male student was jogging eastbound on Bulla Road near the O'Hara-Grace Townhouses. She said a man came jogging from behind her and asked her for the time. As before, the man told the student he was having trouble and needed help, said Araman. 
The student ran away and notified Security, he said. 
Araman said the third in­cident occurred at 7:26 p.m. on the sidewalk between Decio Faculty Hall and the Snite Museum of Art. The man approached two female students, asked for the time and to be punched in the stomach. 
The women fled and noti­fied Security, he said. "No one was touched," said Araman. 
The man is described as a male Caucasian, Italian-look­ing, with dark skin, bushy dark curly hair, brown eyes, five feet, nine inches tall, 160 pounds and probably be­tween 25-30 years old, Araman said. 
He said the man was wear­ing a navy blue, nylon jog­ging suit with a partially or fully zipped and hooded top. The top may have two white horizontal stripes. 
He was wearing a navy blue baseball hat with a red "P" stitched on it, said Araman. One woman said that he had a strong or prominent nose. 
The women also described him as having no facial hair (moustache or beard), no glasses and no heavy accent. 
"I suspect that this is the same person we've been deal­ing with all along," said Araman. "The patterns are the same, the conversation is

Victims of Hugo try to get bare necessities 
Associated Press 

CHARLESTON, S.C. -Victims of Hurricane Hugo scrambled to meet life's basic needs Sunday, sweating out shortages of food, fresh water, cash and electricity. Lines for hot meals were blocks long and people waited up to four hours to buy gas and other supplies. 
"There's no bread, there's no meat," said Harold Washington, 21, at a super­market that had doughnuts and peanut butter but lacked sta­ples. "You can't survive like that. Things just aren't working fast enough." 
Washington, who lives with his mother and four siblings, said the family was burning candles at night and washing clothes by hand. They worried that the water they were using to brush their teeth was con­taminated. 
National Guardsmen with M­16 rifles patrolled the streets of the battered city of 65,000 peo­ple, guarding against looters and keeping order at locations where residents Jugged coolers and plastic jugs to get fresh water. 
An emergency law enacted Saturday night sought to keep profiteers from charging $1 0 for a bag of ice and $600 for a chain saw. Tempers flared at one location where people sought ice to keep their food fresh. 
"People were ... begging for ice," said Staff Sgt. Bill Petty of the South Carolina National Guard. "There were fistfights in the line. They were down-on­

WORLD BRIEFS 
"The Satanic Verses" will be released in paperback and is likely to go on sale this winter, London's Observer newspaper re­portt~d Sunday. More than 1 million hardback copies of Salman Hushdie's novel have been sold since it was published a year ago this week. It is in its ninth month on bestseller lists in Britain. 
Chinese exiles on Sunday chose a student protest leader and a former government official to lead an international movement to end Communist rule in China. On the final day of a three-day inaugural meeting of the Federation of Democracy in China, dele­gates elected former government adviser Yan Jiaqi as chairman and student protest leader Wu'er Kaixi as vice-chairman. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze 
waded into the Snake Hiver in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, fishing for cutthroat trout on Sunday, but he'll have to tell his Kremlin bud­dies about the one that got away. "I have no fishing license, and I caught nothing," Shevardnadze joked as he and Secretary of State James Baker ended their early morning fishing expedition. ''I'm no pro," he laughed. 
Salvage crews resumed efforts Sunday to remove the wreckage of a USAir jet from the East River in New York so fed­eral investigators can examine the parts to see if mechanical problems contributed to the crash. Queens District Attorney John 
J. Santucci's office has entered the investigation to be "on the lookout for violations of local laws," said Santucci spokesman Hichard Piperno. A grand jury may be asked to investigate possi­ble criminal wrongdoing related to last week's crash. 
Tens of thousands in Sioux City, Iowa turned out to honor flight and ground crews who brought in a disabled jumbo jet to the Sioux Gateway Airport and the emergency workers who helped rescue passengers. "This is unbelievable," said Capt. Al Haynes, pilot of United Flight 232. "It's like a continuation of ev­erything they did on July 19." 
The path of a collision that killed 20 students in Alton, Texas was retraced Sunday by a soft-drink delivery truck and a school bus carrying federal investigators. The National Transportation Safety Board said the tests helped determine the speed the bus was traveling Thursday on the two-lane road in southern Texas, 15 miles from the Mexico border. "We feel rea­sonably comfortable that the speed of the bus was somewhere in the range of, give or take, 30 miles per hour," said NTSB member Lee Dickinson. 
Swallowing cocaine to avoid detection has become an increasingly common practice, according to U.S. Customs agents in Miami. Plainclothes inspectors roving the huge customs area at Miami International Airport are capturing an average of a half­dozen of what they called "internals" every week, said senior cus­toms inspector George Dickinson. The swallowers are taken to a hospital prison ward to pass the sealed pellets of cocaine, with the help of laxatives. 
Utah's public school teachers have voted to hold a statewide walkout Monday to demonstrate to legislators that pleas for more education funds cannot be ignored. Legislators fu­eled the revolt last week by passing a tax cut instead of diverting money from a $94 million state surplus to education.

Panty raids: A tradition whose time has passed 
Before I came to Notre Dame I thought panty 
raids were a pastime out of the fifties and six­
ties when my parents were in school. But no, 
panty raids are alive and well at Saint Mary's 
College. 
The photo on the front page of Thursday's 
Observer says it all. The freshman is proudly 
displaying the prize he got at Saint Mary's from 
the women hanging out the windows. 
I know, I know, tradition, tradition; frankly 
this is one tradition whose time has come and 
gone. We're not in the sixties anymore and 
women should not participate in panty raids let 
alone host them. 
I asked a Saint Mary's student to explain to 
me how a certain night comes to be Panty Raid 
night. She said that as far as she knew 
(everyone seems a little cloudy on the issue) the 
raid is always on the Wednesday before the first 
home football game. 
My point is that NO freshmen don't just go running to Saint Mary's on a whim. Saint Mary's women could just stay inside and the whole thing would never happen. It's not like the raid is straight from "Revenge of the Nerds" when the men break into the dorm to the sur­prise of the residents. No, here we have willing participants who drop their drawers from their windows, rather than have their drawers opened. 
I realize that there must be some Saint Mary's students who do not approve of this annual event and it must be frustrating to be associ­ated with the rest of the crowd. 
I often hear women from both Saint Mary's and Notre Dame complaining about strained relations. Well, I just don't think the annual panty raid helps. Hosting a panty raid only fur­thers the "pre-wed" stereotype. The ceremony is overtly sexual with the freshmen literally leaving the Saint Mary's campus with the goodies. 
It's not that this panty raid in particular is so bad; believe it or not, I do have a sense of hu­mor. It's rather what this event symbolizes: it literally personifies the stereotypical sentiments that Notre Dame women wrongfully express towards the women at Saint Mary's. 
I asked a senior at Notre Dame if he went to the panty raid when he was a freshman. He said that the upperclassmen all told him to go, so he went. Well, many of the upperclass-women here are telling the fresh-women at Notre Dame that Saint Mary's girls are at school just to marry a Notre Dame man. 
I try to stop the spreading of this stereotype, but the panty raid doesn't help. Neither cloPs n front page photo of a freshman holding a pair of Saint Mary's student's underwear.

'Hosting a panty 
raid only furthers the "pre-wed" stereotype." 
Kelley Tuthill Assistant News Editor 

the lead story is "Senate censures use of K-9 
police to stop panty-raids." The story states 
that the student senate made a collective 
complaint against the South Bend and St. 
Joseph County police about the K-9 dogs and 
tear gas bombs used against students in the 
panty raids. 
"The disturbance was 75 percent the fault of Saint Mary's," said then-Student Body President Jim Fish. "The girls hung out of windows half dressed screeching obscenities which were equal in force, if not worse than those shouted by the Notre Dame students." The story notes that J.D.'s were collected and turned over to the Dean of Students who could kick students off­campus as a punishment. 
A column on page two of the paper was writ­ten from the Saint Mary's student's point of view. "The girls were in a strange situation. On one hand we had hysterical house mothers and student government officials ordering us to lock windows, turn off lights, and stay away from the windows. On the other, some girls had been collecting underwear all year, expressly for the event. One girl, in hopes of 'creating some ac­tion' for herself, had purchased a pair of red lace panties, complete with her name and exten­sion number." 
"When one Zahm Hall freshman was asked why he wanted a bra, he replied, 'I love you and I want something to remember you by.' Another said that his dad had trophies so why shouldn't he.'' 
Well, if we're talking underwear collection as trophies then Saint Mary's students and Notre Dame females should remember one thing: we're all women. I don't think our underwear should be displayed as "trophies" in men's rooms or on the front page of The Observer. 
It does not take K-9 forces to stop the annual panty raid; it only take initiative from a few Saint Mary's women to simply close their win­dows and say "It's not going to happPn this year."

"The Toughest Job You'll t:ver Love" 

By JOHN CREEL 
News Staff 
The federal government is starting to become more aware of the needs of the American family in its policies after a long period of neglect, said Thomas Long, a 1973 graduate of Notre Dame. 
It was not until recently that the government took the family into consideration when creat­ing federal policy, said Long. The family suffered a decline during "The Great Society" as a result of a high divorce rate and increased teen pregnancy. This decline was not caused by the Federal Government, but it did not provide adequate assis­tance to its people when they were in need, said Long. 
Long stressed that several excellent programs were devel­oped during the sixties and sev­enties, but "The war on poverty was hardly a renaissance, it was more of a disast~>r." 
Two aspects of the Federal policy that greatly affect the condition of the American fam­ily are the tax code and educa­tion. Mr. Long remarked, "The present tax code is compromis­ing the economic life of the family." 
In order for the tax code to be better suited to the family three adjustments should be made, said Long. Taxes should be based on people's ability to pay, dependents should lessen a family's tax requirement, and the poor should not be taxed. The personal tax adjustment for families with children has also fallen behind the times be­cause the government has failed to adjust it to keep up with rising inflation, said Long. 
Education is also vital to the survival of the family, he said. Poor conditions and low test scores in some inner city schools have led an increasing number of school-aged youths to flee to the streets and drugs 
and to leave their families. A 
system of open enrollment in 
which students would choose 
the school they would attend 
has proved effective in areas 
such as Harlem. Legislation to 
improve the tax code and the 
education system are necessary 
and are receiving greater con­
sideration in Washington, said 
Long.

eral policy regarding the family, he said. He added that the best available option is the use of local governments to organize improvements because the Federal Government does not have the discretionary funds to finance these programs. The poor have become largely de­pendent on the Federal Government for survival. 
Long said, "It is necessary to recognize the dignity of the family. People must participate in programs and help them­selves." 
If people become involved in their communities they will have a sense of pride and the family will be strengthened, he said. 
Thanks to the initiative of communities who have begun programs such as open enroll­ment the government has be­come aware of the needs of the family, said Long: "The lan­guage of the family has become part of Washington's vocabu­lary." 
Long graduated frqm the program of liberal studies at Notre Dame and went on to re­ceive his Juris Doctoris from Boston College. After comple­
tion of his studies and a tour of duty in Vietnam as a gunnery officer, he began his career in politics. He is presently the counsel and health policy advi­sor for Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, a position he has held since 1982. 
The lecture, titled "The American Family and Federal Policy: Recipe for Disaster or Opportunity for Renaissance?" was held Friday afternoon in Hayes-Healy auditorium.

Baker proclaims talks with Soviet foreign minister highly successful 
Associated Press 
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. ­Secretary of State James Baker said Sunday that the success of his meeting with the Soviet foreign minister should silence congressional critics and dampen their appetite for unilateral arms cuts. 
Despite progress on talks to cut strategic, conventional and chemical weapons, Baker said the Soviet Union was still "a military threat." 
"I think it would quite naive for the United States to talk about unilateral reductions of its strategic arsenal," Baker said on the CBS-TV program "Face the Nation." 
The Bush administration, he said, remains committed to the Strategic Defense Initiative and deploying new classes of long-range bombers and mobile mis­siles.

University President Father Edward Malloy last fall an­nounced the computer expan­sion plan. Early steps in that plan have been the initiation of a faculty workstation program and the completion of three new student computing clusters -in the LaFortune Student Center, the Architecture build­ing and the new center in the llesburgh Library. 
"The message (of the four­year program) is that this is a very dynamic area of campus life," said Spicer. "The com­munity is going to see a sub­stantial improvement on a reg­ular basis over the next three to four years. The program provides for either more facili­ties or better usage of existing facilities in each area."

On September 6, The Observer reported that a man bearing the same description and acting in a similar manner approached three different groups of females on campus. 
"I would like to emphasize that people should call right away if they see this man and to try to see where he is going," said Araman. When students wait 10 or 15 minutes, the man can jog away, he said. 
"We would like to apprehend him," Araman said. He said Security is concerned about the situation and would like to take care of it.

Without electricity for a third 
day, residents were unable to 
cook, boil water for drinking or 
get cash from bank machines. 
At stores that managed to re­
open Saturday, people waited in 
lines for up to four hours. 
The Red Cross dished out hot 
meals from lunch wagons. At 
the Citadel Square Baptist 
Church, the line stretched for three blocks, spokesman Brian Ruberry said. 
Wilma McDonald patched holes in her roof damaged by by fallen pine trees, although water continued to drip. She was buoyed when Allstate in­surance adjuster Kent Robinson gave her a $500 check to get the trees removed. 
"You don't know how glad I am to see somebody," McDonald said. "I was at my wit's end." 
People rummaged through the chaos wrought by Hugo to find what they had lost and what they could still salvage. Mostly, neighbors did what they could to get by. 

Kenneth Watson, 34, of North Charleston, filled a bath­tub with water before Hugo hit, but he and 11 relatives have no power. On Sunday, he bought groceries at a Piggly Wiggly supermarket even though money is short. 
"You can't get your checks and no banks are open. I just hope something comes by," Watson said. 
If no relief comes, Watson said, 'Til do it the old-time way and go down to the river and fish and crab." 
As a cold rain fell Sunday morning, church bells pealed above the hum of generators and the buzz of chain saws. 
"We have no roof and we've got three feet of water in the living room," said Jimmy Bailey, a state lawmaker who attended services. "But we all have what we were born with and that's good health.

Christianity clearly labels homosexuality a sin 
By Rick Acker 
Are anti-homosexuality laws fair? Is homosexuality a legiti­mate "alternative lifestyle?" As the controversy surrounding homosexuality has grown, the willingness to give straight an­swers to questions like these has dwindled. In this essay I will attempt to openly address the issue of homosexuality from the standard of a believer in democracy and Christianity. 
As a believer in democracy, the issue of homosexuality is political: Do homosexuals have rights to sexual freedom in the same way that religious minori­ties have rights to religious freedom? The Supreme Court answered this question in its 1986 decision in Bowers vs. Hardwick. In this case, the Court allowed a Texas anti­sodomy law to stand, and effec­tively denied a Constitutional basis for gay rights. 
Hegardless of the technical merits of Bowers vs. Hardwick (It is an impressive example of legal reasoning), I believe that it is in conflict with a central principle of American democ­racy. The Declaration of Inde­pendence, for instance, states that we all have the right to freely engage in "the Pursuit of Happiness." It is difficult to think of anything more aptly described as "the Pursuit of Happiness" than the private ex­ercise of one's sexual prefer­ences. Indeed, one of the fun­damental teachings of democ­racy is that individuals should have as much freedom as pos­sible, so long as they don't in­trude on the freedoms of others. Since homosexuals clearly do not infringe on any­body's rights by privately en­gaging in homosexual acts with 
DOONESBURY 
consenting adults, those of us 
who believe in democracy 
should press for legislation 
barring discrimination against 
homosexuals. 
As a believer in Christianity, 
however, the issue of homosex­
uality is ethical: Is homosexual­
ity morally acceptable? In light 
of explicit biblical teachings on 
this subject, Christians have no 
choice but to condemn homo­
sexual behavior as sin. 
Leviticus 20:13, for instance, says, "If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them." Likewise, St. Paul describes homosexuality as "degrading," "indecent," and "unnatural" in Homans 1:26­
27. While few today would ad­vocate the death penalty for homosexuals, Christians cannot deny the clear message of both the Old and New Testaments on the immorality of homosexual­ity. 
Some Christians have at­tempted to evade the strict bib­lical condemnation of homo­sexuality by arguing that the laws against it are mere anachronisms. They think that these rules may have had some function at the time of Moses, but are irrelevant today. They reach this conclusions more by analogy than logic. They point to outdated laws like the one in Leviticus 19:27 which requires men not to cut their beards or sideburns, or I Timothy 2:9 which prohibits women from wearing jewelery or braiding their hair. When pressed, how­ever, they can find no legitimate distinction between the rules they want to throw out and the ones they want to keep (banning child molestation, murder, etc.). Many people ad­

Why was ND tempted by 'Last Temptation'? 
By Edward J. Murphy 
A department of the University is sponsoring a pub­lic showing of "The Last Temptation of Christ." Why? Why would the Department of Communication and Theatre do this? And why would the Snite Museum of Art cooperate in this nefarious enterprise? 
My wife and I were among those who picketed in protest when this movie was shown in Mishawaka last fall. Although I had read a great deal about the movie, including extensive ex­cerpts from the script and the book on which it is based, I had not seen the film. Because of the taunts of some patrons that I had no right to protest with­out having first seen the movie, I did see it. 
Actually, the movie was much worse, much more insidious than I had expected it to be. From beginning to end, it is a veritable tissue of falsehood and distortion. To be sure, there is a disclaimer at the be­
ginning that the events are 
fictitious and not based on the 
Gospels. But the movie is about 
a historical figure, Jesus Christ, 
not Joe Messiah. Does one have 
a "right" to lie about historical 
events, even if one admits to 
doing so? 

Let me illustrate: 
1. 
Do you believe that Jesus Christ was unsure of who He was? Do you believe He doubted His divinity? Do you believe He was a wimpy charac­ter whose message was tenta­tive and incoherent? (Movie:Jesus: ''I'm a liar, a hyp­ocrite, I'm afraid of everything. I don't ever t~ll the truth. I don't have the courage .... You want to know who my God is? FPar! You look inside me and that's all you'll find .... Lucifer is inside me.") 

2. 
Do you believe that Jesus, voyeur-like, watched Mary Magdalene have sex with a cus­tomer? Do you believe Jesus asked her to forgive Him?(Movie: Jesus: "I want you to forgive me. I've done many bad things.I'm going to the 


desert. I need you to forgive me before I go. Please."Mary Magdalene: "Oh, I see. You said I'll have a day with you. And thenyou come in here with your head down saying 'Forgive me. Forgive me.'It's not that easy. Just because you need forgive­ness, don't ask me to do it....You're not a man. You're the same as all the others, only you can't admit it. You're piti­ful. I hate you!"). 
3. 
Do you believe Jesus asked Judas to betray Him? (Movie: Jesus: "You promised me. Remember, you once told me that if I moved one step from revolution you'd kill me. Remember?" Judas: "Yes." Jesus: "I've strayed. haven't I? Then you must keep your promise, you have to kill me.") 

4. 
Do you believe Jesus made crosses which He sold to the Romans for use in crucifying Jews? (Movie: Judas: "You're a disgrace. Romans can't find anybody to make crosses, ex­cept for you. You do it. You're worse than them! You're a Jew killing Jews. You're a coward! How will you ever pay for your 


sins?" Jesus: "With my life, Judas. I don't have anything else.") 
This is but a sample of the lies about .TPsus in this bias­

phemous film. But it is not only about Jesus that vicious lies are told; His friends fare no better. For example, the apostle Paul is portrayed as a liar and a hypocri~e who invents the story of Jesus' resurrection to make people feel better. Virtually ev­eryone who is close to Jesus is smeared, including His mother. Our Lady is cast as a bitter and frustrated woman who neither understands nor accepts the mission of her son. 
So we return to the question: Why? Why is this movie being

Athlete leaves his mark on children 
Dear Editor: 
It is evident that many chil­dren look to those who succeed in athletics as role models. It is also apparent that there are many not worthy of such an honor. With the questionable acts of Pete Rose and the Cleve­land Brown's Kevin Mack last summer, it is not surprising that many children are becom­ing disillusioned with their pre­vious sports heroes. 
However, on Sept. 14, a cer­tain athlete appeared at a pep rally at St. Joseph grade school in downtown South Bend. The effect this gentleman had on

It shown on the Notre Dame campus? As an "academic exer­cise"? But this is not a private showing in a class where a teacher and students study and critique the film. Rather, the movie is being advertised in campus publications, and the public is being urged to attend. Tickets are to be sold, suggest­ing that the sponsors might even be hoping to turn a profit. (One cannot but recall that Judas received thirty pieces of silver for his betrayal.) 

Why would anyone want to help spread lies about Jesus? Are we to assume that nobody involved is aware of what this movie is all about? It is, of course, possible that many, if not all, of those responsible are "useful idiots," to use Lenin's term for those naive 1ypes who unwittingly do the insiders' work. 
"The Last Temptation of Christ" is an outrage, and those of us who acknowledge Jesus as Lord dare not remain silent.

Volleyball tourney grateful for help 
Dear Editor: 
We would like to thank all 

those who contributed to the 
success of the Lyons Volleyball 
Tournament on Sept. 9. With 
their help, we were able to raise 
$330. The money will be divided 
with $230 going to the Center 
for the Homeless in South Bend 
and the remainder to Santa 
Cruz, a refugee village in El 
Salvador. Sixty-four teams 
volleyed for the top spot which 
was finally claimed by the team 
consisting of Mike Miller, Pedro 
Nemalceff, Leo Casas, Nora 
Purtell, Megan Ringquist, Mark 
Gerardi and Christa Lopiccolo.

'Chicken Soup'­ABC's appetizer 


-
If the Christians thought tlw lions were tough, they should nwet Bea Fisher. Overprotective mother is an understatement for this woman whose accent immediately suggests her Jewish heritage. She's serving up matzo and a gn~at dPal of trouble in her 
"Chicken Soup." 
The newest special on ABC's Tuesday night menu is "Chicken Soup," whieh comes to a boil at 8:30 on Tuesday nights. Jackie Mason stars as Jackin ~isher. a Jewish pajama salesman. Well. he was a pajama salesman until he quit his job in the first Ppisode. Now he helps his next door neighbor Maddie Peerce (Lynn Hedgrave) at an inner-city community cen­ter. 
It's BPa Fisher (Hita Karin) who adds the flavor to the broth. Bea wants Jackie to lind a nice Jewish girl to date. In fact, she 4mmediately exprnsses her concern over Jackie's recent lae.k of a social life. "As mother to son, I think we can talk openly," she says. "Am you gay?" Of course he isn't. but if there's any doubt, it's Bea's fault. Who names her son Jackie? 
What viewms discover later (or probably predicted from the beginning) is that .Jackie is dating someone: Maddie, the girl next door. Maddie is a widow who is trying to raise her three children as devout Catholics. Since both Jackie and MaddiP know how Bca feels about rPligiously mixed n~lationships, they keep thnirs a secret. 
That's not to say Bea and Maddie don't like e;u~h other; tht~y just won't be ex­changing Christmas presents. Actually, Bea likes Maddie's company and baby­sits her children. Stw tells .lackiP, "If she were a Gentile, I'd tell you to date her." lie replies, "If I wnre a Gentile. I wouldn't have to listPn." Later he reflects upon his situation: "''ve heard of people chm1ting on tlwir wivns. Why am I the only guy in the world chnating on his mother?" 
One of the main themes of the show is the process of 
Jackie putting his life in order. In fact, it is from this thnme that one of the show's best flavors comes. Each episode begins and ends with Jackie thinking out loud on the roof of his apartment. During these monologues. Jackie expresses his opinions on anything and everything. He thinks doctors are evil people who are like criminals. "Why do you think they wear gloves? Germs? No, fingerprints." 

JOE BUCOLO 
To Be Continued... 
Finally, Jackie decides to turn his life around. He goes into his boss' office to quit; however, his boss fires him first. Jackie argues and manages to get rehired­only to turn around and quit. Then he tells Bea about his relationship to Maddie. ··we'rn going to be a couple." She replies, "Why couldn't you be gay like everyone else?" And they thought Pharaoh was bad. 
The (six-pointed) star of the show is obviously Mason. lie steals the show with his witty comments and monologues. Karin is also quite good, but obviously models her character after Sophia from "The Golden 
Girls." It's Hedgrave who needs work. Apparently a series isn't as easy as Weight Watchers commercials. Hedgrave seems unsure of herself and (gulp!) even uninterested. Viewers may bn disappointed in her portrayal of the show's leading lady. She's definitely in Mason's shadow. 
The first new show of the season may be one of the best. No doubt positioning "Chicken Soup" between "Hoseanne" and "thirtysomething" will ensure the show high ratings; however, the appealing nature of the program makes it able to stand on its own. This is a flavorful, fun show. No flies in this "Soup." 

'The Package' promises guts and gore for Hackman fans 
... the movie takes off, 
with twists and turns 
requiring the viewer's 
undivided attention. It has 
a well-crafted plot, in the 
style of recent films such as 
'The Presidio' and 'No 
Way Out.' 

Johnny Gallagher (Gene Hackman) examines evidence found near a corpse. 

JANICE ARCHER 
accent writer 
A complex thriller with politi­cal intrigue, "The Package" is an exciting movie and well­worth seeing for those who don't mind putting forth a little effort. 
"The Package," starring Gene Hackman and Joanna Cassidy, is action-packed. The action opens in East Berlin, where the President of the United States and the General Secretary of the Soviet Union arc hammer­ing out the last points of a rev­olutionary treaty. This treaty, which is to be signed at thr, United Nations only days be­fore Christmas. will forever eliminate the threat of nuclear war. All nuelear weapons are to be rendered useless. 
Since this event is garnering such media attention, the U. S. Army has troops patrolling the woods outside the building where negotiations are taking place. Johnny Gallagher (llackman) is the leader of this group. While on patrol. Gal­lagher and his team come across two backpackers and turn them over to the East Ber­lin police. 
Later on, high-ranking Soviet and American officials are senn discussing plans. The purposl' of these plans is not clear. What is apparent is that !IIW American refuses to be a part of the plot. Whilr, the diss1mting American is being driv1~n down a winding road, tlw backpack­ers re-enter the movie. They pull out a detonator and blow up the baek of the ear. In a ratlwr gory scenP, tlw back­packers proc11ed to kill the American and the oth1~rs in the car with sub-machine guns. Since this takes place in Gal­lagher's territory, he is blarn1~d. lie is promptly given a rww as­signment-to deliv1~r a package 

to the UnitPd States. This "package" is Walter Henke, a soldier being sent home for a court-marshal hearing. 
From this point, tlw movie takes ofT with twists and turns requiring the viewer's undivided attrmtion. It has a wPII-eral"tnd plot, in the style of rnomt lilrns such as "ThP Presidio" and "No Way Out," in which llaekman also starred. "Thn Package" can become quite confusing at times, but as with most movies of its kind, everything is ex­plained at the end. 
Gene llaekrnan turns in a wonderful performance as thP hardworking sergeant blamed for a disastor he has no part in. 
I lis rharartPr's shnPr dPtPrmi­nation to find out what is going on is tlw driving foreP lwhind tiH' advancement oftlw plot. llaekman is nxtnmdy likabiP in this roll', gaining viewer sympa­thy while keeping tlw audierH'P glued to tlw action. 
Joanna Cassidy, as l.t. Col. Eileen Gallaglwr, Gallaglwr's 1~x-wife. dons a firw job with a roiP that is relatively supportiw to I Iackman. After Gallaglwr !.ands in A.~·lington with his 
package, plans go awry and he calls her for help. As tlw ac­tion moves from Arlington to Chieago, whem the l'resich~nt and tlw Gennral S1~eretarv are also making a stop on th;~ir peace tour, Cassidy's eharaetN drops into the background while the aetion beeonws mom fast-pared. 
Small details in "The Pack­age" that appear ineonsequnn­tial at the time return only to be extremely important later, as in the ease with the bark­packers, so the effort to pay at­tention is wnll-rnwardnd. This is a v1~ry exciting movie with nail-biting senrws, so viewers cannot be studying their pop­corn or the eyes of their date while watching this movie.

ulation, the Irish offense kept consistent pressure on the Marquette defense but could not break the tie. 
In the first of the two 15 minute, non-sudden death over­time periods, Marquette shocked the Irish and their par­tisan crowd by scoring just three minutes into the period. Scott Steinbauer scored the goal, his second of the game, on a shot to the upper left corner from 20 yards out. 
The period ended with no other major threats from either team. The stage was now set for the game's exciting conclu­sion. With Marquette in an ob­

Danny Lyons sent a punt across midfield where it took one high bounce over two Marquette defenders. Forward Kevin Pendergast first got to the ball and tapped it to his left and into the possession of Junior Mark Crowe. Crowe took one dribble and slid the ball under Marquette's keeper Dave Wulff from about eight yards out. Only two and a half min­utes remained. It was Crowe's first goal of the season, and a timely one at that. 
Not content with just a tie, the Irish continued to attack the Marquette zone, but to no avail. A long, hard-fought game 
in a 2-2 tie.

working. 
"You need a strong defense to 

be a good team and to give the 
offense momentum and I know 
I'm not strong against the run, 
so I've got to work on that." 
Few Spartans will agree with 

McDonald's criticism of his 
play against the run. 
McDonald did his part trying 

to make life miserable for 
Spartan tailback Hyland 
Hickson and quarterback Enos. 
On MSU's first possession of 

the second quarter, he clocked 
Hickson as he tried to sweep 
left, allowing him a meager 
one-yard gain. 
lie was just getting warmed up. 
The Irish defense took the 

field with 1:56 left in the first 
half, after MSU free safety 
Mike laquaniello picked off a 
Tony Hice pass and returned it 
16 yards to Notre Dame's 49­
yard line, with the chore of pre­
venting the Spartans from tak­
ing the game's momentum into 
the lockcrroom. 
McDonald pounced on his chance to stifle MSU's last­minute surge on the first Spartan play of the drive, nail­ing Enos to the turf for a loss of six yards. 
lie wasn't finished yet, as he chased down a rolling Enos nine plays later and drove him into the ground for an eight­yard loss sufficiently halting a Spartan drive which had ad­vanced to Notre Dame's 13 yard-line before his sack. 
The sack stymied the Spartans' hopes for a touch­down, forcing them to retire at the half with a field goal.

guy to defend. I've never had to be on defense where we had such a skilled back at tlw quar­terback position. llis judge­ments were good. He ran the ball, and that's where he is dangerous. He threw the ball on occasion pretty well. lie was really the big difference." 
Perles was true to his word, as he said prior to the game that he would not kick to kick­off return specialist Haghib Ismail. 
"I wasn't worried about him," Perles said. "I could kick away from him. I can't do anything about the quarterback. lie's got the ball in his hand on every down. lie's a great one." 
Apparently Hice was not as impressed as Perles. 
"It will go down as a win," Hice said. "but in my book it was only so-so. We made too 
many mistakes and we have to 
learn from them in order to get better." Hice finished the day with 90 yards passing on 8-of-15 com­
pletions,  with  two  intercep­ 
tions.  lie  ran  for  a  net of 78  
yards  on  14 carries.  Watters  

led the Irish with 89 yards rushing on 16 carries. 
On the defensive side, Ned Bolcar and Chris Zorich had 10 and nine tackles, respectively. The Irish sacked Enos four times, two by Devon McDonald. The Spartan running game net­ted only 75 yards, as tailback BlaRe Ezor left with an articu­lar sternum in the first quarter. 
"I think our football players hung in there, and we beat a very good football team," Holtz said. 'Tm pleasnd with the way we played the run, particularly in the second half. Our football team did the things we had to do to win. 
"We played well on occasion, but we certainly didn't do it the entire game." 
"We have to play the 60­minute game," Zorich said. "We played strong for about thirty minutes, but that isn't going to be good enough against the teams we faee. Even with one minut11 left I was still shaking, because you never know what can happen."

Jim Kelly's fifth touchdown pass gave Buffalo a 47-41 over­time victory over Houston on Sunday in a game of big plays that saw Oilers kicker Tony Zendejas go from hero to vil­lain in less than 10 minutes. 
Kelly already had thrown touchdown passes of 6, 63, 78 and 26 yards before his 28­yarder to Andre Reed with 6:18 left in overtime ended this ex­hausting exercise in give-and­take. Reed also caught the 78­yarder. 
"The Buffalo Bills have ar­rived," Kelly said. "When you can score that many points when you have to, you've really done your job." 
Zendejas kicked a 52-yarder, his longest of the season, with three seconds to play, forcing the overtime. Houston won the toss and Warren Moon, sacked three times in the game, drove the Oilers to the Buffalo 25. 
49ers 38, Eagles 28 
Joe Montana, sacked eight times in the first 3 1/2 quarters, threw four touchdown passes in the final quarter as the 49ers 
Kelly passes Buffalo past Oilers 
the last eight minutes to beat Philadelphia. 
Montana completed 25 of 34 passes for 428 yards, including 237 in the second half, keeping San Francisco unbeaten. 
Broncos 31, Raiders 21 

John Elway threw two touch­down passes to Mark Jackson and scrambled 29 yards for another score, helping build a 28-0 halftime lead that Denver made stand up over the Raiders. 
The Broncos (3-0) converted three fumbles by Raiders quar­terback Jay Schroeder into touchdowns and also inter­cepted him three times. But the Broncos Jet the Raiders (1-2) back in contention with an in­terception and a fumble, both converted into touchdowns. 
Colts 13, Falcons 9 

Dean Biasucci kicked two field goals, and Jack Trudeau ran for one touchdown as a second-string backfield rallied the ailing Indianapolis Colts over Atlanta. 
With Atlanta leading 9-0 late in the third quarter and Indianapolis quarterback Chris Dickerson out with injuries, Trudeau and backup tailback Albert Bentley led the comeback as the Colts won their first game. 
Bears 47, Lions 27 
The Bears remained un­
beaten, Jed by a career-high 
302 passing yards to Mike 
Tomczak in their rout of win­
less Detroit. Tomczak, who had 
completed only 40 percent of 
his passes this season, com­
pleted 17 of 25 against the 
Lions. 
Tomczak is 19-3 as a starter 
for the Bears, 18-3 in regular­
season games. 
Bucs 20, Saints 10 
Vinny Testaverde passed for 227 yards, and Tampa Bay in­tercepted New Orleans' banged­up quarterbacks twice. Testaverde threw an 11-yard TO pass to Ron Hall in the sec­ond period, and Lars Tate scored on a 5-yard run that broke a 10-10 tie midway through the third quarter. 
Donald Igwebuike also kicked field goals of 34 and 37 yards for the Bucs (2-1). The Saints (1-2) hadn't lost to Tampa Bay since 1982 and Jed 7-0 after

Don Zimmer isn't counting on anything. 
"We have to keep winning and not worry about what the Cardinals do," the Cubs man­ager said. "This thing isn't over yet. You have to realize how fast things can change in this game. We could have lost all three to the Pirates. Then where would we be?" 
Dwight Smith drove in two runs and Ryne Sandberg had two hits as the Cubs beat Pittsburgh 4-2 Sunday for their fourth straight victory. Chicago leads St. Louis by four games with six remaining and its magic number is three for its second division title in six sea­sons. 
Steve Wilson, 6-4, won his third decision against Pittsburgh this year, allowing three hits in five innings. Jeff Pico got two outs for his first save this season and the second of his career. 
''I'm just happy I could con­tribute," said Pico, who is not on the playoff roster because he was sent down to Iowa and brought back after Sept. 1. 
Cardinals 2, Phillies 1 

ST. LOUIS Chuck McElroy's bases-loaded walk to Tony Pena forced in the go­ahead run in the eighth inning. St. Louis remained four games behind Chicago.

Notre Dame escapes with victory over MSU 
Irish remain unbeaten despite four turno.vers 
By THERESA KELLY 
Sports Editor 
The top-ranked Notre Dame football team won Saturday's gamn against Michigan State. 
Tlw unfamiliar, mistake­prone. pressured Irish made thn game close, as it took a fourth-quarwr drive to settle the contest at 21-13. 
"I think our guys will grow from this week," Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz said. "They faced adversity when things werpn't going well. 
"We played badly and kind of got frustrawd and tried to do things that aren't built into the system. There were a lot of mistakes made during the course of the football game. We have an awful lot for work to do, we're just going to have to go forward." 
Wait a minutn, who won this game? 
Give some credit to the Spar­tans, though. Playing without tlwir leading ground-gainer. they turned to a passing attack to put a scare into the Notre Dame team that was an 18­point favorite. 
The Irish started strong, bar­relling in on the Spartan de­fense with a six-minute, 72­yard scoring drive on their first possession. At third and one on the Michigan State two, Rice took a hit but pitched to lUcky Watters, who had nothing but open field to the end zone on the left side of the line. A Craig Ilentrich point after gave the Irish a 7-0 lead. 
The defenses dominated until another Irish drive midway through the second quarter, capped off by another Watters score on what was almost a broken play. 
On the Irish 47, Rice dropped the snap from center, but re­covered, then tripped as he pitched left to Watters. Watters got a key block from Mike Brennan, then reversed his field, took advantage of a block by Anthony Johnson and sprinted for a 73-yard touch­down run. The PAT gave the Irish a 14-0 lead with nine min­utes left in the half.

EVfm though the Notre Dame soccer team did not win both wePkend gamns, it put forth two solid efforts. In so doing, tlw Irish displayed great char­acter and composure in some testing circumstances. 
The Irish beat the hurricane­like weather Friday night, not to mention their intended op­ponnnt, the Michigan State Spartans, by a 4-1 score. On Sunday afternoon. Notre Dame tied Marquettn 2-2 with a goal in tlw waning minutes of the sm~ond and final overtime pe­riod. 
In Friday's game, the

 
Spartans won the coin toss and chose to have the wind behind their backs for the first half. Apparently they thought they could get an early lead and s~ou!.d be credit.ed ..~o Tony H1ce, Watters said. fhe de­fense tried to shut him down and when they did he was able to get me the ball. After that I got some blocks down field and was able to move the ball very well." 

The rest of the half was marked by inconsistent play on both sides, especially Notre Dame's, as two turnovers, a Rodney Culver fumble and Mike laquaniello's interception of a Hice pass, led to Spartan field goals by John Langeloh, the second as time ran out to make the halftime score 14-6. 
The Spartans carried the momentum into the second half, stopping the Irish on four plays and getting to first and goal on the seven before the Irish defense came through, stopping the offense on three plays before Todd Lyght inter­cepted a Dan Enos pass in the end zone to protect the Irish lead. 
Hice returned the favor, how­ever, three plays later as he made an ill-advised pass under pressure and had it intercepted by Carlos Jenkins. This time, the Irish defense couldn't hold, as Enos had all day to hit James Bradley for a 30-yard touchdown pass. The PAT got the Spartans to within one, 14­13. 
The teams traded possessions through the third quarter and into the fourth without scoring, until Hice engineered the best Irish drive yet, an all-run, 62­yard sequence that gave the Irish breathing room, 21-13. 
The Spartan defense was hard-hitting, but the Irish used big ground gains to get to the Michigan State one, from which Johnson hurdled over the mid­dle and scored on a second ef­fort. llentrich's PAT ended the scoring, as the Irish stalled the Spartans next drive and ran down the clock. 
Michigan State head coach George Perles credited Rice for the win that raised Notre Dame's season mark to 3-0 and saw the Spartans fall to 1-1. 
"The credit goes to Rice," Perles said. "lie's one heck of a

hang on for the victory. Only half of this equation evolved. 
At 9:17 of the first half, the Spartan's Carl Hopfinger scored on a rined shot from about twenty five yards out. The shot went in off of the far post to Irish goalkeeper Danny Lyons' right. The Spartans had their lead, but it would not even last the remainder of the first half. 
Despite the strong head wind, the Irish scored the next two goals. At 21:28, Sophomore Bobby Allong knocked in his own rebound during a wild goal mouth scramble. Dave Augustyn had entered the ball in play with a throw-in deep in the Spartan's zone . 
Then, at 35:20 of the first half, Freshman Jeff Rhodes volleyed a Kevin Pendergast corner kick into the near upper corner to give the Irish a 2-1 lead. That goal broke the Spartan's back. They could not hold on to a lead even with the wind in their favor. With their coin toss strategy foiled, the Spartans had little hope of 
winning in the second half. 
In that half, the Irish contin­ued their confident, aggressive play. Ten minutes into the half, sophomore Mitch Kern made it 3-1 on a pretty shot to the up­per corner from about 18 yards out. The goal was unassisted. At 77:29, Kevin Pendergast capped the scoring with a breakaway goal on a long pass from Bobby Allong. 
Beautiful weather draped Krause Stadium for Sunday's MCC match with Marquette. The Irish still had to overcome adversity in the form of a 2-1 Marquette lead gained in the first of the two 15 minute overtime periods.
