STUDENT SENATE 




Committees discuss ongoing projects for year 

By ERJN LaRUFFA 
Associate News Edi tor 
With most senators in costume for Halloween, the Student Senate dis­cussed several of its ongoing projects at its weekly meeting Wednesday night. 
The Senate's committee on resi­dence life wanted clocks added to classrooms in O'Shaughnessy Hall, according to committee co-chair Aldo Tesi, the senator from Stanford Hall. However, in a meeting with director of space management Joseph Schellinger, the committee learned that the University does not intend to put clocks in the building. 
"They've tried having clocks in O'Shaughnessy in the past, and peo­ple were stealing them," Tesi told the senate. 
However, Schellinger is considering added amenities such as pencil sharpeners and three-hole punchers to different locations around campus, according to Tesi. 
The Senate's University affairs com­mittee met with another administra­tor, counseling center director Patrick Utz, said Zahm senator Mark Roland. one of the committee's co-chairs. In that meeting, senators and Utz dis­cussed ways the Senate and the coun­seling center can work together to improve services. 
"He was more than receptive," Roland said of Utz. 
In other Senate news: 
The Senate will hold its a round­table discussion tonight in both dining halls beginning at 5:30, announced Alumni senator Matt LaFratta. The topic of discussion will be dining hall issues, LaFratta added.

plans benefit basketball game 
Special co The Observer 
University officials have announced that at the Nov. 28 Notre Dame-Army men's basketball game, a prostate cancer awarness group will use the event to bring attention to the disease. 
At 7:30 p.m. at the game in the Joyce Center, representatives of the Prostate Awareness and Cancer Education Program will teach more about this type of cancer. 
The event is organized by men's basketball team and coaches and the Management 231 class in the Mendoza College of Business. The class, a service learning course, is taught by faculty member Chuck Lennon. -At the event, representatives of Irishhealth, St. Joseph Regional Medical Center, Memorial Hospital, the Northern lndiana Cancer Research Consortium and local physicians will be available on the Joyce Center concourse before the game to answer questions and distribute information. 
Men more than 50 years old may qualify for a free clinical trial program, Project Select, being conducted nationally. The project is sponsored by the United States Cancer Institute. 
According to organizers the event has two key goals: 
. 
to encourage men over 50 to have a regular prostate specific antigen test at their annual physi­cal exam 

. 
to promote awareness of prostate cancer and to encourage more open discussion of the disease. 


The man_agernent class wm wear special shirts to promote the event on the Monday and Wednesday prior to the game. The Notre Dame and Army bas­ketball teams will wear special shirts during pre­game activities. 
On Oct. 19, sports analyst Dick Vitale appeared in the management class to shoot a prostate aware­ness commercial.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Irish fans are the best 
This week I was reminded about how much I 
love Notre Dame football and its fans. Sure, 
we're in the middle of a season with more 
downs than ups. but I'd rather be "Gold and 
Blue through and through" than any other kind 
of college football fan. 
My friends and I traveled Bob Woods up to Boston for the "Catholic Super Bowl" (or so it was called by the Business Boston College fans) to see 
Manager 
our Irish take on the Eagles of Boston College. We had been lucky enough to get tickets and thought that we could sit in the BC student section without any trouble, like many of our friends who visit do here at Notre Dame. However, the assumption we made was proven wrong during halftime. 
The BC students had been yelling. cheering and booing like any group of fans would do during a game, when a Notre Dame student in the section took off his jacket and exposed his ND sweatshirt that he was wearing under­neath. 
The group of students around him began taunting, which is expected, but then they began physically pushing him and throwing food at him. I saw half-eaten pizza, full bottles of water and even a full tray of nachos being thrown or dumped on this Irish fan, all the while the BC fans are yelling obscenities and threats at him as well. 
As I saw this unfold I was reminded of the 
Michigan State weekend earlier this year. I 
was at a "pre-game festivity" that was right 
next to a group of State fans. They had 
Spartan helmets, flags, and were cheering the 
"Go Green White" fight song of MSU the whole 
time; they were true State fans. 
As the game approached, everyone began packing up, and a few of my friends and I talked to the obvious leader of this group of Spartan fans. He was a nice guy, shook all our hands and thanked us for being the "best group of home fans every time MSU plays Notre Dame." Apparently, Purdue fans had thrown food at them, and other schools had tried to start a fight with them. 
We had cheered for our Irish just as loud as they cheered, and we respected their right to cheer on their own team. 
Incidents like these prove me to more and more that coming to Notre Dame was the best choice I could have made. Many schools taunt other schools and talk about what's wrong with the other team; we simply talk about our own team and cheer them on. 
My personal thought is that we at Notre Dame know that talking about what is wrong with others is the first sign of feeling inferior to them, and we are better than that. We respect other teams for what they are and have confi­dence in our team's ability and winning tradi­tion. 
So, no matter what the outcome of the rest of this season's games, cheer on our Irish and be proud of the fact that we go to the best football school in the nation. Go Irish!

NORTHWESTERN U. 

Law alumni stop donating 
EVANSTON, Ill. 
Five Northwestern University alumni told NU's office of annual giving on Tuesday they will stop donating to the university because of Law School professor Bernadine Dohrn's past involvement with a violent Vietnam-era protest group. 
The five alums followed in the footsteps of New York attorney Sean O'Shea, who demanded the return of his $1,000 contribution to the Law School after reading a July 16 New Yorker article about the Weatherman radical activist group. The article mentioned Dohrn, director of the Law School's Children and Family Justice Center. 
O'Shea said Dohrn and her husband, fellow Weatherman member Bill Ayers, were quoted in the story in an "unapologetic fashion" as they refused to repent their past actions. 
Dohrn and Ayers could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. 


U. PENNSYLVANIA 
Class meets in secrecy 
PHILADELPHIA 

After several weeks of secrecy surrounding the loca­tion and content of James M. Wilson's preceptorial on human gene therapy at University of Pennsylvania, the 15 students registered for the noncredit class were escorted Tuesday night from a meeting place in Williams Hall to a previously undisclosed location in the Wistar Institute on 36th Street. 
After consulting with Wilson. the preceptorial com­mittee has taken several steps over the past few weeks to prevent The Daily Pennsylvanian from obtaining information about the class. In addition to refusing the DP admission to the class -and even the Wistar build­ing -preceptorial board member Aaron Short requested students not speak to reporters afterward. 
Wilson, once a shining star in the breakthrough field of gene therapy, garnered national media attention and criticism following the 1999 death of Jesse Gelsinger, an 18-year-old patient who died in a study headed by Wilson.

Hargadon, Princeton's dean of admissions. "I mean, they get anxious and concerned about applying to college anyway." 
Other colleges still don't know yet how their mail will be affected. 
Some American University mail is processed by Washington, D.C.'s contami­nated Brentwood facility. The university has received some mail, even though the facility is closed. 
"We're unsure whether we're getting all our mail," university spokesman Todd Sedmak said. "We're definite­ly keeping an eye on it." 
Rutgers University will ask guidance counselors to fax transcripts and is encouraging online applications, spokes­woman Sandra Lanman said. 
Some schools and parents are concerned about SAT scores. Educational Testing Service, the company that administers the test, is head­quartered in Princeton. 
The College Board, the exam's New York-based owner, said in a statement that it has received nearly all score reports from October. It expects delays but no major problems. 
Some parents from The Peddie School had offered to collect and mail applications in nearby Pennsylvania, but the school settled on using package-delivery companies. 
"Then we don't have to worry about somebody else's mail system going down," col­lege counselor Ted de Villafranca said. "And we don't have to worry about our mail getting stuck somewhere locally."

"Had they sent it regular mail, we probably would have all panicked," said Matthews, 17, a senior at The Peddie School in Hight.,;;town. "It's the next four years of your life ­and whatever happens after 
that.'' . 

Princeton said it would accept applications even if they arrive weeks late as long as they're postmarked by Nov. 
1. Anyone who recently mailed an application has been asked to fax the first four pages to the admissions office. 
The stress of applying for college is even more acute in New Jersey, home to a region­al mail facility that handled at least three letters contaminat­ed with anthrax. It has been closed for testing and cleanup. 
The post office serving Princeton shut down late last week after tests detected an anthrax spore on a mail bin.

KABUL 
Four weeks into the U.S.­led air campaign, a senior Taliban official said Wednesday the ruling mili­tia is willing to negotiate an end to the conflict. But he demanded proof of Osama bin Laden's involvement in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. 
"That's the message for Americans," chief Taliban spokesman Amir Khan Muttaqi said. 
"We do not want to fight." Muttaqi told The Associated Press. "We will negotiate.. But talk to us like a sover­eign country. We are not a province of the United States, to be issued orders to. We have asked for proof of Osama's involvement, but they have refused. Why?" 

"All one has to do is watch television to find Osama bin Laden claiming responsibility for the Sept. 11 bombings. There is no question of responsibility. There is no question of the responsibility of the Taliban, and there's no question of what they should do," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. 
The United States has repeatedly said that the demand to surrender bin Laden and his lieutenants in the al-Qaida network is not negotiable, and waves of bombers have pounded the capital and other cities. 
During the interview, Muttaqi, who also is educa­tion minister, exuded confi­dence, arguing in effect that Afghanistan's weakness was its strength. U.S. bomb­ing, he maintained, will not crack the Taliban, which claims no senior figure in its movement was killed in the four-week campaign. 
If there were no negotia­tions, Muttaqi, along with other Taliban leaders, indi­cated that the war would turn into a conflict on the ground in which the Taliban would prevail -as the Afghans did against the Soviets in the 1979-1989 war. 

Kabul, the capital, lies largely in ruins, destroyed by an earlier civil war. The estimated 1 million people are mostly those too poor to flee. 
"America, what do vou want to do?" Muttaqi said. "Don't make Muslims everywhere angry. Muslims have no problem with Americans. It is American policy they disagree with. America should not oblige thousands and thousands of Muslims the world over to feel for the victims of the bombing because they will cause more trouble for America."

Blair takes peace effort to Saudis 
"They did not take any respon­sibility for any groups that use violence in order to achieve polit­ical objectives, and from that point of view, it was not a satis­factory meeting," Manley said Wednesday in Jerusalem. 
Blair said Britain was seeking a lasting cease-fu-e in the Israeli­Palestinian fighting to create a base of calm for serious peace negotiations. "Violence from whatever quarter is deeply unhelpful," he said. 
He flew to Jordan, later Wednesday for a meeting with King Abdullah, and was to con tinue onto Israel the next day. Israeli and Palestinian leaders have said they will meet with Blair on Thursday. 
"What I will be saying in Israel tomorrow is that we have to get .the process going again," he told Middle East Broadcasting in Riyadh. 
Be added: "We all want to see an end to the violence, the injus­tice and the poverty that is there." 
Wednesday appeared to be a difficult day for Blair, and his official spokesman evaded a question about whether anyone during the day had endorsed the U.S.-led military strikes in Afghanistan. 
The spokesman would say only that Blair heard strong condem­nation of the terrorist strikes and endorsement of the goal of elimi­nating terrorism. 
British officials said before arriving in Damascus that they had been encouraged by Assad's condemnation of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. They also sensed new possibilities with Assad, 35, who studied ophthalmology in London before being groomed to succeed his father, Hafez Assad, who died last year.

RIYADH 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair took his Middle Ea.st peace mission to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday after an overnight visit to Syria that highlighted deep differ­ences in the internation­al cam­p a i g n against ter­rorism. 
Syrian President Bashar Assad gave no indication that he was prepared to restrain violent Palestinian groups that operate from his territory. Syria, which remains on the State Department list of countries that sponsor terrorism, has long argued that Palestinians have the right to use force in opposing Israel's occupation. 
"Resisting occupation is an international right," Assad told a news conference with Blair fol­lowing their private talks at the hilltop presidential palace in Damascus. 
"An act of resistance is differ­ent from an act of terrorism," Assad said. 
Assad also criticized the mili­tary campaign in Afghanistan, where Britain so far is the only nation to join the United States in its bombing campaign. 
"We cannot accept what we see on the screen every day ­hundreds of innocent civilians dying," Assad said. 
Assad was apparently refer­ring to the extensive television footage of civilian casualties in Afghanistan aired every day by many of the Arab world's sta­tions. However, figures cited by these stations are nowhere near as high as the hundreds of daily casualties that the Syrian leader suggested. 
The Taliban claimed Wednesday that a total of 1,500 people had been killed so far in the air campaign. The Pentagon has accused the Taliban of inflat­ing civilian casualties, and says civilians are not intentionally tar­geted. 
Despite Assad's uncompromis­ing words, British officials pro­nounced themselves satisfied with the first official visit to Syria by a British prime minister. 
"Have we opened a bridge of dialogue? r think we have," said a senior British official who spoke to reporters during the t1ight to Saudi Arabia on condi­tion of anonymity. 
Canadian Foreign Minister John Manley said he also failed in a meeting Monday to convince Assad and other Syrian officials to rein in anti-Israel militants. 


Military action to go into winter 
A.sociated Press 

LONDON 
The U.S.-lcd campaign in Afghanistan will continue through winter into next spring, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said Wednesday, and the opposi­tion said the government was not doing enough to shore up public backing for the war. 
Prescott made his com­ments during a question and 
official spokesman, speaking on con.dition of anonymity, said: "It is not going to be done over three weeks." 
Prescott's comments came after Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon, in Washington for talks with his U.S. counterpart Donald Rumsfeld, admitted the imminent onset of winter in Afghanistan, could limit military options.

The head of the opposition Conservative party, Iain Duncan Smith. criticised Blair on Wednesday, saying the prime minister has failed to communicate clear aims for the campaign and appears "to be losing the bat­tle for the hearts and minds of the British people." 
Duncan Smith has support­ed the government's overall conduct of the war but said mixed messages from govern­ment and military officials have led to public confusion and unease. 
"Even those who have sup­ported military action from the outset are beginning to ask what our real objectives are and whether we are going about securing them in the right way," he wrote in an article for the Daily Telegraph newspaper. 
"Recently it has failed to get the message across that there has to be a clear con­nection between a defined set of war aims and the current military action," he said. 
Speaking to the British Broadcasting Corp., the oppo­sition leader emphasized he still strongly supports Blair.

Bush pushes economic plan 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

President Bush sought to break a Senate logjam Wednesday' by urging law­makers to pass an economic stimulus package of mainly tax cuts beforn Novem­ber's end. T h e Senate's t O p Democrat insisted t h c r e would be no deal without broad assistance for laid-off workers. 
Bush told a group of busi­ness leaders that Wednesday's report of a drop in the nation's gross domestic prod­uct was the latest sign of eco­nomic weakness made worse by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
"It's time for our govern­ment to act in a positive and constructive way," the presi­dent said. "The Congress needs to pass a stimulus pack­age and get it to my desk before the end of November." 
The plan should be mostly tax cuts because lawmakers already have approved $55 billion in spending since Sept. 11, Bush said. He repeated his four cornerstone proposals: acceleration of tax cuts set to take effect in the future; a new round of rebate checks for people left out of the first batch; repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax; and greater expensing write-offs for business investment. 
"I caution the Congress not to overspend," Bush said. "The temptation is to fund everybody's good idea. And my attitude is that our money ought to be focused and effec­tive." 

A leading Democratic plan contains some of Bush's tax elements but also includes expansion of unemployment benefits and a federal match for COBRA health insurance policies available to the job­1ess. Bush and House Republicans, who pushed through a $100 billion plan last week, favor grants to states that could be used to help laid-off workers. 
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters that tho GOP approach on unemployment would not pass the Democratic-led Senate. 
"We will fight with all that we've got to ensure that the unemployment compensation and health benefits are cov­ered in any economic plan that the Congress passes," Daschle said. 
At the same time, there was "general agreement" among Senate Democrats after a closed-door meeting Wednesday to attach up to $20 billion in spending for homeland security and infra­structure to the stimulus plan, said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus. 
Baucus, D-Mont., said he hoped to schedule a commit­tee vote next Tuesday on the stimulus package, with or without an agreement with Republicans. 
Baucus has outlined a $70 billion proposal that would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks, provide a 50 percent federal match for COBRA health insurance poli­cies and allow more workers to qualify for Medicaid ­along with $35 billion in tax cuts. 
Bush told congressional leaders he wants lawmakers to hold overall spending to limits of $686 billion that was agreed on several weeks ago, and stuck to that message in an afternoon meeting with House and Senate Republicans. 
"He made very, very clear that 686 was a number writ­ten in stone," said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. 
Participants agreed that the spending limits should be obeyed, including vetoing any legislation that surpassed those limits, said people famil­iar with the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Mitch Daniels, White House budget director, said, "Ideas beyond the deal we have are unnecessary, unwise and they will not happen." 
Daniels did not rule out con­sidering additional spending early next year. 
"We're in a war, so we can't rule out anything," Daniels said. 
Daschle, however, told reporters that those limits were reached when "there was no real appreciation for the extraordinary needs we face as a country." 
Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said the White House budget office was rejecting spending plans from agencies "that ought to be funded immediately if we're really interested in providing homeland security." 

Internet may help civic participation 
As.ociated Press 
NEW YORK 

The Internet may help reverse a decades-long decline in civic participation, particu­larly among younger adults, a survey from the Pew Internet & American Life Project sug­gests. 
The study released Wednesday did not attempt to determine whether such a reversal had taken place yet. 
"One of the big concerns that have existed since the mid­1960s is that young people were withdraw­ing from civic life," said Lee Rainie, the pro­ject's director. "It was just strik­ing to· see this technology that is enormously popular with young people is a Internet users. Sports fan groups followed at 31 percent. Entertainment fan groups were used by 29 percent of users, as were local communi­ty groups or associations. Other popular groups revolved around lifestyles or medical conditions.

Overall, 84 percent of Internet users in the United States have used the Internet to contact or get information from a group. 
Rainie acknowledged some of the groups "are pretty frivo­lous, built around rock stars or popular TV shows or sports teams." Still, he said, younger adults initially drawn by hobby or fan groups later migrate to other online com­munities. 
Professional and hobby groups were the most popular, each used by 50 percent of initial contact over the Internet, while 40 percent said they became more involved with groups they were previously

Half  of  the  

group participants said they got to know people they would not have met otherwise, including those of different genera­

tional, racial, ethnic or eco­nomic backgrounds. 
The survey was based on telephone interviews with 3,002 adults, including 1,697 Internet users, between Jan. 17 and Feb. 11. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
The study, whose release was delayed by the Sept. 11 terror attacks, did not exten­sively cover participation in groups since then. 
"Since Sept. 11, ... a lot of people have discovered the virtues of the Internet in ways they weren't aware of," Rainie said. "My guess is these num­bers would show up even

Education Secretary Rod Paige said the report offered evidence that efforts by communities, schools, law enforcement offi­cials and religious and other organizations can lead to drops in school violence. 
The annual report said the percentage of students 12 and older who said they were victims of thefts, assaults or threats at school dropped from 10 percent in 1995 to 8 percent in 1999. The largest drop came for stu­dents in seventh, eighth and ninth grades. 
Figures for 11th-graders were unchanged at 7 percent. 
The percentage of students who reported street gangs in their school fell by nearly half, from 29 percent in 1995 to 17 percent in 1999. Also, fewer stu­dents said they feared being attacked or hurt at school and fewer said they avoided places on campus because they consid­ered them unsafe.

"Because of the time differ­ences, sometimes those claims are reported for hours while we'reasleep in Washington. Much of the world has heard those claims before we respond," she said. 
"This also allows us to proac­tively do a better job of getting our message out to the world about what the war on terror­ism is all about," she said. 
Hughes has begun chairing a team of communications spe­cialists from the White House, thePentagon, the State Department, the National to get out the word to Muslims that many of their clerics denounce terrorism. 
The effort stems from a con­versation Bush had with Hughes shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks on Washington and New York. He asked her to think of ways the White House could counter anti-American sentiments in the Muslim world. 
As a result of that conversa­tion, Bush has urged American children to donate $1 to Afghanistanchildren and has urged children from both nations to become pen pals. He also has met with Muslim lead­ers.

Curt Lavarello, the group's executive director, said principals are often pressured to minimize crime statistics at their school. As a result, he said, they often refer to assaults simply as fights or thefts as missing prop­erty -even when $150,000 worth of equipment disappears. 
Lavarello also questioned the government report's assertion that 43 percent of schools reported no crimes to police in 1996-1997.

Karen Hughes, counselor to the president, said military offi­cials, diplomats and communi­cations specialists from the administration will be dis­patched to Pakistan and a White House aide will goto London to broaden the public relations campaign. They will respond to news developments andplot long-term communica­tions strategies that bolster the coalition's image. 
"This will allow us to respond more frequently to misinforma­tion put out by the Taliban there. For example, the false claims 'that they shot down a Cheney, are part of the strategy team, which will hold darly con­ference calls. Jim Wilkinson, a communications specialistand Navy reservist who works for Hughes, will run the new com­munications headquarters in anoffice building adjacent to the White House. 
One idea is to organize speeches in the region that highlight U.S. humanitarian efforts and makethe case -oft repeated by Bush -that the United States is fighting terror­ists, not the Muslimreligion. Hughes said she also would like

Aides say he hasn't felt com­pelled to respond to every development in what promises to be a long war with many casualties, including U.S. civil­ians. 
Bush is working on several events next week to put his anti-terrorism campaign into a broader context, including the military and homeland defense components, aides said. The events will serve as a runup to his two-day United Nations visit.

Saudis issue order freezing terrorist assets 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The Saudi government has issued an order to freeze assets of people and groups suspected of links to terrorism, cooperat· ing with the U.S. campaign to disrupt terrorist financing, Bush administration officials said Wednesday. 
President Bush has ordered the freezing of U.S. assets of 66 individuals and organizations suspected of conducting or financing terror. 
The U.S. government is in a delicate situation in its rel.ation­ship with Saudi Arabia. The longstanding ally sometimes seems reluctant to be a full part­ner in the U.S.-organized anti­terror coalition. 
Saudi Arabia is believed to be the home of at least half of the suicide hijackers and other sus­pects in the attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. 
Secretary ot' State Colin Powell said he was pleased with the Saudi order. "Everything we have asked them to do they have done," he said at the State Department. 
If the United States needs more from the Saudis it will ask, Powell said. 
The information about Saudi Arabia came as a 29-nation task force, which had met in a two­day emergency session in Washington, announced it had adopted measures to disrupt terrorists' financing. 
The measures include impos­ing anti-money-launderin·g requirements on nonbank fman­cial systems, such as the infor­mal "hawala" network of money brokers believed to be used by the al-Qaida network of Islamic militant Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The actions by the task force "could potentially save thou­sands of lives," said Jimmy Gurule, the Treasury undersec­retary for enforcement. 

He said they show "the kind of cooperation and international teamwork necessary to shut down those who perpetrate acts of terror against us and other law-abiding nations." 
The group docs not plan to discuss until June, however, possible penalties against coun­tries that fail to cooperate in the effort against terrorist financing. 
Saudi Arabia "has cooperat­ed" with the U.S. financial action against terrorism and has issued an order to block the assets, Gurule said. 
Asked whether the Saudi gov­ernment had actually blocked assets, Gurule replied, "I think what's most important is coop­eration." In some cases, it may be more desirable to keep bank accounts open and monitor them as part of an investigation, he said. 
Treasury officials say 152 cotmtries have pledged coopera­tion with the U.S. effort. Of those, 81 have issued asset blocking orders, including Saudi Arabia. 
The orders freeze the assets and prohibit citizens of those countries from doing business with the named individuals and organizations. 
An official said Wednesday that the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which Saudi Arabia is a member, had said in mid­October that its member nations were issuing blocking orders. 
The U.S. list of terrorist-linked individuals and organizations includes Yasin al-Qadi, who heads the Saudi-based Muwafaq ("Blessed Relief') Foundation, which U.S. officials describe as an al-Qaida front that transfers millions of dollars from wealthy Saudi businessmen to bin Laden, a Saudi exile.

Sept. 11: a Catholic perspective 
The attacks on Sept. 11 have raised a wide range of questions. One is "What difference does a Catholic per­spective make?" There are a number of differences as well, and it is worth indicating some of them. 
1. Less initial sur­prise. Absent specif­ic intelligence infor­mation, no world­view could have pre­dicted the attacks. However, a Catholic perspective might be more attentive to a number of the factors that con­tributed to the motivation to carry them out. 
Catholic social teaching stresses that all persons, groups and states are deeply "interdependent" in a "univer­sal common good." 
This contrasts with a view that emphasizes the autonomy and self­interest of nation-states. With this lat­ter view. as long as no one is overtly interfering with our self-interests, then there is little to worry about. 
War here is simply the absence of overt conflict. In the case of the United States, this view has been rein­forced by historical circumstance. 
We have had unrivaled power, an economic boom and have not had a war on our soil for some time. The 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa caused almost no psychologi­cal ripple in the American public or even among the key public officials 
A view that emphasizes interdepen­dence in a universal common good would have been concerned about a variety of factors that contribute to animosity and often lead to conflict. 
Pope John Paul II writes, "If the social question has acquired a world­wide dimension, this is because the demand for justice can only be satis-

Whitmore 
The Common Good 

fled on that level. To ignore this demand could encourage the tempta­tion among victims of injustice to respond with violence, as happens at the origins of so many wars. People excluded from the fair distribution of goods originally destined for all could ask themselves: why not respond with violence to those who treat us first with violence?" 
Economic disparity is far from a complete explanation of events, but it is an aspect to which a Catholic per­spective pays attention. If peace is not merely the absence of overt conflict, but rather a quality of interdepen­dence -a "right relationship" -with one's neighbor, then the rich-poor gap its role in contributing to violence is an ongoing concern wherever that gap is manifested. 
2. More restrained initial response. In a New York Times column Thomas Friedman wrote, "We have to fight the terrorists as if there were no rules." Friedman's view is that there is what Michael Walzer calls a "supreme emergency." 
There is a threat in Walzer's words, "to everything dear in our lives." We have a case of necessity, and "neces­sity knows no rules." Walzer used the concept of supreme emergency to jus­tify the carpet bombing in World War II and the deterrent threat of nuclear annihilation. 
The events of Sept. 11 and after fail to meet the criterion. Over 6,000 lives lost is severe, but most of us in most ways go on about our lives as before even if we take a few more precau­tions. 
More importantly the idea of supreme emergency is objectionable on religious grounds. The just war tradition and the limits it puts on the use of force is in part a statement that we are not God and are not without limits. 
The idea of supreme emergency is idolatrous. It makes a proximate good -our nation or way of life -into an ultimate good. The language of "cru­sade" and "Operation Infinite Justice"· early on the administration's response were evidence of just such an idola­trous view. 
3. Firmer grounds for condemning the attacks and responding. My own understanding of the just war tradi­tion is that it may not only permit the use of lethal force against the Taliban and the al Qaeda network, it may require it if all other means of conflict resolution prove not to be adequate. 
However, a Catholic approach would have firmer grounds for mak­ing the case because of its greater sensitivity to non-combatant immuni­ty. The Sept. 11 attacks were particu­larly abhorrent because noncombat­ants were targeted. 
The United States, however, has a history of targeting noncombatants directly (carpet bombing, Hiroshima and the structure of nuclear deter­rence) and of calling "indirect" killings those that are more appropri­ately understood as direct. Between 500,000 and a million Iraqis, most of them children, died of diseases and malnutrition directly attributable to the U.S. targeting of water supplies and infrastructure. 
Greater integrity in world conflicts will require greater sensitivity to the effects of war on noncombatants. This is particularly difficult to do in the kind of conflict in which the United States is presently engaged. 
The temptation is to loosen the just war restrictions. It is a temptation that must be resisted.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
One issue is sufficient 
Let me get this straight -because children are starving, usually because of wars and vicious regimes about which the average man, especially in another country, can do nothing, and non-0.J. murderers are executed, ostensibly for public safety, though I agree that argument is less and less valid by the day, then the rest of us have no right to proclaim the humanity -and the right not to be brutally destroyed -of unborn chil­dren? 
So because cruel foreign dictators and merciless judges have the power to ruin lives, pro-lifers should not have the right to protest infanticide? 
Moreover, unless you do something about other crimes, you have no right to speak about abor­tion? I suppose also that nobody has a right to study chemistry who does not also study astrolo­gy. Maybe supermen like John Litle can solve all problems at once, but for most of us one is enough. 
Should we blame Mother Teresa for helping the 
 poor, while she neglected the American war on drugs? What about Dr. King -he bravely helped secure the rights of his people, but was he not awful quiet about saving the whales? Do everything or do nothing seems to be the point Mr. Litle wants to communicate. Well, just for the record, pro-lifers as a whole do go out of their way to help poor you·ng mothers and the poor of all stripes, as well as praying to end the death penalty. 
Get to know some active pro-lifers, not those who merely say they are, Mr. Litle, and hopefully you will change your tune. They themselves wiIJ tell you they could never do enough, but you will see they are doing their best.

Rethink policy on sexual 
assault accusations 
Notre Dame, whlch until recently I have always been nothing but proud to be affiliated with, should rethink its policies on dealing with cases of sexual assault for the benefit ofall students, regardless ofgender. 
Due to an unfortunate situation of late regarding a fel­low member of the Notre Dame family, of wWch I have regrettably been made aware, I feel sickened by the lack ofjustice that our present system provides. 
It is terribly unfortunate how easily it can be over­looked that females are not always the only victims of sexual misconduct. It is even more disheartening to see that this misconception is consciously promoted here at Notre Dame. 
The truth is that males too can suffer from the inequities surrounding a case of sexual assault, especially in an environment where young men are looked upon as criminals forced to defend themselves from crushing alle­gations, no matter how absurd or unfounded they may be. 
Here at Notre Dame individuals are guilty uritil proven innocent ofsexual misconduct. Even in a case with absolutely no concrete evidence, the accused will imme­diately be found at fault. 
This means that any student, male or female, may accuse another student of sexual assault on the slightest impulse, for whatever reason, and this accused student could be found guilty regardless of the evidence or lack thereof. 
Sexual assault is undoubtedly one of the most dreadful crimes, and false accusations serve nothing but to deni­grate its significance. I cannot imagine what it must be like to be a woman who has been a victim of sexual assault. 
I fully agree with Notre Dame's placing strong empha­sis against sexual misconduct as they do. It is important to create and nurture an environment where a young woman can feel comfortable coming forward ,vith such awful charges. The problem lies, however, in the subse­quent trial process of the accused. 
One might be under the impression that a situation such as this would never occur, where an individual cre­ates false allegations in order to appear victimized. 
I mean what kind of vindictive, manipulative human being would be capable ofsuch a blatantly wrong act as accusing someone of such a farce? You'd be shocked. 
It is far too easy for someone to wake up the morning after a night of drunken debauchery and place the blame for their irresponsible actions on the individual with whom they just had seemingly consensual relations. 
The American society in which we live is one based on freedom, liberty and natural human rights. Notre Dame's "witch-hunt" tactics of placing the burden of proof on the accused are not merely completely unjust but un­American and un-Christian as well. 
Instead, a thorough investigation must be conducted by Notre Dame to fully understand the situation. including delving into the character of each party involved, and find out what exactly went on. 
The stakes are much too Wgh in cases such as these for uninformed decisions based on hearsay and conjecture. lt is much too easy for innocent students with bright promising futures to be victimized by dishonest individu­als who can't come to terms with their own promiscuity. 
Finally, cases such as these where sexual misconduct is pinned upon innocent young men serve to cheapen the words ofwomen who truly have been victimized by sexu­al assault. 
An individual who comes forward with charges of sexu­al assault is less likely to be believed if it is widely known that innocent people have often times been found guilty of similar charges. 
The present procedure ofhandling cases of sexual assault is a shameful blemish on Notre Dame's otherwise untarnished standard of excellence.

MOVIE REVIEW 

Jack the Ripper goes to 'Hell' 
By JUDE SEYMOUR 
Scene Movie Cricic 
"From Hell," the latest film to deal with the murders committed bv Jack the Ripper, is based on a detailed· comic book written by Alan Moore that reads as a revisionist history of the famous East End strangler. Moore saw himself as an artist rather than a historian, consequently tak­ing historical fact and blending it with fic­tions of the imagination to concoct a new identity for the killer. 
The directing team of Allen and Albert Hughes (The Hughes Brothers) follow Moore's cue, concentrating more on telling a good story than getting the facts right. 
"From Hell" tells the fictional account of the Ripper's pursuer, Inspector Abbcrline (Johnny Depp). Abberline is investigating the murders with the help of his psychic intuitions, which are coerced by a steady diet of Laudanum (a poison that contains strains of opium). 
Jack focuses his murderous spree on a group of prostitutes in the Whitechapel

Mary and Abberline team together in hopes of keeping her and the other prostitutes alive.

the Whitechapel district was the perfect setting for corruption. prostitution and murder. 
Jack the Hipper is one of the more fasci­nating characters of the 19th century. And part of that fascination stems from the fact that the Ripper's true identity is, to this day, unknown. Before modern scien­tific techniques made fingerprinting possi­ble. it was necessary to catch a murderer in the act. The Hipper worked quickly, removing organs and entrails in rapid-fire succession and with remarkable precision in the dark of night. These facts consumed the curiosities of Londoners, because Ripper was the first serial murderer in a new age of mass newspaper distribution and a literate general populace. 
The Hughes Brothers bring all these characterizations to their Ripper, respect­ing his social significance although at the same time betraying the facts of his real identity. 
The directors primarily focu~ on the which he operates. 
Suddenly, the Ripper's treachery causes the magnifying glass to swing over the British elite (especially those with a keen knowledge of anatomy), making the monarchy quite uncomfort­able. Jack the Ripper has succeeded in doing more than just committing murders: he has obligated the British upper class to drop their pretentious self-denying n·atures and examine their ranks for a possible murderer. 
The Hughes Brothers have pieced together a compelling horror flick with a couple new chapters to add to the Ripper legacy. Propelled by Johnny Depp's won­derful acting, intricate scenery and a dark brooding sensibility, "From Hell" is a much-appreciated addition to this Halloween season.

MOVIE REVIEW 
Comic 'World' of teenage angst 
By MATT NANIA 
Scene Movie Editor 
After suffering through an endless parade of sum­mer movies geared towards teenagers who like to have their "American Pie" spoon fed to them, along comes "Ghost World," an edgy, uncompromising, darkly comic film that defies tradition and convention. 
Based on the comic book by Daniel Clowes, "Ghost World" puts the modern disenfranchised teen under a microscope, and what we see is a world filled with uncertainty and doubt. 
Thora Birch, the former child actress who graduat­ed to adult roles with full honors in "American Beauty," delivers a heartfelt, complex performance as Enid, a recent high school graduate who thinks she has her life and future all laid out. 
When we first meet Enid, she and her best friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are suffering through an endless graduation speech delivered by a classmate in a wheelchair. The edgy tone of the film is instantly established when the girls complain that the valedicto­rian was much more fun before she got drunk and had an automobile accident, ending up in the wheelchair. 
dark interior dialogues and inability to con­nect with people on a real, emotional level drives away most of the people in her life. 
Enid wants independence, but still lives with her dad and her ex-stepmother, She wants acceptance, but is unwilling to embrace anyone or anything. She's pas­sionate, but lacks conviction. She can't hold down a job for more than a day because she's not a people person. Maybe it's because people don't get her. But she thinks she knows exactly who she is and what she wants. 
Birch is brilliant in her attempt at getting under the skin of her character. Enid is sort of an extension of the role she played in "American Beauty." As Kevin Spacey's distant daughter, Birch showed angst and confusion. As Enid, she explores an even darker side of teenage turmoil. 
Steve Buscemi is extremely likeable as Seymour, a man who understands and accepts his limitations. When Enid and Seymour realize that they're not destined 
to be a couple, Enid tries to 
set him up with other women. Seymour 
Enid and Rebecca plan to get jobs, "Ghost World" immediately sets down the ground move in together and start their adult

tional romance. 

"Ghost World" benefits from brave performances, both in front of and behind the camera. Illeana Douglas shines as the summer school art teacher, a former hippie who knows more about free expression than art (at one point she praises a brown-noser stu­dent's "found art," which is nothing more than a tam­pon sticking out of teacup). Brad Renfro ("Sleepers") is also good as the convenience store clerk the girls love to tease and admire, another lost soul just trying to make it through the day. 
MOVIE REVIEW 
Psychobabble with a side of Spacey 
The film is blessed to have director Terry Zwigoff at the helm, a man who isn't afraid to take chances. Zwigoff is one of those directors who never flinches, and there are times when "Ghost World" becomes so risky you appreciate having a director on board who can go the distance (Zwigoffs last film, the documen­tary "Crumb," was a warts-and-all look at comic artist Robert Crumb). 
"Ghost World" may not be your typical teen flick, but that's its calling card. The film doesn't wrap things up in a pretty little bow with a conventional feel good ending. It's challenging, and any film and film­maker that cares to lay down that challenge warrants respect and admiration. 
If your tastes lean more towards "Election" and "Rushmore" than anything starring Shannon Elizabeth, then "Ghost World" will satisfy you with its audacity and daring. Look for it in Chicago-area the­aters and on video in the future.

As always, Spacey is brilliant. His scenes bounce with vibrancy sorely lack­ing when he is not onscreen. He supplies 
the film with some light humor, toss­ing off clever one­liners to many of the buffoonish questions thrown his way.

Williams wants 
Ravens get ready to fly 
Associated Press 
OVVINGS MILLS, Md. The Super Bowl champs are ready to make their move. 
A year ago, the Baltimore Ravens entered November just one game over .500 and looking very little like a playoff team. Having virtually duplicated that start this season, they're seeking an identical finish. 
"Now is the time when the cream rises to the top," tight end Shannon Sharpe said Wednesday: "Every now and then you get a couple of teams that get off to great starts, but you know it's not for real and they fall by the wayside. Teams that arc for real find a way to sustain the growth they started in September and October." 
That's precisely what Baltimore did a year ago. After a three­game skid left the Ravens 5-4 on Oct. 29, they closed tho regular season with seven straight wins and breezed through tho playoffs. 
If the formula for success requires struggling through the first two months of the season, then Baltimore is right on course. 
The Ravens were in danger of falling under .500 before rallying to beat Jacksonville 18-17 Sunday. 
"It's a battle. We're battling, and that's exciting," Ravens coach Brian Billick said. "You show up every Sunday and go, 'Boy, let's have at it and see how this thing's going to go down."' 
It hasn't always been pretty. 
Tho Ravens were soundly defeat­ed in Cincinnati and Cleveland, and now concede that Pittsburgh, their opponent Sunday. is the team to beat in the AFC Central. 
That's OK, because the Ravens are just getting started. 
"The way we practice in train­ing camp, the way we lift, the way we practice during the course of the week, is built toward trying to be healthy and fresh in November and Dec­ember," Billick said.

"It takes it out of you. playing on the road so many times," defensive tackle Tony Siragusa said. "Guys are a little worn out from it. But maybe in the second half of the season, when we're home so much, maybe we'll be a lot more refreshed." 
The Ravens went 2-2 in October, which is a whole lot bet­ter than last season, when they went the entire month without a

13-2 in November a n d December since Billick took over before the 1999 season. 
"We're going to find out ifwe're built for this November and December," safety Rod Woodson said. "I don't care about the past.'" 
Billick does, and plans to let the players know as much. 
"We have a bit of a history in November and December, so I'm hoping to draw on that," he said. 
The schedule sets up well for a second-half surge. After the Ravens play the Steelers and travel to Tennessee for a Monday night game, five of their final seven games are at PS!Net 

"You've got to get 
better every 
game, and I think we are. We're just trying to follow what we did last year: improve every game, get the wins in the barn. then keep going." 
It should be easier this season, because the Ravens have history ­-and their reputation --to draw upon. 
"We've got to get the mindset back that we're the Baltimore Ravens, we have a great defense and we're winners," receiver Travis Taylor said. "We were at a down point, so we have to get back the attitude that we need." 
The Ravens may not get back their starting quarterback for Sunday's game. 
more play time 
Associated Press 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. 
Carolina Panthers defen­sive end Jay Williams lashed out at the team's coaching staff Wednesday, saying he wants to play every down or play somewhere else. 
Williams, who led the team in sacks last season with six. was benched last week against the New York Jets and replaced at left defen­sive end by Sean Gilbert. 

"When they told me about the change last week, I felt like I was smacked in the face and spit on," Williams said. "I felt like I wasn't given the opportunity to show what I can do." 
Williams started the first six games for the Panthers at left defensive end, but recorded just 16 tackles and one sack while playing most­ly on first and second downs. 
He said he agreed to play for Carolina after the 1999 season because the Panthers offered him an opportunity to be an every down player as left defensive end. 
Now he feels misled. 
"I mean. how can I not feel that way? When I got here, all I asked for was the opportunity to start," Williams said. "I didn't care if I came in as a backup at first, but as long as I got the opportunity to compete for a starting job, that's all I cared about." 
Defensive coordinator John Marshall said he has given Williams plenty of opportuni­ties to prove himself. 
"We had all last year and all through training camp and all last week to evaluate that, so how many more opportunities do you need?" Marshall said. "I think he had a lot of opportunities lo show the kind of production that we need." 
Marshall said he still believes that Williams can be a big contributor to the defense. but that he wanted to shake things up. 
"What matters is that nobody, including Jay, should think any less of him because we made a move that way," Marshall said. "He's a good producer. He is. But we just need more." 
Panthers head coach George Seifert said that while he's upset Williams vented his feelings to the media, he takes solace in the fact that Williams' heart is in the right place.

Does God Check Email?

¦ by Frank Santoni, Assistant Director, Special Projects 
~ 

I have a confession to make: I shirk time at work by writing personal notes to friends and family every morning before I do any of work-related activity. It's true; I can't deny it. Each day, when I get to work at

status bar pushes its way across the screeen as it finds each new email message that awaits me. I fidget, listening for the loud beep to signal "You have new mail" as dozens of new missives fill up my In-Box. I scan the list for familiar senders' names and click eagerly on each discovery. For the next half hour or so, I

systematically reply to each personal message, one by one. There you have it. It's off my chest and with the number of priests around campus I hope I might

have a good chance at absolution before the end of this column. It's old news that email has changed the way we communicate, the way we work, even the way we live.

When would I have ever, before the advent of this instant form of communication, arrived at work, or before going to sleep at night, pulled out some loose leaf stationery and written a letter the old fashioned

way to several of my friends at a time every single day? That just didn't happen. Email has made it easy to keep it in touch with loved ones.

A quick survey of my In-Box proves chat even my faith life has been altered.

All this email talk got me wondering. If email is so convenient and so pervasive, and if it's already improved the way I stay connected with the pr.:ople I love, then wouldn't it stand to reason that I should get

God into my address book? I mean, God must have an email account right? And if he does, how often does he reply to his messages? Knowing that kind of info would come in very handy since I have a lot of 
u, questions and several requests. Just think of the possibilities. Daily emails would surely speed up the process of getting answers from the Almighty. If I had a problem. in the morning I could shoot off an  urgent email to God and get an answer by lunch. 
 

First, I had to find God's email address. I knew from previous experience that God does not have a

website. A search at yahoo.com generated 200 responses, none of them too promising unless I wanted to email The Evil Chicken God ofThe Underworld or Fred God from West Islip, New York. I did send a 
message to the_one_true_god@hotmail.com, but I'm not holding my breath. 
I had to resort to a little experiment. So, I typed up a message, quick and to the point. 
God, 

Hi. Just a quick question or two: How often do you check your email? And with what frequency 
do you reply? I'm just looking for a ballpark guesstimate here. I know how busy you must be. 
Peace, Frank 

I fired it off to god@hotmail.com, god@earthlink.net, god@aol.com, and for good measure, god@nd.edu. I got immediate replies from eanhlink and aol, explaining in tech jargon that God did not have an account with either of the giant email providers. I can also report, with some fear that I may shatter a few long-held ideas, that God does not rely on Notre Dame -at least not for an internet connection, that is. So far, nothing from hotmail. 
Trying to reach God via email proved to be a frustrating endeavor. I was met with no answers and only more questions. I imagined an efficient back and forth between me and God. Come to think of it, that could easily describe all the other methods I use to try to reach God, too. My litany of questions and requests is often lengthy, but the time I give God to reply is always short. I list all the important people in my life, throw in any major life issues and conclude with a general request for abundant blessings. 
I am impatient and email has only reinforced my expectation for immediate answers and easy communications. After all, if I email a friend I can usually expect to hear back within 24 hours. And ifI don't, I get upset. Shouldn't I be able to count on the same from God? In the end, my typical prayers filled with needs and wants, like short emails between friends, are fine to keep "in touch" with God, but deepening a relationship requires setting aside quality time away from the busyness of life. I have found that reaching God and, especially, hearing back, demands of me a deeper kind of commitment, one that is far more deliberate and patient. 
Maybe, if God doesn't do email, I can find some others who do. Don't Mary and the saints have a direct line? I'll have to check when I get to work tomorrow.

NFL 
Bears defense puts points on board 
Assodated Press 
L'\KE FOREST, Ill. 

The Chicago Bears defense is finding the end zone with regu­larity. 
Three times in four games, the Bears have taken either a fum­ble or interception for a touch­down, none bigger than Mike Brown's 33-yard interception return in overtime last Sundav. 
Brown picked off a ball, that hit San Francisco's Terrell Owens in the shoulder pads, and scored to give Chicago a stun­ning 37-31 victory Sunday. 
Three weeks ago, Brian Urlacher returned a fumble 90 yards for a TD against the Falcons. The next week, R.W. McQuarters sco_oped up a loose ball on a friendly bounce and scooted 69 yards for a score against the Cardinals. 
"Hight now it's big for us," McQuarters said of the Bears' ability to score on defense. "Not only are we talking about it, we're actually going out and doing it." 
The Bears

"We empha­size it every time we get a turnover in practice. Every time a defensive player has the ball in his hands. you have that aggres­siveness and we're trying to score," Brown said. 
"We teach that in practice and you can tell in the games that when guys get the ball, they're trying to score." 
At the end of a drill that has them stutter-stepping through orange cones, defensive backs have to reach low and catch a shovel pass or pick up a ball on the ground that secondary coach Vance Bedford dumps at their feet, simulating a fumble recov­ery or an interception. 
But good bounces also help. 
"To win a championship you have to have some bounces, so if we have enough bounces, great. I'll take them all year," defensive coordinator Greg Blache said. 
The Bears returned four inter­ceptions for touchdowns last season and turning the other team's mistakes into points has always been an emphasis. Now it's been a big part of their quick start this season and a five-game winning streak. 
"We worked on that since we got here three years ago," Blache said. 
"Our speed has improved and there are a lot of factors involved. It's a matter of talent, a matter of emphasizing it and a matter of guys growing up into the defense." 
McQuarters had a touchdown return on an interception in last season's finale against Detroit. Then he won a starter's job in training camp and 
there to 
make the play by a couple of inches," McQuarters said. 
"It's about knowing where to fit and where to be, just taking the right alignment." 
Sure, there is luck involved, but there is also repetition in practice and a mentality now for the Bears that they can score on defense. 
"Turnovers and scoring on defense is one of the main things we .stress and harp on week in and week out," McQuarters said. 
"We've been able to do it in three of the last four games. It's actually happening."

If approved, the "5/8 rule" would be back in place in 2003­04 with one modification a one­scholarship credit when the combination of players gradu­ating and leaving early exceeds the amount of scholarships they could normally award. 
The athletes leaving early must be on track to graduate in five years. 
Olson's squad was one of the most affected in this, the first year of the rule. 
After reaching the national championship game in April, three Wildcats players left early for the NBA. 
Because of the rule, Olson could not fill those scholarships and will have 10 scholarship players this season instead of the 13 permitted under NCAA guidelines. 
Ohio State president William unintended consequences peo­ple have raised are how do you account for people who left the institution in good standing, whether they transfer or go to the pros," Kirwan said. "Some people have raised questions about whether there should be some accommodation in the rule when that occurs." 
Kirwan did not say whether he expected the proposal to be approved. 
In Olson's mind, though, the NCAA is moving in the right direction. 
"With a full complement of four we could go to 13," Olson said. "The thing that makes it difficult to plan ahead for is if we have someone going to the NBA late. By the time that's done recruiting is over." 
That isn't the only modifica­tion under consideration by the board of directors. 
The panel is also expected to 
eight games. 
The board of directors also is considering a proposal that would split the 20-day summer recruiting period into two 10­day periods, separated by a four-day break. 
Legislation that would pro­hibit certification of events scheduled to be played in facili­ties supported by sports wager­ing will also be on the table Thursday. 
In addition, the board will consider a proposal that would allow football teams playing a 12-game schedule to qualify for bowls with six wins. 
On Monday, the Football Study Oversight Committee rec­ommended that teams with 12­game schedules win seven games to qualify. 
NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said the board could only vote on the six-win requirement.

NBA 
Jordan falls prey to series 
. TV ratings for return much lower than baseball 
Associated Pre 
NEW YORK 

Michael Jordan had no chance against the World Series. 
About 13 million more U.S. TV homes 
tuned in to see the New York Yankees play the Arizona Diamond­backs than watched Jordan's first 


game with Jordan the Wash-ing­ton Wizards on Tuesday night. 
Fox's broadcast of the Yankees' 2-1 victory over the Diamondbacks in Game 3 of the World Series was watched by more than 16.2 million televi­sion households. About 3.3 mil­lion saw the Wizards' 93-91 loss to the New York Knicks on TBS. 
The baseball game produced a national rating of 15.4 with a 24 share, 24 percent higher than the rating for Game 3 between the Yankees and Mets last year. That helped the cur­rent Fall Classic move well ahead of the record-low pace in 2000. 
Through three games, the Yankees-Diamondbacks World Series was averaging 13.8/22,

The basketball game pro­duced a national cable rating of 
3.3 on TBS, which translates to about 2.9 million homes. TBS's coverage was blacked out in New York, where the game was shown on MSG Network and was watched by about 347,500 TV homes --about 2 1/2 times what MSG averaged for Knicks games last season. 
The World Series game was watched by about 2.1 million TV homes in New York, the country's largest market. 
The TBS rating still tripled what the network averaged for NBA regular season broadcasts in. 2000-01, and more than doubled what TBS drew for its season opener last year between the Knicks and 76ers. 
Jordan, who is making his second return from retirement, will go head-to-head with base­ball again Thursday.

He won't he hitting anyone for a while, certainly not in Sunday's game at Atlanta. 
He expects to play again this season but wouldn't estimate Wednesday when that would be. Meanwhile, Cox, who alternated with Ted Johnson and Tedy Bruschi at New England's inside linebacker spots, will help in the meeting room and on the sidelines. 
"I can try to help the coach­ing staff. I can try to put myself in the position that Ted and Tedy would be in and look at things," Cox said, "just give them another set of eyes as to what I would see if I were out there." 
He probably would be out there if he hadn't been hit by Neil in the third quarter of the Broncos 31-20 win. 
After the game. Cox said, "If I ever play football again and I play against that guy, he's going to have a blown-out knee." 
He felt the same the next

NFL 
Owners ratify agreement 
. NFL to extend labor agreement for three years 
Associated Pres 
PITTSBURGH 

NFL owners on Wednesday ratified a three-year extension of the labor agreement that will assure the league of labor peace through the 2007 season assuming that the players ratify it. 
The agreement was agreed to in principle in June by the NFL Management Council and the NFL Players Association and would be the fourth extension of the original agreement reached in 1993. The league's last labor­related interruption w.as the 1987 strike. 
Among the still-to-be-resolved issues before the agreement can be ratified by the players is how much of the NFL's increased security costs the union will pick up, and how the league and the players would divide any losses if games are can­celed by unforeseen events such as the terrorist attacks. 
The terrorist acts led the NFL to greatly increase security at all games, and commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the players are amenable to covering some of these unanticipated expens­es. 
"The whole league is focused on this," Tagliabue said Wednesday. "The players have said they want the fans to be safe, air travel to be safe, the stadiums to be safe." 
Earlier, Tagliabue said, "We think the cost of that should be split with the players associa­tion under the CBA in some way and not borne entirely by the owners." 
Tagliabue would not estimate how much the additional securi­ty is costing each team or the league, but suggested it would be substantial, especially during the postseason. 
The owners, meeting in Pittsburgh, also heard a detailed presentation Wednesday on security for the Super Bowl on Feb. 3 in New Orleans. 
"It will be the

1e ct iv e NFL commissioner despite a down­
bargaining agreement extension would push the salary cap through 2006 and would carry beyond the NFL's $17.6 billion television contract, which has four more years to run past this season. 
Under the proposed exten­sion, players could receive an increase in salary to as high as 
65.5 percent of designated gross revenues in 2005. 
Veteran players also would have a portion of their salaries paid out of a league-wide fund instead of counting against the salary cap. 

One of the criticisms of the current agreement was it gives too little security for higher­paid veterans to hold their jobs. 
Minimum salaries would increase to $225,000 for rookies and will go up Lo $300,000, $375,000 and $450,000 in sub­sequent seasons. A $525,000 minimum would apply through six seasons, with players in their seventh through ninth years guaranteed $650,000. 
For 10 years or more of ser­vice, the minimum would be $750,000. 
The owners also talked about 
the NFL's TV 
contracts, which

"We're not considering any givebacks to anybody.... We kind of looked ahead, knowing what the rights obligations of the networks are to us," Tag!iabue said. "But we didn't reach any conclusions and we're not going to react one way or another based on two months of experience." 
Despite the economic down­turn, Tagliabue said NFL mer­chandise sales are double what was projected before the sea­son. 
Mitchell looking for more catches 
Associated Press 

PHllADELPHIA 
Freddie Mitchell was sup­posed to give Donovan M.cNabb a much-needed threat at wide receiver. He's barely been on the field with him. 
Mitchell, selected with the 25th pick in April's draft, has just two catches in his first six games with · the Philadelphia Eagles. But coach Andy Reid may be ready to call the rookie's number more often. 
"We're to that stage now where we're easing him in, easing him in and easing him in, and with that, he's asked to learn the whole pack­age,"Heid said Wednesday. "He's getting close to that point where he should get in there and execute. He just hasn't been in there to do that, every route against every coverage and so on." 
Mitchell, a flashy receiver at UCIA, had 77 catches for 1,494 yards and nine touch­downs last season. He was the fifth receiver taken in the draft, and the highest select­ed by Philadelphia in 17 years. 
But Mitchell hasn't been able to beat out Na Brown for the No. 3 spot behind James Thrash and Todd Pinkston. While Thrash and Pinkston have emerged as capable starters, Brown has struggled 
lately, dropping passes in three consecutive games. That could open the door for Mitchell. 
"I like the role I'm in right now, "Mitchell said. "They are working me in slow. Now it's time to step it up a notch." 
MitchelJ's development was slowed by a hamstring injury that hampered him through­out training camp and the early part of the season. Ile said he's healthy now. 
"It wasn't that much of a hindrance,"Mitchell said. "The learning process didn't slow down. I was still learn­ing. It's just that I couldn't go out on the field. 
"Coach Reid has done a great job taking me slow, bringing me along little by lit­tle, helping me feel more comfortable. l can't wait to step up and take a bigger role." 
Mitchell realizes expecta­tions were high when he was drafted. But he isn't disap­pointed. 
"The No. 1 pick is drafted on potential,"Mitchell said. "A lot of people think the No. 1 pick is supposed to go in and play right away. That's not the case. You're drafted on potential and ability." 
The main concern for rook­ies is learning the intricacies of a complicated West Coast offense. 
Mitchell played in a varia­tion of it at UCIA.

WORLD SERIES 
Jeter hits 11th inning home run to tie series at 2 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK Tino Martinez made his 11rst hit of this World Series count. 
With New York down to its final out in Game 4, Martinez connected for a game-tying. two-run homer in the ninth inning off Arizona closer Byung-Hyun Kim to help the Yankees beat the Diamondbacks 4-3 in 10 innings Wednesday night. 
Martinez had been hitless in nine at-bats in the .Series against Arizona's tough pitch­ing and the Yankees had scored only four runs before his big shot helped turned the momentum and tied the Series at two games apiece. 
New York didn't win it until 
Derek Jeter's solo shot in the 
11th. Martinez was one of the 
first Yankees to pour out of 
the dugout to mob Jeter at 
home plate. 
But the celebration wouldn't have been possible without Martinez, who made sure his career in with the Yankees will last at least until a Game 6 in Arizona. 
Martinez is in the final year of his contract and his future in New York is in doubt. The Yankees have been grooming top prospect Nick Johnson to take over at first base and also might be interested in signing reigning AL MVP Jason Giambi. 
But Martinez is making their decision difficult, leading the team with 34 homers and 113 RBIs in the regular season. 
He has been a steady pres­ence in the lineup since replacing fan favorite Don Mattingly after the 1995 sea­son. 
Booed at first, Martinez quickly won over the fans and

A Belles player goes after the ball in a recent game. The Belles finished their season with a 3-0 loss to Alma on Tuesday. 
Volleyball 
continued from page 24 
Dineen took her last look at a collegiate volleyball court as a player on Tuesday, along with defensive specialist Denise Langolis and middle hitter Jolie LeBeau. Senior outside attacker Angie Meyers was unable to finish her senior season due to a knee injury. Although Tuesday's game wasn't a victory, Dineen was satisfied with the way the team played as a solid way to finish her senior year. 
"I think we really came together as a team against Alma and all the games were really close," she said. "We played really well, so it was a good way to finish the season on a high note." 
Although Alma held the lead during most of the match, the Belles did manage to keep things close until the end. 
"It was actually pretty much back and forth," Dineen said. "They would get ahead and we would battle back and get it close. It was pretty back and forth." 
It was ultimately the Alma defense that brought home the win for the Scots. Despite a varied Saint Mary's offensive attack, the Alma defense refused to allow the Belles to score points and preserved the win for the second-ranked team in the MIAA tournament. 
"Alma has really good defense," Dineen said. "They got a lot of our digs and tips. We tried to mix things up on offense and they always seemed to be right there." 
Junior Elizabeth Albert and freshman Alison Shevik led the Belles attack. Albert made 12 kills and 19 digs during the game while Shevik made nine kills and 25 digs. 
"Everyone really stepped up and really played their posi­tion to the fullest," Dineen said. 
Alma will continue in the playoffs and face off against Calvin on Friday in the semifi­nals.

Irish score Big East honors 
Special to the Observer 

Two members of the sixth­ranked Notre Dame women's soccer team have been recog­nized by the Big East Conference for their contribu­tions to last week's wins at Yale (2-0) and at home versus 23rd-ranked Michigan. Sophomore forward Amanda Guertin was named the Big East offensive player of the week while fifth-year defender Monica Gonzalez was recog­nized as the league's defen­sive player ofthe week. 
In other news, Notre Dame moved up from eighth to sixth in the National Soccer Coaches Association of America poll, edging past Nebraska, Penn State and St. Mary's (Calif.) while Portland vaulted from 10th to fourth. 
Jordan

the Irish for the Class of 2001 was listed on the front of sports section with his stats and awards listed next to his name. From Anthony Denman to Justin Smith, each player was lauded for his high school achievements. 
Everyone except Jordan. 

Next to his name it said "Jordan Auditorium, 'nuff said" -referring to the auditorium on campus his father helped fund. 
Throughout his career at Notre Dame, Jordan has been aware of the rumors, but no one has ever confronted him. 
"Nobody really ever had the guts to say things to my face but I've heard people talk," Jordan said. "I hear stuff like that all the time but nobody ever said anything to my face." 
All the rumors about Jordan receiving special privileges from the football team has been just talk, according to Davie. 
North Carolina remains first in the poll, followed by four teams from the West region: Stanford, Santa Clara, Portland and UCLA. 
Guertin extended her goalscoring streak to five games, after recording both Irish goals at Yale and scoring in overtime to beat Michigan. She has scored four of Notre Dame's last live goals, five of the last seven and six of the last 10-with her season totals including team bests in points (24), goals (9) and game-win­ning goals (4). 
Gonzalez earned her second Big East defensive honor in the last five weeks, after help­ing the Irish allow just one goal, 10 shots (only four on goal) and one corner kick dur­ing the week. The versatile veteran continues to excel at her new central defender 
"There's nothing political about me. Nothing," Davie said. "So everything he's done here, he's earned and everything he's gotten here, he deserves." 
If anything Davie said that Jordan's pedigree has made Davie work him harder -not easier. 
"He always said to me that I would have to work harder than everyone else," Jordan said. "If I did succeed it would be even more rewarding to me and he has been right about that." 
Entering the 2001 season, Jordan thought his best oppor­tunity to succeed would be as a backup center for the Irish. He was listed as second on the depth chart in spring practice but injuries led to a position change. 
While he was still the backup center, he also filled in at guard. 
"He did some good things for us in that backup center and he continues to be very consistent in practice with the situation we had at guard. He is good at pulling, especially in the option game," Davie said. 
position, where she has played since late September (after playing mostly outside back in the Irish defense dur­ing 2000 and the first month of 2001). 
Notre Dame players have combined for seven Big East weekly awards this season, with junior Vanessa Pruzinsky and senior Liz Wagner named the defensive player and goal­keeper of the week after the season-opening wins over Penn State and Hartford while senior midfielder Mia Sarkesian was the offensive player of the week after scor­ing gamcwinners versus Nebraska and West Virginia. Sophomore forward Amy Warner was named the league's offensive player of the week in mid-October, after totaling three goals in wins over St. John's and Miami. 
But after a spring full of promise, Jordan injured his kriee in summer practice. Torn medial collateral ligaments in his knee forced him to miss most of summer practice and the first three games of the sea­son. He did not return until the Pitt game. 
But in games against the quick defensive tackles of the Panthers, the Mountaineers, the Trojans and the Eagles, Jordan has been valuable. 
"I am better against the smaller, quicker guys," he said. "I try to focus on my technique. I think that gives me that advantage." 
Saturday against Tennessee's huge defensive tackles doesn't fit Jordan's style of play so he might not see the field. But regardless of what the future brings, Jordan will be known by Irish fans for much more than his father. 
"We trust him," Davie said. "He goes in there and he knows what to do." 
'Nuffsaid.

ND WOMEN'S SWIMMING 
Irish look to avenge bad pool, memories 
By NOREEN GILLESPIE 
Spores WriLer 
Purdue University's pool has never been Notre Oame 's favorite place to compete. 
An old, decrepit facility, the swimming pool resembled more of a dungeon than an arena for athletic competition. Dark, dank and disgusting, it rarely produced fast swims for any visiting team forced to navigate through its nastiness. 
And there's one more prob­lem, too. It was the only site where Notre Dame lost a dual meet last season. 
"I think they caught us off guard," said Irish head coach Bailey Weathers, remember­ing last year's 168-Hl loss to the Boilermakers. "The key for us is not to underestimate them this year. I think when we've been tricked once -we have the tendency to be smarter the second time around." 
But this evening's competi­tion in West Layfayettc, Ind. will likely be a different story. For one thing, Notre Dame will have the chance to compete in Purdue's new $17 million aquatic facility, the replace­ment for the 60-year-old pool that was closed at the univer­sity earlier this year. 
And the Irish swimmers ­who've had this date circled on their calendars si.nce last year's loss -won't be under­estimating anyone on the Purdue squad. 
"They showed up a lot more prepared than we thought they would," said senior co­captain Tara Riggs. "Thcv were as fired up last year as we are this year. We are more psyched for this meet than anv others ... just because we are so upset they beat us last year." 
On paper, the Irish match up well against Purdue, with a solid advantage in both sprint and distance events. The toughest match-ups will be in the breastroke and backstroke events, where senior backstro­ker Kelly Hecking will have her hands full with Purdue junior Lisa Dolansky, and senior breastroker Alison Lloyd will face difficult compe­ti t.ion from Purdue junior Lindsay Lange. 
Notre Dame will be Purdue's first dual meet in its home facility, and only its third com­petition of the year. The only competitions held so far at the new Haywood pool were an intersquad meet and an invita­tional meet last weekend. where the Purdue women won their inaugural competition. 
But that definitely doesn't have Notre Dame scared. "I think we'd swim them in the old pool right now," 


Weathers said. "We're more goal going into tonight's want these records to be star­approaching this as seriously competition, too. They want to ing them in the face for a long as we possibly can." make their mark on the new time."

Making a name for himself 
. J.W. Jordan emerges as a valuable member of the offensive line 
By MIKE CONNOLLY 
Sports W ritcr 
Before Irish fifth-year guard 
J.W. Jordan even stepped on campus. his name was already well-known. His father, John Jordan II, is a member of the Board of Trustees and an influ­ential donor. 
Now, five years later, J.W. Jordan is known by his own name -not his father's -as a member of the Irish football team. After seeing just 13 min­utes, 54 second of playing time in his first four years with the Irish, Jordan has become a reg­ular in the offensive guard rota­tion with 24:49 of playing time in 2001. He's made appear­ances in four games this year and, according to Irish head coach Bob Davie, he's earned every opportunity he's received. 
"I told him when he recruited him, I sat him down and said, "You're going to have to outwork everybody,"' Davie said. '"You're going to have to work for everything you get. You know, let's face it, you're going to have to be in some ways an overachiever, not because you don't have enough athletic abili­ty but because you are under­sized. You're just going to have to outwork everybody."' 
For five years Jordan put in his time in the weight room and with his playbook to improve. Through his dedication, he has become one of the most reliable players on the offensive line. 
"He knows how to get it done," Irish center Jeff Faine said. "He doesn't look like the most dominant player but he gets it done ... He has a lot of experience and knows what is going on." 
But at the same time that Jordan worked hard on the practice field to improve, rumors swirled that he only received his scholarship because of his influential father. The rumors began even before Jordan enrolled. In the Feb. 6, 1997 edition of The Observer, each football player signing with

Close game ends tough season 
By KATIE McVOY Associate Sports Editor 
It was a disappointing game but a proud finish for the Belles. A Tuesday night loss to the Scots of Alma in round one of the MIAA tournament wrapped up a tough season that left Saint Mary's 1-11 in the MIAA and 3-16 overall, but the players left the court with their heads held high. 
"We played better as a team than we have played probably all season," said head coach Julie Schroeder-Biek. "Alma was good competition for us and I felt like we finished the season with our heads held high." 
The Scots took the match in three close games, winning 30-25, 30-23, 30-24. The Belles contributed their strong performance to heightened communication, a part of their game that has been weak all season. 
"I think we communicated well to each other," senior Jaime Dineen said. "We've been working on that all sea­son and I think it came togeth­er in the last game."
