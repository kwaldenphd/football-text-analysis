began to thin, and by the afternoon, there was little if any wait to enroll. Because class schedules arrived in the mail, there was little incentive for students with corn:ct schedules to drag themselves out of bed early, Winicur said. That kept a steady flow of students throughout the day in­stead oflong lines in the morning. 
But students with schedule mix­ups did need to enroll early. A yellow copy of the enrollment form was necessary to add or drop a class. 
While students enjoyed a quick day of enrollment, Winicur was worrying how well his new enroll­ment procedures would work. Wini<.'ur. a former chemistry profes­sor, took over the job in July, and "after seeing the headaches" of registration as assistant dean of science, decided to try to streamline the biannual tradition. 
"I saw that a lot of what we were doing (at registration) wasn't really necessary," Winicur said. "We were asking students for information we already had." 
The most important thing needed at the beginning of each semester is a quick way to count heads. "We have to know who's here and who isn't," Winicur said. Solution? In­troduce the enrollment form. a simple and more direct way of counting students than a stack of computer cards. 
Winicur's long-range plans call for restructuring how students add or drop classes with the possible help of the University'~ new Hewlett­Packard computer. Students would know before break if they have been closed out of a class, and schedule 
adjustments  would  possibly  be  
typed  directly  into  an  "on-line"  
computer terminal.  

But for the third week in January 1984, Winicur was satisfied with the way things were. One day after registration there were only a few students in the registrar's office, and when the flu finally caught up with the new registrar, he was able to go home for an afternoon without any problems at all .

esc offers social concerns groups 
ByPATSAIN 
SeniorStaffReporter 

Do you miss the pressure and the crowds at Activities Night at Stepan Center in September? Were you able to find all the groups you were in­terested in? 
The Social Concerns Festival, which starts tomorrow night at 7 in the Center for Social Concerns, of­fers a second chance for students to learn about social concerns groups at Notre Dame. Notre Dame stu­dents are aware of social problems, but many of them do not see how they can relate to these problems, said Lynn Lawrence, coordinator for service and social action at the Cen­ter. 
"Social work allows you to test

career choices," Lawrence said. "If 
you choose a logical and analytical career, social work allows you to balance your life out," she said . 
There are two types ofsocial con­cerns groups, said Sharon Murphy, coordinator for peace opportunities at the Center. Volunteer service or­ganizations, like the Neighborhood Study Help Program, work in the South Bend area and help tutor stu­dents. Volunteer groups also help the elderly and the handicapped. 
Other social concerns groups, like Amnesty International, deal with "broad issues of peace and justice," and give information on these issues through seminars and fund-raisers. 
John May, vice president of Notre Dame's Right to Life, said, "At ac­tivities night. we hope to find stu­dents interested in our Pregnancy . Help Center, and our home for single mothers. We need volunteers for fund-raising, remodeling the house, and organizing our counsel­ing and support services." 
Like Right to Life, many campus and local social concerns groups will be giving information on their group. In the Center's classroom. there will be a setup similar to !'all Activity Night. with information on different groups available at the group's table. 
Audio-visual presentations on specific groups will be giwn in the Resource Room. and the cof­feehouse will bl· serving coffee and cookies.

l~"t_luly I left Colorado Spring~. my fou1-As­sociate housematcs and new friends to hlTome a full-time Notre Dame employee. I work part-lime a.~ adminbtrator at the Senior Bar and part time on the staffofthe lloly Cross 
Associatl'S. 

Initially only the other staff members joked 
that I could work at Mori·au Seminar)' (where 
lit :A i~ based) hy day and rl-cruit at Senior Bar by night. I have yet to take full advantage ofmy position at Senior Bar (I haven't shown the HCA slide show there), hut I have met quite a few seniors interested in HCA. This contact has allowed me to learn the major misconcep­tions people have about the Associates. 
Many think the program is the first step 
toward priesthood or sisterhood. While some 
Associates have chosen this route, it hy no 
means is the aim of the program. Through my 
experience a.~ an Associate I became much 
more aware and responsible ti1r my role in the 
church. 

Participating in the local Hispanic parish wa.~ a wonderful support system. It helped me meet people living out their Christian hdietS at their workplace. with their families and in their community. These people deeply in­spired me and ht:lped me realize that I could 
combine a degree in business with my heart's desires. 
The HCA experience gave me strength to follow my heart -to break away from the:· ex­pectations of others and, with God's ht:lp, to decide what was hest for me. 
Another fallacy ahout HCA is that it will change one's t·ntire life. A person's life changes drastically when the diploma is in 
hand. How one develops from then on is not 
only a personal choice, hut an individual 
responsibility. 
I wanted life to consist ofmore than eight to 
five and a station wagon. I wanted to discover 
parts ofmysclfyct untapped-to think with a 
far more open mind, ft'el more sincerely, and 
love with more faith. 
I wanted to continue to put in perspective my need for material possessions, and ht' sur­rounded hy others who wanted to live life, not purchase it. For me the Associates was the right place to continue developing these parts 
ofmyself. 
! cannot imagine what my life would he like witnout my Associate experience. Many new aspects of my life opened up. My desire to at­tend law school is still thl·re, hut the urgency is gone. Knowing that law school will he thl'rl' in years to come has given me strcngth to forge on and test myself in other areas, ratlll'r than making rash judgments for short-tnm security.

The real top 10 o£1983 
by Marc Ramirez 
features columnist 

E
very year, in the latter days ofDecember and leading into the ear­ly days of the next year's january, all the movie critics sit down and start figuring out which ofthe last year's movies should be in their "Top Ten of the Year." It may all be very confusing to you, but to them it's a lot offun, and so this year, they did it again. They sat around and went back through their files and cast away such films as "Flashdance," "Yor: Hunter from the Future," and "Strange Brew." Then they went eeny-miny-mo through the remaining movies and picked their Top Ten. 
In their Top Ten they included such achievements as "Silkwood," "Terms of Endearment," "War Games," and "The Right Stuff." I'll have to admit that those are pretty good movies. I mean, I totally loved Meryl Streep's Oklahoma accent; and the general's "After care­ful thought and consideration. I've come to the conclusion that your . defense plan sucks" in "War Games" was one of my favorite lines of the year. 
But the critics were wrong. Oh sure, they think they picked the Top Ten, hut then, critics always think their opinion is sacred.Here is the real Top Ten of 1983, movies that didn't even get a nod from the critics, movies that weren't shown in most public theatres because they were too avant-garde for people to understand. 
Wilkwood. The story ofjamaal Wilkwood, a Notre Dame student who mysteriously falls over dead one day in his dormitory room af­ter investigating his theory that Observer andDome photos have been retouched in order to make Irish guard Dan Duff appear six feet tall. The role is played brilliantly by Robert Blake, and the musical score by Adam and the Ants makes Wilkwood one ofthe year's best. 
Dirty Harry Meets the Tremendous Build-Up ofMold and Bac­teria. Clint Eastwood is at it again, portraying his character of Harry Callahan and trying to justify vigilante justice as he performs the in­spection ofNotre Dame food sales operations. Breaking down doors at will. Dirty Harry uses his .44 Magnum to blow away filthy toasters and microwave ovens. When a mouse seems to contemplate attack in one memorable scene, Harry aims and sneers, "Go on, punk. Make my breakfast." 
-The Big Big Chill. Barry Manilow and Susan Sarandon head a bril­liant cast in this story ofeight Notre Dame juniors who return from Spring Break only to discover that they have been lotteried off campus. As off-campus housing is either nonexistent or in Elkhart, the eight are forced to face the South Bend winter elements. Bob Hope is brilliant as the comedian whose USO show arrives just mo­ments too late as they freeze to death in the snow. 
Tootsie and Yentl and Victor/Victoria. Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, and julie Andrews recreate their brilliant roles in a simple story about a man posing as a woman who falls in love with awoman posing as a man. In the public's eye they are a man and woman in love, but only the man and woman know that they are really a woman and a man. The fun of the plot is complicated when the man posing as a woman becomes a lover to the woman posing as a man posing as a woman and the woman posing as a man gets upset. However. the woman posing as a man posing as a woman doesn't know that the man who hangs around with the man she loves is real­ly a woman posing as a man, and so the woman posing as a man poses 
as a woman in order to gain entry to where the woman posing as a man posing as a woman is posing as a man and kills her. The movie is enhanced greatly by the music ofCulture Club. 
Lettuce Serue You 3-D. Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the dining hall. director Dino DeLaurentis brings this mo­tion picture epic to the screen. Academy Awards galore should go to Phil Dupp. who produced the spectacularspecial effects in this film. It really hits the fan this time, seeming to fly out at you in the audience in a potpourri ofveal, meatcake and gravy. Dee Wallace is brilliant as a dining hall worker who takes matters into her own gloves and saves the day. 
On a Roll. This educational documentary recounts the five days from December 4 to Decembu 8 when a Midwestern university held an event known as "Charmin Week" when it discovered that its students were fans ofthe toilet paper. Mr. Whipple made a cameo ap­pearance and gave away a year's supplies ofCharmin to lucky win­ners. Contests were also held in which groups offour students apiece ran from one end ofa large lawn to the other holdinga roll of Charmin. One end ofthe roll was tacked to a pole, and the object was to avoid tearing the paper. The movie reveals a growing concern among American college students for intellectual social activity. · YourMoney or Your Life. Martin Sheen is brilliant in this story ofa Notre Dame ~tudent who refuses to pay a late fee bill of $1.25 from the Memorial Library. His dormroom water and heat are mysterious­ly turned off, and at registration he is informed that all ofhis classes arc closed. At the dining hall he is constantly served veal no matter what the entree is that night. Angie Dickinson plays the counselor who pays S 1.24 ofthe library bilL 
How To Succeed in Life Without Real(v Trying This film tells the 
story of three stockholders ofthe Notre Dame bookstore and their 
personal troubles as they sit back and collect dividends from early 
semester book sales. William Hurt, Sissy Spacek, and Terry Bradshaw 
are brilliant in the roles. The drama is intense as they face the 
everyday crisis ofwithdrawing thousands ofdollars from their bank 
accounts. Carrie Fisher is also brilliant in the minor role ofa Notre 
Dame student who loses her entire savings to the high boo~M?Sfu, 
prices.

"Possessed" by the grim memory ofblowing a 20-point lead in a 56-54 defeat to Purdue last year. the Illini took control of the Boilermakers this time around. 
"We remember last year-there was no way we were going to let them get back in the game," a pumped-up Illinois center George Montgomer,y said after the Illini hammered visiting Purdue 76-52 Saturday night. 
It was 19th-ranked Purdue's first Big Ten loss and dropped the Boiler­makers into a tie with No. I 0 Illinois for the league lead. Both clubs are 4-1 in conference play. 
Illinois tossed in its last eight shots of the first half and shot 60 percent from the floor overall. Purdue managed only 40 percent of its shots, and hulking, 245-pound cen­terjim Rowinski-whose 18-footer at the horn sealed Purdue's come­back against Illinois last year ­failed to score a point until 26 minutes had passed. He wound up with six points -I 0 below his 
average. 

"We were possessed," said Montgomery, who swarmed about the middle to isolate Rowinski from Purdue's playmaking guards. "There

Going into halftime with another 20-point bulge, 38-18, Illini players went around to each other saying, "Not this time." 
It was IBinois' most resounding victory against PUrdue since 1965. 
"It was very simple," said Purdue Coach Gene Keady. "They were ready for us. It didn't make any dif­ference that we spent all week run­ning their offense in practice. We wasted our time. We might as well have stayed home and studied. 
"We were never in this game," he continued. "What happened last year was once in a lifetime. They were just determined not to let it happen again." 
Quinn Richardson led IBinois, 13­2 overall, with 14 points, Montgomery had 13, Doug Alten­berger 12 and Scott Meents 11. Steve Reid paced Purdue, 11-4 in all games, with 14 points.

Whitmore completed his hat trick in the third period. notching two goals within 38 seconds beginning at 8:17. 
"It felt great," said Whitmore. "I settled down, gained some con­fidence and was ready to play good hockey. Everything worked out." 
St. Norbert picked up its final goal country," said Knight. "I don't like being used, and BiU Frieder has used me." 
Frieder told reporters, "he may not be my friend any more, but he's the best basketball coach in the country. . . .I can't understand Knight. Can you guys?" 
Michigan improved to 12-4 over­all and 4-2 in the Big Ten. Freshman Steve Alford led Indip.na, 10-5 and 3­2, with 12 points.
