INSIDE COLUMN 


Media, politics make sleazy bedfellows 
By election day, North Carolina's Jesse Helms will have spent around $18 million to fight off the challenge for his cov­eted Senate seat. 
Experts estimate 

that Helms, and every Monica Vant 
other candidate this side of Mars, will Assoc. News Editor dump anywhere from one-half to two-thirds of their funds for ad­vertising, a fact that attaches the media to "trash politics" like a bow on a package that explodes in the public's face every time we turn on a television set or read a news­
paper. 
The role of the media in this circus goes as far back as the circus itself, with the the press sinking deeper into the slime every year. From the infamous "Daisy Girl" ad during the Goldwater campaign in '64 to the equally ridiculous "Chicken Across the Road" ad slamming John Hiler this year, candidates have all but mastered the art of using and abusing the television spot. 
This year has been particularly juicy, tele­vision ad-wise. The avid follower of local politics can't help but be angst-ridden over the abominable Joe Donnelly, who's being thrashed through the Midwest mud because he works in Chicago but runs for office in Indiana. 
That fact alone should convince us all to throw Donnelly to a pack of raging wolves, far far away from the State Senate seat he craves. Why? Television tells us so. 
The involvement of television goes beyond the paid advertisement. We're living in ~ videotropic world, where politics and teleVI­sion are tied in a knot in which both have "fallen and can't get up." 
Setting up candidates in staged situations for the networks is more than just a occa­sional activity of the political handler; its a full-time duty. You never know, that poignant shot of Tim Roemer getting cozy with the boys from the Local 101 just might get him the much-needed working class 
vote. 
Newspapers are far from exempt from the media's union with "trash politics," The Observer included. Just last week we ran two photos of George Bush schmoozing it up in Hawaii, as if his less-than attractive presence in a bathing suit is news. But the photographers are summoned, and the press receives this sort of visual bunk as the visual image the President of this country wants to be thought of as newsworthy. 
The media shows no signs of breaking free from the binds of sleazy politics, in part because of the American public. The prevailing disinterest in the issues and fas­cination with the facade has led people like former Reagan advisor Michael Deaver to conclude that in competition between the ear and the eye, ''the eye wins every time." So as voters head to the polls tomorrow, chances are they'll take with them a clearer picture of that damn chicken running across the road than the issue Hiler was supposedly so indecisive about.

WORLD 

Pope John Paul II on sunday beatified two 19th century French and two Italian women who dedicated their lives to helping the poor. Among those honored by the pontiff in a ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica was Louise­Therese de Montaignac, who founded the Oblates of the Sacred Heart. The 


church credits her with the miraculous healing of a young railway worker from Toulouse who 
-was in a coma. The other Frenchwoman beatified was Marthe Aimee Le Bouteiller, the daughter of a poor farmer who became a nun. Her intercession was credited for the return to health of an English nun in Sister Marthe's religious institute. 
A bomb exploded at a German restaurant in Vina del Mar, Chile, injuring three sailors from the U.S. aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and five other people, police and the U.S. Navy said Sunday. No group claimed responsibility for the bombing, which occurred shortly be­fore midnight Saturday, according to police in Vina del Mar, 180 miles west of Santiago. Two of the sailors were treated at a local hospital and released, while the third was treated on board the Abraham Lincoln, said Navy Cmdr. Stephen Honda in Norfolk, Va .. Injuries were lim­ited to cuts and bruises caused by flying glass and other debris, Honda said. About 40 people were in the restau­rant, the Max Moritz, when the bomb went off. They in­cluded a group of sailors from the Nimitz-class aircraft 
carrier.

Notre Dame hosts seminar on homophobia 
By CLAIRE ROBINSON News Writer 
The most important means of dispelling homophobia is edu­cation, according to Sister Jeannine Gramick, editor of a book on homosexual clergy. 
Lesbian and gay individuals also need to start coming out, so that others may see that homosexuals are normal peo­ple, she added. 
Gramick is conducting a seminar today along with Fa­ther Robert Nugent, the author of a book of prayer for people with AIDS. The seminar is enti­tled ".Homophobia in Religion and Society." 
The two travel throughout 
Indiana and Michigan conduct­ing seminars sponsored by the New York based Center for Homophobia Education. "The seminar is in line with the com­passionate teachings of the Catholic Church," said Gramick. "Many bishops have attended." 
Gramick says that the Church teaches respect for fellow hu­man beings, but that "we don't always practice what we preach." The seminar is not without opposition. Gramick said that there were fewer par­ticipants in the Kalamazoo seminar because a letter had been distributed throughout the local parishes discouraging people from attending. 
"So far, more nuns than priests have been attending the seminars," Gramick noted. She cited this as evidence support­ing a study which found men to be much more homophobic than women. 
Gramick and Nugent do not advocate specific political legis­lation in their seminars. Rather, Gramick said that the goal of the seminar is to "help people to consider the gospel and how to treat others in its light." 
Of those who have already at­
tended seminars, Gramick said, 
"Their heads and hearts were 
touched." 
Today's seminar will be held 
at the Hesburgh Library Lounge 
beginning at 8:30 a.m. and 
lasting until 3:30p.m. 

Candlelight service held for soldiers in the Gulf 
By ANN MARIE HARTMAN News Writer 

A "Light a Candle of Hope" Ceremony was held Sunday for military families with service members presently in Saudi Arabia or on their way to the region. 
The cereinony was a symbolic gesture to promote military family strength and unity in the Indiana and nearby Michigan communities, said Frances Anastasio Quirk, public rela­tions director for the American Red Cross, co-sponsor of the event. 
"The families are just as much members of the military as those in uniforms," said Colonel Hemphill, a 25-year military serviceman from the local area. 
A symbolic candle was lit and names of all service members were read off while family members signed a large sea­sonal holiday collage and group letter. 
The event was also sponsored by the "Just Kuwaiting" support group. Founded by Starr Williams and Kay Ellis, current military mothers, in August, the group members wish to send a videotape of this event to sym­bolize their hope that their loved ones overseas will have a safe and happy Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
"Aside from ditty bags and cookies being sent, the group felt a need to send a little bit of home to local guys and gals of theirs who will miss the holiday season with them," said Williams. 
This was the largest gather­ing of military family members in the area to date, according to Mark Kelley of WNDU News. Membership in the group is open to all relatives of military personnel in Saudi Arabia. Cur­rently there are seventy people in the group that attend the monthly meetings. 
WNDU has offered a compli­mentary copy of the roll call and WNDU NewsCenter 16 cov­erage of the "Light A Candle of Hope" Ceremony to members of the group.

Iranians burn U.S. flag, recall embassy siege 
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) ­Hundreds of Iranians chanting "Death to America!" burned the American flag at a rally Sunday in front of the former 
U.S. Embassy in Tehran to mark the 11th anniversary of its takeover by militant stu­dents. 
Tehran television, monitored in Nicosia, showed a large crowd carrying signs proclaiming "Death to America," "Death to Israel," and "Death to Britain." 
Young men and women, in­cluding university students, converged on the rally site from all parts of the capital, the television said. 
Musavi Khoeniha, the former prosecutor who was the mentor of the militant students who stormed the embassy 11 years ago, read a half-hour message from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader. 
Khamenei's message urged the country's feuding radical and so-called pragmatic fac­tions to stop their infighting and remain united. 
Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, a hard-line opponent of Khamenei, then addressed the crowd, warning against the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf. 
He said that "the capture of the U.S. nest of spies in Iran, guaranteed the future of the revolution, and disrupted America's spying machinery."

None of Iran's high-ranking leaders showed up at the rally, which commemorates what is considered a turning point in the history of the 1979 revolution. 
President Hashemi Rafsanjani has been trying to temper the revolution since the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in June 1989. 
Rafsanjani has been engaged in efforts to sideline Khomeini's hard-line, anti­Western followers, and rebuild relations with the West to attract investment and advanced technology. 
The radicals accuse Rafsan­jani, and Khamenei, his politi­cal ally, of straying from Khomeini's anti-Western le­gacy. Both leaders deny that this is true. 
Rafsanjani said in speech to students from around the country Sunday that "with the capture of the American nest

Students may be considered snobbish 
By ANNA MARIE TABOR News Writer 
According to television critic Robert Thompson, much of what makes us students is re­garded as snobbish by the American public. 
Most intelligent people don't necessarily feel superior to ev­eryone else, Thompson said, but "lofty goals often make you a part of some elite, intellectual group." Often as a response to motivation "you will become snobs in others' eyes." 
"The over-educated are held in a suspicious fashion," said Thompson, associate professor of communications at the State University of New York-Cort­land, in a lecture at Saint Mary's. lie supported his claim with illustrations that preten­tiousness runs rampant among educated people. 
Thompson himself has admit­ted to "putting on airs" when he is out of his element, thus fueling the snob image. He said he is guilty of acting like he knows about cars when he's getting his serviced so that the mechanics won't fix something that isn't broken. 
Thompson said that preten­sion goes beyond the garage in that "professors and intellectu­als act differently around the working class. We are a country of action over words." 
Although intellect is a desired trait, "I would have traded in my National Honor Society pin for an effective zit cream," Thompson joked. 
Television reflects how the unpretentious and often illiter­ate are our heroes. "In the popular show 'Cheers,' Diane is the epitome of snobbishness. She is the butt of jokes, the fall guy for the straightmen. Who is the barfly, loser type who ev­eryone loves?" Thompson asked. 
The audience responded in a "Norm!" chorus not unlike the familiar one on the show. 
Thompson cited characters from Dirty Harry, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Flashdance who use small words and the most popular Rambo and Rocky who uses "sub-syllables-Yo!" These heroes have qualities other than intelligence that our soci­ety idealizes. 
The portrait of pretension is "embodied in how you drink tea, English-style with the pinkie in the air," Thompson said. By contrast, his supreme example of unaffected behavior is Animal House, the film that made "'party a verb." 
Thompson showed a clip from Animal House that played what he calls the "Anti-Core song," in reference to the many classes students are required to take throughout their academic careers.

Cuba discussed at weekend symposium 
By JESSICA ZIEMBROSKI News Writer 
The Cuban Labor Law, U .S./Cuban relations, the Cuban judicial system and constitu­tional idealism were among the issues discussed this weekend at a symposium on the restoration of legal order in Cuba. 
Also presented were views on private property in Cuba, the legal profession and Cuban me­dia today. 
Speaking specifically on the future of Cuba was Luis Aguilar Leon, professor of Latin Ameri­can government at Georgetown University. According to Leon, "No legal system is going to

work without the backing of justice." 
The "pre-Castro Catholic morale" that once existed within the country has largely diminished. As a result, there has been an expanded cynicism among the people, said Leon, and, in the future, "(only) if ethic is high, then laws will be few." 
Leon sees the Catholic Church as a potential source of this ethic. 
"There is no [longer) religious guidance since the collapse of the Marxist ethic and we need that confidence in the people for a constitution and laws," said Leon. 
On the contrary, Leon sees the current situation as "people pretending to be a revolution­ary, a socialist -anything to survive." 
Also stressing the importance of Catholicism was Xavier Suarez, the mayor of Miami, saying "a new Cuba must be built on the foundations of the Catholic Church." He also said that Cuba must learn by exam­ple from the United States in the reconstruction of its coun­try. 
According to Suarez, "those in Cuba are subject to an excess of compelled order and are fighting three decades of op­pression." However, with fur­ther work in labor unions, and the development of religious freedom, "Cuba can be a ra­cially, economically, and so­cially changed place starting with the attitudes of the peo­ple." 
Also in order for this change to take place, "positive rights and a decent standard of living must be added with basic free­doms," said Suarez. 
The conference was given by the Cuban American Union of Student Advocates and held at the Notre Dame Law School. Key speakers were Suarez, Jose Serrano, former U.N. Ambas­sador to the United Nations, and Bishop Agustin Roman of the Archdiocese of Miami.

nar sections. Most are now

and adjunct professors. 
Vanden Bossche explained 
that the number of students in 
the College of Arts and Letters 
has doubled over the last ten 
years. Consequently, the de­
partments in the College can 
spare fewer full time faculty 
members away from 400 level 
classes to teach the freshman 
classes. 
Six of the seven members of 
the Committee to Evaluate the 
Freshman Writing Program are 
professors from different de­
partments within the College of 
Arts and Letters. The other 
member, Mark Herro, is an as­
sociate professor of electrical 
engineering. Scott Boehnen, 
sophomore in the College of 
Arts and Letters, is the only 
student on the Committee 
which will meet bimonthly. 
All of the professors in the 
Committee have taught Fresh­
man Seminar. Based on his ex­
perience teaching this class, 
Vanden Bossche commented, 
"I've found that our students' 
basic writing skills are pretty 
good. But they can't use writing 
to develop an argument and to 
work through an analytical 
problem. I'd like to see more 
emphasis in that area."

has changed because of this. It used to be the initiative of stu­dents to get insurance and prove they have it," he said. 
There were problems with this system, however, according to Moore. First was "the sheer logistics of the program -de­termining did everyone have in­surance and keep it up." Also, students from countries with socialized medicine often failed to see the need for such a pro­gram and resisted getting in­surance coverage. 
Under the new system, the university enrolls all foreign students in an insurance pro­gram provided by the univer­sity, but students who have or want to get their own insurance policy may do so provided they show written proof, according to Moore. He said, "There would obviously be one way to make sure that no student ever had this happen to them again."

Armenian-Azerbaijani political fight continues 
ERASKH, U.S.S.R. (AP) ­Edik Badalian, a fatigue-clad guerrilla in the mountains of Armenia, raised his 1905 vin­tage carbine and squeezed off a shot at an imaginary invader from the neighboring Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. 
"We usually carry hunting rifles. But we have what we need," said Badalian, 38, who also wore a pistol. Members of his eight-man unit showed off a handmade mortar and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and said they had automatic weapons hidden in the hills. 
"We station ourselves around farms and settlements to protect them against Azerbaijanis," said Badalian, who works as a construction engineer by day and patrols by night. 
A few miles away, Soviet troops did sentry duty on the rugged border between Arme­nia and Azerbaijan, the scene of ethnic clashes for two years. 
The sealed frontier between the two republics symbolizes the political violence that is rising in distant corners of the Soviet Union as the Kremlin's political authority falls. 
Last week, two Armenian shepherds were killed on the border and Armenian guerrillas briefly took four Soviet soldiers hostage in retaliation for the detention of several local residents in the embattled enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
At least three separatists were killed Friday in ethnic strife in the southeastern re­public of Moldavia. 
In the Caucasian republic of Georgia, a politician was shot in the arm two days before balloting on Oct. 28. 
Over the past 18 months, violence also has struck along the border between Uzbekistan and Kirgizia, the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan, the Georgian capital of Tbilisi and the Abkhazian section of Georgia. 
The fighting has helped keep alive rumors that the military and KGB security police might be plotting to crack down against the disorder that has accompanied the reforms of President Mikhail Gorbachev. 
One rumor depicts Gorbachev as the leader of the crackdown, another as its victim. 
In Armenia and Georgia, where passions are running high, people accuse Gorbachev of trying inflame rather than quell the violence. 
"The Kremlin is creating an­other Lebanon in the Caucasus. They want to create the illusion that the Caucasians are fighting among themselves, and that the Russians must go in and restore order," said Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who is emerging as the dominant politician in Georgia. 
Soviet central authorities have balked at open interven­tion in Georgia since April 9, 1989, when army paratroopers used sharpened shovels to disperse a peaceful rally in Tbilisi, killing 19. 
The incident sent shock waves through the entire Soviet Union, and shoved Georgia firmly toward a declaration of independence. 
That momentum was evident in balloting last week as Gamsakhurdia's Round Table non-Communist bloc won control of the Georgian Supreme Soviet legislature on a platform of independence and capitalism. 
The voting was peaceful, the campaign at times violent. Two days before the election, Gamsakhurdia's rival, Georgi Chanturia, was shot in the arm. 
Chanturia accused Gam­sakhurdia of arranging the shooting on orders from the KGB. Gamsakhurdia retorted that Chanturia either staged the event or was shot by central authorities seeking to spark civil war. 
The situation is just as murky in Moldavia. There, the legislature has declared sovereignty from Moscow and talking of reunifying with neighboring Romania, from which it was separated in World War II. 
But ethnic Russians and Ukrainians have declared their own "Dniester republic" in eastern Moldavia, and the Gagauz -a group of Christian Turks -have proclaimed independence in southern Moldavia.

Hungary plans to join the Council of Europe 
STRASBOURG, France (AP) -Hungary plans to join the Council of Europe on Tuesday, the first of several former Communist bloc nations ex­pected to gain membership in the oldest postwar body pro­moting European cooperation.

Soviets flock to Red Square for blessing ceremony 
MOSCOW (AP) -More than 2,000 people pushed past police in Red Square on Sunday to pray and watch the blessing of a cornerstone for a cathedral to be built on the site of a 17th century church razed by Stalin. 
The event took place under the stony gaze of a three-story portrait of Communist leader Vladimir Lenin erected for Wednesday's Revolution Day parade. 
Dozens of priests in sky-blue robes carried gold icons marched with Russian Ortho­dox Church Patriarch Alexi II of Moscow across the square and past the Lenin mausoleum. 
Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin and 
. 

Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov held candles as the patriarch consecrated the cornerstone with holy water. The Cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan is expected to be completed in two years. 
The original cathedral, built in 1630 under Czar Mikhail Romanov, was destroyed in the 1930s by Josef Stalin. It was replaced by a summer cafe and later a public toilet. 
The patriarch held a service in Uspensky Cathedral inside the Kremlin to celebrate the feast day of Our Lady of Kazan. 
Scores of worshipers who shielded flickering candles in their hands marched through the Spassky Gate as bells pealed in the square.

U.S. consulate attacked by leftist rebels in Peru's capital 
LIMA, Peru (AP) -Leftist rebels fired at least two rocket grenades at the U.S. consulate Sunday night, shattering dozens of windows, police said. No injuries were reported. 
Security forces held a brief shootout with the attackers, who escaped in a pickup truck. No arrests were made. 
The attack occurred at 7:50 
p.m. at the consulate offices in a residential neighborhood of Miraflores, an upper-class dis­trict of metropolitan Lima. 
Police said one grenade struck the outside wall of an apartment building next to the consulate. The other grenade apparently struck the front of the apartment building. 
The explosions shattered windows on the upper floors of the 12-story consulate, in the apartment building, and in nearby homes. But they caused little other damage, authorities said. 
The police did not say if they believed the attackers were Maoist Shining Path rebels or pro-Cuban Tupacamaru guer­rillas, the country's two leftist rebel groups. 
Almost 20,000 people have died in political violence since the Shining Path took up arms against the government 10 years ago.

Daily News presses rolling, despite strikers 
NEW YORK (AP) -The strike-bound Daily News trudged ahead Sunday, handing out free samples and using "hawkers" to sell papers where vendors feared union intimida­tion. 
However, spokeswoman Lisa Robinson would not say how many papers were printed, dis­tributed or sold. 
Vendors at 10 midtown Man­hattan newsstands chosen at random Sunday said they had no Daily News; many said they had not seen the paper in sev­eral days. 
"We're still publishing," said Robinson. "We're still seeing gaps in distribution. Many, many people support us. Some people don't." 
Talks have been fruitless since they began in January over contracts that expired in March. The unions charge un­fair labor practices. 
The News was struck by eight of its 10 unions on Oct. 25, with the Newspaper Guild joining the strike the next day. Members of the Typographical Union have continued working because they have guaranteed lifetime jobs. 
Nonunion editors and re­porters from other papers op­erated by the News' parent company, The Tribune Co., have helped the skeleton crew of management employees that produced the paper since after the strike began. The Tribune Co. also operates newspapers in Chicago, Virginia and Florida. 
Robinson said strike-related incidents led to six arrests overnight in the city and sub­urbs. 
Police Officer Scott Bloch said a New York Times truck driver allegedly attacked a Daily News driver Saturday night. The News driver broke his ankle getting out of the truck. 
Bloch said The Times driver was charged with criminal mis­chief, assault and weapon pos­session. 
Two men were charged early Sunday with criminal mischief and criminal tampering after they allegedly pulled radio wires off a Daily News building on Long Island. Nassau County police Officer Andy DeSimone said he did not know if they were union members. · 
Police say 24 people have been arrested in the city since the strike began. 
In a full-page advertisement Saturday, the News offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and con­viction of people involved in strike-related violence, and $500 for information leading to an arrest. Robinson said Sun­day she didn't know if anyone had qualified yet.

Americans brace against bleak economic outlook 
NEW YORK (AP) -A remedy for hard times has emerged: Take your lumps now and put the bad news behind you. 
That was the strategy em­
' 
r ployed this past week by two big corporate names, who chose to pay the piper now
f 
rather than later. 
I 
General Motors Corp., the na­tion's largest industrial com­pany, and Eastman Kodak Co., r the 18th biggest, took hefty r charges in the third quarter to put some big problems to rest. ~ The charges turned profits into 
losses for both. 
GM, slugging through a slump in auto sales, said it took a $2.1 billion charge to cover the costs of plant closings and
t 
other production cutbacks. The stunning accounting move re­sulted in a $2 billion loss for the quarter, the largest in au­
f 
tomotive history. 
r 
It was a dismal quarter all' around for the Big Three au­~ tomakers. Ford Motor Co. re­ported lower than expected earnings, and Chrysler regis­
f 
tered a $214 million loss. With­out its charge, GM would have
~ 
managed a gain of just $109 million. 
The motivation for Kodak's move was a $909.5 million patent infringement judgment the company has been ordered to pay rival Polaroid. 
Kodak officials said that although no money has changed hands and the case was still under appeal, it was appropriate to book the charge right away. 
That left the photographic company with a $206 million third-quarter loss. Earnings would have risen 19 percent to $358 million without the judg­ment. 
Was the bloodletting good medicine? Wall Street thought so and registered its approval by bidding up shares of GM and Kodak after their announce­ments. 
Experts said the moves went a long way toward wiping the slate clean for both companies, although they still face stern 
competition in  a  tough  econ­ 
omy.

prompting companies across the country to retrench. Citi­corp, General Dynamics and Aetna were among several an­nouncing cutbacks. Many economists said it could be the start of something ugly. 
"We haven't had a recession for so long that people forget what happens," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. 
The news on the economy continued to darken, with the exception of a surprising gov­ernment report that pegged economic growth at a strong 
1.8 percent in the third quarter. 
That hopeful report was later overshadowed by a litany of woe from several sources. 
The government's economic forecasting gauge dropped 0.8 percent in September, its sec­ond straight monthly drop. By conventional wisdom, three consecutive declines in the In­dex of Leading Economic Indi­cators signal a recession. 
The government said unem­ployment held steady in October at 5.7 percent, but job erosion continued among manufactur­ing and construction payrolls. A separate report showed con­struction spending in Septem­ber took its deepest plunge since the 1982 recession. 
A report from the National Association of Purchasing Management said October was the worst month for manufac­turers in eight years.

Marijuana magazine will fold 
Publisher attributes failure to anti-drug climate 
CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -Sinsemilla Tips, the magazine for marijuana growers, is going out of business after 10 years be­cause of the nation's anti­drug climate, its publisher says. 
"Drug hysteria and para­noia" in the United States led to circulation declines for the quarterly magazine, publisher Tom Alexander of Corvallis said recently. The last issue of the periodical named for a potent strain of pot will be released this month. 
"Ten months ago, our cir­culation was 20,000," he said of the quarterly printed in Portland. "Now, it's 4,000." 
Alexander's store in Cor­vallis, Full Moon, also was hit during a nationwide series of raids on stores al­leged to be selling equipment used for marijuana cultiva­tion. 
First published in May 1980, Sinsemilla Tips was 
printed in Eugene until 
about 1986, then was printed in Portland. Labeling itself as a "domestic mari­juana journal," the magazine featured a variety of marijuana-related news, features and advice columns, as well as analysis of drug issues. 
The publication's circula­tion reached its peak of 20,000 in 1987 and main­tained that level until last year

October 20th is a day I will probably never forget. As an alumnus, it was great to be back on campus for such a thrilling day and memorable game. However, the real memo­ries started as the game ended. 
As the time on the clock ran down, many of you poured from your seats to climb the wall and enter the field. My 13 year old daughter and I were seated in the first row below you. The flood of humanity pinned us against the wall. The fear on Coleen's face as the breath was being crushed from her lungs is something I will never forget.

Get some class Notre Dame. No, Miami does not have a pure past with respect to their foot­ball program. But before we cast that first stone, let's take a deep look at ourselves.

LETTERS 


Author infers Satinism into song 
Dear Editor: 
This brief statement is di­rected toward the esteemed Joe Moody's desecration of the classical, immortal, philosophi­cally heart-rendering song "Hotel California," written and performed by the venerable and honorable Don Henley of the Eagles. (The Observer, Oct.15) 
He says one of the more in­spiring songs of a generation is satanically inspired. How one can see these things is beyond me and my simple ideals of the world and its happenings. 
This slandering of "Hotel California" is particularly rife with the mundane cliches and historical footnotes that have failed to bring this song down in the past. Yet, once again, someone must make a bombas­tic attack on something which would be better left alone. I, for one, am outraged at such an attack of the virtue, the very essence of one of the most en­dearing songs of all time. 
If some sort of Satan-music connection is desired to be found, why not try someone more deserving? I'm sure if Mr. Moody put his mind to it, he could find more provocative lyrics in other groups. I seem to remember the recent banning of one national group because of their lyrics, why not try them! Leave the Eagles out of this one. I do have just one question for the author of the "HC" defamation, though-where did he become personally acquainted with the intricacies of the Church of Satan? 
Moody claims that the "Hotel" in question is the Church of Satan, created in 1969 by Anton Levey in California. He bases all of this upon only the mentioning of one date in the song. 
Did it ever occur that any number of events took place in 1969 besides the founding of a great evil? Any one of a dozen events could account for the date 1969 in the song-perhaps the landing of the U.S. astro­nauts on the moon, the Mets winning the World Series or even perhaps Woodstock. 
Is the only spirit Moody can think of an anti-Christian spirit, or is the spirit of Woodstock too much of an existentialist idea to grasp? Perhaps, Mr. Moody, the year 1969 was used just because it rhymes. Some great forbidding mystery there, huh? Just think if he had used the year 1929, the song would be about the great evil stock market crashes. Oooh, it sends shivers up and down my spine. 
The aforementioned slander­ous author also seems to have grandiose illusions that all bells are related to hell and the Church of Satan. Hmmm. Who 
1

else used bells? Maybe, the

Catholic Church?

To quote a line from "The

Abyss," "we all see what we

want, you've just got to look with better eyes." ~ 
Why does materialism come ~ into Mr. Moody's dissertation so 1 often? Is it because he asso­
1

ciates material wealth with he­donistic activities and therefore the Church of Satan? I see it differently. Material wealth, in­stead of being exhorted by those in Satan's Church, is given up by God's children. We go to the kingdom and revel in the life we find there, "dancing in the courtyard." 
In summary, please don't read something into nothing. Neither you nor I could ever possibly go through Mr. Henley's mind and know for sure what he was thinking when he created the timeless opus known as Hotel California. There is enough evil in the world. Why in God's name would Mr. Moody want to create more?

Funding affects art beyond legitimate role 
By Andrew 
Scarcella 

Congress has recently passed a law which places restrictions upon those who receive federal funding from the· National Endowment for the Arts. The law, which is one of many that limit the use of N.E.A. funds, bars funded artists from creat­ing "obscene" works. The art community has cried "censorship," while traditional conservatives have celebrated a law which U.S. Senator Jesse Helms claims is intended to "stop the liberals from spending taxpayer's money on perverted, deviant art." 
Art is a matter of personal expression; what may be beau­tiful to some, may be offensive to others. While I wholeheart­edly agree with Senator Helms' point of view, I also feel that governmental restrictions exer­cise legitimate, yet undue cen­sorship. It is not a function of our government to subsidize "perverted art," nor is it a function of our government to defme "perverted art." Thus, I believe that our federal gov­ernment should not fund art (N.E.A.) at all. 
Our government places re­strictions and stipulations upon all of the grants and subsidies it distributes. Power to fund provides legitimate power to control. The power to control does not supersede our consti­tutional rights, but the power to define and interpret our rights is inherent with the power to control. The definitions and regulations which our government applies to an 
N.E.A. funded artist are legiti­mate; they do not constitute "censorship," while the applica­tion of such regulations to a non-funded artist would. 
Our government is not ca­pable of determining what is art or is not. The definition of art is found in the eyes of the beholder. While Andres Serrano may find artistic value in his Piss Christ, which depicts what William Saffire described as a "marinated religious sym­bol," I cannot find any. What may "make a statement" to some members of the artistic 

Genders must share role shifts 
Dear Editor: 
As I read issues of the The Observer which get sent to me in far away Mexico City, I am pleased to hear about Notre Dame's attempts to improve male/female relations on cam­pus. We, as a university com­munity, have a ways to go, but the opportunities offered through this year's focus on women and the basic commu­nity spirit of Notre Dame gives the University strong chances for meaningful progress. 
However, one very damaging misconception must be ad­dressed and put to rights. The misconception that to improve their lots women must be the sex still forced to do a juggling act with life's choices must end. Society must learn to accept the idea that for the full equality of both sexes, men must begin to take more responsibility for family life. In this day and age, it is becoming unacceptable for men to be nothing more than 
r 
the primary bread earner 
r (especially since more and 
r more women are earning their own "bread").
~ 
, · Before women can attain the equal status that they deserve and have long since earned, it must be realized that the woman's traditional role is not the only gend~r role that must undergo changes. Eileen Kolman, Chair of the Year of Women Committee, stated that " ... an undergraduate woman will need to make future choices in order to balance marriage, a career and a fam­ily. A male does not have to worry about a family infringing upon his life." 
This attitude, the attitude that says only women must do the changing and adjusting and juggling, must end. Such an attitude only makes women's struggle for equality more difficult. If men and women, in the near future, are to meet each other on common and equal ground, then both sexes must realize that both traditional gender roles must change. It is an almost impos­sible task and a selfish request to expect women alone to be child rearer, career woman, happy homemaker and devoted wife. I challenge any male to try to accomplish four full-time oc­cupations at once. 
Women will only be able to reach their full potential when men give to women the same support that men, for the most part, have expected and re­ceived throughout history. life's challenges can be handled alone but are best conquered when the sexes combine their talents and work together to­wards common goals.

Sports emphasis explains ranking 
Dear Editor: 
The Oct. 10 Observer issue reports the absence of Notre Dame in the US News & World Report's annual rankings of the top national universities. 
Permit me, as one conversant with a few of the people who determine such rankings, to enlighten our community as to the causes of said judgement. 
1) There is perceived to be a decided decline in the quality of undergraduate liberal arts edu­cation at Notre Dame. 
2) Not unrelated to the above, there is perceived to be a shal­low, indeed hollow, pursuit of "research" in areas of sheer, tendentious folly: eg. Deconstructionism, Have Method-will-Measure Social (pseudo) Sciences and mindless trendy "in" concerns. e.g. Gender & Peace Studies.) 
3) There is perceived to exist at du Lac an inordinate empha­sis upon athletics at the ex­pense of intellectual pursuits. That perception is strongly supported by the Gourman Report which, in the category of "Balance between Academics and Athletics," does not even rank Notre Dame in the top 50. Notre Dame is not even given an honorable mention amongst the next 100. Is The Observer startled? Why? After all, 30 to 50 percent of The Observer's pages are devoted to sports. 
This campus is plagued by sports and social(ist) concerns:. Is it any wonder that "Notre Dame slips" in serious, as opposed to football polls? 
James J. Carberry Professor Department ofChemical Engineering Oct. 16, 1990 

community can just as easily be viewed as "obscene" by the American public. 
The Supreme Court has at­tempted to define "obscenity" in relation to the distribution of pornographic materials. In Miller vs. California (1973) the Court said the "obscene" mate­rials appeal to a "prurient in­terest," have no "serious liter­ary, artistic, political, or scien­tific value," and should be judged by "community stan­dards." The Court's definition itself appears to be vague; how do you define a "prurient inter­est" or a "community stan­dard?" 
Richard Oldenburg, director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, stated that "creativity requires freedom of expression," including the lib­erty "to explore new paths which may occasionally test our tolerance." It is not the role of our federal government to stifle freedom of expression, nor is it the role of our federal govern­ment to block the "new paths" to which Oldenburg refers. The only legitimate way to stop our federal government from influ­encing artists is to eliminate all government support for the arts. 
Cutting all federal support for the arts will not eliminate our federal budget deficit, nor will the money "saved" serve as a cure-all for any of our other national concerns. Elimination of federal support for the arts is not a matter of politics or policy, it is a matter of princi­ple. IVmakes no difference whether our federal govern­ment gives one dollar or one billion dollars to art funding; there are going to be just as many stipulations and regula­tions placed upon the one dollar as there are going to be place upon the one billion dollars. There can be no "lesser of two evils" in this case. There is just as much power to control which emanates from the one dollar as there is from the one billion dollars. 
If federal funding for the 
N.E.A. is eradicated, then art will not be forgotten, nor will it be lost. The private sector will be able to pick up where our government has left off. Support for museums and plays will be funded privately. Artists and writers will be guided by the market, not by our federal government. If an artist feels that a work which may be "obscene" will generate enough revenue to support him, then more power to him. I would certainly not support a "marinated religious symbol," but there are others that might. Self-interest will motivate artists. Nearly all of the "great" literary and artistic works were created by artists without government support. 
Funding of art is not a needed, nor is it a legitimate, function of our government. Our government's purpose is to protect our constitutional rights, not to suppress them. It is not feasible for artists to ac­cept federal funds and not be influenced by the government. William Saffire described the relationship best: "Who takes the king's shilling becomes the king's man."

LETTERS 

Cartoon misrepresents shootings 
Dear Editor: 
The comic in The Observer on Oct. 17 depicting five Palestinians facing the firing squad in front of the Wailing Wall is a very interesting but incomplete account of what took place on Oct. 8 when 20 Palestinians were killed and hundreds wounded by blood­thirsty, trigger-happy Israeli policemen. The comic isn't very funny, but it could be a "riot" with a few changes. 
The Western Wall (the most holy site in Judaism) is shown as the wall of a firing squad. There are rocks strewn across the ground with the caption, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. a bullet for a rock." If the comic were to be more ac­curate and much funnier, it would have shown over 3,000 enraged Palestinians instead of the 5 dejected souls that the artist has shown. The Palestinians in the comic have their hands tied behind their backs, which is not very funny at all. The Palestinians should be holding rocks, bottles and bricks while shaking their free fists in defiance. 
The artist who drew this comic seems to have mixed up a good number of things that would have made the comic much better. For instance, the Palestinians should be shown on the Temple Mount above the Wailing Wall which is where they were located when they desecrated Judaism's most holy sight by showering bricks and bottles down on those murder­ous Jews that were celebrating the holiday of Sukkot. The artist should have included something in the caption about how silly those crazy Jews looked running around with Torah scrolls perched up in the air when the bottles and rocks began smashing them-now that would be funny. 
Along with the rocks on the ground surrounding the "wall," there should be Jewish blood and maybe even bits of a Rabbi's beard who was smashed by a bottle. Funny stuff. 
Perhaps the comic should be expanded to show Israeli po­licemen using tear gas and rubber bullets in an attempt to quell the Palestinian attack, but that wouldn't be very funny. 
Maybe the comic should have an additional caption explain­ing that the Palestinian mob had assembled to protect the Dome of the Rock and the AI Aqsa Mosque from a handful of demonstrators. The caption could also say that Israeli police in the "old city" of Jerusalem prevented this occurrence from taking place. Also mentioning that since rioting has generally not taken place in the "old city," the main purpose of the police presence is to protect both the Moslem and Jewish holy sites. But that won't make anyone laugh, because the truth isn't very funny. 
Mr. Araman wrote an article just below the comic declaring that, "Bloodshed displays Israeli authorities' total disre­gard of Palestinian human life." Mr. Araman can't understand why a handful of policemen had to shoot people to protect themselves and Jewish civilians. What does Mr. 
Araman expect? Should the Israelis lay down their weapons and assume their historical role as the victims that the entire world feels sorry for? Mr. Araman knocks Jews and doesn't hold the "Palestinian authorities" responsible. After all, the "Palestinian authorities", (Yasir Arafat chairman of the PLO and company) were in Baghdad leading the uproar. Interestingly enough, there were no tears in Arafat's eyes as he lovingly embraced his people's champion, Saddam Hussein, over the weekend. Don't pay any attention to Saddam Hussein's boasting that he will burn half of Israel; after all, he proved his high regard for human life when he dropped chemical bombs on his own citizens during the Iran­Iraq war. And let us not forget that it is the PLO who has en­couraged violent riots through­out the Intifada that have con­tinually resulted in loss of life ­and anti-Israeli media cover­age. Perhaps they consider front page news-print more sa­cred than human life. 
What the bloodshed on Oct. 8 displays is that the Israeli au­thorities will protect their citi­zens through use of force, if necessary. The Palestinian ac­tion on Oct. 8 was a desecration of Judaism, sending yet another message of violence in the face of peace -as if allying themselves with Saddam Hussein had not already done so.

knowledge abroad, he said. In addition, strong anti-drug programs are needed in the schools to protect our youth. Finally, education should be made more accessible to all, said Roemer. 
Roemer compares his drug policy to a scissor. He explains that one blade is interdiction both in foreign countries and on our own borders. The second blade is education and programs, such as DARE, which encourage rehabilita­tion. 
He uses Lifehouse, a local rehabilitation center for alcohol and drug abusers, as an example of the need for more funding in the war against drugs. According to Roemer, Lifehouse has turned away up to 80 percent of those applying for help due to lack of funds. 
It is time for government to m~e tough decisions on the budget, Roemer said. For Roemer, these tough cuts should come in the areas of agriculture, NASA and defense. Roemer says he feels a space station is not necessary and believes that smart cuts must be made in defense. 
Such weapons as Strategic Defense Initiative, MX rail­garrisons and B-2 bombers are becoming obsolete as the threat of war with the Soviet Union dwindles, while the locally produced "Hummer" truck is proving itself in­valuable in the Middle-East, he said. · 
In the area of economics, Roemer's policy is based largely on the fact that no

was a member of the subcommittee of the House Banking Committee which directly monitored the Savings and Loans. In addition, even though Mr. Hiler held partial ownership of a bank, he still sought this position and in­troduced bills which would benefit banks. 
Another suspect facet of Hiler's office is that two of his assistants have been involved in suspected criminal activity. (One is serving time now and the other is preparing for trial). Hiler has never enjoyed the success which he should, especially in a district which was gerrymandered to give the advantage to the Republicans. In fact, his highest level of sup­port in 1 0 years has only been 54 percent. Hiler has also been a long-standing member of the "Dirty Dozen"-a group which is identified as being notorious for voting against bills to pro­tect the environment. 
benefits from the trickle down theory ever reached the 3rd Indiana district. The poor and middle class have not been treated fairly, said Roemer, citing the fact that it will cost $5,000 per taxpayer to straighten out the Savings and Loan failure. 
He is concerned that after bailing out the Savings and Loan industry, taxpayers must then pay for a $30,000 pay raise for congressmen. According to Roemer, it is time Congress started spending tax money more wisely. 
As it is in other elections, abortion is a key issue. Roemer says he is a pro-life candidate. He supports counseling for women contemplating an abortion and would like to see support net­works that build a compassionate environment for both the mother and the child. He says he wants women to be able to feel that their child will be born into a caring environment. His exceptions are rape, incest, and threat to the mother's life. 
Roemer is also concerned with the environment. He says he would like to introduce legislation that would improve the environment, such as well­head protection. He says new environmental technologies will create new jobs and give America something to sell to the Japanese. 
The anti-incumbant fervor that has been prevalent across the nation this election year has also affected Tim Roemer. "In 1988, 402 out of 408 congressional incumbents were re-elected. That's not democracy, that's less turnover than the Soviet Politburo." 
Roemer believes Congress is "an institute for re-election." He says elections need to be 
Finally, Hiler admits that he is having difficulty in passing bills out of committee and later on the House floor because he is unable to get the necessary Democratic support. All of these factors, when combined, raise a legitimate concern. Former President John F. Kennedy once said, "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." Looking at John Hiler's record, it is arguable that. he is not fully utilizing the power which the voters have given him for the benefit of the country; when he does use his power, it tends to be for his own inter­ests. 
Tim Roemer is running on behalf of Middle Class America. An ABC survey found that 65 percent of Americans feel that politicians do not care about what happens at home. Roemer does care, because he is part of the same middle­class that most of us come from. He personally makes $29,000 per year, and he is seeing a larger chunk go away to help patch up the blunders of the affluent congressmen. 
Monday, November 5, 1990 
more competitive. To do this he would not limit the number of terms a person can serve, but instead eliminate the advantages held by incumbents like franking privileges and unlimited campaign funds. 
Roemer says he feels this year's campaign for the 3rd district seat a negative one, citing a particular Hiler ad which labeled Roemer a liberal. A label that has had negative connotations since the 1988 presidential cam­paign. 
He pointed out that his opponent once said that in 1986, when he won by 4 7 votes, he had run a "warm and fuzzy" campaign, but the margin was too close and this time he decided to change his strategy. 
Roemer has been conducting his local attack through the efforts of the "Caravan for Change." He and his supporters go into neighborhoods and walk door to door. They also speak to people at malls, coffee shops and church gatherings. On Saturday, the Caravan stopped at the Sweet Home Missionary Baptist Church for lunch and a prayer from the pastor Rev­erend Jones. 
Roemer says he tries to spend time with every person he meets, from boys hitting cans with a stick to a family trying to repair a garage to two elderly men helping each other rake leaves. 
This is how he plans to represent the 3rd district in Congress-by listening to the people. He believes that his "Caravan for Change" has allowed him to reach many of the people that government may have forgotten. 
He favors campaign finance reform, so that the "obscene" process of fund-raising will no continue into the nex generation. Tim contends tha only by opening the democratic process to all the people, including minorities women and the poor, will we truly have a government "by for, and of the people." 
On Oct. 20, the Notre Dame family had the opportunity to support the "Team of the 1990s" as it challenged the fa vored "Team of the 1980s. Once the game had ended, Notre Dame had prevailed over Miami, completing the changing of the guard in college football. On Nov. 6, we once again have the opportunity to change the guard and help a member of the Notre Dame family become a leader of the 1990s. A vote for Tim Roemer is a vote for values, for changes, for new ideas, for the middle class, and for the new era of responsible government.

supporting Congressman John Hiler: his stands on education, the environment and foreign affairs. However, I do not think my testimony would be complete without discussing his opponent. Tim Roemer claims that he will represent the interests of the Third District of Indiana; however, I question his ability to do that when almost 90 percent of his campaign finances come from outside the state. I also question his ability to govern considering the highlight of his political experience is his past position as a legislative assistant to Senator DeConcini, who is currently under investigation for his role in the S & L crisis. Finally, I take exception to the misleading charges Roemer has leveled against Hiler's voting record on important issues such as the S & L crisis and Catastrophic Health Care. 
In my experience with Congressman Hiler's campaign, I have found him to be a fair, intelligent and effective representative who should be returned to the Congress. That is why I have volunteered to be a part of that effort.

Recent political campaigns poor examples of democracy 
I still remember the first 
time I saw the poster. 
I was a sophomore at the University of Colorado, and I was helping to organize a voter registration drive in Boulder. The posters we were hanging up around 

campus depicted a scene from South Africa. In it a L. Peter Yob group of protestors, most of Assistant News Editor them black, were fleeing 
from a gang of police in 
riot gear. 
The police wielded billy clubs. The fear on the fleeing protestors' faces was visible. Tear gas filled the background. 
The caption on the poster was simple, direct, and to the point. "You've got something other people are dying to have," it read: "Register and vote." 
The message is a powerful reminder of how lucky we are to live in a democracy. We need to remember that Chinese students bravely stood in the path of tanks and murdering soldiers in an effort to achieve democracy. Palestinians are killed daily be­cause of their effort to achieve full political and human rights. 
In these and other notable struggles for freedom around the world, the United States is often held out as the ideal, the ultimate democracy. 
For the U.S. elections this Tuesday, however, there have been predictions of a record-low voter turnout. We Americans are proud of our democracy and

saying in its endorsement that "We're kind of hoping that !Hoerner] is going to come out somewhere other than what he's saying." 
lliler said that the two things he has to offer the voters of In­diana's 3rd district are his consistency and his "fairly 
democratic heritage, but when it comes to participation, many voters are noticeably absent. This ambivalence reflects a cynicism that is prevalent in today's election politics. 
Candidate Bush pledges not to raise taxes but later President Bush acknowledges that there is no choice but to do so. Congress allows itself free mailing privileges and refuses to set spending limits on campaigns, guaranteeing an incumbent reelection rate of at least 95 percent. 
Racist attitudes are reflected in campaign tactics. In 1988 Candidate Bush appealed to fear of minority crime in his Willie Horton ads. 
Senator Jesse Helms is currently in a close reelec­tion campaign with Harvey Gantt, who is the former mayor of Charlotte and who happens to be black. Helms has, in the last week, run television ads that ask the audience how they would feel if they didn't get a job because it was given to a less qualified mi­nority. The ad goes on to say that Gantt supports quotas. The message: vote for the candidate who will support white interests. 
Negative election tactics on the national level are now filtering down to the local level. It's hard to be­lieve how low the advertisements have sunk in local races for Congress, Secretary of State, and even for state senate and the sheriff's race. 
If you believe recent television ads, every candidate is connected to a savings and loan and wants to needlessly raise taxes. As election day approaches, ads become more negative. 
The informational value of election ads are mini­mal. They leave the public with a distorted view of the issues. When neither candidate is appealing to voters, what should the expectation be? 
The answer is a low turnout. 
This Tuesday I am not voting in any election race. Part of this stems from the fact that I am a resident of Colorado. If voting is unattractive, then absentee voting is even less attractive. 
I am not suggesting that people should not vote. That is a personal choice that each individual must make. 
Sometimes I reflect on the poster of the South Africans. I think of the people around the world who would give their lives for the chance that their chil­dren will someday live in a democracy. 
Then later I'll see a commercial depicting a candi­date's opponent flip-flopping between stances on abortion. I'll see a news report where a candidate asks if his opponent has stopped drinking. This cannot be the type of system those struggling for democracy expect. 
It's hard to be optimistic about the future of elec­tion politics in this country. This year witnessed an upsurge of public opinion against incumbents when they failed to e::tact a budget. When a budget was fi­nally passed, public opinion became complacent once again. 
Hope lies in the fact that someday public opinion will swell up against those who practice negative campaigning. Until then voter turnout will be low, and the public's cynical attitude toward our govern­ment will continue. 
well-defined" political philoso­phy. "I don't back down from it. I'm not afraid to debate it," he said. 
During the campaign, this consistency was attacked by Roemer's camp in a television commercial about Hiler's vote to repeal a catastrophic health bill which he had earlier voted for. The commercial featured a chicken crossing a road several times. The image of an indecisive chicken was the Democrats way of showing Hiler as unable to make up his mind on the issue. 
However, Hiler called the vote to repeal the bill "one of the best votes I've cast in 10 years." He said that he voted to repeal the bill after receiving 3,000 telephone calls and letters from senior citizens asking him to repeal it. "It is not my job as a member of Congress to shove down people's throats programs that they don't want and that truly are optional programs." 
Hiler says that being a par­ent (he has two daughters, ages 4 and 3) also influences his voting. "When I talk about child care, it's not abstract." 
The one big difference be­tween Roemer and Hiler, ac­cording to Hiler, is that fact that Roemer believes that gov­ernment can do more than Hiler believes it can. Hiler called himself someone who does not think that "government knows how to do everything better than every­body else. I have voted to put control back in the hands of people, because I am con­vinced that that is where we find a lot of solutions." 
John Hiler is also optimistic in one final regard-he is con­fident about Tuesday's election. "It will be close. but I'm confident we will be on top."

Roemer depends on value-oriented supporters 

EDITORIAL 

Vote Roemer 
The race for Indiana's 3rd district Congressional seat has been so dirty and so filled with negative cam­paigning that endorsing a candidate requires us to frrst dig through a pile of well-slung mud. 
After sorting through all of the allegations and scathing advertisements, we endorse Tim Roemer over incumbent John Hiler to represent the 3rd district in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Roemer is running on a platform that is filled with many good ideas. 
He feels strongly about education and considers se­curin~ a seat on the House Education and Labor committee a top priority. In addition, he proposes to stop illegal drugs through both tougher enforcement and funding of education and rehabilitation pro~ams. 
However, his ideas have been mostly theoretical and he has offered few concrete solutions. In order to be an effective Representative, he must convert these ideas into action, producing tangible results from his theories. 
We favor Roemer because Hiler has offered few new ideas and appears satisfied with the current state of government. 
He voted against the recently passed federal budget because it raised taxes significantly. He also believes that there is little more the government can do to better the lives of its citizens. 
We find Hiler too complacent to be effective any longer. Tou~h economic times are on the horizon. John Hiler and his old ideas will solve nothing in the face of these problems. 
One issue that both Roemer and Hiler can be criti­cized on is their campaigning. The candidates waged a bitter battle in print and on the airwaves and brought political campaigns in the district to an all-time low. 
The race became so dirty that the Today Show did a feature on it. This isn't the kind of behavior that the people of the 3rd district need to be known for. Both candidates should be chided for acting so petty and for embarrassing their "constituents" in front of the entire country. 
In addition, both candidates showed little interest in the voters of the ND/SMC community. While Roemer made a few campaign visits to Notre Dame, Hiler did not \lay an on-campus visit this fall. This is strange considering Hiler won the 1986 election by a mere 4 7 votes. 
As another close election is predicted, we urge all registered voters to vote and to remember Tim Roemer asyou do so. As 1986 proved, our votes can make a difference. 
Secondly, Tim Roemer sup­ports programs which put his values into practice in a pro­active way. He has a firm belief that "Congress should work for the people, not for the congressman." This conviction is evident in several of Tim's policy recommendations. Education is one area in which major improvement is needed. Tim 
By Mary Ritter 
For the past four months, I have been working on the Hiler campaign as the student liaison. During this time, I have gotten to know Congressman John Hiler and his views on a wide range of issues. Hiler is a very effective representative and provides strong leadership for the Third District of Indiana. I support Congressman Hiler's efforts in Congress, especially his views on education, the environment and foreign affairs. 
One of Congressman John Hiler's main priorities is the children of the United States. He .is sincerely dedicated to revitalizing our education system. Congressman Hiler is aware that we need many improvements and changes in our education system in order to greater benefit future generations. 
A very important point Congressman Hiler makes about education is the need to get more out of our education dollar. Spending for education in this country has risen significantly over the past decade, but student achievement has not. Therefore, the Congressman has endorsed several different proposals aimed at fostering needed reforms in our educational system. 
Hiler supports the concept of school of "choice"--giving parents the ability to choose the school their child will attend. If parents do not feel satisfied with their local school, they should be able to place their children in a different one. Choice makes the school accountable to the student. It has also been shown to improve the academic achievement of students and increase parental involvement in education. 
Congressman Hiler has co­sponsored bills that face the problems of illiteracy, school dropouts and school-based drug abuse. The Congressman's devotion to level of education, including the Head Start Program which helps educate minority, under­privileged children before kindergarten. He also believes that college loans should be­come more accessible, not more restricted. Tim believes in affordable health care for all and a sound environmental policy that favors the development of a program 
education is especially inspiring to me as a student. In my high school years, the problems of education were very recognizable. I support the fact that he is working so hard to provide improved educational programs that work in our society. 
Congressman Hiler is also committed to the environmental problems confronting the United States as we move into the 1990s. He recognizes that the United States will require high conservation and wise management of our natural resources. 
Hiler feels that groundwater protection must be a top environmental priority for Congress. He has supported legislation that has had direct impact on groundwater protection and has worked with Indiana's local communities on protecting their groundwater. 
Along with groundwater protection, Congressman Hiler also has taken firm action to reform our nation's solid waste laws. Everyone is aware of the shortage of landfill space. This problem is especially pertinent to Indiana since it is estimated that this state's landfills have only eight years of useful life left. Therefore, Hiler has introduced his own bill and co­sponsored many pieces of legislation to address this problem. His own bill focused on states having the right to ban or place an additional fee on out of state solid waste that is transported across state lines. He has also supported recycling legislation and bills that call for a reduction in the generation of hazardous wastes. 
Groundwater protection and hazardous waste are matters that Hiler acts on for the good of Indiana and betterment of the United States. Hiler also has supported clean air laws and oil-spill liability legislation. He is fighting for preservation of our environment, a battle that is important to our nation's alternative fuel research. 
Thirdly, John Hiler's record while he has served in Congress has been suspect, at best. First of all, he has served on the oversight committees for two of the major scandals in US history. He sat on the Housing Committee which was supposed to oversee the operations of HUD, but he also 
future. I feel Congressman Hiler's work on the environmental problems of our country gives citizens hope for cleaner cities, safer water and a non-polluted society. 
In the Middle East, Hiler supports the troops for the defense of Saudi Arabia, the current United States policy. He believes that the United States has to work with the United Nations to secure world-wide support. Hiler is hopeful for a diplomatic solution and would like to avoid a long standoff. But the major point in Hiler's stand is public and international approval of the United States' actions. He believes this to be essential if we are to resolve this crisis. 
I find Hiler's views of this situation to be comforting in the sense that he believes the United States should work along with the United Nations and not be the sole power in this conflict. It is very important for people to view the crisis as a world conflict and not as the United States against Iraq. I also agree with Hiler's point that the conflict can be resolved without military action. Diplomatic relations need to be involved to avoid an outbreak of war; however, troops in Saudi Arabia are necessary because of the uncertainty of the situation and must be maintained to let Iraq know that we are serious. 
When I think about the hostages in Iraq and the troops in Saudi Arabia, I feel more assured that we are under the strong leadership of John Hiler. It is important that the United States remain powerful and cooperative in the international spectrum. Congressman Hiler recognizes the importance of international relations to the American public and is willing to make tough decisions for the defense of our nation. 
I have talked about three main reasons why I am

By Christopher Coury 

The 1980s was a lost decade. The values which made America great were forgotten. Trickle-down economics enabled the wealthy to gain greatly, while the middle and lower classes paid dearly. Our competitive­ness also declined in a major way, as we became a debtor nation for the first time in his­tory. Promises of fiscal control and a balanced budget were forgotten as the United States ran up the largest deficit and national debt in the history of the modern world. 
Our education system continued to decline, and the drug problem erupted into the limelight. Hundreds of thousands of people saw their decent-paying professions disappear and were forced instead to take jobs which paid three to four times less. 
The HUD and Savings and Loan scandals, some of the most despicable in our nation's history, made headlines daily. And, feeling justified by all of these noble accomplishments, congressmen rewarded themselves by voting to double their salaries. 
Tim Roemer believes that this is the time for action. For the United States to return to the greatness it once held, changes are necessary--both in the leadership of the country and in the direction of 
U.S. policies. Tim is confident that he can re-introduce values and the middle-class perspective as the congressman from Indiana's Third District. 
There are four reasons, in particular, why Tim Roemer is the stronger candidate in the Nov. 6 election. 
First of all, Tim Roemer un­derstands both Hoosier and Notre Dame values. Contrary to his opponent's television commercials, Tim is not a stranger to Indiana's Third District. He was born in South Bend and raised in Mishawaka. Also, he has had a close relationship to Notre Dame. Tim earned both his Masters and Doctorate in International Relations here and lived as an assistant rector in Grace Hall for two years. In addition, while working as a Defense and Trade Advisor in the U.S. Senate and during this congressional campaign, Tim has always been eager to talk with and help Domers--whether meeting with students on the Washington Seminar, running as a part of the Grace Hall 24­Hour run or speaking on campus several times a year. 
Tim Roemer contends that the only way our government can improve is through the dedication of value-oriented people, such as those who attend Notre Dame. He has never hesitated in helping Domers, and as a Congressman, he could provide a greater service to us, his constituents.

Wakiihuri and Panfil victorious in humid NYC marathon 
NEW YORK (AP) -Foreigners continued their domination of the New York City Marathon but the winners weren't Juma Ikangaa or Grete Waitz. 
Douglas Wakiihuri, a Kenyan who trains in Japan, was the overall winner and Poland's Wanda Panfil. who lives in Mexico, was the women's win­ner in Sunday's race which was plagued by heat and humidity. 
It was the third straight marathon victory for each. 
Ikangaa, who had captivated New Yorkers last year by win­ning in course-record time, and Waitz, who had won the race an astonishing nine times, both wound up fourth in their re­spective divisions. 
For Waitz, the result was dif­ferent than anything she had experienced in New York. It was the first time she had fin­ished the race without winning. Nevertheless, she was not disappointed.

tant to finish, because of all 
the circumstances with this 
race," she said. 
This was her first marathon in two years and she was run­ning for Fred Lebow, the race director who was diagnosed in February with brain cancer. 
"It shows I can be competi­tive again,' Waitz said. "But to be competitive at this level of marathoning, I need more than three months of training." Since Waitz, of Norway, ran the marathon for the first time in 1978, no American has won 
. the women's division. The last 
American women's champion 
was Miki Gorman in 1977. 
The last American men's win­ner was Alberto Salazar in 1982, when he took the title for the third time. 
Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., finished second among the women for the second straight year, five seconds behind Panfil to make it the closest finish in the race's 21-year history. 
Panfil was timed in 2 hours, 30 minutes, 45 seconds, Jones in 2:30:50. It was the slowest winning women's time since Waitz's 2:32:30 in 1978. 
Wakiihuri, who bolted away at 20 miles, clocked 2:12:39, the slowest since Orlando Pizzolato ofltaly won in 2:14:53 in 1984, when the temperature reached 79 degrees, the hottest in race history. 
Sunday, the temperature got as high as 72 degrees and the humidity peaked at 66 percent. Ken Martin of Dallas, the runner-up last year, failed to finish this time. Bothered by a virus for the past two months, he dropped out after 19 miles . 
The first American finisher was Gerry O'Hara, a 26-year­old New Yorker who was 29th in 2:26:15. Mohamed ldris of Brooklyn, N.Y., who finished 22nd in 2:22:23, originally was announced as the top American, but race officials later determined he was an Egyptian citizen. 
It was Wakiihuri's first marathon in the United States and the third for Panfil, who did not finish the '88 New York City Marathon, after falling near the 16-mile mark and suf-

After staying with the lead pack for the first 20 miles, the cool, composed Wakiihuri took control and pulled away to a 40-second victory over Salvador Garcia of Mexico, winner of the '89 New Jersey Waterfront Marathon. 
Garcia said he suffered blis­ters on both feet about halfway through the race. Otherwise, he said he thought could have beaten Wakiihuri. 
Wakiihuri, however, appeared very strong. 
"When I broke away, I knew I was feeling good," he said. "Up to 20 miles, I was not running so hard. I was just relaxing. 
"I wasn't expecting anyone to come with me. If I was leading by 20 miles, I knew they couldn't keep up with me.." 
Waitz, 37, running the marathon for the first time in two years, because of injuries, including a stress fracture of the pelvis and a lower back strain, struggled to finish fourth in 2:34:34.

the next 15 plays, the last being a one-yard run by freshman fullback Jerome Bettis for the first touchdown of his Notre Dame career. 
The Midshipmen came right back. Quarterback Alton Griz­zard passed 44 yards to tight end Dave Berghult to the Notre Dame 12. After Navy drove to the one-yard line, the Irish stopped the Middies four straight time, only to have out­side linebacker Devon McDonald draw a pass interference call on fourth down in the endzone. Two plays later Jason Pace tied the game at seven with a one­yard touchdown run. 
The Irish and Midshipmen then traded field goals on long drives and went into the locker room tied at 10.

"We expected them to try something," admitted Lane. "We just kept our responsibili­ties on that play -they had al­ready surprised us with the wishbone. "At halftime, we just felt like we had to come out and establish ourselves on defense. We wanted to give our offense a chance to do something." What adjustments did the Irish make after their halftime wake­up call? 
"We got our assignments back," said Williams. "We had to all be sure who had the quarterback and who had the pitch man. Still, I'm not at all pleased. I'm only pleased that it was a win." 
Yet the Irish defense made one key adjustment that had to be made regardless of the Navy wishbone. 
The Notre Dame defensive corps adjusted to the absence of Outland and Lombardi Trophy candidate Chris Zorich. 
Sophomore Eric Jones, who played the entire game at nose tackle, notched six solo tackles and one assisted tackle, result­ing in six lost yards for Navy. 
"Starting was enjoyable," confessed Jones. "I still have some things to work on -I need to improve the fundamentals and keep learning. I just made sure I held my gap and helped

with, and we would just have to be productive with it each time," Holtz said. 
Notre Dame did just that, scoring three touchdowns in the first 10 minutes of the second half to take a 31-10 lead. Fullback Rodney Culver started the onslaught with a seven-yard touchdown run, tailback Ricky Watters kept it going with a two­yard dive into the endzone and quarterback Rick Mirer capped it with a 30-yard scramble to paydirt when he couldn't find an open receiver. 
Navy did not roll over and die at that point, but every time the Middies scored, the Irish an­swered. Grizzard, who finished the game with 93 yards on 18 carries, scored late in the third quarter on a six-yard keeper, but Notre Dame countered with a seven-play, 48-yard drive which culminated in tailback Tony Brooks' three-yard touchdown run. Navy struck again with 3:46 left 
out on the tackles. Right now, we've just got to get ready for Tennessee." 
Lane, however, shared Williams' dissatisfaction. ''I'm not satisfied at all," la­mented Lane. "We [the defense] did not play well at all -we certainly did not play to our capabilities. We were frustrated with ourselves." Luckily, perhaps, for the Irish, such frustration was not characteristic of their perfor­mance on offense. 
"I though we did a good job," said tight end Derek Brown. "We scored 52 points and we didn't have to punt once. We won, too, so that helps us. We were waiting to get out on the

in the game on a 19-yard pass from Grizzard to Berghult, but Notre Dame countered just 1:32 later on a 54-yard pass from Mirer to Ismail. Finally, the Middies scored with 16 seconds left on a seven-yard pass from Grizzard to William Mason, but on the ensuing kickoff the Irish had the last word when Todd Lyght returned the onside kick 53 yards down the right side­line for the final margin of 52­31. 
Holtz was unhappy with the play of his defense, but said he could not evaluate the nature of his squad's troubles until he saw the game films. He would not allow that the loss of All­American Chris Zorich (knee injury) was the only reason for Notre Dame's defensive woes. 
"You can't lose an individual like Zorich and not feel the ef­fect of it, but it shouldn't have had that big of an impact. Navy just did an excellent job," Holtz said. 
field -we didn't really touch the ball in the first half." 
Given the fact that the Irish moved the ball well, but had difficulty stopping the Navy at­tack, it should come as no sur­prise that the Irish gave a sober assessment of how they must prepare for Tennessee. "We just need to work on the fundamentals and get better," said Lane, summing up the sentiments of the entire de­fense. 
"We need to do work all around," noted Brown. "We need to work on everything ­running, pass blocking, screens, draws -all of those things.

Th1s space prov1ded as a public serv1ce 
The AFC Central and West races 
tightened Sunday as division 
leaders Cincinnati and the Los 
Angeles Raiders stumbled 
offensively, scoring only a 
touchdown apiece. 
The Kansas City Chiefs (5-3) pulled within a game of the Haiders (6-2) Sunday behind three field goals by Nick Lowery and an aggressive defense that used bad weather to its advantage. 
"The weather conditions were such that we droppped some passes that we normally would have caught," Haiders coach Art Shell said. "Nobody could open up the offense." 
Lowery's third kick, a 41­yarder, came 3:02 into the fourth quarter, exactly three minutes after Steve Smith had gone in from the 2 for the only touchdown of the game, giving the Raiders a 7-6 lead. 
Craig Heyward and Rueben Mayes each rushed for 100 yards as the New Orleans Saints spoiled Cincinnati's long­awaited homecoming with a 21­7 victory. 
The Saints (3-5) simply over­powerr.d the Bengals' defense ­statistically the second-worst in the NFL -while running them out of their first home game in six weeks. The loss dropped the Bengals into a tie for first in the AFC Central. 
"I don't think I've ever felt this low as a professional athlete," said quarterback Boomer Esiason. who completed only 15 of 32 passes for 132 yards. "Today it's right on my shoul­ders. I feel that if I play 10 per­cent better than I did, we prob­ably win the game. I have no excuses." 
In other NFL games, it was Pittsburgh 21, Atlanta 9; New York Jets 24, Dallas 9; Philadelphia 48, New England 20; Miami 23, Phoenix 3; San Francisco 24, Green Bay 20; and Washington 41, Detroit 38 in overtime. 
In late afternoon games, it was Buffalo at Cleveland; Chicago at Tampa Bay; Houston at Los Angeles Rams and San Diego at Seattle. Denver was at Minnesota in a night game and the New York Giants play at Indianapolis on Monday night. 
The Chiefs beat the RaidePs despite generating almost no offense. Kansas City totaled minus-1 yard in the first quar­ter, when Lowery kicked 36­and 48-yard field goals follow­ing a blocked punt and a fumble recovery, and the Chiefs had just 67 yards in the first three periods. 
The Raiders, meanwhile, never advanced beyond the Kansas City 44 until late in the third quarter as both teams seemed bothered by the 20-degree wind chill and occasional rain and sleet and cornerbacks Albert

consistently  thwarted  Jay

cepted twice in the second half.

Miami won its fifth consecutive game, using its ball-control offense the NFL's top-ranked defense to rout Phoenix.

Eagles 48, Patriots 20 
Randall Cunningham threw four touchdown passes and scrambled for 124 yards and Heath Sherman rushed for 113 more as Philadelphia reached the .500 mark for the first time this season by defeating New England.

Women's swim team sets records
Men swimmers beat 
MCC over weekend 
By BECKY WOOD 
Sports Writer 
The Irish men's swim team proved their dominance of the MCC Conference this past weekend in the Notre Dame Relay meet on Friday and the MCC Dual Meet Saturday. The men won all meets against St. Louis, Loyola, Xavier, Butler and Evansville and captured firsts in all but two events in three swimming sessions. 
The back to back racing ses­sions took place in a little more than 24 hours. 
"That is both very challenging and very good preparation for the championships that are ahead," said Notre Dame coach Tim Welsh. 
They are also a sign of "a team that is preparing itself to step up to a higher level of per­formance," emphasized Welsh. 
In the relay meet the Irish won 12 of 13 events, setting two records and coming within seconds of breaking three other swimming records, two held by powerhouse Texas Christian. David Nathe, Chuck Smith, Greg Cornick and Jim Birmingham swam on the 400 freestyle relay in a record time of 3:12.43. Junior Pat Dugan and freshmen Sean Hyer also teamed together for the 3-Me­ter Diving relay with a record winning score of 401.80. 
"This was a fun meet for them in that it is a relay. They only have to do half of their dives. This takes a lot of pres­sure off them," said diving coach Tracey Brennan. "If we continue to dive at this level we should be in top form by the championship meets." 
The Irish continued demon­strating their depth and power in the Dual Meet Saturday. Of 20 events Notre Dame won all but one. The men maintained a high performance level throughout the meet, including the last event, the 400 free re­lay. 
Although the meet was won and the swimmers were swim­ming in their sixth or seventh event of the day, the Irish fin­ished strong. Chuck Smith an­chored the men's relay in 47.9, his fastest swim of the meet. Smith's performances were solid, and a high level of condi­tioning showed in his third place finish in an off event, the 100 breaststroke .

Other strong races were swum by sophomore Greg Cor­nick and freshman Dave Nathe. Both were double winners. Paul Godfrey and Jim Birmingham recorded wins in

the 200 backstroke and 50 free respectively, while Colin Cooley and Roger Rand took first and second in the 200 breaststroke. Sean Hyer also captured a first in the 1-Meter diving. 
Joe Rentz led an Irish pack of flyers, Paul Godfrey, Ed Broder­ick, Jim Byrne, Brian Casey and Jim Boutrous, to a first-sixth placing in the 200 butterfly. The Irish also claimed first­sixth places in the 500 free. Overall the Irish men had a very strong meet. 
Coach Welsh spoke of the MCC Dual Meet as a "colossal scrimmage {if you compare it with other sports). However, unlike a scrimmage, the day ends with almost 60 different dual meet scores." 
Welsh attributed the success of the MCC Dual Meet to the "magnificent work support" of the Sports Information Office. 
"This meet is actually bigger in number of swims and num­ber of swimmers than the MCC Conference Meet will be in February," said Welsh.

The women's swim team successfully completed a challenging weekend of racing this past Friday and Saturday in the Notre Dame Relays and MCC Dual Meet that were both held at Rolfs Aquatic Center. Notre Dame led the scoring in meets against St. Louis, Butler, Xavier, Evansville, Illinois-Chicago and St. Mary's. 
The women claimed 10 of 13 relay events on Friday night and broke three records, two of which were held by powerhouse Texas Christian. Shannah Mather, Kay Broderick, Amy Tri and Tanya Williams broke the existing 400 individual medley record by almost five seconds with a time of 4:15.89. 
Kristin Heath, Kathleen McKinney, Karen Keeley and Alicia Feehery swam a record time of 8:05.2 in the 800 freestyle relay, and Beth Winkowski, Keeley, Chrissy Ciletti and Christy Van Patten improved the Notre Dame 400 Butterfly Relay meet record with a time of 4:16.02. 
Wrapping up the relay meet for the Irish, Jennifer Stumm and Jennifer Kipp joined to win the 3-Meter Diving and came within five points of the record held by Illinois­Chicago. 
On Saturday, the Irish com­pleted their last two of three racing legs, all of which were swum in a little more than 24 hours. 
The 400 free relay, the last event, showed the Irish power, depth and perfor­mance level. Although all meets were won and all swimmers were swimming in their sixth or seventh event of the day, the Irish maintained their competitive edge. 
Freshman Alicia Feehery capped an impressive week­end performance by anchor­ing the women's relay in her fastest 100 in the meet, 52.7. 
The Irish women raced ag­gressively, winning 19 of the 20 events. Notre Dame captured many top places and claimed all but one of the first nine places in the 200 Individual Medley. Heath, Tri, Christy Moston, Keeley, and Colette LaForce took places one through five. 
Williams, a native of Boca Raton, Fla., swam her fastest 200 backstroke at Notre Dame and set a university record, 2:08.97. Williams also won the 500 free and 100 breaststroke. Heath, a freshmen, recorded triple wins for the Irish, winning the 200 individual medley, 200 breaststroke and 200 fly. Other strong performances included Susan Bodhan and Shana Stephens who earned firsts in the 1000 free, and 200 back, respectively. Tri had a good meet, taking sec­ond places in three events for the Irish. 
Kipp, Stumm, Angela Gugle and Vicki Catenacci, also sealed an event by winning the first four places in 3-Me­ter Diving. Kipp won both the 1-Meter and 3-Meter diving, scoring 259.87 points. Kipp broke the women's 1-Meter Diving record by over 10 points. The old record was set by Andrea Bonny in 1988. 
Kipp also qualified for the the NCAA Zone diving meet to be held in March.

ground in the early going. Navy (3-5), which had mixed the run and the pass with a two-back set for most of the season, sur­prised Irish coach Lou Holtz and created problems for Notre Dame's defense by running the wishbone. 
"(Navy coach) George Chaump had been throwing the ball all his career, and had been throwing it (this season) up until then, and we did not expect them to come out (in the wish­bone), although we did say that we could not allow them to run the football. We thought they would try to make it as short a game as possible," Holtz said. Navy controlled the ball for 6:19 after the opening kickoff, driving to the Notre Dame 19 only to miss a 33-yard field goal. The Irish then ran the ball on 14 of

The Notre Dame wrestling team opened its season with a slam this weekend, winning the Michigan State Invitational in East Lansing. 
The Irish also won last year's tournament en route to finish­ing 7-8 on the season.This year, Notre Dame finished with 
74.75 points, besting Central Michigan (56.5), Boston Uni­versity (53.5), Michigan State (44.5), Ferris State (43.5) and Brockport State (30). The out­standing wrestlers of the tour­nament were Jon Zuccala (Ferris State, 118 lbs.) and Larry Luft (Central Michigan, 167 lbs.).

Irish adjust weak defense to Navy's 'new' wishbone 


EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. ­After dueling Navy to a 10-10 halftime tie, the Fighting Irish devastated the Midshipmen in the second half, scoring 42 points in an offensive broad­side. 
Navy, whose offense utilized a pro-1 formation for all but one half of the 1990 season, sur­prised the Irish by running the wishbone most of the after­noon. 
That bit of Midshipmen chi­canery, combined with the timely play calling of George Chaump and the execution of Alton Grizzard, kept the Navy offense on the field for 17:18 of the first half. 
"The wishbone was a big sur­prise," remarked Notre Dame defensive tackle George "Boo" Williams, who recorded four tackles on the day (two solo, two unassisted, minus four yards). "They haven't run that all year. You've got to respect them -they were tough.

knew we had to stop them. When their offense got into a rhythm, they were hard to stop; any offense is hard to stop once it gets its rhythm going. When we stopped them on their first series, we relaxed a little." 
On that first Navy possession, the Notre Dame defense held fast. Three Navy backs com­bined for nine yards, as the Middies faced fourth and one from their own 44 yard line. After a timeout, Navy's Dominic Flis took a fake punt to the
