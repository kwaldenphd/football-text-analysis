During his flight here from Rome, the pope entered the cockpit of the Alitalia OC-10 to l:hat briefly with President Carter over a crackling radio circuit, The pontiff greeted Carter as the plane flew over Puerto Rico, but the conversation was cut off because of poor connections, Vatican officials accompanying the pope reported. 
At 12:40 p.m. EST, the pope stepped from the door of the jetliner, smiled and spread his arms wide as he walked down the steps of the plane onto this Caribbean island. 
"The pope wants his mission to be one of spreading the gospel. That is why I decided to arrive here followmg the route that, at the time of the discovery of the

Grace Hall resident suffers extensive loss in stereo theft 
by Tim joyce StaffReporter 

Stereo equipment totalling $3,200 has been reported mis­sing from a student's room in Grace Hall, the result of an apparent burglary during sem­ester break. The incident is currently under investigation by the Security Department. 
Joseph Wall, director of Se­curity, said yesterday that this was the only reported incident involving students' dorm rooms. There were, however, four reports of attempted bur­glary involving vending mach­
mes  in  other  buildings  on  
campus  during break.  
The  equipment  stolen  in  

Grace included a complete stereo system valued at over $2,500 and a pair of speakers, valed at approximately $700. The stereo system was not covered by the University's insurance policy. 
''When students bring to school stereo equipment, cam­

eras, televisions, etc. of that value, they should first make sure that it is covered by some sort of insurance policy, be it the University's or their own homeowner's policy," Wall commented. ''I urge all stu­dents to ~et insurance on items of value. ' 
Wall also mentioned that marking the items with one's driver's license number or social security number is a good idea. If there is a break-in, the items have a better chance of being returned to their owners if they are marked, he said. 
During break, the security department emrloyed between 12 and 15 hal monitors who were assigned to watch over the 
halls  24  hours  a  day.  In  
addition,  many  rectors  who  
remained  on  campus  during  

break also looked after their 
halls. 
The hall monitors' duty was 
to make complete tours of the 
dorms at least twice a day. The 
monitors checked the exterior 
of the dorms, making sure that 
all windows were secured, and 
all doors were locked. If a door 
was found unlocked, the moo· 
itor made a note of it, and 
locked the door, Wall 
explained. 
In addition to making secur­ity checks, the monitors were also instructed to be on the lookout for fire damage, or broken pipes. There was one incident of a broken pipe re­ported, Wall noted. 
"We were pretty lucky to have only one reported break-in during break. In comparison, Purdue University had over 35 reported break-ins," Wall con­cluded.

" Siems also expressed his thanks to all of the other students who have donated their time to help with the festival's planning. 
Siems' only concern for the upcoming festival is atten­dance. Last year's attendance was "good," but this year's chairman is hoping for an even better turnout. He was quick to emphasize that all events will be free and open to all students. 

It had been rumored that as many as 50 juniors had planned to attend the forum. McCurrie

WHC calls students to fast 
Dear Editor: 
It is once again the time of 
year when Notre Dame stu­
dents are asked to give up their 
Wednesday night meals m con­
junction wtth the Notre Dame­
Saint Mary's World Hunger 
Coalition's fasting program. 
The program consists of 
students signing a pledge sheet 
whereby a large percentage of 
the cost of the faster's 
Wednesday night meal goes to 
the Hunger Coalition. The 
funds attained from the fasting 
program comprise the majority 
of the money collected yearly by 
the Hunger Coalition. This 
money is dispersed to groups 
and agencies throughout the 
world which try to obliterate 
hunger. 
The fasting program, which has been in existence at Notre Dame for several years, has been admired by many other groups from campuses across the United States. Last semes­ter several members of the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's World Hunger Coalition partici­pated in a workshop in Madison, Wisconsin. The work shop was sponsored by Bread for the World, the largest citizen's lobby group forhunger issues. Students from hunger related groups on campuses throughout the midwest partici­pated in the workshop. It became apparent to the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's students that the World Hunger Coali­tion is one of the largest and most active groups in the midwest. The fasting program 
at Notre Dame became a subject of discussion and envy ~mong the students represent­mg other campuses. 
Although it is nice for the Hunger Coalition to have a pat on the back, it cannot be considered such when the number of fasters drops tre­mendously each semester. Of course the major question is why. A few years ago when famine was a headline. issue and even the subject of a famous rock concert, .there were over a thousand (asters at Notre Dame. Hunger. is just as prevalent today as it was then but it often is only me.ntioned as one of a certain country's maoy problems. Vietnam, Cambodia, and Nicaragua are three exam­ples where·. famine ru~s rampant; yet, 10. the. press, thetr food problems become s.econ­dary to their political problem~. 
The fasung program ts designed to provide a response to the situation of hunger 10 our world today through' active participation in the pligh~ of millions daily. Please consider these millions of fellow men, women and. child.ien when the Hunger Coalition asks you to give up your Wednesday night meal. ·

P. 0. Box Q 
Another View of Sexual Equality 
Dear Editor: 
Mter reading Brian Hogan's article on sex and equality many times in order to be sure that he was serious in his statements, I feel it is necessary to clear up a few of the many mistaken assumptions and beliefs that stimulated Mr. Hogan to write it. I am directing this letter to him alone in the belief that his views among Notre Dame men. 
First of all, Mr. Hogan is correct when he states that sexual freedom is one aspect of full equality for women. What he obviously fails to understand, however, is that sexual freedom, for both men and women, means freedom of choice as to what one's sex life will be. This freedom should, ideally, free men and women from the stereo­typed sexual rolcrs that have predominated in the past and that have precluded the possibi­lity of mutual equality in male­female relationships. More importantly, this freedom includes the freedom to d~cide not to have sex within a love or dating relationship. Unfortu­nately, the fact that many Notre Dame women have interpreted and chosen to use their sexual freedom in this way is miscon­strued by Mr. Hogan as a holdover from Victorian morality. He has missed the entire process women have undergone and con­tinues to believe that by discard­ing her virginity, a woman can gam the respect of men as a mature equal. 
In addition, Mr. Hogan deplores the inability of some Notre Dame men to distinguish between love and sex--yet he himself is guilty of this very inability. This is most painfully evident when he points to the bedroom as the location of the "most im~rtant male-female interaction. ' Sex may be the most intimate male-female inter­action, but toassess its being the most important would lead me to believe that, in such a case, total interaction is definitely lacking substance. His misconception is again s..-en when we read another of his profundities which claims that "love without sex is defi­nitely the most boring.'' If Mr. Hogan truly believes this, I can only pity the fact that he does not understand how affection and 
love can be deeply cherished although sex is not a part of the 
relationshi~. 
The ulttmatum that Mr. Hogan finally presents to women is this: either take up an active sex life (which is synonomous for him with 'act like you're equal') or else never be taken seriously be anyone. It is precisely this attitude towards sex, this misin­terpretation of sexual freedom, that has frustrated and hampered understanding between men and women on the subject. 
When he tells women to realize that there are many dimensions to sex beyond that found in marriage, I feel compelled to remind him that he has a few things to realize as well. Brian Hogan obviously would deter­mine the optimum amount of sex for himself and others by consi­dering the trade-off between the 'fun' of sex and the danger of lowering his GPA that hyperacti­vity in sex would lead to. If this is the only dimension he can see in sex, I think we can well under­stand the many "Long, cold South Bend nights" Brian Hogan has endured. All I ask, Mr. Hogan, is that you don't blame those nights on the various moral inhibitions of Notre Dame women; you have only your own ignorance of the concepts of sex, love, and equality to blame.

Sexuality and Marriage 
Dear Editor: 
The article entitled "Sex and Equality'' has compelled me to present a perspective concerning human sexuality which was over­looked. Religious and doctrinal teachings should not be ignored. However, the quality of the article leads me to believe that there is another ground on which the author will be more likely reached, namely, the element of trust. 
Trust, as it pertains to love, can be succinctly defined as loyalty or commitment to another. For two to feel comfortable sharing any­thing of value, an element of trust must exist which is at ~east proportional to that which is being shared. It follows from this that since sex derives its great value from its being a profound expression of love, trust is an essential ingredient. Further­more, it should be the concern of the individuals that such a trust 
be  cultivated  prior doing  any­ 
thing  which  assumes  its  pre­ 
sence.  

Marriage, if it is to be taken at all seriously, assumes that those involved will remain loyal to their spouse throughout life. In a society such as ours where un­faithfulness to the bonds of marriage is becoming increas­ingly accepted, if not encour­aged, a deep trust based on the actions of the individuals prior to marriage is of great importance. Having discussed this with two clinical psychologists and three marriaEe counselors, though I am myself unmarried, I found It to be a point of consensus that in many cases there exists a link between non-commital extramarital sex and the pangs of mistrust and uncertainly which may enter into a relationship over a period of time. The pronounced rise in the number of divorces, an increas­ing number of which are being filed on the grounds of suspected or proven infidelities, supports this association. 
When the romance of a mar­riage dies out and the faults of 'the partners become more ap­parent, as is indeed the case at one time or another, the question "If he (or she) was willing to engage in sex outside of marnage before, what is going to keep htm (or her) from doing so now?" must be answered.

Lettets.to a Lonely God 
A beginning to the end 
This colwnn is really a Com­mencement speech addressed to the Seniors. Probably it should wait until May, to take its place among the other addresses of the Conunencement. Seniors, however, have VIPs talking to them at their graduation; my simple words would get lost among the official rhetoric. The words imponant to me, or I wouldn't bother to wme them. I hope you can believe them, because they could be of help. 
I feel very close to a lot of Seniors. For the past ftve years, I have spent a great deal of time trying to be in touch with the Seniors off-campus. I have been anxious to talk to you and visit Your houses; I want you· to be guests at my table whenever I can affontto play host. I write letters invitin~ you, or asking you to invite me, for a visit. In the past three 
years, I have written to nearly every
off-campus Senior; by Mar, I hope to 
have written letters to al of you again this year. By now, I know how well, how efficiently, how pleasurably, how thrift­ily, how fraternally, the off-campus Seniors live. I mention all this so that 
you will understand that you Seniors are people I care about. Now you are beginning your fmal semester, possibly for some of you the 
best semester of your years at Notre Dame. I hope you will enjoy the rituals ofacceptance or rejection at professional 
school; the job interviews; the chalets and cottages at Lake Michigan; the evenings spent nursirig a dry throat at the Senior Bar; the prom at the hotel in Chicago; the thousand dates, the million beers; and the concluding celebrations in Senior week, when the ftnal exam has been written, and the fmal footnote has been researched. 
Before you move home to Penh Amboy or Lansing, may I suggest that, as a way of divorcing yourselves from deceptions, you burn all your T-shirts that say God made Notre Dame Number One? The phrase is silly, offensive, and dangerous; and it is not true; most of the time, not even in spons. Even when it's true that "We're Number One", it doesn' r mean that ''l'in Number One." As you must know by· now, graduation means separating /ourself from the general_ excellence o the U~versity and depending on your own particular excel­lence, no matter how limited you feel it to be. Graduation can leave you feeling a long way off from the football ftelds of Dallas, where other chaps were out there making the touchdowns that earned us a communal glory. It may take you years, or a lifetime, before you make it to the Number One spot on your own. · Somewhere along the way, you may decide that being Number One simply isn't wonh the struggle. An ancient wisdom teaches us that success does not lie in gaining the whole world if the 

I, too, get the sad letters, the lonely letters: fdled with the depression new grads can have, feelin~ let down· by .the-, place they describe as 'the real world.'' On campus, as in Camelot, it seems, the ring of fellowship has been broken, ~d only briefly reassembled on cenam golden October days, when good friends and young lovelies return to the Dome for the football rituals. In a few lives, the sadness of the ftrst months following graduation amounts almost to a crisis; the phone calls come at midnight asking for help through the temporary tragedies as young men and women search for therr inner resources in the all-alone feeling of a pardise lost. 
Don't be surprised, after graduation, if a letdown comes in your own life, as part of your personal experience. ~ou are leavmg a wondrous place, separaung from a marvelous company of friends. Now, Notre Dame is wherever you are, wherever your friends are. It is not easy, at first, to be the center of your own world as a Domer, away from the green acres and the lakes, distant from the chums who drank with you in the bars and prayed with you at the Grotto. 
l.onelinesss is one of the earliest ways by which we learn that we are vulner­able, along with the rest of our generation, before we ever face sickness or experience death; it can only be redeemed by loving, and being loved; by caring, and being cared for; by having a friend, and being a friend. At Notre Dame, I think, you have learned the dynamics offriendship. Ifyou never had friends, there couldn't be a crisis at Conunencement-time, and no special loneliness at the breakup of the fellow­

whole world robs us of the our souls. Being Number One isn't imponant, even for a football team. What is imponant is that you be decent men and women, and that you be happy and at peace with yourself Happiness, for you, doesn't mean that you have to be the coach and players on a team that wins all the games. Happiness can mean watching the game from the bleachers it can mean sitting home, watching the game on television. It can mean never seei::tg the game at all, because you can't even afford a television~ 1t can mean knowing

IfNotre Dame is special, it is because you are here.

''We were always sure of two things at Notre Dame -one, that we would never discon­tinue making beds, and two, that Notre Dame would never admit women. Well, those are the two changes that occurred,'' Catherine Palatin, head maid in Flanner Hall, said. 
·Palatin, 62 years old, has worked at Notre Dame for over 21 years as a maid in several dorms. She has decided to 
retire the first of February. 
Palatin began working here in 
September, 1957 when she decided that she needed to be doing something with her spare 
time. "I never had worked before and I had no training for a technical job so I applied here because I needed the money," Palatin stated. 
Palatin began her work in Alumni and Fisher Halls. "I worked a half day in each hall and during the summer I travel -ed from dorm to dorm depend­ing on what they needed," Palatin explained.

they showed more discipline. There was no drinking allowed anywhere and no women were allowed in the dorms. Lights were turned out at 10 p.m. and residents had to sign in with the rector at 8 each morning," Palatin noted. Palatin said that the boys she has worked with have always been nice. She said that she enjoyed them because she had sons at home and was used to having boys around. Palatin said that the boys she has worked with have always been nice. She said that she 
Michael Molinelli 


After Alumni and Fisher, Palatin worked at Farley Hall for several years "I had one boy in Farley who always thanked me for dusting his room--one day he asked me if I even dusted his rosary beads that were hanging on his bed post," Palatin remembered. 
Another student who was Student Body Vice-President, 
lived  in  Farley  at  the  time,  
Palatin worked  there.  "He  
used  to  create  such  a  scene  

when I was around--he would walk down the hall and scream for me to go and clean up his room," Palatin said. 
Palatin transferred to Flanner Hall nine years ago when the dorm was built. She is responsible for most of the first floor, all of the second floor, the penthouse and a room in the basement. 
"One boy on the second floor here even calls me "mom"--he kids me about it and asks me what is for dinner and if he can bring someone home," she stated. 
Several residents of Flanner Hall will miss Palatin when she leaves. ''She is like a best friend to us--she comes in and clowns around with us. She certainly brightens up the day for all of us,'' Leroy Leopold, a junior, said. 
· Greg Besio and Dante Vacca agreed that Palatin is consider­ate of all of them. "She always asks us if 'we' mind if she 
sweeps the room" Besio noted. Another resident, Paul Kala­maras, stated that Palatin is so efficient that she even waxes the elevator doors. 
Palatin will retire from her job on February 2. She said that she has plenty at home to keep her busy. "I will miss being in Flanner, though, es­pecially visiting with the boys and the priests. The day goes much faster when you can talk with nice people during the day," she said.
