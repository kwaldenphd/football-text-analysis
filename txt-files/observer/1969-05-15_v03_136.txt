U.S. Jets bomb 20 mles from Saigon 
SAIGON (UPI) -Waves of U.S. 852 jets dropped up to 500 tons of bombs 20-30 miles northeast of Saigon Wednesday night in a 15 minute raid against jungle hideouts believed harboring 10,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong. 
The drop zone was in the same general area where U.S. troops hurled hack North Vietnamese infantrymen charging an American outpose and reported killing 36 in a predawn battle Wednesday. That fight was 45 miles north of Saigon. 
Radio Hanoi said the upsurge of fighting across South Vietnam was part of a "general offensive" which had badly mauled American troops. But American officials denied this, and said the new wave of attacks had cost North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces at least

Pollee shoot Honduran student rioters 
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (UPI) -Rifle carrying police yesterday opened fire on a student mob demonstrating outside the presidential palace against the visit of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York. One student was reported shot in the shoulder. 
Rockefeller, heading a team of experst on a Latin American fact finding mission for President Nixon, was inside the palace conferring with Honduran President Osvaldo Lopez Arellano at the time of the incident and was not aware of it his aides said. 
Police were hard pressed to contain the demonstrators because the university building is catercorner across the street from the palace. They charged the mob on several occasions and drove them back from the vicinity of the palace, but the demonstrators kept reforming and returning. 
City authorities rushed reinforcements to the palace area to cordon off the university into which mob leaders retreated when police resorted to gunfire. They continued to howl insults at

IS ANYBODY LISTENING 0 CAMPUS VIEWS? ,.\·r.ht~~ BUSINESSMEN ARE. ~ 
Three chief executive officers-The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's Chairman, Russell De Young, The Dow Chemical Company's President. 
. D. Doan, and Motorola's Chairman, Robert W. Galvin-are 
esponding to serious questions and viewpoints posed by students about business and its role in our changing society ... and from their perspective 
Mr. De Young: 

Dear Mr. DeYoung: 
"It is an extraordinary fact, that at a time when affluence is beginning to be the condition, or at least the potential condition of whole countries and regions, rather than of a few favorite individuals, and when scientific 
feats are becoming possible, 
which stagger mankind's wildest dreams of the past, more people in the world are suffering from hunger and want than ever before. Such a situation is so intolerable and so contrary to the best interest of all nations that it should use the determina­tion on the part of the advanced and developing countries alike to bring it to an end." 
This eloquent statement by the Secretary General of the United Nations points up a problem of which any informed citizen must certainly be aware. Corporations, also doubtless sense the magnitude of the disparity between the rich and the poor, between the thriving and the hungry. As the chief executive officer of a giant multi-national corporation, and as an individual who has had considerable working experience around the world, you have seen first-hand the wretched state of manl(ind referred to by Mr. Thant. 
At the same time, as Chairman of Goodyear, you are the one most responsible for the long-run maximization of stockholders' interests in the company. To that end, you have led Goodyear through a period of significant growth in sales and capital investment, most dramatically in areas outside the United States. 
In response to a rapidly growing marl(et for rubber goods abroad, more than 50% of Goodyear's capital expenditures during 1963-1967 were for expansion of international operations. Consider the earnings on total assets at home and abroad 
for the same period.

Had Goodyear International's return for 1967 been at the same percentage level as the home company's, foreign earnings would have been $12.5 million lower. 
Whether the countries where these operations are located have

Here. David G. Clark. a Liberal Arts graduate student at Stanford. is exploring a question with Mr . De Young. Administrative activities in Grer;ce and Austria, along with broadening experience in university administration, already have claimed Mr. Clark's attention and auger well a career in international affairs. 
In the course of the entire Dialogue Program, Mark Bookspan, a Chemistry major at Ohio State, also will exchange viewpoints wit! Mr. DeYoung; as will David M. Butler, in Electrical Engineering at Michigan State. and Stan Chess. Journalism, Cornell, with Mr. Doan; and similarly, Arthur M. Klebanoff. in Liberal Arts at 
Yale, and Arnold Shelby, Latin American Studies at Tulane, 
with Mr. Galvin. 


Can you justify foreign exploitation? 
gained as much as Goodyear has gained is questionable, especially so in the developing countries. Exploitation is, after all, nothing more than taking advantage of the favorable circumstances of another country which may lacl( capital and /or know-how while justifying to ourselves that it is in their best interest. Admittedly such undertakings do provide jobs, educational facilities, medical care, better clothing and shelter to employees and their families. But this gives rise to other questions. 
Are these direct benefits for a 
few people really enough? 
Where are the "above normal" 
foreign earnings going? 
What right do we as Americans 
and you as Goodyear have to 
take resources from another 
country for our own profit? 
What is Goodyear doing to help 
developing countries become 
economically viable and 
independent members of the 
world community? Is Goodyear 
doing anything to help build up 
indigenously owned businesses? 
Isn't it possible that several U.S. and other foreign firms operating in a small, developing country could become so centrally linked to the economic health of the country and hence to its financial base as to be able to strongly influence the composi­tion and style of its government? 
Mr. DeYoung, perhaps the 
fundamental issue i·n all these 
questions relates to the ever­
growing gap between the 
prospering and starving nations. 
Can American firms really justify their position in the developing countries when even the most conservative population biologists tell us that the world 
will be experiencing severe food shortages by 1980? Certainly firms investing abroad may expect a normal return on their investment, but when so many of the emerging nations are so desperately in need of resources for development in the broadest sense, are we really justified in tal(ing so much out from those countries for our own material aggrandizement? 
Sincerely, 


:0~,.~ 

David G. Clarl( 
Graduate Studies. Stanford 
Dear Mr. Clark: 
Whether measured by economic 
or social yardsticks, the direct 
results of most modern multi­
national corporate activities in 

the emerging nations is the 
fostering of progressive 

development-not exploitation 
under the outdated concepts of 
19th Century mercantilism. 
Any casting of accounts reveals 
that corporate policies, and their 
implementing operations, are 
focused toward growth within a 
country. There is also a realistic 
understanding that those 
operations can be the essential 
motivating force for any viable 
progress of the region. 
Essentially, the "in-put" is far 
greater than the outflow, 
all factors considered. 
This is clearly revealed from an economic perspective by the fiscal policy planning and profit position of many major companies abroad. As demon­strated by Goodyear's own position, we have repatriated considerably less than half of our foreign earnings over the past ten years. Conversely, more than half of our earnings have been re-invested abroad. This has been buttressed further by additional capital investment­both equity capital and long-term loans-in the emerging nations. 
Even with this continuing infusion of additional capital, coupled with re-investment, for the past three years, returns on capital investment in these areas still does not equal-let alone exceed-returns on domestic operations. 
This disparity is broadened further by the tax factor. Taking into account an overall tax rate abroad of some 40 per cent, as compared to the U.S. corporate tax rate of 52.8 per cent, foreign investment returns still are markedly less than in our domestic operations, notwith­standing the more favorable rate. 
Implicit to this picture is the posture of the major corporation abroad both in terms of its relationship to the hosting foreign government, and the effects of its operations on economic and social growth. Essentially operations are designed to establish a base for growth while meeting immediate local needs, disciplined by the realities of the profit-motivated free enterprise system. 
All of these Dialogues will appear in this publication, and other campus newspapers across the country, throughout this academic year. Campus comments are invited, and should be forwarded to Mr. DeYoung, Goodyear, Akron, Ohio,· Mr. Doan, Dow Chemical. Midland, Michigan; or Mr. Galvin. Motorola, Franklin Park, Illinois. as appropriate. 
In direct consequence the host-country's GNP is increased, tax revenues swelled, local manufacturing stimulated, local employment is expanded broadly with a wide range of new jobs, and local consumer needs satisfied-which is of crucial importance in conserving "hard-money"reserves or foreig exchange credits. 
Equally, the impact of these operations upon local living standards cannot be dismissed casually. For many it has meant the incredible step forward from 
"bare-survival"existence to a viable way of life. To an inordinate number this can be as basic as obtaining an adequate supply of potable water, treatment of diseases we've forgotten about in this country, sufficient food, and at least literacy level education. 
The dimensions of this picture are broadened further by the fac that an investment climate is generated that begins to attract other major enterprises to the area resulting in broader diversification. 
The simple truth is. Mr. Clark, that the modern multi-national corporation, disciplined by the profit and loss risk, is the only mechanism capable of creating, implementing and managing change. Accordingly it is throug its operations that rapid social and economic development will occur in the emerging nations. Don't you agree that its position is justified? 
Sincerely, 

~UA_rr
