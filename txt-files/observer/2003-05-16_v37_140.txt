Nothing lasts forever

would last forever and saved the last Editor Flex points of the Emeritus semester for candy at LaFortune. It's all part of our denial as we try to forget that we're about to be forced into a place where a down economy and war can affect us a little more harshly than it could while we were under the shad­ow of the Golden Dome. 
Four years passed by way too fast, but they didn't just happen passively. We participated in our college experi­ences and we learned things along the way. Whether changing majors, politi­cal views, life plans or significant oth­ers, change we did; and with each change we became a little more ready to face whatever it is we will do after Sunday. 
That's why it's alright that we're leav­ing-even if we've been ready for years or never wanted to go. Besides, commencement technically means beginning. not end. And even though we're supposedly starting over and moving on, we've picked up some things along the way -a few inside jokes, ridiculous SYR outfits, damning photographs and best friends. 
Though 22 years old feels ancient when reminiscing about our favorite episodes of "Saved by the Bell," Madonna songs and stirrup stretch pants, it is truly just the beginning. The decades ahead are guaranteed to be different, but that doesn't mean they have to be worse. In fact. post-grad life should be the fulfillment of what we've been working toward since the fall of 1999. Somewhere in between Rallies in the Alley, ResLife hearings, thesis research and road trips, we learned some useful stuff. We learned the stuff that makes Notre Dame students renowned for their compassion, hard work and spirit. . 
Although this week of lasts will cause tears and farewells, it also leads us to an endless number of firsts. So we'll remember Notre Dame for its tradi­tions, those that were here long before the class of 2003 and those we initiated ourselves. Because those traditions will be here-continuing to make Notre Dame the paradox of conventionalism and perpetual change that it's always been -while we go out and commence again.

Notre Dame awards nine figures with honorary degre.es 
Observer staff report 

Notre Dame will honor nine distinguished individu­als with honorary degrees, in addition to keynote speaker Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., at Saturday's Commencement ceremonies. 
Senator Lugar will receive an honorary doctor of 
laws degree, as will seven of the nine other recipi­
ents. 

Those honorees receiving doctor of laws degrees 
are: Kathleen Andrews, who is a member of the 
Board of Trustees, University fellow, and director of 
the Andrews McMeel Universal Foundation; Molly 
Broad, the president of the University of North 
Carolina; Roland Chamblee, a longtime South Bend 
family physician; Evelyn Hu-DeHart, professor of his­
tory at Brown University; Cardinal Oscar Maradiaga, 
archbishop of Tegucigalpa, Honduras and recog­
nized human rights activist; Anthony Scirica. a judge 
on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit 
and law professor at several law schools; and Raul 
Yzaguirre, a highly respected civil rights leader and 
president of the Hispanic organization National 
Council of La Raza. 

In addition, Allen Mandelbaum will receive an hon­
orary doctor of letters degree. Mandelbaum is inter­
nationally recognized as an authority on Dante and 
recipient of the National Book Award. 

An honorary doctor of engineering degree will be conferred upon Leslie Robertson, the lead structural engineer for the twin towers of the World Trade Center and internationally renowned expert in struc­tural design. 
"In giving honorary degrees, the University seeks to honor a variety of people who have distinguished themselves in their various fields or endeavors," Dennis Brown, a spokesman for the university, said. 
The selection of degree recipients is not as simple as it sounds. "Some people have worked with various members of the University in the past," said Brown. "But the common point is that they have all made significant achievements in their selected fields."

Senator will deliver speech 
By TERESA FRALISH 
Associate News Editor 
Senator Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) will deliver the commencement address to the Notre Dame Class of 2003 this Sunday. Lugar currently serves as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has been an Indiana senator since 1976. 
University offi­cials said that in light of recent events they chose Lugar, who will receive an hon­orary doctor of laws, as the speaker because of his expertise in the area of foreign affairs. 
Lugar. who previously served as chairman of the Senate Foreign 

weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union. More recently, Lugar has argued for the expansion of the Nunn-Lugar Program in other countries with weapons of mass destruction. 
As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Lugar has called on the president to provide more detailed information to Congress and the public about plan­ning for American involvement in. 
post-war Iraq. 
The senator also served as the mayor of Indianapolis from 1968-75 and oversaw the expansion of the city to include all of Marion County. After graduating from Denison University at the top of his class, Lugar received a Rhodes Scholarship for graduate study in politics, philosophy and eco­nomics at Oxford University. 
Lugar follows other commencement speakers who have been involved in politics and foreign affairs, such as President George Bush and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan who spoke in 2002 and 2001 respectively. 
However, some seniors were con­cerned that this year's commence­ment speaker was not as prestigious as previous speakers. 
"A lot of my friends and I were a little disappointed," said senior Kristin Baranack. 
Senior Matthew Teubner said he was not very familiar with Lugar but

Author to address graduates 
By ANNELIESE WOOLFORD Saint Mary's Editor 
Traveling from New York to Saint Mary's Saturday afternoon will seem like second nature 
to Adriana Trigiani. However, instead of returning to the campus for a visit or book signing, the author, screen­writer and director will speak to hun­dreds of graduating 

seniors. a position  Trlglanl  
she faced not long  
ago herself.  
Trigiani,  a  1981  alumna of the  

College, was selected as the 2003 com­mencement speaker in late March based on the request of students. 
While many students were unaware of Trigiani's nomination until after her appointment, seniors said they look forward to the insight she would pro­vide as an alumna. 
"Having a Saint Mary's grad send us forth into the world is more touching than having someone who isn't as close to us as she is," senior Emily Storer said. "Her relationship with the school and her experience can really put a better perspective on commencement than having someone else as a speak­er." 
The Saint Mary's graduate was a fea­tured author at Notre Dame's 2002 Sophomore Literary Festival, where students from both campuses had the chance to meet Trigiani and become acquainted with her work. 
Max Westler, English department chair and Trigiani's former professor, said he and Trigiani maintain the strong friendship they developed over 
20 years ago. Westler is extremely 
optimistic in Trigiani's ability to deliver 
a powerful message to the graduating 
class of 2003. 
"She'll have something to say to this 
graduating class that they're going to 
want to hear," he said. "She's 
absolutely thrilled to be coming." 
Trigiani 's charismatic personality and personal background with Saint Mary's and Notre Dame are reflected in her novels "Big Stone Gap," "Big Cherry Holler" and "Milk Glass Moon," making them popular among members of both communities. 
She visited the Saint Mary's campus for a book signing in 2000 after the publication of "Big Stone Gap," which will soon become a major motion pic­ture, both written and directed by the author. · 
In addition to her work as a writer, Trigiani's credentials include work as a television writer and producer, play­wright, comedian and documentary filmmaker. She has been involved with such television shows as "A Different World," "The Cosby Show," and "Good Sports." 
Additionally, she served as executive producer and head writer for the film show "City Kids" and comedy special "Growing Up Funny," which earned an Emmy nomination for actress Lily Tomlin and Lifetime Television. 
Trigiani wrote, produced and direct­ed "Queens of the Bigtime" in 1996, a documentary film about her family. The film won the Audience Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 1996 Hamptons International Film Festival and at the 1997 Paim Springs International Film Festival.

TIM KACMAR!The Observer Margaret Laracy, a psychology major from New Jersey, Is the 2003 Notre Dame valedictorian. 


Laracy named 2003 valedictorian 
By ANDREW THAGARD Assistant News Editor 
Her commitment to acade­mics may have earned her the honor of valedictorian, but classes are just one aspect of Margaret Laracy's experience at Notre Dame. The psychology major from Jersey City, N.J. has been active in community service and campus life. 
Laracy, who earned a 3.97 grade point average, made the Dean's List each semester. She is a member of the Phi Beta Kappa undergraduate honors society and Psi Chi, the national psychology honor society, and was named a National Merit Scholar. 
"It's an enormous honor," Laracy said, in reference to being named valedictorian. "I just think of all the amazing people I know at Notre Dame. I'm so excited to be addressing my class." 
Laracy is scheduled to deliver an address to the student body during Commencement Sunday. She said that her speech will focus on having courage in the face of recent national and international events, especially terrorism and war. She also intends to speak on the anxiety that is characteristic of the transition from college to the "real" world and the fear of not living up to others' expecta­tions. 
"I hope to encourage my classmates and myself to really live courageously," she said. "The main focus is not to be fearful." 
Laracy has worked to make the most out of her four years at Notre Dame, devoting her time to assisting in the Notre Dame Encounter Retreats, teaching English through a pro­gram at La Casa de Amistad, working at the Center for Social Concerns and studying abroad in Chile during her junior year. 
"It was really different than a lot of abroad experiences," she said of her semester in Chile. "I got the opportunity to not only 

i ~ live with a family but to do 
i 
L t 
some service in the community. I love Chile and the Chilean people. I could see myself going back to Latin America." 
Next year, Laracy will devote time to service, but it won't be in Chile. She plans to volunteer for at least a year through a L'Arche Community program, living in a house that assists people with special needs in Washington, D.C. 
"It's really an incredible com­munity that has a wonderful philosophy and spirituality," she said. 
Eventually, Laracy said she hopes to continue her educa­tion in psychology and use what she learns to help others. 
"I've always had an interest in working with other people," she said. "Academically it's very interesting to learn about [them)." 
Laracy, the first Domer in her family, was attracted to Notre Dame because of its sense of community and Catholic identi­ty. 
"I think that Notre Dame, among Catholic universities with a good academic program, really seems to value its Catholic identity," she said. "It wasn't just Catholic in name. It seemed like a perfect package for me." 
Notre Dame begins the selec­tion process for valedictorian in February when the Register's Oflice determines the two stu­dents in each college with the highest grade point averages. Selected candidates then com­plete an application process that includes a recommenda­tion from the college's dean and a peer and a draft of their commencement speech. A selection committee then nomi­nates a valedictorian and the second place candidate is invit­ed to deliver an invocation at graduation. 
This year, Meridith Runke, a science preprofessional studies major from Batavia, Ill. will deliver the Commencement invocation.

Robinson No.1 at Saint Mary's 
By EMILY BRAMMER News Writer 
Meghann Robinson said that she is not the type of 
student who spent all of her time studying in the library, but her love for her studies helped her to achieve a 4.0 grade point average and the title of Saint Mary's 2003 valedictorian. 
Graduating with a bachelor of arts in music and a minor in mathematics, Robinson will deliver the valedictory address at Commencement May 17. 
"I attribute much of my success to support from my family, especially my par­ents," said Robinson. "And I found something to study that I really enjoyed. When you study something that you love, it hardly seems like work sometimes." 
After graduation, Robinson will serve for The Alliance for Catholic Education, a two-year service program allowing college graduates to serve as full-time teachers in under-resourced Catholic schools across the southern United States in return for a tuition-free master of educa­tion degree from Notre Dame. 
Robinson will spend two summers studying at Notre Dame and two school years teaching in Nashville. She said she wants to keep her options open upon comple­tion of the ACE program, and considers pursuing graduate work in music theory. 
"I'm more interested in teaching than performing academic research, said Robinson. "I appreciate the value that Saint Mary's places on educating; and,

after benefiting from a school where the focus is on teaching, I realized that I also want to be an educator. But I don't want to just teach. I want to be good at it." 
Originally Robinson applied to Xavier University, University of Dayton, and Saint Mary's and Notre Dame -all Catholic univer­sities. But after visiting South Bend one summer, she finally made her decision to go to Saint Mary's. 
"I really wanted to attend a smaller school," she said. "One of the greatest aspects of the music department here is that it's so small, and as a result there are so many 
opportunities that I wouldn't have gotten elsewhere. If I could make the decision again, I'd definitely come to Saint Mary's." 
Robinson belonged to the Women's Choir and served as a member of the Choir Board. She was elected to represent the music depart­ment in the Student Academic Council her junior and senior year and volun­teered with Campus Ministry. 
Robinson grew up in West Chester, Ohio and attended Mount Notre Dame High School there.

Campus responds to terrorist attacks 
The campus responded in a dramatic fashion to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and rural Pennsylvania. 
Classes were cancelled mid-session as representatives from the registrar's office visited individual classrooms. Seven thousand students and faculty attended a mass on South Quad at 3 
p.m. on the day of the attacks, which was concelebrated by all campus priests and Auxiliary Bishop John D'Arcy. Throughout the day, students streamed to the grotto and students took advantage of free cab service to

donate blood. 

Phone lines and Internet connections at both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's were overwhelmed as students called home to check on their family and friends. . 
Like all athletic events nationwide, Notre Dame's football game against Purdue on the following Saturday was cancelled as the nation mourned the loss of thousands of citizens. At the September 22 home football game against Michigan State, the entire sta­dium paused as University President Father Edward Malloy said a prayer and fans raised printed American flags into the sky in an event televised nationwide by NBC Sports. 
Four alumni were killed in the attacks: Robert Ferris, class of 1962, who worked on the 102nd floor of the south tower of the World Trade Center; Army Lieutenant Colonel S. Neil Hyland Jr., class of 1977, who worked at the Pentagon; and Peter Batacan, class of 1983, and Dora Marie Menchaca, class of 1977. who were killed on American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon.

Sea ofGreen overtakes the Stadium. Assistant rector terminated. Saint Mary's security scandal. Boat gets bust-


By MEGHANNE DOWNES 
News Editor 
Sea of Green 
The winning enthusiasm and spir­it of the Sea of Green flooded Notre Dame last fall. Students, alumni and fans followed the Notre Dame foot­ball team as they returned glory to Notre Dame Stadium under Tyrone Willingham's guidance. 
At the beginning of the season. several sports analysts dismissed the team and Notre Dame entered many games as the underdog. But Willingham and his players made the Irish a force to be reckoned with and climbed the polls by win­ning their first eight games before falling to Catholic rival Boston College. 
Though the season was a roller coaster of emotions for many fans with careless fumbles, unexpected victories, losses to Boston College and USC, fluctuations in poll stand­ings and the possibility of a BCS berth, the spirit on football Saturdays and weekends did not disappear. Fans donned this year's green Return to Glory shirt and waved their green signs and foot­ball players wore green jerseys against Boston College as Willingham requested that the sea of green take the Stadium by storm. As enthusiasm for the season built up, students and fans took the Sea of Green on the road and followed the team to games against Michigan State and Florida State. 
As December approached, fans waited anxiously while praying that winter break would include a trip to Tempe, Ariz., Miami, Pasadena, Calif. or New Orleans. However, hopes of a BCS berth were dashed with late season losses. With the team headed to the Gator Bowl against North Carolina State, the spirit seemed to have run out, but loyal fans supported their team and cheered in Jacksonville, Fla. as Irish fell to North Carolina State 28-6.

questions for Pasquerilla West resi­dents and other assistant rectors who wondered about their job secu­rity. 
Sister Sue Bruno, Pasquerilla West rector, asked Phillips to leave in October. Though Bruno declined to comment, Phillips said she was removed after Bruno requested they have a "closer relationship." Phillips maintained she supported Bruno's leadership and never had a conflict with her. 
The Office of Residence Life for­mally removed Phillips as AR in November, following a series of meetings, but she retained her employee benefits. 
Phillips, a second year law stu­dent, was honored with the Distinguished Notre Dame Woman Award in April for her contributions to the Notre Dame and South Bend community. 
ResLife changed the AR contracts for next year after reviewing the events that occurred in the past academic year, said Bill Kirk, vice president for Student Affairs. The new contracts. which are renewed by semester and provide a more detailed definition of the AR's role, state that contracts may be termi­nated with or without cause and disputes between an AR and the University will be settled via arbi­tration. ARs who are terminated without cause will receive benefits for the remainder of the semester. 
Saint Mary's Security 
Amidst security department changes and improvements, Saint Mary's suspended security officer Belinda Rathert because her college transcripts were reportedly not on file. 
The College suspended and banned Rathert from campus while it investigated whether she misrep­resented herself to the College. Rathert questioned the profession­alism of the manner in which the situation was handled and main­tained that she contacted College officials in order to turn over her transcripts. At the time, College offi­cials stated that Rathert had not turned over her transcripts. 
In November, the suspended offi­

cer said she filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and intended to sue the College for sexual harassment and discrimination, unequal wages and a hostile work environment. 
Pollee flood The Boat Club 
On a chilly January morning, the underage drinking haven for stu­dents, The Boat Club, faced a simi­lar fate as Finnigan's Irish Pub in 2000, as Excise Police and South Bend Police busted the bar. 
Over 200 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students waited in line for hours as police, assisted by Notre Dame Security Police officers armed with student directories, verified the identification of patrons and issued citations. · 
Though Saint Mary's students did not receive punishment from the College, Notre Dame students were fined monetarily and ordered to complete service hours in addition to the fines and service hours they had to complete for Saint Joseph County. 
While many cited students believed they had put The Boat Club 

· bust behind them, Millennium Entertainment Inc., owner of The Boat Club, sued every cited student in small claims courts for damages of $3,000. The suits alleged that the defendants misrepresented them­selves to the nightclub in order to gain entrance. 
In an unrelated bar bust, Excise Police raided The Library Irish Pub in April and issued 51 citations, many to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. The Library was raided two years ago when it was called Finnigan's and has changed ownership since the previous bust. It is unclear whether the owners of The Library will also file suits against cited individuals as Millennium Entertainment did this April. 
Freshman dies 
Freshman Chad Sharon was found dead Feb. 12 under the Angela Bridge after being reported missing Dec. 12 by Fisher Hall staff because he did not return to his residence hall. Friends said they last saw Sharon around 2 a.m. at a

party on Corby Street. 
Sharon did not show up for any of his finals, and state and local police began an extensive search for the freshman. 
During their search for Sharon, police discovered a Madison Center employee who may have talked to Sharon outside the hospital around 4 a.m. the night of his disappear­ance. The employee said that an individual closely matching Sharon's des-cription asked for directions to the nearest conve­nience store. The hospital worker directed the student to the nearest 7 -Eleven. 
The investigation expanded to include searches of the area using dogs and helicopters as well as searches of the river but turned up few additional leads. 
University officials offered a $25,000 reward, which was later increased to $50,000 with the help of local businesses, to encourage anyone with information about Sharon to come forward. 
Sharon's parents visited campus in January to meet with investiga­tors and students who might have been unwilling to speak with police. 
The search ended when local con­struction workers found a body floating under the Angela Bridge that was later identified as Sharon's. Though the river had been searched, police speculated that the body had been dislodged from the river by high winds the day before. An autopsy and blood tests later revealed that Sharon's blood alcohol content was 0.224, although it could have been lower at the time of death, and that foul play was likely not involved. For Sharon's family and friends, these unfortunate developments finally brought some closure to months of uncertainty. 
Saint Mary's president retires 
Saint Mary's President Marilou Eldred officially announced her retirement March 5. 
Eldred became the 1Oth president and first laywoman president of the College upon her inauguration in 1997. 
Since then, she helped to improve Saint Mary's itself, along with it5~ relationship to the local community. 

With Eldred's supervision and ini­tiative came the development of the College's Strategic Plan to improve the curriculum, technology and diversity on campus. 
Eldred also headed the develop­ment of the Master Plan, a renova­tion and construction effort to update facilities and meet the needs of the college community at large. 
Eldred secured a $12 million grant loan from Lilly Endowment, Inc., which provided crucial funding for the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership that opened in 2001. The Center is believed to be the only of its kind in colleges and universities across the country. 
Efforts such as these helped Saint Mary's earn the reputation as the nation's premier Catholic women's college. The College has received a number one ranking for Midwest Liberal Arts Colleges by "U.S. News and World Report" five years of Eldred's six year term. 
"My experience at Saint Mary's has been fantastic," Eldred said. "It has been a privilege to lead this College to the next level; to work with our faculty and staff to provide the highest quality education possi­ble for the talented students who come to lSaint Mary's)." 
Eldred agreed to hold her position at the College until the Board of Trustees names her successor, which is expected to be at some point well into the 2003-2004 acad­emic year. 
Saint Mary's Reading Day 
After a 10-year student govern­ment lead struggle, Saint Mary's Academic Affairs Committee finally approved the reading day proposal. 
The approval will now allow Saint Mary's students the opportunity to work on projects, meet with profes­sors and prepare for exams the Friday before finals week.

opinions as well. 

Several students traveled to New York and Chicago to participate in protests in addition to organizing forums and demonstrations on campus. 
Hundreds of students and faculty members, including Father Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus of Notre Dame, signed an anti-war petition started at Notre Dame. 
Pro-war, anti-war, pro-troops and pro-peace voices could be heard on both campuses. 
Though it is unclear whether any­one from the Notre Dame or Saint Mary's community died in Operation Iraqi Freedom, several Notre Dame professors were sent to fight. A 2000 Notre Dame graduate, Dustin Ferrell, was severely injured in a humvee accident in Iraq and is recovering in the United States. He was awarded a purple heart. 
Scully resigns 

Following a reported leadership crisis in the University, Father Scully resigned as executive vice president, at the May Board of Trustees meeting. A committee formed to investigate Scully's behavior was scheduled to deliver a report at the meeting. 
His resignation followed a January incident where he accosted a reporter and cameraman from WNDU-TV before a Mass for then missing freshman Chad Sharon at the Fisher Hall parking lot. WNDU­TV is owned by the University and Scully was director of operations for the station. The cameraman said Scully smelled of alcohol when he approached them and told them to move their vehicles. Druker filed a report with NDSP and later with­drew her complaint after Scully apologized. 
Scully will remain as a political science professor at Notre Dame.

Saint Mary's grads continue legacies 
+ Several seniors are following in the footsteps of their mothers and grandmothers

~

News Wrirer 
By graduating Saturday. 24 Saint Mary's graduates will continue the legacies of their Alumnae mothers and in some instances, their grand­mothers as well. 
One third-generation grad­uate, Shaun Russell, will carry on an impressive lega­cy. Russell's grandmother graduated from Saint Mary's in 1946, the same year her husband graduated from Notre Dame. All eight of their children also earned degrees from either Notre Dame or Saint Mary's. 
..My
Russell will 


one more cousin will be starting next spring. 
"My grandparents arc ecstatic, because they're the root of the legacy. and they stay so young because of it," Russell said. "My grandmoth­er knows more about football than most sportscasters." 
Their family get-togethers are quite the Irish extrava­ganza, and they gather near the Loftus Center to tailgate every home football game. 
"We're so lucky, because our family's so big, that we have a place like this to get together," Russell said. "And I wouldn't have it any other way. If I hadn't gone to Saint Mary's, I'd feel so out of the loop." 
Bridget Horne is also a third-generation graduate. Her grandmother graduated from Saint Mary's in 1953 and her mother graduated in 1980. 
The legacy began by her grandmother and mother and the life-long friends that they made, greatly influ­enced Horne's decision to apply to Saint Mary's. She especially admires her moth­er's lasting relationships with her roommates. They still meet once a year. 
"I was looking for some­where I would leave with great girlfriends," she said. "And after seeing how my mother still keeps in touch 
with her friends, I knevv that Saint Mary's was where I would flnd that." 
Most daughters of alumnae tell similar stories, but the memoirs of some legacies include a very pivotal time in both Saint Mary's and Notre Dame's histories -the near merging of the two schools in 1971. 
Saint Mary's senior Meganne Hoffman continues the legacy of her mother who has a degree from Notre Darr.e but is an alumna of Saint Mary's. Her mother came to Saint Mary's in 1969 and declared her major in modern languages as the unification of the two

But after the merger was called off. the students who enrolled in major programs at Notre Dame finished the departmental requirements and graduated with degrees from Notre Dame. Consequently. even though HotTman's mother applied to Saint Mary's, she graduated with a degree in modern lan­guages from Notre Dame. 
But her mother is consid­ered a Saint Mary's alumna, and she even served as President of the Saint Mary's Indianapolis Alumna Club. 
Hoffman feels that the experiences that she and her mother have shared have ~trengthened the bond between them. 
"My mother understands a lot about my college experi· ence because she lived it," said Hoffman. "And she can relate to the philosophy of Saint Mary's College and the spirit here. That still hasn't changed in 30 years."

ND, SMC students add world view 
 International students provide new perspectives on campus 
By TERESA FRALISH 
Associare News Ediror 
For all students, college repre­sents a journey marked by learn­ing and growth, but it se~ms even greater when they start on the other side of the world. This year's seniors hail from locales across the world -as far away as China and Argentina. 
Though enrollment numbers for international students have been on the rise at both schoo!s over the past four years, foreign students are in a definite minori­ty, as only 38 will graduate from Notre Dame and two from Saint Mary's. 
But these students say they have come to love academic and student life here and will take important lessons about life with them 3S they travel back to their native countries or choose to remain in the United States. 
"I was amazed at how wonder­ful people are here." said Saint Mary's senior Kremi Angelova, who :s from Stara Zagora, Bulgaria. 
Senior Carol Tushabee, who transferred to Saint Mary's from Holy Cross College as a sopho­more. said she chose to come to the United States because Holv Cross actively recruited he;. Tushabee, who is from Uganda, was attracted to Saint Mary's small size and academic reputa­tion. 
"Overall, my experience has been good. The students and teachers have been really friend­ly," she said. 
At Saint Mary's, Tushabee, a philosophy major and women's studies minor. was involved in a myriad of activities but focused on service in the South Bend com­munity. Tushabee worked with adult literacy programs, was a member of the Around the World Club and volunteered at the Chapin Street Clinic and St. Margaret's House, a shelter for battered women. Saint Mary's also sent Tushabee and two other Saint Mary's students to Uganda to attend the International Interdisciplinary Conference on Women. 

After graduation, Tushabee hopes to carry with her the lessons she has learned about women and leadership. Next fall, she will attend Texas Women's University to earn a masters degree in women's studies. Eventually, Tushabee hopes to earn a doctorate in public policy and then work for a non-govern­mental organization, preferably at the United Nations. 
"I would like to find a job with the U.N. that focuses on women in developing countries," she said. 
Notre Dame senior Maria Richa, who is from Panama, said that the academic excellence of American schools was a major factor in her decision to come to the United States. "There's a lot of Panamanians that go to college in the U.S.," she said. "My father graduated from [Notre Dame]." 
At Notre Dame, Richa, who is a psychology major. said that adjusting to culture differences posed a challenge at first, but she soon began to feel at home at the University. Richa participated in foreign student programs through the Office of International Students Services and Activities and helped plan international stu­dent banquets her freshman. sophomore and junior years. . After leaving Notre Dame, Hicha intends to return to Panama and eventually attend 
'.U 
graduate school for clinical psy­
chology in either Europe or the 
United States. 

"I want to practice [as a psy­chologist] and probably open a kindergarten for children vvith mental deficiencies," she said. 
Uke Hicha, Angelova, a compu­tational mathematics major, said she choose to attend school in the United States because of the aca­demic reputation of American col­leges and the influence of another Bulgarian friend who attended school in the United States. 
When Saint Mary's ofl'ered her an academic scholarship, Angelova decided to leave her family and friends behind for a· new experience. 
"It was my first time going abroad," she said. "It was difficult to cross over the barrier of com­ing from another country.'; 
But once at Saint Mary's, Angelova found a welcoming community and a variety of activi­ties to participate in. An active member of the Math Club and a founding member of the Around the World Club, Angelova said her presence and that of other inter­national students helped to change the dynamics of student life at the College. 
"[International students] broad­en everyone else's point of view," she said. 
After graduating. Angelova said she would attend a graduate pro­gram in computational finance at Purdue University. After complet­ing her masters degree, Angelova said she will consider earning a doctorate and eventually may return to Bulgaria or live in west­ern Europe but will always remember her time at Saint Mary's. 
''I'm going to miss this close knit community," she said.

Diversity in Saint Mary's seniors 
By NATALIE BAILEY News Writer 
Approximately 350 women will make the transition from students to alumnae Saturday, May 17. 
While facing an increasingly tough economy, an estimated 70 percent of the· class of 2003 are going into the work force full time. 
According to Mary Regan­Kubinski, professor and chair of the nursing department, the market for nurses is excellent. 
"Our graduates are not only getting jobs, they are getting jobs in the fields that they want to go into," she said. 
Of the 14 graduates receiving a bachelor of science in nurs­ing, most either have jobs or are entering the field. Graduates are entering diverse clinical specialties from mid­wifery to on~ology. 
The outlook is not as certain for students graduating with bachelor of arts and bachelor of business administration degrees. 
"It looks like it will take three to four months for a lot of seniors to find a job," John Pauley, professor and depart­ment chair of communication studies, said. 
Many students are moving to the area of the country where they want to relocate and then starting a job search from there. Also, 30 percent of the class is looking to enter gradu­ate or professional schools. 
Kerry O'Reilly, one of the 35 graduates receiving a bachelor of arts in elementary educa­tion, plans to enroll in Marquette University's top ranked speech pathology pro­gram.

The majority of education majors are planning on going directly into the field. In the past, 40 percent of education majors enter teaching in Parochial schools. 
"Right now the suburban set­ting is very difficult area to get placement," said Helen Doyle, associate professor and chair of the education department. "Luckily most of our graduates are willing and able to go to under-served populations, including urban and Catholic, but it is difficult, very difficult." 
The biology department is graduating 27 students, most of whom will go onto higher learning. 
"Generally our students aren't looking for a job," Thomas Platt, professor and chair of the biology depart­ment, said. "They are generally looking to continue their educa­tion."

Catherine Roche, graduating with a bachelor of science in biology, is part of the 23 per­cent of graduates who will be spending the next year doing service. She will be volunteer­ing with the Jesuit Volunteer Core in Yakima, Wash. Her duties will include working as a volunteer coordinator for high school students who would like to work with the elderly. 
"I just figured that after four years of receiving an excellent education I want to give back what I have received," Roche said. 
After the year of service from August to August, Roche plans on going into health care. 
"I realize this is somewhat unconventional and people might see it as delaying entry into the real world," Roche said. "But we are going to be dealing with social injustice first hand and will be very much a part of the real world."

Saint Mary's has plan to replace Eldred 
By ANNELIESE WOOLFORD Saint Mary's Editor 
The Saint Mary's College Board of Trustees outlined its plan April 25 for selecting a replacement for Marilou Eldred, who announced her retirement March 5 but said 
she would remain as col­lege president until her suc­cessor was hired. 
The plan, which the Board pre­

sented to Eldred 
College facul­
ty, staff and 
students in a letter in early May, 
calls for the establishment of a spe­
cial search committee and sets a 
December goal or naming a 
replacement 
"The goal of the Saint Mary's College Board of Trustees and the entire College community is to attract an outstanding individual to serve as President." Sister Joan Marie Steadman, the chair of the Board ofTrustees, wrote in the let­ter. "This person should embody the core values of Saint Mary's, a commitment to its mission and its continued growth as a nationally recognized and ranked Catholic, women's, residential, liberal arts college." 
At its April 25 meeting, several days prior to the letter's writing, the Board of Trustees approved the search committee's develop­ment, along with the process employed to search for a presiden­tial candidate. 
Also at the time, Colleen Ryan was selected as chairperson of the committee and John O'Connor as vice chair. Both are members of the Board. 
The remainder of the Search Committee will consist of five Trustees, one member of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, two faculty members, two administrative members (one academic and one non-academic), one member of the student body, one alumna, one member of the Parents Council and one member from the South Bend community. 
As stated in the letter, those indi­viduals chosen to fill the positions

"will operate in an environment of 
mutual respect and cooperation, 
focused solely on the best interests 
of the College as a whole." 
"I believe the Search Committee 

well represents all Saint Mary's 
constituencies," Eldred said in 
response to the Board of Trustees' 
decision. "When I came here, the 
search was not open and I did not 
have the opportunity to meet many 
of the campus groups. I think that 
made it difficult for both me and 
the College." 
Once formed, the Committee will 

attempt to attract a broad range of 
candidates, both traditional and 
non-traditional along with quali­
fied graduates ofSaint Mary's. 
"The search will be proactive, 

reaching out to possible candidates 
who are not currently seeking a 
new position, but who would be 
excited about leading a nationally 
ranked college," Steadman said. 
Members of the Search 

Committee are required to sign a 
confidentiality agreement once 
appointed. While they will main­
tain consistent communication 
with the College community 
regarding the search process, the 
Committee's activities, discussions, 
materials and decisions will be 
kept confidential. 
When at least three candidates have been submitted to the Board, they will then be invited to campus for the purpose of meeting with key figures of the College prior to the Board of Trustees' appointing ofthe president. 
The Board will hold a meeting in December 2003 at which time it expects to name a president-elect. 
"I think December 2003 is an aggressive schedule, particularly for someone coming from higher education," Eldred said. "If the president is selected from the cor­porate world or is not in higher education, then perhaps it is a more possible schedule." 
Overall, Eldred is confident in the approach that the Board is tak­ing to the presidential search. 
She's not alone. 

"The next President of Saint Mary's College will build on the strong legacy of Dr. Marilou Eldred and her predecessors," Steadman said.

3 years 
+Computer science major took several AP classes in high school 
By ANDREW THAGARD Assistant News Editor 
Students often remark 
that their time under the 
Dome goes by quickly, but 
for Dan Brunner the col­
lege years have passed by 
even faster. The computer 
science major will graduate 
with the class of 2003 after 
just three years at Notre 
Dame. 
Brunner managed to 
shave a year off of his 
undergraduate education 
by taking a heavy load of 
advanced classes during 
high school. In total, he 
enrolled in 11 advanced 
placement courses that 
resulted in over 50 hours of 
college credit when he 
arrived at Notre Dame in 
the fall of 2000. 
The large number of col­
lege credit hours afforded 
Brunner several options, 
including more leeway in 
his semester schedules and 
more choices in the classes 
he could take. He also had 
the possibility of declaring 
a second major. Brunner, 
however, opted to graduate 
early instead. 
"I knew computer science 
was all I wanted to do," he 
said. "I wasn't interested in 
another field or another 
major." 
But that doesn't mean 
that Brunner hasn't taken 
the time to enjoy his years 
at Notre Dame. The Knott 
Hall resident played inter­
hall soccer. 
Brunner said that his advisers were supportive of his decision. 
He said that his parents were also pleased with the choice, especially because the early graduation will save the family over $30,000. 
While he is happy with his decision, Brunner said he will miss his friends and the Notre Dame experi­ence. 
''I'm planning on coming back for all the football games next year and hang­ing out with my friends," he said. 
Over the summer, Brunner will work for a small consulting firm in Cincinnati. 
During the internship, he will primarily focus on designing web pages. Next fall, Brunner may continue to work for the same com­pany full-time or search for a different job. 
''I'm not sure what I'll be doing long-term but I've got the [internship] lined up for right now," he said.

University cuts force colleges to look at budgets 
Admissions increases and construction project cuts among options for colleges 
By KATE NAGENGAST Senior StatfWriter 
Since the University Board of Trustees called for budget cuts in March as a result of losses to the endowment and a down economy. each college is now working to final­ize its 2003-04 budget and deter­mine the effects of a 5 percent cut to academic and student life expendi­tures mandated by the Board. 
Although the cut represents only a small portion ofthe University's esti­mated $600 million in annual expenses. it's significant at Notre Dame where the Board has not cur­tailed spending in nearly two decades. 
Coupled with a 6.5 percent tuition increase. which will bring 2003-04 tuition and room and board costs to $34,100. University budget cuts could affect student life -though University officials said they aim to avoid changes that would have a direct impact on students. especially student finances. 
"There's been a rigorous attempt to hold down tuition increases with wise decision making in the bud­get," said Matt Storin. University spokesman. "We want to arrive at a budget figure that will do the least damage to our University missions." 
Storin said preserving financial aid at its current levels is among the University's highest priorities. But the endowment, which provides financial aid for students. ranks 18th among U.S. colleges and universities and is the largest at any Catholic institution. dropped $200 million last year. 
''The budget cuts are not entirely 
based on the endowment drop, 
there have been additional rising 
costs . . . but the economy certainly 
affects things on the revenue side 
adversely," said Storin. 
More than half of Notre Dame's 
operating budget revenues and 
roughly 81 percent ofthe education­
al and general revenues come from 
tuition and fees, according to the 
strategic plan, thus even a small 
percentage increase in tuition or in 
the number of enrolled students 
assists with budgeting -and in 
2003 the University plans to attempt 
both. 

Notre Dame plans to admit 25 more students, making 1,960 the target size for the class of 2007. 
Eileen Kolman, dean of First Year . Studies, said her office will plan for 1,980 students, however, she also questioned Notre Dame's continued ability to attract a surplus of stu­dents during an economic down­tum. 
"I think the economy is in a bad way and Notre Dame is expensive -so we may not see the confirma­tion rate of past years again," Kolman said, in reference to the class of 2005 enrollment swell of over 2,000 students. 
First Year Studies was also asked to make a 5 percent budget cut, but Kolman said that could be accom­plished through fewer summer mailings and relying more on Internet communication. without adversely affecting students. 
According to Ava Preacher. assis­tant dean in the College of Arts and Letters, Arts and Letters will increase the number of transfer stu­
dents it admits and decrease the 

number of student leaves ofabsence 
it grants, a scenario she believes will 
be problematic. 
Preacher said Arts and Letters 
typically admits 60 to 70 sophomore 

and junior transfer students per 
year, but for 2003-04 it has been 
asked to admit 90 students. 
"It means we'll have to look at 
compromising quality," said 
Preacher. "With 90 students accept­
ed you may actually be taking stu­
dents who won't fare well in the 
classrooms here." 
Arts and Letters will also allow only 16 leaves of absence in 2003­04, roughly eight per semester, after allowing up to 40 this year. This cut could hinder study abroad opportu­nities for students who want to take a leave of absence to travel through programs outside of Notre Dame's International Studies and London Program offerings and want to receive credit for their time away. 
Preacher said her office would now prioritize leave request based upon whether applicants had already had an abroad experience and ifthey were interested in partic­ipating in programs where Notre Dame had no existing offering, such as Africa. 

Preacher said increasing enroll­ment through the combination of larger incoming classes, more trans­fer students and fewer leaves of absence could increase class size, limit course availability, or even risk students' ability to graduate in the expected four to five years with a semester abroad and mounting scheduling conflicts. 
The College of Science and the 

College of Business typically offer 
larger classes and encounter fewer 
scheduling dilemmas, but nonethe­
less find themselves with contrasting 
budget issues. 

According to accounting professor Bill Nichols, the Mendoza College of Business will have little trouble making their required budget cuts for 2003 by reducing their publica­tions, entertainment and alumni relations budgets. 
"We approached the budget cut with the objective to retain faculty slots, maintain course offerings and maintain funding for faculty research," Nichols said. 
These goals are similar to those set by the College of Science, but the College of Business results are envi­able for Marvin Miller, chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. 
Miller said his department like­wise prioritized faculty retention and therefore allowed for a 1.5 per­cent increase in faculty salaries to "keep morale up." 
"To cut faculty and staff salaries would be imprudent," said Miller. 'The worst thing we could do is lose faculty to competing academics or industry. The last thing we want to do is make it attractive for them to leave." 

But, according to Miller, 90 per­cent of the Chemistry and Biochemistry budget is salaries, thus forcing its supply budget to take a 30 to 35 percent cut to meet next year's University budget require­ments. He said there has been dou­ble digit inflation in the cost ofscien­tific supplies. but his department budget has not increased in five years. 
"Teaching science is relatively 
expensive," said Miller. "My biggest 
fear is that come February or March 
of next year, we'll walk into the labs 
and have to tell the students, 'Sorry, 
we're out of supplies.' Needless to 
say we'll be frustrated in our teach­
ing efforts without supplies." 
Various campus construction pro­jects have also been delayed or halt­ed as a result of budget restraints, Jim Lyphout, vice president for busi­ness operations, told The Observer in April. Delayed projects include a new science and learning building to be built north of the Joyce Center for $70 million, a new post office and security building near the Stepan Center, and improvements to the Loftus Center. Projects that were completed or are still on schedule despite cuts include the Marie P. DeBartolo Center for Performing Arts, the Stepan Chemistry Hall, O'Shaughnessy Hall renovations and Hesburgh Library renovations. 
Preacher said an additional facul­ty concern related to building pro­jects is parking as teachers will for the first time be charged for parking beginning in the fall of 2004. 
''The University is tightening the budget and in many ways they've needed to do it," said Preacher. "Every now and then it seems the University should cut back on cer­tain luxuries. You look at the grounds and wonder when they lay down and tear up sidewalks repeat­edly. Money seems to flow to some places more than others."

Scully resigns as executive VP 

By ANDREW SOUKUP 
News Writer 
The University's third-ranking official announced May 2 he would resign his posi­tion as executive vice president but remain a member of the faculty. 
Father Timothy Scully informed the University's Board of Trustees that his res­ignation would take effect June 30. The Trustees met on cam­pus May 2 to discuss business that was scheduled to include a report from a four­person committee formed to investigate Scully 


'j Scully's behavior,
j 
including a Jan. 16 confrontation with two local television reporters and a camera­man. 
However, University spokesman Matt Starin said Scully's resignation was ten­dered to the Board before the report was discussed. The report, Starin said, cleared Scully of any wrongdoing. 
A South Bend Tribune report on May 3 said Scully's resignation averted a possible crisis in the upper echelon of the University's leadership, according to unnamed sources in the University's administration quoted by the Tribune. 
A majority of top administrators ­including University President Father Edward Malloy -wanted Scully out, according to the Tribune, which also cited sources as saying Malloy was prepared to resign ifScully remained. 


In a prepared statement, Scully did not provide a reason for his resignation. Malloy, in the same University-issued state­ment, said, "His tenure has been marked by his creative thinking, his wise business sense and his enduring commitment to the University community." 
I 
'i A committee established by the Board of Trustees will lead a search to find Scully's successor, but Starin said he did not know when the Board of Trustees would name Scully's successor. 
"It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as an officer of the University for the past nine years," Scully said in his state­ment. "My first love has always been teaching, research and pastoral ministry. I'm excited at the prospect of returning full time to those pursuits." 
Neither Scully nor Malloy were available for comment, and the only official University response came in the form of a statement that cited many of Sqtlly's achievements. "The statement largely speaks for itself," Starin said. 
"The fruits of his dynamic decision-mak­ing and high standards for performance will continue to influence this University long into the future," said the chairman of the Board of Trustees, Patrick McCartan, in a statement. "We respect the personal nature of the decision he has made to step down but look forward to a continuing relationship with him as a member of the Board of Fellows and the Board of Trustees and as a valued member of the faculty." 
Scully, who was initially scheduled to teach a class entitled "Leadership and Social Concern" in the fall semester, is instead taking what one member of the political science department called an administrative leave. Typically, when administrators return to the faculty ranks, they can receive at least one semester off from teaching. No students were affected by the decision to cancel class because permission was required to register, and Scully had not approved any students before the class was cancelled. 
In a voice mail message left with The Observer Tuesday, Scully said he looks for­ward to the challenge of returning to the teaching and research field. 
A member of the political science depart­ment, Sc!llly said he intends to teach one of three courses: comparative politics, Latin American politics and Leadership and Social Concern. 
He will continue to chair the advisory board for the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies, to serve as the direc­tor of the Institute for Educational Initiatives and to chair of the board of the Alliance for Catholic Education, which he founded. 
"I can't wait to be able to spend more time in my beloved Fisher Hall [where Scully lives] and celebrate Mass," said Scully, who was leading a retreat in Chile when he called. "That, combined with a very heavy teaching agenda and working as a Fellow and Trustee will keep me very busy." 
Scully did not talk about what made him decide to resign in the message. He could not be reached for further comment. 
Named executive vice president in July 2000, Scully was in charge of human resources, campus construction and over­saw the University's financial matters ­which included administering a University operations budget that topped $500 million and an endowment over $2.6 million. Prior to his appoint!Ilent, he had served since 1994 as the University's vice president and senior associate provost. 
In January, Scully was involved in a con­frontation with a reporter and cameraman from the University-owned television sta­tion WNDU-1V who were covering a Mass for missing freshman Chad Sharon at Fisher Hall. Sharon's body was discovered Feb. 12 in the St. Joseph River. 
According to the cameraman, who said he smelled alcohol on Scully's breath dur­ing the incident, the executive vice presi­dent grabbed reporter Bonnie Druker by the arm and angrily told the pair to move their van, which he said was parked in the wrong spot behind Fisher. Scully later apologized for the incident, but it was unclear what role -if any -the con­frontation had in Scully's decision to resign. 
Under Scully's nine-year tenure as a University administrator, the number of Notre Dame students studying abroad dou­bled and Notre Dame established academic programs in Chile, Mexico and Washington, D.C. The University also made significant progress on its master plan for campus construction.

Father Malloy honored with 14th degree 
Special to The Observer 

University President Father Edward Malloy received an honorary doctor of divinity degree from Saint Leo University in Saint Leo, Fla., dur­ing its commencement ceremonies May 10. It was his 14th such honor. 
Malloy also delivered the com­mencement address to a record 495 students who were receiving their bachelor's degrees. 
Notre Dame's 16th president, Malloy was elected by the Board of Trustees in 1986, and he has led the University at a time of rapid growth in its reputation, faculty and resources. During his tenure, Notre Dame's faculty has increased by more than 350, the academic quality of the student body has improved dramatically, and the number of minority students has more than dou­bled. 
The University's $2.6 billion endowment is among the top 20 in higher education, and its recently completed "Generations" capital campaign raised $1.1 billion, by far the most successful in the history of Catholic higher education and just the twelfth billion-dollar campaign ever for a private university. 
Malloy has been a driving force behind efforts to promote community service and combat substance abuse. A member of the advisory board of AmeriCorps and the National Civilian Community Corps, he also is a found­ing director of the Points of Light Foundation, a member of the board of governors of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and a member of the Indiana Community Service and Volunteer Committee and the Indiana Commission on Community Service.

 Meals eaten, classes taken, Masses celebrated, it's all here by the numbers 
Spedal to The Observer 
Another academic year is ending at Notre Dame. Most students have packed up and gone home. Seniors are enjoying their last days on campus before Commence­ment. 
There is no way to quantify what Notre Dame has meant to them, but they will leave some statistical footprints. 
For example, the Registrar's office reports that 6,837 classes were taught during the past fall and spring semesters, including graduate, undergraduate and independent study courses. 
About 180,000 textbooks were purchased at the Hammes Bookstore on cam­pus. 
Research grants totaled $43,902,214. 

Students and visitors eating on campus consumed 1. 5 tons of chicken strips, 60,000 gallons of milk, 88 tons of bananas. 
There were 2 million meals se·rved in the various dining halls, snack bars and restau­rants, including 70,000 in the Morris Inn. 
As anyone who visits the campus in autumn knows, it is hard to miss the Notre Dame Marching Band, either in performance or practice, but there are many other orchestras, bands, choirs and choral groups. They com­bined for 301 concerts and 115 band performances. 
Some of those band perfor­mances were at the Univcrsitv's 183 athletic con­tests', no"t counting tourna­ments that are under the supervision of the National Collegiat~ Athletic Associa­tion. Fans attending those events totaled 865,591. 
That makes for a few dirty uniforms. But they were just part of the story at the St. Michael's Laundry, which many students patronize. It processed 1.5 million tons of soiled fabric. 
The spiritual side of Notre !)arne is immeasurable, but Campus Ministry pegs the m·mber of Masses, including these at the Basilica of the Sacrr,d Heart, the crypt and residence hall chapels at about .? ,000. 
It's <:.n .incomplete list. There were kilowatt hours of electric power generated, gallons of water supplied, medications applied, acres of grass mowed, and so on. 
After Sunday's Commence­ment, the campus will be quiet for a few weeks before the summer session and vari­

The Observer is a mc:mber of the Associated Press. AH tqJroduc1ion righrs are 
rocrvcd. 

It was Freshmen Orientation 1999 and I was strolling on God Quad with my room­mate. We stumbled upon an upperclass­man that had inspired someone I knew in high school. After I told the student about his influence on my old acquaintance, the upperclassman asked, "Is she hot?" 
And so my true college experience began. 

Notre Dame has a mystique that draws people to the campus like stu­dents to South Dining Hall when it serves chicken strips. Though Notre Dame is arguably the No. 1 Catholic institution in the country (and the dining halls were supposedly No. 2 when we entered the University as freshmen), the rankings, the prominence and the "oohs" and "ahhs" can be deceiving. This is how I felt when the awe-inspiring student flippantly replied to me and my roommate. 
Even so, the world is full ofpeople, places and situations that seem inconsis­tent. As inspirational as the upperclass­man was to a high school teenager, he was also a typical20-year-old guy. Yet, his off-the-cuff remark did not destroy Notre Dame's reputation in my eyes. I've learned in these past four years that inconsisten­cies and obstacles will inevitably appear to complicate life, but there is always a chance to find a positive outcome. 
It takes more than one silly remark or a more serious incident to shatter the dreams tlmt we have tried to pursue at this institution. And the same way we entered Notre Dame with goals and ideas about positively shaping our lives and the world, we can enter postgraduate lives \\-ith the same determination and opti­mi<>m. 

Notre Dame is unique because we have 
made it that way. All of our dreams of 
traveling the world, becoming president, 
empowering the poor, building a multina­
tional firm, curing the sick or creating a 
masterpiece, seemed that much more pos­
sible when we stepped foot on this green 
campus. The University is skilled at easing 
our transition into the lifestyle of this 
Indiana oasis. 

When Notre Dame's blue skies turn gray and the green grass is covered in white, it's easy to question whether our dreams are worth the obstacles, but this Commencement Weekend -the celebra­tion of an end and a beginning-should remind us that we made the right choice. 
College graduates represent about one­fourth of the population. I had a political science professor consistently remind my class of that fact this semester, pointing out that attending an elite institution puts us in a smaller group. I will represent the roughly one percent of the population comprised ofAfrican-American female college graduates according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 
While I know that I deserve a degree on Sunday after all the papers, tests and sac­rifices I have made on behalfofmy health in attempts to study at ridiculously late hours after a day of responsibilities, I must remember that celebration is not the only must-do after I turn my tassel. 
Being a college graduate is more than a ticket to a high-paying job or a prestigious graduate school. Many Notre Dame stu­dents demonstrate this each year as they prepare for jobs in the Peace Corps, Teach for America and other programs available to those who want to build up the society in which they live. Being a college gradu­ate is about understanding that you have a responsibility to continue in your pursuit of knowledge and experience. It's about knowing th.at even ifyou have been blessed with a great opportunity after school, you will not let your idealism van­ish at the slightest barrier, but you will recognize it as a new challenge. 
Many people are drawn to Notre Dame 

for the tradition, the communal atmos­
phere and the Christian values the 
University espouses. As a student, I have 
learned that not everyone cares about the 
Notre Dame tradition, sometimes this 
community is exclusive and not everyone 
is a Christian. But I've also learned that 
the notion oftradition can be transformed. 
Mike Brown, Molly Kinder, Brooke Norton, 
Tambre Paster and Tyrone Willingham 
are examples ofthis. 
Also, students can find their niche in a sometimes exclusive Notre Dame through student clubs and other groups. As for reli­gion, there are many outlets that allow students to strengthen their faith, but encounters with non-Christians are also fruitful and allow one to see the world from a new perspective. 
I thank Notre Dame for exposing me to the real world in small doses. During the last four years, Notre Dame was the place that welcomed me with its golden reflec­tion, where I found opportunities to travel to Italy, Chile and Cuba, where I met my best friends, where I confronted unpleas­ant realities, where I was intellectually and spiritually challenged and where I learned never to apologize for being myself. 
And most recently, it is the place where I have realized that the three words the upperclassman said to me during my first week can be turned into a reflection ofthe past and hope for the future. As neo-soul vocalist Erykah Badu once sang, "Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learned." Let the newest stage ofyour life bring many lessons and many blessings.

' 
Well, we made it 
With graduation upon us, the Class of 2003 has just about crossed that proverbial threshold. Our senior year has come to an end and we realize 
1 that on a seemingly ordinary Sunday 
,,I in South Bend, 
u our lives will Jacqueline 
,,,\ change forever. 
We will gradu­ate from the University we Happily Ever have learned to After call home become a part of its alumni. 
And what a ride we've taken to get there. 
Senior year has traditionally been referred to as the last hurrah, a time to celebrate with good friends, cheap drinks and a fistful of "lasts." We begin think about the last time we'll get up at 6 a.m. to tailgate. The last time we'll pull an all-nighter to get that paper written. The last spring break. The last time we'll all be together. 
With all of these lasts, we begin to look at Notre Dame with nostalgia before we've even left it. It's as if we've found a perfect world and we're 
,( 
afraid to leave it. We're comfortable in 
'I I our surroundings. Nothing is new, and yet, we're encouraged by it. We've found our place and we understand our role in it. Suddenly, the "last" time becomes the "best" time. Life at 22 is our finest hour. However, maybe it's time to think about "firsts." Our first real job. Our first time doing our own taxes. Our first step toward a professional degree. Marriage. We begin to make these very real decisions that will affect our lives in the same way that our decisions during college affected us and maybe more. During the past four years, we've made a lot of decisions. We've changed our majors, sometimes more than once. We've taken internships and waded through rued school appli­cations. We've made a lot of friends, lost a few along the way and even fall­en in and out oflove. We've also learned a lot about ourselves, who we are and what we are going to be. And now, we're there again. At the beginning of the year, it all seemed overwhelming. We wrote essay after essay for graduate school applications, sat through seemingly endless interviews and dealt with rowdy freshmen when we were on duty. But, we made it. We were accepted into graduate schools, got 
those jobs and came to love our fresh­men. We learned something new every day, whether we paid attention or not. 
We're more than ready for that next great adventure. College has always been considered a time to grow and mature, but there is a reason why it spans a short four years. And it's not because Notre Dame doesn't want any more of our money (it's quite the con­trary, as we recently found out via the Annual Giving Fund). 
Rather, it's because after four years, we've been prepared for something more and something beyond our col­lege lives. We're ready, both academi­cally and socially and it's time to move on, remembering the lasts but focus­ing on the frrsts. After all, commence­ment isn't defmed as an ending. Quite the opposite. It signifies a beginning. 
We've accomplished a great deal during our time at Notre Dame, but now it is time to think ahead and to look forward. We have already chosen new places to live, places to work and a new life for ourselves, just as we did during our time as undergraduates. Some of us will begin a great adven­ture in a new city, some will take on the challenges of graduate school and some of us will start a life together. 
Yes, our memories are full of lasts. College, as we've been told for years, goes by quickly. This may be our last year for the parties, the dances and the tailgating, but we have so much before us. And we can congratulate ourselves because, looking back, we got through it. We're going to gradu­ate. We made it. 
It's been said that the quality of a university is measured more by the kind of student it turns out than the kind it takes in. Notre Dame prides itself on taking only the best. However, the University should hold in even higher regard the remarkable people it graduates each year. 
We have the next few days to be col­lege students, our last moments under the Dome as undergraduates. However, there are many frrsts out there waiting for us. We're certainly prepared for them. 
With a bit of luck, when we receive our diplomas this weekend, we'll be ready for them.

Holding on to memories 
I didn't want this column to be just one more in a long list of columns about saying goodbye. Despite the fact that I have lots of wonderful memories here in South Bend, I didn't know how many of you would share similar ones. And, if you do understand 
Katie McVoy 

them, you have 
plenty of your own. 
You probably don't 
want to read about Senior Staff 
mine. Witer 
So, instead, I've decided to offer a suggestion for how to hold on to those memories. I'm not offering ideas for scrap books or photo albums. Instead, I'm offer­ing a suggestion of how to hang on to your old memories and make a few new ones. So, here goes. 
U.T.P. 

It is about holding on to memories. 
U.T.P. 

It isn't about sappy recollections of frrst 
days on campus or last moments under the Dome. 
U.T.P. 

It's about all those things we love about Saint Mary's and Notre Dame. U.T.P. It's about leaving behind all those things 
we don't love. 
It isn't about the smell of ethanol on Sunday morning when you wish you had stopped drinking just two shots before. It isn't about unescorted males, detex cards or balls of wax, even without the wick. 
U.T.P. 
is not about bad meals, bad memo­ries or bad phone numbers you shouldn't have gotten the night before. U.T.P. isn't about 8 a.m. finals. 

U.T.P. 
is about waking up way too early to start drinking. It is about toasting every­one and everything you know. It is about cooking five-cent hotdogs on a grill you borrowed from your parents. 


But more importantly, U.T.P. is about being alumni. 
But what is U.T.P.? Easy. 
Ultimate Tailgate Party. 
Two years ago when my sister graduat­ed, she and her friends started thinking about what would be the appropriate gath­ering for her and her friends. Trips to teashops or even shopping malls didn't seem to quite fit the bill. But then they had an idea. 
U.T.P. 

But as far as Molly was concerned, it wouldn't be quite ultimate enough until my friends and I hit the big graduation mark and joined in. 
So U.T.P. was born. Two RVs, two days and two sets of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's grads. 
But what's important is that it is not just about drinking or football. U.T.P. is about 
something more. 

It's about being "those alumni." You all 
know which ones I'm talking about -the 
alumni who come back from around the 
country, play music way too loud, laugh 
too much and always end up at The 

Backer. It's the alumni who hit every place 
on campus that holds some memory for 
them, still do all the cheers and chants 

with the students, but laugh at themselves 
when they get laughed at for being old. 

Because, well, I just figured out being old 
and being alumni is OK. 

When college ends, we have an opportu­nity to move on and make new memories somewhere else. But the thing is, we can still make memories here. 
That's what U.T.P. is about. It's about 

finally being old enough that security won't 
card us or write us up for being students 
who are having a tailgate. It's about laugh­
ing about all of the stupid things we did 

when we were freshmen and were still try­
ing to impress everyone of the opposite 
sex. It's about running into those guys 

from sophomore year who you accidentally 
impressed and then tried to hide from for 
the next three years. But this time. when 
you run into them, you can stop and say hi 
because it's an old memory. 

U.T.P. is about calling home and letting Mom and Dad know you're going to a foot­ball game, but not having to ask permis­sion because you're finally out on your own. It's about fmally understanding how Mom and Dad, who are both alumni. feel when they come back to campus, look at the new buildings and say "this isn't quite the Notre Dame I remember." 
It's about understanding your family who graduated and make you stop at "their rock," talk about stealing the sign in the book from Saint Mary's, or recall Senior Death March one more time. It's about understanding that and doing it yourself. 
U.T.P. is about remembering why you came to Saint Mary's or Notre Dame in the first place. It's about being allowed to say "I had a great college experience" without everyone laughing at you. U.T.P. is about the spirit of two universities that have something no other university will ever claim -they have alumni who want to have a U.T.P. 
So next football season when you're wandering around the tailgate lots, look for the two big RVs with some recent grads who look like they're having too much fun. 
And stop by and remember with us.

What our education can and should be 
A Notre Dame education. as with any reasonably complete education, encour­ages students to grow curious, to inquire, to test old adages and to confront the pressing moral issues of our time. I can say that Notre Dame continues to do this, 
Pat McElwee
despite the growth 
of a trade school 
mentality in some circles, because any Senior Staff student who sought Writer out a real education 
here could have found it. 
During the past four years, this perpetu­ally manicured campus has given us a semi-retreat from the harsh realities of the world -an environment where moral, sci­entific and philosophical discussions could take place free from the weighty concerns of political correctness and career advancement. 
I am worried, though. I am worried about how many Darners did fmd time to learn, challenge and explore. I am worried about the death of the foreign language requirement in four out of the University's five colleges. I am worried about racist overtones in comments about Arabs, politi­cal statements torn from my bedroom door and a general unwillingness to question the status quo and even a disinterest in its immoral consequences. 
This is no time for complacency. The past four years have been politically tumultuous on a global scale. Rather than binding together in mutual understanding, the world is searing itself apart with hate and violence. Terrorists turned peaceful air­planes into weapons, targeting thousands of American, French, Muslim, Mexican and other victims in two of the tallest buildings in the world. The American government has responded with two full-scale invasions that killed and maimed at least as many innocent people -whether or not those wars were justified, the dead must be remembered. 
Indeed, this semester, the American gov­ernment, unprovoked, invaded a potential­ly oil-rich Third World country, weakened by 12 years of civilian sanctions and almost daily bombing. The justifications given by our government were flimsy and certainly appropriate targets ofinformed moral inquiry. Yet, although the Pope, the U.S. bishops, other churches and global public opinion (outside the United States, Britain and Israel) denounced the war, the infa­mous weapons of mass destruction have not been found and the "liberation" of Iraq is occurring even as the United States props up equally undemocratic regimes throughout the world, many students have opined that it would be inappropriate to question the American president at a time like this. This certainly reflects the mood of the country and of Fox News, but I worry that it has come to characterize the other­wise morally inquisitive campus of Notre Dame. 
Now is exactly the time when those who benefit from an education such as ours should perk up their ears, pay attention to 
U.S. foreign policy and demand that such grave actions be taken within a rational, moral framework. Unfortunately, I worry that the dominant mood at Notre Dame has been dismissive of dissent. But, I may be wrong. 
There are some indications that I am. For one thing, many students have experi­enced the force of Catholic Social Teaching through classes, late-night rap sessions or service-learning activities with the Center 
. for Social Concerns -perhaps the most laudable institution on campus. The Catechism leads us to challenge any eco­nomic system that fails to provide dignified work, the right to collective bargaining and a just wage. In fact, it has inspired some students and campus workers to question publicly why workers at this University are denied a just wage. Others have joined with the Coalition of Immokalee [Farm] Workers in Florida in asking Taco Bell to pay for a wage increase for tomato pickers -an increase they have not received in over 20 years. 
Students take part in the community, often in ways that challenge the status quo with an eye toward improving American and global society. They teach the path of non-violence through "Take Ten," com­plete internships or volunteer work with public interest organizations like Center for the Homeless or get to know their neigh­bors or the "townies." Plus, on the part of those students either against or for the recent war against Iraq, there has been a public discussion. 
In any case, people who have received a top-notch education at Notre Dame, Saint Mary's or Holy Cross cannot morally lay down and allow the established line to pre­vail unquestioned and untested. 
We are men and women of privilege, and one of the unfortunate things about privi­lege is that it can blind us to the injustices endured by others. Our education should be the antidote to that. If we are really to follow the example of Our Lady, we must look to the downtrodden, to those who bear a heavy cross, to those who must give birth in a stable. We must strive not to join their oppressors, but to recognize our human solidarity with them. This knowledge is what a Notre Dame education can impart, and it is what many of us will take away.

EXCERPTS FROM PAST ISSUES 
Four years in review: Students react to campus issues 
Campus responds to Sept. 11 
With today's tragedy comes much frustration and anger. Americans feel vulnerable; reality macks us hard and we recognize that we are not as safe as we might believe. The unimaginable happened, blatant acts of evil occured and inno­cent people died. Fathers, wives, nieces and friends were unjustly taken from us. As i watched today's tragedy unfold, I questioned world peace ... 
In the midst of such evil. thousands of people gathered at South Quad together as one. This afternoon sitting amongst my peers and profes­sors, I was overwhelmed by hope. I felt proud to be a part of the Notre Dame community ... 
On this sad, emotionally draining day we joined hands and prayed together in support and faith. On this sad, emitionally draining day we joined hands and prayed together, expressing our sor­row for the victims and a sense of hope for the future... 
Megan Horvath 
JUniOr McGlinn Hall Sept. 11, 2001 
A new line has been drawn in the sand since Tuesday's tragedy and it is not between the United states and foreign terrorists. it is between the people who believe in action and those who believe in dialogue. 
I believe that our country's military needs to take action. My opinion has been called a knee­jerk reaction and an ignorant response to what has happened ... 
Our current government will have to make diffi-. cult decisions in the coming weeks. They will get their hands dirty, and there is a good chance of added bloodshed. Do I ant more civilians killed? no i do not. But let's face it, the courts have not been a deterrrent. The old saying "actions speak louder than words" rings true in how I feel America should respond. 
So continue to talk, as I hope you all will do. Speak loudly in support ofour government or protest the actions they take in the future ... 
Ryan Lockwood JUniOr off-campus Sept. 13, 2001 

Vagina Monologues degrade women 
The last time I checked, rape and child molesta­tion were not women's empowerment issues. They were considered violence against women issues ... 
I consider myself a feminist. i worked at a femi­nist organization over the summer, Feminists for life ofAmerica. None of the women I have ever met. around town or on the job, would willing support the publication of "The Vagina Momologues" as great women's empowerment literature ... 
The shows final result is that it has pardoned and glorified rape, child molestation, pornography and prostituition. 
In a world where feminists and all those who fight for women's injustice have worked so hard over the years to gain respect and adminration for the way we manage our lives, I find it hard to see how this show could further that cause at all ...

Questioning revised alcohol policy 
What [Father Mark] Poorman's policies tell us is that the University does not see students as adults, but as uncouth youngsters that must be monitored and controlled in every way, shape and form. Instead of approaching us as adults, seeking our input (and I'm not talking focus groups possibly made up of anti-drinking, anti-social people here), the administration acted like bad parents. They waited until housing con­tracts were in for next year and until RAs were hired O'm sorry, guys) to unveil their tradition-killing plans. 
Jesse Hensley JUniOr Siegfried Hall March 20, 2U02 

... Inside one of the largest "drinking schools" in the United States, will the lack of hard liquor inside the dorms really have such a nega­tive effect on our community? Or will it help to make it just a little more safe and a more respectful place for those who live within it? 
Students are protesting the administration infringing on our rights while many of these same students are given more rights by the University than are legally theirs as minors. With rights come respon­sibilities ... 
Katie Fuehrmeyer Juruor Notre Dame program in Puebla, Mexico March 27, 2002 

Father Mark Poorman claims 30 focus groups were consulted before this decision was made, but declines to specifY who they were and what was said. His letter makes refernces to percentages, numbers and comparisons to.other schools, yet does not include these statistics and assumes we will simply take his word for it. 
Perhaps ifstudents had better access to the results of this study, we could better understand how this decision was made. If the situation is really that bad, then the evidence will be right there for us all to see.

Notre Dame and Saint Mary's seniors are graduating this weekend, but what are they doing next? 
While a few may hit up Walt Disney 
World in the coming week, their long­
term plans are more varied. 
Former Notre Dame football center Jeff Faine, for example, will suit up in a Cleveland Browns uniform this fall while Andrew Serazin, a senior biology major, will travel to Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar.

Students from both schools with a vari­ety of majors -will begin the climb up the corporate ladder as their peers head back to the classroom, enrolling in med­ical and law schools and a variety of other graduate programs. Other Notre Dame and Saint Mary's graduates will volunteer for a year or two through serv­ice programs in domestic and interna­tional locales and seniors in Army, Air Force and Navy ROTC will fulfill their commitments to serve the country. Students from Notr·e Dame and Saint Mary's are engaged and a few plan to tie the knot in the coming months. 
Indeed, the post-graduate plans of this year's two classes are as diverse and var­ied as the students who compose them. 
Called to serve 
Students from both schools are contin­uing a long-standing tradition of giving back after graduation. 
Anne Traynor, for example, will pack her bags and head to Micronesia this fall through a Jesuit Volunteer Corps pro­gram. The science education major will dedicate two years to teaching biology and chemistry. 
"Since high school I've known I wanted to do some service after fcollege] gradua­tion," she said. ''I've done a lot of service in high school and college. I feel I learned a lot from it. I've had an opportunity to grow in my faith here and I'd love to expand on that." 
Traynor is not alone. Andrea Smith Shappell, director of senior transition programs at the Center for Social Concerns, said approximately 10 percent of this year's graduating class are com­mitted to service programs. Between eight and 10 percent of Saint Mary's graduates also plan to volunteer for the next year or two, said Sister Linda Kors, director of the SURV Center. 
Popular programs for Notre Dam_e sen­iors include Holy Cross Associates and the Alliance for Catholic Education, both of which are based on campus-. Many Saint Mary's students are volunteering through the Peace Corps and Jesuit Volunteer Corps, though graduates from both schools are committed to a variety of different programs. 
According to Kors and Shappell, stu­dents pursue post-graduate service for a variety of reasons. Many volunteer exten­sively during their time at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's and want to continue assisting others. Some cite a desire to 
grow in their religious faith as a motivating factor. 
"It felt like I was getting stuff constantly throughout my years of education," said Rory Dippold, a history major who will teach middle school children in Mobile, Ala. through ACE. "I wanted to give back. I wanted to do service through teaching." 
Despite the economic situ­ation, few students said they elected to pursue service because of problems secur­ing a job. Recent events in the Middle East have also not deterred gradmttes from pursuing international serv­ice programs. In fact, the percentage of students trav­eling abroad for service at both schools is the highest in recent years. 
Back to the books 
Even though some stu­dents arc too tired of books to continuP with more edu­eation after four years of eollege, others jump right back into aeademia, pursu­ing various graduatP pro­grams. In the past, anywhere from 13 to 17 percent of sen­iors have gone on to con­tinue their studies after graduation. 
Many Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students are headed on to prestigious programs or are the recipients of well­known academ­ic bon­

The program offers up to 10 awards for lecturing and research each year to students with high academic and extracurricular qualifications. Kelly applied in September of the past year at the encouragement of many of her professors and heard back from the program on May 5. 
"It's a very humbling experience to go through your senior year knowing that what you want to do is in the hands of other people," said Kelly. "The encour­agement I've received is an aflirmation of the presence and community that exists at Notre Dame and that I think a lot of the students feel." 
Law school is another popular destina­tion for graduating seniors, attracting as much as eight percent of the dass in past years. Although law school is most popu­lar among students in the College of Arts and Letters, students from every school except architecture go on to study law every year. 
Senior Veronica Berger plans to attend either Notre Dame Law School or the law school at Cornell University. 
'Tm excited to get on my own two feet for onee, and do something that I'm real­ly intrn~sted in," said BPrger.

school. Many medical students enter Notre Dame with the full knowledge that they have eight years of school and up to six years of residency ahead of them and take advantage of the undergraduate years to pursue other interests 
as well. 
"I knew what I wanted to do when I started and I came in as an anthro­pology and ALPP major," said Brita Mc­Cullough, who will attend medical school at Loyola University of Chicago. "It's a good back­ground and [gives] a good perspective on 
medical school." 
For engineer­ing . students, graduate school is also a popular option. though not a necessity. Two years earning a master's degree or five years earning a Ph.D. open doors to a wide variety of jobs and teaching positions in the 
field. Engineering student Jim Dalton plans to enter the University 
of Wisconsin's electrical engineering program in the fall and hopes to earn a Ph.D. and work in the field before teach­ing. 
"A lot of people still don't have jobs, so graduate school is a good option," said Dalton. "Given the economy, it's a good choice." 
Bringing in the bucks 
After four years spending money on an education at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's, many graduates have decided it's time to start making some. 
Laura Ramirez, an accounting major, will move to Sacramento, Calif. after graduation to begin her new ·job with Ernst and Young. She will work as an auditor, visiting clients' worksites with a team to review their financial state­ments. While many seniors are strug­gling to find employment, Ramirez knew her post-graduation plans last summer when the company recruited her after an internship. 
"It's extremely exciting," she said of her new job. "There's a lot of uncertainty with what I'll be doing next year. There will be a lot of firsts." 
Other students' plans an~ more tenta­tive. Maria Conticelli. a Saint Mary's thP­
launch an acting career. The Atlanta 
native will visit a lot of companies once 
she arrives and hopes to land a part with 
a traveling theatre group, she said. 
"It's something that's hard to plan for," 
Conticelli said. "When you're starting out 
they recommend you start out in 
Chicago. New York and Los Angeles can 
be extremely overwhelming. It's almost 
better to get started in a smaller mar­
ket." 

Lee Svete, director of the Career 
Center, said that on average 53 to 60 per­
cent of students are employed after grad­
uation, in addition to those pursuing 
service and graduate education. This 
year, the number of employed students 
may be slightly lower, Svete said, as the 
slow economy steers more students into 
medical and law schools. 

"This has probably been one of the 
most compressed markets in a number of 
years," said Jeff Roberts, interim assis­
tant director of counseling and wordina­
tor of placement serviees at Saint Mary's 
Counseling and Career Development 
Center. "The upside is that the economy 
is still moving along. People are getting 
hired. There are opportunities. 
Tying the knot 

Everyone's headed into a mysterious future after graduation, but some seniors aren't going alone. It has been estimated that up to 60 percent of Notre Dame graduates and 1 in 10 Saint Mary's stu­dents will eventually marry a Notre Dame alumnus. 
for many students, the dream is to be married in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart on campus. This summer alone, the Basilica will host 3 7 weddings of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's graduates. However, only those who plan far in advance actually get the opportunity. Reservations open the first day of March the year prior to the event, and 90 percent of spots are filled on the first day. 
Most graduating engaged couples choose to wait a year or so before tying the knot. Senior Katie Ball and junior Todd Boruff, high school friends who began dating dur­ing Katie's sophomore year at Notre Dame, plan to wait until July 10, 2004 to have their cer­emony. 

Some engaged seniors have been dating since nearly the beginning of their time here, and still plan to go on to higher education prior to their wed­dings. Phil Tribble and Alison Troy. who met on the first day of classes freshman year, plan to get married after eontinuing their educations at Ohio University and Duke University. 
Wedding bells are ringing for Saint Mary's students as well. Graduating English literaturP and danr,p major Laura Bost interfaith services and sang together in vows or medical research, the graduates the choir before they started dating.

Season comes to an end in second round of the NCAAs 
 No. 21 Irish drop match 4-0 to No. 16 Vanderbilt 
ByJOE LINDSLEY Sports Writer 
A successful season came to a tough end for the No. 21 Irish as they fell 4-0 to No. 15 Vanderbilt in the second round of the NCAA Tournament May 10 in Nashville, Tenn. 
Notre Dame, who finished the season 16-9, began the match by losing the doubles point and then the bottom three singles matches. 
Playing without the services of senior captain Katie Cunha, Notre Dame enjoyed only one victory against Vanderbilt. The doubles duo of freshman Lauren Connelly and junior Alicia Salas topped their sec­ond ranked opponent in two days as they defeated Sarah Riske and Aleke Tsoubanos. For Connelly and Salas, it was their 13th win in 16 matches. 
Unfortunately, the team as a whole was not able to achieve back-to-hack victories in the NCAA tournament. The Irish began the route to the national championship by defeating No. 3 8 Missouri 4-1 in the first round May 9. 
Connelly and Salas got the Irish off to a promising start with their upset of the No. 15 doubles duo of Urska Juric and Katka Sevikova. Their win at No. 1 doubles clinched the point for the Irish and it marked the 12th time in the last 15 matches the Irish have done so. 
Lauren Connelly's younger sister, sophomore Sarah Jane Connelly, also had success in doubles. Paired with freshman Kristina Stastny, the Irish pair succeeded at No. 2. 
Junior Caylan Leslie and freshman Jennifer Smith fell at No. 3 doubles, and the chal­lenge continued for Leslie who fell to No. 36 Juric in singles. Leslie was ranked 39th. 
The Juric singles victory was the only point Missouri would earn though, and No. 94 Salas, Stastny, Sarah Jane Connelly, and Smith all contributed to the Irish win. 
Overall, the season was a good one for the young Irish team, which saw many suc­cesses including an upset of No. 20 Miami in the Big East Championships on the Hurricanes' home courts. That win was especially pleasing for the Irish who had finished their regular season down in Miami, but with a 6-1 loss to the Hurricanes. 
The title match of the Big East conference tournament 
between the Irish and Hurricanes included a doubles match that Irish coach Jay Louderback termed an "instant classic." 
The No. 2 doubles team of Sarah Jane Connelly and Stastny fought a scrappy Miami duo to triumph 8-6 in a match that had truly come down to the wire. Stastny and Connelly had reached a 7-1 lead, but Miami's Igna deVilliers and Abby Smith put up a strong rally to surge with­in reach of the Irish pair. In the end the Irish won, and the Notre Dame claimed the Big East title. 
An important moment of the season for both the team and especially for Cunha was the Ace for the Cure event, during which the then-19th ranked Irish defeated then-No. 13 Texas 6-1. The event was held to raise funds and awareness for colon cancer, which was the cause of the death of Cunha's mother last year. 
Notre Dame's record may not entirely reflect the team's suc­cessful season given that the Irish faced much of the nation's most powerful teams. Though they will be losing the leadership and services of Cunha, the team returns all the rest of the key players, many of whom will still only be sophomores next year.

Irish fall just short at Big East Championships, finish 2nd 
By HEATHER VAN 
HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame womens track and field team could not overcome Miami's domination in the sprints, as the Irish placed second in the Big East Championships by scoring 126 points to Miami's 166. Miami won individual championships in the 100 meters, 100 meter hurdles, 200 and 400 meters. 
Pittsburgh (94), Syracuse (70), Villanova (62) and Georgetown (62) rounded out the rest of the top six. 
In the distance events, freshman Molly Huddle was the Irish high­light, as she won the 5,000 meters easily (15:58.51), fihishing seven seconds ahead of second-place fin­isher Mary Cullen of Providence. In

the same race, Jennifer Handley took fourth. 
Meanwhile, in the field, Emily Loomis won the individual high jump title, clearing 1.75 meters. Loomis finally got an individual championship after finishing in the top three at the last three confer­ence meets. Loomis added the honor to her first team all-Big East volleyball and Big East Most Outstanding Player award given to volleyball players .. 
Also in the jumps, Tameisha King won the long jump. She proceeded to take third in the 100-meter hur­dles, good enough for all-Big East honors. 
However, the 4x100 meter relay team's effort to three-peat was thwarted, as they took third in 
45.80. The team of Tanya Cheatham. Kristen Dodd, Ayesha Boyd and Kymia Love was good enough for all-Big East honors. 
Lauren King also earned all-Big. East honors in the 1,500 meters, as she was edged by Georgetown's Treniere Clement at the finish. Clemet finished in 4:18.57, while King ended up with a time of 4:18.85. 
However, the season is not over yet for the team. A final outdoor tunc up, the Georgia Tech Invitational, is scheduled for next weekend in Atlanta. The NCAA Regional in Columbus, Ohio is set for two weeks later, May 30 and 31, and that meet will feature sev­eral Irish qualifiers. The NCAA Championship begins June 11.

"That is all I care With the Tigers backing into this weekend's regional tourna­ment after a disappointing per­formance at the Big 12 Tournament, the Irish head to Ann Arbor, Mich. riding a full head of steam. 

At last weekend's Big East Championship, the Irish won all four of their games to claim their second straight title. Third baseman Andrea Loman hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth to propel Notre Dame to a 3-2 victory over Villanova in the championship game . 
Loman earned the tourna­ment's Most Outstanding Player for the second consecutive year after hitting .500 in Notre Dame's four games. Loman also won the Big East Player of the Year award prior to the tourna­ment. Pitcher Heather Booth was voted the Rookie of the Year at the same postseason awards brunch. 
Booth, Loman, Megan Ciolli, Lisa Mattison and Meagan Ruthrauff were named to the all-Big East first-team. Mallorie Lenn and Andria Bledsoe were placed on the second-team.

With the defense in the top five nationally, the offense ranked 14th in batting average (.301) and 15th in runs scored per game (5.25) and the pitching staff possibly finding the right mix at the right time, the Irish are looking for a consistent team effort this weekend if they are going to qualify for their first­ever trip to the womens College World Series. 
"We have always been a good defensive team so we need to continue to do that," Loman said. "If we could get even more hitters to become hot at the right time at the regional tour­nament, we are going to be a tough team to beat." 
Notre Dame and Missouri played Thursday at 10 a.m. after The Observer went to press. A win would send Irish on to a second round game this after­noon. A loss to the Tigers puts the Irish one defeat away from elimination with their next game Thursday night.

Carrie Wisen (7-3, 1.78) has been used primarily as a reliev­er and Gumpf is not afraid to go to Wisen in tight, late-game situ­ations. The one area of concern has been Steff any Stenglein (1 0­4, 3.76) who struggled through most of the season. 
Over her past six appearances, Stenglein has rebounded, allow­ing six hits, giving up two runs, walking eight and striking out five in 12 2/3 innings pitched. G u m p f m o v e d

Looking to the future 
Even as Watson's eligibility · runs out at the end of this track season, the fate of the Irish cross country and track pro­grams appears to be on the right track from the impact that the senior has had. 
Watson has helped take a young and inexperienced Irish distance team and make it one of the best in the history of the program. 
"I think we were at a high point in 2001 in cross country," Watson said. "This year, we came down form that a little bit with a young squad, and even the older guys on the squad didn't have a lot of experience in cross country. But I think they matured so much through that cross country season and into the early indoor track sea­son, and I think they'll be even better the next year." 
Watson helped young, talent­ed runners such as freshmen Tim Moore and Vincent Ambrico and sophomore Eric Morrison develop from high school standouts into serious collegiate threats.

Ryan returned to tennis the

During her junior year, Ryan moved up to No. 5 singles and won the con­ference title and added her sec­ond MIAA title at No. 3 doubles. The Belles won another MIAA title as well. 
But when her opponents couldn't slow her down, the ulna bone in her right arm did. Ryan was diagnosed with a medical problem, similar to the one that ended professional tennis player Jimmy Connors' career. The ulna bone in Ryan's right arm was longer than normal and caused her problems when grip­ping the tennis racket. By the time her senior year arrived, many of the ligaments in her wrist were damaged and Ryan had to undergo surgery last September to correct the prob­lem. 
Ryan couldn't play tennis until January and the layoff put Ryan behind her teammates and opponents. Plus, Ryan was unsure whether she would be able to play at both doubles and singles. 
But when the season began, Ryan was there, playing both No. 5 singles and No. 2 doubles. This kind of determination is one of the biggest assets Ryan brought to her Belles team­mates. 
"She's very intense and has a never-give-up attitude," Stevenson said. "She always set a good example of how to work hard on the court for her team­mates."

Women surprise country with tournament upsets 

 Irish reach fifth Sweet Sixteen in last seven years 
ByJOE HETTLER Sports Editor 
All the trials and tribula­tions the Irish faced during the 2002-03 season finally paid off when the games counted the most. 
Left for dead after an up­and-down regular season, Notre Dame upset No. 6 Arizona then shocked No. 3 Kansas State at home in the first and second rounds of the NCAA Tournament to advance to its fifth Sweet Sixteen in the last seven years. 
The loss snapped Kansas State's 22-game home win­ning streak and sent Notre Dame to Dayton, Ohio where they lost to No. 2 Purdue, 66­47. 
But reaching the Sweet Sixteen seemed nearly impos­
sible after the kind of season 
Notre Dame endured. 
Irish coach Muffet McGraw played five sophomores and two freshmen with regularity throughout the season and had a player quit the team midseason. That lack of expe­rience and a difficult schedule made this season a trying one for McGraw and her team. 
The Irish opened the year winning seven of their first eight games, before being blown out by Tennessee in Knoxville, 77-61, Dec. 28. The late-December loss sent the Irish into a rough month of January where the Irish lost all four of their home games, including a 72-53 defeat to eventual national champion Connecticut. In all, Notre Dame went just 3-5 in January and hit rock bottom Jan. 4 when the team fell to Purdue on national television 71-54. 
"The Purdue game was the lowest point of our season," McGraw said weeks later.

But Notre Dame bounced back in February to collect a pair of victories over Big East foes, West Virginia and Georgetown, before falling to a tough Virginia Tech team on the road. The Irish contin­ued their solid play by win­ning five of their last six Big East games to finish the regu­lar season at 19-10. The NCAA selection committee rewarded the team with an 11-seed for the tournament and a trip to Kansas State to face Arizona and either host Kansas State or Harvard. 
The Irish raced past unsus­pecting Arizona thanks to the shooting of senior guard Alicia Ratay. Ratay, who had one of the most illustrious careers in Irish womens bas­ketball history, scored 20 points and grabbed nine rebounds, on a night when neither team could make shots, to lift Notre Dame to a 59-47 victory. Notre Dame held Arizona to a mere 22.3 field goal percentage for the game. 
Things didn't get any easier for the Irish in their second round matchup against the purple-clad Wildcats. Kansas State had lost just four games all season, none at home and had the potential to advance to deep into the tournament. Notre Dame made sure that didn't happen with, arguabiy, the biggest upset of the 2003 tournament. 
Behind another stellar defensive performance that held Kansas State without a field goal for more than 12 minutes in the second half, 17 points from junior guard Le'Tania Severe and clutch free-throw shooting down the stretch from freshmen Megan Duffy and Courtney LaVere, Notre Dame ended the Wildcats season, 59-53. 
"Coming into the game, I thought we got off to a great start," McGraw said after the win. "We tried to take the crowd out of the game early on and tried to limit their 3s. I thought we did a really good job of that in the first half. I was so pleased with our defense. I thought that's how we VllOn the game, a great defensive effort." 
After the season, forward Jacqueline Batteast was named to the second-team All-Big East, averaging 13.9 points and 8.3 rebounds per contest. LaVere made the freshman All-American team and Ratay was selected as a finalist for the National Scholar-Athlete of the Year as well. 
Ratay ended the year hitting 
46.3 percent of her 3-point attempts (50-for-108) and scored 12.1 points and­grabbed nearly five rebounds per game. She ended her Notre Dame career with the highest 3-point shooting per­centage in womens college basketball history, connecting on 47.6 percent of her 3­pointers. She also holds the mark for most 3-pointers made in Notre Dame history.

Last season, the Irish began their memorable run to the College World Series by winning the Big East Tournament for the first time in the program's histo­ry. In its first six years in the league, Notre Dame had often been the regular season leader. but struggled to fmd its groove in the post-season tournament. 
But that all changed last sea­son as the Irish pulled off a 3-2, 10-inning victory over Rutgers to capture the Big East crown and catapult into the NCAA post-sea­son. 
"That tournament has always been a tough tournament," Irish coach Paul Mainieri said. "Last year was the first time we've won it in seven years. It's always a tough tournament. You've got some underrated teams that are playing pretty close to home." 
This year, capturing that elu­sive Big East Tournament title could be even more important if the Irish are to make a run at returning to Omaha, Neb., for the 
~! College World Series. 
I I' "The Big East Tournament has always been a real dog-fight forr us. and this year should be no 
I different," Mainieri said. 
After beginning conference play 13-2, the Irish have strug­gled lately, losing four of their last six Big East games to two very tough teams in West Virginia and Rutgers, who cur­rently sit first and second, respectively. in the conference standings. 
It appears unlikely that the Irish will be able to capture the Big East regular season title, as they have in the three of the last four years, so the Irish \\<ill hope to take the conference tourna­ment title to impress the NCAA selection committee enough to award Notre Dame its third con­secutive year hosting an NCAA regional. 
Winning the tournament would also lock up an automatic bid for the Irish in the NCAA Tournament. 
"The automatic bid goes to the winner of the tournament, so if 
. you want to make sure you're in the NCAA tournament, you've got to win that thing," Mainieri said. 
If the Irish are unable to top the field of four teams in the Big East Tournament, which will include West Virginia, Rutgers, Notre Dame and most likely Virginia Tech, they will have to hope for an at-large bid into the 64 team field of the NCAA Tournament. 
"It's really hard to gauge what the selection committee is going to do," Mainieri said. "There have been years when we've fin­ished as low as third in the regu­lar season and received an at­large bid, and there's been years when we've won the regular sea­son and not received the at-large bid." 
Mainieri hopes that factors such as his team's tough sched­ule and recent history in the tournament will influence that

bid for an at large spot. 
''I'm hoping that if we can get 
over 40 wins and with the history 
of what we did last year, that that 
might carry some weight [with 
the selection committee]. ifin fact 
we do get an at-large bid," 
Mainieri said. "But I'm certain 
that if we don't win that tourna­
ment, we will still have to have a 
good showing out there and 
probably win at least a couple of 
games in the tournament." 
But right now, the Irish have another fierce opponent on their hands in the last weekend of con­ference play, as they must travel to Blacksburg, Va. to take on fourth-place Virginia Tech (32­19, 14-9 in the Big East). 
Coming off a tough 19-inning loss to Rutgers last Sunday, Mainieri hopes his team will bounce back against the Hokies and ride into the Big East Tournament on a winning streak. 
The Irish coach knows the importance of getting hot at the end of the season, and he hopes his team will catch that fire as the regular season yields way to the NCAA Tournament. 
"When I look around the coun­try, there's an awful lot of teams out there right now that are 35­18," Mainieri said. "I just think there are a lot of teams that are going to be in the running for these at large bids. So the more games that we can win this last week plus the Big East Tournament can help."

Irish squeak by Huskies for Big East Crown 
 Team looks

NCAA Regional 
By HEATHER VAN 
HOEGARDEN 
Spores Wrirer 
Since one Big East Championship was not enough for the mens track and field team, the Irish decided to repeat their indoor accom­plishment -by winning the Big East Outdoor Championship. 
The men won the Big East Outdoor Championship by a slim margin over Connecticut, 139 to 136.5 to become the first Notre Dame mens track team to win both the indoor and outdoor Big East Championships. 
"The Big East is a different meet from all the other meets," Notre Dame distance runner Eric Morrison said. "When you go there, you go there to do well individually, but the one thing that is always clear in your mind is to win the title as a team. In other meets, you might try to get a good time, or win a race, but it is never real­ly team-oriented." 
Contributing to Notre Dame's team victory was the stellar performance of three individu­als, who all garnered individ­ual championships. Highly­acclaimed senior Luke Watson won both the 3 ,000-meter steeplechase and the 5,000 meters on consecutive days. Selim Nurudeen won the 110­meter hurdles for the second year in a row (13. 95 seconds). Finally, in an upset, Godwin Mbagwu won the triple jump with a 15.32 meter effort. 
However, the Irish athletes were not the only ones being recognized. The Irish coaching staff was named the 2003 Big East Outdoor Coaching Staff of the Year. The staff consists of Joe Piane, Tim Connelly, John Millar, Scott Winsor and B.J. Linnenbrink. 
This staff led a talented squad that used a team effort to attain the conference cham­pionship. Ryan Hurd earned three points, finishing sixth in the 100 meters (21.59), while Ryan Postel added three of his own, taking sixth in the 400 meters (48.02). 
Meanwhile, in the distance realm, Morrison earned his second all-Big East honor of the year (indoor mile run), as he finished third in the 1,500 meters (3:50.65). Kevin Somok took sixth in the same race to give the Irish a combined nine points from the two. 
Despite the fact that Watson brought in 10 points for the Irish in the 5,000 meters, four other runners combined for 21 points in the event. John Keane took fourth (14:29.75). Tim Moore, fifth (14:35.09) and David Alber, seventh (14:38.83), respectively. 
Also scoring for the Irish was Mark Barber, who finished sixth in the 110-meter hurdles. 
The 400-meter hurdle group scored big for the Irish, as Napolean Suarez finished third to earn his first outdoor all-Big East honor, Barber took fourth and Roberto Garcia took sixth. 
Finally, in the relays, the 4x100 team (Nurudeen, Postel, Hurd and Barber) finished third to earn all Big East hon­ors, the first Notre Dame relay to do so since 2000. 
Also earning all-Big East honors was the 4x800 meter relay, who finished third. Thomas Chamney, Morrison, Somok and Vinnie Ambrico ran for the Irish. 
"The Big East meet is neat because everyone rallies together and puts together all the work they have put in the whole year," Morrison said. "That is basically what the Big East is all about." 
The Irish travel to the Georgia Tech Invitational next weekend for a tune-up before the NCAA Regional in Columbus, Ohio on May 30 and 
31. Following the Regional, the NCAA Championship begins June 11 in Sacramento, Calif. 
"After winning the Big East, we feel good, we feel confident going into the Regional," Morrison said.

Then, the Irish went to their strength and called on the "A­Team" of Andrea Ament and Alicja Kryczalo to finish the job. Kryczalo, who won her second individual national title in as many years, defeated Stanford's Iris Zimmerman to clinch the title for the Notre Dame and start the long-await­ed celebration. 
Besides Kryczalo's national title, the Irish had a school­record 11 All-Americans. Michal Sobieraj finished sec­ond in mens epee, Ozren Debic was fourth in mens foil and Ament took third to earn first­team All-American honors. Debic and epeeist Jan Viviani became four-time All­Americans. 
After the disappointments from finishing second or third every year since 1994, this year's team set itself out on a mission from the beginning not to join those other Irish fencing teams who underachieved and failed to win a national title. 
This year, they got the job done. 
"Coming into this year, I knew that like any other year we were going to end up in the top three," Debic said. "If we put our heads together, we could get it done."

Brey leads team to
Solomon accepts Bonnies' job 
 Irish assistant coach heads to St. Bonaventure 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
When St. Bonaventure started looking for someone to clean up the mess of an ugly basketball scandal, it turned to a Notre Dame assistant coach. 
Anthony Solomon, formerly 
a three-year mem­ber of Mike Brey's staff and a 15­year assis­tant coach, was named head coach of the Bonnies' belea­guered bas­
ketball program May 6. 
"St. Bonaventure is a tradi­tion-rich basketball program that really excites me," Solomon said. "With my 15 years of experience in the coaching profession, I feel that I have prepared myself for this opportunity." 
At Notre Dame, Solomon coached the guards and han­dled a majority of the recruiting. Brey promoted Rod Balanis, Notre Dame's former director of basketball 
operations, to fill Solomon's spot. 
"He's hungry, well-connect­ed and, most importantly, well-respected," Brey told the Associated Press. "I can't emphasize enough how the Solomon family will be such a positive for the Bonaventure community." 
Solomon replaces Jan van Brenda Kolff, who was fired in April after the Atlantic 10 Conference learned Bonnies center Jamil Terrell was inel­igible because he violated 
"St. Bonaventure is a tradition-rich program that really excites me. ,. 
Anthony Solomon fonner Irish assistant and current St. Bonaventure coach 
junior college transfer rules. 
The A-10 Conference then ruled St. Bonaventure had to forfeit six league vic­tories and banned them from postsea­son play. In response, the 

players voted to not play their final two games of the season. 
Both St. Bonaventure presi~ dent Robert Wickenheiser and athletic director Gothard Lane resigned in addition to van Brenda Kolffs firing. 
But St. Bonaventure's new athletic director, Paul Grys, had high praise for Solomon, who takes over a team that finished 13-14 last year. 
"Anthony Solomon has the leadership experience and 
character that are critical to St. Bonaventure," Grys said. 
Sweet Sixteen bid
The appointment is 
Solomon's first college head coaching job. He is also the first black head coach of any sport at St. Bonaventure. 
Notes: 

+ Former Arizona forward Dennis Latimore will transfer to Notre Dame and can begin playing for the Irish in 2004­05. 
A 6-foot-8, 240-pound play­er with two years of eligibili­ty remaining, Latimore must sit out an NCAA-mandatory one year before he can play for the Irish. 
+ The Irish landed their first verbal commitment of the class of 2008 in 6-foot-8, 210-pound forward Robert Kurz. 
The Philadelphia high school junior visited Notre Dame's campus a little over a week ago and decided to ver­bally commit to the school. Brey cannot comment pub­licly on Kurz until he signs a binding letter of intent in November. 
But the 6-foot-8, 210-pound Kurz is considered one of the top 100 prospects in the nation because he is a strong forward who has a solid medium-range jumper.

 Irish reach third round of tourney for first time since '87 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 

Mike Brey will have a hard time forgetting what transpired on his 44th birthday. 
In the bowels of Indianapolis' RCA Dome, in front of a throng of screaming Irish fans, in the national television spotlight, Notre Dame advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the frrst time since 1987 -the latest step taken by a basketball program slowly emerging as one of the nation's best. 
"Tonight, I was probably going to have a beer anyway," a giddy Brey said in the post-game inter­view. "Now I might have two." 
Sure, Arizona trounced the Irish in the round of 16. But the goal from the early days of sum­mer practice was to make it to the second weekend -a phrase that took on a life of its own over the course of the basketball sea­son. 
Behind the leadership of sharpshooting guard Matt Carroll and Maryland transfer Dan Miller, Notre Dame surged to a 5-1 start, yet flew below the national radar unranked and unrespected. 

And for good reason -Notre 
Dame had lost the nucleus of last 
year's team (Ryan Humphrey, 
David Graves and Harold 
Swanagan) to graduation, and 
most would have considered 
Notre Dame's season a success 
had the Irish simply made the 
NCAA Tournament, much less 
won a couple ofgames. 
That all changed in December. 
when the Irish knocked off three 
top-1 0 opponents in one week ­
Marquette, Maryland and Texas 
-and shot from "Others receiv­
ing votes" to No. 6 and the ensu­
ing pressure that accompanied 
such a lofty ranking. 
Suddenly, the Irish players, 
who had spent most of their 
careers playing as the underdog, 
now found themselves in the 
national spotlight. And for the 
most part, they handled it well, 
aside from a pair of blowout 
losses to Pittsburgh and 
Kentucky. 
But after Notre Dame beat 
Pittsburgh on Feb. 9 in the first 
meeting of top 10 foes in the 
Joyce Center in over a decade, 
the road to the Final Four 
appeared to run through South 
Bend. 
That's when the Irish train 
started to derail. Initially able to 
control their own destiny in 
terms of their Big East fate, the 
Irish lost four of their last seven 
games of the regular season and 
lost in the first round of the Big 
East Tournament. 
So in between the first-round 
exit and Selection Sunday, the 
Irish hunkered down to try to fig­
ure out what their problems 
were. And whatever they found, 
they appeared to fix. 
The first sign something had 
changed came the day before 
the NCAA Tournament began, 
when every Irish player shaved 
his head in a sign of team unity. 
Grinning with enthusiasm in the 
RCA locker room, Notre Dame's 
players displayed none of the 
tightness that characterized their 
final month ofthe season. 
Still, the Irish, seeded fifth in 
the West Region, survived a 
major scare in No. 12 WISconsin­
Milwaukee, who missed a layup 
with two seconds on the clock. 
Instead of getting upset, the Irish 
squeaked into the second-round 
with a 70-69 win. 
The second-round game 
against fourth-seeded Illinois, 
however. went much easier. The 
Irish relied on a commitment to 
defense and a sensational 3­
point shooting performance to 
surge into the Sweet Sixteen. 
"Everybody said we couldn't win because everything was so new, we should stick to what we were doing," Chris Thomas said. "But since we got away from the Big East, we have a new mind­set. It's a new season." 
A 88-71 loss to a red-hot Arizona team showed how far the Irish still have to go before they can truly be considered. Few doubt that Notre Dame's long-term future is bright. Its short-term future, however, is still in question, especially after Carroll and Miller's graduation and Thomas' declaration that he'll depart early for the NBA Draft. 
But then again, that's what everybody thought a year ago, too.

ry of the Notre Dame softball program. Entering this week­end's NCAA Regionals, Loman leads the 2003 Irish in batting average (.408), which would be good for the second best sea­son in Notre Dame history, runs scored (41), hits (64), dou­bles (12), RBI (40), slugging (.662), on-base percentage (.466) and stolen bases (17). Loman is also tied with out­fielder Liz Hartmann for the team lead in horne runs with eight. 
"I am losing someone who is irreplaceable," Gumpf said. "You can't replace someone like 'Drea." 
Rock solid 
In her first two seasons at Notre Dame, Loman played first base. She switched over to third last year and made the transition without a hitch due to her experience at third in high school and in travel leagues. As a junior, Loman made eight errors, but six of those carne after she broke a finger on her throwing hand in 
early April. 
This sea­
third in the country with 

a .976 fielding percentage. 
With the bases 60 feet away, the hot corner lives up to its nickname in softball as balls come quickly off the bat. Loman never looks surprised and is ready to always make a jaw-dropping play. 
"I might be a little biased, but I think she is the best third baseman in the country," Gumpf said. "She brings intan­gibles that most people don't have. Andrea is a natural. 
"She makes plays that most people can't make." 
When the inevitable offensive struggles come at the plate, Loman wants to be able to rely on something and always be a major contributor for her team. That attitude, of being a solid defensive player, started from the beginning. 
"Throughout the years, I've been really consistent defen­sively while offensively from my freshman to my senior year, I have been getting bet­ter, but haven't been that con­sistent and my defense has always been there," Loman said. "That's something my dad has always told me, if some­thing isn't working and your offense isn't there, make sure your defense always is. 
"So I think I really pride myself in that." 
One difference she wants 
During each of Loman's three previous seasons, the Irish have qualified for the NCAA Regionals and failed to move on to the Womens College World Series. In 2001, Iowa upset the top-seeded Irish and last year, the Irish were also eliminated on the last day of the regionals, this time by Nebraska. 
Loman's won the awards and accomplished just about every­thing a player could want. The only thing she hasn't done, is get to Oklahoma City, Okla. and play in the Women's College World Series. 
This weekend is her last chance. "You have been working hard 
your past .four years and com­ing up a game short almost every year. We are looking to have a good regional tourna­ment this year," Loman said. "It is definitely going to be tough and a challenge for us. 
"I think we have some people fearing us, which is good." 
That's the one place where Loman wants to separate her­self from Myers and the rest of the great players in Notre Dame softball history.

Thomas had until May 11 to enter his name for the draft. In addition to working out for indi­vidual teams, Thomas could als·o participate in a pre-draft camp the first week of June in Chicago, where a new NCAA rule change stipulates that players can play in pre-draft workouts without having to sit out any games if they return to college. 
However, Brey said Thomas is leaning away from playing in Chicago and is instead hoping to gauge his stock via individual workouts with teams. And Thomas is looking at the exam­ple set by Humphrey. who ended his college career pro­jected as a second-round pick but boosted his stock tremen­dously via individual workouts. 
For now, Brey will remain one of Thomas' primary advis­ers and added that he expects to start hearing from NBA teams now that Thomas has made a public decision. And instead of trying to convince his star guard to stay, Brey said his role as a coach is to make sure Thomas makes the best possi­ble decision. 
"My feeling is if you're going to run a program in this era, then you have to help your players," Brey said. "If the right thing is to go in a month, I will be the first in line to shake his hand."

Willingham guides Irish back to winning ways in '02 

their first of the season. A week  
later, Notre Dame had to mount  
a fourth-quarter rally to beat  
lowly Navy.  
Then, with the national spot­

California and a BCS berth  
hanging in the balance, USC  
absolutely embarrassed Notre  
Dame by tallying 610 yards of  
offense en route to a 44-13  
drubbing. Trojan quarterback  
Carson Palmer won the Heisman  
Trophy, USC secured a berth in  
the lucrative Orange Bowl and  
the Irish were left with a lot of  
questions and a Gator Bowl  
berth.  
The bleeding didn't end there.  
Another lopsided loss, this time  
a 28-6 beating at the hands of  
North Carolina State on New

appear a thing of the past.  
Yet Willingham and the Irish,  
who finished the season 10-3  
and ranked 17th, weren't  
deterred. And NFL teams took  
note of the Irish prospects, as  
seven Irish prospects -the  
most since 1999 -were select­ 
ed in the NFL Draft.  
And so Willingham, who main­

the latter stages of the season as  
he did in Notre Dame's hot start,  
remained confident the Irish

Tyrone Willingham leads the Irish football team onto the field before its game against Michigan Sept. 14. Willingham returned the Irish to success on the field in 2002, finishing with a 10-3 record. 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
Somewhere in between the New Year's Day 2002 press con­ference where he boldly pro­claimed the Irish would win and the celebration at Florida State where the Irish showed they could win, Tyrone Willingham found his groove at Notre Dame. 
Few could have blamed Willingham had the Irish contin­ued their mediocre performance from the Bob Davie regime. Few could have blamed Willingham, who became the coach the Irish came crawling to after they ini­tially passed over for George O'Leary, had he just waited a year for "Resumegate" to blow over. 
But, as Irish fans would rapid­ly discover, that's not Willingham's way. 
I 
The signs were there, of course. After all, Willingham concluded his first meeting with a single PowerPoint slide that had "WIN" printed in huge let­ters. 
Not until Willingham's Irish crushed defending ACC Champion Maryland 22-0 in the season opener, however, would Irish fans believe. 
The success didn't stay in New Jersey. Shane Walton knocked away a 2-point conversion late in the fourth quarter to preserve a 25-23 win against Michigan. Against Michigan State, backup quarterback Pat Dillingham threw a short pass to Arnaz Battle, who magically turned a 6-yard slant into a 60-yard touchdown with just over a minute left to snatch victory ­the team's first against the foe in six years -from the Spartans. 
"I just want to win," Willingham said after the Irish beat the Wolverines, one of five ranked teams the Irish played in 2002. ''I'm sorry it's so simple."

didn't wilt. The Irish appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated. "Return to Glory" wasn't just a T-shirt slogan, as national scribes applied the say­ing to Notre Dame's seemingly miraculous turnaround. 
After all, this was a team that had two losing seasons in the last three years. But, almost inexplicably, the Irish still found a way to win. Behind an oppor­tunistic defense -a phrase the unit loathed -that forced

OUTSTANDING SENIOR ATHLETES

 Watson steps out of the shadows to be Notre Dame's top runner 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Sports Writer 
Ask people what they consid­er the greatest accomplishment in sports, and running a four­minute mile is likely to be high on that list. 
For years, people thought the feat was impossible. But on \1ay 6, 1954, a now famous British physician named Roger Bannister shattered that belief by completing the mile race in 3 minutes, 59.4 seconds. 
In the 49 years since that day, nearly 1,000 people in the world have accomplished the feat.

 Loman leads by example to get the job done 
By MATT LOZAR Associate Sports Editor 

Compare Andrea Loman, The Observer's 2002-03 Outstanding Notre Dame Senior Female Athlete of the Year, to last year's recipient Jarrah Myers, and the score­book shows striking similari­ties. 
Throughout their four-year careers, both Loman and Myers played their way into the top five for batting aver­age, runs, home runs, walks, RBI, steals and fielding per­centage in the Notre Dame record book. 
But then you talk to softball coach Deanna Gumpf and she explains the two star players couldn't be any more difl"erent. 
"Jarrah was very intense and was the heart and soul of the while 'Drca is very a quiet leader. She gets in there and does her job," Gumpf said. "They are different types of leaders but effective. Two of the most opposite types of leaders." 
Myers needed to be more of a leader on the field, especially her senior year, calling her own pitches and catching a pitching staff that relied on two freshmen. This season,
