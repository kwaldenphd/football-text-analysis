Student Senate passes resolution allowing K of C to rent building 
nt:w~papt:r ~t·n·ing notre dame and ~aint mar.··~ TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27,1983 
By ELIZABETH FLOR 
News Staff 
The Student Senate passed a resolution last night allowing the Knights of Columbus to rent its space to campus organizations for social activities. 
The Knights of Columbus building is presently not being used on weekends. The administration has prohibited parties sponsored by the Knights of Columbus in the past because ofalcohol abuse and lack ofsupervision. To allow renewed use of the Knights of Columbus space, groups must observe a number of rules such as parietals. . 
Campus organizations holding parties will also have to check for Notre Dame or Saint Mary's identification, engage a supervisor such as a club adviser or the proposed Knights of Columbus chaplain, and provide Dean Roemer with notification ofthe impending party. Dorm-sponsored parties are also subject to Hall Presi­dents Council's alcohol guidelines and party rules. 
Dorms such as Lyons, Morrissey and Howard have limited party space, and the Knights ofColumbus build­ing is "probably the biggest party space on south quad," said Dave McAvoy, senator for district three. 
The head of the Knights of Columbus, Joe Anthony, supports the proposal to rent out the building's space for approximately $100 a night, which largely goes to charity. 
The Senate also passed a resolution which would al­low men to use the laundry facilities in women's dorms on a rotational basis. Each of the four women's dorms on each quad will open their laundry room one day, Monday through Thursday, from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. 
Recognizing the shortage of laundry facilities for men, student government is using the policy with "ulterior motives," hoping to spur the administration to act upon the need for more adequate laundry facilities. 
Teresa Ross, Student Senate Executive Coordinator, has received negative response, from the Hall Presi­dents Council as well as from women's dorms, towards the resolution. The rectoresses have not shown cooperation, saying that allowing men to use their laundry rooms is an inconvenience.

Oktoberfest to feature mix of old and new; root beer garden added 
By THERESA GUARINO 
StaffReporter 
A mixture of old and new events wil highlight this year's Oktoberfest, scheduled to take place Oct. 3-7 at Saint Mary's. 
The week will feature traditional activities such as hall decorating and a beer garden, and some new ideas including hayrides and a picnic. 
Oktoberfest, under the direction of the Saint Mary's student govern­ment, has been a tradition at the Col­lege since the early 1970s. Originally started as a one-night beer garden, it gradually expanded into a series ofevents that £he entire campus, not only students over 21, could participate in. 
Events for this year include a dorm-decorating contest sponsored by the halls. Decorations will be judged Monday by several Student Activities staff members. The win­ning hall will receive a cake and half­price admission to Oktoberfest's perennial favorite, "The Sound of Oktoberfest will end Friday with Music." two new activities, a bonfire and

Holy Cross chapel closed for renovations 
ByJOHN-JOHN AMORES 
News Staff 
The Holy Cross Chapel at Saint Mary's will be closed for the next few weeks for renovations which will almost double its seating capacity. 
The renovations will increase the seating capacity from 190 to 
350. In the past, temporary folding chairs have been used to seat large congregations, which Thomas Reid, director ofcampus minis­try at Saint Mary's, called both "uncomfortable and impractical." Chairs from the old Saint Mary's library will be used instead of the folding chairs. 
Sunday evening Masses will be celebrated in Regina Hall until work is completed. The chapel will reopen after midsemester break ifwork goes according to schedule, said Reid. 
It was decided to close the chapel and begin the work early in the year instead ofopening the chapel for a short period oftime and then closing it again when construction began. Other work has already been done in the chapel. The altar was moved from the west end to the south end and the chapel was repainted over the summer. 
The raised area on the west end ofthe church where the altar was previously located will be removed and recarpeted. This will level out the floor ofthe chapel and improve visibility. 
The pews will also be moved to increase seating space. On the south end ofthe chapel, another raised platform will be built for the new altar, and it will also provide room for musicians. The air con· ditioning units will be moved from behind the altar to the area below the east windows. 
The total cost of the renovation work will be approximately S2500, and the money will be taken out ofthe capital budget ofthe Saint Mary's Campus Ministry.

Why are you here? 

Now that those carefree sunny summer days have been replaced with the official weather of the fall variety, most students are seriously delving into their academic pursuits. 
First exams and papers are here. The library is filling up in the evenings. The lines in the engineering ..:om­puler lab make sunrise visits a common habit. Continu­ing to postpone that final trip to the bookstore is no longer academically economical. 
Soon mid-terms will arrive. And then the big push to December and finals. This is nothing unusual -it happens to every single class every year. 
Eventually, however, each of us has to sit down and consider why we are here and what our goals are. It is easy to lose one's path in the forest ofacademia. 
For many, getting into and arriving at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's was an end in itself. College was what naturally came after high school for most of us. What 
lies beyond these four years 
was perhaps not a considera­
tion. 
Why are you here? For many, that question is not as easy as it sounds. 
Ifyour life seems to he an endless chase for the ever­elusive ultimate GPA, per­haps you should reconsider. Most of the world (except for grad schools arid cor­porations) doesn't operate on a four-point system. 
Many people find them­selves caught up in the mainstream ofstudents who eagerly work toward the goal of the senior year inter­views, getting the big job, 
beginning the corporate lad­
der climb, and, a few years down the road, the church 
wedding and the white picket fence. 
This doesn't work for everyone however. 
If you really know why you are here and what you 
want to do after college, the battle is half won. And 
you're in the minority. 
If you are one of those lucky ones, frodflft;ere you llave to set your priorities. And, in some cases, academic methods may not be the best way. 
While abandoning classes in favor ofmore interesting 
pursuits may not be advisable (and may result in ex­
periencing the five-year plan), classes may not be the 
best ~ay to your goal 
While it's hardly news to most, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's are noticably lacking in certain areas of st1.1dy. For many, this means gaining the primary experience 
for future jobs outside ofthe cla'isroom, in so-called ex­
tracurricular activities.

Inside Tues 

In an atmosphere where classroom competition is al­most a varsity sport, this often leads to frustrating time conflicts. That is where priorities come in. 
Setting priorities involves sitting down to determine one's goals and establishing a balance between clas­swork and out-of-class work that will provide the best experience in the long run. 
What you may he lackin~ on your transcripts is not as important as the experience you have gained for such jobs. 
If you are certain that you want to venture into higher education or the corporate world, however, you must take the opposite approach. In this case, the almighty GPA might be your top priority. Accept it, buy a three-piece suit and cooperate. 
Ifyou find yourselfunable to answer "Why am I here?", now is the time for some serious thinking. Spending four years attempting one of the above approaches or vascillating between the two is useless. 
Don't get caught up in the rush to the business world 
unless you are really sure it is for you. Don't panic and show up at the IBM inter­views just because your roommate does. Becoming a small cog in the giant corporate wheel could mean a rather bleak life for someone. 
Setting some time aside, or even taking a year offfrom school, to explore your options is a sensible idea. Don't go into anything blind Talk to professors and profes­sionals. Get a summer job related to the fields in which you are interested. And once you make the decision, set your priorities according to the demands of that job. Rememberwhat you are aiming for is not just a diploma case, but a c:u-eer. 
Why areyou here?

Reagan to send letter to Hill 
Associated Press 
WA~HINGTON President Reagan plans to send congressional leaders a letter assuring them that they will be advised ofany change in the status ofU.S. Marines in Lebanon, sources on Capitol Hill said yester­day. 
Sources said the letter is designed to deal with a rising tide of com· plaint in Congress that the ad­ministration intends only to give lip service to a War Powers com­promise worked out with Congress. 
The compromise recognizes con­gressional authori~y to limit the commitment ofU.S. troops overseas, but authorizes the Marines to remain at their peacekeeping posts in Beirut for as long as 18 months. 
Reagan has said he will sign the resolution, but with reservations, if Congress passes it during a debate that began yesterday in the Senate. 
Grant program announced for research projects

Dean of Student Affairs james Roemer, who arrived at the scene a few minutes later, expressed his concern for Adalbert, calling him "a valuable part of the Notre Dame community." The 70-year-old Adal· bert has been with the Physics Department for almost 40 years and retired from teaching two years ago. 
"He was coming back from the Physics Department when the acci· dent occured," said Brother Paul Kelly, Adalbert's religious superior. 
Roemer also commended Torres 

for his actions. In a letter from the University, Torres was commended for "his quick and intelligent action and concern." 
"Torres' actions were in our finest tradition," Roemer said. 
"I never expected to use my CPR skills," Torres said. "CPR is good for everyone to know." 
Said Torres, "The incident makes me want to be a doctor all the more." 
Torres was noticeably moved by the incident. Yesterday afternoon he 
·said the accident was "all he had been thinking about all day. I haven't been able to concentrate on my classes at all. I just hope he's all right."

Student Body President Brian Cal­laghan hopes to change the focus of this year's United Way drive. Some dorms that give to other charitable organizations objected to the "horse-race"· style of the campaign. Callaghan wants to eliminate the printed competition between dorms and instead publicize United Way's large contributions to com­munity needs, such as Logan Center. "A lot ofpeople do not like the cam­paign because it comes across as a hard sell," Callaghan said. 
Student government will explain the need for on-or off-campus town houses for seniors at the Board of Trustees meeting in October. Cal­laghan proposed the area past Stepan as a good location. 
Callaghan also suggested, as a 
proposal to the board, allowing businesses, such as restaurants or gift shops, to occupy the space on the end ofGreen Field. 

Another concern is an under­graduate club similar to Senior Bar. However, student government will not propose this $1.5 million project until they see if the under­graduate nights at Senior Bar are suc­cessful. Callaghan said that the issues of financial aid and the computer system ought to be raised again. 
Last week, a group of students from both student government and the World Hunger Coalition met with the Nestle Corporation. Al­though Nestle has changed its marketing policies for the better, Callaghan said, the group would like to talk to the World Health Or­ganization about the changes. A revote on the boycott will take place this spring or next fall.

you." But mostly what he says is "poppa" which is what he said over and over again as he hugged me around the legs. Willie is a w;ar orphan. 

I met Willie when I and ;1 crew from ABC television came htrt· 10 do the requisite story about war orphans. It is ;mold story, as old as war itself: But w;ar orphans really arc El Sal­vador's bumpt:r crop. Somt: of tht:m arc sold, some just die, and many roam the strct:ts ht:g­ging from pt:oplc as poor as they arc. Some, the lucky ones, managt: 10 ).:Ct hert: -here bcin~-t an orphan<I).:C run by Kenneth Myers, a pric"t from Cleveland who ti>r<I).:CS in refugee centers for kids no one wants. He wants them. 
Willie is one of these. He hurst upon me when we entered the cottage where he lives with 1.-\ other children. He lunged at me, grab­bing me around the legs, saying "poppa, pop­pa" over and over again. lie was dressed in oversized orange shorts, a white T-shirt and sandals made of aquamarine-colored plastic I picked him up and swung him over my head and instantly about 4 Of 5 other kids barrelled into me, swinging from my legs like drunks from a lamppost, all of them calling me "poppa." 
Willie attached himself to me. When I walked outside into the sun, Willie followed. "Poppa, poppa," he said. 
"No," I said more to myself than to him. "lJnfortunatt:ly, I am not your poppa." Willie smiled. "Unfortunately," he mimicked. "Unfortunately." 
I knelt down to talk to him and instantly he was in my arms, hugging me. You cannot im­agine, after dealing with nothing hut death and war, how good it feels to hold a child, 'to hug and he hugged. And so the two of us held onto each other until other kids came and they joined in. There was a girl in a yellow dress and a chunky boy and maybe one or two others. It is tough to take notes when you are being hugged by lots oflittle kids. It is tougher still to say who needed the hugging more ­me or them. 
One of the kids, an older girl named Maria 
who watches the younger children, was asked 
how she was orphaned. She said the soldiers 
came, ordered her out of the house and took 
her parents away. She never saw them again. 
She was asked what she thought of war. Her 
response was to turn away and look into the 
mountain. 
This is a depressing place. In the cities, the poor live in ravines, their one-room homes made ofcorrugated steel, the roof~ held down hy bricks and rocks. In the countryside, the homes are sometimes made of branches and twigs woven together. The better ones are adobe and brick, tile roofs, hut no running water and often no electricity. 
It is hard to he optimistic There are so many poor people, so little wealth, so much violence and a foreigner, especially the new­comer. walks on the surface ofit, confused by 
everything, scared by much ofit, asking ques­
tions to get one answer one time and a dif­
ferent answer the next time. 

A country like ours sends down experts in everything. But the truth of the matter is that in more than a decade we have not been able to rebuild Newark or Detroit and now we have come here, where the problem is so much greater, to tell the Salvadorans how it should be done. 
This is why I like Willie and, by extension, this orphanage run by Father Myers. Here the tasks are simple -keep 145 children alive. Here the goals are neat and uncomplicated by politics. 
Willie looks into my sunglasses. He sees his reflection and studies it as ifit were something else. He touches the glass tentatively and then harder and then so hard that I fear he will damage it. "Stop," I say. 
"Stop," he laughs, and then he ambled offto play with some other kids and I never saw him again. 
Willie. Let me tell you about Willie. So far, he is the only thing here I really understand.

The Aussies beat Liberty despite Conner's decision to remove 924 pounds oflead ballast in a search for speed to offset the Aussie edge in light winds. He guessed right on the winds, which blew southerly at 8 knots, but it did him no good. 
Instead of being the first U.S. skip· per in 46 years to win the Cup twice in a row, the 4I-year old drapery manufacturer from San Diego is the first ever to lose it for the United States. 
The Australians now are expected to defend the Cup against the United States and other countries in I986. 
The fiesty, 47-year-old Bond, whose turbulent pursuit of the "Auld Mug" paid off after SI6 mil· lion and four tries, said he will not go to the New York Yacht Club's Man· hattan mansion to pick up the Cup today because his crew is com­mitted to a filming session.

The ND-SMC Sailing Club was very busy this 
past weekend, as two teams travelled to two different regattas. Tom 
Fink, Dan Dressel, and Barb Blanchette raced in the M.C.S.A. Sloop 
Championships in Detroit, finishing in fourth place. The second 
team ofBrian Rieck, Pete Sobol, Paul Kramer,Jim Gillies and Priscil&aiJ· Karle raced in the Kent State (Ohio) Black Squirrel Regatta. The "A" Division was close and ND-SMC came in second place due to a protest. The "B" Division was also close and ND-SMC finished in second again, this time by two points. Overall, ND-SMC finished second in the regatta. -The Observer 
continuedfrom page 8 

To thwart the Wildcat, the now smaller Notre Dame pack of runners employed a quite effective tech­nique. Depending on who felt the strongest at a particular point in the race, that runner would assume the lead and pick up the pace. 
In other words, when Caron would get tired of leading the pack, Juba w t ould take over. When he became tired, Dillon would assume the front spot, and so on. 
Unable to defend himself against this type ofphysical and psychologi­cal warfare, the Northwestern run­ner fell off the pace. He then watched the leading pack of four Irish runners from a distance of 60· yards back as they crossed the finish line together in 24:42. 
After Northwestern's top man finished in fifth, Tyler and Courtney finished sixth and seventh, respectively. 
John Adams and Craig Maxfield also ran competitive races. Adams came in eleventh place, while Max· field finished twelfth. 
Mike Collins, an outstanding freshman who was Notre Dame's fifth man at Ohio State, hurt his leg and did not compete. 
Coach Piane expressed his opinions on the race. 
"We had a pretty good week of training but I didn't think we'd win that big. And our guys can even run faster. I'll guarantee it." 
"We weren't a hundred-percent going into the r~ 'said Juba. "Ralph (Caron) was fighting a cold," he continued, "and I tore some car· tilage in my chest." 
At this point it is very difficult to say just how good this cross country team is. In any case, injuries do not stop them. 
It is apparent that in team com· petition the whole is greater than the sum ofits parts. Anyone who has seen Notre Dame cross country would know this. 
This week, the team is looking toward the National Catholic Meet, which will be held at 4 p.m. Friday on Burke Memorial Golf Course. The Irish contingent is aiming to up· set pre-race favorite Marquette. 
Anyone who thinks that team spirit has been rendered extinct should attend the meet.

13-yard screen to Bell and followed 
that up with a 16-yard toss 
downfield to classmate Alonzo Jef­
ferson. 
When the drive stalled, another missed field goal attempt once again failed to put points on the board for the lrbh. 
Overcoming sacks and penalties on his final possession, Beuerlein's poise and ability to come through in clutch situations was showcased on national television. He had already ran for one first down on a third and long situation, and passed for a first down on another. 

Steve Beuerlein 
In this series he would convert three third-down and two fourth­down situations into first downs while passing for 81 yards in the drive against the first-team Miami defense. 
On a fourth-and-five from the Notre Dame 25-yard line Beuerlein completed a nine-yard pass to Joe Howard to keep the drive alive. On a third-and-three, Beuerlein ran the 
ball himself for five yards. After a penalty and a sack, Beuerlein made perhaps the play of the game on a fourth-and-18 situation when he drilled a bullet to Milt Jackson 21­yards downfield between two Hur­ricane defenders. 
Two plays later Beuerleln came through under pressure again when

he fired a 25-yard pass to Alvin Mil­ler on a third-and-19 situation. 
Beuerlein converted another third­
down situation as he took the team 
to the Miami four-yard line, but the 
drive finally stalled when he was 
sacked on fourth down. Still, it was a 
performance that earned the 
plaudits of coaches, players, and 
viewers alike. And it was one that in­
evitably led to comparisons. 
"People have mentioned to me that the last quarterback to wear number seven at Notre Dame was Joe Theismann," chuckles Beuer­lein. 
But if one watched closely, Beuer­lein does seem to possess not only the poise on the field ofTheismann, but many ofthe physical traits. Same lithe figure. Same youthful choir-boy face. Same well-groomed blond hair. 
"Same big nose," cracks Beuer­lein. 
"I wore number seven in high 
school too, so I consider it my num­
ber, not anyone else's. I want to 
make my own name here." 
He got offto a good start last Satur­. day, but realizes that it may be 
unwise to pressure himself into any­
thing to soon. 
"My first goal this year was to feel 
comfortable with the system," says 
Beuerlein, "and then I sort of set a 
second goal within myself to be the 
top back-up quarterback by the end 
of the year. I do have great con­
fidence in the system. Blair and the 
coaches have just been super in helping me out, but I've got a lot more to team. I just want to con­tinue to grow and develop well as a quarterback here this year." 
ST. LOUIS (AP) -Bob Forsch 
pitched the second no-hitter of his 
career and the first in the National 
League in exactly two years, giving 
the St. Louis Cardinals a 3-0 victory 
over the Montreal Expos last night. 
The Expos, who were mathemati­
cally eliminated from the NL east 
pennant race yesterday afternoon 
when Philadelphia beat Chicago 5-2, 
came close to getting a hit only 
once. 
Tim Raines hit a long drive to left­
center that Cards' center fielder 
Willie McGee caught after a long 
run. Raines also hit a warning-track 
tly ball in the seventh that easily was 
caught by David Green in right field. 
Forsch retired the first five batters 
before hitting Gary Carter in the left 
arm in the second. St. Louis second 
baseman Ken Oberkfell then booted 
Chris Speier's grounder, allowing 
Carter to move to third, but Forsch 
got the first of his six strikeouts to 
end the inning. 
Then Forsch retired the final 21 
Expos to complete the no-hitter, I 
matching his performance of April 
16, 1978, when he whitewashed 
Philadelphia 5-0. 
The last NL no-hitter was Nolan 
Ryan's ecord fifth, Sept. 26, 1981, a 
5-0 victory for Houston over the Los 
Angeles Dodgers in the Astrodome. 
It was the second no-hitter of the 
season in the major leagues. Dave 
Righetti of the New York Yankees 
pitched the first July 4 at Yankee 
Stadium, 4-0 against the Boston Red Sox. 
In the ninth, Forsch, 9-12, struck out pinch-hitter Terry Crowley, who argued after the called third

strike on a 2-2 count. Then Terry 
Francona flied out routinely to 
Green and Manny Trillo made the 
final out on a grounder to Oberkfell, 
who moved to third base in the 
eighth inning. 
The crowd of 12,457, the third­
smallest of the season in St. Louis' 
Busch Stadium, cheered loudly all 
through the ninth and gave Forsch a 
standing ovation when Trillo was 
retired. 
Forsch also is half of the only brother combination in the major leagues to have a no-hitter. His brother Ken, now with California, pitched a no-hitter on Opening Day in 1979 for Houston against Atlanta. 
St. Louis scored all its runs in the fifth inning. After Green led off with a walk, Jim Aducci grounded out and Ozzie Smith ripped an RBI single up the middle. 

Smith took second on the throw to the plate, and Lonnie Smith followed with a run-scoring double. 
Oberkfell  walked  and  McGee  
capped the  uprising with  an  RBI  
single to right.  

The Cardinal runs came off Montreal starter Steve Rogers, 17­12, who suffered his fourth loss in his last five decisions. 
Montreal pitcher Dan Schatzeder, who started the sixth, was ejected af­ter hitting Andy Van Slyke. The ejec­tion was automatic, because Wendelstedt had issued the pre­vious warning.

By lOUIE SOMOGYI 
Sports Writer 
On a night when Notre Dame 
football fortunes themselves 
became dark, at least one shining ray 
of hope burst through. 
Freshman quarterback Steve 
Beuerlein, showing amazing poise 
and great potential, became the 
youngest Notre Dame recipient of 
the Chevrolet "Most Valuable 
Player" award that is presented on 
national telecasts. 
Although Beuerlein played in only three of the Irish possessions, the team put together drives of 72, 44, and 76 yards (before losing seven yards on the final play) under his guidance. With Beuerlein at the helm, the offense registered exactly halfofthe team's 22 first downs, and also amassed 185 of the 335 total yards. In all, Beuerlein completed 13 ofhis 2 3 passes for 14 5 yards. 
It marked yet another impressive 
stride this fall for the Fullerton, Cal. 
native, who had been working with 
the second unit ever since the 
second week of practice. 

With Todd Lezon, Scott Grooms, and fellow freshman joe Felitsky all hampered or recovering from in­jury, Beuerlein has received extra tutoring in the past weeks from of­fensive coordinator and quarterback coach, Ron Hudson. 
"He's still learning," says Hudson. "By no means is he proficient yet in reading defenses and the many dif­ferent coverages that exist in college football." 
Stlll, Hudson admits that there is definitely a chance for Beuerlein to see action against Colorado since "he merits an opportunity." 
"He's got a good sense for dis­
tributing the ball to different 
receivers when one isn't open," says 
Hudson, "and he doesn't appear to 
force the football. He just needs 
repition." 

Beuerlein credits some of his present success to the drop-hack pro-style offense he says he worked with at Servite High School -which finished third in the nation last year. 
Working with some top-flight receivers, Beuerlein completed I 50 ofhis 256 pass attempts in his senior year for 2,244 yards and 21 touch­downs while garnering all-America honors. 
"Our system was pretty ad­vanced," says the 6-3, 195-pound Beuerlein. "I think it gave me a headstart. It taught us to read routes according to what the defense gave us -which is what the college game is based on. Most high schools don't 
do that."  
The  f eshman  maintains  
perspective  about his future,  
though.  

"I'vego& a, million thiRgS to learn," admits Beuerlein. "I really have to work on reading the many different coverages and on not forcing my passes. I also need to become strong­er, so I'll work out a lot during the off season in order to put on about 1 5 more pounds." 
His confidence, however, is not in doubt. Throughout the contest, Beuerlein's great poise under fire was constantly marveled at by the television announcers. 
"I do have a lot of self­confidence," says Beuerlein. "And it's important to get that confidence across to the rest of the guys in the huddle." 
That confidence and poise was evident from the moment he took the field in the Orange Bowl. 
"I wasn't really nervous," he recalls. "The coaches told me earlier in the week that I would get to play because ofthe humidity factor down there, so I was kind of prepared. I . just tried not to get excited or make any mistakes." 
Facing a third and eight situation in his first series from the Notre Dame 19-yard line, Beuerlein faded back to pass and was immediatly confronted with a strong Miami rush. He managed to scramble out of danger and pick up the first down. While still down, he was viciously speared. 
"I guess that was my initiation into college football," says Beuerlein. "I was seeing stars after that" 
It was at this point that many viewers began seeing the freshman as a potential star himself. 
The team got down to the Miami nine-yard line before missing a field goal on that first possession, but it was in the second possession that Beuerlein's talent came into greater evidence. On a third-and-18 situa­tion, Beuerlein drilled a 23-yard pass down the middle to Greg Bell. 
One play later, Beuerlein tossed a
