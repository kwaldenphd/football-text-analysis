Yl:Stl:rday l:Vl:ning in Washington Hall, fr. Thn>dore lksburgh gan· his 30th and tina! annual spl:n:h as prl:sidl:nt of thl: faculty. lksburgh thankl:d the faculty for making the University what it is. and l:m­phasizcd the. point that a student af­fects a university for only ti>ur years. whereas the faculty forms the atmos­phere: that makes a student want to come. He stated that the facilities of a university arc nothing if not employed by the competent hands of willing faculty. 
Hl:sburgh said that his goals 

·during his tl:nure as President "focused on the creation of a grl:at Catholic university here at :"'lotre Dame." The pfl·sidcm cxtcndl:d his 
gratitudl: to thl: faculty for thdr 
sharl:d cxpl:rienLT. 
Hl:sburgh spoke of thl: futun·. ofa \·is ion of "what yet might be." ~k stressed thl: need to continuL· thl· growth of the University saying that 
even though the fund raising cam­paign initiated 1 0 years ago has l:XCcc.:dl:d expectations by HO mil­lion dollars. this is not the time to rest. The prl:sidl:nt said that a new drin· will bl·gin this ~Tar. PACE (Priorities and Commitments to Ex­cclkncc ). in order to preserve the Notre Dame community. 
He said, "It is easier to lJL· a grl·at university and not a Catholk univer­sity as welL" \'ct Notre DanK must continuL· in its tradition to sustain moral l:lldl:avors and to cherish values, according to the presidelll who stressed that the univnsity has

Iksburgh asknl the faculty to :-.l·t the standard for this special en­deavor saying thq· should commit thcmsdves to the special vision of the unin-rsity. 1 k also said that thl· real progress in this aspect is due to the numl·rous faculty who give tlu: 
living cmbodimclll of thl: Catholic vision to thl· schooL 
In the coming years, said ll~:s­burgh. Notrl· Dame facl:s a challenge and if the school and th~: pl·opk in it arc not prepared to cherish this vi­sion. the university may loSL' its Catholic goals. Through visions, drl·ams. faith and courage. Hcsburgh said the dual l:ndcavor of being a great Catholic university will hl·coml' reality.

Fifteen people were killed in fighting between 
two Zulu clans using guns and spears, a police spokesman said yester­day. An acute shortage of land in the Mshinga district has intensified fighting, which has left 840 of the nation's 5. 5 million Zulus dead in the past four years.

Angolan PresidentJose Eduardo dos Santos met with East German chairman Erich Honecker on yesterday to discuss the Communist government's support for the Soviet-backed regime in Africa. The official ADN news agency said Angola and East Germany were "bound together in friend1:>hip and solidarity." East Germany has been among the most active Soviet bloc states in pursuing contacts with left-leaning states in black Afric<!. The East Berlin government strongly condemned the recent armed incursion by South African forces into Angola. South Africa said its action was directed at black nation3list guerrillas seeking an independent Namibia, also called South-West Africa. -AP

School Board is considering 'A'hether to ban a book from its high school. The book in question is William Golding's "Lord ofthe Flies," which one parent wants removed from the high school curriculum. "The school board has the right to take any book off the shelfthey fed they see fit to remove," Superintendent Donald Rykhus said. "I think we should be able to censor what our kids see." Last spring, the board voted to remove the award-winning "Run, Shelley, Run" from its library because ofwhat it called "vulgar explanations" in the book and because it was "in very poor taste." -AP

Sub-zero temperatures and sleepless nights 
plagued two pilots who completed the first transcontinental flight in a helium balloon, but the thrill ofthe landing more than made up for that, they said yesterday. "It was an adventure ...," said pilot John Shoecraft, who talked to reporters along with co-pilot Fred Gorrell the day after their historic landing in Super Chicken III. "It was just very thrilling to us." The two Arizona businessmen had gotten their first full night's sleep 

since leaving Costa Mesa, Calif., on Friday for the 2,515-mile trip.

Anclretti appeals USAC ruling 
By STEVE HERMAN 
Associated Press 
.\1ario Andretti said yesterday he is appealing to the U.S. Auto Club last week's ruling that made Bobby Un­ser the winner of the Indianapolis ';00-mik race. 
Andretti was declared the winner when a one-lap penalty was imposed against Unser a day after the :\1ay 2-l race. But a special USAC panel rukd last Thursday that the penalty was too severe and instead ·tined him 
S-iO.OOO fi>r passing a line of cars as 
he left the pits during a yellow cau­
tion period.

was based on the contention that "the court of appeals conducted the procedure in violation oft.:SAC rules book in that they did not give ade­4uate notice of the hearing to all concerned parties." 
Bowman told The Associated Press, "\X'e had a right to receive notice of the proceedings. The same notice that Penske Cars Ltd. (Unser's racing team) received or the Indy =;oo stewards received, in order to participate in all of the pretrial 
procedures in time to make objec­
tions to the constitution of the 
panel. to participate in pre-trial 
agreements and prepare for the 
hearing." 

Although the scheduled hearing 
was well publicized hefore it con­
vened in june, Bowman said "the ac­
tual notice (to Andretti) was a 
telegram the morning the hearing 
started."
