ND student assauI ted at Commons 
By MONICA YANT 
News Editor 
A Notre Dame student was assaulted and robbed early Thursday morning in the park­ing lot of The Commons, 826 Eddy St. 
The student was treated at St. Joseph Medical Center for a laceration to the head and abrasions to his face, according to Chuck Hurley, assistant director of Security. 
He was released to University Health Services at approxi­mately 6:45 a.m. 
The victim was leaving the bar with three other friends when the incident occurred, Hurley said. He told the South Bend Police that he was as­saulted by a white male with brown hair, approximately 6 feet, 2 inches tall and 200 pounds. 
The suspect was accompanied by two other males, who kept the victim's friends out of the incident, according to Hurley. 
The victim told officials he may have been hit by a beer bottle. He reported the loss of his wallet and watch. 

South Bend Police are investi­gating the incident.

An "unduplicated" number of Notre Dame students received a record-high amount of fmancial aid last year, according to a report issued by the office of financial aid. 
Financial aid received by Notre Dame students reached a record $66.6 million in the 1990-91 academic year, up eight percent from the previous year, the report said. The num­her of students receiving aid was 7,176 out of a total en­rollment of 10,016, an increase of three percent from 1989-90. 
Last year's record numbers are a "direct reflection of the increase in cost, which has gen­erated an increase in need for help," said Joseph Russo, direc­tor of financial aid. 
Russo said he is pleased with the increased aid, but the Uni­versity is still short of its goal to meet the full financial need of every student. 


Church must appeal to Hispanics, says Vidal 
By JULIE BARRETT 
News Writer 
Half of the Catholics in the United States will be Hispanic by the year 2000, according to a representative of the Cushwa Center for the Study of Ameri­can Catholicism. 
At the same time, many of these Hispanic Catholics are converting to Fundamentalist churches, finding them more attuned to their needs and con­cerns than the U.S. Catholic Church, said Jaime Vidal, assis­tant director of the Cushwa Center. 
Part of the problem is that there is a large, continuous flow of Hispanic immigrants into the United States, and many of these people are reluctant to replace their language and customs for American ones, explained Vidal. 
"American culture tends to be very absorbent," said Vidal. "Americans have a problem with immigrants who don't be­come gung-ho Americans 24 hours off the boat." 
Fundamentalist churches are more appealing to Hispanic immigrants than the American Catholic Church because they "are willing to welcome [Hispanic immigrants) as they are, without demanding that they become American Chris­tians overnight," said Vidal in a recent article he wrote for Mi­gration World magazine. 
Vidal said that the establish­ment of Spanish parishes in the American Catholic Church would be an important step in maintaining the Hispanic Catholic following.

THE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER SERVING NOTRE DAME AND SAINT MARY'S 
By SANDY WIEGAND Associate News Editor 

South Bend Police Lieutenant Norval Williams will not serve a three-day suspension Police Chief Ronald Marciniak handed him for alleged violations of the police department duty manual after the arrests of Notre Dame football players Rick Mirer and Demetrius DuBose. 
The South Bend Board of Public Safety, a three-member committee of citizens appointed by the mayor, reviewed Marciniak's allegations Wednesday, after Williams ap­pealed to that body. Marciniak had claimed Williams violated six regulations in the depart­ment's manual. 
The city attorney's office prepared a brief explaining Marciniak's allegations, and Williams' attorney a brief in Williams' defense. The board did not have the option of re­ducing the term of the suspen­sion, according to Elmer Carr, president of the board, but was confined to approving or reject­ing it. 
Among the violations Marciniak cited, Carr said, was Williams' statement to local

media that Mirer and DuBose, charged with public intoxica­tion and disorderly conduct, did not seem intoxicated at the time of arrest. These charges were dropped, but DuBose was charged with underage drink­ing. 
Marciniak also accused Williams of intimidating the ar­resting officer, Carr said. The evidence supporting Marciniak's claims "didn't have weight for that long a suspen­sion," Carr said. "I think some of the statements saving to do with violating the rules were exaggerated. Some things in the manual simply didn't apply; they were inappropriate." 
A reprimand from Chief Marciniak would have been more in keeping with the sever­ity of the violations, according to Carr. 
Williams said that although he regrets the negative publicity the incident has generated, he stands by his actions. "My opinion was that they were not intoxicated to the point that they should have been incarcerated," he said. "I

and University student employment. 
Federal assistance to ND students totaled $22.6 million, taking the form of ~ants. work­study programs, and student loans. 
Russo estimated the average ND-administered scholarship amount at $3,150 per year, most going to either Notre Dame Scholars or minority Holy Cross scholarships. The number

Bush signs civil rights legislation 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Bush signed a civil rights bill Thursday that he said would "fight the evil of discrim­ination," and tried to silence a ney.r furor over race by with­drawing a tentative order to end government hiring prefer­ences for blacks and women. 
"For the past few years the issue of civil rights legislation has divided America," Bush said. "No more." 
But the political divisions that sustained a two-year congres­sional fight over the civil rights bill, and prompted Bush to veto a similar measure last year, remained sharp. 
The new law negates Supreme Court decisions that made it more difficult for minorities to win lawsuits 
see BUSH I page 4 
University tuition, fees, and room and board increased from $14,700 in 1989-90 to $15,990 in 1990-91, an 8.8 percent increase, according to Russo.

ThiS year's total 1s $17,350. 
The rising costs of attending NO prompted the Board of Trustees in 1990 .to pursue a long-range goal of meeting the full financial need of all stu­dents, said Russo. 
Since then, University-admin­istered scholarships have in­creased from $5.4 million to $6.2 million for last year. In addition, ND scholarships ben­efitted 1,996 students, up from 1,886 in 1989-90, Russo said. 
The $6.2 million in University scholarships is part of $3 7. 7 million in non-federal assis­tance received by ND students. The rest of the financial aid takes the form of outside scholarships, alternative loans, grants-in-aid, tuition remissions

To answer or not to answer? 
Phone calls on campus------­
can generally be categorized into two types, the double ring and the single ring. The double ring represents someone who is calling from off campus (unless you have a 

brilliant roommate, who is Alissa Murphy well aware of your Ad Design negligence towards single Manager rings and cleverly dials the------­prefiX before the extension). These phone calls are usually answered immediately after the first double ring. 
The single ring, on the other hand repre­sents an on-campus caller and is usually answered only on occasion, especially when one is extremely lonely and has not received a double ring for a number of months. Warning! This way of distinguishing rings might lead to some confusion, especially when one returns home for break. 
Double rings can further be divided into two general groups: those who you want to talk to and those who you don't. , 
Those who you want to talk to ... 
1. 
The Family-Although this group can sometimes fit into either category, it's a re­liable .. double-ringer" and maybe the only one you receive, so learn to appreciate it. 

2. 
The Significant Other-If you don't have • one, you can automatically proceed to number three. 

3. 
Long-Distance Friends-The best part of a double-ringer from a long-distance friend is that you don't have to foot the bill and believe me, this can be quite cost-efficient. Unfortunately, most of my long-distance friends are in the same financial state as I am, making the most readily used form of communication the pen. 


Since I have just about exhausted the double rings from those you want to talk to, I will continue with the second category. 
Those you don't want to talk-to. 
Because of the magnitude of this category, I have selectively chosen the top two double­ringers I least enjoy receiving. 
1. 
Larry the local-Larry is the generic name for any random guy who tried to pick you up the night before. Although he swears that he found your number in the men's bathroom of the nearest local establishment. your best friend secretly reveals she just couldn't resist the ten bucks. The best way to deal with this type of phone call is to hang up. 

2. 
Obscene calls-This category can some­times be grouped with the previous one, although they usually tend to be a little more intense. These double-ringers are usually characterized by few words and a lot of heavy breathing. If the caller does try to fool you by stating he is from the school laundry service and that some of your lingerie is now in his possession, inform him that this is impossible, for you rarely wear underwear, and when you do it's only on special occasions. He will most likely think you are more of a pervert than he is and hang up. 


Mter carefully analyzing the pros and cons of both single rings and double rings the question still remains should you answer the phone or shouldn't you? I'll let the receiver decide.

U.S. puts pressure on S. Korea 
•SEOUL, South Korea-The United States today stepped up pressure on N. Korea to stop developing nuclear weapons by postponing plans to withdraw thousands of troops from S. Korea. The announcement by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney indicates increasing impatience in Seoul and Washington over N. Korea·s refusal to open its secretive nuclear and reprocessing facilities to inspections. The communist north denies any nuclear weapons program, but U.S. officials say Pyongyang is nearing completion of an atomic bomb. North Korea reportedly agreed in principle Wednesday to a call to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. 
But the reported accord, in working-level talks between the two Koreas, was not binding.

"We checked with his office just a few minutes ago, and he still hasn't made us his mind," Quayle said. He followed up with another one-liner, saying Cuomo has just now gotten around to deciding between Beta or VHS video recorders. "If come­dians like me, they're going to love Mario Cuomo," the vice president said. Quayle's comments came just hours after Cuomo shot back at Quayle for repeatedly calling him just plain "Mario." Cuomo dubbed Quayle "Danny" the cabin boy on the Titanic.

Glenski was in fair condition yesterday in St. Joseph's Medical Center and has been moved out of in­tensive care, said Hurley.

fects of El Salvador's civil war on its people. 
"Art in the past has not taken sides on justice issues." said Douglas Kinsey, professor of rme arts. "It is difficult to have that concept" incorporated into the work of art and its complexity. 
"I think that, as an artist, it is almost necessary to deal with issues that are really upsetting (to the artist). It is difficult to understand artists apart from that," added Kinsey, an artist himself. 
The panel's remarks con­cerned the exhibition "Stories from Salvador: Photographs by Steve Moriarty" which is on display in O'Shaughnessy Gal­leries East in the Snite Museum of Art. Moriarty, an adjunct as­sistant professor in the Arts and Letters core course, and Ben Giamo, assistant professor in American studies, joined Kinsey in the panel discussion, titled "Art, Morality, Journalism: Do They Mix?" 
The exhibition is an attempt to help the Salvadoran people tell their story "as I see it," said Moriarty. 
Giamo said that Moriarty's photographs "restore photog­raphy's clarity and power as a medium of social documenta­tion and aesthetic expression. They are at once affirmative and disturbing, genuine and horrific, dignified and disheart­ening." 
The forty black and white photographs themselves both show "all the tragedy of the civil war in El Salvador and the forces at work to reconstruct," Moriarty added. The pho­tographs tell the story of a people who, though threatened with death every day, hold out hope for the future, he said. 
The photographs are "pieces of art generate contradiction. Its (a photograph's) immediacy makes me uncomfortable. The subject matter is upsetting while the photograph is artisti­cally pleasing," said Kinsey. 
Giamo concluded that it is possible to blend social justice issues and aesthetic qualities in a photograph. 
Moriarty graduated from Notre Dame in 1969 and re­turned to receive his Master of Fine Arts degree in Photogra­phy in 1980. He has visited El Salvador seven times since 1985 in order to capture the people's story on film.

Artist performs satiric act 
By MALIA MUELLER 
News Writer 
Dressed in black jeans, shirt and leather jacket, artist and musician Terry Allen revealed a satirical outlook on life during a lecture and performance sponsored by art and art his­tory and design last night. 
Allen, who grew up in West Texas, performed country mu­sic from several of his albums, which include "Bloodlines," "Smoke," and "The Dummy."

One bronze, titled "Corporate Head," depicts a man leaning against a skyscraper peering, through the building, and is currently on display in Los Angeles. 
Other examples of Allen's work reflect his satirical and ironic outlook on life. He dis­played an image of a man in a wheelchair with blood pouring out of his mouth,. as well as a bronze of a hand holding a ra­zor blade to its wrist. 
In addition to his impressions of past events in American his­tory, Allen discussed the effects of Vietnam on American sol­diers. Since the end of the war, he said, there have been twice as many veteran suicides as there are names on the Vietnam Memorial.

The First Amendment re­quires proof of a governmental interest to justify restricting access to information, Harris wrote. "Defendants have not offered a single justification for preventing universities from disclosing the names of students involved in criminal activity," the judge said.

Hickey to review AHA parietals plan 
By NICOLE McGRATH News Writer 
The proposed change in Saint Mary's parietals has not yet been addressed by the SMC administration, it was reported at Thursday's Residence Hall Association (RHA) meeting. 
The parietals report was re­viewed this week and will be re­viewed again at a senior offi­cers' meeting next week, said Brenda Oaks, RHA vice-presi­dent. 
"I think that we should be op­timistic, but I have no idea when the change could take place," said Oaks. 
RHA's proposal, submitted last week to SMC President William 
Hickey, would change parietal hours to 10 a.m. to 3 a.m. daily in SMC residence halls. 
In other business, it was an­nounced that an AIDS video/question-and-answer session is being planned for ei­ther Dec. 10 or 11. Charles Pressler, assistant professor of sociology, will lead the ques­tion-and-answer session. The session will be held in either Carrol Auditorium or Stapleton Lounge. 
Upcoming events also include a week of activities from Dec. 2­7 sponsored by Students for Environmental Action. The goal is to make students more aware of the environment. 
A weekend retreat called the "Death, Divorce" session is be­ing held from uec. t> -~. ac­cording to Maureen Connelly, Notre Dame RHA rep. Informa­tion can be obtained from the Alumni Continuing Education Office at Notre Dame and Cam­pus Ministry at Saint Mary's. 
Next semester, the Late Night Olympics will be held Jan. 31 from 8 p.m.-4 a.m. There will be ten teams with three dorms representing a team. Five rep­resentatives from Saint Mary's will be active in the event. "It is important that students take an active role in orchestrating it," said Sally Derengoski, assistant director of Rec Services.

publicize the fact that she had done this for me." 
One year later, Reimers re­ceived notice that he was ac­cepted to the International Akademie for Philosophie in Lichtenstein because a wealthy European agreed to finance a work-study student. 
In thanks for his prayer being answered, Reimers and his wife "entered more deeply to devo­tion of Our Lady and conse­crated our marriage to the ser­vice of the Church." 
In the last lecture, "The Power of Prayer," IUSB student Lisa Renee Haskel explained the role that prayer, especially the Rosary, had in her decision to become a Catholic. 
In her childhood, she "cannot remember not knowing God," but as she grew older her feel­ings changed. Things started to seem empty in high school, and Lisa said, .. I wanted a deeper relationship with God." 
A friend told her about his Catholic faith, and although she was very skeptical at first, Haskel listened with intense in­terest. When he and his family left for Medjugorje, he left her with books to read about Catholicism. He returned with a small rosary for Haskel and a faith that captivated her. 
"I realize (he) was used as an instrument by Mary to help me," Haskel said. 
She began to pray the rosary and believes it gave her strength. The turning point in her life occurred as she said the rosary and saw Mary's invita­tion to "carry the Cross." 
Consequently, Haskel entered an RCIA program and after months of reflection joined the Catholic faith. She even plans to enter the religious order of the Oasis of Peace and thinks the call to a religious life proves that "conversion in my life will never stop."

South Bend zoo uses ultrasound on tiger 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) ­City zoo officials hoping to mate a 4-year-old Siberian tiger put the animal through ultrasound tests to find out why the big cat hasn't become pregnant. 
"We ruled out a lot of possible abnormalities in the repro­ductive tract," William Kirk Suedmeyer, a veterinarian, said Thursday. "Everything on ul­trasound appeared to be nor­mal." 
Although ultrasound exami­nations are being used more commonly in veterinary medicine, the tiger test was the zoo's first use of the ~diagnostic tool, said Potawatomi Zoo di­rector Johnny Martinez. 
Ultrasound imaging uses sound waves to create a video image of internal organs, en­abling doctors to view the or­gans without the risk of surgery. Ultrasound is com­monly used to monitor preg­nancies. 
The big cat, Kabushka, and her breeding mate, Chuklovich, are on loan to the zoo for two years under the close monitor­ing of the Species Survival Plan. 
The worldwide survival plan, administered by zoo experts, reduces genetic defects caused planned breeding of non-re­lated animals, said Martinez. 
Under the computer-coordi­nated plan, the zoo's tigers can be mated only during a two­year period that ends next year, he said. The allotted time is dwindling, so the zoo turned to the ultrasound examination on Wednesday. 
Kabushka was anesthetized and laid on her side white John Harding, a physician, and tech­nicians Gerri Moore and Pam Nicolini performed the test. The crew soon turned the 290­pound animal on its back to get a better image.

PLO is moving closer to Syria 
DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) ­Underlining growing signs it is forging a new coalition with Syria, the PLO on Thursday said Israel must surrender occupied Arab lands if peace talks are to succeed. 
Yasser Ahed-Rabbo, a mem­ber of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Or­ganization, also said efforts were under way to convene an Arab summit to coordinate the Arab stand before the second stage of the Middle East peace talks begin. 
The first round of talks opened in Madrid on Oct. 30. The second phase will be bilat­eral negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors. 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir met in Washington on Thursday with Secretary of States James Baker III to dis­cuss where the talks would be held. 
Abed-Rabbo's remarks after meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in Damascus indicated that the Arab side may be fracturing

Professor addresses international ethics 
By CHRISSY HALL 
News Writer 

In a society where money and 
power are desired by so many 
people, the mention of ethics 
emotes cynicism, said a ND 
professor in a lecture Thursday. 
Denis Goulet, an economics 
professor, is the William and 
Dorothy O'Neil Chair of 
Education for Justice, as well as 
both a Faculty Fellow for the 
Kroc Institute and a member of 
the Kellogg Institute for Peace. 
His research in the area or 
ethics, economics, and human 
rights has taken him across the 
globe, from South America to 
Warsaw. 

Goulet's lecture, titled 
'"International Ethics and 
Human Rights," focused on the 
present role that ethics plays in 
the world. Yet, contrary to 
Neitzche's claim that '"ethics is 
for the weak," as Goulet 
mentioned, there is actually a 
growing need and role for 
ethics in today's world. 

The language of politics, 
Goulet observed, is saturated in 
the talk of ethics. Objectives 
and theories, when hidden 
behind a concern for ethics, 
carry substantial weight with a 
politician's constituents. 

Even when war is waged, such 
as America's reaction to the 
invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, it is 
done so '"under the cloak of 
ethics," according to Goulet. 

Most ethical discourse by 
politicians applies to three 
areas of interest. Goulet listed 
these as war and peace, 
international solidarity, and 
human rights. 

Goulet concentrated specifically on the issue of human rights. He distinguished two areas of human rights, one belonging to economic and social rights and the other belonging to political and civil rights. Goulet differentiated between these two areas by giving the examples of capitalism and communism. 
Democratic capitalism of the United States guarantees the civil rights of free speech and freedom of religion but, unlike communism, does not 
guarantee shelter and rood, 
said Goulet. Capitalism can only 
provide the access to 
opportunity, but not a 
guarantee of success. 

Goulet set the ideal goal of an 
integrated vision that will 
include both civil and economic 
rights. Achieving this goal 
depends on being able to 
develop institutionally, 
educationally, and socially, 
according to Goulet. 

The task of reaching this goal 
depends on establishing what 
human rights hold priority. At 
one time, said Goulet, human 
rights centered around the 
individual. Now, however, 
communities and cultures cry 
out for group or collective 
rights. 

Goulet used the examples of 
animal rights activists, 
environmentalists, gays, and 
senior citizens. Although these 
groups have a legitimate claim 
in demanding rights, Goulet 
stated that we must first 
guarantee the rights of the poor 
and the persecuted. 

Emerging from the debate on 
human rights is a two-fold 
contradiction concerning 
ethical pluralism vs. political 
pluralism. '"Ethical advocacy 
becomes a political power 
game," said Goulet. 

Another significant problem 
connected with this argument is 
the war between the right of 
development vs. the 
environment. 

Goulet discussed the two 
ethical streams of protest 
stemming from the issue of the 
Brazilian rainforest. One side 
says that development of the 
land is crucial to providing places for peopie to live, while environmentalists claim that destruction of the rainforest will create an irreparable effect on our world. 
Developers, according to Goulet, strengthen their claim by bringing up how Americans at one time extinguished many species and even peoples in their effort to develop the land. 
In order to assure economic development and human rights for all, said Goulet, we must develop alternate strategies.

Campaign humor can backfire 
WASHINGTON(AP)-Candi­dates never learn, so campaign after campaign, somebody run­ning for president blurts a tasteless joke and is forced to a rueful apology when it becomes public. Sen. Bob Kerrey is the latest but won't be the last to run afoul of his own locker room humor. 
OtT-color or ethnic jokes were political hazards long before candidates and head tables were wired for sound and tele­vision. Now they're even riskier, as the Nebraska senator dis­covered. 
The crude joke he told was about two lesbians in a bar and a man who wants to pick up one of the women; in this ver­sion, the man is supposed to be rival Democratic candidate Edmund Brown Jr., the former California governor. 
A cable television microphone was recording when Kerrey told the joke to Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, another presidential candidate, at the head table of a Democratic fund-raising dinner in Bedford, N.H., last Friday. 
Four days later, the San Francisco Examiner reported the incident. The joke itself was too explicit to be fit for print, which may be a break for Ker­rey. At least it can't be widely retold. 
That didn't stop Vice Presi­dent Dan Quayle's press secre­tary from making his own at­tempt at humor on the issue, according to a report in today's Washington Post. 
..The good news is that the lesbians are upset with Kerrey," David Beckwith said at a GOP fund-raiser on Wednesday night...The bad news is that they'll be coming our way to support us." 
When Ronald Reagan had joke trouble in New Hampshire, it was over an ethnic story told on a campaign bus in 1980. Reagan's joke: 
.. How do you tell the Pole at the cockfight? He's the one with the duck. 
..How do you tell the Italian? He's the one who bets on the duck. 
"'How do you know the Mafia was there? ..The duck wins." 
When that one was reprinted, Reagan at first tried to brush off the criticism it drew. Then he said that he had told the joke as an example of the kind of ethnic humor that offends people and shouldn't be repeated. 
The Kerrey defense was simi­lar. He said he'd told Clinton the lesbian story as they swapped samples of the bad jokes that sometimes are suggested to candidates. 
..During a private conversa­tion at a roast last weekend, there were a lot of inappropri­ate jokes being told and re­peated," Kerrey said in a writ­ten apology on Tuesday. "I made a mistake in repeating one I shouldn't have." 
''I'm quite aware that it of­fended people and I apologize," he added during a campaign visit to AIDS wards at San Francisco General Hospital. 
He said it was insensitive, "a sort of locker room discussion." President Bush has generaiJy 
been prudent with his humor; a suggestion that Michael Dukakis thinks a naval exercise is something in Jane Fonda's workout book was about as racy as he got in the 1988 cam­paign. 
But in 1984, after his vice presidential debate with Geral­dine Ferraro, he told support­ers, "We tried to kick a little ass last night," and was chagrined when the remark was picked up on a newsman's microphone. He later said he talked that way but didn't like to do it in public. 
In 1968, Spiro Agnew said he'd meant no ethnic slur, only locker room humor, when he walked past a sleeping reporter of Japanese ancestry on his vice presidential campaign plane and asked: "What's wrong with the fat Jap?" 
After that wound up in print, Agnew apologized and la­mented the loss of the "camaraderie that exists among men which allows them to insult one another in a friendly fashion." 
For political candidates, that's as long gone as Agnew is. 
The really safe jokes for a candidate are the self-deprecat­ing kind, sometimes used to ad­vantage to deal with a political problem, as were Reagan's about his age or John Kennedy's about his family for­tune. 
"I will not make age an issue in this campaign," Reagan said in debating Walter Mondale in 1984. "1 am not going to exploit ... my opponent's youth and inexperience."

Students encouraged to complete surveys 
Dear Ed Itor: 

This week, 1,500 undergrad­uates will be receiving a short survey in their mailboxes. We know this is a very busy time of year for everybody, but we ask that students take a few min­utes to fill it out. This survey is a crucial part of a report that Student Government will be presenting to the Board of Trustees in February. 
The report is investigating the impact of the increased emphasis on research on undergraduate education at

We'll do some special things with the kids, giving their mothers a chance to have some rest for themselves. We'll share meals with homeless families and with people dedicated to serving them.

Notre Dame -an issue that affects all of us. The survey includes questions about class sizes, availability of professQrs, and course registration. We are hoping to get a sense of how satisfied students are with the educational opportunities available to them as undergraduates. 
We encourage the 1,500 stu­dents who receive the survey to please take five minutes out of their schedule to answer the questions. They can return it to the manilla envelope or col­lection box near the mailboxes in their hall. Off-campus stu­dents should drop it off at the information desk in LaFortune.

Groove to the rhythms of Africa 
By STEVE BROWN 
Accent Wnter 

A 
"Festival of African Rhythms," celebrating the rich and rhythmic culture of Africa, will be presen ted by the Notre Dame African Students Association tonight in Washington Hall at 7 p.m. The festival promises to be an excit­ing evening of African music, 
drumming, and dancing. 
One of the featured acts will be the African-American Unity Ensemble, which is affiliated with the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago. The ensemble, founded and headed by drummer and dancer, Midawo Gideon Foli Alorwoyie, consists of performers from various walks of life. 
The troupe will present rendi­tions of traditional ethnic music and dances from Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Toga, as well as the music of Midawo's home, Ghana. 
The second act featured in the festival will be the Jiki Band, who appeared at Notre Dame last year during Africa Week. 
'The Festival prom­ises to be a unique, rich, rhythmic, har­monious and beauti­ful celebration of per-
Headed by master drummer Musa La Lu Mosley, the band should exceed their last performance with the addition of a Jog-drum performance which ranges between sedate, ritualistic movements to fast­paced, energetic dances. 
Mosley is currently the drummer-in-residence at 
Chicago's Jiki Ballet Company, the Nubian Cultural Dance Theatre, and the Muntu Dance Theatre of Chicago. 
One of the most accomplished African drummers in the area, Musa and his band put on an incredible show, inc] uding percussion and dance, highlighted by "comic episodes" as described by festival orga­nizer Christophe Kougniazonde. 
Kougniazonde, a govern­ment/international studies graduate student and president of the Notre Dame African Students Association, says "(the Festival] promises to be a unique, rich, rhythmic, harmo­nious and beautiful celebration of percussion." 
The Festival, held at 7 p.m. on Friday in Washington Hall, will be filled with unique and exotic drumming and dancing. Admission for the event is $3 for students and $5 for non students.

'' 

It's about coming together and praising the Lord." 
That's how Patty Cushing, co­president of the Voices of Faith Gospel Ensemble, explained the idea behind the group, which is holding its annual fall concert this Sunday at 7:15 p.m. in Washington Hall. 
Despite this claim, the seventy-five members cannot help but be entertaining. The organization, which started around twelve years ago with half a dozen students, has almost tripled in the last three years alone. 
"The entire group is completely student run," said Cushing. "Other groups usually have faculty involved. We buy the music, learn it, teach it, ev­erything." Except for the allotted money from the University, the group's fundraisers and public performances are their only source of income. 
The group performs outside of the University about two to three times per month. Recent performances have included the Sesquicentennial Mass, the Multicultural Festival, and several churches in the area.

1r heart" 
"The group offers an outlet for Minority students to come together and praise the Lord," said Cushing. "Many students are not Catholic, they don't get much out of church here." However, the group is not limited to Minority students. ..Anybody can join. People just don't know. Right now there are about ten white students in the group." 
Senior Regina Steele, director of the Voices of Faith, restated the idea behind the group. "We're not just to entertain, we have a spiritual message to send forth to our audience. We, as a group, believe in what we're singing," said Steele. 
The group has many plans for the future. They are going on tour to Georgia and Florida for Spring Break and hope to make a tape. "We're also trying to earn money for choir robes for the trip," said Cushing. 
Their upcoming performance, titled "Speak to My Heart," will be this Sunday, at 7:15 in Washington Hall. Tickets will be on sale at the LaFortune information desk at $2 for students and $4 dollars for general admission. 
Co-president Keith Johnson seemed to explain the group's concept best. .. Praising God is a privilege and a powerful medium to touch people's hearts. If the choir can inspire just one person to have a closer walk with God, our purpose has been accomplished."

Martina advances 
Navritilova speaks on AIDS
NEW YORK (AP) -Storming 

back from a disasterous first 
set, Martina Navratilova over­
came Arantxa Sanchez Vicario 
on Thursday night to grab a 
spot in the semifinals of the 
VIrginia Slims Championships. 
After playing one of the worst sets of her long career, the 35­year-old Navratilova pulled her game together in time to elimi­nate the fifth-seeded Sanchez 1-6, 6-4, 6-2 and move a step closer to her fifth title in this season-ending tournament. 
Navratilova, who was seeded fourth in the elite 16-player field, next will play the winner of Thursday night's second quarterfinal between Steffi Graf, the No. 2 seed and twice a winner of the annual event at Madison Square Garden, and No. 8 Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia. 
Friday night's quarterfinals will pit defending champion Monica Seles, the No. 1 seed, against No. 7 Mary Joe Fernandez, and No. 3 Gabriela Sabatini against No. 6 Jennifer Capriati. 
This was the 11th time Navratilova and Sanchez Vicario have played, with Navratilova holding a com­manding 9-1 lead. The only time the left-bander has lost to her Spanish opponent was on clay at the Citizen Cup in 1990. 

NEW YORK (AP) -Martina Navratilova says she isn't being critical of Magic Johnson. It's just that she is "mad as hell" over the double standard the public has about sex and the sexes. 
Earlier this week, Navratilova told the New York Post that while she agreed that it was tragic that the basketball star has contracted the AIDS virus, she felt his revelation that he had been promiscuous was ..sad" and "frightening." 
Thursday night, Navratilova said her comments had drawn ..very positive" responses. 
"A lot of people have been thinking those thoughts, but have not been stupid enough or brave enough to say them," she said. "Or vocal enough or fa­mous enough, I suppose. A lot of people are thinking that, but they are not being interviewed." 
Talking to reporters after a hard-fought 1-6, 6-4, 6-2 quar­terfinal victory over Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the Virginia Slims Championships, Navratilova took the opportu­nity to clarify her remarks. 
"I certainly didn't mean my comments to be in any way negative towards Magic," Navratilova said. "Selfishly, I feel I wish that he hadn't gotten it so I could watch him play basketball. He was one of my heroes as a basketball player. 
"But I felt that I needed to say what I felt." 
In the newspaper article, Navratilova said that if a ··heterosexual woman who had been with 100 or 200 men" re­vealed that she had contacted AIDS, ••they'd call her a whore and a slut and the corporations would drop her like a lead bal­loon. And she'd never get a job in her life." 
"It's a very big-time double standard, and it's frightening because it's happening." 
She told the Post that Johnson is "preaching the wrong mes­sage. He's saying it's OK to be promiscuous as long as you use a condom. That's not good. It's sad." 
On Thursday, she dido't back down from any of her state­ments, but she did clarify her position. 
..People can take things out of context and make it sound bit­ter or negative," she said, "but it certainly wasn't meant that way. And I think Magic having AIDS can be a great spokesper­son and ... make people realize that anybody can get it through any unfortunate circumstances.

Perles to step down as MSU coach 
EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP)­Michigan State University President John DiBiaggio an­nounced Thursday that he has asked George Perles to give up his head football coach's job, but remain as athletic director. 
DiBiaggio said he had offered Perles a 3 1/2-year appointment to be athletic director, effective Jan: 1. Perles has held both jobs since July 1, 1990, when he replaced athletic director Doug Weaver, who retired. 
DiBiaggio said he would ask Perles to stay on as football coach until a successor could be chosen after a national search. 
..I have considered such a dual appointment inappropriate from the start. The jobs are separate and distinct and a mistake was made when they were joined over my objec­tions," DiBiaggio said in a statement announcing his deci­sion. 
The board of trustees voted in January 1990 to give Perles the dual role despite DiBiaggio's stand that one person shouldn't hold both. At the time, Perles was talking with the New York Jets of the NFL about their va­cant head coaching job. 
The dual appointment led to a nationwide controversy about athletics vs. academics and raised questions about who controls college athletics. 
DiBiaggio echoed that in his

statement. "We must view in­

George Perles 

Perles still has six years, at $123,000 a year, left on his coaching contract. He didn't get any extra pay to be athletic director. 
The big question Thursday night was whether Perles would file a lawsuit to hold the uni­versity to that contract or trade it in for one to be athletic director. 
"This has not been done in a vacuum. We've had discussions with George Perles and his legal counsel leading into this. We are hopeful that this is what George wants and will accept, if not maybe we'll have to go back to square one," said university spokesman Terry Denbow. 
..We have said this is what we think is in the best interests of the university." 
Two of the eight members on the board of trustees said they expected Perles to switch jobs. Two others said they weren't sure what Perles would do. 
will be acceptable and wel­comed" by the board of trustees. 
Michigan State went 8-3-1 last year, but the Spartans are 2-8 this year with the final game of the season coming Saturday against Illinois. DiBiaggio emphasized that "the current football season did not guide my decision. Coaches do not get moved over, up or out at MSU because of a losing season." 
A secretary at Perles' office said he had gone home for the day. Repeated calls to Perles' home phone went unanswered. A dispatcher at the East Lansing Police Department said squad calls has been called to remove reporters and photog­raphers from near Perles' home. 
Perles has been the head foot­ball coach at Michigan State since 1983 and has a career record of 56-44-4. 
His best season at Michigan State came in 1987 when the Spartans won the Big Ten title with a 7-0-1 mark and fmished 9-2-1 overall, including a 20-17 victory over USC in the Rose BowL 
Trustee Jack Shingleton, who wasn't on the board when it voted to give Perles both jobs, said he was delighted that the nearly 2-year-old controversy was coming to an end. 
"I think that's a major step in settling this whole matter and 
both jobs, said she hopes the 
decision ends the controversy. 
"We are tired of it. The public is tired 0 f it and I suspect George Perles is tired of it," she said. "I'm sure the president would not intentionally offer some­thing knowing we're contractu­
ally committed to the football coach," she said.

SMC hoops set for Calvin tourney 
By CHRIS BACON Sport$ Writer 

The Saint Mary's basketball team opens its 1991·92 season today, traveling to face Capital University in the opening round of the Calvin College Tournament. 
The Belles hope to improve from last year•s 12-9 record, and will be led by five returning starters. Senior forward and captain Janet Libbing returns to lead the team offensively. Last season, Libbing shattered the Saint Mary's sing)e ..season scoring record with 365 points and was ranked 26th in the nation for free throw percentage (79.3%). 
"We'll look to her (Libbing) and Catherine (Restovich) to lead us~ These are our two se­niors who wlll give us leader­ship."' Belles coach Don 
~ Cromer said ...If these two are hitting, then we have a great shot at being a powerful team." 
Senior forward Catherine Restovich returns with her 
10.8 points per game average, and also recorded 42 steals last season. 
Four returning players scored over 100 points last season for the Belles, who ranked 22nd among Independents last season, in­cluding Libbing. Restovich. ju­

Swim teams travel to Illinois 
By JASON KELLY Sports Writer 

Both the men•s and women's swim teams will have their hands full this weekend as the travel to the University of 
Hlinois' Dual Meet Extravaganza for three meets in as many days. 
The women are coming off their first win ever over Ball State. while the men are look· ing to rebound after a tough loss to the Cardinals. 
Both teams will face Kansas today1 with Illinois and Southern Illinois on Satnrday"s slate. The men will face Purdue and Northwestern Sunday afternoon. while the women will face the Boilermakers and Illinois State. 
With several freshmen play~ ing important roles on both teams. this weekend's three­day meet will be the first of it's kind for several key swimmers .

averaged 14.7 points and 9. 7 rebounds last year, leads a Cardinal team which had to re­place three starters from last year's Final Four participant. 
What these teams will be go­ing up against is an Irish squad hungry for a chance to prove themselves. After being denied an NCAA bid with a 23-6 regu­lar-season mark, Notre Dame would like nothing better than to serve notice that it is a team on the rise. 
To do so, the Irish will turn to the veteran leadership of co­captains Nowlin (11.2 ppg, 7.6 rpg) and junior point guard Coquese Washington (9.2 ppg, 
5.6 apg). 
But following in .the footsteps of Karen Robinson, Krissi Davis and Sara Liebscher, now an Irish assistant, has not been easy. 
"It's been a hard transition trying to figure out where my place is after following the three leaders from the past three years," said Nowlin. "I'd like to be able to be someone that the team can see and say, 'She knows what she's doing; we'll be okay.'" 
"All the players respect her and look to her to be poised, the one person they can count on," added McGraw. 
Washington, who missed the exhibition games against Athletes in Action and Australia, is expected to see ac­tion in this weekend's games. A second-team All-MCC selection last year, the junior is a stabi­lizing force in a backcourt that includes two freshmen, Michelle Marciniak and Audrey Gomez, and sophomore Kara Leary, who saw only limited action last season. 
"She gives us poise under pressure, a point guard who is familiar with the offense and is able to execute it," said McGraw. "With Michelle and Audrey, they're both very tal­ented players, but it's going to take them a while to gel with the team."

Irish hockey to face Lake Forest 
Special to the Observer 
The Notre Dame hockey team will take to the ice this weekend with a home-and­home series against Lake Forest. 
The Irish (2-4-0) will host the Foresters at 7:30 pm tonight at the Joyce Fieldhouse and then travel to Lake Forest for a 7:30 contest on Saturday night. 
The Irish are coming off a split series with Kent State last weekend, dropping the first game, 6-1, but rebounding to take the second one by a 7-5 count. That second game snapped a three-game Irish home losing streak. 
Senior winger Lou Zadra, who had two goals and two as­sists last weekend, bringing his career point total to 97, should surpass the 100-point club soon. Senior center David Bankoske leads all active play­ers with 152 points. 
Following this weekend's series with Lake Forest, the Irish will make an East-coast swing, challenging Hockey East members Merrimack (Nov. 26) and Maine (Nov. 29-30). 
Leary is expected to start for Notre Dame this weekend, along with Nowlin and 6-foot-5 junior Majenica Rupe (2.1 ppg in nine games last year). Sophomore swingman Sherri Orlosky (3 .2 ppg) and Marciniak, who played exceptionally well in the exhibition games, will also start. 
Senior Comalita Haysbert, who McGraw calls her best de­fensive player, averaged 12.5 ppg last season while playing only 12 games before being sidelined with academic trou­bles. 
Knapp (6. 7 ppg, 3. 7 rpg), who at 6-foot-3 is an excellent perimeter shooter, fellow sophomore Andrea Alexander, and junior Dionne Smith, back after missing two years with knee problems, also are ex­pected to make major contribu­tions ·in the frontcourt. 
In the backcourt, Gomez will 
see  action  along  with  
Washington and Leary.  
"We're just such  a  young  

team, we're learning from scratch right now," lamented McGraw. "Even the sophomores and juniors that are playing don't have a lot of game expe­rience." 
But they hope to have more come Sunday night.

Wrestlers begin season in St. Louis 
By JIM VOGL Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame wrestling team will tune up for the up­coming season at the St. Louis Open tournament this weekend. 
The exhibition match will not count in the Irish's record; however, it will give the veteran wrestlers an occasion to sharpen their skills, and the talented group of freshmen a chance to gage their skills against collegiate competition. 
Coach Fran McCann, in his eighth year at the Irish helm, described the event as a great opportunity for his team. 
"I think the St. Louis is great to open up with," said McCann. "We'll be able to take guys that probably won't wres­tle a lot this season." 
The team will enter 24 wrestlers at St. Louis, while during regular season competition there are usually only ten spots. 
McCann also stressed other in which scoring is on an indi­vidual basis. 
Notre Dame, 4-8-1 last year, will return a solid foundation of grapplers from last year's squad. 
"Several guys will make an impact. Some upperclassmen have been there before," McCann added. 
Oklahoma State, the defend­ing national champions and currently the second-ranked wrestling team in the country, should stand above the rest at this year's St. Louis Open. McCann stated a realistic goal for his team in the tournament. 
"We would like to place at least five guys in the top four. That means half of our starters." However, McCann pointed out the difficulty of placing in such a large tourna­ment, which only counts the top four performers from each division. 
While the squad features several gifted freshmen, McCann will look to the team's 
The other major change in the lineup involves Steve King, who wrestled at the 190 weight class last season. This summer, he competed at 220 in the Olympic Festival and returned to school at a solid 230. 
"In the best interest of Steve and the program, he'll probably take the year to train and bulk up to a solid 240­250," announced McCann. "We have a lot of depth at 190. We'll miss him, but we're looking at a possible national champion at the heavyweight level." 
McCann mentioned King's success in high school, achiev­ing first-team All-American status, and his agility factor in comparison to the country's current number-one heavy­weight. 
Therefore, at the heavyweight level this year, two seniors will be competing for mat time, Kurt Engler and Chuck Weber. Pete Cahill and Tom Salvino will battle for the

Associate Sports Editor 

There are two theories about how to start a basketball sea­son. The first is to schedule a series of sure wins to ease a team into regular season play. 
However, Notre Dame women's basketball coach Muffet McGraw chose the sec­ond strategy-to put her team through a trial by fire-with the Irish hosting third-ranked Penn State tonight at 7:30 p.m. and seventh-ranked Stanford Sunday afternoon at 1 p.m._ 
Four of Notre Dame's first six games are against teams in the AP pre-season Top 25, in­cluding trips to West Lafayette, Ind., to take on tenth-ranked Purdue and Athens, Ga. to face . number-four Georgia. 
'Tm wishing right now that we had a cupcake schedule," joked McGraw. "This is just go­ing to be a learning experience, especially for the freshmen." 
But the players have other ideas.­
"I think it's a great opportu­nity to prove ourselves, to show where we are as far as where we stand nationally," said se­nior Margaret Nowlin. "It's a chance maybe to show other people that we can compete with teams like Penn State and Stanford." 
The Nittany Lions were ranked number one at the end of last season, butwere upset in the second round of the NCAA Tournament by James Madison. Only defending champion Tennessee and Virginia are ahead of Penn State in the preseason poll, and the Lions return four starters from last year's 29-2 squad. 
All-American candidate Susan Robinson· leads Penn State's at­tack. A second-team selection last year, the 6-foot-1 forward averaged 18.1 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. 
But the Nittany Lions are far from one-dimensional. Three other seniors will likely start for coach Rene Portland's squad, including 6-foot-3 center Kathy Phillips (12.4 ppg, 5.8 rpg) and 5-foot-8 point guard Dana Eikenburg (8.1 ppg, 4.7 apg). 
Coming off the bench will be last season's Atlantic 10 Freshman of the Year, 6-foot forward Helen Holloway (5.8 ppg. 4.3 rpg), as well as New York's Miss Basketball for 1991, Katina Mack (30. 7 ppg at Monticello H.S.). 
"I think the Notre Dame ex­perience is going to be some­thing very unique for us," said Portland. 'Tm glad there isn't a Slam-Dunk Jesus-1 don't think I'd need that kind of thing going against me." 
Stanford, who routed the Irish 97-6 7 in Palo Alto last year, will not be an easy task either. All­American candidate Val Whiting, a 6-foot-3 center who

Irish volleyball gunning for NCAA berth 
By JONATHAN JENSEN 
Sports Writer 

Faced with a must-win situa­tion, the Notre Dame women's volleyball team travels to Hempstead, NY., this weekend for contests against San Francisco and host Hofstra. 
The Irish have to come away with two wins this weekend and then sweep the next two at Texas-Arlington next week to earn a bid to the NCAA Tournament, a goal they have been looking forward to all season. 
However, they have to travel to New York without senior co­captain Alicia Turner, who sprained an ankle in practice this week. Turner, along with fellow senior captain Chris Choquette, has been the emo­tional leader of the Irish, lead­ing them to a Midwestern Conference championship and an impressive 19-7 record. 

"I think it will hurt us a lot," said Choquette. "She was play­ing very well and her presence on the court helps the team with confidence." 
The Irish will look for some extra leadership this weekend from junior Jessica Fiebelkorn. Her excellent play was re­warded with the MCC Fall Athlete of the Week award for the second time in the last three weeks. 
The loss of Turner will add greatly to the pressure of a must-win situation, but the Irish plan to turn the injury into a plus. 
"We feel the pressure, but it also makes us more focused," noted Choquette. "It helps us better in executing and playing with confidence." 
The Irish have rebounded from a 9-27 season a year ago and they feel the major differ­ence has been the hiring of coach Debbie Brown. 
"They didn't have a good at­mosphere last year," stated freshman Christy Peters, "The morale has picked up so much." 
They believe they can com­plete the turn-around by ending up the season with four more wins and a 23-7 record, despite all the extenuating circumstances. 
"I just think we are confident that skill-wise and athletic-wise we are a better team, .. said Choquette, a native of Warwick, 
R.I. "It's going to be a matter of executing those skills." 
"It's realistic for us to expect and have the intent of winning," said Brown. "If we play well we should come back with two wins." 
It's time to hit the road, Lou! 
After two disgusting and gut­wrenching losses, I think it's time for a change here at Notre Dame. That's right, it's time to fire Lou Holtz. 
Coach Lou Holtz has worn out his welcome in South Bend. He has not 

lived up to Notre Dame expectations, 
Anthony King 
and its time to leave him a one-way 
Assistant Sports Editor 
ticket at Michiana Airport. 
First of all, let's talk about this season. He has lost two games in a row, something he duplicated just four short years ago in the 1987 season. And to top it off, to lose to Tennessee and Penn State, two clearly inferior teams, is unspeakable. Shame on you, Lou. 
The fact that we have three losses in a season drops Notre Dame to the level of mediocrity. It is bad enough to have to suffer through three losses and fall below East Carolina in the rankings, but we are also forced to face the fact that we will not be playing for a national championship. To be in the Sugar Bowl against Florida just doesn't cut it. Notre Dame deserves better, as Irish fans should be able to enjoy the holidays every year celebrating what is rightfully theirs, a Notre Dame national championship. 
Think of the money Holtz's poor coaching is costing the university. The Hammes Bookstore will lose out on all the national championship apparel profits, and it's awfully hard to sell a shirt that has at least three losses tattooed on it. Irish fans deserve to wear national championship boxers every year. It's your fault, Lou. 
I guess we can call this 'the black era' of Notre Dame's football history, as the football program has reached the doldrums of mediocrity. Nine wins aren't enough in a season. Holtz's record of 54-17-0 and winning percentage of .761 is not impressive, as any high school coach could easily take Notre Dame's talent and duplicate it. 
As a senior, I've witnessed Notre Dame home losses an ap­palling four times in my four-year career, and only have seen one national championship. I guess I feel really cheated, as I was expecting the kind of success that Frank Leahy brought with championships in '46, '47, and '49. 
I'm sorry Lou, but I think it's best for all of us. It's obvious that you're too concerned with academics and running a clean program, rather than being willing to go to any lengths to win. Just look at Jerry Tarkanian. Remember Lou, it's wins, losses and national championships that matter under the dome. 
Lou, we're just looking out for the university, so don't hold a grudge. Notre Dame and especially her fans demand perfection, and anything less is unacceptable. Goodbye Lou, it's been fun, but you are too mortal for Notre Dame.
