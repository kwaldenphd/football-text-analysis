Boliva is not on the agenda for his four-nation Latin -American tour. Closing a lengthy toast, Reagan said: "to President

Workers in Times Beach, Mo. dressed in white plastic suits with black gas masks walked the streets of this small town yesterday, looking for traces ofdeadly dioxin in dirt that children have played in for the past 10 years. Dioxin, a chemical by-product, is one of the most toxic manmade substances -far deadlier than strychnine or cyanide. Scientists do not know what small doses do to humans, b 1 ut it has been shown to create serious health problems in other animals. Environmental Protection Agency workers began testing along the roadsides of this town about 25 miles southwest of St. Louis this week after learning that Russell Bliss, a waste hauler, was hired in 1972 and 1973 to spray city streets with oil to control dust. Bliss is known to have sprayed oil con· taminated with dioxin in several Jefferson County horse arenas in the early 1970s. Horses, birds and small animals later died in those areas. Bliss did not know the oil, obtained from a cheical company, contained the poison. Times Beach, with a population of about 2,500, is the sixth site in Missouri to be tested this year for dioxin contamination. More than a dozen locations are known to contain dioxin, and about 35 other sites are suspected. -AP 
Terrorists in Beirut, Lebanon, detonated a remote· controlled ca:-bomb yesterday in a failed attempt to assassinate left­ist Moslem leader Walid Jumblatt, and the state radio said the fiery blast killed six other people.

Emergency room attendants at American University Hospital saidJumblau had several shrapnel wounds in his forehead, but was released from the hospital after doctors cleaned and bandaged his injuries. His wife, Gervette, was being treated at the hospital for shock, but was expected to be released soon, medi­cal attendants said. Members of the hospital stall said Jumblatt's bodyguard, Jamal Saab, and a Lebanese police officer were among the dead. No group claimed responsibility for the attack in Moslem· populated west Beirut. The right-wing Christian Phalange Party denounced the bombing as "an effort to rekindle sectarian warfare and block the march toward peace." -AP

Power of the press 
In Evelyn Waugh's satiric novel about journalism, Scoop, a famous reporter is sent to cover a revolution in a Third World country. The reporter winds up in a dif­ferent, peaceful country. Not one to disappoint his editor and a reading audience hungry for sensational war reports, the journalist sends totally false reports hack to the newspaper describing the terrible carnage and wanton violence afflicting the war-ravaged country. 
Surely enough. within a week a real revolution breaks out in the previously peaceful country all because ofthe false reports. The moral of the story, as stated by one of Waugh's characters: "News is what we (journalists) say it is." 
Waugh certainly wasn't too far otl' the mark even though the book was written almost 50 years ago. In fact, only last week, one of America's most respected journalists, Edwin Newman, said the exact same thing in his keynote speech for the "Responsibilities ofJour­nalism" conference in the Center for Continuing Educa­tion. 
The scary thing is that Newman was serious. ­
This assertion, coming from such a prestigious source, does more to reflect the herculean power ofthe press than 100 Nixon autobiographies. 
More often than not, the 

press performs admirably in Lifer's march in Washington, their tremendous task of D.C. to more obscure areas collecting and disseminat­ofthe paper, despite the fact ing the most relevant news that hundreds of thousands stories ofthe day in a factual of people participate.

ratings, the networks present, in living color, more blood and gore than a low budget martial arts film. And all during the dinner hour. 
But an even greater abuse of the press's power is when they present stories with a sometimes noticeable, sometimessubtle, sometimes blatant bias. Forexample: 
 
Last year when El Salvador was the top news story everyday, many of the reports coming from that country exhibited a bias toward the left-wing rebels and against the government ofthen-presldent Duarte. 

Two 
years ago when Russian troops first invaded Mghanistan, Dan Rather wrapped a bathtowel around his head and paraded as a Mghanistinian freedom fighter for the cameras of60 Minutes. The report of· fered very little insight but everyone marveled at the bravery and audacity ofRather. Instead ofreporting the news, In this case the reporter became the news. 

During 
the height of the Vietnam war, Walter Cronkite, the "most trusted man in America," filed a report about a battle which pitted South Vietnamese and American troops against the North Vietnamese. The Communists had been defeated and the battle already

over for hours when Cronkite reached the scene. With dubbed-in machine gun fire, his report created the illu­sion that the battle was still going on. He also cxag gcratcd American loss of life and reported that the battle was a lost cause for the Americans. 
 More recently the results ofthe November election were presented as a landslide victory for the Democrat'> by much of the press including USA Today and Bryant Gumble of the Today show. A 50-seat gain for the Democrats in the House of Representatives would have constituted a landslide. Their 26-seat gain was a modest victory, far from a landslide. 
These arc some of the more blantant abuses of the press's power. Many times they succeed in twisting the news in much more subtler ways. In the past several 
years many newspapers which I have read have relegated the annual Pro· 

jobs with the seriousness 
they deserve. But as long as sensationalism sells (that pseudo-newspaper Tbe New York Post sells almost one million issues daily), then the "real" news will continue to take a back seat. 
In his speech Newman said "It is part of the (journalist's) job to pult a story in perspective and make sense: of what is happening." A good journalist just has to present the facts; the reader should then draw con· elusions for himself This is what responsible journalism is all about. Not film footage of young soldiers being blown to pieces or misleading headlines and distorted stories. Let's leave that kind of reponing to Pravda and Evelyn Waugh novels.

Opens ALfestival 
Actress tells oflife -with 0 'Casey 
By CHUCK KRILL 
StaffReporter 

Eileen O'Casey entertained and 
humored a gathering at the Ar­
chitecture -Auditorium last night 
with an account oflife with her Irish 
playwright husband in the first 
lecture ofthe Sean O'Casey Festival. 
Her presentation "Sean and Myself' marked the beginning ofthe festival sponsored by the College of Arts and Letters that will continue through Saturday. 
She described many memorable events of her life, from the moment she first read O'Casey'sjuno and the Paycock to his death in 1964 at the age of84. 
Of her first exposure to O'Casey's work she remembers, "It filled me with excitement and emotion. I thought, 'I must somehow meet the man who wrote this play, but how?'" 
After eventually being introduced to the playwright, Mrs. O'Casey, a young actress at the time, was asked to fill in for the lead in another O'Casey play, The Plough and the Stars. Though she thought it a "preposterous" idea that she take the part, her future husband con­vinced her to accept. "I can only, think, looking back, that I was hyp­notized and mesmerized into saying yes," she said. 
Madrigal dinners begin tonight at SMC 
Madrigal Christmas Dinners, a 
traditional event at Saint Mary's, will 
be presented daily today through 
Sunday. 

The dinners, sponsored by the 
music department, are a re­
enactment of the traditional Renais­
sance Christmas celebration. The 
Chamber Singers and Collegium 
Musicum, dressed in 16th century 
costumes, will treat the diners to 
traditional Christmas and Renais­
sance music. The program features 
singing. dancing and feasting. 
The four dinners will be held in 
the North Lounge of Regina Hall at 
Saint Mary's. Seating will begin at 
6:30 p.m., and the dinner will be served at 7 p.m. Tickets are SI2 per person and may be obtained at the Saint Mary's ticket office or by mail. Seating is limited, and tickets must be purchased in advance. The public is invited. 
After their marriage in 1927 and disappointment over the subse­quent rejection of another O'Casey play by W. B. Yeats and the Abbey Theater in Dublin, Mrs. O'Casey went back to acting while her hus­band continued to write. "This was the best of both worlds," she said, "home all day with Sean and Breon (their first child), off to the theater in the evening. It was a very good time in our lives." 
When her husband's health wor­sened, she left the stage to care for him. Wanting to move to a house near a school for their children, O'Casey told of needing a reference to convince a landlord to rent them a house. 
Her husband wrote to George Bernard Shaw, a close friend, who responded that the landlord "proposed a lease in which I was not only to guarantee your rent but also your character, and I said I didn't know his character. I knew enough of yours to know that the conse­quences might include anything, even a war!" 

After enduring World War II and despite his failing eyesight, O'Casey completed Cock-a-Doodle Dandy, which his wife says was "his favorite play and is mine. He had achieved what he wanted. This play had inter­woven into it music, song and dance." It will be performed as part of the Sean O'Casey Festival by stu­dents at 8:00 P.M. in the Little Theater at Saint Mary's on Thursday and Friday. 
Before his death, NBC filmed "A 

Conversation with Sean O'Casey," 
which was shown following the 
lecture in the Architecture 
Auditorium. 
The final Festival event will be the presentation of juno and the Paycock on Saturd~y at 8:30P.M. in Saint Mary's Little Theater sponsored by the Theater Guild of the Council ofIrish Arts ofChicago.

However, as the two leaders were meeting, Reagan's press office an­nounced he had signed a proclama­tion waiving U.S. quotas for sugar used to produce gasohol and alcohol for industrial purposes. 
Although Reagan administration officials had warned in advance that this would not be a trip in which there would be U.S. handouts .at every stop, the gesture was seen as symbolic of the administration's ef­forts to ease the trade protectionism Figueiredo has decried.

"We shall clean up and modernize the police departments of the federal government," he said. "The police should be a guarantee of public safety and order, not a cause oftheir breakdown." 
De La Madrid said he will root out and punish the corrupt officials widely seen as the hidden cause be­hind Mexico's worst recession ofthe century. 
Absorbed by his nation's economic problems, including the largest foreign debt in the third world, De La Madrid gave little at­tention to foreign policy in his speech. 
However, he repeated Lopez Por­tillo's vow "to meet others on an equal footing" and to work "for a just and peaceful solution y> tensions in Central America." 
Warning that the next two years would be tough, but promising that the burden ofausterity would borne by everyone, De La Madrid an­nounced a 10-point "immediate program for ·the reordering of the economy." 
lhe program calls for sharp government spending cuts, job guarantees and continuation of public works already under way. His program also includes tax increases, food programs, new standards in public housing, keeping the banks under the national control imposed by his predecessor, adjusting ex­change control mechanisms to market conditions, and restructur­ing the federal administration.

WASHINGON (AP) -With Ed­ward M. Kennedy a dropout from the 1984 campaign" former Vice President Walter F. Mondalc and Ohio Sen. John Glenn led the scramble yesterday to move to the front of the pack for the Democratic prestdential nomination. 
The speculation in the immediate aftermath of Kennedy's announce­ment gave Mondale the lead with or­ganized labor, while former astronaut Glenn was seen by many Democrats as having a broader­based appeal which could give them their best chance to defeat Ronald Reagan in two years. t However, the already crowded Democratic field was certain to attract still other contenders and being tagged the frontrunner 20 months before the nominating convention is an honor many politicians would just as soon

--100th anniversary of her death. 
Gravis, the Director of Programs at the Aylesford Carmelite Spiritual Center in Darien. Ill., speaking on "\1s. Teresa de Avila: The Ex­perience of the 20th Centurv through 16th Century Eyes," chal­lenged the audience to read Saint Teresa's works. 
"Don't read books about Saint Teresa, read her. In reading her, you will see your own experiences through her eyes," he said. 
Gravis explamed that 16th cen­tury Spain was much like 20th cen­tury America. He cited Spain's position as a world power, an infla­tion of more than 300 percent during Saint Teresa's lifetime, and a serious lack of jobs during this time as problems which are shared by today's society. 
Gravis stated that Saint Teresa felt that many problems in society stem from goals which are too small. Saint Teresa advised people to "fix their 
eves on their g~als," he said. Accord­ing to Gravis, Saint Teresa set her

According to Herrero, chivalry was very much admired in Saint Teresa's day. He outlined the life of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, who began life as a soldier and carried this spirit ofchivalry into his faith. 
Herrero said that Saint Teresa was similarly influenced by the romantic tales of chivalry. He cited examples in her writing in which she compared the soul to a castle with many rooms, and described her con­vent as a fortress. 
Herrero stated that Saint Teresa used the language of adventure, but through this language "a greater spirit is referred to and expressed" 
in her writings.

Oil industry 







Domestic firms gain control 
By MnTON MOSCOWITZ 
Special to the Observer 
The pecking order in the oil in· dustry certainly seems to be chang­ing. On the ropes are the old leaders, the big international companies: Ex· xon, Mobil, Standard Oil of Califor­nia, Texaco, Gulf. Moving up to challenge them are the companies whose strength lies mainly in oil reserves found in the United States: Atlantic Richfield (ARCO), Standard Oil of Ohio (SOHIO), Standard Oil ofIndiana. 
A dozen years ago there was a 
clear line of demarcation between the international majors and the domestic pumpers. The internation· al companies were lifting oil out of the Middle East and Latin America at a ridiculously low cost, reaping enormous profits. When Arabs ed­ucated at the Harvard Business School woke up to what was happening, they moved quickly and forcefully to jack up prices and take control oftheir oil production. 
The world has never been the same since then, especially for the international oil giants, who are now treated by the oil-producing countries as agents. 

President Reagan, center, with Senate Majority leader Howard BakerJr., and House Republican leader RobertH. Michel talks with reporters in the press room at the White House Tuesday. Reagan said that they will not push for advancing the scheduled tax cut fromjuly tojanuary.

Meanwhile, a gigantic oil field was 

found on the north slope of Alaska, 
and the main beneficiaries of this 
discovery were two companies with 
virtually no overseas sources: ARCO 
andSOHIO. 
You can see the dramatic changes 

in lthe business by following the trail 
of Fortune magazine's annual com­
pilation of the nation's top 500 in· 
dustrial companies. 
In 1970, ARCO placed in the 30th 

position with sales of $2.7 billion 
(and profits of 5205 million). 
SOHIO was lodged in 83rd place 
with sales of $1.3 billion (and profits 
of $69 million). · By 1975, ARCO had risen to 15th place in the standings with sales of 
57.5 billion (and profits of S350 m.ilion) while SOHIO had moved up slightly to 75 on the roster with sales of S2.4 billion (and profits of SI 26 million). 
In 1980, ARCO took over 11th place with sales of S23.7 billion (and profits of S1.65 billion), and SOHIO took a meteoric jump to the 23rd position with sales of n I billion (and profits of SI.8 billion). 
Last year ARCO moved up anoth­er notch to 1Oth place. SOHIO moved up two notches to 21st place. They easily qualify as two of the fas­test growing companies in the na­tion. 
Exxon, Mobil, Standard Oil or California, Texaco and Gulf rose to the ruling positions in petroleum on a rich tide of Middle East oil. Now that same tide is sweeping them un­der. ARCO, on the other hand, is striking out in another direction. In September, it became the first U.S. oill company to sign an agreement with the People's Republic of China to drill for oil in the South China Sea. It could be a significant oil field. And in proceeding, ARCO can examine the experience of its competitors in the Middle East as an object lesson in how not to do it.

A trip to O'Hare may no longer be necessary for Notre Dame-Saint Mary's students in order to catch a flight home beginning December 15. 
Piedmont Airlines recently an­nounced its plans to include daily lllonstop service from South Bend to major cities in the East and Sout­heast. 
Piedmont will have two direct lllonstop flights to Dayton, Miami, and Newark. Connections via Dayton will be offered to Boston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Orlando, Tampa, and Washington. 
Piedmont spokesm,;Jn. Jonathan Lynch, told The Observer that prices will be very competitive with other carriers in the Michiana area in or­der to attract local custof"l ·~s. including students. 
Lynch also feels that the new service to the East and Southeast will help the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community "very much." Up until now it was very difficult for students living on the East coast to arrange convenient flights home. 
Piedmont's expansion is mainly due to the fact that small and medium sized cities like South Bend have been struggling to maintain business. Piedmont is hoping its ex­panded services will mutually benefit the company and the Mic­hiana area.

Toward a national drinking age of ll 
There has been much concern over the problem of intoxicated drivers lately. Several organizations, most notably Mothers Against Drunk Driving, or MADD, have formed in or­der to pressure state and federal legislatures to pass laws which would make life much

tougher for anyone caught driving under the influence of alcohol. Limited progress has been made. Illinois, for example, now has one of the toughest drunken driver laws in the United States. And early this week, Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Transportation, Drew Lewis, stated publicly his support for several ideas which he believes would help reduce the incidence of traffic accidents involving drunken drivers. 
Why the "sudden" concern about the in­ebriated driver? For many years, drunken drivers have been one of the most potent kil· lers in America. Over 25,000 traffic deaths

David M. Schorp 
Chautauqua in Faith 

In this column, a growing life, faithfully lived, has been likened to an upward spiral that is hard to ascend. Understanding can be a great help with the positive direction of this spiral; a faith of reason brings an understand­ing of human actions and this understanding strengthens our faith. 
The root ofcompassionate understanding is the very basic and optimistic belief that the heart of each and every person is good; all people are equal in that we all have the capacity to love. A fond image calling this to mind is the poster of the adorable little black boy, wearing worn, too short overalls and an upturned, floppy hat, saying, "God Made Me and God Doesn't Make Junk." 
Individuals are blessed with different yearly are directly attributable to them. While they often kill themselves, many times they kill innocent victims who have not had any­thing to drink. 
In the past, it seemed as if the alcohol­related death was something that happened to "someone else" -until that someone hap· pened to be aclose friend, a loved one, a child, a parent. It was one such incident which led to the formation ofMADD and to agreater public awareness ofthe seriousness ofthe problem. 
Recently President Reagan formed a special commission to study the problem. Lewis, as Transportation Secretary, has revealed a couple ofthe proposals so far, and I think they are good. 
One of the best proposals is to create a na­
tional legal drinking age of 21. 

More than half of the states either never 
lowered their drinking age from its former 
level or have raised it back to 21 since the ear· 
ly 1970s. There are still a few states which al­
low 18-year-olds to drink legally. This 
situation obviously causes many problems for 
neighboring states which do not allow 
teenagers the privilege. 

Most of those states that lowered their drinking ages from 21 to 18 did so after the passage of the 26th Amendment to the Con­stitution, which gave 18-year-old citizens the right to vote. Using the logic "Ifan 18-year-old can drive, die for his country, support himself via full-time job, and now even vote for our leaders, then he should be able to purchase and consume alcohol legally," states like New Jersey, Michigan, New York, and Wisconsin gave 18-year-olds the "right" to drink. Few had the foresight at that time to see the ramifications ofthis action. 
In almost every state that lowered its drink­ing age, the death rate via traffic accidents rose, particularly among the 18-to-21 age group. Many of these fatalities were out-of­state drinkers from neighboring states which still had the "21" on their books. They had crossed the border for a night oflegal carous­ing and ended up legally dead. More "young adults" were arrested for driving while intox­icated, regardless of being involved in acci­dents or not. 
About five years ago, the trend of reducing 
the drinking age reversed itself Few states 


The power of understanding 
amounts of different talents and abilities. But is this to say that one person is "better" than another? Is one person more capable of love than another? A football player making use of his physical gifts (and appealing to the aes­thetic need of the spetator) is no less impor­tant than a doctor utilizing his great mental capability. 
What of an individual blessed with neither overwhelming physical nor intellectual talent? God's view of us must be normalized, "For to him what was given, that much more will be expected ofhim in return." (There is a question of responsibility involved.) What matters is how "faithfully" a man strives to make the most ofwhat he's given, toward the benefit of others. Isn't a janitor as earnest about and as committed to his job as the Pope? 
Realizing this creates, for one whom much has been given, a warm place in the heart for those whl? live a simpler faith. Compassion through this understanding keeps us humble. 
Outside the bookstore, two very pretty women are approached by a thin, short­haired fellow wearing striped pants, a checked shirt, and a calculator on his belt. "Hi girls!" be says, and passes on into the bookstore. The two tum to each giggling. 
"What a total nerd." "He probably needs some new batteriesfor his calculator." 
Isn't it an insecure tendency for groups who share gifts, be they money, status, athletic ability, good looks, knowledge, or whatever, to cling together anq attempt to build them· selves up by cutting others down who don't share their same feature? 
Understanding that another person's worth 
isn't based soley on the good I posess, gives 
me the security and strength necessary to af. 
firm the good in someone different. I can 
respect another man for what he is, instead of 
turning him off if he's not in my mold. Being 
able to see the good in someone dfferent, in­
stead of waiting until he passes and then 
laughing behind his back, is giving what may 
very well be an insecure "nerd" the affirma­
tion he needs. This security, this power of af. 
firmation opens me up so that I might 
construqively interact with and be compli­
mented by the ideas ofothers. 
At one sitting, a group of engineering majors huddled together in Fitzpatrick are criticizing the antics of two of their class­mates: "Dave thinks be's God's gift to this Earth. He blurts out criticism ofthe teacher's lecture without eve11 raising his band." 
Another adds: "That guy is just plain weird. And what about john? That guy walked away with my homework, and copied it, without even asking! I see him 
remain at 18; most have risen the legal age to 19, 20, or all the way back to 21. Michigan is one which, in 1978, first raised the a~e from 18 to 19, and one month late: increased it all the way back to its former level via a referen­dum. t, 
Those states which have restored the old 21-year-old drinking age have seen a cor­responding drop in the traffic accident death rate -as an extreme example, in Maine, had a more than 40 percent reduction. Raising the drinking age back to 21 has proven to be more successful than many of its proponents im­agined as a reducer in the nation's death toll from drunken drivers. 
Obviously, the under-21 drinker is not sole­ly responsible for the alarming number of alcohol-related deaths; those of legal age are just as capable ofcausing havoc. But the drink­ing driver from the ages of 16 to 20 has become a major factor in the alcoho1-related death rate. Those states which have eliminated the legality of younger drinking ages have taken a step in the right direction. Now it is time for the rest -or perhaps the federal government -to follow suit. 
cheating on every test, too." 
Sometimes it is in the best interest ofanoth· er, that he be "clued in" to other people's per­cepton of him. But is criticizing someone behind his back the best way to do it? (Is it other -centered?) "But be makes me so angry!" 
How frequently does anger have a positive 
effect? A compassionate, affirming view of 
humanity would have it that men are bad only 
because they don't know good -a man's 
background and upbringing will have much to 
do with the way he perceives happiness. This 
view would even contend that any, and every 
man, given the proper loving upbringing, will 
turn out a wonderful human being. In the 
words ofSt. Augustine, "one must know love 
to love in return." In this light, can't self ­
centered mannerisms and actions be inter­
preted as a search for security in the wrong 
direction, by one who doesn't realize any 
other way? 

How often anger is the result ofincomplete 
understanding. Might one who posesses this 
power, then, almost never become angry at 
his fellow man? This understanding is the basis 
of unconditional love -of love in the face of 
hate or anger or arrogance or ignorance. 
For those heroes among us possessing excep­
tionally compassionate, affirming, uncon­
ditonally loving hearts, it is a responsibility. 
El Salvador's' progress' two years later 
Today marks the second anniversary of the assassination of four women in El Salvador. Given that a civil war has been in progress for the last three years, these deaths might pass as unremarkable -inevitable casualties of a situation that thus far has claimed over 30,000 
Paulita Pike 
Guest Columnist 

lives. But the characteristics that accompany their deaths do not allow the case to be writ· ten off as "unremarkable." 
In the first place, these women were U.S. citizens, a fact which in itself draws attention to the act, especially when the events surrounding the de·aths are less clear. 
Second. two of the victims belonged to the 'VIaryknoll Order, one to the Ursuline Order and one was a lay worker; it was through religious institutions that all were involved in social work at the side ofsome ofEI Salvador's poorest people. 
Third, before being killed, the women were sexually abused; in other words, assassination per se was not enough. Sick "machismo" dictated this final humiliating element so the act could be considered duly consumated. 
And finally, though in truth there is no final conceptualization in such a tragedy, the case ofIta, Maura, Jean and Dorothy drags on, serv­ing to remind us ofthe unfinished war and un­told suffering that also drags on in El Salvador. 
If on a moral level the case can never be resolved, the legal dimension entails no such philosophical dilemmas, yet after two years the crime has yet to reach a judicial resolu­tion. By U.S. standards, more than sufficient evidence has been gathered to try the five Na­tional Guardsmen accused ofthe murders, but El Salvador's standards -particularly when it comes to the military -are measured in terms of loyalties: nowhere is this more evi­dent than in the present situation, where at the same time there also exists a great fear among the Armed Forces that close question­ing during the trial will reveal cover-ups by some of the higher-ups in the military. 
Just as interesting to observe is the be­haviour exhibited by the U.S. Administration regarding the assassinations. Initially, indigna­tion was appropriately aroused; this however, soon turned to rhetoric when Alexander Haig commented that the women might have been trying to run a roadblock. This outrageous suggestion greatly undermined what credibility the administration had regarding its role in El Salvador and was subsequently dropped in face of the public outcry which followed. 
So now, two years later, attention is again focused on the deaths: we remember because it is Dec. 2, but we are reminded by the news which reports "progress" in the case and ad· ministration satisfaction in the same. 
We might wonder-as an at ofcommeni­moration to these women -why at this precise date "progress" (?) in their case is being hyped to the press; could there be any connection to the bi-yearly certification Congress must make (Next one: Jan. 30) that "progress" in El Salvador's human right~ record indeed merits the continued militaf) support of the United States to El Salvador? 
Based on the three past certificatiom Congress has made, this unfortunately seems to fit the pattern. 
For whatever worth these women's lives represent to us, it does not strike me as asking too much that we reflect on what Maura and Jean and Dorothy, and Ita might have told us -if they were still around -regarding the real story about progress and human rights in El Salvador.
