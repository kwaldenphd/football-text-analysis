Madden's antics make finish of Super Bowl 'hilarious' 
By the middle of the fourth quarter, the result of Super Bowl XXI had been determined and like many of the preceeding Super Blowouts, the game seemed ready to end on a dull note. 
When a game ceases to be competitive, many fans tend to lose interest. By Sunday's fourth quarter, I was ready to lose interest. One thing, however, kept me involved with the telecast. No, it wasn't the presentation of the Vince Lom­bardi Trophy to the winners or even the hope of highlights from the halftime show. Instead, it was the end-of-the-game antics of CBS com­mentator John Madden. 
During the game's first three quarters, Mad­den had shown why he and his straight man Pat Summerall are considered by many to be the best announcing team in the business. He had knowingly and skillfully explained complex plays, making them seem simple to even the most casual fan, while Summerall eloquently described the play-by-play. 
With about six minutes remaining in the game, however, all of the important plays had been run and all the meaningfull commentary been spoken. It was time for Madden to take over. 
During the Giants first two playoff blowouts, Madden filled the final minutes of the game with his unique barroom humor. He had given a matchless "physics" lecture on the momen­tum behind Giants running back Joe Morris that was more confusing than a professor who takes an English as a second language course at night. He had introduced the "Bucket Chalk­board," to diagram linebacker Harry Carson's route to dump a cargo of Gatorade on Head Coach Bill Parcell's head. In a contest of the Super Bowl's magnitude, I was sure Madden would be in prime form. He didn't disappoint me. 
With about six minutes left in the game, he began when sideline sound equipment picked up the thundering crash of shoulder pads. "There's some contact down there, you notice that sound you hear. This game's in stereo. Being down there on the sideline you hear boom, whack, whack, whack, whack. But I don't know what it feels like in stereo. Is it boom-boomoo­oo-oo-oo-,oo-boom -boom?'' 
The camera then panned to sweaty 300-pound defensive lineman Jim Burt. "How does sweat look in stereo? How does a chewed mouthpiece look in stereo? How does spit sound in stereo?" Madden was on a roll. 
He knew there would be a "bucket ceremony" this week, and when CBS cameras showed three Gatorade buckets on the sideline, Madden jumped in. "There's a third bucket this week. I think what happened --There's always been like a mother and father. This is the father bucket. This is the mother bucket and since the last game they had a baby bucket. Well yah, they got married yah, and had a baby bucket." 

Chris Bednarski 
Assistant News Editor 
lffl{!(W""IIOJ-/ /-2'1-q 
Madden then attempted to diagram the path Giant linebacker Harry Carson would take to dump the Gatorade on his victims. The diagram ended up looking like a physician's signature. 
Madden had help during Sunday's game. He had props. The boys in the truck provided Mad­den with a graphic of the bucket, giving it's vital statistics. It holds ten gallons, weighs 12 pounds, is 23 V4 inches tall and has been in the league for three years, the graphic said. Mad­den took it from there. 
"Yah, Yah, I mean that's how big it is, I mean third year in the league, and then ya ask ques­tions like is it married? Bucket, you got a fam­ily? Ya Ya, got a baby bucket," he said. "See the baby can't sit up there with the mom and dad though." 
Throughout the course of the game I noticed the Slice blimp, in addition to the Goodyear blimp flying over the Rose Bowl. I had missed one blimp though. Madden pointed that out to me. 
"Ya know Pat, we had three blimps up there today. We had three blimps and two helicopters. But the three blimps, it was an NFL record, world record, ya, a world record. There were 
more blimps over a football game than any game in the history of the sport." 
Near the end of the game, buckets of Gatorade and water were dumped on Parcells. "Well, the Super Bowl is worth a double bucket. It really is," said Madden. 
Madden succeeded in turning another dull Super Bowl finish into a hilarious adventure. His performance in the telecast definately rated a "double bucket."

Services mark first anniversary of disaster 
Associated Press 
With monuments and memorial services, Americans mourned the seven Challenger astronauts Wednesday on the first anniversary of history's worst space disaster. 
Thousands of workers at 10 National Aeronautics and Space Administration centers around the nation observed 73 seconds of silence, 'the length of Challenger's final flight, at 
11 :38 a.m., the time the shuttle roared off an icicle-draped launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Wednesday also was cold, with a low of 33 degrees, a reminder of the conditions that contrib­uted to Challenger's loss. 
President Reagan, in taped remarks played at 'NASA canters, said that school teacher Christa McAuliffe and her six fellow astronauts had taught a "lesson of courage, spirit and love to America's children, and now it is for all of us to learn the lesson from them." 
Vice President George Bush met in his office with relatives of three of the astronauts. 
At the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, where the Challenger took off on its last flight, some employees cried openly, other fought back tears and several hugged one an­other, and tourist buses stopped in their tracks at 11:38 a.m. 
"A lot of people just wanted to be with themselves," said Terry Eddleman, a spokesman for the Marshall Space Flight Center at Huntsville, Ala. "It is not a happy day." 
Killed in the accident were Cmdr. Dick Scobee, Pilot Mi­chael Smith, McAuliffe and crew members Judy Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka and Greg Jarvis. 
Jarvis' widow, Marcia, shunned any public appear­ance on the anniversary. "I'm going to spend that dav quietly on a trail somewhere .. . be­cause we always did things out­side," she said. 
Junior high school students paused for 90 seconds at 11:38 
a.m. at Lake City, S.C., McNair's hometown. 
Onizuka's family planned a happier observance Saturday gathering in Houston for ~ Hawaiian-style luau. "We promised Ellison a luau when he got back . . . and the luau never occurred," said Claude Onizuka, his younger brother. 
Texas Gov. Bill Clements designated Jan. 28 as "Chal­lenger Memorial Day': in his state. Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon joined about 100 school children and others in 73 seconds of silence at the state Capitol. 
The Washington state Senate unanimously adopted a resolu­tion honoring the "bravery and citizenship" of Scobee, a Wash­ington native, and Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich announced plans for an endowed scholar­
ship in memory of McAuliffe with a goal of $9 million i~ public and private money. 
For some, it was a day to re­
member two disasters in the 
nation's space prorgram. 
About 90 people attended the 
dedication of a granite monu­
ment at the Michigan Space 
Center in Jackson, Mich., to 
Jarvis and to Roger Chaffee 
who died in the Apollo I launch 
pad fire 20 years ago Tuesday. 
Both were Michigan natives. 
"I think each of us lost some­thing on that day a year ago," former astronaut Jack Lousma, commander on the third shuttle fli~t, said at the dedication.

Rebels end occupation of complex in Manila 
Associated Press 
MANILA -The defense minister announced Thursday that 200 rebels had agreed to end their two-day occupation of a Manila broadcasting complex. 
"I'm glad to announce we have ended another episode in the history of distur­bances that have plagued us these many months," Defense Minister Rafael Ileto told reporters. 
The end of the occupation which began early Tuesday: was announced after a two­hour meeting between mili­tary leaders and Col. Oscar Canlas, who led the group of mutineers who took over the studios early Tuesday. 
Canlas refused to call the lifting of the occupation a surrender, saying "We never left the armed forces." Ileto said the ques­tion of punishment for the mutineers, whom the gov­ernment linked to ex­President Ferdinand E. Marcos, would be discussed later. 
President Corazon Aquino vowed Tuesday to punish "to the fullest extent of the law" the estimated 500 rebels who attempted to take over major media and military facilities in the capital. 
The mutineers at the television-radio complex were the last rebel holdouts. 
Pro-government troops surrounding the television and radio complex and fired about a dozen tear gas can­nisters shortly after a late Wednesday deadline ex­pired, but did not attack.

College president innocent of sex abuse 
Associated Press 
BOSTON-A jury Wednesday found the ousted president of Westfield State College inno­cent of sexually assaulting a student. · 
The Suffolk Superior Court jury deliberated 8 hours before acquitting Francis J. Pilecki of two charges of indecent assault and battery. 
Pilecki faces a second trial on two charges stemming from an alleged sexual assault of a second student. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. 
The case, which was moved across the state following in­tense publicity, prompted statewide investigations into the use of college funds after it was disclosed that a student was secretly given a $10,000 payment from college funds in connection with the sexual as­sault charges. 
Pilecki hugged his wife Juliana and their son and daughter after the verdict was read. 
When asked about the second 
trial, he said, "I haven't given 
it a thought." 
"I'm just very pleased," Pilecki said, adding that he just wanted "to go home with the family." 
Prosecutor William W. Teahan said he had no com­ment except to say "I feel we're going to have a second trial." 
Pilecki's attorney argued during the trial that the stu­dent, 21 at the time of the al­leged assault, could have rebuffed the president's ad­vance or left the room when Pilecki, 52, asked him to dis­robe and then grabbed his but­tocks. 
The former student declined to comment on the verdict. 
The defense disputed whe­ther the incident actually oc­curred, but said that even if it did, it clearly was between con­senting adults and did not con­stitute sexual assault. 
Pilecki, who had announced his retirement from the $80,413­a-year job effective Aug. 31, 1986, was suspended without pay after his June indictment. 
In closing arguments, defense attorney James St. Clair said the student, who wanted a career in college ad­ministration, consented to anything that might have hap­pened when he visited the college president's campus home in the summer of 1984. 
Teahan contended that ac­quitting Pilecki would be tan­sense as he might have, but tamount to declaring that the said the student was former student, now 23 and "paralyzed" during "a bizarre working at another school in game" of trust with the college the state, was a homosexual. president, "a physically large

developement center at Saint Mary's. Schoeneman, who married upon graduating from college and divorced eight years later, said marriage is only the beginning of commit­ted love, and not the other way around. 
"The romance stage often leads to a power struggle stage," said Schoeneman, "and you need to be open to each other's as well as your own needs. Committment is the result of that give and take process." 
According to Schoeneman, we learn how to love and parent from our parents, but it is also important to learn from other experiences. She recommen­ded the books "Couples' Jour­ney" and "Superwoman Syndrome." Before making a committment to marriage, Schoeneman also suggested pre-cana counseling which is pre-marital counseling through the Church. 
Ken and Joan Milani, who have been married for 23 years, said they support pre-cana counsling. 
"Although at the time I would have rather been at a pre-game tailgater, Joan's urging of the pre-cana counseling definitely helped our marriage before we even got into it," said Ken Milani. "Being married has al­lowed me to drink from another cup, to experience areas I 
otherwise would not have on my own." 
Most of the panelists agreed that communication skills and a sense of committment were important when the deciding to marry. Ken Milani added that physical attraction didn't hurt either. 
Milani added "Variety, con­tact with different views, and concentration on relationships with others and most impor­tantly, with my wife." 
Saint Mary's philosophy pro­fessor Bill Hawk and his wife Jean who have been married for 16 years, spoke about the balence they try to maintain in their relationship. They said their main concern is for

Rebecca Hetland, Campus Munistry representative to stu­dent government and a senior English major, spoke on how three homilies which she delivered at Saint Mary's 
helped her to re-evaluate her sense of faith. "The unwilling­ness of all of us to confront that which is most painful in our lives, that is our 'humanness,' Hetland said was an obstacle in her faith. 
"I talk about this aspect of humanness because it was in discovering that I must come of terms with that humanness that I discovered the person of Jesus Christ. I consider that a point of conversion for me." 
"It was then that I moved from a time of burning ques­tions and unresolved answers, ... from an existence of wan­dering aimlessly to an exis­tence which celebrated God."

Empty alcohol bottles cause problems in auditorium 
By SHARON HEGG Staff Reporter 
The litter and empty alcohol bottles being left in the engi­neering auditorium after Friday and Saturday night movies has become an increas­ing concern to ti:.e administra­tion and student leaders, who met recently to discuss the p.:oblem. 
Student Movie Commis­sioner Charles Lobdell said that although administrators have issued no ultimatum, they are very serious about improv­ing the situation. 
"I wish students would stop bringing alcohol into the auditorium," Lobdell said. "They are increasing the odds of no more movies in the engi­neering auditorium which is es­sentially the only place to show movies on campus."

Maintenance has been moni­toring the amount of refuge left in the auditorium, said William MacWhorter, director of build­ing services. 
"There has always been pop cans and candy wrappers, but now they have had to clean up vomit off the carpet," said MacWhorter. 
MacWhorter said different types of movies seem to attract different types of students. 
Lobdell agreed, saying that "the rowdy-action movies (which bring in more money) also tend to bring in more beer." 
According to Lobdell, the problem has been on and off in the past. 
However, MacWhorter said, "it seems to be a growing prob­lem for the janitors to clean up. There has been damage to

The first major complaints about the situation in the engi­neering auditorium were received last year. "The stench from (the litter) not being cleaned up all weekend inter­feres with Monday classes," said Lobdell. "We are -now working with managers, rein­forcing their job description

Don Montanaro, student body vice president, said he be­came aware of the problem late last semester. He wrote a letter to The Observer appealing to students not to bring alcohol into the engineering auditoriU'm. 
"I am hoping that students will assume responsibility for something that is for them," 
Montanaro said Wednesday. "Using the auditorium is a

P.O.Box Q 
Teams perform poorly without fans' support 
Dear Editor: 
One of the most disappointing aspects of the Notre Dame sports scene over the past few years is the lack of per­formance of the student body. There was a time when visiting teams did not enjoy appearances at the stadium or the ACC because there were two teams to beat, the athletes and the students. The records of the football or basketball teams didn't matter. Momentum and adrenalin were created by noise and more noise which led to many upsets. 
That ability has recently waned. The student body no longer has the creativity, knowledge of the games, desire, or leadership to create an at­mosphere that truly strengthens their feams. Joe Paterno recently said that the mystique of visiting Notre Dame no longer has an impact on opposing teams. He is correct. The mystique of Notre Dame is its spirit, regardless of odds. The present student body forgets the part about " ... what tho' the odds ... " 
I attended the recent Notre Dame­West Virginia basketball game. The student body didn't know whether to stand up or sit down, but in either case they made no noise. Some students even left with three minutes to go in the game. The students seem to know nothing about the impact that loud, in­cessant, obnoxious, turnover-creating noise has on opposing teams. 
It used to be that Notre Dame could count on upsets and come from behind victories in part because of the student body. With a little bit more noise, West Virginia might not have run their of­fense so well. Seems like upsets are now going to be real miracles. Just ask your­self if this student body can help beat North Carolina, DePaul or Duke this year. 
Jack Hannigan Class of 1969 
Voter participation is only means of change 
Dear Editor: 
Parietals, library hours, bank hours and comprehensive exams are all is­sues that have passed or failed due to participation in the Saint Mary's com­munity. Several decisions affecting our school and social lives may or may not have been to the majority's liking. Of­ten we find ourselves complaining about a particular policy or social event during the course ot the year. Unfor­tunately, complaints to our roommates and peers do not make the necessary changes. 
The time has come again for new leaders to be chosen, and believe it or not, everyone's vote is important. In the past, voter percentages have been low, but complaints have been high. A major reason for this lack of participa­tion can be attributed to voter apathy -thinking one's vote will not make the difference in the final decision. This at­titude, though understandable, cannot be acceptable when seeking strong and competent leadership. My message to Saint Mary's students is to be aware of the upcoming elections including hall, class and student body races. Take the initiative to familiarize yourself with the candidates and exercise your right to vote. Odds are complaints will decrease, while social and academic satisfaction will increase. 
The dates for Saint Mary's elections are as follows: student body, February 18; class, February 18; hall, to be de­termined.

Artist shows true colors

I 
magine a man with ines­timable determination. Stir in the concepts of truth, honesty, and beauty and you have the perfect recipe for an artist. Albert Summerlin is just such a man. 
His art inspiration not only comes from everyday-life scenes and people, but his in­spiration also arises from his inherent need to give life to the images in his mind. This desire to glorify expression, emotion and the humanistic element of life is evident in his representa­tion of University President Fa­ther Theodore Hesburgh. 
The Hesburgh sketch, taken from a photograph, is remark­able in a truer-than-life sense. Summerlin said the motivation to do this portrait came from the photograph itself in which he recognized a great potential for recreating "that mysterious, subtle smile." 
Su-mmerlin met Hesburgh for the first time this January and said, "There's always been a certain mystery about him and I think it's really neat that a man of his caliber has time for small concerns." 
Summerlin has never had any formal art instruction, ex­cluding some commercial art courses at Ivy Tech. His talent comes from within. "The inspi­ration is there, I don't try to analyze it. I work with it; it's always been there," Summerlin said. 
Although Summerlin knew he always wanted to be an artist, there was a period in his life when he abandoned his paint­ing. There were too many other pressing committments that occupied his time. Many years later, after an accident that ren­dered him blind in one eye, he decided to return to his art. 
Summerlin faced the chal­lenge of relearning his craft without the ability of depth per­ception. Instead of decreasing and limiting hts talent, his skill and talent intensified. Summer-

lin attributes this mastering of his skill to his age-gathered wisdom and a more serious appreciation of the process behind art. 
Summerlin focused on com­mercial art because "I don't like the idea of an artist getting rich after he's dead," he joked. Summerlin's real pleasure comes from pursuing his own interests and ideas, not from receiving a commission. Sum­merlin does most of his art work in his spare time, either in the basement of Declo in his freetime or in his studio at Col-

If he's feeling good about himself, he's feeling good about his art. "Art is my little girl, my woman," said Sum­merlin. "Sometimes we fall out, then we regroup. There are arguments and uncertainties but I sleep on them for a while and then the problem is solved." 
Does Summerlin have a dream? Of course. He wants to

sit back, settle down and just concentrate on art. "I want to be what I call an artist; some­one who really knows art and has the intellect of an educated artist," said Summerlin. 
"''d like recognition by my peers along with input from other professionals. I want to know the language of art so I can talk about my art and im­prove it with new techniques," continued Summerlin. 
"Right now, my art speaks for itself. If it didn't, that would mean I would have to. I'd like to be able to do that." 

A tribute to the misrepresented Wolfe 
Special to The Obsever 
L
ook Homeward: A Life of Thomas Wolfe" (Little, Brown and Company, February 4, 1987, $24.95) is the first comprehensive biogrpahy of one of the most influential and most misunderstood writers in our country's literary history. Pulitzer Prize-winning biog­rapher David Herbert Donald ("Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War"), the only person to whom all of Wolfe's diaries, correspond­ence, manuscripts, and notes have been available, spent seven years researching the complete Wolfe archives. Donald gives us a compas­sionate biography of the enig­matic writer whose life was the basis of his art and shows that Wolfe was a careful and self­conscious li craftsman. 
Contrary to the widely held view of wolfe as an artless writer who occasionally achieved some remarkable ef­fects by pouring out millions of words that had to be selected, shaped, and formed into some­thing resembling novels by his editors, Donald demonstrates that Wolfe, the best-educated American novelist of his gener­ation, was one of the earliest literary modernists. Much in­fluenced by the novels of James Joyce and the tech­niques of the cinema, he was an experimental writer con­stantly trying out new forms and styles in his fiction. Like Ernest Hemingway, D.H. Lawrence, and Henry Miller, he drew heavily upon his own ex­periences in fashioning his novels. Donald, who has inter­viewed scores of Wolfe's friends, associates, and enemies, analyzes the mixture of autobiography and fiction 

-

that makes up Wolfe's novels. 
Here, for the first time, is an 
unvarnished account of the squalid and loveless household 
in which Wolfe lived as a child. Here, too, is the full story, told with complete candor and ex­plicitness, of Wolfe's turbulent affair with Aline Bernstein, one of the notable love stories in literary history. 
One of the most controver­
sial aspects of "Look 
Homeward" involves Donald's 
exploration of the relationship 
between Wolfe and Maxwell E. 
Perkins, his celebrated editor at 
Charles Scribner's Sons. At­
tempting to make Wolfe's fic­
tion more conventional and 
more salable, Perkins became 
deeply involved in shaping his 
books. With scrupulous fair­
ness to both Wolfe and Perkins, 
"Look Homeward" shows how 
the writer came to exercise 
such control over the author's 
creative processes that Wolfe, 
with indescribable anguish, felt 
forced to assert his indepen­
dence by breaking from 
Perkins, whom he loved and respected more than any other man. 
"Look Homeward" also ex­plores questions regarding the shaping and editing of Wolfe's posthumous novels, "The Web and the Rock" and "You Can't Go Home Again". There has been considerable controversy over the role played by Edward 
C. Aswell of Harper's, Wolfe's last editor, with some scholars even suggesting that these novels were the work of the editor, and not of Wolfe him­self. In the final chapter of "Look Homeward", Donald ad­dresses the questions about the authorship and authenticity of these novels: "I find it ab­surd to speak of Aswell as the 'author' of wolfe's posthumous novels .... Except for the intro­ductory passages linking the 'books' in these novels and for very occasional transitional sentences or paragraphs, Thomas Wolfe wrote these novels. They are not spurious or forged, and they are not the work of Edward C. Aswell." 
However, Donald argues, "It

is equally misleading to speak of Aswell's work on Wolfe's posthumous novels as simply that of an editor... Greatly ex­ceeding the professional re­sponsibility of an editor, Aswell took impermissible liberties with wolfe's manuscript, and his interference seriously eroded the integrity of Wolfe's text. Far from deserving com­mendation, Aswell's editoral interference was, both from the standpoint of literature and of ethics, unacceptable." 
In "Look Homeward" Donald untangles the complexities and contradictions of Thomas Wolfe's life and work. and brings a rare depth of under­standing and appreciation to his subject. 
Tracing the struggles of a young genius against the restrains of convention and propriety, Look Homeward is a moving account of the brief, turbulent life of a major Ameri­can writer. At the same time it is a perceptive study of how American culture has shaped and limited its creative artists.

All of this means we're going to be seeing and hearing a ship load of America's Cup stories in our papers and on our televi­sions over the next week. And with this will come the greatest number of patriotic statements over a minor sports event since the US and USSR luge teams met in the Olympics. 
Take this comment from one Gary Voce will be another thing to watch tonight. Phelps noted that his center's rebounding and post defense were most needed by the team, and that his improved scoring, such as Tuesday night's 14-point showing, is a bonus for the team. That could also go for the ACC crowds, who have taken a liking to Voce's performance.

Now, I've seen a few street fights and usually the knots in­volved aren't the kind that drive sails but rather the kind that wind up on someone's head. Sure, they christen boats by breaking a bottle on the side, but in a street fight they break them over a slow-reacting per­son's cranium. 
All in all, a street fight would be a lot more interesting.

And, that he's left the four powerful Midwest states from which he's always recruited -Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan -and opened up the whole country, including JUCO blue-chippers. And yes, that he is now playing a zone -which is even obvious to Billy P. and Dick V. What Coach Knight has shown, I think, is that great­ness in any performance is ad­justing to change, while main­taining an image of non-negotiability.

Farley, PE are favored as IH hoop wears on 


By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
It looks like Farley A and Pasquerilla East are the teams to beat in women's interhall basketball this year, but for­feits and schedule changes make it difficult to pick a clear winner. 
Farley Ais 4-0, having beaten Lyons and Breen-Phillips 'A' in early games, and also scoring victories by forfeit over Farley B and Breen-Phillips B. 
Pasquerilla East is also un­defeated at 4-0, earning its spot­less record by beating a tough Lewis A team early in the season and topping Lyons, 45­32, last Sunday. It also has two forfeit wins. Both teams hope to remain strong throughout the nine-game season, with a showdown between the two scheduled for Feb. 23. 
The 10-team women's field is heading into the second half of the round-robin schedule. The top four teams will play in an 
elimination  tournament  in  
early March.  
Last  year's champion,  the  

Lewis A team, is off to a 2-2 start this year, including Sun­day's loss to the Breen-Phillips A team. Lewis was down by 12 at the half, but managed to fight back in the fourth quarter and take a one-point lead, but B-P held on to win by three. 
"We got off to a slow start," said Teresa Buliavac, the Lewis captain. "We are making adjustments and working with some new people. We ought to do well in the rest of our games."

Swim teams face tough weekend 
By KELLY TOWNSEND Sports Writer 
Tomorrow the Notre Dame men's and women's swim teams take to the road. The Irish travel to Cleveland State for a night meet and then jour­ney to St. Bonaventure for a meet on Saturday. These two dual meets should prove to be challenges for Notre Dame. 
Last year, the Irish men's team lost both meets, and the opposition set most of the pool records at Rolfs Aquatic Cen­ter. The women fared much better last year, and are seeking to control the series. 
Coach Tim Welsh is, to say the least, excited about both meets. 
"This will be chance to show how well our program is working," said Welsh. "This is our chance to attain one of our season goals -beating teams that beat us last year. To return the favor would be incredibly exciting.'' 
While Cleveland State will have a slight advantage, the meet for the men should be a neck-and-neck race from start to finish. For the women, the advantage will go to Notre Dame. With 12 monogram­winners returning from last year, the women will have more control over their meet. 
"To win the meet, the men will need time drops in the freestyle events and significant drops in the 200-yard fly, 200­yard breaststroke and 200-yard IM," said Welsh. "Those three events are critical. We will pick up or lose needed points." 
Mter racing against the Vikings, the Irish travel to St. Bonaventure for another at­tempt at revenge. This time, however, the roles will be slightly reversed. The women will be faced with the same sit­uation the men are in against Cleveland State. 
"The women's meet will be like the men's at Cleveland," said Welsh. "The match-ups will be good, but we can win it.

The women will have to con­centrate more having had the last meet on Friday and the first on Saturday." 
The men's team will be facing one of the strongest Catholic teams in the nation. Another point for St. Bonaven­ture is its strength in Notre Dame's main events. 
"As with us, St. Bonaven­ture's strength lies in the frees­tyle sprints," said Welsh. "We're looking to come closer to them than we did last year. Winning will require a couple miracle swims." 
Coach Welsh believes this weekend is the king of back-to­hack meets for the Irish. 
"I think we'll have an excel­lent weekend," said Welsh. "We have a chance to narrow the gap against St. Bonaven­ture and set the record straight with Cleveland." 
Next week the Irish will return home for their final home meet. The women will face Ball State while the men will challange Kalamazoo. 
fense to close the gap as the first half ended with the score tied, 27-27. 
The Irish opened the second half with a tough packed-in defense of their own, and Gavin's coast-to-coast lay-up a la Magic Johnson gave the Irish a 39-34 lead with 13:34 remain­ing. 
"Mary Gavin did a great job for us," said DiStanislao. "She does what we need her to do. She gets better and better every game. A 4-11 team is hardly a showcase for a great point guard, but she is." 
Dayton's first-year head coach Sue Ramsey called a timeout to regroup her squad and the Flyers came out of the huddle strong. A seven-point Irish lead quickly dwindled and became a one-point deficit as Dayton's Michelle Kruty (11 points) hit a solo foul shot with 
8:30 on the clock. Trailing 45-44, the Irish staged a comeback of their own. 
But Toney committed a back­court foul with just 20 seconds remaining and Frericks, a .514 shooter from the charity stripe, hit the two decisive free throws for a Dayton victory. The Irish had one last chance with five ticks on the clock and the ball out-of-bounds under their own hoop. The in-bounds pass went to Toney in the corner who, fin­ding no one else open, threw up the potential game-winner which fell short.

Elway not happy with 2nd; Pro Bowl is no consolation 
Associated Press 
HONOLULU -John Elway has had a chance to reflect on that empty feeling that goes with being a Super Bowl loser. 
"It's like we were never even there," the Denver Broncos quarterback said. 
And "It's like the Giants are the only football team there is." 
Still, Elway also learned that even after the 39-20 loss to New York in Pasadena, Calif., last Sunday, the world went on spin­ning. 
"I was happy to see that the sun still came up Monday mor­ning," Elway said with a smile. 
"I rehashed the game after­ward, thought of the things I could've done differently, but you do that with every game. 
"It was such a buildup for a game," said Elway, one of five Denver players in Hawaii for Sunday's Pro Bowl. 
"We would like to have won, of course, but you never know what to expect. 
"It was disappointing for us and for our fans back in Den­ver, but we still had a great season, and we'll have the chance to make it back to the Super Bowl again." 
"If we improve in some areas, we can play with anybody," he said. 
Elway, blossoming in his fourth pro season, actually played very well in the Super Bowl. 
He wound up with 22 comple­tions in 37 attempts for 304 yards, with one interception. He threw for one touchdown and ran for another. 
But although he passed the Broncos down the field on four of their first five possessions, they came away with just 10 points. 
Elway said he'd like to finish the season on a winning note, with an AFC victory over the NFC in Sunday's all-star game. 
But then he frowned and added, "It's not much of a con­solation."

Irish fall to Dayton; Buzzer shot falls short 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
The stage was set for the Notre Dame women's basket­ball team to finally pick up that elusive clutch win, the kind that you pull out in the final minutes. 
Too many times this season the Irish have been on the losing side of these games. Last night it happened again, as Dayton came back from a seven-point deficit and defeated the Notre Dame, 55­54. 
The two teams traded the lead several times throughout the evening until the Irish made a run midway through the second half to go ahead, 43­
36. Dayton called a timeout to regroup and came back on fire, tying the game, 44-44. The teams battled on the boards un­til Notre Dame surged ahead, 54-51, with 2:20 remaining when sophomore Diondra 
Series with independents resumes as Warriors try to break ND jinx 
By PETE GEGEN Assistant Sports Editor 
The third installment of the six-part mini-series "Notre Dame vs. the Independents" takes place tonight at 7:30 as 11-6 Marquette visits the ACC. 
The Warriors are coming off a 91-89 overtime loss to Miami (Fla.). First-year head coach Bob Dukiet tried to use a two­three zone defense in that game to contain the Hurricanes' big­man, Tito Horford. 
"Marquette will mix their defenses," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. "They'll press at half court, they'll play a tight man-to-man and they'll play a zone. Marquette played a straight two-three zone to pack it in so (Horford) couldn't Toney hit two free throws. 
Two minutes later, with only 20 seconds on the clock, Dayton freshman Cindy Frericks went to the foul line and cooly sank two shots, giving the Lady Flyers the victory and drop­ping the Irish record to 4-12. 
"We had the lead and the ball with two minutes left," said a Irish head coach Mary DiS­tanislao. "We traveled twice and fouled and that was it. That was the story at the end." 
The story at the beginning was a tough Dayton defense, forcing the Irish to turn the ball over 11 times in the first half. The Flyers' full-court defense and quick two-three zone kept the Irish guards from getting the ball inside to leading scorers Heidi Bunek and Sandy Botham, giving Dayton a 13-8 lead eight minutes into the con­test. Notre Dame floor-leader Mary Gavin sparked an Irish

get the ball. And that's one of the things we can expect from Marquette if Royal turns on." 
Defense is also one of the strengths for the Irish, who are ranked seventh in NCAA team­defense with a 59.1 points­allowed average. 
On offense, Marquette fea­tures a strong frontcourt. For­ward David Boone leads the team with 17 points and 8.7 rebounds per game, and junior college transfer Mike Flory adds 12.8 points and 4.9 rebounds a game. 
Starting at center for Mar­quette is Tom Copa who, be­sides contributing 4.6 rebounds a game, is also known for his strong desire to beat Notre Dame. His frustrations must be mounting, as the Irish have

won the last six games these schools have played. 
The backcourt features junior guard Michael c:;ims, who is averaging 15.9 points a game. The other guard spot is a question mark for Marquette, as Dukiet currently has fresh­man Tony Smith starting and Pat Foley and Kevin Johnson coming off the bench. 
"(Dukiet) can go seven or eight people deep and do things," said Phelps. "You just can't take them lightly." 
There is some concern in the Irish camp concerning the con­dition of David Rivers. Phelps said Rivers has been "playing tired" and as a result might change his strategy on using
