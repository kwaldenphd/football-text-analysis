But Parietal Rules Enforced! 
The Atomic Energy Commis­sion has awarded graduate fellow­ships to two Notre Dame Seniors enrolled in the nuclear engineer­ing program in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. 
Edward Dugan of Hellertown, Pa., and John Kriese of Dallas, Texas, will receive tuition and living stipends to allow them to study nuclear engineering at the graduate level. 
The awards to Kriese and Dugan bring to 22 the number of Atomic Energy Commission fellowships awarded Notre Dame graduates since 1959. 
.. . And Fellows 
The Rev. John McCluskey, a 
doctoral candidate in philosophy at Notre Dame, has received a Woodrow Wilson Foundation Dissertation Fellowship. 
Forty-eight doctoral candi­dates at 23 graduate schools in the United States and Canada have been awarded these advan­ced fellowships. Each fellow­ship makes it possible for a stu­dent to devote full time to re­search and writing of his doc­toral thesis. 
Father McCluskey is a Mill Hill priest from Scotland.

"I had absolutely no_ intention of writing that letter before he walked into my office at 1:00 am last Friday," said Father Hesburgh yesterday. Father Hesburgh was referring to the late night interview between himself and an unidentified student which resulted in a letter written by the President of the Uni­versity to the student body reinstating the four students suspended earlier in the week by Father James Riehle, Dean of Students. 
Father Hesburgh went on to say that he will not reply to the open letter addressed to him by Dennis Gallagher and· reprinted in last Friday's Observer. "The real issue came into the open during our discussion on Friday and I tried to make that clear in my letter." 
The President of the University said that he was in no way prompted to write the letter and lift the suspensions because of threatened student demonstrations over the weekend. "I can only hope that I made it clear to everyone that the factor which caused me to change my position on this had nothing at all to do with politics or threatened demonstrations." 
Father Hesburgh said 'that he is in the process of outlining a program which he said is designed to eliminate the "moral 

this public he will have to "consult with a a lot of different people." 
Ex-Student Body President, Chris Mur­
phy, said Friday afternoon that Father 
Hesburgh's decision to reinstate the four 
students caught him completely by surprise. 
"I was on my way to charter a plane to get 
up to see Mr. Stephan (Chairman of the Board of Trustees) about this when I heard the news." Murphy said that he was highly pleased by Father Hesburgh's letter "But more than that," he said, "I'm just glad to see those guys back in school." 
Richard Rossie, who officially took office this morning as Student Body President said that he, too, was very pleased by Father Hesburgh's letter. "But," said Rossie, ."1 can­not regard this as a great victory because the letter neglects to deal with the issue of due process. This question remains unresolved." 
Rossie went on to say that several stu­
dents had congratulated him for forcing the Administration to "back down." "My ob­jective throughout the week was not to inti­midate the Administration or Father Res­burgh. My one single purpose was to get those men back into the University to be judged by a fair, unbiased pann"el." 

Hatfield Letter Urges Draft Reform 
Oregon Senator Mark 0 Hat­field, 1968 NO Mock Republican Convention nominee, has reques­ed the assistance of outgoing Student Body President Chris Murphy and the students of the University in his attempts to replace the existing draft law. 
In a letter to Murphy dated March 15, Hatfield says that the "draft system is basically inequit­
able." He suggests the establish­
ment of a voluntary system, 
claiming that "no amount of 
patching will fix a selective ser­
vice structure which is essentially 
unfair." 
Hatfield suggests that involve­
ment in the draft question re­
move the "student apathy and 
dissillunionment" on campus. 
An excerpt from the Congre­ssional Record was also enclosed which included a bill introduced by Hatfield in March, 1967 to replace the present draft sys­tem with a voluntary Armed Forces. 
Campus dissent, according to Hatfield, has centered around the new policy of drafting first and second year graduate students. Hatfield believes the protests to be misdirected, and that any objections should be aimed at the root of the problem, the selective service system. He hopes that responsible suggestions for sol­utions to the problem will create the public opinion necessary to affect the Senate. 
In introducing his own bill, Hatfield explains the reasoning behind the wish for a voluntary 
armed service. Hatfield says, "Any time a man is forced, ag­ainst his wishes into military service his individual liberty and liberty and freedom of choice have been denied." He also says the draft does not have a just and equal application to all young men. Currently only 46 percent of all men of 26 have seen military duty. Hatfield claims that there is not a uniform administration of draft regula­tions among the 4,084 local boards. 
Another of Hatfield's objec­tions is the tremendous expense incurred having to continually train draftees. Figures from the Defense Department reveal that the turnover rate of draftees is 95 percent. Finally Hatfield says that the large number of men in the military is no longer necessary due to present emphasis on high­ly sophisticated weapons sys­tems. 

According to Hatfield a volun­teer armed force would naturally allow the greatest freedom of choice and violate no one's per­sonal liberty. The inequities of the current policy would also be eliminated. The system would also be most economical and would result in a higher quality of soldier. 
Huge amounts of money would be saved because of re­duced turnover of draftees. Hir­ing civilians to fulfill non-com­bantant positions such as typists and clerks would reduce the number of men to be recruited. Presently, 43 percent of the Army has less than one year's experience. This lack of exper­ience would also be eliminated. These savings would more than offset the rise in pay scales and inducements necessary for recruitment. 
Hatfield says that President Johnson's suggestion of a lottery system only alleviates one of the many problems of the system. "The lottery just makes this denial of liberty a little more arbitrary." 
CCP Plans For 7 Days In ltllay 
The Campus Coalition for Peace Sunday revealed a com­prehensive timetable of anti-war activities leading up to the ROTC Review of May 7. The plans call for activities ranging from a soc­ial anti-mil ball to a mass march on the day of the Presidential Review. 
The timetable, prepared by the CCP planning staff, concen­trates on efforts during the first week in May. Codenamed "Sev­en pays in May," the culminat­
ing ~ffort will begin with a Viet­nam film festival the first three days in May. The festival will feature both US government and National Liberation Front Pro­paganda films, as well as docu­mentaries by such journalists as Felix Greene and David Shoe­brun. 
The Seven Days effort will continue with the anti-mil ball, a costeum party described as "the social event of the year" by one of its planners. As seen by CCP, the ball will provide an opportunity for those opposed to the Vietnam War to get toget­her in a relaxed and social atmos­phere amidst the friction and frantic activity of the final days of the Indiana Primary Cam­paign. 

The CCP plans, according to 
one of their authors, are directed at "providing responsible means of organization and expression for those who wish the Vietnam War to be stopped." 
Great Union Robbery 
An undisclosed amount of cash was stolen sometime between Fri. midnight and Sun. midnight from the Student Union office in the Lafortune Student Center. 
According to retiring Student Union President Michael Brown­ing the money stolen consisted of cash receipts from Fri. night's Henry Mancini concert at the Morris Civic Auditorium spon­
sored by the Notre Dame Social Commission. 
The fact that the cash was miss­ing was discovered late last evening and brought to Browning's attention. 
The robbery is being investi­gated by the Notre Dame Security Force under the direction of Mr. Arthur Pears.

and look upon the clergy as symbols ofit. 
What I say here is not nice, but we are in a touchy period and the administration must be aware that the clergy at Notre Dame are subject to scorn. Top administrators themselves are often viewed as' politicians and not priests. Where two years ago we were told of a pastoral gap in hushed terms, now that gap is a proven fact. To be quite blunt about it, there are many here at the University of Notre Dame who hate priests. Only with change will the tension again be modulated by love.

Student Gov. Press Object of Credit Abuse 
"If Student Government is to continue to function, we must abuse of student funds," said Farley Senior Thomas Goundrey, last year's Student Body Treasur­er. "There are two main reasons for Student Government finan­cial problems," Goundrey said. 
First, the concerts requ'ire ad­vance deposits from three thou­sand to four thousand dollars. "While the deposit is out, we of­ten find ourselves short of oper­ational funds." Usually deposits for concerts are borrowed from Mardi Gras Charity Chest and re­paid from ticket sales.

"In order to stop abuse of stu­dent funds, the Student Govern­ment will demand repayment of charges within ten days or cancel credit," Goundrey said. Also, the Senior Class will be not allowed to charge to the Student Govern­ment Press. If a student leaves at the end of the year owing the Student Government, "we will send a letter to his parents or have the debt placed on his tui­tion bill."

"Reviewing the financial year, I find that an ebb and flow of Student Government funds ex­isted," said the former Student Body Treasurer. "Money comes in during football season. But during winter, finance gets tight."

Hesburgh Calls For Academic Reform 
versity, as a distinct institution would also be discussed and re­defined. At this point Fr. Hes­burgh defended the policy of 
required theology, saying "my conviction is that never has theo­logy been more important than it is today to give meaning and dir­ection to the whole of life in all its intellectual and moral dimen­sions." 
He also placed high value in a further extension of educational media, mentioning such aids as TV, films, radio, teaching mach­ines, computers, synchronous sat­ellites, and dial access. 
Finally, the questions on in­ter-institutional, inter-cultural,. and international relationships would naturally enter into the study. 
The recommendations made by the departments will be for­warded to the College Council, then to a University-wide com­mission and ultimately to the Academic Council, for final amendment, approval, or rejec­tion. Appropriate changes should 
be implemented by the beginning of the academic year 1969-70. 
Fr. Hesburgh personally placed ::~ note of true significance in the entire study by saying "Nothing is more important to 
all of us, faculty, students, and administration."

President of the University Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, CSC, in an eleven page correspondence to faculty members last week, called for, "an intensive and 
concentrated study of the curric­ulum patterns of the department, the College and ultimately the University as a whole." The study, to be carried on by depart­mental committees, would ex­tend through the remainder of the semester and probably even through the summer. 
Fr. Hesburgh's directive urged 
a thorough probing of the "qual­
ity of our educational efforts." 
The re-examination, according to 
Fr. Hesburgh, should focus on 
specific fundamental questions. 
First, a Notre Dame education 
must cater to the needs of Notre 
Dame students. Research on aca­
demic backgrounds, intellectual 
capabilities, and reasons for com­
ing to ND, could provide val­
uable data for educating the 
student population. It is Fr. Hes­
burgh's opinion that education 
"should be made possible in an 
interesting way." 
The study would consider de­
partmental objectives, including 
the desirability of adding, com­
bining, or eliminating various 
courses to meet these objectives. 
Father Hesburgh stressed the 
necessity of real innovation.

The Issue 

Father Hesburgh's letter reinstating the four students sus­pended last week and reaffirming his stand on parietal hours marks a larger step towards making parietal hours "a phony issue" than an entire senate chamer of student demagogues and continued "power politics or guardhouse lawyering." 
We must, however, question Fr. Hesburgh's premise. The 
issue is not parietal hours. "Moral ambiguity" is a splendid 
phrase beneath which the parietals issue may be hidden. In all 
fairness, however, "moral ambiguity" must be examined as it 
extends far beyond the question of entertaining women in 
men's "bedrooms." 
The "moral ambiguity" is that found in a system of disci­pline that often time seems to have no basis other than whim. The "moral ambiguity'' is that found in the inequities in the law and in the inconsistent application of that law. 
The issue is not parietal hours or any other specific rule or regulation. The issue is that of fair judicial proceedings. 
Last weeks's student interest and unrest was not triggered 
by an overriding concern for a "phony tssue", but with the 
realization that there are no procedural cannons governing the 
rights of students accused or disciplined by the University. 
The points of law taken tor granted by a civil court are 
virtually ignored in the dealings of the administration with 
some of its less well behaved students. 
It would be absurd to speak of due process, rights of the 
accused, rules of evidence, judgement by one's peers, appel­
late proceedings, and the principles of the burden of proof 
resting with the accuser and consideration of the accused as  
innocent until he is proven guilty, with reference to too many 
actions of the part of the Administration. No ground rules 
exist. 

Even if the Administration disagrees with the student con­
tention that those who live under the rules should make them 
and enforce them, it must admit that the enforcement of 
rules by autocratic fancy and in violation of principles of 
jurisprudence is a direct contradiction to "Christian concern 
for the total spiritual and moral atmosphere on this campus." 
The issue is whether students are only second-class citizens, 
subject to a system of judicial procedings affording only 
second class justice. 
The Decision 
Now we have a choice in the elections of 1 968. In one shocking sentence at the end of a forty-five minute speech last night, President Johnson transformed the political land­scape of America. We cannot suppress our joy at his decision not to run for another term. We cannot express the depth of our gratitude that we will have a chance to transform the 
course of our nation in this election year. 
There can be no doubt that in the last three years Johnson has alienated the youth of this nation. America is at the mo­ment seemingly trapped in a brutal and inconclusive war in Vietnam. That war has sapped the strength of the United States and spawned violent conflict in the cities of our land. Last night, the unpopular President at last made a popular decision, at last took a decisive stand. That stand will allow us to, in the words of Senator McCarthy, "begin anew." 
The President has shocked us and pleased us. Now that Johnson is out, we must go forward dedicated to change. America must rise to the occasion and elect a leader in I 968.

For the last seven years the Vietnam war has been a subject of heated controversy on college campuses all across the country. Dissent has progressed from the "maniacal fringe" at Berkeley in 1961, to our present day, when opposition to the war has become the "in" thing among the young intellectuals of America. 
Ivory tower discussions have taken place over a wide variety of stimulants, but in the past the war still remained something far away. Now, however, with the recent decision of General Hershey and Co., all but eliminating occupational and graduate school defer­ments, the question of Vietnam and the draft has become an im­mediate problem for college students. 
War has been disclaimed as immoral as far back as two thousand years ago, when a man named Jesus preached for peace. In con­temporary society, reason has been given superiority over the in­
tuitive soul, but the insanity of our present government's actions has even brought the hardest political pragmatists, the followers of real politic philosophy, to label U.S. intervention in Vietnam as immoral and unjust. 
Recently, the Mock Political Convention and the McCarthy campaign have been promoted as "the" form of action for those opposed to the war. These efforts are a hope, and a vote for peace is a good thing, but as Thoreau stated, "voting for the right is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should prevail." If a vote is to have any meaning, it must be backed up with a real and personal commitment by the individual. 
Many students declare their opposition to the war and then 
allow themselves to be drafted, because they feel they "have to obey their country first." If one believes that our government's policies are wrong, then this is only weakness or an expression 
of pure chauvinism at best. The mam qualities in man, which separate him from the animal, are his reason and moral conscience, and if he violates these and bows to the authority of the govern­ment, then he becomes nothing more than a dog on a leash. 
If the only alternatives which our government presents, to those of us who are opposed to the war, are the army,jail, or emigration, then the only decision for the moral individual lies between the latter two. Three years in prison, or the life of an expatriate, are 
not easy roads, but if one feels .that the war in Vietnam is immoral, then to refuse army induction is the only decision that can be con­scientiously made. As Joan Baez has said, "the only way to stop killing is to stop killing." There can be no buts.

Love Is Forever Changing 
By JACK LAVELLE The underground scene in Los Angeles is, from all reports, not one of the friend­liest things on Mother Earth. What with the cops and how the neo-nazis model themselves after the L.A. Police Force. Tense all the time. That is why there are saturnalian overtones like the Doors and · Clear Light, tragic and sad things like the Byrds ("Everybody's Been Burned" and "Draft Morning"), and Love. Why also that there is more of a social conscious­ness in L.A. Rock, as opposed to the delicate fantasies of San Francisco. Be­cause L.A. is Golden America, baby and we are going to keep it that way so there's no room for long-haired creeps. 
So you fight a long battle for your hair, your acid, and your life, even. Then you realize that they can very well step on all of you if someone will let them, ("Con­centration Moon" by Mothers), and you are NOT going to be so silly as to go back to ''yuh doan believe we're on the eve of destruction", because yelling doesn't real­ly get anywhere, so you make Forever Changes, which is as tough as it is gentle. 
The big rumor was that Arthur Lee had done an overdose of heroin, and had known that he was going to do some­thing like that, and so created sober fatalism frORl the awareness. "This is the 
time and life that I am living/ and I'll face it with a smile/ for the time that I've been given is such a little while ..." Well I guess that he is still alive, and it is no disappointment. 
Love is about loneliness in the flower 
power generation, about drugs in the Negro ghetto ("here where everybody's painted brown/ and if you feel that's not the way/ ... paint everybody grey"), about sweet visions that come up broken by the ugly real scenes that are still what is. Country Joe's world is very and thoroughly exhilirating, but maybe (grud­' gingly) it's gotta be some other way for now until ...then, when there are "Bot­

Some people will get "clean for Gene" and others will believe in God, others will understand that there "are no games, to only pass Jhe tim~." Others will fall in Love. 
The hip world has been afflicted with yet another journalistic sore. It has not been enough that our people are embar­assed by the "dirty word for dirty word's sake" school of underground literature, as championed by the East Village Other and L.A. Free Press. Now the Hearst Corporation has invaded the fading scene. Their Eye, though perhaps not so jaun­diced as William Randolph's (circa 1898), nonetheless remains a usual flaccid out­side-looking -in-on-the-funny -people at­

They have money, and pretty pictures, and lousy posters, too. They also have people who can't write a word but all this doesn't make too much difference except when they offend me. Which isn't very easy, except ... 
If anyone wants to read music reviews, subscribe to Crawdaddy! in New York or Rolling Stone in San Francisco. Be­cause you KNOW that Eye does. Primar­ily what I am mad about is their review and harsh treatment of perhaps my fav­orite record, Forever Changes by Love. As I said, they subscribe to Crawdaddyl Whoever wrote for Eye perhaps cannot read. Man, it is understood that Forever Changes is a great record. That is why Crawdaddy! launches into its own diffi­cult categorizations about Byrds and Mick Jagger in relation to Love. Eye doesn't 
quite know what to make of Arthur Lee's "inordinacy", doesn't understand the un­believable soft resilience of what can be termed perhaps methedrine morning ten­derness.

Editor: 
In Wednesday's edition of the Observer, Tom Figel stated that President Johnson "has become insane." Even for a politically naive person like Mr. Figel this personal attack has to be a new low in his constant criticism of America's Vietnam policy. 
It is obvious why Mr. Figel, a Notre Dame senior with all the knowledge of a top government official, considers our President to be insane. The President and the decisions he makes concern­ing our Vietnam involvement are not being affected by the criti­cism, the ridicule, and the per­sonal abuse directed at him by Mr. Figel and by many others who share the frustration of his political philosophy. 
In his deranged state, Presi­dent Johnson envisions thou~ sands of well-trained, well-armed North Vietnamese troops and tons of military supplies cross­ing the DMZ into South Viet­nam. He thinks that thousands of civilians die at the hands of Viet Cong terror squads directed and encouraged by Hanoi. He attempts to negotiate with the North Vietnamese aggressors who utilize the N .L.F. front as a psychological and political wea­pon . . a weapon by which too many American minds have been wounded. He orders bombipg raids which destroy military in­stallations and enemy personnel, hamper military mobility, and save American lives. He justifies the deaths of 20,000 Americans by reiterating those ideals of democracy for which America fought a similar limited war in Korea at the time when our conscience-stricken generation was beginning to experience the blessings of "imperialistic" Amer­ica. In his insanity, our President has lost the moral sense apd honor exemplified by our moral­ly indignant society. He is waging an ~erican war in an attempt to avert Ho Chi Minh's Com­munist domination of South Vietnam. 
Yes, Mr. Figel, President John­son is insane. And you are in­dubitably correct-in your judg­ment of President Johnson's in­sanity and in your position on the Asian situation. Your bril­liant comments and amusing. criticisms are surpassed only by your political ignorance and poor taste. 
Aided by your astute charac­ter defamation, President John­son may soon experience a great awakening... and Ho may count yet another wounded mind. And maybe someday, hopefully soon, your brilliant criticismand cour­ageous condemnation, Mr. Figel, will be supported by equally bril­liant and realistic solutions to the problems which confront our "insane President." 
Respectfully, Tony Jeselnik

Student responsibility is dead. It breathed its last in the forced triple passion pits of Zahm Hall. A specific breach of parietal hours is of little concern to the student body, yet it is of great concern that a large portion of Zahm Hall knew of this incident and no hall judicial board was convened. 

Once again Mr. Rossie has been knifed in the back by an apathetic and immature student body. It must be with great per­sonal embarrassment that he con­tinues to demand more rights when the few scant responsibili­ties the students now possess

After reading the article in the March 29 Observer concern­ing alleged unjust grading on the part of the Department of Mod­ern Languages in its beginning Spanish sections, I feel compel­led to speak out in defense of Asst. Prof. Francisco Moreno, who was specifically mentioned in the article, as well as his assist­ant Spanish teachers. I also took the Spanish 12 departmental mid-term and, although I will readily admit that it was more difficult than any of the exams given during the first semester, it is my contention that those stu­dents who were dissatisfied with the results of this test have only themselves to blame for their poor performance. 
The truth of the matter is that most of the students in the be­ginning Spanish sections signed up for the course because they had heard that Spanish was an "easy" language-as if language learning were an easy process. Being completely unmotivated, these students are attempting to sneak through the course with­
out any outside study. Many of them did in fact succeed at this during the first semester because of an extremely liberal grading policy, but one cannot reason­ably expect to do well in a five­credit course if one does not do a considerable amount of work­and in language learning, "work" is the proper term-on one's own. 

Many of these students who would complain about their grades have not only neglected to complete outside assignments, but have also succeeded in wast­ing much valuable class time by attempting to prevent their in­structor from covering scheduled course material during the daily class meetings through the use of various diversionary tactics which are strictly "high school." 
Somehow I just can't feel any compassion for the persons who 
signed the petition which was 
mentioned in your article, for 
they have merely confirmed in 
writing what their instructors 
have known for quite some time 
now; that is, that they are not 
mature enough to accept the re­
sponsibility of being a student. 
Sincerely, 
Charles J. Frantz

BENGAL BOUTS WRAP-UP 
The Beng;tl Bout' 37th edition closed down the Fieldhouse with typically wild brawls and tight decisions Fri. night. 
Jed Ervin upset last year's 155 lb. champion Jim Loverde in the champion­ship bout of two fights at that weight. Since both fighters were punchers, all three rounds were jammed with one KO punch after another. Ervin blasted through Loverde's blows in the initial two rounds and hung on in the final three minutes for 
' the unanimous decision. Ervin earned himself the Larry Ash Trophy for best boxer of the tournament by overturning last year's loss to Loverde. 
The other 155 lb. bout was no less a feature, pitting the losers in Wednesday's semifinal action, Mike Lavery and Kent Casey. The crowd roared its approval as 
the fighters bombed each other until Casey blasted under a Lavery lunge an<t laid him out for the only knockout of the tourney. Casey ended two-time champion Lavery's bid for a third in only l: 19 of 
 the first round. 
Chuck Landolfi's expected dominance in the heavyweight final paled in the third round as freshman Denny Allan was neither awed nor bothered by Lando~fi's sty1ish dancing tactics. Finally it was Lan­~olfi's quickness that won him the deci­sion after Allan bounced from the ropes in the third round and knocked down the much larger football player. 
Quick fists and a fine ability to slip earned Ed Ferrer of Panama the 127 lb. title over Dave Krashna. 
John McGrath's combinations and spe­ed rendered ex-champion Larry Broder­ick's jabs ineffective, giving McGrath the 135 lb. title. Broderick's comeback in the third round was neither strong enough nor early enough. McGrath, president of the Boxing Club, was awarded the Nappy Trophy. 

Paul Partyka won a popular decision over Tom Dorset in the 145 lb. final. Partyka effectively counter punched Dor­sel's charges in the last round. The crowd was disturbed by Dorsel's clinching in the early rounds, until Partyka began pound­ing Dorsel's body in the clinches. 
The 150 lb. bout featured two boxers, Dave Pemberton and Jim Hansen, with little damage being done in the first two rounds. In the final stanza Pemberton slipped under Hansen's jabs and was able 
to land often enough to gain the decision. After adjusting to the other half of the left-handed McGrath coningent, Mike Sha­

The condition of baseball's minor leagues has become such that these once proud institutions are now cannon fodder for the war on poverty. Seedy parks with unseedy playing fields are now a remind­er of what once was. In fact, so many minor league teams are operating in the red that the majority of the crowd is made up of people from the CIA. 
The reason ·for this demise can per­haps be seen in the nature of baseball itself. Every major sport, with the excep­tion ·of baseball, has defined limits of space and time. For the spectator, a game can run on into reality. 
The rise of football and basketball have shown the public defined microcosms of sport; a sub-world completely apart from reality where one can vicariously play the game without fear of his escape 
being detected. Also, the other sports have drawn away many of the great athletes (e.g. Kevin Hardy) that once would have gone to baseball. 
But back to the minors. Perhaps their true condition could be better illustrated by an interview I once had the pleasure of doing with Yogi Snodgrass, president, general manager, manager, coach, grounds­keeper, umpire and shortstop for the Tomkinsville, Conn., Flying Tigers. I ap­proached Yogi as he was lining the batters 
box with the fungo bat. "How does the team look this year, coach, etc.?" "Undernourished. I hope the outfield­
ers  find  some  game  today,  we  haven't  
eaten  in  four  days."  
"Game?''  

"Yes. I'm training them by having them hunt rabbits and coons. If they find any, we eat." 
"Do you look for an increase in atten­dance t,his year?" 
"De~nitely. The left fielder's wife had effer kept away from and began landing over Bob McGrath's jabs. Shaeffer was rocked several times in the first round un­til he solved McGrath's style and won the unanimous decision. 
Two newcomers in the 167 lb. class battled in the final, with Chris Servant's jab gaining him the unanimous decision over Mike Downey. 
Tom Breen's deliberate attack on Tom Etten helped him control the fight and win the championship at 177. He gave Etten an incessant pounding about the head as be hit inside Etten's left hook. 
Two freshmen, Hank Meyer and Matt Conally met in the 185 lb. class. In a ragged fight, Meyer falted Connally's rushes to win the title. 
Tom Suddes was awarded the Best first Year Boxer Award, and Tony Kluka the Best Losing Fight in dropping a deci­sion to Denny Allan Wed. night. Tom Etten was the most improved boxer and Kevin Coyle won the Sportsmanship Tro­phy.

"How about big crowds?" 

"We couldn't handle them if we had them. We had to chop up the bleachers to use them as fire wood last winter." 
"That's a shame." 

"Not really. It should make it more di­fficult for our opponents to hithomeruns." Here we were interrupted by one of the players who had to borrow Yogi's bat be­cause it was time for batting practice. 
"Do you draw on the road?" 

"Only if there is a knifing or something near the ball park. We tried a suicide squeeze last year in Cos Cob and our batter killed himself. We had a thousand 
people there in no time.  
"Ho\V  do  you  get  to  these  away

"I  can  take  four in  my  car.  And  I  

like to have the pitchers run along out­side-keeps their legs in shape." "Aren't they too tired to pitch?" "Certainly. But at the end of the season we enter them in marathons and usually make some dough hocking the trophies." "I wonder if I could talk to Pinky Schwartzburg, your star center fielder?" "You could if he were here. Pinky's 
down at the creek doing the laundry." "Well, how's Pinky coming along?" "He was doing great until he found 
marijuana growing in center field. Now he tries to make shoe string catches with his shoe strings." 
"Are you going to have a pitching coach this year?" 
"Sort of. We're distributing mimeo copies of Red Smith's column about Whitey Ford. And we have an instruction­al record made by Bob Feller. 
"God! With all of these difficulties,
