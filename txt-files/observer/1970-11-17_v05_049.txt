Opinions on drugs aired 
Dr. Kane felt that we live in a "drug culture" because of the high use of alchohol and pre­scription drugs. 
Referring to the process of matur:Jtion among todays youth Pullapilly said, "m;,turation brings anxiety, and in society you're supposed to take pills when you are anxious." 
The final speaker was Dr. George N. Schuster, the assistant to the President of Notre Dame. He spoke about a study con­ducted in a one block area of New York that is two-thirds Puerto Rican and one-third black. From the study he con­cluded that 1) there were l 00 addicts in 65 families, and that coccaine was the worst abuser 2) in clinics, everyday in New York, many addicts die from drugs 3) out of this block very few women were addicted 

4) there was no correlation between J.Q., personality, and the usc of drugs 5) over one-third have given up drug use, only two used the methadone treatment (synthetic narcotic used to rid heroin users of the physical need) 6) coccaine and hashish may be more dangerous than heroin, and finally 7) 42% of the families on the block feel they will never get off welfare. 
Dr Schuster feels that if mari­juana were legalized, taxed, and' licensed, the novelty would surely wear off and that the Justice Department should em­phasize their effort on the con­trol of har,d drugs. 
Weekend thefts reported 
By Pat Gooley Several thefts occurred over the weekend, and complaints about certain student activities were sent to the campus security force. Compared with recent weeks, though, there were fewer serious matters to report. During the football game Saturday, someone stole about $500 worth of clothing and merchandise from a car in one of the parking lots. No more

Officials at the Rock have complained that some students have been lending ID cards to non-students who wish to use the facilities there. This is against university rules.

Two new committees started at S M C 
By Kathy Schwille Two new committees have been established at SMC, one to revise the Inter-Cultural program and a second to redefine the goals of the college. The Inter-Cultural committee, which should complete its job by December I, concerns foreign and black students on campus. Their main job, according to Sister Alma, is "to study care­fully the proposal of last year under which the program worked and to make the necessary revisions" to streng­then the effectiveness of the program.

campaign is aimed at the voter 
who is discontent with the 
restraints put on Sophomores, 
who wants coeducation, and who 
doesn't believe that locking the 
campus up like a prison is the 
answer to our security problems. 
It is for the student who wants to 
hear from his administration after 
it is elected. It is for the student 
who is tired of just complaining 
and wants some action. 

As Freshmen, we have the most 
at stake in the changes taking
