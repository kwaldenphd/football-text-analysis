by Bob Mader Executive News Editor 
Dr. Emil T. Hofman is in the running for the office of the Dean of the Freshman Ycar of Studies. Hofman's resignation from the post had been announced on February 16. 
·'The prime reason why I have changed my mind and would like to continue in this job and would hope to be selected by the commit­tee is that I want to he able to continue working with freshmen in the way that I have in the past few years.;, Hofman said. "1 think that it is the most important job that I could do in the remainder of my career." he added. 
Fr. Mirhacl J. Murphy, C. S.C., chairman of the search Committee for the Dean of the Freshman Year, emphasized that Hofman will not automatically continue in office since he has already resigned. Other candidates will be consider­ed he said. 
Hofman. who has been Dean of the Frl'~hmanYear since 1971. said he accepted his appointment with the expectation that he could complete other projects in which he was involved. He was the chairman of "an important pro­ject" for the Division of Chemical Education for the American Chern· ical Society. Director of the Notre Dame Tcat·hcr Training Institute in Chemistry. and the Director of the 
25th  ln.tcrnational  Science  and

The Saturday class day added to next fall's calendar is now changed from September II to October 9. university officials announced yes­terday. The change applies to both Notre Dame and St. Mary's calen· dars due to student co-exchange in classes. 
The switch came in lieu of an anticipat<:d announcement by ABC­TV Sports that the Notre Dame­Pittsburgh football game. original­tv schl·duled for October 9 at Notre 6ame. will be played here on SeptL·mbl·r II and tdcvised by the network. 
NCAA rl·gulations rc4uire ABC to show only 2 games in any regular football season. ABC will televise the NO-Alabama game on Nov. 13. 1976 and the NO-USC game on Nov. 27. 1976. If ABC decides to show the Pitt. game it must precedl' the season opener with Purdue on Sept. 18. 1976. This would conform with NCAA regula­
ions. 
withdrawn from these projects at 
that time, they would have been 
jeopardized. Consequently, he 
decided to accept the appointment 
as dean while continuin_g the 
projects. All of these projects were 
completed by the summer of 1974. 
Hofman said he "has a very 
special commitment and dedica­
tion to completing his hook on 
general chemistry and films, vidio· 
tapes and audio tapes to accom· 
pany the book as teaching aids. 
He discovered this fall that he 
was unable to make the progress he 
wanted on the completion of the 
hook and teaching aids and. there­
fore. decided he could not both 
finish his project and remain as 
Dean of the Freshman Year. 
Consequently, he decided to resign 
his position as dean. 
After he resigned, Hofman was approached by a number of stud· ents who said they were unhappy with that decision. "I was very touched by these expressions, very touched," Hofman said. 
Hofman was recently notified by the Search Committee that several people had submitted his name for the position and he accepted the nomination. "I told them I would gratefully and enthusiastically ac­cept the nomination," he said. The dean said he decided that his first priority should be with the Fresh· man Year of Studies. 
Hofman's performance in the last tivc years will now become a consideration of the Search Com· n1ittcc. accordin_g to Murphy. 
Saturday class switched for Pitt game television 
. 
Dean of Administration leo Corbaci has changed next semester's Saturday class because of anticipated switch of the NO-Pitt game 

According to Fr. Edmund Joyce, University Executive Vice Presi­dent. Notre Dame and Pittsburgh have agreed to change the date. hut negotiations arc still being finalized with ABC. "There are all sorts of things involved in this,., .Joyce acknowledged. 
The calendar change was imple­mented by Leo Corbaci, Dean of Administration. Corbaci's office recently received the calendar which has been approved by the Academic Council. 
"I thought I had cleared this," remarked Corhaci, referring to the l'onflict. "The simplest way out of this was to change the class day." he noted. Corbaci added that St. Mary's administration was inform­ed o.f the move and they agreed. 
The October 9 class day will follow a normal MWF schedule because it is replacing classes that would have occurred on the day after Thanksgiving, in accordance with the revised calendar. The change will result in four MWF classdays being held in the space of a week.

Murphy stressed the importance of the Dean of Freshmn Year on the lives of Notre Dame undergrad­uates. "Some of the finest statements which have been receiv­ed by our committee to date have come from Notre Dame's current undergraduates," Murphy said in praise of Hofman. 
The committee is now solicitinl! opinions on both the positive and negative aspects of the Freshman Year of Studies and Murphy asks that all comments be sent to him in his capacity as chairman of the committee. 
Hofman's decision was well re­ceived by a number of Notre Dame administrators. 
Dr. Isabel Charles, dean of the college of Arts and Letters, said she is "delighted." ''I'm happy to hear he's put his name in for consideration," she said.

Court rules in Quinlans' favor, daughter will be allowed to die 
THENTON. N.J. (AP) -Karen Anne Quinlan's father won the right in New Jersey Supreme Court on Wednesday to allow his coma­tose daughter to die. climaxing a legal battle he began almost a year ago. 
The court. in a 7-0 ruling. appointed .Joseph Quinlan legal guardian of his 22-ycar-old daughter and said he could let her die if he can lind competent medical authorities who agree with him that there is no reasonahk pos~ibility of her recovery. 
The New Jersey attorney gene, said there would he no immediate decision on whether the state would appeal the deciskm. Joseph and Julia Quinlan said they would not ask to have their daughter's respirator disconnected until the 
state  has  time  to  decide  on  a  
possible appeal.  .  .  
The doctors  now  treatmg  M1ss  

Quinlan had fought against her parents' suit to turn off the support systems which have kept the young .;oman breathing since shortly after she fell into the coma on April IS. 1975. She has never regained consciousness. 
After the court's decision was announced. Karen's parents told a news conference at their parish church in Mount Arlington that they expected that the hospital caring for Karen would comply with the ruling. even though it had opposed the Quinlans' suit. 
''This is the decision we have been praying for," Julia Quinlan said. 
Asked about her daughter's prospects for recovery. Mrs. Quin­lan said: "There is no hope and there hasn't been any. If we had any hope we would never have started this." 
"We hope at the last minute the Lord will take her and we won't have to remove her from the respirator," Joseph Quinlan said. 
The court said if the Quinlans choose to let their daughter die, "this decision should be accepted by a society the overwhelming majority of whose members would, we think, in similar circumstances exercise such a choice in the same way for themselves or for those closest to them." 
Paul Armstrong. attorney for the Quinlans, said the ruling "leaves Mr. Quinlan free to return his daughter to her natural life proces­ses. If those processes can't sup­port her, she will die." 
The court, in the opinion written by Chief Justice Richard J.

Liquor Board gives advice: don't sign bars' affidavits 
by Karen Sikorski Staff Reporter 
Students who try to enter bars 
with a false lD should think twice 
about signing affidavits claiming 
that they arc 21. advises the 
Indiana Liquor Excise Control 
Board. 
A minor who signs such a form "can be arrested for possession of false idcntitication and falsitication of identification to obtain alcoholic beverages." according to Major Hoss Portalcse, executive officer of enforcement for the board. The form could then be presented as evidence in court. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a $500 fine and six months in jail. 
The form was used by the management of Fat Wally's at Friday's junior class Happy Hour. Rob Tully, junior class president, said "a number of students were asked to sign when the checkers at the entrance were not satisfied with the identification presented. The person who signs the affadavit affirms that he or she is 21 and releases the management from responsibility in case of a raid on the bar." 
Tully further commented, "sev­eral students left the bar when asked to sign the paper." He suggested that those who left probably did not have valid !D's. For this reason, Tully feels that asking students to sign a form might he a "psychological" tactic 
"The form docs not alway~ release the management from re­sponsibility." said Portalesc. "We still take the position that the management has the main rcspnn­sibility" for determining the age of patrons, he added. He pointed out. however, that the number nf min­ors in a bar during a raid i~ taken into account by the judge at control board hearings. "One or two" minors would not count too hea\ ily 
against  an  establishml'nt.  Porto­ 
lese  said,  admitting  that  some  
minors look older than 21.  

Ken Pocppclman, of Notre Dame Legal Aid and Defender Associa­tion, agreed that the signed form would not always excuse the m:tn· agement in case of a violation. "But the fact that the managcml'nt asked customers to sign the form could be used in defense of the establishment," Pocppelman ->aid. "It would show that they (the management) had made a sincere effort to make sure their patmns were of legal age." he adtled. Poeppelman also pointed out that bars, such as Fat Wally's, which have been raided several times, may have instituted the practic<· to "limit their legal liability" and improve their image with the Liquor Control Board.

Distributed to ND faculty 
AAUP composes collective bargaining survey 
by Maureen Flynn Campus Editor 
The Notre Dame chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AA UP) composed a questionnaire on collective bar­gaining for distribution to all fanllty members last night. 
In a recent survey of AA UP chapter members. 94 percent indi­l'atcd a need to poll the entire fanlltv for their opinions on the colle~·tivc bargaining issue. Another M pt:rcent favored an effort on the part of the chapter to offer itself a~ a collective bargain­ing agent. 
ProL James Robinson. chapter presidcnl. told members he hopes till· AAUI' will "get enough feed­back from the faculty as a whole to dl'lcrmine what action we should take in the fall." 
Robinson noted that the quest­ionnaire i~ <.:omplctcly unoflkial and in no way binding on those who respond. 
The questionnaire first asks fac­ultv to indicate which :rspects of Uriivcr~ity governance. faculty grievance procedures and salary questions are of concern to them. Faculty arc then requested to give their impressions of the relative merits of collective bargaining and current procedures in dealing with the issues. 
Speaking for himself, Robinson said he supports collective bargain­ing at Notre Dame because "When you have a faculty that should be listened to--a good faculty--then they should participate in Univer­sity government." 
l{obinson said he thinks the "faculty perspective would be val­uable" and that collective bargain­ing would offer a "more intimate" setting for discussion than current­ly exists. 
· Edward Vasta, AAUP member and chairman of the English department, said he was "used to thinking of rollertivc bargaining in terms of issues and ills to be remedied," but that he had started thinking of it "more positively as a good instrument fur faculty organi­zation." 
"A number of these issues represent areas defined here (Not­re Dame) by the University alone," Vasta observed. "I wonder if the farulty might not entertain the idea

In· ()a\'id Bcno Staff Rlportcr 
In a memo to all WNDU staff llll'lllhcr~ la~t week, Mr. William T. Hamilton, Station Manager at WNDU. announced "new progress in two long-standing goals of the WNDU Station!>: to bdter serve the cdurational goals of the University of Notre Dainc and to strengthen thl' personnel responsibilities and functions within our organization." 
In rdcrcm:c to the first goal, WNDU will sponsor individual intcrn~hips and a tclcrommunica­tion~ course. under the direction of Mr. lfarrv Kevorkian, director of New~ an(l Public Affair!>. 
Kl'vnrkian mentioned that the <.,lation offered a teleromrnunica­tion~ cour~e about ten years ago. but for ~oml' reason it· was elim­inatl'(l. Whik the linal details of thl' pr·opo~l'd cour~c have not been workl'd out. Kevorkian hopes that thl' l'Ollr~c will he more structured than in till' pa~t ~o a~ to assist in the awarl'ne~s and education of ... tudcnh who might be intl'festcd in bmadrasting careers. 
I he purpose of the class is to provide the hasir foundations for the tl'kcommunications licld in a survl'Y type course, with attention paid to practical considerations as Wl'll a~ concepts and theories. Kevorkian stressed the importance of all three. The tclccommunira­tions roursc, Kevorkian added, rould also be a means to stimulate student interest in broadcasting ror the station. This l'Oursc will be offered in this year's summer 
session and next year as an American Studies course. 
Employment of the WNDU facil­itics is another aim ~11: the. station's new program; parttctpatmg stud­cnts will hav~ arccss to WNDU's 
laborato:y tor pro~urtron and 
l'Orn mcrcral broadcastmg. 
WNDU is also planning a new intcrn~hip program. which Kevork­ian hopes will be more structured and intense than the present program. News, ncwswriting. photography ancl production will be included in the new program. 
Since Kevorkian's new duties will limit the time for his usual daily functions at the station, WN.DU has also appointed Mr. Mike Collins, a co-anchorman on the evening newscasts. Assistant Dircl'lor of News and Public Affairs to compensate. 
Kevorkian commented that the station, whil'h had been consider­ing such a program for a long time, is enthused about this new under­taking. "The new project is another example of the university­community working together," he added.

of collective bargaining simply as a more sophisticated way of organiz­ing." 
Robinson stated that "one sus­
picion" frequently held about col­
lective bargaining was that "aca­
demic problems would be referred 
to non-academic people." He noted 
that most collective bargaining 
contracts outline the "steps pur­

SMC softball becomes reality 
by Mary Rukavina Staff Reporter 
A woman's softball team is a reality for St. Mary's this year. The team was organized early last fall by a few interested students, and tlirough their efforts has gained considerable enthusiasm. 
Team member Claire Hatch, one of the early organizers, stated "the idea originated last fall, but only a few students showed an interest. Now however,with the publicity and spring sea~.on upon us, enthusiasm has grown." She added that ap­proximately forty girls arc now on the team. 
The team for all practical pur­poses is on a varsity level status, although technically they arc still ronsidcrcd a club. Hatch explain­ed: "we just aren't funded this year herause the athletic budget for this year had already been drawn up and we needed a year to organize and prove ourselves as a team. Next year we will be admit­ted as a varsity team." 
A schedule of four games for the ~pring, an opening day game April '2nd at Fort Wayne and games 
:th Purudc and Goshen are plan­:d. The fall schedule has yet to be . nnounccd. 
Hatch cited the limited schedule resulting from "not many schools ncar us have softball teams and the fad that this is our first organized ve:rr. · Practice for the team is on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thurs­day nights from S:30 until 7:00.

Robinson said a collective bar­gaining contract is not unlike a faculty manual. "The difference is that there is a system to go to when problems arise," he said. The chapter president also noted that most collective bargaining con­tracts contain "no strike, no walk­out" clauses. 
Earlier this year, the AAUP and the Faculty Senate cosponsored a series of informal discussions on collective bargaining with guest­speakers from the AAUP and several institutions where faculties arc collectively represented. 
Robinson said a chapter ncw~­lettcr will be sent out soon with further information concerning the issue and that the questionnaire will be circulated within two week~.

Lenten Decision 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii joe g ;II 
The story of St. Paul's journey to Damascus is not a new one, even to several heathen friends back home. As I recall, Paul was sitting leisurely on his horse, quietly riding away from Jerusalem. And except for the killing, persecution, and general harassment of a few Christians , he was just minding his own business. 
Suddenly, lighting struck, he was thrown off his horse, blinded for three days, and met some dude named Ananias, who helped him regain his sight. The rest of the story---Paul's conversion, preaching, and writing---is, in the eyes of the Freshman Year of Studies, a vocational triumph. 
After all, what would you do if you were walking down the South Quad, were struck by lightning, blinded for three days, and called by the Lord to be his soldier, to serve as a man of the cloth? Divine inspiration just doesn't come that often; would you still want to be a chemical engineer? I don't think so, but I really wish it were that easy. 
It seems that nowadays. heavenly vocation cards just aren't sold, and spinning the big employment wheel merely yields the double zero of a recession, Not only that, but most of the time there's not even a clear-cut choice between door number one, two, or three, between accountant, economist, and businessman. And if what turns up behind Monty's door is something you can't use, or worse, something you don't like, the big deal of the day is a death sentence to four years of futile study. 
Maybe it's the spring that bothers me ... a season of renewal, a celebration of the Lamb's suffering and sacrifice. A time of introspection, a time when inner evaluation leads to unavoidable decision, A year ago---deciding where to further my education, a panorama of intellectual colors demanding discernment. Choosing a major---for that matter, choosing a lifestyle. 
Spring can bring problems. 
How can I relate these feelings in an analogy that would capture the essence of this indecision? The mind catapults from one field to another, and even writing is a matrix of confusion. One is reminded of James Joyce, revisited in this stream offoolishness. 
One has changing impressions, changing goals .. , . Once, the 
clanging bells, ladders and red trucks of a fireman seem~d e~ticing. At the sensitive age of ten, the mystery, aura, and burnmg mcense of a magnificent and ornate Catholic church thrust a fear of the Lord into an innocent acolyte, a trembling Stephen Dedalus hearing the call of God. Later, the altruistic and powerful figure of a media-created lawyer possessed a surety and confidence that satisfied an adolescent's search for his own security. 
Those days are gone, and now the time of lounging in fantasies of vocational stardom is over. Leisure becomes work, fantasy becomes reality. 
I wish there was some sign of reassurance. of a hope that the eventual decision is correct. There's only one person you can ask, and He doesn't seem to be talking, although one is left with a sense of not even talking himself. After all, do you ever telephone a friend, and not say anything? How is He supposed to know what you're trying to tell him, when you won't even make the effort to talk? 
It's probably just the Lenten season, and those feelings of guilt brought about by not talking are like the miniature revolvers against the forehead, but this year, I'm not going to search the mail for a spiritual roadmap when I won't even drive into the filling station, 
I'm gonna pray,

Footsie, lnd.--In his new book to be published next month by Saturday Review Press-Dutton, pidiatrist Bill Rossi takes a look at the titillating(?) aspects offootwearfashion throughout history. He includes curious bits of psychological opinion and a review of some kinky practices related to sex, feet and shoes. Is the foot, and by extension the shoe. a sex symbol? Did you know that foot tickling was popular among the Russian nobility before the Revolution? Have you always loved tassel mocs but never known why? For these. and other startling answers, read The Sex Life of the Foot and Shoe.

Two business firms tied for an award--the Falstaff Brewing Co. for bicentennial beer cans, and the Jackson Casket Co. for its red, white and blue flag-lined caskets. The "Bob and Betty Sanders Show" on WBBM in Chicago was cited for the greatest verbal abuse of the 200th birthday. The couple frequently remarked that they were "in it for the buck. anyway."

This doesn't make sense 
by Barbara Zeer Lay-Out Editor 

Ex-Student Body President Fred B~Tned is still complaining that the Absurder emphasizes the failures of student government and treats their accomplishments as not being newsworthy enough to print. In a special news conference yesterday Byrned set the record straight once and for all. 
Byrncd claims he was responsi­ble for the good lobbying effort to lower the drinking age in Dome­land. He gives Louie, Nickie and Wally credit for their help. "I was also responsible for the Laugh-In earlier this year." he said. 
Byrncd also said it was his doing that the Mardi Gras was such a success this year. "I went out and sold two raffle tickets. and I know the students followed from my example." he stated. 
The ex-president also claimed to have added immensely to the revenue of the Huddle and Ice

Motleys choose Wallace, Bremer 
by Elmo Slobodnick Prune Editor 
Demonstrating lethargic concern for political reality, delegates to the Motley Political Convention nom­inated Alabama Governor George Wall ace as the 1976 Democratic presidential candidate on the twenty-sixth ballot at 6:30 a.m. Saturday. 
Later Saturday, delegates en­raged by the choice struck back by drafting Arthur Bremer for the vice-presidential spot. 
The circumstances of Wallace's victory were explained by Jim "Whizz" Raynoll, temporary chairman for the convention. 
"Well, you see there were three delegates still awake when we held the twenty-sixth roll call vote and the guy from Alabama cast his delegation's nine votes for Wallace and the votes for Udall from the

Mitchell Gwynne, chairperson of the Sophomoric Illiterate Celebra­tion (SIC) Committee, announced today that five people have agreed to make guest appearances at this year's event. Gwynne prefaced his announcement by noting that SIC was begun in 1836 with the publication of The Awful Disclos­ures of Maria Monk, for the purpose of bringing the common people into close contact with the nation's leading producers of per­verse, smutty and generally value­less literature. Former SIC's have featured such guests as Alfred E. Newman, "X," "Z," and the writing staff of The Doris Day Show. 
Peter Bunchley, the man who made enough money off of one shark to stock an ocean with them, will come to ND to discuss "The Meaningless Sex Sub-Plot, or How to Pad the Too-Short Novel." Gwynne cautioned students to be careful when buying Bunchley's book to make sure they don't get the condensed version by mistake. 
"Reader's Digest ruined the book," Gwynne complained. "By tasteful editing they managed to improve its quality 400 percent." Bunchley is rumored to be working on another novel, tentatively entit­led Claws. 
Later in the week, SIC will fc.ature Ted Agnew, a new-comer to the literary scene, although experienced in fiction-making. Agnew will discus his first novel, One Flew Out of the White House, the tale of a high government official forced to resign under pressure from pompous purveyors of preposterous poppycock. 
"We have great hopes for the poor quality of Ted's novel," Gwynne stated. "Our hope is based on our previous experience of his work.'' 
The third confirmed guest is poet Alfred, Lord Keats, a specialist in the limerick. "Alf" is best known for his works ''A Garbage-Collector from Portage" and "The Dog Who had Forty-Two Kittens.'' Keats wittily replied to the SIC invitation in verse: 
'75. "But I don't worry about the weather too much." he added. "South Bend isn't too coopera­tive." 
Byrned takes credit for dressing himself every morning, even though Gassperson sometimes comes over to help. "Those shoelaces can be tricky some­times.'' Byrned remarked. 
Byrned also claims he helps Fr. Hesburgher choose his wardrobe. "I kinda like black myself, and Hesburgher was in perfect agree­ment with me after I showed him letters from irate parents on his last appearance in canary yellow," he explained. 
Byrned takes no credit at all for the failure of the food co-op. "I though someone else was handling it. However, I was responsible for the Laugh-In earlier this year." 
Hawaii and Maine delegations totalled nine, too," Raynoll mut­tered. 
"As the chairman, I was sup­posed to break the tie," he yawned. "But I wanted Mandella the Fighting Chicken myself, so we decided to flip a coin instead of taking another vote and Wall ace 
won.'' 
Bremer, who was considered a "compromise" protest candidate, · took the VP nomination away from Dick Gregory and Julian Bond, the main contenders for the spot, on the second roll call Saturday after­noon. 
During the first ten ballots Friday night, the vote was a dead heat between California Governor Jerry Brown, Arizona Congress­man Morris Udall and Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter. On the eleventh ballot, the California del-
The Soph. Illit. Celebration Is a tribute to nauseous creations. I'll be glad to attend The SIC in South Bend. Thanks, guys, for the swell invita tion. 
Keats will be joined by fellow­poet Chugs Seagrams, whose 
SIC 
works have been widely-published on the walls of the New York subway system and various drunk tanks throughout the city's bor­roughs. Seagrams has also been anthologized by Masters and John­son in their soon-to-be-published book, Sexual Perversion and Its Expression in Modem American Society. Seagrams work appears anonymously under the title "Case 
D." 
The final confirmed speaker for the SIC is a former Math teacher and current author of "My Search for Pammy Herbst.'' Gwynne noted that the work may be considered by some as an exploita­tion of his former fiancee's sensa­tional kidnapping and trial, and said he plans to encourage this attitude. 
"He even offered to wear his bandages and Princeton warm-up suit for an extra $50," Gwynne said. "For another $50, he said he'd break down at the podium." 
Other guests will be announced as they confirm their invites, Gwynne said. In the meantime, the SIC committee is still in search of a place to hold the event. The most likely spot at the moment is "The Torch," a local night club and burlesque joint. 
Token SMC story 
By Mar Hoga Dancing Editor 
St. Mary's has always been innovative in the field of campus living. We all remember the renowned "St. Mary'sExperiment" 
which attempted to restrict men from entering the dorms. This experiment promoted another prac­tice: relay races up the walls. 
The latest in St. Mary's line of revolutionary changes this spring is a lottery system replacing Student Body elections. The lottery was introduced because the ballot could not accommodate all I. 700 names of the students wishing to be Student Body President. 
However, some students expres­sed concern that the lottery would produce a Student Body President who is not qualified for the position. 
Joan McFcrment incumbent Stu­dent Body President. reassured them that anyone can do the job. 
The lottery was held todav at lunch in the St. Mary's dining-hall because its atmosphere is condu­cive to picking things (as in out of your food). John M. Dugin was named the winner. 
Although many students com­plained that the lottery was fixed. Dugin claimed he knew nothing about it. "I thought it was a raftlc." he said. However, in his acceptance speech. Dugin prom­ised he owuld do his best saying he would be happy to take control of students' bodies next September. 
Even  Notre  Dame  seems  im­ 
nressed  with  the  result  of  the  
lottery.  It has been rumored that  

Fr. James T. Grinchaell plans to look into the possibilities of such a system at Notre Dame next year. 
egation's support for Brown disap­peared and the convention became a free-for-all. 
By the time police were called in to restore order, it was the four­
teenth  ballot  and  Mandella  the  
Fighting Chicken,  a  favorite  son  
candidate  from  Guam,  had  380  

votes, one under the total needed to take the nomination. 
On the fifteenth ballot, however, the Michigan delegation declared they would rather "elect a turkey than a chicken'' and threw their entire delegation behind Hubert Humphrey. This set off a landslide of votes for the senator from Minnesota, who had received two votes on the previous ballot. 
Somewhere around the nine­teenth roll call, it became clear that no candidate was going to achieve the required 381 total of votes and this rule was suspended by a unanimous voice vote. It was decided that the winning candidate need only poll a majority of the votes cast. Following the decision, approximately 600 delegates left the convention, with 25 die-hards remaining to slug it out among themselves. 
Two hours later, Wallace won. 
Some analysts were concerned with the possibility that animosity could develop between Wallace and Bremer, because the latter was rumored to dislike the Alabama governor. But supporters for Bremer, who is presently in jail, pointed out that he would poll many sympathy votes for the ticket from fanatics and lunatics, who comprise a large percentage of the voting population. 
They also contended that Wal­lace was in no danger of being assassinated by Bremer, or anyone else, because of the strong gun­control plank passed Thursday night by the convention. The plank calied for the installation of booby trap devices on all guns in the United States. When the trigger is pulled, the booby trap "blows the gun apart." 
Other platform proposals passed Thursday night included a pro-anti­pro-abortion plank, a women's rights bill (rumored to have been introduced by Mike Sheistner, platform chairman) calling for the repeal of the 19th Amendment and a busing plank advocating the busing of all white children to black schools and all black children to white schools. 
The busing plank passed by one vote and afterwards a number of bruised delegates charged mem­bers of the Black Alliance with the use of physical intimidation in obtaining passage of their propos­al. 
Several visitors to the convention Friday said they were shocked by the amount of beer-drinking and bottle-waving exhibited by the delegates. 
The observation was corrobor­ated by some forty drunken dele­gates who had to be removed from the convention floor Saturday afternoon. A number were heard to say it was the best Armory Party they had ever attended.

Thursday April1, 1976 
Hang 'Em High 
What this university needs is a good old-fashioned public.: hanging. 
Many people have c.:omplaincd that this has been a really "dead" year in whic.:h very little exciting has happened (and judging from the erap this rag has been running lately they arc not far wrong). What we all need is a little excitement to liven things up and get us through! the last long pull between the end of the major sports seasons and linals. Granted. we have An Tostal but after you have seen someone mangled on a football tield, mud volleyball just does not make it. 
A publie hanging would certainly give us excitement. In Merry Olde England everybody in town would gather to sec someone swing. The event was an occasion for family outings. It would thus be perfcl't for putting some of the old family spirit back into ND life. 
There arc many ways the excitement could be huilt up around this new spring Hanging Festival. 
Since the Hangman and Hangee would be instant University celebrities there would be intense c.:ompctiti~m to win these coveted positions--especi­ally that of Hangcc which would be a once in a lifetime opportunity. The obvious way to choose would Ol' to have an election which would itself be an occ.:asion of cxccitcment. The position of Hangman would of eoursc have to go to an administrator and there would no doubt be intense rivalry for this honor hctwcen the provost, the dean of students and the vi<.:l'·prcsiclcnt of student affairs. 
Any student or fac.:ulty member would be eligible to run for Hangcc (and should any promising c.:andidatc be too shy to step forward his supporters c.:ould run a write-in campaign). Candidates would fc~toon the campus with posters promising to chop harder and faster. or to kick higher and dangle longer than any of their opponents. 
The Absurder would cover the campaign and after cardul interviews, would endorse candidates for each oflic.:e. These candidates would inevitably lose and the Absurder's endorsement would become known as the "kiss of life". 
After a suitable build-up the Hanging Festival 
concerts 
would be held in the stadium some sunny spring afternoon (South Bend weather cooperating) a week or two after break. A gallows could be erected in the middle of the field and decorated with blue and gold. 
Students would side with either the Hangman or the Hangcc and display signs supporting their favorite (no allusions to rubbers, please). The band would parade around the gallows playing the victory march. 
To warm up the crowd before the main event the Leprechaun could burn one or two of the cheerleaders at the stake. Then the University Chaplain could deliver the invocation c.:ommending the lucky winner of the election to the hands of a l~nely god. Fr.Hesburgherwould be present to give h1s ''best-student-body-in-the-world'' speech and commend everyone for helping to fight world hunger (the body would of course be given to the Hunger Coalition for distribution in Bangladesh.) 
Finally. with suitable ceremony, the Hangman and Hangee would march up the gallows stairs arm-in-arm and would give their acceptance speeches to the cheering throng. The Hangman would carefully knot the silk rope aroung the Hangce's neck and step back. The Hangee would give a jaunty wave to the crowd, the trap door beneath his feet would be released, and he would begin to twist slowly, slowly in the wind. (Careful statistics would be kept on his girations and future Hangce would try to beat his record.) 
Perhaps after a couple of years the show would be broadc.:ast on national TV. Other schools would pick up the idea and it would become a customary spring festival in the nation's universities. Notre Dame would be the rcc.:ognized national leader in hangings. Hanging would become an NCAA sport. 
But most importantly the students, faculty and administrators would leave the stadium each year with the warm glow that arises from the excitement and family spirit of such a community festival. They would march back to their classes and offices revitalized and ready to fac.:c the last weeks before finals. 
A new Notre Dame tradition will have begun.

hug is just plain cheeky 
The fantastic new rec.:ording group Hug c.:amc to the ACC the other night with their orthodox and boring brand of music. They played to an equally bland audi­cnc.:c of 927 domcrs and I0,073 wild and uproarious townies. 
I started the night off regularly tnough by partaking in the smok­ing of some really far out Grade A Guatamaian banana. When ap­proached by an oflicer. the one and onl~· Okic Haggard of the Muskog­gcct Polil'c Force, I hid my banana quic.:kly under the impression of impending p rosccution and retri­bution, not to mention missing the fantastic Hug and losing my pink hippo to boot! However. Okic rcleivcd my fears be telling me he was c.:ool and he pulled out a 7-Up spoon, which we quickly made usc 

Hug came out onstagc to the thunderous applause of the townies and the snores of the domcrs. Unlike their sister group Kiss, which dresses up in outrageous ghouly outtits, Hug dresses practi­cally in the buff, with only a few lig leafs and some Alberta Balsam eye-liner outlining their lavishly displayed cheeks. Wow! It was outrageous! 
Lead Guitar player Easy Stringer started things off with some incre­dibly heavy riffs which soared with intensity and meaning. Even Okie was impressed. Lead singer Mick Mouth sang his hit "Bad Breath" and at the end of the song the band members threw out some 200 bottles of Scope. 
There is something about this group that makes one believe in them: maybe it is their opcness,

both physical and otherwise. They arc so honest and wantablc--maybe this is why bass player Bertha Bottom was carried off by loving groupies halfway through the con­cert. 
Drummer Max Xnare entertain­ed the crowd by throwing his drumsticks out into the crowd--un­fortunately, he also threw out a few sticks of lit dynamite that were going to be used for the light show. For the aesthetics, this was ac tually great for the hot items clcred out a large scxtion of the obnoxious townies. 
After playing for a generous twenty minutes, (long by most groups point of view) the group c.:amc back to an empty ACC for an encore performance of three hours. 
Okic. however, stayed and said the end of the song ''Mascara'' was truly a groovy scene; "All of a sudden this giant eye came down and it's mascara ran all over the group. A great end to a wild

Fr. Bi II Foohey===========================: 
Having a rap 
with the one 
and only 
lonely god. 
Let me get the name-dropping 
out C)f the way right now. I had 
lunch the other day with the Lonely 
God. He recently became a student 
at Notre Dame. 
"What's your major?" I asked 
him. 
"Loneliness," he told me. 
"What's yours?" 
"Relevance," I answered him. 
"With a minor in pseudo-journal­
ism." 
"1m lonely," he confessed to me. I tried to console him by offering him one of my favorite quotes--from Chapter Five, verse 13 of the Rolling Stone: "Life's a bitch." 
"Thanks," he said. "I needed that.'' 
I smiled. I knew what he meant. It had the same effect on me when I discovered it one morning while meditating upon a sunrise in Elkhart. 
Still, however, I found him distraught. 
"Why don't you write a letter to Father Griffin?" I asked him. "He's lonely too, you know." 
"I tried that," he pouted. "But he keeps writing me back letters about an old bitch without teeth who sells apples or something on 42nd street. Hell, he never answered me directly. And be­sides, that old woman's a Com­munist and a Buddhist. I pulled the file on her years ago.'' 
"But she's a human being," I pronounced. He looked surprised. "And I'll bet she's lonely too. We're all lonely." 
"Really?" He was shocked. "Well, everybody but football players and people who have read 
my book, How I Found God 
In a Bottle of HaJey's MO by Father 
Bill Foohey.'' 
''How much does it cost?'' 
"Only $14.95, but it's a bargain 
at any price," I answered him. 
"But what was I doing in a bottle 
of Haley's MO?" he asked. 
"No, not you," I corrected him. 
"The Happy God." 
"But if he's been hiding out in a bottle of Haley's MO. and I've been here at Notre Dame answer­ing letters from a quack dog-keep­er, who's been minding the world?" 
"No one, I guess," I said to him. "That must be the problem." 
"Of course!" he shouted. "After the death of the angry God, I expected the Happy God to take care of things. I was too grieved to function." 
"Of course," I sighed, leaning forward to grasp his hand. "I know how it is." 
He rose from his chair and moved toward the door. "I promise to be a good God," he told me. 
"I'm sure you will be," I told him. "I have confidence in you." 
"Thanks," he said. "Just one last thing. Could you see that my Absurder is hand-delivered to me in Heaven when I get there? I want to make sure I get there? I want to make sure I get the Dog-keeper's letter every week. 
The postal s.ervice was fine under the Gipper until he ran away with my secretary." 
"Of course," I said. "I'll put Joe Dill on that right away." ·

Avoiding flying chairs and shouts of "Yanqui Go Home" are treachorous enough when visiting the island of Cuba. but they can onlY be more of a pain when you alsn have to play the University of H;l\ ana in basketball. This is what the Irish of Filler Philps had to do "·hen they tlew to th is commie-pin­ko island to play the highly touted "Cigars" in an international good 11 ill game.

B.C. got done. the court looked like a tobacco road. 
Cantley was so impressive that he was offered a place on the Cuban Olympic Basketball team by Cigar Head Coach Fidel Castro. Castro supposedly offered him a tobacco plantation. two Russian built MIG's and Cuban heavy weight boxing champion Adello Stevenson as a personal body­guard. B.C. said he had to think it over and was 60-60 on the issue. 
Also impressive for the Irish was Robby "the Pumpkin" Salerno. Salerno had quite a few scores this game. including a few on the basketball court as he managed to keep every hair in place for a record shattering 52 straight games. "Goose" Smith ·and "Roulette" Mason also played well in the backcourt for the Irish. 
Another impressive performance was the one given by freshman

Director of Laziness .. Mouse" 
Krucc introduced the man he feels 
will be the deciding factor in ND's 
season this year, Chester Connecti­
cut. 
"Chct is really quite an excep­
tiona! player." Kruce said. "He 
docs almost everything well--block­
ing. tackling, passing. We're still 
experimenting to find the best 
position for him. He'll play both 
offense and defense. of course," he 
added. 
Some of those present expressed surprise that Connecticut had esca­pcd the eyes of other recruiters. Executive Vice-President Fr. Ned J uicc later admitted to the Absurder reporter. "We didn't ex­
actlv recruit Chet. He is the 
product of extended research at 
Lobund Laboratory." Juice would 
of Connecticut was "produced." Assitant Director of Sports Mis­information Bob Beast said he anticipates some difficulties with the NCAA, but felt they could be overcome. "For one thing, with Chet playing both offense and defense we can eliminate one more player from the travelling team," Beast pointed out. "Chet isn't in top playing condi­tion right now," Head Coach Dean Devilish confided. "He's been 'raised' in a germ-free enviroment, you know, so he's been going · through an extensive innoculation program. It works out very well, though." Devilish explained. "He gets his shots in a different arm everytime, so each practice he can use at least two." When asked for comment, Con­necticut replied, "I'd just like to thank my parents--Dr. Mallard, Dr. Hosanna, Dr. Mender and Dr. Thor." Connecticut's parents were un­able to attend the ceremony, reportedly because they were wor­king on their new child, a cheer-.

Senior Class President Rob Smelly announced yesterday that next year's Senior Class trip will be to the 40th Annual Hog and Poultry Exhibition in Kokomo, Indiana. 
Smellv said that the decision to change the trip from the Southern California Football game to the hog show was made on the basis on 
cost. Tickets for the trip will now cost only $3.67 per person. 
According to Smelly, class offi­cers felt that students would rather pay the lower ticket price, rather than spending several hundred dollars to have a good time. ·: B7side_s..who wants to go . to G'ahfornta JUSt to watch a bormg

Ten buses will be chartered to take the seniors to Kokomo. Each bus will carry 30 people and 15 kegs. Class secretary Ken Gator wanted to allot one keg per person but the other officers rejected that proposal. Gator, who. was inter­viewed while lying on top of a billiards table in Nickies, declined 
comment before passing out. 
Vice president Charlene Hands said the seniors will get to see such events as the Cow Chip Toss, hog calling, spitting for distance and poultry plucking. Other activities will include trips to the Dairy Queen and the all night gas station. 
Vidal Weed, Notre Dame's fabou­lous frosh. Weed turned in an agrcssive defensive game, fouling out in two minutes and being charged with six accounts of as­sault and battery. The John Birch society has picked up the tab on the assault and battery charges and has called Weed a great American for beating up "those commie pinko'*&#&!" 
Philps was egstatic about the win saying "Those Cubans were highly touted. but we hung tough like we always do and beat the stuffing out of them." Filler also commented "It's great to be representing America and they couldn't have picked a more representative school to do it. It's great to be associated with Notre Dame. The student body is the A# I greatest in America. I'm sure thev and the Gippcr were semi-responsible for our win today!" 
Wild women hit the sticks 
by E.O. Gravey The Irish EI 
Women's Sports broadened its horizon this year with the addition of field hockey to its list of track and field events. What, you may ask, is field hockey? 
Peculiar only to women, and no wonder, it is a game of intense concentration and mental strategy. More specifically this means you have two teams of nine screaming women, all with clubs in their hands, clamouring after a ball. 
Sound like a dangerous combina­tion? Astro Hotfoot, head honcho of the warriors, claims her women do it with style. 
"Field hockey is a game of real skill and execution. We may appear barbaric, but we can't help our­selves. Together we will make field hockey a dormity word at Notre Dame," said Astra. 
The women do add their touches to the game, though. They wear pleated wool skits to this gladiator­type get-together. 
A few of the grittier players ruin the effect. They refuse to shave their legs, preferring the Amazon­woman look. 
The game is played either on the women's favorite, grass;. or on Hotfoot's home territory, astra­
turf.  The  women  are  prevented  
from  playing high  (stic king,  that  
is(.  

Some of the all-stars include "Big Bad" Bradshaw, who even looks at the ball mean. "Butch" Maloney, along with "Bubba" Losurdo captained the team. They won the honors by clubbing the most opponents. "Hatchett-Woman" Hums played goalie. With a name like that, no one cam near the net. 
There's no denying the women are hard.. Before each contest, nails are served as toothpicks at training table. The main course is a blood meal. 
Those ladies don't give up until they see the whites of their opponents' eyes. In fact many fans claim they should institute a penal­ty box in the game so that some of the Notre Dame players could be put in -permanently. 
Much to the women's dismay, field hockey is only a fall sport. To compensate for this loss, the warriors are presently holding spring practice for next fall. Those women just can't get enough of that killer instinct. Their motto: "Have stick will kick...etc."

With room selection for next year underway at St. Mary's. many girls 

arc in frantic search for the ideal boudoir. However, we have found 
two girls who have found a room that fulfills their wildest expecta­tion. 
Their choice is a spacious, third­floor sanctuary, far from the crowd, in stately LeMans Hall. A crowd just sitting in awe in the center of the room, drew their attention las Sunday while room hunting. 
One of its various attributes is the large dining room table set off from the rest of the room by a small railing. Who could resist such a gem? 
If you climb a flight of stairs at the rear of the room you open onto a smaller music room, complete with an easy-to-play, follow-the­colors chord organ. The girls can picture friends gathering together to croon such favorites as "Red River Valley" and "Little Brown Jug". 
There is an adequate sleeping area on the lower level. It contains numerous single beds should guest decide to drop in for the weekend. There is even a room full of stylish lounging robes when you wish to entertain casually, but with a tlair. 
Candy dishes imd mini-sinks can be found at each exit. Bookcases, which are built into the walls, are now occupied by statues left by the previous residents, but can be removed easily and sold for a good price.

afternoon at 2:30 in the new Music 
Building (next to LaFortune) with a 
~vmposium of the judges. The 
~\'lllposium. to which everyone is 
invited and encouraged to attend, 
11 ill be an informal dialogue with 
the judges about many jazz-related 
topics. Topics may range from their 
per-,onal careers. to the festival. to 
the jau world in general. Because 
the judges come from different 
backgrounds and schools of jazz. 
the~· ma.1· discus~ their different 
approaches to music. At any rate, 
tht' symposium is loosely struc­
tured so that the judges and other 
people who attend can concentrate 
the discu"sion on the topics they 
lind interesting and important. In 
pre1·ious years. the symposium has 
been a valuable experience for 
those who have attended. This

Oakland University Big Band, the 
Northwestern Big Band. and the

played by these musicians should 
bring most of the audience back for 
more jazz on Saturday. Yet, the

other jazz enthusiasts will journey 
to Vegetable Buddies for more

Quintet. This session will take up 
where Friday night left off. Thi! 
session will begin at 12:30 and run 
til about 4:00. All five bands should 
give very enjoyable performances. 
There will be plenty of fine seats to 
match the fine music. so make a' 
point to attend this session. 
Saturday night, the festival will 
conclude in an impressive succes­
sion of musical talent. It begins at 
7:00 with the performance of the t\\ o high school bands that won the high school competition. At 8:00 the remaining college bands take the stage for the third and final college jazz session.

follow.

Eastman School of Music Jazz Ensemble will take the stage for an anticipated fine performance. The 
Collegiate Jazz Festival judges' chairman, Mike Dillon. has ar­ranged for Soloff to have several practice sessions with Eastman before the Festival. so they will be well prepared for their perfor-1 w1nce. Last year, Eastman receiv­

Imagine a family of 20,000 members in 80 countries around the world-that's a pretty big family, but that's what the Salesians are all about. They are a community of 
family minded individuals united for a common goal. 
The Salesians are made up of Priests, Brothers and Clerics -men studying for the priesthood but not yet ordained-who live and work together, equals in the Society, observing the same rules and enjoying the same privileges. St. John Bosco specifically wanted his Salesian communities to possess a warm, family like spirit where each member can grow and where both triumphs and setbacks are shared in the companionship of his fellow Salesians. 
The Salesian is highly trained for his mission, and he has the opportunity to go as far as he wants to; for the better his education, the better service he can give both to the Society and to the people he helps. He achieves his rewards in the realization of the good he accomplishes and the youthful hearts and minds lie inspires.

Who are The Salesians? 
The Salesians are a modern religious society of Priests and Brothers, founded in 1859 by St. John Bosco. His concern for youngsters who needed help and encouragement began early in his life, and he eventually established schools and youth centers which grew and multiplied. The Salesians -the Society of St. Francis of Sales, named after St. John's favorite saint-were organized and the new order quickly spread from continent to continent St. John Bosco died in 1888 and was canonized in 1934 as the Apostle of Youth. 
Today his Salesian sons-some 20,000 strong­continue his work in over 80 countries around the world. 
What do we do? 
Our principal apostolate is with youth. Our mission in life is working with and for young people ... in boy's clubs, academic and technical high schools, summer camps, retreat houses, guidance centers, orphanages ...wherever boys are to be found. 
Unlike other orders whose apostolate has changed with varying conditions the Salesians have always been -and always will be -youth oriented. We're trying to prepare youngsters today for the world that awaits them tomorrow. Not an easy task in these times, but one which we welcome. 
Salesian Priests and Brothers also staff parishes . . . work with the press, films, film strips ... and, on voluntary basis, serve in many lands as missionaries. 
OUR MISSION IN LIFE IS TO BRING AID AND GUIDANCE TO THE YOUNG ... THE NEEDY ... AND THE FORGOTTEN
