Hearst goes free Thursday 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Jimmy Caner, agreeing that newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst "needs no funher reha­bilitation" or punishment, acted yesterday to set her free this week. 
Caner granted executive clem­ency to Hearst, perhaps the nauon' s most celebrated federal prisoner, and commuted her seven-year sentence for bank robbery. 
An announcement of the presi­dent's action, taken on the reco~ndation of the Justice Department, said Hearst wiiJ be freed Thursday from the federal prison at Pleasanton, Calif. She has served 22 months of her sentence. 
The White House said Hearst, 
who will be 25 next month, "has 
been punished substantially" for 
her part in the holdup of a San 
Francisco bank two months after 
she was kidnapped by the Sym­
bionese Liberation Army in 1974. 
The announcement said she "needs no further rehabilitation, and it is the consensus of all involved in her proceedings and confinement that she is no risk to the community and that, on the contrary, she will be a law-a abiding citizen.'' 
To win her freedom, Hearst had to agree to a series of parole-like conditions that she must observe for a one-year period. Terry Adamson, a Justice Department spokesman, said a department official spoke to Miss Hearst earlier in the day 

Teen opens fire on school 
SAN DIEGO IAPl -A teenaged ~irl who saia she wanted to 
'liven up the day" sprayed a crowded elementary school with automatic rifle fire yester­day, killing the principal and a custodian and wounding a police officer and at least eight students before surrendering. 
The /irl, identified as 16­
year-ol  Brenda Spencer, bar­ 
ricaded  herself  inside  the  
family's  modest  home  across  

the street from Cleveland Elem­entary School for 6 1h hours before she quietly agreed to come out. 
A policeman on the scene, Sgt. Dave KeiJy, said Miss Spencer emerged from the house, put ~o guns on the ground, then calmly went back in the home and brought out her ammunition before heavilf. armed officers grabbed the gir . 
Miss Spencer was whisked to a nearby patrol car and driven to Rolice headquarters. 
'I just wanted to," the girl told the San Diego Evemng Tribune in a telephone inter­view. "It just popped into my head, about last Wednesday, I think." 
When the shooting began, students ran in/anic from the school yard an teachers told others to huddle beneath desks and keep away from windows. Later students were ushered to safety in the school auditorium. Nearby homes were evacuated.

The conditions include re­quirements that she not leave the country without permission of the attorney general, that she avoid anyone who has a criminal record, that she keep no firearms and that she subnut to possible unspecified additional super­vision by the attorney general.

In a meeting last night, the Campus Life Council voted unan­imously to appeal Provost Timothy O'Meara's rejection of its parietals proposal. The proposal would place parietals offenses under the jurisdiction of hall judicial boards. The next steJ? is to submit the proposal to Umversity President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh for final consideration. 
The proposal to reduce parietals to a hall offense was first rejected by Fr. .John VanWolvlear, vice-president for Student Affairs. Before the Christmas break, the proposal was appealed to O'Meara, who subsequently rejected it in a letter to Student Body President, Andy McKenna. 
McKenna showed the CLC copies of the letter, in which 0'Meara expressed his support for VanWolvlear's rejection of the pro,P<?sal. 
"I think it is in the best interest of the University that the impor­tance of parietals not be dimin­ished," O'Meara noted in the letter. 
CLC Representative Mary Ryan said that she wants Hesburgh to know parietals is a subject we are concerned about and have strong feelings about. 
"We want Hesburgh to cite his particular arguments which will make him decide to accept or reject our proposals and particu­larly to explain the rationale behind parietals,'' SU Associate Director Gene Woloshyn empha­sized. In his four years at Notre Dame, Woloshyn stated that he had never heard an explanation of exactly why parietals existed or when they started. 
St. Edward's Hall President 
Bill Vita said that he was "disap­
pointed with O'Meara's res­
ponse" and that he "hopes more 
dialogue will :·esuh from interac­
tion with Fr. Hesburgh." 
The CLC also heard a report by 
Student Body President Andy 
McKenna on the housing situa­
tion. McKenna said there have 
been "no drastic changes" since 
Christmas. He noted that a 
considerable number of students 
have already moved off-campus 
and that many more were plan­
ning to move off at the end of this 
semester. 
Assistant Vice-President for 
Students Affairs Fr. Gregory 
Green said that 2200 housing 
contracts, had been returned to 
the Housing Office as of yester · 
dar. 5500 spaces are available. 
AI housing contracts must be in 
by Friday. Green gave no 
estimate as to when the computer 
count of the housing contracts 
would be completed. 
VanWolvlear promised the 
CLC in a memorandtim that he 
would consult Student Govern­
ment about alternative solutions 
before the Administration 
reaches a decision about a lot­
tery. 
"Before March 9 (the proposed 
lottery date), we will have .a 
month to consider various alter­
natives to solve any housing 
problems," VanWolvlear stated 
m the memorandum. 
To help meet the needs of 
Off-Campus students, the CLC 
has accepted as ·3; spolking but 
non-voting member, Off-Campus 
CommissiOner John Fitzpatnck. 
McKenna supp<>rted a motion 
giving the Off-Campus CLC 
member the right to vote, but the 
motion must be approved at the 
Mav Board of Trustees meeting. [continued on page 7] 

HPC sponsors weekend ND -Toronto exchange 
by Patti 0 'Neill 
On Friday, four bus loads of Notre Dame students will leave for the University of Toronto for a four day visit. The Toronto Student Exchange Commission has co-sponsored this event with Notre Dame's Hall Presidents Council (HPC) with the objective of ''gaining new perspectives educationally, culturally and socially," according to Chuck DelGrande, chairman of the HPC. 
The exchange of 156 Notre Dame students will be a four day affair. They will leave Notre Dame at 4 p.m. Fnday, and return Monday niBht at 11. 
There will be an organizational meettng for all students attending the exchange at 6:30 p.m. Thursday in La Fortune's Little Theatre. An itinerary and all necessary information will be provided at this meeting. 
The University of Toronto has scheduled several events, including a reception dinner, social and athletic events, tours of Toronto and of the Ontario Parlaiment, and a luncheon with the Mayor of Toronto. Students will also attend classes and seminars, and they will enjoy free time to tour Toronto on their own. 
The Notre Dame students will stay with the same students from the University of Toronto who will visit Notre Dame on March 3-6. DelGrande is presently arranging an itinerary for the Toronto students' visit. This tentative schedule includes : a reception party at Guiseppi's, a tour of Chicago, athletic events, an evening at the Nazz, semmars and a dinner at which Fr. Hesburgh will be the guest speaker. 
When asked about his objectives for the exchange, one Notre Dame student, Glenn Killoren, stated, "I want to beat the February drabs by doing something different. And I'm going to have a good time. Even though the culture won't be much different from our own, I will be able to learn from them.'' 
Sara Yang, a junior at Notre Dame, shared her hopes for the exchange: "I am an American Studies Major and I was overseas last year. really want to meet people and learn more about our foreign relations." 
The trip promises to be an educational experience for both Notre Dame and University of Toronto students. DelGrande stated, "We had a maximum turnout and are very lucky that the University of Toronto chose Notre Dame to take part in the exchange.''

"I think these things will be forgotten in time and that she will live again as a useful citizen,'' Johnson said. 
Artist Wendy Yoshimura, who was captured with Miss Hearst in a San Francisco apartment in 1975, said she was "hap_py for Patty that her incarceration is over -as I would be for any woman in her situation.''

Pol Pot's forces drive to\Vard Phnon1 Penh 
BANGKOK, Thazland[APJ-The forces of fallen Premier Pol Pot claimed yesterday to be closing in on the Vietnamese and rebel­held Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh and listed other gains, some of which were confirmed by 'Indochina analysts here. 
''The country is settlin~ in for a long, hard fight," satd one diplomat in Bangkok. 
Sources within the Thai and Western diplomatic and mili­tary community, monitoring the six-week war from this Thai capital, said highway four lead­ing from Phnom Penh to the sea had been cut. 
Phnom Penh was seized Jan. 7 when Vietnamese troops and pre-Vietnam Cambodians found the city abondoned by Pol Pot and others who had fled to set up resistance in the country­stde. 
The sources also said the ports of Kompong Som and Kampot were still immobilized by heavy fighting and that the ancient temples of Angkor, symbols of Cambodian nationalism, may have been recaptured. 
In early January, the military map was a series of nest arrows representing Vietnamese thrusts from east to west. But over, the past two weeks the map has become a checkerboard of Viet­namese and Cambodian forces engaged in almost all areas of the country. 
The fighting is said to vary from minor skirmishes to sharp engagements, especially in key communication and resupply points held by the Vietnamese. ' 
Pol Pot's Voice of Democratic Kampucher (Cambodia), be­lieved broadcasting from China, said the Cambodians had "liber­ated" virtually all a southeastern Cambodia and penetrated within about 6 miles of Phnom Penh from the south. 
The broadcast described the siruation of the Vietnamese in­vasion force as "desperate." It also claimed the temples of Angkor had been retaken from the Vietnamese. 
The new pro-Vietnamese gov­ernment in Phnom Penh has not mentioned the battlefield action. 
But the Vietnam News Agency, quoting Phnom Penh media, satd more than 70,000 people in the provinces of Kompong Chhnang and Pursat have "taken part in building local revolutionary ad­ministrations and militia units.''

Guidelines needed 
The Observer withheld comment on the recent incident in which a Kee~ freshman was fo!ced to move off-campus because the dec1s1on was based on information which was not ~d _sh_ould not be made public. If the action had been a disciplinary one, and this information had been brought before the hall judicial board, the student may have been more severely penalized. Although the charge that the student "did not fit into halll_ife" was vague, The Observer feel_s _Kee~an rector ~ather Richard Conyers made the right dec_tslon m requestmg the "transfer of the student's residence." But we question the lack of guidelines which exist for cases of this son.

The Sound and the Fury 
''When neither their pro­perty nor their honor is t~uched, the majority of men live content." 

Niccolo Machiavelli. I like sex. The word, that is. I have an equal fascination for words like death, god, truth, love, freedom. These words send chills down the spine of human­ity, collectively and individually. The recent publication of the Brian Hogan article evoked tre­J:I?-O~s of indignation and denun­cJ.atl~n ~ong S?me knee-jerk reacnonar1es, but 1t also provided an. ample opportunity for some articulate and genuinely passion­ate rebuttals. We need to be challenged to know the depth of our own values, and convictions. Without the evil, the holocausts and the genocides which will forever blot the memory of man's inhumanity to man, what barometer would we have to measure the good, the lovely and the sacred? It was my decision to publish the article on sexual equality. As Fe~tures Editor, I encourage my wrtters to contribute their thoughts and feelings as articu­lately and passionately as possi­ble. Despite its inherent mcon­gruencies and chauvinistic bias­es, the article was published as one human being's semi-satiri­cal, semi-personal account of the sexual_ mor~s _of . Catholicity's pree~nent mst1tut1on of higher learnmg. Brian Hogan's respose touched a nerve within many of us. Alas, how dare he blaspheme the golden image we hold intact for ourselves, good Christians that we be. Very few peopJe, least of aU the expens, have achieved an acme of sexual libera~on-attitudinally, emotion­ally, mterpersonally and spirit­ually-which could serve as a model for the vast majority of human beings who wallow in sexual ignorance. Maybe true sexual liberation will never occur which means we must confron~ the darkness and fend for our­selves. Brian Hogan wrote 'controver­sial' statements like: -----''The average woman who enters ND is smarter than the average freshman male.!' Abso­lutely true. Traditional sexual discrimination in male institu­tions which have recently gone co~d-the most glaring examples bem~ ND ~d ~e military aca­derrues-reqmre 1mpeccable intel­

lectual credentials for incoming women. ND women have those credentials: Hooray for our side. -----"The vast majority of ND women are virgins." Shocking, but unverifiably true. I'd like to take a poU(anonymous, mind you) to validate this statement. My guess is 85% minimum, a number superceded only by the pe~centag~ of male virgins, which( despite . their innocuous verbal protestations to the con­trary) hovers around 90%. -----''Love without sex is definite­ly the most boring.'' This state­ment is so ludicrous and awash with ennui that I yawned outloud then proceeded to tell my mothe; (who has never studied Freud) that she is boring. -----"A freer sexual atmosphere here at ND will tum out to be the salvation of many coeds." Brian forgot two words, which I will sagaciously provide: "A freer sc:;xual atmosphere here at ND will tum out to be the salvation, anddestruction, of many coeds." Thank you, 0 great wise man. -----' ·~e most. important male­female mteracnons take place in the bedroom.'' Absolutely true. Color 1V appears sharper most homicides between es~anged lo":ers, and nearly every major philosophical treatise in history had its origins in that infernal cauldron of libido and love, the bedroom. Oh blessed sanctuary,

Not:n= Dame is like a huge breast, with counrless babes bellowing for an ever increasing quantity of milk. From the breast of suburbia, to the breast ND, followed by the breast of the corporation, we live shackled, enfeebled lives-void ofa# passion, incapable of tolera­ung another's vantage point especially if it somehow challen~ ges our own belief system. 
Some people felt the need to defend the collective "Honor" of Notre Dame. women; others felt ~e coiDJ>ulsion to immediately disassociate themselves from the co~ectiye wolfpack (masculine) which ts presumedly indicted a priori, by the author's ~ assuring_.trustiog virgins that ··i am not like that.''

Features Editor Pontificates : IV 
This upcoming weekend, Friday and Saturday, Feb. 2-3, CILA (Com­munity for the International Lay Apostolate) is sponsoring a workshop designed as a follow up to the Social Concerns Film Series. Its theme will be "Human Relationships and Orga­nizing for Social Change." 
The film series hopefully provoked some introspection about the prob­lems depicted in six films. Racism, corrupt unions, prison reform, greed, migrant workers' ri~hts and geno­cide, with its concomitant consequen­ces on the human spirit, should alert us to the institutional amorality intrinsic within vast sectors of our society. 
What the CILA workshop does is make available concrete alternatives and possible means for intitiating social change. The emphasis will be on two parttcular areas: compassion and service to others. 
By concentrating on helping rela­tionships, which then precipitate social change, the CILA workshop will hopefully: 
a) 
Provide a deefer understanding of the dynamics o helping relation­ships. 

B) 
Explore organizational dyna­mics, which are necessary for im­plementing social change at ND­SMC, the local South Bend area, or in cities throughout the nation. 


The workshop itself will feature 
Orris Stewart, Features F.d. 
two prominent, extremely dedicated and aniculate speakers: Father Jim Duane and Harry Fagen. Both are acommplished men in their fields. They will share their expenise and experience at the workshop, in hopes ofmcreasing the social consciousness of the ND-SMC populace. In addition, their workshops will em­phasize the need for responsible leadership, how it can be cultivated, and how It can be maintained to bring about the social equities needed if we are to call our society "just". The workshop will be held in Memorial Library Audttorium (first floor). 
FRIDAY. FEB. 2, 7-10 p.m.: 
HELPING RELATIONSHIPS 
Fr. Jim Duane is a pastoral theologtan who works with terminally ill patients at St. Joseph's Hospital in South Bend. He will deal with three specific dynamics within all helping relationshps. Anyone interested in psychology, ~eriatrics, sociology, nursing, med1cine, law, teaching and the religiouo; life would benefit im­mensely by attending, since these profess10ns all orient themselves to direct contact with persons in need.

1BHRAN,Iran [AP] -Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar rejected Ayarullah Ruhollah Khomeini' s latest demand that he resign and called off a peacemaking trip to Paris after 30 persons were reported killed and more than 300 were wounded in Tehran's worst violence in months. 
Bakhtiar told a news con­ference Khomeini's assertion that he must resign before the 78-year-old religious leader would receive him was unacceptable. But "doors will stay open," he said, indicating that contacts would continue between his repres'entatives and the ayarullah's. 
The prime minister said Sat­urday he would fly to Paris to try to make peace with the holy man who trom exile led the year-long civil rebellion that forced Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to leave the country two weeks ago. 
In Paris, 'one Khomeini aide said that ayarullah would receive Bakhtiar, while another said he would have to resign first. Later, Khomeini told reporters: ''if Bakhtiar is on the side of the angels, let him resign and come and see me as a free man, like everybody else." 
The 78-year-old priest, whose title of ayatullah is equivalent to that of bishop or archbishop, again attacked Bakhtiar as a "puppet and agent of the shah," and repeated his claim that Bakhtiar's government is "ille~al" because it was appomted by the ''illegal'' shah. 
The government has closed all Iran's airports indefmitely to block the return from exile on the spiritual leader of the nation's 32 million Shiite Moslems. 
Thousands of protesters, angered by Bakhtiar' s refusal to let Khomeini come home to convert the nation into an Islamic republic run by himself, flooded the streets of Tehran Sunday chanting ''Death to Bakhtiar!" 
One large _group, hurling gasoline-ftlled ft.rebombs, tried to storm a police headquarters. Troops rushed to the scene and opened fire with . 30-caliber machine guns mounted on the backs of trucks. .

Dame had won, could it have picked up some ground! But the Irish were one of those upset. None of the top five teams from around the league were able to muster a win. Last Friday night was just another typical one around the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. 
Michigan Tech walloped fu-st place Nonh Dakota, seventh place Denver beat second place Minnesota, Wisconsin tied up at third place Duluth, and last place Michigan surprised Notre Dame. Saturday night things were pretty" much reversed. UMD beat the Badgers and the three teams from among the top five that lost Friday were winners Saturday. It all makes the WCHA the WCHA. 
' 'This is the big difference in our league from the other collegiate leagues around the country," explains Irish coach Lefry Smith. "Any given team can beat anybody on any given night. Last Friday's results are just one night's won:h of proof of the balance around the league.'' 
Sure, by losing to Michigan Friday, Notre Dame missed an opportunity to close within three points offu-st place. But trying to come up with an explanation for the loss or bringing up all the ''What ifs ... '' that arise when you lose to a team you are supfosed to beat is like just coming out of a fina exam you're sure you've failed and comparing anwers with your fu-ends. It doesn't do you any good then, but you do it anyway. So here goes: 
"Talking about the game now and trying to come up with a reason for losing is just total conjecture on anybody' s part,'' said Smith. ''There are so many factors involved. You can shoot the daylights out of the opposition and still not be able to score. That is what happened when we played Michigan Tech two weeks ago the fu-st mght. It was almost a crime to lose after the way we played, but that is just hockey. The ~oaltender can serve as the equalizer m that mstance -Davt Laurion has done it for us this year. 
· "And you can goon and on. Saturday night, when we scored 10 goals against Michigan, it seems we got too offensive-minded, and then they score four in the last period. Again, you can never be sure of the exact reason, it's only guesswork. You can never dwell on something like this, you have to look ahead to the next game." 
For the Irish, that next game is tomorrow night at 7:30 at the ACC when the No. one team in the country, Bowling Green, meets Notre Dame for the 16th time. The Falcons, currently leaders of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association with a 14-1 record (25-4-1 overall), will supply a very severe test for the key pan of the Irish game ·-the forecheck. 
"We have very good overall speed," notes Smith, "and when we use it well on the forecheck we are at our best. Bowling Green is

a very physical team that has a very sound defense. They are an excellent backchecking team that plays the body well and also get good goaltending from Wally Charko and Bill Stankiewicz. Their defense and our forecheck­ing will make for a good matchup." 
Another key for the Irish will be to stop the Falcons' top line of seniors Mark Wells and John Markell and freshman George McPhee. That will put the Irish defense to the test, a defense that gave up seven goals Saturday. 
''We moved the puck much better on defense 
Saturday that we did Friday, but we still gave up 
some fluke goals," said Smith. "We're still not 
being aggressive enough in the defensive zone 
and are going after the puck too much instead of 
the body.'' 

''It was definitely pleasing to see us score the way we did," offered Smith. "We got some excellent hits with the forecheck and made full use of all five skaters on offense. It's the fu-st time we were able to do that since beating Wisconsin 8-2 in December." 
Tomorrow's game will also feature the rivalry between the two respective leagues, the WCHA and the CCHA. Come playoff time in March, it's a race to make it to the NCAA playoffs and then to the final four. The west receives two bids to the final four; the top team from the WCHA is guaranteed a benh while the second team from the WCHA goes into a playoff with the leader from the CCHA for the west's second bid. Bowling Green won that second bid last year, so the rivalry present is obvious. 
Dave Launon will be rested Wednesday for the Colorado series this weekend, leaving number two man Greg Rosenthal and third goalie Mark Schores as the two candidates for the spot. Rosenthal missed the Michigan series because of the flu, and a lot will depend on how he feels Wednesday. "We may split or go with just one of them, it's up in the air right now," says Smith. 
It will be the best from the CCHA against the fourth top team from the WCHA tomorrow ni_ght. Don't try and guess the outcome -like wtth finals, unless you have the questions in front of you, you don t know how you' II do on the test. 
BLUE UNES: Irish fr~shman phenom Dave Poulin is Notre Dame's hottest skater right now ... he has gotten at least one point in his last 12 WCHA games and the same for his last nine overall contests ... tomorrow's game will be bro~dc~st around campus on WSND (am 640) begtnnmg at 7:30.
