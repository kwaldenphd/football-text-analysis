Another chapter in Saint Mary's history nears closure. as President William Hickey an­nounced his resignation as pres­ident of the College, effective with the appointment of a suc­cessor. !lis resignation marks the end of a 35-year career in higher education exclusive to Saint Mary's College. 
In what he called "a very spe­cial moment," Hickey made a formal press announcement of his resignation Saturday after­noon. That morning, he sub­mitted his letter of resignation to the Board of Trustees, with copies sent to every member of the student body. 
"The time is now right for me and for Saint Mary's College to enjoy the opportunity to explore the options that change offers," said Hickey. "Therefore, I am announcing my resignation as president of Saint Mary's Col­lege effective at the end of this academic year or with the ap­pointment of my successor." 
Hickey said of leaving Saint Mary's, "I will miss the col­leagueship most, not only with the Trustees, but with all of the constituents of the College, es­pecially the staff and the stu­dents." 
When assuming the presi­dency in 1986, Hickey viewed the sesquicentennial as the ideal time to turn the College over to a new administration. "That seemed to be the perfect moment of transition in leader­ship which would allow a new president to set the agenda for and launch the next 150 years," he said. 
However, the $30 million sesquicentennial fundraising campaign, coupled with this year's North Central reaccredi­tation review, set back those plans, llickey said. 
Last June, llickey informed the officers of the Board of Trustees of his intentions to re­sign, so plans could be devel­oped for the search for a suc­cessor. This weekend's an­nouncement, however. came as a surprise to the remaining members of the board, along with the students, faculty and

Court of Appeals rules against Rita 
By DAVE TYLER 
Senior Staff Writer 
An Indiana Court of Appeals ruling issued on Thursday paves the way for Notre Dame Law school graduate John Hila to be retried on a charge of leav­ing the scene of the accident that killed freshman Mara Fox in 1993. 
The second trial could begin as early as Sept. 1, 1996, but a trial date later in the fall is more likely because Hila and his attorney, Charles Asher, still have several appeal options before them. 
In its decision. which came almost one year after the appeal motion was filed, the Court upheld steps taken as St. Joseph's County Prosecutor Michael Barnes made motions to retry Hila on the felony charge remaining from the first trial. Hila was tried and acquitted in 1994 of a charge of caus­ing a death while driving drunk. 
A jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge of failure to stop at the scene of a personal injury accident, and Superior Court Judge William Albright declared a mistrial on that count. 
Hita, who graduated from Notre Dame Law School in 1994, was charged in connection with the November 13, 1993 crash that killed 18-year-old Lyons Hall freshman Mara Fox. The accident occurred on Douglas !load just east of State Route 23, where Fox and several friends were walk­ing back to campus from Grape Road after a taxi they called for never showed. 

Hita, of Springfield Va., and a group of friends were dri­ving towards cam­pus on a rainy night when their ear struck Fox. Hita denied knowing that he had hit a 
person or that any­one was injured. After the mistrial, Barnes decided to move forward with a second prosecution, but the trial was delayed while Asher appealed several rulings. Albright postponed Rita's trial in May of last year to allow Asher to pursue the appeal. 

''I'm pleased, of course," Barnes told The South Bend Tribune Thursday after hearing of the ruling. "It affirms what we have maintained throughout

Despite the massive renovations and additions to Notre Dame Stadium, the student sections will remain where they have traditionally been. Contrary to rumors, University officials assert that there will be no relocation of student seating at home football games. 
Furthermore, officials are nearing the final stages of selecting a way to distrib­ute the additional 21.000 tickets that will be available for the 1997 season and beyond. · "We're still working on the final plan, but it looks like the bulk [of the new seat­ing] will go to contributing alumni," Director of Ticketing and Marketing Bill Scholl said. 
''Whatever we come up with will require a drastically different distribution program, but we don't have any absolute final plans," he stressed. 
The process is complicated, Scholl noted, because of the large number of University departments that have to be involved in the decision making process. He cited the Athletic Department, the Development Office, the Alumni Office, and the University's administration as key concerned parties. 
It has been nearly ten years since the University recognized its inability to satis­fy growing ticket demand. Currently, tick­et seekers' chances of being awarded seats via the lottery are less than one in six. Officials would like to lower that fig­ure. 
"If we could tell people 'You're going to win 50 percent of the time, so eome back and enjoy the ambiance,' we'd be pretty

strates, I always
thought emergency Sainr Mary's Day Editor rooms guaranteed fast treatment for whatever ailments one en­counters. After this past weekend, I'm giving serious thought to ever going back. Saturday morning, I went to the emergency room and assured myself and my two accom­panying friends we would be on our way home by noon. Our visit, though, turned out to be a five bonding session with one-and-a­half hour periodic drop-ins by doctors trying to diagnose me. I thought at times my friends were going to leave me there, yet that was not the case. It was a bonding session of sharing past hospital experiences and an emergency room tour of all the instruments, courtesy of my nursing major friend. I discovered a new side of emergency rooms to replace my past impres­sions of cold, morbid and silent rooms. We filled the room with life. Towards the end of the five hours, the ser­vice of the doctors and nurses extended was much more immediate. I think our laughing annoyed them. They kept peeking in every ten minutes to ask if everything was okay. In a way, I'm thankful for our emergency room experience. Not only because I found out I have mono and an excuse to rest, but because of the time I spent with my friends confined in a 10x12 room. I didn't even have to ask them to take me to the hospital: it was a natural reflex. Those are the true signs of friendship. They wanted to be by my side and I know that I would do the same for them if they were in a similar sit­uation. Now that our friendship has passed a five hour hospital test, a different kind of friend­ship must enter the scene. It's a weira feeling having six of your closest friends play differ­ent degrees of your mother by telling you what to eat, when to sleep, tucking you in, making you wash your hands, and running to Dairy Queen for Oreo Blizzards. On initial diagnosis, I wanted to go home. To escape the world of end-of semester tests, paper pressures and neighbors turning off their lights and radios at one or two in the morning. But I think the best way to heal is having six different individual friends playing the role of your mother. Friends understand more than our own mother's do about being sick and having to keep up with school work. Hopefully, I'll kick this nagging virus in the next three weeks, so when I go home my mother won't make me lie bedridden for half of the summer vacation. Staying here, I know my friends will keep a close eye on me, sometimes too close, but they will allow me to get up and amuse them peri­odically throughout the day. As the school year once again comes to a close, and we find ourselves going our own separate ways, our thoughts of one another won't end with good-byes. Although it may be hard to keep in close contact over the summer every time I drive by a Dairy Queen or hospi­tal emergency room, I won't be able to help but laugh and think about what my mothers are doing at that particular moment.

Torrential downpour hits northeastern Brazil, 26 dead 

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil 
Torrential rains brought a mudslide down on a shanty­town in northeastern Brazil on Sunday, killing at least 26 people . 
Another 15 people were injured in the mudslide, which covered a slum at the foot of a hill on the outskirts of Salvador, a coastal city 1,000 miles northeast of Rio, said Maria Emilia Freire, a spokeswoman for the Salvador civil defense. 
The rain started coming down on Saturday afternoon, gained strength in the evening and turned into a down­pour, which stopped Sunday morning. 
With forecasts calling for more heavy rain, the city's civil defense workers worked to evacuate residents from hillsides and other high-risk areas. 
Children overshadow Queen's 70th 
LONDON 
Queen Elizabeth II tried to keep her 70th birthday a "low-key affair on Sunday but she couldn't keep her chil­dren's marital woes out of the spot­light. The royals were the hottest topic in Britain's Sunday papers with about 15 stories on everything from their finances to claims the queen pushed her oldest son to marry Princess Diana 


in hopes it would end his affair with a married woman.There were no royal processions, no state ban­quets, not even a fanfare to mark the day. But more than 1,000 people singing "Happy Birthday Your Majesty" brought a smile to the queen's face when she emerged from church at her Sandringham estate in eastern England with her daughter Princess Anne in her only public appearance. Well-wishers showered her with flow­ers, cards and even cakes. Back in London, she wasn't totally forgotten either. One of the 27,000 runners in the London Marathon wore a rubber mask of a smiling queen and a pink sign saying "70 Today." There was even some front-page news to cheer the queen. Even though a recent opinion poll showed a sharp decline in public sup­port for the monarchy, a Gallup survey in The Sunday Telegraph found that 54 percent of young Britons want her to have a more prominent role in government. 

Company fined for employing illegals 
INDIANAPOLIS 
Three companies that manufacture auto racing equip­ment have been fined a total of $39,600 and placed on five years probation for concealing illegal aliens from fed­eral authorities. Amsler Helmets and Simpson Helmets Inc. pleaded guilty Friday to felony charges of conspiring to hide their employment of illegal aliens from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Simpson Sports Manufacturing Inc. pleaded guilty to using falsified docu­ments -the immigrants' paperwork -to comply with federal regulations. Amsler Helmets does business in Indianapolis as D.J. Manufacturing. All three companies are owned by Bill Simpson, who did not appear in court. Under aplea agreement, the companies each paid a fine of $13,000 and $200 in court fees on Friday. U.S. District Judge John Tinder tacked on the probation after telling company representatives in court that he considered the crimes to be serious. "This conduct here was not just a tripping over of violations," he said.After the INS notified 
D.J. Manufacturing that it was employing illegal aliens. the company said the employees were terminated. But evidence showed they continued to work there but under the Simpson Helmet name. 

Festival celebrates uses of hemp 
PENDLETON, Ind. 

Marijuana may be an illegal drug, but Michelle Zajac wants people to know there are plenty of things to do with the hemp plant besides smoke it. Near a stand sell­ing vegetable-and-hemp-seed burgers, not far from the stage bearing the "Hemp for Victory" banner, Zajac spent the weekend touting the benefits of hemp-seed lini­ment. "It's good stuff," said Zajac, one of many vendors at Indiana Freedom Camp, a festival promoting the plant's many uses. Backers of the festival, held Saturday and Sunday at Pine Lakes on Indiana 38, say hemp gets a bad rap because it is seen as only a drug. The stand run by Chicago residents Zajac, Lisa Prell and Heather Schlesinger featured bracelets woven from hemp, as well as salve and soap containing hemp-seed oil. "For a long time, I just smoked pot," Zajac said. But that was before she wrote a college paper on hemp's other uses. "Once you educate yourself on it, you know there's nothing wrong with the plant. It's just a plant. It has a lot of bene­fits," she said. Hundreds of cars and more than 1,000 people-were at the campground by Saturday afternoon, said Paul Guthrie, one of the organizers. Many arrived Friday. The $15 admission fee included camping privi­leges, though it was hardly a privilege Friday night when the area was battered by a storm. "It was quite an expe­rience," Guthrie said. The storm blew over a big tent and a trailer, and temporarily knocked out electricity, he said.

would pose no threat to tigers. who could easily cross 
rivers and channels to reach safety, said Zakir Hossain, a 
professor at Dhaka University. Ilasna Moudud, the presi­
dent of non-government Coastal Area Resources

of the fire was not immediately clear.

By LORI ALLEN 
Saint Mary's News Editor 

In a surprising turn of events, Saint Mary's College President William Hickey announced his resignation, effective with the appointment of a new presi­dent, on Saturday morning in the spring Board of Trustees meeting. 
Student reactions varied from surprise to acceptance as the news hit campus late Saturday afternoon. Saint Mary's stu­dent body president Sarah Sul­livan seemed confident in Pres­ident Hickey's decision. 
"We are very thankful to President Hickey for all of his years of service to Saint Mary's College. We felt that it was in good nature that all of the stu­dents received a copy of his let­ter of resignation." 
Hickey made his announce­ment at Saturday's Board of Trustees meeting and sent let­ters to the student body later that afternoon. Hickey wrote in his letter, "It was important to me that you learn of my

Board plans search for successor 
By MAUREEN HURLEY 
Saint Mary's News Editor 

The only information known about Saint Mary's College President William Hickey's successor is that he or she will "have to fill some very big shoes," according to Sister Hache! Callahan, chair of the Board of Trustees. 
I lickey announced his resig­nation Saturday, effective with the appointment of a new pres­ident. 
While the College community was informed of the decision this weekend, Hickey told the officers of the Board of Trustees of his plans to resign at the June 1995 retreat. A timeline has been prepared for the search for the 1Oth presi­dent of the College. 
"We have set in place a timetable and we will be meet­ing again as a Board of Trustees in June for our annu­al board retreat. The major focus of that particular meet­ing will be to put the search process into action," Callahan said. 
According to Callahan, a committee representing the different constituents of the College will be formed, along with a leadership statement including the criteria for the next president. 
The search process will start immediately after the June board retreat, with major ad­vertising beginning in August. 
The board hopes to have the next president of Saint Mary's College appointed by the spring semester of 1997, so that the successor can work closely with Hickey before assuming the presidency, beginning in the 1997-98 acad­emic year, if all goes according to schedule.

"We have an extraordinary hard act to follow," Callahan said. "Since Saint Mary's is an institution that has a life of its own, we are very confident that we can do that." 
It is not yet known whether or not the presidential ap­pointment will come from within the current ranks of the administration. Callahan maintains that there will be a nation-wide search "to find the best possible person." 
"When we get into the actual search process, we will be casting a very wide net," Callahan said. 
Students will be an integral part in choosing the next presi­dent, according to board mem­bers. "In choosing the new president, students will have a definite voice," said Student Trustee Julie Steinke. 
With regards to the presi­dency, Hickey said, "The role of president provides many wonderful opportunities and challenges-some enormously satisfying, some draining, and many both," he said. "The pressure is never ending and comes from every direction."

the proceedings." 

"This puts us back with the Class D felony absent some other move by the defense," he added. "I would expect the trial to be scheduled after Sept. 1." 
Rita still has several "other moves," he could make before a second trial. He could ask for a rehearing by the Indiana Court of Appeals or petition the Indiana Supreme Court to re­view the case. Both requests could be denied, but even the filing of such motions could push the trial date back two months. 
Rita's appeal addressed three issues from the trial, two of which involved rulings by Judge Albright: 
• 
Whether the prosecution's alleged failure to properly pre­serve the car's windshield de­nied Rita due process. 

• 
Whether the trial court erred in permitting the state to amend the charge. 

• 
Whether the trial court erred in allowing the state and not the defense to issue inves­tigative subpoenas to take statements from witnesses. 


The appeals court found that there was nothing that showed that the prosecution did any­thing with intentional bad faith when it removed Rita's wind­shield from his car three days after the accident. 
Asher had attempted to have the cracked windshield ruled inadmissible as evidence, claiming it had been changed and damaged through the re­moval from the car and during storage. 
The three judge panel also declared that Albright had acted correctly in allowing Barnes to make minor amend­ments to the charge. The court said the changes did not signifi­cantly change the contention of the case. 
The court also found that there was no law prohibiting a judge from allowing the prose­cution to issue investigative sub­poenas to get statements from uncooperative witnesses out of the presence of the defense. The measure is often used before charges are filed, said the court, but it is not illegal after a charge has been filed. 
Asher could not be reached for comment. Rita is believed to be residing in the East.

in the past and exceptional promise for future accom­plishment," according to a re­lease by the Guggenheim Foundation. 
Fellowships are given to social scientists, poets, novel­ists, painters, photographers, choreographers, physical and biological scientists, film mak­ers and scholars in the humanities. 
More than 73 American col­leges and universities have one or more representatives on the fellowship list over the last 72 years. The foundation annually chooses 158 recipi­ents out of 2,791 applicants for awards totaling $4.5 mil­lion. It has awarded nearly $170 million dollars over the last 72 years. 
The Guggenheim Foundation relies on an immense network of advisory panels across the country to make recommenda­tions to its Committee of Selec­tion. 
This year's Committee of Selection consisted of scholars and professors from universi­ties ranging from Princeton to Florida State. 
Jordan will spend the next year condensing his research into a book that he plans on writing while taking a sabbati­cal in Atlanta, Dallas or Santa Fe, N.M. 
The fellowship will go toward paying his salary for the year he will be gone, and the remainder will subsidize the purchase of medieval man­uscripts. 
"The Guggenheim is a fairly prestigious honor," Jordan said. "It is only given to those that have achieved a certain amount of seniority. It shows that your colleagues hold you in a very high regard. Obviously, I am very honored." 
Jordan has been teaching in the Medieval Institute at Notre Dame since 1985. He is cur­rently also working on books about the history of homosex­uality in the Catholic Church and the clergy. 
He attended St. John's College in Annapolis and received his Ph.D. from the University of Texas in Austin.

happy," commented Chuck Lennon, the director of the Notre Dame Alumni Association. 
"We're pretty pleased with the way things are going. It would seem that some groups could have better luck than they're getting now," he added. 
Lennon's department rec­ommended that the University consider five groupings of peo­ple when it rearranged the lot­tery. 
First, the department consid­ered Notre Dame's 220 na­tionwide alumni clubs. Classes would also receive consideration "if, for example, the Notre Dame Class of 1961 wanted to stage a mini-reunion," Lennon explained. 
Support staff, like groundskeepers, food service workers, and secretaries who currently do not receive tickets were also asked to receive con­sideration. 
"It's a shame that someone can work at the University full­time and not receive tickets," Scholl commented. 
Lennon's recommendation also included parents of current students. 
"In recent four years, they've been able to see three Navy games and a Rutgers game over parents' weekend. We'd like to be able to say to them, 'While your son or daughter is here, you can try to get some decent tickets here,"' Lennon said. 
Finally, despite the perception that they receive substantial numbers of tickets, Lennon rec­ommended to consider non­alumni benefactors in the re­vamped lottery. 
"Faculty/staff. benefactors, and parents are the groups we want to help. But, if you give tickets to one, you're taking away from another, so it's a bal­ancing act," Scholl explained. 
There is one issue the Uni­versity has conclusively decided upon. 
"Assure the students that they're not moving," Scholl said. 
The Athletic Department admitted that a small number of season ticket holders would be displaced to make room near the end zone for students dis­placed by the elimination of seating beneath the current press box. 
"I think everybody will be happy," Lennon concluded.

The club recently attended a district eonvention of the twelve Indiana schools that have Circle K groups on campus in Nashville, Indiana. Thirteen nHHnbf~rs from the Notre Dame chapter met with students from other schools to discuss topics involving money raising strate­gins and serviee ideas. 
Tlwy also did a service pro­ject whilfl at the convflntion, eh~aning the yard and building a mailbox and ramp to the front porch of the home of an elderly woman in need of such ser­viens. 
"It was a great feeling to work on lwr house bncause you could tdl how appreeiativn she was," said Mary Finley, member. 
In addition, the club won numerous awards at the con­vention. The most outstanding achievement award was pre­sented to the organization in recognition of their accom­plishments over the past year. Brian Cullen, the president of Circle K and one of the original members responsible for the club's growth, received the most distinguished president award. 
Petrino won the most distin­guished vice-president award. Awards were also won for sending the most members of any group to the conference, spirit, and aeknowledging their partieipation in the Latchkey program. 

"We won a lot of awards for only being in our second year as a group," said Petrino. 
Unlike other service organiza­tions, which usually focus on one cause, Circle K focuses on a multitude of different commu­nity concerns. 
While the leaders of the group are the source of many of the project ideas, members often present their own ideas to the rest of the group. This, according to Cullen, is one of the reasons the group has experienced such growth. 
"We try to cater to the mem­bers' needs. Whatever project they think is important to do we look at," said Cullen. "It's like a smorgasbord; we do different things all the time." 
The club is involved in such programs as the latchkey pro­gram, St. Augustine's soup kitchen, the Center for the Homeless. and the Chiara House. A lot of their activities involve spending time with chil­dren. 
"Those kids can get pretty wild, but they're fun," said Fin­ley. 
"We're second biggest right now, so we could become the largest Circle K club in the world," said Cullen. "We feel we can offer something for everybody."

fairs, vice president and dean of faculty, and acting president twice, before assuming the role as the ninth president of Saint Mary's College. 
With regards to his appoint­ment as president, Hickey said, "There is a rare person who knew more about Catholic women's education than me, based primarily on the experi­ence level I had." 
Carrying the College through what is known as one of the most challenging times in higher education, Sister Rachel Callahan, chair of the Board of Trustees, said, "Dr. Hickey is

decision in advance of reading or hearing about it." 
Dr. Linda Timm, Vice-Presi­dent for Student Affairs, was also surprised by President Hickey's decision. "I was obvi­ously as surprised as everyone else was, but I have great re­spect for President Hickey and I understand how difficult his decision must have been." 
Sullivan also stressed Presi­dent Hickey's qualifications as a leader and mentioned that she does not know who is being considered as his successor. 
While Sullivan expressed confidence, other students re­acted with shock. 
"When I first learned of President Hickey's resignation l was completely surprised, but if he feels that this is the best decision for Saint Mary's then J support him. He is a very per­sonable and friendly man, and l wish him the best of luck in all that he does," said Saint Mary's sophomore Michelle Abraham. 
Sophomore Lori Riebe felt the same way as Abraham. "l 
"It is no accident that Saint Mary's is the number one Catholic women's college, and a good part of why that is so is because of the kind of icon this president has been for the col­lege," she continued. 
Administrators stress Hickey's commitment to the College. "It is noteworthy that he still main­tains an interest in the College and the students," said Linda Timm, vice president for student affairs. 
Hickey will remain the College president for the 1996-97 a cad­ernie year, until the tenth presi­dent is inaugurated. "My imme­diate future is still wrapped up in Saint Mary's. We have an 
will be very sorry to see him leave. President Hickey was a great president and a wonder­ful person. I only hope that his successor will continue to carry on the Saint Mary's tra­dition as well as he has." 
Seniors expressed their sen­timents as they came to realize that their last year could possi­bly be President Hickey's as well. Leanne Jones, senior class president, was among the many. "We will be very sorry to see him go and will definite­ly miss him. However, we respect his decision and sup­port him in all of his future endeavors." 
As more students became aware of the resignation, the issue of a successor inevitably came up. Many students ex­pressed hope that a woman would assume the role as pres­ident. "I believe that the most qualified person should suc­ceed President Hickey, but a woman president would defi­nitely be fitting for a women's college," said Saint Mary's sophomore Anne Werring. 
"I think that it would be a good idea to find a woman who is a dynamic individual who could take the college into the next century," said Chair/

After Saint Mary's, Hickey is considering continuing "founda­tion work" in higher education. 
Hickey emphasized this "foundation work" in his 10 years as president of Saint Mary's, establishing the Center for Academic Innovation and the creation of the Presidential Merit Scholarship program, holding true to his inaugural promise to focus on faculty de­velopment and student scholar­ship. 
However, probably the most notable achievement of his administration was in 1994, as he "entered into a new rela­tionship with the Sisters of the Holy Cross and achieved auton-
Associate Professor of English Dr. Ted Billy. 
Professors and administra­tors were as surprised as the students themselves. Accord­ing to Nancy Nekvasil, Associ­ate Professor of Biology, she was very shocked by the deci­sion. "I heard it on the news and thought that it must be a mistake. l feel that this will be a very critical time period until a successor is placed. The suc­cessor must be someone who is incredibly aware of a women's education." 
"I had no idea that this was coming, and I feel that it will be a great loss to the college. I have only been here for two years, but he has always been very supportive of all I've done. It was an honor to' work with him," said Suzie Orr, Director of Residence Life. 
President Hickey, along with the Saint Mary's community, is sentimental about his depar­ture. 
"This is an incredible place, the people who make up this institution are quality, first­rate people who care about the role they play in the college," said Hickey. "The pride in Saint Mary's makes it a tough place to leave." 
tion," said Callahan. 

By achieving this autonomy, Saint Mary's went under corpo­rate reorganization, placing all decision-making in a single Board of Trustees. 
""I think, in the history of this institution, one of the significant changes that occurred is the corporate reorganization of Saint Mary's," Hickey said. "Saint Mary's is now owned by Saint Mary's." 
Reflecting on his term as the ninth president of Saint Mary's of in 1986 is a stronger, more stable, and more intellectually exciting institution in 1996." 
On behalf of the Board of Trustees, Callahan said, "It is with both sadness and gratitude that we accept Dr. Hickey's res­ignation. Sadness, at the loss for the college; gratitude for the many contributions he has made to this institution." 
"In the history of Saint Mary's College, the chapter on Dr. Hickey will be a long one," she continued.

• RIGHT OR WRONG? 
Homosexual marriage ban may violate state constitution 
T
The prevailing culture "presents recourse to contraception, sterilization, abortion and even euthanasia as a mark of progress and a victory of freedom, while depicting as enemies of freedom and progress those positions which are unreservedly pro-life." Evangelium Vitae, No. 17. When Pope Paul VI, in. Humanae Vitae, in 1968, reiterated the constant teaching of the Church that contraception is always objectively wrong, that teaching was denounced by adherents of The Church of Where It's At, on this campus and elsewhere. "In defending conjugal morality in its inte­gral wholeness," said Pope Paul, "the Church knows that she contributes toward the establishment of a truly human civilization." Few in their right minds are laughing at Paul VI now. Our experience with abortion, and now euthanasia, verifies that a "truly human civilization" cannot endure if man, through the contraceptive ethic, makes himself the arbiter not only of the rela­tion of sex to procreation but also, implicitly, of the ending as well as the beginning of life. oday, whenever Pope John Paul II affirms the teaching of the Church on sex and marriage, the media can usually count on some Notre Dame pro­fessor, perhaps wearing an unfamiliar collar, to tell us why we should ignore the Pope. This is a dead end and it is getting old. Instead, maybe Notre Dame ought to confer next year a symbolic honorary degree posthumously on Pope Paul VI in recognition of his prophetic affirmation of truth and life in Humanae Vitae. This would be pure symbolism, a gesture, but it would beat -some -of-the-----­usual stuff the media pick up from Notre Dame. But, then again, we would have to declare what side we are on.

"What a word is truth. Slippery, tricky, unreli­able." 
-Lillian Hellman 

L
et's talk about the common root of two current legal issues. 
"It will be incredible," said Andrea Thomas, of Royal Hawaiian Marriages, a Maui firm that caters to weddings, "Our monthly bookings could double." Her enthusiasm was prompted by the prospect that the Hawaii Supreme Court will rule, perhaps this year, that the ban on homosexual marriages violates the Hawaii constitution. Hawaii's same-sex marriages would probably not have to be recognized by states with a policy against such marriages. At least 20 states are considering legislation to establish such a policy. 
Charles Rice 

O
ther recent incidents confirm a trend to legalize homosexual marriages, including, among others, a resolution of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, a Reform group, supporting the right of homosexuals to enter civil mar­riages; and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown's performance on March 25th of a mass "domestic partnership ceremo­ny" for nearly 200 gay and lesbian cou­ples whom he pronounced to be "virtual spouses." "We're leading the way ... for ... the rest of the nation," said Brown. 
The other issue is assisted suicide. A 
U.S. Court of Appeals, in Compassion in Dying v. State, held last month that Washington's ban of assisted suicide vio­lated "a constitutionally recognized 'right to die' ... a liberty interest in deter­mining the time and manner of one's death." On April 2. a panel of the 2nd

Circuit Court of Appeals struck down New York's ban on assisted suicide as a denial of equal protection to "those in the final stages of terminal illness who are [not on) life-sustaining equipment [and who) are not allowed to hasten death by self-administering prescribed drugs." ommenting on these rulings, Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, said: "I have always thought that society would move toward some sort of legalization of assisted sui­cide, but I thought it would take the bet­ter part of a decade, not the better part of a year. You're talking about a sea change-overnight-in public policy on this issue." While both decisions affirm a right only of competent persons to assisted suicide, that right will inevitably be extended to the legally incompetent, so as to legalize the active, intentional killing of the persistently vegetative and other incompetent incurables. 
These higalizations-of homosexual 
marriage and assisted suicide-have a 
common root in the contraceptive ethic. 
We tend to forget that the Anglican 
Lambeth Conference in 1930 was the 
first time that any Christian denomina­
tion had ever said that contraception 
could ever be objectively right. 
"Lambeth has delivered a fatal blow," 
said editor James Douglas of the London 
Sunday Express, "to marriage, to moth­
erhood to fatherhood, to the family and 
to morality." 
The trajectory is a straight line from 
Lambeth to Mayor Brown's ceremony for "virtual spouses." The contraceptive -ethic affirms -that sex has no inherent relation to procreation and that man (including both sexes) is the arbiter of whether and when it will have that rela­
tion. If that is true, what objections, 
other than pragmatic or esthetic, can be 
raised to Mayor Brown's·"marriage" 
ceremony? 
The reality, of course, is that "[t)he

relationship of two men or women can­
not constitute a true family," as Pope 
John Paul II said in 1994 in response to 
the European Parliament's endorsement 
of homosexual marriage. "[T)he 
attempt has been made," he said, "to tell 
the inhabitants of this continent that 
moral evil, deviation, a kind of slavery, 
is the way to liberation, thus distorting 
the true meaning of the family." 
The trajectory is also a straight line 
from contraception to assisted suicide by 
way of abortion (which is merely prena­
tal euthanasia). If man makes himself 
the arbiter, by his own active interven­tion and mandate, of when life begins, he will predictably make himself the arbiter of when life ends. "The close connection...in mentality between ... con­traception and...abortion is.. .increasing­Iy obvious ... [T]here exists in contempo­rary culture a certain Promethean atti­tude which leads people to think that they can control life and death by taking · the decisions about them into their own 
hands." Evangelium Vitae, Nos. 13,15. 
I
n Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in 
1992, the Supreme Court said that "in 
some critical respects the abortion deci­
sion is of the same character as the 
decision to use contraception." And a 
contraceptive society needs abortion as 
a backup. As the Casey Court said, "for 
two decades...people have organized 
intimate relationships and made choices 
that define their views of themselves 
and their places in society, in reliance 
on the availability of abortion in the 
event that contraception should fail." 
Once abortion is accepted, euthanasia, 
which is postnatal abortion, will not be 
far behind. The Compassion in Dying 
court noted "the compelling similarities 
between right-to-die cases and abortion 
cases." Fittingly, the court relied in part 
on cases invalidating restrictions on 
contraceptive use and distribution for 
the proposition that "there is a realm of 
personal liberty which the government 
may not enter."

Classism, prejudice fuel eruption 
Criticism rests on 

Dear Editor: then for the eruption of traception does not convince, as In her letter to The Observer anti-Catholicism was class and it increasingly does not ­
Catholic tradition (April 12 ). Elizabeth Jensen cultural prejudice. Church doc­Catholics in the United States 
Dear Editor: 
In a recent letttlr to The Observer (April 12) , Elizabeth Jensen 1:omplained that Neve Gordon and Catherine Hottenberg's questions ( March 26) to an earlier letter signed by herself and other officers of "Feminists for Life" relied upon a "tradition of anti-Catholicism." I wish to ask Elizabeth and her colleagues to rethink the propriety of raising accusa­tions of "anti-Catholicism" against criticisms of the Vatican, especially at Notre Dame. 
The criticism Jensen complains of does rest on a tradi­tion-a long and honorable and deeply catholic one, as I once was happy to assure a student. She had enrolled in my course on the apocalypse because, having converted from a Baptist church that had believed that the Roman church was whore of Babylon and the pope the anti-christ, she wanted to know where that interpretation had originated. While I couldn't discover a single point of origin, I was able to inform her that it had largely been popularized by the spiritual Franciscans and their supporters in the twelfth and thir· teenth centuries. The Heformation found a well-developed fund of imagery and tropes for the excesses of the papacy nmdy to hand. 
Charges of anti-Catholicism come cheap, and in this con· text ignow the real imbalance of power. In areas and situa· tions where Catholics and Jews are few, anti-Catholicism, along with antiSemitism, racism, sexism and homophobia, continues to perdure. Hut in general. US Catholicism can no longer claim the status of a minority religious community, and sustaining minority apologetics can only make Catholidsm look small-minded. At Notre Dame, charging a letter in an in-house publication with antiCatholicism is Judi· crous. The university suffers from a degree of homogeneity approached only by medieval Europe; here as therethe few "heretics, infidels and Jews" (now labeled "non-Catholics") are suffered with a !,>'face that ranges from chary patronage to suspidous hostility. 
I find myself deeply grateful that Catherine and Neve do not conf'us1~ Vatican pronouncements with "the" position of Catholics; it seems that the diversity of their own tradition has prHpared them to recognize a heritage of faithful diver· genee in other communities.

accused Catherine Rottenberg and Neve Gordon of antiCatholicism after they had critiqued the Vatican's prohibi­tion of contraception. Jensen, a graduate student in history, should have known better. It was a cheap. theatrical shot to wrench a phenomenon as seri­ous as anti-Catholicism out of its historical context in an attempt to silence theological and ethical debate in a univer­sity setting .. 
America has, in the past, pro­duced its share of anti-Catholic prejudice. A WASP overclass was hostile to a Catholic under­class well into this century ­us the "No Irish Need Apply" notices made plain. The context trine was not the issue. 
Things have changed dramat­ically. Today Catholics are amongst the most economically successful folk in the United States, and the Notre Dame campus where Jensen studies is one of the most prosperous and well endowed in the country. She cannot help but be aware of this changed reality. Catholics are not a persecuted minority and ecclesial ortho­doxy which has social or politi­cal consequences must be open to critique. So it was reprehen­sible of her to pick up the anti-Catholic stick in an effort to intimidate Gordon and Hottenberg. 
If her orthodox line on con· use artificial means of birth control at about the same rate as Protestants and Jews -Ms. Jensen is entitled to stick to her guns in the same way that the Jehovah witness does when she or he refuses a blood transfu­sion, or the Christian Scientist does when declining medicine. Heligious tolerance in this country gives her every right to champion Natural Family Planning. On the other hand, she should acknowledge the right of those of us who see a critical need for safe, effective and inexpensive artificial birth control to promote it.

But not this Wt~ek. No. what you·n~ about to read is not an enlightPning 1~xamination of US polities or twnn anotlwr anti-administration 

Christopher Kratovil 
tiradn. hut just a series of personal ohsNvations about student life here in tlw spring. Frankly. thn end-of the-year madrwss has des1:nnd1~d upon me in full forc1~ and writing a politicized piecn is just beyond my capabilities right now. 
Perhaps you've notieml that the naturn of linPar time is sonwhow diiTernnt hem in South lll'rHI than in tlw rest of the r.ount.ry-and I'm not referring to Indiana's hizar-rn refusal to implnnwnt day light savings tinw. It is my conclu­sion that !Jill' hour of South Bend time in fil'l~r~rary is approximatdy IHJUal to l :~.7 SI'('Onds or laiP April/early May tinw. This rPsults in one of tlw emtlral ironi1~s or Notrl' llaiiH' student Iii'!~. sitH:n by t.lw tinH' that this town is enjoyable we're too busy to takP advantagn of it. 
My pnrsonal situation ean bn us1~d to illustrate this paradox. I. likn most of you. spPnt thl' long. gray winter in a sort of hon•do!ll irHfured quasi-hiJwrnation. 
For nxample. my main form of enter­tainmnnt during February consisted of checking the wind-chill added local tem­perature to see if it was colder here than at the Martian equator (you'll be disap­pointed to know that while we came dose a couple of times, South Bend was, at least this winter. never colder than the Mars). The sunless days melted one into the next in a dreary cycle of tedium. 
But suddenly it is no longer necessary to take Arctic survival gear with you when you leave your dorm. Indeed, its conceivable that you could in fact wear shorts and a !-shirt outside without risk­ing the loss of any appendages to frost­bite. Interplanetary temperature com­parisons no longer senm quite so nnter­taining as a whole host of activities are now possible. For example, when the wind is just right I can hear voices which I presume belong to the sand traps on local golf courses calling to me and saying something along the lines of "flit it here Kratovil! Feed us you bum !" Altnrnately, the sun drenched bleaehnrs of Wrigley Field kenp trying to convince me that "Cubs before class" is a valid and nven sensible equation. 
Even our own campus is not its usual dull self. Thn world's largnst five-on-five basketball tournament is taking place litnrally outside of my window, complete with a team of self-proclaimed shirtless fat guys and a couple of individuals playing in nothing more than joek straps. This weeknnd saw on honnst-to-Cod block party over on St. Louis Street, whiln nnxt wneknnd will bring us PigTostal and its orticially sanc­tioned hut sparsely attnnded on-campus counterpart, AnTostal. And if anybody notie1~d. Saturday also fnaturnd the Bltw Gold Game. Multiple nntertainment options-not including studying-at Notre Dame in the same day? Isn't that one of the signs that the End is near in Hevelations? 

What's more, love is in the air and even hard core cynics such as your humble narrator here have been affect­ed. Opportunities for cheesy-but-endear· 
'They didn't bring Dr. Ruth to campus without reason-it seems people are pairing off at an alarming rate.' 
ing Notre Dame moments abound; you no longer have to worry about being mauled by a polar bear as you walk around the lakes. They didn't bring Dr. Huth to campus without reason-it seems people are pairing off at an alarming rate. I would argue that we have more "glowing" people per capita on this campus right now than any­where else in North America, but then again my perspnctive may be biased. 
Hell, I don't know why I'm I bothering to write this column when I could just fill this space with the lyrics to the Beatles' Here Comes the Sun and get the samn point across. Still, I'm not going to sit here and try to convince you that the coming of spring has transformnd South Bend from a land of frozen tundra into a vnrdant Earthly paradise, but the quality of life bern right now is undnniably a lot highnr than it was two months ago. 
But as in all things, thn hand of The Man-that shadowy tyrant who oppress­es us all and to whom evnn Patty O'llara must ultimately answer -is about to intervene and dash my transient happi­ness. Even us I sit here glowing while ponderings the Zen of golf and the virtues of the female half of the human species. the gnawing rnulization that I have some 60 pages of writing (not to mention this damn column) due within the next 10 days is dawning on me. In other words. I'm going to have to turn out six pages of material a night in order to get this year over with. Stated mildly, that is not a happy thought. 
What's more; they tell me that The Man is going to line me $1 00 a day if this room isn't returned to the condition of a monastic cell by nnxt Sunday. Yes, only at the University of Notre Dame du Lac do they expnct you to deconstruct your room even as you attempt to study for finals. search for somnthing to do during the summnr (i.e. a job) and enjoy the few weeks of livable weather we get in this town. Thnre's not much I ean do about linals-l'm a student and they're just part of the game-but adding to an already exceptionally busy time by mak­ing people take apart there home and live amidst boxes and stacks of lumber for thn last two wenks of the year is absurd. The timing couldn't bn worse: why not give everyone that last weekend after finals to dnconstruct our rooms? Thn notion that people immediately start arriving for graduation rnally doesn't hold much weight-what parent or rela­tive comes to South Bend night days before the event'! This deconstruction policy once again demonstrates the administration's characteristic insensi­tivity to student nneds. Tlwre, even in a bright and perky column I can gnt at least one good dwap shot in at the min­ions of Thn Man who residns in the Dome. 
Christopher Kratovil is a junior whose column appears (!/Jery Monday.

• AT THE MOVIES WITH FATMAN AND DADDY 
Silly Rabbit, Candy's for 'Kids' 
"Brain Candy" 
***

(out or four) Directed by Kelly Makin Starring Dave Foley, Bruce McCulloch, and Scott Thompson 
Synopsis: Take a walk with the Kids in the Hall. Realize their brazen wit and daunting comedic prowess. Learn about their drug to cure depression. Laugh from beginning to end if you under­stand its complexity and its subtlety. 
Fatman: 
Once again, Lome Michaels is taking a skit-oriented type of humor and trying to turn it into an hour and a half long ver­sion of itself. And, as happens more fre­quently than not with these feeble attempts, he has produced another fail­ure. 
"Brain Candy" has its moments, but as a full-length motion picture, it never ap­proaches being anything other than a painfully extended skit which should only take ten minutes to perform. 
A happiness drug which locks on to your fondest memory and causes it to cycle over and over in your head is a modestly good idea for a plot. It is clever, it has potential for nasty little memories (which "Brain Candy" does provide), and it is a nice little conceit to keep the audience entertained. But, try­ing to base an hour and half film on it stretches the idea past its calling. 
It becomes trite and forced about half­
way through the movie and it leaves lit­
tle opportunity for subplots to develop. I 
think, again, it is a plot that would serve 
as a skit. It cannot sustain itself long 
enough to be a full length film. 
"Brain Candy" does have its successes. 
With characters like Cancer Boy (a crip­pled, nearly dead teenager who becomes a folk star), who can deny the beauty of Kids in the Hall's cynicism, which offends in such a distasteful man­ner? 
It is the small, nasty things that give the film its best laughs. Witty comments abound, but they are never able to overcome the ever-present lack of direc­tion that results from the film's embry­onic plot. 
Comparing Kids in the Hall with any­thing that Saturday Night Live does would be intolerably unjust to the for­mer group of comedians. Unfortunately, the marketing mind behind the SNL movies is also behind "Brain Candy". This fact means that the film was done cheaply and quickly with the intent of immediate release and quick sales. 
The script cannot hide the Lorne Michaels' touch. Kids in the Hall are talented enough to generate some laughs on their personal ire alone, but they are confined to their production's parameters. This fact is tragic. I am sure they would have turned out some­thing of a quite different caliber had they not been yoked to the genius be­hind "Pat the Movie" and "The Coneheads." 
I did not like the movie as much as Daddy. I am not sure if I want to endorse the exchange of your hard­earned cash for a night of sparse laughs. I would suggest watching Comedy Central and taking in Kids in the Hall sketches instead. This would allow for you to spend your money on something valuable, like a sailor's suit. You could invite the members of Student Affairs over and serve toast to everyone; it would be a big shindig. Plus, you could do this all in the privacy of your own lit­tle sanctuary. 
Daddy: 

At last, a movie that truly brings a smile to the stern and austere jowls of the oft-salty Daddy. Finally, a movie that, despite the somewhat flippant and baseless accusations of the Fatman, sparkles with originality; and likewise, one that injects a bit of freshness into what had recently become, prior to "Brain Candy"'s release, a rather stag­nant genre of film. 
Flee your mundane existence, at least for a brief respite, and enter the world of the Kids in the Hall; and, in doing so, take notice of some of the best social commentary and offbeat humor to hit the big screen in a long, long time. 
However, those individuals who find themselves sufficiently tickled by either the writings of P.J. O'Rourke or the vast menagerie of Robin Williams take heed, for the material inherent within "Brain Candy" might be a little too involved and difficult for you to appreciate. 
The work of the Kids has always been based on the absurd, and has always been the product of an examination of just how ridiculous the lion's share of the scope of humanity is. 
Thus, aside from the few easily notice­able comedic bones the cast throws out for the charitable benefit of the less-sen­tient portion of its audience, the ma­jority of the humor in "Brain Candy" requires more work to fully understand (and, hence, to fully enjoy as well) than those who like overt, physical slapstick or trite, cliched political humor are will­ing, or even have the capability, to do. 
Despite this reality, I urge you to per­severe, as the end result of such com­mitment will undoubtedly leave you greedily sating your comedic appetites with the succulent fruits of your labor. 
The accolades I would like to give to "Brain Candy" are, by far, too many to enumerate in the scant space of this col­umn, so I am forced to reduce my praise to a few salient points. Initially, prover­bial hats off to Kevin MacDonald for playing his archetypal role of the nutty professor to perfection. 
The same must be said of Dave Foley and Mark McKinney, who, in playing a drug company CEO (McKinney) and his obsequious yes-man (a character neutered of even his last name by the oppressive corporate hierarchy), demon­strate some of the more laughable, as well as some of the most frightening, aspects of big business in America today. The performances of Bruce McCullough and Scott Thompson are guaranteed to delight as well. 
Do not be frightened away from "Brain Candy" by either the presence of Lorne Michaels' name or the hollow rhetoric of the Fatman. Even a cursory investigation into the impetus behind "Brain Candy" proves that Michaels' influence was limited, if existent at all (one should remember the Kids' contin­ued refusal to participate in anything SNL, despite offers of the sort). 
Nor was the movie produced in the haphazard manner of the SNL movies themselves. The arrival of the Kids in the Hall movie has been anticipated for several years, and the longstanding fan base of the Kids further separates them from pan flashes like Adam Sandler or Chris Farley. Therefore, potential view­ers can rest assured that the chimerical connections between "Brain Candy" and SNL created by the Fatman are only those that are both drawn in ignorance and easily discounted. 
Fatman and Daddy are John Zach and Scott Bozik .

This holds especially true if you liked Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas." I know this comparison will be made until the end of time, but even though "James" was made with more sophisticated technology, the two movies are virtual cinematic twins, fraternal if not identical. The sto­ries, of course, are not the same, but gosh, if the look of "James and the Giant Peach" did not seem very familiarly Burtonesque ...

By JOEY CRAWFORD 
Acc<m l·.diwr 
W
hat do orgasms. masturbation, and tur­tl•~s all have in common? "Sexpert" Or. Buth Wnstheinwr addressed these and a surplus of otlwr topics during her lecture at Stt\IHln Centt~r Friday night. in front of a full­and sonwwhat rambunctious-crowd. Sex was tlw not the main focus of the lecture, as many had hoped. but rather, the nature of relation­ships in gtmeral. 
In what seenwd to be an ill-fated night. the thundPr crashing, the rain pouring, and the tor­nado wateh looming in everyone's mind, over three thousand pnopiP. trP.kkP.d to StP.pan Center to sen orw of tlw nation's foremost speakers on st~x. Dr. Jluth Wnstlwimer's credentials arc out­standing. Slw has written twelve books (inClud­ing "Snx for Dummies." which was written in the same style as thn popular computer self-help books), taught both kindergarten and collegn studnnts at somn point in her career, had a pop­ular radio talk show. and managed to still be a grnat nwtlwr. These are prntty outstanding fmtts for a woman who has had eonsiderable odds against lwr. Dr. Huth grnw up in Nazi <;•~rmuny and was orphaned at the age of ten. Dnspitn tlwsn l'ormidahln obstades, she has had a brilliant nmwr. 
Whnn Dr. Huth took tlw stage, no one knew exactly what to t!Xpeet, but she assured the crowd that slw would be as frank with tlw Notre Damn and Saint Mary's students as she would be on any other campus. With this eomment's dnlivnry. a loud clap of thunder ominously broke up tlw ovnrwlwlrning applause. "I guess some­orw doesn't want mn hnre," slw laughed. 
Tlw main focus of Dr. Huth's lecture was on mlationships and education. She cleverly com­parf~d relationships to a turtle: "A turtle carries around his housn with him; in order to be safe, lw puts his wholo body in his shell. Now he's safe. hut hn donsn't get anywhere," she main­tainnd. In ordnr to go anywhere with relation­ships, slw contimwd, people must be willing to take "tlw risks." Slw argued vigorously that risk-taking is not limited to males, but rather, tho job tmcornpasses both genders: "Women should not bn afraid to ask men out on a date." Slw also told a series of entertaining stories dealing with soxual misadventures; let's just say that mws and onion rings were mentioned along the way. 
Following the informative lecture, in which she dismissed many eommon myths by stressing that everyone is a unique individual, Dr. Ruth had a question and answer session. Students submitted written questions before the lecture so that they could be screened by Dr. Buth to avoid any uncomfortable situations. Westheimer handled typieal sex questions ranging from the mythical G-spot to penis size, oral sex, and masturbation (eommenting that three hours a day spent engaged in that activity may affect school work) with extreme grace. She also addressed ques­tions dealing with the rate that relationships move, believing that it is a women's right to say that a relationship is moving too fast, but it is also a man's right to say that things are moving too slowly. The pace should be set by a joint agreement between the couple. 
Unsurprisingly, Dr. Ruth also answered the question that was fixated on everyone's mind: "llow did you become this world-renowned expert on sex?" She stated that she did not grow up thinking that she would be one of histo­ry's top experts on sex, but she was always good at helping people with their relationships and listening. 
Following the lecture, Dr. Huth held an infor­mal meeting in the Dooley Room of LaFortune, in which she handled more personal questions, signed autographs, and posed for what seemed like an infinite amount of photographs. Some questions pertaining to the present state of gen­der relations at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, as well as Student Affairs' recent actions against homosexuals on campus, arose. She maintains that relationships here "need some practice." She then addressed the controversy surrounding Student Affairs, acknowledging that the exact reason why people are homosexual remains vague, but adding, "Hegardless of the reason, they should be respected." She further com­ments that, " If the morality at a school like this.. .is so very, very strong, then I think the issue needs some sitting down and diseussing." 
Dr. Buth Westheimer is a woman whose wis­dom far surpasses her small stature. She knows a great deal about sex, but she knows even more about relationships and living. Her message is clear: a person will not get anywhere in life if they dwell in seclusion. Life is a series of risks, and people must be willing and educated enough-as she herself is-to take them. 

• SOAP OPERA UPDATE Days ofOur Lives It seems that we are getting closer and closer to finding out who the Lady in White really is. Peter knows she saw him and Jude together at the arboretum and desperately wants to get her out of the picture, so he can be together with .Jennifer without any hassle. As he was about to seize his chance and kill the woman with a drug injection, he h"esitatod because she was humming a melody "that sounded vaguely familiar to him. Then Laura walked in and foiled his plans. As part of the woman's therapy session, Marlena and Laura gave the woman an injection of a psychotropic drug so that she would tell the absolute truth. However. after revealing parts of her past, such as the death of her husband and chil­dren, she stated that she did not know who tho other man with Jude was. An angry Jack then watched Peter and Jennifer unite "for good." Earlier, the Woman in White had stated that she did see Peter and Jude together at Aremid. She also said that after Stefano killed her family, he took her away to Maison Blanche. There, she confessed her past to Father John Black, and when Stefano found out, he held him prisoner and destroyed his identity. After Peter heard that the woman did see him and Jude together, he hit her with a ton of questions, confusing her. This situation set up the second questioning session using the drug therapy. Meanwhile, Kristen is involved in the fight of her life, trying to keep John. She thinks that by getting pregnant she will hold onto him, which puts her at about the same maturity level as a fifteen-year-old kid. She is also hiding the letter that she found, which expressns John's love for Marlona. After a te'arful afternoon of wondering if John really does love her and not Marlena. she waited, naked on the bed. for John. Later, as John was coincidentally about to open that very same book, she distracted him, managing to get the book away from his clutches. Marlena, of course, is very pitiful these days. She managed ·to walk in on Kristen and John numerous times as they either rejoiced in the afterglow of sex or were kissing. She was con· stantly remembering her marriage to John, aka Roman. When Marlena and John played with the kids, they both fought back memories of their past and present unknown love for each other. As far as another distant couple goes, it seems that Carrie and Austin may get back together relatively soon. This is all thanks to Kate, who has been wildly suspicious of Saml and Vivian's alleged scheming for some time now. She listened in on Sami's and Vivian's conversation while both were at Titan, and then slw confronted them. This brought Sam! to tears because she cannot believe that she has no more chances with Austin. Kate then told Austin ot' Sami's schemes to keep him and Carrie apart. He raced to Chicago, where Carrie and Lucas are having a "romantic" getaway. Austin hoped to tell Carrie the truth and that they really do belong together; however, Lucas has plans for Carrie too. Will Austin get there in time? Stay tuned. -Erin Kelsey and Christina Fticsar General Hospital fans... fret not! Ourfaithful GH corre­spondent will return next week.

--• WOMEN's SoccER Overzealous Tar· Heels exact meaningless revenge on Irish 
By JOE VILLINSKI 
Associate Sports Editor 
Somebody forgot to tell North Carolina head coach Anson Dorrance that this was only a spring game. 
As the Tar Heels defeated Notre Dame 3-0 in Atlanta on Saturday night, it was apparent this was more than an exhibi­tion game to North Carolina. The memo­ry of their 1-0 loss to the Irish in the national semifinals last December provid­ed motivation for the usual meaningless spring contest. 
"Anson made this game the focus of their spring," commented defender Kate Sobrero. "They were out to get us." 
Last week Dorrance had said that this spring game would obviously not take on 

... the seriousness of a regular season game. Dorrance, however, did not pass along this sentiment to his players. "They came out to brawl," goalie Jen Renola added. "They definitely came out wanting revenge and we came out like it was an exhibition game looking to get better," defender Kate Fisher said. "We came in with a more light-hearted attitude and that hurt us." These contrasting attitudes dictated each team's style of play. While Carolina exhibited their customary attacking play, the Irish were trying out a new defense. Consisting of a flat-four with no sweeper, the new defense worked as more of a zone. In the first half. the Tar Heels broke thorugh the experimental defense as for­ward Rachel Karvelsson beat Renola to 
tally the initial goal. 
"The new defense wasn't that bad, but we haven't practiced that much with it yet," Fisher said. "We look at the spring as a time to try new things." 
"It was not a big deal to us," Renola added. "We were trying out new things and treating it like any other spring game." 
Following the first goal, the Irish switched back to a man-to-man defense with a sweeper. 
The game then remained scoreless until the final twenty minutes of the sec­ond half as Robin Confer and Meg Uritis scored consecutive goals to put the game out of reach. 
Even without four of thei~starters, the Tar Heels aggressive style remained intact. North Carolina even flew for­wards Aubrey Falk and Sarah Dacey back from their lacrosse game to Atlanta for the game. 
"They always play the same way," Renola noted. "The narrow field we played on also catered to their direct style of play." 
The second half saw Notre Dame create viable offensive opportunities without capitalizing on them. 
"We had a lot of chances we didn't have in the semifinals," Fisher added. "We're gaining more confidence in the front." 
In the end, Carolina got its revenge, but in a meaningless setting. 
'They probably fen like they had some­thing to prove and they probably felt like they did prove something," Renola con­cluded.

The Irish began to quell the UMass fire before the end of the half. At the 8:08 mark, Brian Gilfillan took a pass from Jimmy Keenan and hurled a shot past goalie John Kasselakis. This made the halftime score 4-1. 
By denting the UMass lead, Notre Dame halted their mo­mentum. The Irish took ad­vantage of this reversal of for­tunes as they began the second half. 
Getting hit by a UMass de­fender as he shot. Gilfillan. this time unassisted, scored again to put the tally at 4-2. 
Then, at the 4:09 mark of the third quarter. despite having his body contorted and seemingly off balance, freshman Chris Dusseau, the team's goal leader. added to the Irish comeback. The score at the end of the third period was 4-3. 
The Irish continued this furi­ous effort into the fourth quar­ter. With 12:36 remaining in the game, junior Tony Reid blew past his defender and scored, tying the game at 4-4. 
Notre Dame seemed to have the game back in their control at this point. But this is exactly where the game got out of con~ trol.

game, regaining the "Big Mo" by scoring four goals, all within a four minute span. 
The Irish attempted to mount another comeback, but could not come away with the win in the end. Jimmy Keenan added a goal to finalize the score at 8­5. 
A telling statistic in this game was the shot advantage UMass held over the Irish in the fourth quarter. While the Irish could only get 7 attempts at the goal, the Minutemen shot 14 times, converting four. 
Despite this disheartening loss, the Irish refuse to get down. They realize that the season is not yet over and they are still very much in national contention. 
"We have to remember that a loss is a loss, home or away," stated Carle. "If [the loss) did anyth.!ng, it let us regain our focus.

Hoover, CJ's win despite playing shorthanded 
By KATHLEEN LOPEZ 
Sports Writer 
Sometimes teams are forced to play a man down, and that is when the true essence of team­work is present. This past Saturday, eighth-ranked CJ's Wooden Shoes were forced to play a man down against Team 
267. Team 267 hung in there with Ryan Hoover's team but, in the end, fell21-16. 
"It was a rough first half," stated Hoover. "The four of us had pulled together and got the victory. We were more worried about our teammate, though, than the win." 
Food poisoning caused Hoover's team much distress in the second half, not to mention the fact that they were up by two. Chad Chevalier suddenly fell ill, and vomited on the court. Chevalier appeared to be in ex­treme discomfort, and the para­medics were called in and took him to the hospital. 
Hoover's team performance was rather mediocre in the first half, but once Chevalier fell ill

the team stepped up. Hoover took it upon himself to get the victory. He was unstoppable, and Team 267 watched in amazement. Hoover found his range from the outside, and when that did not work he took it to the hoop. 
"This game was what book­store is all about," stated sopho­more Bryan Gaffud, of Team 
267. "It is about being out here with your friends, and not back­ing down. We gave it our best, and we didn't crack under pres­sure." 
CJ's was not the only squad to play a man short, as Yesterday, It's All in the Wrist took the court with just four. But that wasn't what attracted the crowd. 
One of the four, Bryan Lapinski, sported just a cowboy hat, boots, and a speedo. It was a bold move for Lapinski, and it did attract the crowds, but it did little to deter opponent CCE. 
Other than a lot of joking around, It's All in the Wrist, didn't do much talking on the court. 
Justice was unstoppable with shots from the outside and from the inside. CCE were good sports, as they put up with all of the Cowboy's trash talking. 
"Lapinski's outfit didn't sur­prise me," stated Justice about playing the Cowboy. 
Neither did CCE's 21-8 cake­walk.

Upsets begin in Bookstore 
By BETSY BAKER 
Sport' Writer 
Upsets becarrw ollicial in Bookstore XXV yes­tnrday. 
The larw~ crowds eontinued as the first seeded tnam fell in KMOB's 21-15 victory of no. 29 Stiff Compntition. Hyan Bohr of KMOB credited their strong inside play with the victory. 
".Jamin Spnneer dominated the inside," Bohr said. "lin opnrwd up the outsidt~. allowing for a lot of our shots." 
Bohr also commented on thn team's attitude going into the gamn as the underdog. 
"Wn wernn't nxpeeting it to be an easy game," Bohr addnd. "And it wasn't. Not a lot of pt~opln know our tnam. but Wtl should win some gamns." 
Anotlwr ranktld tnam fell as no. 28 Thn Observer lost in a nail-bitnr to Dolomite's Total Experitmee 26-24. 
In general, however, the secdnd teams proved their worth and will continue on toward the title. 

No. 2 NBT III defeated Don't Tell Our Business, Devil Woman, 21-10, despite a mediocre performance. 
NIH Ill guard Adin McCann commented on his team's play. 
"We didn't play as well as we wanted to, but we got the win," McCann said. "We are definitely going to need to play better because the competi­tion is going to get tougher." 
Although NBTIII dominated their opponent for most of the game, the team feels that in order to make a run at the crown, they must step up their game. 
"Luckily, today it didn't hurt us," McCann added. "But we can't u.fford to make stupid mis­takes." 
When asked about the pressure of being the second-ranked tea1n in the tournament, McCann responded, "It doesn't really matter how high you start, it's how high you finish." 
Third-ranked Dos Kloskas lived up to their ranking with a 21-10 victory over a tenacious Villa de Lobus team. It included big plays and big words, as the competition got as hot as the day. Lobos moved the ball well, but in the end, Dos Kloskas rythmic offense was too much to handle. 
"It wasn't anything dirty," Dos Kloskas' Bert Berry, who had a key dunk to spark his team's final run, commented. "It was just good, clean basketball. They came out and challenged us right away. We were forced to step up our offense and put a little more pressure on them with our defense." 
Some of the other seeded teams weren't so lucky. Although victorious 21-6, Pass the Beernuts VI lost one of its members, Junior T.R. Kane, to a broken wrist. Kane went down after going up for a rebound, leaving the no. 11 Beernuts minus a player. 
"Losing T..R. hurts us," captain Dan McConnell said. "We don't play until Tuesday, so that gives us a day to find a new fifth player."

Irish record perfect weekend 
By WILLY BAUER 
Sports Writer 
Move over Connecticut, there's a new power in Big East softball. 
Notre Dame completed a per­fect 6-0 weekend after sweep­ing St. John's. The highlight of the weekend was the Irish's 6-5 and 2-1 victories over perennial power Connecticut Huskies on Saturday. 
The Irish started the weekend with an 8-0 and 3-2 sweep over Valparaiso. The limelight was reserved for Irish pitcher Angela Bessolo who threw a no-hitter. the first of her ca­reer. Bessolo's perfect game was thwarted by an error. She struck out seven batters in her five innings of work. Kelly Nichols pitched two strong in­nings of relief work to pick up the win in the first game of the doubleheader. 
The Irish's big game of the weekend was Saturday, against the Huskies. Notre Dame ral­lied from a 5-0 deficit going into the bottom of the fourth and pulled out the 6-5 victory, with two out in the bottom of the seventh. 
Meghan Murray led off the bottom of the seventh with a double, but the Irish could not advance her with the next two batters. Elizabeth Perkins stepped to the plate with two down and smashed a grounder deep in the infield. With Murray running on the pitch. 
Perkins was able to beat the throw to first, sealing Connecticut's fate. 
The second game was a pitcher's duel, with Bessolo and her partners ending up on top, 2-1. Murray had an RBI single and scored two batters later, contributing Notre Dame's only offense for the game. With Bessolo's pitching, that was all that was needed. Bessolo struck out four, allowed five hits, and went the distance for the Irish. 
"To come back from a 5-0 deficit against Connecticut was unbelievable," raved coach Liz Miller. "We were able to put a couple hits together (in the sec­ond game), and they didn't." 
Sunday, St. John's came to town and Joy Battersby was the star for this day. Battersby tossed the Irish's second no-hit­ter of the weekend. and led the Irish in a 13-0 trouncing of the Red Storm. Battersby struck out three, but a walk prevented her from throwing a perfect game. Bessolo did not pitch that bad in the first game, a 2-0 win for the Irish. She allowed only three hits and had five strikeouts. 
"We had cold bats (in the first game)," said Miller. "We got the hits when we needed them, but we weren't efficient. We swung at a lot of bad pitches, and the times we hit the ball, we hit it to the third baseman and the shortstop. In the second game, we set the tempo early and had

Murray hit .473 with five RBI's and two dou­bles. Perkins was hitting a .375 clip and had four RBI's. The three accounted for almost half of the Irish's run production for the weekend. 
Defensively, Battersby and Bessolo were on top of their re­spective games. Both tossed no-hitters, the first no-no's of the season. Bessolo won three games, struck out 16 and post­ed a 0.31 earned run average for the six games. Battersby posted a 1.20 ERA and struck out five in her two victories. 
Notre Dame takes 'a break from Big East action this week, and coach Miller does not anticipate an easy going. Miller described Northern Illinois and Northwestern as "tough teams." Northern Illinois visits on Tuesday and the Irish travel to Northwestern later on in the week.

Minutemen deliver 
Irish 'crushing' blow 
By TIM MCCONN 
Sports Writer 
"Road Warriors" they may be. As of right now, however, "Home Warriors" just doesn't seem to apply. 
In upset fashion, the sixth­ranked Notre Dam-e lacrosse team 8-5 lost Saturday to the fifteenth-ranked Massachusetts Minutemen. Because of this second consecutive loss, the Irish record now falls to 7-3, with all three losses coming at home. 
"[To lose at home] is very dis­appointing," commented Irish sophomore goalie Alex Cade. "Not having won any home games is crushing to the team." 
It was very apparent from the outset that the Minutemen had come to play, while the Irish obviously seemed a bit lethargic. · 
"A lot of us got used to being in the top 10," said Cade. "I guess we kind of forgot what it takes to get there." 
That lack of intensity showed early. UMass came out smok­ing, scoring three first-quarter goals. The momentum contin­ued into the second period as the Minutemen scored another goal to increase their lead to 4­0.

shine in first spring contest 
By TIM MCCONN 
Sports Writer 

Saturday's anriual Blue-Gold game, the first of two this spring, served notice to both coaches and fans for the upcoming 1996 season. What they got to see may have been a glimpse into the bright future of Notre Dame football. 
The Blue team won 32-20, but this seemed to be inconse­quential as many players split time between the two squads. More important than the score in a game of this kind was the performance of the veterans expected to be key contribu­tors in the fall. 
With notable absences on both sides of the ball, howev­er, coaches and fans may have seen the future merging with the present. 
Due to injuries and suspen­sion_s to several prominent vet­eran players -quarterback Ron Powlus (arm), tight end Pete Chryplewicz (shoulder), tailbacks Randy Kinder (uni­versity suspension) and Robert Farmer (knee}, John McLaughlin (ankle), offensive linemen Mike Doughty (leg) and Chris Clevenger (shoul­der). and wide receiver Malcolm Johnson (team sus­pension) -Coach Lou Holtz was forced to insert many of his younger players into the lineup. 
Joining rookie starters Kory Minor, Mike Rosenthal, and Autry Denson were fellow freshmen Jamie Spencer, Jarious Jackson, Lamont Bryant, and Antwon Jones, as all received large chunks of

Notre Dame takes series from. G'town 
By DYLAN BARMMER Assismnt Sporrs Editor 
It's not too often that win­ning two out of three games can be considered anything close to a failure. 
It's also not too often that the Georgetown Hoyas baseball team wins. 
Both of these rarities occured this weekend in Washington, D.C., as the now 31-11 Irish baseball team dropped the first game of this crucial series by a 6-3 mark before cruising to 7-3 and 7-0 victories. 
The team's 2-1 series win puts the Irish at just 8-5 in conference play, and with only seven conference games re­maining, the Irish will have to play to the best of their abili­ties in order to secure a trip to the Big East Tournament. 
The lowly Hoyas, cellar dwellers in the Big East National division, came into the weekend with a dismal 12­24 overall record and a 4-10 mark in Big East action. 
But the Hoyas' seemingly sad hand was deceptive, for they had an ace up their sleeve. 

That ace goes by the name of Brian O'Hara, and he baffled Irish hitters for seven innings, allowing just seven hits and three runs-all unearned-in im­proving to 7-1 on the season. O'Hara, who has now ac­counted for over 50% of the Hoyas' wins, did not allow a single extra base hit in the game while striking out four and walking just one Irish bat­ter. 
Alex Shilliday wasn't quite so lucky on the mound, as the Hoyas roughed up the fresh­man phenom for four earned runs in just three innings of work. The Hoya attack was keyed by third baseman Andy Mariniello, who went 3-3 with two doubles and three RBI-.
