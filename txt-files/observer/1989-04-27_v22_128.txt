Takeshita's aid kills himself 
Associated Press 
TOKYO--Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, shattered politically and shaken by the suicide of his longtime aide, worked Wednesday to find a successor untouched by the money scandal that ruined his career. 
An aide to former Prime Min­ister Takeo Miki said senior politician Masayoshi Ito was "certain" to be chosen by Takeshita and other governing party leaders. Ito, 75, has a clean reputation and served briefly in 1980 as acting prime minister. 
Takeshita met with Shintaro Abe, secretary general of the governing Liberal Democrats, and agreed to choose a new party leader and prime mini­ster after Japan's April29-May

Editor's note: This is the first ofa two-part series on Teacher Course Evaluations. 
It's time for the Spring Teacher Course Evaluations, the semiannual process giving students the opportunity to evaluate their professors. 
Notre Dame faculty have 
been distributing the green 
TCE forms in many classes for 
more than fifteen years. 
Though most students fill out 
the forms, many are unaware 
of how TCE's are used and why 
they are important. 
TCE's perform a three-fold function, said Provost Timothy O'Meara. Their primary func­tion is to provide teachers a chance for self-evaluation and improvement. They also give students input into future classes, and the administration 6 "Golden Week" holidays end. 
The normally unflappable prime minister appeared shaken following the suicide Wednesday of Ihei Aoki, 58, an aide since 1958 and the man who handled Takeshita's scandal-tainted political dona­tions. 
"I strongly regret (his ac­tion)," Takeshita told reporters. "We walked side by side for over 30 years." 
Aoki, ~ho had served Takes­hita since 1958, was found dead Wednesday in his Tokyo apart­ment. Police said he had slashed a wrist and an ankle with a razor and hanged him­self after leaving notes to his wife and several other people, including Takeshita. Police declined to reveal the notes' contents. 
Takeshita said he had not seen Aoki's note, but thought it was possible the suicide was linked to the stock-profiteering and bribery scandal. 
Aoki's name, not Takes­hita's, appeared on loans and share dealings with the Recruit Co. that are under suspicion both for political ethics and bribery. The company, an in­formation services con­glomerate, is accused of trying to buy influence with politicians, bureaucrats, busi­ness leaders and media execu­tives. 
Takeshita announced Tues­day he would step down to take responsibility for the scandal. 
Takeshita had told Parlia­ment on April 11 that he had received more than $1 million in political donations from Recruit, but he did not mention the loan. 

CO·ED HOUSING 


Mixed views on co-ed housing 
By KELLEY TUTHILL and JOHN ZALLER 
Staff Reporters 
Editors note: This is the third in a three part series on coeducational housing. 
While many students are in favor of co-ed housing, many rectors, Administra­tors and alumni approach the idea more cautiously. 
Dr. Ann Firth, director of residence life, believes the issue of co-ed housing "is not a simple issue. There needs to be much discussion among students, adminis­trators, faculty, parents, and alumni." 
"This is an issue that needs to be weighed very carefully," added Firth. Last year, Firth chaired a task force set up to investi­gate the possibilities of coresidential housing at Notre Dame. The task force examined the strengths and weaknesses of many facets of residence life, dividing it into three categories: Per­sonnel, Residential Environ­ment, and Physical Facilities, according to the task force report. 
The final report issued by the task force suggested a committee be organized to further investigate the pos­sibilities of co-ed housing. 
Referring to the Observer survey on co-ed housing, Firth believes that the stu­dents desire for co-ed housing was greater than their desire to actually par­ticipate in it. 
Firth thinks that an ex­perimental co-ed hall might be a good indicator towards the future of co-ed housing at Notre Dame. "I'm not sure that, right now, we have the physical facilities to ac­comodate co-ed housing." Firth said. "Any type of co­ed housing must be under­taken within context of the guidelines of the Univer­sity," added Firth. 
Pat Doran, associate director of residence life, said student involvement might be important to the fu­ture of co-ed housing. "If there were sufficient student demand, further investiga­tion would be made, but there wouldn't automati­cally be co-ed housing. The administration would have to look deeper into it," said Doran. 
Sister Maureen Minihane, rector of Siegfried Hall said, "I don't have a problem with the idea." She believes that coresidential housing would be healthy for the students. As she sees it, the dorm is already half male half female during the day right now. 
Minihane said that in a 
dorm like Siegfried that is 
"L-shaped" co-ed by sec­
tions or wings could con­
cievably work. She said that 
she is happy with the set-up 
right now, but she would like 
it if the dorm went co-ed. 
"The rector situation would have to be changed," if a dorm went co-ed, said Minihane. She would be in favor of a male and a female rector in each dorm. The rules and parietals would remain, said Minihane. 
Father Thomas King, rec­tor of Zahm hall thinks co-ed

TEACHER COURSE EVALUATIONS 

Evaluations have three-fold purpose 
a criterion on which to judge faculty for promotion, reap­pointment, and tenure. 
"They are intended to be both an evaluative and diagnostic tool," said David Leege, pro­fessor of Government and In­ternational Studies, head of a faculty committee· to reevaluate the form, process, and uses of the TCE's six years ago. The Provost-appointed committee both examined forms from other universities and performed· two kinds of analyses to suggest modifica­tions. Specifically, they looked for more effective ways of wor­ding questions to elicit useful student responses and alter­nate ways of evaluating fac­ulty. 
Their biggest concern was to try to separate teaching effec­tiveness from what constituted merely "an interesting course," said Leege. With the recommended changes, they concluded that TCE's were a "reasonably effective" way of measuring faculty perfor­mance. 

Their recommendations led to substantial changes in the original TCE forms which gave professors grades for their per­formance on the 4.0 scale. The revised form now allows stu­dents to express their satisfac­tion in specific course areas and the degree to which they feel improvement is needed. 
TCE's not only allow faculty members the chance to find out what students think, they also play a role in determining pro­fessors' chances for reappoint­ment, promotion, and tenure. While the written evaluations are returned to professors for their individual use, the com­puterized forms are part of a larger process.

WORLD BRIEFS 


Students should confront world issues 
President Mikhail Gorbachev said in a speech released Wednesday that shortages of housing, food and consumer goods are growing despite his reforms, and he blamed runaway gov­ernment spending and Soviets who "forgot how to work." "The food problem is far from solved," Gorbachev said in one of his frankest admissions of the Soviet Union's problems. "The housing problem is acute. There is a dearth of consumer goods in the shops. The list of shortages is growing. The state's financial position is grave." 
A strong earthquake struck Mexico City and Acapulco on Tuesday, cracking buildings and an aqueduct, shattering glass and panicking thousands of people who remembered the killer quake of 1985. One man was electrocuted when power cables fell on him, and two women were seriously injured when they jumped in panic from the second story of a swaying building during the 8:26a.m. quake, officials said. 
Officials have launched a criminal investigation into the use of tear gas by soldiers who rushed thousands of people demonstrating for independence in Soviet Georgia, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday. But the spokesman, Vadim Perfiliev, denied that tear gas or any other chemical substance used by the soldiers killed anyone in the April 9 clash in the southern republic's capital of Tbilisi. Officials in Moscow have confirmed only that tear gas was used, but doctors treating in­jured protesters in Tbilisi said they were suffering from a paralysis of the central nervous system caused by an unidentified chemical substance. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 

Parental rights could betaken away from an Indianapolis woman who plead guilty to tying her toddler son up, placing him in a suitcase and leaving him in a car as she left town, prosecutors said Tuesday. Prosecutors say they cannot prove Portia Murray, 22, tried to murder her son, therefore a charge of attempted murder will be dismissed. Her son, Tyler, was 9 months old at the time of the incident on Sept. 9, 1988. She pleaded guilty Tues­day to the felony charges of confinement and neglect of a depen­dent. 
INDIANA BRIEFS 


I can't help but express infinite admiration for the student protestors in China. 
I am not writing a sales pitch for the "Great cause of universal democracy." Nor am I a particular fan of the violence that erupted during the demonstration. 
What I admire about this group of students is that they embody what I feel is the true meaning of the term "university student." 
They've gone beyond the standard conven­tions of the word, in the sense that we, as Americans, apply it--in addition to possessing enough energy to light the city of Manhattan, in addition to celebrating a brief period of time in which they can combine independence of con­stant parental input with an element of carefree irresponsibility, and in addition to planning the next party--these students are involved in their world. 
This involvement extends beyond the issues affecting them as students. They are aware of the more pressing issues of their society, and are unafraid, even eager, to make others take notice of their views. 
In the overall scheme of things, 150,000 stu­dents cannot expect to move mountains easily. Nor can they expect to change the Chinese gov­ernment overnight. I'd be willing to place bets that they realize that. The fact that they are not assured of success makes me admire them all the more. They had the guts to speak up and say what many were probably thinking. And they did so as a minority. 
If there is one regret I have about the type of place I selected to spend the "best four years of my life," it's the self-contained nature of the Notre Dame environment. It is not my intention to spend the remainder of this column dwelling on the old issue of what South Bend may or may not have to offer. I have been happy here, and given the choice to do it again, I wouldn't do anything differently. But I find that I'm too tempted to use the escape that this self­containedness provides. 
It is all to easy to become embroiled in the concerns of such a small cross-section of the world. Years from now I will reflect upon some Indiana rocker John Cougar Mellencamp says reports that he obtained a court order to bar a radio station from playing cuts off his soon-to-be-released album are lies. Mellencamp says he has no problem with publicity. "I'm used to people exploiting my name. But if they're going to make up lies about me, at least make up something I can tolerate." Last Wednesday, In­dianapolis radio station WFBQ stopped playing cuts off the "Big Daddy" album, which won't be officially released until May 4, when it got a call from Mellencamp's record company, Polygram.

Alison Cocks Production Manager 

of the issues that seem so earth-shattering now and wonder what I thought was so horrible. I can't help but think that it would be worthwhile to be like those students in Beijing and be able to tell my children that not only did I do some crazy things when I was a student, but I was a member of a group who confronted an issue and weren't afraid to express their displeasure with it. 
My parents would probably refer to this type of thinking as "youthful idealism." Youthful idealism will fade into adult realism as soon as I wake up in the morning and realize that I can't change the world, they say. Maybe I can't, but confronting something of significance to a large number of people will teach me more about the world then retreating into a conser­vative shell at a young age and waiting for the right career to fall into my lap. 
College is the time and place to make waves. Now is the time for us to be 'youthful idealists.' We are young enough and inexperienced enough to need the intellectual development that a career in idealism provides. Those students in China are students in every sense of the word. They are attempting to take a concept that many of them have probably only read about and apply it to their lives. They have also reached out and siezed the world, instead of waiting for it to come to them. I admire them for not only confronting the challenges of life, but for allowing life to challenge them. 
All of us at Notre Dame are capable of being students. Not just of Math 126, but of a world that we must confront if we are to truly become a part of it.

Tom bar rece1ves Truman Award 
By KERRY SCANLON 
News Staff 

Frederick Tombar has been announced as the recipient of this year's Harry 
S. Truman Scholarship. 
Tombar will be awarded $7000 for his outstanding achievement in public service at the federal, state, and local levels. 
On April 19th, the Board of Trustees of the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Founda­tion announced the 92 college students who will be awarded the 1989 Truman Scholarship on May 7th. 
Each recipient will receive an annual maxium stipend of $7,000 per year for the last two years of college and two years of graduate study. According to the Harry S. Truman Scholar­ship Foundation, the awards are granted to promising stu­dents who have demonstrated a firm commitment to a career in public service at the federal, state, or local levels. 
The scholarship program is now in its thirteenth year, and makes one new scholarship available annually to a student from each state. Each of the 13 Regional Review Panels recommends up to three addi­tional scholars for considera­tion to be "Scholars-at-Large." Thirty-nine additional scholars recommended were confirmed by the Board of Trustees early this week. 
Tombar is a sophomore gov­ernment major and intends to enter law school after gradua­tion. He applied for the award through the University after noticing a sign for it on a hall bulletin boards. His mother had just lost her job and told him to look out for outside scholarships. When Tombar told his mother he had won the award she immediately asked if he thanked God for it. "It's a Godsend. I can thank God for what He has done for me," said Tombar. Tombar added that receiving the award was "such a relief because he had been waiting since October." 
Tombar had to first fill out an application in order to be 
nominated by the University. Once his nomination was con­firmed he spent about a month working intensely on his essay entitled: "The Black Male: An Endangered Species." His es­say covered the problems he thinks the black male faces, and government solutions and policies to these problems. 
Tombar also discussed such things as money allocated to the prison system verses the Head Start program. He also stressed the value of education for young people. 
Tombar had read several of books by Jwenza Kunjufu and one, "The Conspiracy to Destroy Black Boys", provided him with some ideas for his es­say. 
He spent several days looking for important facts and statistics and met with Fred Wright, director of black studies to help prepare him for the interview process. 
Tombar went to SMU over spring break to complete the interview. It was a 25 minute process with a panel of judges that were politicians and pro­fessors. 
According to Tombar, "It wasn't the money as much as seeing how others could see he had potential to be a leader." 
Tombar is a member of the Multicultural Executive Coun­cil, Notre Dame Voices of Faith Gospel Ensemble, the speech and debate team, and was recently elected Grace Hall President. 
Last summer he worked for the City Council in his hometown of New Orleans and this summer hopes to work for State Senator William Jeffer­son. 
Tombar says that "Politics and law is the best way to bring beneficial changes to our soci­ety." 
"The Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation was established by an act of Congress as the nation's living memorial to our 33rd Presiden­tand reflects his strong belief in education as a bulwark of freedom," said Elmer Staats, chairman of the Board of the Scholarship program. 
This year Notre Dame nominated three students and for the first time in the Univer­sity's history, all three were chosen as semi-finalists.

Concerning the effectiveness of the TCE's, the Provost agrees that though they pres­ent some problems of readability, the TCE forms are a useful tool in determining what students think of their teachers. While no form is 100 percent accurate, he admitted, there is a value in having one standard TCE form for all courses : consistency. 
Though he is not closed to the idea of change, O'Meara feels that more attention should be paid to what TCE answers in­dicate and less to the wording of the questions. "If changes were made in the questions, there would be some technical improvement," he said, "but the results would largely stay the same."

Lucille 'Lucy' Ball dies at 77 


Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES--Lucille Ball, the daffy comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy but delighted viewers for four decades, died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery. She was 77. 
The actress, star of the hugely popular "I Love Lucy" and related situation comedies seen in more than 80 countries, had undergone major heart surgery Apljil 18. 
She had · been recovering steadily, getting out of bed and joking with the staff, but shortly before dawn Wednes­day, she went into cardiac ar­rest due to internal bleeding and could not be revived, said Cedars-Sinai Medical Center spokesman Ronald Wise. 
She suffered a complete heart failure at 5 a.m. and 47 minutes of resuscitation efforts proved fruitless, Wise said. "There was nothing to indicate this would happen," Wise said. "The heart itself apparently was not involved in Miss Ball's sudden death." 
In the 6-hour surgery at Cedars-Sinai, doctors replaced her aorta and aortic valve. Al­though the replaced portion of Miss Ball's aorta did not ap­parently fail, the entire artery was in poor condition when she was operated upon, said Dr. Robert Kass.

In 1961, Miss Ball married nightclub comic Gary Morton, who became her executive producer, and remained on TV 
. for 12 more years in the weekly "Here's Lucy" and "The Lucy Show." Miss Ball was born Aug. 6, 1911, in Jamestown, N.Y., the daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist. As a model, her ads for Ches­terfield cigarettes caught Hollywood's eye, and in 1933 she went to California. She ap­peared with the Marx Brothers in "Room Service," with Fred Astaire in "Follow the Fleet" and with Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers in "Stage Door." In all, she appeared in more than 75 movies. "progressed all the way down into her abdomen." Miss Ball, with her fireJ engine red hair and siren wail, was considered the queen of sit­uation comedy and a pioneer of the sitcom format. "I and 100 million others will miss her," said comedian 
George Burns. "But we haven't lost Lucille Ball because she's still with us on television and we can see her on and on." 
"Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an Amer­ican institution," former Pres­ident and Nancy Reagan said in a statement. "Just the men­tion of her name brings a smile. ... We love Lucy and will miss her deeply." 
"It's a shock after working very closely with her and loving her for over 35 years," said Miss Ball's frequent sidekick, Gale Gordon, who was in Edmonton, Alberta. 
While in the hospital, the comedian was deluged with thousands of cards, letters, flowers and phone calls from fans as far away as Australia and Europe. 
Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in "I Love Lucy" from 1951 to 1957 and have been seen since in widely syndicated reruns. The late Vivian Vance and William Frawley played their neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz. 
Her split-second timing, .wide-mouthed wails and exag­gerated pratfalls made the "I Love Lucy" show one of the most popular in television his­

Father kills son by unhooking life-support system 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO--A father tear­fully unhooked his comatose baby son's life-support system early Wednesday, then took him into his arms and kept hospital workers at gunpoint until the child was dead, aut­horities said. 
I'll only hurt you if you try to plug my baby back in," police quoted Rudy Linares as saying. 
"You can understand the mo­tivation," police Sgt. William Rooney said. "I guess he didn't want his child to continue living under those conditions." 
The painter from west subur­ban Cicero was charged with son, Samuel, said Lisa Howard, spokeswoman for the Cook County state's attorney's of­fice. 
Linares, 23, was held at a police lockup pending an ap­pearance in bond court. His wife, Tamara, who said the couple had planned to see a lawyer Friday about having disconnected, was not charged. 
"This is the best thing," Mrs. Linares told radio station WBBM-AM. "Sammy is out of his misery." 
The couple have two other children, both under 5. 
Linares also unhooked his son's life support system on Dec. 30 but staff members Bulava said. When Linares ar­rived early Wednesday, he spoke briefly with security per­sonnel but was not searched, Bulava added. · 
Doctors had notified the par­ents Tuesday that the child was to be transferred to a long-term care unit, said Rush­Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medi­

Abortion Patients 
Anti-abortionists plead case 
A statistical breakdown based on a survey of 9,480 women who had abortions in 1987 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON--Abortion opponents led by the Bush ad­ministration urged the Su­preme Court Wednesday to overturn its landmark 1973 ruling that women have a con­stitutional right to end their pregnancies. 
Outside, police arrested 27 abortion-rights activists, among a noisy crowd of people demonstrating on both sides of one of the the nation's most divisive issues. Those arrested were charged with crossing a police line. 
In sharp contrast, the hour-long argument session took place in a packed but hushed courtroom. 
"The United States asks this court to reconsider and over­rule its decision in Roe v. Wade," said Harvard law pro­fessor Charles Fried, referring to the ruling that legalized abortion. 
But Frank Susman, a St. Louis lawyer representing those who successfully chal­lenged an abortion-limiting Missouri law in lower courts, argued, "There can be no or­dered liberty for women with-

"It doesn't surprise me," said King that the majority of students are in favor of co-ed housing as shown in the Obser­ver survey.

Missouri Attorney General William Webster urged the court to restore the state's abortion regulations even if it does not reverse the broader 1973 decision, which was based on women's privacy rights. 
Fried, a former Justice De-· partment official called back to government duty for Wednes­day's session, argued, "We are not asking the court to unravel the fabric of ... privacy rights which this court has woven. We are asking the court to pull this one string." 
Susman responded, "It has always been my personal expe­rience that when I pull a thread my sleeve falls off. There is no stopping. It is not a thread he is after." 
Questioning by the justices was brisk but not as aggressive as it has been in many argu­ment sessions of recent years. 
Seven of the nine court mem­

hers probed the positions of the 
three lawyers in front of them. 
Only Justices Thurgood Mar­
shall, a strong supporter of 
abortion rights, and Harry 
Blackmun, author of the 1973 
decision, remained silent. 
The justices, who do not nee­essarily have to reconsider Roe vs. Wade in resolving the Mis-cation as to how broad their decision will be. They are expected to announce their ruling by July. 
At one point, Justice Antonin Scalia--a potential "swing vote" along with Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and An­thony Kennedy--asked whe­ther the court must consider the nature of a fetus. 
"Can you derive (a funda­mental right to abortion) with­out making a determination as to whether the fetus is human life or not?" Scalia asked. 
"It is very hard to say ... it must be a fundamental right unless you make a determina­tion that the organism that is destroyed is not a human life," Scalia suggested. 
Susman said an assertion that "life begins at concep­tion," as stated in the Missouri regulations, is not a verifiable fact but "a question verifiable only by reliance upon faith." 
Fried said the Bush adminis­tration was not asking the court to end all protections for wo­men whose lives might be en­dangered by childbirth. 
"We are not here suggesting that the court allow blood­
ed housing and being a part of it," said Riordan. 
"I don't think I'd want to be a rector of a co-ed dorm," said Father Michael Sullivan, rec­tor of Carroll Hall. Sullivan said problems with managing the hall might arise because rectors might not be able to handle all the problems of both big issue. I run into it here in a unisex hall," added Sullivan. 
Miriam Hill, a 1987 Notre Dame graduate, thinks that co­ed housing would be an advan­tage at Notre Dame. "It should be an option for students. Re­lations between the sexes were very strained when I was at Notre Dame and common housing may help alleviate that 
problem." Hill thinks the strain exists "more than it should be­cause things are separate in many ways for men and women at Notre Dame."

Bookstore Basketball altercation reveals unsportsmanlike attitudes among some 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to relate to the student body a couple of things that I had not . previously known. These revelations were the result of a Bookstore Bas­ketball game that I had occa­sion to witness this past Mon­day. 
One of the teams playing con­sisted of a few football players while the other was composed of a quintet of Stanford Hall freshmen. It represented an op­portunity for the residents of Stanford to come out and sup­port the team. 
As the game progressed, things began to get out of hand. A one-sided shoving match resulted in fans from both teams pouring on to the court in an attempt to break up the "fight." As everyone now knows, the players involved were ejected from the game. It is my opinion that there was no 
._____n_e_e-i &,.. ~one to rush on to 
the court. T~ ~eearation of 
any hostility should be the job 
of the referees, who had begun 
to work in that round of sixty­
four. Violence has no place in 
sports, especially in Bookstore 
Basketball, but different 
people have different ideas on 
that subject, I'm afraid. 
Following the altercation on the court, there was nearly one off the court as well. I am as­hamed to say that I was in­volved. I was . not amongst those who chose to flood the court in order to break up the fight. In a somewhat meager attempt to help restore order, I was yelling at people to get off the court. One individual, who happens to be a reserve on the Notre Dame football team, did not take kindly to my at­tempts and proceeded to come over to have a chat. 
Asking me what my problem was, I told him that he had no business being on the court. He did not agree. "I was out there helping to break up the fight," he said. Again, I told him that he had no business being out there. At this point, he became slightly agitated. As he was restrained by a fellow football player, he yelled, "Look, you're wearing 'our' stuff." At the time, I was wearing a Notre Dame National Championship T-shirt. He continued, "You'll root for us in the fall but when it comes to Bookstore you won't." He concluded his tact­ful tirade by asking me what I had done for the University of Notre Dame. I could not think of one thing to say except "get out of here." I really wanted no part of what he was trying to goad me into. It made about as much sense as going out on the court to break up the "fight." As I thought later about the events that had transpired, a guy in my section came in and told me something that I found rather interesting . He said some of the football players that he knew could not understand why other students on campus did not like them. I instantly thought of the com­ments made by the football player that I had run into ear­lier. 

Ask any of my friends and they will tell you that I am one of the most fervent supporters of the football team. Having lived in this area all my life, I have seen the best and the worst they had to offer. But just because I support them during the football season, does it also mean that I have an obligation to come out and support them during the Bookstore Basket­ball tournament? I think not. I was rooting for my friends, the football players were rooting for their friends. Is that so wrong? 
Another thing that stuck in my mind dealt with my friend's query as to what I had done for the University. I can think of the many service projects and my year here as a resident as­sistant as things that I have done for the University. Win­ning a national championship is great, but if that's all you can claim as your contribution, then you have missed out on what it is to be a student at the University of Notre Dame. 
The final thing that stayed with me was the football player's comment that my na­tional championship T -shirt was "their" stuff. I had no idea that when I bought that shirt and others, there was a clause stating that I was, in reality, only renting the shirt. Who does he think he is? If this attitude is prevalent among football players (and I sincerely hoPe it is not), I can hpJ"DlY keep myself from laughmg when I think of football players pon­dering why they are not liked on campus.

Catholic Church needs to promote birth control as a lesser evil than abortion 
Dear Editor: 
In this week's Newsweek magazine, an article on abor­tion states that of all Protes­tant, Jewish, and Catholic women in the United States, the group whose members are most likely to have an abortion is the Catholic one. 
It seems the Catholic Church hurts its own cause. Permitting the use of birth control is the first step to changing this em­barrassing statistic. I agree that the degree to which a reversal of the birth control po­sition would help is probably small, mainly because most sexually active Catholics already use birth control despite the Church's teachings. 
DOONESBURY 
However, a change in attitude on the part of the Catholic Church could help immensely. When birth control is not used or fails to work, and a Catholic woman becomes pregnant (especially out of wedlock), an abortion would not be foremost in her mind if her religion did not essentially label her as a "sinner." If the Church is cor­rect in its stance on abortion-­and I believe it is--then why doesn't it help itself by being more open to the subject of human sexuality rather than continually condemning "the dastardly deed? "

Blackhawks w1n Norris title 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS--Bob Murray and Wayne Presley scored eight seconds apart to key a three­goal burst in the second period Wednesday night and the Chicago Blackhawks won the Norris Division championship with a 4-2 victory over the St. Louis Blues. 
Chicago, outscored 27-17 by St. Louis in eight regular­season meetings, captured the best-of-7 series in five games, winning the last three games. 
Dave Manson had two assists for the Blackhawks, who had the lowest point total of the 16 playoff and has now advanced to next week's Campbell Con­ference finals against the Cal­gary Flames. 
Chicago, trailing 1-0, received the break it needed when Blues defenseman Glen Featherstone received a major penalty and game misconduct for an altercation with Black­hawks rookie Jeremy Roenick. 
The teams were both a player short when Murray took Man­son's pass from inside the Chicago zone and skated in alone on St. Louis goalie Greg Millen. Eight seconds later, Presley scored at 9:25 of the second period after Black­hawks captain Dirk Graham stole the puck in the Blues zone. 
Roenick capped Chicago's three-goal spree with St. Louis a man short due to Feat­herstone's penalty, ripping a slap shot off the right boards between Millen's skates with Blues defenseman Tom Tilley serving as a screen. 
Roenick's goal, his first of the playoffs, increased the Black­hawks' lead to 3-1 at 12:13. Til­ley scored at 17:28 on a 50-foot slap shot, but Steve Thomas scored on a breakaway from Adam Creighton for Chicago with 11:37 left. 
It was the Blackhawks' fifth playoff victory in six series against St. Louis and avenged a loss in five games to the Blues a year ago.

4: 18 while St. Louis was on a power play represented the first period's lone goal. Chicago finished the period with an 8-6 advantage in shots and dominated the middle per­iod by taking 17 shots on goal to the Blues' six. 
Murray's goal followed by Presley's set a 47-year-old Blackhawks playoff record, bettering a mark of two scored 11 seconds apart in 1942.

The Texas hitters have sup­ported these pitchers with a potent attack of their own. Ruben Sierra has been on fire this spring, batting .375 with four home runs while playing right field. 
Cecil Espy has silenced crit­ics who have complained that he isn't the leadoff man the Rangers are looking for. The fleet-footed center fielder has stolen 11 bases, second only to Rickey Henderson of the Yankees, and is batting well above a .300 clip. 
Acrobatic second baseman Julio Franco is even pitching in. Although Franco is living up to his reputation as a light hitter (he was batting .259 as of this weekend), he has driven in a league-leading 18 runs. 
The Rangers are going to need continued support from people like Sierra, Espy, and 
4/28 BK 10 

Franco if they are going to con­tinue their unlikely drive for the AL West pennant. 
The A's are on a seven-game winning streak, and they are certainly a force to be reckoned with. But if the Texas pitching staff continues to throw strikes, they may find themselves on top of the AL West at the end of the year. 
And middle-aged men throughout the country will abstain from beer and potato chips as they tune in to cheer a 42-year-old man who whiffs dazed batters with a 98 mile­per-hour fastball.

Track teams split up for concurrent meets 
By KEN TYSIAC Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's and women's track teams will each send athletes to both Drake and Ball State this weekend to compete against some of the best run­ners in the Midwest. The meets will be run concur­rently, so the Irish will have to split up their teams to compete in both meets. 
The strongest athletes from each team will travel to Des Moines, Iowa for the Drake Relays Friday and Saturday. This meet is one of the most challenging meets in the country for this time of the year, so the 17 Irish striders who make the trip will have to be at their best to cross the finish line first. 
Hurdles star Glenn Wat­son will try to qualify for the NCAA's this weekend. Wat­son will look to improve on his impressive performance in last weekend's Kansas 
__.Relays, in which he re­cordei:t·--a_ time of 14.24 seconds in t~-meter high hurdles. . \

man Ron MarkeziCh. Markezich will be running in the 5,000 meters at Drake, and Irish coach Joe Piane is hoping that his marquee man will bring a first place trophy back from Des Moines. 
Piane also has high hopes for Tom O'Rourke, who will run the steeplechase at Drake. Searcy echoes his co­ach's enthusiasm. 
"Torn hopes to qualify for the NCAA's this weekend," says Searcy. "He should do well--he has a lot of good workouts behind him." 
The Irish will also run one­and two-mile relay teams at Drake. Piane especially has high hopes for the two­milers, who will look for strong performances from Mark Lavery and David Warth. 
These Irish men will be joined by three athletes from the Notre Dame wo­men's track team. Senior Theresa Rice from Mis­hawaka will travel to Des Moines with freshman team­mates Lucy Nusrala and Sheila Stewart.

Latest charge may reduce Edwards' value 
Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS--Battery charges filed this week against Jay Edwards cast doubt on whether the former Indiana University basketball star is emotionally ready for the NBA, some analysts say. 
A may 30 bench trial is sched­uled in Monroe Superior Court for Edwards, who pleaded in­nocent Tuesday to two mis­demeanor charges involving allegations he struck a woman at a party in Bloomington last week. 
"If you aren't strong, mature and disciplined, you can get swept into the web of destruc­tion," said Clark Kellogg, a former Indiana Pacers player. 
"For somebody with a fol­lower's type of personality makeup, the road in the NBA can be very dangerous. You have a lot of people who can be vultures. They will try to take advantage or manipulate a kid who doesn't have his feet firmly on the ground," said Kellogg, a sportscaster. 
Last month, Edwards 
decided to forego his final two 
years of college eligibility for 
a shot at a career in the NBA, 
apparently without talking 
with coaches or counselors. 
"I had my mind made up," 
he said. 

Edwards cited IU's Big Ten Conference championship, his selection as Big Ten player of the year and second-team All­America by The Associated Press as accomplishments that would make him a high draft pick. 
But a propensity to rebel at school regimentation and au­thority also may have played a role in his decision. 
"You know, just people tel­ling me not to do this, not to do that, constantly. That's about the only thing that really ag­gravates me. 
"It ain't that hard on the court, because that's where I like it. And that's where I'm most comfortable than anywhere else,'' he told The In­dianapolis News last week. 
But some NBA officials ques­tion Edwards' maturity to play in the pros. 
"I'm not saying Jay Edwards isn't going to be a tough player, but I don't know that at his age he's ready to walk into this world where there are men fighting for their livelihoods," said Pacers general manager Donnie Walsh. 
NBA scout Marty Blake calls Edwards' decision "a cata­strophic mistake." 
But it will get him away from the academic world, which he said was a necessary evil that allowed him to play basketball. 
"I knew I had to go to school to play basketball. So, that gave me an incentive to go to school," he said. 
But it was not enough of an incentive to stay out of trouble at Indiana.

The Notre Dame women's tennis team hopes to end its successful regular season with a sound defeat of Toledo at home this Saturday. 
The 15-6 Irish plan on using their entire line-up in the 9 a.m. meet which will be played out­door on Courtney Courts, wea­ther permitting. Otherwise it will be held in the Eck Tennis Pavilion. Notre Dame head coach Michele Gelfman predicts her squad will beat the 7-8 Rockets in the singles com­petition. Non-regulars then will compose the doubles roster, al­though the exact line-up is not known. 
"We want to end the season with a strong victory and we should be able to," said Gelfman. 
The Irish have downed Toledo all six times they have played them and won 8-1 last year. Notre Dame, much im­proved over its 12-14 record last season, should have no trouble dealing with the Rockets. 
The Irish will then have to wait until May 5th, when the NCAA bids come out, to see if they will have a chance at post­season play. Gelfman feels her team proved its strength throughout the year by defeat­ing some tough California schools and downing Big Ten squads that had previously given the Irish trouble. 
"Our record should earn us a bid, but with the politics of the NCAA, you never know," commented Gelfman. "We've proved we can play with most of the Big Ten teams and we've improved so much, it would be great to earn a spot."

to. We just helped them with a few defensive miscues." 
The Irish victory also ended a long draught against Indiana. Going into Tuesday game, Notre Dame had lost its last eight games against the Hoosiers, and Erik Madsen had a personal 0-3 record against them. 
"It's a good accomplishment for the players to beat In­diana," said Murphy, "because they hadn't beaten them. It was another bit of ad-

Supreme Court ruled out the chances of The Vixens advanc­ing to the final16 with their 21-7 win. Mary Simon dominated the court as lead scorer and top rebounder with 11 points and 5 boards. 
In the North bracket the Nads continued their winning streak as they defeated the Traveling Sleighbells 21-6. Jen­nifer Slosar and Chris Cho­quette each tossed in 8 baskets to help their team to victory. 
We've Got It Put It Through stuck it to Ryan's Rabble Rousers and earned a final 16 competition spot against the Nads with their 21-1 triumph. 
The Secret Service forced Four Freshmen With Lipps to kiss their chances of advancing goodbye as they defeated them 21-10. Rachel Hall set the pace for the Service with her contri­bution of 7 baskets and 10 rebounds. 
The final team earning a semi-final spot was Three of Marv's Rejects and Two of His Stars with thier victory over Five Girls and a Basketball. Linda Garrett had 8 of the points that lead to Marv's 21-8 win.

versity to conquer." 
The Irish were aided by four Indiana errors. In the first in­ning, Notre Dame put two un­
earned runs on the board when Frank Jacobs reached base on a two-out error by the firstbasemen, enabling Cory Mee to score from third. Later, James Sass singled home Ed Lund to make the score 2-0. 
The errors kept pouring in when in the third inning and the score 3-1, Joe Binkiewicz lifted a routine fly ball to rightfield which was dropped, enabling Sass and Craig Counsell to score. 
In the sixth, with one out and the score 6-1, Dan Peltier drew a walk and Lund singled to left. Jacobs followed with a deep fly ball to right that was mis­judged by the rightfielder, al­lowing Peltier and Lund to score. After a pitching change, Sass promptly singled home Jacobs to make the score 9-1. 
Notre Dame added two insur­ance runs in the seventh, which must have awakened the In­diana bats, as the Hoosiers rallied for six runs in the top of the eighth inning. 
The scoring was highlighted by a bases-loaded double by Hoosier co-captain Geoff Flynn that ended the Indiana

draught. Irish reliever Mike Coffey replaced Brian Piotrowicz, and after allowing three consecutive singles, he got Tom Meyers to ground into a doubleplay that ended the ral­ly. 
EXTRA BASES: Murphy is not taking any upcoming game for granted because of Notre Dame's new reputation as a dominating team. Concerning the game with the Chicago State Cougars, Murphy said, "These games become real tough because our pitching is down as far as numbers are concerned and because they've

If he were to be hitless in his next 79 at-bats, he would still be hitting .300...James Sass is also a hot hitter for the Irish, enjoying an eight-game hitting streak and batting .408. Sass was 3-for-5 with two RBI yesterday...Slowly creeping up in batting average is Pat Pesavento, who has raised his

Bookstore Basketball

By HEATHER ATKINSON 
Saint Mary's Sports Editor 

An additional eight teams ad­vanced one step closer to be­coming the 1989 Women's Bookstore Basketball Cham­pions during yesterday's games. 
Spraky's Franchise II, a team chosen to do well in the East bracket at the beginning of the competitoins, easily defeated We've Never Been Scored Upon With a final blow­out score of 21-1 
Kathleen Zassick sank the only basket for her team while Kathleen McDavid paced Sparky's with her contribution of 9 points. 
The J aegermonsters earned the spot against Sparky's Fran­chise II with their 21-6 win over Revenge of Beefer's Chicks. J aegermonsters dominated the boards with Maura Schoshinski pulling down an outstanding 19 rebounds and Audrey George following closely behind with 15 rebounds. Schoshinski also lead her team in scoring with 9 points with Mary Bohmer ac­companying with her 8 points.

The Notre Dame baseball team reasserted itself by defeating Indiana 11-7 behind an impressive 18-hit attack at Jake Kline Field on Wednes­day. 
Every batter in the lineup had at least one hit, and the pitching staff held the Hoosiers to one run until the eighth in­ning. 
The victory comes at a cru­cial point in the season for the Irish (31-10), as they dropped three games out of four this past weekend against MCC East rival Detroit. The team bounced back quickly instead of going into a prolonged slump. 
"This was a vitally impor­tant victory in all senses of the word," said Irish head coach Pat Murphy. "This shows me that this team has guts, this team has an identity, that they won't take losing sitting down. They don't care who they're playing the next day, they won't be satisfied with losing and won't get scared, playing with their hands around their necks." 
Next up for the Irish is an away game with Chicago State today, whom the Irish beat ear­lier this season 7-1. 
In the victory against In­diana, starting pitcher Erik Madsen went five innings and allowed one run to raise his record to 7-3, yielding four hits and striking out four. 
"I think Madsen pitched beautifully," said Murphy.

Adworks survives scare to advance to round of eight 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
The top seed finally got a test Wednesday in Bookstore Bas­
ketball  XVIII.  The  team  
passed,  but  not  with  flying  
colors.  

Adworks All-Stars struggled and clawed its way to a 21-15 win over The Good, The Bad and The Laundry to advance to the quarterfinals. It was the first time in the tourney a team had scored in double figures against the defending cham­pions. 
"We didn't expect an easy game," John Buscher said. "You can't expect to win 21-7 every game. Every game from here on out is going to be close." 
At one point, this game was more than close. The teams were tied at 15-15 before Ad­works ran off six unanswered points to seal the victory. 
"We've got such good ath­letes that we just picked it up at the end of the game," Bus­cher said. 
Adworks connected on 21-of­59 from the field, its worst shooting outing of the tourney. Tony Rice led the team with eight points, while Derrick Johnson tossed in five. 
Doug Bunn led The Good, The Bad and The Laundry with six hoops. 
The No. 2 seed, Malicious Prostitution, got past Air Check and Ground Support by a 21-15 count. It was also the first big test for Malicious Prostitution, easy winners in their previous games. 
"I didn't think we played that well," Joe Scott said. "The past few games, we've gotten off to slow starts. But as the game goes on, we play a little bit bet­ter." 
Scott paced the winners with seven points, while John Bergman tossed in five. Gary Leonard scored six points in a losing cause for Air Check and Ground Support. 
Malicious Prostitution will meet No "I" in Team, 21-16 winners over Bennitt's Buffet. Pete Dales keyed No "I' with 6-of-8 shooting. 
Killer Bees continued its roll with a 21-19 win over Rodan, Sky and 3 Guys Who Can Fly. The Bees will have a big test with their next opponent, the top-seeded Adworks.

But Ryan doesn't need a curveball if he is blowing 98 mile-per-hour bullets past opposing batters. He proved this again Sunday night when he came within two outs of no­hitting the Toronto Blue Jays in a 4-1 victory. 
This time it was Nelson Liriano, a .208 hitter, who spoiled Ryan's night. Liriano pulled a fastball int? the right f~eld corner with one out in the bottom of the mnth for a triple which ruined Ryan's 12-strikeout performance. 
But Ryan, who leads the majors with 38 strikeouts, is just one of many success stories on this rejuvenated Rangers ballclub. Pitchers Jamie Moyer and Bobby Witt are both 3-0 and have been major contributors on a pitching staff which boasts the lowest ERA in the American League.
