Senior captain Patrick O'Brien said the aftermath of Cyclone Sidr gives the competitors more motiva­tion. 
"[The cyclone] makes it even more important to kick the fundraising into high gear, and it's also something tangible that the boxers can focus on," O'Brien said.

Saint Mary's hosts siblings on campus 
Little Sibs Weekend features games, activities, as younger guests experience college life 
By NIKKI TAYLOR 
News Wrirer 
The Residence Hall Association (HHA) sponsored Little Sibs Weekend, an event in which Saint Mary's encouraged students to invite their younger siblings or relatives last weekend on the College's campus. 
"I like getting students and siblings involved because in college there isn't a lot of time," event co­chair Jill Swan said. "Also the siblings enjoy being col­lege students, and that's a big part of it." 
The event this year had a luau theme, centered on the idea that "Ohana means family" -one inspired by Swan's little sister. 

"Her second grade class­room had a luau," Swan said. "When I came home and told her that I was in charge of Little Sibs Weekend, which she had been to before, she told me it should be luau themed." 
RHA provided games and activities for students to participate in with siblings of all ages, including an ice cream social, a movie show­ing, games and karaoke.

Last November, the fierce winds of Cyclone Sidr slammed much of the already poverty-stricken Bangladesh, and beginning tonight approximately 185 young men are fighting back -in the boxing ring. 
Hunter Land, president of the Boxing Club, said Notre Dame's 78th annual Bengal Bouts tournament has even more meaning for its par­ticipants because the need for relief in Bangladesh is even greater this year.

Prof. examines Chinese protest 
Stanford's Andrew Walder shaws university impact in Cultural Revolution 
By CLAIRE REISING 

News Writer 
The story of China's Cultural Revolution was a "political fiasco" that had a deep impact on the coun­try's universities, Stanford sociology professor Andrew Walder said Friday at "The Beijing Bed Guard MovPment: China's Cultural Hevolution in Retrospect." 
"They didn't accomplish anything but destruction," he said. 
Walder, who wrote "Fractured Crusade: The Beijing Red Guard 
Movement," lectured about the student Red Guard movement at Chinese uni­versities between 1966 and 1968. Though the Red Guards supported Mao Zedong, factionalism arose among the movement. 
Instead of just purging government officials, Walder said, Mao original­ly sought the support of students and young work­ers to ensure that his poli­cies and legacy would con­tinue after his death. 
"There's a real logic to what he did," he said. "If he would simply use a purge to get rid of the top officials, he felt he would-n't have had a lasting impact on the country." 
One of the Red Guards functions was to target officials they deemed anti­revolutionary at "struggle sessions," in which the accused would be publicly humiliated and often phys­ically harmed. However, Walder said students dis­agreed about the. rebel­lion's aim and which peo­ple to target. 
In his research, Walder had expected to find that the factions originated from the students' social classes. However, he said

Haircuts aid cancer patients 

'Project Pink' helps Pantene charity 
By ELIZABETH KELLY 
NewsWrirer 
Students from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's lined up outside Mishawaka's Salon Nouveau Sunday to cut off their ponytails as part Pangborn Hall's annual Project Pink. 
Event coordinator Tricia Hughes described Project Pink as "a campaign to raise awareness about women's issues and celebrate women in society." 
Project Pink will donate the ponytails they collected yesterday to Pantene Beautiful Lengths, a charity organization that turns donated ponytails into wigs for women with cancer who have lost their hair as a result of chemotherapy. 
The Project Pink commit­tee selected this charity last March because it fit with the event's theme of women in solidarity, said Hughes. But not enough girls had hair long enough to meet Pantene's requirement of eight inches. 
"Last year we put up signs all over Pangborn that said 'Don't cut your hair!"' Hughes said. 
Through advertising, the Project Pink committee was able to convince 25 students

ND students, alumni assess third-vvorld health 
By BILL BRINK News Writer 
During a human develop­ment symposium Saturda¥. Notre Dame students and alumni said a lack of resources and knowledge are inhibiting health improve­ments both in America and third-world countries. 
The Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the Ford Family Program in Human Development Studies and Solidarity, and the Center for Social Concerns co-hosted the event, "Solidarity in Pursuit of Authentic Human Development," which took place in the Hesburgh Center for International Studies. 
The effectiveness of tradi­tional medicine in third-world countries took center stage in the presentations. Sophomore Jeff Lakusta drew from his experiences in South Africa last summer researching the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 
"There is $230 billion in aid from the top 40 donors alone," he said. "The obvious question is how can $230 bil­lioq not provide us more sig­nificant results?"

Pollee bust snowmobile chop shop 
BANGOR TOWNSHIP, Mich. -The determination of an angry snowmobile owner -plus miles and miles of tracks in the snow­have led police to a suspect­ed chop shop for stolen snowmobiles. 
Police say the man discov­ered Saturday that his snow­mobile was missing from his home in Van Buren County's Arlington Township in south­west Michigan. 
The man, whose name was not released, called police and set out on a borrowed snowmobile following tracks 
in the snow for about 10 miles through fields and along roads. 
Relatives and friends fol­lowed by car as he trailed the tracks to a home in Bangor Township. 
Marlins searching for new husky mascots 
MIAMI -The Florida Marlins are looking for some footloose fat men. The National League team is cre­ating an all-male, plus-size cheerleading squad to be dubbed the Manatees. Tryouts were scheduled for Sunday. 
The team hopes to recruit 
seven to 10 tubby men to dance, cheer and jiggle dur­ing Friday and Saturday home games this season. 
Real manatees, 1,200­pound mammals sometimes referred to as "sea cows," are not considered the most agile of creatures and often get caught in boat propellers. 
The Marlins want their Manatees to have the same dimensions, but to be decid­edly more agile. Men will be judged on how well they dance a choreographed rou­tine.

Bush presses for intel bill 
President criticizes Democrats for blocking legislation renewal 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -House Democratic leaders came under criticism Saturday from President Bush who said they are blocking intelligence leg­islation so lawyers can sue telephone companies for help­ing the government eavesdrop on suspected terrorists. 
Terrorists are plotting attacks "at this very moment," Bush said in his weekly radio address. He again urged the House to

retroactive protection for telecommunications com­panies that wiretapped U.S. phone and computer lines at the government's request, but without the permission of a secret court created 30 years ago to oversee such activities. The House version does not provide such immunity against lawsuits. 
The Justice Department and Office of National Intelligence said Saturday that telecom­munication companies are now complying with existing surveillance warrants. The agencies' statement reversed their declaration late Friday that some companies had refused to initiate wiretaps against people covered by orders issued under the expired law. 
The statement said new surveillance activities under existing warrants will resume "for now," but that the delay "impaired our ability to

Congress does not pass a law with retroac­tive immunity. 
National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell pre­dicted last week that the gov­ernment's surveillance of ter­rorists would be harmed if the law were allowed to expire. l-Ie and Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that prediction had come true. 
Later Friday, the companies -whom administration offi­cials refused to name ­reversed their opposition to expanding existing orders to cover new surveillance activi­ties. 
The law expired after Congress left on a 10-day recess before reconciling the House and Senate versions of its replacement. 
"When Congress reconvenes on Monday, members of the House have a choice to make: They can empower the trial bar, or they can empower the intelligence community," Bush said in his Saturday radio address. "They can help class-action trial lawyers sue for billions of dollars, or they can help our intelligence offi­cials protect millions of lives." 
Bush has promised to veto any bill that does not protect the companies from suits that allege violations of privacy and wiretapping laws under the warrantless wiretapping program. 
"It is unfair and unjust to threaten these companies with financial ruin only because they are believed to have done the right thing and helped their country," the president said. 
"House leaders are blocking this legislation, and the rea­son can be summed up in three words: class-action law­suits."

N.Y. Philhannonic to visit North Korea 
BEIJING -North Korea was tearing down anti-American posters that line the streets of Pyongyang in preparation for the New York Philharmonic's unprecedented visit, the ensemble's president said Sunday on the eve of departure. 
The musieians said they hoped personal contacts with North Koreans could help bring the countries closer. But some also worried their performance Tuesday wouldn't change anything, and instead be misused for propaganda in the communist country that technically remains at war with the U.S. 
The Philharmonic's president and execu­tive director, Zarin Mehta, said North Korea had met the group's requests that the largest possible audience hear the concert. The per­formance will be staged in a larger hall and will be broadcast live on radio and TV.

Housing crisis still on agenda 
Congress to examzne additional remedies for consumers, investors 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON Congress is set to examine another round of possible repairs for consumers and investors threatened by widening cracks in the housing market. 
Proposals include easing bankruptcy rules, shielding banks from lawsuits and providing government assis­tance to homeowners facing foreclosure. 
Lawmakers also plan this week to question several high-profile mortgage and banking executives about industrywide losses and lav­ish executive-compensation packages. 
The housing proposals percolating on Capitol Hill, many of them designed by Democrats, are expected to face much tougher resist­ance than the recently approved economic stimu­lus package, which touched on the mortgage crisis in a limited way. 
Some of these proposals have been kicked around in one form or another for months. Others are consid­ered attempts to address perceived shortcomings in the Bush administration plan to freeze interest rates on a small percentage of loans made to high-risk borrowers. economy recover, help many more borrowers in allowance for states to issue

McDonald's redesigns using feng shui 
Associated Press 

HACIENDA HEIGHTS, Calif -The only familiar signs at the McDonald's in this large Asian community are the golden arches, the drive-through and the menu. 
Gone are the plastic furniture, Ronald McDonald and the red and yellow palette that has defined the world's largest hamburger chain. Leather seats, earth tones, bamboo plants and water trickling down glass panels have taken their place. 
The makeover elements are meant to help diners achieve happiness and fortune -whether they realize it or not. 
That's because the restaurant was redesigned using the principles of feng shui, the ancient Chinese prac­tice of arranging objects and num­bers to promote health, harmony and prosperity. 
The concept is an unlikely fit with fast food. But the restaurant's own­ers say the designs are aimed at cre­ating a soothing setting that will encourage diners to linger over their burgers and fries, and come back again. 
The makeover is part of the attempt by McDonald's Corp. in recent years to remodel hundreds of its restaurants to attract more patrons with unique decor and amenities that might entice them stay awhile. 
It also fits into McDonald's larger corporate practice of catering to local tastes, such as a fondue-style burger in France or a pita-wrapped "McArabia" sandwich in the Middle East. 
"We can't look too cookie cutter," Mark Brownstein, one of three own­ers of the restaurant, said about the new decor. 
The basic principles of feng shui include placing strategic representa­tions of five natural elements ­earth, water, fire, metal and wood­around the room to increase the flow of chi, or energy. 
Feng shui (pronounced fung shway) has been employed in the designs of high-rises, banks, even zoo exhibits, and has been popular­ized by ·countless coffee table books and TV shows such as HGTV's "Fun Simi." It's also used in the designs of the Panda Express Chinese food chain. 
The McDonald's in this Los Angeles suburb boasts wood ceiling, silver­coated chairs, plus red accents throughout the dining area to sym­bolize fire and "good luck, laughter and prosperity," said Brenda Clifford, who designed the dining area. 
The textured walls patterned after ocean waves symbolize "life and relaxation -the balanced things that you want in your life," she said. 
Customers are responding positive­ly, whether or not they recognize the feng shui elements.

Associated Pn:ss 
DEKALB, Ill. -With many wearing ribbons in the school colors of black and red, commu­nity members and loved ones prepared Sunday to participate in a memorial for five Northern Illinois University students killed when a gunman opened fire inside a classroom. 
Five bouquets of red and white flowers were placed on the stage of the Convocation Center to commemorate those shot in the Valentine's Day attack. Outside the arena, sehool ollieials posted a banner reading, "Forward, together forward." 
Memorial organizers said they expeeted thousands of people to attend, and overflow viewing areas were set up around the campus, about 65 miles west of Chieago. The memorial was also to be simulcast to NIU gather­ings across the eountry and in Iraq. 
"Bning together will help a lot, everybody in one place and being able to support eaeh other," said Jennifer llartleben, a 21-year-old business student who was waiting in line to enter the Convocation Center. 
Classes are to be held Monday for the first time since the shoot­ing, in which NIU graduate Steve Kazmierczak opened lire in a crowded ledurn hall. killing five people and injuring 17 before committing suicide. 
Another member of the crowd waiting to enter the Convoeation Center was Melissa Johnsen, who graduated from NIU in 2007. 
"I find it important to pay my respects," she said. "I think this will always be a part of NIU now, but hopefully something we can learn from." 
Among those scheduled to speak during the memorial serv­ice were NIU President John G. Peters, Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat. Illinois' other senator, Democratic presidential candi­date Barack Obama, planned to attend, but his campaign staff said he would not make any remarks. 
The school asked faculty and staff members to return last week for training in how to help students adjust to the changed atmosphere at NIU, which enrolls about 25,000 students. 
In addition to about 550 coun­selors expected to staff each classroom, academic depart­ment and dormitory, the student counseling center is extending its hours indefinitely.

Japanese businessman arrestedinwife's111urder 
Associated Pn:ss 
LOS ANGELES -A Japanese businessman's surprise arrest in his wif'e's killing in a Southern California parking lot a quarter-eentury ago dominat­ed f'ront pages in Tokyo on Sunday as authorities worked 
to  bring  him  baek  to  Los  
Angeles.  
Kazuyoshi  Miura  was  

detained latn Friday in Saipan, a U.S. eommonwealth in the Pacific, and was being held on suspicion of the murder of his wif'e. The crime caused an international uproar, in part because he blam(~d the 1981 attack on robbers, reinforcing Japanesp, pnrceptions of America as a violent country. 
Miura. 60, had already been convicted in Japan in 1994 of the murder of his wife, Kazumi Miura, but that vP.rdict was overturnP.d by the country's high courts I 0 years ago. 
"Why now'?" the Mainichi newspaper asked in a headline. "llis turbulent life entered a new phase." 
The LAPD said Miura was awaiting extradition. The department did not provide fur­ther details, and it wasn't dear what led to the latest arrest. 
"I think U.S. investigators have all along believed that they can make the case with the evidence they had already col­lected," Tsutornu Sakaguchi, a f'orrnnr Tokyo Metropolitan Police investigator at the time of' tlw shooting, told TV Asahi in an intnrview Sunday. "If they have a new (Widnnce, that could hn a dndsivn stnp." 
Miura, a elothing inrporter, and his 2H-ynar-old wife wern visiting Los Angeles on Nov. 18, 1981, when they were shot in a downtown parking lot. She was shot in the head, went into a coma and died the following year in Japan. 
ller mother said Sunday that she never gave up hope of a resolution to the case. 
"I burned incense for my daughter and prayed at a fami­ly Buddhist altar, telling her that Americans will put an end to thP. case, so let's hold onto our hopes and wait," Yasuko Sasaki told Japan's public broadcaster NHK. 
Daryl Gates, who was police chief at the time of the killing, said Saturday that Miura was a kP.y suspm~t even then. 
"I remember the case well. I think he killed his wife," Gates said. "We had Japanese police come over; they believed he was guilty, we believed he was guilty, but we eouldn't prove it." 
Miura was arrested in Japan in 1985 on suspicion of' assault­ing his wife with intent to kill her for insurance money in the hotel incident. He was convict­ed of attempted murder and while serving a six-year sen­tence was charged under Japanp,sc law in 1988 with his wife's murder. 
Miura was convicted of that charge in 1994 and sentenced to life in prison. Four years later, however, a Japanese high court overturned the sentence, throwing out a lower court's determination that Miura con­spired with a friend in Los Angelns to kill his wife. 
Miura's attorney, Juniehiro llironaka. told Japan's Fuji TV late Saturday that the latest arrest astonished him.

Kosovo 



Serbs protest Kosovo's split 
Russia criticizes countries that recognized nation's independence 
Associated Press 
PRISTINA, Kosovo -Kosovo marked its first week of inde­pendence in quiet celebration Sunday, as angry Serbs protest­ed in the f'ledgling nation's tense north and in capitals across Europe. 
The Russian envoy to NATO, meanwhile, unleashed a torrent of criticism on countries that recognized Kosovo's split from ally Serbia, including the UnitPd StatPs. 
Up to 1,000 people protested peacefully in the ethnically divided northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica. Protesters at the demonstration -the smallest in seven days of rallies -listened to a Serbian rock band playing on a stage deco­rated with a poster of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a sign reading: "Russia Help!" 
Russia has staunchly support­ed Serbia's resistance and has declared Kosovo's independ­ence illegal. Putin's likely suc­cessor -First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedyev ­planned to visit the Serbian capital Belgrade on Monday. 
The past two days of muted 
protests in Kosovska Mitrovica 
followed Thursday's rioting in 
Belgrade, where demonstrators 
stormed the U.S. Embassy and 
set part of it ablaze. 
The U.S. ambassador in 
Belgrade demanded Serb lead­
ers ensure there would be no 
future violence against diplo­
matic missions. 'Tm very angry 
at what happened. It had better 
not happen again," 
Ambassador Cameron Munter told The Associated Press Sunday. 
Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo remained jubilant with their new status. 
"People keep celebrating every night," Artan Dedushaj said. "This is something that all Albanians have waited cen­turies for -and changes will come soon." 
In the capital, Pristina, people gathered around a graffiti-cov­ered sculpture of letters spelling out "NEWBORN." One person had scribbled in English: "We love you Kosovo!" 
The vast majority of Kosovo's population is ethnic Albanian. Serbs represent just 10 percent of the region's 2 million people, but they view Kosovo as the cradle of their culture and of their Orthodox Christian faith. 
The territory had remained a part of Serbia even though it has been administered by the 
U.N. and NATO since 1999, when NATO airstrikes ended former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists, which killed 10,000 people. 
Thousands of Serbs held demonstrations in European capitals Sunday. 
In Vienna, Austria, more than 5,000 protesters waved pro­Serbia banners, and a few burned, spit or stomped on American flags. Later, demon­strators across the city smashed bottles and the win­dows of a cafe. Two police offi­cers were injured and four peo­ple were arrested, officials said. 

In Geneva, up to 4,000 people gathered peacefully outside 
U.N. offices, and in Brussels, several hundred Serbs chanted "Kosovo is Serbia" outside EU offices. 
Russia's ambassador to NATO said Sunday that Kosovo's inde­pendence bid was a result of an imperialistic American effort to "divide and rule," which would lead to Russia's boosting its mil­itary to ensure its own security. 
"We are faced here with pow­erful hegemonism, imperialism on the part of the United States," Dmitry Rogozin said on Russia's state-run Vesti-24 tele­vision. 
Western nations that recog­nize Kosovo's statehood were replacing international law with a system in which "there will be only one rule: he who has brute physical power is strong and is right," he said. 
Russia will not go to arms over Kosovo, but instead will "use to the maximum our politi­cal and moral authority," he said. 
Serbia's nationalist prime minister, Vojislav Kostunica, called on the U.S. to revoke its decision to recognize "the fake state of Kosovo" and allow the 
U.N. Security Council to "reaf­firm" Kosovo as part of Serbian territory. 
Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci visited the grave of the late pacifist President Ibrahim Rugova -revered among ethnic Albanians for his drive for statehood -and reached out anew to Kosovo's Serb minority.

Helicopter crashes in cross-border operation 
Associated Press 
CUKURCA, Turkey -A Turkish helicopter crashed in Iraq and eight soldiers were killed during a cross-border ground operation against Kurdish rebels, who planted booby traps on the bodies of their slain comrades, Turkey's military said Sunday. 
The guerrillas said they shot down a Turkish military helicopter near the Turkish­Iraqi border. 
Turkey's military said tech­nicians were inspecting the wreck to determine why the helicopter crashed near the border. It was not clear if any of the reported troop casual­ties were on board. Their deaths bring the Turkish toll since the start of the incur­sion Thursday to 15, the mili­tary said on its Web site. 
Thirty-three rebels were killed in Sunday's fighting, bringing the rebel death toll since Thursday to 112, according to the armed forces. 
The incursion is the first confirmed Turkish military ground operation in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. 
The rebels of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, are fighting for autonomy in pre­dominantly Kurdish south­eastern Turkey and have car­ried out attacks on Turkish targets from bases in the semiautonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq. The conflict started in 1984 and has claimed as many as 40,000 lives. 
Turkey has assured that the operation would be limited to attacks on rebels. The United States and European Union consider the PKK a terrorist group. 
"It is only an operation geared to cleansing the ter­rorist camps," Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said Sunday in an address to the youth branch of his ruling party. "Our Iraqi brothers, friends and civilians should know that they will never be targeted by the armed forces." 
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Sunday while visiting Australia that it would take a broader approach to erode PKK sup­port in northern Iraq. 
"After a certain point peo­ple become inured to military attacks," he said, "and if you don't blend them with these kinds of nonmilitary initia­tives, then at a certain point the military efforts become less and less effective." 
Massoud Barzani, head of the regional Kurdish adminis­tration in northern Iraq, warned Turkey would face large-scale resistance if it tar­geted civilians in its incur­sion. 
The Iraqi government said Saturday fewer than 1,000 Turkish troops had crossed the frontier. Turkish media reports put the number in the thousands.

Virgin Atlantic flies first biofuel aircraft 
Associated Press 
LONDON Virgin Atlantic carried out the world's first flight of a com­mercial aircraft powered with biofuel on Sunday in an effort to show it can pro­duce less carbon dioxide than normal jet fuels. 
Some analysts praised the jumbo jet test flight from London to Amsterdam as a potentially useful experi­ment. But others criticized it as a publicity stunt and noted scientists are ques­tioning the environmental benefits of biofuels. 
"This breakthrough will help Virgin Atlantic to fly its planes using clean fuel sooner than expected," Sir Richard Branson, the air­line's president, said before the Boeing 747 flew from London's Heathrow Airport to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. 
He said the flight would provide "crucial knowledge that we can use to dramati­cally reduce our carbon footprint," he said. 
Sunday's flight was par­tially fueled with a biofuel mixture of coconut and babassu oil in one of its four 
main fuel tanks. The jet car­ried pilots and several tech­nicians. but no passengers. 
Virgin Atlantic spokesman Paul Charles predicted this biofuel would produce much less C02 than regular jet fuel, but said it will take weeks to analyze the data from Sunday's flight. 
"It's great that somebody like Richard is willing to put some of his billions into an experiment aimed at reduc­ing the climate change impact of aviation," said James Halstead, an airline analyst at the London stock­
broker  Dawnay  Day  
Lochart.  
"But there  are  a  lot of  

unanswered questions about the usefulness of biofuels in the battle against global warming," he said. 
The flight is the latest example of how the world's airlines are jumping on the environmental bandwagon by trying to find ways of reducing aviation's carbon footprint. 
These efforts have includ­ed finding alternative jet fuels, developing engines that burn existing fuels more slowly, and changing the way planes land.

No subject left behind 
Most people reading this, I assume, remember the college admissions process: Trying to write the perfect admissions essay, getting your teachnr ovaluations, worrying about your score on the PSAT, SAT, 
Darryl
ACT, SAT II, AP. IB ... basically jumping Campbell through one academ­ic hoop after another. Speak Up, This parade of stan­Please dardized tests and statistics is moro or less high school in miniature -an attompt to assess aea­dmnic pnrformance, which is a euphe­mism for "learning not to make mis­takes." By the time we start thinking boyond high school, we've had it drilled into our heads that the worst thing in the world is to make a mis­take. Mistakes haVl~ dire consequences in high school: Missed points on tosts, bad grados, parent-toacher confer­ences and. ultimately, not getting into tho right college. 
But thnre's something profoundly dissatisfying about trying to boil some­one's intellectual capacity into a mean­ingful statistic, which is what these multi-hour standardized tests suppos­edly do. Grantod, they show whetht~r or not someone has mastered a basic skill set and on some level the mere fact that someone is taking them is a sign of motivation. But I defy anyone to honestly tell me that after they finished taking the SA'I's, they felt like the test had been a thorough and adequate assessment of their intellectual capaci­ty. 
And yet these tests shape the way secondary education takes place. Because they are supposed to be objec­tive, each subject gets boiled down to whatever parts can be assessed quan­titatively. It's not a problem for disci­plines like math, chemistry or physics, where half the battle is knowing and applying the right formula, theorem or procedure. Humanities and social sci­ences, however, aren't as skills-based or procedural. Knowing the facts is simply a starting point that allows peo­ple to take part in the informed debate that is really the heart of any humani­ties discipline, and can't really be test­ed via scantron. But because people have to teach to these tests, and because students' enduring memory of history or English as a subject eomes from how they are assessed, their view of humanities disciplines is distorted. No wonder some people think history is just a chronological assortment of trivia. And you can forget about the arts; self-expression and aesthetics are some of the least objective things imaginable. 
Funnily enough, the currieula of most secondary schools prioritize math and science first, followed by the humanities and social sciences and the arts last. These subjects get money and elassroom time in that order; as a result, history, English and philosophy sometimes get lumped into catch-all "Humanities" classes, and the arts mom often than not are demoted to extracurriculars if they even exist in· the first place. If someone becomes really passionate about music, English or history, not only do they get a dis­torted view or how each discipline really works, but they also learn that those subjects are really not consid­ered important, which is why they're underfunded or missing entirely from their school. These sorts of administra­tive decisions further reinforce the perception of high school graduates that the only two worthwhile activities are being objective and not making mistakes. 
Objectivity and correctness aren't 
bad, of course, but to make them the whole of the educational experience leaves high school graduates unpre­pared for the real world, which is not black and white or always rational. There is more than one way to be cor­rect, and not everyone elaiming to be objective really is. but without the abil­ity to think criti<:ally, wn wouldn't bn able to ligurn out who is and who isn't. Unfortunately, dcvPioping analytical thought and the creative impulse is hard to do and hard to measure, but most of all, it means that people need to be free to approach problems their own way. Even more anathema to the current practice of education, then~ is no guarantee that everyone will arrive at the same answer. The humanities and social scienees-whieh are essen­tially debatns about the real world ­are the subjects where students learn these skills; they deserve not to be demoted to second plac.n in the ed uca­tional hierarchy. 
Pundits, politicians and teaehnrs alike are as worril~d about the short­comings of education and a growing sense of anti-intellectualism as ever, but they are trying to solve the defi­ciencies in teaching creativn and ana­lytical thinking by placing thnir faith in further tests and rubrics. Ironically, they are guilty of the same failure of imagination that they thmnselves are cultivating, and sacrificing more young minds on the twin altars of objectivity and correctness is not going to change the downward spiral of the American educational system.

The ladies' man 
On Feb. 5, Kimberle Crenshaw and Notre Dame favorite Eve Ensler pub­lished an important article on The Huf!ington Post, using the feminist mantra "Not in Our Name" to condemn "feminist ultima­tums." They were Andrea referring to the con­Laidman troversial idea plaguing many High Sounding women during this Words primary season: Vote for Hillary Clinton or compromise your feminist principles; endorse the first viable woman candidate for the White House, or face the fact that you've given in to the underlying misogyny in society and the media. 
Young female supporters of Barack Obama are criticized by the feminist hardliners promoting this view (called "either/or feminists" by Crenshaw and Ensler) for forgetting the struggle of their feminist predecessors. Even worse, they are written off as victims of naivete -swept into the Obama camp by an internal desire to win the approval and protection of men. 
But an increasing number of ftJminist authors and female political commen­tators-as well as the voters them­selves -point out that a vote for Obama is a vote for the more feminine campaign. In terms of management, campaign style and even policy, Obama strikes these women as more inclusive and more prone to discussion and dia­logue than Clinton. 
In early February, more than 100 New York feminist leaders joined in releasing a statement that endorsed Obama and criticized Hillary's record and current approach. For these women, Clinton's early support for the war in Iraq was the leading cause of their disillusionment. 
Ruth Rosen, a member of the women's movement from the 1960s onward and a signee of the "Feminists for Obama" statement (along with 1 ,000 other feminist leaders) recently wrote, "There is nothing I'd rather do than vote for the first female presiden­tial candidate." But Rosen cites her own roots in the civil rights and anti­war movements of the 1960s as evi­dence that her endorsement of Obama is consistent with her long-term per­sonal commitments. 
This is a common explanation of fem­inist activists and scholars when accounting for their vote for Barack: Feminism is inclusive and stresses equality for all; feminism demands that the best candidate for not only women but also for the poor and for minorities is chosen. These concerns,<write women who maintain that feminism evolves with the issues of the day, must be weighed with as much passion as the desire to elect a female president. 
In her Feb. 24 piece, ";,Quien Es Less Macho?" New York Times op-ed colum­nist Maureen Dowd asserts a paradox of Clinton's campaign: "The first seri­ous female candidate for president was rejected by voters drawn to the more feminine management style of her male rival." 
Dowd argues that the last 16 years in Washington-divisive Congress-White House relations followed by a belliger­ent president and a war-without-end ­have seeded a desire not only for peace 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Racism still present 
Some of you reading this right now might be thinking that we're not apa­thetic or ignorant of the socioeconomic issues on campus because this is Notre Dame, and for the most part, we all get along. And on the surface, yes, we do. We live side-by-side, play on the field together and sit in classes next to each other. So racism isn't a problem any­more? Others might agree that perhaps it does linger, not so much in the form of violence, but in more subtle ways: A joke, a careless remark, a misguided assumption. What I learned today from our conversation is that racism is not only still present here at Notre Dame­it never really left. 
Did you know that this Saturday Wabruda, the campus organization of African-American males. hosted Notre Dame's first Black History conference? I was invited to take part by the presi­dent, senior William David Williams, who sought outside support from Sustained Dialogue, a group I am part of. Sustained Dialogue is devoted to con­versation regarding diversity-related issues both at Notre Dame and beyond. At the conference, I was to help lead a small group discussion. However, there was a surplus of group leaders, and instead I ended up talking for an hour with a fellow SD member, senior Casey Bouskill, as well as with William David and Wabruda's vice president, senior Roosevelt Kelley. 
I stood there and heard, for the first time, accounts of racist acts occurring in dorms. I also heard accounts of assumptions based on race made every­where from the classroom to the dining hall (he's black and a male, ergo he is a football player -"Great job out there this weekend!"-and an African­American male student who is not a football player is wondering why his efforts on the field were just congratu­lated). I learned how apathy toward challenging these stereotypes plagues our community. I hear the accounts of these young men who just got used to it and how they are forced into a terrible catch-22: Either ignore incidents of ignorance (because what's the point?), or take action and potentially perpetu­ate the stereotype of "the angry black man." 
I'm not militant and I'm not accusing anyone of anything I won't admit to myself. But I am heartbroken. There has to be some middle ground between passive and hostile responses to racist and elitist remarks and actions. Wabruda's advisor, G. David Moss from Student Affairs, offered some insight into how to best effect change in a posi­tive and meaningful way. He urges all of us to not let fear limit what we do. It is only through challenging ourselves that change occurs. We could start with acknowledging the problem and talking about it. Then move to action, which could be as simple as reaching out to the various communities on campus. One way to do this is to attend the vari­ous events hosted by groups celebrating their heritages. You did not need to be black or male to attend the Black History conference, in the same way that one does not need to be Asian to go to Asian Allure, or Latin to participate in Latin Expressions. It's about chal­lenging assumptions, stereotypes and apathy. 
When we say, "Oh well, that's just the way it is," we're making excuses instead of improvements. Let us dare not to be resigned. Let us dare to face our fears. Let us dare to try something new.

but for inclusivity and empathy, "a less autocratic leadership style." 
Dowd writes, "Hillary was so busy trying to prove she could be one of the boys -getting on the Armed Services Committee, voting to let W. go to war in Iraq, strong-arming supporters and donors and trying to out-macho Obama -that she only belatedly realized that many Democratic and independent vot­ers, especially women, were eager to move from hard-power locker-room tactics to a soft-power sewing circle approach." 
The ultimate irony, and perhaps unfair reality, is that Hillary Clinton worked throughout her "35 years of experience" to dispel the nurturing yet incapable image of woman, and with great success. She re-defined the role of First Lady and took on policy chal­lenges and substantive issues in a man­ner -however criticized -that was not seen before or since. 
The tragedy for Clinton is that this may be the first time in political history when a woman need not "man up" to get ahead. The voters of the last 11 democratic primaries prove that the nation is indeed hungry for change and a new style of leadership. 
No one reflects this shifting mindset more than the "Feminists for Obama," who would elect a man over a woman because of his personal and political record, his alternative experiences, his efforts and success in building a truly grassroots campaign -approaching one million donors nationwide -and his broad appeal among voters young and old. Obama epitomizes the coali­tion-for-change-and-equality which feminists have sought for decades. 
There is no doubt that this democrat­ic primary race is a historic one;mark­ing the first real chance to have a woman or African-American lead the nation. 
The stakes are also high for femi­nism. 
As Ensler and Crenshaw assert: "At issue is a profound difference in seeing feminism as intersectional and global rather than essentialist and insular. Women have grappled with these ques­tions in every feminist wave, struggling to see feminism as something other than a 'me too' bid for power whether it be in the family, the party, the race or the state." 
This is the real challenge facing women in the democratic presidential primary: To choose their candidate based on values, policies, leadership style and political record -and not based on gender alone. As long as these basic tenets of fairness are observed, feminism will only benefit from such a public and earnest effort to discern what is best for America during the 2008 bid for the White House.

Time to update National Anthem 
When I hear the word "America," a few things come to mind. One is apple pie. Others include freedom, hot dogs, John Wayne, baseball, Journey and what is possibly the greatest song ever written since Beethoven penned his ninth symphony (and probably greater than that too): Don't Stop Believin'. 
When I think of America, a few things don't come to mind. One is sushi. Another is ramparts. I'm not even sure what a rampart is. In fact, I don't think anyone actually knows what a rampart is. However, everyone knows what streetlights, people, city boys, small town girls and ·midnight trains are. Why, then, does our National Anthem mention ramparts while omitting streetlights and midnight trains? 
"The Star Spangled Banner" was written by Francis Scott Key 194 years ago, and while it may have been awesome enough to be our national anthem then, today it is hopelessly outdated. No one even knows its last three verses. It no longer captures the essence of the contemporary American spirit, and as such, it ought to be replaced by a song that reflects the passions of our great riation and is known and loved by the entire coun­try. I have seen Olympic athletes cry when they stand atop the podium, have a gold medal placed around their neck, and hear "The Star Spangled Banner" played in their honor. While some would say that these tears are inspired by feelings of immense joy and patriotism, I cannot help but believe that they are crying because our National Anthem is so bad. Have you ever seen people sing along to the National Anthem with any hint of enthusiasm? Most people I know don't even sing the words, but just wait impatiently until the song is over so that whatever sporting event they are about to watch can finally begin. 
On the other hand, I have seen people climb atop tables in order to sing Don't Stop Believin'. I have seen incredible displays of air-guitar virtuoso to the tune of the song, and I have seen complete strangers become best friends, if only for a moment, as they together shout the chorus of Journey's magnum opus. America deserves a song like this. 
While I know that our national anthem is unlikely to be changed anytime soon due to our culture's unfortunate aversion to change, that will not deter my efforts to give Journey's timeless anthem the place it rightly deserves in American culture. I have a dream that someday I will find myself at a baseball game. I have a dream that before the first pitch, I will hear a voice say, "Please rise for the National Anthem." And I have a dream that, accompanied by pyrotechnics and a low-flying jet, I will hear Journey. But until that day, my friends, don't stop believin', hold on to that feelin'.

Badgers 58, Buckeyes 53 
They'll seldom win a slam­dunk contest or get featured on a SportsCenter highlight. Heck, most of them don't look like they could touch the rim. 
About all that's impressive about the Wisconsin Badgers is how hard they play, particularly on that unglamorous half of the game known as defense. 
Jason Bohannon came off the bench to score 16 points and thn Badgers (No. 10 ESPNIUSA Today, No.11 AP) relied on their gritty defense to hold off Ohio State on Sunday. 
"We played some great defense, nspeeially down the stretch when they were trying to get the !tying! 3-pointer," Bohannon said. "They didn't really get a clean look at the hoop." 
The Buckeyes didn't score over the last 3:15 and had only one field goal in thn final R 1/2 minutes. For much of that time, they were within a shot of catching the Badgers. But the Badgers weren't having any of that. 
Part of that was due to the young Buckeyes' shot selection, but most of it was Wisconsin's physical, stilling defense, which allows just 55.4 points a game, sncond best in the nation. 
"On defense, they locked up and we locked up," Wisconsin's Brian Butch said. "It was a typi­cal Big Ten finish. We just hap­pened to make a few more plays on the defensive end. It's not like we made a lot of plays on the offensive end, but it was plays at the defensive end that won that game for us." 
The victory kept the Badgers (23-4, 13-2) tied with Purdue and Indiana for the Big Ten lead heading into the final two weeks of play. 
Wisconsin used a late 9-0 run to take the lead and then put the clamps on Ohio State ( 17­10, 8-6). 
Musketeers 57, Flyers 51 
Drew Lavender was back to working full time Sunday, and Xavier (No. 12 ESPN/USA Today, No. 10 AP) neednd every minute he could muster. 
Lavender made four free throws in the final 35 seconds and Xavier beat Dayton. 
After being limitnd to just 14 minutes in Xavier's win over Duquesne on Thursday because of a sprained left ankle, Lavender returned at point guard and played 33 minutns Sunday. 
It was the Musketeers' 10th straight win and assured them of at least a share of the Atlantie 10 championship. 
"I gave Drew full credit for playing while being hurt," Xavier coach Sean Miller said. "Drew could have said 'I'm tak­ing a couple of games off'. but he didn't. He really stepped up and set the tone for us." 
Josh Duncan scored 14 points, and Lavender finished with nine for Xavier (24-4, 12-1 Atlantic 1 0). 
"What makes our team spn­cial is that we have great bal­ance and a bunch of players who can score," Miller said. 
Brian Hoberts led Dayton (17­9, 5-8) with 15 points. 
Nobody else reached double figures, although Xavier went into the game with six players averaging 10 or more. 
"They are a solid defensive team and they made it tough to get some shots," Hoberts said. "We fought, we played hard and it was a battle throughout the whole game. They just came out on top." 
Dayton tied the score five times in the first nine minutes but never led. The Flyers were 12-of-24 from the field in the first half and trailed 29-27 at halrti nw. 
Dayton stayed dose until a free throw by Duncan, a basket by Dante Jackson and a pair of free throws by Jason Love gavn Xavier its biggest lead of thn game, 41-31 with 12:44 to play. 
"We did a lot of things today that we would have liked, it just was not enough," Dayton eoach Brian Gregory said. "We wern playing a high-quality team 
· wlw has won fWery elosn game they've played in and you have to makn certain plays down the stretch in the last live minutes. 
"We wanted to be within striking distance within the last live minutes and we were. They made a couple of big plays and had a couple of offensive rebounds. When you play a team like Xavim, the margin for error is much smaller."

Associated Press 

MARANA, Ariz.-Not even the most unpre­dictable tournament in golf could keep Tiger Woods from an inevitable victory. 
There seems to be no stopping him. 
Stewart Cink barely put up a fight Sunday in the Accenture Match Play Championship, where Woods broke a scoring record for the fourth straight tournament, col­lected his fifth straight victory worldwide and didn't so much as crack a smile when someone asked him if a perfect sea­son was within reach. 
"That's my intent," he said. "That's why you play. It you don't believe you can win an event, don't show up." 
Relentless as ever, Woods made 14 birdies in 29 holes in the high desert of Dove Mountain to over­whelm Stewart Cink for an 8-and-7 victory, the largest margin in the final match in the 10-year his­tory of his fickle event. 
Woods captured his 15th World Golf' Championship, holding all three world title for the first time. 
And his 63rd career vic­tory moved him past Arnold Palmer and into fourth place alone on the PGA Tour's career list. His next victory will tie him with Ben Hogan. 
Golf is not a fair fight at the moment. 
"I think maybe we ought to slice him open to see what's inside," Cink said. "Maybe nuts and bolts." 
Cink was only the latest victim in a winning streak that dates to Sept. 3, 2007, a date worth remembering. 
Woods won the BMW Championship the follow­ing week at 262, breaking the tournament scoring record by five shots. lie won the Tour Championship by a record eight shots, and the Buick Invitational by the same margin, another tourna­ment record. 
This is the third time Woods has won at least four straight PGA Tour events. He also won in Dubai three weeks ago on the European tour by coming back from a four­shot deficit. 
"I think this is the best stretch I've ever played," Woods said. 
He has won six of his last seven PGA Tour events, 16 of his last 30 over the last two years. 
The confidence in his game is so high that Woods started this season by saying the Grand Slam was "easily within rea­son." 
IN BRIEF 

Cubs' DeRosa released from hospital, to see cardiologist 
MESA, Ariz. -Chicago Cubs second baseman Mark DeRosa was released from the hospital Sunday evening, the team said, one day after complaining of a rapid heartbeat during fielding drills. 
Cubs spokesman Peter Chase announced DeRosa's release shortly after 5 p.m. Sunday. The team initially said DeRosa was released Saturday evening, but later said he was kept overnight at Banner Desert Medical Center in Mesa as a precaution. 
DeRosa is expected to be exam· ined by a cardiologist Monday and could be back on the field by the middle of the week, the Cubs said. 
His irregular heartbeat was not life-threatening, according to the team. A woman who answered the phone at the hospital said she had no information about DeHosa. 
Sharapova wins Qatar, remains unbeaten on season 
DOHA, Qatar Maria Sharapova defeated Vera Zvonareva 6-1, 2-6, 6-0 Sunday in the Qatar Open final, remaining unbeaten this season and earning her 18th career title. 
The Australian Open cham­pion is 14-0, including two wins in the Fed Cup for Russia this year. Sharapova is 9-0 in Doha, where she won in 2005. 
"I played five matches in five days and that is not an easy thing to do," Sharapova said. "I think what I have done is just great." 
Sharapova broke her oppo­nent t w i e e in the first set, but Zvonareva had two breaks of her own in the sec­ond before the fifth-ranked Hussian swept the third 
Phillies' Lidge to have knee surgery, could miss opener 
CLEARWATER, Fla. -Phillies closer Brad Lidge is scheduled to have arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Monday and could miss the regular-season opener. 
Lidge, Philadelphia's biggest offseason acquisition, limped off the field Saturday after injuring his knee when he caught a spike in the mound on his first pitch of batting practice. Doctors removed torn cartilage from the same knee in October. 
The 31-year-old right-hander was expected to return to Philadelphia on Sunday for sur­gery Monday that would sideline him for three to six weeks. The Phillies open the season at home March 31 against Washington. 
Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said setup man Tom Gordon would close if Lidge isn't ready for opening day.

Ten-year radio contract inked vvith ISP Sports 
By CHRIS KHOREY and KEN 
FOWLER 
Sports Writers 
Af'tnr nearly 40 ynars with Westwood Onn, Notre Damn ((lOt­ball will have a new radio broad­cast partrwr this fall. 
Associato athletic dimetor John lloisler said Friday Irish games will bP carried by ISP Sports for the noxt ten seasons. 
Wnstwood One had carried Notre I >ame li10tball since 1968. 
I hdsler said Notre Damn didn't seriously considnr a shortnr eon­tract ror its n1~w partnnr. saying the athldie departmnnt was "extn~rne ly com rortable" with ISP Sports and the 1 0-ynar deal. 
llnisler said that while it isn't dear how many and which sta­tions will carry Notre Dame games in various markets, he's hoping that most afliliatos rrom last season will continue to broadcast the Irish. 
"Ono or the questions will be, when you just look at the aflilia­tion aspect or it, I think tlwn1 would be a natural hope that a groat numbPr of the stations that havP carried our games would continue to do that," he said. 
lleisler also said he isn't sure who the announcing duo will be. Last season, Don Criqui and for­mnr Irish running back Allen Pinkett railed the games for the Westwood One broadeasting net­work. 
lleisler did say Notre Dame would have an "advisory role" in choosing the announeers. 
"That's a decision that will be made down the road by ISP. I think our intention was for our role to be similar to what it was in Westwood One," he said. 
ISP owns the broadcast rights for over 40 other schools, but lleisler said in a statement Friday that "Notre Dame remains the only college football program to have its games broadcast on a truly national radio network."

Irish salvage one winontrip 
Team beats Wake Forest, falls to North Carolina for 1-1 weekend 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Wri rer 
Following a tough loss to No. 8 Duke Thursday, No. 15 Notre Dame brought a 1-2 reeord back from its trip to Tobacco Hoad. 
Notre Dame 4, Wake Forest 3 
Many of the Demon Deacon faithful in attendance in Winston-Salem expected a win after Wake Forest pieked up the first two singles matehes, but the Irish had other plans on their mind. 
After seeuring the doubles point, Notre Dame ran into some struggles, but eventually turned up the pressure when they neoded to. 
The No. 3 doubles tandem in the nation of junior Keley Tetrt and senior Brook Buek earned their fourth eonseeutive doubles victory with an 8-4 win over the No. 28 pair of sophomore Sasha Kulikova and senior Alex llirsch. 
After fwshman Kristen Hafael and sophomore Kali Krisik dropped their doubles match 8­0, sophomore tag-team Cosmina Ciobanu and Colleen Hielley took care of business with an 8-5 win over junior Sierra Poske and freshman Emilee Malvehy, ensuring that the Irish would take the early lead. 

In singles play, it appeared as though Tefft would have her hands full against Hirsch after the first set, which eventually went to a tiebreak in the junior's favor. In the seeond set, Tefft won the final f(mr games to take the victory, 7-6, 6-2, improving her record to 11-1 in the dual match season. 
With the mateh tied at 2-2, junior Katie Potts gave the Irish a lead with a 7-6, 6-2 win over Malvehy. After taking the first set tiebreak, Potts won the first five games of the seeond set and eruised the rest of the way. 
With the Irish up 3-2, one win was all Notre Dame needed to seal the deal. Krisik stepped up with her mateh-clinehing 7-5, 6-4 win over freshman Katarina Heveche. 
After taking the first set, Krisik built a 5-2 two lead in the second frame until she dropped consecutive games. The sophomore battled back and eventually won her eleventh match of the season. 
Hielley dropped the last match, bringing the score to 4­3, but Notre Dame had already secured the victory. 

North Carolina 6, Notre Dame 1 
After losing to Notre Dame twice last year, North Carolina wanted revenge. A 6-1 vietory over the Irish ensured just that. 
Irish head coaeh Jay 
·Louderback stressed the impor­tanee of doubles play the past couple of weeks to his team, and his squad responded, tak­ing the doubles point in six straight rnatehes. North Carolina, however, ended that streak Sunday, boating two of the three Irish pairs. 
Buck and Tefft eontinund their impressive play, earning an 8-5 win over sophomore duo Sanaz Marand and Katrina Tsang and bringing the pair's winning streak to five consecu­tive matches. However, both groups of Ciobanu and Hielley and Hafael and Krisk could not overeome a Tar Heel eharge, giving North Carolina an early 1-0 lead. 
Krisik got some redemption, picking up the only singles win and the only point Notre Dame would get in the match in a 6-4, 6-3 victory over junior Meg Fanjoy. With the win, Krisik ensured an undefeated road trip and, more importantly, brought the score to 3-1. 
The Irish would drop the remainder of the singles match­es, ending the road trip on a sour note. Notre Dame now returns horne for what should be one of its most eornpetitive opponents of the season. 
Saturday at the Eek Tennis Pavilion, consensus No. 1 Georgia Tech eomes into town in a mateh up of two squads that are quite familiar with eaeh other. Last year, the Irish dropped two matches to tlw Yellow Jackets, both by a score of 4-2.

Nelip continues to dominate 
Freshman takes top individual honors, leads team success at JACC 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame could have been left out of the gold medal ceremonies this weekend, but freshman epeeist Ewa Nelip would have none of that. 
Nelip won the individual women's epee title at the Midwest Fencing Conference Championships Saturday at the Joyce Center, and then was the driving force for the women's epeeists Sunday in the team tournament.

That the women's epee final was the last competi­tion of the weekend for Notre Dame alleviated the pain of an otherwise rough set of team results. Notre Dame's chief rival, the Buckeyes of Ohio State, cap­tured five team crowns. 
"Frankly speaking, we were losing to the teams who were higher ranked and after very good bouts and very close," Bednarski said. "So, it was optimistic for a very young team."

continuation of a dominant rookie sea­son, junior Bill Ehrlich was Notre Dame's biggest. sur­prise in the individual com­petition. The less-experi­enced epeeist went 4-2 in pool play before winning three straight bouts in the direct elimination competi­tion. He lost to fellow Irish junior Karol Kostka in the 

quarterfinals but, in the process, earned second­team all-conference honors -despite not earning a monogram for the year. Kostka finished third. 
Still, the Irish finished with good, but not great, results most of the week­end. All-American senior epeeist Greg Howard failed to reach the quarterfinals in the individual competition. A low placing in pool play gave him a poor seed for the direct-elimination bracket, and sensation Jason Pryor, a junior from Ohio State, knocked Howard out of the tournament. 
Howard said he simply didn't fence well Saturday. 
Though Bednarski would have liked to seen a better performance, he said he is turning his attention to the NCAA Midwest Regionals, which begin in two weeks in Detroit. In fact, he said he would "gladly trade in" a poor performance this weekend if he could qualify the maximum 12 fencers from the regional to the March 13-16 NCAA Championships in Columbus, Ohio. 
"We have to improve tacti­cal gains because obviously we should be a little bit smarter," Bednarski said.

Notre Da111e shuts out visiting Boiler111akers 
By MIKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 
In its first match since last week's trip to Seattle, Wash., for the ITA National Indoor Championship, No. 12 Notre Dame shut out in state rival Purdue 7-0 at the Eck Tennis Pavilion Sunday. 
The Irish victory was Notre Dame's 19th consecu­tive win over the Boilermakers. 
Notre Dame took the dou­bles point from Purdue, but the Boilermakers did not go down easily. 
The Irish No. 1 pair of senior Sheeva Parbhu and junior Brett Helgeson trailed 6-5 in their match against Purdue sophomore Branko Kuzmanovic and sophomore Slavko B ij e lica, but came back to win in a tiebreaker, 9-8 (8-6). 
The new pair of senior Andrew Roth and junior Santiago Montoya defeated Purdue junior P.J. Rosae and freshman Eric Ramos 8-6. 
Freshmen Stephen Havens and Tyler Davis held off the Purdue pair of redshirt jun­ior Jose Fuenmayor and jun­ior Griffin Nienberg in another tightly contested 8­6 match to seal the doubles point. 
The Irish dominated sin­gles play -five of Notre Dame's six singles wins came in straight sets. National No. 32 Helgeson won the first Irish singles point over Kuzmanovic in 
dominating fashion, winning 6-1, 6-1. 
Helgeson improved his impressive singles record to 22-4 with the win. The Irish got their second singles point from Parbhu, who defeated Bijelica 6-2, 6-1. Parbhu's victory gave Notre Dame a 3-0 advantage. 
Notre Dame's third singles win came from Roth, who snapped a six-match losing streak with the win. Roth defeated Rose 6-2, 6-2. 
To round out singles com­petition, the Irish turned to three of their highly talent­ed freshmen. Havens won the fourth point with a 7-6 (3), 7-6 (5) victory over Purdue's Ramos. 
Notre Dame freshman David Anderson broke a four-match losing streak with a tiebreak victory over Nienberg, 7-5, 3-6, 1-0. 
Irish freshman Dan Stahl continued his stellar singles play with a straight sets vic­tory over Purdue sophomore Paul Foley, 6-2, 6-3. With the victory, Stahl improved to 19-5 on the year in sin­gles play. 
The Irish improved to 9-3 on the season with the victo­ry over the Boilermakers. Notre Dame is on the road until March 28, when it faces No. 2 Ohio State. 
The Irish travel to Champaign to face defend­ing national runner-up Illinois Saturday.

Irish lose three of five games on Florida trip 
By CHRIS DOYEN Sports Writer 
A busy weekend for the Irish ended with a 5-2 loss to No. 7 Florida in the championship game of the Aquafina Invitational in Gainesville, Aa. 
Gators pitcher Stacey Nelson struck out 13 in her 11th win of the season. The Gators scored the first five runs of the day, with the final three coming on a home run by Francesca Enea. 
Irish sophomore Heather Johnson drove in two runs with a single in the sixth inning, but that was as close as the Irish would get. Junior Brittany Bargar pitched six innings and allowed four earned runs on seven hits in the loss. 
The Irish dropped their first con­test, 3-2, Friday to Gardner-Webb. Freshman starting pitcher J ody Valdivia pitched 3 and 2.13 innings, strUck out seven and allowed three earned runs. The three runs would prove to be all Gardner-Webb would need. Johnson and Christine Lux drove in freshman Katie Fleury and senior Katie Laing, respectively, in the sixth inning, but the two runs were all the offense could muster in a losing effort. 
The Irish won a defensive battle over North Florida, 1-0, later Friday. 
Bargar, who pitched 3 113 innings of shutout ball in relief against Gardner-Webb, started the next contest against North Florida and pitched seven shutout innings and struck out seven batters. 
North Florida loaded the bases in the bottom of the third, but Bargar got two groundouts to retire the side. Notre Dame's only run came when sophomore Ashley Ellis scored from second on an RBI sin­gle from Aeury. 
Valdivia earned her first win in an Irish uniform in a rematch with North Aorida Saturday, another 1-0 victory. She pitched seven innings, ic;sued only one walk, and struck out seven en route to the win. The lone run of the day came on an RBI from junior Linda Kohan that drove in senior Sarah Smith. 
Bargar pitched well against the Gators in Saturday's second contest, but Aorida came back to win, 3-2. The Irish got out to a 2-0 lead on two runs from freshman Sadie Pitzenberger, but could not hold it. 
The 2-3 weekend record moves the team's overall record to 4-5. The Irish will be back in aetion when they faee Pacific on March 1 to open the Worth Invitational in Fullerton, Calif.

No. 11 Notre Dame got ofT 
to a quick start and thp,n 
held ofT a late Ohio State 
surge to top the Buckeyes 
14-11 in Columbus, Ohio 
Sunday. 
Freshman Shaylyn Blaney 
and junior Jillian Byers eaeh 
scored four goals for the 
Irish, who led 13-5 with Jess 
than 14 minutes to play 
before the Bucknyes scored 
six goals in a span of night 
minutns. 
"We let them gp,t back into 
the game late," Irish coach 

Tracy Coyne said. "We need 
to focus on finishing strong 
... [because] we lost a little 
bit of our momentum at the 
end there." 

Blaney, who bngan her col­lege career with a bang by scoring 10 goals through three games, got the Irish on .the board by seoring three times in the game's first 10 minutes. Byers and fresh­man Kaitlin Keena added goals to put the Irish up 5-0 midway through the first 
half. 
"We graduated some key 

players last year, and every­
one has done a good job of 
stepping into new roles," 
said Byers, who leads the 
Irish with 15 goals through 
three games. "That's my role 
I guess, and I've been work­
ing really hard to bP the 
person who can put the ball 
in the back of the net for 
us. 
Krishm Slahor and Jessiea 

Patane, who each scored 
three goals, got the 
Buckeyes on the board with 
13 minutes to play in the 
half, eutting the Irish lead to 
5-2. Byers added two more 
goals for the Irish before 
halftime, and senior captain 
Caitlin McKinney also got on 
the board with the first of 
her two goals, extending her 
school-record point streak to 42 games and giving Notre Dame an 8-3 lead heading into the intermission. 
"All week we had focused on specific tactics to beat Ohio State," Coyne said. "It's been a rivalry since both programs began. and we knew it'd be a tough, physi­cal game." 
The Irish eontinued to dominate early in the second half, seoring four of' the first five goals af'ter the break to extend their lead to 12-4. Tlw two teams traded goals to make it 13-5, and after a five-minute scoreless stretch, the Buckeyes went on a run that cut Notre Dame's comfortable advan­tage down to two. 
Slahor, Patane and Maghan Beaudrault, who led the Ohio State attack with four goals on the day, each beat Irish goalie Erin Goodman (11 saves) twice during the 6-0 run, which began with Slahor's goal at 
8:56 and nnded with Beaudrault's goal with 1:34 remaining. 
Despite the near late-game collapse, the Irish wen~ able to salvage a tough road vie­tory-something not lost on thn squad. 
"It's good to get that f'irst win on thn road," Byers said. "Being away f'rorn home, not having your honw fans, being away from thn atmosphere you praetiee in every day, and the fact that it was really cold out and we had to play outside ... we faced a lot of adversity today and it was good to bring our record to 3-0." 
The Irish will hit the road again next weekend when thny trav1ll to Palo Alto, Calif., to play Stanford at 1

At the end of the day, Notre Dame led Louisville 531-421. 
Although already leading by 110 points, the Irish proved they wanted to win big. By the end of the tour­nament,· they accumulated 820 points. Louisville was the closest team behind them, with a score of 615. 
The day began with Deters taking second place and set­ting a school record in the 1650 free with a time of (15:12.91). LeBlanc and sophomore Ross Moore took second and third in the 200 fly. LeBlanc, in fact, broke the school record for the event that was previously held by Moore. 
Sullivan snagged fourth place honors in the 200­backstroke, while divers sen­ior Sam Stoner and Bulfin dominated the three-meter board taking second and third place. 
The 400-freestyle relay team also set a school record taking second place with a time of 2:59.05. 
Welsh said the team's goal was to simply swim as fast as possible in all seven ses­sions -and the Irish did just that. 
"We tried to look at tl(e scoreboard as seldom as pos': -.~ sible and focus on swimming faster than we had all year," Welsh said. 
The day was a success for Welsh in another aspect as well -he was named the league's coach of the year for the fourth time in his career. Welsh was quick to point out that while the award might be called "coach of the year," it goes out to the entire staff, which consists of diving coach Caiming Xie, associate head coach Matt Tallman, assis­tant coach Josh Skube, along with Welsh. 
"It's a sign that we're working together really well and that it's a good staff," Welsh said. 
From here, some swimmers will turn toward preparation for their respective coun­tries' Olympic trials, while the divers will focus on the upcoming NCAA zone diving meets. After that, training for next year will resume soon, Welsh said. 
"Swimming is a year-round sport," Welsh said. "We won't resume training tonight, but it will be soon enough."

McGraw said her team did well controlling Naughton for most of the game. 
"We left her wide open, acci­dentally," Irish coach Mul'fet McGraw said of Naughton's late 3-pointer. "And then she made the driving layup. But I thought we did a good job on her over­all." 
Allen was fouled on the inbounds play and again made only one of the free throws, but Notre Dame still held the lead. 
McGraw said she was not nervous about the team's foul shooting late in the game even though Allen missed two of her four. 
"You saw us go right back to inbounding to Charel," McGraw said. "We want her on the line." 
Allen finished with 12 points, junior guard Lindsay Schrader had 11 and sophomore guard Ashley Barlow added 1 0. 
Blue Demons senior guard Allie Quigley had 21 points on 7 -of-17 shooting, Chester had 14 and Smith had 10. 
Notre Dame led 39-32 at the half, but DePaul's 9-0 run after halftime made the score 41-39 until Williamson scored with 
16:43 remaining. 

"We missed some shots, we turned the ball over a little bit," McGraw said. "The ball just slipped through our hands." 
From there, the score would stay within five for the rest of the game. 
De Paul took a 24-18 lead after Quigley made two free throws with 7:30 left in the first half, but the Irish went on a 19­6 run to end the half. In the final two minutes, Allen and freshman guard Brittany Mallory hit back-to-hack 3­pointers to help widen the lead. 
Note: 
+ Sophomore guard Melissa 

Lechlitner got her first start of her collegiate career in place of Barlow, who missed practice this week after her grandfa­ther's death. Barlow met the team in Chicago Sunday after spending time with her family. 
"[Lechlitner] scored the first four points, got us off to a great start," McGraw said. "When she made those first shots, I was proud of her." 
McGraw said Barlow played well given the circumstances and that she will probably regain her starting role.

NBA 
Six Pistons in double figures in win over Suns 
Wallace scores 22 points in 26 minutes 
Associated Press 
PIIOENIX -Detroit saves its best for the big ones, so the Pistons were more than ready for Shaquille O'Neal. 
Hasheed Wallace scored 22 points in 26 minutes to lead six Detroit players in double fig­ures, and the Pistons embar­rassed O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns 116-86 Sunday. 
Hiehard Hamilton had 18 points. Chauncey Billups 14 points and 11 assists, and Antonio McDyess 12 points and 13 rebounds. Jarvis Hayes added a season-high 18 as Detroit easily ended the Suns' 11-game winning streak against Eastern Conference foes with a nationally televised blowout. 
"This was a big game for us," Billups said. "You know how we are. man, when we play against other elite teams, we lock in. We lock in big-time. I thought everybody played great today ­everybody." 
Phonnix lost to a team from the East for only the third time in 25 tries this season. 
"They get juiced up a little bit," Detroit coach Flip Saunders said of his team's efforts against the other top teams. "I thought we were extremely focused both offen­sively and defensively." 
The Pistons, opening a four­game road trip. built an 18­point halftime lead, then blew open a 36-point advantage in the third quarter, the Suns' biggest deficit of the season. 
"It's embarrassing, it's disap­pointing, it's everything," Suns point guard Steve Nash said. "It's tough. no matter who you play, to lose by 30 points." 
Their most one-sided loss of the season left the Suns 1-2 since O'Neal started playing for Phoenix on Wednesday. 
"Maybe we used all the adren­aline left these last two games," coach Mike D'Antoni said of the Suns' close loss to the Lakers on Wednesday, fol­lowed by a victo­ry over Boston 

on Friday. "Emotionally, we've 41 at the break.

Detroit dominated from the start, using a 7-0 spurt to go up 25-14 on Hamilton's 14-footer with 1:20 left in the first quar­ter. Phoenix shot 29 percent in the first quarter. 
Hayes' 10-footer put the Pistons ahead 39-22 with 8:49 left in the half. 
The Suns climbed back into it briefly with an 11-2 run to get within 45-39 on Stoudemire's 17-footer with 3:55 left in the half. But with O'Neal back in the Phoenix lineup, Detroit scored the last 12 points of the half to go up 59­

turns 36 in two weeks, had seven points and 11 rebounds in 34 minutes and was 1-for-8 from the foul line. 
"We still have to be realistic about things," he said. "I've only been here about eight days. This is only my third game with the guys, so we still have a lot of figuring out to do. If everyone just sticks with their role, we should be fine." 
Amare Stoudemire scored 31 for Phoenix. Leandro Barbosa added 18. Nash was the only other Suns player in double fig­ures with 11 points and just six assists.

"The Pistons came out with a lot of energy, more energy than we did," O'Neal said. "And it seemed like they couldn't miss there.... It was just one of those games. Everyone was flat, including myself." 
Saunders said it's understand­able that the Suns will struggle trying to adjust following the trade that brought O'Neal from Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks. 
"They had an identity of how they played when they had Shawn," the Pistons coach said.

Shooting 
continued from page 24 
chant for the :1-ball, hilling 14­of-25 from beyond the are. 
As Irish guard Kyle MeAiarnny hit 9-of-11 from deep, .Jim Boeheim could not help but be reminded of former Orange guard Gerry McNamara, whose shooting lil'ted his teams to countless Tournament wins. 
But the comparison between McAiarney and McNamara was an unsatisfactory one in Boeheim's eyes. 
"lin shot better than Gerry," Boeheim said of McAlarney. 
If McAiarney catches lire like he did against the Orange, the Irish are capable of winning any game in March. 
Despite being physically dom­inated by a very athletic Syracuse team, the Irish came out on top because of their dead-eye shooting. The team shot almost 55 percent from the floor and made 22-of-33 foul shots. Notre Dame's 74 percent free-throw shooting percentage leads the Big East. Points from the foul line have helped the Irish finish off many opponents and that will be an important factor in the post­season. 
And twen though Syracuse out-muscled the Irish on the boards, they have the b11st rnbounding margin among Big East squads. 
If the Irish can shoot like they did Sunday and rebound likn they have throughout the sea­son. they will bP one of the most dangerous teams in the Tournament. Considering all of its weapons, there docs not seem to be much of a ceiling on what Notre Danw can accom­plish. 
"There's no limit," Irish for­
ward Luke llarangody said. " ... 
I think everyone's real excited 
with where we're at right now." 
The Irish are getting major production from players once thought of as minor contribu­tors, leaving the squad with the depth and personnel to com­pete with the nation's best teams. Five players scored at least 10 points against Syracuse and reserves Ryan Ayers, Jonathan Peoples and Luke Zeller all played key min­utes. 
Ayers' confidence level appears to triple every game, as was evident in his mon­strous two-handed dunk Sunday. After getting a steal near half-court, the Ryan Ayers of two months ago might have pulled the ball back to wait for his teammates. 
Not any more. Instead, Ayers said he knew he wanted to dunk it as soon as he gained possession. 
With such depth, the Irish will not be derailed by foul trouble. When starting point guard Tory .Jackson was forced to sit after picking up a few early fouls Sunday, Peoples stepped in and dropped seven first-half points. 
Notre Dame's top eight play­ers can hold their own against any rotation in the country. And if the Irish get hot (correc­tion -stay hot), they will do morn than simply hold their own. 
For early-round NCAA oppo­nents, that could be dangerous.
