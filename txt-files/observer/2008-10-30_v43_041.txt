Fr. Riehle dies at 83 after briefillness 
Chaplain to sports teams remembered for his love of Notre Dame athletics, students 
By CHRIS HINE Editor-in-Chief 
Hev. James Riehle, C.S.C., chaplain to Notre Dame sports teams for nearly three decades and former dean of students died at Holy Cross House­Wednesday. He was 83. 
Riehle's died following a brief illness, the University said. 
"He was a man's man. He was always interested in sports... " said University presi­dent emeritus Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, who gave Riehle his final blessings before he died. "He was a good friend because I sat next to him over at the dining hall at Holy Cross Hall and I knew a good deal about him. I saw 
him every day. We were good friends."

playing Rev. James Riehle g 0 l f ' began his role as chaplain in 
1966 and served his first foot­ball game in that capacity on Nov. 19 of that year-Notre Dame's classic 10-10 tie with Michigan State, when the Irish were ranked No. 1 and the Spartans were No. 2. 
Riehle, who graduated from Notre Dame in 1949 with a bachelor's degree in business administration, played the football team's chaplain in the 1993 movie "Rudy," and was featured in an Adidas football commercial with former Notre Dame and Super Bowl winning quarterback Joe Montana in which he asked Montana: "What did you ever end up doing after you left college?" 
But beyond his association with Notre Dame athletics, Riehle served in many offices at Notre Dame, including dean of students from 1967-73, dur­ing the student protests of the Vietnam War. At universities around the country, some stu­dent protests against the Vietnam War turned violent, but not at Notre Dame, where Hesburgh said students could protest as long as they did not disrupt classes or University business. Hesburgh said Riehle did a "very good job" enforcing this policy in a pragmatic way. 
"About 250 of my fellow presidents were fired at that time, or died, or just left in frustration during that period," Hesburgh said. "We had, like every university, a fairly rough time but we came through without any big disruption of

OIS prepares abroad students for election 
Students overseas experience difficulties in making sure their votes are counted by election day 
ByJENN METZ News Editor 
As students on campus are scramble to send out absentee ballots before Nov. 4, the esti­mated 450 Notre Dame sopho­mores and juniors currently studying abroad are experi­encing a very different presi­dential election season, com­plete with logistical difficulties for sending their vote to the United States to make sure it's counted. 
The Office of International Studies (OIS) helped prepare students by reminding them of 
the upcoming election during orientation sessions last spring, sending out pre-depar­ture letters and posting links on their Web site. 
Kathleen Opel. director of OIS, told the Observer the Office believes "voting is a vital component of democracy and strongly encourage[s] stu­dents abroad who are U.S. citi­zens to exercise the right to vote." 
"How many students actually vote, I don't know," she said. 
Program managers remind­ed participants to remember to register for absentee ballots before they left the United States, a message that was repeated at OIS' "Bon Voyage" meeting for all students last spring, Opel said. 
Opel told the students their "franchise to vote is a privilege to be cherished, and recent elections have demonstrated the value of each vote" in a pre-departure letter sent over the summer. 
The Web site offers scrolling reminders of the upcoming election and a link to the Association of International Educators' (NAFSA) Web site, which provides information about absentee ballot proce­dures for students and educa-

ND no. 1 for athlete grad rates 
University at top of NCAA for 3rd time 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Associate News Editor 
For the third time in four years, Notre Dame ranked No. 1 among the 119 Football Bowl Subdivision institutions in the NCAA's 2008 report on student ath­lete graduation rates. 
The annual report, released Oct. 14, showed that 19 of Notre Dame's 22 programs received Graduation Success Rate (GSR) figures of 100, result­ing in a .863 percentage, which placed the University ahead of Northwestern (.789), Boston College (.740), Duke (.681), Vanderbilt (.667), Wake Forest (.642). Stanford (.629), U.S. Naval Academy (.578). Rice (.539) and Tulane (.500). 
The 2008 national GSR for Division I-A is 78 percent, a news release from Notre Dame Athletics said. The GSR data show the percent­age of student athletes earn­ing a degree in six years. 
All 11 of the women's ath­letic programs -basketball, cross country and track, fencing, golf, lacrosse, row­ing, soccer, softball, swim­ming, tennis and volleyball ­received perfect scores of 100.

tors living abroad, which are different than domestic absen­tee ballot procedures. 
"Every state has different rules for voting, so it's hard to give specific voting informa­tion to a group of students from different states," Opel said. The NAFSA Web site, she said, provides that information for each state. 
In some locations in capital cities, students may be able to vote in person at consulates, she said; other students send their vote in the mail.

News Writers 
The Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) approved the Student Government Association (SGA) budget after the third vote on the issue at their meeting Wednesday night. The budget was approved with 24 .for it and one abstention. 
BOG polled the student body through e-mail as to whether or not they thought the Executive Board deserved a stipend on Tuesday. 
Student body president Mickey Gruscinski said 557 students, which is almost one third of the student body, voted and the majority did not agree with the stipend. 
Treasurer Mo Weaver pre­sented a revised budget to BOG for their approval. The revised budget did not contain· a stipend and the money for­merly allocated to the stipend was dispersed to funds for clubs and organizations, co­sponsorships, and the campus Readership Program which brings the USA Today.

STUDENT SENATE 
Group exalllines dorlll printing 
Printers not available in 18 residence halls, senators discuss expansion 

By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
Prompted by a number of complaints, the Student Senate discussed the need for printers in every residence hall yester­day. 
"People complain about it on a regular basis," Alumni Hall Senator Zach Reuvers said. "It always comes up during hall elections." 
Students often complain of having to wait on long lines to print at the clusters. 
"I live in McGlinn and some­times when I go to DeBartolo in the morning before classes there are really long lines," Senate Committee on Student Outreach chair Sarah Rodts said. "I don't always get what I need printed." 
Currenly, Lyons, Carroll, O'Neil, Lewis, Farley, Dillon, Pasquerilla West, Pangborn, Siegfried and Keenan all have printers, while students in the other 18 residence halls are forced to trek to computer clusters. Senate Committee on Oversight chair Ian Secviar said all dorms should have equal access to printers. 
"Regardless of whether it reduces traffic or not, in the pursuit of fairness this is something that we should do," he said. 
Senate Committee on Technology chair Devin Fee said the University is currently pursing a new contract with an outside company for print­ers, but if the contract is too costly, printers in dorms could be cut. 
"It is something that could get cut if the bids are too low," Fee said. "I think they realize that it's significant to us, but it's some­thing that has to be worked into the budget." 
Fee said he would seek support from the University, which has a much larger budget than the Office of Information Technology (om. 
"I think it would be a lot easier to push this through with the University supporting than OIT supporting," he said. 
Farley senator Robyn Grant said the dorms' needs should not detract from the clusters in the Library, the Coleman-Morse Center and LaFortune. 
"I feel that you shouldn't detract from the clusters for the dorms," she said. 
However, in a simple straw poll taken by student body vice presi­dent Grant chmidt, there weren't any seriators against expanding printer service in dorms.

The top-down approach, she said, examines major infrastruc­ture problems, including the cam­pus' sprinklers. 
"The main change is that [the sprinklers] will all be electronical­ly controlled," said Novick, which she claimed would stop leaks and prevent the sprinklers from com­ing on right after a rainstorm. 
Novick said the bottom-up approach focuses more on indi­vidual efforts by "encouraging faculty and students to change their lifestyles a little bit." 
The bottom-up approach includes activities such as the recent dorm-wide recycling com­petition, which was won by Walsh Hall, who reduced their energy use by 31 percent.

After leaving his post as dean of students, Riehle became the rector of Pangborn Hall in 1973 and served there until 1985. Riehle had previ­ously been rector of Sorin Hall in 1966 and chaplain of Sorin Hall in 1964. 
He was also chairman of the board of directors for the University Club from 1971-77 and director of energy conser­vation.

Brady said the United States election is a very popular topic of conversation in Ireland. 
"People here are very, very obsessed with the election and love [Sen. Barack] Obama, just because they hate [President George! Bush," she said. 
The level of interest in the United States political system is very high; Brady said she noticed "some people here care more than people at horne."

Thousands lack power in the Northeast 
ALBANY -More snow fell Wednesday in paris of the Northeast as utility crews labored to restore service to thousands of customers blacked out by the region's first big snowstorm of the season. 
The wet snow that began falling Tuesday collected on trees still covered with leaves, and its weight combined with gusty wind to send limbs crashing onto power lines. 
The National Weather Service reported storm totals of about 14 inches at northern New Jersey's High Point State Park, as much as 15 inches along the northwestern edge of New York's Catskill Mountains, and a foot in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains.

At least 170 dead in Pakistan quake 
Associated Press 

Pakistan -Desperate villagers clawed through piles of mud and timber looking for victims of an earthquake that collapsed thousands of homes in south­western Pakistan before dawn Wednesday, killing at least 170 people. 
Army planes began flying in tents. medical supplies and blankets to the quake zone in Baluchistan province, but some 15,000 homeless people in the impoverished region faced a night in the open in near freezing temperatures fol­lowing the 6.4-magnitude jolt. 
"I have lost everything," said Haji Shahbaz, mourning the deaths of 17 rel­atives in Warn, a hard-hit village. 
"Nothing is left here, and now life is worthless for me," he added. then wailed in despair, tears streaking his dust-caked face. 
Pakistan is no stranger to natural dis­asters, but the quake comes at an espe­cially precarious time for the Muslim country, with the civilian government battling ai-Qaida and Taliban attacks while grappling with a punishing ceo­nomic crisis. 
As the army and other government agencies rushed to provide help, at least three hard-line Islamic organizations also were quick to aid quake survivors, according to an Associated Press reporter who toured the area. 
Among them was Jamaat-ud-Dawa, 

designated a terrorist group by the U.S. government for its links to Muslim sepa­ratists fighting in India's portion of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. 
The group set up relief camps and won friends among survivors of a 7.6­magnitude quake that devastated Kashmir and northern Pakistan in October 2005, killing about 80.000 peo­ple and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. 
Baluchistan is home to a long-running separatist movement, but has so far been spared the level of militant vio­lence seen in the northwestern tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan, where Muslim extremists are strong.

Russell Brand quits BBC afterradioshovvSUSfX11dai 
Associated Press 
1.0 NDON -Every enter­tainer knows there's a fine lirw bntween offbeat and oiTnnsive. Hussell Brand has built a earenr walking it ­but now he may havn slum­bind. 
The wild-haired, motor­mouthed British comedian is rnnowned for risque rou­tinns, wrote a memoir recounting his drug and sex addiction and called President Bush "that retard­ed cowboy fellow" while hosting MTV's Video Music Awards. 
On Wndnesday, Brand quit his BBC radio show after he and fellow performer Jonathan Hoss were sus­pended indefinitely for leav­ing lewd messages on the voicemail of a 78-year-old aetor. Also under threat is the reputation of Britain's state-funded national broad­caster, which allowed Brand's routine to make it to air. 
The calls by Brand and Hoss to actor Andrew Sachs -best known for playing Spanish waiter Manuel in the 1970s Britcorn "Fawlty Towers" -have drawn more than 18,000 complaints. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called the eomrnents "inappropriate and unac­ceptable." 
In the ad-libbed messages, the pair claimed Brand had slept with Sachs' grand­daughter Georgina Baillie, and joked that Sachs might hang himself as a result of the news. Baillie, a 23-year­old burlesque performer, acknowledged she had a sexual relationship with Brand but said the calls to her grandfather were "cruel." 
Tho duo made further calls to Sachs in which they tried to apologize but continued to blurt out lewd messages. The calls were recorded Oct. 16 and aired on Brand's radio show two days later. 
Both Brand and Boss apol­ogized. 

"I am sorry that I upset Mr. Sachs," Brand, 33, told reportnrs outside his London 
home Wndnesday. Boss, 47, 
said he was sorry for his 
"stupid error of judgment." 
BBC director general Mark Thompson made a "personal and unreserved apology" for the "gross lapse of taste by the performers and the pro­duction team." 
lie said the pair would be suspended pending a full report into the affair. 
Brand later said he had decided to resign from his BBC radio program, which attracted 2 million listeners a week. 
"As I only do the radio show to make people laugh, I've decided that given the subsequent coverage I will stop doing the show," he said in a statement. "I got a bit caught up in the moment and forgot that at the core of the rude comments and silly songs were the real feelings of a beloved and brilliant comic actor and a very sweet and big-hearted young woman." 
Several politicians have called on the BBC to fire the pair. Telecommunications regulator Ofcorn said it would investigate whether the calls breached the broadcasting code, which sets standards for fairness and privaey. 
The case is reminiscent of the antics of American "shock jocks" such as Howard Stern -who paid repeated obscenity fines before j urnping to the unreg­ulated haven of satellite radio -or Don Irnus, who was fired from MSNBC and CBS Hadio for making racist and sexist comments about a women's basketball team. There have been numerous incidents of DJ-inspired out­rage in the U.S. In 2002, DJ team Opie and Anthony were fired by CBS Radio after broadcasting a live account of two listeners having sex in New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
Sachs said he did not plan to complain to the police or other authorities. 
"I respect his decision," he said about Brand. "I hope he moves forward, I really hope he does."

IN BRIEF 
FDA officials opposed drug suit policy 
WA~HINGTON-Top scientists and career employ­ees at the Food and Drug Administration opposed agency regulations that weaken consumers' ability to sue drug makers, congressional investigators said Wndnesday. 
At issue is language in a drug labeling rule from 2006 that effectively limits when people can sue in state court over injury claims involving medications. The FDA contends federal regulations prevail when there i<> a conflict with state law. This concept is called pre-emption. 
Internal agency documents showed that career offi­cials opposed this approach, according to a report released by Rep. Henry Waxman, chairman of the I louse Oversight and Government Reform Committee. In the past, the agency had viewed private suits as an additional layer of protection against unsafe drugs, the report said. 
"Much of the argument for why we are proposing to invoke pre-emption seems to be based on a false assumption that the FDA approved labeling is fully accurate and up-to-date in a real time basis," the rnport quoted Dr. John Jenkins. who oversees FDA's new drug reviews, as saying. "We know that such an assumption is false." 
Patienl'i injured by drugs have won suits against drug manufacturers for failing to warn against certain dangers. 

World stocks higher as Fed cuts rate 
LONDON -World stock markets ended mostly higher Wednesday but many retreated from their session peaks as investors returned to fretting about corporate earnings in a global recession and a rally on Wall Street fizzled. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve met market expecta­tions by trimming a key interest rate by half a percentage point in a bid to revive the world's largest economy. Global markets surged Tuesday in anticipation of the Fed's move but there appean~d to be only lackluster follow-through. 
Late-session selling sent the Dow Jones indus­trials down 74.16. or 0.82 percent, to end at 8,990.96 after being up nearly 280 points, which would have given them a two-day gain of more than I.H>O points. 
European stock markets dosed mostly higher Wednesday, eatr.hing up with Tuesday's surge on Wall Street that started after European nxehanges had closed.

As gunfire crackled in this eastern provincial capital, the Tutsi rebels said they had reached the outskirts of Goma and declared a unilateral cease­fire to prevent panic as the army retreats and residents flee. 
Congo said Hwandan troops had crossed the border and attacked its soldiers -raising tho spncter that neighboring nations will again be drawn into Congo's war. Hwanda's Tutsi-led government immedi­ately denied the charge, but Congo turned to Angola for help defending its territory.

CAMPAIGN NEWS 
Obama on prime-time; McCain criticizes 
MIAMI -Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama plunked down $4 million for a cam­paign-closing television ad Wednesday night, sum­moning voters to "choose hope over fear and unity over division" in Tuesday's election. Republican John McCain derided the event as a "gauzy, feel­good commercial," paid for with broken promises. 
"America, the time for change has come,"Obama said in the fmal moments of the unusual ad, a blend of videotaped moments and a live appearance before thousands in Sunrise, Fla. 
"In six days we can choose an economy that rewards work and creates jobs and fuels prosperity starting with the middle class," Obama said. 
The 30-minute ad. aired on CBS. NBC. Fox and several cable networks, came just days from the end of a race in which Obama holds the lead in polls nationally as well as in most key battleground states as he bids to become the first black presi­dent. 
Hepublieans and even some Democrats said the race was tightPning as it neared the end. And while Obama made no mention of McCain in his paid tele­vision ad. both men sharpnned their rhetoric during the day. 
Palin suggesls she will be a GOP fixture 
TOLEDO, Ohio -Facing the unhappy prospect of dp({mt, Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin indicatPd Wednesday that she will not disappear from the national political scene if the GOP tickPt IOSPs on Tuesday. 
"Absolutely not. I think that, if I were to give up and wave a white flag of surrender against some of the political shot<> that we've taken, that ... that would ... bring this whole ... I'm not doing this for naught," Palin said in an interview with ABC News, according to excerpts of a transcript released by the television network. 
Palin was steadfast in saying Republican presi­dential nominee John McCain would defeat Democrat Barack Obama. 
''I'm just ... thinking that it's gonna to go our way on Tuesday, Nov. 4. I truly believe that the wisdom of ... of the people will be revealed on that day. As they enter that voting booth, they will understand the stark contrast between the two tickets," the Ala<>ka governor said. 
In addition to the interview, Palin delivered a poli­cy address in which she called for a "clean break" from the Bu.<>h administration's energy policies. She said the White House plans rely too much on importing foreign oil. 
Democrats dominate early voting 
WASHINGTON -Democrats are dominat­ing early voting in six key states President Bush won four years ago, forcing Republican .John McCain to play catch-up even before Election Day arrives. 
Democrats outnumber Republicans among early voters in Iowa, North Carolina, Florida, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada, accord­ing to statistics from election and party offi­cials in those states. Bush won all six in 2004, and McCain needs to win most of them to claim the White House this year. 
Georgia, another red state, doesn't track early voters by party, but it does by race. About 1.4 million Georgians have already cast ballots, and blacks are voting in dispro­portionate numbers. Black voters over­whelmingly support Democrat Barack Obama, who is bidding to become the nation's first black president. 

Values issues highlight state ballots 
Voters can decide thier states' position on issues like abortion and gay marriage 
Associated Press 

Social issues so volatile that the presidential cam­paigns sidestepped them will be on the ballots in several states next week, including measures that would criminalize most abortions, outlaw affirma­tive action and ban same­sex marriage in California, one of only three states that allows it. 
In all, there are 153 pro­posals on ballots in 36 states. 
In Washington, voters will decide whether to join Oregon as the only states offering terminally ill peo­ple the option of physician­assisted suicide. Massachusetts has three distinctive measures on its ballot -to ban dog racing, ease marijuana laws and scrap the state income tax, a step that could unleash budgetary tumult. 
The main presidential rivals, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain. have rarely made proactive·comments during the campaign about same-s!')x marriage or affirmative action -issues on which the public is deeply divided. Abortion also has seemed like an uncomfortable topic for them at times, although Obama makes clear he supports abortion rights and McCain says he would like to ban most abortions. 
But in a half-dozen states, these three issues are front and center. 
Florida, Arizona and California have constitu­tiona! amendments on their ballots that would limit marriage to a man and a woman. More than two-dozen states have pre­viously approved such amendments, but none were in California's situa­tion -with same-sex mar­riage legal since a state Supreme Court decision in May and thousands of gay and lesbian couples already wed. 
The rival camps view the California vote in epic terms, with the outcome of Proposition 8 having enor­mous influence on 
prospects for same-sex marriage rights in other states. 
"If we lose California, if they defeat the marriage amendment, I'm afraid that the culture war is over and Christians have lost," said Donald Wildmon, founder of the American Family Association. "California is a big dam, holding back the flood -and if you take down the dam in California, it's going to flood 49 other states." 
Obama is expected to win easily in California, but the vote on Proposition 8 is expected to be close. Of keen interest to both sides is how churchgoing black and Hispanic voters -in general a pro-Obama constituency -will vote on the ballot measure. 
Both Obama and McCain say they oppose same-sex marriage. But Obama, unlike McCain, opposes Proposition 8 and endorses the concept of broader rights for same-sex cou­ples. 
Gay rights also is an issue in Arkansas, where a ballot measure would pro­hibit unmarried couples from adopting or being foster parents. Conservatives backing the idea say it's aimed at same-sex couples, who are able to adopt and be foster parents in most states. 

Abortion is a dominant campaign topic in South Dakota, which has an ini­tiative that would ban the procedure except in cases of rape, incest and serious health threat to the moth­er. A tougher law without the rape and incest excep­tions was defeated in 2006; a recent poll on the new version showed a dead heat. 
Colorado has a "person­hood" amendment on its ballot that would define human life as beginning at fertilization. It doesn't explicitly mention abor­tion, but activists on both sides in the campaign view it as a blunt challenge to abortion rights -so blunt that the National Right to Life Committee, Colorado's Roman Catholic bishops and some other anti-abor­tion groups have declined 
to endorse it on strategic grounds. 
Some of those skeptical of the idea believe it would run aground in legal chal­lenges. Abortion-rights activists contend it would -if approved -potential­ly lead to the banning of certain types of birth con­trol. 
Colorado and Nebraska have proposals that would ban race-and gender­based affirmative action, similar to measures previ­ously approved in California, Michigan and Washington. The man spearheading the move­ment, California activist­businessman Ward Connerly, says the candi­dacies of Obama, Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin prove blacks and women no longer need affirmative action. 
"Anyone who raises $150 million in one month is being judged pretty much on the basis of their politi­cal abilities and not on the basis of race," Connerly said of Obama during a debate in Nebraska last week. 



SOUND BYTE: HEALTH CARE 
What will you do to improve the health care system? 
"My health care plan will make sure insur­ance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most. If you have health insurance, the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums. If you don't have health insurance, you'll be able to get the same kind ofhealth insurance that Members ofCongress get for themselves. " 

''To use their money effectively, Americans need more choices. We should give additional help to those who face particularly expensive care. !fit is done right and the additional money is there, insurance companies will com­pete for these patients -not turn them away. It is a challenge to develop techniques that allo­cate the right amount to each ofthese fami­

With less than a week until election day, I have found myself wondering what I'll do with all the time I will save by not checking multiple blogs, new leeds, and polls several times every day. I also find myself reflect­
ing on the entirn election season as a whole, rnmember­ing-not quite nos­talf.,Tica.lly-some of the more sensation­al twist'> and turns, and deciding what I 


learned from my Jason Coleman 
first true immersion 
into American poli­

tics. Man at Large 
For me, it started last Christmas brnak when a friend of mine called me a li1w days bdbre New Year's, <L'>king if I wanted to drive up to Iowa to see the candidates make their pitches just days befi>rc the caucuses. Over a forty­eight hour span I would see stump speeeh­es from !bur candidates at middle schools and diners. 
It's funny to think baek on that now. First, I saw Mike lluckabee at a bar in some sleepy town. He was a mostly unknown Arkansas governor at the time, and made a strong enough pitch on values and compassion to win the contest. (MeCain came in fourth). I'm not sure any­body thought that he was going to be the runner-up in the GOP contest even with the win, surviving the deadly Republican National Convention primary system clear into March. 
Then, I walked a block or two down to a small diner, where Rudy Guiliani answered questions and signed autographs. Even as late as last Christmas, a lot of the smart money pegged him as the nominee. He had chosen to use Florida as his first (and last) stand in the process. The effectiveness of that position was more or less summed up 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
In response to the various abortion arguments gracing the Viewpoint's pages these cold fall days, all it really shows is the obvious discord between beliefs in this country. I thought an opinion from experi­enee would be useful to throw into the mix. 
I am a mother. I have faced the "choice." There are no words to express the flood of emotions which fill a woman when she di<;covers she is pregnant, especially at such a young age. From happiness to fear, it ranges across the spectrum. 
Overall, I agree with Mary Da.ly's opinion ("For Clarification," Oct. 28) when she says, "A pregnant woman who fmds her­self in a position in which abortion seems the only answer ... is not being afforded the right to choose." 
Unfortunately, in today's society, that is often the case. I have held a staunch pro­life view throughout my life, but not unti.l you are faced with the issue at hand do you truly question your beliefs. I will admit, abortion was an option, and a high­ly considered option for me the first few days. 
When one is flooded with ideas of today's norm of leading life (i.e. college, when a native Iowan shouted out "Why 
aren't you showing Iowa any love?" That 
was tough for even America's mayor to 
answer. It also probably explains why he 
finished behind Hon Paul. 
I.ater that evening, I watehed John Edwards in a middle school gym. His strat­egy, more or less, W<L'> to come out ahead or dose to ahead in Iowa as a result of vote splitting between the two superstar candi­dates, Clinton and Obama. I Ie ended up finishing second, edging Clinton out by no more than one percent. With his recent recreational activities exposed, I still shud­der to think what would have happened had he been the nominee. 
The next morning, on the way out of Des Moines, we stopped to see Baraek Obama speak in an elementary school auditorium. I had heard of him, like many others, after his 2004 DNC speech, but had not followed him or even knew what his chances were. Everyone figured Clinton would win any­how. But, we were intrigued and decided it was worth checking out. Uttle did we know that in a few days Iowa would shoek political circles, allowing Obama to draw first blood against the Clinton Machine. 
Of course, since then, there has been no lack of surprises and upheava.ls in thn political world. Some of these were com­pletely external; common knowledge through the spring indicated that Iraq would weigh heaviest on voter's minds. Who would have thought the global eeono­my would implode dramatically over a matter ofweeks? 
Other surprises were intentional. The GOP VP pick, for instance, comes to mind. Who saw that coming? Add to the mix "Joe Six Pack," Joe the Plumber and Joe "Foot in Mouth" Biden, and you could have a primetime sitcom. 
In all seriousness, the political education I received over the last year has provided more insight into the way America works 
I have chosen 
job, marriage, promotion, then children) and the more-common-than-not shame afforded to unwed mothers in our society, I felt very alone when, with a single deci­sion, I was ripped from that norm into a life-track of my own. This loneliness directed me to consider abortion; however, after a night of tears and prayer, that "ehoice" was forever deleted from my mind. 
What made me decide not to partake in this option given to me? It came down to one word: support. !learned of the sup­port offered to me by my family and friends. I discovered the support given to me by the University. I supported myself by knowing I could be a mother and still reach all the goals in my life. 
Too often today are women like me faced with the same decision and not given the support they need in order to know that abortion, while a legal choice, is actually the worst choice available to them. While I feel that this nation is a long way from making abortion illega.l again based on a rights disagreement, we should be focusing on making less and less women feel the need to terminate a preg­nancy because she feels there is no other than any book or course ever could. In some c&<;es, it was exporionce, such going up to Iowa or voluntoering to eanv<L'>S, that provided first hand insight into how a polit­iealfbllowing is built. In others, it W<L'> all the infiwmation gleannd from watd1ing CNN, or li>llowing tlw New York Times commentators. Most importrnltly, though, it was probably the argumnnL'> with my friends over such important issuos that helped me to darify my worldview and see how it lit with the way tlw world eurrnntly works. 
N! ofthis, however, lnd me to conclude that voting in and of iL<;elf is tantamount to being an American. Voting is the eonstitu­tional right of the people to change the face of America every time thny step to the bal­lot box, and one that should not bn volun­tarily given up. I understand that it is hard to justify voting <L'> a Demoerat in a deeply Hed state or visa versa, but I don't think this provid11s a rn&'>on not to do so. The vote is the strongest political statement one can make, regardless of how it tigurns into the bigger picture. It should not be taken lightly. 
So, let me send you oil", in my l&'>t eolumn of the election se<L'>on, with the charge to vote. Ifthe absnntee ballot is sitting on your desk, dose it up and drop it in the mailbox. If you are mgistnrnd horn in Indiana, brave the lines and make your voice heard on Tuesday. Make sure you remind your friends and family. Hegardless of who wins the raee, America wins if everyone partici­pates. Plus, as Bob Sehieffer reminded us in the third debate, voting "will make you feel big and strong."

choice. 
How? Support, and unlimitHd amount<; of it. I still believe abortion is the murder of an innoeent life, but I now understand how a woman can tee! so trapped that she feels there is no other option available. Now, after going through the most difficult nine months of my life, I have a beautiful one-year-old daughter who never stops smiling, a wonderful fiance I am marrying next spring, high grades in school, a promising internship next summer and the most fulfilling life I eould have ever imagined. 
I do hope, as lindsey Schwartz ("Who has the 'Right to Life'?" Oct. 13) pointed out, that no one is put into the situation that I was; however, know that the choice you make can lead you to be the happiest you have ever been. I look at my daughter and tears fill my eyes with the thought that I might have never seen her big, beautiful, blue eyes with a "choice" I almost made.

Sitting with Grandpop and God 
I wish you could have met Thomas Fizzano, my 1-,rrandfather. I think I wish you could have met him. lie was one intimidat­ing old man. The completely undisputed patriarch of our traditionally Italian family. 
IIe was steely quiet  
-in that aloof and  Fr. Lou Delfra  
intimidating kind of  
way ­and utterly unapproachable. I  Faithpoint  
can't remember ever  

actually talking to him. As a kid, I learned about him largely through legends that others would tell around the Christmas tabln after hn left the room. How he had built a huge concrete company from scratch. How he had invited his brothers and cousins from Italy, and supported tht~m until they got on their feet in /\me rica. Ilow he had llown a fighter jet in World War II. and returned home a hero. 
So, this is how I knew my grandfather for most of my life-more as an unap­proachable lngend than as a real human being. 
Then. in 7th grade, an unforeseen brnakthrough. My history teacher assigned us to interview someone who had lived through the Dnpression. My mind, of course. immediately jumped to my kind and gentle grandmother, but my mom informed me that she was not in the coun­try during the Depression. 
Then, I could read my mom's eyes ­and I screamed. "No way!"-as she asked. "Why not ask grandpop?" 
On the appointed day, my mom drove me to my grandparents' house. I pulled out a piece of looseleaf on which I had written out every word I was going to say to my grandpop. And, hiding behind the paper, I began the interview: "Where were you liv­ing when the Depression began?" 
I will never forget the next hour of my life. 
Because over the next hour, this man, in all of his inapproachability and intimida­tion, looked me in the eye, smiled, and spoke to me, quietly, gently. 
And one particular moment in our inter­view stands out. My grandfather spoke about losing his brother to cancer during the Depression, and regretted not having enough money to get better care for him. As he told this story, I heard just the slight­est pause in his voice. I remember stealing a glance, and caught sight of a tear that hung on the edge of his eyelash. 
Two years later, my grandfather himself died of cancer. In his last days, he couldn't speak and was barely conscious. And I used to sit next to his bed for an hour or two, just reading the names of the horses and jockeys in that day's races at Philadelphia Park Gust to complete the old Italian patriarch stereotype, my grandfa­ther loved horse racing). 
I remember during those days feeling oddly comfortable sitting next to my grandfather. This man, who had intimidat­ed me my entire life, suddenly seemed gentle, and approachable, and knowable. 
Today, when I want to really remember my grandpop, I think of two times: the day we sat at his kitchen table and he cried about losing his brother in the Depression; and the days I sat next to him as he died. 
My point is this: I think there is some­thing deeply revelatory about seeing some­one who you know to be powerful become suddenly vulnerable. Someone who seemed totally secure and in control, living in another world than ourselves, become suddenly helpless and human, and know­able. 
And I wonder if Jesus isn't sometimes one such person for us. 
Surely all of us have been attracted by Jesus' message, by his power, his goodness and holiness. And it is sometimes difficult, in the face of such overwhelming good­ness, to think that this person can truly love us in our own limitations. Pity us, per­haps, but not love. 
At some points in my life, I have a hard time praying because I feel, deep down, that God must be somehow disappointed in me. That is to say, God, in my weakness, can seem unapproachable. 
But when I walk into Church, I am con­fronted by this man on a cross. Jesus, the good and holy one, dying. And on the cross, precisely dying, we see Jesus as someone like us-for on the cross, Jesus takes on our greatest limitation and our certain fate -that one day we will die. And if he is willing to take on that limita­tion, which other of our limitations would drive him away? 
On the Cross, we see someone like us ­and in doing so, our Church invites us to see our God. 
We all have people in our lives, like my grandfather was in mine -people who seem unapproachable, because of their power or their authority or even because of their goodness. They can often seem larger-than-life. They can tend to make us see our own deficiencies, rather than our potential goodness. We can feel insufficient around them. 
Maybe, sometimes, Jesus is one such person for us? 
But the central mystery of our faith asserts a profound response to this natural question in our hearts. That our God has become weak like us, vulnerable like us, broken like us -human like us. And pre­cisely as such, he invites us to come to know him and to love him. 
Perhaps that is why, when Christians throughout the centuries have wished to spend time with their God, to know him and love him, in all his unapproachable glory, they have done so by sitting before Jesus, hanging on the cross.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Scraping by on a quarter tnillion 
Like countless Notre Dame students, I started off my Tuesday morning by zoning out in my 9:30 and perusing The Observer, where I discovered a viewpoint entitled "Barack the Socialist" (Oct. 28). In her article, Christina Pesavento draws a contentious connection between Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama's opinions and socialist tendencies. How original. I was on the verge of not completing the column based solely on the banality of the argument until I read the section in which she provides three reasons why Obama's intention to increase taxes for Americans that earn a net income of over $250,000 is unwar­ranted. 
First, Pesavento declares, " 000 English philosopher John Locke 
states, 'government has no other end than the preservation of property."' Yes, Locke's views greatly influenced Thomas Jefferson when he drafted the Declaration of Independence. However, Ronald Terry Constant, a historian, claims, "Next to the Bible, Locke's writings were the most quoted source in revo­lutionary literature." Furthermore, the Bible asserts, " 000 when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed." This is not an argument against separation of Church and state. It simply emphasizes that Christian ideals truly inspired the framers of the Declaration, indicating that the government is obligated to support the impov­erished. 
Secondly, Pesavento compares Obama's tax policies to exam grades, where "A" students would have to give some of their points to students that "have slacked off and are receiving lower grades." Well, how about students who could not even afford books to study for this exam? Pesavento makes it seem as if all Americans are provided with the necessary resources to succeed monetarily in this country. False. Individuals who live below the poverty line are lucky to have a "Where's Waldo" book during their youth. 
Lastly, Pesavento asserts " for those Americans who live in
00. 

areas where the cost of living is very high, $250,000 a year is next to nothing." Seriously?
00. 

For the record, I am not arguing Pesavento's belief that Obama supports socialist principles. While I strongly disagree with her on that conviction, I do not have the time or political knowledge to debate that topic. Nonetheless, Pesavento's column fails to comprehend the atrocious financial conditions in which a great amount of Americans live. In fact, no one, including myself, can truly understand the horrid environment that these unfortunate people must experience daily. 
Clearly not someone making over $250,000.

Spread the logic 
I am proud of Sean Lyttle ("We need socialism," Oct. 29) and his future "lucrative career" as a trial lawyer. I'm sorry, however, that he feels guilty for everything from his upbringing to his race to his potentially successful future. There is no reason he should. 
It does, however, represent a key difference between the thinking of liberals and conserva­tives. Lyttle suggests that it is some kind of des­tiny that puts people in the life situations they are in, and there is really nothing good or bad that they can do to reverse the course. That's where the government must come in to "even out the playing field." In a debate with Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primaries, Charles Gibson asked Senator Obama why he would propose raising the capital-gains tax from 15 percent to as high as 28 percent, when it has been shown in recent years that raising the rate has actually decreased the revenues to the treasury. Obama, stunned that a mainstream reporter asked him a legitimate, tough question, responded: "Well, Charlie, what I've said is that I would look at rais­ing the capital-gains tax for purposes of fairness." 
Now we understand his true motive. It has nothing to do with the adopting the best policy or growing the economic pie, but rather deciding himself how best to divide up the pieces. Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, said recently that pay­ing taxes is patriotic. I can't see how, given the fact that taxes are involuntary. 
But if guilty upper-class liberals or trial­lawyers-to-be feel that they are not contributing a fair amount to the treasury, they should take the lead and voluntarily write checks to the govern­ment whenever they feel like not enough kids have the proper texthooks. Rather than let Obama decide the "fairest" allocation of the peo­ple's resources, why not decide for our guilty selves? 
Moreover, Lyttle claims that the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in this country is "cata­strophic medical bills." This very well may be true, and it reminds one of P.J. O'Rourke's quote: "If you think health care is expensive now, wait until you see what it costs when it's free." 
Lyttle is right that the recent bailouts on Wall Street were ludicrous, and it's forcing an already broke U.S. Government to print money to finance basic operations. Given all this, how can any rea­sonable person expect Obama to deliver on any of his never-ending promises, such as a health care utopia, when inheriting this astronomical debt? 
Lyttle writes that "perhaps according to Webster's dictionary, it is proper to label Barack Obama a 'socialist.' But to do so misses the point." I'm not sure which dictionary he would prefer to use, but I'd trust Webster's. And it does­n't miss the point at all. 
Lyttle accuses Pesavento ("Barack the socialist," Oct. 28) of a "classist bias," but it is he, not Pesavento, who wants different rules applied to people strictly based on class. Progressive taxa­tion was not introduced in this country until 1913, and since that time it has spun progressive­ly out of control. This class discrimination is not what America was founded on, though Barack Obama has made it clear that it is one of his guid­ing principles.

In light of this spooky holiday sea­son, Legends is getting into the horror game by sponsoring a showing of the 2004 British film "Shaun of the Dead." . This spot-on parody spoofs classic zombie movies while still scaring up its share of chills and Halloween 
thrills. 
In the l'ilm, slackerish Shaun (Simon 
Pegg) attempts to win back his girl­
friend Liz (Kate Ashfield) while he and 
his buffoon best friend Ed (Nick Frost) 
battle hoards of flesh-eating zombies 
across their North London neighbor­
hood. Not to be missed. 
Saturday: "Dracula" at the South : Bend Civic Theatre, 8 p.m. 
Yes, it's the day after Halloween, but 
why not keep the spooky spirit alive 
another night? 
The South Bend Civic Theatre, min­
utes from both the Notre Dame and 
Saint Mary's campuses, will feature per­
formances of "Dracula" all weekend. As 
the Count himself says in the play, "I 
want your fear ... for your fear renders · your veins rich and full." 
The play is an adaptation by Steven Dietz of the original Bram Stoker novel. Visit www.artseverywhere.com for more information. Tickets cost $17 and there is also a midnight showing on Friday. 
Friday: Notre Dame Glee Club Fall con­cert, Leighton Concert Hall, 8 p.m.

B.B. King's guitar" for its unique style and beauty. Tickets cost $38, $30 for faculty and staff, $28 for sen­iors and $15 for students. 
By MICHELLE FORDICE Assistant Scene Editor 
We're back and the doors to .. the dining hall are flung open ~ once again, so it's time to get back to work finding good things to eat. Hopefully a week off has put a shine back on the offerings of North and South, but if not 
: here are some ideas to keep you going, so dig in! This week's recipes: 
Pitas with Garbanzo Beans and Spinach 
There is something about pitas that just makes them fun, so stuff away! Spinach has gotten a bad name, probably because it is often served over-cooked, but don't give in to the association. It has a great flavor and is a good shake up from the usual lettuce. Garbanzo beans (the stars of many Middle Eastern foods such as hummus and falafels) with their nutty flavor are a good source of protein. 
Fill a bowl with spinach, gar­banzo beans, mushrooms, feta cheese (Not a feta fan? Try blue cheese, or even sprinkle on a bunch of the parmesan from the pizza area.) and red onion. 
Mix a dab of Dijon mustard into red wine vinegar and pour over the contents of the bowl. You can squeeze some lemon on top as well, if that is to your taste. (Too much work? You can actually just toss a dab of Dijon mustard on the top, pour over the vinegar and mix it later.) 
If you want a hot pita, stop by the microwave and zap it for about 1 minute. If you're in more of a crunchy and fresh mood, just leave it as is. 
Make sure everything is well mixed and cut into bite sized pieces. Sprinkle with pepper. 
Stuff the mixture into the pitas. 
Black Bean and Bacon Salad 
Lettuce is hardly a require­ment for a salad. This one is based around black beans, a bunch of other yummy vegeta­bles and of course, bacon. There isn't much that beats bacon, is there? 
Fill a bowl with black beans, shredded carrot (or dice up a couple of carrot sticks). diced tomatoes, red onion and corn. 
Add a little red wine vinegar, but not too much, you don't want to overwhelm this one. 
Pick up a couple slices of bacon from the sandwich area 
(or hot from the breakfast area if it is early enough in the day). Shred and mix into the other ingredients. 
Warm up the bowl in the microwave for about a minute. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. You can try adding in some ranch dressing for another taste. 
Quick Tip 

Have a favorite sandwich you always make? Try transferring the same ingredients to a wrap. a pita, or even just some of the nicer breads you have t.o slice yourself. It will make a tried and true dish a little more special. Don't forget the pickle! 
Have your own dining hall recipe? We would love to feature it! E-mail mfordice@nd. edu.

Pinch-hitter Geoff Jenkins, the first batter Wednesday 

night, doubled and later scored on Jayson Werth's bloop single. 
In all, there were six new pitchers, three pinch-hitters and two pinch-runners when play restarted. 
Manager Charlie Manuel, whose NL East champions clinched a playoff spot in the final week, guided the Phillies' second overall cham­pionship in six World Series tries. The Phils helped them­selves by going 7-0 at home this postseason, beating Milwaukee and the Dodgers in the NL playoffs and then defeating the Rays. 
"I always thought we'd win the World Series. I knew we could beat anyone in the league," Manuel said. 
Once known as a city of champions, Philadelphia sports fell on hard times after Julius Erving and Moses Malone led the Sixers to that 1983 title. 
Since then, the Phillies, Eagles, Sixers and Flyers made it to the championship game or round -seven times, 
in total-and lost all of them. 
The city became so starved for a crown that it was ready to throw a parade down Broad Street for a horse. But local colt Smarty Jones lost, too, in his bid for the Triple Crown. 
"People enjoy being associ­ated with winning and a world championship is the ultimate," Mike Schmidt, MVP of the Phillies' other champi­onship, wrote in an e-mail to The Associated Press this week. "It unites a town behind one team." 
Cheesesteaks, on the house. 
Tampa Bay did itself proud, too, until this final week. Baseball's best success story this season, the worst-to-first Rays played like the down­trodden Devil Rays from the past decade. 

Even so, the gap between the Phils and Hays wasn't enormous. Had Evan Longoria's late, long drive off Jamie Moyer in Game 3 not been blown back by the wind, the teams might still be play­ing.

Associated Press 

AUBURN HILLS Michael Curry wants the Detroit Pistons to project a new image, consistently attacking on offense and playing hard on defense. 
After Game One, it's a work in progress. 
The Detroit Pistons played well enough to build big leads only to allow the Indiana Pacers to rally before beating them 100­94 Wednesday night in the opener for both teams. 
Curry, though, can't fault the effort he saw in his debut as a head coach. 
"If you get a big lead, NBA teams are going to come back on you because they're too good," Curry said. "The key is minimiz­ing their runs and we did that." 
Tayshaun Prince had 19 points, Richard Hamilton scored 15, Chauncey Billups added 13 points and seven assists, and Walter Herrmann had 10 points to help Detroit's reserves easily outscore their counterparts. 
Danny Granger led the new-look Pacers with 33 points and got some help from new teammates T.J. Ford, Jarrett Jack and Rasho Nesterovic. 
Indiana had seven more turnovers and nine fewer offensive rebounds than Detroit. 
IN BRIEF Artest debuts in Rocket 
victory over Grizzlies 
HOUSTON -Since acquiring Ron Artest in the offseason, the Houston Rockets have talked boldly about contending for the NBA champi­onship. They have plenty of improvements to make before that happens. 
Yao Ming had 21 points and 10 rebounds, Artest added 16 in his Houston debut, and the Rockets overcame poor shooting to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 82-71 on Wednesday night. 
Luis Scola had 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Rockets, who were 28-for-76 (36.8 percent) from the field. They also went 5-for-16 from 3-point range and were outrebound­ed 49-44. 
"It was ugly," said Artest, who went 6-of-14 from the field. "But if it means we're 1-0, then we'll take it." 
Rudy Gay scored 20 and Darrell Arthur had 11 points and 15 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who've lost all eight season openers since moving to Memphis in 2001. 
"The difference in the game was the turnover dif­ferential and the offensive glass," Pacers coach Jim O'Brien said. "We shot 50 percent and we got to the line 13 times more than they did, but we shot our­selves in the foot." 
Just eight of the 15 play­ers on Indiana's opening­night roster were on the team at the end of last sea­son. 
The Pistons planned to shake up their core ­which helped them win a championship in 2004 and advance to six straight Eastern Conference finals -but they ended up standing pat and counting on Curry along with an 
influx of youth to  take  
them back  to  the  NBA  
fmals.  

Expectations are rela­tively low for Detroit after getting eliminated in Game 6 of conference finals the past three seasons. 
The Pistons have provid­ed fodder for doubters with inconsistent play and arro­gant attitudes that have stunted their potential. 
"We've earned the right for people to ask, 'Has this team made their last run?' We've earned the right [for people] to ask if we're going to be able to get it with the few changes we've made," Curry said. "We have to reassure ourselves, first and foremost." 

Utah outlasts Denver in 
Western Conference duel SALT LAKE CITY -Carlos Boozer had 25 points and 14 rebounds and Andrei Kirilenko added 16 points in his new reserve role and the Utah Jazz opened the season with a 98-94 win over the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night. Mehmet Okur had 13 points and 10 rebounds and Ronnie Price finished with five assists start­ing in place of Deron Williams, who is out with a sprained ankle. Denver rallied from a 14-point deficit to tie it in the fourth quarter, but couldn't overtake the Jazz, who went 13-for-16 from the foul line in the final period to hold on. Allen Iverson had 18 points and eight assists to lead the Nuggets, who were missing star Carmelo Anthony while he served the first of a two-game suspension from a DUI arrest over the summer. 
Hagman's goal lifts 
Maple Leafs over Devils 
Nf:WARK, N.J. -Niklas Hagman pulled out a move he worked on in practice to beat Martin Brodeur in the shootout. 
Hagman scored on a nifty back­hand in the fourth round to give the Toronto Maple Leafs a 6-5 win over Brodeur and the New Jersey Devils on Wednesday night. 
Hagman came in very tight on Brodeur, whipping home the deciding goal while showering the goalie with a spray of ice shavings. 
"I decided I was going to try something else and I felt pretty confident with it," Hagman said, "I didn't want to put snow in his face. That's why I felt a little bad. I didn't want to celebrate too much. I didn't want to be cocky." 
After Hagman gave Toronto a 2-1 shootout lead, Vesa Toskala secured the win with a blocker save on Jamie Langenbrunner.

NBA 
Oden sidelined 
with injured foot 
Trail Blazers star to miss two to four weeks 
Associated Press 
PORTLAND, Ore. Portland Trail Blazers center Greg Oden will miss two to four weeks because of an injury to his right foot. 
The team said Wednesday that MRI and computerized axial tomography scans con­firmed Oden has a mid-later­al foot sprain. 
Oden, who missed all of last season after knee surgery, injured his foot in the first quarter of the Blazers' 96-76 season-opening loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night. 
"I was trying to go get a rebound, and kind of came down on Derek Fisher's foot on like the third play of the game. I kind of fell and didn't think twice about it," he said after the game. 
Oden missed four field goals and two free throws in 13 minutes of play. 
The 7-foot center was the top pick in the 2007 draft. But even before his rookie season started, it was post­poned by microfracture sur­gery on his right knee. 
Trail Blazers coach Nate McMillan had not yet heard of the MRI results when he addressed reporters Wednesday at the team's practice facility in Tualatin, Ore. 
"You don't want injuries, and he's worked so hard throughout this summer to get himself back," McMillan said. "And we tried to do everything we could to get him ready for the season and the opener, and he steps on a guy's foot." 
Blazers guard Brandon Roy, who also spoke before the tests were complete, said the team will prepare to move forward without Oden for Friday night's home opener against San Antonio. 
"I feel bad for him," Roy said. "I know this is a big year for him and he had a lot on his shoulders." 
Oden's first game was high­ly anticipated by Blazers fans, who had waited a long time to see the top draft pick. The team had not had a No. 1 pick since 1978, when they chose center Mychal Thompson of Minnesota. 
After he was held out last season, Oden rolled his ankle in the first practice of the fall. That injury wasn't seri­ous, however. 
At Ohio State, Oden aver­aged 15.7 points and 9.6 rebounds, but Oden struggled with a wrist injury. He led the Buckeyes to the national championship game, scoring 25 points and grabbing 12 rebounds in the loss to Florida. 
NFL 
Wilfork fined for hit on Cutler 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -New England defensive tackle Vince Wilfork will be fined but not suspend­ed by the NFL after meeting with commissioner Roger Goodell about a hit on Denver quarterback Jay Cutler, a per­son familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
The Patriots nose tackle met Tuesday with Goodell and the commissioner decided to forgo a possible suspension. That's according to a person familiar with the case who asked for anonymity because there has been no official announcement. 
The NFL declined comment, noting that fines and suspen­sions normally are announced on Fridays. 
Wilfork was summoned before Goodell after the Broncos claimed tape of New England's 41-7 win Oct. 20 showed Wilfork elbowing Cutler in the helmet. 
However, the tapes that were reviewed during the hearing did not show that clearly, upholding New England's contention there was no intent to injure. They 
also showed Wilfork helping up Cutler and patting him on the back after the play. 
Wilfork was fined a total of $35,000 last season for four different episodes. They included hits on Buffalo quar­terback J.P. Losman and Dallas tight end Jason Witten. He also was fined for putting a finger inside the facemask of New York Giants running back Brandon Jacobs and grabbing the facemask of San Diego's Michael Turner dur­ing the AFC championship game. 
Wilfork has played for the Patriots since being drafted in the first round out of Miami in 2004. 
He said Wednesday that he didn't know what the outcome of the meeting would be, but felt the session was produc­tive. 
"I think both sides were happy," Wilfork said. "lie got a chance to hear my side of my story of how I approach the game. I got a chance to hear what he had to say about the whole situation of my past history and playing football and all that good stuff. So I think we both left pretty happy."

Etan Thomas played in his first real NBA game since an April ;{O, 2007, playoff loss to Clnveland. Thomas missed all of last season after having open­heart surgery, but he looked lit and aggressive Wednesday and f'inished with 10 points and eight rebounds. 
The Wizards are opening the season without Arenas, who is recovering from a third opera­tion on his left knee in 1 1/2 years. When healthy, he is the Wizards' top scorer, most cre­ative player and go-to option when they need a buzznr-beat­er. They certainly could have used him whiiH managing to score only one field goal in last 6 minutes Wednesday. 
Arenas has offered varying estimates for when he might be back this season, and Washington coach Eddie Jordan was vague when asked about his star's rehabilitation. 
"No timetable. Due process. lie's on course. He's disciplined about it. lie's diligent about it,"Jordan said. "And we'll just have to see as it goes along." 
During a glittery prngame ceremony, Arenas was not introduced to the crowd. When play began, he sat on the side­line wearing a sports coat and brightly colored foullard. A row behind Arenas was eenter Brendan llaywood, who had a breakthrough 2007-OH season but nended surgery on his right wrist this month and eould be out for the season. 
Nnither team looked quite ready to go in a first half that lacked any rhythm and nnded with Washington leading 46-44. 
In the third quarter, Washington wont on 10-0 run, with half the points seored by Antonio Daniels. to takn a 62-5H lead with 4:14 left. But Hayes carne in to score live consecu­tivn points -with a back­ground of boos -and put tlw Nets back in front. 

Keyon Dooling scornd the last four points of the third quarter to give Nnw Jersey a 69-67 edge heading to the fourth. 
Tho Wizards' last lead was 75-74 with H:17 left, and New Jersey end11d the game on a 21­10 run. 
The Nets returned only one starter from last season's open­ing-night roster: Carter, of course. Overall, only three cur­rent players-Carter, Josh Boone and Scan Williams ­were on the roster at thn start of last season, the fewest num­ber of holdovers in franchise history. 
That is why Frank said he's installed less than half of his offense. 
"We're not going to be a fin­ished product now," he said. "This is going to be an evolving thing -dean up and improve and continue to put in things whenever the group is ready for it. We have hardly anything in." 
Still, on this night, it was enough. 
Atlanta 99, Orlando 85 
Jon Johnson scornd 25 points, including nine in the fourth quarter, to help the Atlanta Hawks hold off a late Orlando rally for a 99-85 win Wednesday night in the season opener for both teams. 
Dwight Howard had 22 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Magie, who lost their home opener for only the second time in the last nine seasons. Mickael Pietrus added 20 points. 
Josh Smith chipped in 17 for the Hawks. 
Orlando had a better road than home record last season in winning 52 games, and one of the Magic's priorities this sea­son was doing a better job defending their home court. 
The Magic, expected to con­tend with Boston and Detroit for the Eastern Conference title, fizzled more than sizzled, shooting only 37 percent. Atlanta led by as many as 19 before Orlando got within seven points in the final minute, but Mike Bibby hit three free throws after a flagrant foul by Hedo Turkoglu to seal the victo­ry. 
Orlando struggled early, mak­ing only three of its first 18 shots. Howard, who moments before tipoff told the crowd, "We're going to be something special this year," was anything but in the first half, missing 
four of his  first  five  shots,  
including  two  that  were  
blocked.  

Howard finished strongly, scoring 12 points in the fourth quarter. lie had his familiar struggle from the free throw line, going 6-for-13. 
Atlanta dominated on the boards early, and held the Magic without a point for nearly six minutes near the end of the first quarter in building a 23-8 lead. Hashard Lewis, Pietrus and backup point guard Anthony Johnson, who threw an alley-oop to Pietrus for a dunk, keyed a second quarter run that cut Atlanta's halftime lead to 4 7-40.

NBA 
Thunder falter in franchise debut 
Three Bucks score 20 in opening night win 
Associated Press 
OKLAHOMA CITY -A block party filled the street with fans in blue Oklahoma City Thunder shirts. NBA commissioner David Stern walked to midcourt and welcomed the city to the league. A banner was unfurled with the team's new logo. 
Then the ball was tipped off and the celebration promptly ended. 
Michael Redd, Richard Jefferson and Charlie Villanueva each scored 20 points and the Milwaukee Bucks gave Oklahoma City's sellout crowd little hope about by spoiling the Thunder's debut with a 98-87 win on Wednesday night. 
The Bucks were in control from the start, taking their first double-digit lead by the midway point or the first quarter, and they gave the 19,136 in atten­dance little to cheer about until it was too late. 
"We had to come out hitting. That was the whole goal tonight was to come out fast," Redd said. "We knew we were in a hostile environment." 
Oklahoma City started 2-for-12 from the field and never led, falling behind 20-9 and then watching Rookie of the Year Kevin Durant come out of the game with early foul trouble. 
Even when he returned, it did­n't make a difference. Durant was held scoreless in the first half, and instead it was Redd that broke through first. 
Coming off a 30-point per­formance a night earlier, Redd hit his first 3-pointer and then stole the ball from Durant for a fast-break layup during a 10-1 run that pushed the Bucks' lead to 39-21. 
By then, any electricity from the crowd had been turned off. 
"We were just hoping that if they were playing on a lot of emotion early in the game that we'd be able to weather it," said Bucks coach Scott Skiles, who got his first win with his new team. "And they were. I think that probably sometimes these kind of events can weigh on the home team a little bit also and we were able to take advantage of it." 
Andrew Bogut added 14 points and Bell scored 11 for Milwaukee. Villanueva also had 12 rebounds. 
Chris Wilcox led Oklahoma City with 15 points off the bench, first-round pick Russell Westbrook scored 13 in his debut and Durant finished with 12 on 5-for-14 shooting. 
"I thought the atmosphere was definitely great," Wilcox said. "We had a lot of fans here, fan support. and I think if we get that night in and night out, a lot of games that we struggle, down the stretch we will come out with." 
The Thunder had too big of a deficit for their excitable crowd to really play a factor. 
Jefferson, Redd and Villanueva each hit 3-pointers early in the second half as the Bucks had lit­tle trouble against a Thunder defense that was the fourth­worst in the league last season. The lead grew to 71-47 after Villanueva scored off the Bucks' fourth offensive rebound of the same possession and then he and Jefferson combined to hit four free throws. 
Westbrook got Oklahoma City within 90-79 when he capped a 20-8 run with a 3-pointer from the right wing with 5:11 remain­ing, but Redd scored an easy layup underneath sparked a seven-point spurt that put the game away for Milwaukee. 
"For one night at least, it came together well for us," Skiles said. 
Johan Petro had the Thunder's first official shot with a missed jumper from the left wing, and Bogut made the first basket of the game, 39 seconds in. Earl Watson had Oklahoma City's first points on a layup 13 sec­onds later.

Stoudemire 

broke a tie game with 2:53 to go with a three-point play. 
"Amare was huge for us down the stretch," Porter said. "[Nash] also made a couple of big plays. It was a solid win for us and just a great way to start the sea­son." 
After Raja Bell stole the ball away from Duncan on the other end of the court, Stoudemire quickly scored on a fastbreak on an assist from Nash to give Phoenix a 99-94 lead with 2:31 remaining. 
The turnover and quick basket angered Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who was 12­0 in season-opening games. 
"It was the worst transition defense I've seen in years," Popovich said. "I can't imag­ine how bad it was. 
"Several people made poor decisions in the game down the stretch. It was very disap­pointing." 
Bell stole the ball on a Duncan pass. Bell fired the ball to Nash, who set up Stoudemire for an easy layup. 
Phoenix led 101-98 with less than a minute remaining, but Parker missed a 3-pointer with 39 seconds left before Duncan missed his try. 
Once again the Spurs employed the Hack-a-Shaq that helped them last season in the playoffs. During the preseason, O'Neal called Popovich's liberal use of the Hack-a-Shaq during the first round last season "a coward move." 
Popovich poked fun at O'Neal in the opening seconds of the ballgame when Michael Finley grabbed the big center away from the ball a scant five seconds into the game. O'Neal laughed when he looked over to the Spurs bench and saw Popovich smil­ing while giving two thumbs up. 
"I thought it was funny ­bring a little humor to the game," Duncan said. 
It got more serious before halftime when the Spurs employed the Hack-a-Shack four times in the final 1:26 with Phoenix leading 46-40. 
Even though O'Neal made 5-of-8, the Spurs were able to cut the Suns' lead to 49-46 at halftime. 
Before the grabbing and pulling was done, O'Neal got tangled with Ime Udoka. Udoka was motioning to the official that he was going to foul O'Neal, and O'Neal raised his left arm toward Udoka and sent the Spurs defender flat onto the floor. Udoka was called for the foul and O'Neal made both shots.

Big East 
continued from page 24 
"Georgetown knew what was at stake today," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "It was a big game for their program, and they were very ready. To win the Big East two years in a row is a big accomplishment. It would be nicE~ to win it out­right this year." 
Leading the way for Notre Dame W11dnesday was forward .feb Brovsky who tallied both Irish goals. The first came in the 24th minute when, after receiving a pass from fellow forward Bright Dike, Brovsky slipped past a defender and tired past (;eorgetown km~per Matthew Brutto. 
Al'ter l'el!~r Grasso tied the game for the lloyas in the 53rd minute, Brovsky put Notre Dame back in front almost immediately. The soph­omore was the first to rise and get connect with a Jack Traynor free kick heading the ball past Brutto. Brovsky's game winning goal was his fifth tally of the season. 
"Both goals from Jeb were very good," Clark said. "The second goal was a great ball from .Jack Traynor, and the first goal was very well-taken. Jeb is arguably our most clini­cal finisher. He's developing into a first class player." 
What made Brovsky's goals even more impressive was whom they came against. Georgetown entered Wednesday's game with a miniscule 0.58 goals against avnrage, and Brovsky's goals were the first time an oppo­nent has found the back of the net against Brutto in 763 min­utes this season. 

Brovsky's tallies also helped the Irish break out of a mini­scoring slump. In their two games over Fall Break, Notre 
Dame scored only  one  goal  
against  Seton  Hall  and  
Connecticut.  Clark  was  

encouraged but not totally pleased by the team's effort on Wednesday. 
"Against Seton Hall, every­thing was there but the finish­ing," Clark said. "Against Connecticut, we had more of the game than we've ever had there, but to be fair, we didn't generate many scoring chances. There was some good buildup today, but the finish­ing still wasn't there to be honest. 
"We had three one-on-ones with their keeper in the sec­ond half, and we missed all three of them. That wasn't good, but in retrospect it was good because we had to fight to the end learning how to manage a tight game." 
There was one downer for Notre Dame Wednesday after­noon as starting goalie Andrew Quinn had to leave the game part way through the second half. In the 72nd minute, Quinn made a diving save, but he landed awkward­ly injuring his shoulder in the process. 
After the game, Clark said that the team would have a better idea of the extent of Quinn's injury after he gets an MRI, but Quinn will be out for at least a few weeks. Junior goalie Phillip Tuttle will start in his place.

helped out," he said. 

The freshman from Saint Paul, Minn. hauled in his team leading fifth touchdown against Washington to set a record for freshman receivers. He is also only one catch away from breaking sophomore Duval Kamara's freshman receptions record. 
The fast start for one of the most impressive freshmen classes in the country is due in a big way to the camaraderie thfl team was able to develop before they came to campus. 
"We were already close enough so when we're work­ing out and pushing one another you're not like, 'Ok who's this guy pushing me,' it's more like 'Ok this is my team­mate, this is my buddy, so we were able to all push one another pretty hard," Rudolph said. 
The class knew long before they arrived that they had the chance to be something spe­cial. That's why none of the recruits, who had their pick of the nation's top colleges, backed down even after the dismal 3-9 season in 2007. Several players said they were asked relentlessly if they would change their minds, but they all had the same response -no way.

Biting the Big East 

Irish clinch share of league title with win 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 

It may have been the biggest game in Georgetown's recent program history, but it was Notre Dame who made the statement Wednesday al'ter­noon with a 2-1 victory at Alumni Field. 
Only two points behind the Irish entering the game, the Hoyas arrived in South Bend eyeing their first ever Big East Blue Division title. With the victory, the Irish not only denied Georgetown that accomplishment, but they also clinched at least a share of the Big East Blue Division title for the second consecutive season -Notre Dame shared the title with Connecticut in 2007.

By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 

More than half of Notre Dame's freshmen class met each other on January 5, 2008. 
15 of the team's 27 freshmen were invited to San Antonio that week for the Army All­America Bowl for graduating high school players. 
"We spent that week together down there and we kind of had our Notre Dame group and then there was everyone else," tight end Kyle Rudolph said. "I think that played a more role in our class coming so close together." 
The highly-touted group con­tinued to stay in touch with one another throughout the sum­mer to talk about how excited they were to get to South Bend and get things rolling. Once they arrived, they didn't waste much time. 
Rudolph is only one of several freshmen who have played a major role in Notre Dame's 5-2 start this season. lie has been listed as the No. 1 tight end since week one and currently has 14 catches for 166 yards and two touchdowns. 
Those numbers make him the second leading freshman receiver on the team behind wide receiver Michael Floyd. Floyd, who has 31 catches for 533 yards, was also in San Antonio at the All-America Bowl.

Belles one goal short again 
By ALEX BARKER 
Sports Writer 

Once again, the Saint Mary's found itself in a very tightly contested match. But, once again, they came up just one goal short. 
Saint Mary's endured its third consecutive one-goal loss falling 2-1 against con­ference foe Albion Wndnesday afternoon. 
A first half headlined by great defensive play yielded only one goal for Albion which came with just three minutes remaining before halftime. 
The Belles came out with a quick answer in the 51st minute off the foot of junior forward Micki Bedinger. Jledinger received a pass from fellow junior Sam Smogor and slid it past tho Briton keP.per to knot the game at one. 
IlowP-ver, the Saint Mary's resurgence was quickly matched when Albion eoun­tered with a goal of its own in the 58th minute. 
Junior Patty Duffy had another solid game in goal for the Belles recording five saves. Duffy has made 77 saves on the season. 
This loss brings the Bc1lles' season record to 2-12-1 over­all and 1-7 in MlAA play. Saint Mary's finishes eighth in the conference, good enough to clinch the final spot in the postseason tour­nament.

STORY BY KAITLYNN RIELY
PoUsters and pundits are making predictions about the outcome of the presidential election, but for all the pontificating, one of the biggest Election Day uncertainties is whether the "youth vote," young people between the ages of 18 and about 29, will vote in significant numbers. 
"Some people say, it's the young vote . . . that would decide the election one way or another, if they really get out and vote for [Democratic candidate Sen. Barack] Obama," said Jack Colwell, a political columnist for the South Bend Tribune and a Notre Dame professor in the Journalism, Ethics and Democracy program. 
If the youth vote does not materialize, he said, then Republican candidate Sen. John McCain has a better chance of winning. 
Nov. 4 marks the first time most Notre Dame students can vote in a presidential election. But based on the past youth voting record, it is likely that many students at Notre Dame, and many young people across the country, will not vote. 
"Young people just don't have a history of voting," Notre Dame political sci­ence professor David Nickerson said. Since young people tend to move around the country more often than older people, they are harder for cam­paigns to mobilize. Voting is a habit, Nickerson said, so once a person votes, he is more likely to vote the next time. 
Many young people have not developed the habit, he said. 
Others may believe their vote does not matter, Colwell said. 
"They may be soured by politics, or have the theory that they are all crooks, or that none of them are going to do anything, which isn't true, because elections do matter," Colwell said. 
The high point for the youth vote was the 1960s, Nickerson said, but since then, the percentage of younger voters has declined. When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, he made an "unprecedented outreach to young voters," Nickerson said, and that caused a jump in the num­ber of young people who voted. 
This year, Nickerson said, more young people than in the past have been responding in surveys that they are likely to vote. 
"The general consensus is that turnout will be higher amongst young people [this year] than in 2004," Nickerson said. 
Colwell agreed that young people seem more interested in the 2008 election than presidential elections four and eight years ago. 
"This time, they seem to be more interested in the election, probably realiz­ing that there is a lot more at stake," he said. 
Issues like the Iraq War, the environment and energy initially attracted the interest of the young electorate, Colwell said. 
Obama has inspired many young voters to become interested in poli­tics for the first time, Nickerson said. Obama has been aggressivelycourting the youth vote, pushing for people to apply for absentee ballots if they are out of state on Nov. 4. McCain has also targeted young voters, but where Obama's approach has been broad-based, McCain's is more selective, aimed at young people likely to vote Republican, Nickerson said. 
But it will be another week before the McCain and Obama campaigns will be able to tell whether their youth strategy has worked. 
Based on their observa­tions and interactions, some Notre Dame profes­sors and students predict­ed a high percentage of Notre Dame students would vote. 
Notre Dame students are more interested in 
the turnout of this elec­
tion than they have been 
in the past, Colwell said, 
offering anecdotal evi­
dence Trom his classes 
and his time on campus.

Excerpt from Sen. Barack Obama's nomination speech to the Democratic National Convention, as released to the Associated Press: 
Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to. 
It is that promise that has always set this country apart, that through hard work and sac­rifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American fami­ly, to ensure that the next gener­ation can pursue their dreams as well. 
That's why I stand here tonight. Because for 232 years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordi­nary men and women, students and soldiers, farmers and teach­ers, nurses and janitors, found the courage to keep it alive. 
We meet at one of those defin­ing moments, a moment when our nation is at war, our econo­my is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more. 
Tonight, more Americans are out of work, and more are work­ing harder for less. More of you have lost your homes, and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach. 
These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed poli­cies of George W. Bush. 
America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this. 
This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work. 
This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news. 
We are more compassionate than a government that lets vet­erans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes. 
Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land: enough! This moment, this election is our chance to keep, in the 21st cen­tury, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On Nov. 4, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough." 
Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that, we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evi­dence that he can deliver the change that we need. 
But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety per­cent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change. 
The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a differ­ence in your lives, on health care and education and the economy, Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this president. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisers, the man who wrote his economic plan, was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners." 
A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and work­ing as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the mili­tary families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without com­plaint. These are the Americans that I know. 
Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he does­n't know. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under $5 mil­lion a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an educa­tion plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement? 
It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it. 
For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredit­ed Republican philosophy ­give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is, you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No health care? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, even if you don't have boots. You're on your own. 
Well, it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America. 
You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country. 
We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diplo­ma. We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president, when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000, like it has under George Bush. 
We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dig­nity of work. 
The fundamentals we use ·to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great, a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight. 
Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army and was reward­ed by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. 
In the face of that young stu­dent who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and schol­arships. 
When I listen to another work­er tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed. 
And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured every­thing she had into me. And although she can no longer trav­el, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well."

Hxcerpl from ,<.,'en. Joe !Jiden 's nomination speech to the /Jemocratic National Convention, as released to the Associated Press: 
Sinee I'vo never been called a man of few words, let me say this as simply as I can: Yes. Yes, I accept your nomination to run and serve alongside our next Pn~sidnnt of tho United States of America, Barack Obama. 
Let nw mako this plodge to you right hnrn and now. For ovory Amorican who is trying to do tho right thing, for all those poople in governmnnt who are honoring tlwir plndge to uphold tho law and respnet our Constitution. no longer will the night most drnadml words in the 1\nglish language bn: "The vice prnsidnnt's ol'fice is on the phone." 
Baraek Obama and I took very dill'nnmt journeys to this desti­nation. but we share a eommon story. Mirw began in Scranton, l'nnnsylvania, and then Wilmington, Dnlaware. With a dad who fell on hard eeonomic times, but who always told me: "Champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up." 
I wish that my dad was hnre tonight, but I am so gratd'ul that my morn, Catherir111 Eugenia t:innngan Biden. is hnrn. You know, she taught her children­all the children who flocked to our house-that you are defined by your sense of honor, and you are redeemed by your loyalty. She believes bravery lives in every heart and her expectation is that it will be summoned. 

Failure at some point in every­one's life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable. As a child I stuttnred, and she lovingly told me it was because I was so bright I couldn't get the thoughts out quickly enough. When I was not as well dressed as others, she told me how handsome she thought I was. When I got knocked down by guys bigger than me, she sent me back out and demanded that I bloody their nose so I could walk down that street the next day. 
After the accident, she told me, "Joey, God sends no cross you cannot bear." And when I triumphed, she was quick to remind me it was because of others. 
My mother's creed is the American creed: No one is bet­ter than you. You are everyone's equal, and everyone is equal to you. 
My parents taught us to live our faith, and treasure our fam­ily. We learned the dignity of work, and we were told that anyone can make it if they try. 
That was America's promise. For those of us who grew up in middle-class neighborhoods like Scranton and Wilmington, that was the American dream and we knew it. 
But today that American dream feels as if it's slowly slip­ping away. I don't need to tell you that. You feel it every single day in your own lives. 
I've never seen a time when Washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up. Almost every night, I take the train home to Wilmington, sometimes very late. As I look out the window at the homes we pass, I can almost hear what they're talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed. 
Like millions of Americans, they're asking questions as pro­found as they are ordinary. Questions they never thought they would have to ask: 

Should mom move in with us now that dad is gone? Fifty, sixty, seventy dollars to fill up the car? Winter's corning. How we Now, we owe more on the retire?

Women contemplate possibility of first female VP 
Students agree Palin's candidacy is a milestone, but disagree about her qualifications and readiness for the job

By LIZ HARTER 
Gov. Sarah Palin would make 
In Focus Writer 
history as the first female vice president if Sen. John McCain For the first time in the wins the election. Palin has nation's history, the United been governor of Alaska since States could see a woman in a 2006 when she defeated an position of power in the White incumbent governor in the House after next Tuesday's Republican primary and a for­
mer two-term Democratic gov­ernor in the general election. 
The possibility that Palin could become the nation's first female vice president has been a topic of discussion at meet­ings of the Notre Dame club Feminist Voice. 
"I think it's a big step to have a female on a ticket like this," said senior Mary DeAgostino, the secretary of Feminist Voice. "The idea of having a woman in a position of power like this is a great idea. I think it's a really important step for women in America. 
DeAgostino does not think, however, that Palin is the right woman to make this historic step. 
"I think the bigger issues that people need to look at are where different candidates stand on issues that are impor­tant for everyday women in America right now," she said. "I think it's important to be critical of different candidates' stances on women and gender issues, instead of just ascribing meaning to someone's gender." 
Notre Dame junior Colleen Moran, co-president of the Notre Dame club Women in Politics agreed that it is impor­tant to look at the issues, but she is happy that women have been active in the election this year. 
"While I do not necessarily support those policy measures Sarah Palin would endorse as vice president, I am encour­aged by the more active role women have assumed in this presidential election," she said. 
Moran said she is impressed that Palin has been able to rally so many people from different backgrounds to the Republican platform. 
"In the weeks immediately following her nomination, she was able to generate a great deal of enthusiasm for the McCain campaign," she said. 
But Moran is disappointed that Palin has not allowed the media much access because, 
she  said,  dealing  with  the  
media  is  a  necessity  in  the  
national political arena.  

"I believe both a level of com­fort with the media and an ability to respond eloquently and intelligently to public criti­cism are essential qualities for a national political figure," Moran said. 
Notre Dame senior Sarah Lyons, the vice president of Feminist Voice, said Hillary Clinton's historic run for the presidency should not be over­looked. 
"While Sarah Palin's vice presidential nomination is a critical step in women's politi­cal participation, I also think recognizing Hillary Clinton and how far she went for the Democrats is really important and should be kept in mind," Lyons said. "I think that was empowering and inspirational for many people." 
Lyons does not think Palin supports the issues women are interested in, like where candi­dates stand on equal pay, reproductive rights and vio­lence against women. 
"Personally, I'm not sure if Sarah Palin stands for my per­sonal interests," Lyons said. "I don't think she does." 
DeAgostino added: "I don't think she stands for feminists' interest." 
But, DeAgostino added, Clinton and Palin have con­tributed positively to the politi­cal discussion. 
"I think this election year has been critical in promoting women's political participation, and raising these issues," DeAgostino said. 
Moran said Clinton and Palin have different leadership styles, tailored to appeal to dif­ferent types of people. 
"Hillary Clinton has, in large part, tailored her leadership style to appeal to voters at the national level," she said. "Her husband's election to the presi­dency thrust her into the national spotlight, and she seized the opportunity to hone her own leadership skills. Clinton comes across as -if at times harsh -both intensely focused and articulate. 
"Palin, by contrast, has developed a leadership style geared towards voters at the local and state level. She demonstrates an ability to relate to everyday Americans as well as a freshness and enthusiasm at times lacking in Washington. Palin comes across as -if at times inexpe­rienced or uninformed someone Americans can con­nect with."

Fr. Riehle dies at 83 after briefillness 
Chaplain to sports teams remembered for his love of Notre Dame athletics, students 
By CHRIS HINE Editor-in-Chief 
Hev. James Riehle, C.S.C., chaplain to Notre Dame sports teams for nearly three decades and former dean of students died at Holy Cross House­Wednesday. He was 83. 
Riehle's died following a brief illness, the University said. 
"He was a man's man. He was always interested in sports... " said University presi­dent emeritus Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, who gave Riehle his final blessings before he died. "He was a good friend because I sat next to him over at the dining hall at Holy Cross Hall and I knew a good deal about him. I saw 
him every day. We were good friends." 
Riehle, w h 0 enjoyed c i g a r smoking

playing Rev. James Riehle g 0 l f ' began his role as chaplain in 
1966 and served his first foot­ball game in that capacity on Nov. 19 of that year-Notre Dame's classic 10-10 tie with Michigan State, when the Irish were ranked No. 1 and the Spartans were No. 2. 
Riehle, who graduated from Notre Dame in 1949 with a bachelor's degree in business administration, played the football team's chaplain in the 1993 movie "Rudy," and was featured in an Adidas football commercial with former Notre Dame and Super Bowl winning quarterback Joe Montana in which he asked Montana: "What did you ever end up doing after you left college?" 
But beyond his association with Notre Dame athletics, Riehle served in many offices at Notre Dame, including dean of students from 1967-73, dur­ing the student protests of the Vietnam War. At universities around the country, some stu­dent protests against the Vietnam War turned violent, but not at Notre Dame, where Hesburgh said students could protest as long as they did not disrupt classes or University business. Hesburgh said Riehle did a "very good job" enforcing this policy in a pragmatic way. 
"About 250 of my fellow presidents were fired at that time, or died, or just left in frustration during that period," Hesburgh said. "We had, like every university, a fairly rough time but we came through without any big disruption of

OIS prepares abroad students for election 
Students overseas experience difficulties in making sure their votes are counted by election day 
ByJENN METZ News Editor 
As students on campus are scramble to send out absentee ballots before Nov. 4, the esti­mated 450 Notre Dame sopho­mores and juniors currently studying abroad are experi­encing a very different presi­dential election season, com­plete with logistical difficulties for sending their vote to the United States to make sure it's counted. 
The Office of International Studies (OIS) helped prepare students by reminding them of 
the upcoming election during orientation sessions last spring, sending out pre-depar­ture letters and posting links on their Web site. 
Kathleen Opel. director of OIS, told the Observer the Office believes "voting is a vital component of democracy and strongly encourage[s] stu­dents abroad who are U.S. citi­zens to exercise the right to vote." 
"How many students actually vote, I don't know," she said. 
Program managers remind­ed participants to remember to register for absentee ballots before they left the United States, a message that was repeated at OIS' "Bon Voyage" meeting for all students last spring, Opel said. 
Opel told the students their "franchise to vote is a privilege to be cherished, and recent elections have demonstrated the value of each vote" in a pre-departure letter sent over the summer. 
The Web site offers scrolling reminders of the upcoming election and a link to the Association of International Educators' (NAFSA) Web site, which provides information about absentee ballot proce­dures for students and educa-

ND no. 1 for athlete grad rates 
University at top of NCAA for 3rd time 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Associate News Editor 
For the third time in four years, Notre Dame ranked No. 1 among the 119 Football Bowl Subdivision institutions in the NCAA's 2008 report on student ath­lete graduation rates. 
The annual report, released Oct. 14, showed that 19 of Notre Dame's 22 programs received Graduation Success Rate (GSR) figures of 100, result­ing in a .863 percentage, which placed the University ahead of Northwestern (.789), Boston College (.740), Duke (.681), Vanderbilt (.667), Wake Forest (.642). Stanford (.629), U.S. Naval Academy (.578). Rice (.539) and Tulane (.500). 
The 2008 national GSR for Division I-A is 78 percent, a news release from Notre Dame Athletics said. The GSR data show the percent­age of student athletes earn­ing a degree in six years. 
All 11 of the women's ath­letic programs -basketball, cross country and track, fencing, golf, lacrosse, row­ing, soccer, softball, swim­ming, tennis and volleyball ­received perfect scores of 100.

tors living abroad, which are different than domestic absen­tee ballot procedures. 
"Every state has different rules for voting, so it's hard to give specific voting informa­tion to a group of students from different states," Opel said. The NAFSA Web site, she said, provides that information for each state. 
In some locations in capital cities, students may be able to vote in person at consulates, she said; other students send their vote in the mail.

News Writers 
The Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) approved the Student Government Association (SGA) budget after the third vote on the issue at their meeting Wednesday night. The budget was approved with 24 .for it and one abstention. 
BOG polled the student body through e-mail as to whether or not they thought the Executive Board deserved a stipend on Tuesday. 
Student body president Mickey Gruscinski said 557 students, which is almost one third of the student body, voted and the majority did not agree with the stipend. 
Treasurer Mo Weaver pre­sented a revised budget to BOG for their approval. The revised budget did not contain· a stipend and the money for­merly allocated to the stipend was dispersed to funds for clubs and organizations, co­sponsorships, and the campus Readership Program which brings the USA Today.

Rays' play:

Stupid Hays. 

Thanks to them, I have to wateh the 
"Sex and the City" movie. 

What in God's name brought about this unfortunate chain of' events? How did I bury myself' in this prndicament? I placed faith in the Hays, something which, as history should show us, I rwver should have donn. 
I had a bet with my girlfriend on the World Series. If the Hays win. she had Bill Brink to watch "Clerks" with me. "Clerks" is 
one of' my top 1o .(iports Editor favorite movies, one of' the gmatnst of' all time. Dante and Handall's witty banter demonstrate what's really important in life, especially in today's dreary cli­mate. Who earns that the economy is in tho dumpster'? Who earns that we're involved in two wars? Isn't it mueh morn important to understand the dichotomy between the dnstruetion of t.hn Death Star in "A Nnw Hope" and "Hnturn of the Jodi?" Tlw hockey game on the roof, the funeral, the unf'ortunatn dnath in the 1~onvnnienen store bathroom: shner hrilliancn. Instead, I have to watch Charlotte and Miranda parade around New York City eomparing their Prada handbags and Mar10lo Blahnik kicks. Game I was an abnrration. Game 2, the Hays got back on track. Game 3 was a great baseball game. Game 4 just sucked. Oncn Game 5 rolled around with llanwls as the starter, I thought the Hays wen~ done for. But tlum fate intervmwd; c;od didn't want me to watch "Sox and the City" after all. I~~~ let Upton steal second and scorn on P1ma 's single, meaning the ganw was tied when rain forced its stoppag1\. I thought for surn that was the last sign the Hays nendnd. But no, .Jon Maddon must have liknd the movin and wantnd to make sure I saw it. I have no interest. The only relation I havn to "Sex and the City" is the one time Charlotte was on "Seinl'eld." Jerry dropped her toothbrush in the toilet, prompting her to retaliate and send Jerry on a germaphobia-indueed dean­ing frnnzy. Good times. I've seen one episode of the TV show; I think I saw it with my step mom. It's the one where Kim Cattrall dates a rabid Knicks fan, and she can't sleep with him unless the Knicks win. As a rabid Knieks fan mysell', that episode wasn't half-bad. Maybn it will be like "How to Lose a Guy in 10 l)ays" and tlwn1 will be a scone at Madison Square Garden with the Knicks in the playoffs. So thanks to Hyan Howard and Shane Victorino and the rest of the Phillies, I won't enjoy watching Jay and Silent Bob waste their day away out­side the Quick Stop, or the egg­obsessPd shopper rolling eggs down the aisle to ensure their quality. Instead, I'll hear four 30-something-year-old women whining about their boyfriends -or lack thenmf. The whole time, I'll think of one thing: how sweet it will tastP when my beloved Yankees mop the floor with Tampa Bay next April.

STUDENT SENATE 
Group exalllines dorlll printing 
Printers not available in 18 residence halls, senators discuss expansion 

By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
Prompted by a number of complaints, the Student Senate discussed the need for printers in every residence hall yester­day. 
"People complain about it on a regular basis," Alumni Hall Senator Zach Reuvers said. "It always comes up during hall elections." 
Students often complain of having to wait on long lines to print at the clusters. 
"I live in McGlinn and some­times when I go to DeBartolo in the morning before classes there are really long lines," Senate Committee on Student Outreach chair Sarah Rodts said. "I don't always get what I need printed." 
Currenly, Lyons, Carroll, O'Neil, Lewis, Farley, Dillon, Pasquerilla West, Pangborn, Siegfried and Keenan all have printers, while students in the other 18 residence halls are forced to trek to computer clusters. Senate Committee on Oversight chair Ian Secviar said all dorms should have equal access to printers. 
"Regardless of whether it reduces traffic or not, in the pursuit of fairness this is something that we should do," he said. 
Senate Committee on Technology chair Devin Fee said the University is currently pursing a new contract with an outside company for print­ers, but if the contract is too costly, printers in dorms could be cut. 
"It is something that could get cut if the bids are too low," Fee said. "I think they realize that it's significant to us, but it's some­thing that has to be worked into the budget." 
Fee said he would seek support from the University, which has a much larger budget than the Office of Information Technology (om. 
"I think it would be a lot easier to push this through with the University supporting than OIT supporting," he said. 
Farley senator Robyn Grant said the dorms' needs should not detract from the clusters in the Library, the Coleman-Morse Center and LaFortune. 
"I feel that you shouldn't detract from the clusters for the dorms," she said. 
However, in a simple straw poll taken by student body vice presi­dent Grant chmidt, there weren't any seriators against expanding printer service in dorms.

The top-down approach, she said, examines major infrastruc­ture problems, including the cam­pus' sprinklers. 
"The main change is that [the sprinklers] will all be electronical­ly controlled," said Novick, which she claimed would stop leaks and prevent the sprinklers from com­ing on right after a rainstorm. 
Novick said the bottom-up approach focuses more on indi­vidual efforts by "encouraging faculty and students to change their lifestyles a little bit." 
The bottom-up approach includes activities such as the recent dorm-wide recycling com­petition, which was won by Walsh Hall, who reduced their energy use by 31 percent.

After leaving his post as dean of students, Riehle became the rector of Pangborn Hall in 1973 and served there until 1985. Riehle had previ­ously been rector of Sorin Hall in 1966 and chaplain of Sorin Hall in 1964.

ALBANY -More snow fell Wednesday in paris of the Northeast as utility crews labored to restore service to thousands of customers blacked out by the region's first big snowstorm of the season.

At least 170 dead in Pakistan quake 
Associated Press 

Pakistan -Desperate villagers clawed through piles of mud and timber looking for victims of an earthquake that collapsed thousands of homes in south­western Pakistan before dawn Wednesday, killing at least 170 people. 
Army planes began flying in tents. medical supplies and blankets to the quake zone in Baluchistan province, but some 15,000 homeless people in the impoverished region faced a night in the open in near freezing temperatures fol­lowing the 6.4-magnitude jolt. 
"I have lost everything," said Haji Shahbaz, mourning the deaths of 17 rel­atives in Warn, a hard-hit village. 
"Nothing is left here, and now life is worthless for me," he added. then wailed in despair, tears streaking his dust-caked face. 
Pakistan is no stranger to natural dis­asters, but the quake comes at an espe­cially precarious time for the Muslim country, with the civilian government battling ai-Qaida and Taliban attacks while grappling with a punishing ceo­nomic crisis. 
As the army and other government agencies rushed to provide help, at least three hard-line Islamic organizations also were quick to aid quake survivors, according to an Associated Press reporter who toured the area. 
Among them was Jamaat-ud-Dawa, 
designated a terrorist group by the U.S. government for its links to Muslim sepa­ratists fighting in India's portion of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. 
The group set up relief camps and won friends among survivors of a 7.6­magnitude quake that devastated Kashmir and northern Pakistan in October 2005, killing about 80.000 peo­ple and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. 
Baluchistan is home to a long-running separatist movement, but has so far been spared the level of militant vio­lence seen in the northwestern tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan, where Muslim extremists are strong.

Russell Brand quits BBC afterradioshovvSUSfX11dai 
Associated Press 
1.0 NDON -Every enter­tainer knows there's a fine lirw bntween offbeat and oiTnnsive. Hussell Brand has built a earenr walking it ­but now he may havn slum­bind. 
The wild-haired, motor­mouthed British comedian is rnnowned for risque rou­tinns, wrote a memoir recounting his drug and sex addiction and called President Bush "that retard­ed cowboy fellow" while hosting MTV's Video Music Awards. 
On Wndnesday, Brand quit his BBC radio show after he and fellow performer Jonathan Hoss were sus­pended indefinitely for leav­ing lewd messages on the voicemail of a 78-year-old aetor. Also under threat is the reputation of Britain's state-funded national broad­caster, which allowed Brand's routine to make it to air. 
The calls by Brand and Hoss to actor Andrew Sachs -best known for playing Spanish waiter Manuel in the 1970s Britcorn "Fawlty Towers" -have drawn more than 18,000 complaints. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called the eomrnents "inappropriate and unac­ceptable." 
In the ad-libbed messages, the pair claimed Brand had slept with Sachs' grand­daughter Georgina Baillie, and joked that Sachs might hang himself as a result of the news. Baillie, a 23-year­old burlesque performer, acknowledged she had a sexual relationship with Brand but said the calls to her grandfather were "cruel." 
Tho duo made further calls to Sachs in which they tried to apologize but continued to blurt out lewd messages. The calls were recorded Oct. 16 and aired on Brand's radio show two days later. 
Both Brand and Boss apol­ogized. 
"I am sorry that I upset Mr. Sachs," Brand, 33, told reportnrs outside his London 

home Wndnesday. Boss, 47, 
said he was sorry for his 
"stupid error of judgment." 
BBC director general Mark Thompson made a "personal and unreserved apology" for the "gross lapse of taste by the performers and the pro­duction team." 
lie said the pair would be suspended pending a full report into the affair. 
Brand later said he had decided to resign from his BBC radio program, which attracted 2 million listeners a week. 
"As I only do the radio show to make people laugh, I've decided that given the subsequent coverage I will stop doing the show," he said in a statement. "I got a bit caught up in the moment and forgot that at the core of the rude comments and silly songs were the real feelings of a beloved and brilliant comic actor and a very sweet and big-hearted young woman." 
Several politicians have called on the BBC to fire the pair. Telecommunications regulator Ofcorn said it would investigate whether the calls breached the broadcasting code, which sets standards for fairness and privaey. 
The case is reminiscent of the antics of American "shock jocks" such as Howard Stern -who paid repeated obscenity fines before j urnping to the unreg­ulated haven of satellite radio -or Don Irnus, who was fired from MSNBC and CBS Hadio for making racist and sexist comments about a women's basketball team. There have been numerous incidents of DJ-inspired out­rage in the U.S. In 2002, DJ team Opie and Anthony were fired by CBS Radio after broadcasting a live account of two listeners having sex in New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
Sachs said he did not plan to complain to the police or other authorities.

IN BRIEF 
FDA officials opposed drug suit policy 
WA~HINGTON-Top scientists and career employ­ees at the Food and Drug Administration opposed agency regulations that weaken consumers' ability to sue drug makers, congressional investigators said Wndnesday. 
At issue is language in a drug labeling rule from 2006 that effectively limits when people can sue in state court over injury claims involving medications. The FDA contends federal regulations prevail when there i<> a conflict with state law. This concept is called pre-emption. 
Internal agency documents showed that career offi­cials opposed this approach, according to a report released by Rep. Henry Waxman, chairman of the I louse Oversight and Government Reform Committee. In the past, the agency had viewed private suits as an additional layer of protection against unsafe drugs, the report said. 
"Much of the argument for why we are proposing to invoke pre-emption seems to be based on a false assumption that the FDA approved labeling is fully accurate and up-to-date in a real time basis," the rnport quoted Dr. John Jenkins. who oversees FDA's new drug reviews, as saying. "We know that such an assumption is false." 
Patienl'i injured by drugs have won suits against drug manufacturers for failing to warn against certain dangers. 
World stocks higher as Fed cuts rate 
LONDON -World stock markets ended mostly higher Wednesday but many retreated from their session peaks as investors returned to fretting about corporate earnings in a global recession and a rally on Wall Street fizzled. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve met market expecta­tions by trimming a key interest rate by half a percentage point in a bid to revive the world's largest economy. Global markets surged Tuesday in anticipation of the Fed's move but there appean~d to be only lackluster follow-through. 
Late-session selling sent the Dow Jones indus­trials down 74.16. or 0.82 percent, to end at 8,990.96 after being up nearly 280 points, which would have given them a two-day gain of more than I.H>O points. 
European stock markets dosed mostly higher Wednesday, eatr.hing up with Tuesday's surge on Wall Street that started after European nxehanges had closed.

Rwandan Tutsi-led government denies charges that troops crossed the border, attacked soldiers 
Associated Press 
COMA -Firing wildly, Congolese soldiers comman­deered ears, taxis and motor­bikes Wednesday in a retreat from advancing rebel fighters, joining tens of thousands of ter­ri find refugees struggling to stay ahead of' the violence. 
As gunfire crackled in this eastern provincial capital, the Tutsi rebels said they had reached the outskirts of Goma and declared a unilateral cease­fire to prevent panic as the army retreats and residents flee. 
Congo said Hwandan troops had crossed the border and attacked its soldiers -raising tho spncter that neighboring nations will again be drawn into Congo's war. Hwanda's Tutsi-led government immedi­ately denied the charge, but Congo turned to Angola for help defending its territory. 
As tlw chaos mounted, the

A rebel statement said their fighters were just outside Goma. 
"We are not far from Goma," rebel leader Laurent Nkunda was quoted as saying on the BBC's Web site. "But because there is a state of destabiliza­tion in the town we deeided ... unilaterally to proclaim a cease-fire." 
Nkunda, who has ignored calls by the Security Council to respect a U.N.-brokered truce signed in January, ealled on government forces to follow suit. 
The U.N. says its biggest peacekeeping mission -a 17,000-strong force -is now stretched to the limit with the surge in fighting and needs more troops quickly. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Uruguay and South Africa are the main contributors to the existing force. 
But hopes for immediate baekup from the European Union dimmed. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Wednesday the EU had considered sending troops to reinforce the peaeekeepers in

CAMPAIGN NEWS 
Obama on prime-time; McCain criticizes 
MIAMI -Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama plunked down $4 million for a cam­paign-closing television ad Wednesday night, sum­moning voters to "choose hope over fear and unity over division" in Tuesday's election. Republican John McCain derided the event as a "gauzy, feel­good commercial," paid for with broken promises. 
"America, the time for change has come,"Obama said in the fmal moments of the unusual ad, a blend of videotaped moments and a live appearance before thousands in Sunrise, Fla. 
"In six days we can choose an economy that rewards work and creates jobs and fuels prosperity starting with the middle class," Obama said. 
The 30-minute ad. aired on CBS. NBC. Fox and several cable networks, came just days from the end of a race in which Obama holds the lead in polls nationally as well as in most key battleground states as he bids to become the first black presi­dent. 
Hepublieans and even some Democrats said the race was tightPning as it neared the end. And while Obama made no mention of McCain in his paid tele­vision ad. both men sharpnned their rhetoric during the day. 
Palin suggesls she will be a GOP fixture 
TOLEDO, Ohio -Facing the unhappy prospect of dp({mt, Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin indicatPd Wednesday that she will not disappear from the national political scene if the GOP tickPt IOSPs on Tuesday. 
"Absolutely not. I think that, if I were to give up and wave a white flag of surrender against some of the political shot<> that we've taken, that ... that would ... bring this whole ... I'm not doing this for naught," Palin said in an interview with ABC News, according to excerpts of a transcript released by the television network. 
Palin was steadfast in saying Republican presi­dential nominee John McCain would defeat Democrat Barack Obama. 
''I'm just ... thinking that it's gonna to go our way on Tuesday, Nov. 4. I truly believe that the wisdom of ... of the people will be revealed on that day. As they enter that voting booth, they will understand the stark contrast between the two tickets," the Ala<>ka governor said. 
In addition to the interview, Palin delivered a poli­cy address in which she called for a "clean break" from the Bu.<>h administration's energy policies. She said the White House plans rely too much on importing foreign oil. 
Democrats dominate early voting 
WASHINGTON -Democrats are dominat­ing early voting in six key states President Bush won four years ago, forcing Republican .John McCain to play catch-up even before Election Day arrives. 
Democrats outnumber Republicans among early voters in Iowa, North Carolina, Florida, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada, accord­ing to statistics from election and party offi­cials in those states. Bush won all six in 2004, and McCain needs to win most of them to claim the White House this year. 
Georgia, another red state, doesn't track early voters by party, but it does by race. About 1.4 million Georgians have already cast ballots, and blacks are voting in dispro­portionate numbers. Black voters over­whelmingly support Democrat Barack Obama, who is bidding to become the nation's first black president. 
Values issues highlight state ballots 
Voters can decide thier states' position on issues like abortion and gay marriage 
Associated Press 

Social issues so volatile that the presidential cam­paigns sidestepped them will be on the ballots in several states next week, including measures that would criminalize most abortions, outlaw affirma­tive action and ban same­sex marriage in California, one of only three states that allows it. 
In all, there are 153 pro­posals on ballots in 36 states. 
In Washington, voters will decide whether to join Oregon as the only states offering terminally ill peo­ple the option of physician­assisted suicide. Massachusetts has three distinctive measures on its ballot -to ban dog racing, ease marijuana laws and scrap the state income tax, a step that could unleash budgetary tumult. 
The main presidential rivals, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain. have rarely made proactive·comments during the campaign about same-s!')x marriage or affirmative action -issues on which the public is deeply divided. Abortion also has seemed like an uncomfortable topic for them at times, although Obama makes clear he supports abortion rights and McCain says he would like to ban most abortions. 
But in a half-dozen states, these three issues are front and center. 
Florida, Arizona and California have constitu­tiona! amendments on their ballots that would limit marriage to a man and a woman. More than two-dozen states have pre­viously approved such amendments, but none were in California's situa­tion -with same-sex mar­riage legal since a state Supreme Court decision in May and thousands of gay and lesbian couples already wed. 
The rival camps view the California vote in epic terms, with the outcome of Proposition 8 having enor­mous influence on 
prospects for same-sex marriage rights in other states. 
"If we lose California, if they defeat the marriage amendment, I'm afraid that the culture war is over and Christians have lost," said Donald Wildmon, founder of the American Family Association. "California is a big dam, holding back the flood -and if you take down the dam in California, it's going to flood 49 other states." 
Obama is expected to win easily in California, but the vote on Proposition 8 is expected to be close. Of keen interest to both sides is how churchgoing black and Hispanic voters -in general a pro-Obama constituency -will vote on the ballot measure. 
Both Obama and McCain say they oppose same-sex marriage. But Obama, unlike McCain, opposes Proposition 8 and endorses the concept of broader rights for same-sex cou­ples. 
Gay rights also is an issue in Arkansas, where a ballot measure would pro­hibit unmarried couples from adopting or being foster parents. Conservatives backing the idea say it's aimed at same-sex couples, who are able to adopt and be foster parents in most states. 

Abortion is a dominant campaign topic in South Dakota, which has an ini­tiative that would ban the procedure except in cases of rape, incest and serious health threat to the moth­er. A tougher law without the rape and incest excep­tions was defeated in 2006; a recent poll on the new version showed a dead heat. 
Colorado has a "person­hood" amendment on its ballot that would define human life as beginning at fertilization. It doesn't explicitly mention abor­tion, but activists on both sides in the campaign view it as a blunt challenge to abortion rights -so blunt that the National Right to Life Committee, Colorado's Roman Catholic bishops and some other anti-abor­tion groups have declined 
to endorse it on strategic grounds. 
Some of those skeptical of the idea believe it would run aground in legal chal­lenges. Abortion-rights activists contend it would -if approved -potential­ly lead to the banning of certain types of birth con­trol. 
Colorado and Nebraska have proposals that would ban race-and gender­based affirmative action, similar to measures previ­ously approved in California, Michigan and Washington. The man spearheading the move­ment, California activist­businessman Ward Connerly, says the candi­dacies of Obama, Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin prove blacks and women no longer need affirmative action. 
"Anyone who raises $150 million in one month is being judged pretty much on the basis of their politi­cal abilities and not on the basis of race," Connerly said of Obama during a debate in Nebraska last week. 

SOUND BYTE: HEALTH CARE 
What will you do to improve the health care system? 
"My health care plan will make sure insur­ance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most. If you have health insurance, the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums. If you don't have health insurance, you'll be able to get the same kind ofhealth insurance that Members ofCongress get for themselves. " 

''To use their money effectively, Americans need more choices. We should give additional help to those who face particularly expensive care. !fit is done right and the additional money is there, insurance companies will com­pete for these patients -not turn them away. It is a challenge to develop techniques that allo­cate the right amount to each ofthese fami­

He was a mostly unknown Arkansas governor at the time, and made a strong enough pitch on values and compassion to win the contest. (MeCain came in fourth). I'm not sure any­body thought that he was going to be the runner-up in the GOP contest even with the win, surviving the deadly Republican National Convention primary system clear into March. 
Then, I walked a block or two down to a small diner, where Rudy Guiliani answered questions and signed autographs. Even as late as last Christmas, a lot of the smart money pegged him as the nominee. He had chosen to use Florida as his first (and last) stand in the process. The effectiveness of that position was more or less summed up 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
In response to the various abortion arguments gracing the Viewpoint's pages these cold fall days, all it really shows is the obvious discord between beliefs in this country. I thought an opinion from experi­enee would be useful to throw into the mix. 
I am a mother. I have faced the "choice." There are no words to express the flood of emotions which fill a woman when she di<;covers she is pregnant, especially at such a young age. From happiness to fear, it ranges across the spectrum. 
Overall, I agree with Mary Da.ly's opinion ("For Clarification," Oct. 28) when she says, "A pregnant woman who fmds her­self in a position in which abortion seems the only answer ... is not being afforded the right to choose." 
Unfortunately, in today's society, that is often the case. I have held a staunch pro­life view throughout my life, but not unti.l you are faced with the issue at hand do you truly question your beliefs. I will admit, abortion was an option, and a high­ly considered option for me the first few days. 
When one is flooded with ideas of today's norm of leading life (i.e. college, when a native Iowan shouted out "Why 
aren't you showing Iowa any love?" That 
was tough for even America's mayor to 
answer. It also probably explains why he 
finished behind Hon Paul. 
I.ater that evening, I watehed John Edwards in a middle school gym. His strat­egy, more or less, W<L'> to come out ahead or dose to ahead in Iowa as a result of vote splitting between the two superstar candi­dates, Clinton and Obama. I Ie ended up finishing second, edging Clinton out by no more than one percent. With his recent recreational activities exposed, I still shud­der to think what would have happened had he been the nominee. 
The next morning, on the way out of Des Moines, we stopped to see Baraek Obama speak in an elementary school auditorium. I had heard of him, like many others, after his 2004 DNC speech, but had not followed him or even knew what his chances were. Everyone figured Clinton would win any­how. But, we were intrigued and decided it was worth checking out. Uttle did we know that in a few days Iowa would shoek political circles, allowing Obama to draw first blood against the Clinton Machine. 
Of course, since then, there has been no lack of surprises and upheava.ls in thn political world. Some of these were com­pletely external; common knowledge through the spring indicated that Iraq would weigh heaviest on voter's minds. Who would have thought the global eeono­my would implode dramatically over a matter ofweeks? 
Other surprises were intentional. The GOP VP pick, for instance, comes to mind. Who saw that coming? Add to the mix "Joe Six Pack," Joe the Plumber and Joe "Foot in Mouth" Biden, and you could have a primetime sitcom. 
In all seriousness, the political education I received over the last year has provided more insight into the way America works 
I have chosen 
job, marriage, promotion, then children) and the more-common-than-not shame afforded to unwed mothers in our society, I felt very alone when, with a single deci­sion, I was ripped from that norm into a life-track of my own. This loneliness directed me to consider abortion; however, after a night of tears and prayer, that "ehoice" was forever deleted from my mind. 
What made me decide not to partake in this option given to me? It came down to one word: support. !learned of the sup­port offered to me by my family and friends. I discovered the support given to me by the University. I supported myself by knowing I could be a mother and still reach all the goals in my life. 
Too often today are women like me faced with the same decision and not given the support they need in order to know that abortion, while a legal choice, is actually the worst choice available to them. While I feel that this nation is a long way from making abortion illega.l again based on a rights disagreement, we should be focusing on making less and less women feel the need to terminate a preg­nancy because she feels there is no other than any book or course ever could. In some c&<;es, it was exporionce, such going up to Iowa or voluntoering to eanv<L'>S, that provided first hand insight into how a polit­iealfbllowing is built. In others, it W<L'> all the infiwmation gleannd from watd1ing CNN, or li>llowing tlw New York Times commentators. Most importrnltly, though, it was probably the argumnnL'> with my friends over such important issuos that helped me to darify my worldview and see how it lit with the way tlw world eurrnntly works. 
N! ofthis, however, lnd me to conclude that voting in and of iL<;elf is tantamount to being an American. Voting is the eonstitu­tional right of the people to change the face of America every time thny step to the bal­lot box, and one that should not bn volun­tarily given up. I understand that it is hard to justify voting <L'> a Demoerat in a deeply Hed state or visa versa, but I don't think this provid11s a rn&'>on not to do so. The vote is the strongest political statement one can make, regardless of how it tigurns into the bigger picture. It should not be taken lightly. 
So, let me send you oil", in my l&'>t eolumn of the election se<L'>on, with the charge to vote. Ifthe absnntee ballot is sitting on your desk, dose it up and drop it in the mailbox. If you are mgistnrnd horn in Indiana, brave the lines and make your voice heard on Tuesday. Make sure you remind your friends and family. Hegardless of who wins the raee, America wins if everyone partici­pates. Plus, as Bob Sehieffer reminded us in the third debate, voting "will make you feel big and strong."

choice. 
How? Support, and unlimitHd amount<; of it. I still believe abortion is the murder of an innoeent life, but I now understand how a woman can tee! so trapped that she feels there is no other option available. Now, after going through the most difficult nine months of my life, I have a beautiful one-year-old daughter who never stops smiling, a wonderful fiance I am marrying next spring, high grades in school, a promising internship next summer and the most fulfilling life I eould have ever imagined. 
I do hope, as lindsey Schwartz ("Who has the 'Right to Life'?" Oct. 13) pointed out, that no one is put into the situation that I was; however, know that the choice you make can lead you to be the happiest you have ever been. I look at my daughter and tears fill my eyes with the thought that I might have never seen her big, beautiful, blue eyes with a "choice" I almost made.

We're back and the doors to .. the dining hall are flung open ~ once again, so it's time to get back to work finding good things to eat. Hopefully a week off has put a shine back on the offerings of North and South, but if not 
: here are some ideas to keep you going, so dig in! This week's recipes: 
Pitas with Garbanzo Beans and Spinach 
There is something about pitas that just makes them fun, so stuff away! Spinach has gotten a bad name, probably because it is often served over-cooked, but don't give in to the association. It has a great flavor and is a good shake up from the usual lettuce. Garbanzo beans (the stars of many Middle Eastern foods such as hummus and falafels) with their nutty flavor are a good source of protein. 
Fill a bowl with spinach, gar­banzo beans, mushrooms, feta cheese (Not a feta fan? Try blue cheese, or even sprinkle on a bunch of the parmesan from the pizza area.) and red onion. 
Mix a dab of Dijon mustard into red wine vinegar and pour over the contents of the bowl. You can squeeze some lemon on top as well, if that is to your taste. (Too much work? You can actually just toss a dab of Dijon mustard on the top, pour over the vinegar and mix it later.) 
If you want a hot pita, stop by the microwave and zap it for about 1 minute. If you're in more of a crunchy and fresh mood, just leave it as is. 
Make sure everything is well mixed and cut into bite sized pieces. Sprinkle with pepper. 
Stuff the mixture into the pitas. 
Black Bean and Bacon Salad 
Lettuce is hardly a require­ment for a salad. This one is based around black beans, a bunch of other yummy vegeta­bles and of course, bacon. There isn't much that beats bacon, is there? 
Fill a bowl with black beans, shredded carrot (or dice up a couple of carrot sticks). diced tomatoes, red onion and corn. 
Add a little red wine vinegar, but not too much, you don't want to overwhelm this one. 
Pick up a couple slices of bacon from the sandwich area 
(or hot from the breakfast area if it is early enough in the day). Shred and mix into the other ingredients. 
Warm up the bowl in the microwave for about a minute. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. You can try adding in some ranch dressing for another taste. 
Quick Tip 

Have a favorite sandwich you always make? Try transferring the same ingredients to a wrap. a pita, or even just some of the nicer breads you have t.o slice yourself. It will make a tried and true dish a little more special. Don't forget the pickle! 
Have your own dining hall recipe? We would love to feature it! E-mail mfordice@nd. edu.

Associated Press 

AUBURN HILLS Michael Curry wants the Detroit Pistons to project a new image, consistently attacking on offense and playing hard on defense. 
After Game One, it's a work in progress. 
The Detroit Pistons played well enough to build big leads only to allow the Indiana Pacers to rally before beating them 100­94 Wednesday night in the opener for both teams. 
Curry, though, can't fault the effort he saw in his debut as a head coach. 
"If you get a big lead, NBA teams are going to come back on you because they're too good," Curry said. "The key is minimiz­ing their runs and we did that." 
Tayshaun Prince had 19 points, Richard Hamilton scored 15, Chauncey Billups added 13 points and seven assists, and Walter Herrmann had 10 points to help Detroit's reserves easily outscore their counterparts. 
Danny Granger led the new-look Pacers with 33 points and got some help from new teammates T.J. Ford, Jarrett Jack and Rasho Nesterovic. 
Indiana had seven more turnovers and nine fewer offensive rebounds than Detroit. 
IN BRIEF Artest debuts in Rocket 
victory over Grizzlies 
HOUSTON -Since acquiring Ron Artest in the offseason, the Houston Rockets have talked boldly about contending for the NBA champi­onship. They have plenty of improvements to make before that happens. 
Yao Ming had 21 points and 10 rebounds, Artest added 16 in his Houston debut, and the Rockets overcame poor shooting to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 82-71 on Wednesday night. 
Luis Scola had 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Rockets, who were 28-for-76 (36.8 percent) from the field. They also went 5-for-16 from 3-point range and were outrebound­ed 49-44. 
"It was ugly," said Artest, who went 6-of-14 from the field. "But if it means we're 1-0, then we'll take it." 
Rudy Gay scored 20 and Darrell Arthur had 11 points and 15 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who've lost all eight season openers since moving to Memphis in 2001. 
"The difference in the game was the turnover dif­ferential and the offensive glass," Pacers coach Jim O'Brien said. "We shot 50 percent and we got to the line 13 times more than they did, but we shot our­selves in the foot." 
Just eight of the 15 play­ers on Indiana's opening­night roster were on the team at the end of last sea­son. 
The Pistons planned to shake up their core ­which helped them win a championship in 2004 and advance to six straight Eastern Conference finals -but they ended up standing pat and counting on Curry along with an 
influx of youth to  take  
them back  to  the  NBA  
fmals.  

Expectations are rela­tively low for Detroit after getting eliminated in Game 6 of conference finals the past three seasons. 
The Pistons have provid­ed fodder for doubters with inconsistent play and arro­gant attitudes that have stunted their potential. 
"We've earned the right for people to ask, 'Has this team made their last run?' We've earned the right [for people] to ask if we're going to be able to get it with the few changes we've made," Curry said. "We have to reassure ourselves, first and foremost." 

Utah outlasts Denver in 
Western Conference duel SALT LAKE CITY -Carlos Boozer had 25 points and 14 rebounds and Andrei Kirilenko added 16 points in his new reserve role and the Utah Jazz opened the season with a 98-94 win over the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night. Mehmet Okur had 13 points and 10 rebounds and Ronnie Price finished with five assists start­ing in place of Deron Williams, who is out with a sprained ankle. Denver rallied from a 14-point deficit to tie it in the fourth quarter, but couldn't overtake the Jazz, who went 13-for-16 from the foul line in the final period to hold on. Allen Iverson had 18 points and eight assists to lead the Nuggets, who were missing star Carmelo Anthony while he served the first of a two-game suspension from a DUI arrest over the summer. 
Hagman's goal lifts 
Maple Leafs over Devils 
Nf:WARK, N.J. -Niklas Hagman pulled out a move he worked on in practice to beat Martin Brodeur in the shootout. 
Hagman scored on a nifty back­hand in the fourth round to give the Toronto Maple Leafs a 6-5 win over Brodeur and the New Jersey Devils on Wednesday night. 
Hagman came in very tight on Brodeur, whipping home the deciding goal while showering the goalie with a spray of ice shavings. 
"I decided I was going to try something else and I felt pretty confident with it," Hagman said, "I didn't want to put snow in his face. That's why I felt a little bad. I didn't want to celebrate too much. I didn't want to be cocky." 
After Hagman gave Toronto a 2-1 shootout lead, Vesa Toskala secured the win with a blocker save on Jamie Langenbrunner.

Oden sidelined 
with injured foot 
Trail Blazers star to miss two to four weeks 
Associated Press 
PORTLAND, Ore. Portland Trail Blazers center Greg Oden will miss two to four weeks because of an injury to his right foot. 
The team said Wednesday that MRI and computerized axial tomography scans con­firmed Oden has a mid-later­al foot sprain. 
Oden, who missed all of last season after knee surgery, injured his foot in the first quarter of the Blazers' 96-76 season-opening loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night. 
"I was trying to go get a rebound, and kind of came down on Derek Fisher's foot on like the third play of the game. I kind of fell and didn't think twice about it," he said after the game. 
Oden missed four field goals and two free throws in 13 minutes of play. 
The 7-foot center was the top pick in the 2007 draft. But even before his rookie season started, it was post­poned by microfracture sur­gery on his right knee. 
Trail Blazers coach Nate McMillan had not yet heard of the MRI results when he addressed reporters Wednesday at the team's practice facility in Tualatin, Ore. 
"You don't want injuries, and he's worked so hard throughout this summer to get himself back," McMillan said. "And we tried to do everything we could to get him ready for the season and the opener, and he steps on a guy's foot." 
Blazers guard Brandon Roy, who also spoke before the tests were complete, said the team will prepare to move forward without Oden for Friday night's home opener against San Antonio. 
"I feel bad for him," Roy said. "I know this is a big year for him and he had a lot on his shoulders." 
Oden's first game was high­ly anticipated by Blazers fans, who had waited a long time to see the top draft pick. The team had not had a No. 1 pick since 1978, when they chose center Mychal Thompson of Minnesota. 
After he was held out last season, Oden rolled his ankle in the first practice of the fall. That injury wasn't seri­ous, however. 
At Ohio State, Oden aver­aged 15.7 points and 9.6 rebounds, but Oden struggled with a wrist injury. He led the Buckeyes to the national championship game, scoring 25 points and grabbing 12 rebounds in the loss to Florida. 
NFL 
Wilfork fined for hit on Cutler 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -New England defensive tackle Vince Wilfork will be fined but not suspend­ed by the NFL after meeting with commissioner Roger Goodell about a hit on Denver quarterback Jay Cutler, a per­son familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
The Patriots nose tackle met Tuesday with Goodell and the commissioner decided to forgo a possible suspension. That's according to a person familiar with the case who asked for anonymity because there has been no official announcement. 
The NFL declined comment, noting that fines and suspen­sions normally are announced on Fridays. 
Wilfork was summoned before Goodell after the Broncos claimed tape of New England's 41-7 win Oct. 20 showed Wilfork elbowing Cutler in the helmet. 
However, the tapes that were reviewed during the hearing did not show that clearly, upholding New England's contention there was no intent to injure. They 
also showed Wilfork helping up Cutler and patting him on the back after the play. 
Wilfork was fined a total of $35,000 last season for four different episodes. They included hits on Buffalo quar­terback J.P. Losman and Dallas tight end Jason Witten. He also was fined for putting a finger inside the facemask of New York Giants running back Brandon Jacobs and grabbing the facemask of San Diego's Michael Turner dur­ing the AFC championship game. 
Wilfork has played for the Patriots since being drafted in the first round out of Miami in 2004. 
He said Wednesday that he didn't know what the outcome of the meeting would be, but felt the session was produc­tive. 
"I think both sides were happy," Wilfork said. "lie got a chance to hear my side of my story of how I approach the game. I got a chance to hear what he had to say about the whole situation of my past history and playing football and all that good stuff. So I think we both left pretty happy."

ished with 13 points. 
Etan Thomas played in his first real NBA game since an April ;{O, 2007, playoff loss to Clnveland. Thomas missed all of last season after having open­heart surgery, but he looked lit and aggressive Wednesday and f'inished with 10 points and eight rebounds. 
The Wizards are opening the season without Arenas, who is recovering from a third opera­tion on his left knee in 1 1/2 years. When healthy, he is the Wizards' top scorer, most cre­ative player and go-to option when they need a buzznr-beat­er. They certainly could have used him whiiH managing to score only one field goal in last 6 minutes Wednesday. 
Arenas has offered varying estimates for when he might be back this season, and Washington coach Eddie Jordan was vague when asked about his star's rehabilitation. 
"No timetable. Due process. lie's on course. He's disciplined about it. lie's diligent about it,"Jordan said. "And we'll just have to see as it goes along." 
During a glittery prngame ceremony, Arenas was not introduced to the crowd. When play began, he sat on the side­line wearing a sports coat and brightly colored foullard. A row behind Arenas was eenter Brendan llaywood, who had a breakthrough 2007-OH season but nended surgery on his right wrist this month and eould be out for the season. 
Nnither team looked quite ready to go in a first half that lacked any rhythm and nnded with Washington leading 46-44. 
In the third quarter, Washington wont on 10-0 run, with half the points seored by Antonio Daniels. to takn a 62-5H lead with 4:14 left. But Hayes carne in to score live consecu­tivn points -with a back­ground of boos -and put tlw Nets back in front. 

Keyon Dooling scornd the last four points of the third quarter to give Nnw Jersey a 69-67 edge heading to the fourth. 
Tho Wizards' last lead was 75-74 with H:17 left, and New Jersey end11d the game on a 21­10 run. 
The Nets returned only one starter from last season's open­ing-night roster: Carter, of course. Overall, only three cur­rent players-Carter, Josh Boone and Scan Williams ­were on the roster at thn start of last season, the fewest num­ber of holdovers in franchise history. 
That is why Frank said he's installed less than half of his offense. 
"We're not going to be a fin­ished product now," he said. "This is going to be an evolving thing -dean up and improve and continue to put in things whenever the group is ready for it. We have hardly anything in." 
Still, on this night, it was enough. 
Atlanta 99, Orlando 85 
Jon Johnson scornd 25 points, including nine in the fourth quarter, to help the Atlanta Hawks hold off a late Orlando rally for a 99-85 win Wednesday night in the season opener for both teams. 
Dwight Howard had 22 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Magie, who lost their home opener for only the second time in the last nine seasons. Mickael Pietrus added 20 points. 
Josh Smith chipped in 17 for the Hawks. 
Orlando had a better road than home record last season in winning 52 games, and one of the Magic's priorities this sea­son was doing a better job defending their home court. 
The Magic, expected to con­tend with Boston and Detroit for the Eastern Conference title, fizzled more than sizzled, shooting only 37 percent. Atlanta led by as many as 19 before Orlando got within seven points in the final minute, but Mike Bibby hit three free throws after a flagrant foul by Hedo Turkoglu to seal the victo­ry. 
Orlando struggled early, mak­ing only three of its first 18 shots. Howard, who moments before tipoff told the crowd, "We're going to be something special this year," was anything but in the first half, missing 
four of his  first  five  shots,  
including  two  that  were  
blocked.  

Howard finished strongly, scoring 12 points in the fourth quarter. lie had his familiar struggle from the free throw line, going 6-for-13. 
Atlanta dominated on the boards early, and held the Magic without a point for nearly six minutes near the end of the first quarter in building a 23-8 lead. Hashard Lewis, Pietrus and backup point guard Anthony Johnson, who threw an alley-oop to Pietrus for a dunk, keyed a second quarter run that cut Atlanta's halftime lead to 4 7-40.

NBA 
Thunder falter in franchise debut 
Three Bucks score 20 in opening night win 
Associated Press 
OKLAHOMA CITY -A block party filled the street with fans in blue Oklahoma City Thunder shirts. NBA commissioner David Stern walked to midcourt and welcomed the city to the league. A banner was unfurled with the team's new logo. 
Then the ball was tipped off and the celebration promptly ended. 
Michael Redd, Richard Jefferson and Charlie Villanueva each scored 20 points and the Milwaukee Bucks gave Oklahoma City's sellout crowd little hope about by spoiling the Thunder's debut with a 98-87 win on Wednesday night. 
The Bucks were in control from the start, taking their first double-digit lead by the midway point or the first quarter, and they gave the 19,136 in atten­dance little to cheer about until it was too late. 
"We had to come out hitting. That was the whole goal tonight was to come out fast," Redd said. "We knew we were in a hostile environment." 
Oklahoma City started 2-for-12 from the field and never led, falling behind 20-9 and then watching Rookie of the Year Kevin Durant come out of the game with early foul trouble. 
Even when he returned, it did­n't make a difference. Durant was held scoreless in the first half, and instead it was Redd that broke through first. 
Coming off a 30-point per­formance a night earlier, Redd hit his first 3-pointer and then stole the ball from Durant for a fast-break layup during a 10-1 run that pushed the Bucks' lead to 39-21. 
By then, any electricity from the crowd had been turned off. 
"We were just hoping that if they were playing on a lot of emotion early in the game that we'd be able to weather it," said Bucks coach Scott Skiles, who got his first win with his new team. "And they were. I think that probably sometimes these kind of events can weigh on the home team a little bit also and we were able to take advantage of it." 
Andrew Bogut added 14 points and Bell scored 11 for Milwaukee. Villanueva also had 12 rebounds. 
Chris Wilcox led Oklahoma City with 15 points off the bench, first-round pick Russell Westbrook scored 13 in his debut and Durant finished with 12 on 5-for-14 shooting. 
"I thought the atmosphere was definitely great," Wilcox said. "We had a lot of fans here, fan support. and I think if we get that night in and night out, a lot of games that we struggle, down the stretch we will come out with." 
The Thunder had too big of a deficit for their excitable crowd to really play a factor. 
Jefferson, Redd and Villanueva each hit 3-pointers early in the second half as the Bucks had lit­tle trouble against a Thunder defense that was the fourth­worst in the league last season. The lead grew to 71-47 after Villanueva scored off the Bucks' fourth offensive rebound of the same possession and then he and Jefferson combined to hit four free throws. 
Westbrook got Oklahoma City within 90-79 when he capped a 20-8 run with a 3-pointer from the right wing with 5:11 remain­ing, but Redd scored an easy layup underneath sparked a seven-point spurt that put the game away for Milwaukee. 
"For one night at least, it came together well for us," Skiles said. 
Johan Petro had the Thunder's first official shot with a missed jumper from the left wing, and Bogut made the first basket of the game, 39 seconds in. Earl Watson had Oklahoma City's first points on a layup 13 sec­onds later.

Stoudemire 

broke a tie game with 2:53 to go with a three-point play. 
"Amare was huge for us down the stretch," Porter said. "[Nash] also made a couple of big plays. It was a solid win for us and just a great way to start the sea­son." 
After Raja Bell stole the ball away from Duncan on the other end of the court, Stoudemire quickly scored on a fastbreak on an assist from Nash to give Phoenix a 99-94 lead with 2:31 remaining. 
The turnover and quick basket angered Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who was 12­0 in season-opening games. 
"It was the worst transition defense I've seen in years," Popovich said. "I can't imag­ine how bad it was. 
"Several people made poor decisions in the game down the stretch. It was very disap­pointing." 
Bell stole the ball on a Duncan pass. Bell fired the ball to Nash, who set up Stoudemire for an easy layup. 
Phoenix led 101-98 with less than a minute remaining, but Parker missed a 3-pointer with 39 seconds left before Duncan missed his try. 
Once again the Spurs employed the Hack-a-Shaq that helped them last season in the playoffs. During the preseason, O'Neal called Popovich's liberal use of the Hack-a-Shaq during the first round last season "a coward move." 
Popovich poked fun at O'Neal in the opening seconds of the ballgame when Michael Finley grabbed the big center away from the ball a scant five seconds into the game. O'Neal laughed when he looked over to the Spurs bench and saw Popovich smil­ing while giving two thumbs up. 
"I thought it was funny ­bring a little humor to the game," Duncan said. 
It got more serious before halftime when the Spurs employed the Hack-a-Shack four times in the final 1:26 with Phoenix leading 46-40. 
Even though O'Neal made 5-of-8, the Spurs were able to cut the Suns' lead to 49-46 at halftime. 
Before the grabbing and pulling was done, O'Neal got tangled with Ime Udoka. Udoka was motioning to the official that he was going to foul O'Neal, and O'Neal raised his left arm toward Udoka and sent the Spurs defender flat onto the floor. Udoka was called for the foul and O'Neal made both shots.

Big East 
continued from page 24 
"Georgetown knew what was at stake today," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "It was a big game for their program, and they were very ready. To win the Big East two years in a row is a big accomplishment. It would be nicE~ to win it out­right this year." 
Leading the way for Notre Dame W11dnesday was forward .feb Brovsky who tallied both Irish goals. The first came in the 24th minute when, after receiving a pass from fellow forward Bright Dike, Brovsky slipped past a defender and tired past (;eorgetown km~per Matthew Brutto. 
Al'ter l'el!~r Grasso tied the game for the lloyas in the 53rd minute, Brovsky put Notre Dame back in front almost immediately. The soph­omore was the first to rise and get connect with a Jack Traynor free kick heading the ball past Brutto. Brovsky's game winning goal was his fifth tally of the season. 
"Both goals from Jeb were very good," Clark said. "The second goal was a great ball from .Jack Traynor, and the first goal was very well-taken. Jeb is arguably our most clini­cal finisher. He's developing into a first class player." 
What made Brovsky's goals even more impressive was whom they came against. Georgetown entered Wednesday's game with a miniscule 0.58 goals against avnrage, and Brovsky's goals were the first time an oppo­nent has found the back of the net against Brutto in 763 min­utes this season. 

Brovsky's tallies also helped the Irish break out of a mini­scoring slump. In their two games over Fall Break, Notre 
Dame scored only  one  goal  
against  Seton  Hall  and  
Connecticut.  Clark  was  

encouraged but not totally pleased by the team's effort on Wednesday. 
"Against Seton Hall, every­thing was there but the finish­ing," Clark said. "Against Connecticut, we had more of the game than we've ever had there, but to be fair, we didn't generate many scoring chances. There was some good buildup today, but the finish­ing still wasn't there to be honest. 
"We had three one-on-ones with their keeper in the sec­ond half, and we missed all three of them. That wasn't good, but in retrospect it was good because we had to fight to the end learning how to manage a tight game." 
There was one downer for Notre Dame Wednesday after­noon as starting goalie Andrew Quinn had to leave the game part way through the second half. In the 72nd minute, Quinn made a diving save, but he landed awkward­ly injuring his shoulder in the process. 
After the game, Clark said that the team would have a better idea of the extent of Quinn's injury after he gets an MRI, but Quinn will be out for at least a few weeks. Junior goalie Phillip Tuttle will start in his place.

helped out," he said. 

The freshman from Saint Paul, Minn. hauled in his team leading fifth touchdown against Washington to set a record for freshman receivers. He is also only one catch away from breaking sophomore Duval Kamara's freshman receptions record. 
The fast start for one of the most impressive freshmen classes in the country is due in a big way to the camaraderie thfl team was able to develop before they came to campus. 
"We were already close enough so when we're work­ing out and pushing one another you're not like, 'Ok who's this guy pushing me,' it's more like 'Ok this is my team­mate, this is my buddy, so we were able to all push one another pretty hard," Rudolph said. 
The class knew long before they arrived that they had the chance to be something spe­cial. That's why none of the recruits, who had their pick of the nation's top colleges, backed down even after the dismal 3-9 season in 2007. Several players said they were asked relentlessly if they would change their minds, but they all had the same response -no way.

MIAA), Schroeder-Biek guided her team to a winning record and a fourth-place conference finish; smothering defense and superlative play from Slupczynski have been the deciding factors in the team's success throughout the season. 
"We need to build on that success," Schroeder-Biek said. "The players are well aware of what it will take to get to where we want to be. We want to be playing for a championship." 
Saint Mary's is off until the first round of the MIAA Tournament. With the fourth place finish, the Belles will host No. 5 seed Adrian in the first round of the tournament at Saint Mary's Angela Athletic Facility on Tuesday at 7 p.m .

Biting the Big East 

Irish clinch share of league title with win 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 

It may have been the biggest game in Georgetown's recent program history, but it was Notre Dame who made the statement Wednesday al'ter­noon with a 2-1 victory at Alumni Field. 
Only two points behind the Irish entering the game, the Hoyas arrived in South Bend eyeing their first ever Big East Blue Division title. With the victory, the Irish not only denied Georgetown that accomplishment, but they also clinched at least a share of the Big East Blue Division title for the second consecutive season -Notre Dame shared the title with Connecticut in 2007.

Highly touted freshman class beginning to show promise

By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 

More than half of Notre Dame's freshmen class met each other on January 5, 2008. 
15 of the team's 27 freshmen were invited to San Antonio that week for the Army All­America Bowl for graduating high school players. 
"We spent that week together down there and we kind of had our Notre Dame group and then there was everyone else," tight end Kyle Rudolph said. "I think that played a more role in our class coming so close together." 
The highly-touted group con­tinued to stay in touch with one another throughout the sum­mer to talk about how excited they were to get to South Bend and get things rolling. Once they arrived, they didn't waste much time. 
Rudolph is only one of several freshmen who have played a major role in Notre Dame's 5-2 start this season. lie has been listed as the No. 1 tight end since week one and currently has 14 catches for 166 yards and two touchdowns. 
Those numbers make him the second leading freshman receiver on the team behind wide receiver Michael Floyd. Floyd, who has 31 catches for 533 yards, was also in San Antonio at the All-America Bowl.

Belles one goal short again 
By ALEX BARKER 
Sports Writer 

Once again, the Saint Mary's found itself in a very tightly contested match. But, once again, they came up just one goal short. 
Saint Mary's endured its third consecutive one-goal loss falling 2-1 against con­ference foe Albion Wndnesday afternoon. 
A first half headlined by great defensive play yielded only one goal for Albion which came with just three minutes remaining before halftime. 
The Belles came out with a quick answer in the 51st minute off the foot of junior forward Micki Bedinger. Jledinger received a pass from fellow junior Sam Smogor and slid it past tho Briton keP.per to knot the game at one. 
IlowP-ver, the Saint Mary's resurgence was quickly matched when Albion eoun­tered with a goal of its own in the 58th minute. 
Junior Patty Duffy had another solid game in goal for the Belles recording five saves. Duffy has made 77 saves on the season. 
This loss brings the Bc1lles' season record to 2-12-1 over­all and 1-7 in MlAA play. Saint Mary's finishes eighth in the conference, good enough to clinch the final spot in the postseason tour­nament. 
In his lirst season as Belles head coach, Hyan Crabbe has had his work eut out for him taking over such a young and inexperienced team. Thn freshman class lc~d by KatPiyn Tondo-Steelf~'s two goals and one assist has contributnd about hall' of the offensive production this scmson.

STORY BY KAITLYNN RIELY
PoUsters and pundits are making predictions about the outcome of the presidential election, but for all the pontificating, one of the biggest Election Day uncertainties is whether the "youth vote," young people between the ages of 18 and about 29, will vote in significant numbers. 
"Some people say, it's the young vote . . . that would decide the election one way or another, if they really get out and vote for [Democratic candidate Sen. Barack] Obama," said Jack Colwell, a political columnist for the South Bend Tribune and a Notre Dame professor in the Journalism, Ethics and Democracy program. 
If the youth vote does not materialize, he said, then Republican candidate Sen. John McCain has a better chance of winning. 
Nov. 4 marks the first time most Notre Dame students can vote in a presidential election. But based on the past youth voting record, it is likely that many students at Notre Dame, and many young people across the country, will not vote. 
"Young people just don't have a history of voting," Notre Dame political sci­ence professor David Nickerson said. Since young people tend to move around the country more often than older people, they are harder for cam­paigns to mobilize. Voting is a habit, Nickerson said, so once a person votes, he is more likely to vote the next time. 
Many young people have not developed the habit, he said. 
Others may believe their vote does not matter, Colwell said. 
"They may be soured by politics, or have the theory that they are all crooks, or that none of them are going to do anything, which isn't true, because elections do matter," Colwell said. 
The high point for the youth vote was the 1960s, Nickerson said, but since then, the percentage of younger voters has declined. When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, he made an "unprecedented outreach to young voters," Nickerson said, and that caused a jump in the num­ber of young people who voted. 
This year, Nickerson said, more young people than in the past have been responding in surveys that they are likely to vote. 
"The general consensus is that turnout will be higher amongst young people [this year] than in 2004," Nickerson said. 
Colwell agreed that young people seem more interested in the 2008 election than presidential elections four and eight years ago. 
"This time, they seem to be more interested in the election, probably realiz­ing that there is a lot more at stake," he said. 
Issues like the Iraq War, the environment and energy initially attracted the interest of the young electorate, Colwell said. 
Obama has inspired many young voters to become interested in poli­tics for the first time, Nickerson said. Obama has been aggressivelycourting the youth vote, pushing for people to apply for absentee ballots if they are out of state on Nov. 4. McCain has also targeted young voters, but where Obama's approach has been broad-based, McCain's is more selective, aimed at young people likely to vote Republican, Nickerson said. 
But it will be another week before the McCain and Obama campaigns will be able to tell whether their youth strategy has worked. 
Based on their observa­tions and interactions, some Notre Dame profes­sors and students predict­ed a high percentage of Notre Dame students would vote. 
Notre Dame students are more interested in 
the turnout of this elec­
tion than they have been 
in the past, Colwell said,

Wednesday, October 29, 2008 The Observer + IN FOCUS page 3 
Excerpt from Sen. Barack Obama's nomination speech to the Democratic National Convention, as released to the Associated Press: 
Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to. 
It is that promise that has always set this country apart, that through hard work and sac­rifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American fami­ly, to ensure that the next gener­ation can pursue their dreams as well. 
That's why I stand here tonight. Because for 232 years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordi­nary men and women, students and soldiers, farmers and teach­ers, nurses and janitors, found the courage to keep it alive. 
We meet at one of those defin­ing moments, a moment when our nation is at war, our econo­my is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more. 
Tonight, more Americans are out of work, and more are work­ing harder for less. More of you have lost your homes, and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach. 
These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed poli­cies of George W. Bush. 
America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this. 
This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work. 
This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news. 
We are more compassionate than a government that lets vet­erans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes. 
Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land: enough! This moment, this election is our chance to keep, in the 21st cen­tury, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On Nov. 4, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough." 
Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that, we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evi­dence that he can deliver the change that we need. 
But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety per­cent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change. 
The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a differ­ence in your lives, on health care and education and the economy, Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this president. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisers, the man who wrote his economic plan, was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners." 
A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and work­ing as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the mili­tary families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without com­plaint. These are the Americans that I know. 
Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he does­n't know. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under $5 mil­lion a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an educa­tion plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement? 
It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it. 
For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredit­ed Republican philosophy ­give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is, you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No health care? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, even if you don't have boots. You're on your own. 
Well, it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America. 
You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country. 
We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diplo­ma. We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president, when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000, like it has under George Bush. 
We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dig­nity of work. 
The fundamentals we use ·to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great, a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight. 
Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army and was reward­ed by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. 
In the face of that young stu­dent who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and schol­arships. 
When I listen to another work­er tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed. 
And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured every­thing she had into me. And although she can no longer trav­el, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well."

Let nw mako this plodge to you right hnrn and now.

Baraek Obama and I took very dill'nnmt journeys to this desti­nation. but we share a eommon story. Mirw began in Scranton, l'nnnsylvania, and then Wilmington, Dnlaware. With a dad who fell on hard eeonomic times, but who always told me: "Champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up." 
I wish that my dad was hnre tonight, but I am so gratd'ul that my morn, Catherir111 Eugenia t:innngan Biden. is hnrn. You know, she taught her children­all the children who flocked to our house-that you are defined by your sense of honor, and you are redeemed by your loyalty. She believes bravery lives in every heart and her expectation is that it will be summoned. 

Failure at some point in every­one's life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable. As a child I stuttnred, and she lovingly told me it was because I was so bright I couldn't get the thoughts out quickly enough. When I was not as well dressed as others, she told me how handsome she thought I was. When I got knocked down by guys bigger than me, she sent me back out and demanded that I bloody their nose so I could walk down that street the next day. 
After the accident, she told me, "Joey, God sends no cross you cannot bear." And when I triumphed, she was quick to remind me it was because of others. 
My mother's creed is the American creed: No one is bet­ter than you. You are everyone's equal, and everyone is equal to you. 
My parents taught us to live our faith, and treasure our fam­ily. We learned the dignity of work, and we were told that anyone can make it if they try. 
That was America's promise. For those of us who grew up in middle-class neighborhoods like Scranton and Wilmington, that was the American dream and we knew it. 
But today that American dream feels as if it's slowly slip­ping away. I don't need to tell you that. You feel it every single day in your own lives. 
I've never seen a time when Washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up. Almost every night, I take the train home to Wilmington, sometimes very late. As I look out the window at the homes we pass, I can almost hear what they're talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed. 
Like millions of Americans, they're asking questions as pro­found as they are ordinary. Questions they never thought they would have to ask: 

Should mom move in with us now that dad is gone? Fifty, sixty, seventy dollars to fill up the car? Winter's corning. How we Now, we owe more on the retire?

And in April, my husband Todd and I welcomed our littlest one into the world, a perfectly bnautil'ul baby boy named Trig. From the inside, no family ever seems typical. 
That's how it is with us. 

Our family has the same ups and downs as any other ... the same challenges and the same joys. 
Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge. And children with special needs inspire a special love. 
To the families of special­needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daugh­ters. 
I pledge to you that if we arc elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the White House. Todd is a story all by himself.

Throw in his Yup'ik Eskimo ancestry, and it all makes for quite a package. 
We met in high school, and two decades and live childrnn later he's still my guy. My Mom and Dad both worked at the ele­mentary school in our small town. 
And among the many things I owe them is one simpln lesson: that this is America, and every woman ean walk through every door of opportunity. 
My parents are here tonight, and I am so proud to be tlw daughter of Chuck and Sally Heath. Long ago, a young farmer and haberdasher from Missouri followed an unlikely path to the vice presidency. 
A writer observed: "We grow good pnople in our small towns, with honesty, sincerity, and dig­nity." I know just the kind of people that writer had in mind when he praised llarry Truman. 
I grew up with those w~opln. 
They are the ones who do some of the hardest work in America ... who grow our food, run our factories, and fight our wars. 
Thny love their country, in good times and bad, and thny're always proud of America. I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town.

Women contemplate possibility of first female VP 
Students agree Palin's candidacy is a milestone, but disagree about her qualifications and readiness for the job 

election. 
By LIZ HARTER 
Gov. Sarah Palin would make 
In Focus Writer 
history as the first female vice president if Sen. John McCain For the first time in the wins the election. Palin has nation's history, the United been governor of Alaska since States could see a woman in a 2006 when she defeated an position of power in the White incumbent governor in the House after next Tuesday's Republican primary and a for­
mer two-term Democratic gov­ernor in the general election. 
The possibility that Palin could become the nation's first female vice president has been a topic of discussion at meet­ings of the Notre Dame club Feminist Voice. 
"I think it's a big step to have a female on a ticket like this," said senior Mary DeAgostino, the secretary of Feminist Voice. "The idea of having a woman in a position of power like this is a great idea. I think it's a really important step for women in America. 
DeAgostino does not think, however, that Palin is the right woman to make this historic step. 
"I think the bigger issues that people need to look at are where different candidates stand on issues that are impor­tant for everyday women in America right now," she said. "I think it's important to be critical of different candidates' stances on women and gender issues, instead of just ascribing meaning to someone's gender." 
Notre Dame junior Colleen Moran, co-president of the Notre Dame club Women in Politics agreed that it is impor­tant to look at the issues, but she is happy that women have been active in the election this year. 
"While I do not necessarily support those policy measures Sarah Palin would endorse as vice president, I am encour­aged by the more active role women have assumed in this presidential election," she said. 
Moran said she is impressed that Palin has been able to rally so many people from different backgrounds to the Republican platform. 
"In the weeks immediately following her nomination, she was able to generate a great deal of enthusiasm for the McCain campaign," she said. 
But Moran is disappointed that Palin has not allowed the media much access because, 
she  said,  dealing  with  the  
media  is  a  necessity  in  the  
national political arena.  

"I believe both a level of com­fort with the media and an ability to respond eloquently and intelligently to public criti­cism are essential qualities for a national political figure," Moran said. 
Notre Dame senior Sarah Lyons, the vice president of Feminist Voice, said Hillary Clinton's historic run for the presidency should not be over­looked. 
"While Sarah Palin's vice presidential nomination is a critical step in women's politi­cal participation, I also think recognizing Hillary Clinton and how far she went for the Democrats is really important and should be kept in mind," Lyons said. "I think that was empowering and inspirational for many people." 
Lyons does not think Palin supports the issues women are interested in, like where candi­dates stand on equal pay, reproductive rights and vio­lence against women. 
"Personally, I'm not sure if Sarah Palin stands for my per­sonal interests," Lyons said. "I don't think she does." 
DeAgostino added: "I don't think she stands for feminists' interest." 
But, DeAgostino added, Clinton and Palin have con­tributed positively to the politi­cal discussion. 
"I think this election year has been critical in promoting women's political participation, and raising these issues," DeAgostino said. 
Moran said Clinton and Palin have different leadership styles, tailored to appeal to dif­ferent types of people. 
"Hillary Clinton has, in large part, tailored her leadership style to appeal to voters at the national level," she said. "Her husband's election to the presi­dency thrust her into the national spotlight, and she seized the opportunity to hone her own leadership skills. Clinton comes across as -if at times harsh -both intensely focused and articulate. 
"Palin, by contrast, has developed a leadership style geared towards voters at the local and state level. She demonstrates an ability to relate to everyday Americans as well as a freshness and enthusiasm at times lacking in Washington. Palin comes across as -if at times inexpe­rienced or uninformed someone Americans can con­nect with."
