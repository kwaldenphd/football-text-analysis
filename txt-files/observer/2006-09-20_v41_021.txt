Men charged with ticket counterfeiting 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Editor 
The St. Joseph County Prosecutor's office flied charges Tuesday against three New York men related to the sale of coun­terfeit Notre Dame football tick­ets. 
Arnold Conyers, 27, Denne! Friday, 27, and Timothy Lang, 22, of the Bronx, N.Y., were each charged with forgery and could face up to eight years in prison. 
They were arrested Saturday and will remain in the St. Joseph County Jail until their arraign­ment at 1 p.m. today in the St. Joseph County Superior Court, according to a supplemental affi­davit filed by St. Joseph County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Joel Gabrielse. 
Associate Athletic Director John Heisler sent the affidavit along with a press release to members of the media Tuesday. 
Friday and Lang were both caught selling "very good quali­ty" counterfeit tickets before the Notre Dame-Michigan game Saturday, Gabrielse said in the affidavit. 
Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) plain-clothes officers apprehended Friday, and Lang was caught after Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Bill Kirk witnessed him selling coun­terfeits. 
The tickets Friday and Lang sold matched the counterfeit tickets that NDSP gathered after the Sept. 9 Notre Dame-Penn State game. Altogether, police have recovered roughly 170 counterfeit tickets for the last two home football games. 
While Conyers was arrested Saturday, he was charged in con­nection with counterfeit ticket sales before the Penn State game one week earlier. Gabrielse said Conyers sold three counterfeit tickets Sept. 9 to a football fan who was not aware they were invalid. The fan took a picture of the seller after he bought the tickets, which allowed police to identify Conyers as he walked near Dorr Road and U.S. 31

University lags in low-income study 
ND ranked 49th for percentage of students with Pell Grants; administrators defend policies 
By EILEEN DUFFY 
Assistant News Editor 
Out of the 59 wealthiest pri­vate institutions, The Chronicle of Higher Education ranked Notre Dame 49th in its ability to enroll low-income students. 
But that low ranking might not accurately portray the University, said administrators who criticized the method researchers used to create the 2004-05 report, which exam­ined institutions with endow­ments of $500 million or more. 
The publication used the number of students holding Federal Pell Grants -which, unlike government loans, do not need to be paid back -as an indicator. 
In the study, Notre Dame's 9.7 percent of students holding Pel! Grants lagged far behind Berea College in Kentucky, the No. 1 school. where 80.8 percent of students reportedly receive those loans. 
Berea College's unique admis­sions policy only accepts stu­dents that "fall below a certain income," said Luke Hodson, assistant director of admissions at Berea. But other academical­ly elite colleges -Smith College 
(25.9 percent), Columbia (16 percent) and Stanford (13 per­cent). as well as p0er schools like Georgetown (1 0.4 percent) and Boston College (10.3 per­cent) outranked Notre Dame. 
Director of Financial Aid Joe Russo noted that Notre Dame is still "pretty close to its peers." 
But Tom Mortenson, a senior scholar at The Pel! Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education, thinks the University can do better. 
Mortenson has published extensively on low-income stu­dents in post-secondary educa­tion. In a December 2005 study, which also used the percentage

Football lawn parking debated 
City commission calls resolution unfavorable 
By MADDIE HANNA 
News Writer 
Proponents of lawn parking during Notre Dame football games received a minor victory Tuesday when the South Bend Area Plan Commission decided a resolution to prohibit most forms of lawn parking-save for eity­approved exceptions -would likely present more problems than it could solve. 
The commission passed a motion to forward the resolution to the South Bend Common Council with an unfavorable rec­ommendation.

'Rock the Vote,' CSC plan political events 
By JOHN TIERNEY 
News Writer 
With Election Day just seven weeks away, Rock the Vote is revving up to increase turnout at the polls. 
Junior Mike McKenna, director of Rock the Vote operations at Notre Dame, said the group has already registered 200 voters and hopes to have 1,000 signed up by mid-October. 
Also taking part in the effort to "rock the vote" is the Center for Social Concerns, which is spon­soring a series of political lec­tures and events to involve stu­dents and support the aims of the campus Rock the Vote cam­paign. 
Rock the Vote's "principal goal is to mobilize students to be responsible voters and to increase the level of political engagement on campus," McKenna said. 
A national non-partisan organ­ization founded in 1990, Rock the Vote is designed to help young people exercise their rights as citizens and to make a positive difference in the com­munity. 
McKenna will address the pro­gram's goal this fall both by edu­cating students on the issues and candidates of the election and by registering eligible voters. So far, McKenna said he has spent most of his efforts registering eligible

Core Council structure encourages dialogue 
Group reaches out to homosexual students 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
NewsWrirer 
As members of the recently restructured Core Council for Gay and Lesbian Studenl'i look at the new academic year, many see it as an opportunity to improve communication with the student body-an essential task that will include the creation of a eoalition composed of representatives from student government and student groups. 
"I think the largnst thing that can be done is simply raising awareness that there are gay and lesbian stud1~nl'i on this campus," council co-chair Andy Magee said. 
Magee, a fifth-year senior who 
served on the Standing Committee on Gay and Lesbian Student Needs for two years, said the new layout of the coundl. with 'a coalition to bridge the gap between the council and the stu­dent community, will allow the group to reach out to morn stu­

But I like

Photographer
for Observer cen­sorship. However since my last birth­day, I've come to realize that studying is only one of many inevitable components of life as a student at Notre Dame which. despite my whining, really just makes this year a little more golden. 
In the past year, I've learned that col­lege is the great equalizer-a rudimen­tary form of intellectual socialism, ifyou will. It's a celebration of the average, where you've been displaced from run­ning in the academically/socially/athleti­cally elite circles to being a dot smack in the middle of your (insert class) first exam bell curve. And if you're anything like me, you don't like that dot. So as a necessary matter of consequence, studying is the only remedy for college mediocrity. 
In the past year, I've also learned that studying isn't everything, and that much like your physical nutrition, your mental health in general needs generous allot­ments of playtime. For instance, I've learned that there's nothing quite like slugging, kicking, bunting or setting a ball around to take your mind off of that first exam. And there's nothing quite like running or walking the lake figure­eight to mull over the deeper issues in life. 
I've learned that there's nothing quite like going out on the weekends to dis­cover the various quirks of your friends. For instance, ifyou lay down in a dorm room with other people in it, you will be mounted -the proof of which will be publicized on Facebook. Here, there's no room for being even remotely homo­phobic as spooning and butt-grabbing among friends are expected Friday events and token signs of mutual affec­tion. 
I've also learned that certain issues on campus will always be perpetuated to bring about the politically incorrect sides of everyone -for all to experi­ence. I really do try not to be so negative about things like academic freedom, but there's only so much I actually want to hear about other people's genitalia. Sorry, advocates of "The Vagina Monologues," but sex was meant to be far simpler. 
Likewise, I'm still a little unclear on what diversity at Notre Dame is or ifit's actually an issue. I could be wrong, but I believe it was an old, old wooden ship used during the Civil War era. 
In the end, it doesn't matter ifyou're the bum who gets thrown out of Recker's for not wearing shoes or ifyou are the student who sets his or her mind to excelling academically. The two, after all, are not in conflict, but in complement, because in the end, all these components serve to define you as a student and a person here. 
I still have 12 more words, so make good choices, and you stay classy, Notre Dame.

NJ doctor accused of stealing cadaver hand 
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.­A doctor has pleaded not guilty to stealing a hand from a New Jersey medical school cadaver and giving it to an exotic dancer, authorities said. 
Ahmed Hashed, a 2005 graduate of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, was charged Monday after voluntarily returning from Los Angeles, where he is in a residency program, said his lawyer, Hassen Abdellah. 
Rashed, 26, is fnie on $1,000 bail. The dancer, Linda Kay, 
kept the hand in a jar of formaldehyde in her bed­room. Friends have said she called the hand "Freddy." 
Man sentenced in urine coffee case 
AKRON, Ohio-A former postal worker who poured urine into his co-workers' cofl'ee must serve six months in a jail work-release pro­gram. Thomas Shaheen, 50, of suburban Springfield Township, also must pay $1,200 to the people he used to work with to cover their cost of making a secret video of his role in tainting the office coflee. 
"J don't know what became of me," said Shaheen, a postal employee for 13 years fired from his job at a post office vehiele maintenance facility in Akron. 

The tainting occurred over several months. When work­ers realized what was going on, they told supervisors and an investigation began. When nothing came of the probe, workers had a video camera installnd in thn room whnre staffers made coffee. 
Shaheen was videotaped on two occasions in July 2005 pouring urine into a coffee pot in a break room.

News Writer 
While most students tend to worry about parking tickets only on space-scarce game days that force drivers to get cre­ative, Captain Jeff Korros of the Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) warned the current number of tickets issued per regular week is almost twice the expected level. 
Korros said police have issued around 500 tickets every week this semester -far more than the normal 200 to 300 NDSP hands out. The majority of them were issued in the D2 lot, where many students park. This rise in citations is primari­ly because of student neglect, Korros said. 
"The reason for the higher amount [of tickets] right now is ... [because students] have no decal and/or expired decals," Korros said. 
However, Korros said he is confident the number of tickets will slowly decrease as the year continues and as more students purchase decals. Parking per­mits cost $95 and give student cars access to specific lots. 
So far this year, NDSP has issued approximately 1,700 stu­dent decals, Korros said. 
Parking fines can range any­where from $10 to $50, depending on the violation ­plus possible additional fines from the Office of Residence Life and Housing. 
Korros said NDSP is not out to get student drivers and under­stands it can be hard to find a spot in an approved lot. First­time violators will often receive a warning without a fine. 
If a student does get ticketed, he or she is permitted to appeal through the Traffic and Parking Appeals Board. The board is composed of faculty, staff and students, with no member from NDSP or Parking Services.

"There haven't been any more complaints than expect­ed under these conditions. Cable TV has been very good," Ellis said. "As far as the wireless, it is just a matter of people getting used to shar­ing it. Unlike at home [ ... ], more people are accessing it in the dorms and the use is different." 
Ellis recommends students use a wired connection for downloading large files so as to not slow down the wireless connection for other people in the dorm. 
Zahm rector Father Dan Parrish mentioned the same problems within the men's dorm. 
"The only wireless com­plaint is some people are using high band width and it slows [the wireless] down," Parrish said. "We've been telling people to plug it into the wall and things have been getting better." 
Now that students can obsessively check Facebook and watch "Laguna Beach" without leaving their dorms, it remains to be seen if this will affect study habits. 
"I generally find I can multi­task so I can watch TV while I'm doing my homework," freshman Patrick Bears said. "It doesn't really affect me." 
Personal habits aside, cable and wireless in the dorms has had an effect on the socializa­tion of students within the dorms -both positive and negative. 
"Last year, when we didn't have cable, people would go to the section lounges and watch popular shows togeth­er," Welsh Family sophomore Clarissa Negrete said. "Now there isn't anyone in there. People stay in their rooms." 
Parrish offered a different perspective. He said he noted an "increase in use of the lounge." Amenities in the common areas such as ping pong, pool tables and pizza also attract students. 
In addition, dorms host activities to bring students into the lounges. Cavanaugh Hall recently hosted a movie night with Zahm and Knott Halls in its basement lounge after the Michigan game Saturday.

Visiting fellows discuss Asian cultural identity 
Groups can survive in midst of globalization 
By DANA GUSKY News Writer 

The Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies brought together three visiting fellows, distinguished for their extensive fieldwork, for a panel discussion on Central Asia Tuesday night. The lec­tures focused on three differ­ent local cultures within Asia 
including those of Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and the area's female Muslim popula­tion -and how that culture survives despite the influence of outside forces. 
John Heathershaw, a Kroc Institute Visiting Fellow, spoke first about the "surprisingly" consistent peace found in the country of Tajikistan. Heathershaw, who received his Ph.D. in International Relations from the London School of Economics and Political Science, went over the key points of his disserta­tion "Peace as Complex Legitimacy: Politics, Space and Discourse in Tajikistan's Peacebuilding Process, 2000­05." 
The lecture concentrated on different forms peacebuilding can take, including global, local and elite outlooks. Specifically, Heathershaw looked at the authoritarian government currently control­ling Tajikistan and the lack of resistance found in its general population. 
The cause of such accept­ance, he said, could be found in the low expectations of the locals, the legitimacy given to this regime and "a spectacle of

voters this fall. He described stu­dent reaction to his efforts as extremely positive, especially among underclassmen. 
"Since many of Notre Dame's freshmen and sophomores were not eligible to vote in 2004, this is the first major election in which they can participate, so many are interested in getting registered," he said. 
Students are encouraged to register in their home district, not in Indiana, McKenna said. While some students believe that their vote might "count more" in the tight congressional race in Indiana's second district, McKenna said he believes stu­dents "will be most familiar with the regional issues and the can­didates" in their home states. 
Rock the Vote will continue helping students register until the second week of October, when the registration period concludes in most states. In con­junction with Rock the Vote, the esc has made the national voter registration form available on­line and is also providing state­specific absentee ballot request forms. Both forms can be mailed postage paid from the esc. 
The CSC urges students to reg­ister and request an absentee ballot as soon as possible, in order to meet the state-specific consent" manifested by the government, he said. 
The second speaker was David Montgomery, a Rockefeller Visiting Fellow, whose area of study centered on the way behavior affects religious and cultural views. Montgomery began his lecture by telling the story of two very different believers of Islam in Kyrgyzstan. Montgomery went on to explain how each Muslim's upbringing and local culture affected the way he or she practiced their religion. 
"We construct a net of hap­penings in order to create knowledge," Montgomery said. 
The final speaker was Svetlana Peshkova, another Rockefeller Visiting Fellow, who spoke about the Otinchalar, or Muslim female religious practitioners. 
Peshkova explained how changes in the local culture allowed women to enter a path previously only chosen by men. While information and practices used to be passed down hereditarily, preventing women access, it is now given from teacher to student in spiritual schools. The per­centage of women in such schools is still low, she said, but women are. slowly enter­ing the field through both the spiritual fields and home schooling. 
The discussion panel ended with questions from the audi­ence, mainly focusing on why all three approached their issue from a local viewpoint instead of a more global per­spective. Panel members agreed that they wanted to represent the local beliefs, untouched by global attention.

deadlines. 

The second goal for Rock the Vote is to educate registered vot­ers on the issues and the candi­dates of the election, McKenna said. The CSC is sponsoring both formal and informal educational events, including a debate on the war in Iraq moderated by a for­mer White House speechwriter, a lecture on immigration reform given by a national leader, a con­cert featuring student bands, a discussion series titled "Pizza, Pop and Politics" and a T-shirt giveaway in LaFortune. 
The kickoff event for this fall will be a "Pizza, Pop and Politics" discussion held tonight at 5:30 in the Coleman-Morse Center. The College Republicans and College Democrats will be on hand to outline their party plat­forms. 
"It's helpful to work with [these organizations] because all the political groups on campus are concerned with the same goals," McKenna said. The series of edu­cational events will conclude on Nov. 9 with an analysis of elec­tion results. 
While Rock the Vote primarily stresses participation in national election years, McKenna said he hopes "the energy and interest in the political process that grows out of this campaign will carry over into non-election years so people will continue to follow politics."

The proposed reso­lution -which would prohibit all "front setback" parking not on a "durable, dust-free surface" -comes after a Sept. 7 Common Council debate on the issue 
But, more importantly, it comes after decades of football seasons -decades in which res­idents have either grown accus­tomed to or grown to hate the parkers. 
Jessica Payne, who has lived on N. Francis Street for more than 40 years, has learned to weigh the good aspects of game days (the excitement, the atmos­phere) with the bad (the beer bottles and trash that inevitably end up on her lawn). 
And the bad isn't going away anytime soon, she said. 
"If you tell people they can't park on your lawn, it's not going to make the problem go away," Payne told the commission. "It has always been a problem." 
That's why Payne opposed the occur." 

She also underlined the importance of "very stringent" criteria neces­sary for a resident to apply for a special parking permit. 
"You can't just hand out per­mits to whoever wants one, for whatever reason," Hobing said. 
The permit issue resurfaced frequently during the discussion. When questioned about the cri­teria to receive a permit, Puzzello said those details hadn't been worked out yet, but said requesting an exception for an appropriate time limit and ensuring "neighborly behavior" would be necessary. 
"Certainly, parking Friday night to Saturday night is proba­bly a bit much," she said. 
Payne said the special excep­tion rule would "open a flood of applications to problems the city's not capable of handling." 
"We're almost nitpicking on things we can't control," she said. 
While Toppel said she was "concerned" about the enforce­ment and logistics of the resolu­tion, she came back to the "need to start somewhere." 
"Right now, we have nothing," she said, explaining that the City's May 2D04 zoning ordi­nance had removed the section that formerly addressed the lawn parking issue. 
While Tuesday's session ended with the commission siding against the resolution, it was still a start. Since the commission's job is to evaluate but not former­ly approve resolutions, it's now up to the Common Council to decide what action to take. 
The Area Plan Commission also approved a resolution pre­sented by University architect Greg Hakanen and Barnes and Thornburg attorney Richard Deahl regarding the zoning of the area just south of campus that the University plans to develop. 
The petition to rezone the 26.2-acre site -bordered by Eddy Street in the west, the realigned Angela/Edison Boulevard in the north and Twyckenham Drive in the east -was "part of a broader peti­tion ... to bring this property within the city limits for future development in collaboration with the City of South Bend," Deahl said. 
If approved by the Common Council, the resolution will rezone the area -which includes the Eddy Corridor, where the University plans to develop a new retail neighbor­hood -from University District "County" to University District "City." 
The next step, Hakanen said, is not yet decided. 
"Our plan for the development of the land is evolving," he said. 
The Common Council will meet-at 7 p.m. Sept. 25 on the fourth floor of the County-City Building.

Army to maintain Iraq troop levels 
WASHINGTON-The U.S. military is likely to maintain and may even increase its force of more than 140,000 troops in Iraq through next spring, the top American commander in the region said Tuesday in one of the gloomi­est assessments yet of when troops may come home. 
Gen. John Abizaid. commander of U.S. Central Command. said military leaders would consider adding troops or extending the Iraq deployments of other units if need­ed.

Nation's army stages quick coup 
General ousts Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, pledges loyalty to king 
Associated Press 
BANGKOK -Thailand's army commander staged a coup Tuesday night and ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra while he was in New York, circling his offices with tanks, declaring martial law and revoking the constitution. 
Gen. Sondhi Boonyaratkalin, who is known to be close to Thailand's revered monarch and is a Muslim in this Buddhist-dominated nation, took power without a shot being fired. He will serve as acting prime minister, said army spokesman Col. Akara Chitroj. 
Thaksin, who was first elected in 2001, has faced calls to resign amid allega­tions of corruption and abuse of power, and the coup came on the eve of a major rally -the t1rst in months -that was sched­uled for Bangkok by a coali­tion of his foes. 
"'Thn armed forces rom­mander and the national police commander have succnssfullv taken over Bangkok and the surround­ing area in order to main­tain peace and order. There has been no struggle," the new leaders said in a state­ment on national television. "We ask for the cooperation of the public and ask your pardon for the inconven­ience." 
As soldiers and armored vehicles moved through drizzly Bangkok, the mili­tary declared a provisional authority loyal to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, calling itself the "Council of Administrative Reform." 
The council, it said, soon return power to a demo­cratic government but did not specify what reforms they would carry out. 
The military ordered all troops to report to their duty stations. There was no sign of resistance to the coup in the hours after it was announced late Tuesday. said Chitchai and Defense

Bush refutes extremists' charges 
Associated Press 

UNITED NATIONS -President Bush sought to blunt anti-Americanism across the Middle East Tuesday, asserting that extremists are trying to justify their violence by falsely claim­ing the U.S. is waging war on Islam. He singled out Iran and Syria as spon­sors of terrorism. 
Bush, in an address to world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, tried to advance his campaign for democracy in the Middle East against a backdrop of turmoil in Iraq, Afghanistan and other nations that have embraced the very changes he seeks for the region. 
Solidly aligned with Israel, the United States is viewed with anger and suspicion by Muslims across the Middle East. 
Addressing that hostility, Bush said, "My country desires peace. Extremists in your midst spread propaganda claiming that the West is engaged in a war against Islam. This propaganda is false and its purpose is to confuse you and justify acts of terror. We respect Islam." 
Bush's address was the latest in a series of speeches on the war on ter­ror, linked to last week's fifth anniver­sary of the Sept. 11 attacks and aimed at setting the tone for the fmal weeks of U.S. elections that will determine control of Congress. 
Bush said past stability in the Middle East has been achieved at the expense of freedom, and he disputed critics who claim his push for democracy has destabilized the region. 
"The reality is that the stability we thought we saw in the Middle East was a mirage," Bush told the more than 80 prime ministers and presi­dents assembled in the cavernous hall of the U:N. headquarters. 
"For decades, millions of men and women in the region have been trapped in oppression and hopeless­ness. And these conditions left a gen­eration disillusioned and made this region a breeding ground for extrem­ism." 
While praising Bush's freedom refrain, Madeleine Albright, secretary of state under President Clinton, said in an interview that the U.S.-led war in Iraq, not democratic reform, has destabilized the Middle East. ·

Pell 

continued from page 1 
of students holding Pell Grants as an indicator, he ranked the most class-exclusive universi­ties of the 696 private four­year institutions in the United States. 
Notre Dame was the 19th most exclusive. 
"For a Catholic school, I thought that was appalling," said Mortenson, mentioning the Catholic mission of reach­ing out to all members of the community. 
But according to Russo and Assistant Provost for Admissions Dan Saracino, a study that only measures the number of Pell Grant recipi­ents a University enrolls is "very simplistic." 
"It disappoints me that a ranking would be done in this manner," Saracino said. 
Rather, Notre Dame meas­ures its socioeconomic diversi­ty in the number of students who are on financial aid (80 percent) and the number of students who graduate holding Pell Grants, Saracino said. 
Because, as Saracino pointed out, enrolling students is one thing -retaining them is another. Notre Dame's overall retention rate of 95 percent places the University in the top three of all institutes of higher learning. 
"To admit [underprivileged students], but not help them persist, is itself access denied," Saracino said. "It's easy to use the federal government to give the student a Pell Grant, then wash your hands of any moral responsibility to help them graduate." 
The ranking also doesn't take into account the commit­ment the institution is making out of its own pocket, Saracino said -like the estimated $68 million Notre Dame awarded this year in University scholar­ship assistance. 
Notre Dame evaluates appli­cants on a need-blind basis ­meaning ability to pay does not factor into acceptance. While this is a "longstanding tradi­tion the University is very proud of," Russo said, he did mention that the Office of Financial Aid does not create such policies -that job belongs to the Board of Trustees. 
Once Notre Dame accepts a student, it piedges to meet the full, demonstrated financial aid, Russo said. The University is one of less than a dozen col­leges that do that. 
"We can look a student in the eye ... and say, your ability to pay will play no role at all in your admission," Saracino said. "If you deserve to be admitted, we will admit you. And then, we will meet your full need. 
"Those two things together are very powerful as we reach out to students who could not afford it." 
But Notre Dame's incoming classes, Mortenson insisted, are "absolutely unrepresenta­tive of the population of the U.S." Mortenson's answer for increasing socioeconomic diversity at the University was quite simply the opposite of Notre Dame's policies. 
"How about being need-sen­sitive?" he asked. "Go seek out the poorer, underprivileged students." 
Need-sensitive admission is "nothing Notre Dame would be proud to espouse or adopt," Saracino said. Such policies at other universities have created bad situations, where the insti­tution ends up refusing a stu­dent who cannot afford tuition because the institution has maxed out its yearly funds, he said. 
Notre Dame does seek out and encourage underprivi­leged students to apply, though. University representa­tives have targeted high schools with a high number of ethnic minorities -"and/or students on the free lunch pro­gram," Saracino said. The Notre Dame Club of Chicago has also initiated a program to match an alumnus to each of a group of Chicago public high schools to "adopt that school and reach out to those stu­dents," he said. 
"We are try­ing to increase

hood, too would tion's overall be that they assistant provost commitment would be Admissions to the commu­a commitment to public serv­ice," he said, and Saracino noted the academic profile of a legacy student is "virtually the same" as the overall student. 
Nor can the benevolence of alumni be ignored. 
Notre Dame's endowment, including alumni donations ­along with other monetary sources like bookstore reven).le and the funds from the football TV contract with NBC -is what subsidizes tuition to make it affordable for the average student, on top of pro­viding financial aid, Saracino said. 
"You do need the generosity of alumni and benefactors to help keep costs down, and pro­vide financial aid for those that can't 

extremely poor," he said. 
And the need-blind policy, he said, still leaves the Admission Office's eyes open to certain factors. 
"If we see [on applications] students coming from the Chicago PubHc School system, we ... we don't know for cer­tain, but we can assume stu­dents from those schools will be poorer than students from a suburb like Oak Park or Evanston," he said. 
Notre Dame isn't blind to its legacy students, though -a policy Mortenson took issue with. 
"You have to try hard to avoid poor people, to have so few Pell Grant recipients on campus," he said. "Whereas, what is [the average percent­age of legacies], 25 percent? I think Notre Dame's an odd school." 
In fact, children of alumni make up 24 percent of the class of 2010, the highest per­centage of any university in the nation. But, Russo said, Notre Dame is "proud of such a commitment" to the children of alumni. 
"They bring academic cre­dentials, a strong desire to be at Notre Dame, Catholicity and nity. 
Notre Dame has a "culture of service," Saracino said. More than 90 percent of incoming freshmen were involved in community service during high school, he said; more than 80 percent of Notre Dame students are involved in it during their four years; and 15 percent of Notre Dame graduates go immedi­ately into public service after graduation (five percent of those being ROTC students). 
"There is no reason to apolo­gize for what's going on at Notre Dame," he said. 
When asked if the University would like to place more high­ly in the aforementioned rank­ing of Pell Grant-holding stu­dents, Russo didn't hesitate. 
"Of course. Are we commit­ted to diversity? Yes. The high­est level of diversity," he said. "But can we be better? Of course. We're trying." 
That, Mortenson said, will require the University to take action. 
"If Notre Dame retains its current admissions policies," he said, "its ranking won't change."

The Standing Committee on Gay and Lesbian Student Needs expanded on the ad hoc commit­tee starting in the 1996-97 school year, and in 1997, the Officers of the University issued a statement describing Notre Dame's commit­ment to promoting a "spirit of inClusion."

"I think people do not feel as comfortable being open in this environment, because there are not as many signals that it's okay to be open," Lafferty said. 
The Princeton Review consis­tently lists Notre Dame high on its "Alternative Lifestyles Not an Alternative" ranking. This year, Notre Dame was number one. 
Magee said while many stu­dents are surprised to find there is a gay and lesbian population within the student body, he dis­agrees with the Princeton Review's assessment of the Notre Dame community's attitude toward homosexual students.

"[Having a heterosexual student on the council] broadens our per­spective on dialoguing more on how we can advance this whole 'spirit of inclusion' at Notre Dame," said Sister Susan Dunn, assistant vice president of Student Affairs. Dunn is co-chair of the council. 
Father Richard Warner, the director of Campus Ministry, Maureen Lafferty, a psychologist at the University Counseling Center and Heather Rakoczy, the director of the Gender Relations Center, also sit on the council. 
Lafl'erty said college is generally a challenging time for students who are gay, lesbian or bisexual or. who are confused abut their sexuality. 
"There may be particular chal­lenges when you are in a reli­giously-based institution," Lafferty said. 
She said though the gay and lesbian population at Notre Dame is not highly visible, she does not believe the University has a signif­

These sessions discuss what the Council's Web site called a "creative tension"­Notre Dame's dual views that each person is a child of God but also that the teachings of the Catholic church on sexuality and homosexual activity must be fol­lowed. 
The council has also continued with the standing committee's NETWORK initiative to teach members of the Notre Dame com­munity how to encourage dia­logue about gay and lesbian issues and how to create a safe environment, Magee said. They completed NETWORK training with the new resident assistants before classes started this fall. 
The council plans to continue events the standing committee held last year, Magee said. One Tuesday a month, the council hosts a reception for gay, lesbian, bisexual and questioning stu­dents, Dunn said. Solidarity Sunday, a retreat, and an event to celebrate National Coming Out Day in October are all in the plan­ning stage, Magee said.

IN BRIEF 
New home construction falls sharply 
WASHINGTON -Housing construction plunged in August, falling to the lowest level in more than three years as the once-booming industry showed further signs of a dramatic slow­down. 
The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that construction of new homes and apartments fell by 6 percent, the third consecutive decline and a much bigger setback than analysts had been forecasting. 
The weakness pushed the annual rate for con­struction down to 1.665 million units, the slowest pace since April 2003. 
Meanwhile, wholesale prices edged up a mod­est 0.1 percent in August, and outside of energy and food, prices actually fell for a second straight month. That hadn't occurred in more than three years, the Labor Department said. 
Analysts said the slowdown in inflation should reassure the Federal Reserve that it can continue to keep interest rates on hold. Fed policymakers meet on Wednesday for their first discussions since they voted in August to leave rates unchanged after 17 consecutive rate hikes. 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial aver­age fell 14.09 points to close at 11,540.91 after investors grew concerned about the economic fallout from a military coup in Thailand. 
Gore urges action on climate change 
NEW YORK -Former Vice President AI Gore stepped up his call for immediate action to halt global warming, urging politicians on both sides of the aisle to "have the courage to do bet­ter." 


"Each passing day brings yet more evidence that we are now facing a planetary emergency, a climate crisis that demands immediate atten­tion," Gore said Monday. 
In an hour-long speech at New York University Law School, Gore, who narrowly lost the 2000 presidential race to George W. Bush, framed the pursuit of renewable energy as an economic and national security issue as well as an environmental imperative. 
"When we make big mistakes in America, it is usually because the people have not been given an honest accounting of the choices before us," Gore said. "It also is often because too many members of both parties who knew better did not have the courage to do better."

Stocks drop with Thailand coup 
Baht falls in value; incident reminiscent of Asian currency crisis in 1997 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Stocks dropped suddenly Tuesday after Thailand's military launched a coup against the country's prime minister. While the major indexes recovered most of their losses in late afternoon. all closed lower. Tech stocks smarted from Yahoo Inc.'s news that slower ad sales would depress its third-quarter results. 
Traders watehing Thailand closely are certain to remem­ber how trouble in the king­dom had worldwide implica­tions in the past: The Asia currency crisis that erupted in 1997 began with the devaluation of the Thai baht, then snowballed into a cur­rency crisis in emerging mar­kets around the world. 
The baht fell sharply Tuesday, as did Brazil's real, whieh also tumbled in the '97 crisis. 
Thailand, usually one of Southeast Asia's most stable countries, has been in a state of politieal flux this year after massive rallies forced Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to dissolve Parliament.

Government wants records saved 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said Tuesday that Congress should require Internet providers to pre­serve customer records, asserting that prosecutors need them to fight child pornography. 
Gonzales and FBI Director Robert Mueller have met with several Internet providers, including Time Warner Inc.'s AOL, Comcast Corp., Coogle Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc. 
The law enforcement officials have indicated to the companies they must retain customer records, possibly for two years. The compa­nies have discussed strengthening their retention periods -which currently run the gamut from a few days to about a year -to help avoid legislation. 

During those meetings, which took place earlier this summer, Justice Department officials assert­ed that customer records would help them investigate child pornog­raphy cases. But the FBI also said during the meetings that such records would help their terrorism investigations, said one person who attended the meetings but spoke on eondition of anonymity because the meetings were intended to be pri­vate. 
Testifying to a Senate panel, Gonzales acknowledged the con­cerns of some company executives 
who say legislation might be overly intrusive and encroach on cus­tomers' privacy rights. But he said the growing threat of child pornog­
raphy  over  the Internet was  too  
great.  
"This is  a  problem that requires  

federal legislation," Gonzales told the Senate Banking Committee. "We need information. Information helps us makes cases." 
He called the government's lack of access to customer data the biggest obstacle to deterring child porn. 
"We have to find a way for Internet service providers to retain information for a period of time so we can go back with a legal process to get them," he said.

Shiites ambush U.S. army with children

Iraqi children sit at the edge of Sadr City in Baghdad after throwing rocks at U.S. soldiers Monday. 

Associated Press 

BAGHDAD -Shiite militias are encouraging children ­some as young as 6 or 7 -to hurl stones and gasoline bombs at U.S. convoys, hoping to lure American troops into ambushes or provoke them into shooting back, U.S. soldiers say. 
Gangs of up to 100 children assemble in Sadr City. strong­hold of radical anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and his Mahdi Army militia, and in nearby neighborhoods, U.S. offi­cers said in interviews this week. 
American soldiers have seen young men, their faces covered by bandanas, talking with the children before the rock-throw­ing attacks begin -and some­times handing out slingshots so the volleys will be more accu­rate, the troops said. 
"It's like a militia operation. They'll mass rocks on the last or second-to-last vehicle" in a U.S. patrol, said Capt. Chris L'Heureux, 30, of Woonsocket,

Conyers, too, sold "very high quality" tickets. The only differ­ence between the recovered counterfeit tickets and authentic tickets was "a lack of details in the Notre Dame hologram," according to the affidavit. 
Neither Conyers, Friday nor Lang admitted to selling counter­feit tickets, though Lang said he knew "something might be wrong" with the tickets he was selling. 
All three men have been con-children. 
"Such behavior by Iraqi chil­dren is spontaneous and the natural reaction from innocent children who are witnessing horrible deeds committed by the occupation forces in Iraq," Ali al-Yassiri, an aide to al-Sadr, told The Associated Press. 
Militants have used children before. Marines in the volatile city of Ramadi say Sunni Arab insurgents often send children to check out U.S. defenses or warn of approaching patrols. And Israeli troops have long faced stone-throwing Palestinian kids. 
But the increased use of chil­dren in the high-profile Baghdad battle poses a new challenge to American troops seeking to curb Iraqi militias. The tactic also shows the lengths to which militants will go in confronting U.S. troops in a high-stakes fight for control of the capital. 
The incidents have seemed to increase since U.S. soldiers moved their security crackdown into Shiite neighborhoods sur­rounding eastern Baghdad's Sadr City. The U.S. crackdown in the capital is aimed at curbing the power of the Mahdi Army and other sectarian militias.

Fox defended her questions. She said she wanted to deter­mine if there was a political reason Allen was not forthcom­ing about a Jewish ancestor. "I don't know why it would be so upsetting to him," she said in a telephone interview Tuesday. "I was shocked at how he took offense to the question." 
Fox had also asked Allen whether he had learned the word "Macaca" from his moth­er. Allen had applied the word to a Webb campaign volunteer of Indian descent during an Aug. 11 rally before a mostly white crowd. In some cultures, including Tunisia, the word is considered a racial slur. 
Allen glared at Fox for a moment, then said, "I hope you're not trying to bring my mother into this matter." 
References to the nationality of Allen's mother prompted the first report of his Jewish ances­try on Aug. 25 in The Forward, a Jewish daily newspaper, said its editor, Ami Eden. 
"There was some talk at that time that perhaps he picked this up from his mother, and it was an easy way to get to the story behind the headlines," Eden said in a telephone inter­view from New York.

WASHINGTON -Federal health officials are investi­gating whether a more potent strain of E. coli is behind an outbreak linked to fresh spinach that has sick­ened at least 131 people, half of whom have been hos­pitalized. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that fully 50 per­cent of those reported sick in the outbreak were hospi­talized. That's more than the 25 percent to 30 percent seen in other E. coli out­breaks, said Dr. David Acheson of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. 
"We're running higher than that," Acheson told 

reporters in a conference call. "One possibility is this is a virulent strain." 
Also unexpected was the 15 percent of food poisoning victims who developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Five percent is more typical, Acheson said. 
He cautioned that the numbers could be skewed by underreporting of less severe cases of illness: "It's too early to say at this point," he added. 
Reports of illness contin­ued to trickle into the CDC -the tally was up from Monday's 114 sickened, though the death toll remained at one, a 77-year­old woman from Wisconsin. Officials said that the cases appeared to have occurred earlier but were only now being reported and that con­sumers were no longer being exposed to contami­nated spinach. No one appears to have fallen ill since Sept. 5, according to the CDC. 
Still, the FDA continued to warn people not to eat raw spinach. 
Natural Selection Foods LLC, a San Juan Bautista, Calif., company whose multi­ple brands many people reported eating before falling sick, has recalled spinach products distributed throughout the United States. The company also distributed spinach to Canada, Mexico and Taiwan. 
River Ranch Fresh Foods of Salinas, Calif., recalled spring salad mixes contain­ing spinach purchased from Natural Selection.

Form.er concentration cam.p guard deported 
Woman stood watch while thousands died 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -An 83­year-old woman who admitted she had served as a guard at a concentration camp during World War II was deported to Germany, federal officials said Tuesday. 
Prosecutors would not say how they learned about Elfriede Rinkel. but a depart­ment spokeswoman said inves­tigators routinely compare guard rosters and other Nazi documents to U.S. immigration records. 
Rinke! admitted in court doc­uments that she worked as a prison guard at the Ravensbrueck camp near Furstenberg from June 1944 until the camp was abandoned by the Nazi government in April 1945. According to the 
U.S. Department of Justice, she worked with an SS-trained attack dog but was not a mem­ber of the Nazi party. 
"Concentration camp guards such as Elfriede Rinke! playPd a vital role in the Nazi regime's horrific mistreatment of inno­cent victims," said Alice Fisher, a Justice Department lawyer. "This case retlects the govern­ment's unwavering commit­ment to remove Nazi persecu­tors from this country." 
As part of her June agree­ment with prosecutors, Hinkel gave up her green card, moved to Germany and agreed never to return to the U.S., according to the court documents. The government agreed to not release information about Hinkel's case, which began in April, until after her depar­ture. She left this month. 
A call to her lawyer Tuesday wasn't immediately returned. 
Hinkel's husband, a German Jew whom she married after coming to the U.S., died in 2004. Her brother and sister­in-law, when reached at their Northern California home, said they were unaware of Hinkel's past and believed her husband had been, too. The couple asked not to be identified by name because they feared a backlash from friends and family. 
More than 130,000 women passed through Havensbrueck's gates between 1939 and 1945; an estimated 
40.000 survived, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

'Croc hunter' memorialized 
Thousands gather at Australian Zoo for service, more watch on TV 
Associated Press 
BEEHWAH -"Crocodile Hunter" Steve Irwin was rmnembernd Wednesday for his "great zest for life" at a public memorial service for tlu1 bnloved conservationist and entertainer. 
"We have lost a friend, a champion," actor Russell Crowe said in a recorded tribute. "It will take some time to adjust to that." 
Prime Ministnr John lloward, among the 5,000 in attm1dance at the Australia Zoo li1r the cere­mony, rmnembered Irwin lor his love of Australia. 
"Steve Irwin touched the hearts of Australians and touched the hearts of millions around thn world in a very spe­cial way," said Howard. "lie did that becausP he had that quality of being genuine, of belng authentic, of being unconditional and having a great zest for life. 
"Throughout his all-too-short life he demonstrated a love for thn two things that ought to mat­tfw more to all of us than any­thing nlse-his love of his fami­ly and his love of his country." 
ThPrn was one empty seat. at Irwin's personal stadium -the one set aside for the late and hugely popular "Crocodile Hunter" himself. On the stage sat Irwin's widow. American­born Terri, and their two chil­dnm, Bindi 8, and Bob, 2 -all dressed in Irwin's favored khaki outfit. It was their first public appearance sinee Irwin's death. 
A exuberant television enter­tainer and conservationist, Irwin, 44, died Sept. 4 when the barb from a stingray pierced hi<> chest while he was filming for a TV show on the Great Barrier Reef. !lis family held a private funeral service for him on Snpt. 9 at Australia Zoo. 


Flags on the Sydney Harbor Bridge flew Wndnesday at half­stall', and giant tPlnvision scrmms were set up in Irwin's honH1 statn of Queensland for people to wat.eh the service. Three of Australia's main tPlevision net­works carried the hour-long cer­emony, which was to be made available to U.S. and internation­al networks and which family ollieials said eould be watched by as many as 300 million peo­ple. 
Crowds began lining up Tuesday night for the start of the memorial service. Later, under sunny skies just before the start of the ceremony, dozens of tele­vision satellite transmission trucks parked outsidP the zoo, a flora and fauna park that has bnen owned by the Irwin family sinee 1970. 
I lis doath set ofl' an unprece­dnntnd outpouring of grief. Tens of thousands traveled to the zoo near Brisbane to drop oil" flow­ers and othnr mmnentoes. manv of them signing Irwin-stylPd khaki shirts instead of a eondo­lence book. 
Since Irwin's death, his con­servation charity Wildlife Warriors has seen a surge in donations and its Web site has received millions of hits.

Voting law ruled unconstitutional 
Photo ID not required to cast ballot, judge says 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA-A judge Tuesday struck down as unconstitutional the latest version of a new Georgia law requiring voters to show photo ID. 
State Superior Court Judge T. Jackson Bedford Jr. ruled that the photo ID requirement

require more than what is co-counsel 
required by the express lan­guage of our Constitution can­not withstand judicial scrutiny," he wrote. 
The judge took issue with the burden placed on voters to prove their identity using photo ID. Even if voters are allowed to cast ballots without the required identification, they must return within 48 hours with photo IDs or their vote is forfeited. 
Bedford noted that a photo ID is not required to register to vote in Georgia. 
The case is expected to go to the Georgia Supreme Court before the Nov. 7 general elec­tion. 
Russ Willard, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office, said it would appeal "as quickly as possible." 
Supporters of the photo ID law, including Republican Gov. Sonny Perdue, have said it is needed to protect against voter fraud. Opponents argue it dis­enfranchises poor, elderly and minority voters who are less likely to have a driver's license 
or other valid government­issued photo ID. 
Former Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes chal­lenged the law in the state case on a voter's behalf. Several civil rights groups filed a similar lawsuit in feder­al courL 
"Judge Bedford obvious­ly understood 
that at the end of the day, you don't play politics with the most fundamental right -the right to vote,'' said Jennifer Jordan, co-counsel with Barnes on the case. "The right to vote is actu­ally the one thing that makes us all equal." 
The new law took effect July 1, but its enforcement was blocked by state and federal judges during the state's July primaries and August runoffs. 
Last October, federal Judge Harold Murphy struck down an earlier version of the law, say­ing it amounted to an unconsti­tutional poll tax. 
Mother of m_an charged in abduction arrested 
Woman helped son to hide, survive in woods 
Associated Press 
CAMDEN, S.C.-The mother of a man accused of abducting and assaulting a 14-year-old girl who eventually was able to send a text message for help was charged Tuesday with helping her son elude authorities and survive in underground bunkers, a sheriff said. 
The man, Vinson Filyaw, 36, was charged this weekend with kidnapping and raping a 14-year­old girl and holding her in an underground bunker. She was rescued Saturday. 
On Tuesday, Sheriff Steve McCaskill said Filyaw's mother, 55-year-old Ginger Nell Cobb, was arrested after police learned 
~ she was working with Filyaw's common-law wife to provide him food, water and other supplies. Filyaw's common-law wife, Cynthia Hall, was arrested last week. Police had been looking for Filyaw since November, when an arrest warrant was. issued in the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl. But he used an elaborate system of bunkers in the woods near his home to elude authori­ties and survived on supplies he received from the two women, the sheriff said. Cobb would bring the items to Hall, who would then leave them 
for Filyaw to retrieve from an abandoned vehicle near his bunkers, McCaskill said. 
"He would come out of the woods and get it ... at night or whenever," the sheriff said. 
Cobb would not answer ques­tions as she left the sheriff's office Tuesday. She was being held in jail, and a bond hearing was scheduled for Wednesday. 
Filyaw was captured early Sunday and was being held at the county jail without bond. He also faces charges of possession of an incendiary device and imperson­ating an officer. 
Police say Filyaw, wearing a shirt with the image of a sheriff's badge on it, abducted the girl as she walked home from a school bus stop Sept. 6. The teen was found 10 days later in a booby­trapped, roughly 8-foot-deep hole carved out of the side of a hill. 
Authorities said the girl sent a text message to her mother on her captor's cell phone as he slept: "Hi mom," it read. ''I'm in a hole across from Charm Hill where the big trucks go in and out. There's a bomb. Call police." 
According to an incident report released Tuesday in the suspect­ed November assault on the 12­year-old girl, Filyaw woke the girl. who was sleeping in the same bed as her mother, and threatened to hurt the mother if she said anything. He then took the girl to another room and sex­ually assaulted her, the report said. 
Schools consider cell ban 
More than 50 percent ofteens carry phones, causing class interruptions 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Alabama was lifting the cell phone ban for its public schools just as New York City was imple­menting a crackdown. 
Just about every school system in the nation is facing the same conundrum, with little consensus, about how to balance a modern reality against the need to maintain order in the classroom and the hallways. 
With more than half the nation's teens now carrying them, cell phones have become an appendage that 
. many refuse to leave at home, and which many par­ents want them to carry at all times for emergencies and general peace of mind. At the same time, teachers and school administrators complain of growing disrup­tions, from phones going off in class to improper use of text messaging and cell phone cameras. "Electronic bullying was starting to emerge. They were text messaging threats, sending intimidating mes­sages to each other," said Randy Clegg, superintendent for the Clinton Community School District, an Iowa com­munity about 30 miles from Dubuque and 190 from Chicago. "We're putting sophisticated stuff in the hands of teenagers and you deal with all the typical teenage stuff." In July, the district adopted a policy where its 4,500 stu­dents are allowed to carry a phone, but risk having it con­fiscated until the end of the day if they use it or it goes off during school. A second infraction requires a meeting with a parent. Since the start of the new term, about three or four phones have been confiscated, said Clegg, esti­mating that more than three quarters of his system's mid­dle and high school students -and a growing number in elementary school -now carry phones. Wireless companies view school-age children are a key source of growth in a market where the number of first­time users is fast dwindling. While many are signed on through family plans that only generate an additional $10 or $20 a month in base charges, kids often ring up extra fees for text messag­ing, ringtones and video games. At last count, nearly three­quarters of the nation's pop­ulation had cell phones. By contrast, 53 percent of Americans aged 12 to 17 have them, according to a recent survey by Simmons Research. That figure, which Simmons extrapolates to roughly 13.1 million teens, is up from 39 percent in late 2004 and 33 percent in 2002, suggesting the trend has begun to accelerate. "Part of the reality is that they're going to have it," said Clegg. He noted that he too found it comforting when his daughter, now in college, had a cell to call home from extracurricular activities, including long bus trips returning well after midnight from high school band com-

From late April through the end of summer school, nearly 5,350 cell phones were confiscated, or more than twice as many as during the entire school year before the random screening began, said Keith Kalb, a city spokesman. Each school is left to set its own policies for returning confiscated devices, he said. 
There are other big cities that are taking a similar zero-or low-tolerance approach: Detroit, for exam­ple, also bans the devices. 
Many school systems across the nation officially ban phones -often under no-gadget rules adopted in the 1980's to combat beeper­toting drug dealers -but don't enforce those policies rigidly. 
That type of disconnect prompted legislative action in Alabama, where a state law predating the cell boom had made possession of a phone in school punishable by suspension or expulsion. 
with parents 
who want chil­
dren to have phones. "When we were growing up, I could walk six miles home and never worry about anyone bothering me. We didn't know at that time there was such a thing as a sexual predator." 
Freed of Alabama's state ban, the Jefferson County Board of Education decided in August to allow phones so long as they remain stashed away. 
"I can certainly see after 9/11 why people would want to be able to communicate with their children," said Pam Weed, the board's direc­tor of student services for the 40,000-student system. 
Some educators take an entirely different approach, leaving it to students to police themselves. At Seattle's private Lakeside School, once attended by Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates, students are free to use their phones. 
"I try and remember to put it on vibrate before I go into class," said Nate Benjamin, a 17-year-old senior who's had a cell since he was 12.

Surrounded by big screen TV's, La-Z­Boys and state of the art grills you would think I was walking through Sears. But I'm not. I am standing in the middle of the Joyce Center parking lot on a football Saturday. Custom painted vans and Coach buses line the aisles as well. What's not to love? Sitting down in an air condi­tioned bus with my best friends, listening to the Fight Song and enjoying some deli­cious fried chicken made fresh in Chicago this morning, I began to think I would love to host my very own tailgate with my family and friends. A Palmitier Family Tailgate, if you will. 
I continued to fantasize about the amazing tailgate soiree I could throw, but knowing in the back of my mind it would be next to impossible to obtain a game day parking pass, it was a pretty safe fantasy. Then I received THE phone call. My mom called me to say that the family indeed received a parking pass to tailgate for the Purdue game. I could hear the excitement in her voice when she told me I was to be in charge of get­ting everything ready, with great food and perfect presentation. From the beautiful state of South Dakota it is next to impossible to transport a grill, buffalo burgers, and rotisserie pheasant by plane, and so is toothpaste, shampoo and Evian, but that's another column. I've attended many a tailgate in my day,

A Word to the Wise 

but being a "first generation Domer" and new to the Notre Dame tailgating scene as of last year, I have never had the opportunity to host. Being in the hostess hot seat now, I do not even know where to start. Creating the per­fect Irish smorgasbord is a difficult task to undertake, and after what I experi­enced while tailgating these past two home game weekends, my fantasy began to turn into a nightmare. 
Not only did I see the big screen TVs, I also had the luxury of dining in an air­conditioned bus, complete with kitchen and toilet. I feasted on bakery fresh cookies, rotisserie hot chicken, and warm, homemade Polish sausage sand­wiches, fresh from the Chicago South Side. White tents tower over Escalades and hundreds of custom made tlags tly high overhead. Come next Saturday, none of the above will be featured at my tailgate. My family is not from Chicago and I will be doing my gourmet shop­ping at Meijer; I hope they are not out of Easy Cheese. I will be featuring a homemade Bags set, custom painted by yours truly, and perhaps a bumpin' Game Day mix blasting from the rent-a­car stereo. 
Friends are on my mind, too. Will they even come? With all the other options available that Saturday, what will lure them to mine? 
However, when it comes down to it, it is not the impressive food or the elabo­rate electronics that matter. Being sur­rounded by friends and family is what is important, together sharing in the Irish spirit and tradition. It is your true friends that will stand beside you regardless of what your tailgate fea­tures. I have also decided not to have envy towards those with cooler tailgates than my own. We are all just trying to have a good time, which is evident when walking up and down the aisles of the parking lot, hearing the sound of the band playing in the background, seeing ! good friends reuniting and listening to chants of "Snaggletooth" as an alum relives his glory days cracking open a beer with his own teeth. Tailgating is a time when memories are made and tra­ditions are continued, both of which are sure to be passed down to our "Little Domers" countless times in the future. 
Next Saturday I get to experience this with my own family and friends. We will start a new tradition, and I will be able to share what I love the most -football Saturdays at Notre Dame -with the ones I love the most. The football sea­son at Notre Dame is almost like the Christmas season, a time for family and friends to come together and share in tradition. Where on Christmas it is not the presents that matter, rather cele­brating the birth of Jesus, on football Saturdays it's not the tailgating ambi­ence that matters, it's coming together to support the Irish. 
So this next Saturday, if you do not already have an invitation to an extrav­agant tailgate featuring caviar and champagne, or awesome food from Chicago, feel free to stop by mine.

Serve in post-Katrina New Orleans 
Almost 13 months after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans is still drowning. But if you don't know this already, I'm going to have a hard time convincing you in an editorial piece. I can't pick you up and put you in the middle of the Ninth Ward, so you can see the damage in an inescapable 360­degree panorama. I can't person­ally introduce you to residents liv­ing with their six grandkids in a small; cramped trailer on a never­ending camping trip in an empty, toxic neighborhood. I can't show you the effect on the soul of spray­painted body counts on every sin­gle house, or tell you what it smells like when a hundred thou­sand houses are inundated with toxic black mold. and the garbage piles up on the streets with no one to collect it. 
I can tell you that it takes over 24 hours to see a doctor at any ER in New Orleans, but until you know people with no health insurance and how you'll have to beg the doctors to give them decent treat­ment, you'll have no idea what the medical crisis means. I can tell you about the suicides and the drug wars and the National Guard occu­pation, but you won't know what it means to live there -to see that in your home, your city. 
Luckily, there's a solution to all this. Come and see it for yourself. 
Come, and help struggling fami­lies gut their houses so they can start to get back on their feet. Come, and stand in solidarity with residents, because no one else is on their side. Come, and bear wit­ness to one of the greatest tragedies of our generation, meet some of the most resilient people in the world, and do your part to end their suffering. 
The CSC's Gulf Coast Student Task Force is putting together a trip, from Oct. 14-20. One week isn't a lot of time, but the more people that make the trip, the more work that can be accom­plished. 
If you need further reason to go, I ask you to think about this. Imagine if your city, Chicago or Dallas or New York, wherever you're from -imagine everyone leaving, and not knowing who was coming back. Imagine your entire life -your elementary school, the corner where you used to get ice cream with your friends, the movie theatre where you had your first kiss, your entire life's memory map -all under 15 feet of the most toxic sludge you can conjure in your mind. 
These people lost everything, and it's our duty, our obligation as members of the human race, to do everything we can for them. Because I know if it was my city, and my family and my history, I would want as much help as possi­ble. We owe it to New Orleans. We owe it to ourselves as Americans.

Population question deserves 
greater attention 
The three critical responses printed Sept. 18 to Liz Coffey's properly concerned col­umn on population growth are all short on facts and long on wishful thinking. They show how urgently we at Notre Dame need to educate ourselves on this issue, arguably the most important one facing the current generation of college students. 
Global population now increases at the rate of a little over 200,000 a day, or about 8, 700 each hour. That's over a million new humans on earth every five days, or, to take a familiar image, think of filling Notre Dame Stadium every nine hours with newcomers. 
The first thing to grasp about these trends is that they are unprecedented. Pointing out that Malthus was wrong in predicting immi­nent food shortages at the end of the 18th century, when the population was less than one billion, is irrelevant to today's ecological and social condition, when the population is approximately 6.5 billion. Conservative esti­mates project a population of about 9 billion by 2050. That's an increase of 2.5 billion over the next four or five decades. To put this number in historical context, it took homo sapiens until 1950 to reach a total population of 2.5 billion. 
The point is that the earth has seen noth­

ing like our recent population growth throughout the history of humankind. Of course, the earth does not "see." We, who must be its eyes, need to use our best sci­ence (and here that means ecology, not eco­nomics), our circumspection, our moral imagination, and our humility to understand our place and our responsibilities. Two of the respondents to Coffey acknowledge that resources may be finite while insisting that human resourcefulness is infinite. But noth­ing human is infmite. Ethical coherence begins in the recognition of limits. 
The biologist E. 0. Wilson wrote recently that "the time has come for economists and business leaders, who so haughtily pride themselves as masters of the real world, to acknowledge the existence of the real real world." It seems just as clear that at Notre Dame the time has come for faculty and stu­dents to put our minds-and our curricu­lum -to work Dn understanding the responsibilities of stewardship. If not here, where?

Not wanting to be outclassed by its younger siblings, the iPod received a few new updates as well. It now has more game capability including games such as Texas Hold 'Em, Mini Golf and PAC-MAN. 
While the screen is 60 percent brighter than before, the battery can last through 20 hours of music or six hours of video, an unprecedented battery life. The new iPod is offered as either a 30GB or an 80GB, getting rid of the 60GB version. Perhaps what is most appealing is that it is now $50 cheaper. Apple Price: $250­$350

iTunes received a facelift as well. The display is a little cleaner, but about the same as before. Better is the more inclusive iPod summary that is provided whenever the device is synched. Now you can easily see such things as what the space on your iPod is being used for and whether the version needs to be updated. 
In a step toward reintroducing the album cover to downloaded music, you can automatically load covers and then t'lse the new Cover Flow feature to flip through them on the screen to choose your music. The iTunes store also now sells videos (compatible with video capable iPods and playable in iTunes) and games (only compatible with the fifth-gen­eration iPod and not playable in iTunes). As always, iTunes is free to download. 
iTV 

Steve Jobs and Apple also dropped a tantalizing hint about its upcoming product release currently called iTV. The device will plug into the TV and wirelessly pull video and music from either a nearby Macintosh computer or the Internet. 
This announcement was met with much anticipation for the possibili­ties offered by iTV. The idea has been tried before with other compa­nies, including Microsoft with its Media Center PC, and iTV will debut about the same time as some other similar products, such as a set-top box from Netflix. Only time will tell, however, if Apple will dominate this market as well.

IN BRIEF 

GY.mnastics coach P.leads 
guilty to sexual assault DALLAS -A former coach at an elite gymnastics academy was sentenced to 15 years in prison Tuesday after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. 
Christopher Wagoner, 33, was accused of fondling and raping the girl in 2002 and 2003, when he was her coach, He pleaded guilty to two felony counts of sexual assault. Each charge carries a 15-year penalty, which he will serve concurrently, 
The girl's family filed a lawsuit this month alleging Wagoner repeatedly assaulted the girl and encouraged her to use bulimia and cocaine to lose weight 

The lawsuit also accuses the own­ers of the World Olympic Gymnastics Academy -the father of national champion Nastia Liukin and the coach of Olympic gold medalist Carly Patterson -of failing to screen and supervise Wagoner.

Veteran's Day Garden fight NEW YORK-Another Ali will box at Madison Square Garden, 
Laila Ali, the daughter of boxing great Muhammad Ali, will make her debut 35 years after her father lost to "Smokin" Joe Frazier at the Garden. 
She'll be on the Nov. 11 undercard of the IBF heavyweight bout between champion Wladimir Klitschko and undefeated Calvin Brock. All three appeared at a news conference Tuesday at Madison Square Garden, 
Ali, the WBC light heavyweight champion, is 22-0 with 19 knockouts since her pro debut in 1999,

Dungy explains leaving
offensive starters In game INDIANAPOLIS -Tony Dungy tried to get his starters out of Sunday's blowout in the fourth quarter, Houston didn't give him a chance, 
Many people outside the organiza­tion wondered why players like two­time MVP Peyton Manning and seven-time Pro Bowl receiver Marvin Harrison were still in the game until the end, so Dungy offered an expla­nation Monday. 
"The problem we had is that we were up 30-3, so that was about four scores, and we substituted on defense and you'd like to hold them," he said. "But they went right down the field and scored, and then we're three scores up. So we told our guys one more drive." 
The offense responded with anoth­er touchdown drive, to make it 37­10, and Dungy again sent out many of his defensive backups -hoping to pull his offensive starters. 
Associated Press 
NORMAN, Okla. -A phone call from Oregon coach Mike Bellotti was nice, but it did absolutely nothing to soothe Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops over an incorrect officials' ruling that likely cost his team a victory over the Ducks. 
"He just apologized and said that it's unfortunate that the two of us have got to be in the middle of it," Stoops said Tuesday at his weekly news conference, "I said, 'Well, you didn't do anything wrong but play hard, and that's the same thing we were trying to d0," 
Stoops still was speaking out after Saturday night's 34-33 loss in Eugene, Ore., a game in which a blown call on an onside kick led to Oregon's winning touch­down in the final minute. 
The Pacific-10 Conference admitted Monday the onside kick was touched by an Oregon player before it traveled the required 10 yards, and, therefore, possession should have been awarded to Oklahoma. The league suspended the officials responsible for one game, and commissioner Tom Hansen apologized for the mistake. 
Had Oklahoma been given the ball, the offense 

could have run out the 
clock for a 33-27 win. 
At Oregon, Bellotti said 
some might view the win 
as tainted, 
"I feel very fortunate for 
us to have won that foot­
ball game, not for the offi­
cials' errors, but for how 
our team played," he said. 
"We were lucky, we made 
plays and we never gave 
up, It's unfortunate that 
any team had to lose, or 
the efforts of my players 
are questioned, because of 
officials' errors." 
Bellotti told Stoops when · officials determine the out­
come it's not good for 
either team. 
"And I can understand 
their frustration," Bellotti 
-
-, 
said. 
Although Stoops said his team could have done things differently to pre­vent the game from becoming so close, he was still upset at the result. 
"We can't sit here and say OK," Stoops said. "It's unacceptable and inexcus­able, to them (the players) and to us, because we can't get it back, and they earned it. That's the hard truth of it, and now our situation is severely altered." 
Stoops said he was addressing the issue "for the last time" so his 17th­ranked Sooners (2-1) could get ready to play Middle Tennessee this Saturday,

Trio charged in Duquesne shooting Tuesday 
Three players still hospitalized after near-fatal incident 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH Police charged two men Tuesday with shooting five Duquesne University basketball players after a school dance, and they accused a 19-year-old sopho­more of helping get the men and their friends into the dance despite knowing some were armed. 
Brandon Baynes, 18, was arraigned on five counts of criminal attempt at homicide. Prosecutors also filed charges of aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy and weapons counts against him and William Holmes, 18. A reckless endangerment charge was also filed against Holmes, who is still being sought.

Three players remained hos­pitalized following Sunday's shootings after the dance. The most seriously wounded, jun­ior forward Sam Ashaolu, 23, was in critical condition with bullet fragments in his head. 
Brittany Jones, accused of helping get some young men with guns into the party. was arrested Monday on charges of reckless endangerment, carry­ing a firearm without a license and criminal conspiracy. She was arraigned and posted bond Tuesday morning. 
According to the criminal complaint, Jones -who is active with the Black Student Union, which sponsored the dance -got a call from a man asking whether he and his brother could attend. They arrived with four others, including Baynes and Holmes, about midnight, according to police. 
While walking to the party, Jones told police, she became aware that several of the men had guns, authorities said. 
They asked Jones whether they were going to be "patted down" before entering, offi­cials said. The doorman reportedly told Jones partygo­ers weren't being searched, and the men went into the dance. police said. 
According to the criminal complaint against Baynes, a witness at the dance reported hearing an argument and saw two men firing guns at the vic­tims. Using driver's license photos, the witness identified one man as Baynes. 
Baynes did not speak during the brief court hearing. His father said the teen was not guilty. 
"My son never fired a gun in his life," A.J. Baynes said. He said his son knew Holmes, but he would not discuss what his son told him about the shoot­ing. 
Sumner Parker, an attorney

Brandon Baynes, a suspect in the shooting of five Duquesne basketball players, leaves police headquarters Tuesday. 
representing Baynes, denied his client was the gunman but said Baynes had identified the shooter in a statement to police. Parker said Baynes had gone to the dance with three friends, none of them part of the group believed involved in the shooting. 
In interviews Monday with The Associated Press, several 
players said the shooter was a non-student unhappy that the woman he accompanied to the dance had talked with a play­er. 
The shooter and at least one other man followed the players when they left the dance to walk to their dormitory, they said. 
Jones' attorney, James Ecker, would not confirm Tuesday whether she was cooperating with authorities and would not comment on reports that authorities may ­drop charges if she provides information to the police. 
"I can say she's spent a lot of time with police in the last couple of days. Sunday and Monday," Ecker said. 
"Until this case goes to a hearing or trial, she's pre­sumed innocent," he said. 
University president Charles Dougherty said he was grateful to police for the "swift arrest of the individual who may have been the shooter in the vicious attacks on Duquesne University students last Sunday morning." 
A university spokeswoman said the school was examining the allegations against Jones and would act in accordance with school policy. 
Besides Ashaolu, the other injured players were junior guard Kojo Mensah, 21; 6-foot­7 forward Stuard Baldonado, 21; junior center Shawn James, 23; and Aaron Jackson, 20, a guard who is one of only two returning players from Duquesne's 3-24 team last sea­son. 
Baldonado was in fair condi­tion Tuesday with arm and back injuries; he likely won't play this season because his back injury will require two to three months of rehabilitation. He was expected to be released from the hospital by the end of the week. 
Mensah, shot in an arm and shoulder, was kept at a hospi­tal to receive additional injec­tions of antibiotics but was expected to be discharged later Tuesday. 
In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Jackson said he and teammate Stephen Wood dropped to the ground when shots rang out. Mensah, Baldonado and Ashaolu were the first players hit in the attack.

Steelers, Jags regroup after MNF showdown 
-
Jacksonville moves to 2-0 after win; Pittsburgh falls to 1-1 
Associated Press 

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -Ben Roethlisberger may have been feeling a little sick. He certainly was a little rusty. He could have used either one as an excuse.lnstead, he took all the blame. 
Wearing protective padding around his midsection, Roethlisberger returned to Pittsburgh's lineup Monday night, barely two weeks after an emergency appendectomy. The Jacksonville Jaguars made him pay for his courage, harassing the quarterback and stopping the defending Super Bowl champions' nine-game winning streak with a 9-0 victo­ry -the lowest-scoring game in Monday Night Football histo­ry. 
"A lot of it was my fault," said Roethlisberger, who was 1 7 -of­32 for 141 yards with two interceptions. "I told Coach I'll be OK. When I get some more practice and get on the same page with the receivers, we'll be good." 
Pittsburgh couldn't run either, managing only 20 yards on Willie Parker's 11 carries. The Steelers finished with 26 yards rushing -the lowest in Bill Cowher's 15-vear temu·P. 
"'If vou come in lwre with thP mind~set of running tlw ball on us. you may want to rNhink that philosophy," Jags defensive end Paul Spicer said. "It ain't going to be that easy." 
Josh Scobee kicked three field goals for the Jaguars (2-0), who improved to 4-0 against the Steelers in September and 3-0 against them on Monday night. 
The Steelers (1-1) kept it close and got the ball back with about five minutes to play, down 6-0. But Rashean Mathis intercepted Roethlisberger's slant pass and returned it into field goal range. 
Scobee kicked his third field goal, a 42-yarder with 4:26 left. He had a 31-yarder late in the third and a 32-yarder earlier in the fourth, and that's all Jacksonville needed. 
"We moved the ball well, but we did a bad job of scoring points," quarterback Byron Leftwich said. "To move to the

0 lead. She would add two more touchdown passes before half­time, both to her favorite target, Kelly Bushelle. Welsh shut out Lyons, 21-0. 
"I have total confidence in Kelly," Gargula said. "I know she's going to come down with the catch even if she's triple cov­ered." 
Defensively, Welsh Family was equally strong, not allowing a first down in the first half, and coming up with two interc.ep­tions. 
For Lyons, a team made up of mostly freshmen, the game was a learning experience. 
''I'm proud of the way we played today," said Lions coach John Harrington, "regardless of the score." 
Walsh8, PEO 

On the opening drive of the game, Walsh defensive back Julie Campbell intercepted a pass from Pasquerilla East quarter­back Laura Adams and returned it 50 yards for the game's only touchdown in the Wild Women's 8-0 win Tuesday over the Pyros. 
Walsh's secondary dominated the game, forcing seven intercep­tions, including one on each of the Pyros' first four drives. Campbell was the player most responsible for the picks, as she caught three in the first half and tipped another to Emily Wilson to end the half. 
"I thought we played spectacu­lar [defense]," Walsh coach Brian Fallon said. "And we have great defensive backs and they helped us get the ball back on offense." 
Things were just as bad for Pasquerilla East's offense in the second half. Three more inter­ceptions stifled every scoring threat the Pyros could muster. 
"When you give up that many turnovers, you're going to lose the game," Pyros head coach Nate Dyer said. "When the other team has that many turnovers, there's nothing else we can do." 
The one highlight for the Pyros was their defense, which was able to shut out the Walsh offense. Pasquerilla East's defense made multiple key goal line stands, including a forced turnover in the end zone that gave the Pyros a late chance to score. 
"We just need to practice some more [to improve the offense]," Pyros captain and linebacker Molly Fox said. 
Despite the defensive effort put up by Pasquerilla East, Walsh easily won the field position bat­tle all game long. 
"We really came together as a team our defense played a very strong game," Walsh co-captain

Mary Anne Lukeman said. "And our offense did a good job mov­ing the ball down the field." 
Cavanaugh 13, Badin 0 
Cavanaugh weathered the ele­ments to earn its first win at Riehle West, shutting out the Badin Bullfrogs Tuesday. The Chaos sealed the deal with a Katie Dunn touchdown pass with only a minute remaining. 
In the first half, both defenses would bend but neither would break. Each team failed to con­vert on red zone opportunities. However, the hairs best scoring opportunity came on a near interception from Badin captain Meghan Charlebois. 
"I was probably five to 10 yards from making it all the way," Charlebois said. "Sometimes it just doesn't hap­pen." 
Starting with their first drive in the second half, the Chaos went to the option -much to the delight of their quarterback. · 
"I love running the option ­it's great," Dunn said. "We want­ed to keep the ball on the ground." 
Keeping the ball on the ground, Cavanaugh marched down the field and capped off an impressive drive with a touch­down run from Dunn on an option keeper. But she was quick to pass on the credit. ­
"My offensive line led the way all night," she said. "When I wanted to run I could run; when I wanted to pass, I had time." 
The Bullfrogs remained per­sistent, even when facing a 6-0 deficit. On the first play of the next drive they went deep down the sideline and completed a pass to wide receiver Courtney Raines, but the Cavanaugh defense stalled that drive. 
Chaos captain Kerri Bergen loved what she saw from her team. 
"This was a big statement for us," she said. "It shows people the direction our season is going."

SMC SOCCER 
Belles' tough season continues with loss 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
Playing in a pouring rain, Saint Mary's fell once again Tuesday, losing a tough game to undefeat­ed Calvin. 
The cold and wet field condi­tions made for a sloppy 6-1 victo­ry for the Knights (6-0). 
"The weather made it a tough game but both teams had the same conditions," Belles assis­tant coach Maja Hansen said. "It was a tough day we somethings well but certainly have some room for improvement," 
Hansen -a first team All­American at the New Hampshire in 1995 -is now in her third year with the team. 
The Belles (1-4) started off well as sophomore forward Lauren Hinton notched her fourth goal of the season less than 15 min­utes into the contest. I-linton worked the ball up the field win­ning several tackles along the way and let a shot rip from just

outside the 18-yard box. 
Hinton and senior sister Ashley Hinton worked hard on offense but were unable to put together any more quality scoring oppor­tunities against the frugal Calvin defense. The Knights have a 0.5 goals against average through their first eight games. 
Calvin registered its first goal midway through the first half when senior Sarah Weesies received a pass from junior mid­fielder Kate Otten and beat Saint Mary's goalkeeper Laura Heline. The Knights were able to strike twice more before the end of the half to take a 3-1 lead into the intermission. 
The second half did not get much better for the Belles who were seemingly overpowered by the powerful Calvin attack. 
The young Saint Mary's defense struggled to keep up and allowed three more goals in the second half on a few defensive miscues. Weesies, Knights soph­omore Elizabeth Ribbens and senior Jill Capel all added goals. 
"It was the usual people we are familiar with at Calvin that put up the points, they have a very fast and experienced team," Hansen said. 
The Knights were able to get off a flurry of shots, many of them from quality scoring posi­tion. Despite the score, Hansen said, Heline played a solid game in net for the Belles, coming up with big save after big save to keep the score from getting out of hand. 
"The biggest positive of the game was definitely Heline, she got a couple of very nice compli­ments from the Calvin coaching staff at the end of the day," Hansen said. 
Calvin, the defending MIAA champion, will be the team to beat once again in the conference this year. The Belles were ipti­mistic following the game, know­ing that they had seen the best. 
"I don't think that this is dis­couraging," Hansen said. "The team knows that this season is a process and we will be ready the second time around."

that he rarely makes public comments during the summer, when he allegedly made the statement to which Smith and the Tribune alluded. 
"It's funny because in the summertime I don't talk to any­body," Weis said. "Somebody told me this summer I talked to somebody. Unless they were talking about my wife, I don't talk to anybody in the summer­time. I go on vacation with my family." 
While Weis downplayed his confidence in that manner, he also said he remained con­vinced his squad could perform well this week under his leader­ship. 
"After you lose like that, your confidence is always in ques­tion, [but] not mine personally," Weis said. "The best thing that happens after a game like that is practicing." 
Weis also said he would not use last year's flag-planting incident as a motivational tool this week. After Michigan State's 44-41 overtime victory at Notre Dame Stadium a year ago, Spartan players stuck their school flag in the turf at Notre Dame's 50-yard line. 
"I think we have to put the flag incident ... behind us," Weis said. "When you use something like the flag incident, try to use that as your motivation for the game, that lasts for about five minutes once the game starts. Once you start hitting each other in the mouth a few times in the game, that stuff is over with." 
Weis said he will once again focus solely on the opponent Notre Dame is about to face and little of the media attention sur­rounding the game -much like his game plan before the Michigan contest. 
''I'm not going to talk about flags, I'm not going to talk about beating Michigan State, I'm not going to talk about mega­phones," We is said. ''I'm not talking about any of that stuff." 
The winner of the Notre Dame-Michigan State game receives a megaphone trophy. 
To keep himself isolated from the outside noise, Weis said he has limited contact with media outlets. He said the few Web sites he plans on visiting this week are weather.com, accuweather.com and HannahAndFriends.org, the official site of Weis' charity for developmentally disabled chil­dren. 
"I make sure that I don't get info by outside sources when things go too well or when they go too poorly," Weis said. "The only thing I need to do is I need to be aware of some things that come up, like [the alumni rumor].... This has been a very poor week for me on the Web."

Picking up the pieces 
Weis remains confident after beating by Michigan 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 

Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis had to play to the middle of the field Tuesday. 
Weis denied a nagging rumor that he boasted to a group of alumni that he would never again lose to Michigan State while also insisting that Notre Dame's 26-point loss to Michigan did not shake his confidence in the team and his own coaching abilities. 
On Monday, the South Bend Tribune reported that Michigan State coach John L. Smith reacted to comments Weis allegedly made about the two teams' rivalry. The Tribune reported that Smith said the comments would motivate his coaching staff in the week leading up to the game. 
Weis said the rumor was false and

Irish hope to find rhythn1 of success starting vvith NIU 
By ERIC RETTER Associate Sports Editor 

It's back to square one. 
That's where Notre Dame (4­3-1, 2-2-0 Big East) stands heading into today's home game against Northern Illinois (5-3) after another 1-1 week­end. The Irish topped Louisville 2-0 Friday but fell to Cincinnati 2-1 Sunday. After splitting the weekend games, the Irish fell out of the top-25 in both the NSCAA/adidas poll and the SoccerTimes.com poll for the first time this season. 
"It's not the way we wanted, [but] it's a tough schedule," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "You're up to two [wins] in a row then down to scratch again. You're back to one day at a time, but that's the nature of the beast." 
Clark, however, has not seen much in the team's play that discourages him.
