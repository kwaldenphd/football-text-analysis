A tradition up in smoke 
They called it the "hotspot" of South Bend. It was part of every student's weekend routine. The people, the atmosphere, the music. All this and more attracted the Saint Mary's-Notre Dame com­munity. For years it had been an Irish tradition. 
But then, on one bitter cold Sunday morning, it all came to an end. It started in the back, smolder­ing the "Skoll" (a popular chewing tobacco) covered walls, making its way past the newly­recovered pool tables and across the sticky, beer infested floors. Fire was everywhere, destroying a long time tradition. 
Corby's Tavern, Inc., was gone. 
The damage estimate was rounded to a mere $50,000 (are cement blocks really that ex­pensive?). The "hole in the wall" interior, as it was recently described by an NO alumnus, was ruined. For those who frequented Corby's it may be dif­ficult to think of it as being anything but ruined, even after a major fire. Yet, it was the home ofthe Rugby team and hundreds of other students who loved Corby's. 
The little "hole in the wall" bar on Corby's Street was the most popular off-campus spot. Even though there were al­ways "too many guys and not enough women" at 
really hear it because it's too loud) "and it's where all my friends hang out. It's definately not the atmosphere that attracts us." 
Corby's became a lifestyle for many devoted people. Everyone who went there was ac­coustomed to the same Grateful Dead tapes, the same familiar faces behind the bar and the same weekend crowd. This was Corby's and that's just the way it was. 
Occasionally, Corby's even attracted the atypi­cal in the crowd found there. One Notre Dame senior who was wearing multi-colored embroidered ducks on his Khaki pants com­mented on Corby's: "I like Corby's because it got that 'homey' touch to it...it's like drinking in my garage. Although, my garage is more tastefully fur­nished. Actually, I think it's a dump but what else is there?" 
The die-hard Corby's fans visited the bar daily for happy hour. "I remember going to Corby's af­ter classes during the week," commented an NO grad. "That was the best time to go, when there 
weren't a million people around."

Another younger bar frequenter said ofCorby's, "It was the only place you could go underage." Many seniors have happy memories of their first underage drinking days at Corby's. 
In fact, now that Corby's is closed, the younger drinkers are seeking other alternatives to it. "A great deal of underage people tried to get into Senior Bar last weekend. That was the Corby's crowd," NO Student Government Vice President Tara Kenney explained. The Commons and Irish Country, she added, also had more business than usual. Places like Nickie's are also picking up. 
But dare the true Corby's fans change their lifestyles and move on to someplace else like Irish Country or Senior Bar? "No!" said a very "old" SMC sophomore. "I lived there (at Corby's). I will 
not go to Irish Country; it just can't replace the Corby's crowd. Bridget's is the only place that can come close to Corby's" 
Well, for now, Corby's is gone. 
"Corby's will fade into everyone's memory...like the old Library (the ear­lier name for the deceased Goose's)," said an NO alumnus. 
Devoted Corby's fans keep hoping that their 
-.70,~'-ili::~·.~· haven will soon be resur­rected. But until then, remember the Old Corby's tradition.

Corby's, it was always packed on the weekends. Why did so many people flock to such an "establishment?" A Notre Dame senior remarked, "I like Corby's because its where the 'real' people go. People like you for what you are, not be­cause you have a reptile on your shirt." Another SMC senior added, "the music is great" at Corby's (even though you can't

lethal dose of radiation at between 600 and I,000 rems, while a mil­lirem is one-one thousandth of a rem, she said. 
Radiation checks showed the "dose rates" to be no higher than what could be expected in nature, Sullivan said. "Surface contamina­tion is not expected to occur," he said. 
"We are told that all systems worked as they were supposed to work," said Bassett. "The company said all the bells went off when they were supposed to and that the shut­down system operated properly." 
The plant, named for retired RG&E board chairman Robert E. Ginna, has a history of steam tube problems, according to NRC records. The plant underwent an emergency drill test last Thursday. Despite a communications problem due to a computer, the exercise went smoothly, said Terc, who directed the drill. 
In Albany, state officials activated their Emergency Operations Center to monitor the situation. Under dis­aster planning procedures upgraded after the Three Mile Island accident, the county takes the lead in such emergencies, with the state Health Department taking the lead for the state. 
Regional NRC administrator Ronald Haynes, arriving in Roches­ter with a team of experts to inves­tigate the incident, said: "surely

we've had steam generator tube leaks, but not this bad. This is cer­tainly classified as an unusual event." 
According to Jack Bryan, public information officer for the state Dis­aster Preparedness Commssion, radiation was released in bursts, totaling three minutes' worth. The releases occurred over one hour, said Jay Dunkleberger, director of the Bureau of Nuclear Operations of the state energeny office. 
Sanborn said yesterday that a tube leak in the steam generator in the 

Jaruzelski lashes out at U.S., Solidarity 
POLAND (AP) -Polish Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski bitterly at­tacked the independent labor federation Solidarity, the United States and its allies yesterday and hinted that military control of Poland's mines and factories will continue for some time. 
In his first address to the Sejm, or Parliament, since martial law was declared Dec. 13, jaruzelski said some restrictions on civil liberties could be lifted by the end of February, but only if there are no 
"illegal activities" directed against the state, Radio Warsaw reported. Warsaw radio also reported

primary cooling system apparently leaked at the rate of 75 gallons per minute. 
McCabe said about 8,000 gallons of water was standing 9.3 feet deep in the containment sump welL He said the water was probably slightly radioactive, "but certainly not dan­
~erous." 

Last September, the NRC rated the nation's nuclear power plants and found 36, including Ginna, to be average in overall operation. Twenty-one were below average and 1 S were above average. 
gasoline sales would resume in 
February, under a strict rationing 
system. 

In Belgium, Common Market 
representatives meeting at their 
Brussels headquarters agreed to 
push for higher interest rates on 
Common Market export credits 
granted the Soviet Union. 

"Before the 13th of December last 
year, the stability and security of the 
state had been unhinged and the 
economy was crashing," Warsaw 
radio quoted jaruzelski as saying. 
"The threat of fratricidal war was in 
the air." 

Repeated demands for order were ignored, he said. "Agreement was an obstacle for the extremist forces in Solidarity who saw their supreme goal in destruction of the socialist statehood ofPoland ... I charge these forces with paralyzing the authori­ties, with sowing hatred and with breaking the law time and again, with strike terrorism." 
He said lifting of martial law would depend "on the fulfillment of conditions which would secure a permanent, safe and normal course oflife, the smooth functioning ofthe economy." 
He said Poland has a long way to go before martial law is ended. 
"The calendar must not decide the future ofour country, and above all no external pressure whatsoever must decide it," he said in an ap­parent reference to Western demands for the release ofinternees and restoration ofcivil liberties. 
"If no illegal actions develop, if unforeseen circumstances do not arise, these restrictions (on civil liberties) will be lifted, or con­siderably reduced, at any rate, by the end of next month," saidjaruzelski. 
He accused the United States and NATO of indulging in "psychological propaganda aggres­sion" against Poland, especially by withholding food shipments. 
He repeated Polish claims that at­tempts by the West ro have martial law lifted violate the Helsinki ac­cords. Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko was expected to make the same assertion today in talks with Secretary ofState Alexan­der M. Haigjr. in Geneva. 
In Washington, White House spokesman Larry Speakes said diplomatic reports contradict Jaruzelski's claim that repressive measures may soon be lifted. He said jaruzelski's speech seemed to be a justification of martial law, so it "surely could not be characterized as positive in its implications."

HOCKEY -In hockey action this past week Keenan scored three quick goals in the last three minutes to edge a tough Cavanaugh squad, 4-3. The game, which featured more than just good play, came to a close with each team having only three players on the ice. Cavanaugh is off this week while Keenan meets Stanford Thursday night. 
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL -This past Sunday a quick Farley team 
out-ran and out-rebounded Lyons I, and in the end out-scored them, 
25-14. As Lyons coach Dennis Rischard said,"They were a lot quick­
er than we were and were more agressive on the boards". Coach 
Rischard and his team have a chance to improve their record this 
Sunday against Badin, who also picked up a win in this past Sunday's 
competition. The game is slated for 2:30 and will be played in gym II 
of the ACC. 
CROSS COUNTRY SKI -As reported earlier, the NVA will spon­sor a weekend cross country ski rental at a cost of $12 a weekend. The equipment will be issued from 4 to 5 p.m. on Friday afternoons in the room across from the golfshop and should be returned in the same place Sundays at the same time. 
VOLLEYBALL -There is a mandatory meeting for all the captains ofboth men's and women's volleyball teams this Thursday. The men will meet at 4 p.m. and the women at 4:30. Both meetings will be held in the ACC auditorium. 
TRACK -As reported last week, Non-Varsity Athletics is sponsor­ing an indoor track meet for both men and women. The deadline for entries is tomorrow, Jan. 27, and should be submitted to the NVA office ( C-2 ACC ).

The only thing missing was Kool and the Gang. 
"We played so good, it was such a big win," gushed Paxson. "It was great to see the student body in the game, too. They really pulled us through." 
But leave it to the maestro himself to give credit to the students where it was due. 
"They're beautiful," Phelps said. "They got us back in it and they didn't quit on us. 
"We're on a roll now, and we need them. We're only two weeks into the semester, so maybe if we lock the library doors, we'll be all right." 
On this memorable night, when another chapter was penned into the endless anthology of Notre Dame comebacks, the stat sheet 
read thusly: Ron Rowan, 1 7 points; 
Bill Varner, 1 1 points; John Paxson, 
10 points.
