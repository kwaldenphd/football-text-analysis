Editor's note: This is the third part in a series of articles explaining the recommendations of the COUP report and their relation to the Campaign for Notre Dame. 
A major focus of the Committee on University Priorities was on the Catholic character of Notre Dame. In response , the Campaign for Notre Dame seeks $5 million for the endowment of activities enhancing religious values on campus as well as for campus-based religious pro­grams. 
This $5 million endowment will cover four aspects of Notre Dame as a Catholic institution: campus religious life, endowed rectorships, church and chapel maintenance and progams in service of the Catholic church. 
According to Fr. William Toohey director of campus ministry, "We experience the presence of God in nature, in historical events in the scriptures, in the teaching Church in the sacrements. But most predominantly ... we encounter God through other men and women." 
On this basis, campus ministry has cited five programs for foster­ing campus religious life. 
Campus ministry would like to expand its retreats program and money is necessary to underwrite retreats to keep the fees down for students to parrticipate. The retreat program could be subsi­dized by $150,000. 
Funds are also needed to support the publication and distribution on campus of religious material. Campus ministry recently revived the Notre Dame Prayer Book for ;Students but does not have the money to make it available to all students. A fund to meet religious publications needs could be en­dowed at $100,000. 
Campus ministry also would like

a possibility. A projected $150,000 
could underwrite these pastoral 
programs. 
Another program that campus 
ministry believes would enhance 
campus religious life is a religious 
lecture series. In cooperation with 
other departments of the Univer­
sity. campus ministry wants to 
feature "first-rate religious think­
ers" who would contribute to the 
discussion of important spiritual 
and theological issues on campus. 
The series could be fostered by an 
endowment of $100,000. 
Support is also being sought for 
apostolic projects which students 
participate in, such as helping the 
elderly, the retarded and under­
privileged children. 
Endowed Rectombips 

The COUP report stressed the impact that rectors have on the religious values of the students in their halls. "Nothing else we do can have as much influence on han· residents as naming a group ·of competent adults who dedicate 
themselves to living with students 
to help them become mature 
Christians," the report noted. 
In order to make the positions of leadership withing the halls more appealing to qualified candidates, the University plans to endow the rectorships of the four oldest residence halls: St. Edward's, Badin, Sorin and Walsh. The Campaign for Notre Dame is seeking a total endowment of $1 million to endow the four rector­ships. Each rectorship will be allocated ~250,000.

The day opened with the "Super­stars" competition, as 44 men and 6 ladies tried their hand at golf, swimming, pool, free-throw shoot­ing, pinball, beer-guzzling and other events. George Behrens of Dillon won the men's division and Ann Joyce of Lewis won the title for the ladies. 
The Road Rally was also run early Saturday morning, as Paul Knausser from Off-Campus cross­ed the finish line in the least amount of time to win the cham­pionship. 
A team from Stanford won the Ben Hur Chariot Race, defeating the team from Keenan in the finals. 
Steve Soanick played Ben Hur for Stanford, pulled by "horses" Ran­dy Haefner, Terry Leary, Pat McKillen, and John "Thunder" Thornton. 
Flanner won the fish relay race, as Jay Willie Foster, Pete Tremb­lay, Pat Taylor, and Scott Rodgers passed the fish from mouth · to mouth to finish first. 
In the Mud Volleyball finals, Rene Rosenbaum's team defeated Gary Metzler's team, 15-8, 15-13. 

The winner of the Ugly Man on Campus (UMOC) was announced at the Irish Wake, held at Stepan Center Saturday night. Holy Cross' "Beppo" Guido won the title for the second straight year, as he gathered over $1400 worth of votes. Orest Deychakiwsky of Cavanaugh was second, as he received almost $1100 worth of votes. Rounding out the top five were Murray of Murray's Massage Parlor, Rusty Lisch, and "Otto" Principato. 
Sunday concluded the weekend's activities, as the Bookstore finals were held under sunny skies and cold temperatures. A large crowd saw the TILCS, led by Dave Batton, win the title for the second straight year, defeating Billy Paterno's Average White Team, 23-21. 
Sandwiched around the finals were the Jocks vs. Girls basketball game, won by the girls in double­overtime, 53-53, and the Slam­Dunk Contest, won by Chris "Hawk" Stevens, a former Notre Dame player and a frequent guest at basketball pep rallies. Stevens defeated Don "Duck" Williams in the finals to win the contest which was held for the first time this year.

The largest single component of the endowment, $2 million, is set for building up the University's programs in the service of the Church. Several programs now exist at Notre Dame and the University hopes to maintain and expand them. Thes~ programs 
include The Catholic Committee on Urban Ministry (CCUM) , the, Center for Pastoral and , Social Ministry. Continuing Education Program for Clergy, Center for Human Development, and the newest, the Murphy Center for Liturgical Research. 
The programs are basically help­ing those at the level of a diocese or other religious institute but they benefit from their affiliation with Notre Dame. , 
One other important develop­1 ment at Notre Dame is the expan­sion of the program for preparing future priests. The University has had a program of studies for priestly ministry since 1968, but is now actively encouraging Roman Catholic dioceses throughout the nation to send their most promising seminarians to study at Notre

· however, that if more scholarships were available, more top seminar­ians would study at Notre Dame. "Our Catholic character should have its first impress upon our intellectual work. But it should also permeate 'in a way we could hardly describe as secondary -the' community oflearne~s.

Bumperstickers may so~ve student hitchhiking problem 
by Brigid Rafferty Staff Reporter 
Due to the recent rise in un­

pleasant student hitchh;king ex­
periences, the Ombudsmn Service 
is working on a suggestion for 
"Safe Driver" bumperstickers. 
The idea won the "policy" cate­
gory of the Ombudsman's "Oper­
ation Brainstorm" contest. 
The "Safe Driver" idea, sug­

gested by Beth DeLucanay, calls 
for bumper stickers which can be 
seen from long distances, letting 
hitchhikers know that cars on which 
the stickers are placed are safe to 
enter. The stickers would be 
distributed to faculty members, 
staff members and students. 
"It's similar to the 'block home' ,~!.an .i~. ~?~.e..c_i~ies,: '..explai_ned 
Tom Lux, Ombudsman Community Relations director. "It's an ori­ginal idea, it would not be hard to implement, and it is something which needed to be done. because of all the hitchhiking problems. We are looking into the details of how to put it into effect.'' 
According to Lux, the Ombuds­man hopes to put th~ "Safe Dirver" idea into use by this fall, and feels that there is a fairly good chance for its approval. The idea would be turned over to a different division of the Ombudsman to work on, it agreed upon, and presented to Administration officials . 
"The University seems to be against hitchhiking and concerned 
·with the students' safety, so we hope that they will be receptive to the "Safe Driver" idea," Lux 
_ stated.

Listed as Humanistic Studies 373, the one-credit, pass-fail series is now in its seventh year. It was begun in the spring of 1970 as the education department's contribu­tion to the College's 125th anniver­sary. Approximately 160 students participated in the original two­credit "Trends in Contemporary Education" series (Ed. 173) that 
spring. 
The original series was a course oriented to consider particular trends in American education with the implications in every phase of man's life. 
Among the lecturers were such famous educators as Robert M. Hutchins, president of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institu­tions (the first lecturer); Hendrik 
D. Gideonse, a Danforth lecturer; and HowardS. Weaver, dean of the Yale University School of Art .and Architecture, to name a few. 
With a series of such distinguish­ed lecturers, bibliographies, re­quired readings and follow-up dis-· cussion groups, the college provid­ed opportunities for its students, faculty and the people of the South Bend-Mishawaka community to discuss important contemporary issues which face the American public in the field of education. 
Many departments were involv­ed in the series because the lecturers represented interdiscipli­nary approaches to contemporary problems and trends in education. 
Reaction from both students and faculty was extremely favorable. One student at the time thanked

However, at the request of the students attending the series, a fall program was planned integrating other departments more extensive­ly, especially the performing arts. 
The present series has an enroll­ment of 275 students from both St. Mary's and Notre Dame. Atten­

This semester it is co-sponsored by the Performing Arts series, the Notre Dame -St. Mary's theatre and the departments of mathema­tics, religious studies, chemistry and physics, humanistic studies, business and economics, philo­sophy, nursing, history and educa­tion. According to the series founder and coordinator, Sister Maria C. McDermott, "The purpose of the series is to , give faculty and students an opportunity to meet and to hear significant leaders in the contemporary American scene. As it has progressed, the program has increasingly represented a wide cross-~ction of disciplines, with approximately half of the oferings from the theatre and the performing arts.

Rep. Mitchell discusses black political events 

Editor's note: Rep. Parren J. Mitchell [D-Md.], chairman of the Black Congres­sional Congress in Washington, D. C., was in South Bend recendy for the local Urban League's Annual Dinner. Be discussed the functions of the Caucas, Carter's adminis­tration and Black political events with Special Projects Editor Patrick Cole. 
THE OBSERVER: How long have you been in Congress? MITCHELL: I have been in Congress for six years. This is the beginning of the seventh year. Sometimes it seems like 90 years! THE OBSERVER: Could you explain the purpose of the Black Political Caucas? Is this to be confused with the ~ Congressional Caucas? MITCHELL: No, they are two different things altogether. The Congressional 
· Black Congress is made up of the Black men and women who serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. We're all in the Democratic party, but if one was a Republican, we would get him or her to join. But the members of Congress only are members of the Black Congressional Caucas. There is a Black Political Caucas made up of representative and various elected groups. People in New York, Mayor Hatcher in Gary and others make up the Black Political Caucas. They are two distinct groups. We work together well, we coordinate together well, but we are not one of the same. · THE OBSERVER: What was the purpose of its formation? Who founded it? MITCHELL: The formation of the Congres­sional Black Caucas? THE OBSERVER: The Polltical Caucas. MITCHELL: That caucas came into being primarily in response to Nixon's non­responsiveness to Blacks. It came into being regarding the time when Nixon was on his way out, and there was a hope that all the various political Black groups would come together in one small organization, that obviously it could have much more political clout than one independent group operating or two individual groups operat­ing. So that's the reason it essentially came into being. THE OBSERVER: So how long has this been in effect? MITCHELL: It has been in effect just about as long as the caucas, around 1970 it began. 
THE OBSERVER: Now you are chairman of the Political Caucas, right? MITCHELL: No, I'm chairman of the Congressional Caucas. THE OBSERVER: So how is that organized? MITCHELL: We have a board of officers, a vice-chairman and a treasurer and so forth. 
We have an executive committee-it is not highly structured because there are only a handful of Black people serving in the Congress. There are only 16 of us. And that says something about America. There are 435 members who serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. And we are only 16 of that 435. We lost one seat because of Andy Young who went to the United Nations as the ambassador there and he was replaced by a white person. 
THE OBSERVER: Are you concerned about social issues, issues that apply to ' only Black people? Does the Caucas speak for all causes? MITCHELL: For all causes, but our obvious thrust is got to be for Black people and I'm not ashamed of that. For as long as Blacks do not truly enjoy full citizenship in this country, there's got to be some 

spokesman, a group advocating the cause 
of Blacks. But what we do in terms of our 
work in our legislation, we advocate for 
Blacks -for all minorities and for all the 
poor. Obviously many whites have 
benefited from the things we have done. I 
hope some Blacks have benefited from 
what we have done -I hope that they have. 
In act. I know that they have. 
THE OBSERVER: Does having a caucas 
take care of some of the needs and 
concerns of Black Legislators -the prob­
lems that some Black Legislators may have 
in Washington? 
MITCHELL: Well, not really. You see, by 
being members of Congress we are the 
legislators. Each one of us is a legislator. 
And we try to handle legislation that can 
help Black Americans. If there is a state 
senator in Georgia who is working in the 
Georgia assembly and he needs some help 
in terms of legislation, we try to help him 
with that. Our primary goal is legislation 
at the Federal level, not at the state, not at 
the citv level. THE OBSERVER: Bow do you view Carter's administration so far? Do you think it is good or bad? In what areas has he promised to give help to Blacks? MITCHELL: I have very mixed emotions about the Carter administration. There have been some good things accomplished, and some things that have caused me a great deal of personal dissappointment. For example, I was convinced that we would have at least two Blacks appointed to Cabinet positions. This has not been done. Ambassador Young is not truly a member 
ofthe Cabinet. So we can't count him as a cabinet position. We have only one and that's Secretary Harris at HUD (Housing and Urban Development) and that was a bitter disappointment. I have been disap­pointed at the failure to appoint blacks in sufficient numbers in the lower level positions -assistant secretary, deputy and so forth. It's been a dismal failure and we have talked to the President about this and he is aware how bitterly disappointed we are. The third bitter disappointment for me is the failure of the Carter administra­tion to move in a bold and courageous fashion in terms of the joblessness in this country. That was one of his main campaign promises -he was going to put America back to work. But the Administra­tion, in my opinion, has been very timid and cautious and has not done the job necessary to put America back to work. THE OBSE\(VER: How has Carter respon­ded to .V"q · ' 1111appointments? MITCHELL: Well, he has indicated that he still retains his committment to end 
joblessness, but it must be done at a pace, and my counterargument is: how long can people out of work remain out of work? He has also indicated that he's going to do much more in terms of assistant deputy spots and deputy spots and two-thirds have yet to be fifled. And he alleges that he is going to do a much better job for Blacks in filling those spots. But based on the performance to date, obviously I have some skepticism about it. THE OBSERVER: I know that the appoint­ment of Attorney General Griffin Bell caused a lot of controversy across the nation. How did the Caucas respond to that? 
MITCHELL: The caucas authorized me to go and testify against Griffin Bell's nomination which I did. I testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee practically all day one day opposing Griffin Bell. THE OBSERVER: And what did you see besides his negative background? MITCHELL: It was clear to me that he had not been one of the advocates for desegregation in the South. As I understand it, it was a difficult time. You had some men and some judges who stood up against the mob during that time. Griffin Bell didn't. Judge Minor Wisdom was a very courageous judge. You had some people in state offices -Frank Graham in North Carolina -who simply stood up against the mob and who were going to do what was right. But from all I 
·could gather, Griffin Bell was never an advocate. He was never the person out there telling the mob, "You're wrong." Now he alleged· that he was a concilliator. Well I didn't find much in the record to indicate that he conciliated. Indeed, it was quite to the contrary that he was apparent­ly the prime resistor in desegregation, the strategist behind this. THE OBSERVER: Now that he's being watched and people have objected to his appointment, do you think that he'll change in any way? MITCHELL: Well, strangely enough, he's done better than any other cabinet member in appointing Blacks. The Black Caucas met with him abQut a month ago, and he 
broughrin a list of his Black appointees. It's far better than any other cabinet member ­even Patricia Harris'! Of course we praised him for that, but I pointed out to him that this is only part of the issue. I want to see how the Justice L>epartment is going to react to further attempts to demise

ND-SMC theater given award 
The Notre Dame-St. Mary's Theatre will receive a Volunteer Award today from the St. Joseph Valley's division of Project Head­start. 
Project Headstart is a child development program that gives pre-school children from eco­nomically and culturally disadvan­taged backgrounds the develop­mental resources they need to enter school. The Volunteer Awards, presented annually at a banquet at Zion Church in down­town South Bend, are given in honor·of those groups throughout the community that have contri­buted significantly during the year to the Deadstart program. 
Every year the Notre D~me-St. Mary's Theatre lends its services to Project Headstart by sending groups of students to most of the eighteen Headstart centers in the area. The groups perform enter­taining and educational skits for the children in the program. In the past, the groups have even dressed up as clowns and held a Oown Day at tbe..downtown Mall. 
. school desegregation. I want to see how the Justice Department is going to react to real enforcement of civil rights. And I told the Attorney General that if he comes through at the end of the year looking good, that I would be the first to apologize. But he's on test for a year! 
THE OBSERVER: Newsweek reported that Julian Bond was trying to persuade Young not to accept the U.N. Ambassador post. This may have been in the interests of the state of Georgia. But bow did the other members of the Caucas respond? MITCHELL: I felt all of the members of the Caucas would have preferred Ambas­sador Yound to stay in Congress. It was his decision to make and we can't get inside a man's head to know exactly what's going on. There is tremendous symbolic value to being the first Black ambassador to the United Nations. On the other hand, we felt because of his unique relationship with the President and the very pressing domestic problems we have, then perhaps we Black people would have been better off had he stayed. THE OBSERVER: So do you think the needs of Blacks can be better served being in the position that he presendy is in rather than in Congress? MITCHEU: I think he could better serve the domestic needs of Blacks by being in the Congress. And there is another dimension to it. Obviously it is important that we 'develop a real significant, viable linkage between Black Americans and Black Africans. I think that's tremendous­ly important. I think we should have the same fervent feeling and commitment to Africa as do the people of the Jewish faith have towards Israel. To the extent that his service as ambassador to the Untted Nations will facilitate that linkage between Black Africa and Black America, to the 
extenct that his service will strengthenthat bond. then he is also serving Black people in this other .dimension. THE OBSERVER: When he was appointed some people expressed concern about his qualifications, that he didn't. have much background in foreign relations. How did you see his qualifications? MITCHELL: When I first ran for Congress, people questioned my qualifica­tions. When Shirley Chisolm first ra.n, people questioned her qualifications. And I think there's always the question when the person is Black · how qualified is he or she. And I just think that if you're a good administrator and a smart person and willing tolearn, you don't need a whole lot of qualifications. I think I could do. that job at the United Nations, surrounding myself with good, talented people and being a good administrator. I think I could serve as the President of the United States. And I think Andrew Young could, and I thin Harold Ford of Tennessee could. It's a question of the extent to which you are a good student and the extent to which you surround yourself with good people who are able, dedicated and knowledgeable. THE OBSERVER: What about the appointment of other Blacks? Do you think Patricia Banis to the BUD post was a wise decision? · MITCHELL: Pat Harris is a remarkable woman. If you've seen the pictures of her or seen her in person, she's beautiful! But that shouldn't mislead anyone. She's tough as nails and awfully sharp and a tough lawyer and is committed to equal housing for Americans. I think it's an excellent appointment. She is going to make mistakes. Who doesn't? I think the President has always made mistakes. A few mistakes don't worry me. It's the overall dedication and the overall commit­ment that one brings to the job. THE OBSERVER: At this point, what aspects of Black society need to be improved most? MITCliELL: I guess the overriding tragedy in my mind is that you got Black Americans who enjoy the trappings of equality, the trappings of America. And that ten per cent is being used as sort of a showcase with 16 members of Congress around the world or some Blacks serving on the board of General Motors. The overriding tragedy is that most Black people have not seen their lives substan­tially better in the last ten years. So I guess the essential problem for me is to prevent classness from developing where a certain group, a certain percentage enjoy some of the trappings of America, and in so doing it, separate them from the masses. And I think that would be a monumental mistake for Blacks. THE OBSERVER: Thank you, Mr. MltcheU for your time. MITCBRJ.J,:. You're quite welcome.

members of the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community to have short works of litera­ture published in print. Hopefully, this project will provide an alternative to the more conventional outlets for the literary talents of students, staff and faculty. Anyone interested in submitting works for consideration need on1y bring them to the Observer office or call 7471. Here's hoping that you enjoy today's stories, the first in what will hopefully become a steady diet of solid literature by members of the univer­sity community. 
"Leonard, I think I'll die next week." Walter said the words between bites of pastrami pizza. "OK Walt, you do that," Leonard said with a frown. "But will you quit picking the mushrooms off your pizza? It really bugs me when you do that--it really does." Walter held a small mush­room balanced on his thumb, and stared at it contemplatively. 
"No, I mean it Lenny. I had this dream, see. I dreamed I was in this big forest. It was real dark, and I couldn't get out, so I started walking until I came to this cleared part, and saw a hole or something. And I walked up to it, and, Lenny, you know what it was? It was a grave, Lenny, and there was this big concrete tombstone with a spotlight or something on it--you know, like one of those lights that are attached to the top of big pictures in museums and places, and you know what it said?" Leonard noticed that Walter had a piece of cheese stuck between his front teeth, but didn't say anything. "It said ... " Walter leaned over the table and squinted intensely behind his spectacles. "It said--Here Rests the Soul of Walter Bradly Hatford the Third. A Great Man with Simple Tastes." 
Walter leaned back and closed his eyes, allowing his head to fall limply onto his shoulder. "Cut it out Walter," Leonard said. "You give my the creeps." Walter opened his eyes, and shrugged.

Photojournalism 
From Man To Clown 
by Maureen Sajbel 
I walked into the Stepan Center an hour before the first performance of the Emmett Kelly Jr. Circus. I wanted to take pictures of the clowns putting on makeup for a photography class project, but knew that this was usually a forbidden practice. Oowns, like actors, don't want the public to see them making up for a show. It takes the magic out of the transformation from man to clown. 
One of the circus performers pointed out a young boy with a star earring in his left ear and said, "Ask Paul about the clowns." The boy was short, but must have been at least 20 years old. He said that I could talk to his dad. who was a clown. We walked together through the drizzle to the area where all the motor homes and trucks were parked. He rang a doorbell and I was ushered into the mobile home of Emmett Kelly Jr. 
The dirty blue carpet of the mobile home showed evidence of heavy traffic, and papers lay on the floor in random piles. A stereo with large speakers played big-band music from the kitchen counter, and a black fur covered bed was raised on a platform at the near end of the trailer.

that this student had permission to watch

"You're really lucky," he said.

The slight man sat down, lit a cigarette 
and then began kneading his pink rubber

he used only a handmirror and desklamp. 
He said that he had to skip shaving in the

This is the home of one of the world's best known clowns and his wife. Kelly's mother-in-law was visiting and she rested on a couch covered by a comforter. 
After introducing myself, I asked the performer if I could take pictures of him putting on his clown makeup. The thin figure clad in mismatched pants and shirt looked more like a 60-year-old farmer than a circus clown. He was unshaven and smoked an unfiltered cigarette. 
He hesitated and then said I was welcome to. 
I had some spare time before he would begin his makeup, so I wandered around outside in the parking lot. A small clown, a boy of ten, was putting on his grease paint 
in the back of a circus wagon. He carefully applied his own makeup flawlessly. I sat with him and we talked of his correspon­dence school,· the makeup he was getting all over his pants, and how he liked what he was doing.

As Leonard slowly opened his eyes, a waitress was leaning over the table, replacing the empty plate with another steaming pastrami pizza. "Now you sit there and tell me you can't eat that?" 
Walter looked down at the plate, shaking his head. "I don't know, Lenny. It's just

"This is it, Lenny. The last time you'll ever see me picking off mush­rooms." Leonard frowned, and walked without a word to the orders .counter. When he returned, Walter had just finished the last piece, and was leaning back in his seat with his eyes closed and his hands folded on his lap. Leonard watched him for a while, and finally nudged his shoulder. "OK Walt, you can get off it now. You are the biggest goddamn try--really." 
He picked up a piece and held it before him, shaking his head. He bit delicately at the tip, grimacing. Lenny watched closely, smiling mischievously. Walter swallowed with great effort, then took another, larger bite. "Hey Lenny, this is pretty good. And no mushrooms." 
"Hal I knew it!"Leonard cried, sitting back triumphantly. "You and your dreams. You're so full of it, Walter. I never thought I'd find myself buying you a pizza, but it was worth every cent just to prove you wrong. God, you are so dumb." 
"Yeah, you're right Lenny," Walter said as he finished off the piece and reached for another. "I guess I'm not going to die next week after aiL" Walter wiped his mouth. "Yep, I guess I'm pretty stupid some­times. Oh, here, would you like a piece?"

Kelly 'had many things to worry about. The weather might keep people away, and the shift in location from St. Mary's to Notre Dame was an unexpected change. Also, the circus had had problems with truck breakdowns on the way, and supplies and equipment had been forgotten in the commotion and switching of trucks. 
He donned an oversized ragmuffin coat that "matched" his tattered, patched and pinned pants. His shoes were bulbous and oversized. He ran his fingers through his randomly styled hair and placed a crown­tess hat on his head. Emmett Kelly Jr., the clown, was complete.

Escapee commits suicide after shooting. girlfriend 
PATI'ERSON* La. [API -A prison escapee shot and wound­ed a former girlfriend and her infant daughter, then held a young woman hostage for six hours before releasing her and killing himself, police said. 
Robert Broomfield, 27, was found shot once in the head after tear gas was fired into the house where he was hiding, ~ Police Chief Jessie Paul said. He said police fired no shots. 
Moments earlier, Broomfield had released his hostage, iden­tified as 19-year-old Neva Og­win, unharmed. Police said he was armed with two pistols but had agreed to trade the girl for a shotgun and five shells. 
Broomfield never got the gun, which had been shoved through an open door, because the. girl brought it out with her, Paul said. 
"When he released her, we asked him to come out, but he said he wasn't coming and wouldn't be put in jail," Paul said. He said officers then fired the tear gas and heard two shots. 
Broomfield, serving time for two burglary convictions, was wanted for simple escape after failing to return from an Easter leave at'a prison in Lafayette. 
Paul said yesterday's incident began about 3:30 a.m. when Broomfield broke into the home of Dolores Watts, 21, in this community 100 miles west of New Orleans. 
She told police that Broom­field was expecting her to have money for the two of them to flee to Houston. 
Paul said an argument began when the woman didn't have the money and Broomfield shot the woman three times and shot her 2-year-old daughter, Alon­da, at least once. 
The woman was listed in satisfactory condition at a near­by hospital and the child was taken to New Orleans for sur­gery. 
When neighbors called po­lice, Broomfield broke into ano­ther home nearby. When police arrived, they found Broomfield holding the teen-ager hostage, and the six-hour stakeout be­~an.

South Bend history
Inner city housing offers advantages  
by Karen Hinks 

Editor's note: This is the last in a three-part series describing the efforts to preserve the historical heritage of South Bend. 
People become interested in buying a home in the inner city to restore it to its natural state only to become discouraged when they discover they cannot receive a loan. 
Jeff and David Gibney, brothers who are currently renovating an old house, attribuje_ the pr<;>blem to economics and sociology. 
"Let's face it, people stay away from the city because of the interracial balance," they said. "They fear the crime associated with city living." Both claim the area is not "the safest neighbor· hood in town, but we don't walk the streets with steel helmets on. This neighborhood has had the same reputation for twenty years--really 
ever  since  the  neighborhood  be­ 
came integrated."  
According  to  the brothers,  not  

only then are the city dwellings inexpensive but because of its questionable state, neighborhood homes are difficult to purchase. An example of this is a home bought in the Chapin Street area for $7500. The structure, as described by the owner. is in good condition and maintenance-free for five years. 
It is true that houses are avail­able but loans are difficult to obtain. The home on Chapin was sold by the previous owner on a land contract and interest free because of problems in the area. The present owners feel the crime level is "not what it's made out to be." 
After the encounter with the loan department of the banks, the Gibney's left discouraged. They had learned of an organization, Southhold Heritage Foundation, Inc. The foundation was created to "seek and administer funds in an attempt to help reserve the archi­tectural heritage of St. Joseph County". The foundation views the pieservation of neighborhoods as its ultimate program and focuses its first and primary interest on the West Washington Historic District. 
'We had heard of Southhold and that they had a revolving loan for home improvements and home acquisition," David recalls. "The revolving loan is made with the intention of allowing the Ioanee to restore the home. The foundation allows approximately a year or two to make the improvement. The home is the re-mortgaged with a conventional loan from a bank." 
Ten months later the Gibney's opened their home to the commun­ity for inspection and approval. 
Despite their varied and gifted . talents; the Gibney's-are ordinary people. Jeff teaches pre-school children and David builds new homes. Their interests vary. They make many, many creative things and their talent is manifested through the work in their home. Both men stressed however that they do not make a lot of money. Yet thev wanted a nice home and the city 'seemed to be the only place  to go. 
. -. 
The attractive aspect ot the neighborhood is the variety of people. Jeff observed that stu­dents, artists, professors and fami­lies live in the neighborhood be­cause of its charm and uniqueness. ·These people seem to be interes­ted in more than just a home for an investment. They are interested in a good home life.'' 
Friends often question the a­mount of labor, time and money that has been invested in the restoration. Their reply is a simple one: "So what. who cares." 
"When our friends ask us these questions we just answer, what else would we do in our spare time?'' 
The "spare-time" spent hand­painting designs on walls rather than wall-papering. skylighting ceilings. installing hard wide-board tloors. is time rarely spent today in home improvement. The Gibney's feel much of the quality of making things is lost. "Personally, no one considers they can crochet a table cloth. Sure it takes thousands of hours. but in the end, who cares? People used to spend their time doing those kinds of things and today we still have the same exact amount of time. We just choose to spend it doing ridiculous kinds of things." 
So the Gibney's attempted to make use of their time by making restoration a second job. The hand painting of the wall took hours and hours but ''we saved a bundle and we know we'll never bump into it again anywhere else but in our own home. Essentially, it's a poor man's method of decorating." 
The best advice the brothers can give to those interested in repeat­ing what they did is, "You must make a commitment to the house, the neighborhood, the labor and to yourself." They will both confirm the investment has beenwell worth it all. · 
Executive Director of. Southhold Heritage Foundation Ruth Price, views preservation and conserva­tion as a movement of concern in the entire country to preserve our natural resources. She defined the word "historic" as applying to sites, buildings and structures that have historical significance to the nation. "But," she stressed, "it goes a great deal beyond all of that.'' 
She observes that we are all caught in what's happening in the cities today. We destroy, demolish and cut-up into apartments, struc­tures that have been built of exceptionately good materials and workmanship. "In essence," she explained, "the character of the building is being violated when its desi!m is changed or altered.'' 
The belief of Southhold and the Historic Preservation Commission is if the structure is basically a good design, it should stand the test of time. Price emphasized that preservation is a far-reaching field. 
"It is not limited to historic ideas, and is certainly not a movement to create a lot of museums." Price explained that during the industrial period, many people became weal­thy overnight. The money was put into the homes. She cited Tippeca­noe Place, the former Studebaker mansion, as an example. Tippeca­noe has twenty fireplaces, no two are alike. Solid. wook on the walls, tloors, woodwork and doors, was imported from all over the world along with metals, marbles and chandaliers. 
She stated that the house is "Far too large" to be used for a family anymore and has never been updated. "Tippecanoe is such a beautiful home and the job of the preservationist is to discover ways for the structure to be used and enjoyed by the people of the community." 
And the people do come if for parties, receptions and dances. "They come in, pay a few dollars which goes back into the upkeep and they have the opportunity to use the building to its fullest." 
Price feels one of the biggest enemies of the inner city is the FHA. "When FHA was set up after the Depression to help people· get mortgages, it was strictly on the side of new construction and for the development of suburbs." The resulting effect of the federally insured money, according to Price is that the money went into the suburbs and so one was left to insure the inner city. 
The government is seen by Price as making a contribution to the eventual downfall ofthe inner city. But with the cost of housing construction so very high, people are coming back to the inner city simply because they can get good housing at a lower cost. 
Price pointed out the Southhold Foudation was the first commission initiated in Indiana for the promo­tion of historic restoration. But neighboring Elkhart has now joined in as the fourth comhtission. She attributes this to the growing awareness and sensitivity to tradi­tion and heritage that seems to be growing nationwide. 
She likens preservation to a family. "Every generation makes their contribution to society wheth­er in politics, economics or educa­tion. Grandparents need their children and grandchildren need their grandparents. .If every gen­eration were to begin without that backlog of grandparents and great­grandparents, they'd be forced to start from the beginning. Instead, grandparents provide that sense of respect of time for you." 
PriCe described buildings as being the same way. They are the face and geneology of the city. "We can build today and tomorrow we can look back on what we've built--we get a sense of time."
