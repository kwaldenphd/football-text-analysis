It"s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, and the Alumni hall chapel is just one of many places on campus decorated for the holiday sea son. Many dorms on campus prepare for Christmas with door decorating contests, Secret Santa gift exchanges and holiday parties. 
MONTREAL (AP) -The gunman who ranged through the University of Montreal's engineering school and killed 14 women carried a suidde let­ter complaining that women had spoiled his life and he was seeking revenge. police said Thursday. 
The young killer -identified Thursday night as Marc Lapin -also wounded nine women and four men before killing himself Wednesday in the worst mass murder in Canadian his­tory. 
As he roamed through the modern. six-story engineering building firing a rifle. Lapin ranted. "I want the women!" and "You're all a bunch of feminists! I hate feminists!" witnesses told police. 
Escort service to debut in January 
By KELLEY TUTHILL Assistant News Editor 
The student security escort service will get underway early next semester and will employ 60-70 student workers. 
"The project has received funding from the University," according to Gina Mahony. chair of the student security escort service. 
There will be a meeting Mon­day for all those interested in applying to be a student escort. 
Mahony said that the service needs 60-70 students, both male and female. The position will probably be a paid one, however. the funding for the escort service has yet to go through the budget process, said Student Body President Matt Breslin. 
The service will run Sunday through Thursday evenings >even p.m. to one a.m.. accord­ing to Mahony. Escorts will op­erate out of the Information Desk on the first loor of LaFortune Student Cen, r. 
The student escort service will have its own telephone line and escorts will communicate to a dispatcher through two­way radios which Notre Dame Security will be able to monitor, said Mahony. Escorts will al­ways travel in pairs. 
"Student Affairs, Business Affairs and Security have all been extremely helpful," Ma­hony said. 
Breslin said the idea for the escort service was Mahony's, who is now a member of Stu­dent Government's cabinet. He said seniors Michele Feick, Jim Schilder and Patrick Smith have all been active in getting the escort service organized. 
The service will be run by Student Government, however Breslin said he believes that someday the service might op­erate independently. Student Government will be responsible for the hiring of employees and publicizing the service. 
"We're looking for the sup­port of the hall staff in publicizing the service," said Breslin. "We need the rectors, 
One of the wounded remained in critical but stable condition Thursday. The rest were out of danger. 
Little was known of the killer's background, but the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said police confirmed his iden­tity through his mother and quoted detective Sgt. Robert Fuller as giving the man's name as Marc Lapin. 
In his letter, Lapin said he was committing a "political act" in killing the women be­cause "feminists had always ruined my life." police reported. 
Senior police investigator Jacques Duscheneau told a news conference Lapin used a .223-caliber Sturm Ruger semi­automatic assault rifle. 
Lapin also carried a hunting knife and sheath, two boxes of bullets and a 30-bullet clip. 

He was described as being about 5-foot-9 inches, weighing 
resident assistants and security monitors to instill the idea (of the service) in the minds of stu­dents." 
He said that the support of Student Affairs and Security is very important to keep the ser­vice running in a consistent manner from year to year, as the composition Student Gov­ernment is constantly changing. 
"We haven't hit any brick walls," said Breslin. "Everyone has been very supportive of the service." 
Applications for student escorts will be available at the meeting as well as from the student government secretary on the second floor of LaFor­tune Student Center from De­cember 11-15. 
Interested students must submit applications by Decem­ber 21. Decisions will be made early next semest:er and all hired escorts must attend a training session. 
The informational meeting will take place Monday 8 p.m., Sorin Room, LaFortune. 
about 160 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. 
Duscheneau said the rifle "is the type of weapon you can buy for hunting reasons" in Canada with proper certification. 
Andre Tessier, director of op­erations of the Montreal police, told reporters Lapin had ob­tained a permit for the rifle. 
Canada's gun control laws are generally stricter than those in the United States. 
Duscheneau said "'it was quite clear" that a three-page handwritten letter signed "Marc" and found on Lapin's body was a suicide note. He said it specified Dec. 6 as the date for Lapin's death. 
He said it contained the names of 15 women that were believed taken from a newspa-

Special to The Observer 
Advances in science and technology promise to make the 10 years that begin this Jan. 1 a decade of unparal­leled accomplishment. But damage to the atmosphere, accumulation of solid wastes. the spread of AIDS and other threats also make the 1990s a decade of po­tential peril.

Military gets budget limits 
WASHINGTON (AP)-President Bush has told Defense Secretary Dick Cheney the Pentagon can spend "a little more than $292 billion" during the next fiscal year, a belt-tightening figure that means military spending won't keep pace with inflation, Pentagon sources said Thursday. 
"It's going to be a net reduction in real growth," meaning an increase in actual spending of less than the ex­pected inflation rate of 4.1 percent, said the source, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name. 
The budget debate for 1991 comes amid the Pentagon's attempts to grap­ple with restraints over the long term in light of eased tensions abroad and bud­get-deficit problems at home. 
Cheney has ordered the service chiefs to come up with plans that could allow up to $180 billion to be trimmed from future budgets in the years from 1992 to 1994. 
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Cheney received a figure

per. but declined to elaborate except to say not all were public figures. 
Duscheneau told reporters the letter said Lapin was seek­ing revenge on women. 
"He mentioned in the letter that he did that because of po­litical reasons. He said femi­nists kind of spoiled his life and he hasn't been happy in life for the last seven years," the offi­cer said. 
"I think he blamed women in general, saying that if his life was ruined it was mainly be­cause of women," Duchesneau told reporters. 
The letter also mentioned former army Cpl. Denis Lortie, who was sentenced to life im­

that there was no longer a need to sleep on the cold, hard noors of O'Shag, in line behind 200 other students, praying to --------­get into the philosophy course I wanted. Fifteen-minutes-on-the-phone-and-you're­done-registering sounded great. 
But then I began to hear the gripes. Classes were filling quickly. I thought that, as a junior, I'd be okay. But even many second semester seniors couldn't get into some courses. 
When I first called DAHT, armed with my PIN and two alternate English courses, I didn't think I might not get into them. 
After going through the entire list of English courses, I finally got into one class. The rest were either full or conflicted with the other courses I already had. So I thought I'd drop and add courses. 
As I picked up the phone again, I remembered a nightmarish but true story of a student who went to the Registrar's office to drop a class and add another that he heard had one more space. But by the time the office dropped his original course and called up the new one, that space had been filled. The student wasn't too bothered and he resolved to stay with his first choice. When the original was called up, his old space was gone! 
I decided I wasn't going risk losing the two classes that I'd gotten earlier that day. I called each department to plead for help. To my dismay, I discovered that not even the department heads could help me. They had no control over the DAHT process. I even tried calling a professor in hopes that he could add me to his roster. If the professors, departments and the Hegistrar can't control DART, who can? 
I was told to continue "calling DAHT back every night" in case somebody dropped out of the courses I wanted. That meant time, and a miracle. The alternative was waiting until the DAHT process was over to work out my schedule. This meant even more timn. 
I realize the Administration was trying to help the students and faculty by replacing the chaotic, time-consuming checkmarking system with a more advanced. organized registering system. But by creating something that it has no direct control of­something too systemized to allow for the inevitable exceptions to the rules -it made registering doubly chaotic and time­consuming. 
Maybe the system's wrinkles will smooth 
out. But whm1 fall pre-registration begins I

Nun urges women to fight for sexual equality in the Church 
Friday, December 8, 1989 
The Observer page 3 

By PAUL PEARSON News Writer 
Women need to fight for more equality in the Catholic Church, Sister Theresa Kane said in a videotape presented at the Center for Social Concerns Thursday. 
The videotape, sponsored by the Committee on Women's Or­dination, was recorded last Oc­tober on the 1Oth anniversary of Kane's address to Pope John Paul II about the plight of women in the Church. 
In the tape, Kane said that women need to feel " ... not only an awareness for the wholeness of life, but an awareness for the holiness of life." 
When efforts to reach that awareness arc blocked, Kane said, "We need to cry out with courage and with rage. We are called to be artisans and au­thors of our own destiny," Kane said. 
Kane laid out three goals for women in the Church. The first is to " ... be imbued with an awareness for the necessity of equality in Christian life." 
While women remain unequal in the Church, Kane said, " ... we do indeed continue forms of idolatry." 
Secondly, Kane called for Catholic women, who are " ... spiritually and psychologi­cally homeless in the Church," to cry out for an end to home­lessness. 
Thirdly, Kane called for the changing of God's image in people's daily lives. "Patriarchy...has been with us for over 5,000 years .... We view God exclusively as male and as Father," she said. 
To sum up, Kane called on all Catholics to further the cause of equality in the Church. "Let's not only wait for it. Let's work for its realization."

By PATRICK HEALY News Writer 
.Jawanza Kunjufu, president of African American Images, spoke on the problems facing blacks in America in a Year of the Family lecture. 
Lecturing on "The Black Family" to a large and enthusi­astic audience, Kunjufu cited the three most pressing prob­lems facing blacks as self-es­teem. economics, and drugs. 
On the topic of black self-es­teem, Kunjufu said that blacks do not understand who they are and some don't even care. He said that the black value system is in conflict with its race be­cause blacks are taught history that is focused on Western cul­ture, are told that beauty con­sists of light skin. long hair, and blue eyes, and have been told who they are by others since the time of slavery. 
lie said that the first humans were black. as were Jesus and King David, and offered several examples to show that many black achievements are over­looked in teaching history . 
At one point in the lecture, Kunjufu asked a mostly black audience if they could name many prominent blacks in science, literature, and educa­tion, as compared to those in sports, television, and music­few could. 
Speaking on self-esteem, Kunjufu stated that "racism is a sign of insecurity, not inferi­ority." He said that whites "know more about you {blacks}, than you know about yourself," and that learning about racism and black history would help blacks to deal with this problem. 
Kunjufu accused the media of focusing on blacks when dis­cussing poverty. He noted that almost two-thirds of the poor are white and that a sizable percentage of blacks make over $40.000 a year. He said audience participated in a brief discussion of what has hap­pened since the address to Pope John Paul II. One participant stated that since then, "there has never been a reply." 

Another participant defended women's current place in the Church. On the subject of the ordination of women, she said, "Being ordained is not going to matter when you're doing priestly things." 
Another participant asked about the Committee's tactics. "If you want to speak to the Church, why are you only talk­ing to the University?" he asked. 
To conclude the evening, the audience conducted a brief prayer service where they called the people to " ... speak our truth in love without vengeance

Saint Mary's senior Mary Firth prepares her work for the Senior 
Art Exhibit at Moreau Hall, December 8-15. away." 

Speaker praises blacks as the 'world's strongest people' 
that economically blacks "are not monolithic" and shouldn't be put in the same group of which the media speaks. 

A major theme of the lecture was that blacks who are suc­cessful should not forget the others less fortunate. He said that black values had changed from "we to I", from coopera­tion to competition, and from interior feelings to exterior ap­pearances. He stated that those who have done should give thanks to God, good teachers and caring parents. 
Kunjufu asked the audience if they could have been as suc­cessful if they had been born into a less fortunate environ­ment. He told them to give back some of the success they have had to those in need. 
Speaking on drugs, Kunjufu criticized Reagan and Bush for cutting the Coast Guard's bud­get. He said they are afraid to cut out a $150 billion dollar drug industry from which, he .Jelieves, banks receive funds. He added that 76 percent of drug users are white. 

He presented many sugges­tions for solving the drug prob­lem, such as focusing on the poor, self-esteem, halting sales of drug paraphernalia, and in­creasing the number of treat­ment centers. 
Kunjufu proposed giving the money from drug busts to the community, stating that the "police are in on the take" from these busts. He said that com­munities must organize them­selves as well as drug dealers do. 
Kunjufu praised blacks as the "world's strongest people" be­cause they survived their trans­fer from Africa to America, slavery and the depression. However, he says that "America believes they have us" in re­gards to AIDS, drugs, teenage pregnancy and unemployment. 
He also stated that "America would rather have {blacks] on

The speaker also criticized "the design purpose of schools" which he said was to either "destroy" blacks or to "make them white," by trying to make them embrace white values. 
Kunjufu offered many solu­tions to the problems he pre­sented in his lecture. He said blacks must study history, un­derstand racism and become familiar with God. He also pro­posed effective time manage­ment, knowledge of economics and politics, and good diet and exercise. 
On a community level, Kun­jufu stressed programs con­cerned with culture awareness, tutorials, rites of passage, ju­nior businesses and role mod­els.

Former Boeing Co. exec. convicted on 39 counts 

ALEXANDHIA, Va. lAP) -A federal court jury Thursday eonvkted a formnr Boeing Co. marketing nxncutive on :~9 counts arising from his possession of secret l'entagon budget documents. 
The 12-member jury in U.S. District Court deliberated about two hours be­fore returning the verdiets against Hiehard Lee Filwlnr. who worked for Boeing from 197H until he was fired in 19H6 after an investigation was b11gun. 
Fowler <:ould be sentenced to 310 years in prison and firwd $225,000 if the maximum penalties are ifllposed. The eounl'i with whkh he was charged inducted eonspiraey, mail fraud and il­legal conveyance of dassified docu­m11nl'i. 
Boeing has pleaded guilty to receiving dassilied documents from Fowler and has agreed to pay lines of $5.2 million. In addition, the company's Washington­area office has been suspended from bidding on governnwnt contracts, a largely symbolk punishment. 
Fowler raced the jury as thl1 Vl1rdiet was read, occasionally dosing his eyes while members of his family cried in thn bat:kground.

Fowler's attorneys said they would appeal the verdict and sentencing was set for Jan. 12. lie will remain free on bond. 
"This ease, in my view, puts everyone in the defense contracting industry on notic11 that theft, conversion and con­veyance of dassified documents will not be tolerated," said U.S. Attorney llenry Hudson. 
Hudson said investigations will con­tinue into the trafficking of classified Pentagon documents. 
John Bray, Fowler's attorney, said he was disappointed and the "first day pa­rade of brass was no help." A string of generals testified the first day of the trial. 
Bray said the verdict "certainly ... has a signal in it. But this ease isn't over." 
In testimony this week, employees of several def11nse contractors said they were part of a nine-company network hose Washington representatives traded Pentagon budget documents in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

ND receives human rights grant 

Special to The Observer 
The University of Notre Dame Law School's Center for Civil and Human Rights has received a $280,000 grant from the Ford Foundation to establish a teaching and research program in international human rights law. 
"We are grateful to the Ford Foundation for this timely and important grant," said Univer­sity President Father Edward Malloy. "Because the problems of international human rights require our most disciplined and persistent efforts, Notre Dame intends to build on the Ford Foundation's participa­tion by seeking permanent en­dowment for the Center for Civil and Human Rights and by encouraging other institutes and academic departments to collaborate in its endeavors." 
According to Father William Lewers. professor of law and director of the Center. "As a Catholic university, Notre Dame has a traditional and solid commitment to human rights

The spokesman said the de­partment now must make its plans conform with the new figure, for the fiscal year be­ginning next Oct. 1, so they may be included in the formal pre­sentation of the president's which makes it a natural home for this sort of project." 
The new program, while based in the Law School, will cooperate with Notre Dame's Kellogg Institute for Interna­tional Affairs, the Institute for International Peace Studies, the Department of Government and International Studies, and other academic units of the University. 
A major component of the program will be its offer of a master of laws degree in international human rights for lawyers primarily, though not exclusively, from outside the United States. The program will also assist in developing a joint degree program in law and peace studies. 
During each academic year. the program will bring to Notre Dame visiting faculty members from other countries. In 1990­91, the principal visitor will be Igor Grazin, professor of con­stitutional law at Tartu Uni­versity in Soviet Estonia. Grazin

Cheney himself has said he will not have his budget labeled "dead-on-arrival" because it contained unrealistic expecta­tions of increased spending.

In the budget for the present fiscal year, Pentagon appropri­committee on constitutional re­form.

U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, the Center at first con­centrated on civil rights in the United States. In recent years, its interests have expanded to include human rights issues both in this nation and abroad.

"Just last week demoeraey was challenged in the Philip­pines," Bush said. "And w.e stood with President Aquino and we eontinue to stand with her and with dPmoeraey now. We must not let the dnmoeratic process be overthrown by revo­lution and by military takeover."

Miami policeman found guilty of manslaughter 
MIAMI (APl -A Hispanic policeman was found guilty of manslaughter Thursday in the deaths of two black men, and black leaders praised the verdict as a just response to the shooting that set off three days of racial violence. 
Miami Officer William Lozano, 31, showed no emo­tion when he heard the ver­dict in the Jan. 16 deaths of motorcyclist Clement Lloyd, 23, and passenger Allan Blanchard, 24. The two counts carry a total maxi­mum sentence of 45 years. 
Circuit Judge Joseph Farina deferred adjudication on the jury's findings, an administrative formality to allow a pre-sentencing in­vestigation. He ordered ev­eryone involved to return to court Jan. 24. Lozano re­mained free on $10,000 bond and had to surrender his passport. 
The televised verdict by the six-member, multi-ethnic jury brought relief to an in· ner-city black community that feared the trial would spark another round of ra­cial unrest. 
"It just shows that our system works if people will give it a chance to work and that there are other ways of impacting the system than through violence," said Willie Sims, a black commu­nity leader who is a member of Dade County's community relations board. 
Miami has been racked by racial unrest four times this decade, including riots in 1980 and 1984 sparked by acquittals of police charged in the deaths of blacks.

Lithuania challenges Communism 
MOSCOW (AP) -The Com­munist Party suffered a major defeat in the Soviet Union on Thursday when the republic of Lithuania abolished the consti­tutional guarantee of Commu­nist supremacy and legalized a multiparty system. 
Similar action has been taken in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and East Germany as part of the wave of political upheaval and reform that is 
diminishing  the  role  of  the  
Communist Party  in those  na­ 
tions.  

Lithuania's parliament defied Moscow with a resounding 243­1 vote to end the party's total dominance of all political and social organizations within the Baltic republic. Another 98 deputies abstained or stayed away from the session. 
President Mikhail Gorbachev has resolutely opposed a multi­party system for the Soviet Union. The challenge to the Communist power structure comes at a time when he faces a crippled economy, growing nationalism and demands from conservative communists for more order. 
The move in Lithuania, one of 15 Soviet republics, thrilled other Soviet activists who are organizing a two-hour general strike Monday to call for simi­lar action by the national par­liament. 
"Wonderfully done!" said ac­tivist Yelena Bonner on hearing of the Lithuanian action. "You cannot restrain the movement today. This is a good example for the other republics," said Bonner, wife of Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov,

similar switch to a multiparty 
system until next week, to allow 
time for public discussion. Ar­
menia's parliament was forced 
into a postponement Wednes­
day for lack of a quorum. 

The Lithuanian action re­
scinds Article 6 of the repub­
lic's constitution, which says 
the. Communist Party of the So­
viet Union is the "leading and 
guiding force of Soviet society, 
the nucleus of its political sys­
tem, government and social or­
ganizations," according to 
Tass. 

In practice, it meant that 
Communists dominated every 
sphere of life and every organi­
zation in the country. Until 
Gorbachev's reforms began to 
loosen the iron custom, ambi­
tious Soviets were forced to 
join the party and follow its 
orders to rise in any profession. 
Similar articles are found in 
the national constitution of the 
Soviet Union and those of the 
other 14 republics. 

Word of the call for a general 
strike to demand a parliamen­
tary vote on the national ver­
sion of Article 6 began to per­
colate through Soviet society 
Thursday, after it was reported 
by Western radio stations. 

On Thursday, the newspaper 
Izvestia published the first mention of the strike call in a generally circulated Soviet pub­. lication. The article was highly critical of the strike call but nevertheless spread the word to the newspaper's 9.5 million 
readers nationwide. 

In Latvia, the People's Front 
is scheduled to meet with fac­
tory and labor leaders to re­
spond to the call for a general 
strike. 



Iraq claims it has test-fired two missiles 
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -Iraq 
claimed Thursday it has test­
fired two long-range missiles 
and successfully launched a 
rocket able to carry satellites 
into space, developments that 
could affect the Middle East's 
military balance. 

Hussein Kamel, minister of 
industry and military industri­
alization, said the three-stage 
rocket was launched Tuesday 
from the AI-Anbar space re­
search center 50 miles west of 
Baghdad. 

He also claimed in a state­
ment broadcast by state-run 
Baghdad Radio that Iraq has 
test-fired two surface-to-sur­
face missiles with a range of 
1,240 miles. 

That is enough to reach Cairo 
to the west, Athens and Istan­
bul to the northwest, all of Iran 
to the east, and the southern 
Soviet Union to the north. 

Iraq's other main foes, Israel 
and Syria, are already within 
range of missiles reported in 
Iraq's armory. 

If the Iraqi claims are true, 
the developments will heighten 
Soviet and U.S. fears of a new 
arms race in the Middle East. 

State Department spokesman 
Richard Boucher said he had 
heard reports Iraq had devel­
oped intercontinental ballistic 
missile but knew nothing about 
their validity. 

Kamel gave no details of the 
surface-to-surface missiles and 
did not say when the test-fir­
ings occurred. 

The heaviest missile the 
Iraqis are believed to have de­
veloped is the al-Hussain, with 
a range of about 560 miles. 

The U.S. Polaris nuclear mis­
sile weighs only 13 tons.

Supermarket visit conjures up profound ideas 
After sitting through a morning of truly dreadful classes. and perhaps, failing a t1~st or two. the last place I generally want to go to is one that is depressing. Unfortu­nately, when I sit down at lunch and open my copy of The Ob­server, th1~ depressing place usually comes to me. This domicile of gloom and doom is g1~nerally known as the View­point page-without a doubt the most depressing place on campus. 
The typical Viewpoint column is about as fun and cheery to read as a mor'tician's report. Day after day, oh-so-grim ha­rangues about the political af­fairs of faraway lands appear, in addition to the letters from people who feel compelled to vent their fury about the most trivial things. The same bloody topics get dredged up for an­other go-round every few months. 
Some peopiP, especially ivory­tower radicals. apparently think that whatever is printed lwre has some earth-shaking import. I, for one, do not. I write so that I can see my name in print. in big capital letters. 
Now, most of the stuff I've written for The Observer could only be described as stupid, inarw nonsense. This, like the KeerHlll Hevue (which gets bashed year in and year out for its alleged 'sexism·), has appar­Pntly gotten some local grinches upset.

'must' deal with, anrl I quote, "serious and weighty issues." Therefore, I suppose I should at least try to be sufficiently se­rious for a change. Since I just returned from Kroger's, I've decided to write a "serious and weighty" dissertation on vari­ous aspects of going to a su­permarket. 
I like supermarkets. It's a re­ally wonderful thing that you can but milk, cookies, really cheap SYH flowers and a per­sonal copy of the National En­quirer all under one roof. Just the very word 'supermarket' has a nice ring to it. 
The word 'Krogering', espe­cially if you roll your R (Krrrrrogering) off the tip of your tongue. the way the Prus­sians do, sounds even better. Due to the fact that I am con­ducting a highly "serious and weighty" discussion here, I looked into the etymological underpinnings of 'supermar­ket.' 
From the Latin, it may liter­ally be translated as "that which stands over Marcus', seemingly referring to a large roof or building of some sort." After much serious and weighty historical research I discovered that 'Marcus' refers to one Marcus Atlanticus et Pacificus, an ancient Homan trader with an especially large tent. (The A&P chain contends that this fellow is its founder, although I am a bit skeptical of this claim.) So much for etymology. 
As you enter a Kroger store, you are immediately awakened 

by a particularly annoying jin­
gle which repeats over and 
over; it goes something like 
"Let's go Kroger­
ing! .... la,la,la,la,la," (I forget 
the words. Forgive me.) I sup­
pose this is intended to conjure 
up your 'buying spirit,' to get 
you 'in the mood' as it were. 
In the past. I have heard 
rather ordinary announcements 
in supermarkets about sales, a 
Ia the proverbial "Attention K­
Mart Shoppers!" In addition, 
one occasionally hears some 
babbling about 'subliminal 
messages' in the elevator music 
that supermarkets play in the 
aisles, messages that somPhow 
'I like supermarkets. It's a wonderful thing that you can buy milk, cookies, really cheap SYR flowers and a personal copy of the National Enquirer all under one roof.' 
'suggest' what to buy. (However, since its usually Ger­aldo Rivera talking about these messages, I'm inclined to disbe­lieve it.) 
One thing is for sure, though, 
and it is that Kroger has taken 
the idea of the 'power of sug­
gestion' to its practical limit 
with something called, appro­
priately. KrogerRadio, complete 
with its own 'DJ.' "Hi, this is 
Joe Schmoe from KrogerRadio. 
You know, Krogerers, it's really 
nice that you're Krogering with 
us today at Kroger. And now a 
word from ... " What follows is 
an endless succession of every 
conceivable type of commercial, 
by and for "real people." 
First, there's a phony surf punk who says "Hey, dudes, I just got this new benzol perox­ide stuff, and its like EXCEL­LENT! I haven't had a zit for two days!" Then comes a guy with blocked up nasal passages saying "Oh, gosh, what a cold! I need AFRIN! It think it's over in aisle 10." Every 'message' is a roundabout way of saying 'buy 
this.' 
There is always an inordinate number of little ones in the store, usually pestering their mommies to buy Franken­Berry, Lucky Charms, or some other junky cereal. Mom says "That's junk." Tyke replies "But Mommmm. They're Magically Delicious! I heard it on TV! Oh, pretty pretty please, Mom. I'll be extra good." 
All it takes is a single 'pretty pretty please' and a chain reac­tion is set off all over the store. One by one, every devious tyke in the place takes this as their cue and starts pestering for some treat. (Believe me, I have a five year old sister, and she tells me all about the little ones' collective schemes. It isn't sheer coincidence.) Leave it, at this point, to the KrogerRadio guy to pipe in over the loudspeaker with "Don't leave the store to­day, moms, without buying a special treat for your little friends!" At this, several kiddies exchanged surreptitious grins. 
Something fishy was going on here, and I knew just the man to ask about it: Alex the Butcher. 
Alex the Kroger Butcher is the most interesting character on South Bend TV because he is the only character who ever has new episodes. The stations ap­parently haven't discovered that there are shows around other than age-old reruns of MASH and Cheers. I hurried to the butcher department to find this veritable monarch of meat-packing. 
"Where's Alex?" sayeth I to the man behind the counter. 
"Who?" 

"Alex. You know, the guy on TV." 
"Look kid, don't waste my time. I don't know the guy." 
So much for Alex. 

Whenever I go to Kroger, I always seem to run into eccen­tric domer friends whom I would rather avoid. These peo­ple must hide out in the library reading Upton Sinclair's 'The Jungle' and other sordid food­packing tales, wondering how they are going to ruin my ap­petite the next time I'm in Kroger's. I pick up a bottle of Hershey's Syrup, and I hear a voice behind me saying: 
"I wouldn't buy that if I were you. You know, it's very hard in a chocolate factory to tell the difference between a bug shell and a cocoa bean. That stuff is disgusting." 
You just can't shake these people. I pick up a package of hot-dogs: 
"Oh, man, if you only knew what went into those things, you'd stay a mile away from them." 
Needless to say, these are not 
fun people to run into in a su­
permarket. 

Anyway, that's about all I have to say in this dissertation. Ther·e's only so many 'serious' and 'weighty' things you can say about the topic, however profound it may be.

Dear Editor: 
On Oct. 8, 1989 over 600 people walked through South Bend in the city-wide CROP Walk. raising over $25,000 to help feed the hungry in our community and around the world. 
The Notre Dame student body contributed over $1000 to that total, the largest amount we have ever raised for the South Bend CROP Walk in the 6 years it has been in existence. Student government and the Center for Social Concerns express their sincere gratitude to all who walked or contributed. Your participation made this CHOP Walk one of the most meaning­ful community service projects we participate in. 
The CROP Walk is the annual project designated to raise money for the South Bend Food Bank, the Center for the Homeless, and other interna­tional relief organizations. By walking 10 kilometers through South Bend, participants earn the donations of their sponsors while increasing community awareness about the needs of the hungry. Almost every hall on the Notre Dame campus sponsored students walkers, contributing to this very suc­cessful project. 
Notre Dame's participation in the CROP Walk also sent a posi­tive message to the South Bend community. It shows that we are indeed concerned about the needs of the city and that we want to make a genuine con­tribution to solving its prob­lems. The committee which or­ganizes the CROP Walk for the entire city expressed their thanks to Notre Dame for car­ing about the hungry and join­ing together with the rest of South Bend in this very success­ful effort. 
Thanks again to all who par­ticipated in this year's CROP Walk and to all the hall com­munity service commissioners who helped to organize it. Your time and energy has made a no­ticeable difference.

Across the street from Ed's is a McDonalds, but not just any McDonalds-this particular branch of America's favorite fast food chain is lilled with paraphernalia from the 50s and 60s. 
Between the many depart­mont stores, malls, museums, and restaurants Chicago has to offnr in the Near North side alone, visitors should have no problems finding things to do in the Windy City. And if you can't cover all the territory you want to the first time around, you can always come back for more. 

Leona's: Italian food at its best 
JOHN BLASI accent editor 
I 
f you're looking for a great Italian restaurant that believes in 
abbondanza , 
plentiful portions, and you've worked up quite an appetite running between floors at Water Tower Place, then try one of Leona's restaurants in Chicago. 
Located in three different places in Chicago, Leona's features an extensive menu that includes everything from fried mozzarella and buffalo wings for appetizers to fresh swordfish, Rotini Primavera, hamburgers, and ribs for main course selections. 
The casual and friendly atmosphere we encountered at Leona's supported their "good food-good attitude" motto. Leona's varied menu and trendy atmosphere make it an overall success. 
One thing we noticed about Leona's was that you really get more than your money's worth for the entrees. In addition to the loaf of fresh bread with ri· cotta spread, dinners include soup, salad, and a dish of Leona's special cookies for dessert. 
We started our meal with an order of the Mozzarella ($3.95,)

Joker discover Bruce Wayne's true identity ("They were never in the room at the same time! I knew it!") and even simulate a BIFF! BAM! POW! slugfest, without really knowing what the next line was going to be. 
Other forms of improvisation require the audience to think up the first line and the last line of a conversation, and the group acts it out. This can be a lot harder than it sounds, espe­cially if there is an especially creative or demented audience. The group also performs a freeze skit, where actors can order other actors to "freeze," so they can take their place and completely change the topic. The possibilities are endless, and often very physical. 
From time to time the skits require a few minutes of prepa­ration backstage, and a come­dian is sent out on stage to for time. These lillers can be just as funny as the actual show-one actor expressed his views on school bands, while another one spontaneously re­cited an "Ode to a Chair." 

All in all, a Chicago night in the back alley of Second City is a night to remember, complete with music, special effects, and exotic fruity drinks. And even if you've invested in driftwood clocks, have been emotionally scarred from a "Love Connec­tion" date, or have voted for George Bush, odds are E.T.C. will make you laugh.

The scallops and fettucine were baked scallops served over fettucinc with a rich cream sauce, The scallops, fresh and large, were not as plentiful as expected, but were good nonetheless. The special on Fridays, the linguini and fresh clam sauce, was particularly noteworthy. The spaghettini, featuring home made pasta with Leona's special sauce. was also tasty. 
The rotini prima vera was a combination of large fresh vegetables served on top of rotini pasta and covered with a rich cream sauce. The only complaints we had with the rotini was that the vegetables were not cut in small enough chunks which made eating the dish rather challenging. 
In addition to the dishes we tried several other dishes sounded and looked tempting. Many of the main courses were also served as side dishes and appetizers for those with smaller appetites. Spaghettini, rotini, mostaccioli, and the fet­tuccine alfredo all were served as appetizers {$3.75). The antipasto salad ($5.95} sounded very tempting with Genoa salami, imported ham, and various cheeses. 
Leona's menu also featured some tempting sandwiches including burgers {$5.45,) Italian sausage ($5.45,) and steak sandwiches($8.95.) Every type of pizza imaginable including pan ($11 ,45 for an 18") and stuffed ($1 1.95) was available on the menu. Leona's also featured a wine list and several varieties of imported beer. We tried Leona's own brew which proved to be quite good. If diners ha:ve room for dessert, the homemade cannolis ($1.95) were great and the gourmet pecan brownie ($3.25) sounded tempting. 
Leona's has three locations. The two closest are one near Lincoln Park at 3215 N. Sheffield and the other near Loyola's lakeshore campus in Roger's Park at 6935 N. SheridaR Rd. All of the Leona's are large, but if you plan on making a weekend visit, then reservations would be a good idea. In any case, try one of them for a hearty homecooked Italian meal.

Ewing would rather see Knicks on top than see himself among greats 
(AI'J-I'atrick Ewing seems to rnalize that he's ready to be mentioned in the same breath with Magic Johnson and Mir.hael Jordan and Larry Bird. 
For four years, Ewing has politely rPplied to questions about his performances with lines like ''I'm just trying to help the New York Knieks win games" and "I just want to be the best player I can be." 
Now the 7-foot center who dominated college basketball in the early 1980s has a chance to be the NBA's first Most Valuable Player in the 1990s. 
And Ewing seems to know it. "Winning the MVP is a goal of mine," he says. "But winning a championship still comes first. But that's not just true of
-
me. Magic Johnson and Michael 
Jordan both would say the 
same thing." 
Ewing said he doesn't mind talking about an individual goal because he believes he can't win the MVP unless the Knicks con­tinue as a winning team in the Atlantic Division. 
''I'm playing well in part be­cause the team is playing well," lw said. 
Ewing has been a solid, but seldom spectacular. player in his first four years, averaging from 20.0 to 22.7 points and from 8-9 rebounds each sea­son. 
This year. he has been regu­larly spectacular, defeating any defense the opposition puts in front of him. lie trails only Jordan in the NBA scoring

race, averaging 29 points to Jordan's 32. 
"If he keeps playing like this, we're playing in June," team­mate Trent Tucker said, refer­ring to the NBA Finals.

Duquesne 
HAI.EIGII, N.C. lAP)-Chris Corchiani and Brian lloward scored six points apiece in a 22-0 first-half run that pow­ered 19th-ranked North Carolina State to a 126-77 vie­tory over Duquesne on Thursday night. 
Duquesne trailed 12-10 after a follow shot by Shawn Kelly before the 22-0 burst. which in­cluded four points apiece by Mickey llinnant and freshman Bryant Feggins, broke the game open. 
Hodney Monroe scored 22 points and Feggins had 20 as North Carolina State placed six players in double ligures. Tom Gugliotta added 18, Corchiani 15, lloward 13 and llinnant 10 for the Wolfpack (6-1 ), which won its fifth straight. Mark Stevenson led the Dukes ( 1-2) with 27. 
North Carolina State built a 54-22 lead on a layup by Gugliotta with 3:25 left in the first half and it was 60-31 at halftime. 
Brian Anselmino seored 12 points for Duquesne while Clayton Adams and Tony Petrarea each had 10.

"A machine, just a machine," Golden State rookie Sarunas Marciulionis said after Ewing had 44 points and 24 rebounds against the Warriors on Nov. 
29. "Never have I seen some­thing like that." 
"If there's any way to stop me, I'm not telling," Ewing said. 
Last season, as Ewing re­ceived increased defensive at­tention as his scoring ability improved. he usually responded to double-teams by passing the ball back outside. This year, Coach Stu Jackson said, Ewing is still passing in that situation, but he also has learned to spin quickly away from the pressure and hit baseline shots. 

"He's passing out much, much, much more than he has in the past, but his teammates have made the commitment to get him the ball more because they know they'll get it back if he's double-teamed and can't get a shot off," Jackson said. "But he's definitely getting the ball more and getting more shots. Our game plan is to get Patrick the ball. That's always our game plan. ALWAYS!" 
Consequently, his shots per game have increased from 15 to 20. 
''I'm trying to turn and move quick moves more, and if it's not there, I'll pass it out," Ewing said. "That's especially true in the fourth quarter when we're trying to make things happen and the pace. picks up for everyone. I have to try to defeat the double-teams in dif­ferent ways." · 
Philadelphia center Mike Gminski, who guarded Ewing for most of the game as he scored 32 points in New York's 11 0-1 03 victory on Tuesday, said he noticed the difference. 
"lie's on quite a roll," Gminski said. "He seems to be shooting that turnaround jumper on the baseline very well. That negates the double­team when he's able to do it so quickly. They're going to him a lot and he seems to be gaining confidence." 
Ewing has been especially ef­fective recently. On a four-game road trip, he averaged 35.3 points, 12.8 rebounds and made 64.6 percent of his 82 field-goal attempts. He was named the NBA Player of the Week last week and Player of the Month for November. 
But Ewing believes it's his re­bounding that has to improve in order for him to attract MVP attention. 
His 24 rebounds against the Warriors -no Golden State player had more than live ­were the most by a Knicks player since 1973 and helped push Ewing to 10 rebounds per game. His career best is 9.3 last season. 
With rebounding specialist Charles Oakley on the team, Ewing probably won't climb much higher than that. 
But he's improved other aspects of his game, increasing his free-throw percentage from 
72.8 for his career to 84 per­cent this season and moving up to second in the NBA in blocked shots with almost 3 1/2 per game. 
"You have to realize what he does to the opposition's offense when he's not out there," Jackson said. "People's eyes light up because the intimida­tion factor is not there." 
Ewing also has come a way in four years in his rela­tionship with the media, a con­sideration since it's a group that votes for MVP. He's

NFL to rule on 'bounty' charges against Ryan 
IHVING, Texas (AP) -NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, hoping to defuse a tense situa­tion between Dallas and Philadelphia, is expected to rule Friday on bounty charges by Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson 
against  the  Eagles'  Buddy  
Hyan.  
In the  most recent develop­ 

ment, Cowboys kicker Luis Zendejas and Eagles assistant coach AI Hoberts say they've retained lawyers over a tape recording Zendejas says he has of a conversation with Hoberts. 
On the tape. Zendejas says, Hoberts pleads with him not to tell the NFL he warned Zendejas about Eagles' at­tempts to knock him out of a Thanksgiving game between the teams. After the first meeting between, Johnson accused Hyan of offering a bounty to knock Zendejas and quarterback Troy Aikman from the game. 
"We expect to make a state­ment on the situation on Friday," Joe Browne, the league's director of communi­cations, said Thursday. A spokesman for the Cowboys said the team would have no comment because the league is handling the situation. 
The Eagles play the Cowboys on Sunday at Veterans Stadium. 
Zendejas, a former Eagle, said Wednesday that Eagles' punter John Teltschik tipped him about the bounty the night before the Thanksgiving game, which the Eagles won 27-0. 
After the game, Johnson said Ryan had offered a bounty to his players to knock Zendejas and Aikman out of the game.

Ryan called the charge ridicu­lous. 
Zendejas said he taped a phone conversation with 
Hoberts  two  days  after  the  
game.  .  
"When  I  talked  with  AI  

Hoberts on the phone, he said, 'Luis, I'm 47 years old, I still want to keep coaching in the league and this and that, and why don't you just say I told you that if you go down and make a tackle we're going to take you out, or something like that,"' Zendejas said. 
"I said, 'I can't say that."' 
Roberts on Wednesday denied he warned Zendejas of any bounties and said he will sue Zendejas if he plays the taped conversation. He confirmed, however, that he talked with Zendejas twice on the phone after the game. 
He said Zendejas asked him why the Eagles went after him. 
"He said, 'I was alerted the night before,' and I said, 'That's ... talk, we do that all the time, we always say we are going after you, we try to intimidate before, after and during the game that we're going to kick your butt. Luis is over-sensitive,'" Roberts said. 
"No one said we're going to knock out Luis and get $500 or $200," he said. "It makes me look bad. As long as he drags me through, they'll say, That's the guy involved in the Luis Zendejas deal.'" 
Zendejas declined to turn over the tape to the league. 
"But if the tape happens to get lost, and somebody happens to get it on a TV station, then it's out of my control," he said. 

LAS VEGAS (AP)-"No mas" turned out to have been the right answer after all. Too bad it took nine years to learn why. 
When Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran met the first time, in Montreal in June 1980, Leonard's wife, Juanita, was in tears by the third round and had passed out altogether by the eighth round of a relentless fight made all the more memo­rable by its malevolence. 
When Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran met the second time, in New Orleans in November 1980, it was Duran's backers who suffered, humili­ated by Leonard's cruel taunt­ing and flashy antics, but above all, by their hero's lack of a stomach for further combat and his brief concession speech. 
"No mas,'' Duran, who had 
never quit anything before, said 
with 16 seconds left in the 
eighth round of that one. "No 
mas." 


Z!ETO ~ T!HJ!E 
!HJ!Eill7{...())!NJ~ fLOW® ~fl 
Friday night:**1 O:OQ .. 1:00 
'~ 
And out of that mysterious beginning came Thursday night's convincing end. "No mas" indeed. They might have left well enough alone. 
Leonard threw 150 fewer punches-438 vs. 588-and landed almost three times as many -227 vs. 84. 
He smiled and danced, strut­ted and shuffled, and tantaliz­ingly bobbed his chin out like the Adam's apple of a nervous suitor. He faked winding bolo punches with his right hand and followed most with a stinging left lead. He wound up one time and actually delivered a looping uppercut. 
If he failed to hurt Duran ­again -he left him both frus­trated and bewildered -again. 
And if it is of any consolation to Juanita -the couple has since separated amicably -she could have been fast asleep, with few concerns, by the eighth round of this one. The only way Thursday night's pa­trons avoided a similar fate was by booing loudly and lustily, starting with the lack of contact at the start and finish­ing with the lack of drama at the finish. 
"I think this is the result of Hoberto Duran being 38 years old,'' Leonard, a relative youngster at 33, said almost apologetically. "He is a veteran, however, and he did come to fight." 
"The referee didn't let me do nothing," he complained. "Whenever we went into a clinch, he'd push me away. he wouldn't let me fight. I don't thnk Leonard beat me. As the rounds went by, I was hitting him. 
"I never felt like an old fighter. My arms were a little tight, but not old,'' Duran con­tinued. "Leonard didn't come to fight. He came to run."

Davis, Hernandez, O'Brien lead way in free agent moves 
NASIIVILLE. Tenn. (AP) ­Storm Davis. Pete O'Brien and Keith Ilernandez led another now of free agents to find new teams Thursday. and the San Diego Padres indicated their Cy Young Award winner might be next. 
One day after the official end of baseball's winter meetings, several teams were still hard at work. Kansas City lured Davis from Oakland, Cleveland signed Hernandez. Montreal got Oil Can Boyd and Detroit acquired I.loyd Moseby. bringing to 15 the number of free agents who changed elubs at the meetings. 
The Chicago Cubs sent Paul Kilgus to Toronto for Jose Nunez in the only trade of the day. DPals were down at these meetings, mostly because there is no longer a deadline to make 
them.  although  Tim  Leary.  
Lance  McCullers  and  others  
could move soon.  

Wlwre Mark. Davis winds up is still open to speculation. But tlwnJ was talk San Diego may not try to bring him back. 
"Tiw Padres told me that if I signed with them, they would not ro-sign Mark Davis," re­liever Craig Lefferts said. 
Lnfferts and the Padres agrned on a three-year, $5.35 million contract shortly bfJfore 4 a.m. EDT Thursday. Lefferts came to Nashville this week and, with agent Steve Comte, finished business with Padres manager and vice president Jack McKeon in the wee hours. 
"Jack McKeon reiterated to my agent that if the Padres got me, they would not try to re­sign Davis," Lefferts said. 
Whether that was a ploy to get Lefferts, only McKeon knows. But he insisted that Lefferts. who had a career-high 20 SliVfJS last season with San Frandsco, would be his stop­per. 
Davis rejected the Padres' latest otTer for a four-year con­tract worth about $12 million. 
lie is seeking a five-year pact 
:md the New York Yankees and 
Philadelphia apparently are 
willing to give it to him. 
The other Davis, Storm, made vut well. Kansas City's three­
year. $6 million offer induced 
him to leave Oakland and his 
shift may help the Royals catch 
the World Series winners in the 
American League West. 
Davis, 28 this month. was 19­
7 despite a 4.36 earned run av­
erage. lie is 92-62 in eight sea­
sons. 
"We believe we now have 
depth in our starting pitching 
that we have not had in a num­
ber of years." Hoyals manager 
John Wathan said. "We now 
have as much depth on our 
starting staff as any team in 
baseball." 
Davis became unhappy when his scheduled start in the World Series was scratched by Manager Tony La Hussa be­cause of the layoff caused by the narthquake. 
Davis joinnd Dave Parker and Tony Phillips as free agents to leave Oakland since the season ended, although the Athletics seer111~d close to re-signing Ken Phelps to fill Parker's role as designated hittnr. San Francisco, the National League champion, has also lost three free agents -Lefferts. Ken Oberkfell and Candy Maldonado. 
0' Brien. 31. left Cleveland for a four-year contract with Seattle worth about $7.4 mil­lion. He hit .259 with 12 homers and 55 HB!s in his only season with the Indians and told the team he would not be back. 
O'Brien, a lifetime .271 hitter in five seasons. is one of the best-fielding first basemen in baseball, although he lacks the power other plyers at the posi­tion can produce. 
"I would like to take this time to thank our new owner. Jeff Smulyan. for making our effort 
in the free-agent market possi­
ble," general manager Woody 
Woodward said. "This is truly 
the beginning of a new era for 
the Seattle Mariners." 
Hernandez. 36, signed a two­year contract with Cleveland for $:~ million guaranteed plus $1 million in incentives. lie is a five-time All-Star first baseman who has been hurt for two 
years, batting just .233 in 75 games last season. 
"We know he won't play as many games as he has in the past. but he can help us on the field and with his leadership," Indians manager John McNamara said. 
The Expos aren't sure what to expect from Boyd. Once on the verge of becoming one of baseball's better young pitch­ers. Boyd. 30. has worked sparingly tho past three sea­sons with Boston because of blood clots in his right shoul­der. 
Still. the Expos recently lost free-agent pitchers Mark Langston. Pascual Perez and Bryn Smith and need someone for their rotation. 
"Basically, it all depends on his physical condition. After a lot of discussion, we thought we'd take a chance on him bouncing back." Montreal gen­eral manager Dave Dombrowski said. 
Boyd agreed to a one-year contract for a guarantee of $350,000, with another $650,000 in incentives if he can stay healthy and be productive. 
Moseby, 30, and the Tigers agreed on a two-year contract. He hit .282 with 26 homers and 96 RB!s for Toronto in 1987. but has been in a two-year slump.

Snow takes home Lombardi Award 
NO's Zorich, USC's Ryan, Colorado's McGhee finalists 
HOUSTON (AP) -Michigan State linebacker Percy Snow earned his second honor of.the week when he was presented the Lombardi Award on Thursday night as the nation's top collegiate lineman. 
Snow, who holds the school record of 164 tackles in a sea­son, won the Butkus Award on Tuesday as the nation's top linebacker. 
Snow, 6-foot-3 and 240 pounds, beat out Colorado linebacker Kanavis McGhee {6­
5. 240) and two defensive line­men, Southern California tackle Tim Ryan (6-5, 260) and Notre Dame nose guard Chris Zorich (6-1' 268). 
The award is a memorial to Vince Lombardi. former coach of the Green Bay Packers and Washington Redskins, who died of cancer in 1970. The annual dinner benefits the American Cancer Society. 
''I'm kind of surprised I got this far," Snow said. "There were some really outstanding 

Percy Snow 
athletes selected for this honor." 
Snow has 464 career tackles, the second Spartan to record 400 stops. 
"I started out playing foot­ball just wanting to be success­ful," Snow said. "I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. I rec­ognized that I had some talent and I just tried to make the best of it." 
Snow has 163 tackles this season, one short of the school record he set last year. He also has three interceptions and two blocked field goals. 


Michigan will play Hawaii in the Aloha Bowl. 
Ryan recorded 19 sacks this season as Southern Cal won the Pacific-10 title and the right to face Michigan in the Rose Bowl. He had 96 tackles, three forced fumbles and one recovered fumble. 
Zorich was a key to an Irish defense that allowed 15 points a game en route to a 11-1 record and a meeting with McGhee and top-ranked Colorado in the Orange Bowl. 
McGhee teamed with fellow 
outside linebacker Alfred Williams in leading the Buffaloes to an 11-0 season. He has 199 career tackles and 10 career sacks. 
Snow and Ryan are seniors, McGhee and Zorich juniors. 
Ohio State linebacker Jim Stillwagon won the first Lombardi Award in 1970. Auburn's Tracy Rocker won last year. 

Andrew McCloskey 
Notre Dame nose guard Chris Zorich, who has recorded 92 total tackles and three-and-a-half sacks for the Irish, as well as USC's Tim Ryan and Colorado's Kanavis McGhee were beaten out by Michigan State linebacker Percy Snow for the Lombardi Award.

Tillmon helps Hoyas over 



N. Carolina 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -Mark Tillmon sco.red 27 points Thursday night to lead No. 3 Georgetown to a 93-81 victory over No. 17 North Carolina and end the inaugural Atlantic Coast Conference-Big East Challenge at 4-4. 
The Hoyas ( 4-0) had to win to get the Big East even after Virginia beat Villanova 73-65 in the first game of the double­header at the Meadowlands. 
The game was the third be­tween long-time friends and ri­val coaches John Thompson and Dean Smith and it was Thompson's first victory against Smith. It also was the first meeting since the Tar Heels beat Georgetown 63-62 in the 1982 NCAA championship game in New Orleans on Michael Jordan's jumper. 
Georgetown held a comfort­able lead throughout the sec­ond half and the Tar Heels (4­
3) never got clo.ser than five points in the final five minutes. 
Tillmon, who made 11 of 17 shots, nailed a 3-pointer to give the Hoyas a 6 7-5 7 lead with 
10:30 to play. North Carolina was able to stay within striking distance and got to 80-75 with 
2:46 left on a layup by George Lynch.

Irish swimmers prepare for Belles

By JANICE ARCHER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. who traditionally meet in the social or academic awnas, will face each other in a swim meet this Saturday. The women's swim team will take on the Belles of St. Mary's in the Holfs Aquatic Center at 2 p.m. 
The Irish are returning horne after a superb performance last weekend in the third annual National Catholic Championships in Fordham. New York. The team placed third in th(! 14-team field with 5H3 points, behind winner Villanova and second-place Boston College. 
"I'm very proud of our swimmers," Irish head coach Tim Welsh said. "This smnester's intense training was gean~d toward the national meet. 
Now, the team IS happy to be home. "It's a terrific opportu­nity to race once more before exams," Welsh said of Saturday's meet. "Everyone on the tnarn will be racing against St. Mary's.

year are staggering. The Irish have 69 goals compared to just ;{8 a year ago and 181 total points compared to only 98 last season. This year's Notre Dame squad averages 3.72 goals against. down over a goal from 
4.96 last year. 
The Irish have plenty of bal­ance and consistency in the scoring columns. As a team, Notre Dame has scored 23 goals in the first period, 22 in the second and 23 in the third. 
Nine individuals have tallied for specific events, one he calls "rotating away to win." This method allows him to move swimmers into events they are not normally chosen to swim. 

By doing this, the Irish hope to stay fresh and perform as well as they did in Fordham. Swimming in events they are not accustomed to will provide the women with a good oppor­tunity to have new perspectives. 
"It's a very good chance for them to swim different races," Welsh said. 
Saturday's meet will provide another important opportunity for the Irish, giving the team is a chance to be reunited before the semester's end. Because of the National Catholic Championships rules, only 19 women could travel to Fordham. The smaller group returns for a true team effort, one Welsh believes to be cru­cial. 

The meet against Saint Mary's will be a special one for junior Becky Wood and fresh­man Tanya Williams. They will be swimming in their primary events, Wood in the 200-yard breast stroke and Williams in the 400-yard medley relay. Both girls have the opportunity to qualify for the NC/\1\ Championships, to be held in March. 
"It's very unusual for anyone to qualify so early in the sea­son," Welsh said. "This gives us a jump on the competition, for we can prepare and train dur­ing the spring semester."
