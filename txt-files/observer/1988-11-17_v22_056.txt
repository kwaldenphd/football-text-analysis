Apple donates $1 /2M for Macs 
By MATT GALLAGHER Senior Staff Reporter 
Apple Computer, Inc. pre­sented a $450,000 grant to Notre Dame Wednesday for the pur­pose of placing Apple Macin­tosh computers in the offices of seventy percent of the Notre Dame faculty within three years. 
The grant was presented to University President Father Edward Malloy at a ceremony formally opening the new stu­dent computer laboratory in the basement of LaFortune Student Center. The grant was presented by James Buckley, vice president and general manager of central operations for Apple Computer, Inc. 
"What's being done here at Notre Dame, with the faculty work stations, the labs for the students ... I think that Notre Dame is at the leading edge of what's being done with com­puters in the United States," Buckley said. 
"We're really excited here about the opportunity we have to implement our $18 million computer plan, to provide accesss to computing of the highest quality to students and faculty, to staff and adminis­tration," Malloy said. 
Bill Keegan, regional manager of public relations for Apple, said Notre Dame and Apple have been working to­gether since 1984, when Notre Dame, along with several other

Airlines follow Continental, cut discount airfares 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-At least one major U.S. airline decided Wednesday to follow in part Continental Airlines' move to boost most discount fares used by the majority of vacation travelers. Several other large carriers considered whether to boost discount fares, too. 
Competitors of Continental, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., were expected to follow suit eventually. 
"I would be surprised if they didn't," said Helane Becker, an airline analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
Spokesmen for United Air­lines and Delta Air Lines said that the carriers were studying Continental's move and consid­ering whether to follow it. 
Northwest Airlines partially followed the action, changing around 30,000 MaxSaver fares between different cities, said Northwest spokesman Red Tyler in Eagan, Minn. The Con­tinental changes, he said, in­volve more than 100,000 such fares. 
"We continue to review the others," Tyler said. "There is still indecision in the industry.'' 
Estonian parliament declares sovereignty 
Associated Press 
TALLINN, U.S.S.R.-The Es­tonian parliament on Wednes­day declared the tiny Baltic republic "sovereign" with the right to veto Soviet laws. 
Before the vote, deputies from the Communist Party and government of Estonia held a debate in which they detailed the republic's need to control land, factories and laws, saying centralized control from Moscow had been ruinous for both the economy and envi­ronment. 
The vote on the "declaration of sovereignty" was 258-1, with five abstentions. It came after a vote on related amendments to the Estonian constitution that passed 254-7. 
The amendments include one declaring that Soviet laws will take effect in Estonia "upon their registration by the Presidium of the Supreme So­viet of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic in a way reg­ulated by it." That somewhat vague wording was apparently the result of a last-minute com­promise. 
The other four amendments add human and civil rights guarantees, claim the land and natural resources of the republic as the property of Es­tonia rather than of the "state," and guarantee the right to hold private property. be negotiated with Moscow to "determine the further status of Estonia in the composition of the Soviet Union." 
The passage of such measures by a government body is an unprecedented act of defiance toward central aut­horities in a country still feeling its way through Presi­dent Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of "glasnost" or open­ness. 
Houston-based Continental notified travel agents on Tues­day night and Wednesday that it would revamp its MaxSaver program to base fares on the length of a flight. Competition on individual routes, not mileage, had determined the fares in the past. 
Under the new formula, scheduled to take effect Nov. 23, MaxSaver fares for longer flights generally would be raised while those for shorter hauls would mostly be reduced. 
The changes appear to have the effect of raising roughly two-thirds of Continental's MaxSaver fares and cutting the remaining third or so. They fol­low by a few days plans in­itiated by Continental and matched by other major air­lines to drop another category of discount air fares-the "junk fares" available four to seven days before a flight that are used mainly by business travelers. 
Like Continental's, most of Northwest's fare changes were increases, Tyler said. Northwest so far has only matched Continental in the markets where the two airlines compete directly, he said; in other markets, Northwest will wait to see whether the other carriers follow Continental's lead. 
The hikes in both advance­purchase MaxSavers and last­minute junk fares reflect the recent trend toward higher air fares propelled by increasing passenger traffic. 
"Consumers definitely are paying higher prices," said Andrew Geller, an airline analyst at Provident National Bank in Philadelphia. 
Airline fares are up an average 8 percent from the same point in 1987, he noted. 


Malloy looks towards future in St. Edward's Hall Forum 
By NATASHA WILSON Senior Staff Reporter 
University President Ed­ward Malloy shared his thoughts and insights into the future of Notre Dame during last night's St. Ed­ward's Hall Forum. 
"One of the great chal­lenges we face is how to preserve the quality of teaching at the same time we enhance the infrastruc­ture of support for education in general," Malloy said. 
The university, he said, is encouraging professors to excel in teaching, research and publication and service and trying to recruit more quality professors. 
As recommended by the recent university task force on teaching, the administra­tion is trying to identify the departments which warrant an increase in professors, the president said. 
Over the last five years Notre Dame has added 100 faculty members to the overall faculty without in­creasing the size of the stu­dent body in an attempt to reduce the teaching load of faculty in certain depart­ments. The professors would thus have more opportunity for research, publication and sabbatical time, Malloy claimed. 
In an effort to diversify the faculty the university has tried to recruit more minorities and females, he added. 
Malloy cited the improve­ment of the computerization on campus as another priority of the administra­tion. 
"We have a $18 million plan of which will include computerizations, resources for the faculty, a significant improvement in the local capacity of the mainframe computer." 
"We've also tried to con­centrate on our resources in the library. We've had to build up, which is a very ex­pensive proposition, the periodicals and books in given areas," said the uni­versity president. "Anot­her area we are trying to work on is facilities and the laboratory space." The ad­dition to Nieuwland Science Hall, he contends, will sig­nificantly improve class­room lab space for the physics classes. 
"We hope to be able within two years to break ground for a new classroom facility (in the Green Field area) if

IN BRIEF 
U.S. bishops rejected a draft Vatican document Wednesday that questioned the authority of conferences such theNational Conference of Catholic Bishops. Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago said of the Vatican draft, "We think the document is so flawed that the Holy See should start over." Pope John Paul II has praised the American bishops on controversial efforts such as their national pastoral letters on nuclear weapons and treat­ment of the poor. But Vatican officials, noting the rising prominence of national bishops conferences, have declared that such organizations are not part of the Church's traditional hierarchy. The Vatican has asked all national bishops' conferences to respond to its draft docu­ment on their role in the Church and no final version is expected for months or even years. --The Observer

INSIDE COLUMN 

Darts: the ultimate game for the couch potato 

I fell in love the other day. Not with a person, not with a pet or a city or a place. I fell in love with the greatest game ever created: darts. 
It began one foggy, rainy night over Fall Break. A friend and I were v,isiting the University of Illinois, in Champaign. We dashed into a local watering hole to get out of the storm. As we passed by the gentleman at the door who welcomed us, we came upon the sight of that round piece of corkboard that would change our lives. We felt drawn toward it, as if it were a part of our destiny. 
Darts offers all of the thrills of a real sport. The competition can be intense, with the small, lethal projectiles flying through the air at tremendous speeds. The danger of injury is just as great as that involved in more glamorous sports, such as ski jumping and auto racing. Since the playing field is usually the back room of a bar, the danger of an innocent bystander wandering into the field of fire is great. The thrower must also contend with the very real possibility of a strained arm or a tired wrist. 
The skills of the players are amazing. A good "darter" has to contend with many outside influences which might potentially prove fatal to his game. Wind, humidity and a myriad of other natural factors all must be accounted for before the moment of release. 
Other, man-made hazzards also affect the throw. Primary among these is the alcoholic haze in which most dart players find themselves, but one must also account for the slippery floor of the bar, cigarette smoke stinging the eyes and popcorn kernels in your teeth throwing one's balance off that little bit which might make all the difference in the world. 
But don't let that scare you. Darts is the ultimate lazy-man's game. Think about it for a second. The only possible exertions involved are throwing a dart and putting down the beer which is most likely in your hand between throws. 
The only flaw in the game, and one which I believe must soon be rectified if I am to continue on my quest for the National Darts Championship, is the fact that someone must pull the darts out of the board. This unfortunate part of the game involves some poor soul, already exhausted from having thrown three darts, walking all the way over to the dart board (at least 8 feet away!) and performing the Herculean task of removing the darts from the board. 
Darts is by no means a simple game. Indeed, there are many complex varieties of the game, enough to satisfy the most discriminating of garners. The basic variation is plain, simple darts, with the individual players trying to score the most points. 
Matt Gallagher 
Assistant News Editor 

Other versions of the basic game include 301 (counting down from 301 to zero; you must reach zero exactly to win), baseball (different areas represent base hits, doubles, triples, homers, etc.), and a bunch of other games which are far too complicated for me to understand. 
The computer revolution has hit the game of darts full force, and I for one believe this is a change for the better. Electronic dart boards are springing up across the nation. These boards, replacing the common corkboard ones, have two tremendous advantages, both of which the couch potatos amongst us respect and appreciate. 
First, it is now possible to throw a dart and score points without the dart sticking into the dartboard (I guess there is some computer sensor which thinks the dart stuck). This not only allows one to score points on a weak throw, but also allows a much easier dart-retrieval process, as the darts which don't stick invariably wind up right in front of your feet after bouncing off the board. 
The second revolutionary bit of progress the electronic dart board has brought about involves the entire scorekeeping process. It is no longer necessary that a player be able to add and subtract in order to play. Indeed, I believe that the whole mathematical aspect of the game scared many people away. Now that this educational impediment has been removed, I anticipate a wave of dart-hysteria sweeping the nation.

Economic 'corrosion' feared despite shrinking trade deficit

WASHINGTON-The U.S. trade deficit narrowed by al­most 15 percent to $10.5 billion in September, the government said Wednesday, but not enough to prevent a new as­sault on the dollar over worries about what the head of the Federal Reserve called a "dan­gerous corrosion" of the Amer­ican economy.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan-Benazir Bhutto claimed vic­tory Thursday after election returns showed her populist party trouncing the opposition in Pakistan's first open elec­tions in more than a decade. 
With 103 of 205 districts reporting, the Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party had 52 seats in the National Assembly compared with 21 for its main rival, the right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance.

"The victory the PPP achieved is because of the self­less sacrifices, the struggle by people of the PPP," Ms. Bhutto said at a news conference after a rally of 8,000 people on the lawn of her family home in the southern city of Larkana. 
The crowd chanted "Long Live Benazir!" and "Benazir, prime minister!'' 
Former Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo, one of Bhutto's main rivals from the Islamic Alliance, conceded defeat late Wednesday in his bid for an assembly seat.

14.6 percent. 
But neither change was big enough to stem a new selling wave of dollars by traders worried about inflation from an overheating economy and skeptical of President-elect George Bush's promise to reduce the federal budget def­icit through a "flexible freeze" without any tax increases. 
The dollar, resuming its downward path of last week, fell about half a percent against the Japanese yen and 1 percent against the West German mark on Wednesday despite what currency traders said was in­tervention by the Fed to prop it up through massive pur­chases of dollars using yen. 
In the past month, the dollar has fallen nearly 9 percent in value against the yen and about 7 percent against the mark, halted only by a brief respite Monday when Bush and Trea­sury Secretary Nicholas Brady promised that the new admin­istration would not scrap a two­year effort to maintain its stability.

However, Bayh said he's not sure what action he could legally take. His lawyers are researching that, he said. 
The 100-member House is evenly divided between the two political parties for the first time in history. Both the Re­publican and Democratic caucuses have nominated their own candidates for speaker, the chamber's most powerful position. 
Bayh, in his role as secretary of state, will call the House into session for its organization day next Tuesday and preside over the election of the speaker. 
House Democratic leader Michael Phillips, D-Boonville, has predicted he will be elected. Rep. Paul Man­nweiler, the Indianapolis Re­publican who was the speaker in the last session, claims he has 50 solid votes in his caucus. 
Bayh said he has consulted with both leaders, urging them to reach an accord by organi­zation day. 
Mannweiler has suggested a power-sharing arrangement that would equally divide com­mittee chairmanships and give each party numerical equality on each committee.

SCOTT, Ark.-National Guardsmen helped keep order Wednesday after up to 10 tor­nadoes churned through Arkansas, killing six people, damaging scores of homes and businesses and temporarily knocking out power to 16,000 customers.

major universities, became a charter member of the Apple University Consortium. 
Keegan said that Apple donated a number of "seed" Macintosh systems to Notre Dame several years ago. 
"The idea of this program is to, within three years, put an Apple Macintosh onto the desks of 80 percent of the 700-member faculty," Keegan said. 
Keegan said the $450,000 grant represented equipment 
which  would  be  distributed  
over the  rest  of  this  school  
year.  

"At the end of this year we will look and evaluate what we need to do" to complete the pro­gram, Buckley said. "Maybe 
more faculty investment, maybe more student invest­ment" would be necessary on Apple's part to complete the program, Buckley said. 
"We're hoping we can cap­ture the minds and hearts of the student of Notre Dame with the Apple Macintosh comput­er," Buckley added. 
Buckley said Apple was working with the University to increase the availability of Macintosh computers to stu­
dents on campus.

Apple Computer is receiving no financial benefit from the grant, Buckley said. "We don't get any additional financial in­centive from donating these computers to a school versus giving them to a company," Buckley said. 
He added that, prior to the 1986 changes in the tax laws, Apple would have received a tax break from such a dona­tion. However, this is no longer the case. 
The other purpose of the cer­emony was the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Macin­tosh laboratory in the base­ment of LaFortune. Malloy of­ficially opened the laboratory, which has been open for stu­dent use since Fall Break.

The National Weather Ser­vice said the storms were caused by a cold front colliding with warm, moist air.

Daniels favored as successor to Quayle 

Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS--Mitch Daniels Jr., president of the Hudson Institute and a former aide to President Reagan and Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., is the leading candidate to fill Vice President-elect Dan Quayle's Senate seat, a report broadcast Wednesday said. 
WISH-TV quoted a source close to Gov. Robert Orr as saying that if Daniels wants the seat, he has the support neces­sary to get it. 
Orr, a Republican like Quayle and Lugar, intends to make the appointment before he leaves office at the end of the year and is replaced by Democrat Evan Bayh. Quayle, elected vice president as George Bush's running mate, has said he will resign the seat in time for Orr to fill the seat.

we get the resources for it." The new facility, Malloy said, would help alleviate some of the lack of class space. 
The university has already broken ground for Hesburgh Center for International Studies and will begin con­struction on a band practice facility and a new ROTC build­ing in the near future. 
Malloy also addressed the trends in the majors of stu­dents. 
The enrollment in the College of Arts and Letters, he said, has been increasing over the past few years because of the addi­tion of the Arts and Letters Pro­gram for Administrators and the computer science pro­grams. 
While the Colleges of Busi­ness and Engineering have had a stable population, the num­ber of students in the College of Science continues to decrease. The university wants to attract more students into science majors. 
"The biggest change that I foresee in academics separate from the component parts of the undergraduate education will be the concentration at the graduate level," Malloy said. 

The improvements in the graduate school, he said, will include a better quality of stu­dents and a more attractive at­mosphere in which graduate students can live and learn. 
"As we move forward the quality of the graduate school will enhance the reputation of the undergraduate program." 
At the requests of students at 
the  forum,  Malloy discussed  
the  timely  issue  of  student  
housing.  

"It has been the commitment of the university to provide housing all the undergraduate students who want to live on campus. We have had no lot­tery for the last 10 years or more and have no intention of having a lottery ·unless no one moves off campus," he assured his listeners. 
"The reaction to the percep­tion that people were going to be forced off campus shows that there is something positive about the dorm experience that people would like to preserve." 
The office of student residences i.s presently con­centrating on improving graduate housing, Malloy said. 
"We are exploring now ways to finance the construction of graduate housing (on-campus) as quickly as possible." 
The university will also con­tinue the renovation of under­graduate residence halls each summer, he added. 
Malloy also gave his impres­sions of the general character of the university and its stu­dents and how it might change in the future. 
''This is the Year of Cultural Diversity and I feel very good about what we've been able to do at diversifying the student body." The university presi­dent said he hopes next year's theme of the Year of the Fam­ily will be equally successful. 
The enrollment of under­graduate students will prob­ably remain around 7500 stu­dents, with an increased percentage of females, Malloy said.

Viewpoint
page 8 Thursday, November 17, 1988 
Graduate students enjoy their anonymity 
In recent months, graduate students have written Viewpoint articles under the auspices of the Graduate Student Union Information Office. The opinion of the GSU, as suggested by these ar­ticles, is that graduate students are treated poorly by the University, and that major changes in University policy toward grads are needed. Some have bemoaned grad student "apathy." Recently, the GSU suggested that grad students try to become more like un­dergrads. I am a member of the Grad Club Board, as well as a former mem­ber of the Graduate Student council of the GSU, and I would like to present an alternative view, in favor of the status quo. 
Francis Deck 
guest column 
The fact is, that we as grad students are not treated all that badly by the University. There can be no doubt that we are treated differently than under­grads. Of this we should be eternally grateful. But to say that we are "second-class citizens" and such is hog­wash. 
Currently, the relationship between the grad student body and the Univer­sity can be summarized as follows. First, the University leaves the grad students alone. Second, the grad stu­dents leave the University alone. My personal attitude is that what the Uni­versity does in its spare time is none of my business. In general, the best thing the University can do for us is to stay out of our hair and give us some peace and quiet so that we can get our work done. Mter all, the greatest gift the University can give a graduate stu­dent is his ticket out of here. Of course, to make our stay at Notre Dame a little more enjoyable, the University might provide us with some social diversions, but it does this quite well by providing space for the Grad Club. 
Some grads have called for more "representation" at the University. I'm not sure exactly what that means. I have found that in the matters which concern me the most as a grad student, my department represents me quite well. For instance, my department sets my stipend level, and provides my re­search and office space. It is also my department which is responsible for that huge hole which is being dug out­side of LaFortune, which, when filled 
Doonesbury 
in with bricks and mortar, will give my 
research group even more space. There 
is practically nothing that any student 
organization can do for me with ten 
years of resolutions and meetings that 
my advisor or my department can't do 
with a single phone call. 
Some of the grads I have spoken to 
have told me that some departments 
do not show such consideration for their 
grad students. Many of these students 
have come from positions of respect 
and authority in the "real world," and 
feel that their departments treat them 
like children. Such failure to show 
proper deference to the qualifications 
of one's colleagues and subordinates is 
highly unprofessional, and would not be 
tolerated in a corporate setting. Unfor­
tunately, there is probably little that 
the University can do to correct this 
problem, since it arises from the per­
sonal attitudes of individual faculty 
members. 

A major gripe I hear about the Uni­versity is that it does not provide enough housing to grad students. However, it is hard to support the view that the University "owes" us more housing. It is a different situation for the undergrads, where the University must act in loco parentis (like a crazy mother). Also, keeping as many under­grads on-campus as possible builds good community relations. But most grad students prefer to live off-campus, and our needs are quite well satisfied by the community, with whom we have a very good relationship. In any event, even if we do "deserve" more housing, all of our begging and pleading won't make the University build anything for us until it's good and ready to. 
Some grad students complain that we are not welcome at undergrad social activities. I have driven through the Northeast neighborhood on Friday nights, and the sight makes me ill. Frankly, most grad students want no part whatsoever in under grad social ac­tivities. Many grads are married and some have kids. What need have we for SYRs? As for "intellectual" activities, most of us spend fourteen hours a day doing intellectual activities, and the last thing we want is more of the same after a hard day at work. The Grad Club, with its purely social atmosphere, is just what the doctor ordered. 
The University, so I am told, has quite a strict set of rules of conduct. Formally, these rules apply to grad stu­dents. However, the University gra­ciously does not push these rules on us.

If we demand that the University treat us like under grads, they will. The result may be unbearable. As it stands, we are generally treated like staff or ad­junct faculty members. with a few ex­tra privileges, and a few privileges taken away. When we have minor gripes or problems, they are usually taken care of right away through our individual departments, or we take care of them ourselves. 
One should not get the impression that this is a minority viewpoint. The vast majority of grad students I have talked to agree with me on what I am saying here. Change is not always for the better. Perhaps our "apathy" is a good thing. It may be too late to turn back the clock, but I hope the Univer­sity's traditional "hands-off" policy towards its grad students will remain as long as I am here. As long as the University does as little as possible to impede my progress toward my doc­torate, I will be happy.

P.O. Box Q
I 

More dorms needed, not fewer students 
Dear Editor: 
The Viewpoint column "Dorm quota system: yet another mistake" of Nov. 14 stated that "the Office of Admissions has consistently underestimated the matriculation rate for several years, resulting in an overabundance of fresh­men." In truth, we have underes­timated the matriculation rate for the past four years by a factor of 0.0038 which has resulted in an extra seven freshmen per year. This represents some respectable estimating on our part when one considers that the actual matriculation rate has varied 0.06 during those years, and actually declined 0.02 after last year's winning football season, quite the opposite of the author's implication elsewhere in the essay. In any event, the extra seven freshmen have not caused the housing dilemma. 
Until more campus housing is built or the off-campus housing situation im­proves, there will be a need for a policy regarding the assignment of freshmen to residence halls and written procedures to solve the problems created if too few upperclassmen choose to move off-campus. I am hope­ful that students and rectors will work constructively with the Office of Stu­dent Residences to create the best pos­sible policies and procedures for main­taining the residential character of Notre Dame while facing the reality of the growing desire for campus housing.

Everyone invited to Senior Block Party 
Dear Editor: 
Arriving as freshmen in South Bend from various parts of the world, the four years ahead of us looked like a long stretch of time. Now as seniors of Notre Dame we realize that our stay here has actually been very short. We have had four years to make our impact on Notre Dame, but we must soon leave with its influence stamped upon us and pass our privileges onto another fresh­men class. As a result of the transience of our stay at Notre Dame, students rarely make an effort to become a part of the larger community which sur­rounds the student body. Yet the mem­bers of this larger community remain here to greet the next group of incoming freshmen and aid the seniors in reach­ing commencement. 
A group of seniors have been working to put together the Senior Block Party, an annual event on the Friday before the final home football game of the season. The purpose of this gathering is to bring together members of the South Bend community with Notre Dame students in a friendly, fun-filled event. Our goal is to enjoy entertain­ment, drinks, and ethnic foods together with the larger community of Notre Dame and South Bend. Everyone is in­vited out to this year's Block Party at the Joyce ACC on Nov. 18 from 3 to 6 
p.m. Hope to see you there. Chris Lee Kathleen Maglicic Senior Block Party

All-America team selected 
Top-ranked teams are well-represented in AP voting 
Associated Press 
Sean Elliott of Arizona, Stacey King of Oklahoma and Danny Ferry of Duke--three players who were instrumental in their team's Final Four ap­pearances last season--were the top vote-getters in The As­sociated Press' preseason All­America team announced Wed­nesday. 
Joining the three senior for­wards on the six-man team were sophomore guard Mark Macon of Temple, senior guard Sherman Douglas of Syracuse and junior forward J.R. Reid of North Carolina. Douglas and Reid tied for the final spot in the voting of the 65-member panel which selects the weekly Top Twenty. 
Elliott and Reid were All­Americans last season, while Ferry and Macon were chosen for the second team.

named on 56 ballots, two more than King and three more than Ferry. 
Macon was named on 30 bal­lots, while Douglas and Reid each appeared on 23. 
King is the leading returning scorer of the group, having averaged 22.3 last season while grabbing 8.5 rebounds and blocking 2.6 shots per game. The 6-10 King is considered the top center in college basketball and many feel King will be playing the season feeling he has to prove his being cut from the Olympic team was a mis­take. 
Elliott didn't make the Olym­pic team either despite his being considered a versatile player so necessary in that sit­uation. He, too, will be on a team hurt by graduation as El­liott and Anthony Cook are the only starters returning from the Wildcat team which held the No.1 spot for six weeks last season. Elliott averaged 19.6 points and 5.8 rebounds last all-freshman team last season and his 20.6 points and 5.7 rebounds per game were more than enough credentials. The 6­5 native of Saginaw, Mich. will have to take more of the bal­lhandling responsibilities this season following the gradua­tion of point guard Howard Evans. 
Reid is the only Olympian on the preseason All-America team. The 6-9, 250-pounder suf­fered a foot injury in Seoul and missed three games there. He broke a bone in his other foot during practice at North Carolina last month, under­went surgery and is not ex­pected to rejoin the Tar Heels until conference play begins after the first of the year. He ~ averaged 18 points and 8.9 rebounds last season while shooting 61 percent from the field. 
The 6-foot Douglas will once again be running the show for the Orangemen. He averaged

having Notre Dame acquire the 
benefits of a tough, conference­
type scheule while retaining in­
dependent status. 

"Since we're not in a confer­
ence, we figured we'd play the 
best schedule we can by 
playing two teams from every 
conference, which will be our 
conference--our 28 games," 
said the all-time winningest 
Notre Dame coach. "Then, that 
will condition us for what we're 
trying to do in March." 

The improved schedule has 
the players excited as well. 

"It was hard to keep your 
mental attitude high last year 
when we were on such different 
keels--in the weekend playing 
a Duke or Kentucky, then 
playing a weaker team on a 
Tuesday or Thursday," said 
Fredrick. "This year we have 
to be mentally in it each night. 
We can't go down the schedule 
and say, 'There's a win, there's 
a win,' we have to prove our­
selves every night." 

Second, the freshman class: 
led by 6-9 forward LaPhonso 
Ellis, the Notre Dame Class of 
1992 has been rated as one of 
the best in the nation. 

Flanner nips Pangborn in lnterhall soccer 
By CHRIS FILLIO 
Sports Writer 

The interhall soccer champi­onship has finally been nar­rowed down to the last game of the season, to be decided in tonight's season finale between Pangborn and Flanner. 
Tuesday night at Moose Krause Stadium, the upstart team from Flanner forced a final championship game by defeating Pangborn 1-0 in a rough and physical match. As the team from the loser's bracket, Flanner needed to win that game in order to force a one-game ali-or-nothing con­test for the interhall champion­ship. 
And that is exactly what they did. 
"I didn't think that we played very well," said Pangborn co­ach Derek Weldon. "Our of­fense wasn't there. We had one forward injured early in the game, and another one didn't arrive until later." 
Under warm but blustery conditions, the only goal in the game came midway through the first half. Going against the wind, a shot on goal by Flanner forward Garth Behrje got held up by the wind just enough to cause some indecision and con­fusion on the part of Pangborn's defense. The ball was deflected out front and promptly deposited in the net by Flanner midfielder Dave Neidell. 
Despite an overwhelming number of shots by Pangborn, they could not capitalize when it counted. Another stellar per­formance by Flanner goalie Tom Malone made the only e"oal of the e"ame a winner. ~ Pangborn~ will attempt to rebound and capture the title in tonight's game. The two teams will square off at 7:30p.m. at Moose Krause Stadium to decide this year's interhall soccer champions. 
"I think once these guys adapt to the concentration at this level as well as the con­cepts at this level, coming out of high school and going into college, we'll begin to make strides as a basketball team," said Phelps. 
Ellis, a first-team selection on the 1988 Parade All­American team, led East St. Louis (Ill.) Lincoln High School to the 1987 and 1988 Illinois state titles. He averaged 18.9 points, 18.8 rebounds and 7.3 blocked shots for Lincoln. 
"I think LaPhonso Ellis is everything we thought he was going to be," Phelps said. "I didn't want to put any pressure on him, I just want him to blend in. 
"He's got to stay out of foul trouble, know when to block shots and when not to, and he'll be an agressive player inside at both ends of the floor. He'll start, he'll play. Let's see how he does." 
Two high scorers from Texas add to the highly-touted fresh­man class. Point guard Elmer Bennett, Texas' Mr. Basketball in 1988, averaged 35.8 points and 6.2 rebounds for Houston Bellaire High School. Daimon Sweet, a 6-5 off-guard, was named the MVP in the Texas high school all-star game. 
Other freshmen include 6-2 Keith Adkins, a three-point shooter from Paintsville, Ky.; and Keith Tower, a 6-11 center from Coraopolis, Pa. 
Tower surprised Phelps with his surprising play on the front line, which includes Ellis and returning players Scott Pad­dock, a 6-9 junior, and Keith Robinson, Notre Dame's top re­turning scorer and rebounder. 
Robinson has just returned to practice following an ankle in­jury suffered early in the school year. 
"(Robinson) has got a lot of catching up to do," Phelps said. "He's picking up things in review as far as the system, so he's playing catch-up. I don't know how much of a factor he'll be at the early part of the season. 
"I think Tower is the surprise," Phelps said, "because I didn't think he'd do as well as he is doing. He picks up the concepts really well and he's a good player. He's going to help us a lot."

Irish to open against Mexico 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
It all starts tonight for the Notre Dame women's basket­ball team. 
The Irish take to the court in an exhibition matchup with the Mexican National Team tonight at the Joyce ACC to open the 1988-89 season. 
"We're anxious to see some new faces," said second-year head coach Muffet McGraw. "It's hard to tell right now how good we'll be and this will be a good test for us." 
McGraw is still juggling lineup options for the Irish who look to improve upon last season's 20-8 record. Senior co­captain Heidi Bunek will anchor the middle, sophomore sparkplug Karen Robinson will start at point guard, but beyond that nothing is settled heading into tonight's matchup. 
"We really haven't made any decisions yet on starters," said McGraw, "so tonight will be a good opportunity to look at people in game situations. 
"This team from Mexico isn't very tall, but they're fast. They've had a few injuries so they're only playing about eight people. But like most in­ternational teams, they'll move the ball well and get it up the court quickly. It should be an uptempo-type game." 
That suits Karen Robinson just fine. 
"We're supposed to be a run­ning team and this will be a good challenge for us," said Robinson. "It'll also be nice to play against someone other than ourselves like we do in practice and did Sunday in the Blue-Gold game. This will be a good test of our progress so far." 
The Irish are entering their first year as members of the nine-team Midwestern Col­legiate Conference, which in­cludes Dayton, Marquette and Loyola. In the pre-season coaches poll the Irish were picked to win the conference by all seven of the coaches who voted. 

Bunek, who averaged 17.9 points and 8.8 rebounds last season, was also picked as a pre-season conference first­team All-Star. The Irish also return Lisa Kuhns, a senior co­captain who is deadly from the perimeter and averaged nine points per outing last season. 
After meeting the Mexican team tonight the Irish will travel to Northwestern on No­vember 29 for their first regu­lar season game. Following the Virginia Tournament the next weekend, Notre Dame's first home game will be Dec. 7 against Marquette.

The 96-player field contains five of the top six recruits in the country from last year. Ty Tucker, Ohio St.'s No.1 player, won the National Indoor Cham­pionships (18 and under) in 1987. Another top incoming player is Todd Martin of Northwestern who captured the National Grass Court Championship in 1987. 
"The tournament has the top freshman in the country," said Bayliss. "It is as good a regional tournament as you can have." 
The open draw singles and doubles competition winners and runners-up will advance to the national Rolex competition. In the singles competition, 16 of the 96 players will be seeded by a selection committee. The 32 tandems in the doubles com­petition will not be seeded. In order to participate in the tournament each team can sub­mit up to six singles players and two doubles teams which are subject to a selection process. All of Notre Dame's six singles players and two doubles teams were approved. 
"I hope we make the strongest showing possible," said Bayliss. "Our top four players have demonstrated that they can do some damage." 
The Irish singles lineup has undergone some changes since the Tom Fallon-Notre Dame In­vitational. Mike Wallace, back from a rotator cuff injury, will play singles and doubles com­petition for the first time since mid-September. Paul Odland (7-3) has climbed to the No. 4 spot from No. 6. 
"Paul has had the best results week in and week out on the entire team," said the second year head coach. "The new position is based on his achievements. 
In the doubles competition, the number-one tandem of Dave DiLucia-Walter Dolhare (4-3) and the number-two duo of Mike Wallace-Dave Reiter (5-2) will compete for the Irish.

McGuire happy to be here 
Frosh center leaves Southeast, bolsters offensive line 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 

You wouldn't think the Deep South could ask Gene McGuire for any more favors. 
While playing at Mosley High School in Panama City, Fla., McGuire earned first-team All­America honors from Parade and USA Today. The Mosley Dolphins, a 1-9 team when he was in lOth grade, went a com­bined 17-3 during his final two years at the school. 
But when McGuire made his decision to attend Notre Dame, several people from around the Florida Panhandle did all they could to make him change his mind. 
"I got a lot of pressure to stay in the state to play football, and Alabama was really close, but my mom and dad wanted me to go to Notre Dame," said the freshman center. "This was the first place I visited, and after I came here I didn't want to go anyplace else. 
"Alabama respected my decision," McGuire continued. "I still got a lot of pressure from Florida and Auburn. They were kind of rude about it, but they weren't going to change my mind." 
Even after he committed to Notre Dame, rumors were rampant that McGuire eventu­ally would decide to stay closer to home. 
"About two weeks before sig­ning, somehow a rumor got started that I'd go to Ala­bama," said McGuire. "Both my best friends from high school were going to Alabama. I was recruited with both of them, and we took numerous trips to Alabama to see them play. People thought I'd go with my friends, but no, this place is worth it. 
"Even after I signed, there was a rumor I'd go to Alabama. I had to go on the news and report it was false." 
McGuire has demonstrated this fall just why so many schools were after his services. The 6-5, 265-pounder has taken advantage of a young offensive line to work his way to second on the depth chart as a center. 
McGuire himself was a little surprised at how early he received playing time. 
"I really didn't know what to expect; I came into frehshman camp, and that went pretty well," said McGuire. "Then, I 

saw the upperclassmen come in and it was like 'Geez, they're big boys.' Then we saw them run and lift weights and saw how fast and strong they were." 
A guard in high school, McGuire sampled three differ­ent positions during the pre­season drills. He started at quick guard, then moved to quick tackle behind Andy Heck, and finally arrived at center when Tim Ryan was moved to quick guard. 
"The center starts the whole offense functioning,'' said Irish offensive line coach Tony Yelovich. "He controls 10 other people, so he has a lot of re­sponsibility. 
"Gene is working and has been very conscientious in learning his rules and assign­ments," Yelovich continued. "It's always difficult for a freshman to adapt to every­thing that transpires on the of­fensive line. With the depth problems we have, he's stepped into a position where he can contribute." 
McGuire has not had too many difficulties making the adjustment of going from a high school All-American to a college second-team player. 
McGuire attributes much of his personal improvement heading into college to a couple of his high school coaches-­George Cochran, who became the head coach after the 1-9 dis­aster, and strength coach Bill Graff. 

"My lOth-grade year we ran a lot of sprints, and football was more conditioning than it was learning," said McGuire. "We'd run 60 sprints a day sometimes before and after practice. When the brand new coach came in, it was a com­plete turnaround. 
"I really wasn't very good in junior high at all. I was a late bloomer. I had been about 225 to 230 pounds, kind of tall and skinny. My strength coach, Bill Graff, really got me started with running and lifting weights and built me up." 
In fact, McGuire still psyches himself up for games by remembering the motto his team had in high school. 
"I try to envision myself making the great block, like it's fourth and goal on the one," he said. "The nose guard's going over me, and I'm just driving him backwards. That was our motto, 'Envision Greatness,' to

Football team loose, well-rested for Penn State 
The verdict is in on the near two-week layoff for the Notre Dame football team, and Irish coaches and players are smiling at the results. 
"It's definitely relaxed," senior tri-captain Mark Green said. "We feel good about ourselves and about what we're doing. The attitude is outstanding. Now it's just a matter of going out and doing it." 
Coach Lou Holtz gave the team a three-day pass last weekend. While the players were resting, Holtz and the coaching staff poured over game films to try to avoid last year's three-game slide that began with the Penn State game. 
The Irish returned to the practice field with zest Monday, practicing unusually long and hitting un­usually hard for the first day of the week. Holtz saw progress after the layoff, although he didn't expect substantial improvement. 
"We had some good crispness today," he said after the Monday practice. "We're too banged up to get a lot better.'' 
Holtz is 1-1 after open dates with the Irish. Last year, Pittsburgh downed the Irish 30-22 and Notre Dame defeated Navy 33-14 in 1986. In the 1980s, the Irish are 4-3 after an open date, including a 44-7 win over the Nittany Lions in 1984. 
Saturday's game will be the last in Notre Dame Stadium for the Irish seniors. 
During their four years, the seniors have com­piled a 19-4 ledger at home, including their current 11-game home winning streak. Penn State was the last team to defeat Notre Dame at home, 24-19 in 1986. The four home-field losses were by a total of 10 points. 
Greg Guffey 
Football Notebook 


"They raised me," Holtz said. 
Some thoughts on going through the tunnel one last time: 
Tri-captain Mark Green: "I remember the first day, the first game against Michigan State. You could look up and see the stands full, the glowing gold helmets and the band playing loudly. I'm glad about the situation. I can't think of a better way to go out." 
Tri-captain Andy Heck: "The four years have certainly gone by fast. It really hasn't hit home. I don't get real emotional about these things. I just want to be 10-0." 
Holtz says the Irish kicking game will be back at full strength against the Nittany Lions after a series of changes in the past few games. 
Reggie Ho will handle the field goals and extra points, Billy Hackett the kickoffs and Jim Sexton the punting chores. 
"We're back again," Holtz said of the kicking game. "We've got Hackett straight and Reg straight." 
Injuries shouldn't be a big problem for the Irish in Saturday's game. 
Offensive guard Tim Grunhard rested Thursday as did fullbacks Anthony Johnson and Braxston Banks. All three should be able to play against Penn State. Freshman tight end Derek Brown has been sidelined throughout the week with a case of the flu and freshman running back Rod Culver is nursing a sore shoulder.
