Senate tables budget proposal 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES Assistant News Editor 
The Financial Management Board presented its budget to the Senate for approval on Wednesday; however, the sen­ators opted to table the budget until the meeting for review. 
The issue questioned by sev­eral senators was the FMB's decision to pay off the $47,890 debt incurred by the Business Board and Carry Forward Fund. The Carry Forward Fund allocates funds for pro­gramming by organizations that surpassed their allotted budgets. 
"I am concerned that they are paying off the entire debt now with our money when it should be used for students next year," said Jason Creek, Knott Hall senator. 
Andrew Oxenreiter, student union treasurer, emphasized that the debt that has accumu­lated over the past years should be paid off now that the opportunity is present. Oxenreiter contributed this debt to the "messes that were left behind by past administra­tions." 
One of the reasons behind this year's student activity fee increase was to pay off the Student Union debt. According to Oxenreiter, the Student Union has been in debt the past five to six years due to the disorganization of previous budgets and the financial losses of such student

Ex-marshal to head Saint Mary's security 
By SARAH RYKOWSKI 
News Writer 
For another two weeks, Saint Mary's will have two directors of security. 
Michael Carrington joined the College's security force April 1 and will replace Richard Chlebek when the lat­ter retires April 19. 
"They're both here and working together," Keith Dennis, Saint Mary's vice pres­ident of finance and adminis­tration, said. "We thought it would be a good idea for them to overlap for three weeks. They worked together as young cops and have known each other for 30 years." 
Carrington, a former U.S. marshal during the Clinton administration, brings three decades of experience in law enforcement to the job. 
Carrington was appointed by then-President Clinton in 1994 and served as the U.S. marshal for Northern Indiana for eight years. He also served as direc­tor of campus security and parking operations at Indiana University South Bend for 15 years. Before coming to Saint Mary's, Dennis was the vice chancellor for business affairs at IUSB and as such, was Carrington's boss.

INSIDE COLUMN THIS WEEK ON CAMPUS 
Nuclear peace? 
With the ongoing violence in the Middle East, the ever-present threat of terrorist attack and the general uncertainty and fear of vio­lence in the world today, peace has never seemed more far off than it does today. Every day, it seems we are all del­uged with headlines of sui­cide bombings and more harsh and violent rhetoric being laid out by leaders around the world. 
The events of the last year or so have prompted much alarm among many. including the advancing of the famed doomsday clock, which measures the likeli­hood of nuclear war. The movement of the clock sev­eral weeks back to its clos­est position ever to mid­night, which represents nuclear war, represented a dramatic statement about the state of affairs the world is in right now. 
The greatest fear of most when it comes to war and terrorist attack involves the use of nuclear weapons. Only twice before in our his­tory have these weapons been used, by the U.S. in World War II, but those weapons that were used over a half a century ago pale in compari­son to the destructive force of the types of weapons that are in existence today. 
Contrary to what many may think, the presence of nuclear weapons in the world rep­resents a powerful deterrent of war. Any state with nuclear weapons realizes three basic facts. First, they are well aware of the destruc­tive capabilities of the weapons they possess. Second, they know how expensive. fragile and vulnerable the weapons can be, thus they will use high levels of security to protect their investments and prevent theft or accident. Finally, and most important, states realize that as long as there are other countries that have nuclear weapons and oppose the use of them against other countries, retaliation would be inevitable. 
Thus, no state with any desire to remain intact would ever dare use nuclear weapons against another because it would most certain­ly face total destruction in response to a nuclear attack. It is hard to imagine any sce­nario in which any nation would ever be able to launch nuclear weapons without facing an immediate retaliatory strike from another nuclear power that would feel threatened, thus they are rendered virtually unusable. 
Therefore. these very weapons that are such a source of fear for many actually have the opposite effect of discouraging conflicts. Although individual states are highly unlikely to ever use nuclear weapons themselves, they still remain fearful and uncertain as to how other states will behave. This fact serves as a force toward peace, because states are hesitant to partake in actions or policies that would potentially anger a nuclear power and lead to the escalation of a conflict to the nuclear level. The Cold War is the perfect example of this, in that each time nuclear war seemed inevitable, such as in the Cuban Missile Crisis. a diplomat­ic or otherwise solution was arrived at before the conflict escalated. 
Thus, a doomsday scenario such as in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, where a mil­itary overeager to use a nuclear weapon ends up bringing about doomsday, is highly unlikely given the nature of states in today's world.

Accused of receiving nearly $40,000 from Taiwan to fund his Harvard studies in exchange for negotiat­ing Taiwanese interests into a U.S.-Japan defense agreement, a former Harvard fellow on Tuesday denied knowing the ultimate source of the money that is at the heart of a growing scandal. 
According to recent press reports, Masahiro Akiyama, who had been affiliated with Harvard's Asia Center as a distinguished fellow, is allegedly part of an expanding international scandal involving diplomats from the U.S., Japan, South Africa. Nicaragua and Panama paid to advance the interests of Taiwan. 
Numerous reports allege that James Kelly, a top Bush administration official, was responsible for channeling money from Taiwan to Akiyama when he headed the Pacific Forum of Center for Strategic and international Studies.

Computer addiction problematic 
BOSTON 

The high-speed Internet lines found in nearly every dorm room and residence on campus can be a bless­ing for students whose computers are a central tool for communication and schoolwork. For other stu­dents, the computer becomes more than a tool. it becomes an addiction. 
Computer addiction interferes with sleep cycles, time devoted to homework and hurts relations with friends. according to Dr. Maressa Hecht Orzack. a Harvard University psychologist and founder of the Computer Addiction Services at McLean Hospital in Belmont. 
While most people use the computer to search for a particular article or to check e-mail, computer addicts use the computer to escape into a fantasy­world. according to Orzack. They have low self­esteem, and are looking for ways to lower their anxi­ety level.

SMC alcohol policy unaffected by ND 
By NATALIE BAILEY 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's alcohol policy is not going to change any­time soon, campus officials said. 
Despite recent revisions in the Notre Dame policy, Saint Mary's administrators believe that the current codes are effective and appropriate for the residence life that exists on campus. 
The policy, consistent with Indiana law, states that stu­dents under the age of 21 may not possess, consume, provide, manufacture or sell any quantity of alcohol on campus. Additionally, under­age students may not be pre­sent at any gathering where alcohol is present, whether they arc drinking or not. However. students of age may use alcohol in student rooms provided they use it responsibly and follow the guidelines outlined in the handbook. 
These guidelines prohibit drinking games and public intoxication among other things. 
J aillene Erickson, Holy Cross Hall director, said there's an important purpose for the rules. "Saint Mary's alcohol policy is for the pro­tection and the safety of the students." 
Junior Mary Brown said, "When I first came to Saint Mary's, I always compared our policies to Notre Dame, but now, as a resident advi­
sor, I agree with the policies. After dealing with vomit on the stairs and being in an authoritative position, I real­ize that [Residence Life) is looking out for the welfare of the students." 
Saint Mary's has experi­enced relatively few prob­lems with the policies in the past and does not foresee an increase in the near future, officials said. As far as docu­mentation of violations, there has been a minimal problem enforcing the alcohol policy this year. 
"There have been just as many documentations for other violations as there have been for the misuse of alco­hol," Erickson said. 
Brown agreed. 

"As far as I am concerned, violation of the policy has been a minimal problem this year," she said. "If you are 21, you should be able to have alcohol in your room if it is used appropriately. This works as long as it is enforced that you must be 
21." 
If documented for an alco­hol violation. a student may have a hearing or informa­tional meeting where a pre­ponderance of evidence will determine the violation and a sanction may be issued. This sanction ranges from an offi­cial letter of reprimand to a required leave of absence, depending on the severity of the violation.

Bishop and Foley outline term goals 
By PAM RONSD°N 
News Writer 
Libby Bishop and Trip Foley are making change,,s to student govern­ment designed to create new ways of programming and coordinating between existing clubs. 
Concerns have been raised as to what new things will be combined or created under the Bishop/Foley administration. New to their administration and "\\'ho Knew?" ads that currently run weekly in The Observer. 
'Tfhe ads] conununicate to stu­dents about services and things that already exist, but they might not know about them," Foley said. "For example, that students can cash a paycheck in the Dome building. and the existence of Greenfield's Cafe, located in the Hesburgh Center, across from the Morris Inn." 
Bishop and Foley worked to cre­ate an extensive Public Relations division under their administration. lt created in-depth focus groups. organized groups for students polls, wrote press releases and updated the three-year-old student government Web site. They also addressed the efficiency of the space currently used for The Maximum· Student Resource Center (fhe Maxx) in the lounge of La.Fortune. 
Both intend to work with already existing forces that serve the students on campus to better the students' lives. Bishop recently spoke with the head of the Student Services Committee Division about a possible "Flex 10" for tl1ose stu­dents who often do not eat the allotted 14 meals per week avail­able through the current "Flex 14" plan. Bishop and Foley also are looking to expand the routes of1.he Saint Mary's shuttle to include bus stops at Meijer, University Park Mall and downtown South Bend. 
The administration also appoint­ed two new programming liaisons. One will act as the liaison for Bishop and Foley by working close­ly with the Hall Presidents Council and the Student Union Board. The other liaison will work closely with all the student clubs on campus and with each of the Class Councils. Both liaisons will be expected to attend the weekly meetings of the groups they medi­ate. 
"The goal is to better student life in all areas and aspects on this campus, allowing for program­ming. collaboration and combina­tion among all student groups to ultimately bring the student body closer together," said Pat Hallahan, chiefofstaff for Bishop and Foley. 
In the midst of all of these changes, Joyce DeLeon, former Diversity Division co-chair for the 2001-02 year, is concerned about the future of her former division, she said. Though Bi'ihop and Poley do not intend to cut this division, they hope to combine it with other 
areas. 
The new grouping may be labeled the Cultural Division, potentially cutting some program­ming and leading to greater collab­oration with the Multicultural Student Programs and Services and other multicultural clubs on 
campus. 
'Tm worried because I know that the Diversity Chair laid its first foundations in the O'Donoghue/Norton administra­tion. and has been two years in the making of building it up steadily since then," DeLeon said. 
DcLeon worked to coordinate the Multicultural Fair where more than 400 people attended the event. The Diversity Division also sponsored the Educational Forum where lectures and panels were held addressing topics such as race, religion and sexual orienta­tion. 
"Witl10ut the support of Student Government, such high attendance would not have been possible," DeLeon said. Many more students attended these events because "they felt less like a targeted minority and more like a regular student all because the name of Student Government was behind

Colombian guerrillas free hostages: 
Rebels released 11 hostages Wednesday with a message demanding the Colombian govern­ment reject any U.S. assistance to protect a crucial oil pipeline. The National Liberation Army, or ELN. had kidnapped the 10 mayors, congressmen, dly officials and one Roman Catholic priest, all from Arauca state, last week. "It was a kidnapping as a way to pres­sure the national government," freed congress­man William Reyes told The Associated Press. 
Ebola outbreak pinned on gorilla: Contact with an infected gorilla triggered an ebola outbreak that killed a reported 53 peo­ple in Gabon, the World Health Organization said. Health workers traced the outbreak to a gorilla found in the remote north of the central African nation in the Ogooue-Ivindo province. The remains tested positive for the ebola virus at a lab in France. WHO said Tuesday.

Energy regulation ban rejected: 
The Senate on Wednesday rejected apropos­al, inspired by the Enron collapse, that would have required federal regulation of financial contracts used to speculate on energy prices. Working through provisions of the energy bill, senators also moved closer to an expected confrontation over drilling in an Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
Day of Silence promotes solidarity: 
Thousands of high school and college students around the nation vowed not to speak Wednesday to protest anti-gay bias in schools. The silence is meant to draw attention to the iso­lation that can drive gay students to higher rates of suicide and substance abuse. Some took a nine-hour vow. Others ate at silent lunch tables· during the protest, now in its seventh year. 
INDIANA NEWS BRIEFS 
Missing student case continues: 
Authorities investigating the disappearance of an Indiana University student on Wednesday sought a higher bond for a man jailed on unrelated charges, hoping to ques­tion him further about their case. Uriah Clouse, 26, of Monroe County, remained jailed Wednesday on $3,500 bond in Brown County on charges that include violating a restraining order, an Indianapolis television station reported.

The FMB believes that it is necessary to pay off the debt in order to have a fiscally sound Student Union. Hallahan, for­mer Sorin Senator and current chief of staff, stressed that the previous Senate's intent to keep the Carry-Forward Fund at constitutional level and to "move forward with paying off the debt." 
"I understand the importance of paying off the debt," said Kevin Connolly. "I was wonder­ing why we can't pay it off in two years because that would be an extra $24,000 for student organizations." 
Oxenreiter responded by say­ing, "Paying off the debt was not a choice we were given. We were told to pay it off this year." 
In response to the possibility of asking University Accounting to review paying the debt over two years, Oxenreiter said that this would not be feasible. He cited the recent student activity fee increase and that the debt has been around for too long. 
Some senators raised con­cern about the specific alloca­tions that the FMB made with its $318,377 budget. 
"I am concerned with the new rules are going to make programming more difficult," said Steve Holte, Hall President's Council senate liai­son. "With regard to HPC, it will be difficult to increase dorm unity and will force events off campus." 
HPC had requested $64,500 and received $45,000. Oxenreiter stated that the FMB wanted to allocate more funds, but the $1000 increase from last year was all that could be funds in the future. 
Student Union Board, which had been involved in a struggle with the CCC for funds, requested $370,614, approxi­mately $50,000 more than the FMB's budget. Citing that they paid hack the $24,000 debt the previous administration, Oxenreiter expressed that the FMB wanted to grant them flexibility. 
"We stand by it. We are pret­ty happy with it and it was the best we could do." said Oxenreiter.

WASHINGTON 

Taxpayers are cheating themselves out of nearly $1 billion in overpaid income taxes simply because they fail to claim itemized deduc­tions. 
"One of the big mistakes that people make is that all of a sudden they rush to get their tax returns finished and they aren't careful in organizing their records so they overlook things," said Toni Bardi, an enrolled agent, which is a tax profes­sional licensed by the Treasury to represent tax­payers before the IRS. 
"You should take a minute to think back through the year," she said. "Think about what you did that might be related to a deduc­tion." 
Thing people often are leaving out are mortgage interest and points, charita­ble contributions and state and local income taxes and property taxes, the congres­sional General Accounting Office found in a new report. Other itemized deductions are for medical expenses, job expenses, union dues and gambling losses. 
In 1998, as many as 2.2 million returns claimed a lower standard tax deduc­tion when they could have qualified for much more if they had only itemized. 
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, who requested the GAO report, said it serves as a warning to tax­payers who are scrambling to meet Monday's filing deadline in most of the country.

by tax professionals. 
The GAO, which serves as Congress' investigative arm, estimated that the average overpayment in 1998 from failure to itemize was $438. About a quarter of taxpay­ers overpaid by more than $500. 
Lower-and middle-income taxpayers were most likely to overlook itemized deduc­tions. An estimated 1.6 mil­lion of the returns were filed by people earning under $75,000 a year, with the median income for those returns about $47,000.

Using information from lending institutions and employers for a sample of 1998 returns, the GAO esti­mated that 948,000 returns failed to itemize deductions for mortgage loan interest and points.

Powell heads to the Mideast to resume peace talks 
Associated Press 
MADRID 

Secretary ofState Colin Powell said Wednesday he would push ahead with his peacekeeping mission in the Middle East despite Israel's objections to his meeting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. An Israeli military withdrawal from three West Bank towns drew support from the White House. 
"The withdrawal the president has called for is continuing. Now the Palestinian Authority and Arab nations have to do what the president called for," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said in Washington. The state­ment did not mention Arafat by name. 
"The burden isn't Israel's alone. All parties have responsi­bilities," Fleischer said on the eve of Powell's visit to Israel. 
The White House statement was a shift from the administra­tion's objections earlier Wednesday over Israel's slow­ness in meeting Bush's demands for a withdrawal. 
In his earlier remarks, Powell brushed aside Sharon's assertion that the secretary's planned meeting with Arafat this week­end would be "a tragic mistake." Powell said his mission was "not in the least in jeopardy." 
He said he hoped Sharon would help the meeting take place and ease restrictions on Arafat in Ramallah to help him communicate more readily with other Palestinian leaders. 
"He is the partner that Israel will have to deal with," Powell said after his peace mission was endorsed in Madrid by the European Union, the United Nations and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. 
America has pressured Israel to pull troops out of West Bank cities and end its 13-day offen­sive. Despite the newly announced withdrawals, Israeli troops still occupy the major population centers of Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin and Bethlehem. 
The crux of Powell's two-step plan is to try to arrange a cease­fire between Israel and the Palestinians and then steer them into negotiations that would cul­minate in a Palestinian state on land Israel now holds. 
Even if Powell gains a cease­fire, many in the region question how well it might hold if there are more Palestinian suicide attacks. As he trekked through the Middle East and then detoured to Spain, Powell made plain that his other objectives include renewing security coop­eration between Israel and the Palestinians, asking Saudi Arabia for assistance to rebuild Palestinian facilities and organiz­ing a worldwide relief effort for Palestinians. 
"We understand the difficult situation that Israel finds itself in, but we believe that the best way to relieve this tension. the best way to move forward and provide a solution to the crisis that we find ourselves in, is for the withdrawal of Israeli forces," Powell said at a news confer­ence. 
Powell is due in Israel late Thursday after a stop in Jordan to talk to King Abdullah II. He is to see Sharon in Jerusalem on Friday and hopes to see Arafat on Saturday. 
Sharon, on the other hand, feeling the continuing sting of Palestinian suicide attacks on Israelis, told reporters while touring an Israeli army base near the West Bank refugee camp of Jenin that he had informed Bush he could not pull troops back immediately. 
"Here we are in the middle of a battle," Sharon said. "If we leave, we will have to return. Once we finish. we are not going to stay here. But first we have to accomplish our mission." 
In Washington, White House spokesman Fleischer reiterated that he wants the Palestinian Authority and Arab nations to "publicly denounce terrorism, stop funding it, stop inciting vio-

Associated P rcss 
MANILA 

A ferry carrying more than 240 passengers caught fire in the central Philippines on Thursday, killing at least 15 peo­ple and injuring more than 70 others, officials said. 
At least 115 people were res­cued from the MV Carmela after the blaze broke out around 7 a.m., and search operations were under way. The coast guard said it was possible that other survivors had been picked up by private vessels as the acci­dent happened in a busy ship­ping lane and fishing area. Quezon Memorial Hospital in Lucena City reported it had received 70 people with various injuries and that more casualties had been taken to other medical facilities in the area. The ship, designed to carry about 326 pas­sengers plus vehicles, had left 
the island of Masbate 11 hours earlier and had been about an hour from its destination, Lucena City in Quezon province, 70 miles southeast of Manila. 
It was still smoking more than four hours later.

Bush presses Senate to ban cloning Supporters 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
President Bush pressed the Senate on Wednesday to ban cloning of human embryos for research, saying science must not rush ahead "without an ethical compass." Senators promised a fight, seeing great promise in cloning for cures of terrible afflic­tions. 
Bush called medical researchers. ethicists. lawmakers, ministers and disabled people to the White House to explain why he objects to human cloning and to embrace a. ba.n pro­posed by Sens. Sam Brownback and Mary Landrieu. 
"'We can pursue medical research with a clear sense of moral purpose, or we can travel without an ethical compass into a world we could live to regret," Bush said. "How we answer the question of human cloning will place us on one path or the other." 
"Llfe is a creation, not a commodi­
ty," he added. 
The president was looking to tamp 
down an evolving Senate compromise, 
crafted by Sens. Arlen Specter, 
Edward Kennedy. Tom Harkin and 
Dianne Feinstein that would outlaw 
cloning for reproductive purposes but 
allow it for research on illnesses such 
as cancer, Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's. 
"It would be a mistake for the U.S. 
Senate to allow any kind of human 
cloning to come out of that chamber," 
Bush said. Kennedy, said it is Bush 
who is mistaken. 
"We must not let the misplaced 
fears of today deny patients the cures 
of tomorrow," he said. "Congress was 
right to place medicine over ideology 
in the past, and we should do the 
same again as we confront the issue 
of cloning." 
Specter said the ban Bush advocates would criminalize legitimate research and cause "an enormous brain drain out of the United States to Europe." 
"To tie the hands of medical science in the 21st century, in my opinion, is just not the right thing to do," Specter said. "There's going to be a real fight on the Senate floor. I believe we will find enough Republican votes ... to make a majority." 
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, urged lawmakers to heed a call from 40 Nobel laureates who sup­port research cloning, and he said it is possible to bar ethically repugnant uses of cloned tissue without blocking the research. 
"The president wants to ban it all, and I think he's wrong," Daschle said. "And I think the American people are on our side on this issue." 
At issue is the production of embryos that are genetically identical to a donor human being. Bush voiced his opposition frequently last year, and in August he restricted federally financed stem cell research to 64 existing stem cell lines taken from embryos discarded by fertility clinics. 
The House passed a ban on all human cloning last July but the Senate has not acted on it. Many sen­ators object to the idea of cloning humans, but are not averse to embryo research that could cure disease. 
Brownback, told an anti-cloning rally on Capitol Hill Wednesday that the ban was "clearly a winnable issue." Standing before a stack of peti­tions with 400,000 signatures, he said, "Cloning is wrong, period. Creating human life to destroy it is wrong." 
But for many senators, the matter was more personal than political. Sen. Zell Miller, a moderate who has backed Bush on other high-stakes leg­islation, said he supports the Specter option because his son has juvenile diabetes and his late mother suffered from Alzheimer's. 
Sen. Bill Frist. said he supports the Brownback ban -an endorsement the White House viewed as key, because Frist is a heart-transplant surgeon whose views on medical top­ics are respected by his peers. 
"Does the promise of human cloning embryo experiments ... justify what is required today to conduct those experiments -and that is the pur­poseful creation of human embryos for experimentation and destruction? The answer to that question to me is no," Frist said. Bush called the prospects of successful research from clones "highly speculative," and said he fears nightmare scenarios in which embryos are created so they can be plundered for body parts, so that par­ents can have custom-ordered chil­dren, or so that women's eggs can be sold at high prices. He also said research had suggested that "designer cells" taken from cloned embryos might be rejected by human bodies. 
"Once cloned embryos were avail­able, implantation would take place," Bush said. "Even the tightest regula­tions and strict policing would not prevent or detect the birth of cloned babies." 
Michael West, president and CEO of Worcester, Mass.-based Advanced Cell Technology, disputed that point. His company announced in November that it had cloned a six-cell human embryo for the purpose of culling stem cells. 
'Tm not proud to be an American. when our leadership doesn't take the time to get the science right," West said. "You can't make science work just the way you want it to." 
defend Boston Cardinal 
Associated Press 
BOSTON 

Supporters, including an alleged abuse victim, came to the defense Wednesday of Cardinal Bernard Law as pressure mounted for his resig­nation over his handling of child sex cases involving priests. 
Law, head of the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston since 1984, has apologized for shifting defrocked priest John Geoghan, an accused pedophile, from parish to parish. Documents made public Monday show Law handled the case of another accused priest, the Rev. Paul Shanley, in much the same way. Ray Flynn, a former Boston mayor and ambassador to the Vatican, said that while Law's mistakes are indefensible, he should remain on the job to repair the damage suffered by the church. 
"He's the one that's most in pain," Flynn said. "He's the one who has the most to lose. He will put his heart and soul into it." Ralph Delvecchio, one of Geoghan's alleged victims, agreed that Law might be the best person fix the problems. provided there isn't evidence Law acted maliciously in shuttling priests between churches. 
"I don't really believe he intentionally meant to be devious," Delvecchio said. "I think he could do more good staying there because he knows what's going on." The cardinal has also earned loyalty for his years of work with the poor and immigrants. Law has made frequent visits to Latin America, including Cuba, to speak out against social injustice. 
"His resignation will not solve the problem," said Dr. Roger Jean-Charles, chairman of the board at the Haitian Multi-Service Center in Boston. "This is a case where the cure is worse than the disease."

OPEC won't replace Iraqi crude oil shortage 
Associated Press 
LONDON 

OPEC has no plans to pump more oil to replace the crude Iraq is withholding from the market, reasoning that the recent spike in oil prices will ease once violence between Israel and the Palestinians abates, the group's top official said Wednesday. 
OPEC Secretary-General Ali Rodriguez defended the deci­sion to keep output steady until at least late June by insisting that global supplies were "normal" in relation to the physical demand for crude. 
Oil prices seesawed on a day of conflicting market signals. Iran's oil minister reaffirmed that his country wouldn't join Iraq in suspending its crude exports unless other Muslim countries also do the same. 
However, the International Energy Agency warned that political uncertainties in the Middle East and labor strife in Venezuela could yet upset the market. 
May contracts of North Sea Brent crude rose 22 cents a barrel in London before slip­ping to $26.01, down 7 cents from Tuesday's close. In New York, contacts of light, sweet crude for May delivery rose 31 cents to close at $26.13 a bar­rel 
"Twenty-six dollar Brent isn't a terrible, terrible num­ber," said Peter Gignoux, head of the petroleum desk at Salomon Smith Barney. But he hastened to add: "It's not a great number." 
The big question, Gignoux said, is how quickly other oil producers can replace the crude that Iraq has kept away from markets. 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein suspended oil exports on Monday for 30 days or until Israel withdraws from the Palestinian territories. 
Iraq, which has a daily pro­duction capacity of 2.5 million barrels, exports at least 1.8 million barrels a day under the close supervision of the United Nations. 
Iraq is OPEC's third-largest producer but doesn't partici­pate in the group's production agreements. 
Iran and Libya had earlier expressed support for the idea of using an embargo as a means of pressuring the United States to lean on Israel to end its military offensive against the Palestinians. 
Libya has been quiet on the issue since Iraq began its boy­cott, but Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh insisted that Iran would not act on its own to suspend its crude ship­ments. Iran is OPEC's second­largest producer after Saudi Arabia. 
Zangeneh, speaking in Seoul, South Korea, said polit­ical tensions and speculation are driving the crude market and insisted there is no short­fall in global supplies. 
Rodriguez said that Iran and Libya both had assured him they wouldn't restrict output. 
OPEC will stick to its current production ceiling of 21.7 mil­lion barrels a day until June 26, when oil ministers from the group's 11 member coun­tries are to meet again, Rodriguez told reporters at OPEC's headquarters in Vienna, Austria. 
"Jf we increased production, we could suffer a collapse of prices after the solution of the dramatic problems we're see­ing in the Middle East," he said. 
·our hope is that the con­crete conflicts between the Palestinians and Israel can be resolved as soon as possible." 
The IEA seemed to support Rodriguez's view that supply and demand were basically in balance. 
The Paris-based group is the energy watchdog for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of rich oil-importing nations. 
The agency noted in its monthly oil report that crude inventories for the world's biggest consuming countries were still above average, and that oil producing nations had a combined spare production capacity of 6 million barrels a day -more than enough to cover the missing Iraqi bar­rels. 
In addition, IEA member countries have about 4 billion barrels in strategic reserves to tap in an emergency. 
Other barrels in the sea 
Analysts suggest that other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries, which pumps a third of all crude oil, will intervene to offset Iraq halting crude exports.

Still, the IEA noted that the market was tightening, due partly to the unexpected speed of the U.S. economic recovery and to diminishing 
U.S. inventories of gasoline and other refined products. 
High prices, if sustained over a long period, could impede a global recovery, the agency added. 
The price of Brent futures surged by 17. 3 percent during the 30 days ending March 25, while light, sweet U.S. crude jumped by 17.9 percent dur­ing the same period. 
OPEC members other than Iraq pumped an additional 440,000 barrels a day in March, for a total of 23 mil­lion daily barrels, the agency said. 
This meant OPEC's members were exceeding their official quotas by 1.3 million barrels a day. 
Gignoux noted that this trend in OPEC's unofficial out­put could help keep prices from rising too far. 
"In a funny old sort of way," he said, "OPEC is sort of solv­ing our problem."

Notre Dame's liturgical life is the best available 
They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and I daresay that it's true. I've never missed the dining hall the way I miss it here. (I've never missed the dining hall before, but that's immaterial.)

Here We Go
grateful for the times and places Again: Letters where my needs From Exile 
are filled by some­
one else. 

Far more than I miss the dining hall (and I really miss it), I miss the spiri­tual life of Notre Dame. Whether you love Notre Dame or not, you have to admit that the sort of religious life that exists at Notre Dame can be found nowhere else in the country. Maybe you could have gone to Stanford and received the same edu­cation, but the spiritual education available at Notre Dame is truly avail­able "nowhere else but Notre Dame." 
I always assumed that the spiritual life at Notre Dame was a result of the student body being 85 percent Catholic. I figured anywhere with that kind of concentration of one religion would be the home of a dynamic Church. My obviously oversimplified explanation of our spiritual life is per­haps a sort of tribute to the incredible people behind the scenes who make Notre Dame the wonderful spiritual home it is. They do it so well that I didn't even realize they were there until they weren't. 
When I applied to go abroad to Ireland, one of the major points I talked about in my essay was the fact that I was looking forward to an entire country of Catholics. I was cer­tain that there would be a dynamic Church in Ireland because of this high concentration, just as I thought the Church at Notre Dame was dynamic because of our high concentration of Catholics. 
It wasn't until just a couple of weeks before I left that an Ireland returnee informed me that the Church in Ireland was a lot of things but was definitely not dynamic. Nevertheless, I had high hopes and arrived prepared for a good spiritual experience in this heavily Catholic country. 
It hasn't happened. Most Sunday Masses don't have music, and they usually only last about 35 minutes. At the University Church, the priest reg­ularly omits the second reading on Sunday. The priest and the Irish con­gregation sound like they are in a race to get to the end of Mass fastest, and I think that their confirmation classes must include speed speaking. I have yet to venture to a weekday Mass, but I can only imagine the dis­mal scene they must present. 
I think I will probably spend the rest of my life searching for a Church like the Church at Notre Dame, a Church with the kind of involvement, life and spirituality that prevail throughout Notre Dame. Whenever I go home to my home parish. it is always both pleasant and a little disappointing. It's good to be among the familiar people who surrounded me growing up in the faith, but the lively liturgies and piercingly relevant homilies aren't there. It's good to go home, but I'm always glad to come back to the Notre Dame Mass. 
We often take the great spiritual life at Notre Dame for granted. But the fact is that Notre Dame is an incredi­bly special place, and for most. if not all, of us it is probably going to be the best church community we ever belong to. We have legions of priests and religious considering and catering to our every spiritual need. 
But out in the "real world." we're not going to get that kind of attention. We'll be sharing one priest with hun­dreds of other people and he won't always be able to meet our every spir­itual whim. Out there, we can't just be the passive recipients of the Church's bounty; we must become the ministers of her riches to others. 
A lot of us do serve the Church at Notre Dame. But we aren't asked to lead the Church, to anticipate the needs of others and to meet them. We will be asked to do this outside the Golden Bubble, and I think the first step to learning to do this is realizing how much work and dedication the men and women who do this for us put in. 
So next time you are at Mass singing the Gloria. think about how different it would be if you weren't singing those words of praise but were instead racing through them in a monotone as if there were a prize on the other end. The next time you think you have too much homework to go to Mass, remember that you won't always have the incredible liturgical experiences of Notre Dame available to you. And the next time you have a particularly meaningful spiritual experience at Notre Dame. take a moment to thank God for the people who make it happen.

Hospital's move hurts area poor 

The South Bend Tribune has report­ed that St. Joseph's Hospital is going to be moving from its current South Bend location to a location north-east of the city. closer to Granger. The Tribune reports a claim of concern on the part of the Catholic hospital for those people -many of whom are poor and of color ­who will have to travel greater dis­tance to reach the new location.

Chapin Street Clinic. 
One of the more interesting points ma.de by a hospital representative is that St. Joseph's did a study of the University Park Mall north-east of the city and found that people living in the south and west areas of South Bend could still get to the mall. 
Therefore, the reasoning goes, they can get to the new hospital. 
This reasoning is supposed to cover the concern for the poor and uphold the hospital's Catholic identity, but let's look at it more closely. Mark Twain once commented, "The problem with being poor is that it takes all of your time." Many who are poor in South Bend do not have cars. Given South Bend's inadequate public trans­portation, it takes an extended period of time for people to get from the poor­er neighborhoods in the south and west to the mall and other Grape Road destinations -Wal-mart and Meijer come to mind -where many of the available low-entry jobs exist. I have known more than one person who has lost a job to the vagaries of the · Transpo system. 
Here's the conundrum of the poor: to get to a job consistently first of all requires a car; to buy a car first of all requires a job that one can get to con­sistently. The conundrum intensifies given the fact that low pay often requires a person to take two jobs. The Grape Road enterprises can function because other populations -for instance, seniors who already have cars, spouses of people who already make a living wage and students ­provide much of the workforce. 
In other words, the attitude of the mall and other Grape Road businesses is to locate close to wealth and if the less well-off can get there, fine. Those who have the best access to trans­portation are the ones closest to the service; those who have the least access to transportation are the fur­thest away. There is no irony in this for the University Park Mall. Its aim is to be close to money. What St. Joseph's reasoning tells us is that its standards for concern for the poor are not much different from those of a shopping mall. 
Catholic social teaching's "option for the poor" tells us that justice requires that we look first to those who are marginalized. One of the contributions that Pope John Paul II has made to Catholic social teaching is to insist that poverty is more than economic. Those who are materially poor also have lim­ited access to the full array of social goods -for instance, education, job training and health care. 
Listening to and attending to the needs ofthe poor is not something that one sets up as a minimum test to pass -let alone a test modeled after stan­dards of a consumer center. Even sec­ular philosophical standards do better than that. John Rawls, the most influ­ential secular social philosopher, tells us that for any policy change to be just, it must be "to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged." This is Rawls' "difference principle," and it is part of an overall view he calls "justice as fair­ness." It is clear, then, that St. Joseph's move meets neither Catholic nor respected secular standards. In the pope's words, the dignity of the poor "is not acknowledged in any real way." 
Catholic social teaching does recog­nize the importance and necessity of institutions meeting financial obliga­tions. Here, moreover, is where we get into further interesting questions. Did St. Joseph's ask whether there was land available for building on the south and west sides? One recent big busi­ness did and will be locating significant part of its production there, both for business reasons and to create jobs for the many who are unemployed there. 
Why did a Catholic hospital not do the same thing? How earnestly did it pursue the matter, if at all? Did it consider, seriously or at all, the possi­bility that its mission calls it to be in the midst of those who are least well­off, and that following that mission can be the most fiscally responsible thing to do both for the hospital and for the city?

Bad premise gives 'Smoochy' the kiss of death 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS 
Scene Edi tor 

For anyone who ever secretly won­dered if Barney was actually a friend­less alcoholic or Elmo had to attend court-ordered anger management classes. "Death to Smoochy" may seem like a deviously pleasurable romp through the sordid version of chil­dren's entertainment. Unfortunately, director Danny DeVito fails to deliver anything more sinisterly pleasing than stealing two pieces of fruit from the dining hall: sounds like it's living on the edge until you realize that you now have two bruised apples. 
When Rainbow Randolf (played by Robin Williams), a psychologically dis­turbed children's show host, is busted in an FBI sting for taking bribes to put children on his show, the scandalized network bigwigs order their yes-man lackey. Stokes (played by Jon Stewart), and his sexually harassed partner, Nora (played by Catherine Kenner). to find a squeaky clean replacement. Enter Smoochy: a soy dog-eating, pur­ple dinosaur suit-wearing Good Samaritan who plays children's songs for free in a methadone clinic in the slums. Also known as the perfect suck­er for Stokes and Nora's manipulation. 
Of course. the children's television world isn't all fun and games -then again, neither is this movie. Between Rainbow Randolfs demented attempts at revenge (which include, among other things, an overly elaborate speaking engagement set up at a Nazi party rally) and clandestine advice

Frankly. the movie can't get over its initial premise, which its producers apparently think is hysterical. It's not. 
Williams' sad clown act is more than worn-out and so is his funny clown act. Norton puts in an adequate perfor­mance as an ultra-squeaky-clean over­grown Boy Scout, but the fact that his character is completely unchanging throughout the movie makes for an eye-glazing hour and a half. 
The strongest performances come from the Stewart and Kenner. Stewart's consummate smarmy jibing that he perfected from working on "The Daily Show" and receiving count­less schoolyard beatings in elementary school is nothing short of artful. And Kenner manages to balance sexy and abrasive well. The banter between the two, which is about as potty-mouthed as an episode of Southpark on methyl amphetamine. is razor sharp and live­ly. 
Luckily, DeVito is an excellent direc­tor and manages to save his all-star cast from utter embarrassment. With credentials like directing "The War of the Roses" and "Throw Momma From the Train" as well as being an execu­tive producer of "Pulp Fiction," DeVito squeezes a few laughs out of a movie that in other hands would have gone straight to video. 
DeVito has a keen eye for interesting cinematography and the movie is edit­ed well. But the half-witted premise of "Smoochy" is its kiss of death.

High thrills in 'High Crimes' 
By EMILY HOWALD 
Assistant Scene Editor 
"High Crimes" is yet another thrilling and attention-grasping flick by the wonderfully paired duo of Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman. These two have not been on the screen together since 1997's "Kiss the Girls," but their on­screen chemistry prevails again in this continuous quest for the truth and jus­tice.

Claire, the trusting wife, does everything in her power to save her husband. She is assured of her hus­band's innocence and teams up with a young military lawyer (played by Adam Scott) and a former alcoholic local attorney Charles Grimes (played by Morgan Freeman). The three join forces with Claire's sister, Jackie (played by Amanda Peet), who adds comic relief to the thriller. 
In fighting for Tom's innocence, the group uncovers the truth of what actu­ally happened in El Salvador. Not only are they faced with obstacles in finding the truth about Tom's case, the military also uses its power to deter Claire and Grimes from the case and into trouble. 
Judd does an excellent job of portray­ing the headstrong, confident lawyer, characteristics necessary for her to get to the end of the trial. However, she also possesses that gentle sweetness she usually portrays in her characters which grasps and tugs at the viewers' heartstrings who want her to find con­tentment in the end.

once again and 
make "High Crimes" a film worth seeing. 
There are numerous unique turns throughout the film but the storyline is common and predictable. There are some unexpected events that make the film better than the usual military law film, yet it doesn't completely distin­guish itself from that common formula of film. 
Director Carl Franklin does an excel­lent job of keeping the story moving and keeping the viewer in suspense. 
The film makes you want to question everything and Franklin keeps you wondering until the very end about the truth of what may have actually hap­pened. 
The 115-minute long film is well worth the money and the trip to the theater. It grasps the audience's atten­tion from the beginning and doesn't let go until the very end. Though it may not keep the audience guessing throughout the whole film, it will keep its attention. Although one does have to feel sorry for Judd on occasions, it isn't a heartthrob film. Rather, "High Crimes" is an interesting and entertain­ing movie that will satisfy audiences. 
Freeman and Judd successfully use a common plot with different angles to makes the storyline more enjoyable. The duo brings back to theaters a film that makes the audience wonder if everything you trust, everything you know, may be a lie.

Two TICKETS FOR "THE ROOKIE" 
'Rookie:' another touching baseball movie 
If living in South Bend hasn't eroded your belief in the eternal renewal of springtime. then perhaps a film about baseball still can. Time to root, root, root for the home team as Melissa Rauch (MR) and Paul Camarata 
(PC) make a double play on "The Rookie ... 
PC: Today's ques­tion is whether America keeps pro­ducing great base­ball stories or 

whether baseball Melissa Rauch keeps producing and great American Paul Camarata 
movies. Say what you want about that Scene Movie opening to "Patton," 
Critics 

but it ain't got noth­ing on a home plate umpire yelling, "Play ball." 
MR: But this really isn't an American story, Paul. We're dealing with Texans here. 
PC: Woah, woah, woah, little lady. You're getting dangerously close to break­ing rule numero uno: Don't mess with Texas. Our job here is to review a movie, not to mess with Texas. 
MR: Trust me, I would never do anything of the sort. I only mean that Texas is one state not suffering from any self-esteem problems. Texans are proud of their peo­ple and their stories, as is evident in the film "The Rookie," which recounts the tri­umph of a high school science teacher turned major league relief pitcher Jim Morris. In his early 20s, Morris had embarked on a pro baseball career when a shoulder injury curtailed his dream. Years later his arm only sees action when throw­ing batting practice for the high school team he coaches. When the team strug­gles, Morris attempts to inspire his players by making a fateful deal: If they win the district championship, he'll try out again for the majors. 
Though the film frequently seems far­fetched and schmaltzy, the "based on a true story" seal of authenticity lets the audience suspend its natural disbelief at the implausibility of what transpires. Of course, as "The Hurricane" and "A Beautiful Mind" have already taught us. Hollywood frequently takes liberties with the truth when illustrating such supposed real-life heroic tales. Nevertheless, "The Rookie" will still satisfy its audiences with an uplifting story about following dreams set against the backdrop of America's favorite pastime. 
PC: Without knocking what the film does accomplish, I will say that merely sticking to the basic components of every baseball movie ever made automatically provides fodder from the culture to please the mass­es. Normally I'm the cynic when it comes to a movie relying on its genre to generate success. particularly when the Bruce Willis action category can presuppose superhu­man cop skills from anyone who smokes cigarettes. In this case I can make an exception, since its baseball we're talking about and not wannabe heroes. 
MR: The issue, then, is where this base­ball movie stacks up in the diverse, histori­cal canon that includes both "Rookie of the Year" and "Field of Dreams." 
PC: Don't forget 'The Natural" or "The Sandlot." 

MR: Or "The Bad News Bears" or "Bull Durham." 
PC: Or "Little Big League" or "Major League." 
MR: Or "Major League 2" or "Major League 3: Back to the Minors, which went straight to video. 
PC: Or "The Scout" or "Eight Men Out." 
MR: Or "Angels In the Outfield" or "Damn Yankees." 
PC: Or "Mr. Baseball" or "Mr. Destiny." 
MR: Or "For the Love of the Game" or "For the love of God, Kevin Costner. please give it a rest." 
PC: "Ed." 

PC: What range, everything from the 1919 Black Sox scandal to Matt LeBlanc and a monkey. The common thread is, of course, overcoming adversity in that swell 
interface between reality and the magic of the national pastime. Mike Rich's script for "The Rookie" opened a bit slow for my taste, but all in the effort of forging a back­drop of frontier folklore to further underscore the American-ness of the story. Dennis Quaid picked up the slack. mostly because he's believable as both

a resilient everyman and a hopeful roman­tic. Torn by his jostled childhood. his own family and his hometown, Quaid finds a way to reconcile them all in the pursuit of his dreams. 
MR: Quaid, and that charming grin of his, definitely shines. Also convincing is Rachel Griffiths, who, though a native Australian. gives an understated and real­istic performance as Jimmy's patient Texan wife, Lorrie. The colorful cast of supportive townspeople, full of local charm, entertains as well. Shifting to the film's weaknesses, the strained relation­ship between Jim and his military father seemed underdeveloped and unnecessary. Viewers never know why Jim Morris Sr. is so unsupportive of his son's dreams or why Dad comes around in the end. The film has plenty of material to tell its tale without resorting to this distracting subplot that comes off as a shameless copycat of the "Field of Dreams" father-son bonding finale. These scenes look like Hollywood embellishments rather than real-life drama. 
PC: Of course Hollywood embellishes. reality, let alone what it does to make fic­tion implausible. I mean, you have seen the movie "John Q". There was plenty of opportunity for these filmmakers to bend the particulars of the Morris

rects his career at all is balanced nicely by the fact that he does it in the lowly Tampa Bay Devil Rays organization. If this film were a "movie" and not steeped in the real world, a. lot more sap would likely be dripping from the screen. 
MR: You want sap? What about the highly unlikely, extremely fortunate coinci­dence that the thirty-five year old gets his big-league break and that his very first game is against the Texas Rangers? This lucky break provides for a heartwarming conclusion to the narrative as Morris's family, students and the rest of the crew from Big Lake can drive to The Ballpark in Arlington to cheer for their hometown hero. 
PC: If his first game was in Texas. Mel, it was in Texas. To quote the punk band Bad Religion, "Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction." Occasionally there are people whose real lives become "SportsCenter" highlights or feature pieces in Time maga­zine. That's what this and so many other movies are about. Yes. "The Rookie" had its rough edges, my biggest complaint being that they couldn't find a way to work Randy Quaid into the gang of Texas yokels or bullpen hecklers at the Triple A Stadium. But then maybe we should applaud director John Lee Hancock for resisting the temptation to fabricate a sur­prise visit from some mythical "Cousin Eddie." My tolerance is admittedly higher because it's baseball, but I know this movie works, at least within its genre, because there were still plenty of moments when I got verklempt. 
MR: Don't get me wrong, aside from the father-son bit and a few too many music montages, I thought this was a very enjoy­able movie. While not reaching the ranks of "Field of Dreams" or "The Natural" in the pantheon of classic baseball movies, 'The Rookie" still holds it own -both as a rousing sports tale and a drama of the human spirit. And speaking of getting verklempt, a Devil Ray is neither a devil nor a ray: discuss. 
T'llhen it comes to real, real-life baseball, Paul and Mel's true loves are Al Leiter and defensive indifference, respectively. They also share an affinity for Lenny Dykstra and can be reached at pcamarat@nd.edu and mrauch@nd.edu.

This exchange is from "Why Dickey Seaman Sucks at Life," one of two plays in "A Night of One-Acts," a new production co-written and directed by senior Ryan Cunningham and junior Molly McShane. 
"Why Dickey Seaman Sucks at Life" follows a conversation between Dickey {played by freshman Paul Sifuentes) and his therapist (played by sophomore Ricky Herbst) who remi­nisce and try to discover the root of Dickey's problems. 
"The play questions what is normal by showing Dickey Seaman and his life as completely bizarre, completely offensive and completely absurd ... hopefully the audience will question what is normal in their own lives, as he does," Cunningham said. 
Despite the serious-sounding intent, the play by McShane and Cunningham is anything but serious. 
"Basically we just tried to make each other laugh," McShane said. In fact, comedy is just what one would expect from the pair. 
McShane, who got campus-wide attention last year following the for­mation of her Molly's Club, is also a member of the campus sketch comedy group The University of Notre Dame Humor Artists. Cunningham is well­known as the stand-up comedian from the 2002 Keenan Revue and for his comic strip "Befuddled and Bemused," which runs daily in The Observer. But fans of the comic should not necessarily expect the same thing in the play. 
''There's a lot less drawing in the show than there is in the comic," Cunningham said. 
"Why Dickey Seaman Sucks at Life" is the second play in a theatrical dou­bleheader sponsored by Morrissey Hall. 
Starting the night off is "The Common Room," a play written and directed by senior Joe Larson. Larson, who started writing the play during fall break of his freshman year, also stars as Mark, one of four freshman quadmates. The action takes place centerpiece is a tiny television and a Sega Genesis sporting the legendary game "NHL Hockey '94." Larson hopes the play will resonate with stu­dents who will find much of the con­versation and many of the situations familiar.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
.. 
Sox continue Tigers' skid 
Associated Press 
DETROIT 

The Detroit Tigers' losing streak stretched to eight -their worst start in a half-century -as Frank Thomas capped a five-run fifth inning with a three-run homer that led the Chicago White Sox to a 7 -5 win Wednesday. 
The Tigers, the major leagues' lone winless team, also started the 1952 season 0-8. Detroit has lost two games since Luis Pujols replaced Phil Garner as manager. 
Chicago won three of four to split an eight-game road trip. Thomas, who hit his 350th homer Tuesday. has hit three homers in three games. 
Antonio Osuna (1-0) gave up two hits in 1 2-3 innings. He stranded two baserunners when he entered the game with two outs and a 6-5 lead in the fifth. Four relievers fol­lowed, including Keith Foulke, who earned his save second save in three opportunities. 
White Sox starter Jon Garland gave _up five runs and 10 hits ­including three homers -in 4 1-3 innings. 
Jose Lima (0-2), who squandered a two-run lead, allowed up six runs on six hits in 4 2-3 innings, lowering his ERA from 18.00 to 13.50. 
Detroit stranded 13 runners, including nine in scoring position, and 13 total. With the bases loaded in the seventh, Craig Paquette hit an inning-ending groundout off Bobby Howry. 
Bobby Higginson's leadoff homer in the first gave the Tigers their sec­ond lead since the season opener. 
Jose Valentin's sacrifice fly tied the game in the second, but Detroit took a 3-1 lead Higginson on Higginson's RBI double in the bottom half and Dmitri Young's homer in the third, his first with the Tigers. 
Lima then gave up five runs on four hits and a walk in the fifth. Royce Clayton's RBI triple and Kenny Lofton's RBI preceded Thomas'homer. 
Rockies 4, Astros 1 
Todd Zeile homered for the third straight game, and Shawn Chacon allowed one earned run in 6 1-3 innings to lead the Colorado Rockies over the Houston Astros. 
Chacon (1-1) gave up five hits, struck out five and hit two batters. He had lost six straight decisions since defeating San Francisco last July 24. 
Zeile hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning, his third of the season. He was 2-for-4. 
Larry Walker had two hits, includ­ing his third homer of the season, and drove in two runs. 
Dave Mlicki (0-2), starting against Colorado for "the .first time since June 19, 1998, allowed two earned runs and eight hits in six innings. 
Chacon had much better control than he did in a 9-0 loss to Los Angeles on Friday, when he allowed eight runs and walked five in 3 2-3 innings. He didn't allow a runner past second base Wednesday until Richard Hidalgo led off the seventh inning with a homer to left-center. 
Hidalgo's second homer of the sea­son pulled the Astros to 2-1. 
Chacon left in the seventh with one out and runners on first and second, but Kent Mercker got a forceout at second and Craig Biggio hit an inning-ending lineout off Todd Jones. 
Jose Jimenez pitched the ninth for his third save. 
Mets 3, Cubs 2 
Roberto Alomar homered for the first time with the Mets and Mike Piazza followed with a home run of his own to give New York a victory over the Chicago Cubs. 
The back-to-back homers in the 
eighth inning spoiled a solid outing by Kerry Wood, who struck out 10 and scattered four hits over seven innings. Chicago was trying to win consecutive games for the first time this season. 
With the Cubs leading 2-1, Jeff Fassero (0-2) relieved Wood to start the eighth and got two quick outs. But Aiomar, who had been 1-of-18 against lefties, put the first pitch he saw into the right-field bleachers. It was the first NL homer since Sept. 17, 1990, for Alomar, acquired by the Mets from Cleveland in December. 
Piazza, who struck out in his first three at-bats, had an opposite-field homer to right on a 3-1 pitch. Fassero finally got Edgardo Alfonzo on a popup to end the inning, and was booed as he left the field. 
Todd Hundley drove in a run with a pinch-hit sacrifice fly in the sev­enth. 
David Weathers (2-0) allowed one hit in 1 2-3 innings. Armando Benitez pitched the ninth for his first save, striking out one and allowing a double to Alex Gonzalez. 
Benitez made things interesting. Trying to hold Gonzalez on base, he overthrew s~ond and Gonzalez took third as the ball rolled into center field. Pinch-hitter Delino DeShields followed with a game-ending flyout. 
With the wind blowing in at Wrigley Field, it was a pitcher's duel early. 
Wood gave up only one hit after the third inning, and Shawn Estes allowed only one all day. 
But both pitchers ran into trouble in the seventh. Alfonzo got the Mets going with a leadoff, full-count walk, and Jeromy Burnitz followed with a single. 
Mark Johnson sacrificed to put both runn.ers into scoring position, and Alfonzo scored on Rey Ordonez's sacrifice fly. 
Dispute moves to next phase 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE 

After 20 days of testimony over four months 
from nine witnesses. the hearing phase of the 
grievance by baseball players to block contrac­
tion likely came to an end Wednesday. 
Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, 
completed his testimony Wednesday and was fol­
lowed by Bob Starkey, an accounting consultant 
who has worked for the commissioner's office 
and the Minnesota Twins. 
Tom Ostertag, baseball's general counsel, was 
recalled to the witness chair by the union and 
answered additional questions. 
The sides and arbitrator Shyam Das are work­
ing on an agreement that would allow the rest of 
the case to proceed without additional witnesses, 
union lawyer Michael Weiner said. The sides 
hope by next week they will have an agreement 
on a schedule to complete the case. 
Owners voted Nov. 6 to eliminate two teams 
for the 2002 season and the players filed a griev­
ance the following day, hours before their labor 
contract expired, claiming the decision violated 
the deal. 

While management's attempt to fold the 
Minnesota Twins and Montreal Expos was 
stopped by a Minnesota injunction, the union is 
continuing with its grievance. Das will decided 
whether owners have the right to eliminate 
teams, or if they must have the union's agree­
ment. 

Owners say they must merely bargain over the 
effects of contraction, such as a dispersal draft of 
players. If Das rules for the union, the grievance 
would continue to a damage phase and owners 
would have to deal with contraction in collective 
bargaining. 

Talks for a new labor contract, which recessed 
March 13, are likely to resume Tuesday.

INDIANAPOLIS 
Kentucky State was placed on two years' probation by the NCAA on Wednesday for eligi­bility and recruiting violations in four sports, including men's basketball. 

~ 
The NCAA investigation found that basketball coach Winston Bennett, before offi­cially employed by the univer­sity, recruited a player, and that another player competed with the basketball team before fulfilling one academic vear in residence. ' In 1998, former cross coun­try and track and field coach Marcus Henderson entered an ineligible female runner under another athlete's name in two events at the Samford University Invitational meet. 
The NCAA also said several men's and women's track and field and cross country ath­letes participated in team practices while not enrolled full-time, and some practiced and competed before receiving a certification of eligibility. Another track and field athlete competed after his eligibility was exhausted. 
Another violation involved a never submitted eligibility papers to the NCAA. He prac­ticed and played in 37 games in spring 2000. 

None of the athletes was identified in the report by the NCAA Infractions Committee. 
In addition to two years pro­bation, which began Wednesday, Kentucky State will be limited in the 2002-03 academic year to one contact with each basketball recruit and two tryout dates for stu­dents already enrolled. 
Also, each year during pro­bation. university officials must attend an NCAA compli­ance seminar. The school was not required to forfeit athletic scholarships. 
Kentucky State athletic director Derrick Ramsey said he expected one year proba­tion, but not two, which he described a~ "harsh." He noted that the major violations, which involved track and cross country. occurred before he joined the university in July 1999. 
The other violations. all sec­ondary offenses, were self­reported by the university, Ramsey said in a telephone interview from Frankfort, Ky.

MASTERS 
Course size cuts down on fun 
Associated Press 
AUGUSTA, Ga. 

The hype over the Masters is no longer about the possibility of a grand slam. 
This time, it's the punishment expected from a grand course. 
Augusta National has under­gone many changes since Tiger Woods left last April after com­pleting his unprecedented sweep of the four biggest tour­naments in golf. 
Starting Thursday, Woods

"It's just not as much fun as it used to be to come here and play," Bob Estes said. "You'll still have great champions, but you won't have as many oppor­tunities to make birdies and eagles." 
Chris DiMarco, the 36-hole leader last year in his Masters debut, added: "If we don't have any rain, it's going to be brutal. A couple under (par) could win the tournament." 
The final swing from Woods last year was a 75-yard lob wedge from the 18th fairway. He made birdie from 15 feet for a 16-under 272, the fourth-best score in Masters history and two strokes shy of his record 270 when he won his first green jacket in 1997. 
Now? 
Woods expects to have any­thing from a 5-iron to a 7 -iron for his second shot in the 18th. He didn't even have that much club for his second shot on some of the par 5s. Johnson when he announced

adjacent week of 
Augusta Country Club for a new tee on the par-5 13th. David Duval used to reach that green with a 5-iron. Now, he has put a 7-wood in his bag, which goes about 235 yards. 
What does it all mean? 
The player with the lowest score will slip into a green jack­et at the end of the Masters, of course. What remains to be seen is what kind of score it will take. 
"I don't know what kind of number you put on the increased difficulty of the golf course," Duval said. "I think you'll see a lot of 70s each day, 71s, scores that are more reflective of the other majors." 
The scores were never a source of irritation for Augusta National chairman Hootie putting. 
"It puts a huge premium on driving the ball," said Woods, a heavy favorite to join Jack Nicklaus (1965-66) and Nick Faldo (1989-90) as the only repeat Masters champions. "And no matter who wins this tourna­ment, their short game is going to be tested." 
Still, renovated Augusta National figures to be an advan­tage for big hitters. 
"Any time anybody hits the ball farther than another per­son and can do things to a golf course that somebody else can't do, they're going to have an advantage," Nicklaus said. "Power is a very big issue on his golf course." 
That's why Nicklaus, a six­time Masters champion who is

not playing this year because of a bad back, was pleased with the changes. But simply adding 
285 yards and stretching half of the holes produces another set of dynamics. "It does eliminate part of the field," Nicklaus said, referring to the short hitters. 
Not everyone agrees, and that's one of the many develop­ments that will unfold over the next four days. 
"For many years, the guys here could just hit it as hard as they can and had a huge advan­tage around this golf course, mainly because the difference between a 7-iron and a pitching wedge is dramatic," Greg Norman said. 
"Now, the long hitters are hit­ting 8-irons, and the shorter hitters are hitting 6-irons, and that's not that big of a differ­ence." 
Norman faces what might be his last chance to ½'in the major he covets the most. At 47. he was given a rare foreign invita­tion and might have to earn his way back to Augusta National next year. 
For Phil Mickelson, it's his next chance to win his first major championship, the only thing missing from his remark­able record of 20 PGA Tour vic­tories in his 10-year career. 
Duval has been in contention on the back nine Sunday at Augusta each of the last four years, has never shot worse than 70 in the final round and still hasn't won. 
All the hype is about the new Augusta National. By Sunday afternoon, the focus will shift back to the players who are desperate to win golf's most prestigious prize.

Par-3 
perfect for Price 
Associated Press 
AUGUSTA, Ga. 

Sometimes, winning at 
Augusta isn't the ultimate goal. As champion of the Masters ·par-3 contest Wednesday, Nick 
Price knows the feeling. 
Price defeated Mark 
Calca.vecchia on the second 
hole of a playoff to earn one of 
the more dubious titles in golf. 
No player who has won the 
par-3 contest has gone on to 
win the main tournament that 
year. . 
Price and Calcavecchia tied 
with scores of 5-under 22 on 
the cute little course, located 
just behind the 10th hole at 
Augusta National. 
Price won when Calcavecchia 
dumped two shots into tile 
huge lake on the second play­
off hole. After the second 
water ball, Calcavecchia 
reached over and shook Price's 
hand. 
While Price won the tourna­
ment, the star of the day was 
Toshi Izawa of Japan. 
Izawa made holes-in-one on 
Nos. 5 and 6 and joined Claude 
Harmon (1968) as only the sec­
ond player to ace back-to-back 
holes on the par-3 course. 
Izawa also made quadruple­
bogey on No. 4 and finished at 
1 under. 
"I don't want to use up all 
my luck today," he said. "I 
want to save some for the tour­

RCIA: Journey to Becoming Catholic 
''I Believe. '' 
¦ by Fr. Gary Chamberland, c.s.c. Rector, Keenan Hall & Assist~nt Director, RCIA 
{NOTE: This column was initially written to appear just before Spring Break} 
This past Sunday, nineteen members ofthe Notre Dame community joined the Roman Catholic Church at the 11 :45 a.m. Basilica Mass. After the homily, they were called forward and asked to join with the assembly in professing the creed. Baptized Christians this served as a reaffirmation of their faith. They were then invited to affirm that baptismal faith in the context of the Catholic Church. Together they proclaimed, " I believe and profess all that the holy Catholic Church believes, teaches and proclaims co be revealed by God," -a bold statement of faith and of confidence by the newest members of our faith community. 
Liturgy is a powerful tool that can bring us up short and make us confront the very reality in 
which we claim to exist. As the presider at 
Sunday's liturgy, that simple and straight­

lieve and profess all that the holy Catholic

Church believes, teaches and proclaims to Church and fail to recognize that they be revealed by God." Bold, powerful and awesome are words to describe such a proc­

lamation. Daunting, overwhelming and im­They long for what I have taken for possible are other words that some might also use. It would be easy to dismiss such a
granted and, at times, not really even 
statement as a simple liturgical formula cared about. Their presence calls us without much meaning or import. Yet, that casts a pall over all liturgical statements and 
to reflect on our own relationship with 
formulas. One wouldn't want to journey too far down 
God and with the Church. that path with regards to other statements such as "The 
Body of Christ." 

No, the statement must be understood as it was 
spoken and the actoffaith it represents be taken as the 
awesome reality which it is. As I listened to these can­
didates profess their faith, as I witness the catechu­mens depart each week after the homily to further reflect on God's word and their journey toward baptism, as I watch these men and women give up precious time, energy and effort to reflect on their lives, their beliefs and their heart's d_esires, I am in awe. I cannot look at these journeyers on the road to discipleship in the Catholic Church and fail to recognize that they actively seek what I have always had. They long for what I have taken for granted and, at rimes, not really even cared about. Their presence calls us to reflect on our own relationship with God and with the Church. 
In fifteen years ofworking with RCIA programs, I know that it is not an easy journey for those seeking to be baptized or those desiring full communion in the Church. There can be a lot of dying to self along the way. Parents and family, though often supportive, do not always understand. The church's teaching challenges per­sonal opinions and beliefs about morality, ethics, spirituality and dogma. American individualism meets communitarianism head-on and the clash can be difficult to negotiate. Truly, it is a leap of faith to stand before the gathered assembly and proclaim, "I believe and profess ..." And it should be, because faith is what it is all about. 
It was faith that led these men and women to the church in the first place and it is faith that will sustain them along the road of life. The process of formation and catechesis must be thorough in its attempt to expose the enquirers to our beliefs and practices. But no program will give them everything; no process can remove all doubt and fear. Ultimately, each person, after study, reflection and prayer must jump into the unknown reality offaith or not. Each ofus, as Catholics, must make the statement with our lips, our heart and our lives, "I believe everything that the holy Catholic Church believes, teaches and professes to be revealed by God." 
That doesn't mean that we won't have doubts and questions or come to some degree of intellectual dissent. It is rather a profound sense ofan inspired Church -a Church living under the guidance ofthe Spirit and operat­ing in the world to bring all of creation to the glory of God's kingdom. It is a deep recognition that there is something greater than us at work in the mystery ofthe Church; that there are truths beyond our current ability to understand. It is a statement made in' a moment to be lived out and fulfilled in a lifetime. It is an act offaith proclaimed in truth today that is also act ofhope that proclaims its future fulfillment. It is an invitation to the Holy Spirit to bring to completion the work already begun. 
As we celebrate the lives offaith ofour new Catholic brothers and sisters, let us pray for them as they continue their journey offaith. And let us pray for ourselves as well. Guided by their example, may we enter more deeply into our life offaith in the Church and become more completely that which we proclaim to be -members ofthe Body ofChrist.

Griffey set to return in 3 to 6 weeks 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI 

Ken Griffey Jr. 's injured right knee is healing quickly and he could return to the field in three to six weeks, the Cincinnati Reds' team doctor said following a re-examina­tion Wednesday. 
There has been "vast improvement .. in the knee since the All-Star center field­er partially tore the patella tendon and partially dislocat­ed his kneecap during a run­down in Sunday's game against Montreal, Dr. Timothy Kremchek said. 
"Junior has a full range of motion" Kremchek said. "I am convinced he is right on target to return in three to six weeks." 
Griffey, who began twice­daily physical therapy sessions 
"Junior has a full range ofmotion. I am convinced he is right on target to return in three to six weeks." 
Timothy Kremchek 
Reds' team doctor 

on Monday, was placed on the 15-day disabled list and stayed behind in Cincinnati as the Reds began a road trip in Pittsburgh. 
Orthopedist Dr. James Andrews. a Reds consultant, examined a magnetic reso­nance imaging scan of Griffey's knee and concurred with Kremchck's diagnosis. 
"I recommend Griffey let the injury heal without surgery," Andrews said .. 
The Reds are hoping Griffey 
can return with rest and rehab. 
If not, he would have to undergo surgery, which could sideline him for the rest of the season. 
Ruben Mateo was called up from Triple-A Louisville to take Griffey's spot on the 25­man roster. 
Griffey was bothered during spring training by tendinitis in the same knee. 
Last year, Griffey missed most of the first three months because of a partially torn left hamstring. 
The Reds also said infielder Juan Castro was playing his first game with Triple-A Louisville in Durham, N.C., on a medical rehabilitation assignment when he aggravat­ed his strained left hamstring and left the game Wednesday. He is to be re-evaluated on Thursday in Cincinnati. 
Farnsworth breaks right foot 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO 
As if the Chicago Cubs needed more trouble, reliever Kyle Farnsworth broke a bone in his right foot Wednesday and is likely to be side­lined for four to six weeks. 
He'll be put on the 15-day disabled list Thursday, but the Cubs didn't announce who will take his spot. 
The right-handed setup man was warming up in the bullpen in the seventh inning when he felt something "pop" in his foot. X-rays showed a stress fracture in his right foot. 
Farnsworth's injury could be a costly one for the Cubs. The hard-throwing reliever had a 
2.74 ERA last season, and he's got a 0.00 ERA with two strikeouts in 1 1/3 innings this year. 
And the Cubs learned quickly how much they need him. Chicago manager Don Baylor likely would have brought him in to face Mike Piazza after Roberto Alomar hit a game-tying, solo homer off of Jeff Fassero in the seventh inning Wednesday. 
Instead, Baylor left the left-handed Fassero in, and Piazza hit a homer of his own, giving the Mets the 3-2 victory. 
Chicago is 2-5, with four of the losses by two runs or fewer.

Alon heads to lllinors for batting practice 
A..sociaced Press 
CHICAGO 

Chicago Cubs outfielder Moises Alou, on the disabled list with a strained right calf for the third year in a row, will go to Class-A Daytona this weekend for a rehabilitation assignment. 
Alou wants some more at-bats before Monday, the first day he's eligible to come off the disabled list. He took batting practice for a second day Wednesday. and ran without any trouble. 
"They gave me a choice, and I felt like it was a good idea since I didn't get that many at-bats in spring training," said Alou. who was sidelined for most of the spring with a strained muscle in his left side. "It's a mutual decision. I think I can use 10 at-bats." 
He'll go to Daytona for Friday and Saturday's games. He'll then rejoin the Cubs and hopes to play Monday, when they open a three-game series against the Montreal Expos. 
Alou began his career in Montreal, and his father, Felipe, was the longtime manager there. Though there's artificial turf in Olympic Stadium, he's not wor­ried about it causing problems for his calf. "I played in Montreal for six years, and I came off the disabled list a few times there," he said. ''I'll be careful about it." 
The Cubs will make sure of that. They're struggling without Alou. who, along with Sammy Sosa and Fred McGriff. is expected to give Chicago one of the NL's most potent 3-4-5 lineups. The Cubs are hitting .221, and four of their five losses have been by two or fewer runs. 
Alou, a career 306 hitter, batted .331 with 27 homers and 108 RBIs for the Astros last season. 
Gonzalez skips game with injured hand 
Associated Press 
ARLINGTON, Texas 

Juan Gonzalez wasn't in the Texas lineup Wednesday night against Oakland and was to see a specialist about his injured right hand. 
After taking some swings in the batting cage before the game, Gonzalez pointed to his right thumb and traced a line along the muscle there when asked what the prob­lem was. The Rangers call it a deep bruise, and Gonzalez said he didn't expect to go on the disabled list. 
Rangers spokesman John Blake said Gonzalez was scheduled to see a hand spe­cialist Wednesday night. Blake didn't know when the team would have results from that exam. 
After Gonzalez came out of Tuesday's game, he was taken to Arlington Memorial Hospital for X-rays, which were negative. 
Gonzalez left the game against the Athletics after two innings. He re-aggravat­ed the injury during his only at-bat, an infield popout. Five days earlier, the two­time AL MVP left a game at Oakland in the ninth inning. 
Gonzalez said he initially sustained the injury when he got jammed on a pitch last week in Oakland. He said the pain worsened after several more at-bats, including Tuesday against Barry Zito. 
Through seven games in his return to Texas, Gonzalez is hitting .250 (6-for-24) with no homers and no RBIs. 
With Gonzalez out and sec­ond baseman Michael Young back home in California after the death of a family mem­ber, manager Jerry Narron had just two everyday play­ers available on the bench ­catcher Bill Haselman and infielder Herbert Perry. Rookie Kevin Mench replaced Gonzalez in right field.

"I don't want to see a team with a bunch of D2 players just go out and heat down on every­body," he said. 
NCAA eligibility rules usually prevent college basketball play­ers with eligibility remaining from participating in Bookstore Basketball since it, among other things, predetermines rosters, has corporate sponsorship and use referees in later rounds. Thus, Notre Dame basketball

constant, Clemency said there is a major change to Bookstore this year. Any registration money left over after paying for officials, set-up fees and tro­phies will be donated to the Jumpball program. Jumpball is a basketball cUnic for under­privileged children in Jamaica run by the Notre Dame Club of Jamaica. 
"We just want to throw as much money at them as possi­ble," Clemency said. 
To keep down costs associat­ed with running the tourna­ment, Clemency has picked up several sponsors. PJ Marketing, adidas and the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore have all donated to the tournament. 
adidas donated all the cloth­ing for the commissioner's clothing, while PJ Marketing and the Bookstore are paying for the embroidery for the clothes. The Bookstore also paid for the printing of the books of team names and brackets for distribution to cap­tains. 
players do not participate in Bookstore until after they have exhausted their eligibility. 
"The rule generally is that all competition during the school year that meets those criteria [listed in the NCAA rule book] is banned," said Delise O'Meally. director of membership services fortheNCM. 
Saint Mary's, however. received an exception for its basketball players to play in Bookstore since it is a University-sponsored tourna­ment open to all students, according to athletic director Lynn Kachmarik. 
The only thing that would stop the Saint Mary's underclassmen from playing would be a ban from head coach Suzanne Smith. Smith, however, has no problem with her team playing. 
"They just love playing so I am not going to stop them," Smith said. "If you are going to have an injury, this is the time to do it."

Clemency is still in the process of negotiating with campus groups to gain further sponsorship and lower the cost of the tournament even more. 
'Td love one day to run this thing for just the cost of offi­cials and trophies," he said. 
The tournament continues through April 28, when the open championship, the women's championship and the hall of fame games will be played.

Dunn unsure about Bird 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE 
Everything is telling Seattle Storm coach Lin Dunn to take Sue Bird with the first pick of next week's WNBA draft. 
Bird can pass and score. She can run a team. She has good size and can play more than one position. 
But Dunn hasn't made up her mind. She's hearing plenty of offers from other teams to trade the No. 1 choice for players or another high draft selection. 
"It would have to be an awful­ly, awfully good offer because Sue Bird is awfully, awfully good," said Dunn, also the team's general manager. "I don't know how often in a life­time you get point guards who can score like she can." 
This is the second consecutive year Seattle has selected first in the draft. The Stonn selected 6­foot-5 Australian center Lauren Jackson last year, but still struggled. The team finished 10-22, just four wins better than the franchise's inaugural season the previous year when it finished last in the league at 6-26. 
Dunn said Seattle needs another scorer to become a playoff contender. 

She is also considering Oklahoma's Stacey Dales and· Nikki Teasley of North Carolina. Dunn will complete a final round of evaluations this week­end at a pre-draft combine for the country's top college seniors in Chicago. 
Bird, The Associated Press Player of the Year who led UConn to a 39-0 record this sea­son, would be a good fit in Seattle, where the Storm strug­gled to score from the perimeter last season and is desperate to find an offensive rhythm. 
Seattle shot just 37.8 percent from the field, and 31.3 percent from 3-point range. 
Bird, a 5-foot-9 point guard, averaged 14.4 points and led the nation in free-throw shoot­ing at 89.2 percent for national­champion UConn. 
Bird worked out with the national team last week in Colorado Springs and scrim­maged against WNBA players. 
"I can see her fitting into our style in Seattle," said Storm guard Michelle Marciniak, who attended the workouts in Colorado. "I would love to play with her. She makes everyone around her better and is a very unselfish point guard. I think she would be a great addition to our team for 10 different rea­sons, and they're all positive." 
Despite reports last fall that Jackson was considering not coming back for the second year of her two-year contract, Dunn said she'll have her center.

Catcher Jarrah Myers and first baseman Lisa Mattison have led the offense throughout the winning streak. Myers is hitting .538 with three home runs and 14 HBI. Mattison has dr.iven in 10 and is batting .500. 
Purdue is 29-15 on the year but 0-6 in the Big Ten. The poor record in conference action does not influence Gumpf's assessment of the Boilermakers. 
"Purdue is a good team and we need to contain their hit­ters," the head coach said. 
At the top of that Boilermaker offense is second baseman Andrea Hillsey. The freshman leadoIT hitter holds a team best .362 batting average. Shortstop Katie Crabtree leads the team with 10 homeruns and 33 runs scored. Crabtree is also second in batting average -.340 and RBI -36. First baseman Heidi Foster leads Purdue with 39 RBI. 
For the Irish to extend their 10-game winning streak and 23-game home winning streak, they have to keep improving on their entire game. 
"We have to keep getting bet­ter every day in order to be successful." Gumpf said.

Belles' game canceled again 
By SARAH RYKOWSKI 
Sports Writer 

The Saint Mary's softball team got an unexpected week off and will reopen conference play with its first league home game at Saint Mary's against 
Alma. 

After heavy rains Monday, Tuesday's game at Calvin was rained out and rescheduled to Wednesday. 
When the Belles walked out to board their bus Wednesday morning to travel to Calvin, Saint Mary's head coach John Ganeff informed them that the game was canceled again and that they were to report to practice at 4 p.m. instead. 
"They weren't able to get enough umpires from the league," junior catcher Susan Kutz said. "The game won't be rescheduled this week, because Calvin has a game tomorrow. 
We will probably play them next week." 
Kutz and her teammates had a good practice Wednesday afternoon but had really looked forward to the game. 
"We were all really frustrated that the game was canceled again, but you have to go with the flow," Kutz said.

Carrie Wisen is showing peo­ple more than one freshman pitcher is on the Notre Dame softball pitching staff. In today's game against Purdue, Wisen looks to continue her impressive pitching perfor­mances. 
In her last seven appear­ances, Wisen is 6-0, has a 0.53 ERA and registered 28 strike­outs in 26 1/3 innings pitched. Wisen's success comes from keeping the hitters guessing. 
"Lately, my change-up has been working for me," she said. "I have been able to keep the hitters off-balance." 
Coach Deanna Gumpf needed to use Wisen more with Steffany Stenglein bothered by a groin pull. The Notre Dame head coach knows this experi­ence will help Wisen for more important games in the future. 
"Carrie has been throwing more lately to get here ready for Big East," Gumpf said. "She has been doing very well." 
Third baseman Andrea Loman and right fielder Liz Hartmann both missed Tuesday's doubleheader sweep of Vaplaraiso. Loman broke her right index finger and Hartmann is suffering from a minor back injury. Both Irish regulars are expected back in the lineup today but Stenglein could miss the game. 
"Steff might not go [today]." Gumpf said. "We are going to rest her for the Big East games this weekend. Everyone else should play." 
During their current 10-ga.me winning streak, the Irish have seen their pitching be matched by their offense. As a team, the Irish are batting .361, hit 10 home runs and driven in 7 2 runners. 
"It [run support] gives me more confidence," Wisen said. "I know we are going to score some runs. When I am on the

"I think he's handled it mar­velously," Mainieri said. "There might be additional pressure, but there's also an ability for him to just relax and play the game because he knows he's our shortstop. I feel like he's gotten better every day out there." 
When the Irish take the field on Thursday, they face a Panthers team that has played well for most of the season, en route to already posting 20 wins. Pittsburgh is coming off a doubleheader sweep of Canisius, where right-handed pitcher P.J. Hiser threw a one­hitter in the nightcap. With a sweep of Pittsburgh, Notre Dame could move within a game of first place in the log­jammed Big East.

The women's rowing team will have to get over its solid perfor­mance at last weekend's San Diego Crew Classic in a hurry. 
The Irish must focus to win this weekend, when they face off against Indiana and Purdue in the Indiana Crew Classic. The regatta will take place at the Eagle Creek Reservoir in Indianapolis. 
Notre Dame will see a Purdue squad that was also at the San Diego Crew Classic N the Irish will know before the race what kind of speed Purdue is capable of generating. 
"Purdue was there last week," said Irish head coach Martin Stone. "They were racing fairly well." 
While the Hoosiers may not be as strong as the Irish, they have made improvements this season. 
"Indiana is getting better." said Stone. 
At the San Diego Crew Classic, Notre Dame finished ahead of No. 9 USC, No. 14 Texas and No. 19 Oregon State. But despite the great day for the Irish, they can­not afford to overlook this week­end's race. 
"We'll stay fairly focused," said Stone. The Irish know how important 
each race is. This spring there are only five regattas scheduled before the important Central Region Championship. The Central Region Championship is the race that decides who advances to the NCAA Championships. 
There are so few regattas that the Irish need to show that they are a championship-caliber team at every opportunity. 
"We have so few opportunities to race. We want to take advan­tage of them all," said sopho­more Natalie Ladine. 
In preparation for the race the Irish will have to effectively operate the race plan that worked so well in San Diego. Despite this success Stone knows that the plan can always change given the environment of a par­ticular day's race. 
"You can't predict changes in the race plan," said Stone. "The weather conditions can make the course run longer or shorter by as much as a minute." 
Although the Irish are better on paper than the teams the will face this weekend, there is always the opportunity to get better. 
"We want to see how much of a lead we can get," said Ladine.

BOOKSTORE BASKETBALL XXX I 
. 31st annual 5-on-5 tournam!ent tips off today 
By MIKE CONNOLLY Senior SraffWriter 

Bookstore Basketball XX.XI tips off today starting at 4 p.m. with 16 first-round and preliminary­round games scheduled for the Stepan courts. No. 30 Heteroskedasticity was the only ranked team scheduled to play today. but the game has been rescheduled to later this weekend. 
Head Commissioner Brian Clemency said the 528 teams in this year's tournament are down slightly from the 580 teams in Bookstore XXX but still within the usual range of teams. The goal of the commissioners is to fill at least 512 teams to have at least nine rounds of competition. The largest tournament in the school's history had more than 700 teams, according to Clemency. 
"There is just so much fluctua­tion from year to year we can never predict how many teams we will have," he said. 
Through his unofficial observa­tions, Clemency believes the tour­nament is most popular among freshman males and senior females. 
"Freshman boys play Bookstore like it is their job, while freshman girls on the whole just don't," Clemency said. "That changes as you go on. Senior year, there are less guys playing [than freshmen] and more senior girls [than fresh­men]."

. New rules limit number of varsity athletes on teams 
By MIKE CONNOLLY Senior Staff Writer 
New eligibility rules for Bookstore XXXI are designed to level the playing field and produce a more competitive tournament. according to head commissioner Brian Clemency. 
Starting this year, a team may carry no more than three players who have suited up for a Division II or III college in the past 15 years. Any team with a player who suited up for a Division I college in the last 15 years may not carry more than one Division II or III player. 
Division II and III players are now classified the same way as Irish football players. 
"It was a rule whose time had come. It will make the game more open for everybody," Clemency said. 
The only team affected by the new rule was a team of Saint Mary's basketball players, said Clemency. Last year the Hardcore Strokers, which included five Belles players, made it to the finals of the women's tournament. 
This year, Hardcore Strokers includes three Saint Mary's basket­ball players -Anne Blair, Shaun Russell and Katie Miller -and two other Saint Mary's students. 
Blair, a senior, said she was a lit­tle disappointed about having to break up her team this year but understood why the change was made.
