Rayn1ond lectures on Catholics in Tinseltown 
By ADRIENNE RUFFNER 
News Writer 
Hollywood -a town known for its scandals, sex and violence -is being made safe for Catholics. 
In a lecture titled "Young Catholic Hollywood," Rev. Willie Raymond, national director of Family Theater Productions, told a group of about two dozen stu­dents, faculty and community members in the Hayes-Healy Center Tuesday night how Catholic newcomers to I lollywood can embrace popular filmmaking without sacrificing their spiritual values. 
"Young people, because they are artists and think a lot about the important things, are more open to expressing their faith in film," Raymond said. 
According to Raymond, Family Theater is a production company helps young filmmakers settle in Hollywood and allows them to make films that present moral values -eschewing Hollywood's tendency to make movies rife with sex and violence. 
"So much of what is out there is driven by money, power, trying to be edgy and impressing peers," Raymond said. ''I'm not standing outside Hollywood throwing a grenade and con­demning all of it, because there

out. 

When I first started applying to col­leges, Saint Mary's was the last place on Earth I thought I would end up. I didn't even consider it as an option until the school I had planned on attending sent me a letter saying they had mistakenly accepted too many freshmen and had randomly selected me as one of the "lucky" students being asked to find another school. 
After waging a battle to be reim­bursed for my room deposit, reality struck, it was June and I had no plans for the fall. I had already turned down offers of admission to the other colleges I had applied to, and staying at home for a semester was not an option I was willing to consider. 
Family members encouraged me to apply to Saint Mary's, and because I had no other choices, I relented. My application was turned in and processed with record speed, and a saintly woman in the admissions oiTice helped me to arrange classes for the fall. Despite her kindness and my first campus visit, I was still less than thrilled to know I would be spending four years of my life in South Bend. 
Some days, when the weather is ridieulously awful or I'm just in a grouchy mood, I still curse myself for not going to sehool somewhere else. 
The thing is, though, as the end of my junior year gets closer, I find myself thinking about next year and how much I will not want to leave. 
I don't want to have to grow up and live in the real world. Finding a job and paying bills just seems like too mueh stress. I've watched some of my friends go through the strug­gles of off-campus life and having to provide for themselves, and watched others as they strive to stand out in the increasingly competitive job mar­ket. 
None of it looks like much fun. 
There are things I will not miss at all about this place when I leave ­like forcing myself to eat dining hall food, showering with shoes on and sleeping in a loft. 
This list pales in comparison, how­ever, to what I will miss. 
Most of all, I'll miss my friends. Never again will I be able to live in a plaee where I can have a lifestyle like I do at Saint Mary's. This school has given me the opportunity to meet some of the most fascinating people, and to make some of my best friends. 
It turns out spending four years in South Bend hasn't been as awful as I thought it would be, and spending 24 hours a day at an all-women's col­lege hasn't killed me. 
Who would have thought?

Sparks' initiative helps authors get published 
Special to The Obs~rver 
Among notable Notre Dame alumni, best-selling author Nicholas Sparks often tops the list in the literary category. With novels such as "Message in a Bottle," "A Walk to Remember" and "The Notebook" made into major motion pictures, he is something of a household name. 
Sparks is the benefactor for what is fast becoming a legacy of significant authors to emerge from the Creative Writing Program. 
It has been nearly five years since Sparks, who graduated in 1988 with a finance degree, established a $1.5-million initiative to sup­port aspiring writers. The Sparks initiative underwrites a three-tiered program that includes a fellowship, intern­ship opportunities and the annual Sparks Prize. The prize awards $20,000 to a new graduate of the two­year master's program, who then can stay at Notre Dame for a year to focus on com­pleting a book. 
Since its inception in 2001, the Sparks initiative has become a key component of the Creative Writing Program, whose young authors are experiencing "more success in early pub­lishing than ever expected," according to William 
O'Rourke, director of the program. 
"Three students from the past five years are going to be published by major hous­es," O'Rourke says. "That level of success matches us with any program in the country." 
The 2005 Sparks Prize winner, Angela Hur, achieved what O'Rourke describes as the Sparks "tri­fecta." The fellowship placed her as an editorial intern on Notre Dame Review, the University's award-winning national literary journal. As a Sparks intern, Hur com­pleted a stint at a New York publishing house. Using the Sparks Prize Hur completed her novel, "The Queens of K­Town." O'Rourke predicts it will soon have a publisher. 
Past Sparks Prize winners who have published works include 2004 winner Kelly Kerney, the first to ink a deal with a major house. Her novel, "Born Again," is forthcoming by Harcourt. It is described as a comedy of a girl who secretly reads Darwin and becomes caught between her faith and her intellect in a family of evan­gelicals, charismatics, and speakers-in-tongues. 
Sara Swanson, who won the prize in 2003 and has since had short stories pub­lished in Tampa Review and Connecticut Review. 

SMC Tostal to feature popular band 
Phantom Planet will headline Saint Mary's largest annual social event 
By KATIE KOHLER 
News Writer 
Students will not have to travel to Orange County, Calif. to experience warm weather, good times and "the real O.C." on Thursday evening when all three will invade Saint Mary's campus. 

SMC Tostal -the College's largest social event of the year -will play host to henna tat­too and caricature artists, an indoor picnic and an evening concert featuring Phantom Planet, the band most com­monly known for singing "The O.C." theme song. 
Students from Saint Mary's, Notre Dame, Holy Cross, IUSB and Bethel are invited to attend. The event is hosted by the Student Activities Board (SAB). 

Sophomores Cassie Calion and Noelle Whiteside, co­chairs for the event, decided to deviate from the typical events of the festival -such as fire works and canoe races -and refocus the event around a major concert series. 
"We decided to do a concert series in the evening with small activities during the day," Call on said. 
This year's concert features the band Phantom Planet along with west coast rock band Delaney and Saint Mary's Battle of the Bands winner Slap Bracelet Suicide. 
Calion said SAB began to 

plan the event last October. 
"We wanted to bring some­one rather well known to campus that obviously fit into our budget," Callon said. "We chose Phantom Planet for their smooth California sound 
and the extreme popu­larity for the show 'The O.C.'" 
Student Activities B o a r d President jun­ior Megan Cahill said the date and venue of the event had to be changed in order to bring a big name like Phantom Planet to Saint Mary's.

The events of SMC Tostal, however, are not entirely cen­tered on the concert series. Tostal festivities, such as chair massages and henna art, will t"ake place in the student cen­ter starting at noon, with an indoor dinner picnic in the dining hall that evening. 
Callon and Cahill said they feel a "positive buzz" around campus. 
"The· students seem very excited," Callon said. "We've been receiving e-mails from

is a lot of good work and a lot of good people there, but it's impor­tant to be discerning." 
Family Theater provides many services for young people in the film industry, including Masses, educational services, RCIA pro­grams and a special night once a month called "Prayer and Pasta." 
"It's something reliably Catholic they know they can come to the third Wednesday of every month," Raymond said. "There are a lot of ways to go wrong when you first come to Hollywood." 
The lecture was a part of a series called "Hollywood: Mission Field or Mission Impossible?" sponsored by Notre Dame's Center for Ethics and Culture. The Center brought the series this spring because it recognized the importance of film's impacts on society. 
"Film is so powerful that it's shaping pop culture and even high culture," Raymond said. "People around the world may not know the Secretary General of the U.N., but they know all the big names in Hollywood." 
Family Theater Productions was started in 1947 by Father Patrick Peyton, an Irish immi­grant who graduated from Notre Dame in the late 1930s. Father Peyton made radio shows featur­ing Catholic celebrities. Today, Family Theater is committed to producing films that embody strong values. 
"It's reaJly important to have people who love the truth in the media and in the ftlm industry," Raymond said. "It's important to have people who will not distort the truth." 

Haymond said one of Family Theater's most important contri­butions to the film industry are the Angelus /\wards, a yearly international film festival for film students. Last year, the festival garnered over 700 entries, and during the lecture Raymond showed a lilm called "Christmas Wish List," a story of a generous doctor who teaches a stingy lawyer about Christmas spirit. 
"We never expected the Angelus Awards to grow the way they have," Raymond said. 
In a question and answer ses­sion at the ended of the leeturn, Raymond advised students to be cautious when moving to Hollywood, and he also fielded questions about Notre Dame's ongoing academic freedom debate. 
"What happens at Notre Dame is very important to other Catholics in the country," Raymond said. "I was glad to see [President Jenkins] was not afraid to take on these ques­tions."

2006 is a good year for n1ushrooms 
Lizst year's mild wildfire season brought good cropfor hobbyist hunters 
Associated Press 

BOISE, Idaho -Last year's mild wildfire season in the Northwest may bn bad news for commercial mushroom hunters, but hobbyists are already salivating at the thought of spring morels. 
More than 8.2 million acres of state and federal lands nationwide burned during the 2005 wildfire season, and mushrooms typically thrive in the year after wildfires. But many of last year's fires were in grass and rangeland instead of fon~sts, where the mush­rooms are most often found. 
"Commercial hunters follow the burns, because at peak season they can make $1,000 a day," said Orson Miller Jr., a prominent mycologist who lives in McCall, Idaho. "They'll probably be in other states this year." 
However, pothunters -hob­byists who collect enough of the wild mushrooms for dinner and perhaps some extras for drying -will likely be in luck, Miller said. 
"This year looks particularly good because we got quite a bit of moisture in the soil before the freeze up last fall, and that really gives the morels a chance to grow," Miller said. 
Morels are an aromatic fun­gus with a distinctive cap that looks a bit like a peach pit or pinecone. They are highly prized by gourmet cooks and fine restaurants, and can fetch $30 a pound or more for pick­ers. 
The high prices have led to a competitive commercial pick­ing industry, largely made up of traveling outfits that go from burn site to burn site. For pothunters, nothing is more frustrating than arriving at a favorite mushroom site only to find it's already been picked clean by a commercial outfit. 
"For mushroom hunting in general, this should be a good year because the commercial pieking may be concentrated to a few very small burn areas," said Genille Steiner with the Southern Idaho Mycological Association. 
Marjie Millard, owner of Millard Family Mushrooms in Waldport, Ore., used to travel to burn sites throughout the Northwest to ensure a good spring haul. But these days she spends most of her time pick­ing in her home state. 
"Last year it was Alaska; they had a ton of wildfires up there. People I've talked to this year plan on staying closer to home, maybe in Oregon or Washington," Millard said. 
Lori Carris, a resident mycol­ogist at Washington State University in Pullman, said would-be mushroom gatherers can find morels even without the forest fires. They just have to know what to look for. 
"We can find morels eoming up when there's been con­struction, or on campus here at WSU in the spring when they put new planting beds around a building or shrubs and woodchips," she said. 
The mushrooms also occur naturally, without disruption. 
Finding those fungus flushes is just a matter of timing, she said.

Shiite leader refuses call to step aside 
BAGHDAD -An Iraqi vice president called Tuesday for the embattled Shiite prime minister to step aside so a new government can be formed, becoming the most senior Shiite official publicly to endorse demands for a leadership change to halt the slide toward civil war. 
Vice President Adil Abdul-Mahdi told the 

British Broadcasting Corp. that he met with 
Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari on Monday 
and urged him to give up the nomination for a 
second term because he had lost the confidence 
of the Sunnis and Kurds. 
But Abdul-Mahdi said al-Jaafari refused, insisting he wanted to take his case to parlia­ment, which must approve the new prime min­ister and his Cabinet by a majority vote. 
Asked whether al-Jaafari should withdraw 

his nomination, Abdul-Mahdi said: "Yes, after 
such a time of naming him. not getting approval 
from others now in UIA I the dominant Shiite 
political bloc], there is some rejection so I think 
he should step aside." 

Violence mars French job law protests 
PARIS -Rioting youths swarmed across a downtown Paris plaza, ripping up street signs and park benches and hurling stones and chunks of pavement at police at the end of the largest of massive but mostly peaceful protests Tuesday across France against a new jobs law. 
Riot police fired tear gas and rubber pellets and made repeated charges into the crowds of several hundred youths at Place d'Italie on the Left Bank. carrying away those they arrested. 
The clashes came as more than 1 million 

people poured into the streets across the coun­
try, including 84,000 in Paris, according to 
police. Union organizers put the figure in the 
capital at 700,000-and 3 million nationwide.

Mass. passes health insurance bill 
BOSTON -Lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a bill Tuesday that would make Massachusetts the first state to require that all its citizens have some form of health insurance. 
The plan -approved just 24 hours after the final details were released -would use a combination of financial incentives and penalties to dramatically expand access to health care over the next three years and extend coverage to the state's estimated 500,000 uninsured. 
If all goes as planned, poor people will be offered free or heavily subsidized coverage; those who can afford insurance but refuse to get it will face increasing tax penalties until they obtain coverage; and those already insured will see a modest drop in their premi­ums. 
Bush's AIDS efforts under scrutiny 
WASHINGTON -The Bush administration's $15 billion global AIDS initiative is emphasizing sexual abstinence and fidelity more than Congress intended, and that focus is undermin­ing prevention efforts in poor countries, con­gressional investigators said Tuesday. 
U.S. teams on the ground in Africa and other poor areas told Congress' Government Accountability Office that the requirement that they spend a specific percentage of their money on abstinence is hurting some efforts to tailor prevention programs to countries' needs.

BAGHDAD -Iraqi authori­ties filed genocide charges against Saddam Hussein on Tuesday, accusing the ousted ruler and six others in a 1980s crackdown that killed an estimated 100,000 Kurds in northern Iraq. 
In alleging Saddam sought to exterminate the Kurds, the prosecutors are for the first time accusing him of the sort of far-reaching crimes that the Bush administration has used to justifY the war in Iraq. 
The former Iraqi president returns to court Wednesday in his current 6-month-old trial, facing a possible death sentence if convicted in the killings of more than 140 Shiites. Defense lawyer Khamis al-Obeidi said Saddam plans to make a statement to the court. 
But that case involves a rel­atively small number of vic­tims, and the scope of the allegation pales in compari­son to the crackdown against the Kurds or the suppression of the Shiite uprising in south Iraq in 1991. 
Investigative judge Raid Juhi told reporters he submit­ted the new case against Saddam and the others to the Iraqi High Tribunal -a legal step that is the equivalent of an indictment under Iraqi law. 
His move paves the way for a second trial, which could begin any time after 45 days. Juhi said charges also include crimes against humanity. 
Legal experts said the deci­sion to accuse Saddam of genocide is controversial because the charge is difficult to prove. An international convention following the Nazi Holocaust of World War II defined genocide as an effort "to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group." 
The latest charges involve Saddam's alleged role in Operation Anfal, the 1988 military campaign launched in the final months of the war with Iran to crush independ­ence-minded Kurdish militias and clear Kurds from the sen-sitive Iranian border area of northern Iraq. 

Saddam had accused Kurdish militias of ties to Iran. Thousands of Kurdish villages were razed and their inhabi­tants either killed or dis­placed. 
A memo released by the tri­bunal said the Anfal cam­paign included "savage mili­tary attacks on civilians," including "the use of mustard gas and nerve agents ... to kill and maim rural villagers and to drive them out of their homes." 
"These people were sub­jected to forced displacement and illegal detention involving thousands of civilians," Juhi said. "They were placed in different detention centers. 
The villages were destroyed and burned. Homes and houses of worshippers and buildings of civilians were lev­eled without reason or a mili­tary requirement." 
In the Kurdish city of Sulaimaniyah, Othman Hassan, 72, said he lost two sons and 26 other relatives in Anfal. 
"When I last saw my sons, it was as if I had lost the light of my life," he said. "It was a terrible day when they were taken away. They don't need to hear from any witnesses. Just come here and see the thousands who never knew their parents and the widows who lost their husbands." 
The operations against the Kurds included the March 1988 gas attack on the village of Halabja ·in which 5,000 people, including women and children, died. However, Juhi told The Associated Press that the Halabja attack would be prosecuted separately and was not considered part of the charges filed Tuesday. 
Others accused in the Anfal case include Saddam's cousin, Ali Hassan Majid, or "Chemical Ali"; former Defense Minister Sultan Hashim Ahmad; former intel­ligence chief Saber Abdul Aziz al-Douri; former Republican Guard commander Hussein al-Tikriti; former Nineveh provincial Gov. Taher Tafwiq al-Ani; and former top mili­tary commander Farhan Mutlaq al-Jubouri. 

DeLay departs from an uneasy GOP 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Tom DeLay leaves a troubling legacy for Republicans as they face re-election. 
The Texan, once one of the most pow­erful and feared leaders of Congress, joined Newt Gingrich in helping to lead Republicans to power in 1994. But he became a symbol of the widening ethics scandal that now clouds GOP prospects for continued control. 
Republicans face voters weary of cor­ruption allegations and the heavy-hand­ed tactics DeLay came to personify. At the same time, GOP candidates are fur­ther weighed down by President Bush's low approval ratings and the unpopu­larity of the war in Iraq. 
"It's hard to believe that in just 12 years, Republicans could end up in the same situation that it took Democrats 40 years to get in," said Republican strate­gist Frank Luntz. 
Luntz, who was once Gingrich's poll­ster and who helped orchestrate the 1994 "Contract With America," a set of unifying GOP policy initiatives, said the GOP majority now seems "tired" and those speaking out for change and inno­vation "are just not being noticed." 
Republicans hold 231 of the 435 House seats. Democrats have 201. There is one independent and two vacancies. 
DeLay said Tuesday he would resign from Congress rather than seek a 12th term so as not to hurt Republican chances. He acknowledged his re-elec­tion prospects were threatened. 
The voters of his Houston-area district "deserve a campaign about the vital national issues that they care most about and that affect their lives every day, and not a campaign focused solely as a referendum on me," DeLay said. 
He had stepped aside as House major­ity leader last fall after a grand jury in Texas indicted him, accusing him of fun­neling illegal corporate contributions into state legislative races. In January, he decided against trying to get the leadership post back amid a spreading election-year corruption scandal.

IN BRIEF 
Delta pilots vote to authorize strike 
ATLANTA -Delta Air Lines Inc. pilots, angered by management's effort to throw out their contract and impose deep pay cuts, voted by a wide margin to authorize a strike, union leaders said Tuesday. 
The 94.7 percent vote in favor of authorizing a strike gives union leaders the authority to set a strike date. They didn't set a date immediate­ly and gave no indication when they might act. 
The results were announced in a memo to pilots from the chairman of the union's execu­tive committee, Lee Moak, and first reported by The Associated Press. 
An arbitration panel must decide by April 15 whether to void the pilots' contract. The union has said it will strike if its contract is rejected. 
The nation's third largest carrier, which is operating under bankruptcy protection, has said a strike would put it out of business. 
Any strike would likely prompt a court chal­lenge by the company, which would almost cer­tainly seek a restraining order. Moak said in an interview the union will "do what is legal." 

CEO says Delphi will avoid a strike 
DETHOIT -The chairman and chief executive of Delphi Corp. said Monday that he is confident the troubled auto parts supplier will avoid a strike that would devastate General Motors Corp., Delphi's fi>rmer parent and largest customer. 
Speaking to the Detroit Economic Club, Robert S. "Steve" Miller said the bankruptcy court motion the company tiled Friday, asking a judge to void its labor contracts, was "an insurance policy" he hoped the eompany would not have to use. 
The United Auto Workers has warned that a long strike would be inevitable if the judge agrees to void the contract<; and Delphi imposes its most recent proposal, which would have lowered wages from $27 to $22 through 2007, and then to $16.50. The offer was rejected by the UAW and other unions. 
Asked after the speech whether Delphi would be able to avoid a strike, Miller answered: "Absolutely." 
"We are determined to work this out," he told reporters on his way out the door. 
Delphi has about 6,000 employees in Indiana, most of whom work at the company's Electronics & Safety Division headquarters in Kokomo.

IBM supports teaching careers 
Company helps interested employees move from Big Blue into the classroom

"The fact that they're going through our profiles and looking at all of this stuff and kind of going into our per­sonal space ... made me feel attacked, almost," she said. 
Since the girls removed the group from Facebook, the incident stayed within the dorm and was not sent to HesLife.

"It seems pretty expected actually," Mering said. 
Mering said she uses the available security settings to make her phone number, addrnss, and pietures visible only to her friends, making sure people she does nl)t know are not able to view her personal information.

U.S. Immigration and Customs 1\nforcement officials have collaborated since 1998 with the Justice Department, which flies U.S. prisoners throughout the country. But immigration officials are step­ping up the number of flights as they come under increas­ing pressure to ensure all ille­gal immigrants caught in the 

U.S. arc deported. An estimat­ed 11 million immigrants live in the U.S. illegally. 
Hundreds of captured immi­
grants arc released each 
week and asked to return for 
a court hearing, a request 
many ignore. 

The government hopes to end that practice on the Southwest border by Oct. 1 and across the rest of the country by next year. To do that, officials have been speeding up the timetable to de port foreigners who arrive without papers. 
Scores of non-Mexican 
immigrants now need to be 
shuttled out of the country 
each week. Almost all 
Mexicans caught without 
papers in the U.S. are driven 
to the border by immigration 
officials and dropped off. Last 
year, that was almost 1 mil­
lion people. 

The people on this flight were caught because they committed crimes in the U.S. 
Medina fought with his girl­friend and was arrested for domestic violence. Another, Jose Cabrera, was arrested six or seven times for auto theft, drug possession and other crimes. 
The government doesn't keep statistics on how many of the deported immigrants return to the United States. There's almost no way of knowing unless they are picked up again, but officials guess there are many.

and deported for not having papers. He told officials he was Mexican, so they dropped him off across the border in Tijuana, south of San Diego. Within a year, he had found his way back into the United States. 
Asked if he thinks he can 
come back illegally, Medina 
said in Spanish, "Es possible." 
It's possible. 
John Torres, acting director of the immigration agency's office of detention and removal, said that for now the best way to deal with the almost 1.2 million people who are caught in the U.S. illegally each year is to send them back as quickly as possible, as most are. 
"The more people we arrest and the more people we return to their country serves as a deterrent to others think­ing of coming," he said. 
The Department of Homeland Security is pushing several countries to take back thousands of their citizens, with department Secretary Michael Chertoff saying Tuesday that a deal with China was near. 
But some fear the govern­ment is denying migrants their rights in its rush to deal with a backlog of immigrants. 
Immigrant advocates say some government screeners are not following regulations, and that some people with legitimate claims for asylum in the U.S. may be deported. 
Foreign governments also struggle to absorb hundreds of their own citizens. 
In El Salvador, returning migrants are placed in a "Welcome Home" program to help them find family and -if possible -a job. 




Police, arllly involved in Columbia drug ring 
Group flew cocaine shipments into U.S. 
Associated Press 

BOGOTA, Colombia Active and retired police and army officers working for one of Colombia's largest cocaine cartels used commereial cargo planes to ship drugs to the United States, authorities said Tuesday in announcing seven arrests. 
U.S. officials, who are seek­ing the extradition of the seven, said the case illus­trates the reaches of Colombia's notorious drug rings and the danger posed by corruption among the country's security and trans­portation workers. 
Among those arrested are a retired police major and cap­tain, a former army lieu­tenant, two police officers and an employee of Colombia's national airline, Avianca. The seventh suspeet was described as a liaison between the active and for­mer police officials and the Norte del Valle cartel, one of Colombia's largest drug traf­fickers. Police said the cartel used Avianca's cargo plans to transport the drugs. 
"There is a national securi­ty component to this case," said Boyd Johnson, chief of the international narcotics trafficking unit at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan. 
Authorities said the seven would be extradited to New York to stand trial on charges they smuggled more than 900 pounds of cocaine bound for the United States. Police said they seized 1,200 pounds of cocaine linked to the cartel in a warehouse in northern Bogota on Monday. 
The arrests, beginning Monday night, were based on a U.S. indictment in New York that alleges the Norte del Valle cartel recruited the airline worker and police involved with security at El Dorado Airport. 
It alleges the ring shipped the cocaine in October through Avianca's cargo facility after an airline employee approved false paperwork. The drugs were allegedly destined for the United States via Mexico. 
Two patrolmen let the ship­ment go through security and guarded it for three days at the airline cargo area, the indictment alleges. The cocaine noted in the indict­ment was seized in Mexico City by Mexican law enforce­ment agencies on Oct. 17, it adds. 
If convicted, the defendants could face anywhere from 1 0 years to life in prison, though the United States has assured Colombia that it will not seek life sentences for defendants extradited from there. 
Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine. In the last four years, nearly 350 Colombians have been extradited to the United States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges. 
The Norte delVallc cocaine cartel is considered to be one of the largest mafias operat­ing in Colombia. One of its leaders, Diego Montoya, sits alongside Osama Bin Laden on the FBI's ten-most-wanted list.

Intelligence officers 
discuss Iraq's future 
Arab countries, Turkey make civil war plans 
Associated Press 
CAIRO, Egypt -Top intel­ligence officers from several Arab countries and Turkey have been meeting secretly to coordinate their govern­ments' strategies in case civil war erupts in Iraq and in an attempt to block Iran's interference in the war-torn nation, Arab diplomats said Tuesday. 
The meetings came after several Arab leaders voiced concerns about possible Shiite domination of Iraq and their alliance with Iran. 
The four diplomats said intelligence chiefs from Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and non-Arab Turkey held a series of meetings over the last few weeks to assess the situation in Iraq and work out plans to avoid any regional backlash that may result from sectarian con­11ict in Iraq. 
The diplomats in several Middle Eastern capitals, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said Iran and Syria have been excluded from the talks. 
One diplomat whose coun­try is involved in the talks said the officials are focus­ing on the proposed U.S.­Iranian dialogue on Iraq and the implications on Arabs and Turkey of any "American-Iranian deal." 
Government officials in Egypt and Jordan declined to answer questions on the meetings. 
Reports in the Arab press have suggested that any agreement between Washington and Tehran will be at the expense of Arabs. 
Arab nations, mostly Sunni and traditionally sus­picious of Iran, are deeply concerned about what they see as Iran's growing influ­ence in Iraq. Turkey, also a key Sunni Muslim nation, is worried about Iraq's split into sectarian and ethnic entities that will give rise to Kurdish ambitions for inde­pendence. 
Last year, Jordan's King Abdullah II accused Shiite­dominated Iran of trying to influence events in Iraq. He warned that Iran was seek­ing to create "a Shiite cres­cent" that would disrupt the balance of power in the region. 
Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal made similar warnings. 
Before Iraqis voted on their new constitution last year, both Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa and Abdul Rahman al-Attiya, head of the Gulf Cooperation Council, lobbied to include a clear reference about Iraq's "Arab identity" in the document. 
Elections held in January produced a parliament dom­inated by Shiites and Kurds, and a ruling coalition by both groups is bound to have close ties to Persian and Shiite Iran. 
Many Arab governments say that sidelining the Sunnis would increase Iran's influence in Iraq and the whole region -anathema for Sunni Arabs and a night­mare for many Washington policy-makers. 
At least one meeting of the intelligence chiefs was held in Cairo in late March, shortly after the U.S. admin­istration said it wanted to open contacts with Tehran about Iraq, the diplomats said. 
They said further meet­ings are planned, including at least one in Cairo this month to finalize the strate­gy. 
Since the ousting of Saddam Hussein three years ago, officials from Iraq's neighbors have held scores of meetings on Iraq but the discussions have not yielded concrete efforts to help restoring stability to the beleaguered nation.

Exposed British spy killed 
Secret agent served as Sinn Fein legislative chief in Northern Ireland 
Associated Press 
DUBLIN, Ireland-A former Sinn Fein official recently exposed as a British spy was found fatally shot Tuesday after apparently being tortured, police said -a slaying certain to send shock waves through Northern Ireland's peace process. 
Denis Donaldson was Sinn Fein's former legislative chief in the failed power-sharing govern­ment of Northern Ireland. He admitted in December he had been on the payroll of the British secret service and the province's anti-terrorist police for two decades. He went into hiding because the traditional Irish Republican Army punish­ment for informing is death. 
But the IRA denied responsi­bility in a one-line statement. "The IRA had no involvement whatsoever in the death of Denis Donaldson," the outlawed group said. 
Irish Justice Minister Michael McDowell said the 55-year-old Donaldson had been tortured before being killed -apparently with one or two shotgun blasts to his head -inside his isolated home near Glenties, County Donegal, in northwest Ireland. He was last seen alive Monday while walking in the village, McDowell said. 
"His right forearm is almost severed," McDowell said. "He was shot in the head and mutila­tion was done to his body. It's a murder we're dealing with." 
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and British Prime Minister Tony Blair both con­demned the murder. 
The killing comes at a pivotal moment in Northern Ireland's 13-year-old peace process. 
On Thursday, Blair and Ahern are to travel to Northern Ireland to reveal a new blueprint for reviving a Protestant-Catholic administration, the intended cornerstone of the province's 1998 peace accord. 
The plan -3 1/2 years of diplomacy in the making _ would call for Northern Ireland's legislature to reconvene in mid­May and face a Nov. 24 deadline to elect an administration. 
The killing appeared certain to harden Protestant opinion against cooperating with Sinn Fein, the IRA-linked party that represents most Catholics in Northern Ireland. But officials in both governments said Thursday's announcement would go ahead anyway. 
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams -who in December initially defended Donaldson as an inno­cent man, then outed him as a British spy -said he did not know who killed him. But he suggested it might have been the work of IRA dissidents opposed to Sinn Fein's peacemaking efforts. 
"It is likely that his death at this time is intended to under­mine current efforts to make political progress," Adams said. "Those who carried out this murder are clearly opposed to the peace process." 
But Ian Paisley, whose Democratic Unionist Party rep­resents most of Northern Ireland's British Protestant majority, said someone within IRA ranks was the most likely culprit. "There is a fmger-point­ing tonight at IRA-Sinn Fein," he said. 
A Catholic-Protestant adminis­tration for Northern Ireland fell apart in October 2002 because of an IRA spying scandal involv­ing Donaldson. 
Donaldson and two others were charged with pilfering doc­uments that identified the per­sonal details of thousands of potential IRA targets. Protestants accused the IRA of plotting a potential resumption of its violent campaign to oust Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom. 
But British prosecutors myste­riously dropped all charges in early December. A week later, Adams announced that Donaldson had confessed to being a paid British spy. Within hours, Donaldson admitted the same in a television interview. 
During its 27-year campaign, the IRA's internal security unit tortured scores of IRA members suspected of passing information to British intelligence. Typical IRA methods included drowning the interrogation victim in a bathtub, applying electric shocks, and administering ciga­rette burns. 
Those who admitted informing had their confessions audio­taped before being shot in the head; their bodies were usually dumped ±-naked and with hands tied behind their backs ­on rural roadsides. 
The IRA last year declared it was renouncing violence for political purposes and backed the pledge by handing over its weapons stockpiles -moves supposed to spur a revival of power-sharing involving Sinn Fein. 
But Paisley has refused to cooperate with Sinn Fein, citing the IRA's refusal to disband and its alleged involvement in crimi­nal activities.

Brother of '111ilkshake
Senators add 111oney to Iraq bill 
Republicans worry $107 billion figure will increase on Senate floor 
111urder' victi111 killed 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A bill to fund the war in Iraq bal­looned by more than $10 bil­lion Tuesday after a Senate panel added funding for everything from fighting bird nu to repairing oyster beds. 
The extras are sure to pro­voke a reaction from GOP conservatives already com­plaining about their party's recent record on spending. But the temptation for using the must-pass bill containing $67.S billion for the Pentagon's mission in Iraq _ and some $27 billion in addi­tional hurricane relief along the Gulf Coast -as a loco­motive to drive even more spending proved too diiTicult for senators to pass up. 
Overall. the bill would cost about $107 billion. 
That's still not enough for Gulf Coast senators like Mary Landrieu, D-La., who marchnd from the Senate Appropriations Committee vote to the Senate Press Gallery to demand another $5 billion-plus to rellect new Army Corps of Engineers estimates of what will be needed for Louisiana levees. 
Landrieu vows to block Senate confirmation of every Bush administration appointment until President Bush supports the new and higher figure. 
Senators piled the extra money into the bill on a series of voice votes -at a pace of almost $100 million per minute of debate -with high-ranking Republicans such as Majority Whip Mitch McConnell of Kentucky sit­ting by in silence. 
The addition a! funding includes:

$4 billion for farmers hit by drought, floods and high energy costs. Top supporters were Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and Conrad Burns, R-Mont.

Homeland Security press secretary charged with seducing minor 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -The deputy press secretary for the U.S. Department of Homeland Seeurity was arrested Tuesday for using the Internet to seduce what he thought was a teenage ~-,rirl, authorities said. 
Brian J. Doyle, 55, was arrest­ed at his residence in Maryland on eharges of use of a computer to seduce a child and transmis­sion of harmful material to a minor. The charges were issued out of Polk County, Fla. 
Doyle, of Silver Spring, Md., had a sexually explicit conversa­tion with what he b(llieved was a 14-year-old girl whose profile he saw on the Internet on March 14, the Polk County Sheritrs Office said in a statement. 
The girl was an undercover Polk County Sheriff's Computer Crimes detective, the sheriff's office said. 
Doyle sent the girl pornograph­ic movie clips and had sexually explicit conversations via the Internet, the statement said. 
During other online conversa­tions, Doyle revealed his name, that he worked for the Homeland Security Department and offered his office and government issued cell phone numbers, the sheriff's office said. 
Doyle also sent photos of him­self to the girl, but authorities said they were not sexually explicit. 
On several occasions, Doyle instrueted her to perform a sexu­al act while thinking of him and described explicit activities he wanted to have with her, investi­gators said. 
Doyle later had a telephone conversation with an undercover deputy posing as the teenager and encouraged her to purchase a web camera to send graphic images of herself to him, the sheriff's office said. 

He was booked into Maryland's Montgomery County jail where he was waiting to be extradited to Florida, the sheriff's office said. 
There was no immediate response to messages left on Doyle's government-issued cell phone and his e-mail, and he could not be reached by phone at the jail for comment. 
Homeland Security press sec­retary Russ Knocke in Washington said he could not comment on the details of the investigation. "We take these allegations very seriously, and we will cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation," Knocke said. 
Russell said Kissel had planned to plead guilty Thursday in connection with the federal case in New York. 
"Andrew did bad things," his father, William, told The Associated Press Tuesday. "He took money from a lot of peo­ple. He was killed in an extremely vengeful, angry way." 
William Kissel said his son was killed in the basement of the house. 
"Someone got in there in a very narrow timeline," William Kissel said. "Someone had to know something." 
Andrew Kissel's brother, Hobert, was killed in 2003 after his wife, Nancy, fed him a drug-laced milkshake and beat him to death with a statuette. She was convicted of murder and is serving a life sentence. 
Andrew Kissel and his recently estranged wife tem­porarily cared for his brother's three children before the youngsters were formally handed over to the custody of the Kissels' sister. 
In divorce papers, Hayley Kissel said her husband had sought treatment for a drink­ing problem and had commit­ted fraud against her, including forging powers of attorney to transfer property she owned in Vermont and converting assets for his own use in violation of court orders. The couple have two children. 
Joseph Martini, her attorney, had little comment. 
"Right now, she is focused on her children and trying to get them through what is obviously a tragic ordeal for them and trying to get herself through it," Martini said. 
Kissel also was being sued by a former business partner. 
news conference at which he dis­cussed women's basketball before Duke played Maryland in the national championship game. 
He said the Duke women's team should not be drawn into the discussion over what hap­pened at the lacrosse party. 
"I think the Duke basketball team is a terrific team," Brand said. "I don't think that's in the least bit overshadowed or taken anything away from the women. In fact, I think by pushing the women to answer something that they have no role to play, that strikes me as misleading to read­ers. I know some journalists have done that." 
Brand also said he thought Duke president Richard Brodhead was correct in sus­pending the lacrosse team's sea­son until the university learns more about what happened at the party. The lacrosse team's co­captains have denied that anyone was sexually assaulted or raped at the party. 
'Tm pleased to see they're tak­ing strong steps until they get to the bottom of it," Brand said of Duke's administration. 
Several campus demonstra­tions have criticized Duke for not doing enough, but Brand called Brodhead's decision "evidence that the administration and facul­ty are treating it very seriously and not ignoring it."

Brand said no assumptions about guilt or innocence should be made before the case runs its course. 
"Nonetheless, the situation that arose was inappropriate at best," he said in Boston, where he is attending the NCAA women's basketball championship game. "It is inappropriate that we should have any group of young men, let alone those who play on our athletic teams, inviting a stripper, underage alcohol and that kind of environment."

Musicians displaced by hurricane 'sing back' to city 
Associated Press 
AUSTIN -The music of New Orleans is huddled in an old Austin recording studio. 
Some of the Crescent City's musical legends have returned to this Texas city where -just six weeks after Hurricane Katrina ­they cut a therapeutic album dedi­cated to their ravaged hometown. 
At that post-Katrina recording session, names synonymous with New Orleans-Neville, Porter, Nocentelli, Rebennack -gath­ered to channel their raw emo­tions into the bittersweet tribute, "Sing Me Back Home." 
On a recent evening, a few weeks before the release of their album, they reconvened. 
"The music lives on in those players, no matter where they are," says George Porter Jr., the bassist and band leader of the New Orleans Social Club, the name the collective has adopted. 
The great talents of the New Orleans music scene had been accustomed to living minutes away from each other in the Ninth Ward, but Katrina scattered them across Texas, Colorado and else­where. 
"I think I live in South Austin," says Cyril Neville, still trying to get his bearings on his new home. On the album, released this week, he passionately sings Curtis Mayfield's "This Is My Country." 
In the weeks after Katrina, pro­ducer Leo Sacks assembled the New Orleans Social Club -a five­piece band led by Porter, best known as one of the founding members of the Meters. Fellow Meter Leo Nocentelli joined on guitar, as well as Ivan Neville on organ, Henry Butler on piano and Raymond Weber on drums. 
Many guests were brought in. Dr. John (whose real name is Mac Rebennack) plays "Walking to New Orleans"; John Boutte covers Annie Lennox's "Why"; and Big Chief Monk Boudreaux sings the specially composed "Chase." 
"I knew as soon as you got New Orleans cats together you were going to have the spirit and sound of the city," says Sacks. "We could address all the emotions of the moment." 
As much of the album proves, those emotions were running high. Between songs, many were busy tracking the damage to their homes, looking at old photos or speaking to family members dis­persed by the storm. 
"It helped me to be with these guys and be busy, take my mind off of it," says Weber, who has migrated to Austin with his family. "It was like being back home." 
Since portions of the proceeds from "Sing Me Back Home" will benefit the Salvation Army, the New Orleans Musicians Clinic and Music Cares, Weber says he's in the funny position of raising money for his own cause -to rebuild his home. 
''I'm part of the project as well, because we did it for Katrina vic­tims who want to come on back home," he says, laughing heartily. "I want to go back home[" 
Ivan Neville is the son of New Orleans icon Aaron Neville, whose house was ruined in the floodwa­ters of Katrina. Like countless New Orleans residents, Ivan feels the government has let down his city and his people, and expresses that by covering Creedence Clearwater's "Fortunate Son." 
"A song like 'Fortunate Son' 


was pertinent when it was out during the Vietnam War," says Neville, who is currently living in Austin. "And the fact that that's still relevant now is ridiculous." 
Like "Fortunate Son" (which Rolling Stone called "outraged funk"), much of "Sing Me Back Home" is imbued with political protest. 
"Too many have died protecting my pride, for me to go second class," Cyril Neville (brother to Aaron and Art) sings on "This Is My Country." 
Brooks releases DVD collection 
Director discusses the eight comedies included in his $100 box set 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Mel Brooks would love to see a run on the new DVD collection of eight of his gleefully manic movie come­dies, including "Blazing Saddles," "Young Frankenstein" and "High Anxiety." 
"I think people should buy 20 of them. Buy 20 and save a lot of them for Christmas presents. Who knows how many of these they make? They might be gone," Brooks said, and not entirely in jest. 
It's not that Brooks, 79, who turned his 1968 film "The Producers" into a Broadway money machine, could be fman­cially strapped. Profit isn't the issue, he said. 
"I want these movies to be seen. Nobody has seen 'The Twelve Chairs' or 'Silent Movie,"' he said, naming two of the hard-to-find titles in the boxed set out this week. 
Brooks is especially fond of 1970's "The Twelve Chairs," based on an early 1900s novel by two writers in the new Soviet Union who "were like me ­they were crazy. They were tongue-in-cheek comedy writ­ers," he said. 
He recognized back then that the film, made in Yugoslavia for less than $1 million, was "a great indulgence, because I did­n't think anybody would go for it." Time has proved him wrong. 
"Through the years, I keep getting letters: 'My favorite 
movie of all the movies you've done is "The Twelve Chairs." . Not only is it funny but it's mov­ing, it has heart,"' Brooks said, 
reciting a typical mash note. 
"You never know. You never 
know," he mused. 
He is certain about what 
helped shape his approach to 
comedy. As a newcomer he 
shared writing duties on Sid 
Caesar's classic '50s sketch 
series, "Your Show of Shows," 
with other humorists destined 
for fame, among them Neil 
Simon, Larry Gelbart and Carl 
Reiner. 
They were heavily influenced 
by the show's producer, Max 
Uebman, Brooks recalled. 
"It was like Liebman 
University. He taught us the 
best humor comes out of the 
human condition, out of the 
weakness of people, their greed, 
their broken promises," he said. 
"We didn't write jokes. We 
wrote little stories with charac­
ters, which prepares you to 
write screenplays. Our sketches 
were mini-movies. They weren't 
situation comedy, where they 
ride on a very thin premise, like 
an angry neighbor, for 30 min­
utes." 
If there's a theme that con­
nects his movies, he said, "it's 
greed or love, love or greed.... 
Do you want to be good or want 
to be rich? You can't be both." 
The jacket of the DVD set is 
decorated not with critical 
praise but with snippets of his 
movie dialogue. 
There's "What a dramatic air­port" from "High Anxiety"; "I hate people I don't like" from "The Twelve Chairs" and "How womantic" from "Blazing Saddles," which Brooks afi­cionados will know to pro­nounce with an overheated Marlene Dietrich accent. 

Other films in the collection (Fox Home Entertainment, $99.98) are "Robin Hood: Men in Tights," "To Be or Not to Be" and "History of the World Part 1." 
Reviewers rarely had kind words for his parodies of film genres including Hitchcock thrillers, Westerns and disaster dramas. "The Producers," for instance, about two sadsacks trying to swindle investors by staging a musical with Hitler as the hero, was panned by one critic as "an almost flawless tri­umph of bad taste, unredeemed by wit or style." 
(The Zero Mostel-Gene Wilder film is excluded from the DVD set because it's to be released along with last year's musical version, based on the stage play and starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, Brooks said.) 
If critics didn't appreciate Brooks and his singular, some­times sophomoric work, his tar­get audience did. 
"When we did 'Young Frankenstein,' we knew we could get the college crowd. They loved the Mary Shelley novel," Brooks said. "If you did­n't get the references, you couldn't enjoy my movies." 
Much of the album, though, is full of toe-tapping optimism. The Mighty Chariots of Fire perform "99 1/2 Won't Do" and Irma Thomas and Marcia Ball sing "Look Up." 
"Music always takes the place of anything that's negative," says Nocentelli; who lost an office space to the hurricane, and whose mother and sister lost everything. "Even though the negativity was there, the music overcomes that." 
"The music heals," echoes Cyril Neville. 
Everyone in the band is con­cerned that the culture of New Orleans will never come back, even ifthe city does. Over 250,000 residents -more than half of the pre-hurricane population, many of them black -remain scattered all over the country. 
"It's never going to be the same because a lot of the poorest people who had to leave are not going to be able to make it back," says Ivan Neville. "To me, that's a major part of the heart and soul of the city: the people." 

Couric 111ay leave NBC for nightly ne-ws sho-w 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Katie Couric may mark her 15th anniversary as "Today" show anchor this week by making the decision to leave. 
She's talk­ing with CBS about taking over as "CBS Evening N e w s " anchor, according to a non-net­work person 


close to the Couric negotiations, and neither CBS nor NBC is dis­puting reports that she could announce a deal as early as this week. There are still some issues left 
to be resolved before a deal is reached, said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Couric's contract with NBC ends in May, and she reportedly needed the network's permission to begin negotiations with another network before next month. NBC's decision to grant it could be an indication that the network expects her to leave, or at least that it wants a decision before outlining its fall program­ming plans to advertisers next month. 
Couric's first day as "Today" anchor was April 5, 1991, and the morning show plans to mark that anniversary on the air Wednesday. Her tenure, with Couric paired the last nine years with Matt Lauer, have brought the morning show unparalleled ratings and financial success. 
Representatives for NBC, CBS and Couric would not comment Tuesday on the discussions. 
Meanwhile, Meredith Vieira of "The View" has emerged as the leading candidate to succeed Couric at "Today" if she leaves, according to people familiar with NBC's thinking. Vieira, a former CBS News reporter who won a Daytime Emmy as host of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," has previously turned down offers to return to news since joining "The View." 
"Today" weekend host Campbell Brown is also a candi­date, along with NBC reporter Natalie Morales and "Today" newsreader Ann Curry. 
Couric, 49, would be the first woman to be named as a sole host of a network evening news­cast -even though Elizabeth Vargas frequently has done that job alone at ABC's "World News Tonight." 
That designation -and the desire to try a new challenge after 15 years of early wake-up calls -is said to be a powerful motivation for Couric. NBC's offer to keep her is reportedly several million dollars more than CBS's offer, but it doesn't include the anchor slot at NBC's "Nightly News," said the person close to the talks. 
She likely would begin at "CBS Evening News" in September.

It has been observed by some well­known political columnists and bloggers that members of the neo-conservative right, which is famously fond of denounc­ing traditional marriage and civil rights f(>r gay and lesbian couples and families, rarnly, if ever, say what rights and social structures they favor for them to provide the support given by these proven institu­tions. Yet the fact of the matter is, accord­ing to the Urban Institute, there arc at least 250,000 same­sex families raising children across the nation. Some of these children arc the product of legal adoption in those states that permit it, like California and Massachusetts. Others are born through artificial insemination (pos­sibly carried by a willing surrogate moth­er) or are "Brokeback Mountain" cases where a gay parent retains child-custody after legal separation. 
It is odd, and more than a little dis­tressing, that the defenders of "family values" and the coiners of the phrase "no child left behind" have remained entirely closemouthed about their policy toward this growing segment of the population. It is almost as if they wish that these fami­lies, and these children, would vanish without a trace. Yet any social historian can tell you that legal marriage has always been primarily about the legit­imization of children and provisions for their protection. Therefore, arguably any national institution that willfully ignores the neod to legally and socially protect a nontrivial cross-section of its children has no real claim to the name "marriage" at all. 
Looking at marriage through the lens 

Lance Gallop 
Tidewater Blues 

of its larger pragmatic goals, and setting aside any questions of its underlying meaning (although I argue that its mean­ings and its goals are aspects of the same thing), one begins to wonder, given its track record, if the institution of marriage is even suitable for the modern world. 
After the 18th century the entire con­cept of marriage was stood completely on its head, as a major segment of the popu­lation began to believe (against all tradi­tion, mind you) that people should marry for the sake of love. This was the first great sexual revolution, and the mother of every lesser moral revolution that has come since, from Dr. Huth to Dr. Phil. Frankly, the theology of marriage, and indeed of human sexuality, has also not yet caught up with this reality. The strain shows in the disconnect between what Christian religions teach and what peo­ple, by their own common-sense morality, hold to be true. (Start up a discussion of condoms at lunch and see what I mean.) 
Can we even honestly claim that mar­riage is doing its job anymore, and are we even certain what the job of marriage should be? Both are valid questions. Besides the aforementioned problem of providing legal protection to the children of gay couples, half of all marriages in the United States end in divorce, millions of children are born to single mothers and millions more are terminated before birth by those who feel unable, emotion­ally or fmancially, to support them. Meanwhile, the failure of many couples to understand the basic mechanics of stable relationships has given rise to a booming relationship self-help industry. 
Something is clearly missing from our implementation of marriage, and as the empirical evidence shows, the institution of marriage is becoming less and less able to fulfill its given role. With this most excellent track record, is it any wonder that more and more couples are choosing to forgo marriage altogether? Perhaps they have taken the smarter road. 
The situation is laughably depressing, and it is hard to construe otherwise. What's more, the conservatives arc very much aware that the institution of mar­riage is not healthy in this country, and that it is neither fuiJilling its larger social purpose nor meeting the nends of those who seek it out. lndend, they arc always quick to enumerate the goals and bnnefiL'i of marriage-protection of children. th11 long-trwm economic stability of society, the physical and emotional health of cou­ples and the physical and emotional health of children. 
Yet the neo-conservatives have already committed themselves to the li>rm of a solution to this problnm -marriage, exactly as it is today, with no compromis­es, no adjustments and no questions asked. The argument has becomn the social science equivalent of creationism, where one side is pre-eommitted to an untouchable ideal handed down from on high. Even when the institution has become self-contradictory, as with its inability to protect the children of gay couples, they remain unwavering. Unchangeable sanctity, they say, even if the institution it totally broken. Meanwhile everyone else is controlling their bladder and trying not to giggle while the old priest from "The Princess Bride" mutters on about "Marwahge." 
What we have lost sight of is the reality that what ultimately sull'ers from all of this neo-conservative rhetoric is marriage itself, along with its loftier goals and all those who have come to depend upon it.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
History validates University's nickname 
As a member who comes from Irish ancestry, I feel compelled to stand up to those who are claiming that the nickname Fighting Irish is offensive -I do not find it offensive one bit. The Notre Dame Athletic Website has written the history of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Web site states that although there are may stories of how the nickname came about, most seem to center around the Notre Dame football team in the early 20th century and how the team was comprised mostly of Irish Catholics. The nickname was drawn from opposing fans who referred to the Notre Dame football team as the Fighting Irish. Before that, the team was known as the terriers, with an Irish terrier named Clashmore Mike as the mascot. Then University president Rev. Matthew Walsh, an Irish-Catholic priest, officially adopted "Fighting Irish" as the Notre Dame nickname in 1927 mainly because the sports team that Notre Dame was known for, its football team, had earned a reputation as Irish­Catholic college students who could play football very well. 
If either of the previous two writers had bothered to do any research in regards to the "Fighting Irish" nickname, they would have found that it had noth­ing to do with the University seeking out to bad­mouth or harm Ireland or Irish People or any con­spiracy on the part of the United States to profit from supposed symbols of the country of Ireland. The nickname came from how hard our football teams played, not out of any "violent" Irish history. If Sinead Howley wants to believe that the University chose the nickname out of spite to Irish history, then I ask the question: If you find it so "offensive," then why are you here? There are hun­dreds of students worldwide who see the nickname Fighting Irish for what it actually is -tradition. If Sinead Howley has a problem with leprechauns, then why does the University allow us to play schools like Canisius, who also sports a mascot that is a mythological creature? The next thing I am hoping for is for guys with beards to start writing into The Observer complaining that the leprechaun unfairly represents their beards. 
Finally I had a problem with Howley stating that the United States is essentially using the country of Ireland and that the United States has great control over the tourism industry and economy of Ireland. Ms. Howley, did you know that Ireland has been reported to have the second highest per capita income of any country in the European Union next to Luxembourg, the fourth highest in the world? Did you also know that during the Celtic Tiger period of economic success in Ireland that Ireland's historic trend of emigration was stopped and Ireland even started to become a destination for many immi­grants? Did you also know that many worldwide countries began to build their businesses in Ireland because of its economic success? Finally, did you know that unemployment in Ireland fell from 18 percent in the late 1980s to 4. 9 percent by the end of the Celtic Tiger period? If Ireland is so dependent on American money, then how do you account for the increase in jobs, the economy and the livelihood of the Republic of Ireland? Ireland's economy is one of the best in Europe, I hardly doubt that one of the best economies in Europe is solely dependent on American money. 
This argument, while intellectually stimulating and interesting enough to stir up conversation, is pointless if the people complaining about it do not fully understand the meaning. Fighting Irish is tra­dition, it is who Notre Dame is. Nobody before the 1900s ever heard of Notre Dame but our football opponents put us on the map by referring to us as a bunch of "Fighting Irish." It has nothing to do with Ireland's nation as a whole nor does it have to do with Irish history. It has to do with the fact that the football team was primarily composed of Irish­Catholics from the Chicago area. If you find it offen­sive, then that is fine, you have that right, but do not argue that it is offensive without understanding its meaning. I do not find it offensive, I understand that it is tradition, and I urge all students of Notre Dame to say loudly and proudly with me, "Go Irish!"

Broken clock 
shames quad 

In Monday's edition of Jockular there was a panel making fun of the fact that the O'Shaughnessy clock is constantly broken. When I was an undergraduate student here there was a comic called 4th and Inches which I recall on a least one occasion also made fun of the fact that the O'Shag clock was perpetually bro­ken. This was some four years ago. So what is my point? It has been four years and they still haven't fixed the O'Shag clock. This is an embarrassment to the university. We spend thousands upon thousands of dollars every year to make everything on this campus look immaculate, and yet we have a massive broken clock which is visible from the whole of South Quad. 
What must visitors to our university think of us when they see this clock? So what exactly is the problem with this clock? Have all the clock engineers transferred to the business school? Is this clock possessed by a demon? In any case, if it is beyond repair for some reason, why don't they just remove it from the building, seeing as in its broken state it is nothing more than a massive eyesore (and don't tell me even a broken clock is right twice a day!). Or, if it is not beyond repair, please fix it!

Saint Mary's is losing 


proven Winner 
As a former member of the Saint Mary's varsity basketball team, I am deeply disap­pointed in the Saint Mary's athletic depart­ment for not renewing coach Steve Bender's contract. In only his first year at Saint Mary's, Coach Bender and his assistant coaches accomplished Saint Mary's' best record in the MIAA. He brought increased recognition and respect to Saint Mary's in the conference when he was named MIAA Coach of the Year. 
The MIAA is one of the oldest and most competitive Division III conferences in the 
U.S. The MIAA consistently sends two to three women's basketball teams to the post­season NCAA tournament. This year, Hope College, a member of the MIAA, won the NCAA Division III National Championship. Not only was Coach Bender able to over­come the challenges of being a first year coach, but he was able to do so in the nationally competitive conference that is the MIAA. 
Saint Mary's will be losing Coach Bender and his assistant coaches, particularly coach Jill Bodensteiner. Having personally been coached by her, I can attest to her loyalty to Saint Mary's, her team and her players. 
Players have expressed their disbelief and surprise openly at Coach Bender's dismissal. While briefly speaking with current players, they reported that they are committed to taking an active role to reinstate coach Bender. 
In recent years, the Saint Mary's Athletic Department has experience increased suc­cess due to the quality of its coaches and support from the Saint Mary's community. I have no reason to believe Coach Bender acted in any way that would cause Saint Mary's to ask him not to return. By not renewing the contract of Coach Bender, the Saint Mary's Athletic Department is jeopard­izing the future success of the Saint Mary's basketball team.

Why you should care about Darfur 
Since 2003, the Sudanese government has been waging a campaign of geno­cide against targeted African communities in Darfur. Brutal murders and rapes continue as government-backed militias attack refugee camps. Disease and malnourishment are rampant in the camps. More than two million people have been displaced, and 400,000 people have died. 
The United States acknowledged that genocide is taking place in Darfur in Sept. 2004 but has yet to take the action necessary to stop the violence. The African Union is failing to keep the peace with its limited number of poorly trained and poorly armed troops. The United Nations continues to talk about supporting AU troops with its own forces without taking action. Meanwhile, 500 people continue to die every day. 
I want to share why I think it is important to take action on this genocide and on all injustices and hatred in the world. 
We need people to fight injustice because it is those people who have been changing the world for the better throughout history. There's always an alarmist notion that society is going downhill, but the opposite is true. Think of how far our own country has come since our own genocide and the enslavement of our brothers and sisters. Our progress is the direct result of the hard work of millions of dedicated people who refused to give up. 
We need people who triumph over hatred with love. We need individuals with a passion within them that drives them to keep fighting, even though the world may never see a day when hatred doesn't exist. It drives them to keep going when they fail over and over again, when change seems impossible, when the world calls for their crucifixion. 
We can all be one of these people. It requires a conscious decision to strive to love others and ourselves. It requires a commitment to continue fighting hatred with love any way that we can until our death. It takes practice, patience, persistence and sacrifice. There will always be the temptation to give up. It is never easy, but it is always worth it. 
April 6 will mark the 12th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. More than 900,000 people were slaughtered as most of the world looked on and did nothing. The worlc\ needed people to step up-but few did. 
Genocide is happening again, but you can step up.

Arguably the most influential depiction of the Matla in popular culture is direc* tor Francis Ford Coppola's "The GodfathHr" trilogy, based on works by author Mario Puzo. Populated by colorful characters, Coppola's tllmic glimpse at the Corleone crime family -about as close to privileged Mafia royalty as they come -has withstood the test of time and continues to be one of the most revered American lllms ever made.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences apparently agreed, awarding both 6rando and ))e Niro respective act­ingOscars for their efforts -the--only time two actors have won separateOsears for playing the same character. 
"The Sopranos" is replete with loving fei&:t;e:nees to Coppola's classics. Aside · · · (lutirtg.cla.<isic lines from thntrilo*

In that same episode, Tony's crew gathers around a TV set to test out an adVan,ce bootlegged copy of "The Godfather" on DVD. Alas. the DVD shorts out and produces a "no disc" error. This prompts crewmember Paulie Gualtieri to quip, "Somebody should tell Paramount Pictures to get their (stuft1 together. We'tegonna be stealing thousandsmore of these things" -a elHver tongue-in­chffl3k reference to the crew's honest day jobs. 
If. ''The Godfather" glamorized Don Corleone's white collar operation, direc­tor Martin Scorsese took his view of crime directly to street level in "Goodfellas."

Almost a decade later, h0p11rioli repays the favor in a first season episodi~ of "The Sopranos," shooting a bakery clerk in the foot due to1 a perceivfld slight -a dear·cut homag~ to S<:orseStl'S Malia classic. That style of dark humor -prevalent in many of Scorsese's fi.lms. but especially in "Goodftlllas" -is echoed in many "Sopranos" episodes.

Into this lineage stflps "The Sopranos." At once alluring, provocative and dis­turbing, the series represents an evolu­tion of the genre as rnueh as a vivid new interpretation. When Tony says to his nephew, ''Once you're into this family, there's no getting out." he voices his binding avowal to the Malia's past and, present. 
Fortunately for Vito, Michael, Henry' and the rest of their cadre, the future of La Cosa Nostra in the media is assured -it lies in Tony's burly hands, tapering down to tho gun bart·el nestled between; his fingers.

Assistanr Scene Editors 
Tae: Prior to the video game release of "The Godfather," fan speculation about its quality was high -would it do justiee to the film. or was it just a money-making addendum to the film series, in pursuit of the almighty dollar'? After a March 21, 2006 n~lease, tlw final verdiet is out: jus­lien is snrvnd, although thn game is hardly a masterpiece. 
The EA Games' vidno game n~ndition of tlw dassie film follows the precedent set by the Hoekstar Gamns hit series, "Grand Theft Auto." Basnd primarily on the "GTA" format. the player has virtually unlimited fmn reihTJl to explore the city map of 1940s New York. 

llowever, the game's strength lies in il'i storyline missions. Players can name and ernate their own chara!'.ters, then pimp them out with customizable features such as musta!'.hes. li~dora hal<> and line Italian suits. fPerhaps the most hilarious part of' the game is h1mring a college dorm room packed with heterosexual guys arguing the finer points of a created gangster's wardrobe and hearing lines such as. "Piek tlw tan tit~. it goes better with his shoes!") 
The player-crnated character is periph­erally woven into the plot of the film ver­sion of "The (;odfather." For example, when Miehael Corleonn uses a planted pis­tol to knock off some mob leaders in a restaurant, the player is responsible for stashing said assassination weapon. In addition. the lilm 's cut scenes are excel­lent. The pixilated versions of the film's eharaeters are for the most part very good, with the exception of Michael Corleone's video game self. who fails utterly to look or sound like AI Padno. Especially well-ren­dered are the hot-headed Sonny and the Godfather himself. Don Corleone. The vidno game Corleone resembles late actor Marlon Brando down to a T, with that same dead stare, preposterous jowls and r<L<>py mumble.

"The Godfather" video game provides plenty of scintillating car chases, machine gun shootouts and criminal activity for those looking to become Mafia dons. 
While it remains faithful to the film, the game's true fun lies in allowing the player to embrace his or her inner gangster. Tired of being a "button" for the powers-that­be? Feel free to take to the streets and dodge the coppers en route to achieving capo status. Again, like "Grand Theft Auto," 'The Godfather" encourages play­ers to both beat their way down and shoot their way up to the top of the criminal food chain. 
While piloting his or her self-created Slim Shady around town, the player is required to earn his or her dishonest living by shaking down local businesses for their hard-earned cash. Having the freedom to rule with an iron fist quickly goes to the player's head, as he or she hustles, extorts and intimidates the various denizens of New York City. 
Should the locals refuse to comply with diplomacy, do as any true Godfather fan would -simply make them an oft'er they can't refuse. Like Don Corleone, it helps in the game to speak softly but carry a big stick. Or a lead pipe. Or a tommy gun. To rustle up some cash, a veritable armory slash-hardware store is available for use 
as instruments of destruc­

tion. However, if gamers get tired of using the tools

of the trade, they can sim­ply lose the jackets, roll up

Electronic Arts 
innovative fist-fighting sys­tem. Remember, spare the rod, spoil the child. 
~. 
Unfortunately, despite all 
il'> fun, the game has defi­
-'·· 

nite drawbacks. The 
game's playing aesthetic has a knaek for the arcade -after special gangland-style executions, different catchphrases flash on-screen. For example, after whacking a guy with a baseball bat, the player is rewarded with the words "Grand Slam Execution" flashing onscreen. Also, button instructions advising players to "Press Triangle to Extort" and "Press R2 for Execution," while humorous, fail to cap­ture the grave and somber nature of the classic film. 
While the game has good graphics. it recycles the same character models and building interiors over and over again, to the point where wandering around feels like the film "Groundhog Day" -every backdoor gambling ring and back alley hustler on the street looks identical. 
Despite its shortcomings, "The Godfather" video game is a solid enough effort for fans of the film series to reaffirm a lesson worth learning from the film "Office Space" -damn, it feels good to be a gangster. 
Chris: Here's a simple rule: tread with caution when remaking a classic film. Rule number two: be even more careful when remaking said classic film into a video game. However, Electronic Arts does a sin­cerely impressive job ofjust this task in its video game "remake" of "The Godfather." 
Although any avid -or even novice ­"Godfather" fan can tell that the game strays from the plotline of the original film, there are similarities that are poignant and necessary. Don Corleone looks very similar to Marlon Brando and sounds almost exactly like him, the cut scenes are nearly identical to the films in some cases and the general feel of the game is very 
much like the movies. llowever. Electronic 
Arts (EA) did not strive to make a replica 
of the movie, but rather a game based on 
the general premise of the film. While this 
may irk the "Godfather" aficionados, the 
game is still beyond entertaining. 
This game's impressiveness hinges on il<> playability. Rather than follow a linear plot line, the gamer can feel free to roam about the New York/New Jersey area (think of classics like Hockstar's "Grand Theft Auto" series). The player can exhort shop own­ers, shake down back alley rackets and generally cause mayhem on the streets. 
The gamer starts off as a lowly street thug, taken under the wing of the mob. Customized to look however the player desires -from eyebrow intensity to hair color to style of clothing -th1~ fully per­sonalized character makes his way through the hierarchy of the organized crime family, ultimately ascending to the lead role as Don while avoiding police and other gang vendettas. This task requires skill, streets smarl<; and a little bit of luck, but comes together for a fun experience. 
However, the game is not without its faults. Although the map is huge, many of the areas are vague and lack detail. The game would have a more realistic feel if specific landmarks were more recogniza­.ble as aetual places. 
In addition. what is meant to be New York Cty is filled with large areas with nothing in them. While driving from place to place, oftentimes there is nowhere to go but straight. In this sense, the game is a bastard.ized version of "GTA," taking away much of the freedom that was allowed to the gamer. This game would have been served well by spending another six months in development, increasing the variety of the scenery. The game lacks in detail and tries to make up for it in quanti­ty. It doesn't work. 
However, what is unique about this game compared to the slew of other games in the genre, such as "GTA" and "True Crime," is the fact that it was adapted from a previously existing -and beloved ­film. The plot line is more substantial, albeit not as complex as the movie, and provides the gamer with a bit more inter­est in the actual outcome of the story. 
At times over the top, the game is defi­nitely not for those fans of "The Godfather" movie looking for an exact replica. However, the entertainment value is too much to pass up. So don those pinstripes and fedoras and ascend to Mob greatness.

NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 

Associated Press 

BOSTON -Overtime belongs to Maryland. So does the NCAA champi­onship. 
Freshman Kristi Toliver hit a 3-pointer at the end of regulation to cap a 13­point comeback, then made two free throws with 35 seconds left in overtime Tuesday night to give the Terrapins their first NCAA women's bas­ketball title with a 7 8-7 5 victory over Duke. 
Maryland (34-4) is 6-0 in overtime games this season -the first five on the road and the last in the championship to com­plete the second-largest comeback in a women's final. It was the first time the title was determined in overtime since Tennessee beat Virginia in 1991. 
The Maryland players stormed the court twice ­once after Toliver's basket forced overtime and again when Blue Devils guard Jessica Foley's despera­tion, well-covered 3-point attempt nicked the front of the rim at the overtime buzzer. 
Piling up on tbe court, hugging and bumping chests, the Terrapins rev­eled in the youth that had been the biggest doubt surrounding them coming into the tournament. 
"Age is just a number," Maryland coach Brenda Frese said. "When you got kids that believe and they believe in each other and they got that kind of confi­dence, you can accom­plish anything as a team." 
Foley made two free throws with 18 seconds left in regulation to give Duke a 70-67 lead, then Frese called timeout to set up a play. 
Toliver, who had 12 turnovers in the semifinal victory over North Carolina, brought the ball down and veered over to the right before putting through the 3 with 6.1 seconds left and Duke's Alison Bales in her face. 

"And I even felt her fin­gertips as I was holding my follow through," Toliver said. "So, she did a great job contesting. I just had a lot of confidence. And I knew I wanted to take the big shot so I just took it." 
Duke (31-4) opted not to call a timeout; Lindsey Harding brought the ball down the court and put up a desperation leaner from the right baseline that went off the rim. 
After that, the usually frenetic Frese just let her players take over. 
"I didn't have to say a word," Frese said. "They just know that overtime is their time." 
IN BRIEF 

Dodf!ers place Nomar on 15­
day ilisabled list 
LOS ANGELES -The Los Angeles Dodgers placed first baseman Nomar Garciaparra on the 15-day disabled list Monday and recalled James Loney from Triple-A Las Vegas. 
The 21-year-old Loney was in the lineup Tuesday night against Atlanta, batting fifth and playing first. His big league debut, however, was in jeop­ardy because of daylong rain. 
The 32-year-old Garciaparra, signed as a free agent during the off­season, was injured while swinging in his first-at-bat Sunday in the Dodgers' exhibition finale against the Los Angeles Angels in Anaheim. 
When Garciaparra returns he will be playing first base for the first time, having been a shortstop most of his career. 
"I believe it's only going to be a two-week thing," Garciaparra said. "Let's get this right so we can put this behind us." 
Ratings for title f!ame slip 25 
percent from lasfyear 
NEW YORK-The NCAA tourna­ment championship game between Florida and UCLA drew an 11.2 Nielsen rating for CBS Monday. That figure was down 25 percent from last year's final. 
Florida's 73-57 victory over UCLA on Monday at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis was watched by 12.31 million households. Last season, North Carolina beat Illinois in the final and the game drew a 15.0 rat­ing. 
But the Gators and Bruins did slightly better than the 2004 champi­onship game, when Connecticut's vic­tory over Georgia Tech drew an 11.0 rating. 
CBS's 26 tournament telecasts averaged a 6.3 rating-with an average of 6.959 million households watching -down 9 percent from last season (6.9), but up 2 percent from 2004. 
White Sox receive World 
Series rings 
CHICAGO -The Chicago White Sox received their World Series rings Tuesday in a pre-game ceremony, and the loudest ovation went to a player no longer on the team. 
Aaron Rowand, the popular center fielder traded in the offseason to the Philadelphia Phillies for Jim Thome, got a rousing greeting as he walked onto U.S. Cellular Field in a suit and tie to get his ring. 
Rowand waved to the crowd as he approached the area between the mound and plate where commission­er Bud Selig assisted White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Kenny Williams in passing out the rings. 
Rowand got big hugs from Reinsdorf and Williams and then another from World Series MVP Jermaine Dye when he went to the third base line to join his former teammates.

Culpepper cleared of charges 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS -Quarterback Daunte Culpepper was cleared Tuesday of misdemeanor charges stemming from a boat­party sex scandal. 
A judge ruled there wasn't probable cause to determine a crime was committed by Culpepper, one of four Minnesota Vikings accused of misdemeanor lewd conduct dur­ing the cruise last fall on a sub­urban lake. Culpepper has since been traded to the Miami Dolphins last month. 
Culpepper issued a statement through the Dolphins saying he was "delighted" at the ruling. 
"I was confident when the legal process began that the truth would come out, and I am glad that my innocence has been proven," he said. 
Culpepper testified last month that he merely played dice on the cruise. That, plus backing testimony from a friend, was enough to convince a judge to toss out the charges. 
"Since no evidence was pre­sented to refute this testimony, this Court is compelled to find" lack of probable cause, Hennepin County District Judge Kevin Burke ruled. 
"I greatly appreciate Judge Burke's sensitivity to the damage that can be done to a person's reputation when they are wrongly charged," Culpepper said. 
Ilis attorney, Earl Gray, said, "It vindicates him from being involved in any sexual miscon­duct on the boat." 
Prosecutor Steve Tallen said he thought Burke had "applied things wrong," but said he had­n't had time to fully digest the ruling. He said it was possible he might re-flle the case. 
Burke denied a motion to dis­miss charges against running back Moe Williams. His trial is scheduled for April18. 
The other two players charged, cornerback Fred Smoot and tackle Bryant McKinnie, weren't part of Tuesday's ruling. 

Their next hearings were sched­uled for Thursday. 
Williams' attorney, Joe Friedberg, said he was disap­pointed. 
"I disagree with him, but that's what makes horse racing," Friedberg said. 
Both Culpepper and Williams had denied any improper con­duct in a hearing before Burke last month. Culpepper, who was accused of touching a dancer's buttocks, testified that he spent the cruise playing a dice game in the back of a boat and rejected offers from several women.

McNair sent ho111e as contract is rew-orked 
Tennessee Titans owe franchise quarterback $9 million for 2006 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -The Tennessee Titans told Steve McNair they don't want him working out in their building until his contract is reworked, the quarterback's agent said Tuesday. 
McNair was told to go home Monday when he showed up at the team's headquarters for the start of the third week in the Titans' offseason condition­ing program. The team's gen­eral counsel had called agent Bus Cook earlier Monday and informed him McNair would be told to leave. 
A team trainer told the 11­year veteran to leave, Cook said. 
"You tell the guy who's the mainstay of the organization, the leader, to get out, that he's not wanted, that's pretty rough," Cook said. "I don't know what Steve will do or won't do. I imagine he would have a hard time going back over there." 
McNair, the NFL's 2003 co­MVP, is due $9 million in salary in 2006 -but his salary cap number is $23.46 million. 
The Titans declined last month 
to pick up a $50 million option 
to stretch the deal through 
2009, leaving McNair with 
nearly a quarter of their cap 
space. 
"We have no choice but to 
protect the club and its future 
from the possibility of having a 
significant amount of our 
salary cap at risk in a single 
player should he sustain a 
major injury," the team said in 
a statement. "This is entirely a 
risk management problem." 
Cook said the Titans' gener­al counsel told him the team doesn't want McNair working out on team property until his contract is reworked. 
General manager Floyd Reese and coach Jeff Fisher were in Los Angeles following 
·a private workout of Southern California quarterback Matt Leinart. The Titans said in a statement that they look for­ward to McNair returning once his contract is resolved. 
"It was unfortunate the way this played out yesterday, but we think both Steve and Bus understand the team's posi­tion," the Titans said. "Other clubs facing the same dilemma have arrived at the same con­clusion we did." 
McNair is the franchise's 
winningest quarterback with a 
record of 81-59. He started 15 
games in 2005 and threw for 
3,161 yards.

Indians put Sabathia on DL 
Strained right oblique muscle sidelines ace for three to five weeks 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO Cleveland Indians ace lefty C.C. Sabathia was put on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday and is expected to be out three to five weeks with a strained right oblique mus­cle. 
The 6-foot-7, 290-pound Sabathia was hurt in Sunday night's season opener against the Chicago White Sox and had to leave in the third inning after throwing just 37 pitches. His injury is similar to one he had a year ago, when he began the season on the DL after hurting the muscle in spring training. He missed six weeks but still finished 15-10. 
"It's not as bad as it was last year," Sabathia said before Tuesday's game against the White Sox. "It feels good today. I feel zero pain. Last year it hurt for about a week or so. I woke up yesterday and it felt a little sore. Today I feel no pain." 
But Sabathia's absence will likely hurt the Indians, who hoped to get off to a quick start this season in hopes of dethroning the White Sox in the AL Central. 
"It's clearly disappointing and it's also part of the game," Indians general manager Mark Shapiro said. "Part of the abili­ty to be a championship team is how you deal with setbacks during a 162-game season.... It's part of the-deal." 

Indians trainer Lonnie Soloff said Sabathia's weight is not a problem, and Shapiro noted that Sabathia had made at least 30 starts for five straight seasons. It is just Sabathia's second trip to the DL in a major league career that began in 2001. 
"The fact that it has hap­pened back-to-back years is a cause for some concern at a low-level," Soloff said. "But once again, he's a rotational athlete and he generates some pretty intense torque around his front side. His rotational velocities are probably the highest in the game, just from his height and his size. 
"I would say that his size plays into that, not his weight. We are comfortable where he is from a weight standpoint." 
Sabathia said he's been steadfast with his conditioning. He pulled out of pitching for the U.S. team in the World Baseball Classic so he would be ready for the season, another sign of his resolve to be the Indians' No. 1 starter. 
''I'm working hard and doing everything I can to stay on top of that. I have been for the past two years," he said. 
"Conditioning has always been an important part of C.C.'s game, mainly more than most because he's such a big guy," manager Eric Wedge said. "He's been consistent with it and as strong as he's ever been.... As electric as it was other night, he probably tried to reach back and do a little more and tweaked it." 
Soloff said that Sabathia's arm should be ready to respond from the layoff sooner than a year ago because he pitched in spring training. In 2005 he was hurt warming up prior to his first spring start on March 6 and wasn't activated until April 16. 
The Indians called up 6-foot­6 reliever Jason Davis to take Sabathia's roster spot. Cleveland doesn't need a fifth starter until April 15 because of off days so will get by with four starters until then and then find a spot starter. The rest of the rotation is Jake Westbrook, Cliff Lee, Jason Johnson and Paul Byrd. 
Sabathia felt the muscle grab when he delivered a pitch to Tadahito Iguchi in the third inning Sunday. He tried some warmup pitches but had to leave the game after just 2 1/3 innings. 
"I was watching the game in the clubhouse, just watching video and I was throwing the ball harder than I thought I was," he said. "I was going up there trying to throw nice and easy, go 90, 91 and it was more like 93, 94. It was just being pumped up, I guess, because of the circumstances in the game."

NCAA MEN'S lACROSSE 
NCAA president decries Duke 
Behavior of lacrosse team 'inappropriate at best/ Brand said 
Associated Press 

BOSTON -NCAA president Myles Brand said behavior at a Duke men's lacrosse party last month was inappropriate, regardless of whether the alleged assault of an exotic dancer results in criminal charges. 
The dancer. a student at a nearby university, told police she was raped at the party by three men who restrained and choked her as she struggled to free her­self from a bathroom. Investigators have collected DNA evidence from team mem­bers but no charges have been filed. A spokeswoman for North Carolina's attorney general's office said Tuesday the state's crime lab is still analyzing those samples. 
Brand said no assumptions about guilt or innocence should be made before the case runs its course. 
"Nonetheless, the situation that arose was inappropriate at best," he said in Boston, where he is attending the NCAA women's basketball ehampi­onship game. "It is inappropri­ate that we should have any group of young men, let alone those who play on our athletic teams, inviting a stripper, under­age alcohol and that kind of environment." 
Brand's comments were in response to a question during a news conference at which he discussed women's basketball before Duke played Maryland in 
WE'VE GOT THE 



the national championship game. 
lie said the Duke women's team should not be drawn into the discussion over what hap­pened at the lacrosse party. 
"I think the Duke basketball team is a terrific team," Brand said. "I don't think that's in the least bit overshadowed or taken anything away from the womnn. In faet, I think by pushing the women to answer something that they have no role to play, that strikes me as misleading to readers. I know some journalisL<> have done that." 
Brand also said he thought Duke president Riehard Brodhead was eorrect in sus­pending the lacrosse team's sea­son until the university learns more about what happened at the party. The lacrosse team's co-captains have denied that anyone was sexually assaulted or raped at the party. 
''I'm pleased to see they're 
taking strong steps until they gnt to the bottom of it," Brand said of Duke's administration. 
Several campus demonstra­tions have eritieized Duke for not doing enough, but Brand called Brodhead's dedsion "evi­denee that the administration and faculty an~ treating it very seriously and not ignoring it." 
Also Tuesday, the North Carolina ehapter president of the National Ac.;soeiation for the Advaneement of Colornd People said the group plans to keep watch on the investigation and has asknd to meet with thn dis­trict attorney who would prosn­cute any charges. 
"Our position as an organiza­tion whose mission is dvil righlc.; and community justicn is that the investigation of the allnga­tions are fair, meticulous, com­prehensive, aggressive and thor­ough," said the Hev: William Barber II. lie did not immediate­ly rnturn calls Tuesday rlVfming. 
With 3-0 count in last at bat, LaRussa made reliever throw strike 
Associated Press 
PIIILAI>ELPIIIA-Tony La 
Hussa watdwd too many teams 
pitch around Mark MeGwire to 
let it happen to Jimmy Hollins. 
Hollins' hitting streak was on the linn wlwn lw eame to the plate with two ouLc.; in the eighth inning and the Philadelphia Phillies trailing the St. Louis Cardinals 13-5 in Monday's sea­son opnrwr. 
Helinvnr Adam Wainwright's first thrnn pitdws wnre out of the slrikn zorw, and thosn remaining among the Stdlout crowd of 44,614 at Citizens Bank Park booed nach 0110. 
Bnforn the next pitch, La Hussa got catcher Yadier Molina's attention and signalnd for a strikn. The right-handed Wainwright threw a fastball down the middln and Rollins rippt~d it down the right-field line li1r a doubln to nxtlmd his hitting strnak to :u games. 
"You have to play the game. Wn card walk him in that spot," La Hussa said. 
It was the eighth limn during his streak that bt~gan against San Franeiseo last Aug. 2:{ that Hollins kept it going during his last at-bat. lie ought to thank La Bussa for giving him a chanee this time. 
La Hussa was in his third year managing Uw Cardinals in 1998 when McGwire hit 70 homers to break How~r Maris' single-season rneord of 61. It was frustrating for La Hussa to sen MeGwire often get nothing to hit from pitchers, especially in tight games. lin didn't want Hollins' streak to end with a walk when his team had an eight-run lead. 
"Some of that is him, but most­ly it's about us," La Hussa said. "I wouldn't want the St. Louis Cardinals to walk him in his last at-bat. That's not what we reprn­Stmt." 
Hollins went 0-for-3 with a sac­rifice fly before getting his hit. lie hit two hard liners at center linlder Jim Edmonds, grounded out to first base and fouled out his first time up when shortstop David lkkstein made a speetacu­lar, sliding cateh near the railing down the lnl"t-lield line. 
If the score was dose, Hollins probably wouldn't have swung at a 3-0 pitch in the eighth inning. But Wainwright's fastball was too good to pass up down eight runs. 

"If he had thrown a ball and I 
couldn't get to it, I wouldn't have 
swung," Hollins said. 

Phillies manager Charlie 
Manuel had conflicting thoughts 
about Hollins swinging ahead 3-0 
in the count. 

"You usually don't have to give .Jimmy the take sign if we're los­ing the game," Manuel said. "I wanted to see him have every chance. lie got a good ball and hn hit it. But the question will always be there about swinging 3-0." 
Wainwright had no problem challenging Hollins. 
"Obviously a guy who plays as hard as he does and gets a streak going like that, I respect that," Wainwright said. "It's kind of a pitcher's duty if a guy has something going like that to give him a chance at it." 
A three-time All-Star short­stop, Hollins ended the 2005 sea­son with a 36-game hitting streak, the ninth-longest over one snason in big league history, and tlw longest in the majors sin en 11JR7. when Paul Molitor hit safely in 39 consecutive gamns. 
Hollins' pursuit of Joe DiMaggio's major league record 56-game hitting streak has a catch, however. 
DiMaggio accomplished his fnat in the same season in 1941. The major league marks for longest hitting streak in one sea­son and longest hitting streak spanning two seasons are sepa­rate records. 
DiMaggio holds both with his 56-game streak in 1941, but there is a difference in the NL records: Pete Rose (1978) and Willie Keeler (1897) share the NL mark at 44 games. However, Keeler got a hit in his final game of 1896, so his run of 45 games overall is the first record Hollins is chasing. 
The pnwious Phillies franchise record of 31 was set by Ed Delahanty in 1899. 
Hollins is a notoriously slow starter with a .227 batting aver­age in April over the last two years. But he had several good swings against reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Chris Carpenter and relievers Handy Flores and Wainwright in his first game. 
"You don't get rewarded for good swings," Hollins said. "I wasn't worried. As long as my swing is there, I know I'll get a hit somehow." 
Hollins goes for 38 on Wednesday against tough lert­hander Mark Mulder. If he keeps going, Hollins could tie Keeler at 45 next Thursday in Atlanta.

Belles take one of tvvo fro111 Eagles 
Team captures first game 5-2 before dropping nightcap 6-1 
By DIERDRE KRASULA 
Sporrs Writer 
Saint Mary's split a home doubleheader with Hobert Morris Tuesday, winning the first game 5-2 but dropping the second 6-1. 
"Our intensity going into the first game was excellent," Belles head coach Erin Sullivan said. "We were relaxed going into the second. We didn't have enough time to come back." 
Saint Mary's took an early lead in the first game, capital­izing on an error by Hobert Morris shortstop Nichele Hatliff. Sarah Miesle reached second on the miscue and third baseman McKenna Corrigan drove her in with an RBI dou­ble. 
Belles right fielder Calli Davison and center fielder Audrey Gajor made it 3-0 in the third inning with a pair of RBI singles. 
Saint Mary's freshman Kristin Amram strong off the mound in the opener. She struck out 11 and allowed six hits. The win was Amram's seventh of the season. 
"We pulled together at the clutch time," said Amram. "[We hit] when we needed to hit." 
Saint Mary's infielder Megan Marenkovic added an RBI dou­ble in the fourth and Davison scored on a fielding error by Robert Morris second baseman Katelyn Contreras in the fifth to give the Belles a 5-0 lead. 
The Lady Eagles cut into the lead in the sixth when right fielder Jesse Hazim's sacrifice fly and third baseman Jen Long's an RBI single. But that was all Robert Morris could muster, as Amram pitched a perfect seventh to secure the win. 
In the second game, power­ful left-handed pitcher Bethany Toyias kept the Belles in check en route to a 6-1 Robert Morris victory. Toyias struck out 11 from the mound in the com­plete game. Long went 2-for-4, scoring two runs and designat­ed player Shauna Robertson drove in two. 

Miesle knocked in the only run for Saint Mary's in the sixth with an RBI single that scored Davison from second. 
Saint Mary's committed four errors in the loss, and all but one of the five runs Belles sen­ior Bridget Grall surrendered was unearned. 
"We had much better defense in the first [game]," Sullivan said. "We made too many men­tal errors [in the second]." 
Robert Morris jumped ahead in the top of the third of game two when Ratliff and Robertson scored on errors 
Amram said that the Belles were not prepared for the Robert Morris' speed in the nightcap. 
Robert Morris finished off the game in the seventh inning with a four-run barrage to put the game out of reach at the decisive score of 6-1. 
Saint Mary's plays Hope in a home game today at 3:30p.m.

Selig stands by Mitchell decision 
Commissioner defends choice to head baseball steroid investigation 
Associated Press 
CIIICAGO -Commissioner Bud Selig defended his choice of George Mitchell to head base­ball's steroid investigation, saying the former Senate Majority Leader has independ­ence. 
Selig brushed off criticism that Mitchell is too much of an insider for the job -Mitchell is a director of the Boston Red Sox and chairman of The Walt Disney Co., which owns ESPN -a national broadcaster of baseball and the network airing Barry Bonds' new reality show. 
"It's important for somebody who understands what I call the mores of culture of this sport as well as he does. That helps in the investigation. That doesn't hurt it," Selig said Tuesday after helping hand out World Series rings to the Chicago White Sox. 
"He has complete autonomy. He wouldn't have taken this without complete autonomy. I mean the fact that we're friends had nothing to do with it .... He doesn't come back and talk to me. I don't want to hear from him. And he can do whatever he wants with whomever he wants. So I don't know how anybody could have more inde­pendence than Sen. Mitchell," he said. 
The investigation is already under way and has no time limit. It was launched after a book detailing allegations that Bonds, who is approaching Hank Aaron's career home run record, used performance­enhancing drugs for five years starting in 1998. The probe will be limited to events since September 2002, when baseball banned steroids, but Mitchell can expand the investigation if he feels it is necessary. 
"What I said to Sen. Mitchell was that, 'Look, we've done now everything we can do.' We have the toughest program in American sports. We've banned amphetamines, which I think a lot of people don't understand the significance of that," Selig said. 
"And while the book trig­gered, as I said last week, some of this because of the specificity of things, I think it's fair -and I've thought a lot about it since -that we've taken care of the present, we've taken care of the future and now I think it's important to look at the past," he added. "We'll see what hap­pens.... There's no sense in me speculating." 

Selig emphasized that Mitchell was not looking into just Bonds. He's looking at the entire game. 
"For anybody who thinks this is just a singular investigation is just wrong," Selig said. "It's incorrect. I don't know how much clearer I can be." 
Selig was saddened by the fans' response to Bonds in San Diego on Monday night, when a syringe was tossed in the direc­tion of the Giants' left fielder. 
"I guess none of this is unex­pected. I'm saddened by it in the sense that Opening Day was such a good, positive day," Selig said. "Every game was sold out. It was really a great baseball day. But controversy will spawn with that type of activity, whether I like it or not." 
Bonds began the season with 708 homers and trails only Babe Ruth (714) and Aaron 
(755) on the career list. Selig said baseball currently has not made plans for a celebration should Bonds move past Ruth's mark but could do so in coming weeks. 
NHL 

Rangers put end to drought in win 
3-2 shootout victory clinches first playoff bid since 1997 season 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK-Kevin Weekes was still holding court with a small group of reporters in the New York Hangers dressing room when a friendly face stopped by to congratulate him. 

Henrik Lundqvist, the rookie who wrested the Rangers No. 1 goalie position away from Weekes, was all smiles after New York's 3-2 shootout victory over the Philadelphia Flyers lift­ed the Rangers into the playoffs for the first time since 1997. 
Michael Nylander scored in regulation and the shootout, and Martin Straka added a goal for the Rangers, who are three points ahead of the Flyers with each team having seven games left. 
"This isn't the only goal we have, but it's certainly part of it," general manager Glen Sather said. 
Once the Rangers got into overtime, the NHL's longest active playoff drought ended. But New York, a club some picked to finish last in the 30­team league, isn't content with just reaching the postseason. The Rangers are gunning for the division title, too. 
"We're speaking kind of casu­ally now that we did clinch a playoff berth, but when you stop and think about what that means and how that looked in August and how that looked in September ... to now be in this position it's very gratifying," Weekes said. 
Usually it is Lundqvist who is tucked in the corner of the dressing room after a Hangers win. But his sore hip put him into a suit instead of the net on this night, and left New York's biggest game of the season in the hands of Weekes-who has become a bit of a villain to the home fans who want to see Lundqvist play. 
Boos rained on Weekes when New York's 1-0 lead turned into a 2-1 deficit by the end of the second period. But he held his ground in the third, made sev­eral key saves -including breakaway stops -and heard his name cheered. 
"The fans have supported our team all year long and fallen in love with some of our players, certainly my partner Henrik, and that's fine," said Weekes, who earned his first home victo­ry since Nov. 19.

Middle School MVPs 21, Team 183 9 
Middle School MVPs topped Team 183 21-9 at the Bookstore courts Tuesday in a game much closer than the final seore indi­eates. 
The contest was a hard-fought battle between two teams com­prised entirely of women that saw countless dives for loose balls. Players on both teams said the intensity level was higher than expected. 

"There was definitely a lot of aggressive play," MVP senior Erika Gurrola said. 
Members of Team 183 said the high-contact game resulted in many abrasions and bruises on their teammates. 
"We knew that Bookstore 
so brutal," Team 183 sophomore forward Meghan Paladino said. All five members of Middle School MVPs are seniors. 
"We knew we could take on a bunch of sophomores," MVP Liz Berry said. 
Berry said the win was impor­tant to legitimize the team's name. 
"Middle school was the last time we were legit," she said. "Until now." 
We're Big in Europe 21, Team UBS 17 
We're Big in Europe defeated Team UBS -Build Up Your Assets 21-1 7 at the Bookstore courts yesterday in a game that remained close throughout. 
"We're definitely lucky to have won," We're Big player Patrick Starr said. 
We're Big led 19-13 but Team UBS, which was composed entirely of female players, fought back to cut the delkit to 19-17. But to the dismay of a vociferous crowd, We're Big thwarted the Team UBS come­back attempt. 
"It was a pretty tough loss," UBS freshman guard Alison Heyden said. 
Meanwhile, members of the round. 
"We faced some good players today," We're Big point guard Andrew "Conan" Digan said. "They definitely gave us a run for our money." 
Digan said the two teams were evenly matched in terms of bas­ketball talent. 
His teammate, Tim "Let's Get Physical" Harmon, said the squad is looking forward to its next game, a contest Saturday against Coogle Maps Are the Best, True That, Double True. Harmon said his team must improve upon its performance in the first contest. 
"We have to rebound a lot bet­ter than we did," !Iarmon said, referring to the physical play of Team UBS' players in the paint. 
Despite not advancing to the second round of the open tour­nament, Team UBS will play again. 
"We still get to play in the women's tournament, so we're not that upset." Hayden said. "This was a very good warm-up for us."

1 after sweeping the doubles matches and earning three wins in singles. Irish junior Christian Thompson attributed the victory to the collective efforts of the team. 
"The strength of our team comes from the depths of our hearts," Thompson said. "And it's only going to get stronger as we get closer to the NCAA !Tournament)." 
The nationally ranked No. 3 doubles pairing of Thompson and Irish junior Catrina Thompson downed Purdue's Brooke Beier and Mallory Voelker 8-2 at No. 1 Sunday. The Thompsons were followed by the Notre Dame's No. 29 pair of Buck and Kelcy Tefft, who defeated Randi Schuler and Stephanie Wooten 8-4 at No. 2. The final doubles win came from seniors Lauren Connelly and Kiki Stastny when they beat Anna Dzeva and Brittany Minna 8-4 at No.3. 
Notre Dame is determined in continuing their flawless streak this season of earning the dou­bles point against Northwestern. 
"We feel secure as we should [win the point against Northwestern]. but we shouldn't be overconfident because they have good doubles [teams] too," Buck said. "Everyone is going to have to play well tomorrow, and I have full confidence we will." 
The Irish have failed to secure the victory just once this season in singles -a 4-3 loss to Vanderbilt March 29. Notre Dame is hoping not to repeat that loss. 
"We lost and it was a tough match, but it wasn't like we weren't fighting until the last point, and our coaches realize that," Buck said. "That day, Vanderbilt was a better team than we were. I think it was good for us, because we hopefully learned form it and use it to play well against Northwestern."

powered offense will contin­ue to produce against Ohio State. The Irish have already surpassed last year's season total of goals scored (145) with 158 goals in 10 games for an average of 
15.8 per game , good for second in 
the  na­ 
tion.  
But  Footethe  
Irish  are  

looking to continue to mount offensive attacks. 
Notre Dame freshman Jill Byers enters today's game five goals shy of the single­season Irish record for a freshman. Her 33 goals and 45 points are second on the team this year only to senior attack Crysti Foote. 

Foote, who was named Big East play.er of the week for the third time this year Tuesday, has 41 goals and 20 assists. 
Despite an overall losing record, the Irish have faired well against Ohio State recently. Notre Dame has won three out of its last four games against Ohio State. In 2002, Notre Dame's first NCAA Tournament appear­ance in program history, the Irish were defeated by Ohio State in regular season play before beating the Buckeyes in their post-season run. 
Ohio State dropped its first eight games of the season before beating Davidson 16­5 at home Sunday. 
Buckeyes senior midfielder KC Carter and sophomore attack Jessica Patane lead the Ohio State offense with 21 and 17 points, respective­ly. 
Ohio State sophomore attack Kristen Slahor is the team's most efficient threat 

in the starting lineup. Slahor has eight goals on 15 shots and has added seven assists in nine games. 
Buckeyes freshman Kristen Gilwee leads Ohio State in the net with a 10.34 goals against average. 
In the next few weeks, the Irish face a gauntlet of tough opponents. Duke, Georgetown, Vanderbilt and Syracuse are all ranked and noble opponents to the resurgent Notre Dame squad. 
Notre Dame and Duke clash Sunday at 1 p.m. at Koskinen Stadium in Durham, N.C. 
Georgetown hosts the Irish April 15 in Washington, -. D.C., and Notre Dame ends its regular season at home against Vanderbilt May 7.

"He just hasn't gotten on the mound enough times," Mainieri said of Weiland. "So we were definitely going to throw Weiland today no mat­ter what, and we want to see if he can bounce back again tomorrow and pitch an inning against Ball State." 
The Irish head back into action today against Ball State at 5:05 p.m. at Frank Eck Stadium. 
Notes 
+ 
The Kohn breaking ball that hit Rizzo in the second inning was the 75th time the catcher has been hit by a pitch in his Notre Dame career. That vaulted him into sole posses­sion of third place in the all­time NCAA career hit-by-pitch tally, surpassing Texas' Jeff Ontiveros (74). Gabe Somaribba of Florida Atlantic holds second place (81) and San Francisco's Tony Hurtado is the career leader (92). 

"They try to jam him some­times and he doesn't back down," Mainieri said of Rizzo's record. "He just takes it for the team. Believe me, I don't encourage him to do it-I don't even like him to do it ­but it's just one of those parts of the game. Thank goodness he doesn't get hurt."

Notre Dame starter Wade Korpi and Cooper were named to the Big East Weekly Honor Roll this week. Korpi pitched a three-hit, 11 strikeout, com­plete game shutout of Western Michigan on Mar. 29 to earn recognition. Cooper hit .529 with a home run, two doubles and three HBis in five games last week.

Shutouts 
continued from page 32 
"Heather's ehangeup was on fire and Brittney's curve was menacing." 
The pitching staff's domi­nance was especially impor­tant in Tuesday's doublehead­er since the offense could muster just three runs on ten total hits in both games. 
The Eagles pitching shut down Notre Dame's hitters, and the Irish drew no walks in the first game and two in the second. 
"I don't think we really lacked offensive production today, the hits just weren't going where we needed them to go," Irish center fielder Alexandra Kotcheff said. 
But when the hits did land where the Irish needed them, good things happened for Notre Dame. 
In the first game, Irish sec­ond baseman Katie Laing led off the bottom of the second with a triple to the wall in cen­ter field. Notre Dame shortstop Sara Schoonaert drove in Laing for the team's first run with a ground ball to second. 
With two outs in the fourth, Irish first baseman Linda Kohan knocked a 1-2 pitch to the gap in right for a double. Notre Dame designated player Erin Glasco then stepped up and drove a ball over the head of Eagles centerfielder 

Heather Giroux for  an  HBI  
double  and  insurance  run  
Booth wouldn't need.  

The biggest hit of the second game came in the bottom of the sixth inning with neither team on the scoreboard. Kotcheff led off the inning with a double to center and then moved over to third on a sacri­fice bunt by Irish senior cateh­er Mallorie Lenn. Notre Dame third baseman Meagan Ruthrauff then stepped up and drove in Kotehef'f for the win­ning run. 
Huthrauff, who was 2-for-3 in the game before Sarah Smith pineh ran for her, said the Irish lacked a certain intensity on offense. 
"We had some intensity, but we could bring a lot more," Ruthrauff said. "If we would have done that, we would have been able to score a lot more runs." 
With slim leads in each game, the defense stepped up to provide Booth and Bargar with support. Notre Dame's infield played well, preventing potential hits from getting through the infield. 
"We had very solid defense today," RuthrauiT said. "Laing in particular was flawless, showing her range not only to the hole but also to her left." 
The outfield also showed its range, not allowing an extra­base hit. 
The sweep of Eastern Michigan was the Irish's eighth and ninth consecutive wins, during which they have allowed only three runs to opposing hitters -ineluding three consecutive shutouts and two no-hitters. 
Notre Dame next faces Akron today at 4 p.m. at Ivy Field. 
The Zips (11-14) are lead by freshman outfielder Cali Stratton. who enters the con­test with a .295 batting aver­age, one homer and seven HBis. Akron freshman pitcher Julie Boyes is batting .284 with one home run and nine RBis. 
Gumpf feels the Irish can beat Akron. 
"We definitely have to piek it up-a notch," Gumpf said. "They'll bring it and we have to be ready."

Irish and Bucks to tangle in Ohio 
No. 10 Notre Dame faces OSU today before traveling to No. 4 Duke

"It kind of sets a tone for the game that you've got an aggressive team that's going to attack the opposition." 
Notre Dame freshman Brett Graffy earned his first career win after 5 1-3 innings of work in relief of lefty starter David Gruener. 
Graffy entered the game in the top of the third with two outs and runners on first and second as Notre Dame held to a 4-3 lead. He allowed one run in the relief appearance. 
Graffy worked out of the jam by forcing Cougar left fielder Chris Freshour to fly out to Notre Dame right fielder Danny Dressman. 
Mainieri originally planned to pitch Gruener for three innings and give Graffy the same work­load before going to David

Booth and Bargar shoot down Eagles 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
Notre Dame starting pitchers Heather Booth and Brittney Bargar led the Irish to two shutout victories Tuesday as Notre Dame swept a double­header against the Eastern Michigan Eagles with 2-0 and 1-0 wins at Ivy Field. 
Booth and Bargar each pitched complete game gems, combining for seventeen strikeouts while giving up only seven hits in the two shutouts. 
Booth was able to work all her pitches in the first game ­forcing hitters to chase after her fastball while fooling them with the changeup. Bargar dominated the Eagles lineup in game two, striking out 11 bat­ters with her overpowering fastball and baffling curve. 
"[Booth and Bargar} showed up more than anybody else tonight," Irish head coach Deanna Gumpf said.
