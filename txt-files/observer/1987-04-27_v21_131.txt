Swartz appointed adviser of undergraduate academics 
By DIANE SCHROEDER 
Copy Editor 
Undergraduates enrolled in the College of Arts and Letters at Notre Dame will have access to more specialized advising as a result of the recent appoint­ment of Professor Thomas Swartz as College Fellow, ac­cording to the College's dean, Michael Loux. 
Swartz, an economics profes­sor, will be responsible for en­hancing the quality of under­graduate academic advising in the University's largest col­lege. According to Loux, the College Fellow's office will sup­plement the current advisory program of the assistant deans of the College. 
"The assistant deans handle the formal advising of under­graduates very well," he said. "They do an excellent job with the routine advising such as helping students with registra­tion. The College Fellow's of­fice will supplement their work, to facilitate the flow of information to students so that they can find a good academic fit for their interests." 
Swartz believes the College Fellow can also send a signal to faculty: excellent work with

Progra01 honors Hesburgh 
By GREG LUCAS Senior Staff Reporter 
"Citizen training has fallen into a sad state of disrepair," said David Leege, professor of government and interna­tional studies at Notre Dame, adding, "It's our task to help people understand the func­tioning of a democracy." 
Leege has been named the first director of the Hesburgh Program in Public Service, according to Michael Loux, dean of the College of Arts and Letters. 
The Hesburgh Program, named to honor the retiring University President Father Theodore Hesburgh, is a con­centration designed to com­plement a variety of majors, Leege said. 
"The program certainly represeJIIts a marriage of fac­ulty interest and a beacon of someone who we all emulate for his contribution to public life in this country," he said. 
Hesburgh, who has served on 14 presidential commis­sions, said he was honored to have the program named after him. "I think presidents of universities have to do things that many don't do. I think you have to be clear on the great moral issues of the time" said Hesburgh. 
The new program will be funded by a $300,000 grant from the Exxon Education Foundation, said Leege. He said the proposal was con­sructed and submitted by Nathan Hatch, associate dean of the College of Arts and Let­ters. 
"Exxon has always been very good to us," Hesburgh said, adding that his col­league, Robert Payton, pres­ident of the Exxon Education Foundation, was largely re­sponsible for the grant. "It's nice to have an old friend do

Involventent with Druids reveals conforntist attitude on cantpus 
It was a dark and medium-stormy night. The fifteen mile-an-hour winds blew the 
Mark
matches out four times before we got the torches going. The sacrifice for the night's Mclaughlinceremonies, the Spirit of Winter, was ap­parently trying to thwart us by kicking up some 


wind for our journey across the sea (Saint l~iiiiiifii~i--~J;-iiii[
Mary's Lake, actually). But we overcame. ~ 
The journey across the sea was a nightmare beyond all proportion. As we made our way across the lake, a sea serpent (no, not a duck) reached up and snapped our magical fishing line, our only link to safety on the shore. "Druids adrift!" was the cry heard at Holy Cross and at Old College, our scheduled landing point. We were forced to douse the torches for fear of creating flaming Druids -not the kind of publicity An Tostal needs. But we overcame. 
We poor stranded Druids used the litter bearing the Spirit of Winter to make a sail, and we made our way towards Carroll Hall. Some­time during all the excitement, the wind snatched up the Spirit and carried it into oblivion. That wasn't supposed to happen until we got to Stonehenge, but wind and Spirits made of helium are unpredictable at best. But we overcame. 
We rejoined our bretheren on Main Quad after an exhausting run across campus. They re­ported an aerial attack with water-bearing mis­siles in the vicinity of Dillon. They also were having problems with the torches, but the water we had brought along "just in case" helped to keep things under control. Sorin wasn't overly friendly. Neither was St. Ed's. But we over­came. 
And so we marched down North Quad, as we had last month, as we had last year, with voices loud and spirits high and a small crowd gath­ered to see what idiocy we would pull off this year. A nice crowd, considering the weather (cold and damp) and the anti-Druid sentiment voiced in certain quarters. Unfortunately, our sacrifice had been stolen by the wind, and with it most of our ceremony. We made up things as we went along. It worked out all right, I think. At least we told everyone all about An Tostal, which was the point all along. 
What amazed me about the Druids this year was the negative feedback we got all along. That wasn't as easy to overcome. Sure, some of it was just friends giving me a hard time. And some of it was probably deserved, espe­cially with the overkill in the Personals section. But come on, the point of all this is An Tostal awareness. What's wrong with that? If the Of­fice of Student Activities hasn't censored it (which they didn't, to their credit), then I doubt people find it morally objectionable. 

No, the reason that Druids get water balloons thrown at them and rather obscene threats shouted through windows is because they have broken the Eleventh Commandment at Notre Dame: 
11 J Thou shalt conform 

This unwritten law seems to be a integral part of Notre Dame life. Look at how many guys own blue blazers and unfailingly wear them to every semi-formal they attend. Look at the percentage of campus students who go to football games, and compare that with the number that follow football. 
We don't enforce conformity at this school? Ask a homosexual. Ask a minority student. Ask a woman. Even ask a Druid. 
Seems kind of hypocritical for us to do that here, this being a Catholic community and all. Typical, but hypocritical. Jesus said "love thy neighbor," not "love thy neighbor only if he does the same things that thou doest, and ridicule him if he does not." 
The Druids are not out there to convert every­one else into burning torches and hanging around the Peace Memorial. Women on this campus don't ask guys to start wearing makeup or quit their drinking. Homosexuals don't ask heterosexuals to stop dating and getting married. 
Give different people the same respect they give you.

former Soviet Maj. Gen. E. P. Sirukov. But an agreement on intermediate-range missiles in Europe rests on an agreement on defensive weapons such as SDI, he said. 
Sirukov said the develop­ment of defensive weapons in space would lead to offensive weapons in space. "Any weapon has the pontential for improvement," he said. He said technology already exists for the development of space to space missiles. "That is why space-based weapons is closely connected to weapons in Europe," he said. 
However, the U.S. must resolve political differences before progress can be made on weapons reduction. Ambas­sador David Aaron, who was a member of the SALT I negotia­tions, said the U.S. has prob­lems with the Soviet occupation of Afganistan, human rights vi­olations in the Soviet Union and Soviet dealings in the Middle East. Aaron said Carter's SALT II failed largely because "opponents of arms control could read through a litany of political problems with the So­viet Union." 
Milshtein said his country has political problems with the 
U.S. as well. He cited Qrenada and Nicaraugua as examples. Of President Reagan's deci­sion to no longer abide by SALT II limits, former" Ambassador Ralph Earl, who negotiated that treaty, said, "I would have maintained SALT limits." He said the reason for "dumping it" was that it was fatally flawed by limits which were too high. But Earl said, "SALT II did establish a basis for reductions in SBLMs (submarine launched missiles) and ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic mis­siles) . ''. Other agreements 
could be worked out from SALT II, he said.

Among other recommen­dations, the panel called for all nations to begin planning for the switch to renewable sources of energy and "the highest priority" for research on alternatives to nuclear power. 
The commission was asked by the United Nations in 1984 to examine critical environ­mental and developmental is­sues and propose strategies for dealing with them. Its report was scheduled to be released Monday in London and Wash­ington.

A story Friday incorrectly reported the deadline for en­tering the lottery for addi­tional commencement tick­ets. The deadline is today at 4:30. 
The panel, whose U.S. repre­sentative was former Environ­mental Protection Agency ad­ministrator William Ruckelshaus, held hearings on five continents. 
"Our report ... is not a predic­tion of ever-increasing environ­mental decay, poverty and hardship in an ever-more pol­luted world among ever­decreasing resources. We see instead the possibility for a new era of economic growth ... ab­solutely essential to relieve the great poverty that is deepening in much of the developing world." 
Its hope "is conditioned on decisive political action now to begin managing environmen­tal resources to ensure both sustainable human progress and human survival," the com­mission said. 
"The commission believes that widespread poverty is no longer inevitable." The report advocates a strategy of "sus­tainable development" for all nations, rich and poor alike.

Protests at Chernobyl 
Associated Press 
Protesters gathered Sunday outside nuclear power plants to mark the first anniversary of the Soviet nuclear reactor dis­aster at Chernobyl that killed 31 people and contaminated wide areas. At least 27 people were arrested. 
"Chernobyl made crystal clear the threat to our lives coming from every nuclear power plant," said Wes Croc­heron of the Clamshell Al­liance, an umbrella organiza­tion for anti-nuclear groups in New England. 
About 300 demonstrators at the finished but still-closed Seabrook plant in New Hampshire observed 30 minutes of silence, a protest of Ohio's Perry nuclear plant east of Cleveland drew 300 people, about a dozen people demon­strated at Maine Yankee, and, near Monroe, Mich., about 15 people chanted, "Shut it down," outside the Fermi II plant, shut down since an April 12 steam leak. 
In San Luis Obispo, Calif., 16 people were arrested for trespassing at Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant as they stepped across the property line and sat down at the gate. 
Some 300 other demonstrators, many wearing buttons stating "Remember Chernobyl, It Can Happen Here," cheered as each person was led away. 
Eleven protesters who tried to scale the fence around Wash­ington's Hanford nuclear reservation also were arrested. 
In Chicago, about 80 activists held a memorial service for Chernobyl victims at the site on the University of Chicago campus where physicist En­rico Fermi and his colleagues succeeded in producing the first controlled chain reaction Dec. 2, 1942. 
Chicago Mayor 1 Harold Washington declared Sunday to be Radiation Awareness Day and urged people "to remem­ber the tragedy in the Soviet Union is our tragedy as human beings and a warning to all nu­clear power and weapons pro­ducers." 
In Richland, Wash., about 200 peopple demonstrated near the Hanford nuclear reservation, calling for permanent shut­down of the reservation's N re­actor, which produces plutonium and shares several key design features with the re­actor that blew up in a steam explosion and caught fire at Chernobyl. 
They also called for a com­prehensive cleanup of defense wastes buried at Hanford. 
About 250 members of the Hanford Family, a pro-nuclear activist group composed mostly of Hanford employees, held a counter-rally a few hundred feet away. 
Later, some of the anti­nuclear demonstrators drove to the border of the reservation, and 11 were arrested when they climbed over a fence. The De­partment of Energy had earlier warned that anyone crossing the fence would face trespass­ing charges.

PLO reunites, but peace rentote 
Associated Press 
ALGIERS, Algeria -The Palestinians' "parliament-in­exile" ended a stormy session Sunday with the PLO reunited under Yasser Arafat, but with a Middle East peace settlement looking more remote than ever. 
For the first time since they split four years ago, Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and his leading Marxist rivals, N ayef Hawatmeh and George Habash, appeared hand-in­hand and smiling as the 18th meeting of the Palestine Na­tional Council came to a close amid prolonged applause. 

But the bitter dissension be­tween hardliners and Arafat­led moderates that was aired during the five-day session sug­gested the PLO's new-found unity is fragile and subject to constant upheaval. 
Arafat once again survived concerted efforts by Syria's President Hafez Assad and Syrian-led radicals to oust him, but he paid a heavy price, bowing to demands that he abandon his relationship with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. 
An earlier, informal agree­ment would have allowed Arafat to maintain his relation­ship with Mubarak in violation

of an Arab boycott imposed after Egypt signed a 1979 peace agreement with Israel. 
In exchange, Arafat had agreed to drop all attempts to negotiate a future peace settle­ment under a Jordanian umbrella. 
Apparently with strong back­ing from Syria and the host government, Algeria, Hawat­meh and Habash on Saturday abruptly upped the ante: to maintain the PLO's new-found unity, Arafat would have to ac­cept a Palestine National Coun­cil command to abandon his re­lationship with Egypt.

Students also reported prob­
lems during Thursday's check­
mark registration with crowds 
at the theology table. 

Before Friday's checkmark registration, a group of Keenan students arrived at midnight and took up positions between the two sets of glass doors at the entrance to Stepan, accor­ding to the students. They said they "controlled" the doors to prevent anyone from entering early because they said they had encountered problems the year before. 

"We tried to keep it a little more organized than last year," Traubert said. 
Traubert said he entered Stepan and walked from table to table, making sure all the registration workers were ready. He returned to the en­trance and signaled for his friends to open the doors. 
Hardiman said the students planned to open all four doors simultaneously, but they could only open one door of each pair. He was then pressed by the sur­ging crowd into one of the un­opened doors, he said. 
Students also said the only exit from the philosophy table at times was to crawl under the table. They added that the sur­ging crowd upset the table at one point.

Homosexuals explain their discovery 
Editor's Note: The following is the first in a three part series dealing with homosexuality. The colums were writ­ten by Jenifer Naughton and four anonymous members of the communi­ty. 
"I'm gay." 
These two very brave and difficult words can change everything. They can alienate friends, disappoint parents or provoke the wrath of bullies. They can also be a .strange, welcome sigh of relief.

guest column 

Christopher is twenty one. He has al­ways known that he is gay. He did not always understand it, and he certainly did not always like it, but he has always known. 
"Ever since I was very young, it was like, 'Well, girls are nice, but there's something for these guys.' From a very young age, there was a tension that I couldn't plug into at the time because I wasn't old enough to understand the feeling." 
The easiest way to deal with tensions like that ("even when you're at an all­male school") is to repress them. "You still look and think, 'That guy's really cute,' but you can never say it because it's wrong, the church says it's wrong and society says it's wrong.." 
Until very recently, homosexuality was regarded as an unnatural, sinful 
Economics department also considers values 
Dear Editor: 
Recently, Christopher Ryan, in a guest column in The Observer, raised a number of questions concerning the quality of graduate programs at Notre Dame. I am writing because both his article and several recent responses to it in your letters section make a number of assumptions which I am afraid prej­udice the entire exchange.

disease. We now know, through scien­tific research, that it is a natural ori­entation for probably ten percent of the population. This means that between seven-and eight-hundred students here are silently wondering whether they are gay, and what it would mean to say 
so. 
Steve is a junior. For the longest time, he 'didn't know much about homosexuality. "I knew I was, in the back of my mind, but -1 didn't know anything about it. I think it would have helped if I had learned a lot earlier what it is." 
When Steve and Christopher were growing up, people did not talk about homosexuality. Not with respect; not without joking. So they kept their feelings quiet, and they wondered what was wrong. 
"After a while," Chris explains, "the little seed you put down there starts to grow, and you try to smash it down. It doesn't work. Because it's you, and you have to grow. If you don't want that part of you to grow, the rest of you won't grow. And then you end up fighting it one more time." 
"I remember walking around the woods, basically telling God what I thought. It was like, 'You've done this to me. I don't know what it means, and no one likes it, and if everyone is so against it, how can it be good?" 
"How can I be good?" 
Chris met someone during his fresh­man year. They started talking and spending a lot of time together. They noticed a tension that they could not quite understand, until they talked some more. Something occurred. 

They realized that they loved each other, "and not just physically." They tried to keep it secret. They even stopped eating dinner together, but the relationship was discovered. 
"It was not a pretty sight. I almost committed suicide." · 
Despair is common. So are drugs and alcohol. "Is it because we're deviant? No. It's because we have a society that says, "You are unnatural, you're wrong, you're a pariah. Go to hell." 
Richard is a priest. He does not have any immediate queston of what to do with his sexuality since he is celibate. But he says, "If I were a nineteen-year­old undergraduate here who had just realized I was gay and wanted to figure out what to do with my sexuality for the rest of my life, I would want more than anything to be able to talk to other people who were gay, who had already been through that experience and had made some intelligent choices. 
"Not so they could tell me what to do, but so I could have some intelligent guideposts." 
When Steve decided that it was time to talk to somebody, he contacted the campus organization, Gays and Les­bians at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. He did not feel comfortable going to a priest. "Just knowing how some priests feel about it, I would have been scared. Even though the church says that it ac­cepts people who are gay, that it just doesn't condone that lifestyle, the im­pression I get is that it doesn't accept us. 
"So I felt I had to contact the group, 
P.O. Box Q 
Ryan, in arguing for the mediocrity of our graduate programs, takes only one department, economics, into ac­count. He notes that based on the num­ber of articles the Notre Dame econom­ics department has published in four select journals, it ranks very poorly. In response, it should be noted, and I am 
sure that this is well known to economists both here and elsewhere, that these journals all share an ex­tremely quantitative approach to this social study. In their approach they at 
least implicity view economics

The Notre Dame department on the other hand, has made a special effort to reflect the special nature of Notre Dame by stress­ing work that is concerned with issues of developmeQt in such a way that dis­cussion of values cannot be avoided. All Ryan shows with his statistics is that Notre Dame economics has made a spe­cial effort to keep their st\ldY human, to avoid the fads of an economics es­tablishment that seeks to mechanize and quantify their study. What Ryan seeks as a criticism of the economics graduate program should, I believe, be

and I'm glad I did. Before, I was con­stantly angry with myself. I was afraid to deal with it. I thought that somehow there was something wrong with me." 
Steve tried dating a girl. So did Chris. It's what he calls his "straight phase." He tried to convince himself that it would work, but the entire time they were dating, he was still checking out guys. "I realized it's not something to be cured. After a period of searching, really looking inside myself, I found out that this is just a part of me. 
"I tried everything to get away from it, but it was like, 'It's not running. It's not letting you chase it.' I wanted it out. But it decided to stay, so I decided, 'Yeah, you're a nice welcome person in my house."' 
Chris told his closest friend, and she listened. Steve told his girlfriend. Tel­ling a roommate, a parent or a friend can be terrifying. What if they hate me? Sometimes people aren't ready to hear that a friend is gay. Sometimes they are. Homosexuality remains abstract and anonymous until somebody says, "I'm gay." Then, we are obliged to respond to the person, either with com­passion or utter rejection. 
Every person Christopher has told personally has reacted positively. "I have never had a negative reaction. I've been very lucky in that regard. They might not understand, but they say, 'It's fine.' They say, 'We loved you before we ever knew. This shouldn't make any difference.'"

viewed as something positive. 
In remaining true to our special con­cerns, it is no accident that in some cases the secular world will view our work here with scorn. But if these con­cerns are worthwhile, which in the case of our economics department I am sure is the case, the chastisement of faddish and misguided (e.g. can economics really avoid questions of morality?) power cliques means very little.

" If you are willing to accept mediocrity from yourself or those around you, even part of the time, people will flnd it easy to live down to your expectations. If, however, you set your expectations high, you will continually be surprised at the many ways in which those around you strive for and achieve that which they

R
eading is fundamental, as the saying goes, but for one out of three adults in America, the ability to read is viewed as a next to impossible dream. 
As a nation, the United States ranks only 49th on the list of the world's most literate countries. This translates into millions of our own citizens unable to read a road sign, unable to fill out a job applica­tion, and unable to read a bed­time story to their own children. Here in South Bend, however, there is a program dedicated to changing these sad statistics. Because of the efforts of a few concerned indi­viduals, some adults, previ­ously ignored and neglected by society, are now learning how to read. 
Located at I 007 West Colfax Avenue, the Center for Basic Learning Skills provides free tutoring for illiterate adults of the South Bend area. The Cen­ter, which has operated there for close to two years, is di­rected by two enthusiastic Fran­ciscan nuns, Sisters Evodine McGrath and Marita Stoffel. Prior to the opening of the Center, the Sisters ran a similar program for children called the Primary Day School. The Sisters are currently assisted by a few area volunteers but mainly by 38 Notre Dame stu­dents. 
"We are working with func­tionally illiterate people, mainly to help them get better jobs," explained McGrath, "but, in some cases, it's just a matter of personal enrichment for the 
individual." 
McGrath said the reading abilities of the people at the Center range from those who are "positively illiterate" to 
some who are "actually high r school graduates, but read at 
r 
an elementary level." 
"We have dozens of them like this," added Stoffel, "with high school diplomas, yet still at a second or third grade reading level. We've had athletes--star athletes--who couldn't read a fourth grade text book. One had scholarship offers from four different uni­versities, Including Indiana and Purdue." 
fights for justice 
"Some of our students are 
pretty far along," continued 
McGrath. "They simply want to 
pass the OED (high school 
equivalency exam) in order to 
get a job, or, in some cases, to 
keep the ones they have." 
When asked about the role of 
the Notre Dame volunteers, 
McGrath remarked, "The volun­
teers from Notre Dame are 
very, very helpful. There is 
such a nice rapport, a nice re­
lationship between our stu­
dents and those from Notre 
Dame. It's just great, and I 
think all of us are profiting by 
it." 
There are also other volun­teer tutors from around the community who routinely take part in the daily sessions. Mrs. Jean O'Meara, wife of University provost Dr. Timothy O'Meara, is very active at the Center. "She has just been wonderful," said McGrath. "She's here every day." 
Tutors at the Center concen­trate on the basics, "the three r's " says Stoffel, unless the student expresses the desire to do something additional or has a special goal which he or she would like to pursue. 
One of the more advanced students eventually wants to pursue a career in therapy, but first needs to finish three high school courses. 
Another student, Addie, a 75-year-old woman, wants to learn how to read the Bible. "I just want to learn so bad," said Addie, "but I waited too late to do it!" 
At this,· Stoffel immediately exclaimed, "It's never too late, Addie! It's not too late if you're 85!" 
Notre Dame volunteer Chris­topher Zenk, a sophomore from Butler, Indiana, has been involved with the program for close to a year and a half. Zenk stresses the importance of Notre Dame student involve­ment at the Center to help people who have been ne­glected by our society for so long. "Try to fathom that some­one can't read a street sign," said Zenk. "I don't know how you can not help them." 
When asked about the dis­position of the students at the Center, Zenk remarked, "There's something they exhibit--it's more than enthusi­asm. It's an innocence, a sense of wonder at what they're ac­hieving." 
Junior, Rob France, another Notre Dame volunteer, agrees with Zenk adding, "These people really want to learn, and I think that's great. No one really took the time to. educate them before. They just sort-of slipped through the system." 
Most of them pick things up very quickly," said senior, Anne Fessler, "I guess that's because they're so enthusiastic. They never seem to get tired of learning. Also, they seem to really appreciate us tutoring them, and that makes us feel good too." 
Funding for the Center depends upon donations from concerned individuals and groups within the community. The Center has also received contributions from groups of Notre Dame students. In fact, all proceeds from this year's Fisher Regatta were dortated to the Center. 
Anyone needing help can enroll in the program, and the Sisters don't inquire into a stu­dent's personal life unless in­vited to. "That's not what we're here for," said Stoffel. "It's not our business to say 'shame on you.' We want them to be people first--to develop good self-concepts. We will never let a person fail. We always stress the good things, the right answers, never the failures." 
Instilling self-confidence in the students is a primary goal for all the tutors at the Center. According to McGrath and Stof­
fel, a good self-image is ex­
tremely important for people 
who have been conditioned by 
society to consider themselves 
inferior. Once they realize that 
they do have the capacity to 
learn, the greatest obstacle has 
been overcome. 
According to the tutors at the 
Center for Basic Learning 
Skills, all of us who have been 
lucky enough to obtain a good 
education have a duty to help 
the illiterate members of our 
society. They admit that the 
public educational system has 
improved over the years, but, 
in some areas, it still leaves a 
lot to be desired. "I really 
believe we owe it to them," 
said Stoffel. "I think we owe it 
to them because they've been 
shortchanged for so long. It's a 
matter ofjustice."

The Pistons, with Isiah Thomas sinking a "Hail, Mary" fling at the buzzer from just inside the halfcourt line, opened the largest halftime lead in NBA playoff history, 76­
36. The previous record was 36 points on March 30, 1970, when Milwaukee led Philadelphia 77­41. 
The Pistons increased the ad­vantage to as much as 99-51 in the third quarter. 
Adrian Dantley, who scored 18 points in the first half, finished with 24, while Thomas finished with 17 for Detroit. Terry Catledge led Washington with 19 points. All-Stars Moses and Jeff Malone, were held to 17 and 11, respectively.

Sidney Moncrief gave the Bucks a 122-121 lead with 29 seconds to go on a driving bas­ket, but Barkley's six-foot shot from the left baseline, which bounced on the rim several times before falling through, made it 123-122. 
Milwaukee's Terry Cum­mings missed a jump shot and Julius Erving dropped in two free throws with a second remaining for the final points. 
Roy Hinson scored 28 points to lead the 76ers while Barkley added 26 and Erving 23. Ricky Pierce scored 24 for the Bucks, Cummings 21 and Moncrief 20. 
Trail Blazers 111, Rockets 98 
Clyde Drexler scored 32 points and Houston had 25 turn­overs as the Trail Blazers defeated the Rockets. Terry Porter added 18 points and tied a Blazers playoff record with 15 assists. 
The Rockets took a 12-point first-quarter lead, but with Akeem Olajuwon on the bench in foul trouble, fell apart on of­fense in the second quarter. 
Houston was within 92-87 with 7:31 remaining, but Porter and Kiki Vandeweghe hit jumpers and the Rockets got no closer than seven there­after.

Wilkins explodes for 43 for Hawks as Pacers fall behind in series, 2-0 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA Dominique Wilkins scored 43 points and Kevin Willis connected on a short hook shot with 58 seconds remaining as the Atlanta Hawks held off the Indiana Pacers in the closing seconds Sunday night for a 94-93 NBA playoff victory. 
The triumph gave the Hawks a 2-0 lead in the best-of-5 series. Game 3 is Wednesday night in Indiana. 
The Pacers' John Long, who scored 12 of his 14 points in the final period, missed a 15-foot jumper from the foul line with two seconds left that could have given Indiana the victory. 
Chuck Person, who led the Pacers with 24 points, hit a pair of free throws with 42 seconds left, cutting Atlanta's lead to 94-93. 
The Hawks then failed to get off a shot within the allotted 24 seconds and Indiana took over with 17 seconds remaining, set­ting up the shot by Long that hit the rim and bounced away. 
Wilkins rallied Atlanta after the Pacers had taken a 69-60 lead with 5:14 left in the third period. 
Long, however, then got hot and scored 12 of Indiana's next 17 points to give the Pacers a 90-88lead with 2: 29left. Atlanta took the lead on a rebound bas­ket by Wayne "Tree" Rollins at 92-91 with 1:24 to go.

during a 17-2 run that gave the ~ .., = game victory Friday night. Webb had 12 points and 14 as­sists. 
When Willis, who finished with eight points, hit his last­minute hook shot, it was the first time he had scored since the second period. 
The Pacers, behind Wayman Tisdale's 13 second-quarter points, had taken a 42-33 lead before the Hawks ran off a 17-4 string that put Atlanta ahead 50-46. But Indiana scored the last four points of the half. 
Wilkins scored 16 of Atlanta's 21 third-period points as the third quarter ended in a 71-71 
Quint 
continued from page 16 
Both teams made several trips down the court with a lot of agressive play. Willis took a pass from Ann Curoe to cut the Quint lead to four, but Richter's jumper from 15 feet put the game on the books, 21-16. 
"Colleen (Donnelly) did a great job," said England. "She really shut them down when we needed it." 
Both teams had to play very well to get into the Champion­ship Game. Double Decker used an incredible advantage in strength, size, and quicknes~ to appear practically in­destructible in beating We Weren't Cheerleaders in High School, 2.1-8. They followed it up with a closer match against Still Having Fun, showing great balance in winning 21-13. Carolyn Burke had five points for the Cookie, and each team­mate contributed four to over­come the outside bombing of Mary Beth Borkowski, who was this year's Miss Bookstore. 
The Quixotic Quint also had a tough road, overcoming Kukla, Fran, Ollie and Two Other Players, 21-14 behind great teamwork and the rebounding of Brommeland. The Hoosier Lawyers??? were next up for the Quint. In the best game of the tournament, the Quint overcame the tough, talented Hoosiers with a Rich­ter free throw that won the game, 21-19. Both teams were worthy of a victory in this one, but the Quint proved them­selves as a great team when they held off the final surge of the Hoosiers. 
"Our fans really got us going," said Quint team mem­ber England. "Our foul shoot­ing was up from last year. Our defense came through today, and we played well enough to win the game." 
So the 1987 tournament ends with the Quixotic Quint taking their place as champions of Wo­rnen's Bookstore Basketball.

dished off to Donald Royal un­derneath, kicked out to either Wes Shorter or Kim Adams, or got fouled on his way to the bas­ket, the result was usually an­other Manhood score. 
The game began with both teams exchanging jump shots en route to a three-all tie. Bas­kets by Royal, Adams and Brown gave Manhood a 6-3 lead, a lead that they would never relinquish. Leone's stayed close until the end of the half, behind Bill Sullivan's five points, and trailed at the inter­mission, 11-9. The Stallions were able to neutralize Man­hood's height advantage under­neath in the early going, but left Shorter and Adams free to pop from the outside. 
Ironically, the two non­varsity athletes on Da' Brot­hers and the only players on the court under six feet tall (Shorter and Adams) com­bined for 13 of Manhood's 21 points, hitting long jumpers to give their squad much-needed breathing room in the second half. 
"We concentrated on shut­ting them down underneath," said AI Martin of the Stallions' game plan. "We didn't think the little guys would hit the jumpers like they did." 
With the score 12-10 early in the second half, Shorter tallied his team's next three points on bombs from the outside to put Manhood up 15-11, and Da' Brothers saw their visions of the title come close to being realized. Shorter said he was happy to be able to contribute as much as he did in the cham­pionship game. In earlier rounds, Da' Brothers relied heavily on their inside game, with the brunt of the scoring being done by Royal and Joel Williams. But Shorter never doubted that, given the chance, 
Monday, April 27, 1987 -page 13 
he and Ad~ms could come 
through. 
"There wasn't any set plan 
for Kim and I to shoot like we 
did," said Shorter after going 
6-of-7 in the contest. "They 
(Leone's) collapsed on Donald 
down low and they just couldn't 
get back when he kicked it back 
out. Fortunately, we were hit­
ting from out there. I felt pretty 
good shooting the ball, and we 
were open a lot of the time." 
Sandwiched between 
Shorter's fourth and fifth points 
came a brief, yet intense, al­
tercation between the two 
teams. Mter pulling down a de­
fensive rebound, Royal threw 
an elbow at Leone's Sullivan as 
Sullivan had his hands in 
Royal's face trying to prevent 
a fast break. No call was made, 
and as the two players headed 
upcourt, minor jostling 
progressed into a scuffle that 
eventually included most 
members of both teams. 
The incident was quickly bro­
ken up by the referees, but 
seemed to be an indication of 
the Stallions' frustration with 
the game's officiating. Not a 
single foul had been called on 
Manhood in the first half, while 
Leone's had been tagged with 
eleven. 
"The referees were in­
timidated by them 
(Manhood)," commented Mar­
tin, Leone's intense 
playmaker. "The officiating 
was awful." 
Royal went 5-of-7 from the field and denied the Stallions from putting up second and third shots by dominating the defensive boards. He ripped down 11 rebounds, and slapped away several shot attempts. Sullivan had eight points for the Stallions, who finished as runner-up in the tournament for the second consecutive year. 
"Last year, it was a big thing 
to reach the finals," said the 
sharp-shooting Sullivan. "This 
year, we were confident that 
we could make it to the finals, 
and it's a little disappointing 
that we couldn't win it. Losing 
was a letdown, but we're happy 
that we reached the finals 
again." 
Six of the Elite Eight bowed out on Friday and Saturday, in­cluding defending champion and top seed (and some reporters' pick to win it all), Party at Chips When We Repeat. It was 4 Slammma Jamma that broke up the Party with a convincing 21-16 upset, as Scott Hicks and Chris Perozek led Slamma with eight points each. 
"They really prepared well for us," said Party at Chips' point guard Bubba Cunnin­gham. "We couldn't get in synch, and we didn't seem to be able to get any bounces. We didn't play as well as we would have liked." 
In previous action over the weekend, Leone's pulled out two, 22-20 overtime wins. Friday, they nipped New Or­der, and in Saturday's semi­final, they ended 4 Slamma Jamma's dreams for the title. Da' Brothers of Manhood knocked off Corporate Raiders, 21-16, after trailing 11-8 at the half. The next day they downed Tequila White Lightning, 21-19. 
According to Tournament Commissioner Steve Wenc, the tournament ran extremely smoothly and, in his words, "everything was copacetic." Great interest in the tourney and attendance at games in­volving Final 16 teams indi­
cates that things might be copacetic for at least a few more years.

CLEVELAND -Tommy John pitched a one-hitter over seven innings and Dave Winfield had three hits and drove in four runs as the New York Yankees routed the Cleveland Indians 14-2 Sunday. 
John, who pitched seven shutout innings against Kansas City last Sunday, struck out four and walked one. The left­bander retired 14 Indians on groundouts in improving his career record against Cleveland to 19-12.

Lacrosse teant splits in weekend blowouts 
By CHRIS DALLAVO 
Sports Writer 
One thing is certain about this weekend's lacrosse action -there were goals. Plenty of goals. The only problem Satur­day was that Ohio Wesleyan had most of them, as they beat the Fighting Irish by a score of 17-5. "Serene Sunday" proved to be a different story, however, as the Irish rebounded to crush Wittenburg 26-1. 
"We knew we were in for a fight (with Ohio Wesleyan) and we got one," said Notre Dame head coach Rich O'Leary. "They played extremely well. They could possibly be the best team we've ever played." 
O'Leary's praise was well­deserved, as the Battling Bis­hops, the second-ranked Divi­sion III team in the nation, jumped out to a 5-0 lead. John McLachlan and John Olmstead rallied the Irish, combining for three goals in the second per­iod, but Ohio Wesleyan coun­tered with three of their own, making the halftime score 8-3. 
The third period was much like the first, as Ohio Wesleyan, behind Rob Alvino and Kevin Crooks, fired in four straight goals, while the Notre Dame of­fense went into hiding. 
"We worked very, very hard on defense, and we were able to contain them fairly well," noted O'Leary. "But they wore us down. Our defense got tired, and they wound up scoring." 
The Irish refused to die, as Jim Shields tallied in the fourth period, and then Randy McDonald notched his first career goal for Notre Dame. The Battling Bishop's proved to be just too much, however, as they added five goals to make the final score 17-5. 
Sunday was notably better, as the Irish buried the Witten­berg Tigers with an eleven-goal barrage in the first period, and never looked back en route to the 26-1 victory. Fourteen dif­ferent Notre Dame players scored, and when it was over, the Irish had the largest mar­gin of victory, twenty-five goals, in its lacrosse history. 
Brew Crew wins again 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE -Juan Castillo hit his first major-league home run and the Milwaukee Brewers improved their record to 16-1 by completing a three­game sweep of the Baltimore Orioles with a 5-3 victory Sun­day. 
The Brewers took a 2-0 lead in the third on singles by Bill Schroeder and Castillo and Robin Yount's triple. Mil­waukee went ahead 3-0 in the fourth when ob Deer tripled and scored on Cecil Cooper's groundout. 
In the mth, Orioles starter Mike Flanagan, 0-3, gave up a single to Jim Paciorek before Castillo homered to give the Brewers a 5-0 lead. 
Milwaukee starter Mike Birkbeck, 1-0, limited the Orioles to three hits through the first five innings before yield­ing two runs in the sixth. 
Dan Plesac, the third Mil­waukee pitcher, pitched the final 1 1-3 innings to record his sixth save. 
Bookstore Basketball Lists 
"It was a case where every­thing we did worked, and everything they did failed," ob­served O'Leary. "(Wittenberg) was a little out­manned today." 
Notre Dame scored virtually at will. McLachlan led the as­sault with six points, and Brian McHugh and Jeff Shay chipped in with four points apiece. 
The rout allowed O'Leary to rest his starters for most of the game, as he took them out leading 15-1 with ten minutes remaining in the second period. 
"We have a lot of games in a short period of time, and we were fortunate to be able to spread around the playing time," commented O'Leary, referring to this week's con­tests against Michigan State and Ohio State. "Our season is on the line, and we need to have everyone ready to play." 
Both of the games will be on the road, Wednesday at Mic­higan State and then Saturday at Ohio State. Both are also conference games, and will decide the Great Lakes Lacrosse Conference champi­onship.

It wasn't easy, but the Quixotic Quint won the Wo­men's Bookstore Tournament Championship yesterday at the Stepan courts. The Quint, be­hind the gutty play and high scoring of Regie Richter, dethroned last years champs, Double Decker Oreo Cookie, 21­16.

Irish outside linebacker coach Barry Alvarez is a new­comer to Head Coach Lou Holtz's staff, but Saturday he resorted to an old Notre Dame ploy, in coaching his Blue squad to a 24-7 win over the Gold squad in the 57th annual Blue-Gold Game. 
Spring Football '87 
lead on a Mark Green one-yard dive. 
From there, the Green went on to control the game on both sides of the ball. The Green piled up 371 yards of total of­fense (213 on the ground) while limiting the Gold to 167 yards of total offense and yards rushing. While numbers may seem whelming, Holtz 
the result. 
"I don't think there's an aw­ful lot you can tell from a spring game," said Holtz, watched the game from press box. "I wasn't there, but I'm told the hitting was very good. There were far 

the details from the annual spring game at left. 
to get it, and we did." 
Both teams started playing tough defense and forc­ing turnovers, until Bennett opened the scoring for the Cookie. After the court was cleared of Oreos thrown by the rowdy Cookie crowd, teams continued cold until basket by Lavetta Willis put the Cookie up by two. 
The Quint was playing tough, swarming defense, but it was slow on offense until Col­leen Donnelly put her team on the board with a rebound goal, 


Or was it the Green-Gold game? Showing he's no stranger to Irish legend, Al­varez had his charges put on the green jerseys before taking the field. The psych ploy seemed to have an effect, as the newly-named Green team took the opening kickoff and marched 75 yards to take a 7-0
