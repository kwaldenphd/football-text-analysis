Conference analyzes church sex scandal 
By LAURAN WILLIAMSON 
News Writer 
The Church Study Committee, appointed last spring by University President Father Edward Malloy in response to the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, a panel discus­s ion Monday in McKenna Hall on "Dallas and Beyond: The Experience and the Future." 
Part of a conference entitled, "Hestoring Trust: Perspectives after Dallas," panelists included Commonwealth editor Margaret O'Brien Steinfels, Scott Applebee, pro­fessor of history and director of Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, and Father Richard McBrien and Crowley-O'Brien Professor of Theology at Notre Dame. 
Steinfels and Applebee spoke at the June 14 meeting in Dallas, where the American Catholic bishops imposed a one-size-fits-all system of permanent separation from ministry "for even a single act of sexual abuse ... of a minor -past, present or future." 
Steinfels was the first to speak. She described the conference in Dallas as "an awesome experience -in the archaic sense." 
Her overriding feeling concerning the conference was one of dread. According to Steinfels, in the future, Catholics need to determine who they are as a Church. She concluded that the problems surrounding the Church now cannot he resolved from the top down. What is needed is a reorganiza­tion of relationships, she said. That is, the relationship between the bishops and priests, and among the bishops, other clergy and the people they serve. 
"Great good may come," Steinfels said. "The Church has been wounded and it requires examination and repair." 
Applebee began his speech using a psychological analogy in which he compared an inkblot test with five images taken from the traumatic ordeal of the Church. Applebee also touched upon the fact that while in Dallas he was warned not to touch the subject of the role of women in the church because the bishops did not take well to this subject. However, he spoke on the issue anyway and raised it again. "Women should be empow­ered in leadership capacities [within the church]." Applebee said. He also addressed the issue of married priests and women being ordained, as a possi­ble solution to the sex-abuse scandals. 

The final panelist speaker was McBrien. He immediately established the fact that the sex-abuse scandals are explicit to the Roman Catholic Church and they are not such a prob­lem for other Catholic churches. His hypothesis as to why this is was the fact that non-Roman Catholics allow married men into the priesthood. In his speech he addressed three specific questions: Whose trust needs to be restored? Trust in whom? How can this be accomplished? He also spoke about the "failure of pastoral leader­ship," claiming that the Church is too concerned with percentage of priests rather than the quality. He criticized bishops for reassigning known preda­tory priests to different parishes. He said that the "health of the Church sacramental life is at risk." We need to change the way bishops are selected and promoted from dioceses to anoth­er. 
At the conclusion of the panel dis­cussion, the floor was opened for the audience to ask questions.

Father Joyce continues recovery 
By MATT BRAMANTI 
News Writer 
Father Edmund Joyce continues to recuperate at the St. Joseph Regional Medical Center in South Bend and shows signs of improve­ment, said Father William Seetch, CSC religious superior. 
Joyce, Notre Dame's executive vice president emeritus, suffered a stroke on Sept. 20 at the age of 85. 
He is currently located in the reha­bilitation unit of the hospital and is undergoing physical therapy. 
"He's regained some movement in his left side," said Seetch, having just returned from an assessment of Joyce's condition. 
However, despite this improve­ment, a date has still not been set for his release from the hospital. 
Joyce will likely remain hospital­ized for several more weeks to a month at least. 
For the present, visitors have been discouraged at Fr. Joyce's request, as he continues his slow but steady recovery. 
Joyce remains in intensive therapy at St. Joseph Regional Medical Center. 
Joyce retired in 1987, when the board of trustees voted to name the Athletic and Convocation Center after him.

dignity. 
"That guy" sure gets around cam­pus, but nobody ever wants to be in his shoes. I guess climbing into the wrong bed, on the wrong dorm floor that is already occupied isn't cool anymore. Stories about "that guy" are the life blood of a college campus and you have to give him credit for being who he is. Without caring about embarrassment or disgust from oth­ers. he takes it upon himself to do something that will be remembered and retold by every bystander who witnesses his feat of uncouth bravery. 
For example, only "that guy" would show up as a senior to a freshman chemistry final and scream hysteri­cally that he's tired of taking the same class for four years and proceed to light the test on fire. Or perhaps he made us laugh when he peed on my dorm room floor because he mistook my room for the bathroom. He fin­ished his business. then casually washed his hands in my sink and went back to bed. 
Treat him with justice because he gives us something better to talk about. The endless debate over why the dining hall calls chicken noodle soup "chicken in the pot" is beginning to lose its place in my heart. 
Furthermore, laughter is the key to living a worthwhile life and "that guy" gives us a plentiful dose of amuse­ment each week to make up for the more trying moments of life. A good chuckle after hearing a story about "that guy's" shenanigans last week­end can help brighten up even the more depressing days of the semes­ter. 
Yet, besides his popularity, nobody ever seems to want to be him but merely be the witness to his madness. Yet, we have all unwittingly assumed the role of "that guy" or "that girl" in one time or another and I guarantee that as long as you are breathing, you'll be it again and again. 
Perhaps the role ofthat guy doesn't appeal to you, but everyone has to take a turn at the part or he will die out. In my opinion, life without "that guy" isn't a life worth living. The entertain­ment he provides more than makes up for the embarrassment "that guy" faces after one ofhis follies. 
Although being "that guy" can entail some criticism and degradation, his stories can create a legend. So, the next time you see him wearing a black turtleneck in 90-degree weather don't fret, but shake his hand for doing his duty for that day. Just remember that tomorrow might be yours and that you will be merely doing your part to make the world a more enjoyable place.

NEW YORK 

Five New York University stu­dents sat inside Sen. Hillary Clinton's New York offices last Thursday and refused to leave for nine hours. asking that she vote against military action in Iraq. 
The students made an appoint­ment with Clinton's aides on the premise that they were deliver­ing an anti-war petition with more than 1,000 signatures, which they circulated around the university the week before. However, they refused to leave the offices after Clinton's aides told th~m she would not sign a 
statement guaranteeing her vote against military action. The group left at about 10 
p.m.. after it was evident Clinton would vote in favor of a resolu­tion being debated in the U.S. Senate. The resolution gives President George W. Bush the power to use military force against Iraq if it does not comply with United Nations demands to get rid of its weapons of mass destruction. 
Clinton's aides promised that the senator would meet with the students within the next 30 days, said Jason Rowe, one of the stu­dents inside the office. However, they were not given a specific appointment. 
The House approved the reso­lution on Thursday, 296-133, fol­lowed by the Senate's approval, 77-23, on Friday. 
"She was a coward. plain and simple," Rowe said of Clinton. "She didn't have the courage to vote against the resolution." 
Outside the office building at 770 Third Ave., nearly 50 pro­testers chanted anti-war slogans and held signs, asking passing traffic to "honk for peace." 
"We want Hillary Clinton to vote with the people," said Jane Hirschman, an Upper West Side resident and protest organizer. 
Many of the protesters were members of the NYU Peace Coalition and Pax Christi, but the group included private citizens who said they had read about the event on the Internet that day. 

"Money for peace, money for housing, money for jobs, not for war," they shouted. 
The students inside Clinton's offices said · they were approached by the Secret Service, who asked for their names and social security num­bers. However, the students refused to give out any informa­tion and resisted a search, Rowe said. 
"They tried to trick us into consenting to be searched, though we were smart enough to say explicitly, 'I do not consent to be searched,"' Rowe said. 
While they were in the office, the students received a confer­ence call from several university officials, including Tom Ellett, executive director of housing and residence life, and Richard Kalb, associate dean for stu­dents. 
Rowe said he thought that uni­versity officials supplied the Secret Service agents with the students' social security num­bers and birthdates. 
The officials contacted the stu­dentc; and were put on a speaker phone in the office, Rowe said. The otflcials said they would call the students' parents and threat­ened academic repercussions for participation in the sit-in, Rowe said. 
"I have a 3.88 GPA,' I said. I probably used bad language,'' Rowe said. "I said, 'There's no way that you can tell me you're going to get me in academic trouble.'"

Program targets student plagiarism 
ByANDREW FRISTCH 
The Daily Cougar 
HOUSTON 
Although academic dishon­esty may never be eliminated from the education system, a common form -plagiarism ­got one step closer to leaving the University of Houston's campus with the addition of new anti-plagiarism software. 
UH faculty and staff can now use the services of Turnitin.com, the world's largest non-profit, anti-plagia­rism service-providing organi­zation, said Marshal Schott. UH's director of education out­reach and technology. 
UH purchased a campus-wide license for about $9,000 per year, said Betty Roberts, vice president of information tech­nology. 
"Faculty had indicated this [plagiarism] was a real issue," Schott said. 
He said Turnitin.com was chosen because of its reputa­tion, easy use and excellent online support. Roberts said any 
students or facul­ty need­ing addi­tional h e I p using the program would receive support from the I T depart­ment. Students in their classes e-mail t h e i r papers to the mailbox for pla­giarism revision through instruc­tors who use the program are pro­vided with an on line 

user ID and password. 
Turnitin.com, Roberts said. The 
program then goes online and 
works like a search engine to 
check for plagiarism. 
Turnitin.com first appeared at 
UH in Fall 2001 when the 
Department of History pur­
chased a license to use the 
product. 
"What I like about this pro­gram is it makes people think they might get caught," said Sarah Fishman-Boyd. an associ­ate dean of undergraduate studies in the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences. She was also instrumental in bring­ing Turnitin.com to UH. "It gives us a tool to use to dis­suade students form going other places for their work." 
Fishman-Boyd said the histo­ry department started using the product because much of the course work involves writing. She said the department was afraid that students were using someone else's ideas found online instead of presenting their own ideas. 
"I think the main reason stu­dents plagiarize is fear when they don't have any ideas, but instead of getting a C they end up with an F and possibly harsher consequences," Fishman-Boyd said. According to the Student handbook's poli­cy on Academic honesty, the punishment for academic dis­honesty such as plagiarism can be as mild as a lowered grade on the project or as harsh as expulsion from the University, depending on the nature of the act and the record of the stu­dent. Catching students is not how the program succeeds, Fishman-Boyd said. She said success comes from preventing cheating and reducing suspi­cion, which will allow profes­sors to concentrate on students more. Fishman-Boyd said she hasn't caught anyone plagiariz­ing by using the program. She did say that matches for book titles and properly cited infor­mation did come back for some papers, but those instances were trivial. 
Brian McKinney. the director of academic program manage­ment in the Office of the Provost, said the idea for cam­pus-wide use of Turnitin.com was brought before Undergraduate Council in Spring 2002.

Council's new web site to improve communication 
By MATI BRA.MANTI 
News Writer 
The Campus Life Council met Monday night to discuss ways of improving communication with students and focused on the development of a Web­based model similar to the ones used at Yale and other major universities. 
Off-campus senior Erin Cushing pointed out the vast quantity of information posted on the countless bulletin boards across campus. 
"We all realized a need for the University to consolidate its information," Cushing said. 
David Moss. assistant vice president for student affairs, agreed, adding that the pro­posed website could serve multiple ends. 
"We see the website ... as a public relations tool," Moss said. 
Rick Harris, who heads the CLC's leadership task force, emphasized the effect that the website could have on leader­ship development for students. Harris proposed allowing stu­dent groups to post their lead­ership and training opportuni­ties on the site, so that the broader campus community could benefit. 
"We could get a lot ofleader­ship opportunities out there," Harris said.

Private colleges ban fraternities, sororities 
By LEANA DONOFRIO 
Daily Kent Stater 
The numbers are staggering. Greeks claim a large number of the most powerful people in the United States: 75 percent of the 
U.S. 
Congress is Greek. More than 85 percent of student lead­ers in 720 college campuses are Greek members. Eighty percent of Fortune 500 executives are Greek, according to Kent State University's Greek-life Web site "10 Fast Greek Facts." 

But a "fast fact"that is not listed on the site is that only three of the top 10 most presti­gious liberal arts schools have Greek systems, according to 

U.S. 
News and World Report's 2002 report on U.S. colleges and universities. 


Deaths among college Greek members and the movement away from community service has left some schools with the choice of removing fraternities and sororities from their cam­puses. 
This decision to do away with the Greek system has already happened at schools like Williams College, Bowdoin College, Colby College and Alfred University in New York. 
Alfred faced a nightmare situ­ation that contributed to the demise of its Greek system after a student was found dead behind a fraternity house in February. 
Benjamin Klein, 21, was allegedly beaten by members of his fraternity, Zeta Beta Tau. 
Alfred spokeswoman Susan Goetschius said the student's death was not found to be a direct result of the beating, and charges have not been brought against the fraternity brothers who beat him. 
"What we heard is that they [Klein and some fraternity brothers] divulged secrets [about the fraternity] at a chap­ter meeting in Syracuse," Goetschius said. 
Although she warned that details surrounding the incident are only hearsay, she said his fraternity brothers beat him on the way home from the meeting in Syracuse on a Saturday. 
She said it is then believed Klein apologized to his brothers and said he was going home. 
Goetschius said members of the fraternity reported Klein missing when they discovered his car was still at the fraternity house. 
Klein was officially reported missing the next day. and was found frozen and dead later that night just yards away from the backdoor of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity house. 
Klein's death was a factor taken into consideration by the Alfred board of trustees when deciding whether or not to phase out Greek organizations on the campus. 
All the board of trustees members but one, who abstained from voting, recom­mend the organizations be removed. 
Although a few fraternities and sororities still exist at Alfred, they cannot recruit new members and cannot remain at all if they are not in good stand­ing with the university. 
Two Greek organizations at the university were removed recently after breaking the school's anti-hazing policy. The hazing infractions happened after Klein's death. 
"The Greek system is beyond repair," Robert McComsey, the chairman of Alfred's board, told The New York Times. 
Removing fraternities and sororities from college campus­es is not new. Williams College began phasing out fraternities and sororities in the early 1960s, spokesman Jim Kolesar said. None were left by 1969. 
And deaths are not new, either. Alfred experienced another death of a member of a local fraternity, Klan Alpine, in February 1978. This one direct­ly related to hazing. 
"He [the student] was put in a trunk of a car with a six pack and a bottle of liquor and told to drink," Goetschlus said. 
The student was found dead at the fraternity house. Alfred has done a number of studies on fraternities and sororities following the deaths. 
Researchers found the num­ber of students who binge drink and receive low grades was higher with Greek members than students not involved in a Greek organization. 
And hazing is an ongoing problem in the Greek system despite efforts made by Greeks themselves to stop it.

Bioterrorism conference examines threat 
By DAVID ROBINSON 
The Daily Princeronia.n 

PRINCETON, N.J. 
The risk of bioterrorism is not about to go away, but it has to be kept in perspective, said participants in a confer­ence Friday. 
The meeting, "Bioterrorism: Science, Security and Preparedness," was organized by a pair of Princeton gradu­ate students -Rebecca Katz, who studies the politics of bio­logical weapons in the Wilson School, and Scott Steele, who works in molecular biology. 
The response to last fall's anthrax attacks has translated into a huge increase in support for biodefense research, said Jack Killen, assistant director for biodefense research at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a unit of tho National Institutes of Health. 
The president requested a total of $5.9 billion for bioter­rorism preparedness in next year's budget, Killen said. NIH's biodefense research pro­gram is slated to receive $1.75 billion, up from less than $275 million this year, he said. 
Killen explained that NIH's research will focus on ways to deal with "Category A" biologi­cal agents -a list of the most dangerous known diseases. These agents are both lethal and easy to spread, he said, and they include such age-old human scourges as smallpox and the plague, along with anthrax. 
One goal of the new research will be to screen existing medi­cines for effectiveness against bioterrorism agents, to get away from a "one bug, one drug" strategy that requires the use of special treatments in response to a particular type of bioterror attack, Killen said. 
Using existing drugs, when possible, is easier than deploy­ing special treatments during an emergency, he said. 
Nonetheless, Killen said that the main effect of last year's anthrax mailings was to pro­duce disruption and fear ­not death. The attacks pro­duced just 23 cases of anthrax, of which five were fatal. he said. "If you step back from the last year, the threat we need to be worried about in terms of infection is the natur­al threat." he said. 
Ile pointed to the reemer­gence of AIDS, West Nile, Lyme disease and drug-resis­tant forms of tuberculosis and malaria as major areas of con­cern. Using disease as a weapon is not a new idea, noted Stephen Morse, director of the Center for Public Health Preparedness at Columbia University's school of public health. It has been successfully used not only recently, but throughout history, he said. 
In 1346, Mongol warriors threw plague-infested corpses over the walls of the city of Caffa. triggering a pandemic the next year. And during the colonization of America, Lord Jeffery Amherst gave blankets laced with smallpox to Native Americans, he said. 
Summarizing the day's events, molecular biology pro­fessor Lee Silver said biologi­cal weapons are easily accessi­ble.

Sniper suspected in Virginia murder investigation 
Associated Press 
FALL.5 CHURCH. Va. 

A woman was shot in the head and killed Monday night as she and her hus­band loaded packages into their car out­side a Home Depot in suburban Washington. Police were investigating whether it was the latest shooting by a sniper already blamed for eight deaths in the past 12 days. 
Police swiftly closed down highways in the area, about 10 miles west of the nation's capital, creating massive gridlock as they searched for a van from which the shooter might have fired. 
Fairfax County Police Chief Tom Manger said authorities were on the look­out for a cream-colored Chevy Astra van that was missing a left rear tail light and had a silver roof ladder. Virginia State Police said the van was last seen traveling east on Route 50 from Falls Church. Interstates 66 and 1-95 are nearby. 
Witnesses at some of the earlier shoot­ings also reported seeing a white or cream-colored van or truck. 
The woman was felled by a single shot about 9:15 p.m., authorities said. All the other deaths in the sniper spree were also caused by one shot, and two people also were wounded by a single bullet. 
The Maryland task force investigating the sniper attacks was conferring with Fairfax County authorities to see if Monday's victim was the sniper's ninth. 
"It's too early to tell at this time [if the shooting is linked], however we are work­ing it and investigating it with that poten­tial in mind," Manger said. 

The woman was shot in the head as she and her husband loaded packages into their car's trunk, said Ellen Qualls, a spokeswoman for Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner. Someone fired the fatal shot from a van, she said. 
"There's some pretty decent eyewitness information that maybe we haven't had in some of the previous shootings," Qualls said. 
Immediately after the shooting, the vic­tim's body lay under a sheet 30 yards in front of the store entrance. 
Police were still scouring the parking lot for evidence and interviewing witnesses early Tuesday. There were a number of people in the parking lot when the shoot­ing occurred, Manger said. 
"More than anything else, I wished I was outside so I could identify this guy," one woman who had been stuck inside the Home Depot as authorities closed it told CNN. "I am used to seeing blood, but this amount of blood shocked me." 
The Home Depot is located in the Seven Corners Shopping Center. a 450,000­square-foot strip shopping center with a parking garage. 
Monday's killing occurred at one of northern Virginia's busiest intersections, where major arteries come together to form seven corners. Clint Van Zandt, a former FBI profiler who lives in Fredericksburg, Va., said the location sets the slaying apart from the others. 

WORLD NEWS BRIEFS 
Bin Laden allegedly praised attacks: 
_ A signed statement allegedly from Osama bin Laden claimed Monday that recent attacks in Yemen and Kuwait were designed to coincide with the anniversary of the war in Afghanistan and to send a "clear and strong message" to the world that his al-Qaida organization is still active. The statement, which was faxed to the Al­Jazeera network and posted on an Islamic Web site. appeared to have been written on a comput­er, using an Arabic font that looks like handwrit­ing. The signature at the bottom is similar to bin Laden's distinctive style, with a loop at the end. Still, there was no way to authenticate the state­ment. Bin Laden's whereabouts are unknown and President Bush said Monday: "We don't know whether bin Laden is alive or dead. We do know that al-Qaida's still dangerous, and while we've made good progress, there is a lot more work to do."

Large meat recall covers 6 months: 
Pilgrim's Pride voluntary recalled 27.4 million pounds of sliced deli poultry Sunday over concerns about possible listeria contamination. The parent of Wampler Foods announced its decision after a strain of the potentially fatal bacteria was found at a Wampler plant in suburban Philadelphia. The nationwide recall covers meat processed at the Franconia plant from May 1 through Oct. 11. 

Ohio panel gives evolution debate nod: 
A state school board panel Monday recommended that Ohio science classes emphasize both evolution and the debate over its validity. The committee left it up to individual school districts to decide whether to include in the debate the concept of "intelligent design," which holds that the universe is guided by a higher intelligence. The guidelines for the science curriculum simply put into writing what many school districts already do.

Columbus Day parade excludes actors: 
Did the mayor ruin the celebration by skipping New York's Columbus Day parade? Fuhgeddaboudit. Mayor Michael Bloomberg bowed out Monday after parade organizers said two actors from "The Sopranos" were not welcome because the HBO hit negatively portrays Italian-American life. Not that the controversy stopped the annual parade up Pifth Avenue. "These are fictional characters. People have to remember that it's telling a story," said "Sopranos" fan Sal Ciniglio, 29, as he snapped a photo of his girlfriend. "It's a show. Get a life." The Columbus Citizens Foundation had sought a federal court order to bar Dominic Chianese and Lorraine Bracco from marching in the parade. Chianese plays mob boss Junior Soprano; Bracco plays psy­chiatrist Dr. Melfi. Bloomberg said he invited the pair because Bracco acts as a city spokeswoman on environmental issues and Chianese makes a public service announcement for tourism.

BALI 

Indonesia's government, reel­ing from a bomb attack that killed at least 180 people, acknowledged for the first time Monday that al-Qaida is active on its soil -setting the stage for a possible crackdown on extremists. 
Stocks plummeted in the capi­tal Jakarta, and markets sank elsewhere in Southeast Asia as tourists fled the country, already one of the region's most fragile economics. 
But many Americans said they were planning to stay, contrary to State Department advice and despite warnings U.S. interests could be the next targets. 
The car bomb Saturday at a nightclub packed with foreign­ers on this resort island is likely to harm more than just the economy and tourism. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, and despite 
U.S. pressure and the discovery of an al-Qaida-linked terror net­work in neighboring Singapore and Malaysia, Indonesia has insisted there is no threat of vio­lent extremism on its soil. 
The turnaround came after a Cabinet meeting in Jakarta Monday, when Defense Minister Matori Abdul Djalil said, "We are sure al-Qaida is here." 
"The Bali bomb blast is linked to al-Qaida with the cooperation of local terrorists," he said. 
President Megawati Sukarnoputri is likely to face growing demands to arrest high-profile suspects whose continued freedom has astound­ed law enforcement officials in other countries. Whether she can do so without provoking extremists -and possible fur­ther attacks -is an open ques­tion. / 
In Washington, Presicl/nt Bush had strong words f6rth~ Indonesian leader, saying he planned to talk to her about the need to crack down on terror­ism. 
"I hope I hear the resolve of a leader who recognizes that any time terrorists take hold in a country it's going to weaken the country itself," Bush said. 
"And there has to be a firm and deliberate desire to find out -find the killers before they kill somebody else,'' he said. 
Security Minister Bambang Susilo Yudoyono said there were signs terrorists were plan­ning attacks against industrial sites, including ExxonMobil's Arun liquefied natural gas ,plant in Aceh and the Caltex refinery in Sumatra. 
"We will increase the security alert in those areas," Yudoyono said. 
On Bali, there was no visible evidence of a higher security presence or stricter controls at / 

the airport, though police insist­
ed an elite unit had been 
deployed. 

The FBI and Australian detec­
tives joined the hunt for the 
killers. Investigators from 
Scotland Yard were on the way, and Germany said it might send experts. 
Bali police said 27 witnesses had been questioned. Suspicion has fallen on 
Jemaah Islamiyah, a group that Singapore says is based in Indonesia and is linked to Osama bin Laden's terror net­work. But the group's leader denied involvement.

Pilgrim's Pride, based in Pittsburg, Texas, is the nation's second-largest poul­try company behind Tyson Foods. Its stock price plunged 24.7 percent, down $1.73, to close Monday at $5.28, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Consumers were urged by the company to return any affected meat to the store or deli where it was purchased for a full refund. 
The discovery followed an investigation of a listeria out­break in eight Northeast states since early summer that caused at least 120 ill­nesses and 20 deaths, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said. 
"We want consumers to be aware of the recall because of the potential for foodborne illness," said Dr. Garry L. McKee, the inspection ser­vice's administrator. 
No products have been linked to that outbreak, said David Van Hoose, Wampler's chief executive officer. The genetic strain that caused the outbreak is different from the strain found at the plant, offi­cials said. 
"We don't have any scien­tific evidence at this point that there is a connection, but our analysis of sampling in that plant is not com­plete," said the USDA's Steven Cohen. He said the recall was the largest in U.S. history. 
Company officials said the recall didn't include fresh turkeys, and that it should have no effect on the holiday season.

IN BRIEF 
EasyJet to buy I 20 Airbus planes 
EasyJet PLC has agreed in principle to buy 120 planes from European aircraft maker Airbus SAS with an option to purchase anoth­er 120 over the next decade, the budget air­line announced Monday. The long awaited deal is a snub to The Boeing Co., which has long been the preferred supplier to low-cost operators in Europe and the United States. 
EasyJet is only the second low-cost carrier, after JetBlue Airways Corp., to order Airbus planes. However, the deal may be an expen­sive one for Airbus. Britain's easyJet said it will pay about 30 percent less for the air­planes than it paid for Boeing 737s almost four years ago after adjusting for inflation. This suggests a deep discount to the roughly $51 million catalog price for both models. 'There is some sort of discount in the contract ... but we never sell aircraft at a loss," an Airbus spokesman said. 

Germany backs off budget restraints 
German leaders wrapped up budget talks Monday saying they had agreed to borrow more heavily to help plug a $10 billion budget gap. backing off from fiscal restraints in order to spur the economy. 
Greens party co-leader Fritz Kuhn said the parties had decided to be "flexible" in their drive to balance the budget by 2006, and would borrow an additional $2.6 billion in the next year. The rest of the budget gap will be made up by closing tax loopholes and subsi­dies. which will save $4.2 billion, and through budget cuts. said Franz Muentefering, the par­liamentary leader of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats party. 
Tax measures decided upon included setting a minimum corporate tax, which will limit the ability of companies to offset current taxes with past losses. In borrowing more, Germany is llirting with an annual deficit of 3 percent ­a ceiling agreed upon by the 12 nations using the euro currency. Still, Muentefering and Kuhn insisted the country was still on track to balance the budget in four years, also mandat­ed by the European Union.

Among other issues, investigators are looking at whether auditors in New York and Boston should have disclosed in a proxy statement that a $32 million bonus was paid to former CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski, according to the source, who spoke to The Associated Press on con­dition on anonymity. 

The inquiry is looking at individual auditors, not the accounting firm itself, according to the source, who added that criminal charges are not immi­nent. The firm said it was cooperating with the investigation. 
Kozlowski, Tyco's for­mer chief executive, and Mark Swartz, its former chief financial officer, have been charged with enterprise corruption and grand larceny for allegedly stealing $600 million from the compa­ny. They face up to 25 years in prison on each charge if convicted. 
Based in Bermuda, the diversified conglomerate is headquartered in Exeter, N.H., and had $36 billion in sales last year.

Stepping off the plane in crisp suits and dresses, the returnees clung to each other and erupted into tears and then broad smiles as they hugged family members wait­ing at the bottom of the stairs. Waving Japanese flags, family members showered them with large bouquets of red and pink roses. 
During the two-hour flight, they were treated to a Japanese style lunch of tuna sashimi, grilled beef and soba noodles, as well as welcome­home notes and digital photos of what their relatives look like after decades of lost contact. 
Family and friends awaited them with a mix of excitement and unease. 
"Today I'm going to be very cheerful to welcome her and forget the past just for now," said Yuko Hamamoto, brother of returnee Fukie Hamamoto. 
She and her then-fiancee Yasushi Chimura were grabbed from behind, wrapped in bags and whisked away in North Korean boats as they strolled along a secluded Japanese beach in 1978, when both were just 23 years old. 
Now married, they are among the five returnees who are the only known survivors of at least 13 people abducted by the North in the 1970s and early 80s to train its spies in the Japanese language and culture.

'Tm very happy about the development. But this does not close the abduction issues,"chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda said. 
Suspicion also runs high because the abductees, now all in their 40s, are only allowed to stay a week or two and for­bidden to bring their children. Calling the children hostages, family members and govern ment officials have said the abductees won't be able to speak openly about North Korea for fear of retribution.

CHINA 

China's Jiang faces uncertainty 
Associate.! Press 

SHANGHAI 
Down the quiet tree-lined alley, past the four-story Art Deco apartments, an officer of the People's Armed Police steps out of the shadows, cries "Halt!" and turns away cars and pedestrians. 
Even many longtime Shanghai residents have never heard of Dechang Road, tucked in one of the city's smartest neighborhoods. But word has it that this is where Chinese President Jiang Zemin will live after his expected retirement as Communist Party chief in November, and as president next year. 
If people are unsure where 72-year-old Jiang will spend his silver years, they're even less certain what sort of legacy he'll leave. Unlike his prede­cessors, Jiang has failed to make a strong personal imprint on the world's most populous nation. 
He's not a revered nation­builder like Mao Zedong, or a pragmatic visionary like Deng Xiaoping. But his bland, con­sensus-oriented style of lead­ership may have been exactly what was needed by a country weary of decades of political persecutions and failed eco­nomic utopianism. 
''He's no Deng Xiaoping," said Cheng Li, author of the book, "China's Leaders: The New Generation." 
"Deng had a broader vision. But Jiang's weakness is his strength. He relied on think tanks. He talks to other peo­ple." 
Deng, the peasant who became a revolutionary, installed Jiang, the university educated electrical engineer, as successor at a difficult time -after the 1989 suppression of democracy protesters on Tiananmen Square. The cau­tious, pliable Jiang, mayor and then party boss of Shanghai, was apparently picked because he was inoffensive to Beijing's political factions. 
Widely seen as a temporary choice, Jiang held on as party general secretary -China's top post -for 13 years by shepherding Deng's reform course forward. Deng, who died in 1997, moved China away from Mao's collectivist experiments with a mix of eco­nomic freedoms and tightly reined politics. 
China under Jiang has seen surging incomes and soaring skyscrapers, and an unprece­dented engagement in world affairs, winning the 2008 Olympics and membership in the World Trade Organization. 
Jiang has worked to frame the country's future as one of pragmatism and middle-of­the-road nationalism specially crafted to the Chinese people. 
But he also leaves behind corruption. massive unemploy­ment, a banking system ridden with bad debts, and a growing income gap.

A modest proposal to end poverty 
If Saddam Hussein and the Iraq situ­ation weren't dominating national dis­cussion (and sidewalk space), we would be hearing a lot more about wel­fare reform right now. The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Amy Schill Reconciliation Act, also known as The Most Politically Dazed and Correctly Named Amused Act Ever, is up for reauthorization. 
Debate on this issue has been post­poned at present, but as soon as the president has finished relating every­thing on his pre-existing agenda to the war on terrorism, Congress can once again discuss poverty, which of course has absolutely nothing to do with ter­rorism. The debate will go on for weeks and result in little actual reform: Republicans want stricter work requirements, Democrats want more money allocated for childcare. Eventually, the 2003 Still More Personal Responsibility, Work Opportunity, Effective Child-Rearing, Enduring Freedom Reconciliation Act will be born. 
I fail to see why we would waste our time in endless political debate and big government when the answer to America's poverty problem is right under our noses: the death penalty. 
No, I'm not suggesting we round up poor people and summarily kill them like animals. But if we just let our economy and criminal justice system work as they have for years, we can get rid of poor people as successfully as we were eliminating the mentally retarded before the Supreme Court made us stop. 
Okay, think about it. Capital punish­ment has an almost perfect efficiency record in eliminating the poor. Ninety­eight percent of convicted criminals sentenced to death could not afford their own attorney. This is the result of the beautiful system I like to call the Capitalism and Criminal Justice Cooperation Act. It's genius. 

Economics teaches us that we all have equal opportunity to improve our lotin life, and whoever is poor is poor because they simply choose not to work hard enough. These people con­tribute nothing to our way of life, but luckily they can be eliminated. You see, when the poor are accused of grievous crimes, they obviously can't afford an attorney of their choosing. 
This is good, of course, because they didn't work hard enough to get a good attorney, so they don't deserve a good one. Unfortunately, public defenders interfere with the market, but luckily they are underpaid, overworked and occasionally asleep during the trial. With such inadequate representation, poor defendants don't stand much of a chance of avoiding a death sentence for their crimes. 
Non-poor murderers and rapists, however, can usually gain a prison sen­tence and hopefully return to the labor market eventually. It's unfortunate that the non-poor have to serve any time at all, but if we spared them punishment, the criminal justice system might be accused of being unfair or economical­ly biased. It is clear to any enlightened observer, however, that with the help of the invisible hand that pushes the less ambitious into poverty, the blind Lady of Justice serves to extinguish once and for all those who wish to hinder the Angel of Progress. 
Hey there liberals, you want some cheese with that whine? I can hear the objections a;lready. First, some say that the competitive market is not perfect, since there are "barriers" to employ­ment for those who want it like "racial discrimination," "grossly unequal edu­cation opportunities" and "some people got no legs." Well, I'm looking at my supply and demand graph, and 1don't see anything that keeps anyone who wants a job from getting one, so why don't you get back on the crazy train to Commieland? (Oh, and I suppose you'll want a wheelchair ramp for Stumpy.) 
And there arc those who equate capi­tal punishment with state-sponsored murder and think it even more repre­hensible than those subject to it because the government should be held to a higher standarri than the basest criminals. There a1 e even those who suggest that a government that gives out visas to dead terrorists might not be the best authority to determine who has the right to live and who does not. 
To those people I have this response: Do you know who doesn't have the death penalty? France. Do you know who cares about France? No one. It is odd that the United States is the only Western industrial nation that still practices the death penalty and that we are a world leader in executing our own citizens, topped only by China, Iran and Saudi Arabia -countries not exactly on the honor roll in morality and economic freedom. 
These other countries have not uti­lized the death penalty as efficiently as we have. Unlike the United States, which has built an execution system that inherently targets the poor, igno­rant and underprivileged, the other world leaders will execute any adulter­ess, homosexual or drug trafficker of any social class. For this reason, we have more PlayStations. 
So, I hope the efficacy of my plan to continue to use the death penalty as a mode of economic development is clear. Welfare programs, even those with work requirements, will never get all the poor completely free of govern­ment assistance. Killing them will. This modest proposal will eliminate some of the least productive members of socie­ty. The only people less productive than the poor are babies. If there were only something we could do with them.

"The poverty ofour century is unlike that ofany other. It is not, as poverty was before, the result ofnatural scarcity, but ofa set ofpriorities imposed upon the rest of the world by the rich. Consequently, the modern poor are not pitied ... but written off as trash. "

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
U.S. trains terrorists at School of the Americas 
After the attacks of Sept. 11 last year, we as a country have experienced the unspeakable pain of terrorism. When President Bush addressed The Citadel in South Carolina last year, he stated: "We cannot accept -and we will not accept -states that harbor, finance, train or equip the agents of terror. Those nations that violate this principle will be regarded as hostile regimes. They have been warned. they are being watched and they will be held to account." Sounds like jus­tice, right? 
While the United States goes stomping about the globe on this new crusade, per­haps Bush and company should do some soul-searching here at home, particularly in regard to the kind of training the U.S. Army gives at Fort Benning's School of the Americas (now the Western Ilcmisphere Institute for Security Cooperation). Since 1946, the U.S. Army has trained Latin American military per­sonnel at the School of the Americas (SOA). 
SOA graduates have been notorious for their complicity in human rights abuses and death squad activity. These include the murders of Archbishop Romero and six Jesuit priests and the rapes and mur­ders of four U.S. churchwomen in El Salvador. In response to the claim of many SOA supporters that the responsi­bility for such incidents lies with a "few bad apples" and not the majority of SOA graduates, a United Nations report stated that more than two-thirds of the more than 60 officers cited in the worst atroci­ties of El Salvador were committed by alumni of the School of the Americas. 
In fact, according to Arthur Jones's article in the Nov. 19, 1993 issue of the National Catholic Reporter entitled, "Haiti, Salvador Links Viewed," thou­sands of declassified documents showed 
that the Reagan Administration was fully 
cognizant of who ran, funded and pro­
tected the El Salvador death squads and 
planned the death of Archbishop Oscar 
Romero. 
Also disturbing and hypocritical were the terrorist tactics and training our gov­ernment offered the contra forces during the U.S. intervention in Nicaragua during in the 1980s. In addition to CIA trainers, the U.S. government contracted out the services of SOA graduates such as former dictator Leopoldo Galtieri, who headed up Argentina's military junta during an infamous period where the number killed and ''disappeared" totaled 30,000 people. 
CIA official John Stockwell claimed ter­rorist tactics were a key part-of the U.S. strategy, saying that "encouraging tech­niques of raping women and executing men and children is a coordinated policy of the destabilization program" in Nicaragua. Manuals were distributed to contra forces with instructions on "Implicit and Explicit Terror," as well as large knives, which, according to former contra leader Edgar Chamorro, were used for cutting peoples' throats. In his affidavit to the World Court, he explained that while in contra camps along the Honduran border, he frequently heard offhand comments like, "Oh, I cut his throat." He also testified that, "we were told that the only way to defeat the Sandinistas [the left-wing opposition in Nicaragua] was to ... kill, kidnap, rob and torture." Terrorism? I think so. 
The School of the Americas continues to operate today under the name of the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. Human rights abuses and terrorist attacks carried out by SOA graduates continue today, espe-

Revive patriotism on this too-liberal campus 
Bedwetting limousine liberals are overrunning the traditional values of American society and our campus, our University of Notre Dame, has become a breeding ground for these ideas. It started last year on Sept. 12, when students were poisoned with the idea that Sept. 11 was "our fault" and "we brought this upon ourselves." Last time we checked, two of our buildings full of American civilians fell and over 3,000 American citizens were murdered. 
It appeared again last year when South Quad was inundated with yellow shirt­wcaring, Frisbee-throwing, tree-hugging children who believed they could understand the plight of Afghani refugees. Most recently, signs calling for "No War In Iraq" and "Pray for Peace" have degraded further the already decrepit state of patriotic feeling on campus. We are living in an America increasingly un-American. Sixty years ago a different attack was carried out on American soil and American servicemen and civilians were killed. The "greatest genera­tion" put down their books and rallied around something greater than them­selves: the flag, the country and the ideals upon which America was founded. 
When called upon today, the grandchildren of this great generation look up from their copies of "The Communist Manifesto" and their grande steamed latte and say, "not today Uncle Sam, I'm too busy saving the whales." Sacred notions of freedom and liberty have been discarded. Instead, we waste our breath defending oppressive terrorist regimes bent on acquiring weapons of mass destruction. We waste our time in talk instead of action. 
Hecall the famous scene in H.G. Wells' "War of the Worlds." The priest bolieves he can save earth through diplomacy. Just like today, diplomacy's and reason's time have passed. If we continue talking and discussing, we will meet the same end as the priest -death. John Stuart Mill once wrote, "The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight. nothing which is more impor­tant than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than him­self." God bless America.

dally as opposition to neo-liberal eco­nomic policies by Latin America's mar­ginalized people grows. Atrocities com­mitted by SOA graduates in Colombia in recent years are too numerous to count. 
Colonel Jesus Maria Clavijo, a graduate of the SOA, is currently under investiga­tion for collusion with paramili­tary forces in 160 social cleansing murders from 1995 to 1998 in Colombia. SOA graduate Brigadier General Jaime Ernesto Canal Alban was involved in helping to establish a paramilitary group known as the "Calima Front." Canal's brigade was found to have supplied the front with weapons and intelligence. In addi­tion to his involvement with the Calima Front, Canal was in com­mand of soldiers who entered a home and killed five civilians during the birth­day party of a 15-year-old child in 1998. 
Last year the Bolivian government sold the public water system of Cochamba to a private corporation, resulting in skyrock­eting water rates for the people of Bolivia. As thousands took to the streets, Bolivian president, former military dicta­tor and SOA graduate Hugo Banzer sent out the armed forces to attack civilians. In April 2000, after four days of anti-pri­vatization protests, Banzer declared a "state of siege," sending soldiers into the street with live bullets. Seventeen-year­old Victor Hugo Daza was killed by a shot through his face and at least seven others were killed. The number of injuries resulting from military violence totaled over 100. 
Given the SOA's horrific track record and involvement in state-spon­
sored violence and terrorism. the only viable solution is to shut it down. This is 
the only way to stop in part the U.S. government's role 
in supporting terrorism and violence. By 
bringing ter­rorists here to the United States for train­
ing, we become part of a new and different "Ax.is of Evil," one between elites here and elites in other parts of the world. We join the group of states that, in 
President Bush's own words, "harbor, finance. train or equip the agents ofter­ror," and as a patriotic American, an American who loves this country, I can­not accept this. 
If we truly love this country, we would do more good to rise up in opposition against injustice rather than burying our heads in the flag and accepting it as something essential to our security

Holy Cross Order forthright in abuse cases 
I write in response to John Michael Vore's Oct. 7 letter, "Investigate hidden scandals at Notre Dame." I currently serve as counsel to the Priests of Holy Cross, Indiana Province, Inc. Father Malloy and a large number of Holy Cross priests at Notre Dame are members of the Province. I do not represent them as indi­viduals nor do I represent the University. This response will hopefully allay any fears someone may have that there is a "conspiracy of silence" on the part of the Holy Cross order to cover up allegations of abuse by members of the Province. 
I do not minimize the pain Vore contin­ues to suffer as a result of his experience. I once served as a Deputy Prosecuting Attorney and specialized for a time in Sexual Abuse cases. The longstanding pain and suffering of victims of sexual abuse should never be underestimated. However, it is unfair for victims to blame those who are not responsible and in fact have taken aggressive and appropriate action to not only prevent abuse but to act decisively on the infrequent occasions when it does occur. 
The Holy Cross Order has been operat­ing under a sexual abuse policy protocol for the past decade which in large part was adopted by the American Bishops at the conference this summer in Dallas. Scholars from Notre Dame helped con­tribute to this conference by providing the Bishops with a "White Paper" on the sub­ject. 
Recently cases which are alleged to have occurred many years ago have resurfaced because of the media reports of abuse by clerics throughout the coun­try. The Holy Cross Order has cooperated fully with civil authorities and met with victims to help provide support and com­fort. Father Malloy has been a full sup­porter of these efforts and works openly with the Order to provide us with the information necessary for the Order to fol­low its policies and to make sure that we further our mission of helping those in need and not ever harming anyone. 
These efforts and policies have evolved over the years. Could we have done things better and differently in the past? There is no doubt we could have. Just like in socie­ty as a whole, the protocols of dealing with sexual abuse have improved dramat­ically in recent years. We acknowledge that sexual abuse occurs in every social stratum and profession. With this acknowledgement comes tho responsibili­ty to deal with the issue so that those we serve will be able to trust their Church in the same way their parents did. I have every confidence that the Priests of Holy Cross will meet this challenge and am glad to have Father Malloy and Notre Dame as an ally in that effort.

ALBUM REVIEW 


Folds shines in his solitude 
By EMILY TUMBRINK 
Scene Music Critic 
Ben Folds' third solo release and his first attempt at a Jive album successfully conveys his genuine talent as a singer/songwriter/performer. Featuring 17 career-span­
ning tracks from his sold out solo tour, Ben Folds Live contains both unreleased solo songs as well as classic Ben Folds Five hits. However, don't think of this as a greatest hits collection. Some songs that received a decent amount of airplay, such as "Song for the Dumped" and "Battle of Who Could Care Less," are noticeably absent from this collection. 
But no matter, the songs that have been included create a well-rounded and accurate portrayal of the music that Folds tends to write and enjoy playing. He has obvi­ously matured as an artist over the years, and in continuation of this trend 
Ben Folds Live mostly contains ballads 
from his more recent albums. Unlike most other live releases, which are a continuous recording of one show, Ben Folds Live pulls songs from several stops on the tour that were then seam­lessly edited in the studio to create the flow that is so crucial to a live release. 
Although most of the songs on Ben Folds Live are performed in a very similar manner to the studio versions, there are cer­tain differences that make this album a stand­out. Because he has been left with only his piano and a microphone, Folds is forced to improvise on certain songs that require more resources than he has on stage with him. During "Army," he splits the audience down the middle, having one side perform the trumpet part 
while the other half sings the part of the 
saxophones. The result is an amusingly 
accurate sound that makes the listener 
want to sing along. 

The audience also suc­cessfully provides haunting background vocals on "Not the Same," a song originally from Rockin' the Suburbs, Ben Folds' previous solo release. The live version of this song should definitely win the Most Improved award, for it is far superior to the original version included on the studio album. 
The lyrics of "Not the Same" get lost in the dense musical composition of the studio version on which Folds plays not only piano, but also guitar and drums. Luckily, on Ben Folds Live. the melody is greatly sim­plified due to the fact Ben is only able to play one instrument, giv­ing us a chance to focus not only on the lyrics but also on Folds' talent as a pianist. Just in case we had any doubts about his mad piano-playing skills, "Philosophy" includes an extensive jam session that reiterates Folds' raw talent as a musician. Another talented musi­cian, John McCrea of Cake, surprisingly chimes in to provide vocals on "Fred Jones Part 2," just as he does on the original recording from Rockin' the Suburbs. Also included on Ben Folds Live is a cover of Elton John's "Tiny Dancer," and a song called "Silver Street" which was originally recorded for Ben Folds Five's demo tape but never released. 
Anyone with a taste for witty lyrics and piano music will enjoy Ben Folds Live. But don't expect a lot of variety from this album -one man with a piano can only do so much. Folds does, however, offer a few surprises that man­age to keep things interesting. He is able to captivate the audience without the flashy displays of most popular artists. He puts himself in a vulnerable position by performing solo with absolutely no back-ups, a position that many musi­cians would not feel comfortable in. Many of the songs on this album, howev­er, are better than their originals due to Folds' solitude. Through his deeply per­sonal lyrics and the stories he tells, lis­teners are able to get an idea of who Folds really is. Everyone can relate to at least one of the songs on this album.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Elvis proves his royalty on Hits 
By LIAM FARRELL 
Scene Music Critic 
For many people, the image of Elvis is not a brash young teenager walking into Sun Studio to record revolutionary music. The image they see is a tired running joke with an exaggerated lip curl and shaking hips. 
That's not to say Elvis' music hasn't been respected. Artists such as Bruce Springsteen celebrate his work reli­giously, and rarely will there be a worthwhile musician who doesn't give a nod to Elvis at some point or another. But for a lot of people, Elvis was simply the beginning of something that got a lot better as people expanded on what he did. 
30 #1 Hits is a must-have album for any Elvis-doubters out there. From the opening lines of "Heartbreak Hotel" to the backup singers in "Suspicious Minds," this album has 30 tracks (plus a JXL bonus track of "A Little Less Conversation") that prove undeniably that Elvis rocks. This was an artist that could inject more soul, rhythm, and feeling into a single note than most artists could in an entire career. Elvis never sang a song that he wrote, and he never contributed lyrics or melodies; his artistic achievements were not in the realm of song creation. 
But, his talents in song performance away, as he began to hit a rather more than makeup for any lack of painful artistic slump. "Burning Love" composition. Each of these songs is is definitely not his best song and it undeniably Elvis' own, regardless of works almost like self-parody. "In the whose name Ghetto" shows appears after

Elvis 30 #1 Hits
lar release by the Beatles a few years ago, this Elvis album is a compilation of No. 1 hits on the pop, coun­try, R&B and 
U.K. charts. It also is a great introduction to his music as not a single facet of his career is left out, from his early days with Sam Phillips to his years spent singing in Las Vegas. 
The last few 
tracks come 


of his musical from the period 
caree~ the open­when Elvis had 
ing tracks from become the rea­
Elvis' earlier ses­son most artists sions have enough wanted to burn out rather than fade power, energy and old fashioned rock ments. But in the middle of this period.Elvis recorded what is arguably his finest song, "Suspicious Minds." The pro­duction is incredi­ble, something that would make Phil Spector proud. 
One of the marks of a great artist is leaving something worth­while even amongst his poor­est work. If Elvis got a little too slick near the end and roll to sustain any music fan. From the driving "Jailhouse Rock" to the beautiful ballad "Love Me Tender," Elvis' early music remains a high watermark for achievement in rock and roll. 
There is a quote inside the CD case that says, "Before anyone did anything, Elvis did everything." How true that quote is. The importance of Elvis is within his music, not in his movies or clothes. It is easy to write him off as overemphasized or quaint when listen­ing to bands that pride themselves on independent success, artistic credibili­ty, and the ever-present disdain for people who "sell out" to commercial­ism. For fans of such music, Elvis could appear to be the quintessential sellout, the figurehead of all that can go wrong when musical talent and drive is taken over by record labels and outside interests. But those concerns should evaporate when Elvis breaks out his voice and backing band. This is rock and roll at its finest and purest. No one is like Elvis, and no one ever will be like Elvis. He once said that he didn't sound like any other singer and that is tremendously accurate because no one else could be as powerful, as meaning­ful or as necessary as the King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley.

SENDWICH INDEX 
Hokies overtake Hurricanes, Irish at No. 3 
Miami established a new Associated Press Poll record this week with their 19th straight No. 1 ranking, but they remained at No. 2 in the Sendwich Index for the second straight week. 
Florida State kicker Xavier Beitia barely missed a 43­yq.rd field goal attempt as time expired to hand the for­mer No. 3 Seminoles a heart-breaking 28-27 loss at Miami. After four game­deciding missed field goals against the Hurricanes since 1991, Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden might want to think about taking a knee to avoid the agony next time around. 
Miami remained No. 2, just behind new No. 1 Virginia Tech, who gained some steam with a road win over Boston College. Notre Dame, Ohio State and Georgia finish out the top five. Florida State dropped from No. 3 to No. 6 with the loss. 
Horns Get Hooked 
It seems as if each college football season ush­ers in the claims that this is "the year" for Texas. With an 11-point lead in the second quarter against Oklahoma, it looked like this just might be "the year." 
Enter Longhorn-killer Quentin Griffin, who ran wild for 248 yards and added two touchdowns against a Texas team that hadn't allowed a 100­yard runner all season and led the Sooners to a 35-24 victory. We think it's safe to say that Griffin is not the prodigal son of Austin, after this performance and his six-touchdown day against Texas in 2000. 
Texas quarterback and former all-universe recruit Chris Simms completed only 12 passes for 156 yards and threw three interceptions. Not to be outdone, Oklahoma's Nate Hybl also completed only 12 passes and tossed four picks of his own. Hybl. however, was able to connect for two touchdown passes while Simms was shut out. 
Considering the best team that Texas has beaten this year is No. 58 Tulane, it's not sur­prising the Longhorns took a major plunge from No. 16 to No. 33 in the Sendwich Index. Oklahoma moved up three spots to No. 7. 
The Contenders 
Miami and Oklahoma both escaped this week­end undefeated but Virginia Tech, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Georgia, Oregon, North Carolina State, Air Force and Bowling Green all still own perfect records as well. Of course, an undefeat­ed season isn't a prerequisite for a national championship, but it certainly can't hurt. So let's take a look at the chances of these teams finish­ing the regular season with a perfect record. 



The biggest remaining game of the year will occur Dec. 7 when Virginia Tech travels to Miami. Miami's run defense definitely showed holes against Florida State, as Greg Jones ran 
for 191 yards. It should be interesting to see what the Hokies elite ground tandem of Lee Suggs and Kevin Jones can do against the Hurricanes. 
Notre Dame squares off against Air Force this week­end in Colorado Springs, so only one team will exit with a goose egg in the loss col­umn. Air Force's only remaining obstacle is a home game with No. 14 Colorado State. Notre Dame, however, must also play at No. 6 Florida State and No. 13 use. 
Georgia, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Ohio State still must win their remaining anything-can-hap­pen in-conference games in the SEC, Big 12, Pac-10 and Big 10 respectively. Going undefeat­ed in any of these conferences is an accomplish­ment of its own, but Georgia and Oklahoma must also potentially play in their conference championship games. 
Four of untested North Carolina State's next six opponents own winning records, including their final regular season foe, No. 6 Florida State, so it's not looking good for Philip Rivers and friends. 
No. 21 Bowling Green should run the table and end up in the MAC championship. If they can beat likely opponent Marshall, the Falcons won't be in the national championship, but they might lay claim to a BCS bid. 
TOP 5 GAMES TO WATCH FOR WEEK 9 No. 3 Notre Dame at No. 12 Air Force 
Forecast: The Irish contain the Falcons' ground game and leave as the undefeated team. 
No. 10 Iowa State at No. 7 Oklahoma 

Seneca Wallace capitalizes on Oklahoma's let­down and leads the Cyclones to a solid win. 
No. 4 Ohio State at No. 18 Wisconsin 

Forecast: The Buckeyes get yet another run for their money, but somehow manage a victory. 
No. 20 Iowa at No. 31 Indiana 

Forecast: Jerry DiNardo's Hoosier squad pulls off its second upset in as many weeks. 
No. 33 Texas at No. 22 Kansas State 

Forecast: Are these teams for real this year? No, but KSU is more legit than UT this Saturday.

Marta Acsadi and Heather Dziedzic rounded out the team scoring. 
Ultimate frlsbee 
Nashville, Tenn. was the venue for Vanderbilt's Itchfest Invitational this weekend as bolh the mens and womens squads advanced through the early rounds. Veterans Julie Schutte and Naomi Cordell teamed with Junior Shannon Heuer to lead the women as they came out of the blocks strong, easily beating Tulane 7-3 and Tennessee, 13-4. 
The club then defeated Towson 13-0. but lost the services of juniors Jill Scarborough and Katie Twidwell, to injuries. With only seven players remaining, the undermanned club fell to the host Commodores, 13-6. 
On Sunday, the Irish gamely hung on before finally falling in a 6-5 sudden death overtime semi­final to Tennessee. 
The mens team entered both an A and a B squad. The B team overcame an opening round 7-4 halftime deficit to defeat Southern Polytechnical State 11­
10. After defeating Vanderbilt Alumni 13-9, the B squad had its run ended by Georgia Tech, 13-7 
The A squad rolled through the tournament with a bye. a 13-0 whitewash of Vanderbilt B and a solid 13-8 win over Purdue. The Irish continued to advance with a 13-10 win over Tulane and fin­ished the day by drubbing Missouri. 13-4. 
On Sunday. the Irish defeated Towson 13-6 in the semifinals, setting up a showdown with top­seeded Tennessee. The Irish bat­tled back to claim their final lead at 12-11, before a rush at the end enabled the Volunteers to prevail 14-12. The Irish claimed third place among the eighteen competing teams. 

Mens water polo 
The mens water polo club will host next weekend's a Great Lakes Conference Championship, with a berth in the Nationals o.n the line. 
In the final conference round­robin this past weekend, the Irish first scheduled opponent, Ball State, forfeited the match. In the second round, play Notre Dame had little difficulty with Toledo with Danny Wiederkehr and Rory Clear leading the scor­ing onslaught. Jay Deimel John Penilla, Keith Rauenbuehler, Greg Krouse and Pat Watts com­pleted the scoring, while a swarming press defense limited the Rockets' offense, resulting in a 22-4 runaway. 
The Irish then found them­selves facing Grand Valley State and in another classic, the Lakers earned a 17 -12 victory. Rauenbuehler's five goals paced the Irish attack, while Rory Cleary added four. Brendan Doherty frustrated shooters all day in goal. 
In the anticlimactic final, the Irish overpowered Lewis, 16-3. The Irish used this game to work on their 6 on 5 offensive sets as Lewis had a player ejection and played the match shorthanded. John Becher and Ryan Downey scored their first collegiate goals. while Deimel and Devlin McCormick split duties in goal 
Mens rowing 
The Notre Dame mens crew club opened its season at the Head of the Hock in Rockford, Ill. The club finished seventh in the mens point standings with 53 points.

49ers improve to 4-1 with 28-21 win over the Seahaw-ks 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE 

Terrell Owens had some fun at Shawn Springs' expense ­twice. 
Not only did the All-Pro receiver catch a 37-yard touch­down pass over the Seattle cor­nerback to give San Francisco a 28-21 win over the Seahawks, but he added an extra flourish by pulling out a pen and auto­graphing the ball for a mutual friend sitting in Springs' suite. 
Seattle (1-4) led 21-20 and was driving for another score when Ahmad Plummer inter­cepted an ill-advised pass by Trent Dilfer at the San Francisco 32 with 10 minutes left. The 49ers 
one game ahead of Arizona in the NFC West. The 49ers won the division 14 times between 1981 and 1997. 
The Seahawks, who moved this year from the AFC West to the NFC West, took little conso­lation from the loss despite play­ing well. 
"J don't think you can take any satisfaction from losing whatso­ever," said Dilfer, who lost for the third time in four starts this season after 15 straight victo­ries, most of them with Super Bowl-winning Baltimore two years ago. "In this league you continue to try to get better."

Owens then took a pen from his sock and signed the ball. 
"I just tried to be creative," Owens said. "I was just trying to have fun. It was a situation where l knew we would be going to the end zone in the fourth quarter." 
Garcia then hit Garrison llcarst for a 2-point conversion. 
"He was talking the most trash, how he was going to do this and do that," said San Francisco running back Kevan Barlow, also a friend of Springs. "Our big-time player showed him. Terrell's a beast." 
The win kept the 49ers (4-1) finished with 
six catches for 
84 yards. 
The field goal came on a 73­yard drive off the opening kick­off. 
Then Zack Bronson, who later left the game with a broken foot, intercepted a pass by Dilfer on Seattle's first possession. The 49ers took six plays to complete the drive when Garcia rolled right and found Owens all alone on the goal line and he stepped into the end zone -no auto­graph on that one. 
Stiattle retaliated immediately, going 69 yards in 10 plays to score on Dilfer's 5-yard touch­down pass to Mack Strong with 
1:45 left in the first quarter. 

Reuters San Francisco wide receiver Tai Streets breaks the tackle of Seattle defensive back Ken Lucas. The 49ers went on to win 28-21 and take command of the NFC West. 
Dilfer had two critical third-and­long completions to Bobby Engram to keep the drive alive. 
Then Engram struck again. He took Jason Baker's punt at his 39, broke a tackle by Jong snap­per Brian Jennings and was free, weaving his way 61 yards to give Seattle a 14-10 lead with 
5:41 left until halftime. 
Cortez's 29-yard field goal on the next drive made it 14-13 and that's the way the half ended. 
The 49ers' first possession of the second half was their best ­a 12-play, 99-yard drive primar-ily on the ground capped by Barlow's 6-yard run off left tackle for a 20-14 lead. 


"We took the opportunity to let the defense rest and recover," Garcia said. "We took it 99 yards. That's huge, That can be a game-winner." 
It wasn't quite then. 
Back came Seattle. Shaun Alexander went 42 yards on the first play from scrimmage, then capped the 76-yard drive with a 1-yard run with 1:11 left in the third quarter to make it 21-20. 
But in the end, it wasn't enough to hold down Owens ­and his pen. The beneficiary was Greg Eastman, a financial consultant to Owens, Springs and Barlow -who said that if he had scored in the fourth quarter, he would have done the same thing. 
But the show was Owens, who two years ago provoked a dis­turbance in Dallas by dancing twice on the star at midfield after scoring against the Cowboys. 
"Everybody's always saying I'm being disrespectful," he said. "But I'm just trying to have fun." 

NHL 
Lemieux scores two in Pens' win 
Associated Press 
TORONTO 

Mario Lemieux wasn't about to let the Toronto Maple Leafs humiliate his team again. 
Lemieux scored twice and assisted on Aleksey Morozov's two power-play goals as the Pittsburgh Penguins recovered from their worst opening-game loss ever with a 5-4 victory over the Maple Leafs. 
Morozov also had two assists for the Penguins, who have won two straight following Thursday's 6-0 home loss to Toronto. 
"It's not revenge, but we were embarrassed in the first game," Lemieux said. "All hockey players have pride. You have to come back and play better and that's what we did." 
Lemieux, who also had two goals in Saturday's 6-0 victory over the New York Rangers, scored the game-winner on the power play with 2:18 left when his shot from the behind the net deflected off Trevor Kidd's pads. 
"They came in our house and abused us in the first game," goalie Johan Hedberg said. "We really wanted to come here and beat them." 
Tie Domi, Mats Sundin, Darcy Tucker and Alexander Mogilny scored power-play goals for the Maple Leafs, who have lost two straight. 
Mogilny appeared to score the tying goal with 24 seconds remaining, but it was taken away after it was ruled that Toronto's Shayne Corson knocked the net off its moor­ings before the puck went in .. 
"I thought it was a goal for sure," Corson said. "The puck was in before it came off." 
After Domi gave Toronto a 1­0 lead early in the first, Lemieux tied it with his third goal of the season and the 657th of his career. 
He fired a slap shot past Kidd at 10:01. 
Sundin gave Toronto the lead again with his 400th career goal. Ile received a standing ovation after Mogilny found him alone at the side of the net. 
''I'll cherish that. It was awe­some, but too bad we didn't get the two points," Sundin said.

SAN FRANCISCO At long last, Barry Bonds will get his chance. 
Kenny Lofton hit an RBI single with two outs in the ninth inning that sent Bonds to his first World Series as the San Francisco Giants beat the St. Louis Cardinals 2-1 Monday night to win the NL championship series. 
Bonds did his part in Game 5, hitting a tying sac­rifice fly in the eighth off a determined Matt Morris. And now, in his 17th sea­son, baseball's biggest star will finally get a chance to play on baseball's biggest stage. 

Bonds, often criticized for being selfish and not inter­acting with his teammates, led the sprint from the Giants' dugout to congratu­late Lofton. The four-time MVP was the first player off the bench to reach him. 
"We played great,"Bonds said. "We've got a tough series ahead of us. The Angels have been playing great in the clutch. It's going to be down to the wire with them. 
"We've got some gusty guys out here. just like the Angels,"he said. "Who would've thought two wild­card teams would make it? That's just amazing." 
The Cardinals, playing on emotion since the death of Darryl Kile in June, once again could not get a big hit when it counted. 
And the Giants took advantage, breaking through against Morris to tie it in the eighth. In the ninth, Morris retired the first two batters before David Bell and Shawon Dunston singled. 
At that point, Steve Kline relieved and Lofton pulled the first pitch into right field. Bell scored easily, sending the Giants to their first World Series since 1989 as the sellout crowd of 42,673 erupted at Pacific Bell Park. 
Lofton especially enjoyed the party, having been booed at Busch Stadium last week when his objec­tion to an inside pitch trig­gered a bench-clearing skirmish. 
"It's an awesome feeling at this point,"Lofton said. 
Bonds, at 38, jumped up and down with the NLCS MVP, 37-year-old catcher Benito Santiago. 
Bonds got the chance of a lifetime in the eighth, com­ing up with the bases loaded, one out and the Giants down 1-0. The home-run king and first­time batting champion delivered -sort of -with a fly ball that evened it.

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. 
Penn State officials have called for a comprehensive review of Big Ten football after controversial calls in its two overtime losses and disciplinary action taken against officials after another conference game. 
"I am of the opinion that Big Ten officiating has not met the usual high standards associated with the Big Ten in all areas," Penn State athletic director Tim Curley said in a statement. 
"We realize officials will make mistakes, but we have seen too many instances in not only our games, but other conference games, that Penn State is no longer comfortable with this trend." 
Curley said he had asked com­missioner Jim Delany to review policies on crew assignments, performance evaluation. tech­nology, accountability, recruit­ment and training of officials. 
The statement did not mention specific concerns. but a contro­versial call might have cost Penn ·St...~;; ::. chwr1~e for a game-week off to study for midterms. They look to come back from break strong and ready to com­pete in the playoffs.

Lions lost 27-24 in overtime. 
In the last minute of regula­tion, Tony Johnson was called out of bounds after a catch along the left sideline near the Michigan 20. Television replays appeared to show Johnson land­ing with both feet in bounds. 
Delany said in a statement that the conference would look into Penn State's complaint. 
"In the spirit of openness. as we have done previously with other Big Ten institutions, we have asked Penn State for a detailed critique of its concerns and will provide a candid and detailed response," he said. 
After Penn State's 42-35 over­time loss to Iowa on Sept. 28, coach Joe Paterno sprinted down the field and grabbed the jersey of a referee to complain about two calls. Paterno, who was not punished after the inci­dent, did not say what calls he was complaining about, bu! Johnson also had a sideline catch in that game during over­time. One oflicial ruled the catch good, but a second official over­turned the call. ruling that Johnson was out of bounds. 
The Big Ten disciplined four game officials Oct. 2 after deter­mining they did a poor job dur­ing a Sept. 21 game between Wake Forest and Purdue. Delany said the four "did not officiate well enough to meet Big Ten standards" and would for­feit future officiating assign­ments.

Hob Globke notched his first career hat trick and John Wroblewski scored twice to lead Notre Dame to a 5-3 win over the Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs Saturday at the Duluth Entertainment and Convention Center. 
Senior goaltender Tony Zasowski, making his first start since Dec. 1, 2001, shook off some early rust to make 39 saves to backstop the Irish to the win. 
Globkc scored all three goals in the third period using his speed and skill to beat the Bulldog defense. His first goal of the night, at 3 minutes, 13 seconds of the third period gave Notre Dame its first lead of the weekend. Connor Dunlop wrapped the puck around the boards to fresh­man Tim Wallace. Wallace hit Globke in stride at center ice and the junior snapped a wrist shot past Bulldog goaltender Isaac Reichmuth for his first goal of the night. 
UMD tied the game at 13:28 when Tyler Brosz redirected Drew Otten's shot from the left wing boards past Zasowski to even the score at 3-3. 
Globke's second goal of the night proved to be the game winner at 14:46 of the third period. Defenseman Brett l.ebda found Globke near the right wing circle and he whipped it past Reichmuth for a 4-3 lead. 
The big ·right wing sealed the win when he scored into Lhe empty net with 18 seconds left as Wroblewski broke up a Bulldog rush at center ice and slid it to Globke as he skated through center. 
The Irish started the night on an ominous note as they allowed Minnesota-Duluth to jump out to a 2-0 first-period 
lead  on  goals  by  Luke  
Stauffacher  and  Jon  
Francisco.  

Stauffacher got the Bulldogs on the scoreboard just 1:45 into the game when he redi­rected Marco Peluso's shot from the left point between goaltender Tony Zasowski's pads for the 1-0 lead. 
With Jake Wiegand off for crosschecking, UMD's power play clicked. Junior Lessard fired a shot from the right cir­cle that Zasowski stopped but couldn't control the rebound. The Bulldogs top returning scorer, senior center Jon Francisco was there to flip the rebound over the Zasowski for the 2·0 lead at 15:39. 
The Irish were able to cut the lead to 2·1 with a power­play goal of their own at 
17:17. Rob Globke found John Wroblewski all alone in front with a great pass from the top of the left circle. Wroblewski outwaited goaltender Isaac Reichmuth and fired the puck from the top of the crease under the crossbar for his first goal of the season. 
Wroblewski wasn't finished with just the power-play goal. He tied the game for Notre Dame with a shorthanded tally in the second. 
With T.J Mathieson off for an interference call, the speedy Wroblewski stepped in front of a Minnesota-Duluth pass at the Notre Dame blue line and it was off to the races. 
The senior went in on Reichmuth all alone, deked the freshman goaltender to the ice and drilled a wrist shot from between the hashmarks at 11 :09 to knot the score at 2­
2. The shorthanded goal was the first of Wroblewski's career. 
Zasowski turned in one of the best nights of his career with 39 saves on the night, just one off his career-high of 40 saves. The senior was espe­cially sharp after the first period as he made 30 of his saves in those two periods, giving up just one goal. 
Notes: 
. 
The Irish got late game heroics from sophomore left wing Yan Stastny and goal­tender Morgan Cey turned in another brilliant performance in goal as the Irish rallied for a 2-2 tie versus the Bulldogs. The season-opening tie was played in front of 3,321 fans at the Duluth Entertainment and Convention Center Friday night. 

. 
With the Irish trailing and time running out, Notre Dame got an icing call with 1 :07 left in the game. Coach Dave Poulin called timeout and pulled Cey in favor of a sixth attacker. Connor Dunlop won the faceoff to the left of UMD goaltender Rob Anderson. The draw went to Evan Nielsen who's pass to Brett Lebda going to the net was behind him. Lebda tracked the puck down in the right wing corner and slid it in front to Stastny who slid the puck under Anderson for the 2-2 tie. 



Special to the Observer 
Senior Greg Tait who regis­tered four saves in Notre Dame's 1-0 overtime victory at Boston College on Saturday has been named the Big East Conference Goalkeeper of the Week. He earns the honors for the second time in his career and becomes the third Irish player to earn one of the con­ference's weekly awards this season. 
Tait has started the last two games in goal for Notre Dame, filling in for sophomore Chris Sawyer who was injured in the game against Pittsburgh. Tait also posted a shutout in the Irish's 1-0 road win at Akron and came up with five saves in the contest. 
Tait played the final 47 min­utes, 48 seconds of the 1-0 overtime loss to tho Panthers and was in goal when the Pittsburgh tallied the game­winning score. 
Tait has played in four con­tests overall and has allowed two goals in 256:32 of action. He owns a 0. 70 goals against average and .875 save per­centage. 
Sophomore Luke Boughen has been named to College Soccer News' Team of the Week after leading the Irish in victory over the Golden Eagles. 
Boughen netted the game­winner at the 93:36 mark of the contest off an assist from teammate Chad Riley as Notre Dame defeated its third ranked opponent of the sea­son, a first for an Irish team since the 1996 campaign. 
The Irish midfielder has played in all 12 of Notre Dame's games this season and has scored three goals. 
He scored the first two goals of his career in the squad's 5­1 victory over Providenc·e College earlier in the season. His score against Boston College marked the first game­
winning goal of his career.  
Boughen stands fifth  on  the  
team  in  scoring  with  six  
points.

The close match was an improvement for the Belles after the outcome of the last meeting between these two teams, when Adrian outscored Saint Mary's 90-50 in three games.

The last time Notre Dame played Georgetown. the Irish were taken to five games by the Hoyas in a tightly-contested match. This time around. the Irish had it much easier. 
Continuing its strong confer­ence play, the Notre Dame vol­leyball team defeated Georgetown 30-26, 31-29. 30­
21. On Sunday. the Irish beat Villanova 30-25. 28-30, 30-28. 30-17. 
"All I remember about last year's game is that it was really exciting, a heated match, a huge rivalry." outside hitter Emily Loomis said. "[On Saturday.] we played well. came out strong and beat them handily." 
Despite hitting under .200 in games one and two, the Irish were able to pull out those two games and they cruised in game three with a .429 hitting percent­age. The difference in the two games was simple. 
"We finally just came out and executed," Loomis said. 
Outside hitter Lauren Kelbley led Notre Dame (15-3, 6-0 in the Big East) with 13 kills against Georgetown {12-7, 3-2). The freshman recorded a .611 hitting percentage -the highest hitting percentage for an Irish player this season. For her efforts over the weekend, Kelbley was named co-Big East Rookie of the Year on Monday. 
"Lauren has been big for us all year," Loomis said. "She really came out and played awesome in the 1st tournament and she has the capability to do that in every game. She played awesome this weekend." 
Loomis had 11 kills and middle blocker Katie Neff had 13. Keara Coughlin led Notre Dame defen­sively with 11 digs. 
Georgetown had a difficult time hitting against Notre Dame as the Hoyas hit .044 and .074 in games two and three. For the match, Georgetown had a .078 hitting percentage, 

Notre Dame coach Debbie Brown was able to play all 15 of her players in Sunday's four­game \-Vin over Villanova (10-13, 1-5). Four players recorded dou­ble-digit kills for the Irish. Middle blocker Lauren Brewster and Neff each had 12. Brewster led Notre Dame ½ith a .440 hit­ting percentage. 
Kelbley killed 13 and had a team-best seven blocks. Loomis played well again, leading the Irish with 16 kills and 15 digs. 
Despite the filled-out stat sheet, Loomis wasn't happy with dropping a game to the Wildcats. "I think we did a terrible job with our serving -we missed 17 serves," she said. "That gave them a lot of points and left us without the opportunity to score." 
The Irish are currently on a seven-game winning streak and they have won 12 of their last 13 matches.

Stanford takes out.Morrissey in hard-fought game 
ByJUSTIN SCHUVER, LISA 
REIJUl.A, and HEATHER VAN 
HOEGARDEN Sports Writers 
Wide receiver Adam Oyster and the rest of the Stanford Griffins found a pearl Sunday as they handed Morrissey its first loss this season with a come-from-behind 12-7 win. 
The win guarantees the Griffins (3-1) a playoff spot in this year's postseason. 
"We needed this win to make sure we were going to make it," said Oyster, who also serves as team captain. 
His team was not sharp early in the game, when a high snap on a punt gave Morrissey (2-1) excellent field position. The Manorites were able to take advantage of the short field and scored on a 5-yard touch­down pass from quarterback Rick Ysasi to tight end David Purcell. 
The extra point kick was good, to give Morrissey a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. 

The Griffins' next punt included another mistake, but this one was in the team's favor, as the Manorite returner muffed the punt and Stanford recovered it. 
The Griffins were able to drive 44 yards on the ensuing drive, culminating with a 3­yard quarterback keeper by quarterback Rich Whitney to put Stanford on the board. 
Stanford, who was without a kicker, failed its two-point con­version attempt, making the score 7-6. 
The score remained 7-6 until the fourth quarter. With less than three minutes remaining in the game, Stanford was able to complete a drive from its own 14-yard line. 
The scoring play was a 9­yard touchdown pass from Whitney to Oyster with less than a minute remaining in the game. Again the two-point attempt failed, making the score 12-7. 
"[That catch] felt really great for our team," Oyster said. "We played hard the whole game and I was just happy our team came away with the win." 
The Griffin sideline celebrat­ed and cheered, but there was still time for the Manorites to engineer an answer. This drive was extinguished when a Griffin defensive back inter­cepted Ysasi, leaving only a kneel by Whitney to make the game official. 
Oyster credited his team's defensive coach Matt Sollitto for putting together an excel-

Sports Editor 
Irish punter Joey Hildbold came into the game more times than most everyone associated with the Irish would have liked. 
But as the Notre Dame offense failed to move the ball most of the day, it constantly turned to Hildbold and the punt team to bury the Panthers deep in their own territory. 
Saturday, they came through. 
"Our punt team is great," Hildbold said after the game Saturday. "We have great cover­age and great protection. We work on it every week, two to three times a week." 
Hildbold had nine punts Saturday, averaging 39.0 yards per punt. But the important stats were that Pittsburgh only got 4.6 yards per return due to Hildbold's kicking and the punt team's solid coverage. 
Pittsburgh's average field posi­tion Saturday was at its own 23­yard line. Giving the Panthers a long field to work with enabled the Notre Dame defense to be largely successful in keeping Pittsburgh off the scoreboard. 
"You always enjoy being the factor in the game." Hildbold said. "I think a lot of times field position is a big part of the game, so we're always going to be a fac­tor." 
Three of Hildbold's punts put the Panthers up against a wall inside their 20-yard line, while another barely snuck into the end zone for a touchback. 
The biggest of these plays could have been Hildbold's punt with roughly 9 minutes, 30 sec­onds left in the game that sailed out at Pittsburgh's 7-yard line. 
On the Panthers' second play from deep in their territory, Irish safety Glenn Earl hit quarterback Rod Rutherford to force a fum­ble, recovering the ball for the Irish. 
The Notre Dame offense then only had 12 yards to go for its eventual touchdown. 
"[Downing a punt near the goal line] is critical, because what it does in most cases is that it changes the offensive scheme that they bring to you," Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said. "So if we can force them to back up, then they have to be con­scious of the fact that a mistake down there leads to an easy score. So they change their calls, and maybe get a little more con­servative. It allows us to pack things in and hopefully get to three and out, then all of a sud­den you're starting to get control ofthe football game." 
On the other hand. Pittsburgh punter Andy Lee failed to take advantage of his opportunities to pin the Irish offense deep in its own territory. Lee's first four punt attempts came from within Notre Dame's 42-yard line, and all sailed into the end zone for touchbacks. Only one of his nine punts on the day landed inside Notre Dame's 20-yard line. 
"If the team has to go 80 yards, that's not as bad as the team having to go 95 yards," Hildbold said. "Getting the ball in there, down inside the 5 and 10, like coach said before, changes their whole offense."
