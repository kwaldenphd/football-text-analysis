Abroad students travel to Belfast 
Dublin Program trip focuses on political, religious divides within Northern Ireland

BELFAST -There's a lot of baggage that comes with being Irish and Catholic in this city. Or Irish and Protestant, for that matter. 
Notre Dame students may not often have reason to think about these challenges, given the pep­band air which surrounds any campus expression of their uni­versity's traditional heritage. But last weekend, the students of Notre Dame's Dublin Program traveled to Northern Ireland's capital to see firsthand about the political and religious divides that have troubled this island's northern end for generations. 
Between meeting with a rep­resentative of the Sinn Fein political party and touring Catholic and Protestant neigh­borhoods, students were able to learn experientially about life north of the border. 
The group drove north on Oct. 13, over ground where program director Kevin Whelan said snipers used to lie in wait. Upon arrival, they toured Stormont, the home of the Northern Ireland Assembly -a legislative body which has not met since October 2002 because of tension

"Last spring, in talking to friends, we realized that there isn't really an informed opinion about [the death penalty] on campus," Laidman said. ·"Everyone had very strong opin­ions, but they didn't really have

Given the debate surrounding the death penalty within the Catholic Church, Notre Dame, as a Catholic University, should address it. 
That's the philosophy of Notre Dame Against State Killing (NDASK), a new student organi­zation. 
The group will launch its first event this fall with a series of lectures to educate students about the death penalty. 
NDASK co-organizers junior Andrea Laidman and senior Will McAuliffe -who is also an Observer columnist -described the organization as a campaign under the direction of the Center for Social Concerns and

lnbox warnings of over­flowing e-mail accounts may be a thing of the past at Saint Mary's next semester as the College prepares to install a new messaging sys­tem during winter break, Chief Information Officer Keith Fowlkes said. 
The current e-mail system -iPlanet Messaging, known on campus as Aegis and developed by Sun Microsystems -has been "showing its age" in the past few months, Fowlkes said.

ND given Katrina recognition 
University one of nine to receive award 
By RYAN SYDLIK 
News Writer 
Notre Dame's service in Katrina-ravaged areas has done even more than improve the lives of the 
storm's victims - it's  won  
the  University  national  
recognition.  

Notre Dame was one of nine U.S. universities to receive the Katrina Compassion Award for Excellence in Hurricane Relief Service award from the Corporation for National and Community Service, the nation's largest independent grant-maker for the support of service and volunteerism. 
In addition to the award for Katrina relief efforts, the corporation also gave Notre Dame an award for its over­all mission of service. 
Bill Purcell, assistant pro­fessional specialist at the Center for Social Concerns, said the corporation was likely impressed by the quick and comprehensive nature of Notre Dame's relief efforts. 
The University reacted to the tragedy through a vari­ety of prayer services, fundraising efforts and forums to discuss national issues that resulted in the aftermath.

Professor stresses career vocation 
Talk examines views ofwomen, working; encourages balance 
By ABBY RICHARDSON 
News Writer 
The challenge of balanc­ing both a career and fami­ly -a thought that worries many college students ­served as the focus of Boston University professor Claire Wolfteich's Tuesday night talk at Saint Mary's. 
As a professor and moth­er of three, Wolfteich came to the College's Stapleton Lounge as part of the Center for Spirituality's 
2006 Endowed Fall Lecture series to discuss the chang­ing views of women in the workplace. 
"Work is a vocation," Wolfteich said. "Women are primarily seen as mothers." 
This stereotype, she said, has historically been a threat to women working outside the house. Over time, however, more women have dissolved that image and pursued careers, she said. 
Wolfteich said this change has also stemmed from the religious world, and she reminded the audience of papal encyclicals that encouraged women to ven­ture into the workplace. 
In a 1995 encyclical, the late Pope John Paul II specifically thanks "women who work," she said, which allows women to fulfill their desire to work. 
"Work does influence women's life in many ways," Wolfteich said. 
Careers give women a chance to redefine them­selves and their lives, she said, and allows them to reshape their devotional life. 
Wolfteich encouraged the women in the room to rec­ognize their job as a voca­tion -something that not many do, she said, espe­cially if work does not involve service or suffer-

Let yourself fall behind 
this vveekend 
Believe it or not, it's still fall. And it will be until Dec. 22. 
That's nearly two more months of the leaves changing, football, sweatshirts and mitten-less hands. Right? 
Not exactly. Winter has come

We haven't even changed our clocks back 
News Writer 

for daylight sav­ing time yet. 
We have woken up more than once to snow on the ground in October. 
The heat is on in the dorms. Halloween? Please-Christmas is in the air. 
For the first time in years, I don't think I'll be opposed to hearing Christmas music by Thanksgiving. 
Even though it may feel like win­ter, rest assured that fall isn't fin­ished. 
There are still things to look for­ward to, despite the weather mak­ing it seem otherwise. 
One of those things is happening at the end of the week. You guessed it. Daylight saving time is around the corner. 
That being said, this is now a public service announcement to set your clocks back one hour this Sunday. 
Being from the East Coast, I know most Indiana residents are opposed to daylight saving time for various reasons (crops, farms, cows?), but I'm sure no college student would complain about an extra hour of sleep ... especially after a Saturday night. 
My favorite part about changing the clocks back is that Sunday is a 25-hour day. 
Have you ever heard the expres­sion, "There aren't enough hours in the day"? 
Have no fear. Now there are. 25 hours in one day. 
There are so many things you could do with that extra hour, so don't waste it. Or maybe that's exactly what you want to do. Take that extra hour and put it into pro­ductive sleep time. 
Whatever daylight saving time brings for you, just enjoy this little gift of extra time to relieve the stress of the day, relax or be pro­ductive. 
Before you know it we will be setting the clocks forward and, I don't know about you, but I won't be celebrating the 23-hour day.

Principal returns to school after "wedgie" Incident 
LIVINGSTON, Mont. ­The principal of Park High School returned to school Tuesday after a six-day suspension for giving a student a "wedgie. "'The Livingston School District Board held a special meeting Monday and approved Superintendent Hannibal Anderson's rec­ommendation that Principal Eric Messerli be allowed to return to work. 
"It has been clearly rec­ognized and stated that the behavior is inappro­priate, unprofessional and unacceptable," Anderson said. 
Messerli's behavior "warrants substantial dis­ciplinary action" but was not sufficient grounds for a recommendation for ter­mination, he said. 
Messerli was suspended for two days without pay and four days with pay for grabbing a Park High senior's soccer jersey and pulling it over his head and giving the student a "wedgie" by pulling up on the waist band of his underwear.

STUDENT SENATE 

Group passes stricter ballot access standards 
18-4 vote raises requirement to 200 signatures 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Editor 
Students wishing to run for class officer positions will now face stricter ballot access standards, thanks to a constitutional amendment passed by the Student Senate Wednesday. 
Previously, class officer candidates -who run for office in teams of four (presi­dent, vice president, secre­tary and treasurer) -had to obtain 100 signatures from members of their class in order to get their names on the ballot. 
But in an 18-4 vote, sena­
tors  voted  to  raise  that  
requirement to  200 signa­ 
tures.  

St. Edward's senator Brian Lan crafted the amendment, which came out of the Senate Oversight committee. The stricter requirement ls not meant to deter students from running for office, Lan said. Instead, it merely forces can­didates to gather support from a larger percentage of the class. 
"It was so easy to get .on 
the ballot [by getting 100 signatures] .... Now, this shouldn't change who is on the ballot, but it will get a better representation." 
Gathering 200 votes is about 10 perct;Jnt of a given class at Notre Dame -a standard that, Lan believes, is more comparable to the 700 signatures that student body presidential and vice presidential candidates must gather in order to run for those offices. 
In other Senate news: 
+ The third and final stu­dent-alumni reception will take place Nov. 3 -but the location has not yet been determined, said University Affairs committee chair Aly Baumgartner. Film, televi­sion and the ate r majors should try to attend the event, Baumgartner said, since prominent alums work­ing in the entertainment industry will probably go to the reception when they are on campus that weekend.

Polish archbishop to visit ND 
.Zycinski to give lecture, participate in a public forum on evolution 
Special to The Observer 
Archbishop Jozef Zycinski of Lublin, Poland will visit the University of Notre Dame from Oct. 31 to Nov. 3 [Tuesday to Friday] and on Nov. 1 will present the 
.----=-------, University's 2 0 0 6 Nanovic Institute Distinguished European Lecture and participate in a public forum on Zycinski evolution and Catholicism. Both events are free and open to the public. 
The Nanovic lecture will take place at 8 p.m. in the auditori­um of the University's Hesburgh Center for International Studies. Titled "Neighbors? Jews and Catholics in Post-Shoah Poland," the presentation is sponsored by the Nanovic Institute. 
The public forum, sponsored by Notre Dame's Reilly Center for Science, Technology and Values; Nanovic Institute for European Studies; Jacques Maritain Center; Departments of Biology, Theology, Philosophy and the Program of Liberal Studies, is titled "Evolution and Catholic Faith: Is There a Conflict?" The event will be held from 3 to 4:30 
p.m. in Room 101 of Notre Dame's Jordan Hall of Science and will feature remarks from a panel of Notre Dame faculty members, a response from the archbishop, and an audience question-and-answer session. Structured for a general inter­est audience, this forum will examine this issue in light of some discussions of evolution by the Church that included a meeting at the Vatican in July. 
Appointed Archbishop of Lublin in 1997, Archbishop Zycinski also serves as grand chancellor of the John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, where his research focuses on the history and philosophy of science and the relationship between science and evolution. He is the author of the forth­coming book "God and Evolution: Fundamental Questions of Christian Evolutionl.sm." He has worked to promote Jewish-Catholic relations in the diocese of Lublin. 
Ordained to the priesthood in 1972 following studies at the Czestochowa Major Seminary in Krakow, Archbishop Zycinski holds degrees in phi­losophy, theology and the phi­losophy of science. He has held the Chair of Logic and Methodology at Krakow's Papal Academy of Theology since 1980 and served as the vice-dean and dean of the academy's faculty of philoso­phy from 1982 to 1985 and 1988 to 1990, respectively. 
Archbishop Zycinski holds numerous public positions, including chair of the Bishops' Council for the Laity and the Program Committee of KAI [Catholic Information Agency]. He also serves on the Polish Bishops' Commissions for the Doctrine of the Faith and for Pastoral Care and holds mem­berships in the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, the Committee for Philosophical Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN). and PAN's Committee on Evolutionary and Theoretical Biology. 
Archbishop Zycinski is the author of 40 books and more than 350 published journal articles. He founded the jour­nal series "Philosophy in Science," published by PAN, the Vatican Observatory and the University of Arizona.

helps Right to Life and Amnesty International to turn their focus to their other issues because it assumes responsibility for edu­cating students about the death penalty, McAuliffe said. 
"With us focusing solely on this issue, they don't have to divert any of their own resources within their group." 
NDASK's mission goes beyond educating students on Notre Dame's campus. Its long-term goal is to work toward estab­lishing a moratorium on the death penalty in the state of Indiana. 
"It's not a one-year goal," Laidman said. "This is going to be a lasting campaign on the campus. It takes so much mobi­lization to campaign for [a moratorium on the death penal­ty] at the state level." 
The group has a list of around 100 members, Laidman said, but a core team of about five has organized the group. 
The organization has planned poster campaigns, information sessions, a trip to Indiana's death row in Michigan City and an upcoming lecture series this fall. 
The lecture series will intro­duce a human element to com­plement statistics and figures, Laidman said. The speakers for the lecture series each bring a unique viewpoint on the death penalty, she said. 
"We want people to hear these different stories, then draw the statistics and facts together with them," Laidman said. 
Thomas Anthony Durkin, a 1968 Notre Dame graduate and a lawyer in Chicago, will speak Nov. 1 in the Annenberg Auditorium of the Snite Museum about his role in estab­lishing a moratorium on the death penalty in Illinois. 
Geographically, Indiana is in a good position because it is next to Illinois and moratorium advocates can draw on its resources in their fight against the death penalty, McAuliffe said. 
McAuliffe said Deacon George Brooks, director of advocacy and jail chaplain for Kolbe House, the Archdiocese of Chicago's prison and jail min­istry, will speak Nov. 8 in the Hesburgh Center Auditorium about seeing murderers as chil­dren of God. 
Former Indiana Gov. Joseph Kernan will speak Nov. 15 in the Coleman-Morse Student Lounge about his feelings on the death penalty. 
Kernan has said he supports the death penalty in principle, but believes it should only be used in the most serious cases. 
Indiana State Senator John Broden, a 1987 graduate of Notre Dame, will speak Nov. 29 at the same location. He cur­rently serves as a member of the Indiana Assessment Team of the American Bar Association's Death Penalty Moratorium Implementation Project. 
A forum will be held in the spring semester to continue the conversation about the death penalty. 
This is an issue that "can real­ly attract students from a diverse background of inter­ests," said Laidman, explaining that the death penalty debate involves legal, political and moral aspects. 
"It seems that in learning about it students become more and more interested," she said.

Purcell said Notre Dame's connections as a Catholic university were extremely

Executions mark new government 
BUJUMBURA, Burundi -Burundi's spy agency has executed 38 people and arbitrar­ily detained 200 others since the Central African nation's new government came to power, a rights group said Wednesday. 
New York-based Human Rights Watch accused President Pierre Nkurunziza year­old government of failing to prosecute those accused of extra-judicial killings. A security official acknowledged some officers had committed human rights abuses, but said the cases were isolated and that those responsible were punished. 
"Since the new government took office, the intelligence service has been free to use any means necessary, including killing and tor­ture, to reach its goals," the group's Alison des Forges said in a report. "The govern­ment must address this pattern of continu­ing violations." 
Tropical Storm Paul weakening 
SAN JOSE DEL CABO, Mexico -Tropical Storm Paul quickly lost strength Wednesday as it swirled toward Mexico's mainland at the tip of the Baja California peninsula. 
About 100 residents who were evacuated to government shelters in Cabo San Lucas were heading back to their homes, relieved the sun had re-emerged and they had been spared by Paul, which earlier in the week had been the season's third hurricane to threaten the region. 
The storm was forecast to continue weak­ening, but it was moving quickly toward mainland Mexico. It was expected to make landfall later Wednesday and could dump as much as 10 inches of rain and spark dangerous flooding, according to the hurri­cane center in Miami.

Arizona official will resign 
PHOENIX-State Treasurer David Petersen will resign and plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to report $4,200 in commis­sions for selling character-education materials to schools, Attorney General Terry Goddard said Wednesday. 
Petersen was to appear Wednesday in Maricopa County Superior Court for arraign­ment on the misdemeanor count that conclud­ed a months-long investigation that originally centered on allegations of theft, fraud and con­flict of interest. 
A memo from Goddard said the investigation found no evidence that Petersen stole or mis­used public money, though "numerous issues pertaining to defendant's performance of his duties and management of his office were found to be outside the scope of a criminal investigation." 


New York taxi fare increased by $1 
NEW YORK-The cost of standing still, like everything else in New York City, is going up. 
The price of an average cab ride increased by $1 when the city Taxi and Limousine Commission voted unanimously Wednesday to double the amount charged on the meter when a taxi sits idly in traffic. 
The unanimous vote puts New York's wait time in the same range as other major U.S. cities, where the cost of sitting runs about $20 to $30 an hour, according to the commis­sion.

Bush: No 'simple solution' to war 
President dissatisfied with death toll and raids, still confident in Iraqi abilities 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Many Americans are unhappy with the war in Iraq, and President Bush said Wednesday he is dissatis­fied, too. But he does not want the United States to change direction, pull out or set timetables for withdraw­al. 
Bush came to the White House's East Room and delivered an impassioned defense of the long and unpopular war, arguing that to leave now would mean defeat. His appearance came 13 days before elec­tions in which Republicans fear Iraq could cost them control of the House, Senate or both. 
While saying he was open to recommendations from a blue-ribbon commission exploring U.S. options in Iraq, Bush cautioned, "The road to victory will not be easy. We should not expect a simple solution." 
"Our goals are unchang­ing," the president said. "We are flexible in our methods to achieving those goals." 

Bush expressed unwaver­ing confidence in Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, the U.S. generals running the war and Iraq's prime minister, Nouri al­Maliki, despite new strains between Baghdad and Washington. Bush's handling of Iraq, and month have been a serious support. Al-Maliki said the

Anti-terror progran1s to face revisions 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Two anti­terrorism ID programs have been sent back to the drawing board and a third is being farmed out to private companies after costing hundreds of mil­lions of dollars. 
Begun after the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackings, the programs were supposed to help prevent catastrophic terrorist attacks on the U.S. transportation system by checking airline passenger names against watch lists and providing special identification cards to every worker with access to airports, railroads, seaports or trucks. 
So far, the Transportation Security Administration ­which has been overseeing development of the three pro­grams-has not gone beyond testing, has issued no IDs and has screened no passengers against terrorist lists. 
TSA chief Kip Hawley defend­ed the agency's efforts this week, saying the projects by their very nature use expensive and unreliable advanced tech­nology. 
All three are back on track, Hawley said. "Massive changes have happened here," he said. "We have a good acquisitions team and a good process." 
According to documents obtained by The Associated Press, the agency has spent more than $200 million on the Transportation Worker Identity Credential, Secure Flight and Registered Traveler programs. 
On all three, the TSA and con­tractors hired by the agency have spent more than anticipat­ed, missed deadlines and raised questions about their ability to protect the public's privacy and the private sector's commercial interests. 
Congressional investigators have warned repeatedly that the agency is mismanaging the pro­grams. 
"Five years after 9/11, the Bush Administration and TSA are stuck in neutral on critical security measures. said Massachusetts Rep. Ed Markey, a senior Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee. 

"The lack of oversight by this Republican Congress on this program and countless others is just another reason Americans are ready to head in a new direction in November," Markey said. 
Hawley called Secure Flight the most important of the three projects. It is envisioned as a computer-based program to check all airline passengers' names against terrorist watch lists before they board an air­plane. 
Airlines already check names against the lists and alert TSA officials when a passenger's name appears similar to one on a watch list. The system has led to thousands of false identifica­tions. More than 30,000 people who are not terrorists have asked TSA to remove their names from the lists since Sept. 11, 2001. 
The TSA for four years tried to develop a technology system to take over the task of checking names against watch lists. The major contractors on the project were IBM, Lockheed Martin and Eagle Force Associates. Also involved in testing were Acxiom Corp., HNC Software, Infoglide Software, and Ascent Technology. 
In February, the Government Accountability Office found security vulnerabilities with Secure Flight and it was sus­pended for retooling -after $110 million had been spent. 
Hawley said the project stalled because of debate about whether it should try to identify unknown terrorists -which raises civil liberties concerns ­or simply match names against watch lists. 
"That debate was played out," he said. "Congress said this is simply going to be watch-list matching." 
The Transportation Workers Identity Credential, or TWIC, is an ID card to be issued to about 6 million longshoremen, mechanics, airport workers, locomotive engineers and truck drivers -if they pass govern­ment background checks. The card will use a biometric identi­fier -fmgerprint or eye scan, for example.

IN BRIEF 
Interest rate left unchanged 
WASHINGTON -The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady yet again, noting the economy had slowed but saying growth would probably pick up in the months ahead. 
With elections looming, Fed policymakers, wrapping up a two-day meeting on Wednesday, delivered a largely balanced message about economic conditions. Policymakers blended equal parts of caution about inflation risks with confidence that the economy's nearly 5-year-old expansion isn't in danger of petering out. 
Against that backdrop, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and all but one of his central bank colleagues felt comfortable staying the course and kept an important interest rate at 5.25 per­cent for the third meeting in a row. That meant commercial banks' prime interest rate -for certain credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans-remained at 8.25 percent. 
ImCione names Carl Icahn chairman 
NEW YORK -Financier Carl lcahn won the nasty battle to take control of biotech company lmClone Systems Inc. on Wednesday. The com­pany named him chairman and said the four board members he was trying to oust are leav­ing, including the interim CEO, who resigned effective immediately. lmClone shares climbed more than 5 percent. 
Icahn, who owns roughly 14 percent of the company, had been seeking a management shake-up since September after declaring the board had done a deplorable job running lmClone, noting it had failed to both fully capi­talize on the potential of cancer drug Erbitux and fmd a suitable CEO. 
In a statement, Icahn said his top priorities were finding a new chief executive and repair­ing relations with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., which owns about 17 percent of ImClone and jointly markets Erbitux, ImClone's only product. 
Erbitux is facing competition from a rival product from Amgen Inc. that was recently approved. 
lmClone said that interim CEO Joseph L. Fischer, who resigned Wednesday, would be replaced by a newly formed executive commit­tee chaired by board member Alex Denner, who works for Icahn. Denner said candidates for the CEO slot had already been identified.

Beans dis111issed as ne"W voting process 
Associated Press 
MU.JA -Blondine Pendeyiki brought a handful of red beans to the voting station to cast the first ballot of her life and was dismayed when she was told she couldn't use them to vote. 
Election workers say that after the first round of voting in Congo, they found notes like "I love you, I vote for you!" on ballots, or beans, peas or pebbles carefully counted to correspond to a candidate's number on the ballot and folded into the vot­ing papers -instead of the required thumbprints or crosses. 
They expect to have to dis­qualify more such ballots in Sunday's second and decisive round. 
In a largely illiterate Congo trying to embrace democracy after four decades of dictator­ship, 42-year-old Pendeyiki is far from alone. She still does­n't understand why voting officials didn't accept her beans during the first round in July. 
"Many in my country have never voted before, so we have to teach them why they can't use beans or stones to vote," said Deodata Bunzigiye, a social worker and election observer who says she has helped some 30.000 illiterate and poorly educated Congolese learn to vote. 

"My work can be very tough. The Pygmies, and Africans in general, have oral traditions," she said. "Learning to use a pencil is not a priority." 
President Joseph Kabila faces Vice President Jean­Pierre Bemba, a former rebel leader, in a runoff for the presidency of a country the size of Europe. 
In the rural east, few Pygmies have access to televi­sion or campaign posters and most had no idea what the candidates looked like. So during the July 30 first round, unable to recognize them, they came with beans to indi­cate their choice. 
Most knew they wanted to vote for Kabila and knew he was listed as the seventh can­didate on a ballot sheet that listed 33 contenders for the presidency, Bunzigiye said. So they folded the ballots around seven beans or pebbles to indicate their choice, and handed them in. 
Experts say it could be years before communities in Congo's inaccessible interior have access to voter education programs.

"His father had come to the end of his rope with Greg and was starting to cut him off financially," said Kent Sutton, who prosecuted Summers. "Greg was going to inherit everything and that was one of the reasons he wanted the 
house burned." 
Prosecutors also showed how Summers previously col­lected insurance payoffs from fires at his grandmother's house and a vehicle. 
"Greg was pure evil. He'd been bleeding them dry for money over the years, and when he realized he couldn't get any more out of them, he figured he could get their insurance," said Miles LeBlanc, Sutton's prosecutor partner. 
"He was so cruel in what he did to them and he needs to pay," said Brenda Steele, who lost her aunt and two uncles. "They loved Greg and they overlooked a lot of things they probably shouldn't have." 
Cantu, 31, had denied involvement and blamed the killings on two companions who testified against him. 
"We were able to find enough circumstantial evi­dence to piece together a strong case," LeBlanc said. "Greg Summers earned his conviction."

AURORA, N.Y. -The omi­nous chill Republicans are feeling these days has little to do with October's blustery winds and everything to do with the big coattails Hillary Rodham Clinton and Eliot Spitzer bring to the top of the state Democratic ticket on Election Day. 
With voters across the coun­ty signaling discontent with the Republican-led Congress and President Bush's adminis­tration, New York Republicans fear that three of their once­safe House seats are in jeop­ardy -out of 15 GOP seats nationwide that could swing the House to Democratic con­trol. 
"New York state is in a death spiral," state legislature candidate Tim Julian, a Republican, said at a recent political forum in Rome, N.Y. 
At the top of the Democratic ticket, Clinton is enjoying the rosy warmth of job security. Former Yonkers Mayor John Spencer, the little-known Republican challenger for her Senate seat, is expected to lose big. 
Similarly, Spitzer, the attor­ney general who built a head­lines-rich career going after white-collar crime on Wall Street, is strongly favored to win the state's governorship over Republican John Faso, a former state assembly minori­ty leader. 
"It's not been a good year for Republicans, that's for sure," said Cheri Heary, organizer of a recent cam­paign event in this Finger 
Lakes town for GOP congres­sional candidate Ray Meier. "They're a little dispirited, thinking Eliot Spitzer is going to win, but that's why we call them, that's why we bring them out for the vote." 
Meier is running to replace moderate Republican Sherwood Boehlert in New York's 24th Congressional District, a Republican strong­hold for decades, although it has significant numbers of blue-collar Democrats. 
Boehlert built a reputation as a moderate Republican who often bucked party lead­ership, particularly on envi­ronmental issues, and both candidates have sought to assume that moderate label. The Democrat in the race, Michael Arcuri, a district attorney, regulary refers to himself as a "Boehlert Democrat," though Boehlert has enthusiastically supported Meier. 
The district is also gripped by economic anxieties over jobs and taxes. Even Republican candidates blast the state government, which has been led for 12 years by GOP Gov. George Pataki. 
Heary, chairwoman of the Cayuga County GOP, said the state party has been of little help. Even in the middle of a furious campaign season, she said, she hasn't heard from the chairman in five months. 
"The feeling you get is that you're on your own," she said, as guests filled the mint-green kitchen of the 1850s farm­house where Meier thanked supporters for driving through a howling storm to see him.

N.J. court opens the doors to gay tnarriage 
Lawmakers determine same-sex unions must be honored 'Within state 
Associated Press 
TRENTON, N.J. -New Jersey's highest court opened the door Wednesday to making the state the second in the nation to allow gay marriage, ruling that lawmakers must offer same-sex couples either marriage or something like it, such as civil unions. 
In a ruling that fell short of what either side wanted or most feared, the state Supreme Court declared that gay couples are entitled to the same rights as heterosexual ones. The justices gave lawmakers 180 days to rewrite the laws. 
The ruling is similar to the 1999 high-court ruling in Vermont that led the state to cre­ate civil unions, which confer all of the rights and benefits avail­able to married couples under state law. 
"Although we cannot find that a fundamental right to same-sex marriage exists in this state, the unequal dispensation of rights and benefits to committed same­sex partners can no longer be tolerated under our state Constitution," Justice Barry T. Albin wrote for the four-member majority. 
The court said the Legislature "must either amend the mar­riage statutes to include same­sex couples or create a parallel statutory structure" that gives gays all the privileges and obli­gations married couples have. 
The vote was 4-3, with the three dissenting justices arguing that the majority did not go far enough. They asserted that gay couples should have the "right to the title of mar­riage" as well as its benefits. 
Gay rights 

ment. 
For gay rights advocates, there was debate over whether the ruling was a victory. 
Lara Schwartz, legal director of Human Rights Campaign, said if legislators have to choose between civil unions and mar­riage, it is a no-lose situation for gay couples. "They get to decide whether it's chocolate or double­chocolate chip," Schwartz said. 
Steven Goldstein, executive director of Garden State Equality, New Jersey's main gay rights group, said his organiza­tion wants nothing short of mar­riage. "We get to go from the back of the bus to the middle of the bus," he complained. 
The New Jersey high court castigated the treatment same­sex couples receive under the law. 
"The seeming ordinariness of plaintiffs' lives is belied by the social indignities and economic difficulties that they daily face due to the inferior legal standing of their relationships compared to that of married couples," the court said. 
Outside the court, news of the ruling caused confusion, with many of the roughly 100 gay marriage supporters outside ask­ing each other what it meant. 
''I'm definitely encouraged," said Chris Lodewyks, one of the plaintiffs who gathered at a Newark law office. But he added, ''I'm not sure what this exactly means in terms of marriage." 
Another plaintiff, Saundra Toby-Heath, was more effusive: "I feel they were listening and paying attention to us as human beings who wanted to have the same rights." 
Garden State Equality, New Jersey's main gay political organization, quickly announced that three lawmakers would introduce a bill in the Legislature 
to give full

Northeast. The the lawmak­only state to Democratic assemblyman e r s 
allow gay mar­riage is Massachusetts. The only states allowing civil unions are Vermont and Connecticut. New Jersey is also one of just five states that have no law or consti­tutional amendment expressly banning gay marriage. 
If the court had legalized gay marriage outright, the effect could have been more far-reach­ing, and New Jersey could have become more of a magnet for gay couples than Massachusetts, which has a law barring out-of­state couples from marrying there if their marriages would not be recognized in their home states. New Jersey has no such law. 
A clear-cut ruling legalizing gay marriage this close to Election Day could also have been a political bombshell, gal­vanizing Republicans and the religious right. Eight states have gay marriage bans on their bal­lots in November. 
New Jersey Republicans, who are in the minority in the Legislature, said they would work to ban same-sex unions by enacting a constitutional amend-

GOP Assemblyman Richard Merkt said he would seek to have all seven justices impeached. "Neither the framers of New Jersey's 1947 constitu­tion, nor the voters who ratified it, ever remotely contemplated the possibility of same-sex mar­riage," Merkt said. 
Gay couples in New Jersey can already apply for domestic part­nerships under a law passed in 2004. Among other things, domestic partnerships give cou­ples the right to inherit posses­sions if there is no will and health care coverage for part­ners of state employees. 
Democratic Gov. Jon S. Corzine supports domestic partnerships, but not gay marriage. 
Former Gov. James E. McGreevey, who resigned in 2004 after announcing that he was gay and had an affair with a male staff member, praised the court's decision. "I applaud the court's courage," McGreevey said. "I regret not having had the fortitude to embrace this right during my tenure as governor." 
Madonna to adopt African son 
Tells Oprah Wednesday that her baby, David Banda, is healthy 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Madonna said the 13-month-old boy she plans to adopt from the African coun­try of Malawi is healthy and thriving in her London home, in an interview that aired Wednesday on "The Oprah Winfrey Show." 
The child, David Banda, was taken to London last week after Malawi's High Court granted Madonna and her husband, director Guy Ritchie, an interim adoption order. 
Madonna said David was healthy, despite having over­come malaria and tuberculosis. The interview was taped Tuesday via satellite from London. 
"David is amazing," the 48­year-old pop star said. "What really surprises me is how great my children are with him and how he's transitioned so easily from living in Africa in an orphanage to living in our house." 
David's father, Yohane Banda, has said he didn't understand the adoption meant he would give up custody of his son "for good." But in an interview post­ed Tuesday on Time magazine's Web site, Banda said he will not contest the adoption. 
"I don't want my child, who is already gone, to come back," he said. "I will be killing his future ifI accept that." 
Banda has said he is too poor to raise David. 
Madonna said she met Banda, who thanked her for giving his son a new life. "I sat in that room, I looked into that man's eyes," she said. 
The 30-minute interview with Winfrey was the first time Madonna had spoken on TV

Madonna said she initially was urged to consider adopting a child in Ethiopia or Kenya because of Malawi's vague adoption laws. 
"I did have my heart set on David, but I was also told there was a possibility I wouldn't be able to adopt him," she said. "I was told to look around at all the orphanages."

When asked if he would like to adopt someday, the 34-year­old pop star said: "Totally. I don't know when, but right now I am sponsoring three children in India and we have a very beautiful connection." 
David Banda has spent most of his life in an orphanage. His mother died shortly after child­birth.

Colleges stage large 




campaigns 
Associated Press Cornell University is going all-out this week. Today features a news con­ference in New York City with the mayor. On Friday, 1,000 volunteers and wealthy alum­ni such as former Citigroup chairman Sanford "Sandy" Weill will be back on the main campus in Ithaca, N.Y., for an elaborate dinner. The menu: a salad that includes wild mushrooms and sweet vermouth cheesecake; mari­nated beef tenderloin; and, a hazelnut Godiva chocolate tart with minted raspberry sauce. Cornell should more than recoup the bill. The festivities are kicking off a campaign to raise $4 billion. It's a jaw-dropping sum that exceeds the size of any university's entire endow­ment 20 years ago, and all but about 15 today. To hit the target, Cornell President David Skorton will have to raise more than $1.6 million every day for the next five years. But $4 billion isn't even the biggest campaign announced in higher education this month. Stanford and Columbia just announced campaigns of $4.3 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. Yale and the University of Virginia recently announced $3 billion campaigns, and 24 universi­ties are officially trying to raise $1 billion or more, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education. The campaigns come at a time when college is more expensive than ever. Just Tuesday, a national report found college price increases again outpacing inflation. Tuition, fees and room and board at Cornell run $43,707 this year, though it promises aid for any student who needs it and will use some of the campaign money for more scholarships. "We have a· lot of wonderful things to do with the money," Skorton said in a telephone interview this week. Of the $4 billion target, he said: "I hope we're going to blow right by that." They probably will. Cornell has already raised about $1 billion. Universities don't announce campaigns until they're confident they'll make it, though sometimes they extend the typical deadline. UCLA stretched a recent cam­paign to a decade to reach $3 billion. Multibillion-dollar cam­paigns have transformed how elite universities raise money. The traditional prodding at homecoming cocktail parties is supplemented by data min­ing and marketing consult­ants. Cornell's fundraising staff numbers 125. Some schools pay top rainmakers $200,000 or more. The goal is luring the big fish. Nobody gets to $4 billion in tens and twenties. Colleges still solicit small donations from young alumni, but that's largely to increase the odds that alumni who strike it rich will already be in a giving habit. 

Adults advised to get shingles vaccine 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -An influential government advisory panel voted Wednesday to recom­mend routine vaccines to pro­tect older adults against shin­gles. 
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to recommend the vaccine for adults 60 and over. The com­mittee's recommendations usually are accepted by feder­al health officials, and they influence insurance coverage for vaccinations. 
Shingles is a painful, blister­ing skin rash that is most common in people 60 and older. It usually goes away after four weeks, but one in five shingles sufferers devel­ops excruciating long-term nerve pain known as posther­petic neuralgia. Complications also can include scarring and loss of vision or hearing. 
Antiviral medications are only of limited help, and some doctors say they do not pre­vent shingles from progress­ing into postherpetic neural­gia. 
No vaccine was available until May, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration licensed Zostavax, made by Merck & Co. 
Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus, which also causes chickenpox. An estimated 15 percent to 30 percent of people infected with the virus develop shin­gles later in life. 
The virus essentially hiber­nates for decades in nerve cells around the spine. It reactivates in some patients, probably because the body's immune system weakens with age, doctors say. 
The vaccine is a souped-up version of Merck's chickenpox vaccine for children, with a live virus that is 14 times more potent. 
The FDA approval was based largely on a study involving more than 38,000 people, with 19,000 getting the actual vaccine and others who got placebo. People who got the shot developed shin­gles at only half the rate of those who got the fake vac­cine, researchers found.

Falllilies vvork harder to finance college fees 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -With the cost of tuition and fees soaring, par­ents face a daunting task in trying to figure out how to finance their children's college educations. 
The College Board, which tracks college pricing trends, reported earlier this week that tuition and fees at four-year public colleges rose more than 6 percent to an average of $5,836 this fall. The cost at pri­vate four-year colleges increased just under 6 percent to an average of $22,218. 
"Those numbers are intimi­dating, but parents have to remember they don't have to pay it all up-front," said Bruce 
D. Harrington, vice president of Boston-based MFS Investment Management. 
The typical family, he said, "pays for college in three dif­ferent ways: one-third out of current income, one-third out of college savings, and one­third out of loans or grants." 
Still, Harrington said, fami­lies will find it easier if they start saving sooner rather than later. 
Among the most popular ways for families to save are the Section 529 plans, which are state-sponsored programs named for a section of the Internal Revenue Code. Money set aside in 529 plans grows tax-deferred, and distributions to pay for a beneficiary's col­lege expenses are exempt from federal income taxes. 
Joseph F. Hurley, president and chief executive of Savingforcollege.com, a college financing information center, pointed out that Congress ear­lier this year voted to extend the tax exempt status of 529 plans indefinitely rather than allowing it to "sunset" in 2010. 
"That uncertainty is eliminat­ed now, making 529 plans more attractive," he said. 
In addition, a change in the tax law has made money invested in custodial accounts under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, UGMA, or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, UTMA, more likely to be taxed at the parents' rate. This again makes the 529 plans a better 
savings alternative, Hurley said. 
Harold Simansky, founder of Educational Investments LLC in Brookline, Mass., said he urges a multigenerational approach to financing college educations. 
"The numbers are just too big for the parents to do it by themselves," he said. "And for grandparents, saving for a grandchild's education and paying for tuition has estate planning and gift tax planning benefits." 
That's because tuition pay­ments don't count against an individual's $12,000 a year gift-tax exclusion. Contributions of up to $12,000 to 529 accounts also qualify, and contributions of between $12,000 and $60,000 can be treated as if they were made over a five-year period for gift­tax purposes. 
Although some families plan on tapping home equity to cover college expenses, Simansky discourages it. 
"If they tap into their homes to pay for education, what are they going to do in retire­ment?" he asks. 
Jon Veenis, executive vice president for San Francisco­based Wells Fargo & Co., said he urges families to "pursue the least-costly money first." 
That means to start by look­ing for "free" money such as scholarship and grants, then looking at government-guaran­teed loans such as the Stafford for students or the PLUS for parents. 
Veenis said families that need additional financing then can look at private loans, such as those issued through the Wells Fargo student loan program, or home equity loans. 
"The choice here depends on several considerations," he said. "A key question is, who is going to be obligated for the debt? Is it going to be the par­ents, the student, or some com­bination? That could drive the decision." 
Harrington of MFS Investment Management, which operates an Oregon­sponsored 529 plan, suggests families can accumulate more if they set up a systemati~ sav­ings plan. 
Rolling executed for Fla. lllurders 
Serial killer took the lives of five University of Florida students in 1990 
Associated Press 
STARKE, Fla. -Danny Harold Rolling, Florida's most notorious serial killer since Ted Bundy, was execut­ed by injection Wednesday for butchering five college students in a ghastly string of slayings that terrorized Gainesville in 1990. 
Rolling, 52, was pro­nounced dead at 6:13 p.m. EDT, more than 16 years after his killing rampage at the start of the University of Florida's fall semester. 
When asked for a last statement, Rolling sang for two minutes what sounded like a hymn with the refrain "none greater than thee, 0 Lord, none greater than thee," witnesses and prison officials said. 
He appeared to continue singing after prison officials turned off the microphone, finally stopping just before he died. 
The bodies of his victims were found over three days in late August, just as the University of Florida's fall semester was beginning. All had been killed with. a hunt­ing knife. Some had been mutilated, sexually assaulted and put in shocking poses. One girl's severed head had been placed on a shelf, her body posed as if seated. 
The killing spree touched off a huge manhunt and plunged the laid-back college town into panic. Students fled and residents armed them­selves. 
Belongings that Rolling left at a campsite in the woods and DNA taken after a later arrest for robbery linked him to the slayings. When he came up for trial in 1994, he shocked the courtroom by pleading guilty. 
"There are some things you just can't run from, this being one of those," Rolling told the judge. 
He later told The Associated Press: "I do deserve to die, but do I want to die? No. I want to live. Life is difficult to give up." 
Dianna Hoyt, who step­daughter was slain, said the execution marked "the final chapter of this book." 

"This man brought this out­come to himself, and the law of the land carried through to show us justice," Hoyt said. 
Outside the prison, death penalty opponents stood in a circle singing "Amazing Grace" after Rolling was pro­nounced dead. 
Other onlookers supported the execution. "They're doing a good thing," said Randy Hicks, 35, a truck driver and former prison guard who occasionally watched over Rolling. "This guy deserves it. It's very overdue." 
Death penalty protesters said the execution only served to provide Rolling additional attention. 
"The state of Florida is giv­ing this psychopathic killer just what he wanted," said Mark Elliott of Clearwater, spokesman for Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. 
The attention surrounding Rolling's execution reopened old wounds in Gainesville and for the families of the victims. 
The victims' families ran an advertisement Thursday in The Gainesville Sun, thank­ing the community for its support: "We hope you will remember August 1990 and the years that followed with­out any sense of community shame for what has hap­pened here. You turned a blemish into a rose." 
Rolling was calm and coop­erative ahead of the execu­tion, Corrections Department spokesman Robby Cunningham said. He spent several hours with his broth­er Kevin and his brother's pastor, officials said. 
The gathering of people on a barren cow pasture across from the prison was reminis­cent of the crowds that assembled for Bundy's execu­tion on Jan. 24, 1989 in the state's old electric chair.. Bundy was suspected in the deaths and disappearances of 36 women across the coun­try. 
Bundy died in the electric chair in 1989 in the same death chamber. The case was still fresh in the minds of many when Rolling's killings began the following year in roughly the same area as some of Bundy's crimes.

Last week, CNN aired video footage from Baghdad showing insurgent snipers taking aim at American soldiers. The network obtained the tape from the Islamic Army of Iraq, through interme­diaries. During the piece, CNN's Baghdad correspon­dent Michael Ware was careful to note that the video (enti­tled "Latest Sniper Operations in Baghdad") acts as a propaganda piece. He analyzed, scruti­niz!~d and related the video to real events taking place in Iraq. 
Despite these diselaimers, many peo­ple immediately denounced the network for airing the video. They leveled numerous charges, including that the video is inappropriate for soldiers' fami­lies, that it is unsuitable for young view­ers and even that it spuriously sanitizes the horrific violence because the video quickly fades to black after each shot to refrain from showing the aetual moment of impact. All of these accusations carry some merit and, frankly, they show that at least part of the American public pays attention to the news. 
Other critics went further with their indictments. "Does CNN want America to win this thing?" asked Republican House Representative Duncan Hunter from California on Monday. He called for the removal of embedded CNN jour­nalists and claimed that in past wars, the press was more pro-American. 
"The average American Marine or sol­dier," Hunter continues, "has concluded after seeing that film that CNN is not on their side." Mr. Hunter did not reveal his statistical source for deducing the psy­chological reaction of the average American soldier. He also chose not to reveal bow many soldiers responded to 

James Dechant 
Foregone Conclusion 
his scientific poll with gratitude that somebody was telling their brutal story to an insulated nation. Thankfully, we do not need to hear from any of those soldiers themselves, beeause wn have Mr. Huntnr to speak on tlu~ir behalf. 
Let's think about this a minutn, Mr. llunter; you are suggesting that CNN journalists want American men and women to be killed by terrorists. You are saying that bncause they are not putting a positive spin on the bleak­and I do mean bleak-situation in Iraq, they must consequently be in a lnague with intnrnationally vilified criminals. 
While I cautiously agme with CNN's decision to air the video, I will admit this is !:ertainly a thorny issue, and I can understand people's qualms. The video is not pretty. It is not encouraging. The decision to air the video and its presen­tation wnre not taken lightly, however. CNN even wamed viewers befornhand that the video would not be suitable for childnm. They knew it would be a volatile piece, and offended responses arn aec!~ptable. But to suggest, as Mr. II unter does, that the network supports terrorism -that they do not wish for America to "win this thing" -is, in a word, stupid. 
llunter found support from Brian Bilbray, also a Hepresentative from California. Bilbray called the feature a "terrorist snufi' film." Hick Moore, one of many online bloggers that spoke out against the video footage, brashly titled a post "CNN Joins Insurgent PH Campaign." There were other attacks. 
All these detractors want to lump in CNN with the terrorist forces, because that would be the easy thing to do. It is, after all, the prevailing ideology of the time: with us or against us. As the midterm elections loom, many candi­dates are trying to bolster support by promoting this false dichotomy, claiming that war critics are nothing more than seditious opponents of national security. In similar fashion, Congressman Hunter implies that if you do not support our 
methods, you must therefore be against 
our goal, and in fact against us. If CNN 
has the audacity to show grim footage, 
Hunter thinks, they must hate America 
and hate freedom. 
What the Hepresentative and his ilk fail to realize is that one can support the AmtJrican mission and still be cr:itical of its execution. This CNN feature reported the facts and stopped short of criticism. These facts, like it or not, will not enthuse anyone. If you want a patriotic, nag-waving expose detailing all the progress America is making in Iraq, stop holding your breath. You could lind encouraging stories about the struggle and perseverance of our men and women serving there. or about the Iraqi pe,Jple's own struggle; but as far as the overall tactical military campaign goes, you would have to look long and hard to lind positive material. Television net­works cannot report on the good news from Iraq because there is precious lit­tle good news to report. At the time of writing, 91 American soldiers have been killed in Iraq this month alone, many of them by sniper attacks. That number, like the video, takes no sides: it is a cold fact. The American media should not combat terrorist propaganda with its own propaganda. 
Next time, Mr. Hunter and associates, save your terror accusations for the folks who really deserve them. Look on this video as a chilling reminder of the gravity of the Iraq situation, and pray that it will awaken a few more people to the importance of our struggle there. Spend your time fighting the real enemy.

Notre Dame Catholicism as a force for change 
Editor's Note: This is the third of three columns calling for greater attention to the global health crisis as discussed in the academic forum earlier this semester. 
In light of the recent 
events on campus involv-Jillian Mueller ing the President's Forum on Global Health 
Guest 
Columnist
and the latest issue of 
Notre Dame Magazine, which explores our "moral obligation to those in need," I have been reflecting on Catholicism and how it is expressed at Notre Dame. I can't help but think there is a disparity between the teachings of Jesus concerning feeding the hungry, visiting the sick and sheltering the homeless and the forms that our Catholic faith takes on a daily basis here on campus and through­out our lives. 
At the forum, a panel addressed global health problems and the systems of pover­ty that underlie them. One of the panelists, Dr. Paul Farmer, addressed the Notre Dame community not just as a group of students and academics, but as fellow Catholics. Farmer also contributed an arti­cle to the latest issue of Notre Dame Magazine entitled "If We Fail to Act." If you read his biography, you know that Farmer was raised Catholic but withdrew from his faith until he encountered the people and politics of Haiti shortly after completing his undergraduate education. In Haiti, Catholicism came alive for him in the doctrine of liberation theology. Developed by Latin American theologians and embraced by many Latin American bishops and other conscientious Catholics and non-Catholics around the world, liber­ation theology speaks out against institu­tionalized poverty, promotes the preferen­tial option for the poor inherent in the teachings of Jesus and calls for activism to fight for social justice and human rights. In witnessing the faith of Haitians and the systemic injustices that impoverish this nation, Farmer now lives and breaths his mission to put Jesus' message into action, helping the poor and suffering throughout the world. 
I experienced a similar transformation this past spring, though on a much smaller scale. I was raised Catholic in a family that dutifully attended Mass each week, and though I completed 17 years of Catholic education, I strayed from my religion dur­ing high school and college. By my senior year of college at Saint Louis University, I was not what I would term religious. But it took only one week in El Salvador during that senior year to rediscover Catholicism through liberation theology as Farmer did. 
I was awed by the way the Salvadorans' faith was thoroughly ingrained into all aspects of their lives. It was through that faith and the proliferation of liberation theology by Archbishop Oscar Romero and other Jesuit priests, many of whom were martyred and massacred, that inspired Salvadorans to fight for human rights dur­ing the country's civil war in the 1980s. The struggle continues today, still support­ed by the liberation theology of the Jesuit community at the University of Central America in San Salvador and its communi­ty outreach efforts. After just one week in the country, I thought, this is it. I had found the core of the Catholic faith in the vibrant lives and beliefs of these resilient people. 
My trip to El Salvador opened my eyes to what being a Catholic can truly mean. One of Farmer's remarks sums up my experi­ence well: "Wow, this isn't the Catholicism I remember!" Being a Catholic should go beyond simply following a set of guide­lines, attending Mass and supporting char­ity work from a distance as items on life's checklist. Being a Catholic should mean embracing Jesus' message, standing in solidarity with the poor and fighting to remove the institutionalized injustices that keep them impoverished and without basic human rights. For Farmer, it means living a life dedicated to the poor, public health problems and social injustice. For me, it means participating in Notre Dame's GLOBES Ph.D. program where we seek to understand the connections between the environment, social systems and global health and to develop the tools needed to address these problems at a global scale. 
What does it mean for you? 
The Notre Dame community is over­whelmingly Catholic and has a huge set of resources at its disposal, including out­standing students and faculty. Our univer­sity already has international programs and projects with the Center for Social Concerns, and 10 percent of each graduat­ing class enters into full-time service pro­grams. Many undergraduates participate in service activities as well. While this is certainly admirable and already above the curve compared to most universities, we can do better. Only 20 percent of those service programs are international, and, on average, the Notre Dame student spends just over 28 hours per year doing service. What could we accomplish if we invested as much interest, money and energy in poverty issues and developing countries as we do in football? What could we learn and be exposed to if there was as much desire to study in Latin America as there is for studying in Ireland? Our uni­versity has a mission that seeks to trans­late learning and scholarship into service for justice. It's time to step up and fully embody that mission by placing our talents and assets at the service of the poor.

Are you even reading this? 
Are you between the ages of 18 and 22? Have you begun to read this column? If so, you might be the only undergradu­ate doing so. This may make you want to: a) stop here; who Kate Barrett wants to be the only one Faithpoint doing any­thing? or b) forge ahead; you've always thought of yourself as a cutting-edge type. 
The "Faithpoint" column runs on the Viewpoint page of The Observer every Thursday, writ­ten from Campus Ministry alter­nately by Father Dick Warner, our director, or me. It's a chance to write and think about issues facing the campus com­munity from the perspective of our Christian faith. 
r'have found that in the days following the appearance of a column, I receive some very lovely comments from readers (I am typically not a controversial person -although you could ask my husband about my recent run-in with the cell phone guy when we updated our plan-so I don't get a lot of heated, angry responses to these columns). 
I once had a "subway alum" who reads The Observer on-line send me an e-mail from his office at NASA in Houston. Students' mothers who get the paper at home write to me. Sometimes people I pass on the quad will mention that they liked an article they read recently; other parents who work at Notre Dame will make kind comments as we pick up our kids from school at St. Joe grade school downtown. Even a few of my husband's colleagues in the Law School have sent encouraging e-mails my way. 
Why do I mention this? If you've read this far (and again, if you're a freshman, sopho­more, junior or senior at this fine university, you may be the only one who has read this far) I will let you in on my secret: I don't think undergrads ever read the "Faithpoint" column. Father Warner disagrees with me, but I say, at least not when I write it. We have a little joke in our house: an informal run­ning accumulation of months gone by since I started writing the column-without any tan­gible evidence that one single undergrad has made it beyond the headline. 
Please don't get me wrong; I'm not fishing for compliments or praise. Every day my husband and my kids tell me they love me, so I'm good. It's not that I need to hear whether you (the hypothetical "you," if you're still hanging in there) liked it or not; my concern is simply this: I'd like to write about what you'd like to read. Actually, cancel that; I'd like to write what you need to read. What's going on with you that you would like another faith perspective about? What topics would help you as you grow and explore your faith? What do you pray about? What questions do you have about Catholicism in particular or Christianity in general? How are you-or are you not-con­necting the way you live each day to what our faith teaches us? What topics would spark a worthwhile conversation among your friends? 
I'm not trying to abandon my new cyber-friends, most of whom I've never met, who have sent me often very moving e­mails after a column, or the assorted faculty members or friends (or the one grad student I heard from once) who out of the goodness of their hearts read what I write and take a minute to tell me so. I don't mind just sending these reflec­tions off onto Notre Dame's little corner of the information super­highway every other week by Wednesday noon, but it does sometimes seem a bit like talk­ing to myself. I walk across the quad from the parking lot by Lyons over to Co-Mo in the mornings and watch many of you tromping off to your 8 a.m. classes and wonder, what can I write that will touch your hearts? I may be hopelessly out of touch; after all, I was a stu­dent here before you all were even born, but I'm a quick learner. 
So. My e-mail address is con­veniently located right here after the next -and last -sen­tence. 
I'd love to hear from you.

Faith and films -those are the words of choice as the Browning Cinema at the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts hosts the Films and Faith Weekend. Put on by the theology and film, television, and theatre departments as a College of Arts and Letters "Decade of the Arts" signature event, the series will show films from various countries this Friday through Sunday night. The weekend will open with a reception and keynote address in the Browning Cinema lobby at 6 p.m. Friday. 
As a series, the films provide a glimpse of spirituality across differ­ent temporal dimensions. The theme for this weekend is "Faces of the Saint." In keeping with this theme, the grouping of films seeks to demonstrate a varied depiction of spiritual life. 
Each of the six featured films focuses on saintly individuals and actual saints to explore the ways spiritual life has been portrayed in dramatically different ways by French, German, Italian and American directors over the past five decades. Most of the films explore the lives of religious clergy, but "Household Saints" explores spiritual aspects of family life. 
It is ambitious to expect any stu­dent to attend the entire film series, but these films definitely have great potential. If nothing else, students should take advantage of the chance to see a few noted foreign flicks. The program also helps to put each movie in context with opening remarks, as well as question-and­answer sessions after each showing. 
Since Notre Dame is one of the pre­mier religious institutions in the country, the series in Films and Faith is unique to the status of the univer­sity. Although mainstream movies generally do not incorporate many religious themes, this series high­lights the films whose primary aim is on religious discussion. 
+"Diary of a Country Priest" (1951), Friday, 7 p.m. 
This film is probably one of the most familiar names around campus, due to the fact that it once was a fairly popular novel. The film, direct­ed by Robert Bresson, is in French of the series that focuses on family life, rather than life in a religious vocation. This film, directed by Nancy Savoca, tells the story of an Italian-American family in the years after World War II. As the daughter in the story ages, she develops an increasing level of religious fanaticism. 
This film explores ideas about faith in the family con­text as well as a discussion of Italian-American life and reli­gious ideals. This is the only film of the series that is filmed in English, so it pro­vides a good option for those who dislike films with subti­tles. 
+"Therese" (1986), 
Saturday, 10 p.m. and 
Sunday, 7 p.m. 
This film, directed by Alain

during the next several weeks on campus. The novel can be purchased at the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore, and the lecture will take place on Nov. 7 at 7 p.m. in 155 DeBartolo. 
+"The Ninth Day" (2005), Friday, 10 p.m. 
"The Ninth Day" is one of the more recently made films to be shown this weekend. Directed by Volker Schlondorff, it tells the story of a priest from Luxembourg who is sent to the Dachau concentration camp during the Holocaust. He is released on the condition that he convince the Bishop to sign an agreement with Nazi Germany and is told that if he fails to do this within nine days, he 
+"The Flowers of St. Francis" (1950), Saturday, 3 p.m. 
This film is one of the most unique of the series -rather than a woven narrative, it consists of short seg­ments about the life and teachings of St. Francis of Assisi. It is directed by Roberto Rossellini, in Italian with English subtitles. Cast with monks from the Nocera lnferiore Monastery, this film promises to be authentic in appearance and meaning. It is also an extremely brief film -just over an hour -an easy thing to squeeze in if you're not watching the football game. 
+"Household Saints" (1993), Saturday, 7 p.m. 
"Household Saints" is the only film 
Unlike "The Flowers of St. 
Francis," "Therese" is in nar­rative form. It attempts to adhere to a historically accurate representa­tion of St. Therese through the use of depictions from Therese's journals. Because the life of St. Therese is so compelling -she died from tubercu­losis while still young -little is done to sensationalize the film. Rather, Cavalier simplifies his style in order to allow the story to speak for itself. The film is in French with English subtitles. 
+"Into Great Silence" (2005), Sunday, 3 p.m. 
Director Philip Groening picks up on a growing trend of artistic film.ing in "Into Great Silence." As its title indicates, this film has no spoken dialogue. The story traces the lives of a group of monks in the French alps. The lives of these monks are extraordinary in their silence -only interrupted by prayer and song. There are English subtitles, as the monks pray and sing in French and Latin. While this film has no narra­tive story, it is designed to provoke spiritual inspiration through watch­ing the monks go through their daily routine.

Antonio (Patrick Tighe) and Alonso (Stephan Iwanski), two of those shipwrecked, wronged Prospera years ago and banished him to his current home on an unnamed island, which leads him to seek revenge by causing the shipwreck. 
Other characters include Ferdinand (Adam Bonosky). who falls in love with Miranda; Caliban (Devin Preston), Prospera's ser­vant; Stephana (Marty Schroeder, an Observer Assistant Scene Editor) and Trinculo (Andre Valdivia), who decides to kill Prospera and take over the island; and Ariel, Prospera's servant fairy. 
Directed by senior Krysta Dennis, the NSR version of "The Tempest" focuses on the performance aspect of the Bard's text. 
"We try to play with Shakespeare and have fun with Shakespeare and not let it be such an academic thing," Dennis said. 
She emphasizes that the Bard is meant to be seen and heard, as opposed to analyzed as a text, not­ing that the original intent of his plays was to entertain. 
"I've always liked 'The Tempest,' which is Shakespeare's last play," Dennis said. "It's got all kinds of elements in it, like political unrest, mystical aspects and all kinds of great characters." 
Previous NSR productions were notable for their minimalism, but Dennis said "The Tempest" required a more lavish presenta­tion, which is certainly visible throughout. 
The lighting (by Ryan Retartha). costuming (by Mary Levy and Ashley Ceniceros) and set design (by Retartha and Samantha Towles) are all impressive and demonstrate just how much effort went into the show. 
Eyerman stresses that the NSR production emphasizes both the aspects of spectacle and story. The centerpieces of the spectacle are two dances, performed by the Ariels. 
In Shakespeare's text, Ariel is a single charac­ter, but the

"Often when you do 'The Tempest,' you use some kind of concept involving the fairy Ariel," Dennis said. "I decided I wanted to have a whole team of spirits. The sequences involving the dance never made sense to me in the text, but I made it make sense using the dances." 
Those dances, choreographed by 

I 

Natalie Conneely, are inspired by Kathakali, a classical dance style of Kerala, in southern India. 
Conneely explains that in the dances, each dancer is given a mythological god to embody and dance through. 
The accompanying soundtrack is 
taken from Bollywood, an Indian cinema style that often emphasizes 
storyline, espe­
cially as embod­
ied by the actors. 
"There's not a bad actor in the cast," Eyerman said. "Any one of these actors is strong enough that the entire show could be about them." 
Dennis also noted that the play involves students from every class year. Eyerman himself is a second year law student, and both he and Dennis have been impressed with the skill -if not experience -of

the young cast members. 
"They've come a long way and have rehearsed hard," Dennis said. 
The acting is solid throughout, led by Eyerman, Bonosky and Moore. Schroeder, Valdivia and Preston provide great comic relief, while the extra rehearsal time of the Ariels is evident in their outstand­ing performaces. 
The cast is rounded out by Ben Drda, Kevin McCarthy, Timothy Gotcher, Brian Dolinar, Robert DeBroeck, Kevin Stein, Jennifer Betancourt and Alyse Kinchen. 
"The Tempest" is one of Shakespeare's more seg­mented plays, which means that individual storylines are seemingly independent of the rest until the dis­parate threads rejoin at the end of the play. 
"Seeing it come together 
has been amazing," Eyerman said. "'The Tempest' was­n't one of my favorite Shakespeare shows, but this production has given me new appreciation for it." 
Both Eyerman and Dennis hope the show appeals to the larger Notre Dame community. While Dennis said the relevance of study­ing Shakespeare is still important, she also wants the show to enter­tain. 
"The opportunity to see Shakespeare, at any level, is essen­tial," Eyerman said. 
The NSR production of "The Tempest" has obviously been a labor of love that has accomplished Dennis' far-reaching goals. As a fast-paced and lavishly produced version of Shakespeare's text, it succeeds while still allowing the story and acting to impressively shine through. 
"The Tempest" will be shown in Washington Hall throughout the weekend, starting tonight. 
As a production created com­pletely by Notre Dame students, it is a very strong interpretation of "The Tempest," bringing to life a brave new world.

Associated Press 

IRVING, Texas -Tony Ramo is now the first-string quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys, and will make his first career start Sunday night at Carolina. 
Coach Bill Parcells said Wednesday that Romo, who replaced 14-year veteran Drew Bledsoe in the second half of Monday night's 36­22 loss to the New York Giants, will start. 
"Any time you do some­thing like this, it's not with­out a lot of consideration," Parcells said. "I've been thinking about it for some time.... Hopefully, maybe as the team is comprised right now, he might be able to do a couple of things that assist us." 
Neither Bledsoe nor Romo appeared in the Cowboys locker room Wednesday. The team said Bledsoe would talk later in the day. 
Ramo, a fourth-year pro who had never thrown a pass in a game until this season, will be the ninth different starting quarter­back for the Cowboys {3-3) since Hall of Farner Troy Aikman retired after the 2001 season. 
Bledsoe joined Parcells in Dallas last year, reuniting with the coach who made him the No. 1 pick in 1993 for the New England Patriots. 
His last pass Monday 
night was an interception at 
the goal line just before 
halftime when the Cowboys 
had a chance to take the 
lead. Bledsoe had already 
been sacked four times, 
once for a safety. 
Parcells rarely changes 

quarterbacks midseason, often showing loyalty to vet­erans. Two years ago, Parcells stuck with 41-year­. old Vmny Testaverde during a 6-10 season. Like Bledsoe, Testaverde had also played with Parcells 
earlier in his career. 
But Bledsoe apparently 
made too many costly mis­
takes for Parcells. His last 
interception came in a 
game that could have given the Cowboys first place in the NFC East. 

In Dallas' three victories, Bledsoe had six touchdown passes and one intercep­tion. But those have all been against teams with losing records. Against playoff contenders Jacksonville, Philadelphia and the Giants, he has one TD and seven INTs. 
Parcells told Bledsoe about his demotion Wednesday morning. 
"lie was emotionally under control. I'm sure he wasn't happy to hear the 
..

news," Parcells said. "I just told him we're going to make this change right now, and that he needed to stay around ready."

Penn State's Posluszny nears tackles record 
Nittany Lions' inside linebacker is set to win another Butkus award 
Associated Press 

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -Paul Posluszny's trophies from the 2005 season have been collect­ing dust in his parents' base­ment. Mom and Dad may soon need to clear space for some new hardware. 
The hard-nosed senior is again making big stops for Penn State, though 2006 didn't start quite as smoothly as last year's star-turning campaign, when Posluszny earned awards as the nation's best defensive player and linebacker. 
Posluszny suffered a serious right knee injury during the Orange Bowl in January that limited him in the offseason. After going through rehabilita­tion, Posluszny was moved from outside to inside at the start of the season as coach Joe Paterno switched to a four­linebacker scheme. It took a while for Posluszny to get com­fortable with the defense and his rehabbed knee. 
Not that Purdue co·ach Joe Tiller noticed a difference. 
"He looks like he came from the womb playing linebacker," said Tiller, whose Boilermakers (5-3, 2-2 Big Ten) host the Nittany Lions (5-3, 3-2) on Saturday. "The great ones are that way." 
Posluszny is a semifinalist again to be the nation's top defender and linebacker. And he might soon be able add this to his resume -he's 17 tack­

les shy of tying Greg Buttle's career record of 343 at Linebacker U. 
"It's always good to hear. Anytime something comes up, it's not just for any particular player, it's for the defense in general," Posluszny said about the accolades. "But the most important thing right now is Purdue. The most important thing is winning." 
Reserved off the field, "Pos" is a fiery competitor on game­day, so renowned for his lead­ership that teammates elected him the first two-time captain at Penn State since 1968-69. 
He's a bookworm, too, having been the seventh Nittany Lion to earn All-America and Academic All-America honors in the same season. Posluszny has talked in the past ofjoining the military, though undoubt­edly an NFL career awaits. 
"Paul is one of the best line­backers that we've ever had," said Paterno, in his 41st year as head coach. 
Still, there were questions about his knee to start the sea­son. Posluszny was carted off the field during the Orange Bowl with two partially torn ligaments in his right knee. 
He was held back from full contact at spring practice, but pronounced himself 100 per­cent to start the preseason. Team doctors have insisted that Posluszny wear a knee brace as a precaution, an order that the senior begrudg­ingly accepts. 
Then coaches threw him another curve and asked him to play inside linebacker. With a lack of experienced linemen, the switch allowed Paterno to

move Tim Shaw from middle linebacker to a hybrid defen­sive end/outside linebacker position and get young, talent­ed. Sean Lee into the starting lineup outside. 
Posluszny didn't complain, though there were some early question marks. 
He looked out of position at times and missed tackles on plays that appeared to be auto­matic hits last year. Some won­dered if Posluszny was a step slower because of the knee. 
"It seemed like at the begin­ning of the year with the first game, I didn't have double­digit tackles, and for some, they said, 'This kid is terrible now.' That was interesting, to say the least," Posluszny said. 
Coaches dismissed questions about his knee, though Posluszny did say he felt more limited earlier in the season wearing a heavier brace. These days, he sports a small­er, less obtrusive contraption on the knee. 
The biggest challenge was mentaL 
"I feel so much more com­fortable now," he said. ''I'm starting to finally feel at home at the position." 
Not good news for oppo­nents. 
"Mentally, he's running the whole show," defensive coordi­nator Tom Bradley said. 
The highlight-reel plays ­such as his takedown of Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith from behind during a night game last year at Beaver Stadium -aren't as frequent. Freewheeling outside lineback­ers often get more chances to make those kinds of plays.

He still made the highlights last week, bringing Illinois' Isiah Williams down from behind and reaching for the quarterback's right arm just enough to cause a fumble that led to Tony Davis' 6-yard touchdown return. The score gave the Nittany Lions' strug­gling offense some breathing room in a 26-12 win. 
Posluszny went to Shaw for advice earlier in the year about playing inside, counsel that isn't needed as much anymore. 
"He's got it pretty much down pat," Shaw said. "I knew it wouldn't take him that long."

AUTO RACING 
Mario Andretti honored for skill, citizenship 
Famous Italian racer given Italy's highest honor in New York 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Mario Andretti just grins when reminded that police officers all over America -and maybe the world -still invoke his name after they pull over a speeder. 
"Who do you think you are, Mario Andretti?" 
Andretti shakes his head and says, "Hey, that even happened to me once. You can imagine the look I got when I said, 'Yeah, it's me."' 
Andretti didn't get that tick­et. 
Over the years, the man who holds the unofficial title of best all-around racer ever has been given many honors. None is more prized than the one he received Monday night at the Columbus Citizens Foundation in New York. 
A beaming Andretti, standing before a small crowd of family and friends, received the Commendatore dell'Ordine al Merito della Repubblica ltaliana in honor of his public service, achievements as a race car driver and enduring commitment to his Italian her­itage. 
The Commendatore, as it is known, is the highest honor granted a civilian by the Italian government, similar to being knighted in Great Britain. Only a handful of Italian Americans have been given the honor, and it took a while for the folks who give out these things to get around to Andretti. 
Still, it was more or less inevitable. 
It's been 12 years since the most famous of the racing Andrettis retired from compe­tition. But the image of the skinny kid with a shock of 
unruly black hair, a gleaming same day that Andretti smile and hard, determined wrapped up the world champi­eyes remains just as clear as onship. ever to those who watched Yet Andretti never missed a Mario race on circuits all over race due to injury until the late the globe. 1980's, when he broke his col­

Andretti has often said he used to sit in the prerace meetings in

NHL 

Ruff plays with perfection 
Despite a 9-0 start, Sabres' head coach still looking for improvement 
Associated Press 

BUFFALO, N.Y.-Poor Lindy Ruff. 
The Buffalo Sabres coach is trying his nitpicking best, but fighting a losing battle in an attempt to find fault with his team's perfect start. 
At 9-0, Buffalo is one win short of matching the NHL record set by Toronto in 1993 for best start to a season, a feat the Sabres can accom­plish when they play the Islanders at Long Island on Thursday. 
To hear Ruff tell it, his team is a work in progress. 
"You've got to find the little things to make you even bet­ter," he said Wednesday. "We'll just keep nitpicking." 
And yet, for "You ,ve got to find that," Tallinder every problem said. "I don't

otherwise effi­cient 4-1 win at Montreal on Monday -there are a half­dozen or so things that leave him impressed. 
"There are moments where you look at the plays, you look at some of the goals, you look at the effort, you look at some of the blocked shots, you look at the desperation, and you say, 'Boy, they did a lot of good things,"' Ruff said. 
With a win against the 
Islanders, the Sabres would have an opportunity to break the record when they host Atlanta on Saturday. 
The NHL is recognizing the streak even though the Sabres have won three games by shootout, which the league instituted last season to elimi­nate ties. The Maple Leafs in 1993, by comparison, won nine games in regulation and one in overtime. 
Little of this matters to Sabres players, some of whom, such as defenseman Henrik Tallinder, weren't aware the team broke its fran­chise mark of 8-0 set in 1975 or was even approaching a league record. 
"You know what, I really 
wasn't paying 
attention to all 
can." 
The Sabres' 

ho-hum attitude belies what has otherwise been a determined, workman­like approach for a team already pegged as Stanley Cup contenders. The high expecta­tions are a result of Buffalo returning most of its team intact after losing Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals to eventual Stanley Cup cham­pion Carolina Hurricanes last season. 
Over the course of their streak, the Sabres have won in almost every imaginable fash­ion: from scoring six times in a period, as they did in a 9-1 win over Philadelphia last week, to three times overcom­ing two-goal deficits. 
Eight of their wins have come against teams that made the playoffs last year, includ­ing two victories against Carolina. They've defeated three division champs, includ­ing Detroit, which had the NHL's best record last season. 
And they've contributed to the NHL's first coaching change, Philadelphia's Ken Hitchcock was fired last week­end in part because of his team's loss to Buffalo. 
The Sabres have actually won 14 straight regular-sea­son games after winning their last five last season. And, for those counting, the only blem­ish on their record in the past two months was a 4-1 loss to Columbus in Buffalo's second preseason game. 
"It's pretty impressive. And I hope we're not done yet," said defenseman Jaroslav Spacek, the team's only offseason free­agent addition. 
To put the Sabres' streak into perspective, among North America's top four pro sports leagues, there have been only 13 teams that have gone 9-0 to start a season since 1993, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The best start of the bunch is the NBA Houston Rockets, who went 15-0 in 1993.

NFL 

Big Ben questionable for gan1e in Oakland 
Steelers have a tough decision regarding the QB's long-term health 
Associated Press 
Questionable is a word used a lot around the NFL. It's there every week in the injury reports that bookies and bet­tors like to study so much, usu­ally stuck somewhere in between probable and doubtful. 
Ben Roethlisberger, who was last seen sprawled unconscious on the field in Atlanta, is ques­tionable this week. The Pittsburgh Steelers said so, meaning their star quarterback may or may not play Sunday against the Oakland Raiders. 
Questionable. It's a word that can be used to describe many things. 
Let's begin with the judgment of anyone involved with the Steelers who actually believes it is a good idea to rush back Roethlisberger after two con­cussions in four months. 
Head injury one Sunday, starting nod the next. You don't need a degree in neurology to figure out something is wrong with this equation. 
Concussions forced two other quarterbacks out of the game in recent years. Troy Aikman and Steve Young retired early because the cumulative effect of concussions, and they're hardly alone among NFL alum­ni. 
Current players aren't faring much better. 
Quarterbacks Charlie Frye and Steve McNair recently left games with concussions and so did Minnesota receiver Troy Williamson. 
Carolina linebacker Dan Morgan's season is over, and the horrifying image of Chiefs quarterback Trent Green hav­ing his head slammed to the ground in the first game of the season is an indelible one. 
Concussions, it seems, are the NFL's dirty little secret. It's not just that they happen so often, but that the league doesn't seem to be doing much about it. 
Sure, the NFL says it has had a committee of doctors studying them since 1994. But experts in the field say the league's stud­ies are flawed, use suspect 

"Purdue is o great schooL It ho> mofly diver~<~ field& of studY and pwple ore &a nke. living in lafpye!te is nol that e"l'!'nsive so you ~on afford o comfortable standard ol living with the given .~~. Idefinitely <meooroge you 10 come lo Purilue." 
data, and don't stand up to peer review. 
So when the NFL says no evi­dence has been found that brain function declines as a result of a concussion, the news is greeted with skepticism in the medical community. 
"What the NFL allegedly finds is totally at odds with scores of publications that are out there," said Dr. Robert Cantu, a neurologist and leading expert in brain injuries at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. "The stuff the NFL is putting out is just not the way the thinking is in the communi­ty of sports medicine and spe­cialists with expertise in this area." 
Among those is a recent study by the University of North Carolina, which reported 10 percent of retired NFL players say concussions have had a permanent effect on their abili­ty to think and remember things as they've gotten older. 
Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson of the New York Giants is one of them. He esti­mates he had a dozen or more "bell-ringers" in his career, though he wasn't aware they were concussions. Carson said he has long had from memory problems because of postcon­cussion syndrome. 
For others, it's even worse. 
Former Steelers lineman Terry Long died last year at the age of 45 from a brain inflam­mation that resulted, in part, from repeated head injuries. Fellow Steelers center Mike Webster was diagnosed with football-induced dementia before he died at the age of 50. 
Coaches, though, seem to regard them as minor irritants. 
Vikings coach Brad Childress offered his own diagnosis the other day after Williamson was injured. 
"He does know what time zone we're in right now, and he can read a clock. So he's going to be OK," Childress said. 
Football, of course, isn't alone in having to deal with brain injuries. Keith Primeau had two years and $6 million left on his contract with the Philadelphia Flyers but retired earlier this year when even the most mun­dane skating drills caused him problems due to past concus­sions.

PGA 

Els under pressure at Chrysler Championship 
Associated Press 

PALM HARBOR, Fla. -Ernie Els has never missed the season­ending Tour Championship when playing a full schedule with a healthy body, so he jotted that down as part of his global sched­ule when laying out his plans for the year. 
But not everything has gone according to plan. 
Els thought the Chrysler Championship might be a good place for him to get ready for East Lake next week. But at No. 30 on the PGA Tour money list, he needs a good week at Innisbrook simply to get into the Tour Championship. He only has a $53,000 margin over Tim Clark at No. 31, knowing that any of the 60 guys behind him could win and potentially knock him out. 
"I really don't want to miss it," Els said Wednesday. "Finishing in the top 30 would give you something. I haven't had too much to grab onto this year. I've had some good finishes outside of the U.S. In the U.S. itself, I haven't really been up to my best." 
Els is back in the United States for the first time in two months. Now, the goal is to stay two weeks. 
Since joining the PGA Tour in 1994, the year he won his first 
U.S. Open, Els has missed the Tour Championship only twice ­in 1998 when his season was hampered by back injuries and last year when he missed the last three months because of knee surgery. 
Els is not alone in his pursuit of secondary gains at the Chrysler Championship, which starts Thursday at Innisbrook. 
This is the fmal full-field tour­nament of the year, one last chance for players to either get into the Tour Championship (top 30 on the money list) or the Masters (top 40). Perhaps more critical is keeping a job for next year, and that will be decided by the top 125 for full status and

the top 150 for conditional sta­tus. The odd man out appeared to be Bubba Dickerson. 
He had a chance to sew up his card last week until a 72-78 weekend at Disney moved him up to No. 125. But with such a low standing, he was the third alternate at Innisbrook, and milling around the locker room, he was losing hope that three guys would pull out of the event over the next 24 hours. 
Dickerson, a former U.S. Amateur champion, blamed no one but himself. 
"I could have taken care of it last week," he said. "I wouldn't be in this situation if I had played better golf. It's tough to take." 
He could still keep his position, but it's unlikely. Any of the three guys behind him on the money list only have to make the cut to give Dickerson one more tourna­ment this year -the fmal stage of Q-school. 
"I would walk away from here thinking I'm toast," he said. 
For Els, more troubling than his precarious position on the money list is the fact he hasn't hoisted a trophy all year, any­where around the world. He lost a playoff to Tiger Woods in Dubai. He was one shot behind Woods going into the third round at the British Open, but wound up in third place, five shots behind. 
As much as the Big Easy would love to be at the Tour Championship next week, he has a bigger goal in mind. Els loves starting the year in Hawaii at the Mercedes-Benz Championship, and the only way to get there is to win. 
"That's the urgency I want," he said. 
But even Kapalua is but one small step toward a grandiose goaL Els believes he lost his focus this year, spending too much time worrying about what happened in the past instead of paying attention to what he can accomplish in the future. 
Perhaps no other elite player from his generation has endured more crushing losses than the 37 -year-old South African. Two years ago, he missed playoffs in the Masters and PGA Championship by one shot, and lost in a playoff at the British Open. The other major that year was the U.S. Open, where he played in the final group and shot 80. 
Then came the knee injury last July while boating in the Mediterranean, which cost him the final three months of the PGA Tour season. Els returned sooner than expected, but still had trou­ble earlier this year trusting that his knee would hold up. 
"It's not like I've fallen off the map completely," Els said. "I haven't been consistent; I know that. But I don't want to read too much into it. I want to get back and forget about the past and start moving forward toward my goal." 
The Tour Championship would be a start. Kapalua would be even sweeter. 
But he has a bigger blueprint in mind. Els said he has given himself a "realistic goal" for the next three years, which will require d edica­tion to his body and his mind. 
Why three years? Els smiled, as if he was going to keep that to himself. But what he said next made it clear that he has not given up his pursuit of returning to No.1 in the world.

Detroit's first-round series at Yankee Stadium also was postponed. 
The postponement gives St. Louis manager Tony La Rossa a chance to juggle his rota­tion if he wants. He could bring Jeff Weaver back on regular rest in Game 5 instead of pitching rookie Anthony Reyes again. Reyes, however, tossed eight-plus strong innings for a 7-2 victo­ry in the opener. 
Tigers manager Jim Leyland could do the same with Kenny Rogers, who beat Weaver in Game 2 on Sunday night and extended his shutout streak to 23 innings this postseason. But Leyland specifically set up his rotation to give Rogers two starts at home, and the Series doesn't shift back to 
Detroit until

Reyes, Weaver could each pitch in Game 5 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS -Jeff Weaver 
and Anthony Reyes sat togeth­
er in the interview room, look­
ing at each other and waiting 
for questions. There was one 
they couldn't answer: Who's 
going to pitch Game 5 of the 
World Series for the St. Louis 
Cardinals? 
"I don't know which it's 
going to be, so they're both 
getting ready," St. Louis man­
ager Tony La Russa said 
Wednesday. 
That decision will be delayed another day because Game 4 was postponed by rain Wednesday night. Jeff Suppan and the Detroit Tigers' Jeremy Bonderman will try again on Thursday, with the teams facing another iffy forecast. 
The Cardinals lead the best­

Henderson celebrates anniversary of 'Wave' 
'Krazy George' says he began cheer in 1981 
Associated Press 
OAKLAND, Calif. -Krazy 
George Henderson has spent 
the last quarter-century trying 
to persuade everyone that he 
debuted the "Wave" during an 
Oakland Athletics' playoff game 
against the Yankees -not 
those Washington football fans 
who claim the Huskies first 
performed the now famous 
cheer. 
Debate aside, the Wave is 25 
years old and still going strong. 
"It's been really interesting," 
Krazy George said in a phone 
interview from his home in 
New Rochelle, N.Y. "I see it at 
the Olympics. There's a video of 
Fidel Castro doing it. If it had 
actually originated in New York 
at a Yankees game, they would 
have thought it was sent by the 
gods." 
Krazy George, now 62, says 
he spent three years perfecting 
the Wave. He first pulled off the 
move -in which fans take 
turns, by section, .standing up 
and waving their arms -on 
Oct. 15, 1981, at the Yankees­
A's AL championship series 
game in the Coliseum. 
Washington, meanwhile, did it 
two weeks later, on Oct. 31. 
Former Husky yell leader 
Robb Weller had returned to 
campus for a homecoming 
game against Stanford. He 
began a vertical version of the 
Wave in the '70s, but first did 
the horizontal Wave that day. 
Officials at Washington 
acknowledge Krazy George as 
being first, but what they are 
certain of is that the Huskies 
popularized the cheer. It soon 
caught on at a Seattle 
Seahawks game, too. 
It took a year and a half, 
according to Krazy George, for 
the Huskies to fess up that 
they'd seen the Wave on televi­
sion and given it their own 
twist. Good thing, too, because 
he has the proof on tape: The 
Wave was part of the Xs 1981 
highlight video shown to poten­
tial season ticket holders for 
the following year. 
"That's the best-kept lie in the last 25 years. But now, most of the world recognizes me," Krazy George said. "Their theory is that they came up with it in 30 seconds! 'Oh, we just thought it up.' 
"They kept doing it the whole 
football season and of course 
they were a big national foot­
ball power with a big budget. I 
tell everyone to call Seattle and get their side of the story. It's like a war with me." 
Krazy George, known best by that name and for pounding his drum in stadiums across the United States, is a California native who moved north to Napa from Southern California at age 17. He left for New York three years ago. 
A former high school shop teacher, Krazy George's lone job the last 30 years has been as a for-hire cheerleader ­working all of about three hours a week. Yes, that's it. He averages one game every seven days. 
In that first Wave game, the Yankees eliminated the /\s 4-0 to reach the World Series. Dave Righetti, now the San Francisco Giants' pitching coach, was the winning pitcher. A crowd of 47,302 was on hand for the first Wave. 
"We put it on the map in 1981," said Shooty Babitt, a rookie on the '81 Xs. "A lot of people wish the Wave would go away now. A lot of people don't understand when you should do it. ... The new-age fan does­n't understand where the Wave originated. But Krazy George still looks the same today as he did 25 years ago." 
Krazy George is a well­known figure at sporting ven­ues, especially in the Bay Area. Mostly bald with blond curls above his ears, he wears his striped athletic socks pulled up and always has a drum in hand. 
He has been featured in national magazines and TV programs and has several upcoming interviews with international publications. 
That game in Oakland was the biggest crowd yet for Krazy George, who had tried the cheer a couple of times at high school rallies. 
A simpler version originated at San Jose State several years earlier. Krazy George would call for the three student sec­tions to chant -one word for each group -"San!" "Jose!" "State!" He would point to each section signaling those stu­dents' turn. 
He also did something similar for the former Colorado Rockies hockey team, using "Go! Rockies! Go!" But it didn't work so well with only 5,000 fans in the seats many nights. 
He knows there are plenty of fans out there who refuse to participate or become grumpy when their view of the game gets briefly blocked. 
"There are always a few peo­ple," he said.

NBA 

Clippers challenge Lakers as top team in L.A. 
Host ofyoung players turning heads of So. California b-ball fans 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES -Elton Brand remembers how it used to be when his lowly Clippers played the mighty Lakers. 
"It was great if we could get a win for us and our fans," Brand recalled. 
How about now? 

"We expect to get a win against anybody in the league," he said. 
And that, of course, includes the Lakers, who have history on their side -but have finished behind the Clippers in each of the past two seasons. 
"We're definitely making our mark," Brand said. "It's two years in a row now. The Lakers' winning tradition, you can't take that away from them, of course." 
The teams share the Staples Center, but there's been a dis­tinct Lakers flavor there since it opened before the 1999-2000 season. And for good reason. 
High above the court on the south wall are the nine NBA championship banners the Lakers have won since moving to Los Angeles in 1960, and another representing the team's five titles in Minneapolis. 
The retired jerseys of former Lakers stars Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Wilt Chamberlain and Gail Goodrich hang nearby, along with a microphone honoring longtime announcer Chick Hearn. 
And the Clippers? Nothing. 
Maybe someday. 

"The city's big enough for two teams. Why not share the love?" Clippers guard Cuttino Mobley said. "The Lakers are supposed to get the credit. We're just try­ing to earn ours." 
The teams haven't had much of a rivalry since the Clippers moved to Los Angeles in 1984 because the Lakers have been so dominant, winning 80 of their 103 matchups. But the count is 4-4 the past two years, and with the Clippers on the rise, a rivalry appears to be brewing. 
"Rivalries can't happen until both teams are in the playoffs," Mobley said. 
That happened last spring, and the Clippers did their part to set up the first-ever postsea­son matchup between the teams by beating Denver for their first playoff series victory in 30 years. 
The Lakers led Phoenix 3-1 in their first-round series, but the Suns rallied to win the final three games, thwarting a poten­tial "Hallway Series" at the Staples Center. 
"That would have really been fun," Brand said with a wide grin. 
Like a long, leisurely homes­tand. 
"I was ready," Lakers forward Luke Walton said. "It would have been so much fun, people talking about it. You tried not to think about it because you were in another series." 
In the first five seasons after the Lakers left the Forum, they quickly put their stamp on the new Staples Center, winning three championships and advancing to the NBA Finals four times and the Western Conference semifinals once. 
The Clippers, meanwhile, had a 140-270 record and never made the postseason. 
Their fortunes began to 

reverse when the Lakers traded Shaquille O'Neal to Miami after the 2003-04 season, and sank to 34-48 the following year. The Clippers, meanwhile, showed significant improvement, going from 28-54 to 37-45. 
The Clippers added veteran Sam Cassell before last season, and improved 10 games to 47­35 for the second-best record in the franchise's 36-year history. The Lakers also got better, going 45-37 and returning to the playoffs. 
Regarding the dominance by the Lakers over the years, Cassell smiled and said: "It ain't that way no more, which is good for the city." 
But Reggie Miller, who grew up in Los Angeles, cautioned that because the Clippers' iden­tity has changed, so will the level of their competition. 
"I thought I would never say this, but it is slowly becoming a Clipper town," the former Indiana Pacers star said. "My biggest question is, will they be content? Will complacency seep in? ... Now when they go on the road, the Clippers are starting to sell out. It's not the Clippers of old that were pushovers. Teams will be getting up now for the Clippers." 
While the Lakers have last season's scoring champion Kobe Bryant leading the way, the Clippers have a superstar of their own in Brand, who fin­ished seventh in the NBA Most Valuable Player voting last sea­son. 
The Lakers have the most suc­cessful coach in league history in Phil Jackson. The Clippers have Mike Dunleavy, a top-flight coach in his own right. 
The Lakers have outdrawn the Clippers over the years, with most of their games selling out since Staples Center opened. 

But those numbers are evening out, too. 

The Lakers have sold between 13,000 and 14,000 season tick­ets, keeping some single-game tickets available. The Clippers have sold over 12,000 season tickets -a franchise record. And the average attendance at Lakers games last season was 18,883, and the average atten­dance at Clippers games was 17,376. 
Of course, sitting courtside at the Lakers is still a distinct priv­ilege, with the best seats priced at $2,200. For the Clippers it's less than half that amount. 
And, this being Los Angeles, both teams have their famous fans -Jack Nicholson and Denzel Washington attend most Lakers games; Billy Crystal and Penny Marshall support the Clippers. 
"There's definitely a rivalry now," Walton said. "Even some of my own friends, they're wearing Clipper jerseys. It's fun."

Oakland looks for Orel support 
Athletics interview former pitcher Hershiser for new manager job 
Associated Press 

OAKLAND, Calif. -The Oakland Athletics will inter­view former major league pitcher Orel Hershiser for their managerial opening. 
A's general manager Billy Beane will schedule a meet­ing with Hershiser, currently an ESPN baseball analyst, in Phoenix for sometime during the week of Nov. 6. 
Beane fired fourth-year manager Ken Macha on Oct. 16, two days after Oakland's season ended in a sweep by the wild-card Detroit Tigers in the AL championship series. The A's won a playoff series for the first time since 1990, ending a string of four straight first-round exits from 2000-03. 
Beane plans to take his time hiring the next manager and was still trading phone calls with Frank Thomas' agent, Arn Tellem, on Wednesday about getting something done to keep the 38-year-old slugger. The Big 
Hurt, who led the team with 39 home runs and 114 RBis, has a two-year offer on the table from the A's. 
The 48-year-old Hershiser went 204-150 during an 18­year playing career that included 13 seasons for the Los Angeles Dodgers, includ­ing his final year in 2000. He pitched for the San Francisco Giants in 1998. 
Hershiser rejoined ESPN earlier this year. The former NL Cy Young Award winner was an analyst for ESPN and ABC during the Little League World Series from 2000-01 and was on ESPN's major league Wednesday telecasts during 2001. 
He joined the Texas Rangers in November 2001 as an associate to former general manager John Hart, became pitching coach in June 2002, then was shifted last November to executive assistant to team president Jeff Cogen. Hershiser left the Rangers in February. 
Beane has had a prelimi­

nary phone conversation with Los Angeles Angels pitching coach Bud Black, who was expected to inter­view with the club soon. Black already interviewed with the San Francisco Giants about their manageri­al opening. 
Oakland's internal candi­dates who will have inter­views are bench coach Bob Geren, a close personal friend of Beane, and third­base coach Ron Washington. 
Washington also inter­viewed last week with the Texas Rangers about becom­ipg Buck Showalter's replacement. Washington and Geren both interviewed for the A's opening a year ago when the club briefly cut ties with Macha before bring­ing him back about a week later. Geren was promoted from bullpen coach in 2006. 
The 54-year-old Washington just completed his 11th season with the A's and is popular with the play­ers.

NHL 
Los Angeles can't control Wild in 3-1 defeat 

Sedin scores twice in Vancouver's 5-0 win 
Associated Press 
ST. PAUL, Minn. -The Minnesota Wild's stingy defense and goaltending are continuing to fuel the team's franchise-best start. 
Manny Fernandez made 35 saves and Brian Rolston scored two goals to help the Wild defeat the Los Angeles Kings 3­1 on Wednesday night. 
Holston scored his team-high seventh and eighth goals of the season, Todd White had a goal and two assists, and Pierre­Marc Bouchard added three assists for the Wild. 
Northwest Division-leading Minnesota (8-1-0) moved into a tie with Dallas for the Western Conference's best record. Buffalo {9-0-0) is the only team in the NHL with a better mark. 
"Hopefully we can keep going," Wild coach Jacques Lemaire said. "All the points that we're getting could be points that could help us make the playoffs." 
Brian Willsie scored a third­period goal for the Kings, who are 1-5-2 in their past eight 
In the offseason the Wild overhauled their defense, part­ing ways with Filip Kuba, Andrei Zyuzin, Daniel Tjarnqvist and Alex Henry and signing a trio of experienced defensemen with a history of winning -Kim Johnsson, Petteri Nummelin and Keith Carney. 
Fernandez's play also has been a bright spot. No longer splitting time with Dwayne Roloson, who was traded to Edmonton in March, the lOth­year veteran entered Wednesday's game with the third-best goals-against average in the NHL at 1.60. 
"Any defenseman that is on the ice, we have confidence that they're going to do their job," Bouchard said. "And Manny is doing a great job. He's making some key saves." 
Fernandez and the Minnesota defense have been particularly impressive against the power play. 
The Kings were 0-for-7 with the man advantage Wednesday as the Wild increased their NHL-best penalty-killing per­centage to 93.5.

Jacques has got his different opinion," Bouchard said. "I guess he wanted to try some­thing else, and it's good that he put us back together." 
The switch paid off quickly, when Rolston got the Wild on the board at 13:02 of the first period. White fired a slap shot from the left circle that Cloutier saved. Rolston gathered the rebound and backhanded the puck off the post and into the net. 
Rolston struck again for Minnesota's second goal, as he sped ahead of the pack, took a long pass from White and knocked in his own rebound from close in 8:34 into the sec­ond period. 
White gave the Wild a 3-0 lead with 5:02 left in the sec­ond. Bouchard collected the puck off the boards and passed it to White, who then beat Cloutier top shelf from the right circle. 
Willsie spoiled Fernandez's shutout bid at 10:53 of the third when he scored his first goal of the season, but the Kings could­n't mount a comeback against the defensive-minded Wild. 
"We're trying to play where the team has to beat five guys before they get a chance," Lemaire said.

The Vancouver Canucks took advantage of the Chicago Blackhawks being without four of their top players. 
Roberto Luongo recorded his first shutout with Vancouver, making 32 saves in a victory over the Blackhawks on Wednesday night. 
Luongo, acquired in a multi­player trade from Florida in the offseason, registered his 28th career shutout. 
"They· worked hard all night and outshot us 18-11 in the sec­ond period," said Luongo said. "Even though the score was a little lopsided they worked for 60 minutes.

Vigneault was pleased with the Canucks offensive break­through against Chicago. Vancouver hadn't scored more than four goals in a game this season. 
"We finally found a way to score a couple of goals," he said. "Roberto did a good job of shutting them down. Once we took a four-goal lead, it's chal­lenging for the opposition to have to score four goals off of Luongo."

Which path do you take? Which path leads to the most desirable ending? 
Well, Notre Dame has cho-. sen the path to the right, and that speck along the horizon may very well be a lucrative tournament finish -be it CCHA or NCAA or both. 
The team refuses to buy into the hype that has surrounded them in the days since they plowed through New England. They don't even think they are a great team, because, of course, it's only October and there are another 32 games to go.

on Sept. 10. Notre Dame took 1 7 shots -nine fewer than the 26 it took the first time around -while the Blue Demons man­aged 10 total shots Wednesday compared with just four in the teams' first meeting. 
DePaul's new strategy likely had much to do with the shot differential between the two games. In September, the Blue Demons attempted to run with the Irish and play a more open style of soccer. Wednesday, DePaul had no illusions of how it matched up, and stacked the box defensively. 
Not surprisingly, the Irish were not caught ofT guard. ·"We pretty much knew they were going to put

DePaul seem­ingly banked hopes of extending its season on shutting down an Irish offense whose 40 goals lead the Big East and picking up the decisive goal by converting a turnover into a productive breakaway or putting a shot in off of a set piece. 
While the Blue Demons did nate captain Wes O'Neill's words, of the post-win locker room barely held over to the next day, when the team crushed a competent Providence squad. The Irish are too good of a team to allow a slip up to happen -but good luck trying to get them to call themselves the g-word. 

They would much rather be called a consistent team than a good team. They know the teams that think they are good will eventually get lost in the brilliance of their own accom­plishments and emerge dazed and confused at the end of the road without a sense of direc­tion. 
They would rather remain in the dark and win -one game at a time.

It is the first time since sen­ior captain T.J. Jindra's fresh­man year, a season that ended with a NCAA Tournament appearance, that he can recall the Irish holding to such a stoic and no-nonsense philoso­phy. 
"We beat them on Friday, and we were happy," Jindra said. "But we took care of business, and we were already looking towards Saturday. That's the key to being a good team." 
And Irish coach Jeff Jackson hopes the entire team has adopted that attitude. 
He said that the coaching staff has prepared the team mentally for the obstacles that are generated by big wins, but it is only a matter of time to determine if it has worked. 
"We've made really good strides in a lot of areas," he said. "This is one that we haven't had before. This is one area that we haven't had to deal with yet." 
It will take several week­ends and more likely severitl months to see how the Irish deal with their newfound celebrity, but they are headed in the right direction. That shapeless horizon may, six months from now, brighten and reveal a hard-earned title. 
And if it does, Jackson, Jindra, O'Neill and the rest will be the first to say that cursed g-word.

Starting off on the right foot 
By GREG ARBOGAST Sports Writer 
The result was never serious­ly in doubt Wednesday night at Alumni Field as No. 8 Notre Dame efficiently dispatched of DePaul 2-0 to advance to the second round of the Big East tournament. 
The Irish outshot the Blue Demons 17-10, and the ball was in the DePaul half for nearly the entire evening. Despite its advantage in posses­sion, Notre Dame had trouble creating solid chances as DePaul seemed content to play defense, often bringing all 11 players back behind midfield. 
"Before the garrie, my mes­sage to the team was to be

The Blue Demons didn't have a chance, and they probably knew it as much as anybody. DePaul, 3-0 losers at Alumni Field earlier in the season and arguably the worst team to advance to the Big East tournament, didn't fare well in what will likely be its last game of the season. 
On paper, Notre Dame's performance against the Blue Demons in Wednesday's 2-0 win was less convincing than it was when DePaul last visited South Bend

Belles shake down the Thunder 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's ended its regu­lar season on a high note Wednesday afternoon with an 8-0 shutout of Tri-State. 
"It wasn't an ideal game right before the conference tournament, but I guess it was good to get a little confi­dence booster," said Belles coach Caryn Mackenzie. 
The Belles (5-8-1, 4-3-1 MIAA) wasted no time in establishing the tempo of the game, controlling the ball on offense for the first nine min­utes of play. The Thunder (0­
