VOL. XIV, NO. 56

Court may decide today on abortion funding 

UNITED NATIONS (AP) -Sec­urity Council members agreed to meet on the U.S.-Iran crisis and the council president 'said the session probably would begin no later than · today despite an Iranian plea for a week's delay. 
Council President Sergio Pa­lacios de Vizzio of Bolovia told reporters he expected a meet­ing last night or today in response to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim's urgent re­quest that the 15-member coun­cil convene on the issue. 
Waldheim took the unusual step_ of calling the meeting 

Thieves rip-off Sr. bar; more reports of 0-C thefts 
by Mark Rust News Editor 
Break-ins and thefts were reported yesterday by the Senior Bar managers and off-campus students in unrelated incidents over the weekend. It was the first such break-in this semester at Senior Bar, and the off-campus theft was just one more in wh~t appears to be a growing number of assaults, thefts and attempted thefts reported by St. Louis and Notre Dame Avenue residents in the last month and a half. 
Intruders apparently entered Senior Bar late Friday night and escaped with a stereo system and an undisclosed amount of cash. Clare Stack, business manager, was reluctant to disclose the thieve's method of entry, but she reported that they left through the front door after breaking the ins1de lock. 
The value of the stereo system -two speakers, turntable and receiver -could not immediately be determined, according to Stack. 
Security is continuing to investigate the break-in, the only reported instance of theft on campus over Thanks~iving break. 
Michael Segobiano and Bob Carey, of 714 St. Lou1s St., reported another Friday night theft in which intruders took an entire console stereo unit, a portable TV I radio, electric typewriter and two clock radios. According to Segobiano the thievesrifted throughdrawers and found one of the clock radios in the unpacked su1tcase of a housemate who had just arrived from vacation. 
For the residents of 714 St. Louis it was the second theft this year. During fall break thieves helped themselves to a calculator, a 35 mm camera, $250 worth of stereo equipment and a small amount of cash. Police still do not have a lead on either of the two thefts, al cording to Segobiano. ­
St. Louis Street and nearby Notre Dame Avenue have been the scene ofnumerous assaults and break-ins in the last month and a half, according to students living in the area. Those cnmt:!>~, and the gruwing tensions arising from them among reszdents zn the near north< ...st neighborhood area, will be the subject ofa two part series on offcampus crime appearing this week in The Observer. 

WASHINGTON (AP) -The Supreme Court said yesterday it may decide whether Congress can refuse to pay for most abortions wanted by women on welfare. 
Once again taking up one of the nation's most divisive legal and social topics, the court agreed to hear arguments over the constitutionality of the abor­tion-spending restriction. 
But the justices left them­selves an escape route. First they will have to decide they

The court will study the Hyde amendmem passed for fiscal year 1978, which bars Medicaid spending for abortions unless a woman's life would be endan­

gered by childbirth, in cases of promptly reported rape or in­cest, or when two doctors say childbirth would cause "severe and long-lasting physical health

damages to the mother.'' 
j

Congress earlier this month agreed on a new and more re­4 strictive spending ban for fiscal year 1979, eliminating the "se­vere and long-lasting physical 
I

A federal judge in Chicago last April struck down the spending restriction -both the Hyde

amendment and the Illinois law patterned after it as unconstitu­tional. 
U.S. District Jud~e John Gra­dy ruled that Illinots must make Medicaid money available for all ''medically necessary'' abortions until a fetus reaches the point where it can survive outside the mother. 
Just when that viability occurs varies in individual cases. But it usually is sometime between the pregnancy's 20th and 30th weeks. 
In three separate appeals, ~he Carter admmistration, Illinois and two doctors representing the Americans United for Life Legal Defense Fund are urging the court to overturn Grady's ruling. 
"In forbidding the use of federal fund.s for any abortions other than those in certain limited categories, Congress was motivated by two legiti­mate concerns: the desire to encourage normal childbirth and to protect the potentiality of human life, and the desire to avoid spending tax revenues to support an activity that many taxpayers find morally repug­nant,'' Justice Department lawyers argued.

Demand cools; lending 
rate 
drops 
NEW YORK (AP) -Some major banks cut their prime lending rates yesterday to 15% percent, responding to lower costs for acquiring funds and to cooling of demand by businesses for loans. 
Bankers Trust Co. of New York, the nation's eighth-lar­gest bank ranked by deposits, reduced its basic lending rate from a record 15 3f4 percent. It was the first reduction in the prime since the key rate began rising sharply last August. 
No. 11 Wells Fargo Bank, based in San Franscisco, quick­ly joined in the quarter-point reduction, as did several smal­ler regional banks. 
Banking industry analysts said they expected other major banks to join the move to lower primes rates. 
Bankers Trust Chairman AI­fred Brittain III said the reduc­tion "reflects a decline in our own cost of funds." 
Banking analysts said recent reports from the Federal Re­serve indicated a slowing in the growth of the nation's basic money supply and a decline in corporations' demand for cre­dit. 
The Federal Reserve Board has acted to make credit more costly in order to slow down a rapid growth in the money supply. Too rapid an expansion of the money supply is believed to aggravate inflation by put­ting more money into circula­tion than can be absorbed by the economy's output of goods and services. 
The encouraging money sup­ply figures indicate the Fed may be able to cease tighten­ing, or even ease, credit pcoli­

Guitars to twang 
ND Arts presents blues festival 
by Ann Hesburgh 
Notre Dame's Cultural Arts Commission presents the twang of the guitar, the wail of the harmomca, and the tinkle of the ivories in its 8th annual fall Midwest Blues Festival this weekend. 
The "Blues from the Bayou" can be heard in Stepan Center at 8 p.m. Friday Nov. 30 and the "Chicago Blues" at 7:15 
p.m. Saturday Dec. 1. The festival will include such blues originals as Roosevelt Sykes, ''Professor Longhair and His 
Blues  Scholars,"  and  Lonie  
Brooks.  
''The  reason  for  the  Blues  

Festival,'' Director Michael Wood commented, "is to pro­vide for the students as well as the South Bend community, the opportunity to join in an important American celebra­tion. I believe that the seven shows in all will be very representative of what the blues are all about." 
Festival tickets can be pur­chased at the door and will vary in price according to the night of performance and purchaser's status. Student admission is $5 Friday night, $6 Saturday night, or $8 for both nights. Non-student admission prices arc slightly higher, selling for $6 Friday night, $7 Saturday night, or $10 for both evening performary::es. 
The Festival is the "best kept secret on campus," Cultural -~!lst=<Wnmissioner David Elli­son said. ''Those who have 
attended  the  Festival  in  the  
past  have  never  left  disap­ 
pointed."  

Despite the recent cuts in the Cultural Arts Commission's ;il­loted funds, "the Festival will take place as usual," Wood said. He has devised several methods of acquiring additional monies that will "hopefully help to offset our operating cost of $2,500." This year both the T-shirt and concession sales will be run by Notre Dame students rather than private comp<ulies as in the past. 
The Festival will be casual and those desiring to bring blankets and bean-bag chairs are wel­come. Approximately 100-150 chairs will be available for those who desire them. ''Althou~h not well known,'' Publicity Chairman Tom May com­mented, "it's going to be a hell of a show." 
The "Honeydripper," Roose­velt Sykes, who has played in both U.S. and European Festi­vals, will be Friday night's first performer. According ~o the Cultural Arts CommissiOn, "he is unquestionably the gre!ltest living barrelhouse blues piano player and one of the most prolific bluesmen ever.'' This will be Sykes' second Festival appearance and his 50th year as a Blues performer. 
The Festival will close with Big Joe Williams, playing the unorthodox nine-string guitar, and the performance of Carey Bell's Blues Band featuring Lurrie ~ell. As paraphrased by Chuck Berry: ''The joint will be jumpin', goin round and round.'' 
StUdents 
to donate 
clothes 

All students are urged to participate in a clothing drive that is being sponsored by Volunteer Services after Thanksgiving, from November 26 to 30. 
Winter clothes, boots, towels and linens are much needed for the refugees that have settled in the South Bend area. Any unwanted items of clothing brought back from Thanksgiv­ing break can b~ placed in the depositories in your hall. 
Your help is greatly appreci­ated. 
cies that have drven money market interest rates to record highs. 
Larry Kudlow, analyst with Bear, Stearns &Co., said in­terest rates on short-term sources of lendable funds were dropping rapidly and there were signs of a general econo­mic decline. For these reasons, he expected lower prime rates to spread throughout the indus­try, perhaps by the end of the week . 
''This is the the beginning of a trend to lower prime rates," Kudlow said. 
The prime is the rate charged by banks to their most credit­worthy corporate customers. Other commercial and indus­trial borrowers pay higher rates for loans. 
The rate stood at 11 3f4 percent fro most of 1979, with some banks dropping to 11 112 percent briefly, until mid-August, when it tied the old record of 12 percent set during the 1974 credit crunch. 
After the Federal Reserve tightened credit on Oct. 6, the prime soared from 13 'h percent to IP/4 percent on Nov. 16. 
The prime rate does not directly affect consumer loan rates, which are controlled by laws in many states, but it. is · 
, widely followed as an indication of credit conditions generally. 
SMC . plans final dress rehearsal 
The final dress rehearsal of Saint Mary's eighth annual Madrigal Dinners will be held tonight in Regina Hall.

by Michael Mader 
"What's for dinner?" and "What's going on tonight on campus?" are the most fre­quent questions asked of the Ombudsmanservices, a volun­teer group made up of 120 students. 
OEiUD is primarily concerned with gathering information a­bour campus happenin~s and relaying that information to stud~nt~ by way of their phone servrce. 
Among ·other things, OBUD also holds the student b.ody and class elections each year and prints a resource manual con· raining information on every group concerned with the Uni­versity. OBUD also runs Opera­tion Brainstorm, an effort to gerber ideas on bertering the University, which in the past has resulted in the hair stylist on campus and trash cans on the quads. 
Recently they distributed the University phone books in each dorm on campus. In the event that anyone missed their copy, or if anyone at all would like to have one, heI she is encouraged to go to the Student Govern­ment office and pick one up. 
The hours of operation of the Ombudsman telephone service are: Monday-Thursday, 10 a.m. to 12 midnight, Friday, 10 a.m. to') p.m. and Sunday, 12 noon to 12 midnight. OBUD is closed on Saturday. The phone num­ber for the service is 6283 (OBUD).

One year later 

San Franciscans remember murders 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Dianne Feinstein won't sit in the chair where George Mas­cone was shot. Anne Kronen­berg gets'depressed the 27th of every month. And everyone remembers. 
They remember the day this 
lovely city turned ugly. The day 
. gunfire rang beneath the rotun­
. da. The day a mayor and a 
supervisor died. 

It was a year ago that Dan White, freckle-faced former fireman and police officer, walked into Mayor Moscone's City Hall office and shot him because he wouldn't give White his supervisor's job back. It's been a year since White reload­ed his gun, ran down the hall and shot Supervisor Harvey Milk because he smirked. 
For this city, still reeling then from the horror of the deaths of its own in faraway Jonestown, Guyana, the assassinations of its mayor and its first avowed homosexual official last Nov. 27 were almost more than could be borne. Now the pain has eased. State Assemblyman Willie Brown perhaps George Mas­cone's closest friend, says it is impossible to scar the ciry. San Francisco is too resilient, he says, too full of life to be obsessed, even with the death of loved ones. 
Perhaps he's right. As one sits in the mayor's office, the place Moscone loved so well, talking to his successor, music wafts through the window ­gaiety from the same plaza where thousands gathered to mourn Moscone and Milk and six months later came to rage against White and the justice he received. 

"Only time eases the blow," says Dianne Feinstein, whom fate made mayor and who now campaigns to win the office in her own ri~ht. "There are constant remmders -every time I walk in the back office, for example. I don't sit in the chair Mayor Moscone was in. 
''The memories are all around, as well they should be. They were men of such enor­mous personal humor and good will.'' 
The politics of George Mas­cone and Harvey Milk have receded from the mind's eye, but the memory of the men lingers. 
''The movement has felt Harvey's loss this year," says Anne Kronenberg, Milk's ad­ministrative assistant. "And it's felt George's. Th~y wc:re two liberal forces lost at once and no one has really replaced them. 
''But the thing that really gets me is not being able to share things with Harvey, to have him here to talk to. I see flashes of Harvey all the time. The 27th of every month is very difficult for me." 
For Frank Falzon, a homi­cide detective who considered Dan White a friend, the hard part is second-guessing · by others' and by himself. 
It was his seemingly sympa­thetic interrogation of White that became the turning point of White's trial, helping per­suade a/·ury that White was not a cold-b ooded killer, but a good guy gone wrong. 
"I remember everything that day vividly, every second is quite clear," Falzon says. "I've gone over it in mr. mind many times, wondering tfl could have done anything differently. 
''There was absolutely noth­ing I could change. I didn't have all the answers when I spoke to Dan White to do a complete, 100 percent job. I wish I had, but that's Monday morning quarterbacking." 
There's been a lot of that since the May 21 verdict, which found White guilty of voluntary 
manslaughter, and the gay riot 
it provoked. 
But the man whose court­
room skill kept White from a· 
murder conviction has no 
doubts. 
"I feel to this day that I just 
did a job for him like I'd do if 
Harvey Milk had shot and killed 
the other two fellows. I'd have 
done the same thing for him 
and been just as satisfied with 
the outcome . . . ,'' says Doug 
Schmidt, White's attorney. 
''There was substance to our 
defense and I don't feel respon­

Schmidt's client was sentenc­
ed to seven years and eight 
months in prison. He is now at

and no later than 1986.

There is no waiting for those who loved the men White shot. Instead they think about what was, what might have been ­and what is. ''A lot of people want the world to go back the way it was before Harvey's death," says Harry Britt, Milk's successor on the Board of Supervisors. "The world never goes back the way it was. We can't recreate the world before the assassinations but we can create a San Francisco that reflects the real­ity of now. "Harvey had a desire for immortality, a Jewish immort­ality, that the rdeas he shared with his close friends would not die out," says Britt, recalling Milk's efforts for homosexual rights and to organize the national gay march on Wash­ington on Oct. 14. "And that worked. The ideas that were in Harvey Milk's head will not die out.''

Rape A UJareness alerts UJornen 
by Paul Mullaney 
In an attempt to alert Notre Dame and Saint Mary's women to the realistic possibility and consequential danger of rape, the Ra~;>e Awareness Program is informtng students on both campuses how to be ready and react to assault situations. 
Susan Tamborini, residence director of Holy Cross Hall at Saint Mary's, is coordinator of the program which took root last year. She is being assisted by Kathleen Kearney. assistant rector of Farley Hall, and together they aim at communi­cating with the female stu­dents. 
''Our main goal is to make the students more security-minded,'' said Tamborini. "When a student walks on either campus, she must be aware and concerned with tak­ing care of herself. 
"Students have to realize that rape does indeed happen, and we try to help make them aware of this.'' 
The program emphasizes the problem of rape through dis­cussions, question-and-answer sessions and lectures by outside authorities. 
"We've had members of the Sex Offense Staff, a community agency, come and lecture on the topic," said Tamborini. "We've also had doctors and nurses from St. Joseph's Hos­pital speak on the required treatment of a rape victim." 
"Also, we've had a rape victim speak on the terribly emotional aspect of being as­saulted. She pointed out the real feeling of rape --with emphasis placed on the need of 
SMCsponsors spring trip to New York City 
by Melissa C. Cipkala 
Saint Mary's Counseling and Career Development Center is sponsoring '·campus/New York," a six day trip during spring break to New York City. The program is open to all SMC Notre Dame students regardless of their major or vear. Tony Campbell, assistant director of the Counseling and Career Development Center, will be supervising ~he activi­ties. Any interested student who wishes to learn more about the upcoming trip is asked to attend a meeting on Thursday at 6 p.m. in the Student Affairs Conference Room in the lobby of LeMans Hall. 
Campus/New York. will con­centrate on two maJor career fields, business and theater. Those interested in the busi­ness opfortunities have a wide range o meetings and activities to attend. Top executives of several national and multi­national corporations, speaking on retailing communicatio~, finance, and other topics, will assume the role of instructors during the visit. 
Officers and staff members will speak informally and answer qt'"'stions about their work, businesses, and job op­portunities for the future. The participants will also take guide'd' todrs..of the Wali"-Street Stock Exchange and the Feder­al Reserve Bank of New York. One afternoon will be left open for the students to spend as they wish; they may arrange interviews for themselves during this time. 
The trip will offer unusual opportunities to observe busi­ness from the inside and to learn about company training programs. The fee for business participants includes their six day-five night stay at the Cen­tury Paramount Hotel which is within walking distance of both Broadway and the subway, and tickets to two Broadway shows. Two of their evenings are left free. 
Theater participants will follow a program which pro­vides the opportunity to attend a variety of performances, such as dance, ballet, and opera, followed by seminars with lead­ing performers and authorities. Film screenings, studio tours, and rehearsals are. also part of this agenda. 
Included ~ their fee is all of the above, plus their six day­five night stay in the Paramount Century Hotel and tick:ts for four Broadway shows. Both groups have the option of touring Chinatown for a mini­ma:! fee which includes dinner. 
support from friends.'' 
Tamborini noted that the rec­tors' assistants and students on the respective residence hall fi.Qors are offered the program's exposure at Saint Mary's, while the rectors and their assistants at Notre Dame take part in the program, and are expected to reach the individual students on each floor. 
"We don't teach self-defense methods," said Tamborini. "If we trained someone to do something in self-defense, it might not work. It's more of a preventative program. We talk about the problem at the beginning of the year, and remind them of it throughout the year." 
Rape assault information cards have also been distri­buted on the Saint Mary's campus to help students react to rape if it does occur. ''The cards are the size of a credit card,'' said Tamborini. ''They let you know what to do in case of assault and rape -­like notifying the proper author­ities and hospital, etc." 
"This should help students· become aware of the serious­ness of rape. '' 
A joint committee betweetf'the two schools has been drafted to help resolve local rape prob­lems as best as possible. Co­ordinated by Dean of Students James Roemer. the committee is in search of methods to make both campuses safer fot wo­men. Both Tamborini and Kearney, ' as well as other concerned representatives from each s_chool, are serving em the committee.

Israeli leaders reconsider Mayor Shakaa's expulsion 
JERUSALEM (AP) -Israeli spokesmen, signaling a shift in attitude, said yesterday the government would reconsider the expulsion of Nablus Mayor Bassam Shakaa in exchange for a statement by him against terrorism and his voluntary resignation from office. 
A military review board which was to hear Shakaa's appeal against the expulsion order postponed its meeting for the second time to allow quiet contacts to continue. 
Israeli sources said con­sultations among Prime Minis­ter Menachem Begin's Cabinet on Sunday produced an agree­ment to explore the feelers put out by Arab mayors on Sha­kaa's behalf. · 
It was still unclear if a com­promise could be reached bet­ween the government's ·insist­ence that Shakaa be deposed as mayor and Shakaa's refusal to step aside, s~'Ui'ce; said. 
Shakaa was arrested Nov. 11 pending deportation following a discussiOn he held with a top army officer in which he alleg­edly condoned Arab terrorism. Shakaa said he was misquoted and that he opposes violence, although he blames Israel's 13­year occupation for the on-go­mg strife. 
Two previous attempts failed to persuade the government to drop the deportaton proceed­ings. Begin also received appeals for Shakaa' s release from the U.S. State Department and the United Nations General Assembly. 
A suggeston from some Arab mayors that Shakaa might quit apparently broke the ice in government thinking, Israeli sources indicated. But the mayors insist that Shakaa be reinstated. 
"We think that sould he resign voluntarily, there may be grounds for changing the situa­tion," said Cabinet Secretary Aryeh Naor. 
Elias Freij, mayor of Bethle­hem, said the mayors were seeking a compromise, but he refused to divulge details. Th~ state radio suggested that Sha­kaa might resign as mayor, but continue on the city council and remain active politically. 
Both sides apreared anxious for a solution that would prompt the West Bank's 25 mayors to retract their collective resigna­tions and to return normalcy to the West Bank.

Council enters sixth year amidst 
mcreastng 
demands 
by Tom Koegel StaffReporter 

The Advisory Council for Women Students has entered its sixth year of existence amidst increasing demands for a women's interest group to present the needs and goals of Notre Dame women to the campus as a whole. 
The Advisory Council was formed in 1974 to aid Sr. Assistant Provost John Miriam jones in assessing the opinions and problems of the growing number of women students. ''The council became my eyes and ears when the number of women became more than I could possibly see on my own,'' said jones. 
The Council has traditionallly been a behind-the-scenes force rather than a vocal advocate. "Ifthe Council feels the need to become more vocal, the Ad­visory Council will," Jones said. "However, I am not sure the Council is a forum for that." 
The Council consists of two member who are afpointed from each hall as wei as two off-campus representatives and the Student Government Coed Commissioner. The members ofthe council see its importance as an advisory counctl rather than an activities council. "We are more of an advisory council," comments Farley rep­re~entative Patty Hackett. "We try to find different areas which concern women and then work with the groups m­vovled.'' 
A recent example has been the rape crisis on and off campus. Members of the council have gone to Dean Roemer and Security to discuss different yvays in which security might be Improved. They have also spoken with landlords in the effort to e~courage better safe­ty precautions off-campus. 
The Council has sponsored various activities in the past, including discussions with women and women faculty members in the halls, and the past two years has sponsored an "Alumnae weekend," which brought back to the campus

U.S. suspects 
chemical 
warfare 
WASHINGTON (AP)  -U.S. intelligence officials stron~ly suspect that the Soviet Umon provided chemical weapons they believe were used against Laotian tribesman resisting communist Pathet Lao and Vi­etnamese forces. 
These officials, asking to re­main anonymous, said a team of Russian chemical warfare specialists was detected earlier this year in western Laos, scene of reported poison gas attacks on H'Mong hill tribesman who have never accepted communist victory in Laos. 
"We'll probably never be able 
to come up with conclusive 
evidence, but we have high 
suspicion that the Russians 
provided the chemical agents," 
one official said. 
An Army investigating group, 
including several doctors, con­
cluded that at least two and 
possibly three different chemi­
cals were used against the 
tribesmen -a nerve agent, a 
substance that caused massive 
bleeding, and probably a riot­
control gas. 
The Army investigators based 
their report on medical symp­
toms and other signs described 
by 43 tribesmen they interview­
ed last month at three refugee 
camps in northern Thailand. 
The tribesmen estimated 700 
to 1 ,000 people died and that 
many more were sickened as a 
result of attacks by planes and 
rockets. Whole villages were

been wiped out.

portant, legitimate function. 
U.S. District judge William Steckler and the 7th U.S. Circuit of Appeals, however, ruled that state authorities could not offer enough justifica­tion for interfering with what the Krishna society sees as its religious mission. 
The society practices "San­kirtan," a ritual requiring its devotees to go into public places to disseminate and sell religious literature and to solicit contributions. 
"We are not unmindful, as anyone cannot be who has traveled through a major air­port facility in recent years, that the practitioners of Sankirtan have been regarded as annoy­

Jones was quick to point out, however, that the Advisory ~ounci_l ~~ould not be judged on Its acuvmes. "The Advisory Council promotes change for the better; often, its successes are not seen as direct results of its actions." 
Hackett provided an example. ''When we heard about the two new dorms, we suggested that the Hall President's Council loo~ !nto it, and they set up the petition from there.'' 
The demand for activities is obviously one which frustrates the council. "Every year someone asks for more activi­ties, . but our main purpose remams ~s a response group," Jones said. 
The call for a women's interest group interests members of the council. As jones noted, "The Advisory Council was formed in part to help women adjust to Notre Dame. Maybe women here have passed the point of adjusting. Maybe it is time to take that next step.''

Weakened dollar boosts tourism 
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) ­Taking advantage of the weak· ened dollar, Europeans are crossing the Atlantic in record numbers to vacatio11 in M~a1ai Beach, providing a sorely need­ed boost to the area's tourist industry. 
Even at the height of Flori­da's winter season, tourist offi­cials say rates for a two-week vacation package compare fav­orably with traditional Europ­ean resorts such as Spain's Costa del Sol and the Canary Islands. 
"They're just about the same when you find that a good dinner in a restaurant or hotel in Florida is half what it costs

for the same meal in Europe," 
waysJohn Anderson, vice pres­
ident for marketing for National 
Airlines. ''When you toss in the 
reduced cost for sight-seeing, 
car rentals and shopping, Flori­
da becomes a real value. 

"We're promoting the hell out of what Florida offers -and it's working." 
) ust how many Europeans visit Florida isn't known. But based on reports from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Miami-Metro tourism director Lew Priceestimates that about 150,00() Europeans will visit Florida in 1979, compared to about 100,000 in 1978. 
. Price predicts the figure will be higher in 1980, with as many as 250,000 Europeans visiting Miami Beach via s,cheduled carriers such as National, Brit­ish Airways, Lufthansa, Iberia and Pan Am and on charter flights. 
) ames Loftus, Miami sales manager for British Airways, sa,s--the decline in the value of the dollar has been the key ingredient in the influx. 
"When they come to Miami, expecially in the summer, they discover the frice of a good 
hotel is $20 to 30 a night, while 
comparable room in Spain or 
the Canary Islands would_ cost 
three times as much," Loftus 
says. 
Average rates for travel and 
lodging for a two-week vacation 
range from $690 to $1,150 from 
Germany or England to Spain 
and $992 to $1 ,082 from Europe 
to Miami Beach during the 
winter season, Andersen says. 
Figures/rojected for next sum­
mer an fall show it will cost 
$560 to $700 from the Nether­
lands to Miami Beach compar­
ed to $506 to $662 for a similar 
trip between Amsterdam and 
Tenerife in the Canary Islands. 
Many of the package vaca­tions include tnfs to Disney World in Centra Florida and the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. Even St. Pet­ersburg and St. Augustine re­port increases in European tourists. 
But mo~t ~f the Europeans 
head to M1am1 Beach sometime . during the trip. "It's saving Miami Beach," says Peter Hed­
lund of the Americana Hotel.

Th(' Student Government, in cooperation with Psychological Services 'of the Student H('alrh Center, is conducting a Survey ofDrinking Behavior Among College Students the vveek of November 26th. Questionnaires will be administered by section leaders at the W('eklv section meetings in all halls. The Hall Presidents Council is coordinating the effort. Elkn Dorney. !-f.P.C. Chairman, is striving for a record-breaking return on questionnaires. Eal:h student !s a_ssured of anonymity: numbers are assigned to the questionnaires. By raking note ot thts number. the student can later examine posted lists in the halls to comrar(' his/her scores on questions related to alcohol use to norms obtained on the camrus<'S of other universities. Comparison can also be made to the total Notre Dame profile, and to the profile of his/her own residence halls. Also, feedback will be given on alrohol-related problems. ranging from a classic hangover to being arrested for driving

Pellegrim. ;  
Pellegrini· also  said  that  in  

filling out these questionnaires, the heavy drinkrr may bect>me aware that he has a problem. If not, at least ·awareness' on campus will be raised, Pelle­grim si:ated.

Presently, altohol r~ferrals and cases are up from past years, according to Pellegrini. "We do individu;\1 work ~s a result of referrals from Dean Roemer, hall rectors, resident assistants, friend~ or oh a student's own accord. 
Programs to teach resident assistants how to intervene and group therapy are rwo other methods used by Psych Ser­vices. "I think the most effective way to help people with drinking problems is when heI she is confronted by a peer," Pellegrini says. 
If the survey is to help these programs and the student body, honesty is a prerequisite, Pelle­grini said. "I am definitely depending upon the integrity of each student. This is a chance to help themselves, the univer­sity and possibly future stu­dents," Pellegrini said. 
Pellegrini is hoping for a good response and thinks that the Hall Presidents Council (which is coordinating the administra­tion and collection) has been highly efficient. 
About six months went into preparing this survey, accord­Ing the Psych Services Director Dr. Patricia Crosson. ''We are now counting on the coopera­tion of individuals in each of the residence halls," she stated. 

LONDON (AP) · Thomas Crap­per, the Victorian sanitary engi­neer, is norto be commemorat· ed by London's city . fathers after all. · ' 
A proposal to erect a blue plaque honoring the 19th centu­ry toilet-maker has been reject­ed by the Greater London Council's historic buildings committee, council spo~esman Victor Kenny said yesterday. 
"Memorable though · Crap-per's name might be In popular terms," said the decision, "evi­dence from the Patent Office shows that he was not a notable inventor or pioneer in his chosen field and therefore the case for the plaque . is not justified." 
There are about 400 blue plaques on buildings around London commemorating fa­mous men and women who lived or worked here: notables such as Charles Dickens, Vin­cent Van Gogh and South American liberator Simen Boli­var. 
Crapper, born in Yorkshire in 1837, moved to London and achieved fame through the manufacture of sanitary equip­ment, including an early model flush toilet. He died in 1910 but the firm he founded remained in business through the 1960s. 
The council's researchers fail­ed to find any patents for Crapper's "flushing device" and said contemporary plumb­ing textbooks didn't even men­tion him, 
It had been proposed that Crapper's one-ume residence at Thornsett Road, Anerley, or his rwo addresses in Buckmas­ter Road, Battersea, all in south London, should bear the plaque.

gap to 5-4 on scores by Steve Hennessy at 12:42 and Brock Tredway at 13:46. Irish goalie Bob McNamara, who totaled 33 saves, and his defensive corps held on and Meredith capped the victory with an open-net goal with just 10 seconds re­maining. It was his 12th goal of the year. 
Friday night things were not as easy, and as was the case in the second of the series, Notre Dame found itself having to fight back from a two-goal deficit. 
Following a 2-2 first period tie, the Big Red struck with two goals by Tredway and Steve Jankowski. Tredway's goal came with Irish defenseman Scott Cameron off for trippins. He beat Notre Dame goalte Dave Laurion with a 40-foot slapshot at 5:09. Laurion pro­tested vehemently that Cor­nell's Doug Berk had set up shop in the crease, but it was to no avail. 
Jankowski's goal came just 
1:07 later and gave the Big Red a 4-2 advantage. 
But the Irish tied the score on two goals set up by defense­men. Don Lucia (no relation to Dave) fired a slapper from the right point whtch Meredith deflected by Eliot at 10:38. 
Just 26 seconds later, Scott Cameron found Logan streak~ by the All-Star break, finished with an 11-5 record and 14 saves for the West Division champion Angels. 
Davis, recalled from the mi­n<_>rs when Yankee bullpen ace Rtch Gossage was stdelined with an injured thumb, posted a 14-2 record with nine saves. Baumgarten was 13-8 with a 
3.53 earned run average for the White Sox and Putnam batted .277 with 18 home runs for Texas.

Notre Dame overwhelmingly defeated Miami, 40-1 5, Sunday afternoon (late Saturday even­ing ESl) in the third annual M1rage Bowl, playing under a steady downpour and before a Tokyo crowd of 66,000 in Nat­ional Olympic Stadium. The Notre Dame victory over the Hurricanes, a fitting opponent granting the weather condi­tions, capped off the 1979 Notre Dame season with a final record of 7-4. 
Senior captains Vagas Fergu­son and Dave Waymer both finished fine Notre Dame car­eers with outstanding perform­ances. Ferguson scored three touchdowns and rushed for 177 yards in 35 carries, giving him 
I .4 .17 yards for the season and -~ .472 yards for his career. Waymer was equally brilliant for the day with two intercep­tions which were both returned for scores. In the second quarter, Chuck Male kicked a 35-~·ard field goal, his 13th this year and a new season record. 
Notre Dame's first score came after Miami roughed punter Dick Boushka in the first quarrer. The ball was advanced to the Miami 28-yard line and Ferguson punched through for a srore from the two-yard line

ROCHESTER. N.Y.. With all 
the assorted injuries and trou­
bles the Notre Dame hockey 
team has been having lately, an 
administrative decision to 
change the team's official co­
lors from blue and gold to black 
and blue can't be too far away. 
But while this decision is 
being pondered, the Irish are 
doing something the skating 
wounded are not supposed to 
do·-win 
The latest triumphs for coach Lefty Smith's crippled crew took place in upstate New York over most people's preseason favorite to win the Eastern Collegiate Atheletic Conference title, Cornell University. The Irish took a 5-4 overtime victory over the Big Red Friday night at the Lynah Rink in Ithaca and completed the sweep with a 6-4 victory Saturday before 5,63 2 at the War Memorial in Roches­ter. 
The wins boosted Notre Dame's overall record to 7-4 and give the Irish a three-game win streak. The Irish take their -1-4 Western Collegiate Hockey Association record back into league action this weekend when they play at Wisconsin. 
The series was the opener for Cornell and puts irs record at 0-2. 
''Overall we got an excellent performance down the line," said Smith, "from the goalies all the way up to the forwards. The injuries have really been piling up on us and we have had to do a lot of juggling. But the team has adjusted admirably and, to say the least, we are pleased to come away with a sweep. 
''This team is the most injury 
riddled club I have coached at 
Notre Dame. The players have 
faced a lot of adversity but they 
are showing a lot of character. 
And in the process, we are even 
developing some depth on both 
offense and defense.'' 

Perhaps the best example of that depth was the play of freshmen forwards Rex Bello­my and Dave Lucia. After Mark Sicoly hurt a knee in Friday's contest and Jeff Perry was forced to leave Saturday's game during the second period due to illness, left wing Bill Rothstein found himself the only survivor of that line. 
Smith moved Bellomy and Lucia up with Rothstein, and the newly formed trio respond­ed with two third-period goals S~turday, including the game wmner. 
The Irish had fought back from a 2-0 deficit. Andre Proulx scored in the first period for Cornell and Steve Hennessey added one 22 seconds into the second period. But John Schmidt, Greg Meredith and JeffLogan scored three straight goals to give Notre Dame a 3-2 lead after two periods. 
Meredith's tally came on a wrap around shot past Big Red goalie Darren Eliot at 7:4 5 after the Irish right wing had worked the puck free from the corner. Schmidt set up Logan's goal with a one-handed pass to the streaking right wing at 12:27. 
But Beflomy, Lucia and Roth­stein teamed to seal the win early in the third period. Bello­my notched his first career goal at 3:06 on a rebound shot from the slot. Lucia set up Roth­stein's game winner at 5:52 when he carried the puck from the Irish zone down ice and fed the sophomore for his sixth goal of the year. 
Cornell showed continued signs of life midway through the stanza and narrowed the

five plays later. Waymer's first interception and score came later in the quarter to bring the score to 14-0. 
In the second quarter, Miami sustained a 66-yard drive that allowed Gary Breckner to score from the one. Afterwards, a Notre Dame drive stalled out on the one-yard line and Miami took possession, only to be forced to punt. Sophomore linebacker Bob Crable blocked the punt and the ball slithered out of the end zone for a safety. Male's field goal came later in the quarter, bringing the half­time score to 19-7 in favor of the Irish. 
Ferguson scored from the I I -vard line late in the third pn.iod. His third touchdown came early in the fourth quarter on a two-yard effort. The final Notre Dame score came from Waymer's second aerial theft and 27-yard return. With only four seconds left in the game, Miami running back Breckner scored from the one-yard line, leaving the score of the contest 4~-I 5 after a two-point conver­
SIOn. 
The Irish amassed 22<.> yards rushing and 21 yards passing 
for  an  offensive  total  of 250  
yards.  Notre  Dame's  record  
stands  as  the  poorest  in  16  

regular seasons, bur the victory over Miami was an impressive display of talent and marked a strong comeback from succes­sive losses to Tennessee and Clemson. 
At Chicago 

Sailors finish ninth 
National prominence is noth­ing new to Notre Dame athletics · football, basketball, hockey, fencing, sailing . 
Sailing? That's right, sailing. This weekend in Chicago, the Notre Dame Sailing Club braved 20­degree temperatures and strong winds and finished ninth in the Fall National Sailing Championships. 
Junior captain Phil Reynolds finished fourth in the A division with Margarita Cintra as crew. In the B division, Greg Fisher sailed to a 14th place finish with Jane Brown and Carol Silva as crew. 
''The cold weather wasn't so bad," said Reynolds. "Last year we sailed in a blizzard. The 
wind  was  terrible  though.  On  
Saturday,  16  boats  capsized.  
We, were  just  lucky  to  hang  
on.  

Though the weather may not have been ideal for splashing around in Lake Michigan, all of the 18 teams that made it to the nationals had to endure the same conditions. It seemed that the nation's service academies were best prepared as two of them fmished one-two in the standings. Kings Point, the Merchant Marine Academy took top honors and Navy finished second. 
An ND man joins hisfriends

Pt·ople around here talk in lofty tones about all rhe Notre Dame legends... names you can look up in record books or find inscribed on the gold-plated trophies that line the walls of the ACC. Unfortunately, most of those heroes come from days we can only read about; one of the shortcomings, I'm afraid, of being young. 
But Mike the usher remembered them all. A short. round fellow who didn't have hair on his crvstal ball scalp, Mike had been at Notre Dame "(or over 50 years!" he'd always say J'roudly wi.th a smile that revealed he enjoye every mmute. 
I never knew his last name until I saw it in the obituary section of last Monday's South Bend Tn.hune. To me he was just Mike the usher. Hut, quite honestly, I don't think he wanted to bC" anyrhmg else. 
t\like Kalmar worked the press box door at everv Notre Dame football, basketball and hork.ey game for the last 30 years. "Only game I missed was in '46 when I was sick," he told me once. He even worked concerts. ("But I gotta bring my earplugs for those.") I met him at the Blue-Gold game my freshman year and I never got tired of hearing his stories about all the people in all the books they peddle at the bookstore for "Regularly $10.98 but this week only $5.95!"' 
" (remember when 01' Rockne ... " and another Mike the usher srory would begin. He knew 'erri all. .. Gipp, Rockne. Leahy--but for Mike it wasn't name-dropping. These people were just his friends. 
"When I was a kid I would sell newspapers outside Cartier Field before football games,'' he reminisced. "i.ock would come by and ask all us kids if we wanted a job. We'd all say 'Sure Rock I' so he'd bring us all into the game with him and let us fetch water or carry a bag or something.

"He really didn't need us," Mike grinned with a twinkle in his eye. "Rock was just that kinda guy. Always doin' things for people." 
Oncf' I asked Mike if I could write a story about him for The Ohserver. "Yo1've got so many stories you could write a hook." I kidded him. 
' Maybe I will," he'd say witi1 mock serious­nC"ss. "I could write a great one ... call it All My Fnl!nds At Notre Dame.'' 
"Think of all the money you'd make," I prodded. 
"No sir." he retorted as if I offended him. "I'd give every cent back to Notre Dame. I could nc·ver make any money off my friends.'' 
Bur he still refused to let me write about him. 
"On me?'' he said incredulously. "I never did nothin' worth more 'n two or three words. All I am is an usher, a pretty good one, mind you, bur· still jusr an usher. I'll tell you some great stories. but leave me outta it." 
Which is probably what will happen, since Mike the usher never scored a touchdown or hit a jump shot to beat UCLA. In fact, he didn't even go to school here bur, at his wake last week. Mike the usher was all dressed up in his familiar blue jacket and blue and gold tie. 
"That's what he wanted," said his wife. "He loved Notre Dame with all his heart and soul and he always said that the greatest thing about the place was all the good people who came there." 
And he should know. because he was cerrainly one of them.
