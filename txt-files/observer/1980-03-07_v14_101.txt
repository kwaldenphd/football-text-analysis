A reformed alcoholic, identi­fied as David (who is a senior at Notre Dame), addressed an Alcohol Awareness Workshop last ni~ht in the Haggar Hall auditonum. The workshop, SP.onsored by theJudicial Coun­cll, was run in cooperation with the Department of Psychologi­cal Services. 
David's drinking experience began at the age of sixteen, with his father's approval. "At first I only drank on weekends, but I later became involved with work, and didn't have the time to drink with friends anymore,'' David said. "Since I couldn't drink on weekends, 1.began to 
·drink in school. My employer bought my first bottle of booze !or me," he admitted.

Reforllled ND alcoholicspeaks out 
David lost control of the quantity of alcohol he drank during his junior year of high school. ''I began drinking straight alcohol to get the effects of it more quickly. I didn't drink for pleasure any longer. I just wanted to get drunk." 
When David realized his prob­lem, he went to a counselor. "I went dry for three months, and by senior year I was a controlled drinker," David said. "I realized that I had a problem, and decided to quit drinking for colle~e." 
Davtd resumed his drinking second semester of his fresh­man year. "I began drinking on weekends to socialize, " he said. "I then began drinking on weekdays. I didn't cause any trouble when I was drunk, so I wasn't reported to the rector or 
R.A. I usually passed out by 8 p.m." 
After first semester of his sophomore year, David joined 
Alcoholics  Anonymous.  He  
cited  the  attitude  of  Notre  
Dame  students  as  a  maJor  

reason for the drinking prob­lems among them. "Most students drink in order to get drunk,'' David said. ''The intention is not to have a few social drinks when a student goes our with friends to the bars," he explained. 
Peggy Cronin, a counselor with psychological services, noted that the University's image invites heavy drinking. ''The image of the fighting Insh stands for heavy drinking,'' Cronin said. "Of all of the problem drinkers that I have dealt with in the past five years, the Notre Dame experience has nourished their problem.'' 
Tom Rudy, a student intern with psychological services, ex­plained the importance of the term "enabling" at the work­shop. "Enabling is taking care 
of the consequences of alcohol­ism so that the drinker can't see the problems resulting from his drinkin~," Rudy said. "En­abling 1mpowers a person to continue drinking,'' Rudy said. David cited his boss in high school, his roommates, and his 
R.A. as enablers. "My room­mates and RA said nothing about my drinking," David said. ''They only complained when I drank during the week. They still say that I didn't really have a drinking problem." 
David added that lack of activities on campus,'' he said. ''I'm never bored on weekends, and I don't drink. Students choose to drink. I've seen students bring alcohol and pot to movies and concerts here," he observed. 
Jim O'Hare, judicial coordi­nator, and John Gechwind, special projects commissioner hosted the Jrogram. "I was disappointe by the represen­tation of the halls," O'Hare said. ''Only ten halls were represented. I was pleased by the cooperation of the depart­ment ofPsychological Serv1ces. ''The materials shown by Dr. Pelligrini were good, and should be considered for use in the halls.'' 
Dr. Pelligrini is a clinical psychologist with the psycho­logical services.

Lewis Hall aids mother 
byEar/Rix 

Lewis Hall residents, in con­junction with the South Bend Justice and Peace Center, are assisting a young unwed mo­
 ther and her newborn baby. The girls are providing for­mula, diapers, bottles, and other infant needs, as well as clothing for both mother and child. The center has referred the mother and infant to the appropriate social welfare a­gencies, and has provided them with a place to stay. The mother recently arrived in South Bend and was forced to quit her job shortly before the birth of her child. She was running out of money and living in a motel before she turned to the Center for help. One of the ftrst things the Center did was to show her where to ftnd free medical help. After the Center discovered that no government assistance was immediately available, they found housing for her. About this time, Kathy Bego, community services director for Lewis Hall, contacted the Cen­ter and ~res~~ desire to sponsor a family in conjunction with Lent. The girls started preparing for the baby's birth and the baby arrived three and one j:y,ljfweeks early on Feb. 22. Bego and Sue Fleck, also of Lewis, are currently coordina­ting the efforts of about fifteen Lewis women who are actively involved in the effort to help the young mother and child. A great deal of clothing ;has already been donated for-the mother and $75 which was donated at mass last Sunday was spent on necessities for the baby. · The girls are currently shopping for a crib and clothing for the baby and soliciting contributions from within the Hall. The Center, located at 136 South Chapin Street in South Bend, is manned by a Holy Cross priest, sister, and brother along with several volunteers who specialize in refernng: of people who ask them-for assis­tance. 
Rita Kopczynski, a worker at the center, said, "The woman couldnt believe that the girls were so generous. Sometimes it seems what we're doing are band-aid cures, but people need help to survive and get on to the next day and we're there. 
The students came into a real 
situation and could do some good. They showed the woman that there can be a little bit of hope, and some things that were positive," she said. 
Kopczynski added that for the students the young mother represented "a situation out there that we usually don't see.'' 
Earlier in the year, Sarin students srent several week-· ends paintmg the center. 
Maura Baker, rector of Lewis Hall, expressed pride in her students. "When the members of a dorm unite in order to reach out to fulfill the needs of others they are engaging in a most significant activity." 
Baker added, "It's a gesture 
that comes out of our liturgy 
and it is especially nice when 
it's tied to our liturgical celeb­
ration. I'm at the same time 
grateful and humbled by the 
willin~ness of students to be 
attentive to the needs of other 
people," she concluded. 


Negotiations resutne today in Colotnbia 
BOGOTA, COLOMBIA (AP) -Guerrillas holding the Domin­ican Republic Embassy freed one hostage, and a government official said face-to-face nego­tiations would resume today on , guerrilla demands for the re­le~se of 311 alleged political pnsoners. 
Austrian Ambassador Edgar Selzer, freed because his wife was gtavely ill, appeared healthy when he changed planes in Caracas, but told a JOurnalist he had not eaten in eight days, the Venezuelan state news agency reported. 
Rudolf Lenhart, First Secret­ary at the Austrian Embassy, said Selzer, 47, "was freed for humanitarian reasons be~se his wife is dying in Vienna. 
His release leaves 14 am­
bassadors or acting ambass­
adors in the embassy, including 
U.S. Ambassador Diego Hsen­cio, plus an undetermined ­number of other hostages. An estimated 29 guerrillas, one of them wounded, are in the building. 
Foreign Minister Diego said the government would ·resume face-to-face negotiations with

Harold Stassen quickly won the delegates approval when. he 
opened his talk by calling this "the outstanding college mock convention in the country." 
Stassen drew an ovation from the delegates, saying, "In my uphill battle for the Republican nomination, nothing could be more appropriate than starting out on the campus of the "Fighting Irish" of Notre Dame,'' adding that he had just come from the ACC where he ''breathed a little of the super­charged air that inspired Notre Dame in its upset of DePaul.'' 
Stassen said that, although he believes in a strong and alert defense, he also believes a sound foreign policy and volun­teer reserves are adequate, and o_pposes a compulsory peace-
must. this power

with the Congress so that no 
mistaken shortcuts in foreign
policy can occur, and so that our youth can be free to make plans for the future,'' he said. 
He added that the numbers 
of v~s:iteer servicemen have 
been1~Jdecreasing because 
''They have been discouraged 
from doin_g what they have been 
trained for." He pointed to 
Carter's decision to halt con­
struction of the B-1 bomber as 
an example of this discourage­
ment. 
The last speaker, Dr. George 
Crane, affirmed the merits of 
Republicanism in general rath­
er than speaking directly about 
his son, Rep. Phil Crane. He 
did refute the other candidates 
positions of age and exper­
ience, highlighting his son

youth and charisma. 
"All the Repub_lican candid­
ates are good men,'' Crane 
said, "but we need someone 
who appeals to the ten million 
voters who don't know one 
issue from another.'' These 
voters generally decide in the 
week before the election on the 
basis of television appearances. 
We need someone who looks

"The third round of convers­ations will take place to­morrow,'' he told reporters as he left the presidential palace last night after meeting with President Julio Turbay Ayala. 
Freshmen party tomorrow 
The Freshman Advisory Council is sponsoring a Fresh­man Class Party tomorrow from 10 P.M. until 1 A.M. in the LaFortune Ballroom. The cost of admission is $2 to help defer the cost of the upcoming Fresh· man Formal. Tickets may be purchased from the Freshmar. Advisory Council representa· rive from your dorm.

good in the living room," he said. 
"Phillip is also one of the first to stress that our alleg­iance is the only one that mentions the deity,'' said Crane, as he was being issued from the platform because of lack of time. 
Slow deliberations and hag­gling marked the platform de­bates. After the preface word­ing --change, the delegates took over two hours to debate and pass an amendment not to support ''further research and development of the neutron bomb." 
The amendment passed by a 511 to 486 vote. 
By the time this amendment 
had passed, the majority of the 
delegates were streaming out 
the doors, and probably no 
more than one-third of the 
convention remained by mid­
night. At this point, confusion 
set in. 

Interpretations of "Robert's 
. Rules of Order," the official rules of the convention, varied widely and changed often, over whether or not a quorum ex­isted. At approximately 1 a.m., Chairman Kresse declared that a quorum did exist and further quorum calls would be out of order. 
However, during a vote on a capital punishment amendment at close to 2 a.m., another quorum call was requested. 
Kresse's interpretation at this point changed, and after protest froq;t a majority of the remaining delegates, Kresse declared that a quorum did not exist and closed the convention at approximately 2:15 a.m. 
Consideration of the platform will continue tonight, prior to all speakers and the vote on the presidential candidates, and the vote on the presidential 
 candidates, and the major dif­ferences on the issues between the candidates are expected to be brought out at this time.

The Observer 
An Tostal hosts 'unwinding' 
An Tosral will sponsor a campus wide ''unwinding Happy Hour in coordination with the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's String Collectors Club, ac~tJ>rding to Mark Derby, 
string club president. 
l"he non-academic organiza­ti~ chartered this past fall be~n with three hundred me ers, according to Derby. 
''W became associated with AnTo al after I spoke with Chair n John Callaway on Activit" ~ Night," he explain­
ed. \ 
Derby said that the group's ultimate goal is to organize the collection M .en_o}-lgh: strin& to reach Ireland. Their Immediate goal, he said, is to collect enought to reach Ireland, West Virginia, a town of sixty people. 
Newly appointed An Tostal Coordinator Mike Martinez said that competition among dorms should begin immediately. 
Every hall must collect their own ball of string and the treasurer of the Collector's Club will check the purity of the string to insure that twine, clothesline, and other types of rope do not "pollute the ball.' 
Derby warned that An-Tostal Hall Representatives should in­sist upon section collection of string rather than allowing each student to amass his or her own string. 
''People become attached to their ball of string," Derby said. ''A prime example is Tim Przybylowski--he refuses to 
donate his string! If the coiiection is communial, it's not so hard to give up,'  Derby observed. 
Martinez said that at the proposedHaPP.Y Hour, each ball of siring wlll be weighed. 
"Hopefully, the hall that has gathered the most string will be awarded a one-way bus ticket to Ireland, West Virginia," he a~ded. . . 
Then all the stnng_ wtll be 
rolled together," Marnnez ex­
plained. ''Big contributors will  
be allowed to write their names 
on the ball,'' he said. 
"We've been recording dates 
and special events on our roll 
(of string)," Derby said. 
"Three thousand years from 
now this could be an important 
historical artifact,'' he added. 
The Club was originally start­
ed to enhance the social atmo­
spere of the University, to 
beautify the campus of Our 
Lady and unify the students and dormitories of this community in the pursuit of a common goal" Derby explained. 
He said that Student Activities refused to charter the club unless. it could attest to some redeeming social value. 
"So we included in our Consti­tution campus beautifying field trips to be held at least twice every semester," Derby said. "We haven't even hi!.d a meeting yet. I don't think we'll be charered next year." 
"The Presidency has not been too demanding," he explained, adding, "It may help me get into law school" His main function, he said, is to "chair meetings and always be on the ball " 
· 
He said that the secretary has the most rewarding. ''She will contaCt Norris McWhirter when the appropriate time comes. McWhmer currently edits the Guinness Book of World Re­cords. 
The record is presently held by a farmer who has amassed a twelve foot hight ball of string weighting two tons. "It only took 30 years! '' Derby con­eluded 

In Pakistan 
President Zia agrees to inspection 
ISLAMBAD* Pakisnin (AP) ­Pakistan's president said yes­terday he would allow inspec­tion of border refugee camps to show that Afghan rebels are not being trained and armed there, and he suggested posting an international peacekeeping force in Afghamstan to help end the crisis there. 
In Washington, U.S. analysts said Soviet troops have moved in force to clear Afghan rebels out of the Konar Valley in Eastern Afghanistan, perhaps ind!cating the; start of a Sovtet sprmg offenstve. 
Analysts in several govern­ment agencies, who asked not to be identified, said the Soviet thrust has reached as far as Bariko-wt,· . a village on the Afghan-Pakistani border. A­long the way, the Soviets used rockets and gas to clear out villages which had been rebel strongholds, they said. 
F"restident Gen. 'Mohammad Zia Ul-Haq, addressing Paki­stan's elected representatives, said Afghanistan could seal its border with Pakistan to satisfy itself that no arms or rebels are being sent from Pakistan. The Soviet Union moved thousands of troops into Afghanistan to back a government coup in December and U.S. officials estimate about 80,000 remain, helping the Afghan army fight Moslem rebels. 
Zia described as ''totally base­less'' charges that Pakistan has been providing military training and arms to rebels and said he would permit inspection of the camps m Pakistan by an intern­ational body ''any time it wants'' to prove that only humanitarian relief is being provided. 
Pakistan rejected an offer of $400 million m U.S. aid intend­ed to strengthen its defenses against any Russian threat. It said it would depend upon its own "unity and strength" and the "time-tested friendship" of China. 
President Carter's adviser Brzezinski said Pakistan's re­jection of the aid "suits us just fine." He said yesterday that he thought Pakistan was right in feeling its security interests were not best served by a highly visible defense relation­shtp with the United States. 
Zia's foreign affairs adviser Agha Shahi, said withdrawal of Russian troops from Afghan­istan would enable Pakistan and the Soviet Union "to im­mediately repair our bilateral relation'' Shahi said Pakistan's stand on the troop withdrawal was free from ''any element of anti-Sovietism.'' 
He also said no defense pact between Pakistan and China wouJ,4 be necessary because of the ''dependable frienship'' be­tween the two countries. 
In Washington, the State De­partment said Soviet forces appear to be making prel?ara­tions to remain in Afghamstan indefinitely. They have estab­lished a command structure, are digging wells, laying cables 
[continued from page 1} 
Although events in South­west Asia have Stassen concer­ned, he stressed that he is ~ opposed to any peacetime mili­tary draft as well as draft 
registration. 
"I think one of the most 
serious impositions on young 
people's freedom, and one of 
the most destabilizing factors in 
their lives is to be drafted when 
we're not at war," Stassen 
said. ''I was against the jungle

Gulf has me worried.''

The leader of the rebel move­ment that claims to be Afgha­JOistan's largest anti-Com­munist group rejected links with the Islamic Alliance for the Liberation of Afghanistan ­announced earlier in the week. Gulboudin Hikmatyar told a news conference his Hizbe Islami (Islamic Front) refused to join the alliance because its members were mostly based outside Afghanistan and had no genuine combat force.

South Bend prepares for census 
The Census Bureau in South Bend is preparing for the numeration of this area's popu­lation in the 1980 census next month. The Constitution re­quires that the federal govern­
1ment hold a census every ten years, which it has done since 1790. ' Anne Doran, the U.S. Census &reau regional director, said that the Census Bureau will work with the Notre Dame admiqistration in obtaining data f~r on-campus students. She str~sed that it is important for off-c pus students to fill out the orms that they will receive in the mail. 
Housing, Office Director Fr. Michael Heppen said that his office will provide a list of students in University housing units to the Census Bureau. Heppen emphasized that the students should fill out the questionnaires when they 
Playwright to view production 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's Theatre in conjunction with the Notre Dame Soph­omore Literary Festival will welcome British playwright Da­vid Hare on Saturday to view his play Teeth 'n' Smtles now in its production week on the Saint Mary's campus. Hare will also run workshops for the Literary Festival. 
Hare was born in Sussex, England in 1947. He rean the Portable Theatre, a traveling experimental theatre group, for three years for-1968-1971. He was literary manager at the Royal Court Theatre form 1969 to 1970 and then became resi­dent dramatist. In 1973 he was the resident dramatist at the Nottingham Playhouse. He has a diverse background in ·direct­ing. 
Hare directed Brassneck at ~he Nottingham Playhouse (\973), Teeth 'n' Smiles at the Royal Court (1975), Plenty at the National (1978), Licking Hitler for BBC (1978) and Dreams of Leaving (1979) for the BJISC. The playwright has won rr5l.ny prominent awards including that of Most Promis­ing Pla}'..,right for the Evening Standard for his play Slag. It is a rare opportunity in aca­demic the'atre for the play­wright to view his own work and then comment on it . 
Tickets for the three nights of the run are still available. For reservations, call 284-4176 as soon as possible. The nights remaining are tonight, tomor­row and Saturday. The play begins at 8:00 in O'Laughling Auditorium on the Saint Mary's campus.

receive them at the end of the 
month from the rectors. 
''The census is the largest peacetime activity of the federal government,'' Doran said. ''Many government grants to. Notre Dame are based on census statistics of student population such as supplemen­tary housing grants for dorm­itories and financial aid pro­grams,'' she explained. Finan­cia! aid programs are also related to the national average of the income of the students' families. 
Doran emphasized the need of accurate statistics for "effec­tive planning of community services" for the off-campus area. These include crucial services for the off-campus students such as police protec­tion and garbage disposal. Total community development funds for South Bend are based on the whole population of the South Bend metropolitan area, including the Notre Dame campus. 
There are many government programs that rely on the use of census data. Mental health centers such as the Logan Center and nutrition programs for the elderly are two exam­ples. Other such programs mcl1:1de ener~y, devt;lopment, antt-recesston assistance, unemployment insurance, and federal aid to highways. 
Private enterprise also uses census data extensively. Busi­nesses decide whether to open stores, and banks on the basis of these statistics. Church leaders use census data in their plans to build churches and provide religious services. 
The most important .Political use of census statistics ts in the apportionment of districts for 
U.S. Congressmen and state legislators which will be deci­ded by the end of 1981. District boundary lines depend on the total population of the area, includmg everyone on the Notre Dame campus and not on the number of registered voters. 
The census questionnaires will be mailed to off-campus students during the last week of this month. Doran urges students to mail these question­naires in before April 1 in order to participate.

It is reassuring to note that during NCAA-tournament time, Notre Dame students are think· ing about more than just basketball. The recent mora­torium placed upon hockey scholarsnips has awakened the slumbering consciousness of the N.D. student body, making them aware that ''Notre Dame is a lot more than football and basketball.'' 
There is a definite shortage of ~ood sporting events at N.D. Wtth only six home football games and about a dozen b-ball contests, what wiJl domers do to satisfy their healthy appetite for sports? T.V. will partially mi~igare the problem. Between trips to the stadium and the
'-· A.C.C., domers can take some solace in watching their heroes do their thing on television. 
Unfortunately, while N.D. is more than football and basket· ball, ir does nor seem to be much of anything else. Such worthy events as the Sopho· more Literary Festival, the Cultural Arts Film Series, and the Blues and Jazz Festivals have faced severe financial difficulties over the past several years. In fact, the Film Series and the Blues Festival have already been cancelled, with students offering little or no protest. 
Indeed, aside from sports, Notre Dame students don't get excited about much of any­thing. For example, studenr interest in the tenuring of professors has been virtually non-existent. Occasionally, several students might meet tn LaFortune to discuss the prob-

t 
lem, and some dedicated soul might take the time to write an edttorial column in The Observer, but that is the extent of student interest. In compar­ison with hockey, tenure 1s a minor league issue at Notre Dame. 
Hockey is even more impor­tant to N.D. students than their own social lives. Last year a survey showed that the vast majority of N.D. students favored a change in visitation rules. When the Administra­tion flatly refused to consider the parietals issue, however, students did not e¥en whimper in protest. 
Yet now -that the Administra­tion is tampering with the hockey program, students are feverishly aroused. The fact that hockey, which is at best a peripheral part of most Stu· dents' lives, concerns domers more than the right to interact normally with their friends of the opposite sex, is nothing short· of incredible. 
Even if hockey scholarships are discontinued, it will not make much of a difference in the lives of most N.D. students. It would mean that Notre Dame will no longer be able to compere for big-rime hockey honors, but so what? If the winnin~ of National Champion· ships ts the most important memory that most students will take with them from Notre Dame, something is seriously wrong with this school. In their obsession for saving hockey, while ignoring more imEortant issues, students are reinforcing the "jock" stereotype that N.D has tried to shed for so long.

The centrality ofdeveloj»nent 
Notre Dame is perhaps unique in holding a justice teach-in annually. Last month we held our third. Those who knew about it generally acknowledged its failure; the teach-in was igoored. Was this the result of a lack of interest, or of pressing schedules, or was it simply a reflection of confusion? What could a justice teach-in possibly mean? 
As I understand its purpose, all courses in all departments were to spend a day reflecting upon and dsicussing justice in the context of the materail of their courses. But all courses? Is that possible? My contemplation led--after following a circuitous path of detours, meander­ing.> leading often to dead-ends, and bold leaps over hiddendangers--to contemplate the mean­ing of ''development''. 
Development has, I must confess, always meant for me an economic strategy that would allow certain nations to escape the chronic poverty they have rome to know so intimately. In other words, I had always understood that development referred to others--to the nations of Africa, Asia or South America--but, never to ourselves. Never to the United States. Never to Western Europe. 
To understand that development does indeed apply to us as well, I had to go back to the original meaning of the ~ord: "Gradual unfold­ing; fuller working out ... " (Oxford). The metaphor is organic, so we might press the meaning a bit farther-and understand develop­ment to be a process of moving toward fruition; a growing, it would follow, that needs to be nurtured. We must develop the meaning of "development; indeed we wither away, our vitality drawn in the parched soil of consumer­ism. 
As we see that we too are in need of development, we must understand that is not separate from the strivings of the third and fourth worlds. The findings of the prestigious Brandt Commission on International Develop· ment Issues, after a two year study, have come to that very conclusion; "The world ... can become stronger by becoming a just and humane society. If it fails in th1s, it will move toward its own destruction.'' Our fates are bound together. The survival of all can only be achieved by the mutual development of all.

Just as we must see that development refer.; to 
the whole world, so too must we see that 
economic development it.-;elf is only one a.spect 
of another whole. If development 1.> to mean a 
''gradual working out'' of the potential that lies 
before humanity we msut expand uur conception 
to include politics and psychology, architecture 
and hi.;;tory, mu.-ic and philosophy, art and 
physics, poetry and ecology. How can these 
aspects be isolated (as in a university) without 
ripping them brutally from their place in the 
whole? 

To make this more concrete; The Iranian revolution was perhaps primarily a reaction against the western development policies of a the Shah. It was a revolution for Islamic culture. Even granting that the Shah's policies were intended in the best interests of the Iranian people (and that is too much), this revolution stands as a classic warning of the result of pursuing a development strategy without con­sent of the people and without consideration of the cultural dimension of a nation. 
The fields ofknowledge in all their breadth and depth might from an organic whole--each part delicately impinging on others. And I suggest that i.; is from the perspective of development that we best see these relationships: for in all these fields we seek development, we seek to unfold the inherent richness that lies in the possible. 
If we can understand the wholeness of the world and of mankind and know the centrality of development to this, we will have at the same time found the meaning of the word /,·ustice. 
Is this to be dismissed as a romantic onging for a paradise lost, for the healing of a shattered world? Or can one say that what ha.> dominated our understanding of what counts for know­ledge, as science, is limited? Can we .>ay t~at there is more to knowledge than the quanufi­able, than that which yields itself up to analysis? May we say that knowledge deals with the whole as well? The answer is urgent~y nec;ded. 
There is much to do, though, and so Jude ume. The barest beginning would be the conscious attempt to place our studies in their largest context--one of .>urvival and development--one of justice. If hope the justice teach-m was that beginning. It might have been.

P. 0. Box Q 
Abortion issue not always 'black and white' 
Dear Editor: 
I am simply appalled by the attitude underlying Madol?na Christensen's letter concernmg abortion. It appears that Ms. Christensen deems abortion a "Black and white" issue. She {ears that pro-lifer~, :will b.e 
·less than absolute m thelt ot?postition to abortion when fated with the victims of rape or incest. 
Ms. Christensen's let!er . manifests the belief that hfe ts black and white, that it is easily mapped-out, that we may self­righteously make a blanket decision covering all females who contemplate abortion, in­cluding the victims of rape or incest. 
In my opinion, it is indeed a grimly oppressive, rigid and unredeemed "Christianity" which will face the pregant victim of rape or incest and confidently proclaim, "We don't want to hear your opinion about abortion. It does not matter if your are twelve years of age--or twenty-five--or forty. It does not matter if/ou are mentally well-balance or on the verge of a nervous break­down from the hideously hu­miliating experience which you have had. The fact that you have a mind of your own does not interest us. We 'havens of gentleness,' (cf Ms. Chris­tensen's article on the draft), who have never been the vic­tims of rape or incest, have made your decision for you. You must have that child.'' 
It must be comforting, Ms. 
Christensen, to feel so securely 
correct that you may make such 
a decision for that victim; but 
the question is, "Does God 
agree with you?'' Mine 
doesn't.

Sexism at ND : 
An alternative view 
Dear Editor:­
This letter is in response to the many letters referring to sexism at Notre Dame, more specifically to the ''Perspec­uve" article in the February 
Scholastic. 
The main theme of the sexist 
attitudes is that the chauvinis­
tic male Domer is out for a "hot 
night'' whenever he goes out to 
the bars, or to a party. It has 
been said that, while out on 
such a night, the typical Domer 
will stand in a crowded bar 
scoping and rating the women, 
looking for one that is good­
looking, mindless, and hope­
fully easy to take home to bed. 
By the "evidence" presen­
ted, it would appear that the 
men at Notre Dame:;. possess a 
great rower. Men here can 
compe women to r~sk their very 
lives in order to gtve the guys 
what they like. I am referring 
to a statement made that a 
woman at Notre Dame dresses m a :skirt and high heels, then ventures out into the snow and ice, merely because "the guys like it." 
I personally find this very hard to believe; I am also doubtful that anyone at Notre Dame is insecure about his/her intelligence. I am evidently wrong; why else would women here "giggle and play dumb," if not to make some insecure male feel smarter. 
These two points are of a few rhat supposedly are ''evi­.:lence" supporting sexism at ~otre Dame. It seems funny to me that this "evidence" is based upon the actions of the women here, and not of the men. It w~ll undoubtedly be argued that these actions by the women are brought about by the totally sexist attitudes of the men. 
Both of these cases against the men can easily be reversed, but to do that would be point­'less. The point is that these problems must be placed in their proper perspective, that ?f indivtdual prejudices. You will find prejudices in all forms and in all places. I feel that one must evaluate one's own feel­ings and treat rising problems in the correct manner. One shouldn't be so quick to find faults in others, especially when it entails generalizing the actions of a large group. It might even be helpful to recall the psychological principle of projection, which consists of assuming that someone else has your own feelin~s. 
After considenng these points carefully, then, just mavbe one can be justified in criticizing another. But then again, maybe not.

LETTERS TO A LONELY GOD 
The Cabbage Patch Version

Moore leads SMC fencers, seeks greater interest 
by Deirdre Grant Sports Wnter 
Saint Mary's varstiy fencing! Many students on campus blankly stare back and ask the speaker to kindly repeat what has just been said. The speaker, who will gladly restate herself, is Sharon Moore, a native Texan and two year captain of the Belle fencing team. 
Moore came to Saint Mary's as most freshmen do, searching for her own spot in college life. Little did she know that one casual glance at a sign encoura­ging (begging??) anyone inte­rested in fencing to attend a meeting would set her on the way to a new, successful and personally satisfying endeavor. 
''Freshman year I knew I wanted to involve myself in something unique," said Moore. She attended the meeting and now finds herself three years later as the number­one varsity fencer at the Col­lege. 
Perhaps an important fact that hasn't been mentioned is that Moore had never heard about fencing before. Unfortu­nately, according to Sharon, this is still the case with many students at Saint Mary's. 
Fencing at Saint Mary's gained varsity status just four years ago. Moore quickly points out that Michael DeCic­co, Notre Dame head fencing coach, is the reason for the existence of a competitive 
team.  She  related  that it is  
difficult  for  Saint  Mary's  to  
finance  the  team  adequately,  

and "Coach (DeCicco) took it upon himself to see that there could be a team. 
''He knew we were capable of doing well, "said Moore. 
The Saint Mary's team prac­tices every day at Notre Dame, fences with the Irish team, and travels right alongside them to 
ND women return 

Nine ND alumnae will retun to campus this weekend to share their personal stories about careers, marriages, and life after graduation in the Library Auditorium, Satuday i from 1 to 3 p.m. 
The program is hewing spons­ored by the Women's Advisory Council. 
Chess Club 
sponsors: 
tournament 

The Notre Dame Chess Club is sponsoring a three round chess tournament tomorrow in LaFor­tune Ballroom. The tourna­ment is open to· students, professors, and members of the South Bend Chess Club. Regis­tration for the tournament is at 9 am in the Ballroom and the first round will begin at 9:30 am 
Prizes will be awarded to the wmners. 
meets. 
Once again, the man Sharon 
give complete credit to is 
DiCicco. More than once 
Moore has said "without him, 
there just wouldn't be Saint 
Mary's fencing." 
''Though the College finan­
ces us, Coach DiCicco under­
writes a lot of the expenses 
himself," ads the junior nur­
sing major. 
It was DiCicco that took 
Moore out to find blue warm­ups for the girls and his wife /that searched for robes needed 
during the meets. 
Greg Mueller is the assistant 
coach who works closest with 
the girls and Moore also loads 
praise in his direction. He is so 
beneficial to each team mem­
ber," said Moore. "Greg 
Mueller takes a real interest in 
each girl, giving encourage­
ment and valuable advice." 
For Moore, fencing is a very 
important part of her life. A 
season record of 28-10 verifies 
the fact that hard work and 
dedication were necessary. 
Fencins-is a very physical and 
strateg1c sport. Though it's 
individual in many aspects, it is 
the overall team effort that 
racks up points in the win /loss 
columns. 
Coach DiCicco is careful to let 
all the fencers know that when­
ever grades start dropping, so 
do the foils. Moore has never 
found a problem balancing her 
rigorous nursing schedule with 
fencing. 
"I find fencing relaxing. It 
takes many of the everyday 
academic strains and tensions 
away," explained Moore. · 
Her fencing career is some­
thing that Moore will always 
thank Saint Mary's for. It has 
been a "college experience I'll 
never forget.'' 
This week the fencers are 
preparing for Saturday's Great 
Lakes Championship. After 
that, Moore will travel with one 
other Saint Mary's fencer to 
Ohio State for the National 
Inter-Collegiate Women's Fen­
ting Association (NIWF A) tour­
nament. 
Tournament action is not new 
to'Moore. Last summer Saint 
Mary's -financed her trip 1to·the 
Nanonals in Colorade Springs, 
Colrlrado. She is hoping that 
the College will do so agatn this 
summer when the tournament 
will b11: held in New York. 
Saint Mary's is quietly ma­
king a name in the fencing 
arena. Each year the team's 
reputation grows and people 
are awakened to the fact that 
yes, therf is a varsity sport 
called fencing at Saint Mary's. 
According to Moore, next 
year's team may be the stron­
gest and most experienced ever 
fielded from Saint Mary's. 
Moore would like to see the 
sport receive more publicity. In 
the future, Saint Mary's hopes 
to host more fencing meets at 
the Angela Athletic Facility, 
which is a perfect design for the 
sport. Another Moore dream is 
that perhaps fencing could be 
offered in physical education 
classes, as it is at Notre Dame. 
In her own very dedicated 
way,SharonMoore 1s striving to 
develop student interst in the 
sport. She takes personal pride 
in the team, talks about it to 
anyone willing to lend an ear, 
and next semester will be out 
tacking signs up all over cam­
pus, hoptng that wandering 
eyes will just happen to grace a 
glance. After all, isn't that the 
way the story started?

Starkappeals AlAWruling 
Dennis Stark, coach of the Notre Dame swim team, has filed an appeal to an earlier decision by the AlA W concerning four of~is team members, Betsy Shadley, Jeanine Blatt, L~ Ann Bnslawn and Kathy Latino. The new ruling wi.ll be released Tuesday. All four women have qualified for the AIAW's Sma~l College Swimming and Divin& Championship. The first rulmg by that organization elimmated the Irish women because the four compete with the men's team when a women's team exists. Stark filed the appeal claiming that the women's team is actually only a club sport while the men's team is a varsity sport. Both Shadley and Blatt received All-American horrors at the Small College Champ­ionships last year. 
Gymnast conclude 1979-80 season 
The Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Gymnastics Team closed out its third season last weekend at the Purdue Golden Grips Classic. The Irish, defending champions of the Classtc, finished first in the women's division while the men finished behind host Purdue. The meet marked the end of the founders of the team, seniors Bob Meehan, Dan Howley, John Paulik and Bob Breyer. In the all-around competition Brian McLaughlin finished first for the Irish, with Dan Howley and Bob Meehan taking third and fourth respective­ly. In the women's all-around, Helen Cho took second, 
·Stephanie Micek third and Roberta DePiero fourth. 
Ali announces comebackbid 
NEW YORK (AP) -Now that Muhammed Ali is under contract to make a bid for his fourth heavyweight championship, the wheeling and dealing has begun in earnest. Ali's latest comeback calls for a late June tide fight against John Tate, but a site still needs to be found. Promoter Bob Hrum said "My attorney will leave for Taipei, China, Saturday and will report back to me." It has been known for some time that Tatwan was being considered as a site and Hrum admitted Thursday that if an Ali-Tate fight is held, it would be worth more money there than in the United States. Hrum also said he would go to Knoxville, Tenn., Monday night to meet with Ace Miller, manager of Tate, the World Boxing Association champion. Hrum also said he would talk to Don Manual, manager of Mike Weaver who will fight Tate in Knoxville March 31.

State last weekend. The Spar­
tans won the· first night, 5-4, in 
East Lansing while the Wolver­
ines took the second game of 
the home-and-home series, 6-1. 
This is the first time in three 
years that Michigan has quali­

made it to post-season play, it 
went as far ~ the national

Lerg and Bruno Baseotto follow 
with 74 points each. Defense­
men Tim Manning and John

record for points in a season by 
a defenseman with 49 while 
Blum posts 47, which also 
betters the previous mark of 46.
