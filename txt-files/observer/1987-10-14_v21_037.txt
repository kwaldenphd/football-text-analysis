In Brief , 
Chopsticks are now being exported to Japan. A Minnesota factory on Tuesday shipped its first truckloads of chopsticks to Japan. The plant will eventually produce 7 million pairs of chopsticks daily for sale in the Far East primarily to Japanese restaurants. High-speed wood dry~rs and a computerized cutting system designed by a Damsh manufacturer enable the plant to make chopsticks up to seven times faster than traditional Japanese plants. The production process ends with a computerized quality­control check that sifts out rejects with the use of fiber optics said. The Japanese discard 130 million pairs of dis­posable chopsticks daily. -Associated Press 
A 38-year old ban on travel to Communist China was relaxed by Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party to allow families separated since the Chinese civil war to reunite. The new policy will allow Taiwan's citizens, with the ex­ception of military personnel and civil servants, to visit people related to them "by blood or marriage" on the Chinese mainland. Taiwan, however, will not change its anti-communist policies and its determination to recover the mainland, the party said. -Associated Press

Mysterious Tarot predicts the future 


About all most people know of Tarot cards is that James Bond seduced Solitare with a rigged deck in "Live and Let Die." But there's far more to them than seduction. 
Predecessors to modern-day playing cards, Tarot decks have been used since the heyday of Ancient Egypt to predict love, fortune, and fame. They don't predict death, contrary to popular opinion. 
There are 78 cards in the deck. 22 of these are Major Trumps, depicting things like the Sun, the Moon, the Chariot, and the High Priestess. The remaining cards are split into four suits: Cups, Wands, Swords and Pentacles. Except for an extra Page, they are similar to the ace through king deck we are used to. 
And now to predict the future. Since there are several thousand of you out there, and no one really cares about my own future except me, I will predict the University's future. And so I shuffle the cards three times, cut the deck into three piles with my left hand in the Gypsy tradition, and begin ... 
The Hierophant (as the Significator): The Significator is a card chosen by the reader to represent the seeker. In this case, I chose the Hierophant, a religious authority figure, to rep­resent Notre Dame, which defines itself as a Catholic university and thus a teaching author­ity. 
Three of Swords, reversed (general atmo­sphere): A card in the reversed position gen­erally means an opposite meaning as the same card upright. The Three of Swords, a card of confusion or loss, is lessened in meaning when reversed. Perhaps this refers to the recent changeover of University presidents, lessened in impact by the competence of the new man in the job. 
Two of Wands (tools available): Creative ability, plans coming to fruition, courage. In this reading, the base upon which Notre Dame was built. 
Nine of Swords (foundations): Desolation, suspicion, doubt. The recent tragic deaths of members of the Notre Dame community come to mind. 
The Star, reversed (departing influences): Stubbornness, lack of perception. I would say the alcohol policy, but please remember I am not a professional reader. 
Four of Cups (possible future): Contempla­tion of self, reevaluation. Since this is positioned next to the reversed Star, perhaps the Univer­sity may reconsider its stand on a topic which previously had been set in stone. 
Queen of Wands, reversed (entering in­fluences): Virtuousness to a fault, domineering. This may be a specific woman or a general trend. 
~·~~~~~~,_..-1. 
Mark Me Laughlin 
Projects Manager 
King ofWands (fears): A good leader, strong in body and mind, but sometimes hasty. Per­haps University leaders are afraid of some fu­ture action they feel they might later regret. 
Six ofCups, reversed (influence of family and friends): Clinging to outworn manners and morals. Old friendships should be discarded. This could be interpreted as the view of the student body. Note that this is merely stating people's views, not making any claims as to whether they are correct views. 
Eight ofWands (hopes): Along journey nears completion, goals will be attained. The Univer­sity hopes to realize all of its potential as a center of Catholic learning. 
The Sun, reversed (the final outcome): First, the good news. The Sun is one of the best cards in the Tarot deck. It signifies achievement in the arts and sciences, success, and all-around happiness. The reversed position, however, nul­lifies all this, making it a card of frustrated potential. Its position near the Four of Cups might suggest that introspection and change might help to realize this potential. 
You can take Tarot as seriously as you want to, I guess. Most people laugh and scoff, but they all want their future read so sometimes I wonder. It does help one sort out one's mind, however. And that can only help the future.

Council members said they expect a large turnout at the 
lectures,  in  particular  the  
numerous  psychology  stu­ 
dents.  

Onkka said that some of the seven UCC staff psychiatrists often teach in the classroom setting. Their lectures, he said, provide students with a connec­tion to the center. "People feel more comfortable talking to a friendly face," he said. The UCC has both group therapy sessions and individual con­sultations. Six doctoral stu­dents and three interns, who are on the advanced level of doctoral training, assist the staff with the counseling. 
Bartlett said students can probably talk to the doctoral students and interns more easi­ly. 
Included in the UCC plans this year will be "an attempt to become more sensitive to providing more support to minority students," Bartlett said. 
Last spring UCC officials met with minority faculty members to ask their advice on how they could be more respon­sive to minority needs, he said.

Daley also asked the Council for their opinions on a "Pizza Hut Contest" in which, during a designated week, the dorm which ate the most pizza would receive a free pizza party for 25 people. The Council collec­tively agreed with the concept, but asked Daley if he would speak with Pizza Hut represen­tatives about increasing the size of the free party to be won.

President Arias wins Nobel peace prize 
Associated Press 

OSLO, Norway -President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica won the Nobel Peace Prize on Tues­day for a Central American peace plan that he fashioned and persuaded the region's other leaders to adopt. 
Selection of Arias was a surprise, and unusual because the choice was based at least partially on accomplishments after nominations closed Feb. 
1. There were 93 candidates, in­cluding 15 organizations. 
President Reagan, who has called the Arias plan "fatally flawed," said Tuesday: "President Arias fully deserves .the Peace Prize for having started the Central American region on the road to peace." 
The Norwegian parliament's Nobel Committee cited Arias, 46, as "the main architect" of the plan the five Central Amer­ican presidents signed Aug. 7 and now are putting into effect. 
Committee Chairman Egil Aarvik told reporters the award was meant to add im­petus and be "a support for the democratic process in the whole region." 
Asked whether the commit­tee was trying to influence the peace process, he replied: "It is our sincere wish that it will do so." 
Arias, reached on vacation at a Costa Rican beach resort, said the award was "incredible." 
"I accept it for Costa Rica, for peace, and not only for Costa Rica but for ·Central America, where 25 million human beings deserve to live in peace, with optimism, with some hope of progress," he said. 
"We must not forget that in this moment, in which the eyes of the world are fixed on Central America, that this little geographic part of the world has suffered," he added, call­ing for an end to the civil wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador. 
Aarvik said his five-member committee did not decide until late September who should get the Peace Prize, which like the other 1987 Nobel awards in­cludes a cash payment of $340,000. 
The Central American peace plan is intended to end guerrilla wars in Nicaragua, El Sal­vador and Guatemala. It re­quires cease-fires, amnesties and measures bringing greater democracy to be arranged by Nov. 7, when each nation is to report on its progress. 
A peace conmission is to verify compliance with the plan by Jan. 7, four months after it was signed in Guatemala City by the presi­dents of Costa Rica, El Sal­vador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. 
The Reagan administration supports both Contra rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua and the centrist government of El Salvador, where a civil war with leftist guerrillas began eight years ago. 



Lecture 
continued from page 1 

Galbraith noted a theme thoughout history of economic policies being adapted to suit the circumstances of the time. He stated what he considers to be the three great accommoda­tions of modern economists to the problems of capitalism: Marxian economics, the wel­fare economics, and the eco­nomic theories of John Maynard Keynes. 
"Marx's solution to the ills of capitalism was simply to abolish it," Galbraith said. 
He noted the the theories of the welfare economists in the Great Wel­fare Revolution headed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. They took public ac­tion to equalize the power be­tween employers and employees through such pro­grams as Social Security, Medicare, and public transpor­tation. "A floor was put on farm prices so that farmers wouldn't feel particularly sin­gled out as an exploited class," Galbraith added. 
"The Keynesian Revolution addressed the popular inter­pretation of Smith's idea that production will always supply its own demand," said Galbraith. He added that the government began to take re­sponsibility for problems that 
are inherent in the free market. 
While governmental legisla­tion solves the problems that naturally arise in a capitalistic economy, they have become "self-liquidating," according to Galbraith. They have been greatly weakened by their own success because people be­come more comfortable with their situations and less open to the very type of change that helped them. 
"There arises a mass denial of social problems when people get comfortable, and the poor are often forgotten. The poor become more politically powerless than before the legis­lation," said Galbraith. 
Galbraith concluded his speech by saying, "Capitalism's harsh edges have been taken away by social legislation. We must address the problems, always recogniz­ing the danger of bureaucratic excesses."

Deaths, lootings mark funeral 
Associated Press 
BOGOTA, Colombia -Rioters in the funeral procession for slain leftist leader Jaime Pardo Leal looted stores, and at least one person was killed Tuesday as unions called a general strike to protest the assassina­tion. 
The death brought to 11 the number of people killed since Pardo Leal, president of the Patriotic Union, was shot to death Sunday night by gunmen who stopped his car on a rural road. 
Some airline flights were cancelled because of the vio­lence across the country. 
At least 460 members of left­wing parties have been killed in the past two years, and rela­tives of some of the victims have blamed paramilitary death squads. 
An estimated 20,000 people joined in the funeral procession from the Colombian Congress building to a cemetery two miles away on ElDorado Ave­nue. 
Dozens of looters, running ahead of the procession, smashed store windows and carried away clothing, electri­cal appliances and other arti­cles. 
Some broke into the Bank of Bogota and fled with several typewriters and pieces of office equipment. About three dozen arrests were reported. 
Three members of President Virgilio Barco's Cabinet tried to join the procession and were driven away by rocks thrown by people accompanying the coffin. Forced away were Jus­tice Minister Enrique Low, Minister of Government Cesar Gaviria and Foreign Minister Julio Londono. 
Barco released a statement Monday saying the killers of Pardo Leal, 47, were enemies of peace and democracy. 
Army troops were called out to patrol cities and towns. A 13-year-old boy was shot and killed in the central Colom­

bian town of Barrancabermeja and his father was wounded when soldiers tried to break through a roadblock of burning tires, the National Police said in a communique. 
In Bogota, rioters blocked streets with barrels and bur­ning tires, the office of Mayor Juio Sanchez said in a state­ment.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti ­Police shot and killed on Tues­day a presidential candidate who was demanding in a speech near police headquarters that an alleged political prisoner be released, witnesses said. 
Plainclothes police walked out of the station, approached Yves Volel of the Christian Democratic Rally, beat him and then shot him, a reporter from TeleHaiti said. 
In a communique from police headquarters, police did not address allegations that they killed Volel. They said he had been armed and that they were looking for "his accomplices." 
Police cleared the area of bystanders and reporters, and confiscated the film, cameras and equipment of photog­raphers, witnesses said.

Words of wisdom from desk-top philosophers 
J am totally naked. 
I was sitting in the library Sunday night reading Plato's "Phaedo" when I saw those words scratched on the wood of the desk I was sitting at. It had been a hard week. I was tired, bored and generally ready for a break. Usually I enjoy Plato, but that night he just wasn't making it. Depres­sion was setting in. That's when I saw it: "I am totaiJ.y naked." 
KrlsMurphy 
Altered 
What a revelation! Someone had once sat in the same desk that I was sitting at. probably just as bored and tired as I. Then they'd had a vision--a vision of nakedness. Sure It was weird, sure it was probably perverted, and It was definitely out of place on a desk In the library; but it was a vision nonetheless! It extended beyond the drab confines of the Memorial Llb-ooops!--the Theodore Hesburgh Library, and it showed that whoever wrote it had been dreaming of a better state of being. I felt better already, and I decided to seek out more transcendental graffiti. 
In the carrel next to mine someone had written, "Kill all Notre Dame women in '88," and below that someone else replied, "Notre Dame boys are geeks with big egos." 
Hmmmmmm. That made me think. I had never wanted to kill a Notre Dame girl. I knew a guy who punched a Notre Dame girl in the teeth while they were dancing together once. (He said it was a mis­take, but I knew better.) I'd never even gotten that close. I'll be the first to admit that I've thought about slapping one or two, but I decided that killing them was just wrong. The vibes were just way too intense y'know? Another thing. why kill all Notre Dame women in '88? Why not '87 or '86? Think about it. 
As far as "Notre Dame boys are geeks with big egos," I only agreed halfway. We all have big egos, but the geek quotient is relatively low. It's limited to everyone wearing Spuds McKenzie shirts, hats, buttons and sweatshirts. 
Calvin and Hobbes 
I moved to the tenth floor. There I found that Mary Lou Retton is: (1) Fat. (2) Ugly, (3) An unprintable aqjective describing Miss Retton's al­leged promiscuous nature. 
That made me angry. Here this girl trains for years and sacrifices a normal chilhood so that she can become a ~reat gymnast and make her country proud of her in the Olympics, and then some guy at Notre Dame puts her moral character in question. I'll admit that Mary 
Lou looks crummy in tights. I'll 
also admit that she isn't the 
best-looking gymnast this col­
umnist has ever seen. It's 
going way too far to bring her 
dating habits into the question, 
though. 
I was steamed. I wanted to 
write to her and say, "Mary 
Lou, honey, I think you're okay 
and I'll fight any creep who 
says different." I didn't do it. 
though. I decided she just 
wasn't worth the trouble. In­
stead, I kept reading. 
A group of philosophical graffiti caught my eye. "Jesus is coming soon, are you ready?" was written at the very top of a carrel. Right below someone had replied with "Yes I'm baking pies." Nearby some­one had asked a question that I haven't been able to stop thinking about since I saw it: "Why do people drive on parkways and park on driveways?" I was still reeling from that when I read "Give a man a fish and he eats for a day. Teach him to fish and you can sell him a pole." 
So this was what my class­mates were really thinking! And here I'd thought that everyone was studying. It made this PLS major feel good to know that people around here are inter­ested in the big questions in­stead ofjust wanting to get rich. 
A final quote in the philosophical section seemed to me to be a kind of con­densed Notre Dame Manifesto. In green highlighter someone had written, "I love to drink," and directly below that In blue ink was "I drink to love." Notre Dame never seemed so simple to me as at that one shining moment. 


Back on the tenth floor I 
found something Incredible. 
The Jane Jetson Shrine. It was 
a huge picture of Jane Jetson, 
outlined on a carrel In blue Ink. 
The hair was stunningly ren­
dered in bright yellow magic 
marker and the eyes were 
holes gouged In the wood. It 
looked just like her! All around 
It people had written loving 
messages to Jane: "Jane, stop 
this crazy thing!", "Jane is ideal 
beauty!", "Jane Is chaste" and, 
of course, "Janel Have my 
child!" 
I was touched. I'd always loved Jane from afar, but it felt good to know that others felt the same as I. Go visit Jane's shrine on the tenth floor. You'll be glad you did. 
On the fifth floor I found some of my classmates stand­Ing up for their political Ideals. Someone had written "Notre Dame Fascist Republican Pigs 

GIRLS 1\-\\NI<. 'SM~ 1\l-\1) 1\Rt._ PR\:OCC\lPIED 'N\\1-\ PEm' \JE\1\\LS. 13UT BOYS \\4\~K 8/6.' 8)(S 1\-\1\\\K 1\B.JVT 1\C:'i\OI'\ AAI:l 1\S:CO~I'l\S\\t-\00' ~0 ~lli:Q ITS MEN W\.10

Bill Watterson 

Die!" This was followed by "Burn in hell liberal sheeplover." Also on the fifth floor was "Gerry Faust Football Coach--Fact or Fiction?", along with "Blow off Thursdays!" and "Reason Is a conceptual excuse postulated by those without 
faith." 

My favorite though was "It's not college that makes you successfuL It's the Individual you are" followed by: "( 1) It's who you know, (2) It's the God you serve, (3) It's the guy you love! (4) It's the music you play, (5) It's the cologne you 
wear!" I tend to side with the 
cologne guy, even though I 
don't own any. 
I found my final comment on Notre Dame graffiti on the eleventh floor. Written In red ink on a desk was "Are you the type of person who doesn't 
study and ends up getting bad grades? Then stop reading this stupid note and study!" Right below that was written, "Beware: the Clam People Are Comlngll!!" Free expression is a wonderful thing.

I.R.S. and R.E.M. "We were Inter­ested in being on a smaller label," Buck said. "We were afraid that on a major label, we'd be pushed Into doing things not natural to us. 
"It was the record company who thought of doing Dead Let­ter Office. I like things like that. Some of that stuff (on the album) is entertaining for Its looseness and casualness. I like for people to see our whimsical and fun side. I'd forgotten how good some of those songs were. Most were B-sldes. Some were English I 2-inches, very obscure, where (only) .3,000 were pressed." 
About the new LP Document. Buck says, "I hate to say It's a thematic record. That's so pretentious. The idea was to take a look at the world as we see it. Musically it needed to be linked to an idea of the chaotic time we live ln. 
"You push and pull songs Into some kind of shape and order. We've thrown songs away where we can't agree on key or tempo. We figure It's easy enough to write songs that we can just write another one. Every record has one song that each of the band members Isn't really wild about, 
but we never do anything some­
one hates. 
"We do videos that aren't 
singles and singles that aren't 
videos. Nobody else does this. 
We work by intuition. On songs 
we figure we've got a good Idea 
for a video, we make one. I don't 
see that rock 'n' roll has to be a 
slave to what Is the single." 
R.E.M. stands for rapid eye movement. "It shouldn't be taken literally," Buck said. "Itwas just the first thing we could think 
of that we liked." 
The members of R.E.M., 
vocalist Michael Stipe, bassist 
Mike Mills, drummer Bill Berry 
and Buck, met before they 
dropped out ofcollege In Athens, 
Georgia. They all stili live there. 
"You're less tense about star­dom In Georgia," Buck says. "Very few people are excited when they see me on the streets of Athens. I've lived there 10 years. It's easy to go home. I have the same friends." 
R.E.M. never tried out any other members. "Michael and I were friends," said Buck. "Bill and Mike were friends. We met and It seemed like a good idea to form a band. It seemed 
everybody else was doing it. "We always had the Idea of being good but not being

serious about a career. We just got successful. I do this be­cause It Is enjoyable. You make a lot of money, but If It stopped being fun It would be far too much work." 
Mills says this about the group, "I think what we are Is good songwriters with a great on-stage chemistry. There are some dire things going on In the world, so there are some dire things to be said In songs. There Is hope and optimism and a lot of humorous Irony In a lot of Michael's lyrics. We're optimistic. We are hopeful despite the times." 
"We take chances," Mills 
says. "On stage, we change the set list every night. At any point In the set we'll throw the set list out and play things we feel like playing. Recording. we're liable to throw any kind of Instrument on there." 
It's always possible that 
R.E.M. could have a hit single, but Mills says, "There's no point In anticipating after all this time. I thought 'Follow Me' from the last album should have been a hit." Asked what he'd do If R.E.M. got a hit single, Mills replied, "Faint." 
Associated Press 
Members of the Georgia-based rock group R.E.M. are cheerful and up-front about not being su­perstars, here or abroad. The quartet's guitarist Peter Buck says, "I don't know If I could han­dle big fame. I can't Imagine what It would be like to be Prince or Bruce Springsteen or some­body. Now It's at a nice, steady 
rate." 
R.E.M. Isn't doing badly. The group has made an album a year for I. R. 5. Records starting In 1982, plus Dead Letter Office, a collection of B-sldes of singles that was number 188 on October 3, Its 21st week on the best­selling charts. A new LP, Docu­ment. was number 16 on that date and Is still climbing In Its second week on the charts. The 
first single from Document Is "The One I Love." Charted Oct. .3 at number 70 and climbing. It 
Is the best any R.E.M. single has done to date. 
"Everybody lies and says we're huge In Europe. We're well­respected In Europe. We don't 
sell a huge amount of records. We don't have hits," Buck says. "We play to 2,000 or .3,000 In France and 6, 000 In London. We're respected. We won a Grammy In Norway for 'Album of the Year' for Life's Rich Pageant 
in 1986." 
The fact that R.E.M. records for 
I.R.S. causes some funny looks 
when the group enters a foreign country. "If I've had a few drinks, been on a plane eight hours, and my hair Is sticking up in the air, they go, 'This guy works for the American government?"' Buck

Air Force . .  
Associated Press 
DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -In a remote part of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, civil engineer­ing crews are building a new runway with a twist --this one has bomb craters already built in. 
The $80,000 project Is to be completed by this fall. It Is one of three bases around the country using mock runways designed to teach engineers how to repair bomb craters quickly in case of war. Sim­ulated bombed runways also are being built at Holloman Air Force Base In New Mexico and Tyndall Air Force Base In Florida, according to Lt. Thomas A. Winterhalter of the 2750th Civil Engineering Squadron at Wright-Patterson. 
"They're testing it out at these three bases, and if It's deemed successful, It wlii be Installed at every Air Force base," he said. 
The runway will be a stub strip of asphalt about 700 feet long. Into It will be built two craters, one round and one square, for teaching different reconstruction methods. 
Winterhalter said the round crater, which is 45 feet across and I 0 feet deep, represents the damage a 750-pound bomb would cause. Engineers would fill It with rubble, dirt and stone, level It off and lay a fiberglass mat on top to keep stones from being kicked up Into a plane's engine and to give the plane something more solid to run across, Winterhal­ter said. 
"We're talking about being able to put a seriously­damaged runway back In three to four hours," said Lt. Col. Philip M. Brooks, operations officer of the 200th Civil Engi­neering squadron of the Air National Guard at Camp Perry 
near Port Clinton. The 20oth Is helping to build the mock run­way. 
The VIetnam-era repair method was similar, but used a much heavier aluminum mat. Winterhalter said. Because planes bounce when they hit such heavy mats, they weren't effective much closer than .300 yards apart. but use fiberglass has shortened that distance considerably, Brooks said. 
The purpose of the square crater is to give crews practice in laying concrete slabs, six­feet square and about .3,000 pounds each, Winterhalter said. When laid on top of backfill, 16 of those wlii fill the 26-foot­square crater. Such slabs are used for more permanent re­pairs at established bases. "Those (slabs) are usually used as parking lots. You just pick them up and move them over to the runway," he said. 
A third area gives crews ex­perience In repairing small holes with quick-setting con­crete. 
In one respect, the mock craters aren't realistic because they are lined with concrete to let them take the repeated beating of being filled and emptied of stones. 
"Before we go out and train, we'd probably spread some rubble around there to make It look more realistic," Winterhal­ter said. 
The training will not be lim­Ited to just heavy-equipment operators or specialists in run­way repair. Base plumbers, electricians, anyone assigned to civil engineering will get a crack at helping with repairs. 
Winterhalter's squad Is part · of the Prime BEEF (Base Engi­neering Emergency Force) sys­tem designed to be deployed overseas soon after hostilities break out to maintain vital air­fields.

I ~ McGlinn gets hat trick;
' 
Irish shutout Goshen 
By KATIE CRONIN Sports Writer 
Annie McGlinn's hat trick led the Irish field hockey team's destruction of Goshen 5-0 Tues­day. 
Coming off their worst game of the season against Central Michigan, the Irish enjoyed a thorough victory over Goshen. Playing more aggressively, Notre Dame dominated the game, taking 35 shots on the opposition's goal and getting 10 penalty corners. 
"We were the more talented team," said Coach Jill Linden­feld. "But I was pleased that we were making the most of every scoring opportunity. All thirty-five were good shots on goal. We made their goalie play the ball." 
At the beginning of tht: game, play hovered at midfield. Gos­hen's early and only offensive threat of the game earned th~m a penalty corner down in the Irish circle, but it was the beginning of the end as Caroline Berezny knocked the ball out of the circle before Gos­hen could even take a shot on goal. 
Notre Dame pressured Gos­hen for the rest of the game. It sent a Goshen free hit from the top of the circle right back in, setting up the first of McGlinn's goals with an assist from right inner Mary Wagner at 11:14 in the first half. There was no let­ting up as McGlinn scored an unassisted goal at 14:16, and a few minutes later Debbie Char­lesworth put the ball in the cage with an assist from Wagner for the third Irish goal. 
The second half was more of the same. McGlinn completed her hat trick at 2:30 scoring on an assist from Mindy Breen. On the next penalty corner taken, the Irish put the ball in the cage again, only to have the goal called back because the ball wasn't stopped dead off the cor­ner before the hit was taken. Another goal scored by Breen was also called back. Benet DeBerry scored the fifth and last Irish goal at 15: 46. 
"We played with an attitude to win. We worked on that this past week -that and shooting on goal," said Lindenfeld. Pleased with the team's perfor-
Flutie goes to Patriots 
Associated Press 

BOSTON -The New England Patriots acquired quarterback Doug Flutie, who won the Heis­man Trophy while playing at Boston College, from the Chicago Bears Tuesday for an undisclosed draft choice. 
Flutie is expected to play for the Patriots in Sunday's NFL game against the Oilers in Houston, New England spokes­man Jim Greenidge said. 
"We're trying to do every­
thing we can to w_!n_ !uW.mrtn"'t 
circu~J.:mrct!s;'' · Patriots 
-coach Raymond Berry said. 
"We need to improve our quar­
terback play." 

He added that the Patriots, who have three quarterbacks on their active roster, will keep four after the NFL players' strike ends. 
mance, Lindenfeld cited DeBerry and Charlesworth for excellent play. 
"Senior Annie McGlinn played the best game she's ever played. She did well in every aspect of the game: defensively blocking shots, tackling back, anticipating where play was going and of­fensively passing, shooting, scoring, and playing to her op­ponents' weaknesses," said Lindenfeld. 
"It was the result of a lot of frustration and teamwork com­ing together," said McGlinn. "We had such a poor game last week and Jill had hard prac­tices this week, but the im­provement of specific skills showed in everyone's play today. We were passing well onto each others' sticks. I got great passes from Benet." 
"It'll be nice going to D.C. with the momentum of a win behind us; hopefully we'll play this strong against the East Coast teams," said McGlinn. 
The Irish leave Friday for a fall break trip to Washington 
D.C. They'll. play American University on Saturday, Cath­olic on Sunday, Georgetown on Monday, and University of Maryland-Baltimore County on Wednesday. All are Division I except for Catholic which is Division III. 
"The East Coast has strong hockey. Every game will be competitive, but we are going on an upbeat note. They have the feeling of what it takes to score goals -you have to make the most of good and lousy op­portunities," said Lindenfeld. 
"I anticipate we can keep playing with this enthusiasm and vigor. That's what it takes to win," Lindenfeld said looking at the rest of the season. 
The Irish return home at the end of break for their last home game, facing off against Calvin October 24 before the USC game.

Irish runners lose to B.G. 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Sports Writer 
It's not often that a coach goes into a meet without at least hoping for a victory, but that's exactly what women's cross country coach Dan Ryan did Saturday at Ball State. 
Ryan chose to rest his top five for the upcoming Indiana Intercollegiates and give his younger runners a chance to perform in the only dual meet of the season for the harriers. The result was a 15-48 loss to the Cardinals, who finished fourth in last week's Notre Dame Invitational. 
For Ryan, though, the meet } .. was a success. The perfor­mances of the younger runners pleased him and gave him an optimistic outlook for the fu­ture. 
"I anticipated the result, and I liked what I saw," he said. "It's good to see them making the transition because some­times it's hard to go from high school to college. It was good experience for them to run against a top-flight team. Ball State didn't rest anybody, and we were right with them." 
Ryan said the rest was vital for his top five runners, who were coming off the National Catholic Championships and the Notre Dame Invitational.

Conigliaro, the youngest player ever to hit 100 career home runs at the age of 22, was cut down by a beanball to the face in 1968 while playing for the Red Sox and was never the same. Too many hit-by-pitches and brawls occurred this sum­mer, and the beanball is endan­gering the lives of batters. 
And no list of baseball ac­colades would be complete without a mention of Reggie Jackson, who retired last week with 563 home runs. Only four men have ever hit more, but maybe no one has ever hit as many dramatic taters as Reggie. His three home runs in three swings in the 1977 World Series nears immortality, and he will forever be remembered as Mr. October when the Fall Classic rolls around.

Hoobers set sights on interhall title 

A Pangborn defender attempts to block an op­ponent's punt. Men's lnterhall action continues 
Dillon overcomes adversity 
By TIM SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
Facing adversity and then overcoming it. 
That could be the sign of a good man or a good problem­solver, but in the case of Dillon Hall, it is a sign of a good foot­ball team. 
The undefeated Big Red en­tered Sunday's men's interhall football game against Grace facing many difficulties. When the dust had settled Dillon had claimed the regular season championship with a 10-0 vic­tory. 
Dillon's defense (which has allowed only eight points in four games) and offense were severely damaged by injuries, and it was faced with a solid, upset-minded Grace team. An added problem was Dillon's own self -destructive nature: the Big Red was penalized for over 100 yards on the day. 
"I was happy with the vic­tory," said Dillon coach Jeff Morgan, "because we did have so many injuries. A lot of our younger guys came through." 
Mike Brammer at quarter­back and Murphy at fullback were the key weapons for the Big Red offense. Brammer kicked a field goal and scored Dillon's lone touchdown on a two-yard sneak. Murphy's solid running set up Bram­mer's TD and also kept the ball out of Grace's hands for much of the game. 
Dillon senior Bill Cellebrezze is on an extended pass-catching streak -the wide-receiver has now caught a pass in fifteen consecutive games, dating back to his freshman year. Morgan knows that his team is good, but he is not overconfi­dent. 
"With all of the injuries we have, I'll reserve judgement. But if our injured people come back, then I'm very confident.'' 
Dillon's defense benefitted largely from the play of two de­fensive linemen, freshman Tim Murphy and sophomore Scott Henson. Their strong tackling and pass rushing forced Grace into an ineffective passing game. 
The second playoff spot from the Parseghian Division is still up for grabs. No team has been eliminated from contention, but Morrissey seems to have the inside track. While Flanner can virtually clinch a spot with a victory, they have to play the undefeated Big Red -not an easy task. Should Flanner lose, Morrissey would make the playoffs with a victory over Grace. 
Flanner tied Off-Campus on Sunday, 6-6. The Crime's RJ Haggerty's third quarter touchdown reception set the final score. Off-Campus had more than 150 yards in total of­fense, but miscues cost th~m points. Particularly effective was the Reynolds-Haggerty connection, which the Flan­nerites had a tough time stop­ping. 
"We played an excellent game," said Reynolds. "We must have had the ball inside their 30-yard line four times, and we only scored once."

Holtz discusses QB picture 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
With the announcement that Terry Andrysiak would miss the remainder of the season with a broken collarbone, the quarterback replacement derby began in earnest. It's a three-horse race, but Tony Rice appears to have the inside track 
The sophomore, who sat out last season under the provi­sions of Proposition 48, di­rected the Irish to all their scores in the second half of their 30-22loss to Pitt Saturday. 
"Tony did a very admirable job coming into the football game and playing the second half," Irish head coach Lou Holtz said at his weekly press conference Tuesday. "He put 22 points on the board against a very good Pitt defensive team. One or two times he for­got who he pitched the ball to and what was maybe a four-or five-yard gain could have been more. 
"But he did not turn the foot­ball over. He almost threw an interception because he mis­read the coverage. It was easier (to read coverages) against Pitt because they play mostly man coverage. It will be different because our next five opponents play mostly zone coverage." 
Holtz, however, did not ex­plicitly give the starting nod to Rice, although he did say he would get a lot work with the first team, and pointed out that freshman Kent Graham and junior Pete Graham (no rela­tion) may also have a shot. 
"You may see Pete Graham," Holtz said. "He's a junior but has played very, very sparingly. He's got a good head on his shoulders and makes good decisions and un­derstands the offense -check­offs, coverages, etc. Conse­quently that's why Peter Graham may be the quarter­back. 
"Kent Graham is 6-5 so he can see (the field). I hope he has a good understanding of pass coverages, but I really don't know. He's still a young­ster." 
Although Holtz has three players gunning for the top slot, he said he didn't want to have a quarterback controversy -a situation common to Notre Dame in recent years. 
"The one thing we're not going to have on this football team is we're not going to have a quarterback controversy," Holtz said. "We're not going to have our players, our fans or anybody else decide who should be the quarterback and pulling for one guy or the other. That's always the case when you have a situation where you've got a couple of freshman and some of them are very talented and can do certain things, but they're still fresh­men. That decision is someth­ing that will have to be reached by the coaching staff, and everybody, including the players, is going to have to ac­cept that." 
By ROB PIERCE Sports Writer 
The Off-Campus Hoobers took a major step toward defending their men's interhall soccer crown Sunday when they edged Morrissey A, 1-0 in overtime. Both teams came into the game with perfect 4-0 records, but in the end it was the manpower of the Hoobers outlasting a Morrissey squad missing several key players. 
"We had only twelve men be­cause a few went to watch the football game," said Morrissey coach Pat Brisbane. "But the rest of the team really gave a good effort and almost pulled it out." 
Neither team could manage a goal in regulation as Pat Marschall of the Hoobers and Joe Nelson of Morrissey were flawless in goal. But with only 
seconds left in the five-minute extra period, Morrissey was whistled for a push in the penalty box, and Hoober Mike Johnson booted home the penalty kick for the victory. 
"It was really a controver­sial call by the referee," said Brisbane, "because he changed his call from indirect to direct. But we can still make the playoffs and maybe meet the Hoobers again." 
"We look pretty strong," said Hoober captain Dave Thompson, "having outscored the opposition 19-0 on the year. We have five players back from last year's team and should do well in the playoffs." 
In other weekend action, Grace A remained alive in the playoff hunt with a 4-0 shutout of Dillon Big Red. Grace is now 3-1 on the season, while Dillon dropped to 2-4. The Law School

It's been a season of streaks, corks and scuffed balls. 
The 1987 major league baseball season provided baseball fans with a gamut of emotions, results and performances that have proven once again that this game of baseball is indeed our national pastime. With the Fall Classic soon upon us, let's take a look back at the good, the bad, the ugly and the downright ridiculous. 
Let's start at the beginning. The Sports Illustrated Jinx award goes to the hapless Cleveland Indians, who were picked by that esteemed publication to run away with the American League East title, and then some. The Tribe finished with a record of 61-101, the worst in baseball, and were 37 games behind Detroit, the division champs. 

Brian O'Gara 
Irish Items 

But let's give credit where it is due. SI made up for its poor prognosticating with the July 7 'One Day in Baseball' issue, a look at the institutions and idiosyncrasies of the game -such as Fenway Park's Green Monster, Wrigley Field's apartment-top view beyond the left and right field bleachers and the amazing mind of Whitey Herzog. Thank you, Sports Illustrated, for a fantastic tribute to baseball. 
The Abracadabra award goes to Joe Niekro of the Atlanta Braves, for his attempt to make an emory board, used to scuff the baseball, disappear. The umpires and on-the-ball TV cameramen nabbed the would-be magician. 
Chicago Cubs' slugger Andre Dawson is the recipient of the I'm Playing For Peanuts award. Dawson drew a salary of only $650,000 and responded by leading the majors in home runs (49) and runs batted in (137). He may just be theNational League MVP despite the Cubbies' second-half nosedive. Dawson's value, compared to his peers, is mil­lions, although nobody should be paid a million dollars to play the game of baseball for nine months. 
A scholarship to the Bill Buckner School of Fielding goes to Toronto's Manny Lee, who replaced injured shortstop Tony Fernandez in the final week of the season. Alan Trammell's ground ball in the bottom of the 12th inning scooted through Lee's legs, a-la-Billy-Buck, allowing the winning run to cross the plate for Detroit on the next-to-last day. of the season and set the stage for the Tigers' division title clincher the next day. 
The Say Hey Kid award goes to Cincinnati's Eric Davis, who drew comparisons to the game's best all-around player ever, Willie Mays, by hitting home runs, stealing bases and proving that no batted ball, especially a Jack Clark home run shot, is a sure hit with his dazzling fielding. 
Did somebody say strike? Kansas City outfielder (or is it the LA Raiders running back?) Bo Jackson, who struck out an average of 1.4 times per game (160-plus for the season), now joins the picketing Raiders for his hobby. 
The I'll Take It Again award goes to Boston's Rocket Roger Clemens, who rallied back from a 4-6 start to lead
