Expression of Thanks 
Dear Notre Dame Family, 
There has always been much said about the closeness and compasssion flowing from the Notre Dame community. In our three years here, we have felt the unity of this special place many times. At no time, however, has this feeling ever been greater than at the passing of our roommate and close friend, Michael Cogswell. 
Mike was an incredibly special person, as those of us who were close to him already know. Mike had a unique ability to relate to most anyone. Underneath his fun-loving, outgoing side was a special sensitivity that touched us all. Each of us who knew Mike will always remember our treasured moments with him: tailgaters, trips, late-night conversations. Upon his death we all fully realized just how much his presence meant to us. 
Obviously his loss is hard to bear. It has been greatly eased, however, by the outpouring of sympathy we have received from the friends around us. This compassion was not only felt by his roommates and close friends but also, most importantly, by his family. We cannot begin to describe how much your care relieved their suffering. To know that their child was so loved and cherished by so many helped Mike's parents immensely. It also helped all who were his friends. To all those who showed their consideration and support, we thank you. Your help has truly shown us just how special a place Notre Dame is. 
With great appreciation, 

Mike's roommates: 
Rob Lewis Chuck Butler Paul Conaty Martin Monaco Chris Campili Mark Dillon Tom Dugard Sonny Nunes Tom Hynes Justin Foley

Furmark tens version of Casey's role 


client of Casey's, refused to talk to reporters as he entered the closed Senate hearing. But Casey said it was Furmark who first raised questions in his mind about transfers of funds from then-secret arms sales to Iran. 
While Furmark testified, Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, emerged to report that "he is being as candid as he can, he is answering all our ques­tions." Another source said Furmark apparently was an in­termediary between Casey and Middle East arms dealers. 
Con~essional sources, speakmg on condition of anonymity, said the Senate In­telligence Committee had learned before Wednesday of Casey's conversation with Fur­mark, leading at least some panel members to question the CIA director's claim of Wed­nesday that he was unaware of the diversion of funds. 
Casey denied a report in The Wall Street Journal that he knew as early as last spring that profits from the Iranian arms sales were being funneled to Nicaraguan insurgents, or Contras. 
"No, that's wrong," Casey told reporters who pursued him down a corridor in the Capitol after his appearance before the House committee. 
Asked when he learned about the arrangement, Casey responded, "I first learned about this when Meese told everybody." It was on Nov. 25 that Attorney General Edwin

Meese disclosed that between 
$10 million and $30 million in 
arms sales profits were 
diverted to the Contras. 
"Before Meese informed 
you, did you start asking ques­
tions?" Casey was asked. 
"Oh, I had questions about it, 
yeah," he replied. 
"When you had questions, was that because of your con­versations with Mr. Fur­mark?" 
"That did precipitate the questions, sure." 
Government sources, who spoke only on condition that they remain anonymous, said Casey told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednes­day that Furmark had telep­honed him Oct. 7 with word that unidentified Canadian busines­smen who had put up the money for the Iranian arms were complaining that they had not been repaid adequate­ly. 
The Canadians were threat­ening a lawsuit because they had received only $10 million when they had expected pay­ment of $20 million, the sources quoted Casey as saring. 
One House Fore1gn Affairs Committee member, who spoke only on condition that he not be identified, said that sometime after Casey's con­versation with Furmark, the CIA director summoned Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, a member of the National Secur­ity Council staff who was coor­dinating the administration's efforts to aid the Contras.

WASHINGTON -CIA direc­tor William Casey said Thursday he did not learn of possible diversions of Iranian arms sales profits to Nicaraguan rebels until he was tipped by a New York busines­sman in early October. 
Casey spoke to reporters after he testified for more than three hours before a heavily guarded, closed-door session of the House Intelligence Com­mittee. A few minutes later, Casey's purported tipster, Roy Furmark, went before the Sen­ate Intelligence Committee to tell his version of the story.

December 12, 1986 We, the residents of Howard Hall, would like to express our extreme displeasure with the admin.istra­tion's handling of the decision to convert our home to a women's dor­mitory in the fall of 1987. While we recognize the need to increase the enrollment of women at Notre Dame, we feel there is no excuse for the lack of sufficient time given to the residents of our hall to react to the administration's intentions. At the very least, it is inconsistent to imple­ment a long-term plan on such short notice. As members of the Notre Dame and Howard family, we feel that we have been mistreated and abandoned. The administration should not be al­lowed to take such drastic action -without even consulting the people involved. We hope that the troubles and disturbances that we are suffer­ing will serve to remind the admin­i~tration and the student body of the need for open and continual com­munication. Respectfully, The Residents of Howard Hall Paid Advertisement

3rd distrct vote tallying continues 
Associated Press 

SOUTH Bend, Ind. -State auditors tallied more absentee ballots and checked recorded vote totals a~ainst impoundedvoting machmes Thursday in the continuing recount of the 3rd District congressional race. 
Hubert Hoffman, a State Board of Accounts field super­visor, said 30 more St. Joseph precincts had been tallied by mid-afternoon. 
In Elkhart County, a com­puter tally of hand-counted punchcard ballots from three precincts was delayed, said David Link, dean of the Univer­sity of Notre Dame Law School. County officials were awaiting authorization of payment for computer time, he said. 
Link was appointed to direct the tallying by the three­member state Recount Com­miSsion. Democratic chal­lenger Thomas Ward, a Knox attorney and Notre Dame graduate, requested the recount after losmg by 66 votes to Republican incumbent John Hiler of LaPorte. The race was the nation's most closely con­tested congressional election. 
Auditors working in St. Joseph and Elkhart counties have also conducted a re­tallying of the disputed Indiana House 5th District election. Completion of the tally in that race depends oq the running of the delayed computer tabula­tion. 
The 3rd District's 450 precincts also reach into por­tions of Kosciusko, Marshall, Starke and LaPorte counties.

ness to make money off the stu­dents. We think we should be there to provide a positive so­cial environment." 
Lytle said he thinks the crea­tion of Briggs' position was "a high liability question" be­cause of the alcohol-serving na­ture of the Club. 
"The liability issue is a major concern," Lytle said, "but we were doing very well in that area -we had no major run-ins or problems with use of fake IDs. If there are any major abuses, that would all get reported to Student Af­fairs," he said, noting that Notre Dame security officers are regularly assigned to the Club. 

Briggs agreed with Lytle that "the University's concern with the alcohol problem today" was a reason for the creation of his position, saying the Ad­ministration "feels a little more secure with me being there as far as the liability issue." 
"I'm mainly here for guid­ance," Briggs said, citing his work in restaurant manage­ment and his teaching degree as experiences which qualify him in this capacity. 
Briggs emphasized that his job has not been created to take over positions and duties cur­rently performed by the stu­dent management. 
"I'm actually the head manager so I suppose I would be (the Club's student workers') boss, but I'm not taking over any of their duties," Briggs said. 
Lytle agreed, saying that "this year (Briggs) is mainly there to observe." 
"I still order the alcohol and I still handle the staff; he can only offer suggestions in those areas," Lytle said.

Johnson said Security plans to offer morP. tlducational pro­grams tnroughout the next term. He said blood-alcohol testing will be conducted periodically. "We don't want to run it in a way that would en­courage contest drinking," Johnson said. 
Johnson held a meeting on Wednesday night at Morrissey Hall dealing with the legal aspects of being stopped and tested for drunk driving. The 
meeting focused primarily on 
driver's rights. 
Two students volunteered to 
consume six to eight beers in a 
controlled environment before 
the meeting. Later in the eve­
ning, the students were sub­
jected to standard coordination 
and field breath tests by a 
member of Notre Dame secur­

a preliminary breath testing device," said Johnson. This al­cosensor test is not mandatory, but the breathalyzer test is. 
Trooper Kevin Kubsch of the Indiana State Police said "When you sign your name on a driver's license, you consent to take a breathalyzer test if a peace officer has probable cause." The breathalyzer test is given at the station. If a driver refuses to take this test, he will have his license revoked in Indiana for one year. 
"If you ask me how I feel about drunk drivers, I would just as soon lock one up as look 
at him, because I was the vic­tim of a drunk driver last year." said Kubsch, adding, "An officer observes every movement you make." Fur­ther testing is based on his de­termination of "probable cause" in the actions that a driver exhibits as soon as he gets out of the car. 
In response to questions on various methods of sobering up, Kubsch said "There is noth­ing known to man that will af­fect the blood alchohol level."

University turned its back on students' drinking 
A member of our community has been killed. Another -also one of us ­has the burden of that death to carry with him. 
James Tunstead Burtchaell, C.S.C. 
we were not there 
But the burden is too large for that one young man to shoulder. Our full tragedy cannot be put to rest by the funeral Eucharist held here two days ago, because many of us who crowded Sacred Heart Church and joined our own grief with the general mourning should bear the responsibility for more than this death, to which our long negligence has contributed. 
All of the principals in last weekend's violence had spent the evening at a stu­dent drinking party: a party that was large and, by all accounts, largely given over to the dull and recurring campus routine of drunkenness. 
It was nearly 20 years ago that we decided to allow students to drink here. We formulated a principle then that was simple and clear. Students were to be accountable for how they drank. And we insisted, based on a continual expe­rience of loutish and drunken behavior when students drank alcohol in riotous assembly, that they were unlikely, and possibly unable, to drink humanely in large numbers. The rule was simple and clear: no intoxication, and no drinking in public. No alcohol abuse; no alcoholic crowds. Itwas a sound and simple rule. We simply failed to live by it. 
The Notre Dame tradition had always been that campus life was the respon­sibility of the senior people here. Our dorms and clubs and entertainments differed from fraternities. Wherever the students lived or studied or ate or prayed or took their leisure or traveled in groups, we were their mentors and 


P.O.BoxQ 
Homosexuals are not ashamed but cautious 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to the recent publicity of homosexuals at Notre Dame, such as the lectures by John For­tunato and Jeanine Grammick. Many times, in the dining halls and else­where, I have heard students wonder aloud why so many homosexuals choose to remain anonymous. They usually conclude that these people are ashamed to be homosexual. 
I would like to remind these people of a time, not so long ago, when people were "ashamed" to be Catholic. Job ap­plicants would simply enter "Chris­tian" on their applications, because a Catholic would probably not be hired. In Philadelphia, the burning of Catholic churches was hardly a rare phenome­non. Many bigots, including the Ku

companions. Not every minute of it was enjoyable ...on either side. All those Glee Club tours and nights in the dorms and junior proms could be tedious and taxing. There was a discipline to up­hold, the common good to profess. 
But what counted most was that we were there. Oh, there were always some things done that we failed to see, and things we winked at. But we were there and not as intruders. It was our place, built to welcome them, but not on their terms alone. It was a place where older adults moderated what younger adults did as a community. We were there. 
The drinking got bad when we stopped being there. Rectors began to give in and to allow section parties, and then hall parties and class parties. But since the students almost always lost control, they were often disgusting par­ties, and the rectors disliked being there. Student Affairs people knew that the bar scene was becoming an embar­rassment, and for awhile we even pro­vided a special bus for underage stu­dents too drunk to find their way home from the state line when the bars there ran dry. We were not there when the freshmen disgorged and were dis­gorged at the circle. We built our own tavern where students could start drinking at lunchtime. We owned it, but let students manage it; we stayed away. We hired special social workers, though, and sent student drunks to them for counseling. 
Some years back there was a great onset of conscience about alcohol here. There had been some ugly incidents we called accidents. There had been much alcoholism. Lives were lost, lives were wasted. 
And what did we do then? We rewrote the rule. The one straightforward rule bloomed into a document that would make the U.S. Tax Code look simple. We now have a University Rule on AI­cobol, and an Alcohol Policy and Alco­hol Regulations: thousands and thousands of words nobody reads. If anyone did, he or she would notice that the previous concern that students not abuse themselves with alcohol has been overshadowed by a newer concern that their victims not abuse us with law­suits. Liability was the word, not sobriety. 

The rule had never been our problem. 
The people were the problem: all the ~hall staff and Student Affairs people who were turning their backs on the drinking scene. We lacked the nerve to 
confront the students. And we played 
with words instead. We abolished alco­
hol abuse in DuLac. 
Massive drinking bouts have moved out of the dorms into town. We have dumped our drunkenness and bratti­ness on South Bend. The lawfolk there seem still to think that we would like our students given preferential treat­ment. But someday the neighbors' out­rage will prevail. 
Several weeks ago two residence halls held a joint formal dance. It was a big dance, in a downtown hotel (our campus is apparently too small for dances). There was only fruit juice and soda served at the dance (no liability). The students, however, booked rooms for the night: an entire floor was set aside for them. So the thirsty shuttled back and forth throughout the evening, boozing on one floor and dancing on the other. Mter the band went home at one, activities moved entirely to the hotel bedrooms. 
Who was there with those hundreds of seriously drinking students? One hall was represented by its rector, for about an hour. The other rector and assistant rector stayed away. In a word, we were not there. Nothing has changed. We have realms of local canon law on the subject, but Du Lac is not what was needed in the bedrooms of the 
Klux Klan, would verbally and yes, physically abuse . Catholics. My own grandfather lost his job as principal of a high school when his employers dis­covered that he was Catholic (he was too proud to enter "Christian"). 
Were these people actually ashamed to be Catholic? Of course not, but they did suffer from the very human emo­tion of fear. Why should homosexuals be any different? Gay people suffer al­most identical persecution everyday in American society. Some have the courage to make their sexual prefer­ence public knowledge, and, very often, suffer from job loss, harassment and "bashing." 
Many people are proud to be gay, but realize the consequences of coming out publicly. They are no better or worse than those who chose to enter "Chris­tian".

Simple message is do not drink and drive 
Dear Editor: 
This article is not the first you've seen about drunk driving and it will not be the last, but it carries a message unlike the messages found in the other arti­cles. How many voices, how many ad­vertisements, how many posters have told you not to drink and drive? Too many? No, not enough. 
This past weekend we lost a friend who has been a dear friend for more than two years now. The loss is one which we cannot describe -mere words cannot explain the special person Mike was and what he meant to us. We can tell you, though, that it is just too hard. Please believe us. Don't ever allow yourself or a friend to take a chance.

Americana at 5 a.m. Our backs were turned. 
Looking the other way is as much a problem in academics as it has been in student life. For several years now there has been a stir about cheating. Now you could sit down any dozen stu­dents for an hour and come up with a list of 10 or 15 faculty members who are responsible for 90 percent of the cheating that goes on around here. I mean teachers who hand out 300 identi­cal multiple-choice tests, or who assign papers on the very same topics semes­ter after semester, and don't notice that they are reading the same essays over and over. A really crafty student may occasionally slip something past most of us, but the faculty members whose irresponsibility positively invites con­tempt for truth-telling: they are the ob­vious persons to go after. 
Instead, the Academic Council has, with a straight face, been presented with reports and proposals that throw pages of legal confetti at cheating. The problem is not our policy. The policy is as straightforward as the old alcohol rule was: one rule with two parts. Stu­dents are responsible for honest work; and if cheating does occur it strikes at the heart of the education process and cannot be a private matter between an instructor and a student. The rule is not the problem, but no one seems to be accountable for the rule. Once again, we are flinching at confronting the real irresponsibility, and we are tempted to drift into denial by paper fantasies. 
The cost of a Notre Dame education for us who are the elders is that we be with the students, and that we be ac­countable for them and they be ac­countable to us. We must, in a word, be there. But we are not there. And now people are dying of it. 
Father Burtchaell is a professor ofthe­ology and resides in Holy Cross Hall. 
Mistakes are made and mistakes are forgiven, but the pain is never forgot­ten. We love parties and bars and dances, but they only last a few hours. Friends last a lifetime, and when a good time takes a friend away, it takes on a new meaning. Please listen to this ­drinking is not that important. We can­not use lives to pay for a good time anymore. Life is too precious. If this message reaches just one of you, we will have achieved our goal. Please just don't drive if you've been drinking.

P.O.BoxQ 
Priorities must be kept during times of change 
Dear Editor: 
Notre Dame students do not have their priorities straight. The biggest isue on campus today is the closure of Carroll and Holy Cross Hall and the "eviction" of Howard residents. A dis­tant second, and if not further down on the list, is the fact that drunk Notre Dame students have killed two men in the last month. 
Monday afternoon, after the tragic story was known to all, I could still hear students bragging about what a great time they had on Friday night and how drunk they were at a half-dozen bars and parties. One expects the shock to wear off eventually, of course, but I thought two hours later showed great resilience on their part. 
Last year, when Notre Dame fresh­man Kevin Hurley was struck by a South Bend resident at the entrance to Saint Mary's College, the outpouring of sympathy and anger was remarkable. A similar reaction came when some Notre Dame students were struck on South Bend A venue a few years earlier. But now? One article on the first death, and one now. Today -three days later -only a small "Of Interest" memorializes the young man. 

Even when the Student Senate -for probably the twentieth time since I've been at this school -calls for greater "alcohol education," no mention is made of why it is needed: two men are dead because of the irresponsibility of Notre Dame students. Maybe the prob­lem is that many Notre Dame students want to deny these deaths because they fear that someday it could be them ap­pearing as the unidentified driver in an Observer article. But the real problem is that those students do not want to take responsibility for their drinking. 
It is simple to have someone in the group stop drinking a couple of hours before leaving the party. It is simple to call a taxi, if necessary, or maybe even crash at the host's house. There are a 

Diversity of religion is rare at Notre Dame 
That's right. I did not have turkey on Thanksgiving Day. I had my meal in the dining hall. 

Patti Tripathi 
guest column 
Don't be shocked. Do you celebrate holi? ... or Diwali? .... or Rak­chabandhan? 
A mien of disbelief prevails when I say that I do not celebrate traditional American festivities. At the University of Notre Dame, where a non-Catholic is one of the three percent minority, the raised eyebrow and wide-eyed response is common because most are not ex­posed to people of diverse background. 
If it is not the appalled expression on the visage then it is an expression of sympathy. Other, however, choose dif­ferent routes: "Don't you believe in God?" the questioning begins. "I heard that Indians do not eat cows but what's wrong with a turkey? or "In my family it is the most celebrated holiday. What's wrong with your parents?" 
Having been raised in India with an upbringing that is not solely Catholic, I am a double minority on campus. In my case it is not a question of religious difference that prevents me from celebrating many of the holidays. Al­though I am not a Christian by birth, I attend Mass periodically. Therefore, a Christmas, a Thanksgiving, or an Easter as celebrated by most estab­lished Americans would be for me a treasured experience. (By established I mean an American who has not just immigrated to the country.) 
Many do not realize the difficulty of incorporating the practices of another culture into one's own. It is even more difficult for the first-generation im­

migrant (like me) who is ignorant of 
just what each holiday entails. Those 
who have been abroad can perhaps em­
pathize with the situation of the few 
"aliens" on campus. 
Then there are those who cannot 
relate because they insist on bombard­
ing with their narrow-minded com­
ments and assumptions. At Notre 
Dame, where the student body is com­
posed of persons of similar background 
and social standing, bigots rise up to 
assert their convictions. 
The reaction to holidays is a trivial 
example of intolerance. Annually, a let­
ter appears in my mailbox in order to 
remind me that I have checked my re­
ligious preference as "other" and that 
if I wish I may specify the title of my 
faith by checking the appropriate box. 
Is it necessary for me to put a tag on 
myself? Does God have a religion? 
Once in a while I come across persons 
who feel that "I can still be saved" if 
I were to convert to Christianity. 
Will changing my label bring me closer to God? I don't think so. The con­tent of a can of soup does not change if the label on the can were to be switched. 
-I am not out to convince everyone that they will reincarnate into ants if they do not pay heed to their Karmas. But it is annoying when people make it their prime motive to instill their beliefs in others. 
Mutual respect and tolerance is beyond culture, religion, and boundary. Most on the campus are quite accom­modating, discreet, and respectful of foreigners. I suggest to the others that they phrase questions or comments in a way that is not offensive. 
Patti Tripathi is a junior American Studies and English major. 
lot of ways to avoid driving drunk, but 
they all require the person to take a 
little responsibility for his or her ac­
tions. That, unfortunately, does not 
seem to be a common trait among stu­
dents here. 
From what I know of one of the 
drivers, there is some bitter irony in 
this. He was not one to drive drunk; he 
was outspokenly against such drivers. 
Unfortunately, he apparently mis­
judged his condition. But it only takes 
one such misjudgement. Yes, it could 
have been any of us -you, me, anyone 
who ever drinks could make this mis­
take. But if the "Notre Dame family" 
means anything, we should be helping 
each other to be responsible, especially 
when another's life is at risk. Human 
life is much more important than the 
location of student residencies. A much 
greater injustice was done to the two 
victims than ever has been done to stu­
dents by the administration. 
People will blame the alcohol policy for these deaths, and it may have been a contributing factor. ·But I hope stu­dents realize that the ultimate respon­sibility to drive sober lies with them, not Father Beauchamp or Father Mal­loy. And I hope students realize why the South Bend and County Police are eager to break up parties and minimize the number of drunks on the street. But most of all, I hope these tragic events will shake students up enough to ensure that no one need pick up The Observer and read about one ever again. 
Thomas S. Mowle Off-Campus 
Restructuring the ratio will benefit community 
Dear Editor: 
Mter reading for two days the arti­cles, letters and personals of outraged Howard Hall residents -in particular Bill Herzog's guest column of Dec. 9­I find a definite need to put into per­spective what the real issue is here. 
The issue is not whether or not Howard men should be ousted from their home, but whether or not more women should be admitted to the Uni­versity of Notre Dame. The answer to this is yes, more women should be ad­mitted. This is not only for their edu­cational benefit and the benefit of wo­men already on campus from the increased sense of belonging and sis­terhood that would result (similar to the great sense of brotherhood that exists now), but for the advantage it would provide the men also. 
In this respect, I am not referring, as Herzog did, to the fact that more women on campus means more possi­ble SYR dates. Since a majority of stu­dents at Notre Dame came from Cath­olic, single-sex high schools, college needs to be a place closer to the "real world" with respect to the femal&tnale ratio. A greater female element is desperately needed at Notre Dame to help shed the minority status of women, as well as to expose the male majority to viewpoints other than their own. 
While I do sympathize with the Howard residents who now have to move from the dorm they have come to know as home, I refuse to believe that their inconvenience is more impor­tant than the opportunity for more wo­men to be educated at this highly­regarded university. Let's put aside this selfishness, sexism or whatever else might be motivating our outrage. If Herzog is so repulsed by the thought of being asked in the future to a Howard SYR, he need only continue subscribing to his views on women and their role on campus to be assured that the ugly situation will never present itself. 
No matter where we live on campus, we are already "in" Notre Dame. We earned, and were given this opportunity to learn. Why not let others who have earned it have this chance and welcome them with open arms?

Toys for Tots drive benefits handicapped 
Dear Editor: 
On behalf of Notre Dame's Semper Fidelis Society and the staffs of Logan Center and Memorial Hospital, we would like to extend our personal grat­itude to all who aided the 1986 Toys for Tots campaign. Through the generous support of the Notre Dame community, over $2,000 worth of toys will be donated to the special children at Logan Center and Memorial Hospital this Christmas. 
Our efforts are part of a national campaign sponsored by the United States Marine Corps Reserve to bring the joy of a Christmas toy to needy children throughout the United States. At Logan Center and Memorial Hospi­tal, the donated toys will also help develop the skills of the handicapped as these children learn through playing. The dearest and most precious posses­sions of a child are his toys, and our individual small gifts together have brought great joy to many.

Help for fire victims is desperately needed 
Dear Editor: 
About ten days ago, a fire broke out in a house on North Eddy Street. The house was saved, but the interior was badly damaged. The owner, a divorcee, is now trying to clean it up so she can move back in with her four children before Christmas. 
She hasn't the money to hire labor. If anyone expects to be in this area be­tween now and Christmas, and would be willing to help wash and paint walls, it would be an immense assistance. 
Volunteers can contact me at 239­7651.

The aftermath of the Punk movement in Britian 
punk as a marketable product continues; the 'punk rockers' of London are now as much a part of British tourism as the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family. 


Since 1978, there has been a succession of musiC/fashion waves In Britain, all ofwhich have been promoted based on the model of the punk move~t. Included in these movements are the two-tone movement, the new romantics, gloom rock and the current soul boy craze. One result of this is that the British music scene Is as much con­cerned with fashion today as It ever was. 
America has been relatively unaffected by punk and the other British music movements, ex­cept in isolated areas. There are several reasons for this. First of all, American young people, un­like their British counterparts, do not equate their Identity with their clothes and their clothes with those of their favorite band, at least to any large degree. 
Secondly, the British have a television show called "Top of the Pops" that Is shown nation­wide and runs down the British Top 40 from the previous week, featuring a few of the artists from that week's charts. This gives kids a chance to see their favorite artists as well as the latest sensa­tions from London. If a band looks cool and makes a good Im­pression, their sales can skyrock­et. and song is artificially created. the way it does in Manchester.

Ribs and Blues: alternative 

GREG DEFILIPPO, EMMET MURPHY, TIMBO HEALY features writers 
If you feel like us, you're start­Ing to get tired ofthe usual Friday night grind. You know -a little bar or party hopping, some drinking, etc. Well, we've got an alternative for you; a relaxing evening at Ribs and Blues where you can e'1Joy the best rhythm and blues and soul food In the area. 
The Bar Beat 
~lflflflf (outoffou<J 
It all started one Friday night. We were sitting around wonder­Ing what we could do to get away from the usual routine. When suddenly, Emmet had a flash­back of his childhood In the streets of Chicago. When he was young, he spent many late nights at bars and clubs waiting for his father's blues band to play the last of their many long sets. Al­though It was a rough life, Em­met loved the music and could never get It out ofhis head. While re-living this child hood memory he was In a trance for more than one-half an hour when we decided we better do something. We figured that If he heard some good rhythm and blues maybe he would snap out of it. So we headed out for "Michlana's Home of the Blues." Ribs and Blues. 

Well, we were right. As soon as we entered the front door the pulsating blues beat produced by "Peter and the Rhythm Flames" brought Emmet back to reality. After relaxing to a couple of sets of fantastic rhythm and blues music, we started to get a little hungry. We decided to try a bit of everything, which at Ribs and Blues, Isn't a bad Idea. The ribs and rib tips were excellent. The meal was tender and smot­hered In a sauce that was not too hot but was full of great barbe­cued flavor. 
The catfish was equally satis­fying. It was tender and juicy like the ribs and had fantastic batter coating. Each of these were served In huge portions with fries, cole slaw and bread. 
After devouring these deli­cious entrees, a Mexican­American hitchhiker who hap­pened to be sitting near us leaned over and suggested that we try the pig ear sandwich. At first we weren't to sure, but being the crazy guys we are, we went ahead and ordered it. Still curious, Bill Argenta asked "Hey, what's In this pig ear sandwich," and Peter Dames, the owner, responded "It's Pig ear." We all eagerly awaited Its arrival at the table and when It finally arrived we knew we were In trouble. It iooked, smelled, tasted, and was, a pig ear sandwich. After trying It we all decided to stick with the ribs and catfish. But, who knows, If you like soul food maybe pig ear Is the meal for you. After all, as Peter Dames stated, "It's real soul." 
Besides this delicious dinner menu, Ribs and Blues, also has soul food lunches, served after 11 a.m. which Include ham hocks, pork steak, cubed steak, mashed or sweet potatoes, greens, corn bread, and much more. All of these selections are moderately priced and served In huge portions that would fill anyone's desires. 
The overall atmosphere Is laid­back and Inviting, but also very Interesting. The crowd consists of many different types ofpeople and everyone seems to get along great. While we were there, Joe "The Magnet" Keller got out on the dance floor and soon there were people ofall ages and back­grounds out there dancing with him. This friendly atmosphere Is added to by the generosity and hospitality of Peter Dames and the waitresses. It's a great change from the hectic, cold scene that some of the popular bars seem to produce. Ribs and Blues, overall, Is a place where you can kick-back and forget that endless stream of tests and papers, and really relax to some excellent rhythm and blues bands. 
During the month of Decem­ber, there will be Jive bands from Chicago on Thursday through Sunday nights. There Is a $.3 cover charge but It Is well worth It and yes, they do serve alcohol. 
The music starts around 9:.30 get there. go south on .31 and p.m., so get there a little early take a right on Western Avenue. and e'1Joy the great soul food The address Is .3201 Western Av­and the relaxing blues sound. To enue.

'Solar Babies' is an annoying failure· 
SUSAN CLEMENTS features writer 

Solar Babies -even the name has an Irritating ring to it. 
The title was aptly chosen. Like the movie It repreresents, the title gives ab· solutely no clue to Its meaning. and you're not really sure If you want a clue to figure out this mystery.

Released to the discredit of Brookslllms studios, the 111m attempts to achieve a jumble of effects, but Is destroyed from the outset by the story It tells. 
Of all the problems the movie has, the 
most dismaying Is Its failure to make any 
sense. The viewer emerges from the 
theater believing -or at least wishing -that 
he just spent an hour and a half staring 
at a blank screen. The main plot revolves 
around a group of teenagers who roller­
skate their way through an annoying ad­
venture In quest of a floating luminescent 
ball. 

Sound annoying? Wait, there's more. 
The movie takes place In the future, after 
some horrifying event has deprived the 
earth of rain and all its oceans and seas 
have dried up. It Is an ugly place, my 
friends, and If this movie were a predic­
tion I would strongly advise against any 
attempt to live beyond the next I00 years 
or so. 

The world by then has become an out­landish jumble of very weird things. Screenplay writers Walon Green and Douglas Metrov make no attempt to ex­plain the reason behind the things they throw Into the future. 
The main characters are for some rea­son doomed to live In an Orwellian or­phanage, entire cities are constructed from junk. and there are no real people -only sadistic military leaders, -zombie-like laborers, and a strange tribe of undeter-

mined origin living In tin wigwams. If none of these get you, the good guys will. Of the main characters, the least an­noying is a glowing sphere that serves the double role of magical hockey puck and savior of the world. 
I say "annoying" because none of the characters come across convincingly or hit home with any force. This is due In part to the utter ridiculousness of the world they Inhabit; it becomes Impossible to take seriously anything they say. 

Much of the cast consists of castaways from floundering TV series, and the only one who evokes any sympathy at all Is Lukas Haas, who plays the lnsuppres­sable Daniel. His Is the most convincing character, which may stem from the fact that. as the youngest member of the cast. he comes closest to believing In the pos­sibility of the situation. 
But none of this matters, because after the movie you can hardly remember the faces of the characters, let alone their names. The sad thing Is that a group of better actors could have done little more with the script. 
Director Alan Johnson falls In the her­culean task of drawing credibility out of the cast. and the movie's average pace seems to drag on under the weight of the given plot. The special effects are wasted on such things as creative torture devices, which do come off as pretty dis· gusting. and thus, I suppose, succeed. The little ball Bodhl Is cute and zings around with animation, but It looks like something that fell out of a Christmas special. and doesn't really belong In this warped world. 
There Is, of course, some underlying meaning to the film--something symbolic about the search for the savior that will restore water to the earth--but the viewer has no desire to remember, let alone analyze, such an Irritating movie. Which Is sad, because with the simple substltu· tlon of a totally different story line and the replacement of a few actors, Solar Babies (oops, I guess we need a new name, too) might even be a decent movie. As It stands, however, the only way I'd recommend going to see It Is If you plan to wander Into the showing of another movie.

Theory bette~ on wax than paper 
MARY JACOBY features editor 
All right, so the latest Game Theory album is a little old. Released this summer, it was one of the brighter spots in my album collection. It deserves some at­tention, so here goes. 


Records 

The Big Shot Chronicles 
GameTheo..Y 
The Big Shot Chronicles fol­lows pretty faithfully in the footsteps of its predecessor, Real Nighttime. As it seems to go with good albums and the American buying public, practically no one heard Real Nighttime. That's a shame, because if people could get past the unfamiliarity with the group they'd probably like what they found; Game Theory's sound is sweetly complex and full of resonance and bouncy pop rhythms. 

Game Theory consists of two men and two women, led by guitarist and lead vocalist Scott Miller of the self described "miserable whine." It's true Mil­ler's voice is somewhat high, but it lends to the uniqueness of the group's sound and punctuates their well crafted songs. 
And perhaps the biggest influ­ence on their sound --and it's defintely a positive one at that --is the production of Mitch Easter who worked on The Big Shot Chronicles as well as the last al­bum. Easter, a pop wizard who's worked wonders with his own group, Let's Active, as well as others such as R. E. M., has pro­vided a definition and cohesive­ness not apparent in Game The­ory's earlier releases. 
The album's opener, "Here It Is Tomorrow," is a powerful, forceful song--for Game Theory, at least. Building up from a monorhythmic drums, guitar and Miller's angry voice, the song bursts into a pop plateau in the chorus with harmony, keyboards and ringing guitars. 
Miller, with his "miserable whine," stretches it a bit when he trys to sound angry, but his voice knows how to plead and explain on the beautiful slower songs such as "Where You Going Northern," "Regenisraen" and the album's last song, "Like a Girl Jesus." "Regenisraen" ·in partic­ular will kill you with it's harp­like, solitary guitar, the sad alienated vocals and the choir of harmony in the chorus. Similar­ly, "Like a Girl Jesus," with its slow, string-by-sting beginning, builds up with echoes and effects until the drums and guitar kick it into a deep, ringing chorus. 
But the majority of Game The­ory's songs are punchy pop songs which bounce between drums and guitars--punctuated by keyboards and harmonies-­which will hook listeners into their sound after a couple of spins. But that's the key --you have to hear it first.

Lone Justice's 'Shelter' too limited 

DENNIS CORRIGAN features writer 

When the stylus hit Lone Jus­tice's new album Shelter, it ex­pected to hear the sound of country infused rock. Instead, it got a solid backbeat and grungy guitar chords, the two sounds that mark Lone Justice's new release. Anyone expecting to hear songs like "After the Flood" from last year's self-titled debut

year. But beyond McKee, no one _..lse matters. McKee is clearly the focus for the band and boasts one of the strongest and most unusual voices in rock music today. She can belt out such rockers as "I Found Love" and "Belfry" with all the power of a modern-day Janis Joplin. But on the slower, countryish "Wheels" and "Dixie Storms," McKee sounds like the rock 'n' roll in­carnation of Dolly Parton. 
As a songwriter, though, McKee is less than powerful. Shelter focuses in on just that theme, looking for refuge from the storms of life. McKee wants to be the solution as in the al­bums's first single and title song and is looking for It on "Beacon" and "Belfry." She writes about faith in dreams on "Dreams Come True (Stand Up and Take It)," and love as inspiration on the aptly titled "Inspiration": 
The problem 'is, all these themes have been hit before and much more originally. Lighthouses have been symbols of hope since man began to write lyrics. McKee was at her best orr 
last year's release when singing about her rural background. The only song that comes close to that is "Dixie Storms," which closes the album. 
Musically, Shelter has a stronger and harder feel than Lone Justice's first release largely because of new drummer Rudy Richman and bass player Gregg Sutton. But Shelter suffers from Jimmy Iovine's overly slick production. The single "Shelter," with its synthesizer Intraand lush backing vocals is perhaps the worst offender. The album Isjust too clean. From its packaging, which looks like a slicker R.E.M. cover, to its music, Lone Jus-. tice's Shelter is just too glossy for McKee's voice to overcome, which is a shame.

The tale of a prodigal Father 
The fiction about extrater­restrials Is based on the assump­tion that mankind on the planet earth Is not alone In the universe. Beyond this galaxy, at a distance measured by light-years, Is the star from which E.T. came. In the millenia ahead, perhaps there will be ten million stars from

 chaplain at Yale, lost his son In a driving accident. A colleagueletters to a lonely God piously assured him that the death was God's will. Coffin 
which an endless number of 
E.T.s will come on Inter-galactic holidays to find Elliott. Our scien­tists keep probing outer space, hoping to make contacts with planets occupied by aliens like 
E.T. The Immensity of creation makes It seem certain that human beings are not the only life forms In the limitless sea of space. 
Religion certainly doesn't teach that the human race was assigned to this globe so that, looking around, we would stay humble at our smallness, waiting to be upstaged bya race ofgiants we haven't yet met. Religions, as well as science, would be suprlsed to learn God went to so much trouble for the sake of Adam's children as His one and only experiment. 
God's love Is full of surprises. The Incarnation Is far more hum­bling than any statistics Carl Sagan could give us. Perhaps faith would be easier If God had scaled things down, so that that we wouldn't have to be amazed at His exhibition of power. Maybe we would be happier In a uni­verse of more modest dimen­sions. 
At Tuesday night's Penance Service, Father Andre read the parable of the Prodigal Son. The younger lad In the story needs his father's forglvenness; the fa­ther, of course Is the God-figure extending Himself In mercy to the sinner guilty of wasting grace. On Wednesday, I reflected, Father Hesburgh would be offering a memorial mass for a Notre Dame student who died at age 20, the latest on that long list of Domers dying young. I wondered: does God ever feel He needs forgiveness from us? A younger son threw away a fortune on riotous living; finally feeling ashamed of him­self, he went home to his father on his knees. God seems care­less about preserving human life; what Is money compared to a life that's allowed to be lost? 
Friends die In accidents, wars, floods and other catastrophes, and they die from disease. Fat­hers of young families die at the hands of drug-crazed thugs met In the street. Mothers die from cancers that eat their bodies as their children watch In horror. The questions we ask when faced with suffering that results In the deaths of young. much-needed people Is: "Why does God let It happen? Why Is He so careless with lives that the angels are sup­posed to watch over?'' A child as perfect as a lovely rose suddenly gets sick with leukemia, and the 
disease ruins the loveliness, despite the prayers offered to a deity who seems Indifferent to the destruction ofa masterpiece. What Is God trying to prove, 

and to whom Is He trying to prove a sinful nation. Even while we're It?

How unfulfllllng religion Is when scholars forget to tell us how the divine pity Is possible In a Trinity of Persons knowing and loving themselves In perfect contentment. Textbook descriptions of God leave a lot to be desired when they make Him sound too et­hereal to be streetwlse, as though the Biblical Images were only figures of speech. 
The 20th century has seen too much horror to leave theology to the metaphysicians. The high water mark of revelation Is the Cross on which the Saviour died. The Man of Sorrows reveals the Father th the Holy Ghost Involved In His mission In a way that Is Indivisible from the Son being Himself as the servant and vic­tim. Calvary begins the theology which makes sense out of death beds, to which the Spirit comes as the Comforter, over which the Father grieves, seeing truth where I see mystery. 
It's hard for us to accept large truths that come In small pack­ages, or to be served with mys­teries when we ask for miracles. The Lord, taking the cross on His shoulders, was harder on Him­self than anyone. He wants us to believe that nothing Is Impossible with God. He Initiates us with the holy Christmas story piecing together the tradition. The only proof we have of Its truth Is that the human Imagina­tion doesn't soar so high; It's as Imaginative In Its way, as the uni­verse Is In the arrangement of space. It seems worthy of the divine author, and we have noth­Ingas wonderful to take Its place. The world would be poorer with­out it. Everytlme a carol Is sung. I believe the magic assuring me that God so loved the world that he gave His only begotten Son In the way the Gospel says He gave Him. I wish you the grace of believing as Christmas. Merry Christmas from Darby O'Glll and me. We never said we didn't love you.

ND women's hoops goes west for holidays 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame women's basketball team is hoping that a trip to the west coast over the holidays will give the Califor­nia sun a chance to shine on its efforts. 
Thus far, the Irish have struggled to an 0-4 record in a less-than-impressive start to the 1986-87 season (the worst start in the school's history, in fact), and have lost their only senior in Lavetta Willis be­cause of her decision to quit the team while citing personal reasons. But eight games over Christmas break will give Head Coach Mary DiStanis­lao's team a chance to improve on those numbers. 
Notre Dame is at home for a pair of games, against Loyola and St. Ambrose, before the players head for their own homes to celebrate Christmas. Before the new year, however, the Irish will head to the west coast for the Seattle Times Classic and a pair of games in California. 


Here is a quick look at some of the obstacles awaiting Notre Dame (Irish home games are in caps) over Christmas break: 
LOYOLA -The former North Star Conference rivals lost their best player in Kathy Leyden, but return senior guard Sharon Carr (12.6 points per game last year). The Lady Ramblers finished with an overall record of 20-7 last season and always play the Irish well. 
ST, AMBROSE -The Queen Bees from the state of Iowa won 20 games last year while dropping 12 and return five letter-winners from a nine-man squad last year. Junior Patty Campbell (15.1 ppg.) is a strong all-around player. 
The Seattle Times Classic ­The Irish tip off action in this tournament against last year's Big Eight champion, Okla­homa, which won the confer­ence with a 24-7 overall record. The good news for the Irish is that the Sooners lost 11 players from that team and will rely on LaTrenda Phillips (13.1 ppg.) for much of their scoring. 
11No more strong teams round out the tournament field. Montana returns eight letter­winners from a team which finished 22-15, while Pac 10 champion Washington finished last season at 24-6. 
At Loyola-Marymount -The Lions won only three games last year and return just two players from that team. The Irish should do well in this one. 
At UCLA -The Bruins struggled to a 12-16 mark and a fourth-place conference finish last season, but lost only one letter-winner heading into this campaign. Junior Jamie Brown (11.6 ppg.) is the top re­turning scorer and should anchor a quick squad. 
MARYLAND-The Irish beat the Terrapins by a 49-40 score last season, but Maryland has six solid players returning, in­cluding sophomore Deana Tate, who averaged better than 
16.5 points an outing as a fresh­man. 
At Northern Illinois -The Irish should not encounter too many problems against the Huskies, who won only eight contests last season. The top returner for Northern Illinios is senior Shelly Roberts, who averaged nearly 14 points in her junior campaign.

In the overtime period, Soucie opened the scoring with his fifth three-pointer, but Con­nor answered with a home run of his own to even the score at 
68. The teams traded inside hoops and McCaskill hit a 12­footer before Rivers and Stevenson hit two free throws apiece to put the Irish on top by two. Connor then hit a jumper from the key to put the Irish on top for good. 
Despite the important three­point goals by Jackson and Con­nor, Phelps used his post-game press conference to chastise the rule. 
"Sean Connor is a great out­side shooter and he hit the three-pointer to get us the game -but so is Soucie," he said. "They just traded three­pointers -and that's fine -but let's make it worth three points. Let's move it back to23 feet."

Carlin says he will be able to compete in the California meets, while Mitchell's status remains questionable. 
"I'll be back in the lineup. It's almost 100 percent healed now," said Carlin. "I'll have to work hard over break and get in shape. Over the holidays, I'll practice with my high school. Then we come back to Notre Dame on Dec. 27, and I'll practice here." 
The Irish can only hope that Carlin is starting to solve the injury riddle that has plagued the team all year. Junior 158-pounder Dan Carrigan injured his knee at last weekend's Las Vegas Invi­tational and is out for at least the rest of the year. 
"It hasn't been a good year with in­juries. You just don't expect injuries," said McCann. "We can't count on get­ting big decisions from our strong people. The competition's going to get tougher, and we'd better be ready." 
Whether Notre Dame is healthy or not, the Irish will have their hands full at California. The Cal-State Fullerton Tournament will include over 20 schools, including nationally-ranked teams Oklahoma State, Arizona State, and Fresno State. 
Only two days afterward, the Irish will have dual meets against the Cal­State Fullerton Titans and the Cal Poly Mustangs on consecutive days.

ND faces seven holiday games 
Break poses challenge for Irish 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN 
Sports Editor 
After time off for finals, the Notre Dame men's basketball team will take to the court for two home games before Christmas. Following that, the Irish begin a five-game road trip, their longest of the year. Here's a brief sketch of the teams the Irish will face during the holiday season. Home games are in CAPS. 
VALPARAISO -This will be Notre Dame's first game fol­lowing the layover for final ex­ams. The toughest test for the Irish should be getting thier timing together. Last year in the same situation, Notre Dame blew out the Crusaders, 98-54. Valpo returns 10 players from its 9-19 team of a year ago, led by 6-4 forward Harry Bell. Bell averaged 13.5 points and 
6.8 rebounds a game last year. 
CENTRAL MICHIGAN -Mter time off for the team to go home for Christmas, Notre Dame returns to Domeland to face the Chippewas. Central Michigan was 11-17last season but made it to the Mid­American Conference playoffs. All five starters from that team return this season. Dan Majerle, a 6-6 forward, and Er­vin Leary, a 6-3 guard, are the head men for the Chippeawas. Majerle finished 16th in the na­tion in scoring average with a 
21.4 mark and was an all-MAC first teamer. Leary averaged 
18.6 points per game last season and was a second-team all-MAC pick. 
at Maryland -The Irish will try to ring in the new year with this game against the east­coast rival Terps. This will be Maryland's third game of the season, following Univeristy Chancellor John Slaughter's decision to open practice later because of lagging academics on the basketball team. Head Coach Bob Wade will have his hands full in his first season as he tries to rebuild the program on and off the court. The Terps return only one starter, Der­rick Lewis, to last season's 19­14 squad. Lewis was second in the ACC in blocked shots last season with 71 but averaged only 7.9 points per game. It could be a long season in Col­lege Park. 
at Pennsylvania -This will be Notre Dame's annual visit to the Palestra in Philadelphia, perhaps the last of the great old basketball courts. The Quakers return all five starters to a team that had its first win­ning season since 1983 with a 15-11 mark. Perry Bromwell, a two-time all-Ivy guard, and backcourt mate John Wilson

Associated Press 
BOWLING GREEN, Ky. ­Central Michigan, led by Dan Majerle with 23 points, went on an 8-0 run and built a 12-point lead at the start of the second half Thursday night en route to a 73-65 upset of No. 8 Western Kentucky. 
It was Western Kentucky's second loss in a row. The Hil­ltoppers, 6-3, fell60-58 to Louis­ville on Wednesday night. Central Michigan is now 3-1.

lead the Quakers. Wilson handed out 126 assists last season, the third-highest total in Penn history, and Bromwell averaged 13.2 points per con­test. Center Bruce Lefkowitz led the Quakers in scoring last year with a 14.2 average. This could be a tough one for the Irish. 
at Yale -This is Notre Dame's third and last game against Ivy League teams. The Elis are led by 6-10 center Chris Dudley. Dudley, a two-time all­Ivy selection, led the Ivy in rebounding with a 10.9 average and blocked shots with 26. He was third in the league in scoring, averaging 17.9 points a night. The Elis, 13-13 last year, return their other four starters as well. 
at DePaul -Notre Dame's first game against one of the Great Independents will also be its greatest break challenge. The Blue Demons, 18-13 last year including the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament, were hit hard by graduation, but return forward Dallas Com­egys and guard Rod Strickland.

Comegys, when he's on, can do it all-score (13.8 ppg), rebound 
(5.6) and block shots (a DePaul career record 190). Strickland showed flashes of brilliance as freshman in leading the team in scoring with a 14.9 average. In addition, he set DePaul freshman records in assists 
(160) and steals (60). On their home floor, the Blue Demons are more than imposing. 
at Creighton-Omaha, Neb., is the last stop on the longest road trip of the year. The Blue jays were 12-16 last year under first­year coach Tony Barone, but Barone returns only four players this seasons. For­tunately, the team's leading scorer and rebounder, Kenny Evans, is one of them. Evans averaged 15.9 points and 8.5 rebounds last seasons in ear­ning a spot on the All-Missourri Valley Conference second team. The Bluejays also have 6-11 freshman Mike Pomery eating space in the middle. Two years ago, the Bluejays shocked the Irish in Omaha, 60­58.

Irish survive Hurons in OT, 81-76; Free throws key in ND comeback 
By RICK RIETBROCK Sports Writer 

An old friend returned to the Notre Dame basketball team during the stretch drive of its contest with Eastern Michigan last night. The free throw, which had been so elusive in previous games when the Irish needed it most, came back and Notre Dame used it to over­come a fiesty Eastern Mic­higan squad in overtime, 81-76. 
David Rivers and Mark Stevenson combined to convert six of six from the gift line in the overtime to help the Irish pull away from the Hurons in the extra period. 
But what was Notre Dame's saving grace also served as Eastern Michigan's demise as the Hurons missed three suc­cessive front ends of one-and­one situations in the final four minutes of regulation to allow the Irish to crawl back from a seven-point deficit with 4: 41 to go. 
Those statistics only added frustration for EMU head coach Ben Braun, who saw his team's upset bid fall just short. 

"In the first half we had no turnovers and hit 15-of-17 free throws-and that's the kind of game we play most of the time," he said. "However, it was the same free throws that hurt us down the stretch. I'm still very proud of our players.'' 
It appeared as though Braun would be able to enjoy the eve­ning a lot more when his Hurons turned a 31-33 halftime deficit and a 46-53 deficit into a 65-58lead with only 4:41left in the game. 
After some fine work by Mike McCaskill, who had been held to only four points in the first half, and a Chuck King rebound basket, Brad Soucie hit his fourth three-point basket of the evening, and Lewis Scott hit a rebound goal to give the Hurons the seven-point advantage. 
But Digger Phelps' "press team" helped turn the tide. Jamere Jackson, Michael Smith, Rivers, Stevenson and Scott Hicks put pressure the Hurons and forced some hurried shots that, along with missed free throws, allowed

the Irish to come back. 
Jackson's three-point basket and Sean Connor's jumper pulled the Irish to within two at 65-63. Eastern's Lewis Scott then missed the front end of a one-and-one with 1:36 to go. Stevenson_ missed a fading jumper, but the Irish regained possession with 30 seconds remaining. After passirig"'"the ball around the key, Rivers penetrated and found Connor open on the right wing. Conner, slowed by a sprained ankle, sank the 17-footer with eight seconds on the clock to send the game into overtime. 
Eastern appeared confused, and with the bench calling for a time-out, let the clock run out before getting a shot off. 
Connor said he felt confident taking the clutch shot in the waning moments. 
"My shot was feeling good," he said. "I had hit a few in a row and I was in my rhythm, so I just tried to block out the circumstances at the time and let it go."

ND faces Ala.-Huntsville tonight 
Irish look to break .500 mark 
By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team will be looking to improve upon this season's 5-5 record at the expense of Alabama­Huntsville, which comes to the ACC this weekend for a two­game series with the Irish. Friday and Saturday nights' games will start at 7:30. 
Head Coach Lefty Smith feels that the way to achieve that success is by capitalizing on the numerous scoring oppor­tunities that have been opening up for the Irish over the last few games. 
"What we've been having a few problems with," says Smith, currently in his 19th year as head coach, "is that we've been pretty sporatic with our scoring chances, especially on the power play. Overall, our play has been all right, but spe­cial teams play a very big part in deciding the outcome of a hockey game, and we just need to be a little more consistent in 
those areas for the balance to start tipping our way." 
Alabama-Huntsville has a steadily improving program which has played the Irish evenly over the past few years. The Chargers own a 4-4-1 record against the Irish overall but have yet to win at the ACC arena. Smith, however, is wary of their team's ability. 
"Huntsville has a fine skating club," says Smith. "They attract a lot of talent out of the Detroit area and always seem to play us tough. We've shortened practices a little to keep the guys rested and caught up with their school­work over this last week, but I think this will work in our favor and that we'll be prepared for Alabama. It would be nice to finish out the first semester with a couple of wins." 
Junior Jeff Henderson will start in goal for the Irish on Friday night, and senior Tim Lukenda will take over in the nets on Saturday. Sophomore left wing Matt Hanzel is out with a knee injury, but other­wise the Irish are healthy for this weekend. 
After taking on the Chargers this weekend, the squad will come back early to prepare for another two game set in North Dakota against the Bisons of North Dakota State. The Bisons are off to the best start in the history of their program and will prove to be a formidable opponent for the Irish. Smith is slightly worried about the lack of preparation time for the se­ries over Christmas break. 
I 
"The squad gets back on Jan-r 
uary 4th, and we play in North Dakota on the 9th," said Smith. "That really only gives us four days of work but if we go twice a day, I think we should be all right. Again, I think it will all boil down to whether or not we can put the puck in the net."
