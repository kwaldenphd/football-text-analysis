today on a referendum asserting their right to hall autonomy as stated in their present hall constitution. The referendum was first suggested Wednesday night after a proposal to declare twenty-four hour parietal hours in the hall ran aground because of a possible conflict in the hall constitution. Section I of the constitution defined the hall to be autonomous, with a right to self­government. Another section, however, requires the hall judicial board to follow the University judicial code. 
Any declaration of twenty-four hour parietals would force the judicial board to enforce adherence to the University parietal guidelines, possibly the principle of hall autonomy. Dave Burch, with other hall residents, proposed an amendment to the 
hall constitution, stating that, "the extent of the enforcement shall be left to the Hall Judicial Board with strict adherence given to the University Judickal presently directed by the con­stitution 
The proposal, Burch said, would "reaffirm the right to self­government as stated in Section I of the Hall Constitution." 
Hall President, Ron Pogge opposed the move, after consultation with the other hall residents. He said that although he agreed with the principle of hall autonomy in the amendment, it was poorly timed. He believed that the amendment should not come before the Board of Trustees meeting in October, out of respect to the Board. 
Burch, speaking for the drafters of the amendment, said that "we see in the amendment a re-affirming of the present hall constitution. Any delay would allow hall autonomy to be treated by the Trustees as a priviJedge granted to the students rather than as a right due to them." 
The referendum voting will be held during the lunch and dinner hours for open discourse in order to establish a better un­derstanding of the students by the Trustees and vice versa. 

In the morning, the Committee will first hear Carl Ellison, head of the Recruitment Action Program, speaking about the condition of minority recruit­ment, the allocation of minority funds, and specific needs of the black student. 
Second on the agenda will be a report by John Drost, Off­Campus Commissioner, who will propose a student center for the off-campus area. 
The morning meetings will be rounded off by members of the Drug Information Center. Tom Tollaksan, John Kwicien and Connie Ormsby will work together to give a preliminary report of the drug situation on campus. This report will serve as a rationale to support their plans for a drug information clinic, and an out -patient clinic on campus employing a professional staff.

Import surcharge to be cut? 
(c) 1971 New York Times 
Washington, Sept. 30--The United States offered today to remove its much-criticized new import surcharge if other leading countries would let their currencies float genuinely freely upward against the dollar and if some of them took "specific" measures in the "coming weeks" to reduce barriers to U.S. ex­ports. 
Secretary of the Treasury John 
B. Connally, Jr., presented this offer to the annual meeting of the international monetary fund as a possibly "more timely and constructive" way of having the surcharge removed than a long and difficult negotiation over specific new currency exchange ··ates, including a possible official dollar devaluation through a small increase in the price of gold. 
Connally said "A change in the gold price is of no economic significance and would be patently a retrogressive step in terms of our objective to reduce, if not eliminate, the role of gold in any new monetary system." European countries have asked for a U.S. devaluation by way of a gold price increase. 
Faced with "difficulites" such as the gold price Connally ~uggested, we should welcome 

cCJhe 
instead "the help that the market itself can provide in reaching crucial decisions." 
Faced with "difficulties" such as the gold price Connally suggested, we should welcome instead "the help that the market itself can provide in reaching crucial decisions." 
At present, most of the main currencies are "floating" against the dollar--changing in value from day to day--but are under various restrictions, including intervention in market trading by foreign central banks to hold back the upward float that the market might produce. 
Connally said: 
"If other governments will make tangible progress toward dismantling specific barriers to trade over coming weeks and will be prepared to allow market realities freely to determine exchange rates for their currencies for a transitional period, we, for our part, would be prepared to remove the sur­charge.. " 
As far as longer term reform of the system, Connally was cautious, but he clearly accepted, by implication, a less central role for the U.'s. dollar. 
For the new system, he said, the development of a "far greater balance of strength"

between the United States the other leading economies compared with 25 years "calls for a different and more symmetrical balance of op­portunities and responsibilities." 
Among other things, he said, the new system must give "adequate exchange rate flexibility" to "all countries"-­apparently his way of saying that, unlike in the past, the United States should have the right, like other countries, to devalue or upvalue the exchange rate of the dollar. 
This position was broadly in line with that taken here by other leading countries this week on the longer term issue of reform. Mor~ than most, however, c;onnally emphasized the need for "a lesser role at least, for gold." 
As for the immediate problem, uppermost in most minds here, Connally said he recognized tnat freely floating exchange rates "will not necessarily over any

to reach the House floor this Fall, a college with 5,000 un­dergraduates would get several thousand dollars from the government to use as it wished. 
The bill would continue the present student financial aid programs for five more years with only minor changes and would prohibit schools that are now coeducational from having admissions policies that discriminate on the basis of sex. 
The S<'nate approved a higher l'ducation bill last month. While the Senate bill also provides for general aid to colleges, the for­mulas for allocating this assistance and also for dispen­sing student financial aid are quite different from the J.<:ducation and Labor Com­mittee's formulas. 
Committee approval is always an important step in the road toward l'nactment of legislation. But the details of Education and Labor Committee bills are not so significant as the provisions of most other Committee's ml'asures.

Elementary anatomy 
IU offers med course here 
An added feature of this year's program at Notre Dame is an anatomy course. It is taught by I>r. ·.John O'Malley, currently a faculty member at the Indiana University School of Medicine. liP formerly taught at Creighton University where he received the t>steem£'d Golden Apple award. 
The addition of the anatomy course enables the ten medical students enrolled to complete their first year studies here, with minor exceptions. Cadavers for the course are 'provided by the 
J.U. School of Medicine and laboratory work is currently housed m the steel strand building behind the Wenninger ­Kirsch Building. 
Dr. Thomas Troeger, center director, pointed out that the present program in no way constitututes a Notre Dame medical school but rather an area health education center fully dependent on the Indiana School of Medicine. 
Dr. Troeger added that the facilities are rented from Notre Dame and the salaries of those involved in the program are financed by the parent in­stitution. 
The procedure for the selection of the medical students, con­trolled by I.U., is the same for the centers as for those who matriculate at the main campus in Indianapolis. After ad­mittance the students are given the option of where they wish to spend their first year. If a matter of numbers do not make the placing possible, the student is usually enrolled at his second choice. 
Dr. Troeger, commenting on the reasons for the establishment of such centers, said that they allow an additional 73 students into the first year studies throughout the state. 
Notre Dame was a logical choice for one of the centers because the courses, such as biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology, were in existence. 
As was the case last year, the program has ten first year students. It is scheduled to ex­pand to 15 next year with an £>ventual goal of 20 to 25 students. 
A future possibility is that the program will be extended such that the students would return to the area centers in their fourth year. which mainly constitutes clinical medicine in their chosen speciality. 
The director went on to state that the centers have pragmatic advantages to the state of In­diana, itself. By distributing the students, many are able to gain £'xposure to areas of the state with dire medical needs, with the hope that they will eventually set up practice in that region. 
Besides the formal course 
structure the medical students 
utilized the facilities of Memorial 
and St. Joseph's Hospitals in 
South Bend. This facet entails 
non-credit courses Saturday 
mornings and visits to the family 
practice clinics. 
In closing, Dr. Troeger discussed the major advantage of the area health center idea. Noting the small number of students involved, he pointed to a more individual treatment in the important first year. 

Students rip off gift packs SB needy must go without 
bags of samples. 
Services Commissioner Jim Schneid said that it was really "tragic" that this program should have such a result. 
The Commission had ordered 1000 extra bags, intending to send the extras to local charities. South Bend's poor had, in the past, "jumped at the idea" of these necessities. 
"It's really comforting to know that the east and west campus students can use the merchandise more than the needy in South Bend," said Schneid, with a touch of sarcasm. 
According to the Security report that Schneid received at 6:45, both ND and SMC students were walking away from the

Coke Bar with boxloads of samples. Jim Sebastian and Tom Flood, who had handled the distribution had closed up at 5. 
There was some question if the Bar had been locked up at 5. Schneid said that someone was to have told the manager to lock it up. Whether this was done or not is still in doubt. 
Two Security officers came on the scene at 6, was the students carrying away the supplies, and asked where they had gotten them. They answered that the Student Union was handing them out. 
In an appeal to their con­sciences, Schneid asked that anyone interested in returning the stolen samples can bring them to Room 4-C, LaFortune. "Identities will be protected," added Schneid. Then the charities would not be disap-. pointed.

In the first place, the amount of money provided for in the House Committee's legislation is usually far more than is finally appropriated. Secondly, the committee's majority is much more liberal than the house as a whole, and its legislation is often changed markedly on the floor. 
The bill approved would base federal grants to colleges partly on the total number of students in each college and partly on the number of students at each school recieving direct federal loans and scholarships. 
Two-thirds of a school's grant would be based on the following formula: $300 for the first 200 students; $200 for the next 100students; and additional $200 for each graduate student; an additional $150 for each junior or senior, and an additional $100 for each freshman or sophmore. 

The other one-third of the school's grant would be based on the amount of money its students recieved in federal scholarships, work-study stipends, National Defense Education Act Loans, and G.I. Bill grants. 
Colleges have recieved federal money for years for construction, research, student aid and other specific purposes. But there have never been grants that could be spent at a school's direction.
