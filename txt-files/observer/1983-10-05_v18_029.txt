Iowa might not be nearly as much fun this time around. 
Four years ago, this normally quiet state played host to a flea market of Presidential hopefuls, each one hoping to usc an Iowa caucus victory to propel him to further primary wins in the eastern states. 
But for 1984, the presidential race already looks more and more: like a two-man show, pitting Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondak. For your average cam­paign watcher, the prospects ofsuch an event threaten to make spring primaries awfully horing. 
Iowa hardly was boring in 1980: 11 candidates for the presidency, and most of them had criss-crossed the state several times heforc the town caucuses in late january. Multiply those 11 by the number of reporters in the average press entourage, and you can get the idea ofthe coverage that the news media gave Iowa for more than a month. 
Since the Iowa caucus was the first "vote" of the 
people, the candidates 
naturally wanted the ex· 
posure, and most of the 
time, they got it. The tradi­
tional methods ofcampaign­
ing (talking to factory workers, shaking hands, etc.) soon lost their normal­ly newsworthy luster, so aspiring candidates turned to more unorthodox stunts to gain attention. 
John Connally visited a cattle show. And George Bush, during a I0-month 

span, spent so much time in Iowa that he joked he should register to vote there. 
What a farce, you say? 
lOWA 
W c:ll, you arc not alone. 
Several columnists decried 
tht· political circus of the Iowa caucuses, calling them insignificant and overhlown. A Neu York Times editorial said the caucuses were "not rt'prescntativc of the electorate as a whole . . and may very well be miskading." 
Because of the nature of the caucuses -straw votes from less than five percent of the voting population ­the results probably were deceiving. But then again, weren't the newsreels ofall those candidates entertain­ing, or at least amusing? There was something peculiar­ly American about them. Where else could so much be made ofso insignificant an event? 
The difference between I980 and I984, however, is that the leading candidates from both parties this year seem to he far ahead of the pack. In I980, Sen. Edward Kennedy was seriously challenging President Jimmy Carter on the Democratic side, while Bush was chip­ping away at Reagan's lead in the GOP camp. 
But this year, with the Iowa caucus less than five

"I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about the: plane, whether they suffered," said Lebow, whose daughter and grand~;on died in the Soviet downing of K\L flight 007 three weeks ago. "We're just tormented." 
Lebow and his wife are not alone. In Seneca, S.C., widow Mickie Burgess is "devastated." In Pelham, N.Y., Pyung Chi Rella wakes with nightmares of her older sister's death. On Bainbridge Island, Wash., Dorothy Irwin "never will adjust" to the loss of her daughter, .1( athy Brown Spier.

Nicaraguan wa1r splits families 
Associated Press 
ON THE SAN JUAN RIVER, Nicaragua -Tadeo dreads the day, which he hopes will never come, that he might sight one of his brothers down the barrel of his rifle and must decide whether to kill him. 
Tadeo, who uses no other name, is an easy-going, 33-year-old guerrilla leader trying to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government. One brother is a lieutenant in the Sandinista army, and another is a leader of a militant Sandinista youth group. 
And ifthat day comes? 
"I would try to talk to him over a loudspeaker if they would let me," said the bearded, brown-eyed dis­trict commander for Eden Pastora's rebel Democratic Revolutionary Al­liance (ARDE) forces at a rebel camp here. 
"I would tell him the war is not between Nicaraguan brothers. It is between true Nicaraguans and the Cubans, Soviets and Bulgarians. If it didn't work, I would carry on as I al­ways have. I only hope it never comes to that. I don't know what he would do," said Tadeo. "It's the story of Nicaragua. There are a lot of families like ours in Nicaragua." 
Family political divisions began before the fall of Dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979, when brother often fought brother in the civil war that took an estimated 50,000 lives. 
"But after the war, at the time of the betrayal, many Sandinista back­ers split again and, for a number of reasons, I suppose, some stayed with the (Sandinista) dictatorship," said ARDE spokesman Orion Pastora, a cousin of!Eden Pastora. 
The "betrayal" refers to ARDE's contention that the revolution strayed from its early goals. 
Sometimes the split has hit high levels. 
"For example, the political ad­viser to the Revolutionary Sandinista Front (Eden Pastora's organization within ARDE) is Carlos Coronel," said Orion Pastora. "His brother is the vice minister in the Nicaraguan Agrarian Reform Institute." 
He said there was no way of knowing if such families kept in touch with each other or tried to change each others' minds. 
"I know of a lot of cases where they have· become sworn enemies but in any particular case, who can say," he said. "It is a very personal subject with them." 
Tadeo and his brothers fought to­gether with Pastora during the 1978-79 war that toppled Somoza 
and  brought  the  Sandinistas  to  
power.  
After  the  war,  Tadeo  said  he  

joined the Sandinista air force but deserted to follow the charismatic Pastora early last year. 
"I'm tolld they sent my brother to Cuba for nine months to train with the infantry and that he is now a lieutenant," said Tadeo, a former cattle rancher from the rolling hills of southern Nicaragua's Contales province. 
He said he has not been able to see his mother, in Managua, for two

years. His wife and children, he said, are in Costa Rica. 
"I talk to my family sometimes through a telephone-radio hookup, but I haven't seen them in many months," he said. 
Tadeo led a series of attacks by ARDE troops on the Nicaraguan military post at El Castillo on the San Juan River that started Sept. I5, his 13th wedding anniversary. He is now in charge of one of Pastora's three military zones along the river. 
"I moved in here a year ago with nine men," he said. "There are 700 of us in this zone now."

Hall lectures on resume, interviews

News Staff 
"It is important for a company to know if you have a brain and leader­ship ability," said Janice Hall, per­sonnel officer at First Source Bank, in a speech to women business majors last night at Saint Mary's Col­lege. 
Hall spoke on job interviews and resumes at a lecture sponsored by the Finance Club. 
Hall dicussed the appropriate types, organization and contents of an effective resume. Her informal presentation permitted students to ask questions concerning the impor­tance of a grade point average and extra-curricular activities. Hall said, This paper (resume) should sell you." 
Relating her past experience with job interviews, Hall advised, "Be real and don't overdo it." 
Hall distributed forms to her audience with 50 questions fre­quently asked by employers during an interview with a college senior. Hall's advice was, "Frame your answers in your employer's terms, not just your own." 
She advised c,areer-oriented women, "The job market is tough; therefore, put your best foot for­ward."

Electroni~cs in Silicon Glen fuel Scotland's industrial revolution 
Associated Press 
GLASGOW. Scotland-A second industrial revolution has >wept through Scotland's central lowlands, planting millions of microchip> in its wake. 
The Scots call it Silicon Glen. From Glasgow to Dundee, more than 270 companies are pumping out a torrent of computers. com­ponents. circuitry and program­ming. In the hard towns c1f the British north. it's badly needed busi­ness. 
A century ago, the first lnd Jstrial Revolution forged Scotland ,nto a powerhouse built on coal, steel and ships. 
But those fields withered in the 1980s recession. Scores of coal mines closed for lack of d t emand. Steel furnaces were banked, the or­ders going to West Germany and Japan. Shipbuilding slumped to its lowest level for decades, and the Clyde and Forth docks fell silent. 
Today, unemployment in Scot­land is 16 percent, more than three points higher than Britain's already high national average. 
But the same resourcefulness that made Scotland a cradle of the first Industrial Revolution has given it a jump on the second. 
Attracted by tax and investment incentives in the late 1950s and ear­ly '60s, electronics giants like IBM,

Motorola, Burroughs, NCR and Hewlett-Packard established plants in Scotland or made it a hub of their 
European marketing effort.  
Today,  there's  hardly  a  major  
electronics  manufacturer  not  
represented in Silicon Glen.  

More than 42.500 people work in microelectronics in the glen, which arches from Ayr on the Irish sea to Glasgow on the Clyde to Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth to Dundee on the Firth ofTay. 
Salaries range f t rom between S7,500 and $9,000 for an unskilled worker on an assembly line, to about S21 ,000 a year for an engineering manager, says the Scottish Develop­ment Agency. That's about one-third 
cheaper than operating in the United States. Most of the new com­panies are non-union, and three­quarters ofthe American firms in the glen are non-union. 
"Microelectronics now employs more than the three traditional in­dustries -shipbuilding, coal and steel-put together," said Emrys In­ker, spokesman for the agency. 
Six major universities funnel graduates and research to the com­panies. The University of Edin­burgh's Wolfson Institute is among the world leaders in microelectronics. 
When Sir Clive Sinclair, the British electronics magnate, introduced his latest brainchild, the Sinclair Mini-
TV, he declared, "I couldn't have done this anywhere else." The 2-inch screen mite, to be produced at Sinclair's Timex manufacturing plant in Dundee, is billed as the world's smallest televi­sion set. It's half the size and half the price of the rival Sony Watchman, in­troduced nine months earlier. Sinclair calls its display tube and microchip circuitry a "major breakthrough ...The chip alone has more patents than any chip in the world." Eventually, the Dundee plant will be making 1 million sets a year. The development agency's lnker says Scotland has another big ad­vantage for manufacturers proximity to the European, and par­ticularly the British, market. 
As a source of consumer spend­ing, the I0-nation European Economic Community now out­ranks the United States. And Britain has more home computers and home videotape recorders per per­
son than any other country in the world, according to Trade Depart­
ment statistics.

Reagan's rhetoric and the United Nations 
Social life not Notre Dame's fault 
P. 0. BoxQ 
Recent rhetoric from the Reagan ad­ministration raises further doubt about the coherence and viability of its foreign policy. Although the initial administration response to the downing ofthe KAL jetliner was surpris­ingly reserved and calm, later comments by 
Michael Skelly 
Back again 
Reagan, Bush, and U.S. delegate to the ll.N. Charles Litchenstein point to the fact that Reagan is formulating foreign policy and rhetoric for domestic political consumption rather than in the long-term interests ofglobal stability. 
The decision by the governors of New York and New jersey to limit Soviet Foreign Minis­ter Andrei Gromyko's landing facilities, and Reagan's apparent acquiescence to this deci­sion raises the question of who is making U.S. foreign policy. By keeping Gromyko from the 
U.N. opening session the United States jeopardized the ability ofthe U.N to act as an essential forum for the discussion of interna­tional issues. It was not the UN. who shot down the jet, and its ne-atrality should not be threatened before it can begin serious discussion ofthis grave incident. 
Litchenstein's off the cuff remark that the UN. should look into moving from 
U.S. soil is short-sighted and unproductive. The administration should be striving to focus world attention on the brutality of the Soviet attack, not engaging in meaningless and coun­terproductive rhetoric. Reagan is unneces­sarily diverting attention from the downing of the jet and failing to capitalize on the Soviet error. Furthermore, off-hand remarks like Litchenstein's should not be the basis for foreign policy positions. Reagan's endorse­ment of Litchenstein's comments indicates the lack of coherent long-range thinking that 
goes into his administration's foreign policy. 
No wonder our allies have difficulty support­
ing us when contentious rhetoric dominates 
so much ofReagan's foreign policy. 
If Reagan is serious about his suggestion 
that the United Nations spend six months a 
year in Moscow "to see two ways of life," he 
should raise the issue after careful considera­
tion, not in simple knee-jerk support for an 
obvious guffaw by Litchenstein. In any event, 
the issue will probably quietly fade away, as 
Reagan failed to raise the it . in his Monday 
address to the U.N. General Assembly. 
Kicking around the U.N. is no doubt good 
for some political gain domestically, and 
relatively inexpensive at that. Regardless of 
one's feelings about the UN., it is clear that 
Reagan's rhetoric is doing nothing to further 
discussion on either the proper role of the 
U.N. or the present deterioration ofEast-West relations. 
Vice President George Bush's saber-rattling speech in Austria is further cause for despair at the poverty of this administration's rhetoric. In it he called on the Soviet Union's East European allies to make a choice "between the West or locking themselves in to societies based on ignorance, backward­ness and poverty." 
Such name-calling ignores the tough and delicate geopolitical realities that these countries face. It can only make it more dif­ficult for these countries over whom the Soviet Union all too menacingly lurks. Bush's speech also hurts those countries currently engaged in delicate economic and political experiments, which could cause improve­ments for the people ofEastern Europe. 
Strong stands are necessary in dealing with the Soviet Union. Name calling and other varieties of meaningless rhetoric, however, are no way to conduct an enlightened foreign policy. They only lead to a confusion of the issues and reduce the likelihood of con­structive dialogue on the urgent issues facing the world today. 
A popular joke about the life here is, "Notre Dame -where men are men, wom<:n arl· scarl'l', and the shet·p arc nl·rvous." 
Soml· studt·nts ft-d thl-social life here kavt·s a little to he desired. Notre Dame is ht·­hind the times. Thne is nothing to do here on Wt'l'kl·nd~ t'Xl'l'pt go to parties and get drunk, 
Michael McClory 
As it is 
gt·t drunk and go to movies, or, of course, JUSt get drunk. Thl·st· arl· daims people make. 
Students want l'Vents, activities -soml·­thing to he entertained hy. No one knows ex­actly what -a howling alley, a theatre, a new swimming pool. I suhmitthat were many or all of the requested improvements made, little about the social life would change. 
Social life has morl· in its constitution than al'livities and places. This problem in social life is deeper than just hl·re at Notre Dame. It spans society; many communities are finding tlu·msel\-es bored with cirl·umstance. 
The most important concept to be dis­cussed is the constitution of social life. If it is not activities and places which make for suc­cessful social life, what is it? The largest com­ponent is communication. There is not enough communication today to maintain the social life which people long for. 
Society today specializes in saying nothing. The: tour de force of saying nothing is the slogan. People today are slogan happy. "Think mink." "The real thing." "4 out of 5 dentists surveyed." 
The: facts, the significant data, receive little or no attention. People stare at television sets while some epicene man admonishes them, "Don't squeeze the Charmin." People used to pay no attention to someone who peddled two-ply tissue, but today he is listened to. Charmin is the top selling toilet tissue. The slogan has replaced communication. 
When slogan dominates, the expression of multiple thoughts is difficult. Having fewer ideas exchanged causes a migration of at­titude to the center. It breaks down the diver­sity in people and gives rise to the status symbol. 
People at Notre Dame probably have a dif­ficult time understanding this term, but it is quite simple. People buy the same items, dress the same way, use the same toilet tissue. 
In this is the root of the problem, the ex­pl;mation for declining social life, for the lack ofcommunication. A non-diverse people, one that is centric by nature, is afraid to commun­icate. 
It holds the slogan up as the standard be­cause it is safe. Talk becomes banal. People desire real communication, but security is precious. There is security in the slogan, in the center. 
Today's society relies on technology; tomorrow's will rely just that much more on it. People become soft because of this depen­dency. The conventions of yesterday are of less importance as we become more automated. 
'The direction this technology has turned society is not good. It could have provided more time for better communication, but it has instead led to a unique phenomena ­vicarious living. People today are weak, con­tent to live their lives through the lives of the select few individuals who move away from the center. 
People worship heroes and antiheroes. The hero worship is obvious -the muscician, the athlete, the comedian. People, however, also worship antiheroes just as much. A typical set of headlines on the evening news may be this: "Tonight's top stories -nurse beheaded in Satanic ritual, man wearing leotards leaps to death offofcity hall building, woman kills her son and impales selfon machete...." 
In a gut way, people feel real excitement because of these antiheroes. It may seem ter­rible, but the feeling is that these freaks are living more . This is not healthy. 
To recognize a social life problem at Notre Dame is commendable. To blame the school is ridiculous. The problem is much larger ­society wide. The answer is not to seek out a goat and place blame. The answer is to admit the depth of the problem and to begin to change it in your own little corner of exist­ence. 
Irish fan? 
Deur Editor: 
Pat Haden said on National TV last Saturday that whl·n he asked Blair Kid about fan critidsm afier the Michigan State game. Blair said that he, "couldn't let that bother him" since he was out there just to huve some fun. llave some fun? lie's g<:tting thousands ofdol­lars in free education to play football, and he's there to have some fun? What a disgrace to 
Notr<: Dame pride and tradition! 
But it's hardly all Kiel's fault. Gerry Faust 
and his staff have nurtured and fed his ego for 
four yl·ars, so why should we expect anything 
elsl'? 
In over 40 yt·ars of rooting for the Irish, I have ntver been as ashamed of a Notre Dame football team as I was that night. They were totally unprepared, playing with a sub­standard quarterback, using a pathetic assort­ment ofplays being sent from the bench. 
If your fine newspaper and student body don't start demanding and getting some changes made then I think ND football fans should boycott the games. I, for one, will do just that.

Miss Manners 
Prorrtiscuous coddlers beware 
by Judith Martin 
Y
ou there, all you wonderful, warm, cuddlyspreadersofhappi­ness who advocate, and practice, hugging everybody in sight, whetheryou knowthem or not, just to make a connectionfrom one human being to another-Miss Manners has a small request for you. 
Please keep your hands to yourselfor she will call the police. 
Poor Miss Manners realizes that this is an unsympathetic position, seeming, as it does, to favor frigidity, and aloofness. Etiquette already suffers from the widespread idea that its opposite is warmth. No­thing could be further fromt the truth: It is possible to be warm and have good manners, but very difficult to be warm, in its kindest sense, and rude. 
And well-meaningornot, inflictingintimacyon people who don't 
want it is unspeal<ably rud(, not to mention contemptuous oftheir 
feelings. 
When Miss Manners was a slip ofan innocent girl, there was a 
popular argument among adolescent boys to the effect that anyone 
not always agreeable to be~;towing her affections on whoever asked 
-or at least on the boy m~iking the argument -was seriously 
damaged in the psychological department. Should the la:iy indeed 
prove psychologically sound, she would discover, after the fact, that 
the same gentleman believed that generous affection was not the 
kind ofhealthy quality he <onsidered suitable in a wife. 
It was not a nice era in which to be a trusting girl, and Miss Man­
ners had thought we had seen the last ofit. But now we have various 
mental health propagandists advocating promiscuity in social hug­
ging, with the same argument. 
The case, typically put by a psychotherapist who was recently fired for hugging patients, colleagues, other employees ofa hospital and everyone else who walked in the door, is that this shows a caring nature, similar to that exhibited by happy families in which hugging is a frequent ritual. 
One must then come oul: either for or against hugging. Miss Man­ners hates to be troublesome, but she finds herselfunable to take either position. Ifshe believes in the benefits ofthe family hug, or those ofcertain people she prefers not to name, does that mean she also has to accept the hugs ofporcupines, masked men in alleys and other proponents ofjoy anx:ious to enrich her life? 
Social kissing is ridiculous enough these days, but at least it takes place among people who have agreed to socialize with one another and does not pretend to b( a boon to humanity. And for that matter, unrequested therapy has reached silly proportions,_ and Miss Man­ners often hears from people who have grown weary oftheir ac­quaintances asking what the matter is and offering advice -when the only thing the matter is that their faces have relaxed momentari­ly from the smiling position. 
It is precisely thisemotionalcontent that makes the gesture objec­tionable to many people. Hugging need not, in a conventional context, be more than an expression of mere sociability, not much more intimate than a handl;hake. There are some families and cultures that use the hug au a standard greeting between friends ­making it a form one cannot reject without the apparent intent to repulse. In no culture, however, are respectable, free people ex­pected to accept the embraces ofstrangers. 
The type ofhugging Mis:; Manners isdiscussingis intended to con­vey, "It doesn't matter who you are -I love and accept everyone," which at best is not particularly flattering. It also precludes the recipient's conveying that it does matter to him whose touch he receives, and leaves him sc~arching for a not-so-warm gesture that conveys, "You cut that oul this minute, or else." 
DearMiss Manners An ex-lover has been calling my house after midnight almost every night for the last three months. He neversays anything, just hangs up assoonas Isay hello. I know that he willdeny responsibility ifI confront him directly, and my roommates do not wish to change the telephone number. Can you suggest away to per­suade him to stop these a11noying phone calls? 
Gentle Reader Certainly. Invite your brother, or somebody else's trusted brother, for a midnight snack. Have him pick up the telephone and say as iftailing to you but so the caller can hear, "It's jeremy! Nowwill you give me his address so I can go overand show him what I think ofthis?" Alternatively, answer the telephone your­seU: not by saying "Hello, "but by whispering breathily, "Samuel, darling!" one night, "Kurt, darling!" the next, and so on -anything but the caller's name. 
Ifit is not your ex-lover calling, but your mother who wanted to check that you were safely in but didn't want to seem to be afteryou, you will be in big trouble. 
DearMiss Manners Rec:ently, I attended a luncheon at a friend's home. I had just taken my place at the table when I noticed, much to my amazement, that the hostess had lighted tapers on the table. I was appalled. 
Not wanting to make an issue ofit, I said nothing. How may I in­
form the hostess ofher error without causing embarrassment? I fear 
ifl don't tell her, she miglitt commit the ghastly usurpation again. 
Gentle Reader You have already done the correct thing. It is true that etiquette require:; one to refrain from the daytime lighting of a single candle, but it also forbids one to curse the behavior of those who are in the dark about the rule of waiting for tb~darkness....,; 
Feeling incorrect? Address your etiquette quistions (in black or blue-black ink on white writing paper) to Miss Manners. in care of this newspaper.

)o Beth Williams as Karen, an unhap­
py, suburban housewife. 
Most ofthe film deals with the ex­change ofthoughts and ideas that take place when the friends are to­gether. The nine Univ~rsity ofMichi­gan graduates talk about who they've become since their last COlll­tact with one another. The question arises as to whether they have truly lived up to the ideals they fought for in the 60s. Most ofthem, ironically, have ended up in "The Establish­ment" that tht~y once fought agains~. 
The characters say that they find themselves doing things they never thought they would be doing in their respective careers. Miehael, for instance, who had always had a con­cern for good journalism, finds him­selfwriting for a gossip magazine. Many ofthe characters agree also that they wert! "at their best" when they were together at school. They all feel that thc:irstandardsand ideals have faltered ~;omewhat since their college years. 
At times, "The Big Chill" has a lot to say about how people and times change. It is alt these times that "The Big Chill" is impressively realistic and it is easy to identify with the character's feelings. At other times, "Chill," presents the characters as complacent, stoic, and proclaiming 
a "Well, that's life" attitude. 
The characters are confused, they never really make up their minds as to whether they went the right way or not. Unfortunately, this confusion dampens "The Big Chill." What it is trying to say is often obscured by its mixture ofattitudes toward itself. 
Thus, "The Big Chill" is sometimes a made for television comedy and, at other times, a melodramatic comment on life. It is this confusion which leaves the audience with nothing truly con­crete to take home. "The Big Chill" tries too hard to be something it never becomes. The characters seem to come to the conclusion, "that's the way it is." Perhaps ifthe characters and the film could have tried a little harder, it wouldn't have to be "the way it is." 

A tale of a dieter's woes 
by Marc RamirE~z 
feature..t~ columnist 
Rollover, Edgar. 
Seat yourseU: my friend; Fate has been kind enough to allow me to tell you my story, mirabile dictu ifever there was. 
It was only by chance that I hap­pened to request ofmy friend)ohn, the opportunity to perhaps accom­pany him on the next occasion on which he undertook the activity of weightlifting. 
To which he quite amiably replied, "Sure, oldfriend. Howabout Tuesday next?" 
This proposition was acceptable to my person, and thus I agreed wholeheartedly. 
Tuesday next found my friend in good spirits. We met on the third floor ofthe building in which we lived It was a magnificent structure, grand in its antiquity, its interior an infinite series ofhallways and cor­ridors. This building we had in­habited for a period ofmore than two years, and we shared the residence with 160 other fools of this earth. 
We made our way outside and traversed the Notre Dame campus, finally reaching our destination, the · Rockne Memorial. 
"Our purpose is that ofgetting you into shape, dear pal," said my friend 
I thought the term "our" to be somewhat odd in this instance, but said nothing. We entered the build­ing and set about our task ofgetting me in shape. 
Every dar,,~ereafter for several days, my friend and I would make our way to the Rock to stretch and strain and sweat for 90 minutes. 
On these occasions, I noticed cer­
tain exchanges between my friend and the courtly gentleman at the entrance, though the two attempted 
to conceal thdr communication. They gave th~ appearance ofregard­ing me with (:onsiderable interest, and found it quite difficult to hide 
their mutual yet unexplainable sentiments olf joy the eve on which I announced that nine pounds had been lost from my material person. 
The following morning as I sat down to my breakfast meal, I was joined by Kathy, a fair lady equalled in beauty by no maiden. She was a heaverrly vision -an opium dream -and she made known her presence by seizing the doughnut which I had intended to devour upon complc:tion ofmy scrambled eggs. "No! You must not, dear sir!" the fair lady cried, whereupon she stabbed the helpless doughnut repeatedly until it was nothing more than a heap ofdough. 
I sat in wonder, and looked to her for an explanation. "So," said ~he, "nine pounds you have cast away, have you?" 
"While this may be true," said I, "I observe no reason that you should attack my br~akfast. I shall procure another dou1~ut, dear woman." 
I departed from the table and has­tened to the serving area. Then amazement took hold ofme as I wondered how the lady Kathy had known ofmy weight loss. A certain sensationofJ[>aranoia seized me in an instant and was gone. 
I reached for a doughnut but 
found nothing in my grasp. The 
woman behiind the counter had 
removed every pastry from its plate! 
My eyes ple;lded but I was stared 
down. Can i1t be, I thought to myself, 
that all are against me? 
I made my way toward the hot breakfast queue, and awaited my tum. "I will have the hash browns," I declared to the young maiden who was serving. 
"Verily I say unto thee," said she, "you will not have the hash browns." Her countenance was cruel and accusing, and I found myselfshaken, and took flight. 
I pushed my way out ofthe dreaded dining hall, aching for the safety ofmy own room. As I reached my dormitory, four residents were leaving the premises and com­mented on my weight loss, promis­ing that Fate would not be kind ifI regained a single pound. 
"What, have Igone mad?" I said to 
myselfas I ascended the stairs. An 
idea flashed through my mind and I 
hastened to a room inhabited by the 
eminent Mark Huber, who was 
known to keep a ready supply of 
consumables on hand in his room. 
On his door I found this poem, 
addressed to me: 
There comes a time to abandon those 
pleasuressuch as Domino's. 
Little shallyou have in store 
When the belly shallgrowl, but eat no more. 
Alas, so it was true! My fellow man 
had turned against me! Fever rushed 
to my head and flooded my being. I 
had to get out ofthat wicked place, 
to depart from this decadence. I ran 
through the hallways and corridors 
until I was free, away from them all; I 
feared I had gone insane. 
But, my friend, I am here with you 
today, driven out ofmy own dorm, 
and I tell you my s~ory so that you 
will know this: eat, drink, and be 
merry, for tomorrow you may find 
yourselfin an unadvertised weight 
loss program. 
And you ask, will I ever overeat 
again? 
Nevermore!

what its major meaning is, it still sounds like the players are telling the students to drop dead. If the team is not going to play for Notre Dame (the student body is r.·otre Dame), then it's going to be very hard to go ·out and cheer on the team. Why not say, "We're just going to play our own way?" 
The other comment came last year over fall break. The head coach was quoted as saying that the stu­dents were a bad influence on the team. Now, what he was quoted as saying and what he actually said are probably not the same thing (the press tends to diston newswo nhy quotes), but all the students know is 
that someone connected with the team was being undiplomatic and said some negative things about their relationship with the team. 
Ofcourse, losing much more than usual does not help the matter. But, maybe the bad relationship between the team and the students has played a part in the losing. The team has to want to win for itself, but it also has to want to win for the school. Not for the people who demand that they win, but for Notre Dame itself. 
Some making up has to be done before it's too late. The football team has to realize that the students, despite what they say, do care about how the team does. The students have to realize how imponant the team is to the name of Notre Dame. Both pans of Notre Dame football have to work together. 
The team needs the students and the students need the team. Football isn't everything, and shouldn't be. However, nobody can deny that, so­cially, football is extremely impor­tant. 
So, how about a little diplomacy on both sides? If the close bond be­tween the students and the team is allowed to disintegrate, which I honestly do not think will happen, everyone can stop thinking hopeful­ly about bowl games and national championships. They just won't mean that much anymore.

The Ticket Office has mailed the 1983-84 m':n's basketball student applications. If you have not res­ceived your application as of today, you should go to the Ticket Office on the second floor of the ACC by Friday, October 7 and pick an appia­tion up. 
The applications and remittance made pay_ablle to the University of Notre Dame should be presented on a specified day in return for the season tickets. The distribution schedule is as follows: seniors on Monday, October 10, juniors on Tuesday, O<:tober 11, sophomores on Wednesday October 12, and freshman on Thursday, October 13. All tickets will be distributed at Gate 3 of the ACC from 8:00 am. to 5:00 p.m.

Phillies drew their infield in but the four-time Cy Young Award winner made that unnecessary, forcing Baker to pop up in front ofthe plate. Three Phillks surrounded the ball but it was Carlton who caught it. 
That brought up the Dodgers' cleanup hitt<:r, Pedro Guerrero, who led the team with 1 0 3 runs batted in. Carlton worked carefully and, with the count 3-2, he walked Guerrero, barely missing a called third strike. 
Young Mike Marshall was next 
and he was !limply overmatched. He 
fouled off the first two pitches and 
then swung and missed at strike 
three, leaving the runners stranded.

tickets available to students. Therefore, strict adherence to the distribution schedule will be en­forced. If you did not pick up your ticket following the schedule, you should go to Gate 3 on Friday and purchase tickets ifthere are any still available. 
A students picking up tickets for friends may only present four ID's. 
This year's package includes tick­ets for 15 of the 18 scheduled home games. Three games (St. Joseph's, Marist, and Valparaiso) fall during student holidays. The games are not split into two packages as previously done. There is only one package. 
Married students should report to Gate 3 with their respective classes. You should also bring evidence of your marital status (marriage license for example). 
StMary's students will obtain tick­ets through the St. Mary's Student Union.

punched his third hit. After Russell popped up, Baker dropped a single to right, sending Sax to third. 
Now, it was Guerrero's turn again and, again, Carlton walked the Dodgers slugger. That brought up Marshall and Phillies Manager Paul 
Owens went to the ace of his bul­lpen, Holland. 
The left-bander, who saved Carlton's 300th career victory, got Marshall into a 1-2 hole and then retired him on a line drive to right. 
Holland put out a threat in the ninth, after Derrel Thomas got on through Schmidt's two-out error and stole second, by getting Greg Brock to ground out. Reuss' only mistake came on a 1-1 pitch to Schmidt in the first inning. The slug­ger, who led the majors in home runs for the sixth time in his career with 40 this season, sent a shot over the 395-foot sign in left-center field. It was one ofjust five hits the Phillies got off Reuss in eighth innings 
before Tom Niedenfuer 
ninth. 
The victory was only the second all season for Philadelphia against the Dodgers. LA won 11 of the 12 regular season contests, beating Carlton twice. 
Game 2 in the best-of-five series will be played Wednesday night with 19-game winner John Denny going, for the Phillies against Fer­nando Valenzuela, 15-10.

Lineups set for AL game today 
ByJOHN NELSON 
Associated Press 
Dan Ford, Baltimore's hobbling 
ri~ht fielder, was the only question 
mark yesterday as the managers an· 
nounced their lineups for the first 
~arne of the 19H3 American League 
Championship Series between the 
Orioles and the Chicago White Sox. 
Orioles ManagerJoe Altobelli said 
Ford, if healthy, would start today's 
first game of the best-of-five series, 
despite being a right-handed hitter 
facin~ Chicago's LaMarr Hoyt, also a 
right-hander. 
"Ford was our re~ular outfielder 
durin~ the last part of the season,"

Stipanovich signs with the Pacers and joins team in West Lafayette 
By Steve Hennan 
AssociatedPress 
Steve Stipanovich, the second player chosen in this year's National Basketball Association college draft, signed a multi-year contract yester· day with the Indiana Pacers. 
The 7-foot rookie from the Uni· 
versity of Missouri was to report to 
the Pacers' training camp last night 
at Purdue.Univrrsity's Mackey Arena 
in West Lafayette. 
"I'm delightrd to be here, finally;" Stipanovich told reporters at an af. ternoon news conference in In· dianapolis, referring to the lengthy contract negotiations that caused him to miss the first. four days of practice. "This morning I signed a multi-year contract, and I'm very, very t happy with it." 
The terms of the pact were not disclosed. 
George Irvine, Pacer vice presi· dent of basketball operations, said  Stipanovich is expected to join the front line with 6-1 I Herb Williams, who will bt· switched from center to forward for his third season in the NRA, and 6-7 Clark Kellogg, the team's Ieadin~ scorer la~t year as a rookie. 
"That's the kind of front line that will be with us for a long time," , Irvine said. "That's the reason we drafted him (Stipanovich), and that's 
the rea~on we're paying him a lot of dollars. The: coaches are more than · anxious to get him in practice ses-. sions." 
Stipanovich, who averaged 18.4 points and nearly nine rebounds a game for Missouri last year, said the delay in reporting to training camp "obviously" will hurt his develop· ment "to a certain extent." 
"I don't know how much. When you play by yourself or in a pickup game, it's just not the same. I think 
I'll  be  a  little  behind,  but  I'll  be  
ready."  
The  Pacers'  first  of  eight  

scheduled exhibition games will be on Saturday against the Detroit Pis· tons at Notre Dame's Athletic and Convocation Center. 
"I realize the NBA will be a lot dif· ferent from what I'm used to," Stipanovich said. "But I'll be learning every day and taking one day at a time. It's an opportunity I'm looking forward to. Being the second playrr in the draft puts a lot of pressure on first, followed by Ford or Dwyer; Cal Ripken,Jr., shortstop; Eddie Murray, first base;John Lowenstein, left field; Ken Singleton, designated hitter; Rich Dauer, second base; Todd Cruz, third base, and Rick Dempsey, catcher. Left-bander Scott McGregor, 18·7 with a 3.18 earned run average, will be the Orioles' opening-game pitcher. 
White Sox Manager Tony LaRussa announced a starting lineup of: Rudy Law, center field; Carlton Fisk, catcher; Tom Paciorek, first base; Greg Lozinski, DH; Ron Kittle, left field; Harold Baines, right field; Vance Law, third base; Scott Fletcher, shortstop, and Julio Cruz, second base. Hoyt, the major leagues' winningest pitcher at 24-10 with a 3.66 ERA, was LaRussa's pick to start Game One. 
The Orioles won the season series 7-5 after t winning five of the two teams' first six meetings. Three of each of the club's victories was by one run. McGregor had a 1-0 record against the White Sox; Hoyt was 2-1 against Baltimore.

LaRussa said that because of the 
teams' familiarity with each other, 
the outcome would rest with 
"execution." 
"There aren't going to be a lot of tricks. They have a lot of plays on bunts and with men on base, but you're not going to see anybody picked off in this series," he added. 
The'Orioles won their seventh AL east title this year since divisional ;Jlay was instituted in 1969, while the White Sox haven't won anything since claiming the AL pennant in 1959. Thus, the importance of ex· 
perience is a key issue in this series. 
LaRussa, who celebrated his 39th birthday yesterday said he wouldn't downplay the importance of ex· perience, but added, "I can't go into this with any negative thoughts. 
"Experience is a benefit. I never underestimate it, except to say that we have some guys with experience. As a team, they have more ex· perience, but that didn't bother us in the pennant race."

Schmidt's first-inning homerun is enough for the Phillies to win 
Though the gap between students and players isn't apparent in this picture taken before last year's Purdue game, Sports Editor Mike Sullivan 
Observer Photo/Pc=tc Laches 
thinks that the separation is not only existent, it bas grown. For a more detailed account of the issue, see hiss column below. 
By HAL BOCK 
AssociatedPress 
Mike Schmidt hammered a first­inning home run and Steve Carlton made the single run stand up, with late-inning help from AI Holland, pitching the Philadelphia Phillies to a 1-0 victory over the los Angeles Dodgers in last night's openinggame of the National league Champion­ship Series. 
Carlton, baseball's all-time strikeout king, hurled a masterful game into the eighth inning, outduelingJerry Reuss in a battle of southpaws before a DodgerStadium crowd of49,963. 
Schmidt provided him with an 
early run, smashinga two-out homer 
in the first inning against Reuss, who 
has been the Phillie slugger's 
favorite target over the years. It was 
the 1Oth time Schmidt has con­
nected against the Dodger left­
bander in his career and no pitcher 
has surrendered more homers to 
him. 
It was to be the only run the Nl east champions would get this night but it was enough for Carlton, the crafty 38-year-old left-bander who won the 300th game of his career Sept. 23. 
He worked through a jam in the sixth inning and then got help from Holland when the Dodgers loaded the base t s in the eighth. 
Steve Sax opened the sixth with his second of three singles in the game. Carlton had picked him off base the first time he reached and Sax was more careful this time, advancing to second on a sacrifice by Bill Russell. 
Then Carlton made one ofhis few mistakes all night, uncorking a wild pitch on his first delivery to Dusty Baker. Sax advanced to third and came halfway home before rulling up. 
Now Carlton was in trouble. The

Irish seek consistency against Gamecocks 

Irish Items 

Hello again, everybody! 
Charlie Brown once said "Win -have you ever noticed what a beautiful word that is?", but it could just as easily have been Gerry Faust. Faust, the players, and the fans had to be pleased with the consistent performance turned in by the Irish in Colorado, after two dismal showings in previous weeks. Now the key for the Irish is to find that consistency on a weekly basis. 
A good time to start would be Saturday night when the Irish meet the high-flying Gamecocks of South Carolina. The Gamecocks proved they are capable of a major upset last weekend when they shellacked Southern Cal 38-14. They would love to make it two in a row by beating the Irish in Columbia. 
The Last Time ...The Irish and South Carolina have not met 
since 1979, but fans ofboth teams should have memories ofthat one. 
The Gamecocks came to South Bend looking to pull off the upset, 
and things appeared to be leaning that way as the Irish trailed I 7-I 0 
with 1:36 left on the clock. Rusty tisch took matters into his own 
hands at that point, driving the Irish 80 yards in 54 seconds, 
culminating the march with a 14-yard touchdown toss to Dean 
Masztak. Still trailing by a point, Notre Dame went for the two-point 
conversion. Usch connected with sure-handed Pete Holohan to give 
the Irish another come-from-behind victory. 
Frosh Fit in Fine .. .It's not unusual for one or two freshmen to 
make an impact on a team, but when four come through in the same 
game, it has to raise some eyebrows. While most fans are already 
familiar with last Saturday's contributions from Steve Beuerlein and 
Hiawatha Frandsco, there were some fine frosh performances on 
the other side ofthe line. Defensive tackle Mike Griffin, filling in for the ailingJon Autry at the nose tackle spot, tied for the team lead in tackles with seven, while Steve lawrence (without Eydie Gorme) filled in admirably for the injured JoeJohnson at strong safety. 
Gamecock Droppings ...South Carolina went out and hired for­mer New York Giant greatJoe Morrison following last year's dismal 4-7 record, and the former New Mexico mentor seems to have evaluated this club's talent well. The Gamecocks run the option (an old Irish nemesis) out of the veer offense, and they have a pair of backs who can run it well in sophomores Thomas Dendy and Kent Hagood. Dendy is well on his way to shattering all ofGeorge Rogers' rushing records at South Carolina, and his breakaway speed must be contained. Hagood is a bruisingfullback who can get the Gamecocks two or three yards when they need them. Another sophomore, quar­terback Allen Mitchell, has raised himselffrom the fourth spot on the depth chart to a starting role, and he also likes to run with the foot­ball. The holes have been there for the Carolina running backs, thanks largely to a massive line led by 6-6, 295-pound right tackle Rusty Russell. The one problem the Gamecocks have is an im­
How about a little diplomacy? 
There's trouble brewing in that little football hot spot known as Notre Dame. 
It seems that the unity of team and school has 
deteriorated a lot during the last few weeks as the stu­
dents talk (just talk) about losing imerest and con­
fidence in the team, and the team talks about "playing 
for just ourselves." 
This is not a good situation, to say the least. Even 
though the gap between the students and team is still 
very small, there shouldn't he a gap at all. Once a gap 
appears, there is the possibility that the gap will get big­
ger. Notre Dame Football as we know it will cease to 
exist if the gap continues to widen. 
What gap is there and why is it there? 
let's look back and see what Notre Dame Football has 
meant in the past. After all, everyone always seems to 
want to look to the past when complaining about the 
present teams. 
The Notre Dame students and the team were one unit that had two parts. The team did what it could on the field, while the students did what they could off the field. No matter what the team's fortunes, this set up continued uninterrupted. The players and the students knew their jobs and went about doing them. That is why tt·ams hated to visit South Bend. They had to play thousands of united students. 
This should not be new to anyone. However, visiting Notre Dame is no longer as tough as it once was. The reason: neither side is doing the job it is supposed to do. Student body and team arc no longer one unit. Each side is now taking irresponsible swipes at the other. 
The student body is facing a big test and, right now, it is failing. It's starting to separate itself from the football team when the team needs its help more than ever. When the team is playing well, the students like to say "we" arc playing well, but when the team is doing poor­ly, "the football team" stinks. It seems that everyone forgets that it is the Notre Dame football team. Sometimes the team makes it hard, but that's the price you pay in an alliance. 

Mike Sullivan 
Sports Editor 
I'm not saying that the student body does not have 
the right to be upset with the team, but any criticism has 
to be responsible -constructive criticism. What good 
do "Oust Faust" banners and slogans do? They just make 
a bad situation worse. It's hard, but the students' and the 
players' job is to channell their emotions toward the 
opponent and not toward Notre Dame. 
However, the students do not deserve all the blame 
for the breaking ofthe alliance. The team -the players 
and coaches-deserve an equal amount ofthe blame. 
They don't deserve the blame because they are losing 
games, though. They deserve blame for trying to 
alienate themselves from the students, because, when 
the students get the impression that the players do not 
want to hold up their end of the alliance, they will not 
hold up the other end. That's what is beginning to hap­
pen now. 
The things that are giving the impression that the 
team is disassociating itself from the student body are 
some of the comments from players and coaches over 
the last two years. 
The phrase that is causing the biggest commotion, "We decided to play for just ourselves," is probably the most popular team quote now. It is a quote that has been misunderstood by the students. The players are right in saying that they have to play their own game and not listen to the criticisms of the uninformed. In this sense, the comment seems reasonable. 
But, whether it's misunderstood or not, listen to the comment. Think about how bad it sounds. No matter

poverished passing game. The Irish should be able to key on the run, 
but when three people carry the ball frequently, it can pose a 
problem. 
On defense, South Carolina has shown it is tough against the run. last week they allowed USC only 49 yard'> on 4 I attempts on the ground. Ifyou run to the right side, you will more than likely run into 6-2, 296-pound tackle Ricky Hagood. If you get by Hagood, the Gamecocks have a fine linebacking corps spearheaded by seniors Mike Durrah ( 83 stops) andj.D. Fuller(56 tackles). The weak spot of the Gamecock defense is the secondary, where inexperience reigns. 
Carolina's special teams are sound, as All-American Mark Fleet­wood handles the place-kicking duties, and senior Chris Norman takes care of the punting chores. Fleetwood missed only once in I 8 tries last year, and has kicked a 58-yard field goal. Norman owns a career average of over 40 yards a punt, and he can really skyrocket the ball. 
Irish Eyes Can Smile Again ...last Saturday, the Irish running attack found some holes in the Colorado line that Orson Welles could have run through. The line did a superb job, annhilating the smaller Colorado team. However, South Carolina is a team with com­parable size to the Irish, and they have shown a tendency to stop the running game. Nevertheless, look for offensive coordinator Ron Hudson to stick with the running attack. One should also look for freshman quarterback Steve Beuerlein to put the ball in the air more this week, now that he has a game under his belt. There is no need to scold the defense for a lack ofa pass rush this week. The t Irish defense only recorded three sacks, but more importantly, they con­stantly chased the Colorado quarterback out of the pocket. The key this week will be to maintain the rushing defense which has only given up 98.7 yards a game. If the Irish can stop the option 
(something that Notre Dame teams have not done .with great success in the past), it should be a pleasant evening for the Irish in Dixie. 
Pick ofthe Week ...This week's pick features a sport I admitted­ly don't know much about-field hockey. CoachJan Galen Bishop's team has compiled a nifty 6-3-I record this season, and will return home Saturday morning for a 9:30a.m. contest with the Billikens of St. Louis at Alumni Field. 
While I don't know much about the rules, Ido know the Irish have some fine talent in high-scoring Clare Henry, talented midfielders Janet Hlavin andJoan (Jetsi) Totten, and sophomore goalkeeper Pat­ti Gallagher. This team is the Rodney Dangerfield of Notre Dame sports (they just get no respect from the students), but the gals work hard and deserve your.

Scholastic: Quality improving? 
It's out. 
Scholastic, the monthly student magazine of Notre 
Dame and Saint Mary's hit the streets last Friday. 
Reactions to the magazine's first issue, however, were mixed. While some praised its quality by calling it a "fine example of journalistic talt'nt," others accused Scholastic of ingratiating itself to students and faculty mt'mbers. One student t'Ven compared the issue to a "had high school newspapcr." 
Such conflicting comments may he common for any college publication. hut Jim Ganther, Scholastic's cditor-in-chit:f. doesn't take such reader ft'edback light­ly. "Scholastic has made a quantum leap in the last five ~'Cars," he says. Ganther recalls the late 1970s when the magazine ran only 16 pages pcr issuc, a downturn whkh even prompted a Notre Dame administrator to suggcst Sc'holastic ccasc publishing. But under Chuck Wood, editor-in· chief from 19HO to I<)82, 
S£·holastic enjoyed a rebirth Ganther also believes the -it no longt'r attempted to advisory council will have compcte with The Ohsen>er much impact on this year's

Bcth Hcaky Prcuss, last ycar's editor-in-chid, was not as ccstatically rccein:d by administrators as was Wood. One administrator rcmarked that Wood's high litcrary standards may have "spoilcd" Scholastic n·aders, and said the magazine under Preuss failcd w reach the literary standards of Wood. Preuss, now working for Notre Dame's University Press, disagrces. 
Scholastic began paying its cditors and doing its own layout for the first time last year, said Preuss. According to Preuss, quality at the magazine n:mained high while students became more involved in thc production of the magazinc. 
Such a changc in the financial policy of the magazinc promptcd University administrators to become "ridiculous" about finances, according to Preuss. Even with the ncw salaries, Scholastic was ahle to save the University ovcr $1,000 through revamped advertising

But more important than saving money, Preuss was ablt' to bring together faculty, students, and ad­ministrators. Scholastic editors met with four faculty members and onc administrator each semester to help the students assess cditorial policics, she says. 
Preuss hopcd such a advisory committee would help overcome thc two greatest handicaps of any student­run organization: students who will not "admit to their own ignorance," and faculty members "who won't

.tides" on a spccific topic. 
But ifthc editorial policics of Wood and Preuss mean anything, Ganther's new philosophy of makingScholas· tic into a general interest magazine free of t!lematic guidelines may create many difficulties for the magazine. 
Wood and Preuss knew Scholastic's purpose: was to offer a publication through which students and faculty members could comment on complicated issues. And two or three articles just don't seem to be enough.

Toxic dutnps ,violate pertnits 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Congressional investigators reported yesterday. that 7H percent of the hazardous waste dumps they checked this' sum­mer were violating their federal per­mits by not monitoring for possible leaks of toxic chemicals into drink­ing water supplies. 
Two influential congressmen said they were "shocked," and vowed to ask the House to provide for criminal prosecution of dump operators who deliberately ignore health safeguards imposed by federal law. 
The sample survey of state pollu­tion officials in North Carolina and Illinois was conducted by the General Accounting Office, the in­vestigative arm of Congress, which found that 78 percent of the dumps operating under so-called "interim status pernits" were not checking for groundwater pollution, as re­quired. In Illinois, the GAO said, 33 of 38 sites were not meeting re­quirements, and in North Carolina, 
18 of27 sites were not complying. In two other states surveyed, the GAO said, Massachusetts and 
California state officials did not know how many sites were in com­pliance because few had been checked. 
The GAO said underground water pollution "is the most serious poten­tial threat to human health and the environment posed by the disposal of hazardous waste." An estimated I,350 sites nationwide are subject to the groundwater monitoring re­quirement. 
In addition, the GAO said, neither the Environmental Protection Agency, which issues the permits, nor state officials are making sure dump operators are complying with financial requirements intended to ensure that dumps can be safely closed whe·n full and then main­tained, and that adequate insurance against accidents has been obtained. 
The GAO study was released by Rep. james Florio, D-N.j., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee with jurisdiction over hazardous wastes, and Rep. Norman F. Lent of New York, the panel's senior Republican. 
Florio said that even the minimal health prec:tutions required by the interim permits were not being carried out. The interim permits are supposed to be temporary. pending more comprehensive permanent licensing, and cover nearly all legal dump sites in the country. 
The GAO said through July l<JH3, 24 of an estimated H,OOO facilities expected to require permits had received their permanent licenses, and the process of li<:ensing the rest could take another I 0 years. 
The interim permits require dump operators to install monitor­ing wells around their sites and take periodic samples to indicate whether wastes have leaked from the site and are seeping toward un­derground water supplies. 
The GAO said state officials at­
tributed the lack of compliance to 
the technical complexity and costs 
ofdoing so. A No;th Carolina official 
was quoted as saying that it costs 
about S4,000 to install a monitoring 
well and about Sl.Z,KOO for the first 
year's sampling. 
Florio and Lent said they wnuh.l

Arizona's flood areas to get aid 
Associated Press 
TUCSON, Ariz. President Reagan declared five counties disas­ter areas yesterday in flooded sout· heast Arizona, and forecasters warned a hurricane in the Pacific could bring more unwanted rain. 
Floodwaters receded under most­ly sunny skies for a second con­secutive day, allowing officials to begin toting up the damage, tentatively set at more than S300 million with 10 people dead and five missing. 
In what's being called Arizona's worst disaster of the century, American Red Cross surveys indi· cated about 3,000 houses, mobile homes, and apartment units had been destroyed or damaged by the flooding that began over the weekend. The numbers were ex­pected to climb.

About half of the subdivision's 300 rc~>itknts left their homes Tues­day night because of heavy flow in the combined Gila and Salt Rivers. They returned yesterday after the water receded more than a foot. 
Reagan's declaration will free federal funds for assistance in Green­lee, Pima, Santa Cruz, Graham and Pinal counties. Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who toured flood-stricken areas around Tucson on Wednesday, had asked for federal aid to I 0 counties. 
Bob Blair, a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman in Washington, said federal and state officials were still assessing damages and that other counties might be added to the list.

Many ofits people have a nearly foolish faith that, when all the foreigners leave, the Druse and the Maronites will settle their differences. 
The Turks, the French, the U.S., the P.L.O., the Syrians, and the Israelis have all played with Lebanon, nearly trampling her to death. 
But the Lebanese have not given up. They are a strong-willed people who stare at Death daily, but refuse to give in.

We question Vonderheide's knowledge of 
Spandau Ballet and the other British and 
Australian groups he cites. Are British New

Nt·w Music bands like New Order and Heaven 
I7 are not concerned with making it big in the States as evidt·nced by the non-conformist nature of their music and their lack of American publicity stunts. 
Although Vonderheide cites many bands, his misconceptions oftheir music is clear. The epitome of these misconceptions is his categorization of Haircut One Hundred's sound as "funk". Any New Music listener knows that Haircut's English Ska is situated at tht· opposite end of the music spectrum from 
urban conemporary funk. 
Furthermore. we find Vonderheide's gross 
gt:neralizations about certain groups and their music frustrating. For example, every song which New Order has recorded does not have a "breakneck pace" that is danceable; has Von­
dt:rheide heard "Your Silent Face" and "We Stand Alone," two songs on New Order's latest album? Similarly, every song on Madness' al­bum carries a different beat and tempo. 
From the first sentence of his article Von­derheide reveaJs his myopic outlook on music. He seems unwilling to accept any new music, let alone new bands from England. 
Vonderheide is not only closing his ears, he is dosing his mind to everything that British New Music has to offer. It is a shame that his article focused on the rejection of British music, instead ofSpandau Ballet's "True."

more often now, not just when I get a letter or a phone call. 
It's a shame that it takes a tragedy to make people see the importance of the people around them. Death puts things into perspective so harshly. Too many times it's too late when we remember how important those close to us really are. Despite crammed schedules and vitally important tests, each of us should take more time to remember our family and friends who are so special to us. 
Don't wait for a tragedy to think about those important to you. Sit down today and write a letter to a friend you haven't taJked to in a long time. Or invest in a phone call tonight to tell your parents how much you love them. Ifyou don't take til& time to put things into perspective, you may not get the chance. 
N.D. calendar 
Dear Editor: 
Upon reading the many recent articles and letters on the "Men ofNotre Dame" calendar, I feel obliged to add my two cents worth. 
No gorgeous hunks in bathing suits, please. Imagine, instead, Father Hesburgh in full habit inviting us to make the legendary trek up the fire escape, or Emil reclining at St. Joseph' 
beach with his physical models ofatoms. Ho about a (male) freshmen engineer sprawled sexily in the haJls of Fitzpatrick waiting for terminal on the engineering computt:r? One of our vernerable security guards naughtily enticing us to come on campus with our cars? Or how about an anonymous Notre Dame quarterback out for a leisurely run with an opposing defensive line joining him? I think 
we'd aJl prefer what we know to be a good gag to something that may or may not be for reaJ.

Netters capture tourney 
The Notre Dame men's tennis team made an impressive showing in winning the 14th annual Irish Fallln­vitational Tennis Tournament last weekend here at the Courtney Courts. 
It was the first time since the tournament began in 1970 that Coac.h Tom Fallon's squad has won back-to-back titles. The Irish, 3·0 for the tournament, had to defeat a tough Southern Illinois team in or­der to claim the tournament victory. 
Southern Illinois, 2-1, finished second, while Illinois State and Wisconsin-Oshkosh, J-2 and 0-3 respectively, rounded out the stand­Ings. 
"I think we played very well," Coach Fallon said of his team's per­formance. 
And play very well they did, disposing of Wisconsin-Oshkosh and Illinois State by identical tallies of 9-0 and beating Southern Illinois, 
8-1.

Todd Cruz, who later would turn in 
several fielding gems to keep the 
game close, let this one get by him, 
though, as the speedy Law raced 
home uncontested. 
The White Sox scored without a hit in the sixth. McGregor walked Paciorek leading off. Luzinski then hit a squibber toward first, and Mur· ray let it get under his glove for an error as Paciorek ra<:ed to third. Ron Kittle's doubleplay grounder scored Paciorek. 
Dempsey led offthe bottom ofthe sixth with the third hit off Hoyt but then was erased -almost literally -on a foreceout. IJumbry hit a grounder to second. Dempsey was forced out easily, but rookie shortstop Scott Fletcher's sidewind­ing throw hit Dempsey in the hand as he was protecting his face. 
Perhaps suffering from the rain delay, McGregor's outing took yet another perilous turn inthe seventh, when he left in favor of Sammy Stewart. 
He walked Vance Law to start the inning, then balked him to second. Law was sacrificed to third. When McGregor threw a pitch in the dirt past catcher Dempsey, Law tried to score. !Jut Dempsey scrambled after the ball, threw a strike to McGregor and Law was out. 
McGregor then walkedJulio Cruz, and Rudy Law doubled, chasing McGregor and sending Cruz to third. !Jut Stewart fanned Fisk looking, and McGregor had exited after giving up just one earned run. He had been bested at his own game -finesse and precision. 
L.A. 4, Phlla. 1 
LOS ANGELES-Pedro Guerrero drilled a two-out, two-run triple in the fifth inning, breaking a tie and pushing the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 4-1 victory in last night's second game of the National League Cham­pionship Series. 
The Los Angeles triumph tied the best-of-five pennant playoff at 1-1. Game Three Is scheduled for tomor­row in Philadelphia with Charles Hudson starting for the Phillies against the Dodgers' Bob Welch. 
Guerrero's shot rewarded the pitching of Fernando Valenzuela, who scattered seven hits before Tom Niedcnfuer took over in the ninth. John Denny, a 19-game win· ncr during the regular season, was the loser. 
A(_·tually, it was Valenzuela who got the winning rally started, opening the fifth with a drive that sent Garry Maddox to the center field wall. Maddox, who made a cru· cial error in the fourth game of the 197H playoff !){·tween these teams, caught the ball for an instant but then dropped it as he fell on the warning track. Valenzuela steamed into third base on the error. 
Just when it looked like the rally would fizzle, Dusty IJaker worked Denny for a walk, bringing up Guer­rero. Steve Carlton had pitched around the Dodgers' cleanup hitter in Tuesday night's opener. But Den· ny couldnt escape. On a 2-2 pitch, Guerrero sent a shot into right field that scooted past Sixto Lezcano for a triple, scoring Brock and Baker with earned runs and putting Los Angeles in control.

Sports Improving Saint Mary's team disposes ofhapless Bethel 
By MICHELE MICKEEVER 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team defeated Bethel College in three straight games I '5-13, 15-5, and 15­10 before a disappointingly small crowd in Angela Athletic Facility Tuesday night. 
Strong aggressive play from cap­tain Loret Haney and Ann Boutten enabled the team to quickly dispose of its opponent. Consistent serving by Haney, Miki Maternowski, and Molly Baker contributed to the vic­tory in the second game. 
Bethel rallied in the third game, pushing to a 7-2 lead. The Belles, however, quickly regained their momentum and showed there was no cause for worry, outscoring Bet­hel by ten to clinch the victory. 
While the team was playing closer as a unit, and serving well, Coach Brian Goralski was not pleased with his team's performance. He feels the team is lacking intensity on the

Bell returning to line-up 
In case you have not already heard, Irish tailback Greg Bell has made the fastest recovery from a broken ankle in history. Actually, the ankle that Bell supposedly broke in the Miami game a couple of years ago, was re-examined, and, early this wrek, it was announced that the ankle was not actually broken. 
Bell may see some action in the next couple ofweeks, but, unless his services are badly needed, he probably will be rested until the Southern Cal game on October 22.
