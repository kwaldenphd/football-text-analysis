an independent student newspaper serving notre dame and saint mary's THURSDAY, JANUARY 31, 1980 

by Pat Toomey StaffReporter 
Apparently spurred on by yesterday's front page Observer article, students turned in $2,500 worth of Mardi Gras raffle tickets by last night. This amount raised the total raffle collection from $1,500 to $4,000. 
Before yesterday's collection, the outlook for this year's raffle was grim. On Tuesday night, Mardi Gras Business Manager Mike Day told a Hall Presi­dent's Council meeting that only 5 percent of the tickets were sold and 70 percent of them could not be accounted for. 
When Day's comments appeared in the Observer yes­terday, a flurry of activity began. Last evening's collec­tion yielded $2,500 and a com­plete accounting of all outstand­ing tickets. 
Mardi Gras Co.. ordinator Mike Hickey said he believes that the publicity generated by the Observer article prompted this activity. "Up to this point, not many people realized what the raffle was about,'' Hickey commented. "I think the article drew a lot of attention to it.'' 
Hickey said he hopes to match lastJear' s total of 20,000 tickets sol . "If every student bought just one ticket, we'd be fine," he said. "People can do it for United Way, why not for us.I" 
Hickey said that Mardi Gras is a particularly good cause because it aids CILA, Sr. 
Marita' s Day School, and many other local charities. Unlike most charities, it has no admin­istrative costs.

Iran threatens hostages following Canadian rescue 
(AP) -Iran's foreign minister, angered by the daring Canad­ian rescue of six Americans trapped in Tehran, declared yesterday he expects the U.S. Embassy hostages to suffer for Canada's "duplicity." 
The estimated 50 hostages "most probably" will now be treated more harshly, Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh said, and the responsibility will be Canada's. 
Ghotbzadeh, at a Tehran news conference, denounced the secret Canadian operation a a "flagrant violation" of inter­national law and warned that retribution would be exacted from the Canadians sooner or later. 
But the Moslem militants who have held the embassy and hostages for 88 days refrained from immediately endorsing Ghotbzadeh' s threat of tougher conditions for their captives. Spokesmen said a formal state­ment might be issued later, but some reports quoted militants as saying they would not treat the hostages any differently. A State Department spokesman said Tuesday such a reprisal would be "irrational." 
Iran's domestic political troubles flared into new fight­ing meanwhile. 
Reports reaching Tehran said at least 10 persons were killed and 20 others injured Wednes­day in clashes between the central regime's revolutionary guards and Kurdish militants in western Iran. 
The official Iranian news agency said two army officers held hostage since Monday by unidentified insurgents in the Kurdish town of Salmas were killed. 
Since the victory of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's revolution 
a . year ago, militants in Kurdistan have clashed repeat­edly with security forces in an effort to win greater autonomy for their region. 
The new fighting broke out just a day after the Khomeini regime gave in to one Kurdish demand and withdrew revolu­tionary guards from the Kurd­ish city of Sanandaj. After the withdrawal, the Kurds ended a month-long general strike and a sit-in at the provincial gov­ernor-general's office. 

The Kurdistan violence and other developments in Tehran Wednesday were rdiably re­ported by Western journalists in the Iranian cziJital.

by Mary Fran Callahan staffreporter 
WIN/MAC In--In the rural town of Winimac, where the highly publicized Ford Pinto case is currently being tried, the atmosphere is a mixture of feelings-ranging from disinterest to excitement. 
Yesterday , Ford defense attorney James Neal interrogated 
automotive expert Byron Block in an attempt to ascertain that 
General Motors also produces cars with gas tanks loca1ted directly 
in front of the rear bumper. The scene ocurred in the Winimac 
courtroom, which has paint peeling from its walls. . 
The counroom'snormal seatin~ capacity is roughly 60,,/et bndge -chairs lined the rear walls as dtd standing members o the news media for an approximate total of 100 in attendance. A cross-sectioned model of the '73 Pinto sits blatantly in :front of the jury--creating quite a visual impact in the small courtroom 
Security was very relaxed at the courthouse as lawyers strolled 
through the corridors conferring with one another when court 
recessed. However, M. R. Buckham, deputy sheriff, explained that three Indiana state troopers were sent to Winimac to maintain tight security at the trial. Buckham said. the troopers would be verifying press credentials and directing traffic flow. 
Yet, no traffic problem existed on the brick streets and spectators without credentials were allowed to enter the court room. 
A secretary in the sheriff's office said she felt the trial is no thrill for the townspeople. ''The people are fixed in what they do and where they go. They like the town dead,'' she commented. 
Local residents' comments confirmed this disinterest. 
Mrs. John Russell, a retired resident, is only aware of the trial when she goes to the center of town. "All I've noticed is just a lot of strange faces in town. But they (restaurant and storeowners) know we're regulars, so they take care of us first," she explained. 
Jeri Winters, a beautician in the local beauty salon, said the trial does not particularly interest her. "I never follow the news that much," she commented. "I am busy cleaning my house feeding my husband and getting the kids off to school,'' a customer at the local gas station commented--adding, "I don't have time to follow it (the trial). " 
A.resident summed up the local attidude about the Ford trial when he said, "Whatever they decide it won't effect us." 
However, several residents expressed anger over a recent Newsweek article which portrayed Winimac residents as taking advantage of the Ford trial by using it as an excuse to commercialize. The only example of commercialization is

accidents in two days when the truck crashed into another truck. The driver told police he was blinded by the snow. 
In Southern California, where five people died in earlier rain­storms, mud was 10 feet deep on one street in San Bernardino and overflow from a dam in neighboring Tijuana, Mexico, flooded parts of San Diego, drowning 15 horses. A mud­slide in the Los Angeles suburb of Malibu blocked the north· bound lanes of the Pacific Coast Highway. 
The storm, in its march to the east, dumped 18 inches of snow in Salt Lake City, gave Colorado up to 20 inches of new snow and smothered Flagstaff. Ariz., under 25 inches. Four inches of rain in the mountains threaten· ed to produce serious flooding in the normally dry Salt River bed in Phoenix, Ariz. 
About 1. 540 residents of Eufaula, Okla., had to brave a night without heat in sub-freez­ing weather when a gas line was ruptured by a dynamite blast just north of town. Fifteen large aircraft heaters were trucked in from Tinker . ' i r Force Base to provide heat fm four nursing homes and the Eufaula hospital. 
Dave McGuire, 38, had a typical story. When he set out to make his bakery deliveries in Oklahoma City, he slid into the cars of two neighbors and broke a taillight. Later, he slid

PEKING (AP) -Senior Deputy Premier Deng Xiaoping has c_alled for a crackdown on freedom of expression and urged a ughtening of party discipline in China, Chinese and diplomatic sources said Wednesday. One diplomat called it "turning the screws" on intellectuals who do not toe the line. The sources, who requested they not be identified, said Deng delivered the major policy speech two weeks ago in Peking before 10,000 Communist Party .officials. In the speech, Deng urged that China's "big four" freedoms-to speak out freely , air views fully, hold debates and write wall posters, be abolished, the source said. He also said China's 36 million-member Communist Party had become cumbersome, inefficient and undisciplined. Its members should obey/arty rules, be well-trained and retire when they get too ol , the sources quoted Deng as saying. Deng is 75. 

Authorities determine fire in Flkhart'as arson 
ELKHART, Ind. (AP) · The fire that raced through an Elkhart hotel early Sunday killing five persons was ruled arson yesterday. Authorities said tests on wood scrappings and carpeting taken from a stairway showed the blaze was set, but they refused to say what was used to ignite· it. Investigators said they have no solid suspects but are checking on a handful of known arsonists in the area. 

Homicide rate in Gary highest among world cities 
GARY, Ind. (AP) -~a per capita basis, there are more homicides in this northern Indiana industrial city than anywhere else in the world, according to the Lake County coroner. Gary recorded a record-breakmg 103 homicides last year -far above murdc:r rates in Lake County's two other large cities. There were only 20 homicides in 1979 in East Chicago and Hammond, according to Lake County Coroner Albert W. Willardo. These two cities have a combined population of 154,000, as compared to Gary's 180,000 residents. "We felt a great number of them were drug related," ~illardo s~id. "There is a real drug problem, but no change In the attitude toward combating that problem.''

Lindsay · former mayor, one­time presidential canditate, sometime actor, novelist, ex-TV commentator and now a conten­der for owner of the New York Mets baseball team -is ready to jump back into politics. 
He says he plans to run for the Senate, six years after fore­saking public life for a corpo­rate law practice with the firm of Webster Sheffield. The seat he is eyeing is held by Sen. Jacob Javits, R-N.Y. Lindsay says he has not set a date for his announcement. 
On a wall in his Rockefeller Center oftice, cheek-by jowl with assorted law degrees and citations, hang two photo­graphs of Winston Churchil. 
"Now that was a real leader," said Lindsay. 
It is the type of leadership he believes is missing in America today. 
"I think that there's such a vacuum out there of leadership and such an abundance of mediocrity that I think it's incumbent on a lot of people who've been in public life to take a look at it," Lindsay said. "I don't think we can walk away from it." 
Lindsay hopes to fill the vacuum. But convincing New Yorkers of'his ability to do that will be an uphill struggle-many still blame him for the city's fiscal collap~e. 
Does Lindsay accept that blame? 
"You can't have been mayor for eight years and nor have had responsibility for a lot of things, he said. "But at the same time, I'd like others to accept respon­sibility, and that includes other mayors, governors, members of the City Council, Board or Estimate, state legislators and even presidents of the U.S. and the congress.

I liberal Arts Students can lookforward to jobs 
by Ann Hesburgh 

Job opportunities for Liberal Arts Students are not as scarce as many believe. As a matter of fact, job availability has in­creased over last year, and more companies, for example Owen of Illinois and General Motors, now hold scheduled interviews on campus for those students interested in per­sonnel and product manage­ment of industrial sales. 
Placement Specialist Paul Reynolds said yesterday that "except in areas that are tech­nically orientated, Liberal Arts Students h:1ve few career limit­ations." He added, "Major companies such as Caterpillar need students capable of relat­ing, delegating, and motivating others. They need you as much as you need them." 
Those who prefer not to work for a large corporation may also find information concerning job opportunities in the areas of Social Service, Government, and Retail. 
The question most asked by students on campus is ''How does one go about finding a job?" The Placement Bureau, located in room 213 of the Administration Building, is one place to start. The Place­ment Bureau as well as its auxiliary office located in room 222, has materials that list the names of companies looking for students with Liberal Arts degrees. Also available are the names of top executives to which students may write. 
According to Reynolds, the 
College Placement Annual is 
the best source of investigation. 
The Annual cross references the names ot companies, their job descriptions, and geo­graphic locations. The Employer Literatur·e is also an excellent source for those who are interested in occupational advancement. .: 
In addition to many reference materials, the Placement Bureau offers Counseling and Guidance services. Director Richard Willemin, Career Counselor Sr. i<.athleen Rossman, and Placement Specialist Paul Reynolds en­

CARROLL HALL SMC ADMISSION $1.00 



Witness declares Pinto design hazardous 'in aclass by itself' 
WINIMAC, Ind. (AP)-An auto safety consultant conceded yes­terday in Ford Motor Co.'s reckless homicide trial that the fuel system in the' 1973 Pinto was much like other American-made subcompacts. 
However, Prosecutor Michael A. Cosentino counter­ed that the Pinto was "in a class by itself' as a fire hazard because, unlike other subcom­pacts, the fuel tank was sur­rounded by objects that could puncture it and· trig~er explo­sions in rear-end colltsions. 
Ford is charged with three counts of reckless homicide in the August 1978 burning deaths of three teen-agers in a 1973 Pinto that burst into flames when struck from behind by a van near Goshen, Ind. 
The state contends Ford, which faces maximum fines of $10,000 on each count, knew the Pinto fuel tanks were unsafe but sold the cars anyway. 
Under cross-examination by Ford attorney James F. Neal in Pulaski Circuit Court, auto safety consultant Byron Bloch s::~id it was possible that the fuel tanks of other subcompacts in 1973 were constructed of metal as thin as that of the Pinto. He also agreed that no American-made car had a protective shield around the gas tank at the time. 
Bloch, a lon~-time critic of the Pinto destgn, also said bumpers on the 1973 Chevrolet Vega, American Motors Gremlin and Dodge Colt pro­bably had the same strength and ability as the Pinto to withstand rear-end impact. But he added: "They were all bad." 
The defense is trying to show that Ford met standards set by auto manufacturers at the time the Pinto was made. 
The prosecution has con­tended that the Pinto had a soft rear end with no structure to protect the gas tank from being punctured and that its location behind the axle made it more vulnerable to being crushed. 
However, Neal said "95 per­cent of all American cars had the gas tank flat behind the axle as it was in the 1973 Pinto." 
Cosentino argued that the question was ''not only of the location of the gas tank but of the environment of the gas tank.'' The bolts on the differential housin~ put the Pinto "in a class by ttself' with respect to the "hostile envi­ronment" surrounding the fuel tank. · 
Bloch conceded that the Gremlin, Vega and Colt also had no significant rear-end structure to protect the tank and had no side supports similar to those on the Pmto. 
But he added that both the Vega and the Pinto had a "profoundly weak" rear struc­ture. He described the metal support near the gas tank at the left rear of the Pinto as a "simple, Swiss cheese-type of sheet metal," indicating it could not prevent the tank from being crushed in a rear-impact collision . 
Earlier, Bloch said there probably would have been no fire in the Indiana 'accident if the Pinto tank had been above or forward of the rear axle. Medical testimony has indicat­ed the three girls who died in the crash might be alive today were it not for the fire. 
Bloch said Ford could have protected the tank with frame rails and other devices, includ­ing a protective shield that would have kept it from being punctured. The tank also should have been made of stronger material and the filler tube should have been more securely fastened to the tank, he said . 
However, Bloch admitted under questioning by Neal that some auto manufacturers, in­eluding Datsun, Toyota, Volks­wagen and Mazda, switched the location of the fuel tank on some models from above or forward of the axle to behind it­as the Pinto was designed. He also said Oldsmobile, which put the fuel tank ahead of the axle in 1961, abandoned that loca­tion in 1974, the same year Ford adopted it in larger cars .

Sarah Baker, Winimac Public Library director, confirmed that the Newsweek article generated controversy, and incensed other wise disinterested residents. "It put us all in a bad light," she. explained. A copy of the article was on display in the library and people smeared it with thumb prints. People have come in to read it, so we put it out," Baker said. 
However, she said the library is not unusually excited about the trial. "We're all excited because we are busy planning to expand our library,'' a librar­ian commented. Conversation in the library did center around the library's expansion rather than the Ford tnal. 
Contrasting with the attitude of most of the local residents, students at Winimac County School were enthusiastic to the point of being bubbly. 
"I was at the dentist's office and I saw them bringing the chopped up car into the court­house!'' a second grade girl exclaimed. All the children questioned knew the develop­ments of the trial although they did not read the newspapers. 
Brad Feckler, a sixth grade teacher at the school, is teach­ing a class in current affairs. Feckler said he has never seen such enthusiasm and interest generated in his students. ''The trial really is exciting for the kids,'' Feckler commented. 
Articles from various news­papers and magazines pertain­tog to the Ford trial were tacked 
on  a  bulletin  board  which

"I just got my license in cosmotology, but I'm not ~oing to quit until after the tnal is finished," she commented-­adding that the tips were simply too ~ood. .

'Too controversial' 
Networks reject Mobil ad 
NEW YORK (AP) -What is more profitable -an oil comp­anv or a television network? Mobil Corp. says a network is 
and it made a commercial 

saying  so.  The  networks  say  
they  will  not  run  the  
commercial.  

"I think it's censorshi~," Mobil executive Vice Prestdent Herbert Schmertz said yester­day. "I don't think their motivation is to censor, but that is the result." 
The networks said the decision to reject the ad was based on long standing polici~s against airing commericals on controversial public issues and had nothing to do with the discussion of their profits. NBC also challen_ged the relevance of the compans1on. 
The Mobil commercial, which has run on stations in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. features a well 
dressed man, described by Mobil as a "Security analyst­type" saying Mobil's profits were "b1g" but then noting that Mobil spent more than$2. 5 billion last year ro find and produce oil and gas. 
"To get profits in pers­pective," the man in the com­mercial says, ''business anaylsts look at percentages, just as you do when you open a savings account. Over the years, Mobil has earned about the same profit percentage on money invested as the average for all manufacturing industries -and less than for ABC,CBS, and NBC." 
The commercial did not back up the statement, but in news­paper ads Mobil cited figures on return on stockholders' equity -the amount of profit divided by the amount of money invested by shareholders. 
In 1978, according to Fortune magazine, ABC had a 21.6 percent return on total profits of $135.6million,CBS's return was 
21.0 percent on profits of$198. 1 million; and RCA Corp. had a return of 17.4 percent on earn­ings of $278.4 million. RCA owns NBC, but does not pro­vide separate financial details on the network. Mobil's return was 12.6 percent, but profits were$1.13 billion. 
There are differences in methods of computing return on shareholders' equity. This year Mobil changed accounting procedures, and as a result concluded that its return on shareholders' equity was 13.0 percent in 1978, a figure that grew to 20.8 percent in 1979 as earnings rose to $2.01 billion. RCA's profits were $283.8 million for 1979, but it did not release a figure on sharehold­ers' equity. CBS and ABC have not released 1979 earnings. 
NBC, in a statement read by a sr,okes_man, ci~ed its policy that ' Partisan v1ewpo1nts on important issues such as oil company profits are presented in news and publtc affairs programs, produced by disinterested news profession­als and not in paid commer­cials." 

"Mobil's attempt to compare oil company profits with the return on invested capital of the television networks had no bearing on our decision, and in our judgment injects wholly extraneous arguments into Mobil's defense of its profits," the statement added. 
CBS Vice President Gene Mater said his network's refusal to air the ad "had nothing to do with our profits,'' but declined to discuss the reasons. An ABC spokesman said the company had a policy similar to NBC's.

Ozanne speaks on success 
by Peter Macdonald 
Paul Ozanne, president of both the North American Car Corp­oration and the Tiger Leasing Group, spoke to approximately one hundred Notre Dame business students last ni8ht in the Hayes-Healy auditonum. Using examples from his own corporations, Ozanne outlined characteristics of successful businesses and successful businessmen. 
Ozanne said that it is very important for businesses to have leaders who understand the industry and who under­stand the company. He said that a good executive must be willing to constantly define and . redefine the operations and the goals of his company, and be willing to implement changes in order that those goals may be reached. 
Ozanne's lecture was entitled "Changing at Age Seventy." He began by pointing out that the Tiger Group, after being in the full-service railcar leasing business and other businesses for over seventy years, found its profits going flat. They were in the $25 milhon pretax range for three years straight. Then the executives decided that reassessment of the company 
. operations and goals was in order. They had statistics about market share, pretax profits, costs and other im­
portant data compiled, and took 
them to the Strategic Planning 
Institute in Boston for analysis. 
Based on advice from the ·Institute, the company under­went two key changes: the expansion of in-house repair capacity of cars from 40 percent to 90 percent, and the incorporation of outside investors in order to cut back internal capital intensity. Once these changes were made, pretax profits jumped to $36 million 111 1978. 
Again using an example from his company, Ozanne spoke of the qualities of a good man­ager. When his corporation undertook an incentive program in twenty of its plants, only five plant managers attained the necessary goals to realize one hundred percent of their in­centives. Ozanne said that those five were "peo_{>le oriented, respected, posiuve motivators, involved delegators and entrepreneurs.'' 
Mr. Ozanne's lecture was the third in a four lecture series sponsored by the finance club. The club expressed the hope that by bringing in prominent executives to its Finance Forum, students can have a chance to be exposed to a real life view of the business world and can share in the exper­iences of those executives. 
The final lecture will be given tonight by Richard DeVos, co-founder and president of the Amway Corporation, a firm which distributes household cleaning and personal care products to over 300,000 independent distributorships. DeVos was the subject of a recent article in Time maga­zine. His lecture will be given a 7 p.m. in the library auditorium. .

The thirty-year-old, German-born carpenter has been dubbed "the best-kept secret in California" by New West magazine. But the secret is out; William Ackerman is one of the finest and most original steel­string guitarists in the country. 
He is also founder ofWindham Hill Rec?rds (name? after his contracting busmess), an mdependent, rapidly­expanding record company which began as an at-home mail-order venture to distribute his albums. Ackerman estimates Windham has sold between 70,000 to 80,000 in­strumental albums since its birth in 1976, including Ackerman's acoustic 
The Search jar the Turtle's Navel [19761, It takes a Year (1977], and Childhood and Memory (1979]. 
His soundtrack for Spin't of the Wind, a documentary about Alaska which won the ~rand prize in the U.S. Film Festival, IS also rumored to be up for an Academy Award.

The Secret Life ofPlants 
Stevie Wonder 
(Tam/a) 
Stevie Wonder albums are not merely musical recordings; they are events unto themselves. Known for his meticulous and deliberate atten­tion to production detail, Wonder usually takes excessively long periods of time re-recording and remixing albums until they reach what he considers near perfection. As a result, the talented multi-instru­mentalist's cross-breeding of soul, funk, and pop sounds sells millions of records not only to the black public, but to countless numbers of other music enthusiasts. 
His new double album, journey Through the Secret Ltfe ofPlants, is an elaborate and complex project, two years in the making. It is gloriously packaged in orchid­scented artwork of Japanese origin, and is rife with sound effects of countless sources. Backing vocals are . provided by hundreds of various personnel in three languages. Of the diverse set of instruments, the vast majority are played by Wonder himself", with help from top session musicians. The music itself was recorded in seven locations. It appe?.rs that Wonder has embarked on his most involved project ever. 
But appearances are deceiving-­when it comes right down to hard tacks, no amount of production effort could save this lethargic exercise from its incredible ability to produce sleep efficiently. Those who find Wonder's light metaphysical ramb­lings stimulating may enjoy the record, but there is no doubt that the four sides of utterly similar music will drive even the most ardent fan up the proverbial wall. In short, the album is well produced, to be sure, but what is produced is repetitive and downright boring. 
The strange thing about the album is that each cut, taken separately, is quite agreeable. The pop sound is emphas1zed, rather than the stronger funk or soul emotionalism, and as a result, the songs match the lighter subject matter in musical tone. Much' of the first and fourth sides consists ofneo·s mphonic ·instrumentals Chiffon Tricyclle Queen," and "Slow Motion Roast Beef Restaurant Se­duction?'' And swears the titles are autobiographical? 
Raised in California, Will was strumming surfing tunes at age eleven, which he promptly aban­doned for the folksy music of The Kingston Trio. Later, at Stanford College, where he was ''fully incar­cerated as an inmate for three years'' (he dropped out five credits short of a degree in English), Ackerman heard the explorative Western folk music of John Fahey and Robbie Basho. Intrigued, Ackerman began to ex­periment with open C and D tunings, developing them into songs "that make sense to my heart.'' 
"I am in no way a musical theoritician," Will stresses. "You would have to study to be as ignorant as me." 
Ackerman's writing method is highly unusual. He slacks the strin~s of his handsome six-string, spltt­bridge guitar "down to nothing," then tunes them to a chord that corresponds to his mood. ''I under­stand right away if there's a theme in it," he comments. The resulting 
a .._.._.~ 
reminiscent of heart-on-the-sleeve romantic period classical music, but the synthetic overproduction reduces these experiments to little more than mildly interesting. It is on sides two and three, where a harder, more diverse sound is presented, that Wonder does well. Particularly appealing is "Send One Your Love" done in two versions--instrumentally and with vocals. 
But, alas, the subject matter grows too thin to support or explain four sides of music. The record is a soundtrack for a movie yet to be released. One wonders, if the album is any indication of what the film is about, if all this pontification and exaltation of the greenery of the earth is justified. After all, how exciting can it be to be a plant?

The Romantics 
(Nemperor.} 

My first exposure to the Romantics was last summc~r at a club called BGinnings near Chicago, the self proclamed "Concert club of the midwest." I was; there to see Rock­pile and was not expecting much in the way of a back up band as is usually the case in such places. This was an unusual night though, the type of night where you had to get there early to get in a position where you could see the band when you were standing 01n your table. As the Romantics were announced, virtual unknowns from Detroit, I prepared myself to sit through a half hour or so ofmediocre metal gruel. Wrong! The group I expected nothing from pro­ceeded to put forth a set of perfected, tight highly enjoyable REAL rock and roll. 
Even though it is a collection of cuts from various albums, Rock and Roll Music has been my favorite Beatles album since it's release. This was the Beatles at their rockingest, full of Chuck Berry and the like's classics, along with their, "we're a guitar band'' rock and roll of the fab four's creation. Once hearing it, a craving was formed for more,but being the middle of the seventies, one was confined to searching the bargain bins. No one was putting out real rock

· impressionism,'' a term coined by guitari~t Jim Solace. "It's very dram~t~c and graphic, and tangible, a_nd v1s1ble," he explains. "Inspira­tiOn comes from something visible like sitting on a hillside.'' ' 
All Ackerman compositions are strictly instrumental, except for "Woman She Rides," off h1s Turtle album. "I sing just terribly," Ackerman admits. "There aren't words to describe it ... I have to be absolutely plastered out of my mind." ­
Questioned about the surrealistic titles of his songs, Will throws back his head and laughs, then confesses the "liners" on his early albums were ''largely defensive.'' (Cuts from Chzldhood and Memory are more straight forward: "Seattle," "Wall in the Wind"). 
With relish, Will rattles off his favorite title, " 'The Second Great Tortion Bar Overland of West Townshend, Vermont, Jose Pepsi At~ending,' a horror story of mental fattgue and intoxication where in a maddened Pepsi salesman is coerced into the abandonment of all ethical standards and a submissive truck first experiences the freedom of modern downhill skiing.'' 
According to the steel-string mas­ter, he an~ a friend, a member of the Pepsi Family, "and two frozen bottles of tequila,'' decided toJ·oyride

Ackerman,  who  has  toured  with  

Harry Chapin, the Persuasions, and Numero Uno steel-stringer Alex De­Grassi, and opened shows for ] oan Baez, will be touring with local guitar artist Richard Walters through Indi­ana and Illinois the next two weeks. They will perform at Notre Dame or. Sunday, Feb. 3, in Washington Hall at 8 p.m. Tickets are $2.50, and can be purchased at the Student Union 
(icket office or at the door .

... Long Distance 
Local guita_rist Richard Walters was rummagmg in a Mishawaka record shop when strains of Will Ackerman's It Takes a Year flowed through the store. 
''It was kind of intangible,'' recalls Walters. "But the first time I heard it, I knew I'd found the directorship I'd wanted." 
Walters purchased the album, and began picking Ackerman's tunes by ear at home. Then, "On a whim," he wrote the carpenter-composer, and received a letter back within five days. 
Thus began a fifteen-month cor­respondence between the two Fahey and Basho disciples, and weekly long·distancephone guitar lessons via Indiana Bell. The two musicians, who plan to conduct a ten-day concert tour through Iq.diana and Illinois , finally met face-to-face Monday night when Rick picked up Will at O'Hare 
and roll. As the seventies wound to an end though, this hunger for the real thing began to be appeased in the form of numerous bands who saw their niche in life to·be bringing back the ''good stuff''. The Romantics fit in this catesory, and they fit in at the top of the ltst. 
To see or hear the Romantics throws one back to the mid-sixties; before the onslaught of distortion effects synthesizers, and lyrics that required the help of hallucinogenics to under­stand them. The Romantics are the very essence of this time period tr3:nsponed to the eighties for your enJoyment. They are not the hype boys such as The Knack; there is no overdose of sarcasm, no sexist meat­market lyrics. What we have instead is the writing team of guitarists Jimmy Marinos and Mike Skill giving us the kir;td of stuff th~t the pre­flower children generatton thrived on. That is the beauty of this album there's not a cover on it, it's all originals written by children of the seventies. The Romantics have cap­tured the true essence of that era of music, both in the riffs and the lyrics, and they have done it nothing but justice. 
I hare to sound overly excited about an album, but I feel this album merits it. Though many bands have tried the same thing lately, most have been 
In a classroom in O'Shaughnessy, before their late-night interview on WSND's "NocturneFlight," Acker­man and Walters discussed their styles over a bottle of Pinor Noir. 
Walters, a former student at Notre Dame, who has played his mahogany Guild D-25 at Vegetable Buddies and numerous coffee houses, is a "guitar impressionist" like Ackerman, though he comments his composi­tions are ''more circular in motion-­sort of an A-B-A-B construction." 
"I like what Rick does," Ackerman comments, adding they've discussed recording Walters on Windham Hill Records. "It's a matter of finding enough material to round out a good album.'' 
There is little doubt the two will 
conduct a successful tour together.

musically feeble, although some have achieved commercial success. The Romantics give us the type of genuine rock and roll uncluttered by ~}'pe many ?fus long for. Simple rock nff~ and Iynes that are of the girl-boy vanety are what fills this album. It represents a return to simplicity that seems to be ~enuine and not JUSt a kitsch, cash-tn, formula to make money. The only facet of this band that eve~ has the slightest tinge of the clomsm so present today is drummer Wally Palmar who at times think~ he is Keith Moon, playing his set w1th the butts of his 'sticks and flailing his arms in tradition of the !a~e madman-geni~s. 9r ~aybe this ts JUSt a patterned msp1ratwn as is the c:;tse with Dave Edmunds, the rocka­b1lly rocker who plays Chuck Berry better today than the master did in the fifties. 
If the Romantics make it big, it will be on the basis of their music and not on the basis of a big label behind them. It has happened before. The possibility exists for this band to do it. If you heard the album on Night Flight Tuesd~y nigh~ you'll probably agree. Sure, Its looktng back instead of going forward into new venues, but after all they are called the Romantics.

Sue Glasson, a gift shop clerk, said she thinks the trial has hurt business. ''There is no parking and the old people are afraid of the cameras. Some sneak in the back door to buy things," she said.

''The ramp was like glass and I slid all the way down the ramp into the back of a car some joker had left there overnight," he said. After leaving a note on the car, McGuire started up an icy hill. 
''There was no traction and I started sliding backward,'' McGuire said. "That's when this truck coming up the hill rammed me from behind.'' 
While McGuire was waiting for police, another car spun out of control and demolished the front end of his car.

Carter sees no threat to Caribbean 
WASHINTON (AP) -President Carter says he sees no outside threat to the Caribbean area and therefore will not promise to use military force to defend it. 
Carter thus declined to place the neighboring Caribbean in the same" ''vital interest'' cate­gory as the Persian Gulf. He also asserted that the United States would not be able, now or in the future, to defend the Persian Gulf area by itself. 
The president made the statements Tuesday in a ques­tion and answer session with 
Amway president to speak 
Richard M. Devos, president of the worldwide Amway Corp­oration which he co-founded 10 1959, will be one of the princi­pal speakers at the finance forum at 7 tonight in the library auditorium. The program is sponsored by the finance club and is open to the public. 
DeVos is a native of "Grand Rapids,Mi. At the age of 14 he contracted to move trucks with his lifelong partner, Jay Van Andel, to Montana. The two served in the Air Force together during World War II, operated an air charter service, sailed to the Caribbean on a schooner that sank off the coast of Cuba and then founded the Amway firm after backpacking through South America for a year. 
DeVos supervises the activ­ities of more than 300,000 independent distributorships of Amway in the United States, Canada, J apao, Australia, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, Malaysia, Bermuda, France, West Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands. His firm manufactures and sells more than 200 household and per­sonal care ,produ(;tS. Sales of the products are expected to exceed one billion dollars in 1980. DeVos is also co-chair­man of the Mutual Broad­casting System, the world's largest radio network, which is owned by Amway.

visiting editors and broad­casters. The White House released a transcript of the session yesterday. 
Carter, who declared last week that any outside threat to the oil-rich Persian Gulf would be repelled by military force if necessary, was asked if the Caribbean also was considered of vital interest to the United States. " 
"Obviously," Carter re­sponded, "the Caribbean is of great interest to our country, and is our closest group of neighbors.'' But he added: 
"I see no military threat to the integrity of the nations in the Caribbean from an outside force, and therefore don't con­sider it necessary to define it as one of vital interest where military action by our own country would be necessary to defend it .... I would not want to threaten. military force there." 
Asked if' 'we do indeed have what it takes militarily'' to redeem his pledge to repel any Soviet threat to the Persian Gulf area, Carter said: 
"I don't think it would be accurate for me to claim that at this time, or in the future, we expect to have enough military strength and enough military presence there to d~fend the region unilaterally.'' 
The president said the United States would need "cooperation from nations ''who are heavily dependent, even more than we are, on an uninterrupted supply of oil from that region" -a ~eference to Western Europe mdJapan. 
In his State of the Union address, Carter said any out­side effort to gain control of the Persian Gulf ''will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of America and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.'' 
Carter also gave his visitors his first public response to a speech Monday in which Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, his chief rival for the Democratic presi­dential nomination, was sharply critical of administration pol­icies ranging from the economy to the crises in the Persian Gulf. 
Responding to Kennedy's statement that ''we should not be moving toward the brink of sending another generation of the young to die for failures of the old in politics,'' Carter said: 
"I have tried to keep our country at peace. And so far I thank God that we have not had any American service men or women ~ive their lives in combat smce I have been in office. I hope I can go out of this White House with the same record intact."

The Irish had piled up eight straight po1nts before Armstrong and Nowalk com­bined to put Saint Mary's within one at 16-15. 
Notre Dame managed to hold off the Belle attack and headed for the lockerroom with a 36-29 lead. Petro did not express  surprise with the strong Belle 
   Matvey defense after the game. "Saint Mary's was playing very aggressive on defense. They have seen us play and know our offense well. They were able to anticipate our passes and they were really hustling,'' complemented the third-year coach. 
The Belles' second-year coach, Jerry Dallessio was also impressed with his team's play.

''I was pleased with the way we/layed. We knew what they ha , but just couldn't capital­ize," stated Dallessio, Notre Dame graduate. "We did prove to ourselves that we have 1mproved since December. Notre Dame is one of the toughest if not the toughest teams we play all year, and I'm happy we were in the game until the last few minutes. It was definitely closer than a 17-point ball game." 
Last night's game was surely not a rerun of the Irish 81-45 romp on December 4. The Belle's were in the contest throughout most of the game. The downfall of the Saint Mary's ream was a failure to control the boards, turnovers, and too many missed buckets. The Irish squad outrebounded the 'Belles 58-40. 
Saint Mary's also suffered from a plague of turnovers, committing a far from respect­able 35. The Belles did manage to nab 20 steals in the game, led by Armstrong's five, but could not capitalize. 
Dallessio played down Armstrong's weak scoring night and emphasized the con­tributions of the remaining members. ''In the first half we weren't shooting the ball well at all. When Anne got hurt someone had to take over, when she has a bad game someone just has to jick up. Nancy (Nowalk) an Mary (Zuehlke) did the job. Anne can play a steady, good game even if she doesn't score. " 
''I get nervous when I play Saint Mary's," confessed Petro

Skiers place 
in lstmeet 
Despite problems in the early 
races due to a lack of gate 
training, the Notre Dame-Saint 
Mary's Ski Team had a strong 
performance last weekend. The 
men's team, competing in a 
field of 90 racers and ten teams 
finished fourth, while the 
women's team, now split up 
into separate teams, had some 
top fimshers. 
After steady first runs, Jim 
Byrne and Mike Case turned in 
some of the fastest times on 
their second run to finish 
seventh and 13th, respectively, 
in the slalom, and Jim Comito 
added a 20th place finish. 
Captain Mike Quinlivan led 
the way for the Irish in the giant 
slalom, taking second place, 
while Case (15th) and Byrne 
(21st) again scored. 
In the women's division, Patti Wilson finished fourth in the slalom to lead Saint Mary's to a fourth place finish. The Irish women skied well in the­giant slalom, with Leslie Costello taking 14th. 
Quinlivan feels that the team will peak in the next few races, right in time for the Midwest Championships. "We are always slow starters,'' he ob­served. "We just don't get the early season practice. The Michigan schools have facilities nearby. We held a training camp for 25 skiers out in Utah, but we were prevented from running gates due to lack of snow. 
''But everybody is on their skis and doing well technically from the excellent free skiing out there. So the first couple of meets ared·ust practice for us. We shoul come on strong in the big races late in ~he season, like last year when we sent three men to the National Collegiate Championships.''

Sophomore stalwart Curt Rood is also a questionable starter for Sunday. The Sturgis, Mich., native strained ligaments in his left hand

Sepeta's main concern now is to nurse his stricken squad back to health and put together a strong lineup to make a run for the National Catholic Cham­pionship which eluded the de­fending champions last year. Freshman 118-pounder Mark Fisher (6-10) is expected to team up with a dose-to-healthy 
and anchor the lightweight end of the Irish lineup.
