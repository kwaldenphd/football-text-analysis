Senate passes resolution commending football team 
In , a remarkable display of unbiased statemanship, the U.S. Senate, at the request of Indiana Senator Birch Bayh yesterday unanimously conferred a resolution commending the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team for winning the 1977 National College ,championship. 
Bayh, who first tried to introduce the resolution several weeks ago, said that he had managed in the interim to convice the Senators from Alabama and Arkansas that, despite the performances of those football teams last season, the outstanding record compiled by the Fighting Irish merited the Senate's commendation. 
The Senate unanimously passed the resolution on a voice vote. Bayh described as a "significant compromise" the fact that, imme­diately following the Notre Dame resolution, the Senate also voted to approve the resolution introduced by Senator James B. Allis of Alabama commending the Ala­bama, Arkansas, Penn State, and University of Texas teams for "a year of outstanding and wholesome competition that brings credit to their schools and to national colle­giate football." 
Commenting on that vote, Bayh said, "In the finest tradition of Indiana football, we won the big one." 
''The University of Notre Dame and its interests have helped the country for its academic excellence and its dedication to the furthering of moral and religious values," the Hoosier Democrat told his Senate colleagues upon the introduction of the resolution. 
"As some of my colleagues also know, Notre Dame has an interest in football. In fact, I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that Notre Dame is probably the most widely known team in college football. Its supporters include not only the actual alumni, but also many additional subway alumni whose only qualification is an 
intense and abiding interest in . Notre Dame's fortune," Bayh said. · He went on to note that Notre Dame has a "long and rich tradition which has provided Ame­rica with some of its most colorful sports figures, among them being the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame, Knute Rockne, the Gipper, Frank Leahy and Ara Parsegian, all of whom have become household 
words across the nation.'' 
"The 1977 Notre Dame football 
team has continued this attitude 
and tradition. As I'm sure we all 
know, this te.am won the Cotton 
Bowl, and, moreover, in a remark­
able display of the unbiased accu­
racy of the American news media, 
both the AP and UPI polls recog­
nized Notre Dame as the national 
college championship team. I feel 
it is entirely appropriate for the 
Senate to offer its congratulations 
on this occasion both to the team 
and its fine coaching staff headed 
by Dan Devine." 
Service hired to investigate security 41
by Diane Wllson Senior Staff Reporter 

The top priority of Security Audit Inc., which is presently investigat­ing Notre Dame security, is to "assess the security of women," according to Dean of Students James Roemer. 
Security Audit Inc. is a profes­
sional firm involved in investigat­
ing security systems. Robert 
Murphy, president of Security 
Audit Inc., will'head the investiga­
tion. Murphy is a Notre Dame 
graduate who worked as a special 
agent for the FBI from 1951-1977. 
Murphy will be assisted by 
William A. Morrison, an account­
ant and Security Audit's vice 
president. Also participating will 
be Frank W. Matthys who has 
served as an FBI Special Agent for 
more than 20 years as well as 
holding a high security post in 
private industry. 
The audit, which will last approx­1imately six weeks, began the first of the year, according to Bro. Just Paczesny . vice president for stu.­dent affair~. . During this period, the investi!S ttors will go "walking, riding, ind observing" the way security is handled on campus, 
Paczesny stated. 
Along with women's security, another aspect that will be audited carefully is the organization of security. "This inspection will include administrative procedures presently utilized in the Depart­ment, guard scheduling and train­ing, equipment, a review of person­nel qualifications and pay scales, a review of liaison arrangements with law enforcement agencies and a review of patrol schedules," Murphy stated. 
The aspects of women's security which will be studied include "the physical charateristics of the women's residence halls: looks, lighting, fire protection, guard procedures, alarm requirments and University rules as they affect the safety of women students," Murphy explained. 
According to Roemer, Security Audit has already conducted many interviews with Security, Univer­sity administration, faculty, ·staff and students. They have specifi­cally met with the presidents from the women's halls, as well as rectors and RA' s from each of the women's halls. 
"They are very professional," Roemer stated. "They have asked questions to hundreds of people." 
A -third major consideration of Security Audit according to Roemer is the Security of the ACC and the 
football stadium. Roemer said that this specif;.cally includes the ACC  I~·~·~lFi  /I  . '·:-v; ,.~~<".~V ~.··  '-..J' "  J11.f. 1 . ~

Security Audit will also "review  
the exterior physical characteristics  
of the University premises as they

dents.  This review will consider  
lighting, fencing,  pedestrian  and

Mandatory measure 

Energy curtailment foreseen 

least of them is, wlio has to suffer? 
Mandatory curtailments have yet to be ordered, but Gov. Otis R. Bowen and his top energy advisers have said it is a foregone con­clusion they will be imposed for at least some untilities. 
The Public Service Commission already has declared a statewide energy emergency because of coal shortages caused by the 67 day old United Mine Workers strike. 
There now are four basic decis­ions to be made after a special PSC hearing Friday: 
1. 
Should mandatory curtailments be ordered. 

2. 
Should all classes of customers -industrial, commercial and res­idential -be affected. 

3. 
How should they be enforced. 

4. 
Should the cutbacks be imposed on a utility-to-utility basis or state­wide. 


None of the answers will be popular with everyone. 
If curtailments are ordered, something that's never happened in Indiana before, there will be complaints from those incon­venienced by them that proper

Indiana coal shortage not to affect Notre Dame 
by Ann Gales Senior Staff Reporter 
Although the Indiana Public Service Commission declared an energy emergency in Indiana Wednesday, Fr. James L. Riehle, director of energy conservation at Notre Dame, stated that the University will "probably not be affected at all" by Indiana's coal shortage. 
Riehle explained that Notre Dame has its own power plant, so that the University is pretty much self-sufficient energy-wise. He said that the Purchasing Depart­ment buys coal from "lliinois or wherever they can get a good deal on it," and estimated that enough coal is presently stored to heat and light the campus for six to eight weeks. 
The energy shortage, caused by the 67 day old United Mine Workers strike, will probably result in mandatory curtailments of at least some Indiana utilities, accord­ing to Gov. Otis R. Bowen and his top energy advisors. 
Mandatory cutbacks, according to Riehle, would probably not apply to the University since it has an independent power plant. 
Indiana and Michigan Electric Co., which supplies energy to the South Bend area, has reported about a 45-day stockpile of coal. When asked if Notre Dame might give some its coal supply to I & M, Riehle responded negatively, commenting, "What little we could give them wouldn't be enough to really help."

SMC 'Twenty-One Bar' to open 
by Marjorie lrr 
After nearly a year of planning, the Saint Mary's "Twenty-One Bar" will become a reality when it opens for business two weeks from today. 
Open to SMC and Notre Dame students who have reached 21, the bar will open its doors underneath the SMC dining hall for Happy Hour on Friday, Feb. 24, from 3 to 5:30p.m. In addition to weekly Friday Happy Hours, the bar will be open on Saturday nights from 8p.m. to 2a.m.

Rather, it is our intention to strive for those security arrangements which will be conducive to personal safety and be within reasonable and aesthe­tic limits." Paczesny stated that Security Audit may come up with sugges­tions that the students do not like, but he emphasized, "We are taking a positive approach to the security problem. Security is very serious," he concluded. According to Roemer, the reason for the audit is the concern with security on campus, especially for women. Roemer explained that there have been many -disturbing incidents, which he would not like to see repeated.

Twenty-One Bar will offer a more relaxed atmosphere, according to Kathleen Rice, dean of student . affairs. "I think it will center more social life on campus," Rice said. 
According to Nancy Mogab, senior class President, "it won't be just a bar to stand around. It will be a place to sit down and relax or to dance.'' 
Budweiser and Miller Lite will be on tap. Burgundy, rose and chablis wines will also be served, and the usual snack bar fare will be offered. 
Bar cards, good for free admis­sion, will be sold to SMC and ND students of legal age. Without a card, $.50 admission will be charged at the door. The cards will go on sale the week befor~ the opening and will also be avatlable anytime thereafter. 
Mogab said administration and faculty members from SMC and ND are also invited, especially to the Friday Happy Hours. 
The bar will be operated under the supervision of an advisory board composed of Director of Student Affairs Mary Laverty; student body president Mary Ruka­vina; vice president for academic affairs Kathy Hedges; vice presi­dent for student affairs Kathy O'Connell; senior class president Nancy Mogab and junior class president Donna Noonan. 
The board is now taking applica­tions for a manager, assistant manager, four bartenders and four 
J.D. checkers. The manager must be an MBA or Law student. Mogab encouraged women to apply for the position. The assistant manager must be a SMC student, preferably a junior with a business back­ground.

The Twenty-One Bar. was financed by a $1,500 donatton fr?m the SMC Student Assembly whtch the college matched. The $3,000 has been put toward several neces­sities and improvements in the dining hall's lower level. 
A four-keg beer cooler was the initial investment. New couches, and chairs are being purchased and some of the large tables will be removed. There wilT also be a dance area and a new stereo system will be installed. Other new additions include pool and foosball tables and pinball and computer games. 
During bar hours, students under twenty one years old will not be admitted. According t? a ~oil conducted last semester, thts pohcy is not expected to cause much dissatisfaction among underclass­men. Charlie Flaim, director of SAGA Food Service at St. Mary's reported to the advisory board that business at the snack b~r is extremely slow on Saturday mghts.

Architecture chairman named to Century Mall 
Professor Ambrose M. Richard­son, ·chairman ·of the Department of Architecture at Notre-Dame, was recently chosen by South Bend Mayor Peter Nemeth to serve as advisor to the Architect Selection Committee for the Century Mall Parking Garage Project. 
According to Mayor Nemeth, Prof. Richardson · was asked to advise the ·Committee because of "his e~pertise in the field of architecture." Prof, Richardson previously served in a similar capacity for the original Century Center project. 
The purpose of the Committee, in Mayor Nemeth's words, is "basically to recommend an archi­tect for the job.'' In order to ensure that all those affected by the project will be represented, the eight . members appointed by the Mayor include representatives from the South Bend City Council, the Department of Redevelopment, the South Bend Public Transporta­tion Corporation, St. Joe Bank, and the Historic Preservation Commis­sion. . 
The Committee will interview all prospective applicants, narrowing the field down to one final choice, which it will then present for approval to the Department ·of Redevelopment, the Public Trans­portation Corporation, and the private investors who are financing the project. The final selection should be made by April or May of this year. 
coors awards

Devine, 52, and Drew Carver, 31, of Columbia, Mo. were a­warded a distributorship in the Jefferson City, Mo. area, the brewery said in a news release. Carver manages a men's shop. 
Coors announced last August that it would add Missouri and Iowa to its 14-state marketing area. 
Strong customer demand and increased production capacity were given as reasons for expansion. 
Coors beer may be available in Missouri as early as July, the company said.

Regulations discussed tor energy cutbacks -· 
[continued from page 1] call for percentage curtailments to . be triggered when a utility reaches a 4-day supply of coal. The plan is designed to protect against total failure of electric power systems. Three of the state's five largest utilities -Public Service Indiana, lt1dianapolis Power and Light Co. and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Co. -are at or near the 40-day level now. Indiana and Michigan has about a 45-day stockpile and Northern Indiana Public Service Co. a 60-day supply. Watt favors an across-tile-board curtailment, affecting residential ,1s well as commercial and indust­rial customers. The residential user who doesn't conserve is "shafting someone out of a job," he added. Regardless of the decision on that point, industries will suffer the most if for no other reason than that's. where most of the power is consu'med and where the largest savings can be realized. It will not be without sacrifice however. Most industries, Watt· said, can absorb a 15 percent cutback without feeling severe hardship. A larger cutback could require production adjustments and lead to lay-offs. Therefore, a company might decide to close one or two days a week or run just 75 of 100 machines, laying off the other 25 operators. The most extreme circumstance would be rotating blackouts in which a utility shuts off power to selected service areas for 3 minutes to two hours at a time. That could cause severe disruptions for res­idential customers, as well as industries. "That wouldn't come until after 3 percent curtailment and we're talking about no more than 25 percent right now," Watt said. "I think we'll probably be able to avoid getting to that level." Another ticklish question is whether all utilities should be curtailed. Northern Indiana Public Service Co.-has more than an adequate of coal now but if curtail­

ments were ordered statewide NIPSCO might be requ.ired to share its wealth with other utilities such as Public Service Indiana. This is similar to the winter Of 1977, when natural gas supplies were shifted to 
the  most  critically  short  areas  
including northern Indiana.  
But NIPSCO  might ask,  "why  

should we penalize our customers because we were better 'prepared," Watt said. "And when you understand that SO percent of NIPSCO's total load is in five steel plants, you can understand their predicament." 


Enforcing curtailments is dif­ficult and in some cases impos­sible. Only major users of electric­ity can be monitored leaving res­idential customers on an honor system. 
For those who can be monitored the curtailment would be a per­centage of a base usage figure, probably an average amount of kilowatts used 'per week. For example, a utility might tell the customers it could use no more than 65-75 percent of that average. 
The most likely possibilities for enforcement, Watt said, are higher prices as a penalty for all power used above the limit of a total cutoff until the next week. Watt said he ·Jeans toward the cutoff because the pricing penalty would not achieve the ultimate objective -to save coal.

Approximately 700 students went on last year's USC trip McKenna said they expect at least that many ·this November. "Southern Cal trips always get the most people. It's become a university tradition to go to Southern Cal and in a general poll of both schools we found that most kids wanted to go there. That's why we just went ahead and made the plane. It would have complicated things too much to bring it to a vote," he explained. 
Anyone planning on going to USC next Thanksgiving must submit a $50 nonrefundable deposit by the end of April. At that time you must declare with whom you wish to room and share a car while in California. Although these choices should be final, adjustments may be made in the fall if necessary, McKenna said. 
The balance will be due by Sept. 15. 
Further information on the paying of deposits will be forthcoming later in the semester. 
SMC to offer freshmen retreat 
''A Time To Be Me '' is the theme of a retreat offered to all St. Mary's freshmen Sunday from 3-6 p.m. in the Regina basement auditorium. 
Fr. Edward Krause, from Saint Mary's Campus Ministry, will cel­ebrate Mass and conduct a homily­discussion. Sr. Katherine Reichert, chairman of Campus Ministry, will then hold a conference. A buffet dinner will be served afterwards. 
"I think it will help the freshmen to take the Lenten season more seriously," Krause stated. "Hope­fully it will be a fruitful experience, and aid them in deciding what sacrifices they should make." 
Freshman Trida Burke headed the committee responsible for org­anizing the retreat.

Dear Editor: 
I would like to commend all south jining hall workers-student, full­time staff, and administrative employees-who put forth great effort to keep the dining hall in operation during the recent bliz­zard. Most full-time employees were unable to report to work due to the impossible road conditions. The south dining hall lacked the staff necessary to maintain opera­tion. 
In order to fulfill the demand of the Notre Dame community, the few full-time employees available were requested to work overtime. They worked steadily and untir­ingly. In addition, all student employees were called upon to help 
where necessary. Student re­sponse was encouraging. Emplo­yees volunteered unlimited time. They did everything from filling salt shakers to making pizzas, in addition to their own job assign­ments. Money did not seem to be a prime consideration as some of the jobs, such as washing employee jackets, were done on their own time. They worked out of necessity and consideration for others. It was refreshing to see such spirit. Their attitude did much to reaffirm my faith in mankind. 
Gratitude is extended to the student coordinators who worked over-time to organize the workers and oversee all operations. They did an impressive job. Equally impressive was the dedication and diligent work of the south dining hall administrator, Mr. Carson Wells, and Managers Mr. Robin­son and Mr. Smith. These men responded willingly and compe­tently to the situation. I appreciate a job well-done by everyone involved.

Letters to a Lonely God 
The Flight Patterns Of The Trade Winds 


It is the evening of Ash Wednesday, and I am tired. When I came into my room a little while ago, I found my dog, Darby O'Gill, trying to make love to a wax unicorn. Unicorns are mythical animals, but there is nothing mythical about a wax ear. I fear there is a wax ear now making 
its home in Darby's stomach. Also, a little wind-up toy of Woodstock has teeth marks in its plastic sides, and there is a devirginated pillow whose cat and mouse characters should be blushing with put­rage, the victims of the passions of a lonely dog. 
"Oh, Darby, Darby," I say, taking him on my knee for a talk. "No comfort is to be found in creatures of plastic or wax, and a flesh and blood dog can never find true happiness with a pillow." I should be angry with O'Gill, but it is not easy to be angry with a small beastie who has been deceived by mere appearances. Often enough, I have been deceived by mere appearances myself. Mere appearances can be very deceptive; and when you're just a dog, a plastic Woodstock is a bird worth tailing; if unicorns must come as wax or myth, wax needs watching, because there is no way you can stomach a myth. 
Darby appears to be listening, but from the way his eyes gaze off, I suspect he is waiting to have a go at the unicorn's other ear. He is not really grateful for my trying to save him from mere appearances. 
As I said before, it is Ash Wednesday, 
and I am tired, and as I sit, trying to warn 
Darby against the glint and glitter of. 
things, I think of another conversation held 
an hour earlier, that made me realize how 
difficult it is, as a klutzy cleric, to gaze into 
the heart of truth. 
"The problem with religion," the young 
man of the conversation had said, "is that 
God always makes you feel so inade­
quate.'' 
"Well," I said, "maybe God knows 
something we don't know." 
"Obviously, He does," the young man said. "Obviously, He would be an interesting person to talk to, all three of Him; knowing the real age of the universe, and the flight patterns of the trade winds, from Eastport to Sandy Hook.'' 
''The flight patterns of the trade winds,'' I said, "from Eastport to Sandy Hook, seems like information that the weather man might have. My grandfather, the New England sea captain, could have told you about the trade winds from Eastport to Sandy Hook." 
"Your grandfather, or anybody's grand­father, sounds more interesting than the God I get to hear about at Mass every 
"Liturgy never brings me to a point ·-,here I can talk comfortably with the Lord about the things I really need to hear. ·I am always using Isaiah's words, or the Psalmist's words, or the Campus Mini­stry's words to tell God how .I am a worm and a schlmiel and an ingrate, grinding widows and orphans into the dust. I've never ground down any orphans. My own mother is a Widow; and if anything happened to her, I would be an orphan myself. I wouldn't stand for anyone grinding down widows and orphans." 
My God has died upon the cross; and in slums and gh~ttoes, the nails are being driven through sinless hands and blameless feet. 
Sunday morning," the young man said. "Maybe I could spend my Sunday morn­ings with your grandfather?" 
I raised my eyes to the sky, as though to indicate that Grandpa was now sailing with the Galilean fishermen on the glassy sea that has no winds. 
''The reason w'ny God makes me feel inadequate," said the young man, "is that all the churches ever talk about is sin. How can I Jove God--how can I believe God loves me--if the only subject of conversation between us is how sinful I am, and how perfect He is." 
"Benjamin Franklin," I replied encou­ragingly, "once remarked that he was confident when he met the Almighty, God would greet him the way_ in which one gentlemen always greets another. No prodigal's homecoming for old Ben." 
"Even'if you did," I said, "nobody's perfect.'' 
"I'm not perfect," the young man said· humbly, "but if God is my Father,must I always--if we're to get alon_g--be telling him what a horse's ass I am?" _ 
"There is an experience that men have with God," I said, "when they talk with him familiarly as a friend: saints caught up to the third heaven; mystics gazing into God's holy face. Afterwards, in trying to report their experience, they always say that words fail them. They know neither the language nor the metaphors to describe for us what God, or the experience of God, is like." 
"I would just like to ask God questions," the young man said. "I'm tired of a religion that is all guilt, and no answers." 
It is Ash Wednesday, and I am tired. In four different .liturgies today, I have proclaimed a day of fast, and imposed ashes signifying the mortality of:sinful men. Compared with the truth to be revealed in the heart of light, I know I am a shadow ministering unsubstantial symbols unto the shadows that live mortally in flesh. When you are tired on Ash Wednesday, it is easy to feel like a minister of the mere appearances of things, in a faith that is all guilt and no answers. 
I say to Darby, still on my knee: "You are deluded by plastic and wax in the shape of Woodstock and unicorns. ·I look on the shape of a crucifix and say it is Christ's body broken by my sin. Is the priest any smarter than the pooch?" Darby makes no answer. He merely closes his eyes and goes to sleep. 
On Ash Wednesday, tired from remem­bering that man is dust, I am discouraged from the evidence of mere appearances. It is clear to me that man is dust: a student died last week, a friend was buried two weeks ago, and somewhere a baby struggles to live through the night. My God has died upon the cross; and in slums and ghettoes, the nails are being driven through sinless hands and blameless feet. 
It's hard to believe that even for God, Easter has come. Until I share Easter, my ministry (as the young man said) must always seem more effective as a witness to man's misery than to God's glory. 
Ifonly Darby could become a part of the unicorn myth, meeting the horned beast in its own graceful haunts, he would realize how wax can lie. Ifonly Woodstock were Darby's little friend rather than Snoopy's little friend, how watchful Darby would be about the birds he makes love to. Ifonly I, as a priest, knew heaven, rather than the shadows and appearances of heaven, maybe I could tell the young man (who would be an orphan, if he didn't have a mother) whether God in His glory talks to his angels and saints about the real age of the universe and the flight patterns of the trade winds, from Eastport to Sandy Hook. 
John Trauolta and Saturda!J Night Feuer 
Saturday Night Fever, now playing at the River Park, is an entertaining and unpretentious film about the maturation of a young man in a lower middle class section of Brooklyn. The young man's name is Tony Manero and the world he lives in is filled with violence, easy sex, cheap booze and little else. Tony seems content with this life because he commands his friends' respect and is idolized by his peers, but this life is headed nowhere and he knows it. Thus, the 'Fever' Tony gets on Saturday night is not dancing fever but the restless urge to drop everything and leave it all behind. Yet because Tony isn't that strong he opts to go through the motions of a 9 to 5 job and then on Saturday retreats into the fantastic world of a futuristic dance hall. 
John Travolta, in his first starring role, plays the part of Tony Manero and his screen debut is nothing short of stunning. He simply overpowers the audience with his animal magnetism and vicious inten­sity. The film has already made him one of Hollywood's hottest properties and with the way he fills up the screen it's not at all surprising. From the very first moment you see him stroll down the street in the movie's opening scene you feel you are in the presence of a 'star.' 
The fact that John Travolta can act might come as a bit of a shock to those who have seen him in the role of the amiable imbecile on Welcome Back Kotter, but in Saturday Night Fever, Johnny shows he can do more than just mug outrageously; he shows he can act, and act intelligently. His tony Manero is an incredible blend of swagger and uneasiness, arrogance and compas­sion. In the hands of a lesser actor, Tony might have become an insufferable bore but Travolta's interpretation gives Tony a certain dignity that belies all the superficial pomposity. For' Tony Manero is not an insensitive disco idol (as the advertise­"'"nts for the film suggest) but a confused and inarticulate young man trying to make some sense of his life and failing at every turn. Travolta projects this confusion, this aching vulnerability, this inarticulate sensitivity so deftly it almost reminds one ofBrando's Terry Malloy. He is that good. 
When we first meet Tony he is strutting down the street as if he owns it. Dressed in black leather boots, tight form fitting pants and shirt, and a black leather jacket, he walks resolutely, with his head thrown back so that the girls might get a better look at him. He seems almost out of place amid the dull and monochromatic struc­tures of lower Brooklyn. 
It is with a kind of shock that we witness Tony suffer the indignity of being spurned by a lovely young girl he tries to pick up, and then the embarassment of being yelled at by his employer when he is late returning a can of paint. Tony Manero may look and act like a movie star but he is only a young, underpaid assistant in a hardware store. 
He lives with his parents in an undistin­guished two-story house. Tony's father is an unemployed construction worker who hates his son's guts and his mother is a religious fanatic who crosses herself every­time someone mentions her older son, Frank Jr., who is a priest. The parents are overdrawn but thankfully we see little of them for Tony is not often at home. He is either out cruising in a beat-up automobile looking for kicks or perfecting his dance steps in a local studio. 
Tony, you see, likes to dance. In fact, he lives only to dance. Nothing else matters to him; not cars, not money, not even girls. He is the best dancer in the neighborhood and he lives only for Saturday night when he can go down to the local disco with his friends, strut his stuff, and leave all the hassles of . day-to-day living behind. For one night of the week Tony Manero is a star. 
In the surreal world of flashing, multicolored lights and manufactured mist, Tony and his gang are the center of attention: girls come up to him and beg

him to dance; boys murmur deferential greetings when he walks past: and everyone moves back to give him the dance floor when he decides to take over. And take over Tony does, because the kid can dance. Spinning, strolling, strutting across the floor, Tony mesmerizes his audience with his incredible agility. Flanked on every side by dozens of people applauding his every move, Tony feeds the fever that has been building in him all week. 
The music, the dancing, the ambience of the disco are all stunning. Director John Badham truly creates a surreal world in which time and reality appear to be absent. 
One can understand why Tony longs to return here every Saturday night. But Tony also lives in the real world six days a week, and it ~ the problems that he

sense of values. He is even able to make us believe that he can fall in love with a shallow woman named Stephanie (Karen Gorney) who never shows him one moment of compassion. Thus in one of the film's most moving scenes, the audience discov­ers that Tony is in love with Stephanie not when they are dancing, or making love, but when he is telling her about the Verrazano bridge. 
They are sitting on a park bench on the Bay River Parkway, looking out on the Hudson and the bridge. Tony is telling Stephanie everything about the structure, how many miles of cable were used in its construction, how much concrete was poured, etc., when suddenly he shrugs his shoulders in self-conscious embarrass­ment, realizing he must be. boring her.

encounters here that force him to reevalu­ate his life. Unfortunately, Badham is not as dexterous at handling narrative as he is -at evoking atmosphere and Fever almost sinks amidst a number of banal subplots. There is the obligatory fight scene with the rival gang, complete with the tag-along member of the outfit who gets killed trying to prove himself, and the young girl who wants to be a woman; all cliches but all redeemed by the power of Travolta's performance. Travolta transforms these potentially embarassing scenarios into backdrops in front of which he can movingly reassess his sense of self and his

Curtailing his monologue, he searches for something to say to her, but all he can manage is the horrifying story of a man who fell off the bridge while he was pouring concrete. After recounting this story, Tony looks at Stephanie to see if she notices his nervousness, and with some­thing between a frown and a grin, adds: "That dumb f---," almost as if to say "yeah, I'm the dumb f---for talking about all this garbage when all I wanted to do was tell you I love you, but I'm too stupid.'' 
A beautiful scene in an honest a:ad enlightening film. Look out for John Travolta, he's a comer.

Senate proposal to restrict intelligence tactics 
[AP]  A Senate committee issued a blueprint for U.S. intelli­gence gathering yesterday which would legally bar the use of assassination and terrorism and prohibit CIA efforts to overthrow "democratic" governments. 
The draft proposal, certain to be subjected to months of hearings and debates was issued by the Senate Intelligence Committee in an attempt to place the FBI and CIA under new charters with specific guidelines and restraints and criminal and civil penalties for violations. 
Entries due for film contest 
The deadline for entries in the fifth annual Academy Student Film Awards competition is Saturday, April I. 1978, according to Anthony Loeb, regional coordinator. 
Loeb, chairman of the film department at Columbia College, urged young filmmakers interested in the competition to write him at 600 S. Michigan Ave .. Chicago, IL 60605, for entry forms. If there are questions. he can be reached at (.112) 663-1600. 
The Student Film Awards com­petition, designed to recognize outstanding achievement in film production by college students, is a program of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Academy foundation. and is co­sponsored by American Telephone and Telegraph Company. 
Student filmmakers residing in Indiana, Illinois. Iowa, Wisconsin. Minnesota. and Michigan are eli­gible to enter the regional competi­tion and compete for cash awards and trophies to be awarded by the Academy for outstanding achieve­ment in four categories: animated, · documentary, dramatic, and exper­imental. 
To be eligible, films must have been completed after April l, 197':', · in a student-teacher relationship within the curriculum of an accr dited college or university. Fil. of any length in 16, 35, or 70 mm may be submitted. Eight mm films may be considered in the regional competition. but must be converted to a larger format in order to be eligible for the finals. 
Following regional selections, Loeb said that the semi-finalists will compete against films selected in eight other regions, and will be judged by the Academy's voting membership of film industry pro­fessionals. Winners will be announced on May 21, 1978, in ceremonies at the Academy's head­quarters in Beverly Hills. 
Film series to highlight women & law 
"Women and the Law," a film series sponsored by the Women's Rights A'>!>ociation, will begin this Monday night with "A Historical Overview ( 1870-1921)." The films will be shown from 12:30 to I pm each Monday through May 1 in Rm. 105 of the Law School. 
The series is termed ''A Video Course in Color." Future film topics include rape, the juvenile justice system, marriage. divorce,
... 
and welfare. 


Reps elected to SMC assembly 
Three new members of the St. Mary's Stu?ent Assembly were chosen in special elections held Wednesday. Lisa Rossi and Jannis Warner represent Holy Cross while Justin Shepard is from Regina. The elections were held to fill three vacancies in the assembly. 
Maria-Lisa Mignanelli, Election Commissioner, commented that turnout was small but this is probably because it was a special election at an unusual time." She hopes, however, ''that there will be a 100 percent turnout for the 
elections in April." 
' " 
.......... 
headed by Sen. Walter D. Huddle­ston, 1-KY, the draft bill reorgan­izes the intelligence community by law in a manner similar to that laid out by a recent executive order issued by President Carter. 
The director of central intelli­gence, currently Adin. Stansfield Turner, is promoted to director of national intelligence, a position which makes him in effect chair­man of the board of the intelligence communitv. _ 
Under the proposal, the new national intelligence director would 
be appointed to  a,  six  year  term  
which  would  be  rene wable  only  
once.  

He would have final authority for 
the budgets of all intelligence agencies and responsibility to set the nation's intelligence goals and missions. One of the basic princi­ples of the proposal is that intelli­gence agencies must have evidence that a U.S. citizen or resident alien has violated the law before an investigation can be opened inside the United States. 
It also proposes than an intelli­gence agency must obtain a war­rant before engaging in wiretap­ping or mail opening. The Ameri­can Civil Liberties Union hailed these and other provisions of the proposal saying they provide a good starting point for further improvements. 

WOMEN. YOU'RE EQUAL IN THE AIR FORCE. 
But its authors immediately acknowledged disagreements remain and that the draft proposal will be criticized both as too restrictive and too permissive. 
Sen. Birch Bayh, D-IN, chairman of the committee, said that intro­duction of the charter legislation means that Congress wants to give our intelligence agencies a clear mandate to carry on their essential work under the rules of law. 
Although the report gave no reason for specifying the illegality of overthrowing "democratic" governments, it was seen as a committee effort to leave a loophole in the plan that could allow future action against unfriendly non­democratic countries. 
The CIA has in the past been accused of attempting to assassin­ate Cuban President Fidel Castro and with participating in the 1973 overthrow of the democratically elected government of Chilean Marxist Salvador Allende. 

The draft bill bars the "paid" use by · intelligence agencies of journalists, missionaries, or pro­fessors and students. It does not prohibit voluntary cooperation from such persons. 
It also prohibits activities inten­
ded or likely to create mass destruction of property, epidemics or shortages of food or water.

r Meyer is an ideal student-athlete 
by Frank LaGrotta Sports Writer 
Vince Lombard: called them, 
"guys with an equal dose of brawn 
and brains." At Notre Dame 
they're refered to as "scholar 
athletes." The guy whose perfor­
mance is always top-notch whether 
it comes in the classroom or in the 
athletic arena. 
Mike Meyer fits the description 
like a glove. A stand-out performer 
for the Irish track team in the p 
discus-throwing and shot-put e­
vents, Meyer's "track record': with 
the books is equally impressive. 
With three years logged under the 
Golden Dome he's compiled a 3.5 
grade point average and was 
seriously considered for a Rhodes 
Scholarship this year. 
"I applied for a Rhodes Scholar­ship in the state of Indiana early last fall," relates Meyer, "I knew that 25 people had applied and aonly 12 would be granted inter­views.

Irish await DePaul Demons 
by Tim Bourret Sports Writer 
The eleventh ranked DePaul Blue Demons, one of the most improved teams in the country, will challenge fourth ranked Notre Dame this Sunday afternoon at the 
Athletic and Convocation Center. Ray Meyer's club is 19-2 after last Tuesday's 83-58 victory over Duquesne. This is DePaul's finest record at this juncture in the seaon since they won the NIT tournament in 1945. They have a good chance of breaking the DePaul record for victories in a season (22) and of making only their third NCAA tournamnet appearance in the last 18 years. 
A major reason for DePaul's improvement has been the play of Dave Corzine, the Blue Demon All-American candidate at center. This agile 6' II" pivotman has averaged 20.3 points per game and 
11.4 rebounds this season. His biggest improvement has been in field goal percentage, where he boasts a 55 percent figure. He is one of the only players in the country that leads his team in rebounds and assists. 
"David is the key to our team,'' said Ray Meyer, the Blue Demons coach since 1942. "Corzine has become an outstanding offensive player because he has learned to use his strength under the boards. Last season he was shooting too many fallaway jumpers. This year he takes it right ot the hole and is in 
position  for  more  offensive  re­ 
bounds.  He  is  not  afraid  .to  
challenge anyone."  

Corzine has had some fine games with the Irish throughout his four-year career as starting center for DePaul. In 1974, the Blue Demons upset the Irish and Adrian Dantley as Corzine controlled the backboards, grabbing 18 rebounds in a 75-70 DePaul triumph. Last year he scored 16 points in a 76-68 Notre Dame victory over Chicago. 
The second leading scorer and rebounder for DePaul is Joe Pon­setto. Nicknamed ·'The God­father" for his forceful, aggressive style of play, Ponsetto lost 20 pounds since last season when he averaged 12.7 points per game. This year he has improved his scoring average to 14.4 while grabbing 7.0 rebounds per game. Two years ago, in the last meeting in the ACC between the two teams, Ponsetto led DePaul with 20 points and II rebounds. 
Curtis Watkins is the other starting forward. The 6'5" junior scored almost 13 points per game this season and leads the club in free throw percentage with a .870 average. He finished fourth in the country last season when he con­nected on 91 percent of his charity tosses. William Dise, a bearded 6'5" forward from Chicago, will also see a lot of action at forward. He has averaged 9.3 points per game in 1978, but scored a career high of 22 points in the win over Duquesne. . 
Gary Garland is the fourth double figure scorer in DePaul's high scoring (88.1 PPG) starting lineup. Garland, a music major who is the nephew of singer Dionne Warwick, has averaged 13.4 points per game. He also pulls down 5.2 
rebounds per game, a fine figure for a shooting guard. The East Orange, New Jersey native is probably the most improved player on the team. This year he has improved his shooting percentage by ten points and nearly doubled his scoring average. 
Randy Ramsey will be the other back court starter. He seldom shoots, rarely rebounds, but always quarterbacks the offense. He reminds logtime Irish basketball fans of Jackie Meehan. When fire power is needed from the reserves Clyde Bradshaw, a six-foot fresh­man will enter the backcourt. He has averaged 6.8 points per game and is shooting 51 percent in his rookie season. He played an outstanding game against national­ly-ranked Providence, a game won by the Blue Demons 78-68. 
DePaul has won six games in succession since a 80-74 setback at Marquette. The Blue Demon's other Josss was a 68-67 defeat at LSU. In both losses Corzine was not at his best. Corzine scored only 14 points in the Joss to the SEC's third place team, and connected for only 18 . against the defending national champions. Jerome Whitehead scored 25 and easily outrebounded Corzine at the game in Milwaukee. 
Notre Dame is 16-3 and has won its last nin~ games in a row. They have been successful because of their superior balance. In each of the last six games, at least four Notre Dame players have scored in double figures. Last Saturday against Davidson six Irish scored in

i' "People were really surprised that I didn't go on to play coUege

it before, yet place 'last  in  that  
event,  I  can  still  look  on  that  
performance  as  a  personal  vict­ 

ory." Whatever ·Meyer's reasons, no one is more pleased with his decision to compete for Notre Dame than Irish track coach, Joe Piane. "Mike's a perfect team mem­ber,'' Piane points our. "He's an excellent team leader and he does a great job of motivating our younger weight men. He's an extremely sensitive and level-headed ath­lete." 
Based on the intrasquad meet held before Christmas, both Piane and his assistant, Ed Kelly, are confident 
that the Irish can improve on last year's 2-2 indoor dual-meet record. 
"We believe our strong point this season wiii be in the mid-distance and distance events,'' reveals. Piane. "We'll be looking to sopho­more Jay Miranda who has run the 800 M in 1:48.7, as well as sopho­
more Peter Burger and freshman Chuck Aragon for strength in these events. 
In the two-mile event, the Irish will rely on juniors Dennis Vander-Kraats and Steve Welch while 
boasting three fine hurdlers in 
seniors Arnie Gough, Chuck Wills, 
and freshman Ralph Boyd. Sopho~ 
1J10re pole vaulter Perry Stow who ·holds the Notre Dame school record in this event at 16 feet, will be a solid entry in that contest, while Meyer and junior Tom Ferenc will handle the shot put chores. 
The team's attitude, Meyer points out, is excellent. Squad morale is something he is responsible for as he and junior runner Dennis Van­dekraats serve as the team's co­captains. Meyer sees his role in that capacity as "an arbitrator" of sorts. "Track,'' he explains, "is somewhat of a 'fractured sport' in that it is a team of individuals who direct their efforts towards excel­lence in one particular event. 
"Obviously, when you are dealing with a large group of people you're going to encounter disagreements. I try to help solve these problems by bringing them to the attention of the coaches. Of course, my job is made easier by the fact that both coaches are willing to listen to any suggestions Dennis or I may make." 
With a double major in English and Philosophy. Meyer is contem­plating graduate work in Philo­sophy, Meyer is contemplating graduate work in Philosophy, per­haps at Berkeley or the University of Chicago. 
"Getting my PhD,'' he explains, ''will prepare me for a career in education, politics, the media or perhaps the legal profession. These are all areas which hold my interest." 
With a lar.ge range of interests and an overdose of "brawn and brains" it isn't hard to guess that success looms large in Mike Meyer's future.
