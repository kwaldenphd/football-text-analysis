Season-high ejected from football game 
Throwing of snowballs, marshmallows possible causes for high number of ejections 
By JOHN-PAUL WITT News Writer 
A season-high number of 22 people were ejected from the Stadium on Saturday for "vio­lations of Stadium rules," according to Assistant Director of Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP) David Chapman. 
Which rules were violated and information regarding consequences of the snowball throwing and marshmallow fight was not available as of press time. 
Fourteen people were arrested Saturday on the Notre Dame campus, accord­ing to Chapman. 
"The offenders were trans­ported to the county jail," he said. "One person was trans­ported to the hospital for intoxication." 
At the Stadium, five people were arrested for public intoxication, two for public intoxication and disorderly conduct, one for resisting law enforcement and assault and one for resisting law enforce­ment and disorderly conduct. 
Outside the Stadium, two people were arrested for pub­lic intoxication, one for resist­ing law enforcement and pub­lic intoxication and two peo­ple were arrested for theft. 
The 14 arrests and 22 ejec­tions at the Syracuse game compare to 34 arrests on campus and nine ejections from the Stadium for the first home game against San Diego State University, 29 arrests and two ejections for the

ResLife preps for returnees 
Office says it will try to accommodate wishes 
By LIZ O'DONNELL News Writer 
As students return from their Study Abroad experi­ences next semester, the Office of Residence Life and Housing (ORLH) has been working to ensure students requesting on-campus hous­ing will be able to receive rooms. 
According to the ORLH Web site, Notre Dame's 28 resi­dence halls have space for over 6,200 students. In any normal year, these dorms are completely full during the fall semester, but are only filled to about 95% capacity during the spring semester. 
Scott Kachmarik, associate director of ResLife, said there should be no problem accommodating the students returning to campus for the. Spring Semester. 
"Overall, there will be plenty of room," he said. 
Kachmarik also said there may be issues with over­crowding in specific dorms. 
"There are a few halls that are experiencing a problem of more residents returning than leaving," he said. 
ResLife. however, is work­ing to fix this issue to attempt to accommodate stu­dents who wish to live in a specific dorm. 
"Many of those will be resolved by January and the few that cannot be assigned

Jet pack pilot flies across 1,500-foot-wide canyon 
CANON CITY -A daredevil wearing a jet pack has flown across a 1,500-foot-wide canyon in southern Colorado.

BEIJING -A panda at a zoo in southern China attacked a student who snuck into its pen hop­ing for a cuddle with the endangered bear, state media said on Saturday. 
The 20-year-old male student surnamed Liu jumped over the fence at the zoo in the tourist city of Guilin, ignoring warning signs not to, Xinhua news agency said. 
"The panda, named Yangyang, was wide awake. Apparently scared by the intruder, he bit at Liu's arms and legs," it quoted an unnamed worker as saying after zoo keepers managed to calm the bear and rescue Liu, the report said.

FLEX to create freshmen involven1ent 
New program gives underclassmen opportunity to join class council 
By SARAH MERVOSH 
News Writer 
As a part of his plan to get more freshmen who didn't have the opportunity to join the Freshman Class Council involved in student govern­ment, student body president Bob Reish has implemented a new program called the Freshman Leadership Experience (FLEX). 
FLEX is composed by four committees the Intercollegiate Committee, the Google Apps Committee, the Freshman Booklet Committee and the Legal Services Committee. Each committee is made up of 8 students and has its own project to work on for the year, Reish said. 
The Intercollegiate Committee is working on bring­ing other colleges together to discuss how they integrate freshmen. They are looking at schools that are similar in size, academic standing and reli­gious affiliation to Notre Dame, Reish said. 
FLEX member Meghan Donoghue, who is on the Intercollegiate Committee, said they are also working on mak­ing a "a big flow chart of power from Father Jenkins down" so students know "who's in charge of what." 
"In general, it's really hard to know who to go to if you have an issue," she said. 
Donoghue joined FLEX because she wanted to get involved on campus, and had experience with student gov­ernment in high school. 
The Google Apps Committee is working on informing stu­dents on what Google Apps can do for them, FLEX programmer director Blair Carlin said. 
"They're going to promote all of the things that Google has to offer," she said. "There is so much that the student body doesn't know that can really help them." 
Reish said the Freshman Booklet Committee will put together a booklet of advice from upperclassmen for fresh­men to use. 
Reish gave examples of the type of advice that would be in the book, such as going to the dining hall at certain times that are less crowded or going to one away game a year. 
"It's just advice that you learn throughout the yeats," he said. 
The Legal Services Committee is researching through other universities to gather legal advice for on and off campus, Carlin said. 
"They want to produce a know-your-rights type pam­phlet as well as set up some sort of contact through the law school," she said.  
In addition to working on 
these group projects, Carlin said FLEX will bring people from higher level positions in 
. student government to speak to the group, so that the freshmen can get to know more about what student government has to offer. "We really want to expose them to all the different branches of student govern­ment so that they knew the dif­ferent avenues that they could take and that they weren't just limited to being the president of their class," she said. Donoghue said that she isn't sure if she will run for class council next year, or try some­thing different. ''I'm just waiting to see what intrigues me," she said. While Freshman Class Council is made up of one rep­resentative per dorm, dorms were not taken into considera­tion in the interview process that Carlin conducted. FLEX is meant to be something com­pletely different than Freshman Class Council, Carlin said. Donoghue said that she feels that the members of FLEX are diverse, which is what Carlin intended when she interviewed students. "I didn't want everyone to be the student body president in high school," Carlin said.

CHINA 




China maintains its hold on Tibet 
Associated Press 
XIAHE--Chinese paramili­tary police with riot shields and batons abruptly took up posts Monday on the main street of this Tibetan town, disrupting the bustle of Buddhist pilgrims in a reminder of China's deter­mined control of the region. 
With some Tibetans push­ing harder against Chinese rule, the communist govern­ment is determined to pacify the area. 
The show of force Monday was meant to deter unrest while a local court sentenced a group of Tibetans for tak­ing part in large anti-govern­ment protests in March in Xiahe, a small town abutting a sprawling complex of gold­en-roofed temples. 
Though the verdicts were not publicly announced, the trial also seemed timed to answer the complaints of the Dalai Lama and other exiled leaders meeting in India over the weekend that Tibetans' patience with China's domi­nation was thinning. 
Seven months after Tibetans across western China exploded in the largest 
uprising against Chinese rule in nearly 50 years,-the authoritarian government is adjusting tactics. Police checkpoints and guard posts in place for months are sud­denly dismantled, only to reappear without warning days later. 
"We are in the grip of the Communist Party. Tibet is occupied. The Dalai Lama has fled to India. My heart is sad," said a monk who has studied at Xiahe's Labrang monastery for 15 years and declined to give his name for fear of government reprisals. 
On a spare altar in his small room was a framed portrait of the Dalai Lama. 
Monday's police action in Xiahe came after several weeks in which riot squads had rarely been seen on the streets, residents said. 
Helmeted police with trun­cheons and six-foot-long poles stood outside the courthouse and government buildings. At a checkpoint with sandbags chest high on a bridge, uniformed officers studied identification papers and stopped all but a few dozen vehicles from entering the one-street town.

that's been a issue since I've 
been at Notre Dame," Schmidt 
said. "A lot of students feel that 
it would be a great convenience 
for students to have printers in 
their residence hall." 
Currently, there are Pharos printers in 10 dorms, and the council's resolution recom­mends that printers be added to remaining dorms. The first ten were installed as part of a pilot program. 
Schmidt said while additional printers may be a convenience, his task force came up with multiple arguments in addition to being convenient, stating that the additional printers were "something that students would greatly ap~.reciate for a number of reasons. 
The resolution notes in the recent Student Survey complet­ed by Student Government, 91.1 percent of respondents felt that there was a current need for a printer in their dorm, or they already had a printer located in their dorm. 
The document also states that under current circumstances "some students arc required to walk across campus for printer usage which, depending on the hour of the day or night, leads to safety eoncerns." 
Devin Fee, the Student Senate Campus Technology Committee ehair, said now is a prime opportunity for the installation of more printers in dorms. The University's contract with Xerox expires at the end of the calen­dar year, and Fee said the Office of Information -Teehnology (OIT) and Procurement are negotiat­

ing a purchase of used Xerox 
printers  which  would  be  
installed in dorms.  
The new dorm printers ­ and  

the existing ones -would be maintained by orr as part of the agreement. 
"If we can support OIT on this issue, and get Fr. Poorman's voice on this, it has a pretty high chance of success," Fee said.

Students, staff celebrate Thanksgiving over extended break 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
Notre Dame students will have one more day to enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday, which begins Wednesday, after the University's Academic Council decided in August to extend the break to allow for easier travel. 
Some students will take advantage of the extra day to travel home and visit family. 
Freshman Mary Coyne said she is looking forward to 
Sophomore Yanning Sun, who is from China, said that she will spend part of her Thanksgiving break exploring Chicago and the rest of it on campus. 
''I'm going to Chicago with friends to go shopping, and then I'll come back [to cam­pus] to sleep a lot. If I have time, I'll do homework," Sun said. 
Sun also said she plans to take advantage of the Thanksgiving feast that North Dining Hall will host.

''I'm mostly looking forward to watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade," she said. 
Freshman Ryan Solava said he plans to go back home to the Chicago area for Thanksgiving and will be bringing one of his friends home with him. 
''I'm going back home ... and a friend of mine is staying with me," Solava said. 
Others have decided to stay on campus for the break.

includes traditional favorites such as candied sweet pota­toes, mashed potatoes and butternut squash. 
Patterson also said they will prepare gravy, green bean casserole and julienne carrots for the approximately 1,300

Patterson said he did not think the longer break would affect the number of guests that would eat Thanksgiving dinner in the dinning hall. 
"I think it will be the same base of people -those that live too far away to go home. We also get a lot of guests, faculty and staff who come in," he said. 
Patterson said the Dining Hall staff tries to vary its Thanksgiving menu each year. 
"We try to put a different spin on it every year," Patterson said. "In a way it's routine but in a way it's not. We try to perfect it every year." 
Patterson said much of North Dining Hall's staff began preparing the Thanksgiving meal at 5:30 
a.m. last Saturday.

''I'm looking forward to not going to classes," Wenger said.

Venezuelan opposition gains votes 
CARACAS, Venezuela -Modest opposi­tion gains in state and local elections, cou­pled with sagging oil prices, could hamper President Hugo Chavez as he lays the groundwork for a new attempt to persuade Venezuelans to do away with term limits. 
The opposition won five of 22 states up for grabs, including the two biggest ­Miranda and Zulia -as well as mayoral races in the two largest cities. 
The opposition's gains, however, did not dampen Chavez's ambitions. 
"We've handed them a new defeat ... and a big one," Chavez said at a news confer­ence Monday night, calling the results "a great revolutionary victory." 
lie said Sunday's vote showed that Venezuelans want him to press ahead with his socialist policies, and he has hinted at a renewed effort to make constitutional changes that could expand his powers and let him run for re-election in 2012 and beyond. 
Bomber targets Green Zone 
BAGHDAD -A woman hiding a bomb under her long robe blew herself up Monday · among Iraqis waiting to enter the U.S.-protect­ed Green Zone, where lawmakers plan to vote this week on a pact that would let American forces stay in Iraq for up to three more years. 
The morning attack in central Baghdad killed seven people, by an Iraqi count, and came about 45 minutes after a bomb destroyed a minibus carrying Trade Ministry employees in the eastern part of the capital. At least 13 people died in that blast, most of them women; some of the bodies were burned so badly that authorities could not immediately identify them.

Defense rests in Myspace trial 
LOS ANGELES -The defense in the MySpace hoax trial rested Monday with­out calling a Missouri mother to testify on her own behalf, instead relying on her tearful daughter to direct blame else­where for an Internet ruse that allegedly led to a teenage girl's suicide. 
The case neared closing arguments with 

U.S. District Court Judge George Wu yet to rule on a defense motion for dismissal on grounds that Lori Drew, 49, could not be held responsible for violating the serv­ice rules of the MySpace social network­ing site because there is no proof she ever read them. In comments to lawyers, the judge cited a rule under which he may wait until after a verdict to rule on the motion. 
Suicide broadcast on webcam 
MIAMI -The father of a college student whose suicide was broadcast live over a web­cam said Saturday he was appalled by the virtual audience that egged on his son and called for tougher regulation of Internet sites. 
Abraham Biggs Sr. said those who watched and the Web site operators share some blame in his 19-year-old son's death. 
"I think they are all equally wrong," he said. "It's a person's life that we're talking about. And as a human being, you don't watch someone in trouble and sit back and just watch."

Indiana revisits teenage driving laws 
INDIANAPOLIS -Teenagers would be required to complete at least 50 hours of supervised driving practice and wait longer before getting an Indiana driver's license under a proposed bill unveiled by lawmak­ers Monday. 
The bill, aimed at reducing the number of crashP-s caused by young people, also would ban teen drivers from using cell phones and handsfree devices while driving. Probationary drivers would have to display a placard issued by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles in the rear window of their vehicle. 

Astronauts finish final spacewalk 
Unprecedented clean and lube job completed at international space station 
Associated Press 

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. ­Astronauts successfully car­ried out one last spacewalk Monday, finishing an unprecedented clean and lube job that they began a week ago at the internation­al space station. 
Spacewalker Stephen Bowen wrapped up work on a jammed solar-wing rotary joint as his partner, Shane Kimbrough, squirted some extra grease as a precaution on another joint that is working fine. 
When the repairs to the gummed-up joint were deemed officially complete, Mission Control radioed up its applause. 
"Finally," Bowen exclaimed. "Thanks for your work," replied Mission Control, erupting in laugh­ter. 
Just before Monday's spacewalk began, NASA added a 16th day to space shuttle Endeavour's mission. Managers wanted to give the astronauts more time to fix a machine that's supposed to turn urine into drinking water; additional repairs were performed Monday for the fifth day in a row. 
The $154 million recycling equipment was delivered by Endeavour, along with other a test of the newly repaired grease guns 225 miles up.

Biden aide to fill his Senate seat 
Associated Press 

WILMINGTON, Del. -Edward "Ted" Kaufman, a former aide to Sen. Joe Biden, was named Monday by Delaware Gov. Ruth Ann Minner to fill the Senate seat Biden is leaving for the vice presi­dency. 
Kaufman, co-chair of Biden's transition team and an Obama­Biden transition project advisory board member, plans to serve until the 2010 election, when a new sen­ator is elected. He said he is com­fortable stepping down after two years in office. 
"I don't think Delaware's appointed senator should spend the next two years running for office," Kaufman said. "I will do this job to the fullest of my ability, and spend my days focused on one thing and one thing only: serving Delaware." 
Speculation on Biden's successor had centered in recent weeks on his son, Attorney General Beau Biden. But last week the younger Biden announced that he planned to fulfill his National Guard duties and wouldn't accept an appoint­ment to his father's U.S. Senate seat. 
Biden is a prosecutor for the 261 st Signal Brigade, which left for Iraq last week. The unit is due back in September 2009, in time for Biden to run for his father's Senate seat. 
The elder Biden said in a state­ment, "It is no secret that I believe my son, Attorney General Beau Biden, would make a great United States Senator just as I believe he has been a great attorney general. But Beau has made it clear from the moment he entered public life that any office he sought he would earn on his own." 
Just before announcing Kaufman as the appointee, Minner acknowl­edged speculation about the younger Biden being picked for the post and said she would have strongly considered him. 
"The fact that Beau Biden is com­mitted to fulfilling his obligation and not seeking appointment to this office tells us everything we need to know about his character," she said. "Should Beau choose to run for this office in 2010, he will -as will whoever runs -have to earn on his own the trust of the people of Delaware."

IN BRIEF Obama announces budget director 
WASHINGTON -President-elect Barack Obama intends to name Peter Orszag as his budget director, Democratic officials said Monday, turning to Congress' chief adviser on spending and taxes as he fills out his economic team. 
Orszag, 39, is serving a four-year term as head of the Congressional Budget Office. 
If confirmed by the Senate, he would head the Office of Management and Budget, the agency that makes sure a president's priorities are translated into spending deci­sions. 
The Democratic officials said Orszag's appointment was scheduled for Tuesday in Chicago, where Obama was holding his sec­ond news conference in as many days. 
Obama announced four members of his economic team on Monday, including Timothy Geithner, currently the president of the New York Federal reserve, to be treasury secretary. 
The officials who described Obama's plans to appoint Orszag did so on condition of anonymity, saying they were not author­ized to divulge his selection before the president-elect announced it. 

GM bails on Tiger Woods' contract 
DETROIT -General Motors is bailing out on Tiger Woods. 
Woods, a global icon in sports with his 14 major championships, has been carrying the Buick logo on his golf bag for the last nine years and still had one year left on his contract. 
But General Motors Corp. was looking to cut costs and hoard cash while trying to survive the worst sales downturn in a quar­ter-century. And it said Monday the world's No. 1 golfer wanted more time for himself, especially with a second child on the way. 
"Timing is everything," said Larry Peck, golf marketing manager for Buick. "We've had such a great partnership with Tiger. It's hard for us to walk away from that. But this frees up time for him. And it sure frees up a lot of money for us." 
The endorsement deal. believed to be worth at least $7 million a year, was to expire at the end of 2009.

Senior legacy options debated 
Unpaid internship 

The senior class has an exiting opportu­nity available to us these next few weeks; voting on what we want to leave behind as our legacy here at Notre Dame when we graduate. The 2009 Senior Class Legacy gives the senior dass the chance to make a major difference in the lives of many stu­dents to follow us. This year we have the option to vote on a new fund for future students that can benefit studenl<> for sev­eral years to come. This is the option of the unpaid internship fund. 
Think back to your past summers of work. You worked full-time hours, gained invaluable experience both in your possi­ble future career and in "real-life." You may have worked side-by-side with the professionals in the firm, sat in on meet­ings, worked on major projects and gained knowledge and skills that you can't learn in the classrooms. 
Now imagine this experience without the pay. Maybe some of you experienced this, or maybe some of you were unable to partake in an internship because the firm couldn't pay you. This is actually a very common dilemma, one that I personally experienced the summer before junior year. This happens across all industries in which the expertise and ideas of interns are highly valued, yet the funds simply are not available. 
The unpaid internship fund can make all the difference of those students. It is a fund that would support students in unpaid summer internships via an award that would go toward paying expenses during the internship. This provides stu­dents previously unable to gain this work experience the opportunity to build their resumes and make them a more mar­ketable student upon graduation. I think this program is the best way that our sen­ior class can give back to this University that has given us so much. It will be a last­ing legacy that can help so many future students fortunate enough to attend Our Lady's University.

Community service 
Seniors, it's time to decide what we want our class legacy to be. While all three of the available options are great, I believe one of them stands out as the truly com­passionate choice. If we end up selecting the community service option, the pro­ceeds of our legacy will go to the Center for Social Concerns in a special fund ear­marked for local community programs. The CSC will have more resources to devote to its programs focused in South Bend, including community-based learn­ing and research for Notre Dame students, community and economic development programs and partnerships with local coalitions for social change. It seems that this year more than ever I hear our class­mates worrying about how dangerous this town is and how unsafe they feel off-cam­pus. 
Pair that with all the anti-Notre Dame sentiment you find on the South Bend Tribune's website, and the tension between students and city residents is pal­pable. The disconnect between the University and the city seems obvious to us, and we finally have an opportunity as a class to do something tangible to change it. 
Wishing for a better relationship with the South Bend community gets us nowhere -it's time to realize that the South Bend community is our community too. 
So when you vote for our class legacy, please vote to give our gift to the Center 
for Social Concerns. The Class of 2009 can 
give a gift that benefits not only future 
Notre Dame studenl<> but also the entire 
city of South Bend.

EcoFund 

In light of Notre Dame's recent elforl<> to address sustainability on campus, last year's Senior Legacy establishing the EcoFund was appropriate and eflective. The point of a Senior Legacy is to create an impact lasting far longer than our four years at this University. That's also what sustainability is all about and why the Class of 2009 should continue to support the EcoFund. 
The EcoFund enables students, faculty and stafl' to take ownership over their original ideas and turn them into projecl<; that contribute substantially to campus sustainability efforts. For example, the EcoFund could support the goals of both of the other Legacy options -pursuing an unpaid internship about energy or envi­ronmental issues, or supporting the sus­tainability work of the CSC in South Bend or around the world. 
Our class has contribut1~d substantially to sustainability at Notre Dame-and the EcoFund is a wonderful way to leave our fmal mark. Energy and climate change issues will impact each of us in our per­sonal and professional lives. Let's set the right kind of precedence at Notre Dame.

Consider train travel 
Thanksgiving is right around the cor­ner. Chances are good that you, like millions of other Americans, will be going home for the long weekend. Chances are also good that you will be either flying or driving. Unless you live within a couple hour's drive, your trip will probably be uncomfortable, expen­sive, stressful and it will probably involve a delay. It will also emit a lot of Carbon Dioxide and other pollutants, in addition to the more aesthetic problems of noise and light pollution that these modes of transportation foster. 
It does not have to be like this though; there is a third option: rail travel. Trains are a very comfortable, incredi­bly efficient mode of transportation, and they can be made extremely fast, reli­able and comparatively cheap. 
Many Americans have never even rid­den on a train. They do not consider trains when making travel plans. Even though I have had experience with com­muter rail and subways all my life, I never really considered long-distance rail until this fall, when my CSC Energy Policy Seminar took the Capitol Limited to Washington, DC for Fall Break. The trip was incredibly comfortable -we had at least three feet of legroom in coach (first class passenger had full sleeper compartments) and access to a 
full lounge car. My flight for 
Thanksgiving has been booked for 
months, but after my Fall Beak journey 
I have been looking at Amtrak timeta­
bles for future trips. 
Trains are far lighter on the environ~ ment than other modes of transport. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, trains are the most effi­cient mode of transport in terms of emissions per passenger. Electric trains can be powered by renewable sources of power such as wind. Additionally, rail lines take up far less space than a road carrying an equivalent amount of traffic would. 
America's rail network was once the envy of the world, providing safe, reli­able and fast access to virtually every town of any size. Rural areas currently without airports nearby enjoyed regular service, and mail and freight moved at least as quickly as today aboard special­ized trains. We let it decline after World War II though, putting our faith in auto­mobiles, the purchasing, maintenance and fueling of which, according to rail­road historian John Stilgoe, places an unsustainable burden on many American families. Having been raised in a car culture, many people see trains as relics of the past. 

This is changing though. Cities such as Denver and St. Louis, have recently installed popular light-rail networks, and Amtrak has introduced new rail routes extending service into Maine by popular demand. New Jersey Transit reported a 6 percent increase in com­muter rail ridership in 2007. Calif<>rnia recently passed a ballot initiative pro­posing a high-speed rail network link­ing the major cities in the state. Many European countries have had high­speed rail for over a decade which have become accepted as the preferred mode of transportation for trips under 500 miles in length. 
For decades, America was at the fore­front of railroad innovation, inventing high-speed rail with creation of stream­liners in the 1920s. Famed trains such as the Santa Fe's Super Chief and the New York Central's 20th Century Limited are still remembered today for their speed and luxury. Rail was once known to all as "the way to travel," and it still is; we just need to remember it.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Get your head in the ga111e 
So here is what Charlie had to say after the game. I'm not making a case for or against his firing. This article might be emanating from my severe frustra­tion with this day and with Weis. The game itself was a disaster, and it was my mistake to watch the press conference. And before you jump at me and defend Weis. read the entire article. I have quoted nothing out of context. I just want to make sure that people are aware of what the Head Coach of Notre Dame thinks after a loss to Syracuse. Here are some exact quotes from his press conference. In parentheses is what I get out of it. 
"We challenged the one play, which ... you know we don't have replays here" (So you challenged with­out any legitimate certainty.) "But I was fairly confi­dent that he had his toe inbounds" (You were confi­dent. Hence it must be the case. How far from the play were you?). 
"I know Pat [Kuntz! had to eall the time-out in the second half; I'm not exactly sure why at this point" (Do you know now Charlie, or not yet?) 
"At the end of the day, they had to go down the field and score two touehdowns, and give eredit to Syracuse -they did too." (That's exaetly what I need ... a head coaeh giving credit to the 19.5 point underdog ranked 1 08th in the eountry and who got blown out by Rutgers-don't even give me the respecting the other team nonsense.) 
"That [53-yard field goall was right on the cusp of his distance." (Haha ... good one) 
"I truly separate myself from feeling bad for me. I really only worry about them I the players]. I worry about those kids and their families. I worry about my coaehes and their families. I worry about my wife and kid. But I don't worry about my mentality." 
(What about the fans Charlie? Do you worry about them? Do you worry about the 80,000 people at the stadium who pay to see Notre Dame Football, and the 2 million fans that wateh on TV?) "I don't feel miserable for me." (Well maybe you should.) 
 "Jimmy did not make the big mistake we've had the last eouple of weeks. l-Ie was a lot more effieient at what he was doing." (18 ineompletions, a 17-yard sack, accomplishing nothing in the red zone ... that's the definition of efficiency.) 
Three questions about the future of Notre Dame football and his job status: "I don't like answering big picture questions like that without doing some seri­ous reflecting on what I think is the appropriate answer." (Ok, I buy the spur of the moment aspeet, but you have seven years left on your ten-year eon­tract. As of now, you are the big pieture. Might wanna start thinking about stuff like that.) 
So ... no mention of any hope for the future of the program. Just ignoranee. No motivation, no inspira­tion, no passion, no emotion. After a loss like this, I personally want a coach who keeps his head up, acknowledges mistakes and says something about getting better results. One whO-offers even a hint of an apology to the fans. Not one who tells me Jimmy Clausen was efficient. Not one who thinks the 53­yard line is Brandon Walker's target line. Not one who ignores arguably the most signifieant questions of the press eonference. 
I mean, e'mon Charlie. Syraeuse?

To the stadiu111 ushers 
Thank you kindly for your vigilant removal of so many hostile student snowball throwers. 
When I was a young boy, I was hit in the head with a snowball by some sehool yard bullies. The pure shame alone was unbearable, not to mention the multiple surgeries I had to undergo to correct the injury. This act in whieh, during winter season, many festive youth demonieally take joy is a state­ment to eaeh victim, "We do not like you; we think you are a loser." 
Sure I eould have taken it lightly and assumed that it's not malicious and just for fun; but dearly snowball throwing is a hateful, wicked attempt to single out a person and defile, embarrass and hopefully maim them. I can only plead that for the next big quad snowball fight, we bring in SWAT and not only save some lives, but perhaps even save some poor students' self-worth. 
Satire aside, it is unfortunate that some of our players were hit. I hope this was aeeidental given the weakness of aeeuraey for even the soberest, most discerning snowball thrower. On the other hand, that trooper getting smoked in the head was hilarious. I fmally learned what he and his posse contribute to the game and sehoul. Their eagle eye powers which give them superhuman vision to swiftly kick out students who try to hit them with snowballs should make us all feel safe. 
Every home game you attend, eheck your inseeu­rities at the entranee. They see all. It is sad that eritics and disgruntled alumni are questioning the students' pride in and support of our team and school just bee a use of some thrown snowballs. While the students at very good football sehools hardly make it to the games, nearly every Notre Dame student attends every home game, stays . standing the entire game and remains to sing the alma mater and victory mareh in honor of the team regardless of weather and the outeome. 
Or perhaps these critics have never stayed until the end of a game and didn't know this.

Jersey chasers need a bye -week 
Several hours following the football game this weekend our friends sat and eontemplated how a team so full of talent eould lose to an abysmal Syracuse team; a team so bad that their eoach had already been fired. 
Some people might think it might be our coaching, and while this might be part of the problem, I still think there is an unremitting X-faetor affeeting the performance of our players. Later that night, we went to CJs Pub and it became painfully obvious what that X-faetor was, positive reinforeement for a miserably pedestrian performanee. 
Don't get me wrong, we know the players were frustrated mourning their loss and eombating low self esteem upon entering the bar. However, their dejection beeomes pacified and inflated egos eome roaring back when several of the most desirable girls that Notre Dame and St. Mary's have to offer are hanging all over them, while the proverbial Joe the plumbers of Notre Dame are anxiously seouring the establishment for a deeent eatch that is either too intoxicated to notice that you're not wearing a Notre Dame football sweatshirt, or doesn't realize that she too could be hanging off the jock strap of a player who has been warming the beneh for the backup long snapper. 
But I digress, we are asking the jersey ehasing women of Notre Dame and St. Mary's, to take at least a week off when we lose to a team like Syraeuse. This behavior is preposterous. I don't pet my dog when he takes a poop in my house. If some­one is not performing to the level that they should, you do not reward their lack luster performance. Let them get angry as they strike out with you. You ean even use clever rhyming eomebacks to deter your unworthy suitors. 
For example: Learn how to block and then I'll toueh your 'soek.' Bring back the fire, and motivate them to play to their potential. It is simple psycholo­gy. Beeause let's faee it ladies, what jersey would you rather ehase, someone on a 6-5 Notre Dame team or a player on a future national championship team with Heisman consideration. 
Plus, there are a lot of other cool jerseys out there. Feneing: awesome. Water Polo: sexy. Wrestling: need I say more? I have a Tony Romo jersey, maybe I would be wise to wear it out next weekend? 
And lastly, feel free to hook up with Golden Tate, he tore it up this Saturday.

We deserve ND 
Dear Ms. Stephan ("Student behavior embarrassing," Nov. 24), 
You have gone too far. I acknowledge that the snowball­throwing wasn't the best thing for Our Lady's PR Department, but you have overstepped the boundaries of this issue. I am referring to your assertion that we, the stu­dent body, "are undeserving of the university so many of us love." Even as a non-snowball-thrower, I am deeply offend­ed. 
I am not quite sure how to respond to your implieation that we do not love our university. To keep it simple, you are wrong. (While I understand you believe our behavior dis­plays a lack of respeet and love, if we really didn't love Notre Dame, we wouldn't have remained in the stadium for the entirety of the game in 18 degree weather.) To assert that we do not deserve this University is the sharpest and most unjust insult you eould have delivered. It is a blatant slap in the faee to anyone, student or parent, who has worked hard and made sacrifices to make this education possible. 
The senior elass, more than any of us, deserves this University. And Saturday night, they deserved a win. You may eriticize our behavior, you may even talk down to us like we are children, but you have no right to tell us that we do not deserve our university. 
Go Irish.

Snovvball stories misleading 
Ms. Stephan's ("Student behavior embarrassing," Nov. 24) and Ms. Wuellner's ("Snowball incident disrespectful," Nov. 24) let­ters yesterday lead me to assume that they were not in atten­dance at the game on Saturday but instead were vietims oftbe irresponsible journalism that reported a relatively innocuous event as an all-out assault on our own football team. 
While the concerns of our alums that the reputation of Notre Dame students may be at stake are well founded, Notre Dame fans have cause to be embarrassed not beeause of their aetions but because of the way they were described by the media. Insinuating that Notre Dame fans were barraging their own team as a result of displeasure with the team's performance­whieh the AP, Ms. Stephan, and Ms. Wuellner are all guilty of­is simply false. Snowballs were being thrown before the game started and lobbed primarily at friends within the section. The snowballs that made their way onto the field were most fre­quently aimed at eameramen and state troopers. The few snow­balls that hit our own players were stupid, dangerous and dis­traeting, but they represented a miniscule pereentage of the snowballs that were thrown and were likely errant throws aimed at Oven-Mitts, cameramen or other non-athletes. 
Expecting college students in the midst of a festive snowy atmosphere not to throw snowballs is absolutely ridiculous. Calling the student body immature is unfounded. Criticize our fan base for leaving the game early. Criticize our fan base for not being loud enough. Criticize our fan base for booing. But please, don't criticize the members of the student body for acting their age and being goofy at a football game. Don't project the behav­ior of three students (the number of snowballs that the AP reported aetually hit Notre Dame players) onto the rest of the student body, especially when your reaetion has been manipu­lated by shoddy and irresponsible journalism and a laek of first­person evidence. 
Finally, please take your energy and emotion and pour it into another letter, this time to your local paper which ran the AP story that falsely represented your alma mater.

It's officially that time or year again. 
No, not Christmas time -yet. No matter what retail giants, overzealous kiddies and that one girl down the hall who hasn't stopped playing Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You" may tell you, it isn't Christmas time just yet. It's close, precarious­ly and delightfully close, but not yet.

That day is Thanksgiving, and it is finally here.

One of Thanksgiving's heartier orferings won't show up on your Grandma's dining room table. Instead, you'll find it in the den or the living room, on your television.

PHILADELPHIA. Penn. ­Donovan McNabb's benching lasted less than 24 hours. 
One day after he got yanked at halftime of a close game, the five-time Pro Bowl quarterback got his job back -for now. McNabb will start when the Philadelphia Eagles host the Arizona Cardinals on Thursday night. 
"Donovan is the quarter­back. I don't want to leave here until you understand that," coach Andy Reid emphasized at his news con­ference Monday. "Donovan is the quarterback for this foot­ball team." 
McNabb was pulled from a game for the first time in his career after two dismal quar­ters in Sunday's 36-7 loss at Baltimore. The Eagles (5-5-1) only trailed 10-7 at the time, but Reid thought second-year pro Kevin Kolb gave the team a better chance to win a game it desperately needed to maintain its slim playoff hopes. 
Kolb played poorly while McNabb watched from the sideline in a hooded jacket and minus the headset back­ups usually wear to assist coaches. 
"Sometimes you have to step back to step forward in a positive way and Donovan will do that," Reid said. "This has nothing to do with Kolb's performance or Donovan's performance." 
The Eagles are on the verge of missing the playoffs for the third time in four years since losing the 2005 Super Bowl. No matter how they finish, this could be McNabb's last season in Philadelphia. 
McNabb, who turns 32 on Tuesday, is signed through 2013, but there's no chance the Eagles will pay him $9.2 million next year to be a backup. He's 22-21-1 as a starter since leading Philadelphia to four straight NFC championship games from 2001-04. 
"As I sit here right now, he's my starting quarter­back," Reid said. "I need to coach better. Donovan needs to play better and the guys around Donovan need to play better." 

McNabb was 8-for-18 for 59 yards with two intercep­tions and a fumble in the first half against Baltimore. Last week, McNabb threw three interceptions and lost a fum­ble in an overtime tie with Oncinnati. Overall, he's com­pleted 58.8 percent of his passes for 2,770 yards, 14 touchdowns, 10 interceptions and a passer rating of81.1 
"I think I know Donovan McNabb better than anybody in this room," Reid said. "I know (seven) turnovers, that's not him. That's no part of his game. You back up an inch and you evaluate it and you should be able to step forward a mile after that." 
IN BRIEF Three perjury charges
dropped against Bonds 
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -Three charges against Barry Bonds were dismissed Monday by a federal judge who left intact most of the indict­ment alleging he lied to a grand jury when he denied knowingly taking performance-enhancing drugs. 
Bonds, baseball's home run king, is scheduled for a March 2 trial. He had faced 14 counts of making false declarations to a grand jury investi­gating steroid use in sports and one count of obstruction ofjustice. 
His lawyers had asked U.S. District Judge Susan Illston to dismiss 10 of the lying charges, claiming he was asked unclear questions in front of the grand jury in 2003. Jllston ruled Monday to dismiss three charges and consolidate or rewrite another two. 
Bonds has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Bonds' lawyer, Allen Ruby, didn't immediately comment, saying had not yet read the ruling. 
Snyder takes up reins 
again at Kansas State 
MANHATIAN, Kan.-After a restless retirement, coach Bill Snyder is ready to turn Kansas State into a winner again. 
Three years after handing off a suc­cessful Wildcats program to Ron Prince, the 69-year-old and wispy-haired Snyder was hired to take charge of the school he transformed from college football's biggest losers to national championship contenders. Prince was fired this month but is completing the season. 
"The Kansas State family is in flux right now," Snyder said at a news con­ference Monday. "I want to be able to help. I want to be able to soothe the waters. I've learned some lessons and there are some things I will do to encompass my family." 
Snyder signed a five-year contract for a base salary of $250,000 and a total compensation of about $1.85 million annually, athletic director Bob Krause said. Krause said he had made no offers to anyone else. 

Cowboys' Jones returns to 
practice after suspension 
IRVING, Texas -Suspended comer­back Adam "Pacman" Jones was back at work with the Dallas Cowboys on Monday, going to meetings and a practice even though he can't suit up until Dec. 7 against Pittsburgh. 
Jones is allowed to do everything but play in the next game-Thursday against Seattle -as he works his way back from his latest suspension, a six-game penalty for violating the league's player conduct policy. He previously was suspended for the entire 2007 season and coach Wade Phillips said Monday it's reasonable to believe another slip-up would get him per­manently banned from the NFL. 
'We've got to hope, for his sake really, that he has cleared all that up," Phillips said. "All the pressure is on him, really, to . do the right thing." 
Jones did not come into the locker room during the 45 minutes it was open to reporters. A team meeting followed, then an extended walkthrough that was closed to media.

Texas 68, St. Joe's 50 
Texas' latest outstanding defensive effort left coach Hick Barnes complaining about the Longhorns' offense. 
A.J. Abrams had 17 points to lead No. 6 T!~xas to a victory over Saint Joseph's on Monday in the opening round of the EA Sports Maui Invitational, but the Longhorns committed 16 turnovers and that's what Barnes wanted to talk about .. 
"We turned it over way too many times. We have to cut that down," he said. "Defensively we gave the effort we wanted and we got good play ofT the bench, but the turnovers were just care­less mistakes. We have got to value the basketball. We're too good a team to score 68 points. We can fix that." 
The Longhorns (3-0) will meet No. 8 Notre Dame, which beat Indiana 88-50, in the semifinals on Tuesday. 
Abrams was 4-for-7 from 3­point range, extending his strong start from beyond the arc as he was 8-for-17 in Texas' first two games. 

The Longhorns had allowed 
44.5 points and 28.7 percent field goal shooting while forcing an average of 22 turnovers in their first two wins. No. 3 looked very familiar. 
Ahmad Nivins had 14 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Hawks (1-2), who finished 17­for-58 from the field (29.3 per­cent). including 4-for-21 from 3­point range, and turned it over 18 times. 
"This team has been really focused on playing defense, try­ing to get stops, and that's a good thing," Abrams said. "On offense we just have to slow down and not play at 100 miles an hour. We have to get efficient and get wide-open shots." 
Saint Joseph's scored six of the final eight points in the first half to pull within nine, but Damion James had seven point<; in Texas' 11-2 run to start the second half. Saint Joseph's missed three of its first four shots in the half and had three turnovers in the open­ing 1:40. 
The Hawks scored seven straight to make it 48-37, but they came up empty on their next eight possessions and Texas had its first 20-point lead, 57-37, on a layup by Gary Johnson with 
8:55 to play. 
"We laced it up and stood toe to toe with a team that in my estimation can be in Detroit in March," Saint Joseph's coach Phil Martelli said, referring to the site of this season's Final Four. "We had too many turnovers from our older guys and the pri­mary ballhandlers and we have to do a better job as we go for­ward. We weren't good enough and that's all right for today." 

James and Johnson both had 14 points for Texas. Johnson led the Longhorns with 10 rebounds. 
Darrin Govens added 12 points for the Hawks, who used a matchup zone to try and handle Abrams. 
"We recognized it and that made it better for us," Abrams said. "We were playing too fast and guys weren't ready for it. We have to get down to 70, 75 miles per hour and read what the defense is giving us." 
This is the Longhorns' third appearance in Maui with their best finish a third in 2004.

NBA 
Yao' s do111inating perfor111ance spells doo111 for Heat 
Jefferson's 25 not enough as Howard, Orlnndo turn back Milwaukee in a match-up between injury-plagued teams 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -Ron Artest is diffi­cult to please. 
After seeing Yao Ming shake ofT waves of defenders in a 28­point, 12-rebound effort that helped the I Iouston Rockets beat the Miami Ileat 107-98 on Monday night, someone asked Artest to assess his center's per­formance. 
"I thought he could have played better," Artest said. The Heat surely wouldn't have wanted to see that. 
Yao shot 9-for-15 from the lloor and seored 19 points in 19 second-half minutes, more than doing his part in keeping the undersized Heat at bay. Miami primarily used 6-foot-8 Udonis Ilaslem -by far, the smallest starting center in the NBA ­against the 7 -foot-6 Yao, along with a steady stream of help from the weak side to get in the Chinese star's way. 
"We did all right, but Yao's Yao," Heat forward Michael Beasley said. "He's 8 feet tall. Ain't much we can do." 
Artest scored 20 and Hafer Alston added 14 points for I louston, which finished with six players in double figures and outrebounded Miami 51-35. Luis Scola had 11 points and 13 rebounds, while Carl Landry and Aaron Brooks each scored 11 for the Rockets, who finished off a 3-0 road trip against East teams. 
Dwyane Wade scored 23 points for Miami, doing so on 7­for-23 shooting, which prompted another quick line from Artest. 
"He played really bad tonight," Artest said. "He didn't play like I'm used to seeing him play." 
Mario Chalmers added a career-best 23 points. including five 3-pointers. for the Heat, who also got 17 points from Shawn Marion. 14 from Beasley and a season-high 12 from Yakhouba Diawara. 
By now. the !!eat are used to dealing with some major lack-of­size disadvantages. 
But facing Yao dearly exacer­bated the issue, something the Hockets happily exploited. Miami would always have someone helping llaslem against Yao. even two people dropping into the lane at times, so the Rockets' center often took what the Heat defense gave and found some­one who was open. 
It wasn't coincidence: With Yao on the floor in the first hall'. the 
Rockets were 5-for-7 on  3-point  
tries, 2-for-4 with him  on  the  
bench.  

"He really docs create a matchup problem down there," llcat coach Erik Spoelstra said. "lie's so ellicient. You can't foul him. it's tough to play in front of him, it's tough to play in front of him. But in the first half, we kind of opened up the door for the 3-point shooting. We didn't close out quite as hard as we have in other instances and they got it going." 
Miami had its moments, though. against Y<w. After he grabbed a rebound in the open­ing minutes, Chalnwrs -who is 17 inehos shorter than Yao ­ran from behind. stripped the ball away. thrm stepped out and hit a :{-pointer. 
Y<w got revtmge on the next trip, rolling to the basket after setting a pick and dunking over Chalmers, who could only shake his head. 
"On this trip, we're finding a way we're going to play basket­ball, (take) advantage of what we have as a team and create open shots," Yao said. 
Miami faced a sizable early deficit for the second straight game, this time an 11-point hole in the opening quarter. But things never got truly out of hand, and when Wade hit the first two baskets after intermis­sion. the Heat found themselves only down 56-52. 
The margin was trimmed to two after a layup by Beasley moments later, but Miami ­which has alternated wins and losses in its last 10 games ­never got closer. 
After Beasley's score, the Rockets went on an 11-0 run, with Yao getting nine of those points. 
He had three-point plays on consecutive possessions, the sec­ond of which actually became a four-pointer when Haslem was called for a technical for arguing that Yao was in the paint far longer than the allowed three seconds. 
"Felt like 10 seconds in the paint to me," Haslem said. "I was guarding the guy all night. I'm conscious of three seconds." 
In the fourth, whenever Miami got close, Houston had an answer, never letting its lead fall below four. And when Alston hit a 3-pointer with 1:47 left to make it 103-93, the outcome was sealed. 
"Another solid win for us," Rockets coach Rick Adelman said. "For the most part, we fol­lowed the game plan on Wade. Ron did a great job just making him work." 
Orlando 108, Milwaukee 101 
Dwight Howard was still standing, and that's all that mat­tered for the Orlando Magic. 
Howard had 24 points and 13 rebounds as the Orlando Magic outlasted the Milwaukee Bucks 108-101 Monday night in a matchup of injury-depleted teams. 
Richard Jefferson scored 25 points to lead Milwaukee, which lost Andrew Bogut to a knee bruise in the third quarter. The Bucks were already missing Michael Redd and Luke Ridnour. their starting backcourt, to injuries. 
Iledo Turkoglu, forced to play some point guard when Jameer Nelson went out with a groin pull, and Hashard Lewis each added 22 points for the Magic. Howard picked up his fourth foul halfway through the third quar­ter but played eight minutes in the final quarter, scoring 7 points but making only 5 of 11 free throws. 
"It was a war of attrition, 
that's what it was. They came in 
here missing guys and we came 
in missing one, then lost one and 
had one in foul trouble. Neither 
tf~am was playing with the guys 
they really wanted to play with 
most of the night." 
Orlando (10-4) led by 12 with just under two minutes left, but poor free throw shooting and Jefferson almost brought the Bucks back. His short jumper with 24 seconds left cut the lead to 103-100, but free throws by Turkoglu and Lewis sealed the win. 
"Some games we just come out and our talent takes us over the edge, but we've got to learn how to play together," Howard said. "Sometimes our talent won't take us that far." 
Milwaukee committed 39 fouls but Orlando made only 38 of 54 free throws. 
"We cannot afl'ord to come out here and try to outscore these guys," Luc Mbah a Moute said. "They have an offense that is more established than our offense. Our main thing is to defend. Tonight we did not do a good job of it." 
Howard made only 10 of 20. "It's every game, so I do worry about that," Van Gundy said. 
Bogut got the better of a matchup of back-to-back No. 1 overall draft picks early. Bogut made a pair of jump hooks over Howard to start the game. He then drew charges for two of the three fouls that sent Howard, the 2004 top pick, to the bench with about seven minutes left in the second quarter. 
Bogut had 16 points and three rebounds in the first. Howard, the No. 1 pick had only four points and six boards. 
In the first three minutes of the second half, Bogut picked up three fouls trying to stop Howard inside, sending Bogut to the bench with four. A minute later, Bogut was taken to the locker room for X-rays. 
"I took a charge in the first half and got a knee," Bogut said. "But I'll be OK." 
Turkoglu hit a 3 at the end of the first quarter to give the Magic a 33-23 lead. Milwaukee cut the lead to six midway through the second quarter, but another basket by Turkoglu gave Orlando a 58-47 halftime lead. 

Both teams have already been hit hard by injuries. The Magic announced earlier Monday that sixth man Keith Bogans would miss at least a month with a bro­ken thumb. 
Redd, out since Nov. 5 with a high ankle sprain, was joined on the inactive list by point guard Ridnour, who suffered a scraped and bruised knee against the Bobcats. Ridnour had missed two games earlier this year with lower back spasms. 

Hedd was averaging 21.3 in four games before his injury. 
"People are saying to us, 'You're coming close to beating good teams, what would take you over the edge?'" Jefferson said. "Those guys might be able to take you over the edge, but that being said, you can't go out there and wait."

Belles open season at 
home against Wheaton 
By ALEX BARKER Sports Writer 
Coming off a one-point loss in the finals of the Anderson University Tip-Off tournament to Robert Morris, Saint Mary's (1-1) looks to rebound in its home opener against Wheaton College Tuesday at 6 p.m. 
Senior forward Erin Newsom who racked up a game-high 26 points to go along with eight rebounds in the loss to Robert Morris leads the Belles this season. Newsom was named to the All-Tournament team for her performance. 
Junior center Anna Kammrath is off to a hot start as well, recording a double­double against Robert Morris and coming just one point short of another in the first game against Ohio Wesleyan. 
Much of Saint Mary's early success thus far has hinged on its domination under the bas­

come to the game to see if we've done our job." 
Notre Dame (12-6-2, 7-2-2 Big East) suffered a 2-1 loss to South Florida in the Big East tourna­ment's semifinals on Nov. 14 but still received a first-round bye in NCAA play as a top-16 seed. The Wildcats (13-4-3, 3-3-0 Big 10) edged Loyola Chicago in penalty kicks Friday after the two teams played to a scoreless draw in the tournament's first round. 
"They're a good team. In the NCAA's, there's not many bad teams, so that's kind of a given," Clark said. 'They're well-rounded and well-coached. It'll be a chal­lenge, but it's not one that's beyond us." 
Northwestern is led by sopho­more Matt Eliason, whose 12 goals and 25 points are both team highs. Junior Misha Rosenthal has started all but one of the Wildcats' games in goal and has posted 12 shutouts and a 45 goals-against average, which ranks seventh in the nation. 
"They're similar to ourselves ­a lot of players that are technical­ly good, they connect well as a team and they're well-organized," Clark said. "There's a lot of simi­larities. On the night, you just hope some of your match-ups are a little bit better, but I'm sure they'll be hoping for the same thing." 
Notre Dame has struggled to put the ball in the back of the net of late, failing to score more than once in a game since Oct. 19. The Irish managed a 3-2-1 record over that six-game span but have put a lot of pressure on junior goalkeeper Philip Tuttle, who has stepped up in the place of injured starter Andrew Quinn. 
ket. The Belles have out­rebounded their opponents by 13 through the first two games. 
Freshman forward Maggie Ronan is already beginning to contribute for the Belles hav­ing to step into the starting role in just her first season. In her first career game against Ohio Wesleyan, the freshman scored 15 points on 5-of-7 shooting, 3-of-4 behind the arc. 
Last year's season opening match-up in the Lee Pfund Classic with Wheaton College did not end well for Saint Mary's. The Belles took a small lead into halftime before being outscored_ by 25 points in the second half and falling 75-56. A strong nucleus of returning starters hopes to move past that performance and reverse last year's result.

"I think it'd be really nice if we could put some goals in the back of the net, and we haven't done that in awhile," Clark said. "We've been winning games, but by narrow amounts, and it's about time we started [scoring] ... At the beginning of the season we were scoring goals, and it'd be nice ~ we could get back to that form. 
The Irish have offensive fire­power in the form of senior for­ward Bright Dike, who has scored a team-best 12 goals. The team averages two goals per game, tied for 15th nationally, and Notre Dame has scored three or more goals in eight games this season -all Irish victories. 
"What you can control is to keep making chances, I think that's the one thing [you can con­trol]," Clark said. "The key thing is to make chances and I think we've been doing that. If you're not making chances, then you start to worry." 
Notre Dame hopes to take full advantage of playing on its home field, where the Irish have an unbeaten 9-0-1 record. 
"Home field's always nice, but it doesn't win you the game," Clark said. "In fairness, the team has got to win the game." 
Though much of the campus may be headed elsewhere for the Thanksgiving break, Oark said a student presence would be a major help to the team's chances tonight. 
"Tonight's a tough night to get a crowd out, but we'll make a plea to any of the students on cam­pus," Clark said. "If there's any students around, let's make sure it's a home-field advantage. It'll be a cold one, but ifyou like Notre Dame and you want to cheer us on, you'll be very welcome."

Hot offense ready for Eagles 
By BILL BRINK Sports Editor 
Success breeds inspiration, apparently. Notre Dame's hot start this season has the play­ers raring for more, Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. 
"It's like we can't wait to play another game," McGraw said. 
No. 15 Notre Dame comes back home to play Georgia Southern today at 7 p.m., three days after hitting triple digits against Boston College on the road. 
Notre Dame's offense over the past two games has been scorching. The Irish (3-0) averaged 99 points against Evansville and Boston College. Forward Becca Bruszewski scored at least 18 points in both games, and at least five Irish players hit double figures in both games. 
"I think we try to get even better," McGraw said. "I feel like we are playing with a 
lot of confidence, we are having fun, and everybody's contributing." 
The Eagles (3-1) started their season strong as well. Their only loss came against No. 20 Auburn on Nov. 19. Their defense, like that of Notre Dame, has not allowed many points. Against the Eagles, Brewton-Parker man­aged 44 points, and UNC Asheville scored only 39. Georgia Southern also defeat­ed Florida Atlantic on Nov. 17. 
This season, the Eagles have attempted 83 3-pointers and made 31 of them, an average of 7.8 per game. McGraw said she was happy about the way her team defended the 3-point line against Boston College. 
"I was very pleased with the defense to only hold them to 2-for-6, and one of those was late in the game," she said. 
Eagles guard Ashley Melson leads the Eagles with 14.8 points per game, but the team spreads points around well. Five players average over 6.8 points per game. 
So far for the Irish this year, four players -Bruszewski, Mallory and guards Ashley Barlow and Lindsay Schrader -average in double figures. 
The defense has held up its end of the bargain as well. The Fighting Irish have not allowed more than 61 points this season and have forced 
25.7 turnovers per game. Opponents struggled to score as well -Notre Dame held them to 38 percent shooting from field goal range. 

McGraw said she liked the play of center Erica Williamson, who guarded Boston College center Carolyn Swords during Sunday's game. Swords, who is 6-foot­6, shot 8-for-·14 from the field and had 16 points and seven rebounds against the Irish. 
"She did some good things at BC and showed improve­ment, even from last year," McGraw said. "She took over the game at one point and had a nice stretch of minutes against a very good post play­er." 
Notre Dame has created much of its success off of turnovers. So far, the Irish have forced an average of 
25.7 turnovers per game and parlayed those possessions into fast-break points. Georgia Southern turns the ball over 19.3 times per game, 2.8 fewer than their opponents. 
Guard Brittany Mallory shot 5-for-5 from the floor and 3­for-3 from 3-point range against Boston College on her way to 14 points. The Irish as a team hit 7 -of-8 3-pointers.

reeeived for leading the nation in assists last season. After the vietory over the Hoosiers, he again brought up Notre Dame's unselfishness. 
"We can pass the ball, we led the nation in assists," he said. "This group really knows how to lind each other." 

Indiana first-year eoaeh Tom Crean, who frequently coached against Notre Dame while he was with Marquette, said he hopes his young team can eventually adopt a similar style to the one Notre Dame uses. 
"There's no question they're a very together team and they've done a great job build­ing it up," Crean said. "Somewhere down the road, there may be something for us to learn from this game in terms of the togetherness they have." 
The Hoosiers often coneen­trated their defense on Irish forward Luke Hararigody, who did not put up his typieally gaudy statistics. But Brey said the junior's unselfishness helped the Irish cruise to an easy win. 

"We can kinda take advan­tage of what the defense gives us and I thought we did a great job of that," Brey said. "I thought Luke Harangody, they were aware of him, doubling him a little bit. He didn't get 25 [points] and 15 [rebounds] but he set up a lot of these guys, there was just a lot of attention on him." 
In addition to leading scorer Tory Jackson, senior forwards Ryan Ayers and Luke Zeller were two of the players that benefited from Indiana's focus on 1-larangody. Ayers scored 13 points on 5-of-7 shooting while Zeller chipped in 10 points and 11 rebounds. 
"My teammates have really been on me. so has coach, just [to keep] being aggressive, playing my game," Ayers said. 
"My teammates were able to find me, set good screens ... We share the ball so well, its reall~ easy to play in this sys­tem. 
McAlarney, who scored 18 points, said his teammates' screens allowed him to get open shots throughout the game. 
"I think I hit one and then I started feeling pretty good. I gotta credit my teammates a lot. They've been screening much better lately .. .l give them a Iotta credit," he said. 
Notre Dame was also effec­tive playing as a team on the defensive end, limiting Indiana to 50 points on 39.6 percent shooting. 
"I thought our position defense was excellent," Brey said. "You hold them to 50 points and 39 percent field goal shooting, that's something we've been trying to get better at."

The lloosiP.rs kept it close in the opening minutes, but .Jackson helped spark a 17-6 Notre Dame run midway through the first half that put Notre Dame ahead for good. .Jackson hit two jumpers and assistnd on a Zach llillesland layup that put Notre Dame ahead 20-11 with S:SO to play in the half. 
Then some of .Jackson's team­mates began to catch fire. 
Senior guard Kyle McAlarney, who linishml with 18 points, hit one of his six 3-pointers. Then junior forward Luke llarangody grabbed one of his live steals, passed to MeAJarney, then raced down the floor. McAlarney lobbed it from about mid court to the streaking llarangody, who <:aught it and executed a dillicult layup to put the Irish up 25-13. 
Following another MeAlarney ;{ and a Hyan Aynrs jumper, sen­ior forward Luke Zeller, who had 10 points and 11 rebounds, drained a 3 of his own and the Irish had a 33-16 lead with 5:16 left in the half. 
"I thought we played old today," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "We knew who we were, we were pretty mature. We took what the defense gave us and we got back and protected the paint and made them take tough, challenged shots." 
. Even with Harangody out the last four-plus minutes of the first half with two fouls, Notre Dame increased its lead to 44-23 at halftime. Harangody finished with 14 points and five rebounds. 
Notre Dame came out in the second half and steadily put away Indiana. Ayers opened the half with a 3-pointer, Jackson pitched in two layups on drives to the basket and McAlarney downed another 3 to put Notre Dame up 56-29 by the first media timeout at 15:43 left in the game. 
Points came easy for the Irish against the Hoosiers, easier than they did in Notre Dame's 65-54 win at Loyola Marymount Friday. 
"Friday's game in a little gym and crazy atmosphere helped us today," Brey said. "We played in a small gym at Loyola. They played great and we had to fight to get out of there with a win. I think that really helped us." 
During one fast break against the Hoosiers, Jackson dribbled down the floor and kept looking at McAlarney and Harangody, who were positioned at his sides. Indiana defenders were so eon­cerned with Harangody and McAiarney that they forgot to pick up Jackson, who coasted in for a layup unguarded. 
"They laid ofT me," Jackson said. "Some of the shots, I feel like I rushed them and some of the shots, I felt like they were quality shots. Overall, I felt like I had a good game, but I had five turnovers today and that was awful for me." 
Notre Dame will take on Texas Tuesday at 7 p.m. EST on ESPN. The Longhorns ·downed St. Joseph's 68-50 on Monday. 
"They're really talented. That's Big East athletic ability coming at us," Brey said of Texas. "We see that a lot in our league, so you're concerned about you rebound the basketball and get­ting through some big stagger screens. Some of those guys could play for Mack Brown set­ting those screens. But, they're a really good team. I think it's two good teams going at it." 
Note: 
uTuesday night, EA Sports and Xbox360 hosted a tournament to see who the best NCAA Basketball '09 player was among the eight participating teams. Each team had two rep­resentatives to the tournament. For the Irish, Jackson and Harangody participated. 1-Iarangody lost in his first-round matchup to Indiana's Devan Dumes. 
Jackson fared a little better. He won a tight first-round con­test against Indiana's Daniel Moore 20-19 and downed St. Joseph's Edwin Lashley in the seeond round. But in the semifi­nals, Jackson lost to North Carolina's Ty Lawson 26-22. Lawson would go on to lose to fellow teammate Mike Copeland in the finals.

each of their last three games. 
Last weekend, Notre Dame demolished a Bowling Green team that entered the home­and-home series with a 4-3-1 conference record. The Irish beat the Falcons 5-1 at home on Friday night before posting a 9-1 blowout win in Bowling Green, Ohio on Saturday. 
"All four of our lines are helping us score, and our power play has been more consistent over the past few weeks than it's been over the last year," said Jackson, whose team is now averaging four goals per game. "Those two things combined have given us the opportunity to be an effective offensive team ... But against a good defensive team, we're going to be chal­lenged and we have to bear down and not take anything for granted." 
Jackson said the defensive­minded Broncos will look to force turnovers by playing their aggressive style. The stats suggest that the style wears on opponents, as the Broncos have scored 12 third­period goals this season, com­pared to six in each of the first two periods. 
"They're an up-tempo team and they pressure the puck very well," Jackson said. "They come after you. They don't sit back and play a trap." 

The series might be a trap in another way -with Thanksgiving break beginning Wednesday, Jackson said playing at home might actual­ly be a disadvantage this weekend. 
"It's easier to play on the road over Thanksgiving break for a number of reasons," Jackson said, citing dietary, family and scheduling distrac­tions. "It gets us out of our normal routine ... We'll have a Thanksgiving dinner for the guys -it's a family holiday, so we want to make sure they have the opportunity to expe­rience that, but not to excess." 
Note: 
uBrett Blatchford and Christian Hanson were named the conference's defensive and offensive players of the week, respectively, the CCHA announced Monday. 
Blatchford, a junior defenseman, took defensive honors for the second consec­utive week. He recorded four assists in the two games against Bowling Green, post­ing a plus-three mark for the weekend. 
Hanson notched two goals and an assist in each game for a six-point weekend. The sen­ior center had never posted a three-point game for the Irish before Friday.

"The organization of the back four plus the goalkeeper, the coordination and the organiza­tion is huge ... when you zone like we do, it's very important that every player not only do their job but that they're confi­dent in the player next to them," Waldrum said. 
Those four players sit at the base of Notre Dame's 4-3-3 sys­tem, which though similar to the Seminoles 4-4-2, will have to adjust to a team that can defend and attack nearly as well as the Irish. Sophomore forward Sanna Talonen leads Florida State with 16 goals. And like the Irish. the Seminoles play a game of pos­session, not like the physical style of Minnesota seen in round three. Meaning both Florida State and Notre Dame will look to control the ball in their respective offensive halves. 

"I think your going to fmd two teams that will try to play on that field, so certainly you put a priority on keeping the ball and trying to play," Waldrum said. 
The game kicks off at 7 Friday night .

]ackson scores 21 and gets five boards in win 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 

MAUl -I lis fellow players and coaches often refer to him as Notre Dame's heartbeat, and how he performs dictates how the rest of the Irish usually play. 
So on Monday, when junior point guard Tory Jackson seowd 21 points, grabbed five rebounds and had six assists, it was no surprise that Notre Dame defeated Indiana 8H-50 in the first round of the Maui Invitational. 
.Jackson, who led all scorers, was one of five Notre Dame players in double lij,rures. And in a rare occurrence for Jackson, he took thn most shots of any­body on the noor -Jackson shot 10-for-17 from the field goal range. 
"I just took those shots because they carne in the flow of the offense," .Jackson said. "A lot of teams focus on Kyle, a lot of teams focus on Luke llarangody, so most of the time

Team finds ways to score without stars 
By FRAN TOLAN Associate Sporrs Editor 
MAUl -Luke Harangody and Kyle McAlarney have grabbed most of the early-sea­son attention for Notre Dame, but the Irish didn't need either player to dominate as they blew out Indiana Monday. 
As Notre Dame built a 21­point lead before halftime, it did not have a single double­digit scorer but had five play­ers drop at least six points. And by the time the final horn sounded, the Irish had five double-digit contributors and eight players with an assist. 
"A lot of unselfishness. Today's indicative, if you look at the scoring, [that] it can come from a lot of different areas with our team," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "We have a lot of different guys that can score the ball." 
Brey has repeatedly talked about the importance his team places on the plaque it

For the first time in this NCAA Tournament. thP Irish will take on a team not versed in the cold and snow. But No. 6 Florida State is also the highest-ranked oppo­nent Notrn Dame has faced yet. 
And even with a soutlwrn team traveling to Alumni Field to take on the No. 1 Irish Friday, Irish coach Handy Waldrum said he knows the team will be ehal-

"llow mueh [home field advan­tage! really factors in I'm not rnally sure." Waldrum said. "But that I think that's why you try to win as many games as you can to secure home field." 
And tlu~re's a reason the Irish earned the No. 1 seed in their braeket and home field advan­tage through Friday's night game -thny're the No. 1 team in the nation with a perfect record. The Irish defense sits at the backbone of that suceess. The Irish have 
Upset-happy Broncos present tough challenge 
By MATT GAMBER Associate Sports Editor 
If tlw Irish want to hang on to tlw No. 2 national ranking they IHtrned in this week's polls, thny'll have to take earn of business this weekend against a Westnrn Miehigan squad looking to upset a top-1 0 team on the road for the second straight week. 
The Bronms (2-7-:{, 1-4-3-1 CCII/\) got tlwir first confnrenee win of the y1~ar Friday by beat­ing No. X Michigan 2-1 at the Wolverines' Yost Anma, consid­ered one of the toughest places to play in eollnge hockey. 
"Any team that can go into Yost and beat Michigan has to be doing something right," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said. "We have to be conseious of that and go into the game under­standing they're a good enough team to beat anybody." 
Notre Damn (9-3-1, 5-2-1-1 CCII/\) has seen its stock risn 10 spots in the polls over the last three weeks on the heels of an eight-game unbeaten streak. The Irish have scored at least thrne goals in ead1 of those games and have tallied four or morn in six of those contests ­including at lnast five goals in

"We've been really good throughout the Tourney defen­sively ... I just think defensively we've really been on the last month," Waldrum said. 
With senior oil'ensive star Kerri Hanks getting all the attlmtion, it's easy to forget the other senior who shares her first name (be it slightly varied): senior Carrie Dew. Dew sits at the center of the 
MEN'S SOCCER 
Irish four-man zone, directing 
and preventing opponents from 
getting shots on goal. 
"She's just gotten better and better as the year's gone on, her presence, she's taken on now ·more of a leadership role than she did even earlier in the year ... she's jJ.Ist elevated it to another 
level," Waldrum said. 
Coming from a club in San 
Diego that taught her the impor­
tance of a zone defense, Dew 
needed little instruction, but 
Notre Dame wasn't just a place for Dew to play four years before hitting the national scene. 

"When we get kids here as freshman, we hope when they graduate they're not just four y1~ars older, they're four years better," Waldrum said. 
It's that experience and knowl­edge that has built a defense where in addition to Dew, defenders Elise Weber. Julie Scheidler and Jessica Schuveillnr work together in perfect unison.
