Policy on tailgaters remains the same 
By MICHELLE DALL Senior Staff Reporter 
Despite the revised alcohol policy, the University's attitude toward tail­gaters will remain the same, according to Ann Firth, director of residence life at Notre Dame. 
"There will be no change in the policy regarding tailgating; tailgaters were never supposed to be student­sponsored," said Firth. 
The newly-revised 1988-89 Alcohol Policy states, "No student, student or­ganization, or-residence hall may orga­nize or sponsor 'tailgaters' on campus or on any adjacent fields or parking lots at any time for the purpose of ser­ving alcoholic beverages." 
According to the policy, students who 
violate the rules will receive a $300 fine 
upon their first offense. The document 
also states, "Further violations will 
result in suspension or dismissal (of the 
student).'' 
"Security has always made an effort to enforce the rules at tailgaters," said Security Director Rex Rakow. "No ad­ditional officers will be employed this year. Instead, Security will continue to enforce the rules consistently." 
"As long as the tailgaters don't in­fringe on the rights of others and aren't student or dorm sponsored," said Rakow, "they shouldn't impose a greater problem than before. Obvious­ly, large, loud gatherings will attract the attention of security officers." 
Although extra measures will not be employed to prevent alcohol consump­tion in the tailgating area, added steps will be taken to deter alcohol usage in­side the football stadium, according to Dick Rosenthal, director of athletics at Notre Dame. "We've added extra hosts and hostesses and re-trained our usher force so they'll identify anyone who at­tempts to drink in the stadium more easily," he said.

The Indiana gubernatorial candidates Evan Bayh and John Mutz as they debated at Notre Dame last night. 

Mutz and Bayh face off in first gubernatorial debate 
By DAN MURPHY Staff Reporter 
Republican John Mutz and Demo­crat Evan Bayh devoted most of their time addressing taxes, educa­tion and experience as they faced off in the first debate of their guber­natorial race Wednesday night. The hour-long event was broadcast live from the Center for Continuing Edu­cation at Notre Dame. 
"We Hoosiers understand the im­portance of traditional values," said Bayh, the first-term secretary of state, "family, hard work, public service." 
The two-term Lieutenant Gover­nor Mutz cited his political experi­ence and accomplishments. "The most important questions are those that will not be asked," he said, "the questions that are determining how we will react to those crisis and chal­lenges that we can't know." 
Bayh said he would keep taxes down by fighting wasteful spending, reducing spending by 10 percent and cutting his staff by 20 percent. He indicted Indiana's tax record for the last eight years, which includes five tax hikes, two of which were the larg­est in the state's history.

An earthquake shook Kentucky, In­diana and three other states Tuesday night, alarming thousands of people but causing little significant property damage, authorities said. 
Cracks appeared in a few buildings, items fell off walls, pilot lights in fur­naces were blown out and a home propane tank overturned near the epicenter of the quake, between Mount Sterling and Sharpsburg in eastern Kentucky. 
John Minsch, a geophysicist with the 
National Earthquake Information Cen­
ter in Golden, Colo., said the shocks 
registered 4.5 on the Richter scale com­
pared to a 5.1 reading for a damaging 
quake that was centered in about the 
same area in 1980. 
"It looks like this is the kissing cousin 
of the 1980 earthquake," University of 
Kentucky seismologist Ron Street said 
Wednesday. "It looks like it occurred 
in the same spot." 
Minsch and Street both said the 
temblor was not related to the New 
Madrid Fault, a 150-mile crack in the 
earth from northern Arkansas to south­
ern Illinois that produced catastrophic 
earthquakes in 1811 an 1812. 
"It practically shook me out of the 
chair," Betty Raines of Huntington, 
W.Va., said of Tuesday's quake, which 
also was felt in Tennessee, West Vir­
ginia and Ohio. 
The Ohio River town of Maysville, 
Ky., which suffered $1 million in 
damage during the 1980 quake, ap­parently was largely unaffected by Tuesday's tremor. Authorities there said no significant damage had been reported. 
Kentucky Department of Mines and 
Minerals officials said Wednesday there had been no reports of damage to the state's coal mines as a result of the quake. 
"I've worried all day about that but so far I haven't had the first call," said David Phillips, the department's dis­trict supervisor in Pikeville. Phillips said a severe earthquake easily could cause disasters in coal mines by forcing roofs to collapse. 
About 500 people called Cincinnati police to report the quake during the first hour after the quake, said Richard Young, Hamilton County Communica­tion Center supervisor. 
Montgomery County, Ky., Fire Chief Wayne Welch said the quake had damaged plaster and ceilings in a 98­year-old apartment building in Mount Sterling. After the shocks subsided, some of about 60 people who live in the building also reported smelling natural gas, Welch said. 
Authorities later determined the gas odor was coming from pilot lights for the building's furnaces that apparently had been knocked out during the initial quake or a minor aftershock immedi­ately afterward, Welch said. 
State disaster officials and local building inspectors also were checking the condition of several schools in the area.

For the past 11 years, every tabloid newspaper has had one story to fall back on when U.F.O. and Bigfoot sightings were down and Hollywood love affairs weren't heated up enough. It seems that the National Enquirer and its cousins follow one credo: 
When in doubt, do another story on Elvis. 
Yes, the King has been dead since 1977, but his reign continues. People just can't seem to get enough of him. Elvis' followers make their faithful pilgrimages to Graceland and weep over his grave while placing flowers at his tombstone. Elvis impersonators still perform in nightclubs across the country. And the tabloids keep trying to convince us that Elvis is still alive. 
Elvis has reportedly been sighted in a con­venience store and driving along a deserted country road. People seem to spot him everywhere. Some women say they have borne his illegitimate children (all born with jet black hair and sideburns.) One woman even claimed that she made love to the ghost of Elvis. 
All of these people who claim that they have seen Elvis usually come from towns with a pop­ulation of about 20 with a collective I.Q. even lower than that. Most eyewitness accounts sound like this: "And there it was, plain as day. It was the biggest thing I ever saw. With rhines­tones as big as my head. Then it started to sing 'Love Me Tender,' an' I figured that I had either met my maker or I'd just seen Elvis!" 
I know if I ever met the King, I wouldn't go running to the Enquirer. I'd show Elvis around campus, perhaps take him along with my friends when we go out on the weekends. I could introduce him to all the people I meet at parties, " ... and these are my friends Nancy, Lisa, and Elvis." 
Since Elvis seemed to have an affinity for eating considerable amounts of food in his later years, he could probably work in the dining hall. Elvis could eat all of the leftovers before they became ingredients in some casserole later on in the week. 
Elvis would also make Notre Dame a dry 
campus at last. As I recall, Elvis also had an 
affinity for intoxicating substances. Monk Mal­
loy could enlist Elvis as a drugs/alcohol officer, 
confiscating every narcotic in sight. 

ML6 

Elvis would go from party to party saying, "Sorry kids, I'm afraid the party's over. I've got my orders to drink every last drop of beer in the place. Remember, I'm doing this for your own good. Ifyou don't mind, I'll just start drink­ing from the tap." 
With Elvis on campus, he could hold concerts every week in the JACC. People from all over the country would flock to hear him sing and see him wiggle his pelvis onstage. With all of his fans traveling thousands of miles to see the King, South Bend-Mishawaka would truly be "alive with pride." 
I know that Elvis has a lot of fans who are truly devoted to him. I will admit that Elvis had an outstanding voice, and his performances were equally enthralling. However, the fact remains that Elvis never wrote any of his songs, hit on a 14-year-old Priscilla when he was about 25, and by the end of his life he was a bloated walking pharmacy. 
Of all the people in the world people would want to bring back to life, why should it be Elvis? I don't hear of people sighting Martin Luther King or Ghandi in the grocery store buying Oreos. Why aren't people looking for the ghosts of the truly great leaders of our time instead of a talented performer who let fame go to his head? Seeing Elvis is just wishful thinking, and those people who keep looking for him should spend their time more productively. 
So let me make it clear once and for all: Elvis is dead, he has been for 11 years, and he's not coming back. However, I did see John Lennon in the 7-11 the other day ...

MOSCOW-The commander of a Soviet space capsule stranded in space for a day may have worsened equipment problems by not taking manual control, the government news­
paper suggested Wednesday 
after the Soyuz TM-5 landed 
safely. 

The government daily Izves­
tia said reporters questioned 
deputy flight chief Viktor 
Blagov of the Soviet space pro­
gram, on whether the com­
mander, Vladimir Lyakhov, 
made mistakes Tuesday 
during attempts to fire braking 
rockets aboard his Soyuz TM-5 
capsule. 

The tiny capsule parachuted 
to a landing at 4:50a.m. Wed­
nesday, Moscow time, 100 
miles southeast of Dzhezkaz­
gan in the Kazakhstan republic 
of Soviet Central Asia. 

Despite a problem with the 
guidance system, the 
spacecraft landed within only 
a few dozen miles of the in­
tended target and only 24 hours 
late, Izvestia reported. 

Television showed the tiny spherical Soyuz capsule float­ing toward the ground on a white parachute with orange stripes againt a reddish dawn sky. A puff of dust rose from the ground when the capsule landed. 
Abdul Ahad Mohmand, the first Mghan in space, and So­viet crewmate Lyakhov spent 26 hours aboard the cramped 
capsule that had enough air for 
only two days, dwindling food 
supplies and no toilet. 

"Of course it was not an easy thing to sit in spacesuits for 24 hours," Lyakhov, 47, said in an interview near the charred capsule. 
The problems began after the capsule undocked early Tues­day from Mir, the space station where Lyakhov and Mohmand spent six days with three other cosmonauts. 
After boarding their capsule and undocking from Mir, the cosmonauts made two at­tempts to reenter the atmo­sphere on Tuesday. 
Izvestia quoted Blagov as giving a philosophical answer to reporters asking whether technical problems or mis­takes by mission control or the capsule crew were to blame for the landing delay. 
-"Life is guilty, a coincidence of circumstances," Blagov said. 
Izvestia said Tuesday's first landing attempt was aborted when an infrared sensor used in guiding the spacecraft mal­functioned.

'Hell Week' ends for ND Army ROTC Rangers 
--~~·~--~~ 
By MICHAEL WELLS 
News Staff 
Yesterday ended the three day ordeal of "hell week" for freshmen and sophomores in the Army ROTC Ranger Corps. 
"Basically it's an initiation period for the Rangers," said Senior Chuck Wehnes, Cadet Company Commander for "Charlie" Company (Rangers). 
During this period the cadets are assembled on Green Field at 5 a.m. and put through two to three hours of grueling physical and mental workouts. Seventy-two Rangers went through the event, said Wehnes, including the junior and senior officers in charge of the cadets. 
This is also the first time the group has consisted of anyone who did not volunteer to be­come an Army Ranger, said Wehnes. 
In previous years, the Ranger company on campus has been composed of only those who voluntarily joined. Now, however; every student entering Army ROTC will be required to spend one semester in each of the three companies: Weapons, Drill, and Rangers, said Wehnes. 
Sophomores not previously in the Ranger program will also be spending one semester in each area. 
According to Wehnes, the 
idea behind the rotation is to 
broaden the experience of every cadet in the Army's pro­gram, who will then be given the chance to choose which company he will finally stay with as an upperclassman. "The changes in batallion have really improved the cadet com­pany. They're going to produce a more qualified cadet, espe­cially when they get to ad­vanced camp," said Wehnes. 
Pat Murphy, a sophomore spending his third semester in the Ranger program, des­cribed doing "low crawl and high crawl" races through the mud, getting "smoked"-when an officer runs you until you 
drop, and being subjected to "mental harassment" and "mind games." 
Nevertheless, Murphy's pre­vious experience with hell week gave him a slightly dif­ferent perspective this time around, he said. "Last year I was really intimidated. I didn't know any of the people," he said. "This year I wasn't ter­rified and intimidated, just challenged."

Half -hour loading1.mloading passes may be picked up at se­curity by leaving one's ID, Par­rish said. She added that the McCandless parking Jot is only three-quarters full, and stu­dents may find plenty of parking space there. Parrish asked students not to park in the Bertrand lot, as it is for con­vent use only. 
The student input table was also discussed at the meeting. This will be today outside Hag­gar College Center or, weather not permitting, in the lobby. 
"If you have a problem, come to us," said Julie Parrish. 
The idea of purchasing a computer for student govern­ment use was also discussed. This computer might also be available for student use during certain hours, said Par­rish. Possible locations are still up in the air. 

Voter Registration at Saint Mary's will be Sept. 20-22 in the dining hall and Haggar College Center. Registration will be sponsored by Campus Mini­stry. Information about the presidential candidates will be made available .

he Center for Social Con­cerns. For some students, the name conjures visions of peace-loving, long-haired liberals protesting the killing of whales. For others, the center may be a place where the nuns work. Still others may call it the Commie Cafe. More likely, the name CSC doesn't mean anything to us because we have never both­ered to take a look inside. In fact, many students don't even know where it is. 
The truth is that the center offers something crucial to the lives of Notre Dame stu­dents and staff. It allows them to practice what they preach. In addition, it pro­vides a service to the sur­rounding community. 
The official mission of the center is to "integrate justice and peace concerns into everyday life through forma­tive educational experience." Kathy Royer, coordinator for service and social action groups, said, "We try to ta~e students into the South Bend and other communities to give exposure to different set­tings." In addition, "We give them a chance to think about and talk about their experi­ence." 
There are over twenty-five student-run groups that work with the CSC. They includes Amnesty International, Wo­men United for Justice and Peace, Community for the International Lay Apostulate <CILA), Right to Life, and many others. "The groups are fueled by student ener­gy," said Royer. "The center acts as a support system, pro­viding resources and moral support." 
Two new groups this year are particularly interesting because they are very much alive in the South Bend area. Food Share picks up left-over food from the Notre Dame dining halls and brings it to soup kitchens in South Bend. Another group, affiliated with the national organization, is Habitat for Humanity. Through actions of the group, two houses in South Bend are being renovated by students for families that would other­wise be homeless. 
Perhaps the group enjoying the most support by students is the Neighborhood Study Help Program <NSHP) which provides students with the chance to tutor children of all grade levels in the area. But

I think the prize last year would have gone to some friends of mine who cut all their 4x4 supports and then discovered that their measuring tape was missing the first foot. So they simply tacked on an extra foot of lumber to each piece, and I'm still amazed that they're walking around campus without crutches. 
Now that these contraptions are up for another year, it's fun to look around at different ones and estimate how many cold ones were consumed during the construction phase. Let's face it--drinking and building just don't mix. There should be a law against it, but I'm sure du Lac is a step ahead of us. 
I've finally gotten over my freshman loft anxiety, but the scars remain for life. This year I'm sitting pretty in a 2x4 temple that won't budge, probably because I had noth­ing to do with its construc­tion. When I arrived in sunny

"This year, we really want for students to give us a try,'' Royer said. "For students who don't want their lives to be completely consumed by it, we want them to get a taste of what we are about." 
We always hear so much about the Notre Dame family, but many of us are missing the opportunity to put into practice the Christian ideals of service we have been brought up believing. The Center for Social Concerns offers this opportunity, and it may be worth the five-minute walk over to the esc building to find out about it. By the way, it's that little one with the picnic tables next to the library.

ND women's soccer looks to Indiana after w1n 
By COLLEEN HENNESSEY Sports Writer 
Two games into their first varsity season, the Notre Dame women's soccer team remained undefeated with a 8-1 victory over St. Joseph's on Tuesday. 
"Obviously, we dominated 
for the most part,'' said Irish 
assistant coach Neil Schmidt. 
"We had 15 corner kicks to 
their 0. That kind of says it all." 
Despite a slow start, in which St. Joseph's scored during the first few minutes, the Irish played a solid game. 
"At first we weren't playing too well," said freshman Susie Zilvitis, who had a hat trick in the game, becoming the first Irish woman soccer player to score three goals in a game. "But after that first goal, we picked it up. It was fun. I just went out and had a good game." 
Schmidt credits the victory

to a good team effort and said that "there was a lot of inten­sity shown on the field." 
The relative inexperience of the team necessarily places the tactical emphasis on the basics, leaving other areas, such as the passing attack, open to improvement. 
"We applied good defensive pressure," said Schmidt. "But we only scored on one corner kick, so obviously we need to work on our restarts." 
The Irish will be travelling to 

Bloomington on Friday to take on Indiana University. Al­though the Hoosiers are still playing at club status after ap­proximately eight years, Schmidt does not dismiss the competition. 
"I predict that it will be a low scoring game," he said. "The defense will take over." 
Schmidt said that he and Notre Dame head coach Dennis Grace are still working out their line-up, seeing what com­binations work well together and giving the players a chance to find out where they are most comfortable. 
"Right now everybody is playing defense and everybody is playing offense," he said. 
"It looks good for Friday," said Zilvitis. "We've been working hard to get ready for Indiana." 
After the Hoosier game, the next test for the Irish will come on Sunday when they head for Illinois to face Lake Forest.

Garrison's service in the ninth game. 
Both players held serve before Navratilova easily took the tie-breaker. 
The two held serve for the first four games of the final set before Garrison broke on a backhand return to take a 3-2 lead. Navratilova broke in the lOth game when Garrison netted a backhand half-volley,

but Garrison broke back with . a cross-court forehand to go ahead 6-5. 
Navratilova staved off a fifth match point before Garrison ended the 2-hour, 33-minute match with a forehand volley. 
Graf won her 33rd straight match and moved to within two victories of completing a Grand Slam with a 6-3, 6-0 vic­tory over No. 14 Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria. 
Maleeva's older sister, sixth­seeded Manuela, lost a two­hour baseline duel to Evert 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, while Wilander beat Emilio Sanchez of Spain 3-6, 7-6 (8-6)' 6-0, 6-4. 
Sabatini, the fifth seed, beat 16th-seeded Larisa Savchenko of the Soviet Union 4-6, 6-4, 6-1. 
Evert, seeded third, was down a set and a break before rallying to reach the semifinals for the 17th time in 18 years. 
Soccer 
continued from page 16 
After leading the nation in scoring as a freshman last year, Snow has picked up this season where he left off, scoring all four goals for In­diana last weekend. The Hoosiers are 17-1 in games Snow has scored at least one goal, with that one loss coming against Notre Dame. 
Complementing Snow on the front line is Sean Shapert, who led the team with 18 assists last season. Snow, Shapert, and Chris Sciortino are the starting forwards for the Hoosiers. 
The Hoosier midfield is weakened by the loss of captain Herb Haller, who sprained his ankle last week and probably will not play. Either Wes Priest or Mike Hanhouser will fill Hal­ler's spot, and Simon Kanter and Han Roest round out the midfield. 
Indiana's defense is solid, led by keeper Jeurgen Sommer, stopper John Paul and sweeper Jim Crockford, all of whom were named to the AdidasMet Life all-tournament team. Matt Isger and Mark Behringer are the wingbacks. 
IRISH ITEMS--No Irish players are expected to miss the game because of injury. Reserve forwards Pat Murphy and Tom Connaghan are both banged up, but expected to play.

Speculation swirls around Tyson 'accident' 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK--Mike Tyson's alleged suicide attempt, con­sidered pure fiction by those closest to him, may have been an attempt to attract more at­tention from a wife who is ig­noring him, sources close to the heavyweight champion said. 
Tyson's manager, Bill Cayton, meanwhile, confirmed on Wednesday that the fighter's actress wife, Robin Givens, and her mother have urged Tyson to see a Manhat­tan psychiatrist described as an expert on athletic stress. 
Stanford

and kept its intensity long enough to win a game. 
Senior Maureen Shea's play improved as the match contin­ued, but neither she nor Ben­nett and Waller could dominate the net consistently against a much taller Stanford team and, in the decisive game of the match, this proved to be the team's downfall. 
The Irish played their best volleyball of the night in the fourth game and looked to be headed for a fifth game show­down with the Cardinals, but after leading 12-8 seemed to lose their concentration and go on the defensive. 
Even a brilliant defensive performance, led by Shew­man's 21 digs, and Waller's third service ace could not prevent the Stanford team from clawing its way into the lead and the Irish offense be­came nonexistent in the final stages of the game. 
"When it was 12-8, I thought 'We've got them; we're going into a fifth game,' " said Wal­ler. "But instead of finishing the game off, we just seemed to lose our concentration and fall apart as a team." 
The match was marked by play that was less than consis­tent for the Irish and the Stan­ford team, who executed their offense and defense with al­most mechanical perfection, seldom lost their intensity long enough for Notre Dame to take control of the match. 
"As far as skill goes I think we're right up their with them," said Shea. "But they had that mental edge and we weren't able to incorporate our individual performances into good team play as a whole." 
Waller led the team with 21 kills and 11 blocks and Shea and Bennett each contributed 14 kills, but Stanford was able to neutralize much of this attack. The Irish tallied a total of 17 blocks compared to Stanford's nine, but the Cardinals rarely let the Irish attack reach the floor. 
Stanford's rapid-fire sub­stitution kept the Cardinals fresh and the Irish seldom found the combination that could trigger a scoring run. 
"We just kept getting better as the match went on," said Lambert, "but we can't expect teams like Stanford to hand us a victory. We've got a tough schedule ahead of us and I think we have the ability to be a top ten team, but you've got to keep your intensity for the entire match or you might as well just give them the game."
