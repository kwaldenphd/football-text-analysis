Discuss war crimes, History of conflict 
committed to the defense of 
Vietnam since 1950 
Williams summed Up his case by saying that we are committed "on moral grounds to defend a nation when it is aggressed against," and that we "must 
defend our credibility before the 
other nations of the world." 
Therefore, Williams said, "Viet­
nam is a keystone to our 
credibility and security and 
defense of the rest of the 
world." 
Edward Isley, a graduate stu­dent in economics and a former soldier in Vietnam, talked on war and international law, detail­ing the types of crimes and the principles involved in such a Iaw. 
Isley said that the three crimes in international law were crimes against peace, war crimes -such as waging war unjustly, and crimes against humanity­such as gas chambers and con­centration camps.. 
The purposes of this law are first to reduce the suffering in war and secondly to ease the transition to peace by alleviating tensions and hatreds built during conflict. 
Isley admitted that "we have 
committed many atrocities," but 
said, "I can see how they came 
about." 
Hoping to spur discussion. Isley finished by saying that he believed that participation in an unjust war did not make one a war criminal and that napalm was not an unlawful war weap­on and that Dow Chemical, on~-time manufacturer of napalm, could not be accused of 
war criminality.

Betchov then talked on past attempts at international peace keeping organizations, beginning in 1900 with The Hague Court, "which is now covered with cobwebs." After both World Wars there were "waves and hurri~anes of indignation over war" Betchov said, "but privateinte~ests and nationalism inter-

Comparing the present United Nations to the League of Na­tions in 1935, Betchov con­cluded that "we must take a little of our precious national sovereignty and concentrate it in an organization with the power to maintain world peace, and with the power to decide what constitutes a threat to world peace.

Canvassing for signatures in support of Rev. Theodore Hesburgh's declaration in opposition to President Nixon's actions in Cambodia should be finished either today or tomorrow, according to Fred Dedrick, a member of the com 1ittee in charge of canvas­sing. He said yesterday that about 21 ,000 signatures had been obtained. An additional 4,000 were expected over the weekend. 
Dedrick said that Hesburgh would probably be taking the signatures, or perhaps only the total number, to a Nixon advisor some time next week. 
Dedrick also said that the totals would be transmitted to Indiana Senators Birch, Bayh and Vance Hartke, and Repre­sentative John Bradcmas at the request of their respective offices.

Enter Cambodia again 
SAIGON (UPI) -A U.S. supported column of South Vietnamese tanks thrust into Cambodia Thursday and opened an eleventh front in the allied offensive against Communist sanctuaries. The two-week cam­paign so far has sent the American casualty rate to its highest level in eight months (168 dead). 
The new allied thrust across the border in the Central High­lands region came as U.S. Infan­trymen moving through jungles of Cambodia's Fishhook area reported finding a computer "readout sheet" and other evi­dence of the long sought Com­munist field headquarters known 
as  COSVN -Central  Office  for

This statement ofRepresentative James J. Howard, Third District, New Jersey was presented during consideration of Military Procurement Authorization Bill on May 6, 1970. 
Mr. Chairman: I rise in support of the Leggett Amendment; the 
amendment that will assure that this country and this Congress has 
no intention of widening or prolonging this frustrating war. . 
The Leggett Amendment will in no way endanger the ground 
combat troops that have already unfortunately, been deployed into 
neutral Cambodia. Its effective date is July I, 1970-a date by which 
the President himself asserted yesterday that all of our troops will be 
out of that country. 
But the Leggett Amendment in many ways goes beyond its stated 
purpose. It gives this Congress the opportunity to fulfill its 
Constitutional responsibility to the American people. It gives us the 
opportunity to go on record against continuing senseless killing of 
other human beings, both ours and our enemies. It especially will 
show to the young people of America that there is indeed an "other 
way" to be heard. 
Mr. Chairman, during periods of social upheaval, when people are 
faced with horrendous challenges, they either rise to the occasion, 
face what must be faced, and do what must be done, or else they 
collapse, and go looking for scapegoats. 
In my opinion, a large percentage of our older generation has 
failed to rise to the occasion, cannot bear to face what must be 
faced, or do what must be done, and has wholly collapsed, seeking 
only the necessary scapegoat, to satisfy its wounded pride. And the 
scapegoat it wants to tear apart, most especially, is the politically 
active element in the younger generation. 
Let me explain, so there won't be any confusion about it: I am 
not speaking in favor of the ones who burn down college buildings, 
intimidate school officials, break the laws, and interrupt the 
operations of soeiety, just for the sake of causing a sensation. In 
every generation there are people like this-fragile, anguished, in 
psychological pain-who can only express their feelings by adopting 
the worst of the world around them. The wounded-in-soul are 
always with us, but I am not talking about them. 
. Rather, I am talking about those who have seen us as we are, and 
taking us to task. They may enrage us by asking us just the questions 
we want least to hear, or disturb us with the depth of the perception 
of our failure. But they are righ:t, and there is no getting around it. 
I am speaking of the young people who question the moral 
justification of a terrible war; who want to know how we can travel 
to the moon, but so pollute our water and our atmosphere that our 
life becomes endangered-young people who wonder aloud at our 
turning this nation into one huge traffic jam-young people who 
question why we insisted on teaching them about the Constitution 
when as a Nation, we have absolutely refused to abide by its 
requirements in regard to men :of different color. They call attention 
to the hypocrisies by which we live-our talk about National ideals 
shrouded as it is by the shadow of materialism; our pretention~ 
about religion, coupled with the practice of dog-eat-dog, five days a 
week. · · And what can we say in response? What do we sav in resnonse? We say they are ungrateful. We gave them everything money could buy. They were the first generation raised in affluence, receiving all the material things their parents and grandparents worked so hard to get for them. And here they are, telling us it is the wrong kind of everything. Perhaps it was the affluence. These kids, raised without the need to go grubbing for pennies in the street, had the time and opportunity to think; and some of their thinking, apparently, concerning that wonderful abstraction': the meaning of life. We gave them so much education, so many opportunities to travel; we were so candid with them about our frailties; we encouraged them to explore. And what have they become? Wiser and kinder and more deeply commited to our own ideals than we ever were. There is an interesting parallel here, between the days of the Kennedy Administration, which captured the imagination of American youth, and the present era, which infuriates American youth. In one case, we had a country full of hope, determined that problems w~uld be solved. Under the current regime, we have a hopeless policy, dedicated to retreat from reform and retreat. from reality. It_ is time to summon the courage to face the facts. Those bright, passwnate, clear-eyed young people should not be ignored, or locked up, or betrayed, or shot by a Nation that needs them as no nation ever n~eded anybody. We parents have never brought up a generatiOn of children so well before. They have turned out wise and ~trong, with a ~~ssion for life and a quality of humanity blinding in Its shee_r magmf1cence. Somehow, we have raised an extraordinary generatiOn of good people. Now they are in peril. They are under attack as revolutionaries and most of them are nothing of the kind. They are denounced a~ wreckers of the world because they speak against the wrecking of the world. It is entirely possible that they h~ve, in fact, become the guardians of the "impossible dream," of democratic triumph, and to attack and destroy them and their hopes now under such circumstances, well could be the greatest catastroph~ of American political history. 

letters 
Editor: 
St. Thomas Aquinas, hope­fully of somewhat not too distant memory at Notre Dame, specified certain necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for a just war. In his Summa Theologica, 11-11, q. 40, a.l, c., St. Thomas wrote: "In order for a war to be just, three things are necessary. First, the authority of the sovereign by whose com­mand the war is to be waged. For it is not the business of a private individual to declare war, because he can seek for redress of his rights from the tribunal of his superior. .. Secondly, a just cause is required, namely that those who art: attacked, should be attacked because they deserve it on account of some fault... Thirdly, it is necessary that the belligerents should have a right­ful intention, so that they intend the advancement of good or the avoidance of evil. . . Hence Augustine says Contra Faust, xxii, 74: The passion for inflict­ing harm, the cruel thirst for vengeance... the lust of power, all these are rightly condemned in war. 
To be sure, it would be presumptuous to simply main­tain that such a version of a "just war" theory is correct, and precarious, if not fallacious, to base a case solely on argume­ntum ad verecundiam. Nonethe­less, I believe applications of such a theory to have proven workable in the past, and remain consistent with the tradition of Christianity. Moreover, it seems manifestly clear that the first condition is violated, and the requirements of the second and third conditions most dubiously satisfied in the case of the present war in Southeast Asia. 
Given such considerations, how is it possible that some 134 faculty members found the Hes­burgh declaration of May 4th unacceptable? 
Sincerely, John Donnelly Assistant Professor Philosophy

As one who worked for the Academic Freedom Proposal from its birth at 6:00 Am in St. Ed's last Thursday, until its final acceptance (in a revised form) by the Academic Council on Monday, I must say that I am quite disappointed in "The Ob­server" for recognizing Steve Preston as its organizer. Steve was quite helpful as were many others. However, the student who deserves I 00% of the credit for its passage (and I'm sure I speak for all those who worked for it), is Bob Schmuhl. If Bob got over 15 hours sleep in the past five days I'd be surprised_ I've never seen anyone more dedicated to working for a cause, during my entire three years at Notre Dame. Bob is presently devoting his time to setting up the Informal Classes suggested in the original classes. 
I think Bob deserves a vote of thanks from all of us here at Notre Dame. Let's give credit where credit's due.

The Strike 

Mant"people arc questioning where the Strike is right now. Before going ahead, I must remark that only after a while will we be able to adequately appraise last week's actions-there is no need to attempt that now. However, probably the most important aspect of those actions must be commented on now. That is, the initial purposes of the Strike must be reiterated. 
First of all, the Strike was called as a symboli~.: protest to the expansion of the War in Indochina. Secondly, because we were in a state of turmoil both nationally and locally-evidenced by the April panty raid, the Alumni Hall incident a few weeks earlier, and the recent meeting of the Board of Trustees. I saw the need to say "Stop. Let's see where we are." To a large extent, we've done this already-for probably the first time at Notre Dame. Naturally, theWar issue took precedence, but subsidiary issues like Racism, Sexism, and Militarism have also been examined. 
Again, Where are we now? 
As far as the Strike goes, we are in a state of transition. The emotion and elan of the past week has subsided, and with the recent Academic Counci) decision, we are in a state of limbo. 
As I see it, Student Government activities will go on as they have for the last few weeks~but will never be the same. An awareness of the issues raised in the last week, both national and local, has infiltrated the spirit of Student Government, and will continue to do 
so through the next year. 
Student Union activities, which were fo~.:used on the activities of the strike, will be refocused to the planning of next year's activities.· But as with Student Government, business will never be as usual. After students negotiate their courses with their Professors, the Strike should take on a new light. Hopefully students will become involved in the two main a~.:tivities, Canvassing, and the Communiveristy. Also, many students are becoming involved in the economic boycott, in letter-writing, campaigns and work-stoppage movements. In addition, we have become regional and state directors for various strike activities. This work must go on, with hopefully some innovations to sustain these activities. 
Student Government will take on many aspects of the Communiversity, for largely the communiversity is everything I talked about in my campaign. There is no need for a definite enunciation of a continuation of the Strike as such, because the University, through the Academic Council has in a large way determined the directions we can and will go in. 
A few thoughts on the Academic Council's decision: I see the Council as being very progressive at a previously Conservative oriented University. But the Student Body should not take advantage of their decision. This is not the time to pack for the summer, nor the time to abet our academic averages, but a time to commit our persons to the enormous tasks of our times-anything less would be hypocritical and dishonest to the good faith shown in 
the Council's decisions. 
Again, last week's events will be studied in the future, but I sincerely believe that because of the deep moral, :juestioning on the part of many individuals during those days, Notre Dame can only be~.:ome a better community for it.

The Strike on other Catholic campuses 

Everything is running smoothly now at Notre Dame. Students, faculty, and administration have agreed that the current national situation is serious enough to merit a suspension of normal activities. The community and the politicians are being made aware of our feelings. The university is alive and constructive. 
At other Catholic universities in the midwest the situation is much different. Marquette University (Catholic-coed, Milwaukee, Wis.) has been shut down because of bomb threats. One Marquette student said that an alarm-clock hooked up to a Linko bottle filled with chemicals was found on the fourth tloor of McCormick "Beer Can" Hall. TI1e campus has been hit by other forms of vandalism as well. One resident hall had its sprinkler system turned on, causing extensive damage and making it impossible for anyone to live there. Some students arc sleeping outside, others have left and are afraid to come back. 
The president of Marquette had previously refUsed to work out any compromise with the strikers. No one knows for sure, but it seems highly probable that the incidents are related to his stand. 
Loyola University (Catholic-coed, Chicago, Ill.) was closed on Thursday and Friday last week. So far, the administration has tried to repress the strikers. The students were thrown out of the strike headquarters in the basement of Mertt Hall and the phones were disconnected. The striker~ have since moved back in. These students have also given space to organizing high schoolers of the area. Loyola strikers of the area. Loyola strikers also have students representing them at the Art Institute of Chicago, the headquarters for coordinating all Chicago colleges. 
Meanwhile, rhe Young Republicans are passing out literature at Loyola calling for the faculty to flunk the strikers. To add to the mess, three nights ago a small firebomb 



From Bad to Worse to Politics 
=========================================================================:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:::::::::::::::::::::========================·by Pete Peterson 
I ran into my old buddy, Frank, the other day in the Huddle. We had had a couple of classes together freshman year, but after that things h~ppened and we sort of drifted apart, and it was really good to see him again. He had grown his,hair in, had about half a beard, and was wearing an army shirt and a headband. 
We got ourselves the table with the six-for-a-quarter Juke Box and put on some 
music. 
"So, Frank, what have you been doing'!" 
"Oh, jeez, Pete, I've been working my tail to the bone. Biafra, grape boycott, 
anti-draft work, moratoriums, GE strike, Dow protest, complicity week, you 
know." 
"Wow, that's quite a schedule. You staying in school all right?" 
"Well, I'm hanging in Okay. I've got about a 2.7." 
The guys in blue jeans and tennies walked in and sat down near us. One of them 
said something to the other, who turned to look at us. They chuckled and turned 
back to their cokes. 
"Dumb jocks," Frank snorted, "give them a Frisbee and a copy of Playboy and. 
they're set for the semester. I swear to God, Pete, half the people around here 
don't know there's a war on." 
"Well, maybe they've got other things on their minds," I replied lamely. 
"What minds?" Frank retorted, "No joke Pete, I've spent the last week passing 
out pamphlets and canvassing, and these Tarzan types won't even give you the time 
of day." 
"Say, Frank, why do you bother?" 
"Why do I bother? Jesus Christ, Pete, look around you! There are people being 
killed every god dam day, and nobody here cares! These stupid screwed-up idiots 
don't care about anything but getting drunk and smashing up things. They never see 
past the next weekend!" 
"Looks like you've got your work cut out for you." 
"Yeah, it's an uphill battle getting people to stop and think and start living like 
they say they do every Sunday." 
"Yeah, I guess so. Listen, Frank, so what else have been you been up to?" 
"Man, like I said, I've been busy as Hell." 
"You been eating and sleeping too, haven't you?" 
"Well, yeah." 

"Well, whatever happened to that chick, Chris?'' 
"That'~ kind of a long story. Chris kind of messed up last summer. She's gone, 
man." 
"Wow. What happened?" 

"Well, we were getting a lot of hassles from her folks and my folks. You know, 
about grades and bolting and dope. So we just split, and did a thing in Chicago, and 
her folks found out and came up and started screaming about cops and I told them 
where to stick it, and so she got dragged home. Then I went down there and did 
some more yelling and then split again. So then she started hanging around the 
beach at home and somebody laid some bad acid on her, and now she's off in a 
hospital somewhere." 
"Bummer. So you two aren't getting it on any more?" 
"Hell, her goddamned parents are reading her mail and they call me up to tell me 
to .stay away about once a month and I tell them to go to hell." Frank glanced 
down at his watch. "Hey, listen, I've got to go. We're having a teach-in at the 
flagpole. Why don't you come along?" 
"Sure. What's the topic?" 

"Christianity and pacifism. It ought to really get some people thinking around 
here." 
was thrown into the ROTC building. Some militant student groups have threatened over the underground radio station to burn the school down unless the students are allowed to strike. The faculty will vote on what to do but are expected to give only minor concessions. 
The Blacks at Loyola and Mundelein (Catholic-girls, Chicago,lll.) are organizing extensively for the strikes. At Loyola, the Blacks joined the strikers yesterday to protest the Augusta, Ga. deaths. Six Blacks were shot in the back and one beaten to death in fail. Mundelein Blacks have asked their faculty to make a statement about this. 
Mundelein, like Notre Dame, has united and become extremely active and construc~ive. They are ~aving 35 seminars in the new university which arc open to the commun1ty. TI1e scmmars range from "Revolutionary Literature" to "How to Convince the Pollack Workers," according to one of the strike leaders. The strikers here as well as at Barat College arc doing extensive community work. Besides door to door _canvassing, Mundelein is sending groups of four to talk to church groups, P.T.A. mcetmgs, etc. Each group is comprised of a Theology major, a Political Science major. someone who knows Constitutional law, and an Economics major. 
After looking at the turmoil of feelings on these campuses, I find it hard to figure out how the Christians who run Marquette and Loyola can be so insensitive to the moral convictions of some of their students. Can they really believe that the violence and dissention that erupts from student frustration is preferable to whole communities trying to save a troubled society through constructive actions and education? Notre Dame, St. Mary's, Mundelein, and Barat College have not closed down. Marquette has. 
Why have the Jesuits at Loyola not empathized with the slaughtered Blacks in Augusta, the slaughtered Vietnamese, the slaughtered American soldiers, and the slaughtered Kent students? Maybe the clergy feel it is not proper for the elite followers of Christ to take a moral stand in a society where they hold a privileged position. 
Maybe their kind of complacency is the major reason America has slipped so far in to trouble. ·

Lynd said that canvassing has been very important to the strike because it represents a constructive effort on the part of the students. He noted that in many areas there has not been the enthusiasm that is seen in the Notre Dame-South Bend area. "There is more reaching out to the community at Notre Dame than in any part of Chicago," said Lynd. 

Lynd felt that the strike has brought many results; the most significant of which is the mass turn-in of draft cards. "More draft cards were turned in last week than in the past two or three years."

Labor strikes discussed 
by Mike McCarry 
Senior Phil Webre spoke 

about the history of labor strikes 
in South Bend to a small group 
of students last evening in 
Flanner Hall. The presentation 
was part of the current Com­
muniversity series. . 
Webre focused primarily on 

the Bendix Local No. 9 strike of 
1936. This was, according to 
Webre, the first sit-in, stay-in 
strike in the United States. 
The strike was the result of 
"horrible working conditions," 
and the company's unwillingness 
to recognize the union as the 
sole bargaining agent. 
The striking workers stayed in 
the factory for a week. During 
this time, the he~t was turned 
off, despite the November 
weather. Guards prevented any 
entry to the building. 
lWebre said that food and blan­kets could only reach 1 h,· strikers through factory win­dows. Recognition of the union was the only resolution. 
Th.e. meeting was publicized to the local unions, and Webre expressed disappointment that there were no workers in atten­dance. He said there is a possibility that his presentation might be given at future union meetings.

country, they are going to have to come from the black and white working· classes," Webre said. 
"The I people are mad. They are dissatisfied with their present situation. I think it is important that they are made aware of their very proud history of working for reform." 
Webre stated that it was important that this educational process was also extended to students. He feels that the groups have some common inter­ests, even though their concerns are not identical. 
"It is rather obvious that a graduate who goes into indus­trial management has different interests than the workers. But there are certain goals, such as the end of the war would benefit both groups." .

In this country, all you get out of a pre-fight buildup is a Jot of hokey stories about the challenger's new "secret punch," rumors that the 10-1 underdog has been working out in secret, and reminders that nobody ever gave Gene Tunney a chance either. 
The champ will save a cat from drowning, or stop a team of runaway horses, or lead an old lady out of a burning building; so that the public should buy tickets to a mismatch just out of gratitude to his being such a good guy. 
As to the workouts, you can get as much information out of the all-night poker games in the press room as you can out of the sparring sessions. The management usually hires a bunch of powder-puff punchers or has-beens whose nose has been broken so many times, you know they couldn't get away from a punch if it was delivered in a box. There was once a heavyweigl1 t challenger so out-of-shape they had to BRIBE his sparring partner, when television came round to the training camp, not to knock him out. 
Consequently, Ruben Navarro and his manager, Johnny Flores, were in mild shock when they went to Japan in the summer of 1968 and found that the old American gamesmanship did not apply. The Japanese have a unique system in which they give the gam bier a break. He doesn't have to sit in a tree outside the training camp with binoculars or bribe the camp cook or wait outside the champ's dressing room and count the KOs. The Japanese bring all the fighters on a card together at a given site and time before the fight, invite the press, the bookies, and assorted interested parties-and then ASSIGN the fighters house sparring partners. 
They run the risk of ruining the card, to say nothing of the visiting fighters, because the assigned sparring partner is under no restratnl to make the headliner look good. In fact, some of them regard it as their golden chance. Ruben Navarro, one of the world's best lightweights, was assigned a predator in 12-ounce gloves whose name 
was "Jaguar" for his test. He should have done like that pug in the Searle cartoon who interrupts a contract-signing to say, "Wait a minute. My boy says he don't sign till he finds out precisely why they call him 'The Bushwick Assassin.'" 
Because Ruben shortly found out why they called him "Jaguar." "I was lucky he didn't eat me," said Ruben. "If it weren't for the 12-ounce gloves, it would have taken them a month to scrub up the blood from the "workout." · 
Ruben was to fight the junior lightweight champion, Hiroshi Kobayashi, in an even-money fight; but, after the sparring session, "Jaguar" peeled off his gloves and announced that Ruben would win. "How do you know?" someone asked Jaguar. "Because 1 can beat Kobayashi," coldly announced Jaguar. 
This is a laudable Japanese attempt to introduce some valid criteria in this sport, which should be of some valuable use to guys who have to hang out a line on events. But I don't expect it to make much headway in this country. I mean, 1 can't forsee where the state could assign exercise boys for miming workouts on Derby candidates, or batting practice pitchers to World Series lineups, or live tackling dummies to Super Bowl squads. If we had put somebody to follow the Lakers during the warmups before the seventh game last week, we could have all gone to the movies. Including the Lakers. 
But Ruben's training methods for his fight with Jimmy Robertson at the Olympic Thursday night have returned to the old Barnum methods. He works out only with punching bags. Some of them hang from ·chains and some of them have gloves on. 
But none of them answer to the name "Jaguar" or "Leopard" or Wildcat." 
In Manila, they have an even better method of testing you. Ruben beat Kobayashi, allright, just as Jaguar had predicted, but, in Manila, he fought another junior lightweight claimant, Rene Barrientos. The referee showed up toting a pistol. So did the judges. So did 
Barrientos' handlers. "Is this a duel or a prize fight?" Ruben asked. "It depends," an official told him, "on how the fight goes." Ruben could see the headlines: "The Way Ruben Navarro Won The Junior lightweight Championship Of The World Here Tonight. The Funeral Will Be Wednesday." He won the fight-but not by much. To his intense relief, they gave the decision to Barrientos. Under the circumstances, this was an act of genuine hospitality. R_uben is ~ 2-1 favorite over Robertson this week without having 
to frght a gnzzly to earn it. He didn't have to rescue a kidnapped child. And, if he knocks Robertson down, he won't have to take c?ver. His main problem is going to be to keep from yawning all 
nrght.
