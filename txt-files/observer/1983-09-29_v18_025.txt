Notre Dame shows 'progress' in salaries 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame has made "extraor­dinary progress" in raising faculty salaries, according to a study by the Office of the Dean of Administra­tion. Salaries for faculty have been raised an average of 46 percent over the last four years, the report notes, and, using statistics made available annually by the American Associa­tion of University Professors (AAUP), it documents. 
Jump in average 9-month faculty salary levels by Notre Dame over other doctoral-granting, research universities is as follows. Average salaries for full professors at Notre 

·Dame ($40,719) went from a rank of 94th to 53rd between 1978-79 and 1982-83. Those for associate professor ($31,305) went from a ranking of 62nd to 21st and those for assistant professor ($25,090) from 9th to 18th. 
The University, the report says, 
is very near its goal of achieving an AAUP rating of "1" (top 20th percentile) for average salaries in all teaching ranks. In 1982-83 it achieved this rating for all but full professors. When Notre Dame is compared to with a group of 10 peer universities, including Princeton, Johns Hopkins, Nor­thwestern, Duke, and Brown, it again lost only at the rank of full professor. Seven of the ten schools have higher average salaries at that level. At the associate level, however, only three of ten are higher than Notre Dame, and only two of ten at the assistant level. In another comparison, this time with Big Ten universities, only three were ahead of Notre Dame at the full professor level, while Notre Dame had a higher average associate professor salary than all Big Ten schools. Only two Big Ten schools paid assistant professors more.

Judge rules against Kings Cellar 
By KEVIN BINGER 
StaffReporter 
A U.S. district judge in Lafayette, Indiana refused to place a restrain­ing order Tuesday on the proposed merger between American National Bank of South Bend and Valley Bank of Mishawaka brought by Kings Cellar Liquor Store owner Robert Anderson. 
The dispute between American National Bank and Anderson began in September, 1981, when American National Bank seized deposits totalling $200,000 from B­J's Liquors, Inc., which then owned the chain of Kings Cellar Liquor Stores. 
The move forced Anderson, president of B-J's Liquors, to file for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act and, ac­
cording to Anderson, almost forc­ed the Kings Cellar chain out of business. "They (American National Bank) felt that they were not secure," said Anderson. "They felt that there wasn't enough collateral and they didn't want us to expand anymore." 
Anderson disagreed and last February sued American National for $45 million in lost profits and $135 million in punitive damages. 
Thomas Wilkinson, president of American National, declined com­ment on the case because it is still in litigation. 
Anderson attempted to block the merger of the two banks because he believed the necessary liquidation of the bank's assets involved in the move could defraud him in attemp­ting to gain damages. 
"The judge would not retain the 


Bench pressing 

restraining order because he deem­ed the $600,000 (set aside to protect the bank against liabilities) and their (the two banks) combined assets provided enough security," said Anderson. "We've reached an undPrstanding and we secure." 
Kings Cellar Liquor Stores are no longer in danger of going out of business. As part of the bankrupt­cy reorganization, ownership of the liquor stores was transferred to Robert C. Anderson, Inc., of which Anderson is the sole stockholder. 
"It's a new corporation and it's doing very well, thanks to Notre Dame students," said Anderson. "The old corporation (B-J's Li­quors) is just a shell continuing the lawsuit." 
The two banks will sign the merger agreement Friday and open for business Monday morning as Vallev American Bank.

Senate ready to oust Watt; Reagan says issue closed 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -James Watt will stay on as interior secretary and President Reagan "considers the matter closed," a White House spokesman said yesterday. But a survey of Republicans, coupled with a unanimous Democratic caucus, showed a clear majority of the Senate ready to request Watt's resignation. 
And House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois had harsh words for the interior secretary following a White House meeting, claiming calls for his resignation "may not be all that far from the mark." 
The Senate may face within days a resolution drafted by Minority and insulting to all Americans" when he referred to an advisory panel last week as "a black... a woman, two Jews, and a cripple." 

Senate Republican sources, who asked not to be identified, said that a survey conducted privately by Majority Leader Howard H. Baker, Jr., R-Tenn., for the White House suggested that the resolution would prevail, possibly by a com­fortable margin. The survey show­ed the measure would pick up more than 13 of the Senate's 55 Republicans. Earlier yesterday, Senate Democrats voted unanimously in a closed caucus to support the resolution. 
Chief presidential spokesman Larry Speakes told reporters at a White House briefing that public sentiment against Watt seemed to be easing. While letters and telegrams were running heavily against Watt last week, they now seem to be "evening up," he said. He declined to be more specific. 
"The president considers the mat­ter closed. It's behind us," Speakes said. 
Baker said earlier yesterday he thought that the congressional clamor over Watt had crested. Baker told reporters that Watt is "a little better off today than he was a few days ago." 
But Michel, the House Republican leader, said Watt clear­ly had hurt the administration, and that no official "is an indispensable

The phone rang constantly and the mail poured into Larry McDonald's Capitol Hill office for about two weeks after a Soviet fighter plane shot down a Korean jetliner with the Georgia congressman aboard. But, the world then moved on to other matters, and McDonald's office is now a sad and quiet place. The man in charge there is a former Hoosier named Fred Smith who grew up in Mishawaka, Ind., and attended Purdue Universi­ty. He was McDonald's administrative assistant when the con­gressman was alive. He now has the title of administrator and duties he could do without. "It's been tough going through Larry's personal effects and papers," Smith said. "I've had to sort and pack up things to send to various places and get ready to close the office down. Technically, all of us employed here are now working for the clerk of the House. We have to move out into a holding office by Oct. 18. This office is in a desirable location, and congressmen with seniority want to move in. Life goes on." Oct. 18 is also the date a special election will be held in Georgia's 7th District, an area that centers on Marietta, for the Democratic McDonald's congres­sional seat. -AP 
The Lebanese government yesterday scrapped plans to reopen the Beirut airport today after Druse militia leader Walid Jumblatt threatened to shell it. Public Works Minister Pierre Khoury said he would keep the airport closed until a truce supervision committee, made up of representatives from the army and Druse, Christian and Shiite Moslem militias, "completed discussions on the issue and security arrangements in and around the airport." Khoury had said the airport would reopen today. But Jumblatt said he would consider the reopening a violation of the three-day-old civil war truce. Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Par­ty claimed in a statement that the government turned the airport into a "military position from which the regime used its warplanes which attacked innocent civilians in the mountains.-AP 
Fewer drunken drivers and the increased use of seatbelts help explain a drop in the number of highway deaths reported in the first five months of this year, safety officials say. The National Safety Council said Tuesday the rate of traffic deaths across the nation from January to May was the lowest since 1913, when the council began keeping records. In the first five moflths, there were 2.7 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles. This compares to 2.93 for all of 1982, the lowest yearly average on record, said Barbara Carraro, the council's supervisor of motor vehicle statistics. In the first five months of this year, there were 16,530 traffic fatalities compared to 17,280 over the same 1982 period, a drop of 4 percent. The figures indicate there is more awareness of the need for safety devices, more drivers obeying the 55 mph speed limit and less drinking while driving, council of­ficials said. Ms.Carraro could not project a death rate for the re­mainder of 1983 or predict an average per 100 million miles that would be lower than last year. -AP "--':-.....

South Shore cleans up act­'Vomit Comet' gone forever 

They're gone. 
Those burnt orange and maroon cars of the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad made their final run last Sunday. At 9:40 a.m., six late­1920s vintage electric cars left South Bend's Amtrack station on their way to downtown Chicago. 
Before it finished its two-hour five-minute run, the train brought out every train buff and television camera crew in the area. "The Little Train That Could" passed through New Carlisle, Michigan City, Gary, East Chicago, and Hammond on its way to a final welcome at Chicago's Randolph St. station. 
Most of the old cars will be sold to collectors or museums, according to Richard Bunton, South Shore's passenger traffic manager. One such collec­

tor, who paid $600 for four inoperable cars, plans to invest $130,000 in each to renovate them. 
According to Bunton, last Sunday\run culminated a year-long changeover program which replaced the 50 old cars with 44 new stream-lined cars. 
The 75-year-old South Shore railroad did not buy the new cars, which cost approximately $1 million each, but leases them from the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District (NICTD) and the Ohicago Regional Transportation Authority (RTA). 
Japanese companies supplied wheels and body shells for the new cars. u.s. workers produced and assembled the majority of parts, including engines, cooling systems, and seats. 
In recent years, the old cars had become so dilapidated, South Shore earned the nickname, "Vomit Comet." Torn seats, rotting wood, and

unreliable engines gave passengers the impression the railroad was on its last wheel. 
Much as downtown South Bend degenerated during the late 1960s and early 1970s, so too did the South Shore trains deteriorate. 
Few passengers believed they would miss the filthy restrooms or noxious cigarette smoke. Freezing winter mornings and stifling summer evenings were enough to make many Chicago-bound-travelers think twice about riding the rolling slum. 
Forgotten were the days when few students had automobiles -efficient and clean South Shore trains were the only way Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students could get to Chicago. 
New cars, however, are only the first segment in the railroad's plans to regain prestige. Within two years, South Shore could even move from the Amtrak train station on West Washington Ave. to Michiana Regional Airport. 
The plan, which was proposed by the airport, has the approval of South Shore and the Saint Joseph County representative to NICTD, according to Bun­ton. 
The station could move to the airport as soon as air­port officials collect enough money to lay track and erect power lines to connect the main railroad line and Michiana Regional. 
Bunton believes the move would be in the best in­terests of the railroad and the city, as the move would combine airplane, bus and train service at one passenger hub. 
But with the good news comes the bad: NICTD and RTA are asking for a rate increase to help fund the operating expenses of the South Shore. Fares now ac­count for only 50 percent of South Shore's operating expenses-175 employees serve 9,000 commuters each weekday. 
If approved, the increase would mean passengers would pay approximately 10 percent more than they now do beginning October 15. A one-way ticket from South Bend to Chicago would increase from $6.40 to $7.00. But not every fare would increase, says Bun­ton. South Shore intends to offer a special Sunday fare-at $5.60 for a one-way ticket. 
Bunton says such a discount fare as well as the riding comfort of the new trains should convince more passengers the days of the "Vomit Comet" are over. 
And a~ a frequent rider of South Shore, I think he's right.

Andropov condemns talks 'prattle' 


Tom Sullivan and Brian Fenton, Flanner freshmen, make serious moves to bone up on the court system. The newly-installed lights at the outdoor basketball courts at Stepan Center have lured potential Pax­

Associated Press 
MOSCOW-Soviet leader Yuri V. Andropov yesterday condemned what he called American "unwill­ingness to conduct serious talks of any kind" on arms control. 
He dismissed the "so-called new move" by President Reagan to limit nuclear weapons in Europe as nothing essentially different from previous U.S. proposals. 
The official news agency Tass carried excerpts of what it said was a statement yesterday by Andropov containing the Kremlin leader's first reaction to Reagan's new of­fer. 
Reagan told the United Nations on Monday that Washington was willing to forgo deployment of an unspecified number of the 572 Per­shing 2 and cruise missiles NATO plans to start installing in Europe in December and to negotiate on reducing the number of planes able to carry nuclear weapons -if the Soviet Union reduced its medium­range missile force. 

Nixon endorses aid to Nicaragua 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Former Presi­dent Richard Nixon said yesterday the United States must combine long-term military and economic support for friendly Central American countries to help deter the spread of Marxism throughout the region and into Mexico. 
Speaking to reporters after testi­fying to the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America, Nixon endorsed U.S. covert opera­tions in Nicaragua. He said a Marxist victory in El Salvador "would mean another Soviet base in the Americas." 
Indicating he embraces the "domino theory" in Cent'ral America, Nixon said defense of El Salvador is crucial to future stabili­ty in the region. 
If the leftist guerillas triumph there, ''the impact on the surroun­ding countries and on Mexico could be enormous," he said. 
The former president, 70, walked with a slight limp after emerging from his two-hour closed-door ap­pearance that reunited him with the man who was his foreign policy partner during his 5-year presiden­cy, Henry A. Kissinger, the com­mission chairman. It was Nixon's first visit to the State Department since leaving the White House nine years ago. 
Kissinger thanked Nixon for a "very comprehensive and extraor­dinarily thought-provoking presen­tation." Praising Nixon's remarks to reporters, Kissinger said, "Now all we need is to get the president to write the report," a reference to the policy recommendations the com­mission is preparing for President Reagan. 
While stressing the need to com­bat Marxism in Central America, Nixon said it would be a mistake to become obsessed with that issue. 
He suggested that '1. "very bold" long -term program -or ..~ least 10 years duration -is needed to help Central America, adding that the cost will exceed even that of the post-war Marshall Plan that helped put Western Europe on its feet in the early 1950s. That program cost the United States $13.3 billion in loans and grants over four years.

He made the offer conditional on Soviet readiness to reduce its cur­rent force of an estimated 351 SS­20 missiles and other SS-4 and SS-5 missiles targeted on Western Europe. 
NATO decided in December 1979 to counter the Soviet weapons with the Pershing 2s and cruise missiles if there were no agreement by late 1983 on reducing medium­range nuclear weapons in Europe. 
All the American leaders do is "prattle about some flexibility of the United States at the Geneva talks," Andropov said. His state­ment was read in full on the main television evening news. 
The Soviets are against any new missiles in Europe. They say a balance already exists, and that new NATO missiles will give the West military superiority. 
Without referring to Reagan's proposal specifically, Andropov 
· said "another portion of such 'flex­ibility' has just materialized. And the deception contained in it became clear this time as well. To leave aside details, the essence of the so-called new move in the U.S. position -billed as superb -is reduced to the proposal to agree, as before, on how many Soviet medium-range missiles should be reduced and how many new American missiles should be deployed in Europe in addition to the nuclear potential already possessed by NATO."

MANILA, Philippines A 
memorial service for an im­
poverished Filipino shot through 
the head during anti-government 
riots turned into a demonstration 
against President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos yesterday. Students parad­
ed with clenched fists, chanted and 
sang nationalist songs. 
Marcos, meanwhile. claimed the 
mounting political turmoil posed 
little threat to his 18-year-old 
regime. "Don't fear that we are in 
any way panicked or paralyzed by 
this terrorism," Marcos said in a 
nationwide radio and television ad­
dress. "We never panic, you know 
that." 
But Butz Aquino, brother of · 

assassinated opposition leader 
Benigno Aquino, claimed that 
government officials "see the hand­
writing on the wall, that he's (Mar­
cos) ready to go at any time." 
"Alii can tell you is that we will not 
stop until freedom of the 
Phillipines is achieved. We will 
fight until death," Aquino told the 
church crowd which, after the ser­
vice, marched several blocks to a 
funeral home where the body of 
Benjamin Tamayo, a 25-year-old 
junk dealer, was on display. 
Tamayo was shot through the 

head during anti-Marcos 
demonstrations last week, which 
also left 10 others dead. The 
special Roman Catholic Church 
service for him was attended by 250 
people, mostly students, who 
chanted, paraded with clenched fist 
and sang nationalist songs. 
A banner reading "Oust the U.S.­Backed Marcos Regime" was strung up in the Church of St. An­thony. Another opposition leader, ex-Senator Rene Espina, told the congregation, "He (Marcos) doesn't have to be killed. All he has to do is resign." 
Three priests and a deacon carry­ing a crucifix led the procession to the funeral home. The group said Tamayo was a victim of Marcos' repressive regime, but the slain man's mother said he was an inno­cent bystander who was caught up in the riots when shopping for the family's food. 
Clipped to Tamayo's coffin was a black mourning pin like those worn by supporters of Aquino. The pin carried the opposition's rallying cry, "Ninoy you are not alone." "Ninoy" was the nickname of the opposition leader who was assassinated August 21 as he returned from voluntary exile in the United States.

person... sometimes some of us have to maybe do things to help our president that is easier for some people to do maybe than the presi­dent himself." 
Meanwhile, Rep. Edward Marker, D-Mass., and Stewart McKinney, R-Conn., introduced a House resolution worded almost identically to that sponsored by Byrd. 
But one Republican senator who earlier said that Watt should consider resigning, Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., said yesterday he now will oppose such a call. 
"I have said that Watt should apologize profusely or resign. I believe that he has apologized pro­fusely," Pressler said. 
The senator said anyone nominated by Reagan to replace Watt "would have the same philosophy anyway. And it would take four to six months to set a new team in place." 
Baker cited Pressler's decision to support Watt as one indication that the tide may have changed in Watt's favor in the GOP-run Senate. "In a situation like this, the human element becomes impor­tant. Logic doesn't always apply entirely," Baker said. 
Over the past few days, Watt's congressional allies, including Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., a close friend of the president, have mounted an aggressive lobbying campaign on Watt's behalf. 
A survey conducted by Baker's office showed that, while a majori­ty of Senate Republicans would support Watt in a showdown, the anti-Watt "sense of the Senate" resolution sponsored by Democratic Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia might prevail if the vote were taken soon, sources said. 
Baker's office declined to disclose the breakdown. 
"It looks now like Watt would lose, but just narrowly," given the high degree of Democratic support for the resolution, said one GOP source, who asked not to be iden­tified. There are 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats in the Senate. 
Byrd's measure is an amendment to a nonrelated State Department bill expected to be debated next week.

"Our progress in raising faculty salaries during a period of economic downturn speaks to the commitment we have to keeping and attracting the very best teachers and scholars," commented Professor Timothy O'Meara, Pro­vost of the University. 
The report also points out that Notre Dame salaries buy more than at peer universities because the cost of living in South Bend, as reported by the American Chamber of Com­merce Researchers Association, is lower than that in locations of peer institutions

The tribulations of the freshman year 
Freshman Year. The very mention of those words conjures up images of hundreds ofkids with campus maps in their hack pockets, memories of Thursday night Emil sessions, and echoes of the familiar "Where are you from?" discourse. 
Mary Heilmann 
Reflections 
Mistaking an upperclassman for a freshman constitutes the greatest insult one human can give to another; most freshmen themsdves take great pains to appear knowledgable and confident about all aspects of campus life (if not Chemistry I 1 5 ). But after a month of classes, it is time to evaluate just how well the Clas.'\ of'87 is adjusting to "Domer Life." 
Prohahly the higgest prohlem facing a Notre Dame freshman is the campus itself, that maze of paths connecting an array of anonymous ivy-covered huildings. During the first days, it was not unusual to hear inquiries of"llow can I get to O'Shag from the Rock?" or to see a freshman circle the Library three 
times in search of the Math and Computer Center. 
Although provided with pamphlets ranging from "Know the Rockne Memorial" to "Which Dorm is Home?", the typical freshman would loath to hrand himself FRESHMAN by consulting the maps in hroad daylight. As a result, many muddled students found them­selves roaming the halls of Cushing looking for their Intermediate French class. 
Another equally formidable obstacle on the road to hecoming "real" Notre Dame students was "Domer Talk." Freshmen soon discoverd that ALL upperclassmen refer to the library as The 'Brar, that the Nazz is not the name of a dining hall concoction, and that the Huddle is not even remotely connected to the Stadium. 
Learning that the freshman register is affec­tionately, if not somewhat de-rogatively, called The Dog Book, proved alarming to many female freshmen, and males of the species who habitually eat in Room AofNorth Dining Hall found similar alarm in the room's nickname: Gay A. 
Even classes have labels -Fidgets with Digits, Rocks for jocks, and Baby Bio among them. Learning the language, however, is a big part ofovercoming the stigma ofbeing a fresh­

man, and most new students took to memoriz­ing the words Rock, O'Shag, and The Pit with a vengeance. (Although the term "laking" remains an enigma to those residents of the center ofcampus.) 
Lest I forget, there is one other aspect of Notre Dame life which each freshman is sub­jected to: dining hall cuisine. The trauma of substituting veal au parma, flourescent gravy, and zucchini frittata for Mom's roast beefand stuffed turkey compelled some desperate freshmen to give up the idea ofeating entirely 
and to depend on dormitory food sales for subsistence. "Make Your Own Sundae" night quickly became an event worth marking on one's calendar and the highlight ofeach fresh­man's week. And, of course, the dining halls soon initiated each freshman into that quin­tessential college element: waiting in line. 
By now, however, and fortunately for every member of the Class of '87, we have become true Domers. The signs of the successful transition from naive freshmen to worldly col­lege students are quite apparent. Most fresh­men have developed the art of sprinkler dodging, and can maintain both a steady pace and dry clothes while tramping around the campus at night. 
All freshmen, without exception, now realize that Cap'n Crunch is more than just cereal and fill their breakfast bowls according­ly. The milestones of the first Emil night, the panty raid, and the first home football game have passed, and most freshmen have weat­hered them quite well. It seems most of the glaring inadequacies which characterized the former high school seniors faded to 
only minor flaws. 

One thing, however, which all freshmen should strive to maintain is their excitement at really heing here at last Probably everyone has seen at least one freshman staring at the Golden Dome with awe or running around the bookstore, arms filled with Notre Dame memorabilia of every possible description. Such behavior may reveal the dreaded fact that one is a freshman, but four years will pass quickly and we'll wonder if we've really ap­preciated our time here. By the time the fresh­men have reached Senior Year, they will have attained the polish and poise which four years brings. 
In the meantime, be patient when a fresh­man asks for directions or inquires,"What's your major?" After all, old habits are hard to break. 
Underestimating the liberal arts major 
There is a growing trend in the country and this university to underestimate the value of non-technical majors. The number of t·n~inn·rin~ majors is soarin~, and with it the tendt·ncy to hdieve that English, history, psy­chology, and philosophy major~. to name a few, are worthless. I am repeatedly asked, in 
Maura Mandyck 
Perspectives 
tones ran~ing from open skepticism to con­descending amusement what I intend to "do" with an En~lish major. "Do you want to be a trat:her?" I am asked. I am envied because I have no homework. Apparently copious readin~ assi~nments do not constitute "real" homt·work. 
Let mt· paust· hcfore the tone of this article hn:omt·s hitter. I ;1m not claiming that a non­t<.·t·hnical m<Jjor is superior to a technical one. I am merely pointing out the v<Jiuc of hoth. Thost· students, myself included, who tlnd m.1th both incomprehrnsihle and boring and ~cience a necessary evil must sympathize with those students who are less than fascinated with the construction of a paragraph or the daily events of a civilization long since vanished. Because of the intriguing dif­ferences between one person and the next, we must learn to respect all areas ofstudy. "It takes all kinds," as my mother would say. 
But allow me to turn pragmatic. It is painful­ly apparent that in today's computerized, technical world that possibilities of employ­ment exist in greater proportions for those with techniea..... ajors. I read an article recent­ly (we English majors are always reading) that seemed to be an attempt to reassure English and history majors. 
It reported on exactly what non-technical majors "did" with their degrees. It was alarm­ing, to say the least. One was a market re­searcher, one a research secretary for an aged historian and one was working for an advertis­ing firm. Hardly scintillating career oppor­tunities. Also, the policy of ROTC programs to insist upon a technical major closes yet anoth­er avenue. 

It is easy to understand why events like these would cause students to close their En~Lish hooks and plunge enthusiastically into computer programming and chemical engineering. But I would like to urge them not to do it. While it is important to adapt and grow with a changing society, it is equally im­portant to not bury an aspect of this and past societies under a pile ofsilicon chips. 
For example, perhaps one day a great and learned scientist, having imme(sed him or herselfsince childhood in chemical equations and laboratory research, will discover a cure for cancer. The world will surely rejoice. But first, this great and learned scientist must communicate this information to the world. Hopefully, he or she will have at least a rudimentary kowledge of non-technical lan­guage and will be able to communicate. 
Or perhaps, the study of literature will be eliminated from our society . No doubt there are many who would enthusiastically par­ticipate in a world-wide hook burning. But to eradicate the voices ofauthors from times and experiences would be to eradicate our herita~e and, thus, a part ofourselves. Practi­cal concerns aside, reading and writing are considered by many to he the ultimate forms of recreation. 
The study ofhistory is frequently dismissed as reading about dead people and ruined civilizations. But the influence ofthose people and civilizations are still felt today. To under­stood and deal with today's crises, we should understand yesterday's. History does indeed repeat itselfwith frightening accuracy and we can often gain clues as to which direction it will take next by studying the past. 
Perhaps the greatest advantage ofattending a university like Notre Dame is the oppm·­tunity to choose among several colleges. But opening the doors ofone does not forever seal the doors ofanother. Become a well-rounded student and, even while specializing in one area, cultivate an interest in another. Do not allow the technical age to devalue the study of Shakespeare, the Civil War, the thoughts of Freud ... Knowledge in many tlelds equips us better for life.

Bulimia 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to the "Schmen" cartoon by Mr. john Gibbs which appeared in The Observer on Wednesday, September 21. In that cartoon, Mr. Gibbs portrays a member or Notre Dame's Counseling and Psychologi­cal Services laughing hysterically after suggesting to a bulimic caller that they "discuss the problem over lunch." What, I ask, is humorous and entertaining about bulimia, otht·rwise referred to as the "hinge-purge syndrome"? Bulimia is a serious and emotion­ally crippling eating disorder that affects as many as 20 percent ofall college age women in the United States. It is a stress-related 
problem, often traced back to family in­stability and conflict, which may have grave emotional and physical consequences on its victims. 
Obviously Mr. Gihbs has seen the well­publicized 10-wcek self-help sessions for bulimics sponsored by the Counseling and Psychological Services. How tragic that he chooses to make light ofa growing social dis­order rather than encouraging its sufferers to seek out help for themselves. The social stigma attached to this misunderstood disor­der is extremely harmful to those directly or indirectly affected by bulimia. Mr. Gibbs' "humor" only serves to perpetuate this stigma, magnifying the discouragement, help­lessness, and humiliation felt by those who so desperately need counseling. This stigma creates a dangerous "veil ofsilence," a silence 

which may have alarming consequences. I am appalled by Mr. Gibbs' flippancy and lack of sensitivity and compassion. 
When will these cheap shots cease at Notre Dame? Should we also chuckle at alcoholics whose lives are often destroyed by shame, guilt, and despair? Should we snicker at those with drug and chemical dependencies? A similar form of social abuse occurred two years ago with the extremely disturbing and ugly·"No Fat Chicks" incident. 
I am well acquainted with the graveness of bulimia, for I have had my own struggle with this disorder. I consider myselfextremely for­tunate to be well on my way to ret:overy. Others are not as lucky. Recovery is a supreme personal challenge that demands time, patience, faith, hope, and courage. Counseling is also crucial. I encourage all men and women 
at Notre Dame who suffer from bulimia or anorexia nervosa to seek help at the Counsel­ing and Psychological Services. There is hope for recovery.

School pride 

DearEditor: 
School pride is not measured only by how loudly one cheers at a football game, but per­haps even more so by how one takes care of the school property. judging by the amount of trash we saw on the grounds on a recent weekend visit, school pride among some of the student population is next to nil.

N.Y. Jets decide to leave 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The New York Jets of the National Football League are moving to New Jersey and Mayor Edward I. Koch said yesterday the city · would increase its efforts to replace them with another NFL team. 
The Jets will leave 60,372-seat Shea Stadium at Flushing Meadow, their home since 1964, and play in 76,891-seat Giants Stadium, home of the NFL's New York Giants in nearby East Rutherford, N.J. 
"It's clear that they are gone," Koch said at a city hall news conference. The Jets became the second NFL team in a decade to leave New York and move across the Hudson River. The Giants moved out of Yankee Stadium in 1973, spent almost two years in Yale Bowl in New Haven, Conn., and one in Shea before moving into the ballpark bear­ing their name. 
Koch said the city and Jets owner Leon Hess had discussed the fate of the team for about two years, with the city sug­gesting a variety of economic packages to try to keep them in New York. 
"But on Monday, for the first 
time, he told me that under no 
circumstances would the Jets re­
main at Shea Stadium past next 
January," Koch said of the most 
recent negotiating session with 
Hess. 
Harrison Golden, New York's 
comptroller, said the departure 
of the Jets would cost the city 
about $33 million a year. 
AI Davis, though he failed to 
win the support of three­
quarters of the club owners for 
the move, took the Raiders to 
Los Angeles for Oakland and 
won susequent court battles 
upholding his right to move.

NDRugby ''tries'' to win 
The Notre Dame Rugby Club upped its A-side record to 2-1 by beating Ohio State last weekend, 12-7. The A-side match was played for the Cantwell Cup, a traveling cup between the two schools. Notre Dame is now 3-l in games played for the Cup. 
"It was good for us," Club President Geoff Branigan said of the game. 
Roundtown Madden and John Sweeney each had a try, and Steve Schneider went 2-for­2 on conversions. 
The B-side continued their undefeated, unscored-upon year by defeating Ohio State, 4-0. Bill Weiler scored a try and Smokey McCabe played an ex­cellent game for the B-side. 
The C-side didn't fare as well, however, losing to OSU by a 10­3 score. Senior Dave Desaulniers had a penalty kick and Abdul Mapother played an outstanding game for the C­side. 
The club continues its season this Saturday at l :30 against the Cleveland Rovers behind Stepan Center .

"There is no question that professional basketball players are role models for young peo­ple all over the country and par­ticularly in inner cities," Lanier said. "By telling the world that we as professional players will not tolerate the use of illegal drugs, we are setting a new stan­dard, something that is ab­solutely essential in today's en­vironment." No players will be subject to suspension prior to the "amnes­ty period," which ends Dec. 31 this year, according to the agree­ment. In the meantime, all players will be informed in writing and in person at team meetings o~ the crackdown.
