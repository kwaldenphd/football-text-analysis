Tht• past fpw WPeks have bPPn t-xtremely hectic for ~HI' Ed B~TnP and SBVI' .Tom Fitzgerald as they han• bPt'n hus:-.· with the task of appointing new commissiom•rs and cabinet mPmbers for their ad­ministration. !\lost of the appointments have been ma(k. aft(•r a long process of applications and in· !PrviPws. 
In sl'it•ct ing pach mPmber, Byrne had the help of lorm<'r SBI' l'at McLaughlin. SBVP Frank Flanagan. and nwmlwrs of last yt'ar's administration. "The dPcisions W<'rP made on thE' basis of applications, and subst'quPnl in\Prviews." stated Byrne. "We tried lo look for lht• PxpPrienced people, using the kno\\IPdgP gainPd by last year's members." 
Sian Cardt•nas was chosen to get the Executive t'oordinator. a new position developed by Byrne. <'<trdPnas has been active in government since his sophomore year and was the off-eampus com· missiom•r last year. "Stan will be basically a 1 roubl(•shooter, helping in the capacity of advisor to tht• prPsident," offered Byrne. "From my experience with him during my campaign, I know I can trust him to do excellent work," added Byrne. 
The office of Student Government Treasurer will be held by John Hargrave. Hargrave served as assistant treasurer this past year. 
John Lonsborg will be the new Judicial Coordinator and brings to the job three years of experience with the Sorin Hall Judicial board. "Because of his ex­perience within the hall, John was a natural selection for commissioner," stated Byrne. 
A new office has been instituted this year to aid the judicial coordinator. Mary Ellen Keenan has been chosen to be next year's Assistant Judicial Coor­dinator. A member of the Committee for Un­dergraduate life, Keenan was chosen to offer a balance to the Judicial committee. "In light of recent attacks and rape attempts, it seems a good idea to havP a female involved in the judicial process," of-n•strictions. Pight percent favorPd an t·xt<·nsion of the prPsent hours and four p<'n·ent w;m!Pd a reduction of hours while onl:-; Pight p(•rcPnt agrped with present ruks. Th('Sl' rPsults IPd Byrne to con­dud<• !hat changP is nPPded. 
H~Tm's proposal will mPet rejection or ;1ppro1·at nPxt Monday when the SLC consid(•rs thP rPeomm('lldations of the I'Ianning and l'olicy committee.

In n·sponsP to tht• committee's rl'comnwndations in gPneral. HPrgarty hPli<'I'<'S two major goals wPre accom­plish<'d.

~PstPrday  in  rPsponse  to  Michigan  
authoritips'  rPfusal  of  a  onP-day  beer  
pPrmit for tht• Wake.  

According to Director of Security Arthur l'<•ars the Wake Committee informPd him on 1\londay 1\larch 7 that Michael Corn of SunnysidP BPvPragPs had told them they 11 ould ht• unable to obtain the permit. The \\'ak(• CommittPe and officials of Bend-in­th('-Hi\'(•r Conservation Club would be arn•stt'd by StalP Police if the party were lwld. Corn told committee member AI 1\ophJ. 
Th<' n•quPst for thP pPrmit was picked up hy ,\n Tostal Chairman Tom Porter at the St•curit~· Ol'ficP. I'Pars said, on Friday, .\pril II. thP day whPn thP permit was n•fusPd by NilPs Township Police Chief Hillson. I'Pars had obtained the permit torm from a local police station. 
Both l't•ars and [)pan of Students John 1\lacht•ca fpJt thP bt•er pt•rmit was refused llt'caust• som<'onP had already talked to the polit'l'. ''I'm disappointed," Macheca said, "lhat somt'onp's prPPmpted the students' ;1hility to discuss this without a pred­judiced audi(•nct•." 
En•n if nobody had "tipped-Qff" the polit'<'. approval of lhP pPrmit would have ht'Pn doubtful. Michigan Liquor Control .<'om mission authorities PxplainPd.

The permit could not bP takPn out by one organization on lwhalf of anothPr. they Pxplained. 
SamuPl Egan of th(• State Liquor ('ontrol Commission said getting the permit through the Club "would be cir­<'l!Il1\'('nting the law."

"For anyom• to say that wP're going to go out and makl' wholesale arrests and in­~·arn·rat<' pPopiP is totally Proneous," the offict'r in charge of thP Niles commented.

The attorneys ended their cases after Connally, the last of 11 defense witnesses, completed two days of testimony in which he emphat1cally denied charges he accepted a bribe in 1971 for h1s help in convincing President R1chard M. Nixon to increase federal price support for raw n11lk.

Limits growth 
Charismatics affected by Harter·proposal 
by Mary Reher 
Staff Reporter 

In redefining the family more strictly, the Harter Heights zoning amendment affects a number of the Charismatic Community households in South Bend. 
"The lifestyle of our community is to live in households," Com­munity Member Pat Lewson, stated yesterday. "A normal family would have two to four unrelated adults living with the related members of the family. These are usually single adults, either students or working at a job," she noted. 
"The ordinance does not help us at all; we are a growing com­munity; we double our size each vear. The ordinance would limit ~ur growth," she observed. 
Associate Professor of Physics Paul Decelles, another community member, said that certain people objecting to the amendment had designed a counter-proposal containing a "more liberal definition of family" when the council sub-committee formed to design the amendment earlier this 
y~ar. 
The original counter-proposal would permit the number of unrelated people to live in a household be the same as the number of related family mem­bers, according to Community Member Ann_ Kaiser. 
"The 'A' Residential Association was formed of people who wanted a more liberal definition of family," he stated, "which would give more freedom of choice as to whom they would like to live with. Most of the people in the association are members of the Charisma tic Community.'' 
"The proposal we presented to the Council defines a family as two or more persons related by blood, legal adoption or marriage together with persons unrelated by blood, legal adoption or marriage 
living and cooking together as a 
housekeeping unit, •exclusive of 
household servants," said 
Decelles. 
The amendment proposed by 
Roger Parent and approved by the 
Common Council April 7 defined 
the family as one or more persons 
related by blood, legal adoption or 
marriage with one or more per­
sons, not exceeding two not related 
by blood, legal adoption or 
marriage, functioning as a single 
housekeeping unit, exclusive of 
household servants. 
The "A" Residential 
Association's proposal would 
eliminate the possibility of ab­
sentee landlords, Decelles noted. 
Both proposals were presented 
at the Common Council meeting Ap_ril 7, and after being debated for four hours, the Parent proposal 
was approved, Decelles said. 
"Even though five of the council 
men had stated that they hadn't 
had enough time to study Parent's 



HPC revotes for chairman~---­
by Lonnie Luna Staff Heporter 

The HPC officially elected Dillon Hall President Elton Johnson as its Chairman for the upcoming academic year last night in the LaFortune Ballroom after much dispute during the past week. 
Last meeting. the HPC held its 1•lection with candidates Frank present along with the current SBP and SBVP. Ed Byrne and Tom Fitzgerald, respectively, to supervise. 
After Howl and Executive Coordinator Tom Porter signed ballots, Porter called roll and as l'ach hall president came forward, McLaughlin gave them one ballot. After casting their vote, roll was again called and each president 
McGuire. Elton Johnson and Tom Hogan running for the coveted post. In that election. Tom Hogan, former Cavanaugh president, was <>lee ted. However. in the tally, twenty-two votes were cast with only twenty-one presidents present. As a result, a dispute arose in the ensuing week following the election over the voting procedure and the discussions of the candidates. 


"I am really disappointed in you all. The rumors that were started last week turned my stomach," , statl.'d HPC Chairman Bob Howl as he addressed the assembly. "What happened last week was an honest mistake. If it wasn't. I would rather not say." 
To make sure that the election

nanded the ballot to McLaughlin. Th\.' votes were then tabulated by Byrne and Fitzgerald on a black­board so that all could see. After the election, Johnson did not comment. 
After the election, Rich Morton, _former Fisher Hall president and 
current Executive Coordinator of 
the Escort Service, requested the 
HPC to turn in any names of 
volunteers wishing to work on the 
S\.'rvicl.'. 
"The reason for the delay in the start of the Service is due to the fact that there was a Jack of communication between the new and old presidents. Hopefully, this has cleared up. The Service will start on Sunday, April 20," stated Morton. 
Also on the agenda, Brother McTaggert, Assistant Director of Campus Ministry, spoke to the HPC concerning Community SPrvices. Me Taggert requested 1 hat the hall presidents make the hall Community Services Direc­tm·s part of the hall council to make the council aware of the volunteer activites.

P.O. Box Q 
Visitation Hours 

Jh·ar Editor: 
Mh·r n•ading Tuesday's front 
pagl' articll:' on the SLC's 
suggl•stion that \'isitation hours 
n·main unchang<>d, I decided to 
writl' this leltl:'r to <>xpress a few 
thoughts on the matter. 
First. I'd like to take a look at the 
l'OncPpl of limit<>d visitation hours 
in gl'nl•ral. Personally, I consider 
lht>m an insult, as w<>ll as an in­
conwnit-nct>. If my parents did not 
eonsidt•r ml' mature enough to live 
75() mill'S away from home, I 
wouldn't lw ht>re right now. 
llowl•ver, apparently they did so 
ht>n• I am. 
I find it amusing though that the 
l'niv1•rsitv doesn't consider ,7:Jl801l582 matun· l'nough to come and go as he judgt>s fit, when they know zero_ about him. I really don't think it is tht>ir damned business who is visiting my room and when they are going to leave. 
I find it a bit ironic that the 
rPport stresses tht> nt>eds for 
freedom and privacy in its 
rt>commPndations. Privacy can be 
found behind a closed door <girls 
cannot see through doors>, and my 
eoncept of freedom doesn't include 
being bounced out of a friend's 
room at the appointed time. 
ThP final point I would like to takp up is the rPport's contention that thNe is no presuasive arguml'nl for changing the times which are currPntly in effect. 
No less than 80 percent of students polled t>xpressed a desire for more liberal visitation hours. I don't mean to sound like a bomb­throwing radical, but doesn't this resemble a persuasive argument? Mtt•r all, we are paying a premium pricl' to be here. 
A friend once commented to me l>aml' should realize that this is a school. and not a way of life. I couldn't agree more. And when thE'y do rE"alize this, maybe Notre Dame will be all that the outside world thinks it is.

Israeli 'Archaeology' 
l>l'ar Editor: 
The "letter from Innsbruck" dE"scribing Tim O'Reiley's trip to Israel suggests that he swallowed all the propaganda to which he was exposed by the Israelis. 
J<:vidently he made no attempt to understand why the Arabs object to "Israel's national hobby, ar­chaeology." If he didn't have the opportunity to meet Arabs whose homes wpre demolished under the guise of this "hobby," surely he can read. In addition to the discussions at the times UNESCO passPd resolutions and finally sanctions against Israel, he could read the recent article on Jerusalem by John Cooley that appearPd in Thl' Christian Science 1\lontior. 
Cooley reported, "Since 1967, thousand of Arab residents have lost their family homes to Israeli· directed redevelopment. And non· Jews who lived most of their lives here are denied the right to come back and settle, while any Jew can." 
O'Reiley should have had the opportunity to have visited Lebanon at Easter. Each year at that time the Americans for Justice in the Middle East hold a special service to demonstrate their support for the Palestinians' right to return to their homeland. (}<'ather Joseph Ryan has been president of the organization for the past two years.) The l:'cumenical Easter service in 1974 was held in Tyre, adjacent to a refugee camp. 
During the service <which attended), O'Reiley's "passive Israelis" shelled the camp. Israel shells South Lebanon almost daily occasionally <such as about this time last yearl Israeli jets (sup­plied by the U.S.) shelled camps in the heavily populated center of Beirut. Having lived in Lebanon for eight years, I can assure the Israelis aren't passive.

Last wl·ek. in his StatE' of the World Address, President Ford entreated !hl' t'ongn•ss to approve $722 million in military aid to give one last breath of lift• to tht• tot!Prinng. last-legs regimP of Nguyen Van Thieu. It was an d'fort to salvagP what appE'ars to be thE' latest in a series of lies generated h~· lhl' past administration--the claim that Vietnamization was an m·t•rwhdming success.. 
Mll•r yPars of blind approval of Johnson's and Nixon's numerous n•quPsts for throwing away millions of dollars on this undeclared war, ! 'ongrPss has finally decidE'd to t-xercise its control of the purse strings by n•fusing to grant Ford his latest wish. Ford's implicit attempt to pin the hlaml' for South Vietnam's demise on Congress, a Congress in which he, as a forml'r Ht•publican House minority leader, often marshalled support for Nixon's war policil:'s, is only further proof of the shallowness of this 
man. 
I'l'rhaps our golfing president <''Dr. Ford'', since March 17) thinks that carr~·ing a l'ouple of war orphans off an airpbnl:' will sufficiently atone for his hawkish record in Congress, or that by running away from 1wwsm1'n hl' can shrug off his past involvement in 'Nixon's War'. If so, I'm sun• thl'rt' is plenty of space available in San Clemente for another jokt•r. 
II would lw unfair. howPver. to singlE' our Mr. Ford for living up to his !niP sPif. ! 'alling for military aid which can only rl:'sult in more death and dPstruetion for lhl' \'iE"tnamt>se peoplE' is, after all, quite in keeping with Ford's past lwhavior. No. WP must not concern ourselves with a man who ;~chiP\'Pd lhP prPsidPncy by default. but with thE' real architE"cts of the l'ni!Pd S!att•s' ViPtnam war policy--Rostow McNamara, Rusk, WE'st­mor<'land ..Johnson. KissingPr, Nixon. and those othE'r high ranking of­fil'ials who hPipPd shapP the tl.S. war policies of the sixties. These are the nwn who. dirt>clly or indirectly !at this point. does it make any dif­l<•n•m·p'' l sl•nt 55.000 AmPricans to thE"ir dl:'ath in what Hubl:'rt Humphrey ont'l' l'aiiPd ':\mPrica's greatest advE"nlure.' ThPse wpre smart mPn, hrighl ml'n. lhP mPn of vision whosE' war would give the English language :-;ul'h nwmorabll' \'t•rbal jewds as "good". "a generation of pPace". and "Jl~'<H't' 1rith honor". 
1\ut no purposl' is sPrvPd ht•rp by pointing fingers at who is to blame for !his shaml'ful travesty of human suffE'ring. Placing the blamP on t 'ongn•ss will not setUP lhl' immPdiatt> plight of the refugees. who could l'an· IPss about domino lhPoril:'s or congressional intransigence. As ,\nwrieans.

This apparPnt ambiguity in l'haral'!l'r t'Prtainly says somt'thing about American values 1although 11 hat il says I am not all that surP). 
In lh<• wakt• of Vietnam. we must ask ourselves "What can be salvaged from this IPrribiE' tragl'dy?" For the South Vietnamese, therE' is nothing hut a ravagPd and war-torn land.

INebraska: novices win 
by Maureen t'lynn Women's lightweight crew d:mtinued a spring season winning streak by defeating their NPbraska contenders in an away meet last Saturday. The Irish varsity pulled away from their opponents in a 200 meter power sprint and crossed the finish 3 boat-lengths in the lead. The women's novice eight likewise disposed of their l'<l'lmtska competition by a distance of 4 boat-lengths <about 60 meters). The novice four carried off the .. honors for the Notre Dame men.

Golfers fourth at Indianapolis 
by Tom Kruczt>k 
Notre Dame's golf team ran into its first disappointment of the year Monday at the Indianapolis In­tercollegiate Tournament, finishing in fourth place behind Purdue. The Irish finished the 36­hole event with a 766 total, 15 strokes off the pace set by the Boilermakers. Jeff Burda was the high individual for Notre Dame, finishing in fourth place with a six­over par 146. 
Coach Noel O'Sullivan, although pointing out that the fourth place finish was very respectable, felt that Notre Dame should have done better.'' ''After 18 holes we were in third, just eight strokes from the lead. Then we had five front nines on the second 18 of under 40, while Ball State's top three men all shot 
in the 40's. But. on the last 9, the situation was reversed, they shot in the low 30's while we were in the 
40' w · ht h b t

had a mediocre finish." 

The Irish, although disappointed with the fourth place, did not fare badly at all in the 15 team tourney. Hich Knee finished the tourney with 153 good for 18th place while Paul Koprowski followed in 19th place with 154. Jim Culveyhouse Pnded in 22nd with 158. Eddie Whelan and 1\likP Kistner rounded out the team with 159 and 160, respectively. 
O'Sullivan commented that this week, the Irish will try to play less on the course, and try to get in more sessions on the practice tee. "The reason we are not gelling is

more physiological than psychological. Our preparation is not intense Pnough, we need to play less and practice more." 
ThP Irish will have less than a WPek to prepare, as the next stop willbe Friday in Columbus, Ohio at the Kepler Invitational on the campus of Ohio State. The Kepler is a 54-hole event with 24 teams including eight Big Ten schools, Ball State, and Penn State com­peting. Each of the invitationals are important to the Irish golfers, as with each good performance, they will come closer to receiving the much sought after at-large bid in the NCAA national tournament.
