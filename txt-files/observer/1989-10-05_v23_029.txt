Twist and shout 
By MARIA MILANO Staff Reporter 
"The film 'The Last Tempta­tion of Christ' is controversial not because of the issue with which it deals but what makes it controversial is the violence which it does to the representa­tion of Christ," Communications Professor James Collins said at a debate on the film Wednesday night. 
"The representation of Christ which we have seen in the past is one based on the Renaissance tradition of Christ, a represen­tation of one who quotes Scrip· ture," Collins continued. 
Collins said, "There is an unusual system [in the film] in which the whole resistance and doubt are seen. We see Christ's tension about himself, and ten­sion about his message that has never been depicted in film

Intellectual Life Committee considers year's goals 
By COLLEEN MALLOY News Staff 
With the hopes of fostering a greater intellectual envi­ronment at Notre Dame, the Intellectual Life Committee met Wednesday for the first time this year. The commit­tee, consisting of students, faculty, and administrators, focused its attention on the further development of the Hall Fellows program. 
The Hall Fellows program works to enhance the inter· action between students and faculty. Referring specifi­cally to Pasquerilla East and St. Edward's Hall. committee members noted the accomplishments of the Hall Fellows program in some dorms. 
The committee wishes to institutionalize the program so that all dorms will be able to achieve similar success. said Ken Scheve. student government academic com­missioner. He added that there is a need to "gather and distribute information on what kind of events have worked to stimulate intellec­tual life and make student­faculty relations better." 

The committee is concen* trating on three main goals for this year. First, It will evaluate the recommenda­tions of past committees and monitor the responses that have followed. Second, it will formulate practical methods to improve the pre· sent intellectual conditions. 
Chairman Nick Rossi de· scribed the third goal as one to "provide vision through open debate about the best courses to take to further

Panel debates the film 'The Last Temptation of Christ' 
By MAGGIE MCCLOSKEY Staff Reporter 
Acquaintance rape and "Crossed Signals on a Saturday Night: Straight Talk About Dating" were the topics of a lecture given Wednesday night by Barry Burkhart of Auburn University. 
Burkhart opened his talk by explaining the difficulty found in discussing acquaintance rape because the topic does not lend itself to clear communica­tion. 
Opposing images of the word 'date' and the word 'rape' also complicate a universal under­standing of date rape, Burkhart said. 
Burkhart claimed that the

The Observer/ Lynn Pfeffer 
word 'date' has relatively pleasant connotations; 
Theology department said that the film was "not a narrative but more of a burning image that stays in ones mind and helps one feel what Jesus has gone through." 
Professor Mark Pilkinton of the Communications and The­ater department stated, "the actual temptation of Christ was a real temptation. In the desert Jesus' temptation almost got the better of him." 
Pilkinton said that he was pleased to see a real Christ who could be genuinely tempted and who over came the temptation. 
The sexual nature of Jesus portrayed in the movie was also discussed. Sister O'Neill stated that "sexual mores are the same to the Catholic tradition as dietary restriction are to the Jewish tradition. Speaking of sexuality of Christ strikes olence, aggression, fear, and harm. 
"When you put the word 'date' and the word 'rape' together, they don't overlap, they don't match. It's very often the case that people will not talk about date rape." 
Studies at Auburn and a num­ber of other universities have shown that a woman is so times more likely to be raped by someone she knows than by a stranger. Between the ages of 15-25, 15-20% of all women will have at least one instance of forced sexual intercourse. 
In order to determine the causes of the prevalence of ac­quaintance rape, Burkhart questioned why men and women encounter harm as the outcome of a relationship. 
Burkhart said, "One of the

Noriega blames revolt on U.S. 
Associated Press 
PANAMA CITY, Panama ­Troops patrolled the city's lightly traveled streets Wednes­day and U.S. helicopters watched from overhead on the day after rebel soldiers tried in vain to overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
'The gringo piranhas want to do away with me," the general, who commands the military and controls the government, said during a brief tour of the street outside Panamanian De­fense Forces headquarters. 
He blames the revolt on the United States, which has tried to oust him for nearly two years. The Bush administration denied involvement. 
Spokesmen for Noriega said some of the rebels took refuge at U.S. Southern Command headquarters in Quarry Heights. Southern Command spokesmen would not come to the telephone and no comment 
was available from the U.S. 
Embassy. 
Newspapers reported six people killed in the coup at­tempt Tuesday morning. 
Maj. Edgardo Lopez, an aide to Noriega, would not confirm casualty figures or reports that Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, the Urraca commander and coup leader, was among the dead. He said at least 60 soldiers and four or five officers were ar­rested. 
Every few minutes, heli­copters of the U.S. Southern Command circled over the perimeters of Quarry Heights and Fort Amador. The two U.S. bases at the western edge of Panama City are a few hundred yards from the Panamanian headquarters, where the coup was attempted. 
At the headquarters on VVednesday, loyal troopers in T­shirts and baseball caps re­paired shattered windows and painted and patched the walls. 
Traffic moved along the streets nearby, but vehicles were not permitted to stop. 
Many Panamanians chose to stay home Wednesday and U.S. bases were shut under condi­tion Delta, which restricts movement of personnel. About 12,000 American soldiers are stationed in Panama. 
The uprising "aggravated the Panamanian crisis in every di­mension and makes it more dangerous," opposition leader Ricardo Arias Calderon told a midday news conference. He said the military regime "is di­vided against itself and rejected by the great majority of the people." 
Civilian opponents of Noriega have denied involvement. The United States has supported the opposition's efforts against the general, who was indicted in the United States on drug charges in 1988, and has im­posed economic sanctions in an attempt drive him out.

WORLD BRIEFS 


Restaurant work is not all 
Members of the Irish Republican Army on Wednesday shot and killed a Roman Catholic after mistaking him for a Protestant gunman, police in Belfast said. The victim, 52-year-old 

peaches and cream 
James Henry Babbington, was shot point-blank by two men 
outside a primary school. the Royal Ulster Constabulary said. In a statement to local news media, the predominantly Catholic IRA claimed it killed a gunman who was involved in several attacks against IRA members. The IRA statement gave a name of the purported victim, but it was not Babbington. "The victim was an entirely innocent man who was on his way to work," the Constabulary said in a statement late Wednesday. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 
The Coast Guard seized a ship carrying 11,500 pounds of cocaine -the largest maritime cocaine seizure in history, Coast Guard officials said Wednesday. The Zedom Sea, a 185-foot off­shore supply vessel reportedly headed from Colombia but flying the Panamanian flag, is being escorted to New Orleans, said Rear Adm. William Merlin. Nine people aboard were arrested and will be turned over to the Drug Enforcement Administration, he said. "We are not sure we have found all the cocaine," Merlin said at a news conference at regional Coast Guard headquarters here. "We arc turning it over to Customs." 
A crippled B-1 B bomber refueled over Texas and flew halfway across the continent Wednesday for an emergency landing on the dry lake bed where the space shuttle lands. The $280 million aircraft, unable to unlock its nose landing gear, was ex­pected to touch down on the 44-square-mile Rogers Dry Lake about 5 p.m., said base spokeswoman Dottie Spiegelberg. The air­craft. flying out of Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, wasn't carrying bombs. "There are no nuclear weapons." said Lt. Anu Sjaardema, an Edwards public affairs spokeswoman. 
The odds of getting an AIDS infection from a typical blood transfusion were just 1-in-28,000 two years ago, and the risk is dropping more than 30 percent a year as fewer AIDS carri­ers are donating blood, a study says. "The blood supply is proba­bly safer now than it has ever been," concludes the study, con­ducted by the American Red Cross. However, another report cau­tions that some people at high risk of the disease still give blood despite appeals to refrain, and blood banks should try harder to persuade them not to donate. 
Plumbers and toilet makers told a Senate panel in Washington Wednesday the American public won't sit still for Sen. Wyche Fowler's plan to reduce by more than half the af!lount _of water used in each flush. "When the amount of water IS cut m half. there is reason to doubt whether the system will operate properly," said George Bliss, assistant _director of training for the United Association of Plumbers and P1pefitters. 
A man was awakened when a stranger jumped into his bed in his home in St. Paul, Minnesota and police followed to yank the intruder out. "Basically, I think the guy was just trying to hide," said Officer Tim McCarty. The man did not know the people in the house, authorities said. The woman who owns the house said the stranger ran through several rooms before charging up a staircase and into her 20-year-old son's room. The startled resi­dent looked on as police pulled the man out of bed. The man was arrested on a charge of burglary because he entered the home without permission, McCarty said.

human beings, never, never work in a 
restaurant. 
I worked for about a year and a half at a place called Friendly's, sort of a cross between a Denny's and a Dairy Queen. I went in young and innocent, eager to do my best to serve the customer. I left a distorted, bitter misanthrope, thirsting for vengeance, wanting to hurt and maim those who had wronged me. 
I am firmly convinced that people undergo a complete attitude. change when they enter a restaurant. Somebody may normally be an upright, decent citizen. It doesn't make any difference. As soon as they enter a restaurant, they become cruel, domineering tyrants, treating the staff as if they were chattels. 
When we were waiting to close, for example, there would inevitably be two people holding us up , sitting over a single cup of coffee each for a half-hour. 
We had ways to subtly give the hint, "Leave NOW!!" 
The gate at the front of the store would lowered halfway. We would shut off all the lights in the place except the section they were sitting in. The rest of the tables would be cleaned off and set up for the next day. 
If this didn't work, the entire staff would stand and pathetically stare at the offenders, trying to look as pitiable as possible. The dishboy would go up to them and say, "Excuse me, ma'am, but are you done with that fork and plate? I have nothing else to do right now, so I'd like to wash them." 
Even this didn't work. They would just keep on sitting over their coffee, saying things like, "Gee, Matilda, remember that time when I got 20 percent off that purple flower print at Bloomingdale's?" 
Almost as bad as this was having to serve the take-out line. The price of ice cream cones was raised from 96 cents to $1.01, but people weren't used to it yet, and so they would give me a dollar for their cone. 
''I'm sorry, but I need one more cent," I'd say. 
"Oh, okay," they'd reply, and proceed to give me a $50 bill, so I'd have to make $48.99 in change. 
People have been trained since childhood to treat restaurant employees like pond scum. Once, when I was serving take-out, a seven­year-old girl was having a birthday party. She could have gotten something to go at the table, but that was too easy. 
Instead, she went to the take-out line. There

were nine people in line in front of her, but she pushed her way to the counter, shoved her grubby little face forward and announced in an obnoxious, nasal voice, "I want ice cream!" 
"I'm sorry," I said (even though I wasn't), "but you'll have to wait until I serve the people in front of you." 
"NO!" she screamed. "It's MY BIHTHDAY and 
I want ICE CREAM!!" 
Her mother was standing behind her the entire time, with a small, approving smile upon her face. "I must be bringing my daughter up right. She's learning how to be a demanding, rude, thoughtless customer. I'm so proud!" 
Kids weren't the worst customers, though. What we all dreaded at Friendly's was the invasion from the Old Folks' Home. A typical order would go something like this: 
"Give me a a grilled cheese sandwich, with one slice of wheat and one slice of white. Don't use too much butter cooking it -.about half a pat. And use Swiss and Provolone cheese -no American." 
Or they would get a: hamburger, eat all of it except one bite, and then complain, "This is undercooked. I want a refund." 
Even leaving the restaurant they would get in their licks. 
They would whine at the cashier, "The bill says the coffee costs 50 cents, but I only drank half a cup. I should only have to pay 25 cents!" 
And the people who sat at the counter! I could tell you some stories ...

Propane (CH3CH2CH3) may be automotive fuel of future 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Amid the morning rush of commuters, the white Ford Taurus blended well with the hundreds of other cars on Washington's traffic­clogged six-lane Beltway. 
But as the sedan passed an 18-wheeler at 60 miles an hour, the driver flicked a switch just below the dashboard and the Taurus became like no other car on the busy highway. 
It was now running on propane instead of gasoline. 
As Congress moves toward enacting tougher laws to com­bat urban pollution and other environmental concerns, includ­ing global warming, the word is out: The 1990s may well be­come the decade in which the alternative-fuel automobile with its fewer pollutants will chal­lenges the conventional gaso-

Changes have occurred as a result of the Intellectual Life Committee's work, said Rossi. For example, the committee emphasized the need for non­classroom space for student­faculty interactions. 
Many of the new buildings have been designed to include such gathering areas. Looking toward the new school year, the members highlighted the need to obtain even more concrete responses to their recommendations. 
Student government Pres­line-powered car. 

President Bush has proposed legislation calling for a phase­in of thousands of alternative­fuel vehicles beginning in 1995 and for production of at least 1 million such cars a year by 1997 in urban areas with the worst smog. 
William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, says there is no other way to attain a significant re­duction in urban smog and still acknowledge Americans' love of their automobiles than to phase in large numbers of cars that use cleaner fuels than gasoline. 
As a result, there has been a rush to Washington by almost every conceivable maker and promoter of alternative fuels in an attempt to carve out a niche in that yet-to-be-defined future market of motor vehicles. 
ident Tom Doyle and Vice President Mike Pease formed this committee in response to the intellectual life reports compiled by student govern­ment. These reports, presented to the Board of Trustees, detailed the need to improve intellectual interactions on campus. 
The presidential election and the student government's Iceberg Debates stimulated the level of extracurricular intellectual activity on campus last year, according to a report issued by the committee. The Intellectual Life Committee wants to insure that such activity and exchange of ideas remains an integral part of campus life.

Three killed in Gulf explosion 
Associated Press 
SABINE PASS, Texas ­More than 100 Coast Guard personnel were joined by park rangers Wednesday in the search for eight people missing after a fishing boat struck a gas pipeline and ex­ploded in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Three people were killed and three others injured in the accident, which hap­pened just before dark Tues­day. The 20-square-mile search was hampered by the suspected presence of haz­ardous chemicals. 
"If they were presumed dead, we wouldn't be search­ing," Coast Guard Lt. Scott LaRochelle said. "The prob­ability is high but there is still a possibility (of sur­vivors). There's always a hope." 
Mike Benson, spokesman for the National Transporta­tion Safety Board in Wash­ington, said the agency was sending a team to investi­gate. The five-member team was expected to arrive in nearby Port Arthur late Wednesday. 
A small fire continued to burn 18 hours after the 160­foot "North Umberland" apparently hit the 16-inch natural gas pipeline, trigger­ing a spectacular blaze that sent flames hundreds of feet into the air, LaHochelle said. 
The main fire burned itself out Wednesday morning after the pipeline was turned off.

The existence of "gender scripts," stereotypes taught to males and females at an early age, cause conflict between the sexes. "In teaching men and women, we teach men to be men, and women to be women, and we do that pretty power­fully." 
Burkhart said that boys learn at an early age that it is impor­tant for them to be strong and in control while girls are taught to be nice and obedient. 
"The 'us' and 'them' attitude gets amplified. There is more and more separation between the boys and the girls," said Burkhart. "It becomes increas­ingly difficult for adolescents to deal with their sexuality vis­a-vie the other sex." 
Burkhart explained that as children advance through pu­berty and into adolescence, these "gender scripts" evolve into "sexual scripts." 
"There is a development of an adolescent sub-culture where it is learned how to be male and female. They learn how they are to communicate about sex. Men learn how to get sex. Women learn how not to get sex," said Burkhart. 
The sexual script of 'come­ones' and 'put-offs' raises the question of communication be­tween males and females, Burkhart continued. 
"There is a very powerful de­mand on women to be nice, but part of being nice is not being direct and clear. And so women make it difficult to keep signals clear," Burkhart explained. 
"And there is an additional element that occurs in this cul­ture. It is called sexism, a negative emotion felt by men towards women," said Burkhart. "Sexism causes an acting out of anger, many times in the form of rape." 
Burkhart believes a solution to the problem of acquaintance rape exists in the ability of men and women to compromise their well-learned "gender scripts". 
"Women have to learn to be powerful, to be clear. If this happens, there won't be any more rapes,'" concluded Burkhart. 

Associated Press 
TAIF, Saudi Arabia-Heckled by Iran, Lebanese legislators met on Wednesday and debated scrapping a 46-year-old pact that divides government jobs along sectarian lines. 
They agreed earlier to revamp Parliament with an equal number of Moslems and Chris­tians in an effort to end the 14­year-old civil war. 
Any agreement, however, must win the support of power­ful warlords who have con­trolled much of Lebanon since fighting began in 1975. Moslem militia leaders Nabih Berri and Walid Jumblatt reportedly gave negative assessments of the Taif efforts on Wednesday. 
Militia leaders have been kept away from the meeting. 
The conflict is a battleground for conflicting Arab interests as well as for Lebanese fac­tions. The war has killed at least 150,000 people and turned much of the capital, Beirut, into rubble. 
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani warned the legisla­tors Wednesday not to surren­der to domination by Maronite Catholics.

in August 1992, regulators may have seized as many as 300 more dead S&Ls, bringing the total to nearly 600, he said. Those projections "raise questions about the adequacy of the $50 billion in RTC funding." 
However, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who heads an administration board overseeing the RTC's performance, said, "I know of nothing that's occurred since the bill passed to change my mind" that $50 billion likely is sufficient. 
That "isn't the point. Maybe we need 52, maybe we need 48. 1 The point is we've taken a bonfire and tamped it down to the point where it's embers," Brady said. 
Seidman, answering questions from senators, softened his tone a bit, emphasizing the impossibility of making a certain loss estimate. Nevertheless, he said, "there's no way we can say for sure that $50 billion is enough." 
On a related matter, he said the RTC may have to borrow $25 billion or more, in addition to the $50 billion, to provide working cash until it can recover money by selling loans and real estate once owned by failed S&Ls. 
Congress authorized the extra borrowing, but Sen. Donald Hiegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the banking committee, said $25 billion was far more than envisioned. 
So far, the RTC has run through $20 billion: $1.8 billion to close 24 small S&Ls, $8.3 billion to handle five large institutions by next week and five smaller not-yet-completed deals, $8.5 billion to replace high-cost deposits and $1.4 billion as a reserve fund to handle liquidity problems at thrifts that have failed but are still open, Seidman said. 


Judge dismisses California suit, failed to prove sex discrimination 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed the core of the nation's largest "comparable worth" lawsuit, a claim that California deliberately underpaid thousands of women in female-dominated state jobs. 
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ruled that the California State Employees' Association had failed to prove deliberate sex submit new arguments on a claim that state policies had the effect of illegally holding down the salaries of female state employees. But that type of· lawsuit, without proof of intent, has been made much more difficult to prove by a recent Supreme Court ruling.

Who is responsible? Everyone who uses drugs. Everyone who sells drugs. Everyone who looks the other way. 
Some people used to call drugs just a benign form of recreation. They're not. Drugs are a real and extremely serious threat to our schools, our homes, our friends and our families. It doesn't matter where you live or what school you attend. No one is free from the threat of drugs. Inner cities, small towns and college campuses all are un­der siege -because America is under siege. 
On September 5, I announced the first comprehensive national strategy to end the siege -to fight drugs with tougher laws and enforcement, and with im­proved treatment, education and pre­vention. The programs we've proposed are an all-out assault against the evil of drug usc and drug trafficking. We are aggressively attacking the problem from every angle and proposing a 1990 drug-budget totaling over eight billion dollars -the largest single increase in history. ­
America is fighting a war against drugs. Yet the most important weapons in the war on drugs are the least tangi­ble: self-discipline, courage, character, support from one's family, faith in God and in one's self. 
Fundamentally, the drug problem in America is not one of supply but of de­mand. We are taking strong new action to stop the flow of drugs into this coun­try and to stop the dealers themselves; but as long as Americans are willing to buy illegal drugs, somebody, somewhere in the world will sell them. 
Recently, I met with Mrs. Everett Hatcher, the widow of a veteran DEA agent who was killed by drug-using cowards. A woman of considerable dig­nity, she put responsibility for her bus­

-Weed \1"

band's death squarely on "casual" users of cocaine. She's right -and there is now blood on their hands. Similarly . President Barco of Colombia recently made an appeal to Americans to stop buying the cocaine causing the slaugh­ter of innocent civilians in the drug wars there. 
Every student in America at some point-at a party, in a locker room, in a dorm room -every student must choose to accept or reject drugs. But there is another choice that college stu­dents, as responsible adults, must make -whether to get involved in a personal way to end drug use or to look the other way. 
College campuses have long been cen­ters of conscience and idealism in this country, places where students have raised their voices to protest oppres­sion, injustice and human suffering around the world. Yet, no one would deny that often drugs go hand in hand with injustice, suffering and even death. But where is the sound of protest? In­nocent bystanders are killed at random on city streets. Babies are born ad­dicted to crack and heroin. Young chil­dren are forced into the drug trade by addicts. What greater human rights vi­olations exist? What greater injustices? Yet, recreational drug users still on some college campuses are ambivalent to the death and destruction they are financing. 
We must appeal to the social con­science of every college student on every college campus in America. The way to protest the misery and oppression brought about by drugs is to commit yourself to staying away from drugs ­and working to keep them away from your friends. 
Drug use doesn't" usually begin the way most people would think, with young people getting their first drugs from an addict or a dealer. Instead, they get them free from "friends" who think casual drug use hurts no one. Peer pressure is what spreads drug use and peer pressure can help stop it. 
You can help stop it -if you get in­volved.

accent writer 
he thought it would last 
forever when he told her, 
"I do." Even after three 
years of waiting and rais­ing a son by herself, she never doubted that he would come back to her. He did-with an­other wife. Such is the sad story the Minnesota Opera will present in their sold-out perfor­mance of Giacomo Puccini's op­era. Madame Butterfly at 8 p.m Friday in O'Laughlin Auditori­um. 
The performance is filled with some of the most rich, melo­dramatic music in opera ­Glenn Close played the aria in the film Fatal Attraction ­played by a full orchestra, and sung in English. Madame But­terfly tells the tragic story of a young Japanese geisha, Cio-cio­san, and her ill-fated marriage to the dashing yet unfaithful American Navy man, Lieuten­ant Pinkerton. 
Act I opens with Goro, a mar­riage broker, showing Pinker­ton around the house he is to inhabit during his stay in Ja­pan. The American consul, Sharpless, arrives, and Pinker­ton tells him of Cio-cio-san, the beautiful. fragile Japanese girl he has fallen in love with and plans to marry. Although this marriage is only a fling to Pin­kerton, Cio-cio-san who is affec­tionately named Butterfly is deeply in love, so much so that she has renounced her family and faith to become Christian and marry Pinkerton. 
After a few brief months of wedded bliss, Pinkerton returns to the United States, promising Butterfly that he will return "when the robins nest again." For three years, the faithful Butterfly waits for her husband and raises Trouble, their son. Then comes that fateful day when an American ship arrives in the harbor bringing her be­loved husband -and his new American wife. 
The story ends with Cio-cio­san, disgraced and alone, giving up her son to be raised by Pin­kerton and his wife in America. As the orchestra plays the final aria, Butterfly unsheathes her 

Lieutenant Pinkerton greets his geisha wife. Madame Butterfly plays this Friday in O'Laughlin Audi­torium.

father's dagger which bears the inscription, "To die with honor when one can no longer live with honor." 
The Minnesota Opera's pro­duction of Madame Butterfly, part of their nine-and-a-half­week tour of the Midwest and Canada, will be directed by D. Scott Glasser who is making his Minnesota Opera debut with musical direction by Michael Fardink. Friday night's per­formance will also feature some of the country's finest young professional singers. Alternat­ing each performance in the role of Cio-cio-san are sopranos Jane Olian who has previously played the role with the New Orleans Opera and Texas Opera Theatre and Mary Laymon who has recently appeared with the National Touring Company in productions of Don Pasquale, Cinderella, and The Marriage of Figaro. Tenor Tom Schumacher who has performed in Minneso­ta Opera productions of The Ju­niper Tree,Salome, and The Mi­kado sings the role of Pinkerton.

The Nintendo craze is sweep­ing the campus, and my section

is no different. But we take it to a bit of an extreme. A few weeks ago, the guys in my sec­tion got together and held dou­ble elimination playoffs in Nin­tendo Tecmo Football. That's probably not so strange, but the final "Tecmo Bowl" was getting a little out of hand. 
Signs announced the kickoff time as the pre-bowl hype grew to a fever pitch. Chicago was favored by 13 and a half points, but some fans still hoped for an upset. Before the game, we all stood and sang the national an­them, and at kickoff we circled our fingers in the air and did the "Ohhhhhhhh" cheer until the ball was kicked. On crucial 
third-and­c:===:;:==:~~.;;~v.~·;;;.Ad::c.;;;i:r-r---IJJF~~~ mor is. Please 
longs, we took feel free to out our keys groan where 
and jingled them in the air. During a few slow mo­ments in the game, the wave even cir­cled the room. (Chicago did go on to win the game and beat the spread--it's hard to find a close Tecmo Bowl these days.) 
Nintendo Football pales before "Fish Pun Night," though. Be­fore I begin, let me explain that I've never really liked puns. It's not just that they are the lowest form of humor; I consider them to be a henious crime against humanity. So if you read on, do so at your own risk. 
The following is a dramatic re-enactment of what "Fish Pun Night" was like. Unfortunately, appropriate. (And believe me, it's appro­priate.) 

Ian: Mum­ble, mumble, mumble. 
Alex: What was that? I'm having trouble herring you. 
Phil: Her­ring? Sounds a little fishy to me. 
please, will you 
Alex: Oh, 

no one realized at the time that history was being made, so there is no written record of ex­actly who said what. This sam­ple is merely intended to re­create the flavor of the original. 
Names have been left the same to embarrass my roommates and make them realize just how dreadfully bad their hu­just clam up? 
Phil: Hey, I'll talk when I want, and you'll like it, you shrimp. 

Ian (gradu­ally getting in to the spirit): I'm trying to get some work 
done. Will you two cut the carp and be quiet? 
(Long pause as everyone mentally reloads, trying to think of new, and even worse, fish puns.) 
Alex: All right, I'm sorry I started this thing. I didn't mean to; that is, I didn't do it on por­poise. 
Phil: You were really floun­dering for that one, weren't you? 
(Another long pause as all assembled realize that there are no good puns involving the word "lobster.") 
Ian: Well, I can't think of any more. I hope "Fish Pun Night" has come to an end. At least, I guess it's fin-ished. 
Phil: It's over? Oh, thank cod. 
So now you now what it was like. Perhaps the worst set of seafood puns mankind has ever seen. I was willing to blame my section for being the weird ex­ception until a friend told me that last year some guys at his dorm held a "Wayne Newton ­Music Marathon" where his songs were played continuously for days on end. 
Why do students act in such bizarre fashions, you ask? Is there some method to the mad­ness? No, I guess not. We do it ... just for the halibut. (Sorry, but you must have seen that one coming.)

The Notre Dame women's soccer team, now 6-6, crept past the Pumas of St. Joseph Rensselear Wednesday in overtime 2-1. 
The Pumas drew first blood at 71:40 of the second half on a goal by Debbi Sears, but the Irish fought back.

8:55 left in regulation play when Sisolak booted a penalty kick at St. Joseph's keeper Dee Sloan, but Sloan squelched any hopes of a quick Irish victory. 
"We had the ball in their territory," Irish head coach Dennis Grace said. " Their goalie deserves a lot of credit, but we missed some goals we should have had. We just whiffed some right in front of the net. 
"I thought we created more scoring opportunities than we have all year, they just didn't go in." 
Notre Dame was deprived a goal in the first overtime period, as senior midfielder 
K.T. Sullivan fired the ball into the right corner of the goal as the whistle sounded.

Mohan helps ND men's golf team take second at Glenn Oaks Invite 


By PETE CASTELLI 
Sports Writer 
It was a somewhat disap­pointing turnout for the men's golf team at the Glenn Oak s Invitational this past weekend. 
The Irish went to the tour­nament with high hopes, but things did not turn out just as they planned. The Irish finished second out of four teams. These teams included Lancing, Glenn Oaks, and Tri State, which finished first. 
Second-year Irish head coach George Thomas justified the turnout as, "Just a warm-up, the whole fall season is just a warm-up for the spring sea­son. We experimented with putting players in different po­sitions so that we could find out who our best players are," 
The Irish finished with a 302 and were led by fifth-year se­nior and medalist winner Pat Mohan, who shot a 7. Freshman Joe Dennen shot a 75 while Paul Nolta and Mike O'Connell shot 76 and 79 re­spectively. Freshman David Rignier, who played individu­ally, finished fifth with a 76.

public golf course that is, at best, average and left a lot to be desired," Thomas said. "Moreover, it was a short and tight course that forced our players to use their irons off the tee." 
The Irish fought mother na­ture as well as their games this weekend with high winds and drizzling rains throughout the day. However, Thomas does not attribute the weather to the team's play. 
"It was windy and did drizzle throughout the day but, the weather was the same for every golfer out on the course. We cannot blame the unpredictabil­
ity of the weather for our play," he said. The Tri State team was noth­ing to sneeze at either. 
"Thfly are ranked 13th in the nation for small colleges and proved to be a very well­rounded team. They got a lot of very good recruits this year," Thomas said. 
The Irish are now setting their sights on the MCC tour­nament. Notre Dame won the tournament last year. 
When asked for a prediction for this year's turnout, Thomas said, "No doubt, we're going to win it again. This is one of the bigger tournaments of the year and the boys are ready." 
Thomas disclosed the line-up as Pat Mohan, Joe Dennen, Paul Nolta, Mike O'Connell and Dave Rignier. 
"The competition will be there," Thomas said. "We will be facing such powerhouses as Butler University, University of Dayton, University of Detroit, Xavier University, Loyola, and Marquette. 
This spring we will prove to be the most intense golf team that this university has ever seen."

Clark, facing the team that has given him the most trouble throughout his career, hit an HBI double during a three-run first inning and a solo home run in third. With the bases loaded and two outs in the fourth, Cubs manager Don Zimmer went to the mound to talk to Maddux and Clark hit the next pitch out of the park. 
Clark, a .407 hitter with run­ners in scoring position this season, tied the NL playoff mark for hits. He hit .360 for the Giants in the 1987 playoffs, a seven-game loss to St. Louis.

Maddux had not pitched in eight days since winning the Cubs' division clincher. He wasn't sharp early and neither was Chicago. 
Brett Butler led off with a single, moved to second on a sacrifice and took third on a passed ball that rookie catcher Hick Wrona should have easily caught. Clark doubled beyond center fielder Jerome Walton's dive, Mitchell singled up the middle and Matt Williams dou­bled past Andre Dawson in right. 
In the fourth, Pat Sheridan and Jose Uribe led off with sin­gles and Butler was intention­ally walked to load the bases with one out. Hobby Thompson popped up before Clark sent the drive to right that left no doubt. 
The Cubs had their chances. After scoring twice in the first, they wasted Luis Salazar's leadoff triple in the second. After Sandberg homered in the third, they left two runners on base when Salazar popped out.

Secretariat dies at 19 
Associated Press 
PARIS. Ky. -Secretariat, whose 1973 Triple Crown tri­umph stamped him as the "people's horse," was humanely destroyed on Wednesday. lie was 19 -getting on for a horse but awfully young for such a great guy. 
"Maybe he was not the world's greatest racehorse," his owner, Helen Chencry, said, "but he was a charismatic per­son. 
000 
"The dream is over." 
Secretariat's 31-length vic­tory in the Belmont Stakes gave the sport its first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. In a year of turmoil -including Watergate and Vietnam -it also gave the country a hero, and Americans latched on as though he were human. 
"Secretariat was like the Arnold Palmer or Sugar Ray Leonard of horse racing," John Sosby, manager at Claiborne Farm, once said. "He's a peo­ple's horse." 
Ron Turcotte rode Secretariat in 1973. No other could compare, he said. 
"Secretariat was head and shoulders above any one of them," he said. "I didn't ride Buckpasser or Dr. Fager, but I rode against them, and on their 
00.
best days I never saw no Secretariat. He was the best." 
Gus Koch, assistant manager at Claiborne, said Secretariat had an incurable condition known as Laminitis, an in­flammation inside the hoof. He was put down by injection at 
11:45 a.m. EDT at Claiborne Farm, where he stood at stud, Koch said. 
"Of course. I'm terribly sorry to lose an old friend," Chenery said. "As long as he was alive, his memories had more imme­diacy." 
Koch said Secretariat's con­dition "rapidly worsened" on Tuesday, putting the chestnut stallion in "extreme pain for the first time." 
"Nobody wanted the horse to suffer and that's commend­able," Koch said. "Secretariat had a lot of class and he knew it. It's a thrill to work around a horse like that. He knew who he was and what he was all about." 
Secretariat was buried in a 6­foot by 6-foot dressed oak cas­ket lined with orange silk, the color used by Claiborne's racing stables. He was buried near his sire, Bold Ruler, in a small graveyard behind the office at the farm. 
The brass nameplate on Secretariat's stall door will re­main there. 
"Secretariat was a lot differ­ent than other horses," Koch said. "He was a very special horse to all of us. He was ad­mired by all in the horse world and fans all over the country. 
"We didn't think this day would come for a long time." 
Koch said Walter Kaufman, resident veterinarian at the farm, put the animal to sleep. The condition was diagnosed on Labor Day, Koch said. 
"When the inflamation oc­curs, swelling results," Koch said. "And since there is little room for swelling, this is a very painful condition." 
Not only did Secretariat win the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes in record time, but he probably also would have set a record in the Preakness if the timing process hadn't malfunctioned. 
Secretariat won 16 of 21 races in two years, but most fans remember the Belmont best. Already a winner in the Derby and Preakness, Secretariat barreled down the homestretch at Belmont Park, and, amazingly, he was alone. It was 31 lengths back to Twice a Prince. Using the customary racing equivalent of one-fifth of a second per length, Secretariat was under the wire for 6 1-5 seconds before Twice a Prince came along. 
Not since Citation won the Triple Crown in 1948 had any horse managed to win all three races, let alone in the style of Secretariat. 
Some still consider Man o' War the greatest horse of all time. It's the old Joe Louis­Muhammad Ali argument.

When the NHL opens its 73rd season with nine games Thursday night, Wayne Gretzky won't be the only one shooting for a milestone. 
While Gretzky's pursuit of Gordie Howe's all-time scoring record may overshadow other individual achievements, several other players also have their eyes on new levels. 
Three players have a chance this season to reach the career 1 ,000-point mark and another player has a shot at the 500­goal level. 
Quebec's Peter Stastny is closest to 1,000 points, needing just 14 to join the exclusive club. Edmonton's Jari Kurri is 50 points away and Chicago's Denis Savard 67. 
Bryan Trottier of the New York Islanders figures to join the 500-goal club this season. He needs just 13 to make it. 
Trottier also needs 32 assists to move past Phil Esposito 
(873) into fifth place on the all­time assist list. 
Four players are gunning for milestones in the assist category. 
Larry Robinson of the Los Angeles Kings is closing in on 700, and Pittsburgh's Paul Coffey, Montreal's Bobby Smith and Boston's Ray Bourque are nearing 600. 
Robinson needs 14 assists to reach his milestone, Coffey needs five, Smith 10 and Bourque 56. 
Meanwhile, Gretzky will continue his pursuit of Howe's scoring record of 1,850 points when the Los Angeles Kings play host to the Toronto Maple Leafs in one of Thursday night's openers. The Kings center needs just 14 to surpass the Detroit Red Wings' great. Howe made his point total in 26 seasons, Gretzky will break it in 11. 
Guy Lafleur, now with Quebec, has a legitimate chance to move up three spots to No. 7 on the all-time goal-scoring list. Lafleur, the Hall of Farner who came out of retirement to play for the New York Rangers

last season, currently is ranked No. 10 on the all-time list with 536 goals. 
After scoring 18 goals last season, he realistically has a shot to move past Stan Mikita (541), Maurice Richard (544) and John Bucyk (556). 
Under Michel Bergeron, who was also his coach with the Rangers, Lafleur is likely to receive ample ice time. He was recently placed on the right side of a line centered by Peter Stastny, the Nordiques' top offensive player. 
"I think it will work out well," said Lafleur, preparing for the Nordiques opener at Buffalo. "I came here and I want to stay here. I'm tired of moving." 
The 38-year-old Lafleur, who scored most of his goals with the Montreal Canadiens, has said he wants to play at least two more seasons in the NHL.

The hottest rumor on campus yesterday concerned the fact that ABC had dropped this weekend's game against Stanford in favor of the Washington-USC contest. 
Rest assured, Irish faithful. Yesterday, WNDU-TV announced on their evening telecast that their rivals at WSJV-TV (channel 28) have, in fact, made arrangements to pilot the Irish across the airwaves and into living rooms throughout South Bend. The kickoff will be at 3:00, so don't make any plans for Saturday afternoon. 
Yet another rumor has Lou Holtz taking over Don Shula's job as head coach of the Miami Dolphins after Shula's contract runs out next year. Alas, this, too, is the result of imaginations running wild. 
"I've been to Sea Worldoo.other than that, I won't justify that rumor with any other comment," snaps Holtz, making it clear that Miami is the farthest thing from his mind. 
I'm not sure if Holtz realizes that Shamu doesn't spend too much time swimming around in Joe Robbie Stadium, but don't look for Holtz to be on the sidelines when Dan Marino throws his first touchdown pass next year.

In that 18-17 loss, Washington State probably doomed any chances of a sur­prise Rose Bowl season, but the Cougars have shown they could be a force for years to come. 
The coach (Dennis Erickson) and quarterback !Timm Hosenbach) from the Washington State team that upset UCLA and won the Aloha Bowl last year both left the uni­versity during the offseason. 
Nonetheless, new coach Tim Price has overcome an injury to starting quarterback Brad 
Gossen  and  has  produced  a  
winner  at  Washi ngton  State.

Is Tennessee for real? 
The sixth-ranked Volunteers answered that question in the aflirmative last weekend with a 
21-14 victory over Auburn 
where tailback Reggie Cobb 
rolled over the normally stingy 
Tiger defense. 
Though the Vols now have a 
10-game winning streak dating 
to last year, it's still too early 
to plan on hearing repeated 
choruses of "Hocky Top 
Tennessee" in the New Orleans 
Superdome (a Ia Tennessee's 
35-7 Sugar Bowl rampage over 
Miami in 1986). 
Tennessee is set to embark on 
a feast-or-famine set of three 
games against Southeastern 
Conference opponents. Before 
trawling to Alabama and LSU, 
the Vols host Georgia. 
The Bulldogs do not appear to be as tough as usual undPr first-year coach Hay ColT. but Hodney Hampton is continuing the srhool's tradition of great tailbacks. 
If Goff is anything like his predecessor, Tennessee could be in for troubl1~. Georgia is coming ofT a loss to South Carolina, and under former coach Vince Dooley, the Bulldogs would never lose two games in a row. 


"They stress greatly to get the ball off quickly and I was just trying to hurry myself. I have not done what I am capable of doing. Before every kick I try to visualize the perfect kick." 
And the perfect kick is exactly what he will aequin~ if he keeps his current work ethic. During the summer, llentrich ventured 
to a nearby junior high school to work on his kicking. 
"I think the reason for my success so early is practice." said llnntrieh. "I knew whPn I came here I had to perform to the best of my ability in ordnr to play. I practiced three and four times a wenk. 
What has impressed the soft­spoken 18-year old about Notre Dame the most'? 
"The thing I like tlw most 
about Notre Damn football  is  
the fact that I got a chann~  to  
show my abilities."

Irish men's soccer prepares to head west for two games 
By CHARLIE POLLARD 
Sports Writer 
One might assume that the 
Irish soccer team would be a 
discouraged bunch as the play­
ers head to California for this 
weekend's competitive Santa 
Clara Metropolitan Life Classic. 
On the heels of a 1-2-1 
homestand, such an assump­
tion seems to have merit. 
Nevertheless. the soccer 
team's disposition is generally 
positive and optimistic. 
Of the homestand, only the 3­1 overtime loss to Wisconsin yielded truly negative results. Coach Dennis Grace evaluated the 4-1 win over Michigan St., the 2-2 tie with Marquette, and the 3-1 loss to Indiana as all positive performances. 
Thus Grace's team is pre­pared and excited to move on, especially after a week of good practices. 
Yes, the Irish are headed to California. The timing of the trip could not be better. This is the first "plane ride trip" for the team. Such a trip offers a chance for the Irish to spend valuable time together while alone as a team. 
Coach Grace sees this chance as a key for his team to find out about themselves. 

Mitch Kern 

"The timing (of this trip) is good to aid our total chem­istry," Grace said. 
Sophomore midfielder Mitch Kern echoes similar thoughts. "We've had some pretty hum­bling experiences at home," claimed Kern, "thus going all the way out to California can hopefully bring us together and bond us." 
In order to prevent further "humbling experiences" this weekend, the Irish need to dis­play a combination of cohesive teamwork and strong play. 
Friday's opponent, Cal State­Los Angeles, has a 5-4-2 record. They play a tough schedule and will definitely come ready to play. Golden 

San Francisco's Kevin Mitchell saw a lot of home plate at Wrigley Field Wednesday night, as he and Will Clark helped the Giants drub the Cubs 11-3 in the opening game of the National League playoffs.

Mitchell, Clark lead San Francisco's offensive assault 

Eagle's senior Mike Gregorian is especially dangerous. He leads his team in scoring with seven goals, including five in the last three games. 
Santa Clara, the host team, should pose even stiffer compe­tition for the Irish on Sunday. They are currently ranked fourth in the nation by Soccer America's latest poll. Their record is 8-0-1, with the only blemish a 1-1 tie with third ranked UCLA. 
With ample proof, Coach Grace calls this one of the premier classics in the country, as well as a stern challenge for his squad. 
An interesting aspect to the classic is the homecoming of Sophomore Mitch Kern and Freshman Jeff Rhodes. 
Both Irish players went to Bellarmine High School in Santa Clara, just minutes from Santa Clara University. Both players also live a short dis­tance from the school. Furthermore, each considered attending Santa Clara. 
"I played with over half of their players," said Rhodes, "and they are truly an amazing team. I'm looking forward to the game."

CIIICAGO -Once they turned on the lights at Wrigley Field, Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell turned them out on the Chicago Cubs. 
Clark set a record by driving in six runs as he went 4-for-4 with two home runs. including a grand slam. and Mitchell hit a three-run shot as the San Francisco Giants routed Chicago 11-3 Wednesday night in the opening game of the National League playoffs. 
Neither Clark nor Mitchell like to hit at Wrigley field, one of the best hitters' park in the majors. But no one would know it after watching the league's most feared sluggers. 
"I think the night game was a factor. I saw the ball better. I didn't see it well during the day," Clark said. "I've had my problems, but this is the first time I've ever played with the wind blowing out. 
"It was just one of those games," he said. "That doesn't mean I've got this ballpark or this pitching staff in my pocket." 
Pitching may dominate play­offs. but not this time. Clark's slam in the fourth inning off 19-game winner Greg Maddux landed on Sheffield Avenue past right field and made it 8-3. By then, thf)re already had been four home runs and 13 hits. 
Clark's grand slam came one pitch after Cubs manager Don Zimmer visited Maddux on the mound. 
"I was going to leave him in," Zimmer said. "I just wanted to make sure we were together on how to pitch him, so I asked him. I got the answer I wanted, just not the result. 
"He had a hell of a week," Zimmer said in assessing Clark's performance. 
Mitchell added the finishing touches in the eighth, homering onto Waveland Avenue beyond left field after Clark had walked. 
"It felt good, especially at this park," said Mitchell, who led the majors with 47 home runs and 125 RBis. "I hadn't hit one here since 1987." 
Clark, who batted .333 and had 23 home runs and 111 RBis, set a playoff record for RBis and tied the all-time post­season record set by Bobby Richardson for the New York Yankees in the 1960 World Series. Clark hit his only big­league grand slam this season, against Mike Maddux, Greg's brother. 
Scott Garrelts, the league's earned run average champion, struggled early yet lasted seven innings for the victory.

The Observer I Brian Schwartz Freshman Kevin Pendergast has helped the Notre Dame men's soccer team amass a 5-4-1 record. Pendergast and the Irish will try to improve upon that record Friday and Sunday as they play two games on the west coast in Santa Clara, Calif. 
Holtz urges Culver to hold onto the football 
Turnovers have perplexed the Fighting Irish faithful in the 
past few weeks, and some of the attention has focused on 
running back Rodney Culver. Culver has turned the ball over 
twice on fumbles in the past two games, causing Lou lloltz 
to wax philosophical and quote Ohio State legend Woody 
Hayes. 

"Woody once said 'Fumbling is an act of God, that is, it's an act of a God darn fool.' But I think that fumbling is be­cause of a lack of fundamentals. I have great confidence in Rodney Culver, he's an outstanding football player. lie's an outstanding blocker, he's intelligent, and he's everything you want in a Notre Dame football player. 
KenTysiac 
Sports Writer 

"But I have to be honest with you. If we had other options, we'd take them. Rodney's going to have to play, and he's going to make a contribution." 
With the loss of Braxston Banks and Tony Brooks, the once deep and experienced Irish backfield has become de­pendent on Culver, who hadn't seen much playing time until this year. Culver has run well this season, gaining 110 yards on 22 carries for an average of 5.0 yards per carry. 
But Holtz hopes Culver can cure his ailing butterfingers . "The fundamentals of ball-carrying are very unnatural, and all you can do is keep working (on them). I have great confi­dence in Rodney Culver." 
First-year Stanford coach Denny Green has also had problems at running back. Four out of his top live ball car­riers will sit out this game, the most notable being preseason All-America candidate Jon Volpe, who gained 67 yards on 17 carries last year against the Irish and will rest his sprained left knee on the sideline. 
As a result, sophomores Gary Taylor and Todd Burton will start in the offensive backfield for the Cardinal, who will likely throw the ball early and often. They average 42 pass attempts per game coming in, and let's face it, they probably have no choice but to air it out with all of those backs nurs­ing injuries. 
You might think that the end zone is a totally foreign con­cept to defensive tackle Jeff Aim, who scored his first colle­giate touchdown last weekend on a 16-yard interception re­turn against Purdue. But Aim has crossed the goal line be­fore with the ball in his grasp. 

"I played tight end in high school, so I was supposed to score back then," says Aim, whose most recent touchdown previous to Saturday occurred in his junior year of high school.
