Tricia Wallace, Isabel Wagner, Anne Homan, Hedi Fuhr and Shelly Gagen won yesterday's Residence Hall Association {RHA) elections for president, vice president, treasurer and secretary and National Communications Coordinator, respectively. 
All candidates with the ex­ception of president ran unop­posed with approximately 21 percent of on-campus students voting, according to 1992-93 RHA President Karen Fordham. 
Wallace received 69.6 percent of the vote for president, Beth Goodwin 28 percent of the vote and 2.4 percent of those voting abstained.

The Commission for Security and Cooperation in Europe (C.S.C.E.) is an international governmental human rights or­ganization and a vital force in today's political arena accord­ing to Erika Schlager, U.S. del­egate to diplomatic democracy to C.S.C.E.. 
The C.S.C.E., also known as the Helsinki Process, is a cold war product created in 1954 to legitimize post war division in Europe, said Schlager. Its membership includes the countries most vulnerable to destabilization. 
In his lecture titled "The Helsinki Process and the Future of Human Rights in Europe" Schlager said, "It [C.S.C.E.] is organized as an ongoing process which provides the best potential framework." 
The C.S.C.E. took two 

with 8.1 percent of those voting abstaining. Homan received 93.1 percent of the vote for treasurer, with 
6.9 percent abstaining. 
Fuhr earned 91.1 percent of the vote for secretary, with 8.9 abstained. 
Gagen received 81.9 percent of the vote for National Com­munications Coordinator, with 
18.1 percent abstaining. 
The four candidates who won president, vice president, trea­surer and secretary cam­paigned together as a ticket. 
"We want to let people know about RHA and what it does," said Wallace. "The parietals changes are just one thing RHA can do. They have a lot of power, we just have to work with residents to let them know about RHA and what it can do."

decades to form a conference due to opposition by Western countries because the U. S. and the Federal Republic of Ger­many feared the commission would divide NATO and West­ern and Eastern Germany. Ironically, the C.S.C.E. has cre­ated unity rather than division, Schlager said. 
The founding of the confer­ence was also slowed down be­cause some western countries saw contradictions between the conference's concentration on security concerns and human rights. 
The first meeting was held in 197 5 in Helsinki, Finland and included 35 leaders from Eu­rope, North America and the Soviet Union. These leaders fo­cused on subjects ranging from military security, to the envi­ronment, to human rights, Schlager said. 
The Helsinki meeting was a rallying point for the oppressed of Europe and paved the way for the release of political pris­oners, free and fair elections, the unification of Germany and free flow of information across borders, according to Schlager. 
"The unification of Germany symbolized the unification of the entire continent," Schlager said. 
The C.S.C.E. met for a second time in 1990 to acknowledge pivotal events which they had catalyzed. Leaders recounted the relatively bloodless revolu­tions and lack of return to communist totalitarianism. 
It was a "welcoming of the new Europe and a rejecting of the old," Schlager said. 
A second purpose of the 1990 meeting was to recommend new regulations for the confer­ence. Due to evolving needs in post Cold War Europe, the 
C.S.C.E. added standing offices in Prague, Vienna, and Warsaw.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Look back at your past with an 
eye on your future 
"Where I was born and where and how I have lived is unimportant. It is what I have done with where I have been that should be of interest. "-Georgia O'Keeffe John Rock 
These words from Managing Editor Georgia ()'Keeffe may not seem all that relevant to ________ a generation that is just coming of age. The undergrads of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's aren't really all that far along that vivacious continuum of time between our births and imminent deaths often called "life." 
Ever gHt to wondering what it's all about? By the timtJ we graduate, most of us will have spent at least 20 percent of our lives in South Bend. Of the rHst, another 20 percent was spent dinking around during high school. The remaining 60 percent, we probably don't remembflr that much, unless some childhood memories are jarred free by Bill Rosemann in "Sucking the Marrow of Life." 
According to O'Keeffe, the standard by which she wished to measured was what she did with her life. That question faces us as what are we going to do with our lives. 
Many seniors have been slapped in the face by this question, but it's one we've asked many times before. How many of us wanted to be a firefighter back in the first grade? 
Reeoneiliation with the question of what we want to do with our lives is only partially made with the selection of an occupation. Who we are and who we are going to be are other big questions that confront us in college. Being at a Catholic eollege presents us with guidance, but also with problems in this formation of our personhood. 
The omnipresent "they" say that "you learn something new every day." I will not dispute that, but only conclude that our formation o personhood will never reach completion. 
Thfl meaning of life is not hidden in this column. It may or may not be found in the movie "City Slickers," when the cowboy holds a finger in the air while explaining the meaning o life to Billy Crystal. It may or may not be found in the tomes of philosophical discourse absorbed and chewed on daily. 
Kierkegaard suggests that "Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards." This sounds obvious enough, but in the normal course of human life, the only thing we learn from the past is that we don't learn from it. 
O'Keeffe may have undervalued the im­portance of the past on our lives, but is correct in asserting that the past is not what we should be judged for, or by. It is what we are doing now and what we plan to do in the future; hopefully using the things we have learned in the past 20 percent. Chances are good that most of what we apply is stuff we learned but not from a text or lecture, but from the experiences we encountered. 
As we journey together forward towards the day our last glimpse of the Dome is in the rear­view mirror, we should start this process o understanding life through looking backward and forwarding what we have learned to the future.

Socialists' cultural policies assailed 
PARIS -Graffiti on display at museums. State­subsidized rap music. Condoms dispensed at high schools. In his 12 years in office, Culture Minister Jack Lang has redefined French culture, flouting tradition and mixing high brow with low. He has financed fashion and haute cuisine, cinema and rock 'n' roll, symphony and the circus. French conservatives will be doing their best to undo his legacy after the legislative elections this month, which they seem assured of winning. Conservatives believe Lang has trivialized culture and pandered to the lowest common denominator. Plagued by numerous scandals and high unemployment, the Socialists' support has fallen to about 20 percent of the population, according to polls leading up to the March 21legislative elections.

UAW threatens to strike Kansas plant 
DETROIT -The United Auto Workers union has warned Ford Motor Co. it may go on strike at a plant in Kansas City that builds some of the automaker's best­selling trucks. The strike notice means that unless its grievances are settled by midnight Saturday, the union could call a walkout of the 4,000 workers. The strike threat is the first at a Ford plant since 1986, UAW spokesman Karl Mantyla said Tuesday. The plant builds the Ford Tempo-Mercury Topaz and F-series pickup trucks. The union said there are more than 80 grievances, chief among them Ford's plan to eliminate 55 jobs by sending seat-cushion work to an outside supplier. Ford spokesman Bert Serre said that issue is not basis for a legal strike. Separately, a strike by 2,100 workers at a Ford assembly plant in northern Mexico continued for a second day Tuesday in a dispute over wages. The workers earn about $2 an hour.

vacuum-packed bags of marijuana that began washing ashore last week. Since Feb. 23 authorities have found more than 140 pounds on the beach, and they seized 20 pounds more from a man who apparently got there first. "It's awfully hard telling where this came from," Police Chief Kevin Clayton said Tuesday. He said investigators aren't even sure in which direction the marijuana was heading -out of or toward Alaska. The state has a significant marijuana crop. Police in Cordova were tipped off to the illegal flotsam by a caller who said a man in town had come upon a large quantity of marijuana and was trying to sell it. The police chief put the street value of the marijuana at about $780,000. He said nearly all of the bags were still watertight. "I sure would like to know what kind of vacuum sealer they used. I could save myself a lot of fish with one of those," he said.

Professors named to fore\gn programs 
Special to The Observer 
Alain Toumayan, associate professor of romance languages and literatures at Notre Dame, has been named director of the University's Angers Program in France, and Cathleen Cowhey, a Saint Mary's alumna, has been named the new director of the University's Innsbruck Program, according to Isabel Charles, associate provost and director of International Study Programs. 
The appointments last two years beginning in the Fall 1993 semester. The Angers Program was founded in 1966 as part of the Centre International D'Etude Francaises (CIDEF) at the cam­pus of L'Universite Catholique de L'Ouest (CATHO). During the current academic year 31 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students are enrolled in the Angers Program. 
Toumayan received his un­dergraduate education at the University of Pennsylvania and his doctorate from Yale Univer­sity in 1982. He joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1989 following appointments at Johns Hopkins and Princeton Universities. 
A specialist in nineteenth and twentieth century French liter­atures, Toumayan has authored one book, "La Litterature at La Hantise du Mal," edited a volume of essays, and produced critical articles for journals such as The Romantic Review and Romance Quarterly. 
Also an effective teacher and lecturer, Toumayan will succeed Father Gerald Carroll of Longford, Ireland, who has di­rected the program since 1990. 
Cowhey is a former student in the Innsbruck Program who received a master's degree in theater and medieval history from Ludwig-Maximilians-Uni­versitat in Munich, where she is now completing doctoral studies. She also holds an ap­pointment as a visiting faculty member in Notre Dame's de­partment of German and Rus­sian languages and literatures.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility. 
Anti-American feelings are running high in Yugoslavia. Belgrade TV, controlled by hard-line Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, regularly denounces the United States for allegedly favoring Muslims over Serbs in the fighting in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegov­ina. 
In the past year, weapons of all types have become available in Belgrade, brought by soldiers returning from Bosnia and Croatia. Violent crime has soared and small explosions are a nightly occurrence. 
But this was the first time in recent memory the U.S. Em­bassy had been attacked. 
Serbs have also criticized the 
U.S. airdrop of relief supplies this week to Muslims in eastern Bosnia who have been besieged by Serb rebels.

coverage for married students. 
German Echecopar, head of the subcommittee, will propsoe a GSU approved referendum to University officials. "We're looking to find a better way for families to be insured," he said. 
GSU's plan involves lowering the cost of coverage as well as expanding coverage for spouses and children. Presently, health insurance coverage for spouses and chil­dren is too expensive for most graduate students, Echecopar said. 
While coverage for a single student is $300, covering a family is much more expensive, according to Echecopar. 
"Three years ago a family of four was insured with $1,392," he said. "Last year it was ex­actly $3000." The average graduate student stipend is $8000. 
The referendum has under­gone changes. The original plan was to increase health in­surance premiums for all graduate students. Projected increase of the premium is between $50 and $200. 
Echecopar said that this plan was changed for two reasons. He cited first the potential fric­tion between married and un­married students. The other problem is that if students themselves subsidize insurance coverage, the University might perceive itself as having no re­sponsibility in the matter. 
"Many people feel the uni­versity should address this is­sue, not the students," said Echecopar. "We think it should be the University who takes care of it."

Despite the success of the C.S.C.E., it has faced obstacles in negotiation processes due to the post Cold War breakdown of traditional alliances. An in­formal network evolved, yet this was not enough, Schlager said. 
"The disintegration of the Warsaw Pact removed a critical point of definition for these countries," she said. It also gave "European Community and NATO countries less com­mon ground to stand on." 
This obstacle is compounded by the expanding membership of the C.S.C.E.. It has grown from 35 members to 53 be­cause of the recognition of Baltic states and the deunifica­tion of the Soviet Union. 
"The C.S.C.E. includes every country in Europe except Macedonia," Schlager elabo­rated.

Ferry accident in Congq; death toll may top 200 
BRAZZAV1LLE, Congo(AP)-­Dozens of victims who drowned in a rush to board a river ferry were buried in mass graves Wednesday. Unconfirmed reports said the death toll may top 200. most of them Zairians ordered expelled by Congo. 
Congo. which has set a Fri­day deadline for illegal immi­grants to leave the country, re­ported 147 people died in the Sunday accident. That would make it one of the world's deadliest river ferry disasters in years. 
But a diplomat who visited Brazzaville's main morgue quoted a police officer as saying there were at least 219 victims. Zairian human rights leader Jose Djomoni Demoti 
ROME (AP) -The latest highfliers implicated in a spreading scandal are Italy's cement king, a financier who challenged for the America's Cup, a top Fiat executive, and the brother of a former premier. And that is only in the past few weeks. 
With the Milan judges' inves­tigations sending tremors down the corridors of power, the government this week rushed to limit the damage before the scandals end "in a cemetery of closed factories and hungry people," in the words of Justice Minister Giovanni Conso. 
Conso has recommended that those who confess their guilt and give back the money be permitted to avoid jail or get reduced sentences. The country cannot endure years of drawn-put the deathtoll at 222. Congolese officials an­nounced late Tuesday they were opening an investigation. The death toll reports could not be verltied. · 
Victims of the accident were illegal Zairian immigr{l.riJs trying to take the ferry across the Congo River to Zaire's capital, Kinshasa, in advance of the Friday deadline. 
More.than 3,QOO .. Zairi{l.ns had crowded the port to board the 200-passenger ferry when a gangway ¢ollapsed ~rid scores of people fell into the river, p9lice said.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) ­Bosnia's Muslim-led govern­ment joined warring Serbs and Croats in accepting a future cease-fire and military with­drawal, taking an important step Wednesday toward peace in the war-torn land. 
The decision is the biggest breakthrough in the faltering Yugoslav peace talks since they moved to New York from Geneva last month. 
Bosnian Croats and Serbs signed the agreement in Jan­uary. It is part of an overall peace plan offered by mediators Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen to halt more than a year of ethnic fighting. 
But before the cease-fire and withdrawal can take place, the warring parties must agree to the other points of the peace plan: a proposed division of Bosnia into 10 provinces, and 

Italy's elite running from spreading scandal 
out investigations that cast doubt and suspicion on its industry and institutions, Conso said. 
Some see this as a whitewash. 
"The attempt to seek a politi­cal solution for the guilty would represent the latest outrage to the conscience and the exces­sive patience of the Italian peo­ple," said Umberto Bossi, leader of the upstart Northern League, the party expected to gain the most from the scandals. 
In a country accustomed to scandal, the size and scope of the current one has boggled the mind: Hundreds of millions of dollars kicked back to political parties in exchange for public works contracts, disaster relief stolen or squandered. Nearly 900 people arrested. 
Bosnian Muslims sign agreement 
Italians also have been daz­zled by the audacity of Milan judges relentlessly pursuing the country's political and economic elite. 
The judges have forced the resignations of two party lead­ers and three Cabinet ministers.

arrangements on an interim government and the country's constitutional principles. The three sides have been at odds over the proposed map. 
"This brings us one step closer to a political agreement on which a meaningful cease-fire and cessation of hostilities can be based. The missing piece, of course, is agreement on the map," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters. 
The agreement signed Wednesday calls for a cease­fire, control of heavy weapons, the rebuilding of infrastructure such as power plants and rail stations and the separation of forces and monitoring of bor­ders. 
Bosnian Foreign Minister Haris Silajdzic said his gov­ernment decided to sign the agreement after receiving as­surances that heavy weapons would be placed under U.N. control, one of the Muslim gov­ernment's main concerns. The Bosnian Muslims had feared Serbs would cheat on the agreement and retain their heavy fire power. 
After meeting with Vance and Owen for nearly four hours, Silajdzic announced his government had signed the pact because "considerable U.N. forces could be deployed in Bosnia for purposes of the agreement and to control heavy weapons." 
The 15-nation Security Council planned to meet later Wednesday to adopt a statement demanding "immediate action to protect the lives and well-being of the inhabitants of eastern Bosnia," where Serbs are attacking Mus­lims. 

Warring Afghan leaders agree to share power 
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP)­The leaders of Afghanistan's two main factions reportedly agreed Wednesday to share power in their shattered home­land for 18 months, then hold elections. 
Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his rival, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, met for the first time since the Communist governmet fell last April. 
Since then, they have battled for control of their homeland. In a struggle for the capital alone, rebel chiefs have rained thousands of rockets on Kabul, killing an estimated 5,000 peo­ple, wounding countless more and flattening entire neighbor­hoods. 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan called the chiefs of Afghanistan's factions to Is­lamabad on Monday to try to mediate an end to their bitter feuding. 
Pakistan delivered billions of dollars in military assistance ­much of it from the United States -to the groups when they were fighting the Soviet­backed government in Kabul. 
In announcing the power­sharing agreement, Sharif said "all sides have shown flexibil­ity" in the talks. 
Rabbani, who had been scheduled to return to Kabul on Wednesday, extended his visit another day in hopes the agreement can be signed by all factions before he leaves, said the president's spokesman, Mohammed Aziz Murad. 
Murad said that under the power-sharing agreement, Rabbani would remain as pres­ident and Hekmatyar would serve as prime minister. 
The agreement still must be ratified by leaders of all 10 Muslim groups that ousted the Communists after a 14-year civil war. 
Hekmatyar, who is believed to have influence over the smaller factions, was not immediately available for comment.

Gene for Lou Gehrig's disease is discovered 
NEW YOHK (AP} -Scientists 
have identified a gene that ap­
parently causes Lou Gehrig's 
disease, a breakthrough that 
suggests existing drugs might 
treat the illness. 
The finding also furthers the idea that scientists may one day be able to slow the rate of nor­mal aging, a federal health of­ficial said. 
"I think it's the biggest dis­covery so far" in research into Lou Gehrig's disease, said Lynn Klein, vice president of patient services for The ALS Associa­tion, which helped pay for the study. 
"We've been saying for a long time that there is light at the end of the tunnel. This is a big beacon." 
ALS stands for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which became known as Lou Gehrig's disease for the New York Yankees star who died of the illness in 1941. 
The progressively paralyzing disease affects an estimated 
30.000 Americans at any given time, according to the associa­tion. 
Faulty genes are blamed for only about 5 percent to 10 per­cent of cases. The cause of far more common sporadic cases is unknown. 
But the new discovery's im­plications also may apply to sporadic cases, since genetic and sporadic ALS produce identical symptoms and pro­gression. researchers said. 
The gene normally helps the body destroy toxic substances called free radicals. If it is de­fective, it may lead to an exces­sive buildup of free radicals that then damages tissue, re­searchers said. 
If that causes ALS, drugs that destroy free radicals may be

able to slow or halt the disor­der. researchers said. 
Such "antioxidant" drugs are already being tested for other diseases. 
"It raises the possibility that antioxidant therapies may be beneficial, but clearly more in­vestigation is going to be re­quired," said Dr. Robert Brown, senior author of the new report and associate professor of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. 
Some vitamins are antioxi­dants, but Brown said he would not advise them as an ALS treatment. 
"Nobody should do anything without talking to a physician," said Robert Horvitz, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute inves­tigator at the Massachusetts In­stitute of Technology in Boston and another senior author. 
It is not clear yet whether antioxident therapy would help and it might even do harm, he said. 
Dr. Stanley Appel, director of the Muscular Dystrophy Asso­ciation ALS Hesearch Center at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, called the work "an extremely interesting paper and hopefully very important."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Holocaust greater evil than abortion 
Dear Editor: 
In his article "Abortion Can­not Be Worse Than The Holo­caust" (The Observer, Feb. 26), Father Robert Griffin tried to address some very issues that have come out of the tensions produced by the abortion de­bate. While I appreciate the sincerity of his effort to find a way out of the terrible rancor this debate continues to engen­der. it seems to me that some response must be made. 
Father Griffin chides the Catholic bishop who compared abortion to the Nazi holocaust, but also apologizes for him: "He is right too, according to his own lights." But no defense should be offered for so heinous a comparison. 
Individual decisions to termi­nate pregnancies, which are often made by women in des­perate circumstances, have nothing in common with the organized slaughter of millions of full-grown adults and chil­dren. Whatever personal posi­tion we may take on the very personal issue of abortion, surely we must see this differ­ence. Not to would be a very dangerous self-delusion. 
This is just not the kind of principle which should even need spelling out: systematic genocide of whole populations is the most horrendous evil of which human beings are ca­pable, and any bishop who compares that horror to a pro­cess of very difficult personal choices made by individual parents, should not be a bishop. 
For that reason I have to criticize Father Griffin as well for comparing memories of Dachau and Buchenwald, with 
DOONESBURY 
their thousands of corpses, to his own memory of the embry­onic remains in the Whitman sampler box. I have no doubt that the suffering of the man and his wife after her miscar­riage were real, but their dis­tress is infinitesimal next to the agony of the Holocaust. 
But Father Griffin suggests that Jews resent the compari­son of such incommensurables just because they have a differ­ent view than "us Christians" and don't believe that an em­bryo is holy-and that is a con­descending insult and a serious distortion of reality. Being hor­rified at the abortion equals holocaust comparison should not require any peculiarly Jew­ish point of view. 
Every person with a con­science should protest, includ­ing atheists. And Father Griffin should apologize for implying that if Jews resent the compar­ison, that must be because they think embryonic life utterly in­consequential. That does not follow, and it was never the is­sue to begin with. 
At risk of diluting the main point here, I want to add a fur­ther suggestion: Christian and Jewish theologies regarding the unborn are probably not, in fact, far apart at all. Father Griffin mentions the Catholic fundamentalist argument that "the Spirit is prompt in confer­ring holiness and humanity" at the moment of conception. But the Spirit, the imago dei in ev­ery human being, is what we have in common, not what makes us unique persons. The image of God signifies the tran­scendence we share that makes us equal before God, but it does not by itself constitute a full individual human being. 
In the Judeo-Christian tradi­tion, a complete person must have a body for earthly exis­tence. That is precisely why Christianity puts so much em­phasis on the doctrine of bodily resurrection. Perhaps Platonic doctrine would sanction the notion of an afterlife of disem­bodied spirits, each of which could count as a person, but this runs counter to the whole weight of the Judea-Christian tradition. That is also the rea­son why Catholic tradition, in agreement with Judaism, does not regard an embryonic col­lection of cells as a proper can­didate for Christian burial, and hence has no liturgy for a mis­carriage. 
This argument does not imply, however, that nothing is wrong with abortion, or that there should be no sanctions against it. There may well be very good social, psychological and moral reasons for thinking that abortion is often reprehensible, just as there will be other considerations weighing against legal sanctions for abortion. 
But the theological concept of a person in the Judea-Christian tradition, I believe, really con­tributes nothing to this issue one way or the other. And there is real advantage in seeing this. It may allow us to move the debate out of the emotional field of religious faith and into a context in which there is potential for compromise and rational agreement on an issue that is tearing our society apart.

Gender Studies gives students alook at societal gender relations 
By MARY SCHULTZE 
Accent Writer 
.Jane Doe and her boyfriend often sit in Jane's room and argue about the status of women in society. While Jane contends that women are treated as secondary citizens, her boyfriend believes the feminist movement has achieved its goal of gender equality. 
Although Notre Dame became a co-educational institution 20 years ago, discussions about gender relations have been largely r.onfi1wd to late night talks with friends and roommates. 
This began to change, however, when women on the faculty from several disciplines decided they would like to have a concentration in gender studies. according to Ava Collins, Gender Studies Director. The original proposal was written by Professors Kathleen Wiegert and Joan Aldous. and with the pflrmission of the University, the Gender Studies program bngan four years ago when the program received a Lilly Grant to develop a curriculum. 
"Gender Studies introduces a discussion of gender in an academic atmosphere," said Collins. A multidisciplinary program, Gender Studies investigates what it means to be a woman or man today, feminism, and the ways in which ideas of gender shape how we live. The courses examine how the various social studies and humanities disciplines examine how gender roles have been defined throughout society. 
Currently, 37 students, of which three are male, concentrate in gender studies. These students take 15 credit hours of a foundations course, two core courses, one Gender Studies elective course, and three semesters of a one-credit Colloquium which focuses on contemporary developments in gender studies. 
Through courses in the social sciences and the humanities, students have the opportunity to explore the impact gender has on a variety of disciplines. 
Senior Alicia Reale decided to concentrate in gender studies because "its spans the different departments. You get a good grasp of gender issues in a variety of fields." 
Some of the Gender Studies courses this year include American Feminist Fiction, American Film: Images of Gender, Gender and Politics in the U.S., Marriage and Family, and Women in America. 
Although Gender Studies investigates women's issues, it does not intend to focus solely on women. "It is called Gender Studies for a reason which is that we don't want to 'ghettorize it.' It's hard to talk about women without talking about men," said Collins. Gender Studies attempts to combat heterosexism, or the tendency to think only in a male/female opposition. 
Yet in the· patriarchal environment of Notre Dame, the fact that Gender Studies does offer many courses dealing with women's issues is what attracts many concentrators. "Since women's issues are generally ignored, I assumed gender studies would focus on women's studies," said Reale. "I took a history course on women in America that paid attention to what women were doing in early American history when the usual textbooks only mention men's contributions." 
The strength of many Gender Studies courses is that they take a different approach and investigate the underlying gender relations and how it affects the understanding of history, literature, film, etc. 
One of the problems facing Gender Studies is attracting more students, particularly males, to its courses. "Because classes have their homes in major departments, hopefully more male students will become aware of these issues as an intellectual endeavor," said Collins. She also stressed that more women need to take up the course of studying and pursuing gender relations. 
As the university hires more women, the concentration will have the opportunity to grow as a concentration and eventually achieve its long­term goal of becoming a major, according to Collins. She would also like to see Gender Studies "take up a politicized role more actively." 
"The future of academic feminism is activism and activism begins in pedagogy," said Collins, quoting a recent essay on feminist studies. 
The Gender Studies program faces a variety of challenges as it aims to appeal to the student body, while remaining focused on an intellectual examination of gender relations. "It is an academic discipline," strssed Collins. "Hopefully students will become more aware of these issues as an intellectual endeavor." 
Currently Gender Studies emphasizes the academic importance of gender relations but this does not inhibit the possibility of extending the lessons outside the classroom. Collins believes that through the examination of gender relations in an academic environment, students can become aware of how they can impact both their intellectual and social life on campus. 

By BECKY BARNES 
Accent Writer 

Editor's note: This story is part ofa monthly Accent series commemorating the 20th anniversary ofcoeducation at Notre Dame. 
When Notre Dame decided to become a coeducational university, most male students gave more thought to the potential social opportunities than to the idea of having women in their classes. 
Many weren't quite sure how to react to this small group of intelligent women, and they didn't know quite what to expect. 
A Scholastic article written in February of 1972, the semester before the arrival of women, jokingly defined several different attitudes and scenarios regarding the enrollment of women. One of these, the "machismo syndrome," was described as a philosophy held by men in which "women are not the highest moral good, but rather the necessary biological apparatus in­suring the sexual sanity of men." 
If this attitude is carried into the classroom, the article continued, "the outgrowth of this male-dominant role is that professors would have to be instructed to deliberately grade women more harshly, though never informing them of this decision, for otherwise the ensuing traumas of the males, due to the destruction of their world view, would cause an epidemic of impotency. Or the administration could admit only less intelligent women.'' 
Of course, this didn't happen. 
In the fall of 1972, 365 women enrolled at Notre Dame, 125 freshman and 240 transfers, most from Saint Mary's. Chosen from an applicant pool of over 1,100, many of these first women had academic qualifications superior to the male students, which was reflected in their performance. At the end of the first semester, the overall GPA for women was 3.12 while the overall GPA of the University was 2.94. 
"Women were numerically the minority, but they stood out aca­demically," said Sr. Elena Malits, chair of the original committee on coeducation. 
This difference didn't make for good male/female relationships, she added. 
Kathy Coleman, a 1978 graduate, agreed that men and women competed in the classroom, which often Jed to social tension.

But he thought women might like something a little different, and found that a father-figure role worked

This year, women comprise 15.3 percent of professors in the undergraduate colleges, according to statistics on gender and ethnicity from Notre Dame Institutional Research. Of full professors, 4.4 percent are women. 
Seventy-four percent of women professors are in the College of Arts and Letters. and there are no tenured women in the College of Business. The College of Engineering has three female assistant professors. 
Some female 'I

Because they are so few in number, many female professors find themselves overburdened with counseling and advising female students, said Avallone. On an avereage, Professor Avallone usually talks to one or two women a day regarding gender issues . 
So where does all this leave women students today? 
Better off than they were 20 years ago, said Malits. But still with a ways to go. 
Women comprised 42.5 percent of the 1992-93 freshman class, a figure which reflects the applicant pool, said Pat Leonardo, associate director of admissions. 
The admissions office is currently focusing on a "gender blind" admissions policy, but Leonardo said that he cannot predict how the ratio of men to women will change under this new method. 
Statistics from Institutional Re­search show that just over half of all women students are in the College of Arts and Letters. Another 40 percent are evenly distributed in the Colleges of Business and Science, six percent are engineers, and three percent are architecture students. 
While few female students report cases of outright discrimination in their classes, Ava Collins, director of the gender studies program, said that many women "feel a sense of disem­powerment in the classroom." 
"I still think that women students have small voices," Collins said. 
Women don't speak out in classes for several reasons, said Avallone. Many women find if they express a feminist opinion, professors will often call on them as the "class feminist," a label that is often considered demeaning, she said. 
Other women have found that "gender specific name-calling" occurs in the classroom, and there is still the fear that men won't date women who appear too intelligent, she added. 
"In a big lecture, I think it's really intimidating for a woman to speak out," said senior English major Beth Ann Fennelly. 
She also spoke of a drama class that studied only male authors and never addressed issues of gender in the texts. "If texts are sexist, it lays a sexist base to the class," she said. 
Helen Bowers, assistant professor of finance, finds that her women students are less assertive and take fewer leadership roles. Although she sees no difference in test scores between men and women, she said that women speak out less in the classroom. 
Another business student said that 
she thinks male professors have 
different expectations for men and 
women. "Women are often taken less 
seriously. They don't think you're the 
driven type," she 
said. 
d f th Although she is

said. "I don t feel comfortable that their life is free of sexism." 
But Notre Dame has changed for the better over the years, said Hofman. "You have to know what it was like before to really compare," he concluded.

CAMPUS MINISTRY . ..CONSIDERATIONS 

The naming and the healing 
Perhaps you remember this story: Many years ago, out in the country, Jesus was confronted with a man possessed by the devil. Before healing the man, Jesus addressed the evil spirit, and when he did so he asked the devil for his name. 
But the devil was not so easily tricked. He replied: "My name is Legion, for we are many." 
An insignificant little story, perhaps, but it is one that we could spend a long time mulling over during these Lenten days. 
There was a reason the devil would not give Jesus his name. In Old Testament times, people believed that there was a real power in naming. They were loathe to disclose their names to anyone, for fear that the stranger would have some kind of control over them. It is very different from our society, where we'll plaster our names just about anywhere, from license plates to tee-shirts. Signing our names or disclosing our identities doesn't seem to have the sacredness it once did. 
But in some ways, our ability to name, and the power that can happen in that naming, is just as significant as it was two thousand years ago. This is especially true when it comes to things that have control over us. 
Many things can control our lives-they are legion, just as the devil cunningly observed in the story above. They may be destructive habits, like alcohol and substance abuse, or an eating disorder. Or we may be controlled by events from the past that seem not to fade from our memory. People experience great struggles with lonelines and depression. Relationships that are treasured and 
very beautiful can to turn to shame, for reasons that seem to be beyond our control. And sometimes, that which controls our life is just simple anxiety­
we don't know which direction to take, or what the future may hold. 
When we begin to name the habits, the events, fears, or the memories that hold us back, we begin a journey back toward the Light. One of the greatest examples of the power of naming, and the healing that comes from it, is rooted in the experience of the addict. The first step toward recovery is to accept the fact that you are what you are, and that you cannot control who you are. In that moment, a long process of healing begins. There is a total acceptance -a naming, if you will-of one's condition or predicament. The healing stems from that moment of truth and revelation. 
Thankfully, we can name more than the dark habits of our life. The truth of 
naming is just as powerful when we identify those things that can help us out of 
our dilemmas. These are the tools that help us focus on hope, or help us derive 
some inspiration out of our everyday struggles. What are these tools? Where 
can their names be found? 
One of the greatest tools we have is the knowledge that we are never far from 
God's embrace. There is a poster/reading that many around here are fond of, 
called "Footprints in the Sand." It speaks of the truth that, especially during 
moments of intense adversity and loneliness, God is always present. 
Another great tool is inspiration, the kind we get when we read something very 
profound, or listen to beautiful music. The Psalms are songs -love poetry, as it 
were, of God's continued relationship with humanity. In the psalms can be 
found many inspiring tools that can help us shape our lives. 
For instance, the first psalm we hear during Lent is Psalm 51, the response for Ash Wednesday. It is also our response for the First Sunday of Lent, and continues as a refrain for many of the weekdays: "Have mercy on me, 0 Lord; in your kindness cleanse me from sin." What does this refrain name as its truth? One is this: that in our transgressions, we are cleansed by kindness. Not through guilt, or aggression, or some kind of righteous wrath. We are cleansed by kindness. The kindness that Jesus talked about when he told stories of Loving Fathers and Prodigal Sons.  
One hopeful image during Lent is taken from the writings of the prophet Isaiah, and read in our churches on Friday following Ash Wednesday: " ... Lift up your voice like a trumpet blast! Would that today you might fast so as to make your voice heard on high! " And later on in the passage: "This is the manner of fasting that I wish: Releasing those bound unjustly, untying the thongs of the yoke, and setting free the oppressed!"  
It is a hope-filled reading, heralding great joy and freedom-not what we're used to finding in Lenten readings. And it offers us some insight into what our Lent could really be like. Why not, during this season, forget about the candy and dig down into what really causes our pain? Why not look at the season of Lent as a time of release, as a time of preparation for joy, as a time to set free ourselves and those around us from the things that drag us down? Instead of seeing this as a period of deprivation, why not look at these days as an opportunity for living in abundant prayer and peace?  
We can do this in so many simple ways. Tum to the psalms, our poetry and prayer-book of the Scriptures. Look within our own hearts, and the hearts of those with whom we live. What are our burdens? Can we name them? And after naming them, can we also find some inspiration to better cope with our plight? Can we help those we love name the things that keep them imprisoned? And, if we have the courage to help with the naming, can we accompany our friends (and ourselves) on the ensuing journey to wholeness?  
There is a wonderful discipline to the season of Lent. Giving up things we like, turning more to prayer and inward peace, and partaking of community activities all help us to focus on who we are, and the kind of people we are meant to be. But perhaps the greatest aspect of the season has nothing to do with our activities, but with our ability to get in touch with, to name, the aspects of our lives that help or hinder our day to day journey to God. When we begin to name these aspects of living, then we begin our Lenten pilgrimage toward Easter joy.  -

By JASON KELLY Sports Writer 
Records can be distracting. Worrying about breaking a record can shift the focus from the game at hand. 
Muffet McGraw doesn't expect that to happen tonight against Butler as she tries to become Notre Dame's winningest women's basketball coach. 
"The only record we're con­cerned about is six straight MCC championships," McGraw said, referring to Notre Dame's dominance in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference tourna­ment in recent years. 
McGraw is currently tied with Mary DiStanislao with 115 wins, but breaking the record won't be an easy task tonight against Butler. 
The Bulldogs already clinched the MCC regular-season title and they handed the Irish an 82-70 loss in January. 
Butler brings a talented squad into tonight's game, led by Julie VonDeilingen, who scored 25 points in the last meeting. Angela Cotton and Mary Majewski each added 15. 
"They're talented and they 
have a lot of experience," Mc­Graw said. "They can beat you from anywhere on the floor." 
Notre Dame is much im­proved since the last meeting with Butler, winning six of their last seven. including a 91-63 rout of Duquesne Monday night. 
Against the Dukes, the Irish had six players in double fig­ures, led by sophomore Audrey Gomez and freshman Stacy Fields with 17 points each. 
Freshman Carey Poor has emerged since entering the starting lineup against Dayton. In her three starts she has to­taled 59 points, connecting on 22 of 33 shots from the field and 13 of 16 from the free throw line. 
"I'm really happy with the way the team is playing right now," McGraw said. "We had some trouble with Butler ear· lier this year, but some of our younger players are really starting to play well." 
Letitia Bowen and Kara Leary are expected to return to the lineup tonight after sitting out the Duquesne game with in­juries. 
Seniors

goals in his career, but his presence has been appreciated. "Eric's come a long way in his development, and we'll miss his competitiveness," Schafer said. 
"The senior defensemen have taught me a lot, and I've gained valuable experience from them," said freshman David Dalgrande. 
The Irish will lose one of their goalkeepers with the gradua­tion of Stevens Point, WI native, Carl Picconatto. Picconatto typi­fies the true student athlete with a cumulative 3.77 GPA in chemistry. 
"He's a pleasure to be around daily, and he's a scholar and gentleman," said Schafer. 
Picconatto, a valuable backup throughout his career, cracked the lineup in November and registered the Irish's first win of the year on November 20. 
"It was a dream to play col­lege hockey and Notre Dame gave me the opportunity," he realized. "It's sad to be leaving, but the team is pumped for a 

win." 
The other three seniors are forwards. Marvin, a three year monogram winner from War­road, MN, has contributed 18 goals in his career. 
"I think he's played his hard­est on every shift in his entire career, which is a tribute to his work ethic," said Schafer. 
"I have mixed feelings about ending my career," said Marvin. "It's been a long year, and I want to leave the Joyce on a high note." 
"My whole career has been worthwhile, and our class has a lot to be proud of," he added. "I want to thank the fans for sup­porting us for four years." 
Janicke, an assistant captain from Brooklyn Park. MN, has 144 career points and ranks ninth on the all time Irish assist list with 98 total assists. "He's a hard nosed competitor who's contributed a lot to our pro­gram," said Schafer. 
Although he's had nagging injuries throughout his senior campaign, Janicke has man­aged to score a team leading 12 goals. ''I'm excited, but I'm a little nervous considering it's my last game," he said. ''I've had a pretty good career and I've enjoyed every minute of it." 
Bankoske, an assistant cap­tain from Williamsville, NY, has had the opportunity to be a part of Notre Dame hockey for five years because of a wrist injury suffered last season. 
"He's a gifted athlete and a real gentleman," said Schafer. 
Bankoske has 177 career points and ranks eighth all time on the Irish assist list. "It's ex­tra special, because I've been here five years," he said. "It will be weird to reminisce about all the memories I've experienced on and off the ice." 
As the Irish close out their first season of CCHA play, the seniors leave behind a young and talented squad. "We're a couple years behind some of the top teams, but we're coming along and I appreciate the efforts of our senior class,"

Tlw Notn~ Dame men's basketball team ended their home schedule with a disappointing 80-66 loss to Valparaiso last night. The Irish finished the year with only four wins at home. llowever, on tlw bright side, Matt Adamson, a third year senior walk-on ended his home career in grand fashion. 
Adamson, a 6-] guard from Fair Oaks, CA. startPd his first ganw and scored a career high eight points while playing a career best 20 minutes. Also. he had three steals and numerous deflections throughout the game. 
"l11~ had a great game," said Irish coach John MacLeod. "We didn't plan on playing him so much, but he was playing so well that we left him in." 
"It was exciting to start. and I played as hard as I could," commented Adamson. "It was sad to lose the game." 
"Walking off the court for the linal time was tough," he added. 
Although lw's not a captain, Adamson commands attention. "He's a leader and he always has intelligent things to say," said senior co-captain Monty Williams. 
"liP's a gnat asset to our program and he's just a great guy," added junior co-captain Brooks Boyer. "I'm just glad I got the opportunity to be around him for three years." 
"lie proved tonight that he's a good player," added Boyer. "lie has a great future in whatever he decides to do." 
Adamson has endured three seasons of banging bodies during practice, but he's enjoyed every mmmmt. 
"This game was my most memorable moment, but it was bittersweet because we lost," he said. "It's been a great three years." 
The surprising play of Adamson limited freshman guard Hyan Hoover to only nine min­utes of action. while starting guard Lamarr Justice registered only ten minutes.

BRYAN CONNOLLY 
Face Off 
Initial CCHA season frustrating for Irish hockey 
Frustration. The only word which 
properly describes the Notre Dame 
hockey team's feelings toward its 
results this season is frustration. 
Through thirty two games this year the Irish hockey team has battled to a somewhat disappointing record of 7­23-2. 
To the average Notre Dame sports fan, these numbers would indicate that the hockey squad is a rather untalented, uncompntilive team. 
Numbers can be deceiving. 
The 1992-93 edition of the Notre Dame hockey team should not be judged solely in terms of its record. Further examination of their performance this year reveals that the Irish have played competitively against many of the best teams in the country and that they could clearly be a .500 team right now had a few more pucks bounced their way. 
This season has been marked by a number of major changes which have madP a strong impaet on the success of the learn. The most significant change the Irish encountered was rejoining the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, a league which is considered by many to be the premier college hockey league in the nation. They have also faced a major revamping of their lineup with the addition of nine regularly playing freshmen. 
Before n~entering the CCHA, the Irish spe~t eight years playing as an independtmt against teams which varied greatly in terms of talent. By jumping to the CCIIA they joined a league whieh has produced four of the last nine national champions, including last year's winners, Lake Superior State. 
Thirteen of the team's 23 losses this season have come from the hands of teams which are ranked in the top ten in the nation. The Irish have also lost six one-goal games, which leads the CCHA, and two two-goal games. 
If the outcomes of these tight contests were reversed the Irish would have had a 15-15-2 record, an outstanding accomplishment by a team in its first season of CCHA play. 
The Irish were disadvantaged earlier in the season by inexperience against teams of CeliA calibre. They lost their first eight games of the year against their league opponents. a streak which was ended when they tied the University of Illinois-Chicago at the UIC Pavilion on November 14. After garnering that point the Irish went on to capture six of their next eleven contests, a stretch which finished with the squad going 5-2-0. 
Since this stretch the Irish have been plagued by injuries to key players. Captain Matt Osiecki, alternate captain Curtis Janicke, and freshman Jamie Morshead have all missed games due to shoulder injuries. Janicke, who has missed six games since the team went on its tear, is tied for the team lead in goals and is second in overall scoring.

Hockey looks fora win in home finale 
By DOMINIC AMOROSA 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame Hockey team 
concludes regular season play in the 
Central Collegiate Hockey Association 
with a home game tonight against 
Bowling Green (15-20-1 overall; 10-17-1 
in CCHA), and a Saturday night road 
game at Michigan State (21-12-2 overall; 
17-9-2 in CCHA). 
Notre Dame enters the game with a 7­
23-2 overall record after dropping two 
games last weekend to CCHA powers 
Western Michigan and Michigan. 
The Irish currently hold tenth place in 
the CCHA standings, while Bowling 
Green ranks seventh. 
"We'll honor our seniors before the 
game, and hopefully win one for them," 
said Irish coach Ric Schafer. 
Tonight's game marks the final home game for six Notre Dame seniors. In order to stop Bowling Green. the Irish must contain Falcons sophomore center Brian Holzinger, who has scored 24 goals in his last 28 games. "He's one of the premier players in the league," commented Schafer. "Jeff Has­selman has slowed him in the past, but he's a little banged up and we'll have to 

It won't be a relaxing vacation for the Notre Dame baseball team 
By JENNY MARTEN Associate Sports Editor 
This won't be a relaxing spring break. Playing three top-10 teams and the ·California Angels in seven days, the Notre 
Dame baseball team won't have much time to work on their tans during a seven-game roadtrip out west which features No. 6 Arizona State, No. 7 Wichita State and No. 8 Arizona. 
"We want to establish ourselves as a solid club. We know we're a good ballclub and we know we're going to be a good ballclub at the end of the year. It's always difficult in the initial games to go out and get the feel of things," said fifth-year Irish head coach Pat Murphy. 
Last year, the Irish (48-15) went to the Atlantic Regional championship game of the NCAA tournament, but lost to Miami, 5-l. Unfortunately, the team lost several key players from that team including Craig Counsell, Joe Binkiewiez, Cory Mee, Pat Leahy and Mike Rooney. 
"I don't know if you could ever replace those guys. Those six guys, they're a special group of people," said Murphy. ''I'm looking for some guys to emerge like them, but I don't know if we can replace those guys." 

Valpo runs away from the lri~h, 80-6 
The 1993 team would like to try. 
At the plate, senior sluggers Eric Danapilis (.377, 6 HR) and Eddie Hartwell (.359, 3 IIR) will pace the Irish. Notre Dame will also get plenty of help from designated hitter and comeback kid, Korey Wrobleski. Wrobleski injured his back before his freshman season started and now, after four years of rehab, is back in action. 
On the mound, the Irish are led by an experienced pitching staff which has earned a reputation as hard-working and hard-nosed. Leading the returning staff are AI Walania (RHP, 9-4, 2.94). Chris Michalak (LHP. 10-5, 2.20), Dave Sinnes (RHP, 8-1. 2.31) and Tom Price (LHP, 7-1, 2.80). Bob Lisanti and Matt Haas will share the duties behind the plate. 
"I think this is a solid group of pitchers who will get it done. They're not necessarily great pitchers. They're just winners," said Murphy. 
In general, the defense is weakened by inexperience. Four players are at new posi­tions making half the defense game-day rookies.

The Irish had to settle, however, for fine performances by their lone graduating senior and their top scorer in an 80-66 loss to the Crusaders. 
Matt Adamson, who scored a career-high eight points, and Monty Williams, who poured in 29, were the only two bright spots for Notre Dame.

Seniors say goodbye against Bowling Green 
By DOMINIC AMOROSA Sports Writer 
Tonight's game at the Joyce ACC Fieldhouse will be the last time that six Notre Dame seniors grace the home ice in their careers. Dave Bankoske, Eric Gregoire, Curtis Janicke, Dan Sawyer, Dan Marvin, and Carl Picconatto finish their home careers tonight at 7:00p.m. against Bowling Green. 
As a result, the Irish carry some extra emotion into tonight's contest. 
"It's a cuhnination of four years coming to an end with very few wins at home," realized Sawyer. "There will be a lot of emotion, but it will be fun." Sawyer, a defenseman and three-year monogram winner from Kinnelon, NJ has 24 goals and 40 assists in his career. 
"Dan's had an up and down year, but he's playing the best hockey of his career right now and he's been a valuable member of our program," said Irish coach Ric Schafer. 
Gregoire, another defenseman, had yet to think about his last game. 
"It hasn't hit me, but I'd love to go out on a winning note," he said. 
A three-year monogram winner from Ithaca, N.Y., Gregoire has scored only 6 
see if he can go." 
Hasselman, a sophomore, has played in 63 consecutive games, but a shoulder injury may limit him tonight. 
Besides Holzinger, BGSU boasts a 40 point scorer in senior Brett Harkins, and a 39 point scorer with junior Sean Pronger. 
"We're a little banged up, so everybody needs to contribute offensively and defensively," said Irish assistant captain Dave Bankoske. 
For Notre Dame, Bankoske, senior Curtis Janicke, and freshman Jaime Ling outside, and I wish he would have played more on th1· perimeter tonight." 
The second half began a!-. evenly as the first, but David Hedmon hit a long thren to put the Crusaders ahead for good, 42-39. The Irish stayed close until a chaotic scramble for the ball ended in a Notre Dame turnover, whieh Redmon converted on a layup and a foul to make the score 57-51.

will be looked upon or a scoring punch. 
"We need production from our leaders, because if we put it together we can beat them," Schafer explained. 
Bankoske has been rolling lately with three goals and three assists in his last six games to increase his season totals to 12 goals and 13 assists. 
Janicke, who missed four games prior to last weekend, has scored 12 goals and handed out 18 assists during the season.
