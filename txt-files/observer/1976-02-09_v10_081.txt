Golden to leave admissions post 
by Mary Rukavina Staff Reporter 
Sister Anna Mae Golden will leave her post as St. Marys' Admissions Director effective June I, 1976. 
Golden's plans are to return to the teaching ranks after her four years as head of admissions. She will be a math instructor at Holy Cross Academy in Kensington, Maryland. 
A search committee is already in the process of looking for a replacement to fill the admissions post. 
liolden explained the hiring pro­cedure for her position. "The school advertises in chronicles of education. That is the usual pro­cedure for administrative positions. The search committee then follows up on resumes, conducts inter­views, and then makes a final decision." 
The admissions department was completely revamped under Gol­den's directorship. Several new policies and changes were made during her four years as Admis­sions Director. 
She commented on several ot the changes. "I came here right after the merger with Notre Dame fell through. Soon after, Notre Dame became coed which meant we had to re-evaluate our position, partic­ularly in terms of admissions." 
She continued, "We realized we had to revise our admissions sys­tem and some changes were made." Golden listed some of the changes. "We revised our admis­sions literature, organized an ex­tensive recruiting program, and conducted studies on different parts of the country where we receive heavy enrollment." 
"We instigated a volunteer pro­accomplished but said she was

For in­stance, we draw SO per cent of out student body from public high schools and the other SO per cent · from private or Catholic schools." 
The admtnistrator stated, "Al­though our student body isn't as economically as diverse as it could be, there are many reasons for this." She added, "Funds are necessary to bring in minority and economically disadvantaged stu­dents. You need a large endow­ment and most private schools just can't afford it, St. Marys being no exception."

the members of the caucus. Government appropriation for birth control and improved agricultural methods were the main features of the plank. 
Passage of the ERA also met with majority approval of the Caucus . Equal rights in social, political and economic areas were seen as an inherent part of the amendment. The caucus added the stipulation that women should take full responsibility for participation in the armed forces. 
The first issue discussed con­cerned economic growth through shared tax responsibility among military, corporate, and personal sectors. Boards comprised of equal representation would be set up to regulate federal spending. 
The Caucus unconditionally ac­cepted the pro-health-care plank of the platform. This advocated the institution of government-support­ed free clinics run by doctors fulfilling their military service re­quirements._ It also allowed for a national health insurance system and mandatory checkups for ele­mentary school children. 
Economic inconsistencies were determined to be the root of the busing problem. The caucus decided equality of school and administration standards should be strictly enforced. The majority affirmed that integration in the schools could prove beneficial. 
The caucus adopted a platform position in favor of stringent gun control. Provisions included strict registration laws, a three-month

"Hopes pinned on the Damascus summit to work out solutions for the crisis have now come true," Karami said after flying back to Beirut with Franjieh, a Christian. ''The course of the future is now paved." 
In the streets of Beirut, the faces of some of the 10,000 who died in the war stared ablankly from hundreds of posters as the living walked past Sunday. Each neigh­borhood and practically every street has its own open-air gallery of wall-poster photos of ''fallen martyrs."

More than 15,000 dead 
GUATEMALA CITY,,Guatemala.-At least 15,035 persons perished in Guatemala's devastating earthquake and aftershocks, the emergency relief committee announced Sunday. 
The committee said its death toll was revised on the basis of new reports from the Chilmaltenango area, 40 miles north of the capital. It estimated 40,000 persons were injured and 200,000 were made homeless by the quakes that began Wednesday. (See story page 7). 
Hua warns of 'bad elements' 
TOKYO--Hua Kuofeng, China's new acting premier, is a man who has warned of bad elements within Communist party ranks and called strongly for clearing them out. 
It is not known whether Hua's position is a stepping stone toward permanent premier status or whether he is to be caretaker during a long, sharp fight within the party over who would succeed the late Chou En-lai, China's premier for a quarter century. 
Speed skaters settle controversy 
INNSBRUCK--The United_ States' Olympic Committee refused again to budge in the controversy that has shaken the American speed skating team here, so the skaters settled things themselves Sunday. A skater many believed belonged in the Winter Games got his starting spot when a teammate stepped aside. 
Charles Gilmore of Anaheim, Calif., said yesterday he voluntarily was surrendering his berth in the men's 1,500 meters to Eric Heiden of Madison, Wis. Only a few hours earlier, the USOC rejected a request by Dr. Jack Heiden, Eric's father, to let his son start in next Friday's 1,500 race instead of Gilmore.

Calls for 'Black agenda' 
Poinsett addresses festival 
by Nick D'Giuvine Staff Reporter 
Mr. Alex Poinsett, senior editor of Ebony Magazine, called for a "Black Agenda for the 1970's in the first address of the Black Cultural Arts Festival, given in the Library Auditorium last night. 
Speaking before a crowd of about 100, Poinsett explained that this agenda should encourage an effort to obtain a reformed income tax; a full employment program (citing that 25 per cent of all black workers are unemployed); quality health care; and full enforcement of voting and civil rights acts. 
Poinsett also proposed the for­mation of a Black Party, which would be entirely concerned with black problems and issues. He stressed, however, that the intent of this new party ''would not be to replace the existing Democratic and Republican Parties." Instead, it would give blacks a chance tc express their opinions on black issues and secondly, serve as an effective lobby. 
Black America today is in a state of crisis, according to Poinsett. Many of the racial victories won in the sixties have been lost in the seventies. He encouraged all blacks to re-evaluate themselves and their goals. 
Poinsett revealed that many black leaders are doubtful as to whether they will accept an invita­tion to join in the Bicentennial Celebration. They fell that, in Poinsett's words, "we have no­thing to celebrate." Also, they feel that the celebrations would merely "over shadow two centuries of' black oppression." 
Poinsett also expressed his sur­prise and displeasure in finding out that there were only two hundred black students at Notre Dame and only fourteen blacks on the faculty. 
Another important issue discus­sed by Poinsett was discrimination of blacks on the college level. He felt a need to publicize the discrim­inating actions of many universi­ties, which he termed "hypocritical cathedrals of liberalism," to the public. 
In Poinsett's opinion, black col­lege students of today do not have the same enthusiastic academic drive that black students of the fifties and sixties did. He noted that poor study habits and perhaps laziness could be reasons. 
Poinsett has a B.S. degree in journalism and a masters degree in philosophy, both received from the University of Chicago. He also

Law plagerism cases clarified by Dean Link

Senior Staff Reporter 
Rumors of a ''Witch hunt against the first year class" were dispelled by Dean David T. Link Friday as he clarified the results of the ten alleged violations of the Notre Dame Law School Honor Code. 
Although it was a record number of cases, the dean later denied that the number reflected any trend in the law school. 
To an open forum assembled in the law school lounge the dean clarified that the plagerism cases involved the final projects of the legal research and writing, a first year course. Three students were found guilty and of those, two will be suspended for one year. Sanction is still pending on the third. 
The trials which followed the procedure outlined in the Hoynes Code were held in secrecy, names undisclosed. Two of the accused students chose to appear before the Honor Code committee consisting of three faculty members and three

students selected by the president of the Student Bar Association (SBA). Seven others, however, opted to go solely before the dean. 
The investigation involved re­searching the papers, talking with the professor and grader, and then finally confronting the individuals with the papers in which a co-oc­curence was detected. In three paired cases, final papers appeared to be similar. In one case the papers were duplicates. The two students had their papers typed by a South Bend typist who accidently typed the same drafts twice. 
"There was no forced use of lie detectors as rumored,'' Dean Link affirmed. "The law of polygraphs will not allow it. Two students volunteered to take polygraphys and we gave them the opportuni­ty." 
Although lie detectors have been shown to be 90 percent reliable in affirming innocence, they are not completely reliable in proving guilt, the dean added. 
''The evidence was helpful to the two students. Ifthe tests were bad, the results would not have hinder­ed them. The tests, however, were not necessary in either case," Link said. 
The large number of allegations arose in part from the vague rules defining the amount of assistance permitted in completing the final projects. In practice, projects students were allowed to work together, but in the final they could talk about their projects to others only in "general terms." 
The problem of looseness in the final was definitely a factor which we weighed in these cases, Link said. "The students had different understadnings as_ to how far they could go." 
The two convicted students were suspended rather than expelled from the law school on grounds that there was no "character flaw" which would prevent them from becoming ethical professionals, Link clarified. 
''They admitted their guilt at the first hearing. These were salvage­able cases. There was no reason that these two could not become future lawyers," Link continued. After one year the students will be readily accepted back into the law school. 
The allegations prompted an investigation as to whether the present honor code should continue at the Notre Dame Law School. The honor code is a student operated set of rules and proce­dures regarding the ethical taking of exams and the preparing of research papers. In signing to uphold the code upon admittance to the law school, the students also agrees to "report to the dean or president of the SBA those circum­stances suggesting a violation." The withholding of such informa­tion is therefore a "dishonest act" according to Article 2. 
An alternative to the honor code would be aj faculty imposed set of rules enforced by faculty police­ment. The difference involves taking exams in proctored rooms and a reduction in the number of take-home finals. 
Dean Link also suggested an optional honor code, a successful procedure which existed prior to 1962. Those students who did not sign the code took exams in different rooms. Those who com­mitted themselves to the code, on the other hand, were responsible for turning in their fellow students if violation occured. 
Link passed out a questionnaire to those attending the open forum. The questions sampled student opinion towards the ethical invi­ronment at the law school as well as the desireability of continuing the present honor code. 
"The code only works if the students are willing to turn in fellow students," Link believes. "I think there should be a student policed honor code and that we should live under it." 
Riots paralyze Barcelona 
Catalans demand home rule 
BARCELONA, Spain -AP -Thou­sands of Catalans demanding home rule and political liberty defied police Sunday in the biggest anti­government demonstrations in Bar­celona since the Spanish Civil War. 
Police fired rubber bullets and smoke grenades, bullied demon­strators and pounded on honking automobiles but were unable to stop the scores of protests that paralyzed the Catalan capital for more than five hours. 
The city's streets were littered with broken glass and park benches as demonstrators fired back with stones. Some sectors of the city were in a virtual state of siege. Several injurtes and arrests were reported. 
Police did not give an estimate on the number of demonstrators, but an organizer of the protest said at least 50,000 persons took part, and that the number of participants !conceivably ·ould have been twice that many. 
The protest was the biggest show of opposition power, despite mas­sive police precautions, against the new government since it took over after the death of Gen. Francisco Franco last November. 
The Catalan region in northeast Spain won autonomy in 1932 from the republican government. Fran­co abolished it after winning the civil war 7 years later. 
But the region, the wealthiest in Spain, and its 7 million people have retained strong feelings for more independence from the central government. The Catalan lang­uage still is banned from official use although it is widely spoken. 
the height of Sunday's protest, police jumped in and out of buses and jeeps chasing demon­strators. But it soon became evident they could not keep up with the street protests. One politician estimated as many as 20 street demonstrations were under way at one time. 
The demonstrators shouted against King Juan Carlos and leaflets called for the ouster of Premier Carlos Arias Navarro. 
The protests peaked when youths wrapped the Catalan flag around a monument in Victory Square. The monument honored Franco's victory in the 1936-39 Civil War. 
Hundreds of motorists joined in the demonstration by honking their horns in time to chants for "liberty, 
liberty." Others left their stalled cars to wave handkerchiefs in sipport of the street marchers. 
Police bloodied several passers­by. They clubbed one girl to the sidewalk in front of a bank and left her there screaming.

The evolution of sexuality un­doubtedly began as a means of reproduction insuring a greater diversity of genetic characteristics within the same species, but in the higher animals it became more than a mechanism by which the stock survives.

Interest in genitality begins long before puberty and continues after fertility has disappeared precisely because mutual pleasure, not nec­essarily including animal reproduc­tion, is the main function of human sexuality. With all the things in the world that make life hard and painful, denying the only universal­ly available creature comfort to oneself or others is criminally cruel.

Can he, an alienated representative of spiritually archaic thought-forms commit himself to more than a statutory rapport with those of us who are his more unsavory sheep? I speak, I think, for all of those at this university of Our Lady who have been persecuted and reviled salivatingly by other members of the academic and religious com­munities because we hold dear to us beliefs, desires, needs, and stimulatory wishes and techniques that run "contrary to the moral philosophy expressed by most ho­mo sapiens." 
I speak for flashers, neurotics, fetish lovers, Teutonics, psycho­tics, ax-handle murderers, compul­sive lavatory gigglers, stamp col­lectors, those of multi-sexual in­clinations, and anthropoids when I say that our behavior is not "ser­iously disordered", but rather a natural outgrowth and beautiful expression of the specific emotions and special perceptions that God has seen fit to bestow upon us 'in our development of unique personali­ties. We are a heaving, vital community which seeks fulfillment, as everyone does in life, through the means which best equip us for functioning in today's world. 
We fail to see any concrete motivation, other than blind pre­judice, for such persecution direc­ted towards ourselves, and we have been known to get quite agitated and often, in human weakness, lose control in the face of such unseeing stupidity. 
Therefore we ask that those in places of authority recant contrite­ly the damaging statements made concerning life-habits before we are forced to crush their systems of organization viciously and with the most frenzied malevolence.

Misconstrued History Lesson 
Dear Editor: 
Pat Hanifin concluded his "His­tory Lesson", Tuesday's commen­tary in the Observer, by voicing his fear that there would be no peace in our time. Indeed, if we all misconstrue history to the same magnitude as Mr. Hanifin, his fear will no doubt become reality. 
Mr. Hanifin states that the Senators and Congressmen who votedoverwhelmingly to cut off aid to the pro-western groups in Ango­la have learned the wrong lesson from Vietnam. The lesson to be learned, according to Mr. Hanifin, is that we did not fight to win in Vietnam, that we "put too many limits on the use of our power." I wonder how the Vietnamese people would react to such a view -these people who wept during the most massive daily bombing raids in history-raids which make Hitler's bombings of Britain seem trivial in comparison. 
Must we stand by once again and watch Americans look at a small country as a battleground for the United States and the Soviet Union, instead of what it actually is -a small country which has recently 
gained  its  independence,  and  
which  is  trying  to  unify  and  
nationalize  its  people  under  one  
government?  

Perhaps it is Mr. Hanifin who has learned the wrong lesson from Vietnam. What our Congressmen have finally learned is that you cannot stop a revolutionary idea from spreading with military might; if Vietnam taught us no­thing else, it taught us that bombs cannot destroy ideas. It taught us · that America has no right to use its great military-industrial complex to support corrupt, quasi-democratic governments in nationalistic fights against opposing communist go­vernments which have the support 
of that nation's people. 
It taught us that the fate of Vietnam was ultimately, as John F. Kennedy once stated (whom Mr. Hanifin also misinterpreted), for the Vietnamese to decide, just as ultimately the fate of Angola will be decided by the Angolans. 
But our most important lesson of all was that we. should never again listen to the Mr. Hanifin's who urge us to rush into civil wars when we understand neither that na­tion's history or culture. Ameri­cans are only now realizing that we fought a war which was both morally wrong and unnecessary in Vietnam. Our Congressmen are now seeing to it that we don't repeat this tragedy. 
With all of Mr. Hanifin's worries that the US is somehow _losing a

By experimenting on germ-free rats, a team led by Dr. Morris

Bentson may withdraw 
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -Sen. Lloyd Bentsen was reevaluating his campaign Sunday after trailing badly in Oklahoma precinct cauc­uses, signalling that he may be dropping out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomina­tion. 
Bentsen said in a statement telephoned here from Texas by a spokesman that he is ''taking a close look" at his future campaign plans. The spokesman declined to answer specifically whether the statement meant the Texas senator might drop out of the race for the nomination. 
But two weeks ago, after Bent­sen finished fourth of five candi­dates in Mississippi with less than two per cent of the vote, a source close to him said if he finished a weak third in the Oklahoma cauc­uses, he might have to drop out. 
In fact, with nearly 70 per cent of the precincts counted, he had only 
l 
11.97 per cent of the committed delegates, just slightly ahead of Alabama Gov. George Wallace and considerably behind the uncom­mited delegates, 35.4 per cent; former Oklahoma Sen. Fred Harris, who had 19.89 per cent and former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, who had 19.87 per cent. 
"It would be pretty tough," the Bentsen source said of the possibil­ity of a poor showing in Oklahoma. "He'd have to slide out or say it ain't possible. That's his neighbor­ing state. He's got to run strong." 
Bentsen, from neighboring Tex­as, had one of the largest campaign organizations in Oklahoma and spent heavily for media exposure ­television and radio spots and newspaper advetisements. 
"In light of the outcome in Oklahoma, I'm taking a close look at my plans, talking to supporters in Texas and across the country," Bentsen's statement said. "I'll have a statement after I can evaluate the situation." 
Just days before the caucuses, Bentsen had said Oklahoma was not a "make or break" state, and he planned to stay in the campaign regardless of his showing. 
His supporters had predicted, however, that he would run well, and his campaign was pitched primarily to his closeness to Okla­homa and his understanding of the problems facing Oklahoma farm­ers, ranchers and oilmen.

Gene~ code linked to cancer in Notre Dame's laboratofies 
by L. Abraham Rowe, Jr. Staff Reporter 
Scientists at Notre Dame's Lo­bund Laboratories have been inves­tigating long-range microbial ef­fects, with germ-free and gnoto­biotic animals for almost thirty years. Recent cancer research at the laboratories has shown a direct link between the genetic code and susceptibility to cancer. 
Dr. Morris Pollard, director of Lobund and chairman of the de­partment of Microbiology, said, "We have revealed clear evidence of genetic susceptibility to intes­

tina) cancer." 
A research team led by Drs. Pollard and Tomoaki Asano fed a chemical called dimethylhydrazine to three pure strains of germ-free rats in order to induce cancer of the colon. 
The rats received identical treatment; however, their reactions were far from identical. One hun­dred percent of the animals in one strain developed intestinal cancers. In the second strain, none of the animals developed cancer. Some of the animals in the third strain developed cancer, while others did not. 
Reds gain control 
By The Associated Press 
Soviet-backed Popular Move­ment forrces have taken control of the town of Santo Antonio do Zaire, "an important populated area" in northeast Angola, Tass said Sunday. 
The official Soviet news agency said '' a large number of enemy personnel were captured during the seizure of this port town situated close to the border with Zaire." 
Opposing United Front FNLA and mercenary forces continue to hold two other towns along the Angola-Zaire border, the Luanda­datelined dispatch said. 
On the eastern front, Popular Movement MPLA troops captured the town of Lomege, opening the way to a major transport junction on the Benguela railway known as Lozo, Tass said. 
-The news a~ency also quoted from an i':!_terv~ew given by MPLA Defense Minister Enrique Carrera to an Italian newspaper, RepubUca, in which he said the northern military operations are nearing completion. 
After mop-up and consolidation operations in the north, Carrera was quoted as saying the MPLA troops would concentrate on the southern front against South Afri­can troops and forces of the Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA. 
Tanzanian Foreign Minister I­brahim Kaduma, who just returned home after a tour of Angola and 
audience 
announced trip to China on the eve of the-voting here. He said Nixon was going as a private citizen and had no obligation to report to Ford. 
-Repeated his call, issued in Washington last week, for a consti­tutional amendment turning the abortion issue over to the states. 
-Said he still favors a constitu­tiona) amendment, first offered in the 1960's, to allow prayer in public schools. It was the first time in the two-day trip that Ford directly attacked Reagan, or any of the Democrats in the field, although in h_is public .statem~nts he _has con­ststently trted to pt~ture htmself as the sohd, . responstble leader a?d 
other African countries, said the MPLA controls 70 per cent of Angola militarily and 100 per cent politically. 
He told an interviewer from government-owned Radio Tanzania that the Organization of African Unity should grant membership to the People's Republic of Angola, as thea_ MPLA calls its Luanda-based 
re~me. 
In Bloemfontein, South Africa, meanwhile, Interior minister Con­nie Mulder launched a scathing attack on U:S. policy in Angola. 
He described the Soviet involve­ment in the southwest African state as the most blatant act or interference in the affairs of an­other country since the Cuban missile episode of 1962. 
Mulder told a political rally that the Angolan situation had been an ideal opportunity for the United States to take revenge on the Soviet Union for what had happened in Vietnam. But he said every fourth year the United States became virtually powerless because of the sensitivities of candidates in presi­dential elections. 
Mulder said the Russians were thoroughly aware of this and exploited it. 
The interior minister also · said 
the U.S. Congress apparently wanted to show who was boss in the 
United States after the Watergate 
scandal, and that it was question­
able whether such a country was 
still worthy of being considered the 
leader of the Western world. 
Because the experiment was conducted in a controlled environ­ment, the only differences were in the genetic characters of the ani­mals. The susceptible rats did not develop cancer spontaneously, but every rat in the susceptible strain which consumed the cancer­causing drug developed intestinal tumors. _ 
"This further supports our view that very important factors in the production of human colon cancer are found in the environment--very possibly in the diet--and that the disease will appear most frequently in those who are genetically sus­ceptible," Pollard said. "The pos­sibility that susceptible individuals will develop colon cancer may depend on their exposure to the cancer-inducing agent.'' 
The next step for Lobund scien­tists is to determine the chemical nature of resistance to cancer. 
The germ-free animals obtained by Caesarian section, are main­tained in a germ-free environment for their entire life. The gnotobiotic animals are obtained by the same method, but they are raised in an environment which contains a spec­ific microbial flora, that is, the experimenter knows exactly which microbes the animals are living with. The researcher may then study and accurately define the effects of a singular microbe on the animal's life-cycle. 
One of the revelations to come from studies at Lobund Laborator­ies is that germ-free rats have less lymphoid tissue and lower serum gamma-globulin. Both of these are part of the body's immunal system. With no microbes to fight, the defense system is decreased. Also, germ-free rats have a lower cardiac output and decreased blood flow to certain areas. 
Studies on germ-free intestinal tracts indicate that conventional animals, those which are not germ-free, have a chronic intestinal inflammation. Also, germ-free rats live longer than their conventional counterparts. The males generally outlive the females, a trend which is reversed in conventional rats.

DURHAM N.H. (AP) -Presi­dent Ford told a student audience dotted with hecklers Sunday night that "acrimony and antagonism 
left over from another day" only get in the way of progress. 
Ford addressed some 3,500 peo­pie at the University of New Hampshire basketball arena in an appearance marked by periodic jeers from the crowd. But the applause for the President repeat­edly drowned out heckling. 
Earlier, Ford had made his first direct attack on challenger Ronald Reagan in his two-day trip cam­paigning in the nation's first pri­mary state. He said he thinks the voters will accept him on his record in the New Hampshire presidential 
primary rather than Reagan's "rhetoric and words." During a question period follow­ing the speech, Ford was asked if Angola were a Vietnam situation, 
would the United States get into it with manpower and support. His answer was: "There is no possibil­
ity that this country in any way mine our abililty to face the future with better results," Ford said. "Blind criticism is no better than blind faith." 
In an earlier news conference for New Hampshire reporters, Ford voiced confidence the voters will accent his record. 
Although Ford's campaign aides have conceded he faces a tough fight against Reagan in the Feb. 24 voting, the President said, "I'm quite optimistic" and that he sees no necessitv for debatin~ Reagan.
