Kernan addresses conflicts on death penalty 
Former Indiana governor explains personal issues, policies at NDASK's third lecture 
By KATIE KOHLER 
News Writer 
Joe Kernan made history by granting two death row inmates clemency during his term as Indiana governor ­decisions that generated dis­cussion during Notre Dame Against State Killing's (NDASK) third guest lecture Wednesday night in the Hammes Student Lounge of the Coleman-Morse Center. · 
"The death penalty is a very serious issue," said Kernan, an adjunct professor of political science and 1968 Notre Dame graduate. "It was life-altering for me." 
During a lecture entitled "The Reality of the Death Penalty's Application," Kernan spoke about the decisions he m a d e regarding the death penalty while in office. 
Kernan, who said he supports the death penal­ty in principle, opposed employ­ing it twice while governor. He has said the death penalty should only be used in the most serious cases. When he granted clemency in 2004, it marked the first time in 48 years that a death sentence was repealed in the state of Indiana. 


Kernan's first death penalty clemency case involved a rob­bery and murder by Darnell Williams in 1986. According to Indiana statute, Williams was eligible for the death penalty after jurors found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of committing two statutory aggravators -a crime involv­ing multiple victims and mur­der in the course of a robbery. 
"When it came apparent to me that we were going to see this case, I called my staff together to see how to approach it and give it the scrutiny it deserves," Kernan said. 
Having never dealt with such a decision before, Kernan and his staff were faced with new obstacles. 
"It became as sobering as it gets. It was something com­pletely new to us," he said. 
Once the process began, Kernan sought counsel from University President Emeritus

Panel examines University culture 
rituals and lack of self-esteem -characteristics, the skit argues, that make Notre Dame prone to this violence. 
While audience members suggested the· creation of co-ed dorms and more resources for women who have children on campus, more broadly, they noted the need for a changed attitude toward sex and gender relations. That idea of a bigger cultural adjustment was the emphasis throughout the dis­cussion. 
Mahmood said Notre Dame needs a "deeper cultural change" to combat sexual vio­lence on campus, including redefining femininity and mas­culinity as well as how men and women relate to one another. 
Another problematic aspect of Notre Dame culture, pan­elists said, is the issue of silence in response to sexual violence.

NDSMCOBSERVER.COM Students discuss legalities 
Undergrads receive off-campus advice 
By EILEEN DUFFY Assistant News Editor 
At the request of the Student Senate, Notre Dame Law School students gathered in a DeBartolo classroom Monday night to offer some legal expertise to would-be off-campus undergraduates. 
The six law students, who are all members of the Notre Dame Legal Aid Clinic, provided infor­mation on landlords, leases and the city's controversial recently amended disorderly house ordi­nance in what Clinic director Bob Jones called "preventative lawyering." 
"We're: happy to do this because we typically see people after they get in trouble, and we're trying to untangle them," Jones said. "We're trying to make you educated consumers." 
The law students first covered the basic rights and responsibili­ties of landlords and renters, then outlined the steps of mov­ing in and moving out. 
Law student Mary Komperda suggested involving the landlord in all steps of the process, from reading the original lease to walking around the empty apartment or house together. 
Law student Matt Lilly then offered advice for "when things go wrong," urging students to keep written records in all inter­actions with the landlord, should a case end up in court.

The relationship between the culture of the "Notre Dame bubble" and sexual violence on campus was central to the third and final post-performance panel discussion of "Loyal Daughters" Wednesday night. 
History professor Gail Bederman moderated dialogue between theology professor Maura Ryan, Lynn Bradford of the St. Joseph County SOS Rape Crisis Center, anthropology pro­fessor Cynthia Mahmood and "Loyal Daughters" author Emily Weisbecker. 
Mahmood said colleges have high rates of sexual assault and "Notre Dame's campus is not exceptional Ito this trend]."

Fair Trade handicrafts sold on ND campus 
Profits benefit artisans of developing nations 
By JENNIFER METZ 
News Writer 
The colorful beads, pots and other handicrafts for sale this week in LaFortune and the Mendoza College of Business will leave some students thinking they stumbled upon an interna­tional open-air market-and, in a sense, they have. 
The handcrafted goods are from developing countries and are being sold on campus this week as an opportunity for stu­dents to learn about Fair Trade and the artisans behind the crafts. 
The shops, open today in the Dooley Room of LaFortune and tomorrow in the Mendoza Atrium from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., are co­sponsored by the Office of International Studies, International Student Services and Activities and the Gigot Center for Entrepreneurial Studies in collaboration with Ten Tbousand Villages -an organi­zation that provides income for artisans by telling their stories and selling their goods in North America.

Phoxy and phabulous 
When it comes to dorm life at Notre Dame, many prominent figures stand out. 
There's the picturesque arch in Lyons, the gargoyles on Alumni, the towering pres-Katie McDonnell 
ence of the Manor, the "Go Irish" sign in that News Writer far away land we all know as Carroll Hall. 
But not all of us reside in buildings with such memorable exteriors. 
Some of us reside in dorms, that when we must go around the semi­nar room and list our name, dorm and major, we endure blank stares. 
Pangborn? That's a dorm? 

Yes, that awkwardly named build­ing does in fact exist in what many students presume to be a void between Fisher's green "F" and the Rock. 
While fall foliage may contribute to a blending in with the landscape, Pangborn's short stature and boxy, prison-like appearance may also play a part to the myth of its non­existence. 
Presumably to make up for the lack of aesthetic beauty, however, twin lions grace the entryway to this fine piece of architecture -lions which, I must admit, have proved quite amusing upon returning many a weekend night when friends test them out for a ride. 
I also think we may be the only dorm to have metallic crucifixes nailed into every one of our closets ­quite a unique and special feature to treasure. 
Add to this the thrashing force of the South Quad wind tunnel each winter and the 15-minute walk to the library, and the merits of this fine place seem unlimited. 
If the physical description wasn't enough to convince you of Pangborn's grace, the hall's prestigious history certainly will. Built in 1955 and dedi­cated to the generous Pangborn brothers -who inspired the names of my roommate's fish, John and Tom (although John has sadly passed)­Pangborn Hall became a women's dorm in the early 1990s. 
The Violence of Pangborn were· con­stantly at war with the Fishermen, we're told, and used to conveniently roll kegs across the putting green into the basement windows. 
Norm from Cheers is often hailed as our greatest alum -even though Wikipedia tells me he was kicked out of the University for earning a 0.0 G.P.A. 
Not every dorm has an issue with misspelling every word that begins with an "F", or can refer to itself with as endearing of a name as "The Pang." 
If you still remain unimpressed, all domers must listen to the irrefutable Father Hesburgh. 
"I know I speak for generations of Notre Dame students in expressing the University's gratitude to Thomas Pangborn and John Pangborn for their magnificent gift," he said at the dorm's dedication. 
You certainly speak for me, Father Ted. The gift was phabulous.

Thai zoo hopes panda porn inspires mating

in court, don't blow it off," he said. 'That would be the single worst thing you could do. Stand before the judge and present your case." 
The next part of the presenta­tion centered on South Bend's disorderly housing ordinance ­a law that has been around since 
the early 1990s, said law student Chris Pearsall, but was amended in the summer of 2005 to include activities that "are directed more toward students than the general public." 
Conducts pro­hibited by the ordinance include well-known drinking viola­tions, but Pearsall also identified lesser-known

activities like gambling, disorder­ly conduct and criminal reckless­ness -which, Pearsall said, refers primarily to hazing activi­ties. 
"I know there's been some pressure in the dorms to crack down in disorientation events, and they're moving off-campus," he said. "You'd not only face very serious repercussions at Notre Dame, but you could be cited by the city." 
The ordinance also includes a rule about the sale of alcohol without a license -meaning, Pearsall said, keg parties charg­ing guests $1 per cup. 
Should students violate the ordinance, the city sends a notice to abate to both the landlord and the residents, which includes a fme that can range from $250 to 
point, Pearsall said, 

he reminded stu­dents that just one violation could merit that notice to abate -which could result in eviction. 
"It's a heavy hammer that has to be appointed judiciously," he said. "Don't engage in prohibited activity." 
Law student Toni Mardirossian discussed the general principles for dealing with law enforce­ment, should officials arrive at an off-campus residence. 
"The police have a tremendous amount of discretion," she said. "They have the option to give you a warning and ask you to shut the party down. They could also issue you a ticket. Or they could slap handcuffs on you and arrest you." 
Mardirossian emphasized courteousness, suggesting stu­dents ask police to "come back in 30 minutes" to prove they will put an end to a gathering. 
A policeman can enter if he sees a crime being committed, Mardirossian said, and once inside, he has the right to cite a resident for anything in plain view. 
"He can't search your under­wear drawer for marijuana," she said. "But if you have an under­age person drinking or a bong sitting in the corner, you're in trouble." 
If arrested, Mardirossian said, a student also has the right to remain silent -even if a police­man hasn't yet read aloud the Miranda rights. 
"But the best way to avoid criminal penalty," she said, "is to avoid them coming to your door in the first place."

the single most important fac­tor that continues sexual assault," Mahmood said. "We don't know what to say, we don't have the words, and we don:_t know what's appropri­ate. 
Ryan echoed Mahmood's statement and said a poor definition of sexual violence has hindered conversation. 
"As long as we continue to confuse sexual activity with sexual violence we will contin­ue to ask the wrong questions on how to stop it," she said. 
To change that, Bradford said, more awareness is nec­essary. 
"Education is a huge part of changing the culture we live in," she said. 
Ryan agreed, and said "there is a need to make basic information available to our students." 
For Weisbecker, the answer to reducing sexual violence could lie in students "flnd[ing] some valuable social activities besides drinking," since alco­hol is associated with an over­whelming majority of sexual violence cases. 
Weisbecker also addressed opposition voiced for "Loyal Daughters," including the crit­icism that her play dealt with issues of sex and sexuality in a "morally neutral" manner. 
She said the goal of the play was not to explain Catholic teaching to audiences or preach right from wrong but rather to give "a glimpse of what's really going on [so they can] make [their] own deci­sions." 
And in the field of sexual violence, Bradford said, debates on "neutral" morals are irrelevant. 
"[Morals] don't exist because they have been taken away," she said. "[Sexual vio­lence] is not a moral issue at all." 
Through "Loyal Daughters," Weisbecker gave "a portrait of the reality of campus life," Mahmood said. 
"She was giving voices to other people," she said. 
Weisbecker encouraged audience members to attend a student-hosted fundraiser that follows tonight's final per­formance at 9:30 p.m. at the Beiger Mansion. Proceeds from the fundraiser will go to S-0-S and the YWCA of St. Joseph County.

of the CLC. 
The issue of whether stu­dents should be required to take a test checking their knowledge of the University Academic Honor Code was one of the topics discussed at last week's Faculty Senate meeting, said representative Philippe Collon. The reason for a yearly test stems from new honor code situations that can arise -ones students should be aware of, he said. 
Faculty representatives also discussed classroom safety in light of recent violent attacks in schools around the country. 
"What are the responses fac­ulty should take if situations arise in classrooms?" Collon asked. 
Pasquerilla East senator Emily Cooperstein spoke on behalf of the Community Relations committee about the Northeast Neighborhood Council meeting she attended Monday night. At the meeting, one South Bend resident said she has seen "vast improve­ments" in students' behavior and noise levels on football weekends in the past few weeks, especially in the Washington Street area, Cooperstein said. 

"There are some who have really expressed thanks and congratulations for helping improve community relations already," she said. 
Another woman said South Bend residents are open to enter into a relationship with students, but said students have to take the first step, Cooperstein said. 
A resolution regarding clocks in classrooms should be pre­sented to the Senate soon, Academic Affairs chair Jim Grace said. He also informed the group that if students picked classes on the first day of registration this year, they would have a registration time on the second day next semes­ter, and vice versa. 
Social Concerns chair Sheena Plamoottil said representatives from Amnesty International will be coming to speak to stu­dents at their hall councils in the coming weeks. Alliance for Catholic Education representa­tives will also be coming around to hall councils with a new outreach program for undergraduates, Hesidence Life chair Pat Knapp said. 
The Multicultural Affairs committee has developed a group that will look at minority faculty retention and recruit­ment, said chair Destinee DeLemos. University Affairs chair Aly Baumgartner asked senators to e-mail her sugges­tions for topics for the Catholic Think Tank lecture series, a set of discussions that bring promi­nent Catholics to Notre Dame.

will "educate people about the mission of Ten Thousand Villages and the overarching concept of fair trade." 
The organization, which began in 1946, now operates at about 100 retail outlets throughout the U.S., including six stores in Indiana. One of the world's largest fair trade organizations, it has built rela­tionships with more than 100 artisan groups and more than 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Central and South America. 
"[We hope that students] will understand a little better the cultural and economic contexts under which the artisans pro­duce these handcrafts," Peterson-Miller said. 
Often artisans from these developing countries are not paid enough to plan for their future. Fair Trade, according to the Ten Thousand Villages' Web site, can help artisans "see hope for the future, earn digni­ty and respect in their commu­nity and experience joy in being able to provide for their fami­lies." 
Money from the campus mar­kets' sales goes to Ten Thousand Villages, which returns as much of the income as possible to the artisans. 
Ten Thousand Villages is part of a worldwide organization called the International Fair Trade Association, which sup­ports fair trade as "an alternate approach to conventional inter­national trade," reads the Ten Thousand Villages Web site. 
The organization aims to help excluded and disadvan­taged producers though "pro­viding better trading condi­tions, by raising awareness and by campaigning," Peterson­Miller said. 
"Of course it's wonderful to (just] look around, see what these handcrafts look like, maybe purchase something for a Christmas gift," Peterson­Miller said. "[But] as part of International Education Week [we hope the shops] introduce these concepts [of Fair Trade], goods, artisans and cultures to the University campus."

is that we were ahead of the curve," he said. "We started the process before normal, which gave us time to deliberate." 
The only way to change the law, Nussbaum said, is through the legislative process. 
"Electing representatives that will change the laws is the best way to make a differem:e," he said. 
Kernan is a member of the Indiana Assessment Team of the American Bar Association's Death Penalty Moratorium Implementation Project. This group is currently evaluating the need for a moratorium on the death penalty in Indiana. 
The lecture concluded with a question and answer session, during which Kernan addressed how the Catholic faith affected his decisions. 
"It is part of who we are. It is impossible not to in1pact us," he said. "Each man had to look at his own soul." 
But, Catholicism wasn't the only factor in his decision-mak­ing, Kernan said. 
"It is not enough just to say your Catholic faith makes the death penalty wrong," he said. "You need to find a way to come together with a good sense and a good will." 
Kernan encouraged students to continue their activism if they want to make a difference. 
"Things like this can make the views of America known," he said. "Just be thoughtful in all you do."

Father Edward Malloy, as well as other respected advisors. 
"I needed to talk to people I had the utmost respect for to get their take on the issue," he said. 
Exactly one week before Williams' execution was sched­uled, Kernan granted him clemency in exchange for a life sentence without parole. 
His reasons included propor­tionality of the crime, doubt about Williams' role and person­al competence. 
With an IQ of 78, Williams tested just three points above the mentally ill IQ level of 75. The execution of the mentally ill is illegal. 
Kernan said he was taught to recognize the death penalty as appropriate in certain circum­stances. 
"Through the process, I per­sonally went through an analysis of my views on the death penal­ty," he said. "I never gave it much thought before because it didn't affect me." 

As Kernan reevaluated his views on the death penalty, he said one of his greatest advan­tages in the process was his "non-lawyer" status. 
"My views were less rigid," he said. "The issue had more lati­tude because we were all able to form our own opinions." 
The experience, he said, influ­enced the rest of his time as gov­ernor. 
"It is a sobering experience to make a decision on another per­son's life. Sometimes, it is just more difficult to be on the field than in the stands." 
Kernan granted the second case of clemency for Michael Daniels, who -with an IQ of 77 -lacked competency and rea­sonable doubt of his participa­tion in the crime. In Daniels' case, however, inadequate coun­sel was the biggest factor in his prior death sentence. 
"There are always two sides to every story," Kernan said. "Daniels' difficult childhood made a difference in what he perceived as right and wrong. Childhood does matter and it was a great concern." 
Kernan also addressed the

political perspective behind the death penalty. 
"There is less fervor for the death penalty that there was five or 10 years ago," Kernan said. "Now people have focused their attention on it." 
Kernan's clemency decisions came at a critical point in his term as governor. With less than four months prior to the elec­tion, Kernan commuted Daniels' sentence. 
"Make no mistake," he said, "there was election pressure from the political side about granting clemency that people said was suicidal. The decision was crucial because the odds of it not being well received were so high. 
"I made the decision for me, not the election." 
Kernan praised Indiana for some of the recent reforms to make trials more fair and to avoid the death penalty. Rule 24, for example, created standards for competency of counsel and experience in capital cases. 
"Indiana is blessed with great jurists," he said. "I think it is because jurors are appointed, not elected." 
Kernan's view on the death penalty hasn't changed com­pletely, he said, even after his direct experiences. He recalled a personal experience that affirmed his partial support of the death penalty. 
Kernan's "worst day as mayor" of South Bend occurred on Aug. 25, 1990, when a triple homicide in a local drugstore led him to believe those guilty of the crime "deserved to die." 
"I still find myself supporting the death penalty under extreme circumstances," he said. 
"I am more lukewarm, howev­er, that I was before I went through this process. I am grate­ful to have gone through it." 
After Kernan spoke, his gener­al counsel and close friend Dick Nussbaum gave input on his experiences. 
"Graduating from Notre Dame helped me form my opinions on the death penalty," he said. "We were the first people to grant clemency in years. Others will now follow our example." 
Nussbaum praised Kernan's entire team in the success of their decisions.

Bush: U.S. still trustworthy ally 
SINGAPORE -President Bush is seeking to reassure nervous Asian allies that the United States will remain a reliable partner in liber­alizing trade, confronting North Korea's nuclear threat and fighting terrorism after an election upheaval back home. 
In Bush's first overseas trip since Republicans lost the House and Senate, world leaders are looking for any sign of change since the election repudiation of his Iraq poli­cy. 
In an early embarrassment for Bush, the House failed to approve normalized trade relations with Vietnam -a move Bush want­ed completed this week. Instead, Congress probably will consider it in December. 
Bush's eight-day journey takes him to Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia. A week later, he will be in Europe for a summit of NATO leaders. The two trips will take him away from Washington at a crucial time when the postelection, lame-duck Congress is dealing with issues the White House has deemed vital. 
Earthquake prompts tsunami warning 
TOKYO -Thousands of people living along northern Japan's Pacific coast fled to higher ground Wednesday after a powerful under­sea earthquake prompted tsunami warnings as far away as Alaska. 
The 8.1-magnitude quake struck an area claimed by both Russia and Japan, but the waves did not swell higher than 23 inches. There were no immediate reports of casual­ties or damage. 
Japan's meteorological agency withdrew its tsunami warning after about three hours. Tsunami warnings posted for Russia and coastal areas of Alaska also were canceled.

White House resubmits nominees 
WASHINGTON -The Bush administration, trying to push through judicial nominations before Republicans lose control of the Senate, on Wednesday resubmitted the names of six nominees who Democrats say are too conser­vative for the federal bench. 
Five of the nominees in question were the subject of an angry exchange in August when Democrats charged that their selection was a sop to the president's conservative base. 
The White House submitted six names Wednesday: Terrence Boyle of North Carolina and William James Haynes II of Virginia to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.; Michael Brunson Wallace of Mississippi to the 5th Circuit in New Orleans; Peter Keisler to the D.C.

Homicide suspected in death of four 
ELKHART -Investigators had few answers Wednesday into how or why four young chil­dren were killed in the basement of their home a night earlier, but said there was no reason for others in the community to be concerned for their safety. 
"There's no one out and about we think the community should be concerned about," police Capt. Steven Mock said. 
No arrests were immediately made, but the deaths of the two girls and two boys were ruled homicides. Autopsies on Wednesday determined the children died of asphyxia, but police said they did not know exactly how they were killed. 
Withdrawal timetable criticized 
U.S. commander rejects Democrats' argument, predicts surge in violence 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The top U.S. commander in the Middle East warned Congress Wednesday against setting a timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, rejecting the arguments of resur­gent Democrats who are pressing President Bush to start pulling out. 
Gen. John Abizaid instead urged quick action to strengthen Iraq's gov­ernment, predicting that the vicious sectarian vio­lence in Baghdad would surge out of control within four to six months unless immediate steps were taken. 
"Our troop posture needs to stay where it is," and the use of military adviser teams embedded with Iraqi army and police forces needs to be expanded, Abizaid told the Senate Armed Services Committee. It was the first hearing on Iraq policy since last week's elections gave Democrats control of both houses of Congress starting in January.

Democrats evaluate environtnent 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON The Democrats who will steer envi­ronment issues in the new Congress are polar opposites of their Republican predecessors, but changing environmental pol­icy is like turning around an air­craft carrier -it's very slow. 
Sen. Barbara Boxer, a liberal California Democrat and one of the biggest environmental advo­cates on Capitol Hill, was named Tuesday to chair the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. She replaces Oklahoma Republican James Inhofe, who says global warming is a hoax and wanted to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency established by President Richard Nixon. 
On the House side, the approach to endangered species and opening public lands to pri­vate development will do an about-face with Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., expected to take over the House Resources Committee. He would replace GOP Rep. Richard Pombo, a California rancher, defeated for re-election last week after envi­ronmentalists spent nearly $2 million against him. 
"Our long national nightmare is close to being over," said Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, paraphrasing Gerald Ford on assuming the presidency after Nixon's resignation over Watergate. 
Democrats will focus on cut­ting pollution blamed for global warming, accelerating toxic waste cleanups, reversing Bush administration tax and regulato­ry breaks for energy producers and switching the government's course back to strict protections for endangered species. 
Their environmental allies are back on offense. "We've been forced to play defense most of the past six years," said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters. 

Energy companies will likely be put on the defensive. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif'., the pre­sumed next speaker of the House, has already promised to repeal oil industry subsidies. 
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the likely next chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, plans to investigate Republicans' oil subsidies included in the energy bill Bush signed into law last year. Dingell said he also was interested in revisiting Vice President Dick Cheney's secretive energy task force. 
Environmentalists say any global warming policy must be accompanied by higher fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks. On that issue, they worry that Dingell, who repre­sents thousands of auto workers and is a strong ally of the auto industry, could stand in the way. 
Dingell has opposed raising those standards because of con­cerns that jobs could be lost and automakers might suffer even more than they are now eco­nomically. 

Among Boxer's first moves will be a bill to curb greenhouse gases, modeled after her home state's approach which seeks to lower emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. 
"Some of the practical solu­tions are in the California approach" of Hepublican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, she said. 
Already, John McCain of Arizona and other Republican senators have proposed bills or expressed support for mandato­ry caps on the U.S. fossil fuel­burning emissions of carbon dioxide. 
Even some Republicans say that President Bush might even­tually agree to address global warming by imposing a nation­wide cap on greenhouse gases. A system for companies to swap the rights to pollute would be established under the cap. 
That would require a second 180-degree reversal of his stance on global warming. He entered office in 2001 pledging to regulate industrial carbon dioxide emissions but came out against regulation shortly after­ward. To date, Bush has favored voluntary strategies and more research and development. 
Simpson book causes anger, guilt, suspicion 
Publisher advertises release as confession 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -O.J. Simpson created an uproar Wednesday with plans for a TV interview and book titled "If I Did It" ­an account the publisher pro­nounced "his confession" and media executives condemned as revolting and exploitive. 
Fox, which plans to air an interview with Simpson Nov. 27 and 29, said Simpson describes how he would have committed the 1994 slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Honald Goldman, "if he were the one responsible." 
Denise Brown, sister of Simpson's slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, lashed out at publisher Judith Regan of ReganBooks for "promoting the wrongdoing of criminals" and commercializing abuse. The book goes on sale Nov. 30. 
She added: "It's unfortunate that Simpson has decided to awaken a nightmare that we have painfully endured and worked so hard to move beyond." 
Regan refused to say what Simpson is being paid for the book but said he came to her with the idea. 
"This is an historic case, and I consider this his confession," Regan told The Associated Press. 
Simpson was acquitted in 1995 of murder after a trial that became an instant cultur­al llashpoint and a source of racial tension. The former football star was later found liable for the deaths in a real killers. 
Simpson has failed to pay the $33.5 million judgment against him in the civil case. His NFL pension and his Florida home cannot legally be seized. He and the families of the victims have wrangled over the money in court for years. 
The victim's families could go after the proceeds from the book's sales to pay off the judgment. But one legal ana­lyst said there are ways to get around that requirement ­like having proceeds not go directly to Simpson. 
"Clever lawyering can get you a long way," said Laurie Levenson, a Loyola University law school professor and for­mer federal prosecutor who has followed the case closely. 
Levenson noted that the criminal justice system's pro­tection against double jeop­ardy means Simpson's book, explosive as it may be, should not expose him to any new legal danger. She added that Simpson could create an extra layer of insulation from any legal worries by presenting the story hypothetically. 
"He can write pretty much whatever he wants," Levenson said. "Unless he's confessing to killing somebody else, he can probably do this with impuni­ty." 
Simpson did not return numerous calls for comment. Simpson's own attorney Yale Galanter said he did not know about the book or the inter­view until this week. 
"The book was not done

US Airways bids on Delta Air 
Merger could initiate chain reaction, potentially industry consolidation 
Associated Press 

ATLANTA -US Airways made a hostile $8 billion bid for Delta Air Lines on Wednesday, ignoring Delta's repeated statements that it isn't interested in a merger. The move could start a stampede of competing bids in a long-predicted industry consolidation.

Heart valves offer hope to repair future defects 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO -Scientists for the first time have grown human heart valves using stem cells from the fluid that cushions babies in the womb -offer­ing a revolutionary approach that may be used to repair defective hearts in the future. 
The idea is to create these new valves in the lab while the pregnancy progresses and have them ready to implant in a baby with heart defects after it is born. 
The Swiss experiment follows recent successes at growing bladders and blood vessels and suggests that people may one day be able to grow their own replacement heart parts -in some cases, even before they're even born. 
It's one of several sci-fi tissue engi­neering advances that could lead to homegrown heart valves for infants and adults that are more durable and effective than artificial or cadaver valves. 
"This may open a whole new thera­py concept to the treatment of congen­ital heart defects," said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup, a University of Zurich sci­entist who led the work, which was presented Wednesday at an American Heart Association conference. 
Also at the meeting, Japanese researchers said they had grown new heart valves in rabbits using cells from the animals' own tissue. It's the first time replacement heart valves have been created in this manner, said lead author Dr. Kyoko Hayashida. 
"It's very promising," University of Chicago cardiologist Dr. Ziyad Hijazi said of the two studies. "I don't doubt" that it will be applied one day in humans, he said. 
One percent of all newborns, or more than 1 million babies born worldwide each year, have heart prob­lems. These kill more babies in the United States in the first year of life than any other birth defects, accord­ing to the National Institutes of Health. 
Heart valve defects can be detected during pregnancy with ultrasound tests at about 20 weeks of pregnancy. At least one-third of afllicted infants have problems that could be treated with replacement valves, Hoerstrup said. 
"It could be quite important if it turns out to work," said Dr. Robert Bonow, a Northwestern University heart valve specialist. 
Conventional procedures to fix faulty heart valves all have drawbacks. Artificial valves are prone to blood clots and patients must take anti-clot­ting drugs for life. Valves from human cadavers or animals can deteriorate, requiring repeated open-heart surger­ies to replace them, Hijazi said. That's especially true in children, because these valves don't grow along with the body. 
Valves made from the patient's own cells are living tissue and might be able to grow with the patient, said Hayashida, a scientist at the National Cardiovascular Center Hesearch Institute in Osaka. 
The Swiss procedure has another advantage: using cells the fetus sheds in amniotic fluid avoids controversy because it doesn't involve destroying embryos to get stem cells. 
"This is an ethical advantage," Hoerstrup said at the meeting. 
Stetn cells fight dogs' dystrophy 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Stem cell injections worked remarkably well at easing symptoms of muscular dystrophy in a group of golden retrievers, a result that experts call a sig­nificant step toward treating people. 
"It's a great breakthrough for all of us working on stem cells for muscular dystrophy," said researcher Johnny Huard of the University of Pittsburgh, who wasn't involved in the work. 
Sharon llesterlee, vice president of translational research at the Muscular Dystrophy Assoeiation, called the result one of the most exciting she's seen in her eight years with the organiza­tion. Her organization helped pay for the work. 
She stressed that it's not yet clear whether such a treat­ment would work in people, but said she had "cautious optimism" about it. 
Two dogs that were severe­ly disabled by the disease were able to walk faster and even jump after the treat­ments. 
The study was published online Wednesday by the journal Nature. It used stem cells taken from the aJTected dogs or other dogs, rather than from embryos. For human use, the idea of using such "adult" stem cells from humans would avoid the con­troversial method of destroy­ing human embryos to obtain stem cells. 
The Nature paper focuses on Duchenne muscular dys­trophy, a muscle-wasting genetic disorder that afl"ects only boys and occurs in about 1 in every 3,500 male births. It's the most severe and most common childhood form of muscular dystrophy and the best-known. In theory, the stem cell treatment might also help other muscle dys­trophies or even age-related muscle wasting, Hesterlee said. 
Boys with Duchenne dys­trophy have trouble walking as early as preschool, and nearly all of them lose their ability to walk between ages 7 and 12. Typically, they die in their 20s because of weak­ness in their heart and lung muscles. There is no known cure. 
The dog study was done by Giulio Cossu, director of the Stem Cell Research Institute at the San Haffaele Scientific Institute of Milan in Italy, with colleagues there and else­where. 
"We do not know whether this will work in patients," Cossu said in a telephone interview. lie said he hopes to start a small experiment in children in the next year or two. 
The scientists worked with golden retrievers that suffer a crippling form of dystrophy very much like the human one. Researchers studied the elfect of repeated injections into the bloodstream of a kind of stem cell extracted from blood vessel walls. 
The best results appeared when the cells were taken from healthy dogs. But Cossu said scientists should pursue the possibility of genetically manipulating a patient's own cells and using them instead. That way, patients wouldn't have to undergo lifelong treatment to avoid rejection of donated cells. 
In one of several experi­ments, three dogs that had not yet shown impairment in walking were injected five times, a month apart, with cells taken from other dogs. 
One dog completely avoided symptoms and continued to walk well even five months after both the injections and the anti-rejection therapy were stopped. 
A second dog also did well initially but died suddenly of a heart problem after just two months on the treatment. It's not clear whether the problem had anything to do with the treatment, or whether the initial good result would have continued, Cossu said. 
The third dog showed par­tial protection, being able to walk and even run with a limp, but then progressively lost walking ability within a few days after the anti-rejec­tion treatment was stopped. 
The researchers also treat­ed two dogs that were severe­ly impaired by the disease. Both gained the ability to move much faster and to jump, and one was even able to run, although neither could use the hind legs normally.

CHINA 
Law-s ban large dogs, force scared ow-ners underground 
Associated Press 
BEIJING -Elaine Loke is shutting down her dog boutique and will spirit her golden retriev­ers Hippy and Bally out of Beijing to escape the city's sweeping anti-rabies campaign. 
Dog owners like Loke have been scrambling to hide their pets in the face of a new crack­down which allows only one dog per household and bans breeds taller than 14 inches. Fears have been fueled by graphic Internet pictures and witnesses who say police are beating to death strays and dogs that run afoul of regu­lations. 
"I can't believe this is happen­ing," said Loke, 33, who keeps the curtains in her first-floor apartment drawn to ward off prying neighbors and walks her dogs in an underground parking lot. "It's so stressful. In the morning, I hear dogs barking and people talking outside my home and I think the police are coming." 
The pressure is so bad that Loke is returning to her native Hong Kong and closing a busi­ness she has had for two years. 
In China, dogs have long been seen as a source of meat as much as companionship. But the current crackdown has touched a nerve in the rapidly moderniz­ing capital, especially among its

"What kind of rules are these? I don't expect everybody to love animals. But I do want to have my rights to keep pets," said Clare Xiao, an account manager at an advertising company. She sent her larger Brittany to a ken­nel run by a friend and kept her Pekinese, a stray she found on the street. 
"What the government is doing is just disappointing, cold and emotionless," said Xiao. 
Many of the prohibitions have been on the books since 2003, but only sporadically enforced. The city of 13 million people has 1 million dogs, half of them unregistered, according to state media. 
A sharp increase in rabies cases nationwide has prompted the renewed vigilance. Only 3 percent of China's dog's are vac­cinated against rabies and the disease is nearly always fatal in humans once symptoms develop, though it can be warded off by a series of expensive and painful injections. 
Officials have extended the 2003 rules to cover not only Beijing's center but some outly­ing areas. The clampdown, announced Nov. 6, gave owners until Thursday to comply or the dogs would be seized and the owners fined. 
One owner Zhu Qiao has moved three times since 2001 to fmd areas where her black-and­white dog, Gou Gou, could be raised safely and within the law. 
"He's part of my life, he's my friend and family," said Zhu, 30, a television producer. "If you want to impose a law, you have to get the opinion of dog owners and experts. You can't just take them away." 
"I can't move again. There's no option but to hide him and if he gets taken, I'll go with him." 
Another owner had his Labrador retriever taken away Wednesday because she was too big. 
"She is a very amicable dog. She never barked," said the owner, a businessman who would give only his surname Yang.. "If they don't allow me to raise her here, I will fmd another place. I will get her back." 
Witness accounts and photos on the Internet have shown dogs being captured in nets and pum­meled with wooden and metal sticks. But authorities have vowed to carry out a "strict but civilized" campaign that police hoped would not anger dog own­ers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. 
"I have never heard of dogs being culled after they were caught by police. Dogs are a man's best friend and we treat them as friends, even when we have to lock them up for the sake of public security," Xinhua quot­ed a Ministry of Public Security official, Bao Suixian, as saying. 
Many owners have sent their dogs to kennels outside the city. Some are handing them over to friends and family.

Back in the days when I was young and naive, I asked my mom what a prostitute was. She said that it was someone who sold her body for money. 
Thus, I grew up believing that a prostitute was one who earned a living by sawing off her own body parts ­an arm, a leg or perhaps even an ear. 

And in my pre­adolescent mind, that wasn't an absurd concept. After all, as illus­trated in the most indispensable book of the fourth grade, "How to Eat Fried Worms" by Thomas Rockwell, people will do ridiculous things for want of money. In the book, Billy attempts to eat 15 worms in 15 days for a 50 dol­lar reward. And if this kid would eat worms for money, it'd only be feasible for older folks to do more drastic things -like chop off body parts. 
And that wasn't the only false pre­tense that I grew up under. For years, I also believed that the Pilgrims and Indians ate turkey at their Thanksgiving feast. It wasn't until high school that I learned that turkeys aren't native to the northeast. 
So what did these bonnet-wearing and feathered headdress-donning (or so the myth goes) individuals eat? No, they didn't eat worms like young Billy did. Instead, duck, deer and oysters likely placated their 17th-century palates. 
Further contrary to my childhood beliefs, the first official Thanksgiving 

EDITORAL CARTOON 
didn't actually take place until the Civil War, long after the bonnet-wear­ers nearly exterminated the feathered headdress-donners. In October of 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared "the last Thursday of November next" a national holiday. He instituted the holiday as a means of brightening the lives of the American people, whose spirits had been shadowed by years of ferocious warfare. 
So there you have it-the first two American Thanksgiving tales are sto­ries of people who were gracious in the midst of severe misfortune. They didn't have all that they wanted, but nonetheless wanted to give thanks for what they did have. 
And that's the great thing about this holiday-your life doesn't have to be perfect in order for you to be thank­ful. Neither the newly-implanted-as­American Pilgrims, nor the soon-to­be-nearly-exterminated Indians led perfect lives. Heck, they couldn't even eat turkey. And despite the romanti­cized version of the Civil War that's told today, it was a bleak time in American history. "During-bellum" Americans led lives that were far from ideal. Yet they were thankful anyway. 
But as 21st-century Americans, do we give thanks for what we have? Or are we just hungry for more? 
On Thanksgiving, we want the turkey that the Pilgrims and Indians never had. In fact, we want lots of it, so that we can load up on tryptophan and pass out early without the aid of sleeping pills. After all, we don't real­ly want Thanksgiving; we want the day after it. We want the commence­ment of the Christmas season so we can capitalize on holiday sales, all the while listening to our favorite ballad of wanting, Mariah Carey's "Alii Want for Christmas Is You" on repeat. And our Christmas wish lists -filled with things both tangible and intangi­ble -could probably span the length of the Mason-Dixon line. 
I won't lie. I myself breathe a sigh of relief on the day after Thanksgiving when the Christmas season officially begins and it's finally "legal" to enjoy Christmas music. After all, I no longer have to feel guilty about listening to "All I Want for Christmas is You" when it "acci­dentally" plays on my iPod. This is not to say, however, that Thanksgiving is a holiday that should be overlooked; it's more than merely a bridge to Christmas. 
As the Civil War taught us, bridges can be burned. But even amidst the ashes, one can find things to be grate­ful for. 
You might want things -so much so that at times, you'd consider slic­ing off a body part or two, if only it'd get you what you fancy. But I'm fairly certain that you already have much to be thankful for -like a mom who euphemized the definition of a prosti­tute; she only wanted to protect your innocence. 
Thanksgiving -it's a holiday about appreciating. So let's appreciate it.

Mass from Notre Dame means a lot 
For the past three years, Mass from the Basilica of the Sacred Heart has been nationally televised each Sunday on the Hallmark Channel. Nielsen ratings, adjusted for a Catholic viewing audience, count up to 1.5 million people joining by television our regu­lar worshippers at the Basilica. The many people who write to Richard V. Father Peter Rocca, C.S.C., rector Warner of the Basilica, or to one of the two directors of the Notre Dame FaithPoint Liturgical Choir and the Notre Dame Women's Liturgical Choir, Dr. Gail Walton and Dr. Andrew McShane, respectively, refer to many things they enjoy each Sunday morning when they tune in to "Sunday Mass from Notre Dame." 
They love the astounding beauty of the Basilica. They enjoy the music and the homilies, which they can access each week on the Campus Ministry web­site. They write to tell us how impressed they are by the large number of young men and women who are present for Mass, and how this gives them joy and hope for the future of the Catholic Church in our country. 
They like the wide age spread of the Holy ·Cross priests who preside at the Masses. And they let us in on especially touching moments in their lives. 
One man wrote to tell us that for six months before his wife died of cancer, the two of them "attended" Mass together every Sunday while hold­ing hands and watching the Mass from Notre Dame. At the end of the Mass, their daughter, who serves as a Eucharistic minister in their parish, brought them the Eucharist. 
A woman from California told us that, while she was channel-surfing one Sunday morning while tak­ing a break from gardening, she happened upon the Mass. After more than twenty years as a lapsed Catholic, she started watching the Mass each week. A love for the Church and the Eucharist was reawakened in her heart, and she wrote about the joy she now experiences after returning to the Church last Easter. 
The director of an RCIA program in her parish in Colorado told us of a young man who dropped out of the program last year. He rejoined it as a result of a homily in which the priest asked the question, "Where would we be without the presence of Jesus in the Eucharist?" He realized that was why he wanted to become a Catholic, and did so in April. 
The Hallmark Channel, through Faith & Values Media, continues to televise the Vigil Mass from the Basilica on a tape delay (except for home football weekends, when it is live) at· 8:00 a.m. 
In addition to this, DirecTV will begin to broadcast the 10:00 a.m. Mass live every Sunday in all time zones, starting Dec. 3, on channel 103. They will also televise Midnight Mass from the Basilica this Christmas. And, at the request of men and women serving in the military in Afghanistan and Iraq, "Sunday Mass from Notre Dame" is archived each week and available for them through the Notre Dame website. 
But there's more. 

The Notre Dame Folk Choir and six Holy Cross priests from Notre Dame will soon be offering 15 minutes of song, scripture and reflections every week as a podcast. It will be available starting in the second semester at www.ndprayercast.org. Steve Warner, director of the Notre Dame Folk Choir, is the idea man and organizing skill behind this new Campus Ministry effort. Join us!

Tell me no lies 
There's been a lot of fuss recently about sexual assault. Many college men, obviously sympathetic to the issue, argue that although women are not to blame for rape, there are pre­cautions that can

University of 

situations" less 
Virginia

likely. Don't wear 
Cavalier Daily 

those scandalous mini-skirts. Don't walk home at 4 a.m. Alas, ifit were only so easy. 
All these well-meaning words of advice are based on assumptions and biases that obfuscate the reality of sex­ual assault. When the rapist is statisti­cally more likely to be the nice young man walking the woman home than a stranger from the shadows of an alley, the unfortunate futility of "prevention" is made manifest. Thus, instead of pon­tificating about what a woman can do to prevent the unpreventable, it is more productive to promote an environment of believing the survivor rather than at all implying she had a say in whether or not she was sexually assaulted. 
Women are told by society not to put themselves in dangerous situations; the problem is, any situation can be dan­gerous. First of all, disabuse yourself of the creepy-stranger image of a rapist. Seventy-five percent of rapists have known their victims for more than a year. The very word "rapist" has such a pejorative connotation that most people construct an image completely incon­sistent with reality. Rapists aren't always those guys you see on America's Most Wanted. It's more likely your best friend's boyfriend's friend you had a great time talking to at the bar. In order to wrap our minds around diffi­cult truths, we tend to categorize and simplify people into Disney-esque good guys and bad guys. Yes, there are quite a few categorically bad people who sexually assault women and men. At the same time, otherwise good people make some very sordid decisions. These men may have believed the woman wanted it-she was just play­ing hard to get. But there is pretty clear difference between a woman being playful and a woman who physically and verbally says "no." For such an intimate act, both people should at the very least clearly consent. 
If any life scenario can·become dan­gerous, what is a woman supposed to do? Should she stay in her room all day and night, doors locked, under the cov­ers, armed with a can of mace? What so many people don't understand is that there is no real precaution that can be taken to prevent a rapist from following through on his intentions. 
The most offensive, vile comment made to a sexual assault survivor is that she was too confused to know if she was raped or not. Let's reconstruct the scene: A woman was drillking a lit­tle too much jungle juice at her favorite fraternity, she meets a handsome man wearing a polo of a very flattering shade of pink, one thing leads to anoth­er, and she wakes up the next morning next to someone whose name she can­not remember: Ah, pity the feeble woman whose mind cannot distinguish between regret and rape! What a deeply sadistic and vindictive woman to go through the pains of a rape kit (25 pubic hairs are individually plucked in order to file a police report) in order to ... punish the man? This is simply not what occurs. According to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, less than five percent of rape reports are false. This is a very small number. The bigger issue, however, is the fact that more than half of sexual assaults go unre­ported, according to RAlNN. Most women who are raped never file a police report out of shame and not wanting to endure accusations like those levied against them in today's culture of "what they should have done." 
Instead of questioning a woman who has the courage to report rape, it is much more rational and humane to believe her. The line of questioning used in sexual assault cases versus other types of violent crime puts in relief the prejudice against women. When someone is robbed, people don't ask, "Well, how late were you out?" "Did you fight back?" No, of course not. Why then, is sexual assault so differ­ent? As long as victim-blaming contin­ues to drown out the cries of sexually assaulted women, this culture of silence will persist and envelope our mothers, our daughters and our sisters in a wrought-iron cage of paranoia and self-blame.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Remember how lucky we are 
There will be an empty chair in May. One of our family will not be present on graduation day. Caitlin Brann, a senior at Notre Dame, was killed in a car accident Friday. She was 22. I did not know Caitlin. I cannot imagine what the people who loved her are going through and my deepest condolences are with them, but I feel the loss of a member of our commu­nity. Her death is a heartbreaking reminder of how fragile and precious life is. After I learned the news I asked family and friends how to honor someone that has died. Celebrate the good choices she made, learn from her mistakes and don't waste a single day of our own lives. Mourn Caitlin's death and then celebrate her life. We are all very lucky to be here on earth, to be a part of the Notre Dame family, to be able to wake up every morn­ing. Caitlin does not get another chance to live, but we do. We must live every day to the fullest. It can be gone in an instant. Let Caitlin's death not be in vain. At the very least, let it remind us to live.

The graduate community a different perspective 
A number of recent Letters to the Editor in The Observer have centered around the issue of whether or not graduate students should be included in the football ticket lot­tery and the Notre Dame experience. These commentaries have raised the deeper ques­tion of how graduate students fit into the Notre Danie community. In my opinion this is ultimately a question about the University's identity and mission. While it is true that Notre Dame has a unique under­graduate identity, this is only one facet of its richly textured identity as a university. Even this "unique" identity is dynamic, striving as we do for greater diversity with regard to race and ethnicity, gender, socioe­conomic class, religion, physical ability and scholarship. Diversity is enriched by our graduate students, who are, indeed, vital members of our community. In many instances, they are the first teachers and mentors that students encounter when they begin their undergraduate career at Notre Dame. 
Graduate students have contributed much to making the First Year of Studies the pre-eminent program that it is in the nation. Along with faculty members, gradu­ate students inspire their younger, under­graduate colleagues to pursue their dreams. They model what it means to be a scholar. Having jobs, spouses, children and homes with mortgages, they also model how they, as students, balance real lives. In his presidential inaugural address last year, University President Father John Jenkins spoke of the inclusive spirit that we must embody if we are to become a truly great university, saying that "We cannot be truly Catholic if we are exclusively Catholic." Provost Tom Burish echoed this belief in his address to the faculty last month, in which he emphasized the importance of fulfilling Notre Dame's potential for excellence as a graduate research institution. This implies, of course, that we cannot be a pre-eminent university if we do not include our graduate students as a valuable part of the Notre Dame community. Jenkins has also said, "Scholars in diverse disciplines pursue the same truth. Truths found in physics and biology do relate to those found in art, liter­ature and philosophy, and our common pursuit of truth must include conversations across disciplines." Our common pursuit of truth must also include conversations across cultures and across generations of students and faculty. We are all in this aca­demic enterprise together. 
Our distinctive Catholic mission is the University's strength. It is part of what accounts for the sense of community on campus. And it is this sense of community, its generosity of spirit, its hospitality, that draw both undergraduate and graduate students here in the first place. Granted, there are finite resources like football tick­ets, or on-campus housing or a number of other things. But if we are to embody the ideals of community, we cannot be posses­sive of the "Notre Dame experience" and all that it has to offer.

Celebrity loves make and break America's heart 
In the midst of the recent midterm elec­tions, an even more crucial and earth­shattering world event took place ­Britney and K-Fed ended their tumultuous and often "chaotic" marriage. No less than a week prior, long­time fan-favorite celebrity couple Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe decided to separate after seven years of marriage. When the public flag­bearers of love decide to call it quits, it's hard to imagine that true love could possibly exist in such a world. 
The Americ.an pub­lic looks to celebrities, especially movie stars, for the answers to all of life's major dilem­mas -what clothes to wear, cars to drive and most importantly how to sustain a relationship. Celebrity relationships have always been a hot topic to both hard-core celeb chasers as well as to the more casual voyeur. Very few things attract the atten­tion and hunger of the American public more than a celebrity relationship gone horribly wrong. 
The most recent heartbreaker came in the form of the Witherspoon-Phillippe split. The adorable and drama-free couple was much beloved by fans the world over. The young, attractive and family-oriented cou­ple was viewed as one of those steadfast 

Erin McGinn 
Assistant Scene Editor 
and ideal relationships that worn there to be emulated. Seven years later, it was 
over. 

No celebrity break-up has arguably been more painful in recent years than that of Jessica Simpson and Nick Laehey. Like Reese and Hyan, Nick and Jessica had been long adored by fans and had gar­nered a huge following. From their long and very public courtship to their televised wedding, Simpson and Lachey madn their living by loudly and publidy proclaiming their undying love for each other. 
Their show "Newlyweds," whkh aired on MTV for throe so~sons, firmly estab­lished them as the couple-to-bn among celebrities. Only three years into their marriage, they shocked their fans and general public alike when they liled for divorce. They were Hollywood's perfect couple, complete with their very own fami­ly Christmas special. Even they couldn't keep it together. 
While Nick and Jessica were the king and queen of America's homeeoming, Britney and K-Fed were the weird couple who reeked of pot and praeticed a little too much PDA. Attempting to mooch off of the "Newlyweds" cash cow, Britney and K-Fed had their own abomination of a reality show, "Britney & Kevin: Chaotic," that poorly displayed the couple and all of their married antics. While it was much less heartbreaking and tragic than the other splits, it nevertheless caught the eye of the American people as much, if not more, than the concurrent elections. 
Judging from these splits, it really is hard to keep believing in love. But for every celebrity couple that comes to a tragic demise, there is another couple springing up in passionate love-often times these passionate loves spring out of the ashes of a fallen couple. Were it not for the split of Brad and Jennifer, we would never have been bestowed with the won­der that is Brangelina. 
But who else embodies true love more than TomKat? Nothing screams true love still exists in the world quite like Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah's couch. With their Italian marriage on the horizon this weekend, it's impossible not to be in the mood for love. 

The recent journeys to splitsville may have soured the idea of love for most, but fortunately Tom and Katie are here with the opportunity to bring true love back to the American populace.

Jack Palance fondly remembered for classic roles 
Jack Palance was a man's man. He had the kind of cowboy gruffness that every kid who had ever watched a Western wished they could emulate -or, like their idol, ride off into the sunset themselves. 
He was unlike any other, and his dis­tinctive voice gave us villains from classics that range from the classic Western "Shane" to Tim Burton's "Batman" and all the way around to Curly and Duke in the "City Slickers" series. He was a giant among actors and matched his onscreen tough guy look with a real tough guy persona, having worked as a coal miner, a boxer and a student pilot during World War II. 
Born Volodymyr Palahniuk to a coal mining family of Ukrainian descent in western Pennsylvania. After working as a coal miner with his father, he began a boxing career. Fighting under t:he name Jack Brazzo, he recorded 12 knockouts before losing to future heavyweight contender Joe Baksi. This career, after a promising start, didn't pan out so Jack looked to other places and discovered a passion for drama. 
Attending Stanford University for drama and earning a B.A., his big break came when he landed the spot

as Marlon Brando's understudy for 'A Streetcar Named Desire." lie eventu­ally replaced the immortal Brando for this play, which led to his career on the silver screen. His first role was in 1950s "Panic in the Streets," which led to the biggest break of his career -starring as the villain Lester Blaine in the 1952 film noir, "Sudden Fear." This led to a nomination for an Academy Award in the best support­ing actor category. His star was shin­ing, as this was only his third screen appearance. He went on to play simi­lar villainous roles such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dracula and Attila tlw Hun. 
Throughout his career, he was gen­erally typecast as a villain, such as the iconic Jack Wilson in an Academy Award-nominated performance for "Shane" -:-and found it hard to find roles outside of' this type. 
In order to combat this, hn took the role of pompous Hollywood producer Jeremy Prokosch in .Jean-Lue Godard's artsy 1963 film "l.es Mepris." 
Jlowever, after receiving tlw same types of offers time al'ter time, Palance and his family movod to Switzerland in am attempt to divorsi­fy his repertoire. However, al'ter six years he retu_rned to the United States, claiming the Europeans were offering him the exact same roles he hoped to escape from in Hollywood. 
In his old age, never one to back down from a challenge, he took on the role of grizzled and curmudgeon­ly Curly. This satire on his prcvieous pt~rsona garnnrnd him yet another Oscar nomination, whieh he won. In one of the more famous moments in his life, Palanec, at the age of 73, performed one-armed pushups on stag1~ as part ol' his acceptance pieee. Still tht~ tough guy. 

Earlier gonerations may remember him for his roles as murderers in J'ilm noirs and evil gunslingers in Westerns, while tho younger genera­tions will remember his Boss Grissom in "Batman" and Curly from "City Slickers." llowever Palance is remembernd, he will always be revered as a singular figure who was able to elevate hims.elf over the poli­tics of Jlollywood. Just as tough in real life as he was on the screen, his presence will be sorely missed. His distinctive rasp and independent atti­tude will forever be placed in the upper echelons of Hollywood star­dom. 
You will be missed, Jack Palance, sorely missed.

DVD REVIEW 
Old boy, neW" tricks: Park's 2005 Korean thriller gets three-disc collector's edition 

By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 
Park Chan-wook's "Oldeuboi" ("Oidboy"), which was already released on DVD back in 2005, has been given the Collector's Edition treatment by Tartan video. The Korean film, already a cult classic, has increased in stature over the years, thanks in no small part to the original Tartan DVD release. 
Nominally, "Oldboy" is a revenge story, but a bizarre and warped one, filled with violent twists and unexpect­ed narrative shifts. Its basic plot involves Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), a man who is locked up by unseen forces for 15 years without knowing why. After his release, he sets off to discover who imprisoned him and why, only to discover a strange conspiracy involving his past. . 
Park infuses "Oldboy" with a light­ning-fast rhythm, which makes the film fly through its two-hour run-time. Audiences are riveted as the mystery unfolds, but Park is smart enough to make the journey as strange and satis­fying as the ultimate destination. 
Park's film is violent and often dis­turbing, but the director gets to the heart of his story, giving it a surprising emotional weight for a film of this type. There are several intense, relentless action sequences, all of which are well done -most notably, a long tracking shot in which Oh Dae-Su fights several cronies in an alley. Choi Min-sik gives an amazing performance as the protag­onist, especially in one infamous and shockingly effective scene in which... well. let's just say that animals were definitely harmed in the making of this movie. 
Tartan has gone the whole nine yards in its presentation of the new three-disc Collector's Edition of "Oldboy." There are a host of special features that are spread across the discs, though most of them are housed on the second. The picture has been cleaned up from the previous DVD and looks much improved, with better contrast and sig­nificantly clearer image quality. 
The audio is available in several mixes -6.1 DTS-ES and 5.1 Dolby Digital Korean mixes, and a 5.1 English dubbed version. The 6.1 DTS-ES is eas­ily the best of the mixes for those who have the proper equipment, as the sound in the action sequences practi­cally jump out of the speakers. The English dubbed version should be avoided at all costs, as the dubbing is not particularly great, and the sound mix takes a noticeable hit in atmos­phere. There are English subtitles available, which, while not perfect, are pretty good in their translations. 
The cream of the special features include commentaries from the direc­tor, cinematographer and cast, and sev­eral excellent "behind the scenes" doc­umentaries. There are also 10 deleted scenes with commentary, a featurette, a video diary from the movie shoot and (in a nice touch) the original Japanese graphic novel on which the film is based (translated into English). 
Most of the features are informative and interesting, though the third disc, which contains the video diary, is a bit much. "Oldboy" comes in a cool metal­lic tin, with a presentation that resem­bles HBO's "Band of Brothers" in its look and cover, which is a bit strange considering the huge differences in con­tent. 
"Oldboy" is a unique and bizarre film, and it represents a new peak in Korean cinema. While only a year old, it indi­cates a new and interesting direction for Park, who continues to outdo him­

.self with every picture. Although Tartan's origi­nal DVD was decent enough, the new three­disc collector's edition is essential for any fan of Park, "Oldboy" or Korean cinema in gen­eral.

Associated Press 

Don Strock has resigned as coach at Florida International, one of only two winless Division 1-A programs this season and a program still dealing with effects of a sideline-clearing brawl against Miami last month. 
Strock submitted his res­ignation Wednesday, uni­versity officials said. He will coach the Golden Panthers' final three games of the season. 
"Now is a good time to move on to other chal­lenges," Strock said. "I wish FlU every success." 
Reached Wednesday 
evening, Strock would not say if the brawl that marred Florida International's game against Miami Oct. 14 was a major factor in his decision to step aside. He would only say that he would reveal the reasons behind the decision before FlU's practice Thursday afternoon. 
"''m doing everything then," Strock told The Associated Press. 
A total of 31 players -18 from FlU, 13 from Miami ­were sanctioned for their role in the fight, which took place in the third quarter of the Hurricanes' 35-0 victo­ry. The Golden Panthers suspended 16 players indef­initely, plus kicked two oth­ers off the team but allowed them to keep their scholar­ships. 
FlU reinstated three of the suspended players last week before the team's 35­0 loss to Louisiana-Monroe. More players could return by season's end, university officials said. 
Strock is the only head coach in FlU's brief football history. The former Miami Dolphins quarterback was hired as director of football operations in 1999, then was named coach Sept. 13, 2000. 
Pete Garcia, who was hired from Miami as FlU's athletic director last month, said the university was appreciative for Strock's role in starting the program and helping it reach Division 1-A status. 
"The role of the founding coach of a university foot­ball program is extremely challenging and requires very hard work and dedica­tion," Garcia said in a state­ment released by the school. "We are grateful to coach Strock for laying the foundation for our pro­gram." 
FlU was 5-6 in 2002, its first season under Strock. It went 5-6 again last season -sparking hope that this season could be a break­through for the program. 
IN BRIEF 

Professional poker player arrested for running gambling ring 
NEW YORK -It was the high-tech key to a massive, illegal gambling kingdom: a laptop computer that authorities say was owned by a pro­fessional poker player named James Giordano. 
Giordano, who rarely let the com­puter out of his sight, unknowingly took a gamble earlier this year by leaving it behind while attending a wedding, police said Wednesday. 
But in the three hours he and his wife were away from their Long Island hotel room, New York Police Department investigators armed with a search warrant and computer expertise sneaked in, found the laptop on a desk and made a digital copy of the hard drive before the couple returned. 
The covert operation on June 15 helped unlock a sophisticated billion­dollar-a-year gambling scheme that rivaled casino sports books, authori· ties said at a news conference . 
AP Poll board member removed after mistaking win for loss 
OKLAHOMA CITY -A voter for The Associated Press college football poll was removed from the poll· board Wednesday because he mis­takenly thought Oklahoma had lost to Texas Tech and voted the Sooners lower in this week's rankings. 
Jim Kleinpeter of The Times­Picayune of New Orleans said he tried to find the score of the Oklahoma game, but was unable to do so. 
He said he was in the press box at the Alabama-LSU game "and I was asking about different teams, think­ing about the poll the next day. ... I thought somebody told me that Oklahoma was losing to Texas Tech at some point. And I asked after the LSU game was over, 'Did Oklahoma win?' Somebody said Oklahoma lost," Kleinpeter said. 
The Sooners rallied from a 14­point deficit to beat Texas Tech 34­24. 
Youth coach possibly facing charges after attacking referee 
CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas ­Authorities are considering charges against a Pee Wee football coach who was caught on videotape attacking a referee after being told to stop curs­ing on the sidelines in front of his 5­and 6-year~old players, police said. 
The amateur video of the Nov. 4 incident shows the coach charging onto a field and tackling the 18-year­old referee, who police Capt. John Houston said was briefly knocked unconscious. 
"The coach had been warned sever­al times about cursing on the side­lines. When the referee ejected him from the game, that's when he rushed him," Houston said Tuesday. 
A crowd of parents ran onto the field and surrounded the pair, he said. 
Investigators plan to meet with Nueces County prosecutors to deter­mine if the coach and at least one other man should face charges, Houston said.

Golden Eagles soar over favored Jayhawks 
Ranked Kentucky, North Carolina squads get victories 
Associated Press 
LAWHENCE, Kan. Marchello Vealy and his Oral Roberts teammates went into Allen Fieldhouse with one goal. 
"We wanted to come out and shock the world tonight," Vealy said, "and we did it." 
Vealy hit his first seven 3­point shots and Oral Hoberts outplayed No. 3 Kansas the whole way, stunning the ragged Jayhawks 78-71 Wednesday night. 
"It may be the biggest regu­lar-season win in school histo­ry," coach Scott Sutton said. "Our trainer has been here over 30 years and said it was the highest-ranked team we've ever beat." 
Vealy, a 6-7 sophomore who shot 1-for-13 on 3-pointers last season, finished 7 -for-8 from behind the arc. His only miss came on his last heave, after the Golden Eagles had thor­oughly taken command. 

The Golden Eagles (1-1) seemed quicker, more aggres­sive and better organized than the favored Jayhawks (1-1) from start to finish. 
After trailing by as many as 10 points in the first half, the Big 12 favorites got as close as three. 
But Ken Tutt hit OHU's 11th 3­pointer and added two free throws in the final minute. Caleb Green, a two-time Mid­Continent Conference player of the year, added 20 points and 11 rebounds. 
"That team was a hungry team we played tonight," Kansas coach Bill Self said. "Caleb led the charge. I thought when we stopped them in the second half, I thought it was more their missing than us

stopping them." 
Kansas cut its deficit to 72-69 on Russell Hobinson's free throw with one minute lert before Tutt sealed Kansas' 11th loss in its last 176 games at home. 
Tutt and Adam Liberty each had 12 points for the two-time defending conference champi­ons. 
''I've never seen anything like this tonight," Sutton said. "It was shocking at one point, but at the end of the day, it's a bas­ketball game. Everybody has to put their shoes on the same way." 
Sutton agreed that Kansas, which missed easy shots and was a miserable 11-for-21 from the foul line, had a tough game. 
"They didn't have the best of nights. l don't know if that was due to us or just great players having off nights," he said. ''I'll bet you they regroup." 
Kansas got 22 points from freshman Darrell Arthur. Julian Wright, a preseason favorite for Big 12 player of the year, blew layups on two consecutive pos­sessions as Kansas tried vainly to regain the lead in the second half. 
No. 22 Kentucky 57, Miami (Ohio) 46 
Kentucky found a way to win -plus a young, bona fide shot­blocker in the process. 
Freshman forward Perry Stevenson swattod seven shots and No. 22 Kentucky scored the final 10 points of the game to pull away from Miami of Ohio Wednesday night in its season opener. 
"lie gave us what we need­ed," forward Bobby Perry said of the 6-foot-9 freshman. ''I've seen him block shots and play the way he did tonight all of the time." 

Despite Stevenson's play, things got uncomfortable for the Wildcats late. Two free throws by Nathan Peavy cut the Kentucky edge to 47-46 with four minutes left -leaving the Hupp Arena crowd a little nerv­ous. 
"You always have that going through your mind," said junior Hamel Bradley, who made his first career regular season start at point guard. 'This is college basketball and a lot of crazy things happen." 
But Bradley hit a jumper in traffic and Handolph Morris made two free throws, then scored from the post to stretch it back to a seven-point deficit. 
"We'll learn a lot from this game," Kentucky coach Tubby Smith said. 
Joe Crawford led the Wildcats with 18 points. Mon·is added a double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds, all on defense. 
No. 2 North Carolina 73, Winthrop 66 

North Carolina eoach Roy Williams finally saw what he was looking for from the Tar Heels in the seeond half Wednesday night against Winthrop. 
Tyler Hansbrough had 20 points and 10 rebounds, and No. 2 North Carolina rallied to beat Winthrop in the NIT Season Tip-Off. 
"When somebody hits you, you have a decision to make," Williams said. "We have to have some toughness and we had no toughness in the first half." 
Wayne Ellington added 13 points and Brandan Wright scored 12 for the Tar Heels, who overcame 25 points from the Eagles' Torrell Martin to advance to the semifinals next week in New York against the winner of a late game Wednesday between Gonzaga and Baylor. 
Williams watched in disbelief in the first half as Winthrop hit open 3-pointers, grabbed nearly every loose ball and built a 12­point lead. "We were walking around letting people kick our butts and it wasn't making any difference to us," Williams said. "It was a sorry attitude we had at that point." 
North Carolina (2-0). down nine with under 17 minutes to play, went to their highly regarded freshmen class to come back. 
Ellington's back-to-hack buck­ets inside and Ty Lawson's 3­pointer in a 9-0 run tied it at 45.

MLB 
Girardi, Leyland named game's top managers 
Skippers both piloted young teams to good records, turnarounds 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Sometime soon, Joe Girardi will go looking for another job in a major league dugout. And when he does, he'll have a Manager of the Year award at the top of his resume. 
Six weeks after he was fired by Florida, Girardi won the NL honor Wednesday for keeping the rookie-laden Marlins in con­tention nearly all season. Jim Leyland took the AL award after a quick turnaround with the Detroit Tigers. 
A rookie skipper himself, Girardi beat out Willie Randolph of the New York Mets by a comfortable margin to become the first Manager of the Year with a losing record. 
"I don't know if vindication is a good word, just because as a manager, you want to manage," Girardi said. 
He received 18 of 3 2 first­place votes and totaled 111 points in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Randolph got eight first-place votes and 81 points. 
"It's nice that people who watch the game every day understood what we accom­plished," Girardi said, adding he wasn't particularly surprised to win. "We had a lot of good things happen." 
Leyland turned around the long-moribund Tigers in his first year with the team, leading them to the World Series and their first winning season since 1993. He received 19 of 28 first­place votes and 118 points to top Minnesota's Ron Gardenhire, who was listed first on nine ballots and totaled 93 points. 
"I knew that we had some­thing here. I thought it would take longer than it did. This team started believing," Leyland said. "We had good players going into spring train­ing, but we didn't have a very good team. We made ourselves a good team and that's some­thing I'm very proud of." 
Playing 22 rookies, Girardi guided the Marlins to a 78-84 finish and had them in the play­off race until a late-September fade -a surprisingly competi­tive performance for a team that was expected to lose at least 100 games. 
Florida had a $15 million opening day payroll, the lowest in the major leagues by more than $20 million. 
Still, he was fired two days after the season ended follow­ing a rift with owner Jeffrey Loria. Girardi has since agreed to rejoin the New York Yankees' broadcast booth, rather than seek another managing job. 
"I don't believe in this case perception is reality," he said. "I 
wanted it to work out but it 
never got worked out, for what­
ever reason.... We move on to 
bigger and better things." 
After the announcement, the 
Marlins were ready with a 
statement. 
"We are pleased for Joe and 
we wish him well," the team 
said. 
Girardi, who succeeded 
Randolph as Joe Torre's bench 
coach with the Yankees in 2005, 
is the second Manager of the 
Year to be fired that year. The 
other was Baltimore's Davey 
Johnson, the AL winner in 
1997. 
"To rehash that, I don't think that does anyone any good," Girardi said. "Obviously, I'm not there, and I don't know how they feel about it. A manager ·wants to manage. I didn't want 
to leave Florida." 
Girardi was interested in the 
opening with his hometown 
Chicago Cubs, but they hired 
Lou Piniella this offseason. The 
former catcher also interviewed 
with the Washington Nationals, 
but pulled out of the running 
before they chose Manny Acta. 
"There's no secret to what I'm 
looking for. I really want to 
manage again because I love 
it," Girardi said. "It has to be 
right not only for me, but for my 
family.... I believe my opportu­
nity will come again." 
The 61-year-old Leyland 
appears firmly entrenched in 
Motown after winning his third 
Manager of the Year award.

NHL 

Pens' Malkin to stay in America 
Judge clears Russian forward to remain in NHL after dispute 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Evgeni Malkin was cleared to stay with the Pittsburgh Penguins after a fed­eral judge denied a demand by his former Russian club that he be yanked from the NHL. 
Metallurg Magnitogorsk, a Russian Super League team, claims that Malkin is under contract in his native country. The club sought a preliminary injunction that would have banned the forward from play­ing for the Penguins until the matter is resolved. 
But the ruling Wednesday by 
U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska clears the way for Malkin, a star rookie with Penguins, and minor leaguers Andrei Taratukhin of the Calgary Flames and Alexei Mikhnov of the Edmonton Oilers to stick with the NHL franchises. 
Led by Metallurg Magnitogorsk, Russian clubs sued in October claiming that the NHL broke U.S. antitrust law and improperly interfered in their business affairs by sign­ing away players who were still under contract. 
The deal with the International Ice Hockey Federation calls for the NHL to pay a $200,000 fee when it signs European players, but Russian hockey officials declined to sign the agreement on the grounds that they were unfairly compensated for top talent. 
Since then, the world's two top hockey leagues have been at odds. 
In August, the NHL told its clubs they were free to sign contracts with Russian hockey players already under contract. 
Malkin, 20, had just signed a one-year contract with 
READY TO POUNCE 

Metallurg Magnitogorsk when he abruptly left camp to join the Penguins this fall. 
In retaliation, the Russian elubs asked the U.S. courts to issue an injunction benching the players in North Ameriea and returning them to their old teams. 
Preska ruled that the Russians hadn't met the stan­dard for a preliminary injunc­tion. To do so, she said, they would have had to prove that the players' absence from the Russian league was causing their former teams irreparable harm. 
The courts have generally found that the loss of a star ath­lete can indeed constitute such a harm, but Preska said that in this ease, the Russian clubs appeared to be more concerned with wresting larger player transfer fees from the NHL than maintaining their competitive­ness. 
"These cases were always about money," Preska said. "The only issue is how much." 
The ruling doesn't stop the case for good, but all but ensures that Malkin, Taratukhin and Mikhnov will remain with their NIIL teams. 
"Obviously we are very disap­pointed," said Alexander Berkovich, the attorney for the Russian clubs. 
He rejected the notion that the dispute was all about money. 
"They need the best players," he said, "Regrettably, it's not going to happen in this case." 
NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in a written statement that he hoped the ruling would persuade the Russian clubs to "discontinue their strategy of litigation," and engage in "good faith negotiations" about the future system for player trans­fers. 
In the absence of an agree­ment, the NHL has maintained that Russian labor law allows players there to quit with two weeks notice.

Damage to forward's knee 'more significant' than originally thought 
Associated Press 
DENVER -Nuggets forward Kenyon Martin will miss the rest of the season because of a bad right knee. 
Martin had arthroscopic sur­gery Wednesday, and the team said the operation "revealed more significant damage" than originally thought. 
Martin has five years and more than $66 million left on his contract. He played in two games this season,

declared himself healthy for the first time since undergoing microfracture surgery on his left knee 18 months ago. 
He was taped up and ready to play against the New York Knicks on Nov. 8 when a team doctor went into the locker room minutes before tip-off and sent him for tests on his swollen right knee. 
"Right now I'm at a loss for words, you know what I'm say­ing? I worked my butt off in training camp. For this to hap­pen now, I'm down in the dumps," Martin told The Associated Press that night after an MRI revealed another

Martin was limited to a career-low 56 games last sea­son after surgery on his left knee. He was suspended in the playoffs for his tirade at the coaching staff after his playing time was held down against the Los Angeles Clippers. 
He and coach George Karl patched up their relationship, and after training camp Martin bolstered their

the offseason with the addition of Joe Smith and Reggie Evans, to go along with the return of Nene. 
Eduardo Najera said last week that the Nuggets would miss Martin's powerful pres­ence. 
"It's very difficult to lose him. He's been a leader and he sets the tone with his aggressive play and personality," Najera said. "It will take some time for us to adjust.... We all have a chance to get more minutes. Joe hasn't played that many min­utes, and Evans hasn't either. I think that Martin is irreplace­able, but combined, all our big guys can do a pretty good job."

GMs consider using replay 
Blue Jays near deal with Thomas; Mets and Padres agree to trade 
Associated Press 
NAPLES, Fla. -When it comes to instant replay, base­ball general managers want to look it over. 
GMs plan to talk about the topic some more, and perhaps make recommendations in the future, even they know com­missioner Bud Selig is against the having replays aid umpires' decisions. 
"There is sutlicient interest in it that it really warrants fur­ther discussion," baseball sen­ior vice president Joe Garagiola Jr. said Wednesday at the GMs' annual meetings. "There's no specific action item at the moment. We just want to keep talking about the different ways it could come into play and just keep kind of refining our thinking on the topie." 
GMs have repeatedly dis­cussed the topic but know replays an~n't likely to be used while Selig is in charge. Two years ago, GMs split 15-15 on a vote to further consider the use of instant replay. 
"The commissioner's views on instant replay are well known but I also know he respects the body here," Garagiola said. "So it's an important topic to continue to discuss." 
Chicago Cubs manager Lou Piniella, whose been known to speak his mind to umpires, doesn't think there's a need for replays. 
"Umpires do a really nice job," he said. "I think that's the way baseball has been played since inception. I don't see any reason to change it."

Philadelphia reached a preliminary agreement on a two-year contract with third baseman Wes Ilelms. 


While big-names clients are being discussed with teams in this early stage of free agency -players such as Alfonso Soriano and Barry Zito -no deals appear close. 
GMs did approve several changes. Starting next year, a team can change its postseason roster up until 10 a.m. on the day its lirst game is played, not when it is scheduled. That came in response to the post­ponement of the NL champi­onship series opener between the Mets and Cardinals. 
Starting next year, tie games will be a thing of the past -if a regulation game is tied when stopped by rain, and it will be suspended and resumed at the point where it was interrupted. That change was approved last year but not ratified by the players' assoeiation, which can delay rules modifications for one year but can't block them. 
GMs didn't approve a propos­al to have games suspended that were not yet regulation ­in other words, if there is a rainout after two innings, the game still will be wiped out and replayed from the start. 
In a rule change that must be approved by owners and the union, umpires proposed that weekends count for waivers during spring training. 
Baseball also revealed a number of statistics on umpires. The Questec comput­er system, used in 11 ball­parks, said 94.91 percent of ball-strike calls were correct, up from 94.20 percent in 2005. That represents a decline from 
8.65 to 7.64 missed pitches per game. 
Ejections dropped from 227 to 218 this year, and warnings fell from 79 to 68. There were 30 hit batters after warnings, of which 12 pitchers were ejected.

Im. " 
When Condra found out Van Guilder had shared the tape with everyone that would watch, he started to return fire. 
"He's so funny," Condra jok­ingly yelled. "He's the funniest guy on the team ... funniest guy." 
But whether Van Guilder is the funniest guy on the team or not, the junior from Minnesota is leading the No. 5 Irish in goals (eight), points (14) and shot per­centage (.333). That's a big step for a player who said he received no offers from major schools until Irish assistant coach Andy Slaggert stumbled upon him through junior defenseman Luke Lucyk, who is now spending a year back in juniors before returning to Notre Dame. 
"First of all, I wasn't very good -so there weren't too many choices [of schools]," Van Guilder said. "I owe a lot to Luke Lucyk, who was already com­mitted to come here. Coach Slaggert came to watch him play, and I was playing with Lucyk at Tri-City [Storm of the United State Hockey League) and I was playing pretty well. He saw me play and I had a pretty good game." 
And this season, a year after being named the team's most improved player and finishing the season third on the Irish in scoring, Van Guilder has been the biggest offensive threat, tying his goal total from all of 2005-06 for the 8-1-1 Irish. Seven of his eight goals last year carne on special teams -six on the power play and one short­handed, but he has only one power play goal this season. 
"A big emphasis from the coaches this summer was for me being more aggressive, especial­ly on five-on-five," Van Guilder said. "I didn't score as much five-on-five last year, it was mostly power play." 
Irish associate head coach Paul Pooley said Van Guilder put the work in over the summer, using the early morning hours to improve and evolving into a sup­porting leader behind the cap­tains and seniors. 
"He's always had it," Pooley said of Van Guilder's scoring touch. "I think he's just shooting more. He has a good shot -he scored a great goal against Boston College. He rolled it up on the power play and ripped it top shelf. And I think that's one of the things about scoring -is when they shoot the puck and score, it gives them more confi­dence to continue to do it." 
Van Guilder has clicked well with his linemates -senior left wing and 2005-06 leading Irish goal-scorer Josh Sciba, and sen­ior right wing and captain T.J. Jindra. 
"T.J. plays more of an up-and­down game, where he's more defensive-minded," Sciba said. "But Van Guilder and I have a little more tendency toward offense, and I think that we feed off each other. Van Guilder's ere­ative down low, and I'm able to open up and let him make that pass to me, try to finish my chances. So I think that we all add something to that line." 
Part of Van Guilder's success and his evolution from barely­scouted recruit to offensive pow­erhouse on one of the nation's top-ranked teams can be credit­ed to his ability to stay healthy. He holds the record for most consecutive games played by an active.Irish player with 84. 
"It's kind of being blessed, just not getting bad injuries -little nicks, bumps and bruises every­where," Van Guilder said. "Our trainer [Kevin Ricks) comes up with some interesting pads we slap around our ankles or wher­ever we need them. He does a great job of keeping us on the ice." 
And Van Guilder will continue to be on the ice this Friday at the Joyce Center for the CCHA grudge match with No. 4 Michigan State. Although he said this is a big game, he gets anxious every week for Friday to come -especially on Sunday when the game is farthest away. 
"Hopefully we'll have a lot big­ger ones later in this season, but this is huge right now," he said. "We're going to see where we are at, because this is one of the top teams in the country." 
By the time it reaches game­day, Van Guilder said he cannot wait to play and likes to get to the rink "quite early." He has a detailed pre-game routine of taping and waxing his stick. 
"I [start) on the heel -not all the way down the heel, a little bit off -[go) all the way down over the toe, cut it off with the scissors then soft wax over the whole thing. 

"[The tape's) always white. Danglers use white tape, that's what my high school coach told me." 
If the colored wax he chose doesn't work in the first period, he'll change it over during the intermission. But if that still doesn't work? 
"That's when you just have to battle and make something hap­pen with the color wax you got," he said with a laugh. 
Van Guilder will face one of his toughest tests of the year this weekend, going up against Spartans goaltender Jeff Lerg ­last year's CCHA rookie of the year and tournament MVP. In the meantime, however, Van Guilder and the Irish will try to keep loose and maybe show a few more Condra highlight reels. 
When asked if he had any favorite moments in his time with the Irish, he started laugh­ing. 
"I think it may have happened 10 minutes ago, watching film of Erik Condra," he said with a smile. "We have a blast."

he finished it. That's what a big time player does." 
The play started just two minutes before halftime when sophomore forward Bright Dike received a pass at the top of the box. With his back to the goal, Dike flicked the ball into the path of an onrushing Lapira, who outran his defender to the ball and -despite shooting from almost at the end line ­buried a low shot in the far corner of the net. 
"I don't how that shot went in," Lapira said. "I didn't have much of an angle. I think I got a little bit lucky." 
The Irish were fortunate the score was still tied at zero when Lapira scored his goal. Notre Dame, playing its first game in 18 days, was clearly outplayed by the Flames in the first 10 minutes of the game. 
Only three minutes in, Illinois-Chicago midfielder Baggio Husidic ripped a shot off a cross, which rebounded back off the Irish crossbar. Two minutes later, Flames forward Eric Cervantes unleashed from 25 yards and appeared to have Notre Dame keeper Chris Cahill beat -but the shot sailed just wide of the goal. 
"Maybe that was your answer," said Irish coach Bobby Clark, referring to whether Notre Dame would be rusty after the long layoff. "We hadn't played a game for 18 days, and it took the boys about 10 minutes to adjust to the pace of the game." 
After weathering the initial 

storm from Illinois-Chicago, Notre Dame proceeded to rain down shots on Flames keeper Jovan Bubonja. In the 20th minute, senior forward Justin McGeeney received a through ball from midfielder Ian Etherington, putting him in on the keeper, but his shot was deflected out for a corner kick by Bubonja. 
Four minutes later, senior midfielder Nate Norman thought he had opened the scoring, bending a low shot toward the corner of the net, but a diving Bubonja again denied the Irish. 
"They won the battle for the first 10 minutes, but after that we quickly got our act together and started taking control of the game," senior co-captain Greg Dalby said. "We created a lot of chances after those first 10 minutes." 
On the evening, Notre Dame out-shot Illinois-Chicago 18 to nine -a high number of chances given the rainy condi­tions. As the game progressed, the field became more and more of a mess, with players struggling to keep their footing. 
"In these conditions, that was a superb game," Clark said. "There was only one goal, but there were quite a few chances. [Illinois-Chicagol maybe didn't have great chances, but they got close enough to make my heart skip a few beats." 
With their win, the Irish will advance to play at No. 7 Maryland -last year's NCAA champion -who dispatched St. John's 2-0 Wednesday.
