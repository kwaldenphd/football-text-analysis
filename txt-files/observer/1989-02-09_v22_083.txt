A bathroom ritual involving three students burning candles in a school restroom prompted the principal to suspend the students and call the police. "We're not sure if this is an isolated case or if it's something we should be worried about," said Burr Oak (Mich.) Junior-Senior High School Principal Robert Peters. "We don't know if the girls were just experimenting with something or trying something that they learned from someone else."

Winter in South Bend is a chi IIi ng experience 
If I had any sense, and any sort of funds, I would be in the Bahamas right now. -...any place but South Bend--especially in mid-February. 
O.K., I admit it-the snow sure was pretty while I was walking home Friday night and then when I woke up on Saturday morning. It even proved to be a pleasant diversion while I was pretending to study later that afternoon. 
But by Sunday, let's face it, it was getting old--and fast. 
When I first visited Notre Dame, the tour guide must have inadvertently left out the fact that I was visiting on one of the 10 sunny days of the year, and that temps in the sub-zero range in February were the rule rather than the ex­ception. 
There's something very wrong when you wake up in the morning and are tempted to cut classes, not because you didn't finish a philos­ophy paper, but because it's too cold to treck all the way from P.W. to the ROTC Building under blizzard conditions with a wind chill fac­tor of 20 below. 
And for those of us who are intrepid enough to actually brave the elements in the never­endi.ng quest for truth and knowledge, we must suffer with eternally runny noses, coughs, sore throats, and sore muscles (from taking all those tense little baby steps in an attempt to prevent ourselves from slipping on those oh-so-well­paved walkways). 
Ah. .. winter in South Bend. 
You may think, "Sure this week is bad, but it certainly won't last." 
Don't bet on it. Permafrost tends to hang around a little while longer--just a little. Think of the prospects: If this cruel lashing of Arctic air keeps up, we might be able to enjoy this lovely snow and ice well into April and May. Ice fishing could replace basketball and hockey as winter spectator sports on campus. 
We would be able to study for spring finals because we wouldn't be tempted to sunbathe. And wouldn't the University be happy with all those 4.0's? They may even decide to declare an ''academic winter,'' stretching from late Au­gust to early May. Of course they wouldn't need to consult with the student body first, after all, it's "for our own good." The possibilities are endless. 
Just nothing like those winters in South Bend. 
'Tis the season when newspapers and magazines are jam-packed with advertise­ments, and the radio and television provide a sensory onslaught of pursuasive jingles and ex­otic film clips in a mass attempt to convince

us that we really can't deal with the North anymore, and NEED to head off to South Padre, the Cayman Isles, or Ft. Lauderdale. 
Picture yourself right now, lounging on the beach, margarita in hand, the sun beating down turning your skin a deep bronze. Volleyball to the left of you, sand castles to your right, and there you are--no goal in life but to look cool in your mirrored shades, and finish your drink before it melts. 
What a deal. And it's only $199 away... 
Love those South Bend winters. 
Creature comforts, such as being moderately warm, are for the weak. Real men and women can take whatever Mother Nature can dish out. They not only can withstand the cold, they love it. 
A number of my friends are Colorado-bound for spring break. They think it's fun to spend two days in a car, and then another four freezing to death on top of a snow-covered mountain, risking life and limb in the name of sport. They are a bunch of "those cold-weather types." 
Well, I'm not. 
Snow is fine if it's Saturday night and I've got nothing better to do than sit in front of my fireplace with my cat and some hot cocoa. 
But let's face it, this is the real world. My Amex is overdrawn, my car is in New York, and there are no mountains around the 'Bend.

Speaker focuses on working women 
By RON SEVERINO 
News Staff 
The issue of women in the 
workplace and its effects on 
men was discussed Wednesday 
in a gender studies lecture by 
Heidi Hartmann, director of 
the Institute for Women's 
Policy Research in Washing­
ton, D.C. 
The lecture, part of a series 
sponsored by the economics 
and sociology departments, 
focused on women's rise in the 
workplace and the problems 
that must be solved to bring 
about a more equal status be­
tween men and women at home 
as well as in in the workplace. 
Hartmann began by citing 
reasons as to why women are 
becoming "more and more au­
tonomous today than in years 
past." 
The most obvious reason, she 
said, was because of economic 
necessity, as the average real 
income of men (inflation­
adjusted) has fallen steadily 
over the last 10 to 20 years. 
A second reason she gave 
was women's new self­
sufficiency. "Women want 
more control of their economic 
destiny," said Hartmann. 
More women now must sup­
port themselves and their families due to the rising divorce rate, and many young -women live independently for some years, according to 
Hartmann. 
Thirdly, Hartmann said, as a 
result of the American eco­
nomy, more jobs have opened up for women, especially in white-collar fields. 
Hartmann said the main 
problem still lies in the dis­
crepancy of incomes between 
men and women. 
The average income of all full-time working women is presently just 65 percent of the average income of all full-time male workers. The reason for this is not because men are paid more than women for the same occupation, but because women occupy more lower­salaried, non-managerial type jobs than men. 
The solution that Hartmann strongly embraces is compara­ble worth, whereby salaries would be determined not by the basic principles of supply and demand, but by the skill and effort required by a given job gauged against other jobs. 
Hartmann believes new legislation such as comparable worth and affirmative ac­tion-equal opportunity employ­ment are necessary in achiev­ing equality in the workplace. However, she said, "There was very little effort on the part of the Reagan Administration to assist women in the economy." 
Hartmann then turned to the problem of child care and working mothers. 
Fifty percent of all women return to the workforce within a year of giving birth to a child, according to Hartmann. Hartmann said the problem lies mainly in men's failure to pick up the slack of household duties as women take on more

responsibilities in the workplace. 
One statistic showed that married men work on average about seven hours a week at home, while married women work 25-45 hours a week at home. 
A solution to the child care issue, according to Hartmann, would be to pass new legisla­tion such as the Act for Better Child Care, which would appro­priate $2.1 billion to public health care. Hartmann said she supports "the public education of men regarding household re-assistant professor of econom­sponsibilities," which brought ics and organizer of the lecture a definite rise of laughter from series. the gentlemen in the auditorium.

not deal in rumor after rumor,'' Bush said. 
Meanwhile, White House counsel and chief ethics ad­viser C. Boyden Gray pre­sented the FBI report to Nunn and Sen. John Warner of Vir­gmta, the Senate panel's ranking Republican. The White House said it was "standard practice" for the White House counsel's office to "carry such reports to the hill." 
But it also appeared to be a move to appease Nunn, who on Tuesday had expressed irrita­tion that the White House had briefed committee Republicans and not him. 
The administration had been pushing for a vote this week, but dropped that after Nunn and Warner met with Bush Tuesday night. 
"I told the president frankly that I have serious concerns, and I also stated that if a vote was held immediately as some have urged, I would vote no be­cause of these concerns," Nunn told reporters. The second­ranking Democract on the committee, Sen. James Exon of Nebraska, also said he could not vote in favor of Tower until the FBI completes its investi­gation. 
At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the main new allegation "relates to Senator Tower's ac­tivities while he was in the Sen­ate." 

Crash 
continued from page 1 
It had been chartered by the Dominican firm Dominair by a consortium of six Italian travel agencies. 
Portuguese TV said an anonymous caller to the newsroom claimed responsibil­ity for the crash on behalf of an organization called the Brigada Terrorista Interna­tional (International Terrorist Brigade). 
Police said they knew of no group by that name and suspected the claim was a hoax. 
Witnesses said jetliner's wreckage still burned on Pico Alto five hours after the crash. 
LUSA said the first alarm of the crash was given by a resi­dent of Santa Barbara. 
The pilot radioed Santa Maria Airport control tower three minutes before the crash but did not report anything wrong, LUSA quoted an uni-

dentified civil aviation official as saying. 
The agency said the control tower then tried repeatedly to contact the plane without suc­cess. 
Earlier unconfirmed reports said the pilot had requested a runway be cleared for an emer­gency landing. 
The jet was scheduled to make a refueling stop in the Azores, a chain of islands west of Portugal. Santa Maria is about 750 miles west of Por­tugal. 
The U.S. federal Aviation Ad­ministration reported fog in the area with visibility of five miles below 500 feet and scattered clouds at 500 feet. 
The passengers were "middle-income Italians flying to a sun resort with great beaches" on a package put to­gether by Flamingo Tours of Bergamo, said A. Pittman, president of Independent Air in Smyrna, Ga.

Jack Barker, a spokesman for the FAA, said that was not excessive. 
"If properly maintained, there should not be a problem because of hours or number of cycles," he said. "Other aircraft involved in the news have had as much as 50,000 cycles, a great many more."

doesn't do that, nor does some­one like Champion products," Garrison said. 
Kaesebier said that the Uni­versity filed suit against Umbrella Graphics several days before the Jan. 13 action, "seeking legal relief and dama­ges." A temporary restraining order was obtained by the Uni­versity to "stop (Umbrella Graphics) from selling (unlicensed products) until the suit is settled. It also allowed us to seize his inventory to be certain he complied (with the order)," Kaesebier said. 
Garrison said he believed that the University was just making an example of his firm. He noted that "bootleggers" came to South Bend following Notre Dame's Jan. 2 Fiesta Bowl victory "attempting to sell inferior products, out for pure profit." These venders set up on street corners around South Bend to peddle their products, Garrison said. "The University never attempted to do anything to these bootleg­gers." 
Garrison said he believes this legal action was taken against his firm in part because he was easy to locate. 
Kaesebier said the Univer­sity welcomed the publicity. "We do intend for the publicity to let people know we're serious about protecting our trademarks," Kaesebier said. She added that she believed the majority of the publicity was intentionally generated by Garrison, not by the Univer­sity. 
"The only recourse we've had has been the press, be­cause of the relative power of the two of us versus the Uni­versity. We just don't have the resources or money to take on the University," Garrison said. 
Kaesebier said the Univer­sity was currently pursuing the legal suit against Umbrella Graphics, and she could not comment on the suit until it was settled. "What we do with Mr. Garrison's stock will be deter­mined after the suit is settled." 
Garrison said he did not like 
the way the entire matter was 
handled. "We never thought we 
were doing anything wrong," 
he said. "We never had anyth­
ing but a good rapport with the 
University before this... I'm 
just bewildered by the whole 
thing." 
The University's action has affected the way Umbrella Graphics operates, Garrison said. "This cost us a lot of face," he said. "We have to wonder if we can put an 'ND' on anything anyone brings in here any more." 
"There's no way to assess the damage to our business," Gar­rison said. "It could very well cost us the business." 

Trademarks held on words, 1 symbols depicting University 
By MATT GALLAGHER Senior Staff Reporter 
Notre Dame owns the trademark to many words and symbols related to the University, and it has developed a strict licensing policy to protect those trademarks. 
Carol Kaesebier, assistant general counsel to the Uni­versity, said Notre Dame owns the trademark to the following words and sym­bols: 
"University 
of Notre Dame" 

"Notre 
Dame" 

"Fighting 
Irish" 

The 
Leprechaun 

The 
University Seal 

The 
Official Class Ring 

The 
Golden Dome and others. 


The University licenses the use of these trademarks to various manufacturers, Kaesebier said. "The majority of licenses go to manufacturers to license and sell products they produce," Kaesebier said. "The products must have that manufacturer's name on it. In other words, they can't just use a T -shirt made by Haynes, for example, and put a golden dome on it." 
Kaesebier said the Univer­sity attempts to regulate the quality of the products it al­lows to use the various trademarks. "There are no restrictions on the (licensed) products, so long 
as they have the qualities we're looking for," she said. 
The University receives a royalty of 7 112 percent of total sales of the products it licenses, Kaesebier said. 
Kaesebier said the Univer­sity makes an active at­tempt to enforce its exclu­sive trademark rights, because the rights to these trademarks can be lost if the University does not enforce them. 
In mid-January, the Uni­versity took legal action against a Mishawaka retail store, Umbrella Graphics, for violating Notre Dame's trademark rights. 
"We have also had other cases of taking legal action against retailers. Most just haven't been as publicized,'' Kaesebier said. She said that legal action had been taken against other local retailers, most recently about two years ago. 
Such legal action takes the form of a legal suit filed by the University against the alleged violator. She declined to comment on spe­cific penalties for trademark infringement. 
Student organizations operate under separate licensing arrangements, Kaesebier said. "Students are allowed to use (Notre Dame) trademarks for stu­dent organizations, so long as they go through the proper procedures with (The Office of) Student Ac­tivites," Kaesebier said. 
DuLac states a different policy, however. It states, in part, "All items (bearing a trademark) ... must be or­dered through the bookstore." 
Kaesebier said that the regular trademark policies apply to individual students selling items bearing a trademark. "They must go through the regular licens­ing procedure."

Former Nazi soldier: young Germans should bear no guilt 
Associated Press 
CHAM, West Germany--A former Nazi SS soldier who leads a growing extremist party told thousands of cheer­ing supporters Wednesday that young Germans bear no guilt for Hitler's extermination of 6 million Jews. 
Franz Schoenhuber, an SS soldier in World War II, also criticized the president of the nation's Jewish community, called for the reunification of Germany and said the European Economic Commu­nity was detrimental to Ger­man farmers. 
In a speech to several thousand supporters of his Re­publican Party, which has surged in national polls, the 66­year-old politician denied being anti-Semitic. 

There are Jewish authors, composers and painters "I like," he said, "but I don't like Mr. Galinski." 
Heinz Galinski, who is 76 and survived the Auschwitz death camp, constantly reminds West Germans of the horrors of the Hitler era and criticizes anti-Jewish tendencies of the extreme right wing. 
"Mr. Galinski sabotages German-Jewish reconcilia­tion," Schoenhuber said. 
Galinski told The Associated Press by telephone from his home in West Berlin: "There will be no comment from me because it is beneath my dig­nity to argue with Mr. Schoen­huber." 
Schoenhuber fought in France and on the Eastern front in World War II, then spent 10 years as a prisoner of the British. The SS, or Schutzstaffel, was a military unit of the Nazi party and sep­arate from the regular German army. 
At the meeting in Cham, a town of 16,000 people 80 miles northeast of Munich, he pounded his fist on the rostrum and declared: "Today's young generation of Germans is no more guilty for Auschwitz than the sons and daughters of Americans who committed genocide at Hiroshima and Nagasaki." 
More than 5,000 supporters, feasting on beer and sausages in the packed hall, interrupted Schoenhuber's two-hour speech frequently with ap­plause and shouts of "Bravo!" A bavarian brass band played before and after the speech.

Helping out eating disorder victims 
Editor's note: The following is the last in a series of five articles dealing with eating disorders. 
My first experience with eating dis­orders was five years ago when a good friend in high school opened her heart and shared with me her secret of being a bulimic. Christy wondered how I would react and it took courage on her part to share this problem with me. I am afraid that in this instance I failed. 
Matt Beuter 
guest column 

Christy revealed her problem to me and I brushed it off as inconsequential. I could not understand how this could happen to a friend of mine. Christy was an all-American girl and she seemed to have everything going for her--how could she have this problem with her self-esteem? Her attempt to open up to me and my failure to take her seriously left a hole in my life. At the time I knew Christy, I was too immature to realize the extent of her problem or her need for human understanding. When she told me how she felt bloated after every meal, and the only way for her to release this feeling was to purge or vomit, I was horrified. To me, throwing up was something you did when you had the flu and not what you forced yourself to endure in the name of weight control. I had no concept of the suffer­ing she was going through and I had even less of a grasp on how to help her by being a good listener. Luckily, 
Christy found help and is today what can be loosely considered as recovered. 
When I came to Notre Dame I left Christy behind and I thought I had left eating disorders behind also, but this was not the case. I found a friend here who was also afflicted by this disease and I was given another opportunity to make the difference in someone's life. I met Wendy at the beginning of the fall semester. I was instantly im­pressed by her bubbly personality and her ever-present smile. We grew as friends. One weekend during the semes­ter we found ourselves at a tailgater. Everyone was drinking up the atmo­sphere and the joy was on all of our faces. Wendy was socializing when sud­denly she remembered that she had to take some medicine, and I being ever­curious, inquired further. She informed me that it was medicine for a disease I could never understand so it was not worth discussing. 
I pressed the subject. She explained it was both a physical and mental prob­lem. Keeping Christy in mind, I said, "I bet you have an eating disorder." Little did I know that this was true. Although Wendy was recovering, she was still suffering. I was very surprised by the accuracy of my guess, and found myself eager to reach out to her since I had failed so miserably in my previ­ous opportunity. Wendy had other ideas though, and she promptly changed the subject and we went on to discussing the upcoming football game. 
We saw each other after that but did not discuss her problem again until one

are now under way. Two sessions are available: A one-hour evening class and a half-hour class during the lunch hour. 
What if you can't swim? This is a program that does not require swim­ming skills and is excellent for those wanting to begin an exercise program. Just slip into a suit, come on down and expect to get a great workout. 
Water aerobics has many advan­tages. To begin with, while in water the body's relative weight is reduced by 90 percent. Meaning, if there is a 330 lb. individual running in the water, the im­pact per step would be 33 lbs. However, if he is outdoors running, the b()dY night when she called me after dinner and asked if I had time to talk. Not knowing what to expect, I consented, hoping that I could be whatever Wendy needed. This was my first real experi­ence talking to someone who wanted to confide in me and I listened. That night I learned many things about eating dis­orders and their ugly grip on women; but it was only the beginning. Mter that night, I felt much closer to Wendy and 

"Today's society places a high demand on females to have a slim, trim body and men do nothing to derail this runaway freight train. This is hurting oth­ers we care about and it should not be allowed to continue." 
we began to spend more time together. We took trips to the Huddle for ice cream a few times and it taught us both many things. For Wendy these trips were like a trial by jury in her mind and she had to put up the best defense she could muster. This was a new begin­ning. She was seeing life for the first time through new eyes, but my eyes were becoming more cloudy and teary. · I started to become more sensitive to people on campus who I thought might have eating disorders. I talked to my friends about it and tried to get their input. It pained me to be at dinner with a girl with just a small salad and water on her tray, or even worse to see some­
one with their tray piled high with dining hall delicacies only to purge themselves later. I struggled with myself and wanted to offer help to everyone but was still unsure how to go about it. Wendy and I talked more and more often and I began to see more of her inner feelings. She was torn apart by the comments that most of us pass off as insignificant. It made me realize how many women today are influenced by what we say and do whenwe don't even know about it. 
This brings me to the final topic of my reflections: my feelings toward the insensitive comments made with little thought to their ramification. How far are people going to react to our style of joking? How far can we push these people without hearing them snap like a bowstring? Today's society places a high demand on females to have a slim, trim body and men do nothing to derail this runaway freight train. This is hur­ting others we care about and it should not be allowed to continue. My experi­ences have taught me that making a stinging remark at the wrong time can make the difference in another's life. As we all know, the converse i~ also true. We are all human and therefore need to interact to exist. If you know someone who is suffering from an eating disorder, talk to them about it or suggest that they get help. I have come a long way since my original rejection of Christy and I hope that my story helps someone else who is in need.

water aerobics 
weight is increased three-fold to 990 lbs. Therefore, water aerobics lowers the chance of injury. 
While exercising in the water' the water acts as a resistive force. The 

faster you move, the more resistance is created. Many of the exercises in the structure program are designed around motions involved with weight condition­ing principles. In conjunction with that, exercises are implemented to concen­trate on antagonistic muscles in order to aid the balance of the development of opposite muscle groups. 
There are several other benefits to exercising in the water. It is automatic that one's body core temperature rises while engaging in vigorous activity. While exercising on dry land, various environmental conditions need to be taken into account to regulate exercise intensity and duration. As the body term perature increases, fatigue sets in, reducing the duration of the workout. Water, however, acts as a cooling agent, permitting the participant to ex­ercise for a longer period of time. At the same time, the body is getting a natural massage from the moving water, aiding in limiting muscle sore­ness the following day. Of course, there is the improvement of cardiovascular fitness (increasing aerobic capacity) as well as conditioning and toning many 
muscles of the body. 

All classes start at the beginning level, and progress is adjusted at the discretion of the instructor. Each workout, however, can be performed to maximum capacity whether it is a beginning or advanced routine, and vice versa. It is important to keep in mind that if you are new at the "sport," you must give time for the body to learn and to become familiar with the exer­cises (about 4 classes). Once the exer­cises are learned, staying with the des­ignated pace should be focused on. As . strength increases, proper techniques should be performed to give maximum involvement and cardiovascular 
stimulation. 
Exercising in the water is great for all situations, weight loss, beginners, advanced athletes, rehabilitation, arthritics within various guidelines, cross trainers, stress reductions, and many others. Most of all, at the conclu­sion of each workout, you are guaranteed to feel refreshed. Contact Non-Varsity Athletics if you would like more information. I hope you come and try the newest and safest way to exer­cise while having fun. 

Sandra Vanslager is coordinator of fit­ness programs at Non-Varsity Ath­letics.

P.O. Box Q 
McManus family thanks NO 
Dear Editor: 
My wife, Terry, and our sons, Mick and Dave, and I would like to thank all of the students, faculty, administra­tors, and alumni of Notre Dame who 
responded  to  the  death of  our  son,  
Patrick, with  so  much kindness  and  
compassion.  

We have been overwhelmed by the number of people who attended his fu­neral and participated in the Masses said for him at Notre Dame and by the number of notes, sympathy cards, Mass cards and memorial fund contri­butions we have received. It is obvious that the Notre Dame family grieved at his loss along with us. Perhaps no one but those associated with Notre Dame can comprehend this feeling of family. 
Because we have heard from so many people, it will be difficult to acknowl­edge individually each expression of sympathy. However, we want everyone associated with Notre Dame to know how much we appreciate their kindness and to know what a comfort it was to us to realize that we had such support from our extended family.

Student defends US foreign policy 
Dear Editor: 
I am really tired of the America­bashing I see in The Observer. When I read "USA gives world empty rheto­ric" on Monday, the misrepresenta­tions printed had to be exposed. 
I read that "the destabilization of popular governments has become a way of life for a populace in the grip of anti-communist paranoia." The author complains about U.S. action in Nicaragua. First of all, what he fails to consider is that in Nicaragua, his views, if printed, might get The Obser­ver shut down. As far as the "popular government" goes, many Nicaraguans oppose it, and I think it is in the interest of both the U.S. and Nicaragua to remove it, if that is reasonably possi­ble. Are Americans paranoid about communism? There is no communist government on earth that gives its people the kind of freedom Americans enjoy. Why do you think thousands of Nicaraguans are now in this country seeking political asylum? 
Sean Ellington asks if we have no con­fidence in capitalism. We do, but any doctrine that preaches violent over­throw, as communism does, cannot be handled by a "wait and see" method. America gets bashed for its involve­ment in El Salvador and other Central American countries. Well, I know the region is no bastion of civil liberties, Miranda warnings, and fair trials, but when leftist opposition in El Salvador threatens death to local officials unless they resign, drastic measures must be 

Doonesbury 

taken. (This was recently reported in Time Magazine. Most have resigned, and most of those who haven't are dead.) 
I'm not saying that U.S. foreign policy is perfect, but realize that for every peasant terrorized by the right, another gets the same treatment from the left. Central America poses many challenges, and the proper course of action is not nearly as simple as Sean Ellington suggests.

Gong Show assists needy children 
Dear Editor: 
On behalf of the St. Hedwig Outreach Center and the class of 1990, we would like to cordially invite the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community to at­tend the third annual Gong Show, Friday Feb. 10, 1989 at 7:30 p.m. in Washington Hall. 
The money raised from ticket sales, ads, and donations will directly benefit the St. Hedwig Outreach Center. The Center provides a place for lesser privileged children to go after school to receive tutoring, guidance, and friendship. The Notre Dame-Saint Mary's students who participate in this program find it as rewarding as the children. 
As representatives for the class of 1990 we would strongly encourage the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community to donate two hours of their time to gain two smiles in return.

Sacred Heart lacks open attitude 
Dear Editor: 
We are concerned with the lack of openness exhibited in the main church of Sacred Heart during weekend Masses. At the start of Mass, the con­gregation is generally instructed to stand during the consecration; the rea­son offered is to allow everyone to see the altar. In the instructions at the beginning of the Roman Missal, which all priests use to celebrate Mass, a clearpreferel\!e isgiven to the kneeling position during the consecration. In ac­cordance with the Missal and in accor­dance with the longstanding tradition in the United States and in many parts of the world, we wish to worship God in a kneeling position during the con­
. secration. We do not understand why the liturgist prohibits us from doing what the Catholic Church obviously al­lows us to do. ··

Men's IH basketball teams battle for playoff positions 
By BARB MORAN Sports Writer 
In men's interhall action last night, Morrissey Hall defeated Dillon with a close score of 59­50 to maintain their undefeated status. Morrissey, now 6-0, fell behind early in the game, but put their fast break to work to put themselves up 25-21 at halftime. The strong running game and man-to-man defense of Morrissey, along with foul trouble on the Dillon side, com­bined to put the final score in Morrissey's favor. 
Morrissey coach Steve Corr is optimistic about his team's chances in the upcoming playoffs: 
"We'll do alright, we have a strong running and shooting game," said Corr, "and we've been playing together for a couple of years." 

Corr also cited the strong play of guards Kevin Keyes, Rod Culver and Kevin Kade, and forwards Derek Johnson and Tom Veltz, as vital to the team's success. 
Morrissey will attempt to retain their undefeated status when they play their final game of the regular season against the powerful off-campus Invin­cibiles tonight at 8. 
In the Big Sky division, Keenan captured first place with a win over Cavanaugh last Saturday, leaving second place to the 4-1 Stanford team. 
Keenan captain Steve McCarthy cites a combination of rebounding strength and hard practice as the reasons for his team's top position in the conference. Keenan will head into the playoffs with a strong 5-1 record, depending on the combined rebounding power of Gary Anderson and Joe Hippler and the tough play of point guard Tony Dill. 
In Big Ten action, the first place slot is still up for grabs. Previously undefeated Fisher, the current leader in the divi­sion, suffered a tough loss to the Alumni Dogs 2 last Satur­day, putting their conference title in jeopardy. 
Fisher will play second place Pangborn (4-2) tonight for the Big Ten title. Pangborn will rely on the play of high scorer Martin Somerville to move them into first place.

Act Four: We find our stars in the library study room once again and they are busily conversing about the excitement they finally received a student night. Bob: "I can't believe the fun that we had last night. I'm so excited that I got the new Erasure c.d. and a new Morrissey poster for my room." Jessica: " I'm really happy with the new clothes that I bought with the discounts that the mall merchants gave us just by showing our student id's. I'm glad that I got a free punch on my frequent shopper card by showing the Transpo stamp on my hand maybe my card will be chosen in the newt drawing for prizes." Colleen:" I really enjoyed the movie that we saw. It was so hard to decide between "Working Girl", "Naked Gun" and "Three Fugitives", but I'm satisfied that we saw" Three Fugi-tives" because it was so good. Oh, and that popcorn that we got for free because we rode the bus tasted so good. There's nothing that can beat a good movie and popcorn, except, maybe my studies." Bob: "0h no, here we go again!"

ND ready for MCC rematch 
Davis ' offensive, defensive consistency sparks the Irish 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
When you are 5-foot-9 and playing among the trees in the low post, it is easy to lose respect for those who say bas­ketball is not a contact sport. 
But sophomore forward Krissi Davis has not shied away from contact under the basket this season. 
In fact, she has grabbed a team-high 114 rebounds thus far for the Notre Dame wo­men's basketball team--35 more than her nearest team­mate. 
It is a familiar role for Davis, who played inside during high school and in her first season, when the Irish were under­manned after a rash of injuries depleted the low post. 
But this year was supposed to be different. Senior co­captain Heidi Bunek and a talented crew of freshmen post players were supposed to clean up on the boards. 
Once again though, injury and illness have taken their toll on the Irish, and the in­defatigable Davis has been called on again to resume her duties in the paint. 
"I know there will be a time when I will need to move out to the perimeter," said Davis. "But I've spent a lot of time in the low post and I'm used to it. I've gotten used to the idea that when you're shorter you've got to use your quickness and out­smart your opponents." 
Intimidation among bigger players has yet to be a factor for Davis, who has led the team in rebounding on six separate occasions, including a season­high 12 against one of the strongest team's the Irish have faced this season, Old Dominion. 
But Davis has been using her foot speed and court savvy to do more than just rebound. 
She has purloined more passes than any other Irish player--snatching a team-high 52 steals--and has helped con­vert these pilfered passes into points, dishing out 34 assists. 
And though she does not con-

Krlssl Davis 

sider herself a scorer, Davis is third in scoring, averaging 8.2 points per game. 
She has been a consistently strong shooter from the field, with a .519 percentage, and has gone to the charity stripe more than any other player and come away with a .767 free-throw percentage. 
"My goal for the season was to shoot 75 percent from the free-throw line and relax more with my shooting," said Davis. "But I never want to be a flashy player. 
"I'm not a big offensive threat. I get much more satis­faction making a good pass or setting a hard pick and seeing my teammates score because I know that's what it takes to win."

tude is reflected in her scrappy play not only in game situa­tions, but in daily workouts. 
"She's a real hard worker," said Irish head coach Muffet McGraw. "She plays as hard in practice as she does in games, and with that kind of work ethic, she's going to keep getting better and better." 
As a freshman, Davis learned to accept a role as a sub and came off the bench to spark the team with several sterling performances. 
And the one-year adjustment period has given Davis just enough time to mature as a player and get used to the 
J
faster-paced college game before she moved into a start­ing role this season. 
Davis has worked in the off­season and is now under the tutelage of graduate assistant Sandy Botham, who is sharing her knowledge of the low post game with Davis. 
"Sandy has already helped me a lot," said Davis. "And if I can keep gaining experience like that, I'm hoping within the next few years we can get closer to our goal of getting to the NCAAs and actually win­ning it." 
Davis and the team will have a chance to get one step closer tonight at 7: 30 as they take on visiting Evansville in the JACC. 
The Irish won comfortably, 75-65, earlier this season, and will be looking to keep their un­blemished 7 ~ Midwestern Col­legiate Conference record per­fect with another win. 
"Evansville has improved a lot since our first meeting," said McGraw, "and they have a lot of small players who are good shooters. 
"We'll have to go after them man-on-man and try to get a rebound advantage on them. lt!s always harder to win the second time around, but we want to keep winning games, especially in the conference.

Sophomore Mark Gerardi t also looked impresssive, taking a 21-6 technical fall over Mike 
Honkomp in the matchup of 158-pounders. 
"I think (Notre Dame) has 
some real superstars," said 
Miami coach Chuck Angello, 
whose team fell to 6-5. "It's like 
fighting a tiger. Every time we 
would hold back, they took an­
other bite out of us." 
Other Notre Dame winners included 118-pound Andy Radenbaugh (7-4 over Nick Canitano), 150-pound Todd Layton (9-6 over Paul Mar­shall) and 167-pound Todd Tomazic (16-3 over Mike Romp). Radenbaugh and Layton both were suffering minor illnesses while wres­tling.
In Miami's two wins, 126­pound Craig Petti defeated Notre Dame's Marcus Gowens 3-2 and 190-pound Hamilton Munnell won a 16-8 major deci­sion over Notre Dame's Curt Engler. 
"Miami has some scrap­pers," said McCann. "They don't have the best talent, but they're hard to wrestle. They're a little unorthodox, and they can make you look bad. They think they have a chance of winning the MAC (Mid-American Conference), and I think they've got a shot too." 
Angello had high praise for the Notre Dame program after the match. 
"I was at John Carroll before I got here, and Notre Dame was not a top-notch program," he said. "Fran McCann's done a super job. McCann, (assistant coach) Ricky Stewart and the wrestlers deserve credit." 
" ... High, wild and handsome comedy."

"I think players always want to go where they can win," Holtz said. "I think they under­stand the national attention and the recognition. But I would hope they selected Notre Dame for the proper reasons and not because we won the na­tional championship. I hope they selected Notre Dame be­cause of the educational oppor­tunities available here and the type of people they'll be asso­ciated with. 
"Too many futures are as­certained and too many obser­vations are developed simply based on what happens on na­tional signing date," Holtz said. "That's not realistic. I think this group we've brought in is intelligent, has good char­acter, has pretty good speed and pretty good skills. But nobody is going to win all by themselves out of high school."

Dillon, Off-Campus dominate IH hockey 
By ARTHUR GOLLWITZER Sports Writer 
As the 1988-89 Interhall 
hockey season approaches 
playoff time, close races can 
be found at the top of both the 
Gold and Blue divisions. 
In action Tuesday night, Off­
Campus Crime defeated Dillon 
5-4 in a very close game. Dillon 
jumped out to an early 3-1 lead 
on goals by Jim Kilway, John 
Ravoli, and Mark Zoia, as­
sisted by captain Tim 
O'Laughlin. 
The game turned around when the Crime switched to John Krotzer in goal. For the remainder of the game, Dillon scored only once more. Scoring for Off-Campus were captain John Kirk, Craig Caraful and Steve Bishop, who had the game-winner. 
Thursday night Dillon goes up against undefeated Grace in a game with major playoff im­plications. With Off-Campus at 4-0, Grace at 4-0 and Dillon at 3-1, a win over Grace would keep playoff hopes alive. 
A Grace victory would clinch 
playoff spots for Off-Campus 
and Grace. 
Grace is coming off a 9-0 win 
over Keenan on Monday. Offen­
sively, Dave Gullot and Joe 
Levan are major contributors 
for Grace. 
"We have gotten great play 
from our goalie Gary Davis," 
said Grace captain Erik Galis.

In the Blue division, Stan­ford, Alumni and Cavanaugh are battling for two playoff berths. Stanford, having just beaten Fisher 7-0, is looking forward to next week's big matchup with Alumni. 
"We've had a lot of good 

playing," said Stanford cap­
tain Desmond Curran, "and 
goalie Hardie Tankersley has 
had two shutouts." 
Tom Treachy and Chuck Soutsos scored two goals each. Stanford has a 4-1 record, but that one loss was by a 3-2 score to Cavanaugh, which sports a 3-1 record. 
Goaltender Andy Fena 

starred in Cavanaugh's win 
over Stanford, a close battle 
that was decided by Chris Sul­

minutes. 
In a physical game Monday 

night, Cavanaugh blasted 
Pangborn 6-1 behind Sullivan's 
two goals and another strong 
performance by Fena. 
"Our goaltending is strong,

playoffs," said Sullivan. 
Undefeated Alumni could

Although he did not score a point in the game, Singleton dished out 12 assists, picked up two steals and led a potent Irish running attack during their 46­point second half. 
"We know we have to press to win because we have a lot of fine athletes on this team, and they set us into our transition game," said Phelps. "The bot­

Arizona will not take any chances with No.1 ranking 
Associated Press 
TUCSON, ARIZ.--On Feb. 1, 1988, the Arizona Wildcats were No.1 and purring to the NCAA pied Piper's then-hit tune, "Goin' to Kansas City." 
This week, back in first place in The Associated Press rankings, the Wildcats are not exactly whistling "Oklahoma" let alone humming the more obscure song "Seattle." 
What they had, for Thursday, was Oregon on the mind. 
A year ago, atop The AP poll for four straight weeks and six of seven, the Wildcats visited Stanford for a Pacific-10 game and were bounced from No. 1. They did go on to Kansas City and the NCAA final Four, where they got bounced again­-by Oklahoma. 
But what goes around comes around--thanks to some recent developments. 
The No. 1-ranked team Jan. 30 was Oklahoma. Arizona was fourth. 
But last weekend, Oklahoma, No. 2 Illinois and third-place North Carolina all lost, and the Wildcats, 17-2 and 11-1 in the Pac-10, leapfrogged into first place. 
Arizona is sure to still be there Sunday for its nationally televised game at Oklahoma, which fell to fifth in the latest shakeup. 
But much lies ahead before what Coach Lute Olson and his players hope will be a repeat trip to the Final Four in Seattle. 
First order of business is Oregon, 3-7 and seventh in the Pac-10, and 8-12 overall, in Eugene. 

"We know what it's like to play on the road ranked No. 1 against teams that really shouldn't beat you," said All American Sean Elliott. "We know how they come at you and and we know the circum­stances and the consequences involved. ­
"It's going to be a tough game. Our main goal right now is to win the league champion­ship, and that's what we're striving for, and it's not a sit­uation where you can get carried away worrying about the Oklahoma game. Really, the Oklahoma game isn't nearly as important as the Oregon game is." 
Said Olson: "give us one of the two games, and I'll take Oregon any day of the week," said Olson. "It'll be our job make sure that we keep our guys focused on what needs to be done." 
Olson said Oregon coach Don Monson has made some lineup changes that have improved the Ducks' recent perfor­mances, and that they will have "even more incentive" be­cause of Arizona's ranking. 
G-town 70, UCon. 58 
HARTFORD, CONN.--Jaren Jackson scored eight of his 18 points during the first 7: 52 of the second half as second­ranked Georgetown went on a 20-10 run and pulled away from Connecticut for a 70-58 Big East

Jackson made a 3-point shot and a three-point play and Alonzo Mourning and Anthony Allen each had five points during the spurt as the Hoyas built a 30-26 halftime lead to 50­36 with 12:08 remaining. 
Georgetown, 18-2 overall and 8-1 in the conference, widened the lead to 65-43 before Connec­ticut scored 13 straight to close within 65-56 with 48 seconds left. The Hoyas were able to withstand the charge as Mark Tillmon and Charles Smith combined for five quick points.

First he hit a short jump shot to tie the game 66-66 with 2: 12 remaining. Then, after two Cin­cinnati turnovers, he dunked a pass from Tony Kimbro to put the Cardinals ahead 68-66 with 
1: llleft. 
Louisville, 17-4 overall and 6­1 in the Metro Conference, remained one-half behind first­

The Notre Dame football team continued its winning streak Wednesday. 
It was another banner recruiting year, as 17 Super­Prep All-Americans were among the 25 high school foot­ball stars who signed national letters of intent to play for the Irish in 1989. 
"We worked at it probably as hard as we ever have," said Head Coach Lou Holtz, who guided Notre Dame to a 12-o record and the 1988 national championship in his third year at the helm. "I think we had a gt10d recruiting year, but you can't evaluate recruiting just based on one year. You have to evaluate it over a two-year per­iod." 
Quarterbacks and lineback­ers were Holtz's top priorities 

Irish sink Fordham in road trip, 77-58 
By PETE SKIKO Assistant Sports Editor 
NEW YORK--Jamere Jack­son had 17 of his 23 points in the second half as the Notre Dame men's basketball team came away with a 77-58 win over Fordham at Madison Square Garden last night. 
But it took a 13-3 run over the first four minutes of the second half for the Irish to put the fiesty Rams away. 
"We started out in a press as always," said Irish coach Dig­ger Phelps, "so we could get easy transition baskets. Our team is very young and has a lot of heart. Fordham was very pesky tonight." 
Notre Dame (13-4) dominated a sloppy, low­scoring first half and assumed its largest lead of the half (31­
21) on a LaPhonso Ellis jam with 49 seconds remaining. But Fordham (10-11) scored the final five points, including a 3­point play by Doug Bantum as the buzzer sounded, to cut the lead to five points. 
Jackson opened the half by scoring nine of his team's next 13 points to put the Irish in the comfort zone.

"We know our offense is there," said Jackson, "but when our defense does the job we know we're in great shape. Tim Singleton did a great job of driving and then kicking it out to Joe (Fredrick) and myself for a lot of open shots." 
Fordham could come no closer than eight points during the last 16 minutes of the game, due largely to very poor shoot­ing. The Rams shot 19-for-52 for the game (36 percent) includ­ing 1-for-6 from three-point range. 
"Notre Dame's pressure bothered us all game long," said Ram coach Nick Macar­chuk. "It made us tentative and caused a lot of turnovers. They also did a great job on the boards." 
In the second half, the trio of  Jackson, Fredrick and Keith Robinson combined for 40 of Notre Dame's 46 points. Fredrick and Robinson finished with 19 points each. El­The Observer I Patrick Kusek lis added 10 for the Irish. Junior co-captain Jamere Jackson's shots were right on the mark

ND wrestlers cruise past Redskins 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 
In last night's wrestling meet attheJoyceACC, Miami (Ohio) showed it had made great strides since its 40-3 loss to Notre Dame last season. 
But the Irish let Miami know they had improved as well, routing the Redskins 37-7. Al­though Notre Dame won by a big margin, Irish coach Fran McCann wasn't exactly satisfied with his team's per­formance. 
"We looked a little sluggish," said Irish coach Fran McCann, whose 13th-ranked squad upped its record to8-2. "We had a big match with Oklahoma last week and Indiana next week. This one was stuck in be­tween. But we came up tough. The kids who won, won big." 
Notre Dame lost 19-16 to eighth-ranked Oklahoma last Friday, and the Irish host the Hoosiers this Friday.
