S.U. ticket policy displeases Treasurer 
by Mary Fran Callahan 
Student Government Treasurer Greg Sebasky has expressed discontent after a 5-4 vote by the Board of Commissioners to retain the Student Union complimentary ticket policy. . Traditionally, 25 pairs of tickets for every concert are purcha~ed with student funds and provided free of c~arge for Student Unu~m 
and Student Government officials. Bill Roche, as Student Body 
president, receives one pair, and 21 pairs go to the Student Union 
director for distibution to workers in his commissions. the 
remaining two pairs went to the HPC until two years ago, when 
they refused to accept any more tickets. 
However, $2700 has already been appropriatedby Student Union this year to cover the cost of the tickets. Sebasky said that a heated discussion on this issue followed the Board of Commissioners' budget hearinss that concluded early yesterday morning . A motton to abolish complimentary tickets was proposed and then defeated by the 5-4 vote. 
Sebasky commented, ''The issue here is compensation versus no compensation. As I am approver of funds. I have to sign checks. I don't know if I can do tt in good conscience. This money could have been used for other clubs or organizations." 
The reasoning behind the complimentary tickets is that the tickets are a reward to Student Union workers for the work they do. However, Sebasky counteres, "We are a volunteer organization, and this is a matter of principle. Volunteers are not expected to be 
compensated for their jobs.'' Sebasky feels that Student Union officials already enjoy many benefits in the contacts they have and the people they are involved Commissioners allocate 
with. In addition, he commented, ''In keeping with the integrity of volunteer organizations, the benefits are certainly not dimin­
mone_y to or!(antzattons
ished.'' 

Sebasky, who wholeheartedly supported the motion to abolish the 
. by Mary Fran Callahan 
tickets, is not going to close the book on this traditional fund. "It has not been resolved yet; the subject will come up again." Further discussion of the issue and particularly Sebasky' s stand on After a total of 22 hours of 
it are expected to be brought up at the next Board of 
hearings this weekend, the Commissioners' meeting. Student Board of Commission­

Pope delivers address 
.130STON (AP) -Pope ] ohn Paul II opened a pastoral visit to hi~ divided American flock yes­terqay, raising a shepherd's crozier to bless a drenched but ecstatic Boston. He had words of praise and friendship but warnings, too, for this rich and troubled nation. 
"I greet you America the Beautiful,'' the pope told a cheering throng in Boston Com­mon in the first major address of his six-city U.S. tour. "I want to tell everyone that the Pope is your friend." 
He hailed America as a free and generous land, but said its youth was being lured from religion to the empty "escape" of sexual J?leasure, drugs, vio­lence and mdifference. 
"I propose to you the option of love, which is the opposite of escape, ' ' the pontiff said amid a downl?our that had turned the histone common into a sea of mud. 
As many as 400,000 people crowded the park, waving flags, banners, handkerchiefs and whatever else was available as the/ope, dressed in white and go! , raised his arms in bless-mg. . . 
The crowds had stood under umbrella&, singing while they waited for the pontiff, who landed at Boston's Logan Air­port in mid-afternoon. His mot­orcade from the airport ran about 40 minutes late, but when he finally approached along Beacon Street, standing in an open car, his arms outstretch­ed, the throng broke into shouts and cheers. 
Umbrellas were lowered as the stirring hymn "Praise to the Lord, the Almighty'' signaled the Pope's arrival. He stood on the altar, brightly spotlighted against the dusk, and began the Mass: "In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.'' 
The motorcade had changed its route to avoid a demonstra­tion by an estimated 1,000 persons protesting the shooting of a black youth at a football practice Friday. 
The pope had spoken of the dity's ractal problems in a visit to Holy. Cross Cathedral en route to the common, noting that ''people of all races, colors and creeds . . . have created workable solutions." 
Thousands lined the city's narrow streets as the pontiff's motorcade d,rpy~. from. Log~Q.

This is the nation's second­largest Catholic: diocese. More than two million of the area's 
5.7 million residents are Carbo­lies. 
Waving flags of papal gold and white, crowds a dozen deep along the sidewalks shouted "Viva il papa!" as the motor­cade passed through the Italian North End. Rosaries were held aloft as it whisked, too, through Irish "Southie" and the Hispa­nic section of the South End. 
Gold and white were every­where when the pontiff landed at the airport after a three-day visit to Ireland. 
The pope's Aer Lingus jumbo jet, the "St. Patrick," set down at 2:49p.m. EDTas a band from St. Ann's parish in Neponset, Mass., blared a we leone and waved flags of red, white and blue stripes.

ers by a vote of 8-1 finally allocated its $128,353 to Stu­dent Union, Student Govern­ment and 21 out of the 50 clubs and organizations that request­ed funds. 
Student Union will operate this year with a lower budget of $61,694.91 and thus may have to cut some activities. Greg Sebasky, StudentQovernment treasurer, cited the primary reason for the budget cut as the Mock Convention--an event which is sch<:duled once every four years and has been allocat­ed $5,000. Student Government will operate on a $24,124.64 budget which is basically the same as last year's figure. 
The Hall Presidents' Council allotment of $15,000 is a 60 percent increase in funding over last year. "Because of the new party policy, we wanted to make our committment greater to HPC in order 'to help them improve the halls' social spa­ces," Sebasky commented. 
AnTostal received $1,500 less this year with a total allocation of $5,575. The AnTostal com­mission overspent last year by $5,000 and the Board felt that a lower budget would force them to manage their funds better. Sebasky, however, indicated the cut is going to hurt the activity, "I think we may have to allocate more funds for them for the contingency {und. Last year they spent $12,000." 
The Legal Aid/Student Ser­vices Division received $1,000-­the highest allocation made of the 21 clubs that were selected for funds. ''The. service is available for all students. They

Carter says Soviets not withdrawing from Cuba 

WASHINGTON (AP) President Carter reported to the nation last night that the Soviet Union is not removing its troops from Cuba, but he s: d the contro­versy "is certainly no reason for a return to the Cold War" and should not block S, ·nate ap­proval of an arms treaty. 
Carter said he has received "assurances from the highest levels of the Soviet govern­ment'' that the troops are manning a training center in Cuba and offer no direct threat to U.S. security. 
Nevertheless, the president said, "We shall not rest on these Soviet statements alone.'' and he announced that the United States is increasing its own military presence in the Caribbean. 
The president said a far great­er threat than the Soviet troops in Cuba would result if the Senate refuses to ratify the strategic arms limitation treaty (SALT II) signed by Carter and ~qviet President Leonid Brezh­nev. 
In recent weeks, Carter had 
said the United States would act 
on its own to change the 
situation if no agreement could 
be reached with the Soviets. 
On one such occasion, he said, 
''The status quo is not accept· 
able." 

In his nationally broadcast speech last night, Carter said Soviet officials insisted to him that the brigade is a training unit, and not a combat unit,· "they will not change its func­tion or status as a training center." 
''We understand this to mean 
that they do not intend to 
enlarge the unit or give it 
addittonal capabilities,'' Caner 
said. 

The president also reported 
assurances that the Soviet per­
sonnel on the island' 'will not be 
a threat to the U.S. or to any 
other nation.'' 

It was understood that the 
Soviet assurances Carter cited 
were dealt with in a personal 
exchange last week between 
Carter and Brezhnev. 

Carter sent a message to 
Brezhnev last Tuesday, 1t was 
learned, and the Russian leader 
replied on Thursday. 

Earlier yesterday, Sen. Frank 
Church, chairman of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, 
met with the president for a half 
hour briefing on Carter's spe­
ach. The Idaho Democrat said 
he thought SALT II could be 
salvaged. 

''I think we can salvage the 
SALT treaty, and I'm looking 
for a way to do it," Church said. 
"I don't think that SALT is 
scuttled. I believe that a way 
can be worked out that is 
satisfactory to the Senate.''

LONDON (AP) -The price of gold surged to a record $414.50 an ounce in Europe yesterday as the U.S. dollar declined and was kept from dropping below last year's lows only by massive central-bank intervention. 
Gold closed at $413.25 in London after trading as high as $414.75 and ended at $414.50 in Zurich. It was the first time gold ever closed above $400 in 

_ Europe, although the level was touched Friday before prices slipped . 
There wert· reports of contin­ued _gold buying by Arabs and of efforts to sell dollars after a meeting between West German and American officials in Ham­burg produced vague promisr::s, but no specific steps, to defend the dollar.

At Notre Dame, tickets will be on sale starting today at the. student ticket office. Tickets will also be sold in the Saint Mary's cafeteria today and tomorrow and in the cashier's office beginning Wednesday. 
This is an experimental pro­gram and will be subject to evaluation at the end of the semester.

lJS iurisdiction ends New flag waves; Panamanians celebrate 
BALBOA PANAMA (AP) ­The Panamanian flag was raised over the former canal zone yesterday. Hundreds of thousands of Panamanians marched in for a look and for ceremonies marking the end of ...,5 years of American jurisdic­tion. 
There were no reports of the violence some. U.S. residents had feared as an estimated quarter of a· million Panaman­ians surged toward a zone airfield for a transfer ceremony attended by . Panamanian leaders, Vice President Mondale and some Latin heads ot state. 
Many carried miniature red, white and blue Panamanian flags and looked dazed as they wandered through well"kept residential areas. Others danced in to the blare of salsa bands and the pop of fire­crackers. 
A few Panamanians staggered in drinking from rum bottles after a night of prolonged revelry marking effective date of the new Panama Canal Treaties: 
During the ceremony under a blazing sun at Albrook Airfield, President Aristides Royo de­clared: 
''From this moment on, the Panamanian flag will fly above Ancon Hill and Panama begins to excercise jurisdiction over its entire territory. 
''The Panamanian will no longer be judged by foreign laws in his own nation Now there is no country within a country. Now the Canal Zone

More than half of the season football tickets stolen from South Bend residents' mail­boxes in early September were recovered at the football stadium gates this past Satur­day, ACCticket manager Mike Busick said. 
Busick also indicated that the fans who tried to use the tickets described the scalpers as "young high school students." But he added that he is unsure of whether or not the high school students are the actual thieves. 
Dean of Students James Roemer stated that ten student tickets were also confiscated Saturday at the stadium gates from persons who tried to use the tickets improperly. 
Commenting on any trouble that might have occurred in the stadium among students as a result of his dtrectives against alcohol consumption in the stadium and the use ofbanners Roemer replied, ''The students handled themselves very well.'' Roemer added, however, that there was trouble with a "non­student" who "smuggled in cans of beer, was caught and got thrown out by South B.end police."

:by Tom Hay 
Final preparations . are now underway for the $30 million downtown "hole" project in South Bend. Plans include a 300 room Mariott hotel, .and a First Bank building of a:pprox~ imately 150,000 square feet. A story high glass atrium is to connect the two structures .. The project. will also incorporate about 700 below·grade ·parking spaces. 
The· downtown "hole" is bounded by Michigan, Wash~ ington, St. ] oseph, and Colfax streets. 
If all goes according to sche­dule, official groundbreaking ceremonies will be held on Oct. 
19. An architectural model and conceptual drawings will also be exhibited at this time. 
First Bank President Chris Murphy expects the current project to produce "a jewel in the center of the city," he said. "We selected the architects to do something significantly dif­ferent. We would like to attract regional and national atten­tion." 
HelmutJahn of C.F.Murphy Associates, a Chicago·based architecture firm, is the chief architect for the project. 
According to Carl Ellison, South Bend director of redev­elopment, "the project is of such a magnitude that it will change the dynamics of down­town development in South Bend.'' . 
Ellison cited economic and employment benefits, but said that confidence in South Bend would be the ·most important spin-off. The "hole" should help generate more develop­ment with further benefits to the city," Ellison said. 
Public funding for the project comes from an Urban Dev­elopment Action Grant under a program initiated by President part in the ceremony ·at the airfield, but was to participate in a ceremony transferring mili­tary command of the zone. 
Mondale told the crowd: "I am here today to say we will honor the full terms of the treaties.'' 
The Vice President praised the canal builders. and operators,Panamanians · and Americans alike, aiid mentioned the human sacrifice from all other nations involved in building it. Panama takes over most basic services in the area, along with the operation of the ports and railroads, and becomes land­lord of nearly 1,000 houses in

Student observes action 


A night with N.D. Security 
by Ann Hesburgh 

Last Friday night not many people were awan: that Ken­neth Needham reported his wife missing or that an over­turned golfcan was obstructing traJflc between the Continuing Education Center and D-1. But not many people needed to be aware, because those in charge had everything under control. 
Tbe ten security officers who v.orked the 11 (J.m. to 7 a.m. shift Friday mght/Saturday morning were busy not only with routine buildmg checks and transport calls, but others. DuL to the first home game, the 
campus was more active than usual. At 1:25 a.m., shift commander 
Sgt. William L. Knll received a 10-78 (need assistance) from the security guard at the main gate. Kenneth Needham, a member of the band who played at the pep rally, could not locate his wife. She had told him she "wa~. going to go wait by the van. 
Prior to this call, Krill had spoken to a wom~In who flt Needham's description when making his routine check of the grounds behind Stepan Center. When Krill asked her what she was doing, and if she needed help, she replied, "No thanks, I'm just waiting for the band." After Krill took down the necessary information, the search for Debbte Needham began. "Many calls were made. 
Msgr. Egan speaks at CILA Weekend 
by Tim Mitchell 

Msgr. Jack Egan spoke on a theme of justice and compas­sion to 90 students at the Community oflnternational Lay Apostalate (CILA) annual Orientation Weekend last Sat­urday. The Orientation Week­end was held at Camp Tamer­ack in Michigan and ran from Friday evening through Sunday after1,100n. 
The Weekend provided an opportunity for new members to learn more about CILA and the activities it is involved in locally as well as worldwide, according to CILA Chairman Mark Wathen. 
Egan, who has been a special assistant to University Presi­dent Fr. Theodore Hesburgh for eleven years, spoke for rwo hours on his interpretation of the Christian message. He explained the need for a fight against injustice wherever it is found. Egan mentioned his hope that Pope John Paul II might call us to be "a people of awareness and a people of justice" upon the Pope's visit to 
the United States. 
Egan said that the question of bringing justice to our society is a call to all Christians, not just priests and clergy. In working for justice, Egan said that we, as Christians, should not avoid conflict or controversy. 
He said, ''There is nothing more controversial than a man hanging on a cross." 
Egan's speech was part of the CILA weekend's overall reflec­tion on justice and how it relates to students in the Notre Dame -Saint Mary's com­munity. Other activiues on the weekend included community service reports of CILA' s volunteer work in the South Bend community. There were also project presentations by ten CILA members who worked during the summer in social justice-related capacities. 
Egan commended these proJects, saying ''This is the kind of work that gives us all a hope and a vision. Each of us must be more sensitive to the needs of others and, therefore, we have an imperative to acuon.

One of the first to bt" contacted was LaFortune's manager Francis Gorch who said that no one fitting her description had been seen. 
When asked to what extent Security would investigate, Krill said, "We'll keep digging until we come up w1th some­thing.'' 
At 1:57 a.m., Needham's investigaiton became 10-24 (as­signment complete). Debbie Needham had received a ride home from a friend. Krill breathed a sigh of relief and said, "Now I feel better." 
Earlier at 12:20 a.m., a radio call was received. "Brown van just ran th~ mai_n gate -10-~5 (occupants mtox1cated)". K.nll assisted the call and pulled up behind the van that was now parked between Dillon and Alumni Halls. Within ii·,e minutes this case was coded 10-24. The Michigan driver 
was  cited  with  unauthorized  
admission  and  escorted  off  
campus.  

Other calls scratched over the radio at varying intervals during the eight-hour shift. At 
11:45 p.m., a student was caught walking away with one of the main gate's sawhorses. Earlier, notice was taken of three males sitting in a tree near Farley Hall. 
At 12:20 a.m., the main gate called and reported that another car had run the gate, and at 3:07, two students were spotted with two cans of paint. ''Krill is a good man, there are none better,'' said Bill Mclean, former OBUD director and friend of Krill's. "If there is anyway to save someone's re­putation in a report, he will.'' 
At 3:35 a.m., Krill received a call from station one (security office). Two former Notre Dame students, Tom O'Neil andJohn Rooney, needed a ride to their car that was located several blocks from Jefferson Blvd. downtown. "My ex­perience is that Notre Dame security is -understaffed and over qualified," said O'Neil. ''Security sometimes comes across as being hard-nosed, but actually they are very willing to listen." 
The Notre Dame student who was allowed to ride 52 miles with Sgt. Krill last Friday night learned more than just routme police codes and terms. She learned that the 11 p.m. to 7 
a.m. crew are dedicated people and willing to help the students sometimes more than the students realize.

''Dotner hat'' controversy comes to a head 
by Rosie Lawrence 

A difference of opinion SJJr­rounds the newest Senior Class fund raising project, known as ''domer hats.'' 
Nick Schneeman, Senior Class president, said that the hats are very popular among both students and alumni, es­pecially at last weekend's foot­ball game. 
"At first, we were concerned about the reactions to the hats, whether or not they were sacrilegious, but the Dome is a symbol of the University, and it's even on the D-2 parking lot stickers," said Schneeman. 
Another viewpoint was ex­pressed by Father Mario Pedi, Senior Class moderator. 
"I feel that they are in poor taste," Pedi said. "Perching a statue on someone's head is taking something precious to

Turning point or point 

o_f no return? 
Rarely, in the_ course_ of ~merican politics, has 
th_ere been a ume quite !Jke It. As theater, it 
otfers suspense, an aura of crisis and a dash of 
melodrama. In reality, it is a critical period--for 
both the President and the country. There is no 
denying it. Jimmy Carter is in serious, possibly 
Irrevocable trouble as President·of the United 
St~t.es. The sundry que_:;tions concerning his · 
abtlny to handle the off1ce to which he was 
elected three years ago arc no longer whispered 
but are blatantly shouted. There is the 
suspicion, growing deeper with each passing 
day, that America has slipped into an age of 
dangerous uncertainty; one which neither the 
President nor the country can afford. What 
brought on this crisis of leadership? More 
Importantly, how can we, as a free people 
remedy the situation? ' 
From the beginning, Jimmy Carter stressed 

the neeJ for "government to be as good as its 
people " This singular theme became the 
cachet of his highly unorthodox campaign for the 
White House. And, when he had won, that 
-;arne theme was carried over from campaign 
promise to domestic policy following the 
inauguration.
\\ tth the tirst several months of the Carter Administration devoted to getting 'acquainted" with Washington and insp1ring the American people with the Carter style, the nation as a whole seemed willing to place their trust wholeheartedly in their new, seemingly-dynamic President. The ··alk nown Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration n:n· The radio phone-in show. The town meetings. The fires1de chat. The energy speech to Congress. Symbolic? Certamly. Played up? Definitely. But importa~t to the An:terican people? Absolutely.' The natton reveled m the fact that the President of the United States wore blue jeans had a warm and affable smile, and was not 'part of the establishment that had produced Vietnam and W~tergate. The people were beguiled by the emgma of Carter and Carter basked in the light of national approbation. 
Somehow, however, the beacon of Carter's "Cam~lot" began to dim. We noticed it for the first ttme dunng the Bert Lance affair in the autumn of 1977; the worst of it came as the gas ~ines grew longer this past summer. Myster­IOusly and yes, even tragically, the approval the A~erican pc;ople so willingly afforded the new ch1ef executive had worn quite thin. Now, it appears that Carter's beacon is about to go out--this time for good. The transformation of a President, backed with the confidence of the people, to one totally bereft of a clear national consensus is not unusual in Americ~n politics. In fact, it is a common occurrence. It happened to Johnson as a result of Vietnam, Nixon as a result of Watergate. But, what makes the Carter situation so unusual (and that much more 1rag1c, 111 my fJpinion) is that here we have a 
Marc]. Halsema 
man--dedicated, honest, compassionate well­
intentioned, a nice guy--who cannot s~em to 
inspire, either in himself or in the people around 
him, any semblance of leadership. 
In Carter's approach to leadership, he has from 
the start difft>red markedly from his predeces­
sors. He ~as been almost as f!!Uch a suppliant as 
an authonty, a man searchtng for an elusive 
consensus in town halls and along Main Street. 
He has walked more among the people than 
ahead of them. Now, it is painfully clear that 
Carter's brand of leadership has not weathered 
the test of time, or the test of Washington. As a 
result, Carter is faced with challenges--real and 
lethal--from not only the Republican Party but 
from within his own political establishment. 
Senator Kenne~y. if (n:tore precisely: "when") 
he announces h1s cand1dacy for the Presidency, 
may v~ry well lea~ a stampede to New York City 
for h1s coronation as party "king" and 
presidential nominee. Govenor Brown of 
California hopes to lead a similar crusade in his 
own right. 

So there we have it. A Chief Executive without 
a base of_support. Pr~sident Carter is in danger 
of becomtng the first mcumbent President since 
Chester Arthur in 1884 to be denied re-nomina­
tion ~y his own party. . The. prognosis for 
Amenc~, at the same ttme, 1s equally dis­
heartem~g. Never before has this country been 
faced wtth such a plethora of difficult and 
seemingly insurmountable problems. Yet, there 
appea_rs to be no direction coming from 
Washmgton. Not even the seemingly mystical 
qualities of Teddy Kennedy may suffice to help 
cure the national malaise. 
In. this period of discontent however with Jimmy Carter, with criticis~ of his 'actions ~anging from t~e shrill attacks of environmental­Ists and the wtld accusations of consumerists to the not-so-subtle maneuvering of presidential aspirants within his own political party, we would be well-advised to remind ourselves that he's the only President we've got. The beating he i_s taking IS in our behalf. We are not an easy n~tton to govern, as Mr. Carter has so ruefully d1scovered. 
Political pundits of late have Jetermined that Jimmy Carter has reached--if not passed--the crossroads of his Presidency. That may very well be true. What few others besides the President so clearly recognize, however is that it is not only Jimmy Carter who stand~ at the crossroads; America, too, has come to the fork in the road. The singular reward that Carter may reap from his four years in the White House is exactly that--four years as President and not a single day more. For President Carter, boldness has become a necess~ry _gamble. If all goes well hereafter, he may wtn lt. But, boldness itself gives hostage to fortune. When it fails anywhere, everything can go awry. If that happens now, Jimmy Carter will be not at a turning point but at a point of no return._

Hall renovated 
Dear Ediwr: 
During the past summer, Holy Cross Hall received some much needed, and long awaited re­novations. The administration is to be commended for its efforts to alleviate the hall's overcrowding, and to improve the hall's tnterior ap­pearance. 
For the second consecutive year rooms were added. This past summer, twelve doubles were constructed in a portion of the hall's basement. Although the rooms offer no view, and will probably be cold in the winter, freshmen have been spared the inconvenience of overcrowded triples. More importantly, the construction utilizes space which had pre­viously been used to store Secunty's repossessed bicy· 
cles. 
Amoth~r major project com­pleted last summer was the replacement of the hall's anci­ent, erratic, and inefficient1 heating system. Holy Cross is one of the few buildings on campus that has heating \)ystem independent of the coal plant. Standing radiators were re­placed with baseboard radia­~ors, a~d the gas-supplied heat­tng umt was also replaced. 

The hallways received a fresh coat of paint, which has gone a long way in covering decades' build-up of dirt and plaster patchwork. Repair has also been done on the weathered exterior, most of which is almost ninety years old. 
Dorm living is the hub of N.D. social· life. It is refreshing to the see the administration act­ing, rather than talking, about physical improvements. The work does not offer a long term solution to the housing problem but it does show some admini­strative concern for residential life.

Books Kill 
WASHINGTON--What do the Russians fear from us the most? It's not our cruise missiles, our nuclear sub­marines, our B-52 bombers or our new MX system. They're afraid of our books. 
This came to light once again when American publishers were invited to the Moscow International Book Fair. The Soviets confiscated 44 books (there could be more by the time this appears), including five editions of the "Best Pictorial Cartoons" from the years 1972, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, published by Pelican; all of Alexander Solzhenitsyn' s books; "The Illustrated History of the Third Reich" by John Bradley (Grosset and Dunlap); "A Cartoon History of United States Foreign Polley" by the editors of Foreign Policy Assn. (Morrow); ''American Ballet Theater" by Charles Payne; "Hitler" by Joachim Fest, and 
George  Orwell's  ''Animal  
Farm.''  
When  I  read  the news,  I  

called up Boris, my KGB con­tact at the Soviet Embassy in Washington, and told him, "I've just microfilmed 'The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet' and I ~hought yoi.! might want to buy 1t from me." 
He instructed me to meet him on a park bench near the Lincoln Memorial. He told me to bring along a bag of bread crumbs so we could pretend we were feeding the pigeons. 
I made the rendezvous, sat down next to him and passed him the microfilm. He slipped me an envelope with ten $100 bills. 
Art Buchwald 
''This is very good work,'' he said. "What can I expect next?" · 
I replied, ''I know a guy who works at the Discount Book Store in Chevy Chase. He has access to 'The Complete Book of Running' by James Fix. It will cost you, though. The guy thinks he's being watched by the manager. Tell me, Boris, tt must be impossible to keep books out of the Soviet Union 
. that are printed in the West. Why does the Soviet Union go to so much trouble?" 
"Books kill," he whispered. "lt must be terrible to be afraidof books. They look so innocent on a shelf. It's hard to believe they could do so much damage.'' · "It isn't the books, it's what is in them that we're concerned with. Our people are happy and love the Communist system. We don't want trash from the West to foment hatred and insecurity. The price of a true Marxist society is constant vigilance. Besides, you have no right to ask me all these questions." ''Don't get smart with me,'' I warned Boris. "I am your only source for an autographed copy of 'Sophie's Choice.' I happen to know the author." "I'm sorry I lost my temper," Bons said. "But we've been under tremendous pressure from Moscow. Sever­al people who subscribe to the Book of the Month Club man­aged to get visas to attend our book fair, and they're putting all the blame on us."

A Call for Conversation 
Ma-ny sincerely motivated members of this communtty share the lament of Andy Young: Why can't we at least enter into conversation with one another? Isn't it more healthy to get things out in the open? Isn't this a way to deepen respect for those we too quickly label as' 'enemies''? And isn't it only when we subject our notions to input from other points of view that we come to fuller truth? 
All well and good. But how to do it? Part of the frustration I sense comes from not having a forum for such necessary -community dis.cussion. True, it's hard to fashion an ideal means. Lectures don't strike us as-all that productive; nor does the ''town meetmg" approach. Perhaps one (heretofore largely untapped) resour­ce is The Observer. We've seen evidence in recent days that this year's' editors are very open to providing a forum for the ground swell of sentiment calling for a chance to discuss and debate issues that deeply concern all of us. 
For example, there is a great deal of concern about the basic purpose and vision for Notre Dame. Some are charging that N.D. is reneging on its commitment to undergraduate edu­cation. As more and more emphasis is placed on making this a top-level research center, the argument goes, the undergraduate classroom suffers. 
Teachers are no longer freely 

Ten Years After... 
The actor sits comfortably slumped in a chair in the green room of Saint Mary's O'Laughlm Auditorium. He wears a purple shirt, faded blue jeans, a navy blue dress coat, and white sneakers. At 5'7", he has a small frame, and his short brown hair is dotted with patches of gold. His speech is deliberate, but interspersed with many "you knows". 
f:k .sJJtY~y.s-tbe room, for it contains many memories from Rl$. undergrad­uate acting days. Althou~h it··:~ called the "green" room, 1ts walls are white Only the floor is green. Mounted in a long row across three of the walls are framed photographs of scenes from productions of the past 15 years. The actor is in some of them. 
Lance Davis, Class of '69 and. now a professional actor, has returned to Notre pame to play the title role in the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Thea­tre production of' 'Hamlet''. With its. opening performance on Oct. 5 and its final one on Oct. 13, it will be the first major production to take place in Washington Hall in the past ftve 
available to inves-t themselves in their 
courses, tv counsel students or . to 
render service to the university 
community. 

Those who argue this position insist 
that the tenure process exacerbates 
an already-deteriorating situation. They visualize a "Catch-22" synd­rome: In order to survive, a faculty member who is not tenured has to do the exact opposite of those things that contribute to making Notre Dame a unique Catholic university. 
Here is the way one faculty member (a tenured professor) put it: "Lamen­table as it may be, the best way to get tenure at N.D. is to disassociate oneself from the institution; that is, spend as little time as possible on teaching and counseling students and on departmental or general univer­sity service, and as much effort as possible gaining points with 'the outside,' through publishing, invol­vement in national organization, giving speeches away from campus, etc.'' 
Others in the community see the above charges as gross·ly unfair and unsubstantiated in fact. They argue that, first of all, it is crucial to recognize· that there is absolutely no inevitable opposition between scho­larship, exceflent teaching and ser­vice to the community. It is simply fallacious, they say, to set in basic opposition research and undergradu­
years. 

Since his graduation, Davis has acted steadily on stage, television, and in commercials. His stage credits include work with the Circle in the Square in New York, the Long­worh Theatre in New Haven, the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, the Arena Stage in Washington and the Geva Stage in Rochester. He has performed such roles as Bernard in "Death of A Salesman", Scapin in ''Scapin'' and Launcelot Gobbo in "Merchant of Venice". His televi­sion credits include ''Adams Chroni­cles", "Beacon Hill" and "School for Scandal''. Most recently he por­trayed Nipper, a cockney, punk rocker in an off-off broadway produc­tion of Nigel Williams' ''Class Ene­my". 
Born in Philadelphia, Lance Davis moved to St. Lou1s after his sopho­more year of high school, where he became very involved in his new ] esuit school. His first role was the psychiatrist in "Teahouse of the August Moon". His interest was sharpened when he saw Dick Bower, an actor on tour trom Catholic University, get a standing ovation for his rendition of Hamlet. 
Davis came to Notre Dame in the late 60's, he quickly went from a small role in "The Firebugs", to the leading role in ''Guys and Dolls'', "Luther, "Camelot", and "Rhino­cerous''. He was in the first Angiers program which he describes to be a ''civilizing e~pm~~-·----­
One-thing.. Davis had trouble with was the boy-girl situation of the late 60's. Notre Dame was all male at the time. 
"Ya-8,000 guys-no fun and really depressing", he says with a sigh. "I mean there's this thing they call school spirit, I think keeping 8,000 guys penned up for 5 days a week and then bringing in busloads of college girls from Chicago on the weekend, you know that's not school spirit, that's something like human bon­dage." 
Th~se busloads of girls would flood 
the campus. On weeK1eQ( that is now the Nazz, 
Fr. Bill Toohe_v 
ate education. "It is not at all · incomPatible," they state, '"to have , Notre Dame advance as a ce~~er fp~ hi_g~ly-qualifi~d research while mamtammg the h1ghest stan­dards for undergraduate education.'' 
In~ividuals who c:;mbrace this point of v1ew also quesuon _the veracity of the harsh charges agamst our tenure process.. "It is simplistic," one told me, ''to paint such a black and white picture. The tenure procedure very clearly rule-s out a faculty member, who would not spend time with students outside the classroom and contribute significantly to the general welfare of the community. In addition,'' he pointed out, "although too few people know about it, there is a process for actuating a tenure · decision reversal.'' 
Thus, there is a sizable group, it seems, who consider it completely realistic to anticipate that Notre Dame will be able to a ztract to her faculty those who possess the quali­ties of scholarship and of excellence 
· in teaching. "The two are simply not mutually exclusive," one professor told me. "Of course," he added, "finding this combination in one who also is Catholic complicates the search." I've been finding other strongly held com;i"ctions. for example, "Notre Dame has to be flexible enough to allow for some teachers who are not 
people wandering t.'ound and circ­ling each other in a "dance of death, sort of eyeing targets.~' Although ''nothing went on'' at the dances, the students had the feeling that some­thing was. It just happened to be occuring at some other pan of the room, they thought." 
When Davis went onto graduate school at the University of Minneso­ta, he had trouble adjusting. Out of the 42,000 students there, 26,000 were women. According to Davis they were all Scandinavian and looked like a cross between Liv Ullman and Britt Eckland. "I didn't make it to class the first week. I mean I just sat in the middle of the quad and stared". 
Davis got to Minnesota by winning a McKnight Fellowship, a ''type of Rhodes Scholarship for Drama stu­dents. It paid for two years of graduate school plus one year con­tract with the Guthrie Theatre. 
He credits Dr. Reginald Bain, of the Speech and Drama Department and the director of ''Hamlet'', for the encouragement needed to try for it and to follow it through despite the likelihood ofhis being drafted. It was also Bain who nominated him. 
Davis wasn't drafted though. Instead, he became a regular mem­ber of the Guthrie. After five seasons there, he moved to New York City in 1075. Three days after his arrival, he got a role in a pilot of "Beacon Hill" on CBS. He currently works out of New York, doing work at nearby theatres such as the Longworth and the Arena. The offer to come back to Notre Dame fit perfectly into a gap in his schedules. He is scheduled to open the dramatic season for the Denver Center of the Performing Arts next month. 
What other reasons brought him back? 
''Specifically Reg Bain. I wanted to work with Reg again. Plus, "pe says as he runs his hand over his head, "I wanted to come back and see what people were domg, how the land lay, Wflat kind of students we were turning out, and how the department

In much of the current rumblings, one detects a lot of accusations that rather uncritically label the adminis­tration "the villains in the piece." But one is not quickly convinced that this comes from well-informed sour­ces. A nagging question persists: Is it not true that the 1dministration leads the way in the struggle to keep Notre Dame Catholic, and, quite frankly, enjoys a better track record than the general faculty in promoting value-oriented education, the neces­sity for service and the enhancement of the total educational experience for students through extra-curricular ac­tivities, hall life, etc.? 
In sum, it is hard to see how we could fail to benefit from rational debate and civil conversation on the many questions before us. I've touched on just some of them, in an attempt to encourage the discussion. But there are others, as well; especially those that pertain to the elements th~t will_be essenti,al for Notre Dame s survival 10 the 80s as a uniquely Catholic university.

getting short shrift.'' 
''The students are always interest­ing to me that God bless their innocence, they just keep rolling along." 
Leaning forward in his chair, he offers this admonition: 
''The Notre Dame imagination is an amazing thing. The students here aren't stupid. You get a basic intelligence here that is quite re­markable.'' 
"There's very often a huge gap between how that's applied to the1r everyday life. It's a sort of turn off of their minds when they ~o to . Goose's, which at a certain ~I of maturity seems to be the a......:tive thing to do and God knows we all do ' it, but I mean it seems to me to be a tremendous amount of it here.'' 
Davis thinks that the student actors here are quite good, but they lack required technical knowledge that a faculty the size of the Speech and Drama Department's is too small to give." 
''There has to be a certain com­mittment, which I fail to see, made by the administration of the schools as to whether or not they want a fine arts program and whether i~'" going to be more than a playground.'' 
He says that another thing that hampers prospective performers here is the number of required courses they must take when they could be takmg more essential drama courses especially during freshman and soph­omore years. The more drama courses one takes, the better chance one will have in graduate school. 
Davis sees the department as being stuck in bureaucratic red tape and second guessing. There is a lack of purpose that, "seems to be every­where else in our society.'' 
''I was hoping that was over when I left here,. I thought that perhaps ­after much chaos some common find would've been established and there would be a single point of view, there would be a dedication by the Univer­sity toward the education of the artist. But I wonder now whether or not once again it seems · to have slipped its · ''·

Irish nine steals grid script 
by Bill Marquard Sports Wnter 
There are some oft-quoted lines used by sportswriters that go something like this. "A good team is one that fights back ... never gives up ... never says die ... doesn't crack under pressure .. '' 
Even baseball philosopher extraordinaire Yogi Berra echoed these sentiments when he remarked, "The game is never over until it's over." 
Well,pardon the redundancy and lack of originality, but the. Irish baseball team fought back, never gave up, never said die and certainly dido' t crack under pressure last weekend.

Despite Indiana loss 
Irish soccer on the ball 
At some point during last Friday's soccer game, it became painfully obvious that Indiana had a better team than Notre Dame. I think it hit me about midway through the first half. 
At the same time, I realized that the Hoosiers were going to win--and they did, 4-0. But, unlike other Irish losses in other games of other sports, this one had its bright spots for incurable Notre Dame rah rahs (like myself.) Because on this da}', the Irish took one giant leap on the !'Occer field, proving there is, indeed, a market tor their product at Notre Dame. 
Over 1,000 people showed up to see them play :ast year's NCAA runners-up, and most of them went away feelirig it was worth going late to happy hour. It was the largest crowd to ever see a soccer game at Notre Dame, and the fan<> were every bit as vocal as any football or basketball cheering section. 
Those who attended saw a surprising first half of soccer which ended with the Hoosiers in f1 om only 1-0. No one was more surprised than the Indiana players themselves, who came to South Bend expecting another easy victory. (I guess winning does make people cocky.) After a parented Rich Hunter pep talk at halftime, Notre Dame applied the pressure and actually had a 
~ chance to tie the score early in the second half, but a goal by Mike Mai was disaHowed because rhe ball had touched his hand. The no-goal call took the wind out of the Irish sails and Indiana proceeded to pour in three more goals before game's end. Even without the red and white uniforms, I could tell that this was a typical Indiana team. 
 They adhered religiously to th~ P,hil?sophy espoused .by the "Happy Hooster htmself, Bobby Kmght-­
"If,ou can't beat 'em, beat 'em up!'' An the Bis Red soccer team procec;:ded to do just that. Wuh just 10 seconds gone 1n ~he first 
r period there was a shot on goal whtch was neatly' collected by Irish goal keeper, Brian Cullather. As Cullather stood up to clear the ball number 20 in red, Armando Bettencourt, rushed in and sent the Norre Dame goalie sprawling the the ground. Of course it wasn't intentional.. . ·

team," Coach Hunter said afterwards. "He 
(Bettencourt) came at our goalie and tackled 
him, which is illegal. And the way he landed, we 
were lucky Brian wasn't hurt." 
Notre Dame was lucky a few more players 
weren't hurt as Bettencourt's "tackle" set the 
tome for the remainder of the game. Both teams 
pushed, shoved and jockeyed for ro<;itions, and 
JUSt to say the game was physica would be an 
understatement. Before It was over, Cullather, 
(who was hit again in the second half) halfback 
Tim Nauman and a few other Notre Dame' 
players had to be helped from the field, 
prompting soccer manager, Doug Collodel, who 
often assists injured players to the bench, to 
point out ''It seemed like l was on the field more 
than the players.'' 

But no excuses--Indiana is a very talented· team. They're one of the "big boys" that the 1979 NCAA Soccer Guide says Notre Dame "Isn't quite ready for yet." (Which is one reason to wonder why they resort to the push-and-shove tactics they showed here on Friday?) The fact that Notre Dame did stay with t11em, allowing onlY. one goal in the first half, indicates that, whtle the Irish aren't one of the "Big boys" yet, they certainly are growing up fast. 
We can only speculate on how well they would do with some scholarship money to attract top prep players to Notre Dame. Indiana gives 15 full rides, while Loyola-Baltimore (who tied the Irish, 2-2, on September 23) hands out 12. If Notre Dame does not follow suit, the program will probably stagnate and never get much better than it is right now. 
I find it hard to believe that Notre Dame would ever be satisfied with being nothing more than a once-a-year pushover for a team like Indiana.

But ~rish coach Tom Kelly looked more realistically at the game. "I was really pleased that the team had enough intestinal fortitude to fight back and win." 
''But my emotions were mixed in that in order to fight back as we did, we had to dig ourselves in a hole to start with. Naturally we're ,Pleased with the outcome, but It was how we got there that m~ttered. '' 
The visiting Crusaders jumped out to an early 2-0 lead in the top of the second, but Jim Montagano's two-run double in the bottom of the third knotted the score.
