Saint Mary's guards female identity 
College has no plans to become co-ed 
By KELLY MEEHAN Saint Mary's Editor 
Strengthened by a $130 mil­lion endowment and an increasingly large applicant pool, Saint Mary's College offi­cials said they have not and will not consider admitting men, despite recent trends across the country to do other­wise. 
Of the 300 all-female institu­tions in the United States in the 1960s, only 60 remain today, according to an article that appeared in The New York Times Sept. 21. 
The interest in women's col­leges among high school grad­uates is dwindling, too -only

Police issue 25 tickets, make 7 custodial arrests 
By KATE ANTONACCI News Editor 
Police issued 22 arrest tick­ets to adults and made seven custodial arrests for misde­meanor violations of liquor laws before and during Saturday's home football game against Purdue University. 
Three additional arrest tickets were issued to juve­niles for alcohol related offenses, such as minor con­suming or minor in posses­sion of alcohol, Associate Director of Notre Dame 
Security/Police (NDSP) Phil Johnson said in an e-mail Monday. Six of the custodial arrests were for public intox­ication and one was for minor in possession of alco­hol. 
Police transported offend­ers to St. Joseph County Jail, Johnson said. 
During the game, 18 people were removed from Notre Dame Stadium for "alcohol related offenses," three were arrested for public intoxica­tion and one was "sent to a local hospital due to intoxica­

Student allegedly assaulted 
Police say suspectfirst harassed woman 
By KATE ANTONACCI News Editor 
Police are searching for a white college-age male who allegedly harassed a female stu­dent and assaulted a male stu­dent early Saturday morning, officials said Monday. 

The man and woman were seated on a bench outside of LaFortune Student Center and Washington Hall at around 1 :40 
a.m. Saturday when they were approached by "three or four college-aged men," said Associate Director of Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) Phil Johnson. 
"One of the men jumped on the bench, straddled the woman and simulated a sexual act," Johnson said. 
When the woman's friend con­fronted the suspect, he was punched several times before the suspect fled north, Johnson said. 
"The male victim was not seri­ously injured and the female vic­tim was not injured," he said. 
Though NDSP responded and searched nearby areas, they were unable to locate the sus­pect. 
The man was described as being about six feet tall with brown medium-length hair, Johnson said. 

"NDSP asks anyone with infor­mation about this crime to con­tact us," Johnson said.

Committee created to address retention 
By KATIE KOHLER 
News Writer 
Roughly 86 percent of Saint Mary's freshmen return to the College for their sophomore year -a retention rate far higher than the 33 percent national average but still in need of improvement, College officials say. 
From spring 2006 to fall 2006, 38 first year students transferred or left Saint Mary's for various reasons, according to the Office of Institutional Research at Saint Mary's. Twenty-five of the 38 trans­ferred to Notre Dame. 
The College recently created a Retention Committee that will address the 85 to 87 percent

Atnid declining sales, panel exatnines ne-wspapers' future 
Some ofnation's top journalists gatherfor Gallivan Program's annualforum; technological advances, Web readership discussed 
By MAUREEN MULLEN 
News Writer 
The future of the daily news­paper is not doomed, as long as those who work for them are willing to change, six jour­nalism professionals said at a panel discussion Monday. 
The forum, hosted by the Notre Dame Gallivan Pro.gram in Journalism, Ethics and Democracy, examined the changes the field of journal­ism has undergone in the 10 years since the Gallivan Program was founded. Panelists also wrestled with what the future might hold for the delivery of daily news. 
Participants in the panels were all members of the 
Gallivan Program's advisory committee and included Dan LeDuc, deputy national editor of The Washington Post; Bill Dwyer, who worked as sports editor for the Los Angeles Times for 25 years; John McMeel, founder and CEO of Andrews McMeel Universal; Bill Mitchell, director of pub­lishing and on-line editor for the Poynter Institute for Media Studies; Anne Thompson, chief financial correspondent for NBC in New York; and Tom Bettag, executive producer of 
Discovery Networks. 
Robert Schmuhl, American Studies department chair and director of the Gallivan Program, began the forum by highlighting the dwindling interest in newspapers during 
the last 10 years, noting that newspaper readership fell from 50 to 40 percent since 1996. 
He posed the question to panelists: "Change ... what on earth will the next decade bring?" 
Panelists spoke about issues of print and broadcast jour­nalism -how the fields have changed and will continue to change as the Internet becomes a major source of information. 
LeDuc said that despite decreasing newspaper sales at The Washington Post -circu­lation has been falling since at least 1996, when readership was more than one million ­

Get rid of 
the fight 

songs CD 
I like to get to the stadium early. 
My usual home game Saturday routine is to watch the band march out and follow it to the stadium, where I can be in my seat about 45 minutes before kickoff 
Chris Khorey
to observe warmups. (If you've never Associate Sports seen Quinn Editor and the receivers toss a ball around with as little pres­sure as your average guys on the quad, try it sometime. They're pretty impressive.) 
However, my enjoyment of this Saturday ritual is tempered by Notre Dame Stadium's insistence on playing a generic fight songs CD on the P.A. before the game. 
While, being a college football geek, I enjoy fight songs, there is no reason for me to walk into Notre Dame Stadium for a game against Purdue and hear "There is no place like Nebraska," "The Minnesota Rouser" or "Hamblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech." 
Non-Darners notice this strange choice of music as well. When I was in high school, I brought a Michigan fan (and now student) friend of mine to a Notre Dame­Navy game. I had no delusions of converting him, but I thought I'd show him what real football atmos­phere looks like. 
As soon as we walked into the stadium he got a dumbfounded look on his face asked, "Why are you guys playing Wisconsin's fight song? Do you even play them?" 
Fortunately, no. But oftentimes, the fight songs CD comes around to our current opponent's tune. Why fire up the visiting fans by playing their fight song over the loudspeak­er? It makes no sense. 
Furthermore, the fight songs CD includes Michigan's "The Victors" and USC's "Fight On," two songs that most people agree should be played as little as possible at Notre Dame Stadium. Yet every week our 
P.A. system belts them out before the game. . 
I haven't even gotten to the worst part yet. The songs on the CD are not only not played by our very own Band of the Fighting Irish, they are played by MICHIGAN'S BAND. I know because, being a col­lege football geek, I own that CD. 
If you don't believe me, listen to the way "The Victors" sounds on it, if you can bear it. It's loud, it's played well and the band sings. 
This travesty needs to end now. For the Stanford game on Saturday, the powers that be in the press box should put a Notre Dame band CD in, playing our numerous school songs on a loop. 
It won't make the stadium partic­ularly intimidating, but at least Purdue fans won't start cheering because of it.

School gives detention to parents of late kids 
NEW YORK-A public school is requiring deten­tion for parents who get their kids to school late. 
Under the new rule at the Manhattan School for Children, parents who don't drop off their chil­dren by 8:25 a.m. have to pick up late slips from the principal's office and go to the auditorium to serve 20 minutes of detention with them. 
"The parents need to make the breakfast, get the children dressed and get them to school on time," principal Susan 
Rappaport told the New York Post for Sunday's editions. 
Some tardy parents at the school, which has 660 pupils in kindergarten through eighth grade, complained the detention made them late for work. But others approved, say­ing they felt humiliated and won't show up late again. 
Woman accused of swinging axe at husband 
LACONIA, N.ll. -A Laconia woman is charged with going after her husband this weekend with an axe. The husband reported that during a heated argument Sunday evening, Linda Masse, 50, chased him through their house with an axe, swung it at him and missed, shattering a glass door. 
He said he went to a neighbor's house for help and that his wife tried to get in, with the axe, but couldn't. She accused of bashing his car, then struggling with police. 
Masse is charged with attempted assault, resist­ing arrest and criminal mischief.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Tae K won Do granted club status 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
Saint Mary's Board of 
Governance members discussed 
campus issues and awarded club 
status to the World Tao Kwon Do 
Federation at their meeting 
Monday night. 
Two weeks ago BOG did not vote on whether it would award club status to the group because mem­~nrs did not feel they had enough information on what role Saint Mary's had in the Notre Dame­
basnd club. 
Members of the club returned 
Monday to clarify that the group 
wanted to be an officially recog­
nized club at Saint Mary's because 
it would provide recognition on 
campus for students who wanted 
to join. 
They also said while they would 
prefer to hold practices on Saint 
Mary's campus, they realize there 
is no facility available on campus 
to practice safely. A'> a result, they 
will continue practicing at Notre 
Dame. 
Tri-campus commissiOner 
Alanna Chiefari said it seemed like 
the group had examined the situa­
tion and motioned to grant the fed­
eration club status. The motion 
was passed. 
In other BOG news: 
+Student body president Susan 
Mcllduff told the board that the 
Regina Hall pool has been perma­
nently closed. 
"[Originally] the pool was going to be reopened, but it wa..o; in such bad condition that to refurbish it [it would cost too much money]," Mcllduii said. . 

Mclldufi also said the abundance of raccoons on campus has been noticed, and is being dealt with. 
"We're hoping if we move the garbage cans, especially the ones by the tennis court and in front of LeMans, that the raccoons may find a new home," she said. 
+Student Services commission­er Kelly Maus reported that she had met with Barry Bowles, the director of Sodexho, the company that provides food service for the College. 
Maus said students are interest­ed in nutrition facts and what is actually in each section of the din­ing hall. 
"There's actually a nutrition counter [online] of everything that the dining hall serves," Maus said. 
On the site, students can make a page laying out everything they have eaten during a week and find out how many calories they ate, among other things. Maus is work­ing to get a link to the Web site on the Saint Mary's home page so that it is more easily accessible. 
Maus also talked to Bowles about the possibility of having alternatives to Dalloway's pasta bar, which was introduced last year. 
"''m going to work with him [to find] options that are feasible for [Sodexho]," Maus said. 
+The Sophomore Oass Board is selling "SMC loves Football" T­shirts at dinner all this week. The shirts cost $5, and sophomore class president Francesca Johnson hopes students will wear the shirts when they go to the Army pep rally that Saint Mary's is hosting.

Squirrel causes power outages 
By KATE ANTONACCI 
News Ediror 

Nearly 50 percent of Notre Dame's campus temporarily lost power Saturday less than one hour before kickoff for the home football game against Purdue. 
American Electric Power (AEP). the public utility company that provides nearly 50 percent of Notre Dame's power, had a failure at a substation on the west side of South Bend caused by a squirrel, Director of Utilities Paul Kempf said. 
A transmission line serv­ing that substation and Notre Dame's substation was opened, which caused the brief outage, Kempf said. 
The power outage began at around 1:45 p.m. and lasted for 15 to 20 minutes, Kempf said. 
Various buildings on cam­pus, including several resi­dence halls and LaFortune Student Center, lost power. Kempf did not have an exact list of affected loca­tions. 
"When such an incident occurs, our service from AEP is interrupted, causing a power outage," he said. "Subsequently, in order to protect the power plant and the balance of the electrical load that it serves, the University must automati­cally shed load [equal to what is lost]." 
Kempf said the outage did not have any effect on scheduled football activities since there are multiple protections on the system to protect Notre Dame Stadium during large events. 
"Our load shedding scheme takes into consider­ation that there is a game and we protect the feeders that serve the stadium," he said. 
Though normally the utili­ties department prioritizes which buildings on campus get power back first ­depending on the time of day, day of the week or spe­cial events -Kempf said there was no need to priori­tize Saturday because it was not a protracted outage. 
AEP has a history of zero to three such outages a year caused by weather or equip­ment failures, Kempf said. 
"The reliability of the 138 kV line that serves the University is very good. as in the recorded history of the line there has never been an outage of the line greater than the reclosure cycle," he said.

Presidential election goes to runoff 
SAO PAULO, Brazil-Former Sao Paulo Gov. Geraldo Alckmin forced a presidential runoff election by capitalizing on Brazilians' anger over scandals that reached ever-closer to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. 
Alckmin -who like Silva spent Monday plotting strategy with his advisers -is now within striking distance of an upset victory Oct. 29. But whether Brazilians are ready to give up on their first working­class president remains to be seen. 
A balding anesthesiologist widely known for sleep-inducing campaign speeches, Alckmin lacks the passion Silva has brought to the job. Nicknamed "chuchu"' -after a flavorless green vegetable -he is strong in Brazil's industrialized south. but has relatively little support among the poor and working classes. 
Man scales Prime Minister's fence 
LONDON -A man who scaled the back fence of Prime Minister Tony Blair's resi­dence on Downing Street was charged Monday with assault on a police officer and possession of a knife, authorities said. 
The 32-year-old man, who was arrested Sunday night, struggled briefly with police before he was pinned and handcuffed, said a Metropolitan Police spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with department policy. 
Police said Byung Jin Lee tried to lunge at an officer but was not wielding the large kitchen knife found in his posses­sion. The man, who has no fixed address, was to appear in court in central London on Tuesday morning.

Supreme Court rejects Nazi appeal 
WASHINGTON -A former Nazi concen­tration camp guard lost a Supreme Court appeal on Monday over the government's decision to revoke his U.S. citizenship. 
Justices declined to review the case of John Hans!, a member of the SS Death's Head battalion that guarded concentra­tion camps at Sachsenhausen near Berlin in 1943 and Natzweiler in France in 1944. 
Hans!, who lives in Des Moines, Iowa, sought to distinguish his case from other former Nazi camp guards by arguing he did not hide his wartime past when he asked for a visa to enter the United States in the mid-1950s or personally assist in persecution. 
Court upholds FBI polygraph test 
WASHINGTON -The FBI and Secret Service may keep using lie-detector tests to screen potential employees, a federal judge ruled Monday. 
U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan's ruling ends a six-year lawsuit brought by six applicants who failed polygraph tests and were denied jobs. They said the policy vio­lated their rights to privacy and due process. 
The Secret Service has required polygraph tests for potential agents since 1985. All FBI employees have been tested since 1994. 
Applicants are asked questions about their medical histories, finances, sex lives, drug use and mental health.

Gunman attacks Amish school 
Truck driver kills three, then himself in one-room Pennsylvania schoolhouse

ICKEL MINES, Pa. -A

stormed a one-room Amish  
schoolhouse Monday, sent

GAZA STRIP 

Renewed battles kill two in·Gaza 
Associated Press 
Gunbattles erupted Monday night between Fatah gunmen and Hamas militiamen in the southern Gaza town of Rafah, killing two people and wounding 14 a day after a deadly explosion of internal vio­lence paralyzed the Gaza Strip. 
The fighting was the latest in a series of sporadic battles over the past two days as tensions remained high between the two groups. Fatah militants enforced a general strike in many West Bank towns in a show of strength against Hamas, while the Hamas­led government ordered all min­
istries closed to protest Fatah attacks on government buildings. 
But there was less violence Monday compared to the chaos and running street battles that killed eight people and wounded 100 others across Gaza a day ear­lier. 
In an effort to reduce friction, Hamas pulled its militiamen out of Gaza's major streets Monday and sent them back to their posts. 
"Gaza today is better, and mov­ing toward calm," Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas told his Cabinet on Monday afternoon, but said he feared violence in the West Bank, where Fatah militants threatened to retaliate for the Gaza fighting. 

"We reiterate to our people to be responsible, not to spread the cir­cle of disagreements and conflict, and not to transfer events to other parts of the nation," Haniyeh said. 
Hours after he spoke, Fatah gun­men marched through Rafah to protest the Hamas-led government and its militia, witnesses said. When they approached a militia post, a gunbattle broke out, and five people were wounded, one seriously, they said. 
The fighting ended after Hamas and Fatah officials called on their supporters to back down.

Retention 
continued from page 1 
retention rate at Saint Mary's by examining the reasons why some students decide to leave before they reach their sopho­more year, said Vice President of Enrollment Management Dan Meyer. 
The Committee will meet at the end of October and, addi­tionally, two or three times each semester, Meyer said. 
'The committee wasn't creat­ed because there is a crisis, but with the caliber of Saint Mary's students, the numbers should be better," Meyer said. "Our goal is 90 percent, which is only about a three point increase." 
This is a much more realistic goal than perfect retention, Meyer said. 
"One-hundred percent [reten­tion] is ideal, but impractical because some students come for the wrong reasons," he said. 
Meyer and the committee will investigate why students leave Saint Mary's, the types of stu­dents who choose to leave and what aspects of the College have a positive impact on retention -which is the hard­est question to answer, Meyer said. 
"We have no good handle yet because the College hasn't bro­ken it down," he said. "This question is the hardest one to answer because the informa­tion is anecdotal." 
Meyer said he does not think there is any correlation between the decreasing num­ber of women's colleges in America and the amount of stu­dents transferring from Saint Mary's. 
"The quality of Saint Mary's students and their capacity to succeed is completely inde­pendent of the shrinking num­ber of single sex schools," he said. 
Still, at a small school like Saint Mary's, losing students from year to year can be espe­cially taxing, Meyer said. 
"Losing women translates into a loss of revenue for the school. It is offset a bit from women transferring in, but it is still a problem," he said. "What is more problematic is that the time and resources used in recruiting the women are lost." 
But Saint Mary's is transfer­friendly, Meyer said. The school welcomed 38 new transfer stu­dents last year alone. One of them was senior Courtney Johnson, who transferred to Saint Mary's last year from Ohio State. What attracted her most to the College was its size. 
"Ohio State was too big and I didn't know my professors. Here, my professors give out their home phone numbers," she said. "[Professors] are so helpful here and I know I am getting a better education." 
lf the College can boost its retention rate -and keep attracting transfer students like Johnson -overall enrollment will increase, which is a long­term goal of College President Carol Ann Mooney's adminis­tration. 
During the next three years, Saint Mary's hopes to increase the student body to 1,600 women. Currently, enrollment is 1,527. 
"If we have three consecutive freshman classes with 400 to 410 women, we will meet this goal," Meyer said. 
"However, we must maintain the retention rate we have now."

FRANCE 
Consortium planned to enrich Iranian uranium 
Associated Press 
PARIS -Iran has proposed that France create a consortium to enrich Tehran's uranium, say­ing that could satisfY internation­al demands for outside oversight of the nudear program. 
Mohammad Saeedi, deputy chief of Iran's Atomic Energy Agency, made the proposal in an interview with French radio in Tehran, suggesting two French nuclear manufacturers as possi­ble partners in the consortium. 
"To be able to arrive at a solu­tion, we have just had an idea. We propose that France create a consortium for the production in Iran of enriched uranium," Saeedi told France-Info in the interview broadcast Tuesday. 
"That way France, through the companies Eurodif and Areva, could control in a tangible way our enrichment activities," he added. 
Areva is a state-controlled company with. activities in sever­al countries. Eurodif has a urani­um enrichment plant in France and has worked with Iran before. 
Neither company could be reached for comment early Tuesday. 
Tehran says it has 50 tons of UF-6 gas, the feedstock for enrichment, in Eurodifs uranium enrichment plant in France but has not been allowed to use it. 
Iran ignored a U.N. Security Council deadline in August to suspend uranium enrichment or face possible sanctions. 
France, a veto-wielding mem­ber of the Security Council, is among countries leading the push to stop Iran's nuclear activi­ties. 

France is also one of the world's most nuclear-dependent countries, relying on atomic reactors for about 75 percent of its electricity. 
Russia sought to defuse the dis­pute with Iran by offering to con­duct all of Iran's enrichment on Russian soil, but Tehran has refused. Moscow says it has worked out a deal with Iran for all the plant's spent fuel to be sent to Russia, eliminating the possibility that Iran could reprocess it for weapons.

IN BRIEF 
Stocks close lower for second session 
NEW YORK -Stocks closed lower for the sec­ond straight session Monday after the Dow Jones industrial average flirted briefly early in the day with its all-time high close. 
After also making an attempt to reach its record trading high of 11,750.28 set in January 2000, the Dow slipped 8.72, or 0.07 percent, to 11,670.35, according to preliminary figures. Broader indexes were also lower. 
On Thursday, and again Monday, the Dow rose above its higest-ever closing level of 11,722.98 before retreating. But trading was volatile as some market players were out for the Yom Kippur holiday; traders said that may have weighed on stocks. 
The markets mostly shrugged off the day's eco­nomic data, which presented a mixed picture of the economy. And stocks were helped, at least initially, by falling oil prices. A barrel of light crude settled at $61.03, down $1.88, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil prices have fallen more than 20 percent since July, helping drive gains in stocks in the third quarter. 
Judge refuses corruption charges 
MONTGOMERY, Ala. -The federal judge who presided over the trial of former Gov. Don Siegelman and ex-HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy refused on Monday to throw out their convictions on government corruption charges. 
U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller ruled there was "substantial evidence" to support the convictions. 
Scrushy's attorney, former state Supreme Court Justice Terry Butts, said he was not discouraged. "There are still a number of different motions the judge has yet to rule on, and we are confident that Richard Scrushy will be vindicated," he said in a statement. 
A jury convicted Siegelman and Scrushy in June of bribery and conspiracy charges after a two-month trial. Prosecutors said Scrushy arranged $500,000 in contributions to Siegelman's campaign for a statewide lottery in exchange for being appointed by Siegelman to a seat on an influential hospital regulatory board. 
Siegelman also was convicted on an obstruction of justice count that did not involve Scrushy. 
Lawyers for Scrushy and Siegelman had asked for the convictions to be overturned, saying there was a lack of evidence. But the judge disagreed.

Holiday sales buzz starts early 
Toy sellers already scramble to get hot toys, apparel stores thinking positively 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -A warning to procrastinators: Better shop early if you want the must-have holiday gifts. 
Already, toy sellers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Toys R Us Inc. and KB Toys Inc., are scrambling to get their hands on more hot toys, particularly T.M.X. Elmo from Mattei Inc.'s Fisher­Price, whose better-than­expected sales are making it increasingly likely to be the must-have toy for the sea­son. 
In yet another encourag­ing sign of consumers' will­ingness to spend, Scott McCall, chief toy officer at Wal-Mart, noted that high­priced toys like $249 red Mustangs under Mattei's Powerwheels brand are sell­ing fast early in the season, something that he hasn't seen in five years.

Bush to address rise in shootings 
President's administration plans to host conference on recent string of violent attacks 
Associated Press 
RENO, Nev. -The Bush administration will host a conference next week to dis­cuss the recent string of school violence across the country, the White House said Monday. 
Presidential spokeswoman Dana Perino said the confer­ence will bring together edu­cation and law enforcement officials to talk about the nature of the problem and federal action that can help communities prevent vio­lence and deal with its aftor­math. 
Three schools have been hit by deadly attacks in the past week. A gunman killed himself and three students Monday at a one-room Amish schoolhouse in Pennsylvania; on Friday a 15-year-old Wisconsin student shot and killed his principal; and last Wednesday a man took six girls hostage in Colorado, sexually assaulting them before fatally shooting one girl and killing himself. 
"The president is deeply saddened and troubled by the recent school violence and shootings that have taken place in different com­munities across America," Perino said. "It breaks America's collective heart when innocent children who are at school to learn are violently taken hostage and cut down in their own schools." 
Perino said the conference was still in the planning stages, so a specific date, location and other details were not ready to be announced. It was not clear 
whether President Bush would attend. 
Education Secretary Margaret Spellings, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Bush's domestic policy adviser, Karl Zinsmeister, met Monday at the White House to discuss the confer­ence. They met while the president was on a cross­country flight to begin a three-day fundraising trip for Republican candidates in the midterm election. 
Perino said participants on the education sid<1 would include groups like the National Parent Teacher Association. school principals and teachers' unions. The Federal Bureau of Investigations would be among those repres<1nting law enforcement, she said. 
Perino said the president plans to use his fundraising spree through Nevada, California, Arizona and Colorado to draw a clear line between Democrats and Republicans, particularly on the war on terror, as the campaign begins its final month. 
Bush began Monday evening at. an airport hangar in Reno, Nev., where a few hundred people who donated a combined $360,000 gath­ered to support Secretary of State Dean Heller's congres­sional campaign. Heller is up against Democrat Jill Derby for the seat being vacated by Hep. Jim Gibbons, who is running for governor. 
"I want you all to remem­ber when you go to the polls here in Nevada, what politi­cal party supported the pres­ident to make sure we have the tools necessary to protect the American people and which political party didn't," Bush said. 
Bush criticized some Democrats for voting against legislation authorizing war­rantless monitoring of phone calls and e-mails to detect terror plots and another bill that would allow_ tough inter­rogation of terror suspects. 
"It sounds like they think the best way to protect the American people is to wait until we're attacked again," Bush said. "That's not the way it's going to be under my administration." 
The donors paid $500 to attend the reception, held on a cement-floored hangar dec­orated with blue curtains, or $2.100 to also be pho-tographed with the president. 


Hepublicans have held the seat since it was created 25 years ago to represent more than 100,000 square miles ­nearly the entire state except for Las Vegas. Republicans hold an edge of more than 4 7,000 registered, mostly rural voters, but polls make it a close race. 
About 100 protesters ral­lied near the fundraiser, chanting, "Vote for change." 
"I think it's an indication of how desperate the Bepublicans have gotten to try to hang onto a seat that just a year ago was consid­ered a slam dunk for the Republicans," said Pam duPre, executive director of the Washoe County Democratic Party.

Disgraced Florida congressn1an replaced 
Foley resigns after e-mail scandal surfaces, now seeks alcohol, behavioral treatments 

Associated Press 
ORLANDO, Fla. Disgraced former Rep. Mark Foley sought treatment for alcoholism and "other behavioral problems" as Republicans on Monday picked a new candidate to salvage the seat Foley aban­doned after disclosure of lurid online messages he exchanged with teenage boys. 
State party leaders chose state Rep. Joe Negron to replace Foley in next month's election. Negron will receive votes cast for Foley, although Foley's name will remain on the ballot in the West Palm Beach district, which is largely Republican. 
"My job beginning immedi­ately is to get word out to all these absentee voters and to everyone else in this race that Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters in Washington. 
The scandal suddenly put Foley's seat up for grabs as Democrats seek a net gain of 15 Republican seats to retake power in the House. Foley, who had represented the district for 12 years, was regarded as a shoo-in for re­election before his resigna­tion. His name was to remain on the Nov. 7 ballot because the deadline had passed for revising the bal­lots. 
At least one prominent Florida Republican expressed pessimism about holding onto the seat. 
"It's a death sentence ... mission impossible," said former state Republican Party Chairman Tom Slade. "The only way you win is they (voters) have got to vote for Mark Foley. That doesn't

"When you account for the new readers that go to Washingtonpost.com there are more people reading Washington Post journalism today than ever before in his­tory," LeDuc said. 
"The newspaper is not dead, but I think they are struggling and trying to fig­ure out their future. I will say that newspapers continue to help set the national news agenda for the country." 
Dwyer agreed with LeDuc, noting that print journalism is experiencing the challenge of "how to marry two worlds" and find a balance between traditional print journalism and continuously updated news on the Internet. 
The future of newspapers, Dwyer said, will be in strengthening the traditional newspaper while simultane­ously investing in the Internet.

Mitchell addressed newspa­per values as a key compo­nent of journalism that he believes must always remain part of the field, regardless of how the news is delivered. 
"Newspaper values are going to be what continue throughout the next 10 years," he said.

"Painfully, the events that led to my resignation have crystalized recognition of my long-standing significant alcohol and emotional diffi­culties," he said. "I strongly believe that I am an alco­holic and have accepted the need for immediate treat­ment for alcoholism and other behavioral problems." 
He added: "I deeply regret and accept full responsibility for the harm I have caused." 
Foley's attorney, David Roth, said Monday that his client checked into a treat­ment center Sunday night,

Foley's e-mails, as is the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Foley, who is 52 and single, could be found to have violated a law that he helped write as co­chairman of the Congressional Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus. 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Monday that GOP leaders did not see Foley's Internet exchanges and that he would have demanded Foley's expulsion if he had known about them. "As a parent and speaker of the House, I am disgusted,"

"I've had pages work in my office for years. I've seen pages go to Washington. I've seen the incredible opportu­nity that is," Negron said, his voice trailing off. He then put his hand over his face and struggled to continue talking. 
"It was very disturbing because I work with these young people," he said. 
The Democratic nominee is Tim Mahoney, a former Republican and financial adviser. He said Monday that his campaign would largely remain unchanged. 
"When people meet me and people know me, whether they're Democrats or Republicans, they get on board," he said. "They know that when I'm in Washington D.C., I'll be no nonsense and 

it's all going to be about results." 
Negron, an attorney who turns 45 next week, joined in the call to investigate who knew about the e-mails and when. Democrats have sug­gested House leaders tried to cover them up for political reasons. 
"We ought to investigate if people knew about inappro­priate, criminal e-mails and didn't take appropriate action," he said. "If that happened, they need to be punished."

Classiealliberalism holds liberty to be the ehief politieal virtue, and over the past two and a half eenturies, the liberal revo­lution has triumphed in the Western world and has made signifi­eant headway in almost every eorner of the earth. The revolu­tion I seek to advanee in this eolumn is the liberal revolution, whieh plaees the liber­ty of the individual first, expands virtue through the free llow of ideas rather than eoereion or indoetrina­tion, demands a minimal, restrained and effeetive government and plaees demands on individuals to pursue soda! justiee out of moral imperative rather than fear of their government. 
The foundation of the United States rests upon dassiealliberal ideas, and Ameriean eonservatism seeks to eonserve and expand the eore principles of the Ameriean liberal revolution. Aeeording to the Oxford Manifesto of the Jjberal International, liberalism seeks a soeiety eharaeterized by frnedom of thought for individuals, limitations on power, espe­eially of government and religion, the rule of law, the free exehange of ideas, a mar­ket eeonomy that supports relatively free private enterprise and a transparent sys­tem of government in whieh the righl<> of all eitizens are proteeted. 
In reeent years, a number of artides have been written lamenting the faet that the term liberal has beeome a dirty word in Ameriean polities. As early as 1988, former president George H. W. Bush deni­grated his Demoeratie opponent Miehael Dukakis, as a "northeastern liberal." Aeeording to Rieh Noyes, researeh diree­tor for the Media Researeh Center, "Reporters sort of agree with Demoerats that liberal is a dirty word, so they get very defensive when the word liberal is used." 
I stand among those who will attempt to

Forward the Revolution 
dear the term of il<> negative eonnota­tions. llowever, the first step I would have to take is to point out how little modern American liberalism has to do with the foundational underpinnings of liberalism as an ideology. I believe that the reason why the term liberal is held in sueh low esteem in this country is because those who wear the badge most proudly have taken up arms against its eornerstones, namely. freedom of thought, the rule of law and the right to own property. 
Liberals at many eollege eampuses aeross the eountry have enaetnd speech eodes whieh suppress or limit student voiees, threatening fines or expulsion for the expression of oflensive ideas. Simultaneously, modern American liber­als have sueeeeded in ereating hate erimes whieh enforee additional penalties on eriminals, not for violent acts, but for their motives f(Jr eommitting those acts. Though we all seek a more respeetful and loving society, penalizing individuals through eoercion for thoughts or words is not eonsistent with an ideology that sup­posedly is first and foremost committed to expanding liberty. 
In addition, the New Deal, the eolleetion of policies implemented by Pn~sident Hoosevelt to combat the Great Depression, is arguably the f(mndation of modern American liberalism. Unfortunately lor liberals of FDR's day, many of the programs of the New Deal were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court beeause they exeeeded the powers given by the Constitution. The New Deal was only upheld in full after President Roosevelt threatened to "pack the eourt" with his supporters. The mod­ern federal welfare state, whieh is the foundation of modern Ameriean liberal­ism, was ereated by eonjuring up a new interpretation of the Constitution, and the theory of the living Constitution was an attempt to justify the praetiee. The rule of law holds that governmental authority is exereised legitimately only in aeeordanee with written and disdosed laws adopted and enforeed aeeording to aeeepted pro­eedure. The theory of the living Constitution, whieh is a pillar of modern Ameriean liberalism, is a threat to the rule of law beeause the Constitution eeas­es to be written or disdosed when it ean be aeeessed only through the endlessly ehanging prognostieations of an elite cadre ofjudges rather than through the document itself. 

Modern Ameriean liberals eonsistently pursue polieies whieh restrain the rights of individuals to engage in private enter­prise and hold property. Right or wrong. most modern American liberals believe that working families whom are better off should be eoerced by the government to transfer funds to other working families who make less. This belief shows up in the New Deal, thP Great SoeiPty and in opposition to welfare reform in the 1990s. Liberalism plaees the responsibility of that aetivity on individuals, and all people have the moral judgment to see that we have an obligation to give more than we ean to our neighbors who are hungry, cold and overworked. Social justiee ean be aehieved by arguing this fundamental truth through a free exehange or ideas. We ean ereate a beautiful eulture of vol­untary saerifiee, where eaeh of us expresses the great love to give up our­selves for our neighbors. However, liber­als ehoose to plaee foreed redistribution of wealth above liberty time and again. 
In short, the term liberal has gained a negative eonnotation in this eountry because modern American liberals have replaeed liberalism's foeus on liberty with a foeus on material equality and intellee­tual uniformity achieved by overpowering individual liberties through eoereion. That is the opposite of liberalism. To those of you who are angry that liberal has beeome a dirty word, eall yourselves pro­gressives or eall yourselves soeialists, but don't eall yourselves liberals. It no longer fits.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Keeping home field advantage 
As I begin my eighth season as the head coach of the women's soccer team here at Notre Dame, I cannot remem­ber a game that I was more proud of our team and student body as I was this past Friday night versus No. 6 ranked West Virginia. The atmosphere was electric, and we had our sec­ond largest attendance ever with 3,056 people watching our 3-1 come-from-behind victory. 
I've always wondered why we haven't been able to get a consistent support from our students here at Notre Dame, but Friday night you all turned out in force. I cannot thank Stanford and O'Neill Halls enough for their unwaver­ing support. You guys were sim­ply amazing! Trust me when I say that your support truly was a huge reason why we were able to fight back and win this game! Don't ever underestimate the impact that fans can make for a home team -and you guys certainly filled the bill. You clearly had the opposing goal­keeper rattled, as evidenced by her performance and actions dur­ing the game! 
Thank you so much on behalf of myself, my staff, and most importantly the team. For the first time they had the opportu­nity to play in front of over 6,000 people during the two games this past week, and we all greatly appreciate it. We have consistently set attendance records for our opposition on the road, being heckled at every stop. It was great to see us set our own records at home, and truly enjoy the home field advantage. 
It's my hope that the excitement created will continue, and that both our great men's and women's programs will start to see this become an event that you, the students, will not want to miss. With deepest gratitude, Go Irish!

Commercial concerns 
I completely disagree with Dr. Mick Connor's letter ("Walk the Walk?" Oct. 1) printed concern­ing the "desperate" housewives commercial aired on ABC dur­ing the Michigan State game. Just because the Notre Dame community of administration, students and alumni did not question an ABC television com­mercial does not indicate that the Notre Dame family is losing its moral values. 
Notre Dame is a unique school in that it prides itself on creat­ing students that desire to make a positive change in their world. I believe that almost every stu­dent contributes their part to create change. Whether they volunteer at a location in the South Bend community, support election issues that they feel support the ND community, or spend a summer or school break doing a service project, students develop positive moral traits that they continue to por­tray throughout their lives after ND. 
It is indeed a reality that the plotlines of modern television entertainment involve themes of deceit, violence and explicit sex­uality. The show that Dr. Connor refers to does involve some of these themes, yet does not remain far away from the majority of television and news programs present in the media today. Just as our parents may have watched murder mysteries 
unfounded 
and soap operas, today's culture may enjoy television shows such as the one advertised in the commercial. 
In fact, while living in my dorm last year, 15 to 20 girls would gather in our social space every Sunday evening to watch the "trash" that Connor believes is displayed by the program. The program conveniently ended right before our dorm's 10 o'clock Mass, to which many of the girls would attend. I high­ly doubt that by watching this fictional show my moral charac­ter, or the moral characters of my classmates, was questioned or compromised. 
If one's moral values could be compromised simply by watch­ing a television program, this could be prevented by simply NOT watching the show. If you do not want your children to be influenced, do not let them watch the program, or ask them to close their eyes during the "trashy" commercial. 
Although I understand that the commercial for this pro­gram, as well as the program itself, may offend some viewers, I maintain the belief that the airing of this commercial had no connection to our University, and was out of Notre Dame's control. The University did not directly endorse or display this commercial and therefore it is not a representation of what it believes. 

ABC understands that people all over the country watch the Notre Dame games, and there­fore this would probably be a perfect opportunity to advertise one of its most popular shows. When I think back to my experi­ence of watching the Michigan State game, I do not think of watching the "trashy" commer­cial. Instead I remember the rollercoaster of emotions I felt as our team made a spectacular comeback to win the game. It is a shame that one could let a sin­gle television commercial spoil an entire experience of watch­ing our team pull through to vic­tory. 
Notre Dame has greater issues to attend to than whining and wasting time complaining about a television commercial. Everyday the university has to make countless decisions to bet­ter the educational and athletic experiences of students at the university. 
To answer Connor's question, yes, we are ND. And we will still be ND, whether we are watch­ing a television commercial or watching our team fight for vic­tory. And yes, we will still be ND as we retain our moral charac­ter and "walk the walk" of posi­tively changing the world.

BooK REVIEW 
Final plays are examined in 'Heart Stoppers' 
Photo courtesy of collegesports.com Ted Mandell's latest book "Heart Stoppers and Hail Marys" examines games whose outcomes depended on a single play, such as the infamous "Bush Push," above. 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Scene Editor 
Written by Notre Dame professor Ted Mandell, "Heart Stoppers and Hail Marys: The Greatest College Football Finishes (Since 1970)" is an interesting and expansive look at more than 100 of the greatest game finishes from the last three decades. 
Originally published in the 1990s, Mandell has updated the volume to include several recent games, including four from the 2005 season -the book ends with the epic 2006 Rose Bowl, in which the Vince Young-led Texas Longhorns defeated the USC Trojans. 
Every chapter in the book is divided in the same way-"The Background," "The Play" and "The Aftermath" ­whieh makes for easy and organized reading. 
Additionally, each chapter has a pull quote of a coach or player involved. Mandell sets up the background infor­mation for the end of the game, then friends will be happy to know that no fewer than eight Irish games are included here, among thei:n the 1988 Miami game, the 1992 "Snow 

Bowl"  and  the  
1980  Michigan  
game.  

Mandell's writ-
talks about the individual play that won {or lost) that game. The book then discusses how each team finished and what effect that particular game had on the team in question. "lleart Stoppers and Hail Marys" is obviously well researched, as it is l'illed with quotes and anecdotes that embellish the games themselves. 
"Heart Stoppers and Hail Marys" starts at 1968 and concentrates on fin­ishes that can be broken down to a sin­gle play, which means great games like 1971 Nebraska-Oklahoma, 199:~ Notre Dame-Florida State and 1998 Arkansas-Tennessee aren't included. In a nice touch, the volume includes not only Division 1-A, but also Division 1-AA (including some Ivy League games, like the 1968 match-up between Harvard and Yale) through Division Ill. 
Yet many of these games are going to be very familiar to college football fans, including the 1984 Miami­Nebraska Orange Bowl, the 1980 BYU­SMU Holiday Bowl and the 2003 Ohio State-Miami Fiesta Bowl. 
Notre Dame 

The quips of John Madden, the antics of Lee Corso and the wisdom of Tony Kornheiser make us laugh, make us cry and sometimes make us turn away in dis­gust. But who can deny that every one of those guys up there knows exaetly what he is doing (except maybe Brent Musburger)? 
The diversification of football anchors ranges from the goofy looking but eloquent (Kornheiser) to the guy we think knows noth­ing at all but some­times surprises us with a little gem ofself­dPprication {Davie) to that crazy guy who grunts when he's try­ing to sing fight songs (could it be anyone but Corso?). 
Attitude differences aside, one ofthe more notable methods implemented by networks to make sure not every sports­caster sounds exactly the same, and that the games aren't being called by Stephen Hawking (no offense to the man, but we're not watehing physies eontests), is to bring in retired players and coaches. 
Now, so the logic goes-who knows the game better than those who have played and coached? Well, the logic contains a few issues that ESPN and others don't seem to be addressing. One, not every player has been trained in the fmc art ofeloquence. Now, Madden got lucky and turned his painfully apparent statements into a shtick that's brought him video game contracts and a nice little job in the broadcast booth. 
However, Sunday ESPN commentator

and former Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin remains misunderstood with a phono­graph horn and the volume set at 50. He may have been fine at catching receptions (and getting into to trouble), but when it comes to sports atmouncing, he just does­n't have what it takes. 
He's a former pro-bowler who played for "America's team," so he gets a spot, but when stacked up against a guy who's been in the business for over 20 years (Chris Berman or Mark May, take your pick), the glaring differences become apparnnt. 
Coaches, it seems. have some trouble adjusting from calling the plays on the finld to describing the plays in the press box. I'm sorry. Bob Davie, the press box is not the same as the field or your living room. 
This former Irish coach offers up nuggets like, "Looking at Charlie really makes me want to get back into eoaehing, but when I look at John L. Smith I think twice ... ha ha ha," in reference to the end of this year's Michigan State-Notre t)ame game. 
While I may not quote accurately, the point is that this guy may have known how to run a defense, but when it comes to run­ning commentary, his abnormally deep voice just doesn't cut it. He knows football, but doesn't know how to discuss it on TV 
With Davie in the middle ofwhere I think most sports analysts are, neitlJer horrible nor very good, we see the two ends of the spectrum -Kornheiser and Corso. The former is an award winning sports journal­ist while the other came out ofcoaching. The differences speak for themselves. Kornheiser may look goofY and may be balding, but when he opens his mouth, solid analysis is what you get and antics are not. 

courtesy msnbcmedia.msn.com Commentators Tony Kornheiser, left, Mike Tirico, center, and Joe Theismann discuss an NFL broadcast. Their remarks and antics range from intelligent to unnecessary. 
Well, that's boring, right? Wrong! Who doesn't love ESPN's "Pardon the Interruption?" Here's a show that eneour­ages Kornheiser, along with fine co-host Michael Wilbon. Intelligent antics are a valid part of "Pardon the Interruption." 
On the other side is Corso, with his hats, his yelling and his changing ofsides -and none of it ever makes much sense. Etched into my brain is the image ofCorso wear­ing an Irish Guardsman hat before the Georgia Tech game, attempting to sing our fight song. 
And this isn't just a personal matter. Corso does it every Saturday, yelling crazily while Kirk Herbstreit tries to say something about the upcoming game that makes some semblance ofsense. 

So in the end, I suggest that they bring in more journalists that know what they're talking about, while keeping a smattering of former stars and coaches. Sports TV is turning into a retirement plan where old players and coaches are put to pasture. They need some new blood that can be both funny and informative. And sure, some off the wall shtick is fine, but Corso ­stop being a moron.

ing is simple and easy to follow. His deseriptions of' the game are well-done and the background information is ample. It seems a bit odd to read descriptions of a sport that is so visual, but the book is sufficient as a reference and makes for interesting reading on its own. 
One of the best aspects of the volume is the inclusion of a pair of COs, which feature many of the original calls from the game. Some of these are famous already, like Flutie's Hail Mary {"He did it! He did it! Flutie did it!"), which was recently featured in a Wheaties com­mercia), or Joe Starkey's call of "The Play" ("The band is on the field!"). The CDs make for fun and, in a way, brings back memories of pre-ESPN days when radio was primarily how sports fans got their fix. 

"Heart Stoppers and Hail Marys" is a fun book and an excellent reference for college football fans. The $25 price tag is a bit much, but it makes a great gift for anyone interested in the sport.

RESTAURANT REVIEW 
Dominic's proves itself a tasty new pizzeria 
By SHELDON DUTES 
Scene Writer 
Whoever invented the concept of serv­ing triangular shapes of bread topped with marinara sauce and gooey moz­zarella cheese is an innovative genius worthy of homage from all college stu­dents. 
Because whether it's eaten as a meal or late night snack, pizza has always been a classic staple item in college stu­dent diets. 
From late night pizza binges at LaFortune to the gamut of pizza joints around town, students are all familiar with the food's ubiquity in their own col­lege experience. Now, there's one more pizza. restaurant to add to the list ­Dominic's Pizzeria. 
With an ideal location near campus on the corner of Edison and State Road 23, the restaurant has student friendly prices and appetizing, quality pizza, Dominic's Pizzeria has the potential to rise above its competitors and become a Notre Dame student favorite. 
Dominic's opened its doors to the pub­lic the same weekend Notre Dame defeated Penn State and is still ironing out a few of their debut kinks. 
While pizza prices are reasonable ($14.95 for a large 18 inch cheese pizza plus an additional $2 student discount as well as NY slices for $2.50), Dominic's is not going to be your stereotypical college pizza place. The restaurant closes at midnight and it doesn't deliver, so don't look to Dominic's to satisfy any late night cravings. 
However, don't write the pizzeria off just yet. Even though it hasn't actively advertised to students, Dominic, the head pizza chef, says that he is willing to run student special ads in campus publica­tions. 
In addition to the student friendly prices, the menu's simplicity is particu­larly attractive. Traditional pizza, appe­tizers and drinks are the menu's only featured items. 
Dominic's delicious pies range in sizes of small ($8.95), medium ($12.95) and large ($14.95) with traditional toppings for an extra $1.50. 
While customers wait for their pizza they can sip on a Pepsi fountain drink for approximately $2. They can also munch on a small variety of appetizers, includ­ing breadsticks and mozzarella sticks, which cost about $6. 
Dominic, the head chef and owner, really knows pizza. Dominic has been making pizzas since he was 11 years old and his pizza making expertise definitely shows in his pizza's palatable quality. All of the ingredients and pizzas are fresh, made to order and baked in a traditional pizza oven. 
The crust is thin and crisp, but not so fragile that it folds under the pressure of sauce, toppings and mozzarella cheese. As compared to other pizzas, Dominic's sauce is definitely fresher. 
The pizza is neither drenched with marinara, nor is the sauce sparsely spread. Dominic, instead, spreads just the right amount of sauce to accentuate the pizza's overall flavor. 
The mozzarella cheese is melted to a gooey perfection with just the right gold­en brown tint. Another distinguishing characteristic of his pizza is that any top-pings are underneath the cheese, which blankets the toppings from sliding off of the pie. 

There's something missing in the restaurant's ambiance -it's not homey and welcoming. Decoration is at an aus­tere minimum, leaving a few walls stark white and uninviting. There are approxi­mately ten tables with four uncomfort­able straight back chairs at each. These shortcomings, however, can all be resolved with time.

CD REVIEW 
Wire's 'Pink Flag' shines in new re-release 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 
Almost three decades after its original release, Wire's first trio of albums has been re-mastered and re-released. Marked by arty minimalism, Wire, in its initial incarnation, inlluenced the direction of post-punk throughout the 1980's. The band's first album, "Pink Flag," remains its best.. sounding just as fresh and weird today as it did in 1977. 
Comprised of Colin Newman (vocals, gui­tar), Bruce Gilbert (guitar), Graham Lewis (bass) and Hobert Gotobed (drums), Wire originally formed while the band members were art school students in England. Appropriately, the band's brand of rebel­lion is not typical punk, incorporating artsy. abstract elements into the music and design, as evidenced by the cover, which (appropriately enough) features a pink !lag. 
The songs themselves are brief, busy and bizarre. "Pink Flag" rips through 21 songs in about 37 minutes, with several pieces clocking in less than 60 seconds ­in fact, only a pair of tracks (the title track and "Strange") last longer than three min­utes. 
The art influence is obvious throughout, with song titles like "Field Day for the Sundays" and "Three Girl Rhumba." Like their contemporary, Joy Division, few of Wire's songs (at least at this stage) actually fmish. Instead, they just end abruptly. · 
Many of them only incorporate a single rill' or vocal line, though lyrics like "Prices have risen since the government fell/Casualties increase as the enemy shelVfhe climate's unhealthy, flies and rats thrive/And sooner or later the end will arrive" are far more eloquent than the "I wanna be in anarchy" rage being spewed by Wire's contemporaries. 
Indeed, the biggest and most noticeable difference between Wire and other bands in the initial punk explosion is attitude. In stark contrast to The Clash's bristling self­righteousness or The Sex Pistol's vitriolic anarchism, Wire is cold and distant. 
The stylistic tendencies, which favor minimalism and artiness, give the album a detached feeling -.an art school version of "The Ram ones."

undoubtedly influ­entia!, sounds badly outdated today. Music by bands like Gang of Four and Television hasn't stood up quite as well as "Pink Flag," which is a testament to how ahead of its time (or at the very least, out of step with the times) Wire was in its day. 
Wire's influence has been most obvious in the number of covers performed by other bands. REM took the eerie, creeping "Strange" and turned it into a party song 
. on "Document," Minor Threat performed a roaring version of "12XU," My Bloody Valentine turned "Map Ref. 41 N 93 W" into a shoe-gazing mood piece, and Elastic's "Connection" is almost exactly the same as "Three Girl Rhumba."

While the ambiance and student appeal need some serious work, the pizza's deli­cious quality definitely redeems the restaurant. 
Dominic's Pizzeria appears to be more of a relaxed place to grab a slice with friends and enjoy each other's company. With the remedy of a few minor debut details, it could be well on its way to becoming a popular student choice for quality pizza.

the movement's initial explosion, ranking right up there with "Never Mind the Bullocks" and "The Clash." Wire helped bridge the gap between punk and post­punk over the course of its next two albums ("Chairs Missing" and "154," respectively), but its debut remains its high point. 
Wire may have had individual moments better than those on "Pink Flag," but the band never again equaled its cohesiveness or compulsively listenable sensibility. "Pink Flag" is a great album made better by this re-mastered reissue.

A year after being swept out of the playoffs by the St. Louis Cardinals, the NL West champi­on Padres get another shot at Chris Carpenter and the NL Central champions. This time, the first two games will be. at Petco Park, starting Tuesday afternoon. If needed, Game 5 also will be played here. 
"You know, we need to get the series off to a good start these first two games and hopefully get into St. Louis with a chance to clinch it," Peavy said Monday after the Padres held a workout at their downtown ballpark. 
Besides the 1984 World Series, the Padres have never started a postseason series at home. 
They'd love to follow the script the Cardinals used in sweeping the Padres twice since 1996 in the division series -win two at home, then clinch on the road. Last year the Cardinals pummeled their for­mer teammate Woody Williams in Game 3 at Petco Park. In 1996, Brian Jordan made a spectacular diving catch in the eighth inning of the third game, then hit a two-run homer off Trevor Hoffman in the ninth, with the ball landing in a palm tree beyond the left-field fence. 

A year ago, besides having a much better team, the Cardinals benefited from Peavy pitching with two broken ribs. Peavy hurt himself when he jumped on Hoffman's head while celebrating the Padres' division title several days earli­er, then fell behind 8-0 in the playoff opener. 
Peavy, who's been prone to freak injuries the last two sea­sons, said he's healthy. 
''I'm feeling a lot better than I was last year," the 25-year-old right-hander said. "You know, no excuses. This time out I feel as good as I've felt all year. The first half was a bit of a struggle, but the second half, I've been healthy, making my starts with­out any interference physical­!y. " 
Or at least the Padres hope. 
"With Jake, we always wait until right before the game to make sure he's OK," manager Bruce Bochy said. 
Peavy was an uncharacteris­tic 11 "14 with a 4.09 ERA this season. His unsightly numbers were due in part to shoulder tendinitis early in the season and a lack of run support from an offense that's prone to disap­pearing at inopportune times. 
The Padres are used to doing things the hard way. It took them until the final inning of the regular season to clinch their second straight division title, benefiting from a strange play at Arizona. 
They'll take it, though, espe­cially since it means playing in front of the home fans who got all revved up just more than a week ago cheering Hoffman as he tied and then broke Lee Smith's all-time saves record. 
"You start the playoffs with a team like St. Louis last year, and you walk into the ballpark to a sea of red, and already right there it's an advantage for the home team," said Dave Roberts, the Padres' leadoff hit­ter and left fielder. "We expect the same for us this year." 
San Diego is in the playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time ever. It's also trying to win a game in October for the lirst time since winning the 1998 NL pennant. San Diego was swept by the New York Yankees in the 1998 World Series, missed the playoffs for six straight seasons, then was swept by St. Louis last year. 
For most of the season, the Padres played better on the road than at spacious Petco 


Park, where drives that would be homers at other ballparks are just long outs. But the Padres played much better dur­ing their last four homestands. 
St. Louis, on the other hand, looks at lot like the Padres did last year. The Cardinals lost front-line players to injuries and were 83-78, losing nine of their last 12 as they backed into their third straight division title. 

"It's tough," said shortstop David Eckstein, who's been bothered by a strained left hamstring. "You want to play well and unfortunately we did­n't play that good of baseball. It's one of those things that happened but the bottom line is we were able to come through in the end."

NBA 

Pacers show spirit at media day 
An optimistic Indiana hopes new attitude will lead to success 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -In a moment that captured the Indiana Pacers' new attitude, Stephen Jackson interrupted coach Rick Carlisle's Media Day press conference, hugged him and sat by his side to answer questions. 
That's the same Jackson who constantly argued with officials last season, com­plained when Carlisle took him out of games and said he didn't care whether the Pacers traded him. 
Jackson claims he's changed, and the Pacers hope his impromptu gesture on Monday symbolizes what awaits a team that has strug­gled to find good chemistry since the brawl with Detroit Pistons fans two years ago. 
"Coach is walking around like it's Christmas right now," forward Jermaine O'Neal said. "It's a different feel." 
The Pacers made signifi­cant changes after finishing with a 41-41 record and a first-round playoff loss. They drafted forward Shawne Williams and added forward James White in a draft-day trade. Then, they traded for forward Marquis Daniels and picked up free agent forward AI Harrington. In all, 12 of the 19 players who will arrive at Tuesday's training camp are new. 
"This new group of guys, they're extremely hungry," O'Neal said. "I think every­body's looking to really prove something this year."

But Carlisle knows that words don't change the standings. 
"Talk is cheap," Carlisle said. "You've got to walk the walk and do what you say you're going to do." 
The Pacers' planned shift to an up-tempo offensive approach has created pre­season excitement. The slow halfcourt offense will be replaced by a more open style and Indiana will apply 
more  ball  pressure on  
defense.

philosophy led finishing fourth several players Pacers forward in the Eastern 
to come back in better shape. O'Neal has trimmed down his upper body and improved his leg strength. Point guards Jamaal Tinsley and Sarunas Jasikevicius and center David Harrison returned in better shape than last year. 
Indiana's new style could create some odd lineups. Harrington, at 6-foot-9 and 245 pounds, could be called on to play center at times. 
"I don't want to play center, but whatever it takes for me to win, I'll do," he said. "If it causes me to play Shaq and all those guys, I guess I'm going to start eating and get out there and get it done." 
Then, there's O'Neal's hair­style as the 27-year-old exchanged his signature cornrows for a brush cut. 
"I just wanted to see some­thing different," he said. "New style, new everything."

"Nobody's even talking about us making any noise this year," Harrington said. "I think that's disrespectful. There's a lot of guys here with a lot of pride and they know how to play the game. They just have to prove it." 
Jackson thinks the over­sight might be a blessing. 
"We've been kind of paci­fied, kind of spoiled the past few years," he said. "We need to start off as under­dogs and we need to play that way." 
Bonds is back with the San Francisco Giants next season, and that still seems to be a big if, owner Peter Magowan said the slugger will not be the cen­terpiece of the roster any longer.· 
"I think we need to go in a new direction," Magowan said Monday after the club announced manager Felipe Alou's contract would not be renewed. "We have for a long time had a strategy that has worked well until the last two years, when it hasn't worked so well. The strategy has been one of having a great player ­maybe the greatest player in the game -at the centerpiece and filling in with veteran play­ers. 
"For a long time that worked well. It caught up with us the past couple of years. Now we do need to get younger and healthier." 
The Giants have 11 potential free agents and were still in the process of evaluating who they might want to retain ­and Magowan made it clear No. 25 wouldn't be wearing a Giants uniform in 2007 just to attract fans at the team's waterfront ballpark. 
"It's a tough decision, but the decision's going to be made on what gives the Giants the best chance to win," Magowan said. "It's not going to be made on what gives the Giants the best chance to fill up a ballpark on some marketing situation. I feel the best marketing is to win. 
"Whether Barry fits into that plan or not will depend on baseball evaluations of whether he will be able to give has said he would like to return to the Giants for a 15th season -2007 would be his 22nd in the big leagues. 

Bonds has 734 home runs, 22 from breaking Hank Aaron's career record of 755, and is eligible for free agency after the World Series. After missing all but 14 games in 2005 fol­lowing three operations on his right knee, Bonds batted .270 with 26 homers and 77 RBis in 367 at-bats in 2006. 
"The biggest question is what kind of team we can have with him or without him," general manager Brian Sabean said. "Some of what you have to determine, Barry aside, is how are you going to build your ros­ter?" 
Sabean said a cleanup sur­gery on Bonds' left elbow to remove bone chips was "pend­ing." Bonds expected to get it done sometime this week. 
Also, Mark Sweeney was scheduled to undergo an arthroscopic procedure on his left knee soon and minor league pitcher Merkin Valdez had reconstructive "Tommy John" surgery on his elbow last week and won't pitch next sea­son, Sabean said. 
Starting pitcher Matt Morris, who went 10-15 with a 4.98 ERA in his first season with the Giants, pitched since August with a fractured rib on his right side and a stress reaction in two other ribs on either side. Simple rest should be all Morris needs to be ready come spring training. 
"Matt Morris doesn't want to use this as an excuse for his performance," trainer Stan Conte said Monday.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL 
Pyros' playoff hopes on the line against Lyons 
Undefeated Welsh Family faces biggest test of the season as it takes on a powerful Chaos defense tonight at 8 p.m. 
By JOHN TIERNEY and BILL BRINK Sports Writers 
Pasquerilla East and Lyons are entering their final game of the season tonight at 9 p.m. on Riehle Field West with very different goals. 
The Pyros need a win to secure a playoff berth, while the Lions are playing for pride and looking to avoid fin­ishing with a winless regular season. 
Pasquerilla East rode early offensive aggressiveness and late defensive toughness to a 13-12 win Sunday over then­undefeated Cavanaugh ­keeping its playoff hopes alive in the process. Meanwhile, the Lions were eliminated from any postseason consid­eration with a 14-0 loss to Walsh. 
Pyro captain Molly Fox believes her team's victory was no fluke, but rather a sign of more success to come. 
"We're a young team and we needed experience, which unfortunately came during the season, but we still have time to get to the playoffs," she said. 
Fox believes Pasquerilla East was able to hit its stride late this season due in part to the team's exemplary work ethic. The squad had three 7 
a.m. practices last week in addition to four team meet­ings. 
"I definitely think that after [these practices and meet­ings] with our coaches some­thing clicked for us," Fox said. 
The Pyros and the Lions are both young and inexperi­enced, but full of potential. 
"They're a well-coached team with talent, that, like us, hasn't been able to capitalize on it," Fox said. 
While Pasquerilla East enters the game hoping for a win to make the playoffs, Lyons just wants to have a good time. 
"We understand that win­ning is great, but it's just a game and the main reason we play is to have fun," Lyons captain Cheron Wilson said. "As long as we have fun, we can't get too down," 
Lyons will battle Pasquerilla East with a Blue League play­off berth on the line for the Pyros at 9 p.m Tuesday at the Riehle West fields. 
Walsh vs. Badin 
Tonight's game is loaded with playoff implications. 
Badin and Walsh -both with 2-2 records -have the opportunity to vault into sec­ond place tonight at 7 p.m. on Riehle West field with a win and a Cavanaugh loss. 
After starting the season with a win, Badin lost consec­utive games to Cavanaugh and Welsh Family and was in danger of falling out of the race. But a 13-7 win over Lyons Sept. 26 put the Bullfrogs right back in con­tention. 
Quarterback Katie Rose 
Hackney leads Badin's potent offense. She's a quick, versa­tile player who also plays defense and returns kicks. With her in the backfield and talented wide receivers Courtney Rains and Lizzi Shappell split out wide, Badin should test Walsh's stingy sec­ondary. 
But Walsh captain Mary Claire Sullivan is not fazed. 
"We're not worried about Badin," Sullivan said. "We'll do what we know how to do, and worry about what we can control." 
Badin won't be able to pass on offense and force the issue on defense as easily as it did against Lyons, when it was able to shut down an option attack and force the pass. Badin took advantage of mis­matches on defense and Hackney's scrambling ability and was able to put together some nice scoring drives. 
Although they outplayed the Lions, the Bullfrogs only won 13-7, and one of their touch­downs came on a tipped pass that was intercepted and returned for a touchdown. 
They will need a better showing against Walsh, a team that has matured as the season progresses. 
"We're starting to gel on offense and defense," Sullivan said. "We have a lot of talent, and we're coming together." 
Walsh has also lost to both Cavanaugh and Welsh Family, but has very convincing wins over Lyons and Pasquerilla East. Against the Pyros, 
Walsh registered seven inter­ceptions, including four by Wild Women safety Julie Campbell. This secondary will hope to shut down Hackney and the Bullfrog passing game as it has done in their last two games. 
"It's not a matter of any­thing not working -it's just been a matter of time," Sullivan said. 
Welsh Family vs. Cavanaugh 
A matchup between two of the two best teams in the Blue League should prove exciting. 
Welsh Family plays Cavanaugh tonight at 8 p.m. on Riehle West Field in a game that could determine the outcome of the Blue League standings. Welsh Family (4-0) is currently in first and Cavanaugh is in sec­ond (3-1). 
If Welsh Family wins, it will take an undefeated record and the top seed into the playoffs. Cavanaugh beat both Badin and Walsh -so even if it loses it will remain in sec­ond. However, a win will push the Chaos past the Whirlwinds into the top spot. 
The crucial factor of the game for the Chaos will be stopping Welsh Family quar­terback Jenni Gargula's high­powered Whirlwind offense. Gargula, who has a strong arm, great pocket presence and a talented group of receivers, can complete the short pass underneath as well as the deep route. 
Chaos captain Kerri Bergen knows how important defense will be in this game. 

"We need to make big plays on defense, and not allow any big pass plays," Bergen said. "We play zone defense. We'll cover the deep zone and watch for crossing routes. Lots of talk on defense is important. We need cummuni­cation between players about what routes they're running." 
Welsh Family is a great ball control team, sustaining long drives and keeping the clock running. If Cavanaugh exe­cutes on offense, however, that advantage may be less­ened. 
"We need to push the ball hard on offense," Bergen said. "Our offense has been doing very well, both running and passing, and we want to keep that through to this game." 
The Whirlwinds defensive line that has wreaked havoc in the backfield and pres­sured quarterbacks to throw early all season will be a strong challenge to the Chaos offensive line. In order to avoid getting bogged down by Welsh Family's strong defense, Cavanaugh will need to get its offense running early. 
"We need to be really aggressive, and get out and not wait to get in the game," Bergen said.

Two possessions later the Green Wave tied it up on anoth­er miscue. Siegfried was forced to punt deep in its territory after a three-and-out. Tlw punt was blocked and returned for a touchdown by Fisher freshman Bill Whitaker. 
On the first play of the next drive, Siegfried lost a fumble, setting up the Green Wave with good field position. 
Fisher appeared to have capi­talized by scoring on the ensuing drive but the touchdown was called back due to a personal foul. Unfazed, Rabil dropped back and throw a 25-yard strike to put the Green Wave up 14-7. 
Fisher punted on its opening drive of the second half, but was able to recover the ball after it was muffed by the Hamblers' punt. A five-play, 25-yard drive was capped with a five-yard touchdown run by Fisher tail­back Tom Jlessert, putting Fisher up by 14 and ending Siegfried's dreams of a come­back. 
Mistakes aside, the most deci­sive part of the game may have been the play in the trenches. Fisher captain Tom Bufalino was confident that the oll"ensive and defensive lines would perform well, and his comments were justified by Sunday's play. 
"We played pretty well. We got down early but we came back." he said. "The second score to take the lead was a huge momentum shift. Both lines played very well again today. It was a good victory," 
Fisher head coach Ryan Bradel agreed that the linemen were crucial to the Green Wave win. 
"The key to this as the Morrissey defense con­stantly harassed Garigliano and the Big Red offense for the rest of the afternoon. 


Led by defensive end Joe Gemino, the Manorites brought immense pressure, resulting in numerous quarterback hurries and several sacks. On Dillon's next possession, Morrissey freshman Mikey Narvaez inter­cepted Garigliano 's pass attempt to again kill any offensive effort Dillon could muster. 
But Dillon's defense held and forced a fourth-and-eight. After Manorite coach Ryan Burnt decided to go for it, McBrayer more than converted for Morrissey. He found an open receiver for a 26-yard touch­down strike to increase the Morrissey lead to 14-6. 
Dillon then pieced together a solid drive, including a 20-yard run by Garigliano and comple­tions to Big Red freshmen Brian Coughlin and Chris Cugliari. The Big Red were on the Morrissey 8 yard line, but the Morrissey defense stiffened and intercept­ed Garigliano's pass in the end zone to end the half with the Manorites leading 14-6.

Fisher will look to continue its winning ways against Sorin next Sunday while Siegfried will try to bounce back against Zahm. 
Keenan 10, O'Neill 0 
Keenan running back Alex Gonzalez broke free for an 89­yard touchdown run early in the third quarter to seal the game for the Knights, who held off previously unbeaten O'Neill. 
But there was little other offense outside the touchdown run. 
Besides Keenan's lone 27 -yard field goal, the first half was a tough defensive struggle. 
Keenan showed its defensive strength by intercepting two of Angry Mob quarterback Chris Stroh's passes. 
O'Neill returned the favor by picking off one of Knights quar­terback J.J. Vega's attempts as well as sacking the Keenan sig­nal caller. The half ended with the 3-0 Keenan lead, and both teams looked to make some adjustments. 
''They put a lot of guys in the box." Keenan coach Richard Grant said. "We made some adjustments to counter the pres­sure they were bringing." 
Both teams continued to be defensively strong in the second half. 
O'Neill intercepted a ·Vega pass, returning it 28 yards to the Keenan 49 yard line. After the Keenan defense held O'Neill to no gain on their first three plays and the Angry Mob were foreed 
outs, the Angry Mob was stopped short as the Knights defense came up with yet another big play. 
The defensive line, anchored by fifth-year senior Hal Munger, sacked Stroh as time expired. Munger was a menace for the O'Neill offensive line all day as he constantly led an aggressive Keenan defense in pressuring Stroh. 
"We worked hard this week to put a lot of pressure on their passing game, and our defensive backs did a nice job in the sec­ondary," Munger said. 
Keenan will look to continue its undefeated season next week against Stanford while O'Neill will regroup with a bye week. 
Morrissey 22, Dillon 6 
Morrissey quarterback Joe McBrayer connected with sopho­more Carl Andersen early in the first quarter for a 65-yard touch­down in a rout of winless Dillon Sunday. 
After a successful extra point attempt by Morrissey kicker Dan Kaesa, the Manorites -and especially their defense -con­trolled the tempo for the remain­der of the game. 
Dillon was looking for its first win of the season, and the team seemed in prime form during its first possession. After a series of runs, including a 22-yard dash by sophomore Alex Duffy, the offense moved the ball swiftly down the tield and capped the drive with a 1-yard run by quar­terback Joseph Garigliano. 
The extra point attempt was then blocked, and Dillon would never reach the end zone again

yards on the day. On the most promising Stedsmen possession of the game, Carroll defensive back Ryan Frost intercepted the pass and returned it 31 yards for the game's fmal score. 
Carroll head coach Mark Bennett was pleased with his team's performance in the win. 
"We saw this game as a must­win," Bennett said. "Our starting QB and our starting middle line­backer were both out, but the team really came together in their absence. 
"We went out and played hard, riverboat gambler mentality. However, we have to improve if we're going to make it to the sta­dium," he said. 
Carroll will face Knott Sunday while St. Ed's has a bye. 
Fisher 21, Siegfried 7 
Sunday's afternoon battle between Fisher and Siegfried showcased of two of the league's top teams that ended up being separated by their in-game mis­takes. 
The first of these mistakes came on the Green Wave's first drive when Fisher quarterback Kevin Rabil was picked off by the Ramblers secondary. Siegfried· capitalized on the turnover with an 18-yard touch­appearedto be to control the ball and run the football to eat up the clock. After recovering a Dillon fumble, Morrissey junior Nick Bencomo capped off a Manorite drive with a 3-yard burst into the end zone. 
After another Garigliano pick, Manor freshman Brian Pieh's runs gave Morrissey first and goal on the 2-yard line. But the tenacious Dillon defense denied Morrissey four times in a tough goal line stand. 
The Big Red, however, promptly fumbled a pitch in the end zone, resulting in a safety that effectively ended the game. 
For Morrissey captain Gemino, it was more than just a great effort. 
"It's a team game -we work hard and we are proud to play for Morrissey and look forward to continuing this success," he said. 
Dillon (0-3) will continue its quest for its first win next week­end against Alumni while Morrissey (2-0) squares off against Keough.

attempt, put the Pyros up 13-0. 
The Chaos offense was largely limited to the scrambling of quarterback Katie Dunn, who had 5 rushes for more than 15 yards each. Cavanaugh was plagued by dropped passes throughout the game, an issue the coaching staff tried to address at half time. 
Dunn led her team to two touchdowns, but it was not enough to lead the Chaos to vic­tory. After scoring the second touchdown in the second half to pull to a 13-12 deficit, Cavanaugh opted to go for two points and the lead over going for one point and the tie. However, a Dunn pass was tipped and broken up by the Pyro defense, which came through in the clutch through­out the second half. 
Entering the game, Cavanaugh was the runaway favorite to dominate.

The second half was all Howard. The Duck defense sti­fled the Shamrock offense, not allowing a single first down. 
"Our defense played amazing today -you can't really ask any more from them," said Ketchum, who, in addition to her touchdown run, had a great game throwing the ball and led a balanced offensive attack. "The 0-line and the receivers showed up to play today -they really made my job easy," she added. 
Howard sealed the deal with three minutes remaining on a Beth Gribble touchdown run. The conversion was no good, but the game was still put out of reach at 20-0.

And Slaggert not only looked, but convinced the elite prospect to join Gaul and a superb six­man recruit class for 2007-08 and an Irish program that is in the early stages of a complete overhaul under second-year coach Jackson. 
Fowler will play for the U.S. National Under-17 team next year and for the Under-18's the year after to prepare for his enrollment in the fall of 2009.

"He's always been a good player, but it's been in the past year that really he's started to generate a lot of interest," Perry Fowler said. "Did I ever have expectations like this for him? Absolutely not. It's some­thing that's evolved over time." 
Cam Fowler said he was told by the Irish coaching staff that he would be offered a scholar­ship, but he had as much time as he wanted to make his deci­sion. He made the choice soon after a visit to campus during the Penn State football week­end. 
"I chose Notre Dame because they have a great coaching staff there with [head coach] Jeff Jackson. [associate head coach] Paul Pooley and [assis­tant coach] Andy Slaggert," Fowler said. ''I'm excited about where their hockey program is going over the next few years." 
Perry Fowler said that Cam's decision to choose Notre Dame was his own and that both his parents supported him 100 percent. He made sure, howev­er, that his son was aware of all his options. 
"Everything else about Notre Dame is the icing on the cake after the world class academ­ics, the campus and the sup­port staff for the student ath­letes," Perry Fowler said. "Everything about it is first rate. After our second unoffi­cial visit to Notre Dame, he said, 'Dad, this is where I want to go."'

"We see him at Notre Dame being part of a program that's on the rise -hopefully it will be national championship con­tender," Perry Fowler said when asked where he sees his son in five years. "We're not looking anywhere beyond that."

Irish snag top defenseman for Class of 2013 
By KYLE CASSILY Assistant Sports Editor 
Notre Dame received a verbal commitment Sept. 19 from Cam Fowler -the first commit for the Class of 2013 -just five weeks after the team secured highly regarded Class of 2012 forward Patrick Gaul from the 
U.S. National Team. 
Fowler, a defenseman from Farmington Hills, Mich., chose Notre Dame over Michigan and Ohio State in the beginning of his freshman year of high school. He currently plays for

With an opportunity to clean up the playoff picture Sunday, Knott and Sorin threw a wrench into the works when their game ended in a 6-6 tie. 
"To us. this is a loss," Knott captain Matt Crosson said. "We feel like we have the talent to win every game, so this was a disappointment." 
Knott struggled throughout the game to find any semblance of an offense, posting a meager 51 yards of total offense, 23 of which came on scrambles by quarterback Justin Betz.

the Honeybaked AAA Hockey Club's midget minor team in the Midwest Elite Hockey League, an organization he has played with for the past seven years. 
Honeybaked general manager Larry Knapp described Fowler as a big and tall blue-liner with a smooth stride and great hands. Knapp praised Fowler's vision and said he is adept at making breakout passes out of the defensive zone. 
"[Fowler is] just, in my opin­ion, the best defenseman in the league," Knapp said. "And watching some of the other teams play in nationals, it looks like Cam is arguably one of the best players in his age group, period." 
The 6-foot-1-inch, 180-pound 14-year-old led his lloneybaked Bantam team last year to the Michigan State Finals, where the team lost to Belle Tire. He then impressed scouts at the USA Hockey Select 15 Festival in St. Cloud, Minn., where he scored one goal and three assists in five games. 
"[Notre Dame _is] very lucky to get Cam," Knapp said. "He's not only one of the best players to

Pasquerilla West continued its winning ways Sunday by defeating Lewis 26-6, thanks to a scoring flurry at the end of the first half. 
Leading 6-0 with less than five minutes left in the first half, a huge pass from quarter­back Cara Davies down the field set up a 15-yard touch­down strike to extend the lead to two scores.

Notre Dame thrives in second half 

No. 1 team has scored 28 goals after the break

At halftime of last Friday's contest against No. 6 West Virginia, No. 1 Notre Dame trailed 1-0 and had seen most of the game played in front of its own net. 
As the team went to the lock­er room, however, coach Handy Waldrum knew what needed to be changed. He told

The adjustment worked like a charm, allowing Notre Dame to outshoot the Mountaineers 19-3 and score three goals in the second half en route to a 3­1 victory. 
The second half dominance was nothing new for the Irish (11-0, 4-0 Big East), who have outscored opponents 28-0 after the break this year. 
The lopsided differential after halftime has been espe­cially crucial because Notre Dame has only led four of its 11 games at the half.
