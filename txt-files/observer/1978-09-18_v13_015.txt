Discusses policies: 
CLC holds first meeting 
by Dave Rombach 
Senior Staff Reporter 
The Campus Life Council, heir­apparent to the defunct Student Life Council (SLC) as the major forum between Notre Dame resi­dents and administrators, estab­lished a press policy, elected a permanent chairman and discussed its future last night in its first meeting of the year. 
Discussion at the meeting was restricted to "business" matters as a number of substantive issues, among them students' rights and "in loco parentis" were considered only as agenda items for the coming year. 
Student Body President Andy McKenna was unopposed in the Council's election of a permanent chairman after discussion among several members concerning the practicality of making the student body president the chairmanship. 
"Having the president the head of the CLC strikes me as too much of a symbiotic union. The CLC would lose much of its efficacy if it were to become an arm of the student government," Fr. Thomas Tallarida, rector of Zahm stated. 
HPC representative Bill Vita supported McKenna stating "we have to look at the person and not just the position I think Andy is the only student qualified." 
In other business the Council 
adopted the press policy of the 
disbanded SLC in which, while all 
regular meetings are to be "open," 
members of the Council reserve the 
right to strike any of their -state­ments from the record. 
All CLC members have the right to call for an "executive session" at the beginning of the meeting during which attendance will be limited to Council members. 
Fr. Eugene Gorski, rector of Howard Hall supported the policy stating that it would "encourage the free flow of communication." 
The policy drew criticism from Observer Editor Tony Pace. "It is my understanding that the CLC is an open meeting and so anything said is a matter of public record," Pace stated, adding, "If they want to make those meetings closed they should· but I think the community would suffer. 
The CLC constitution states "All meetings of the Council shall be open to any member of the Univer­sity community and to representa­tives of the campus media, except when otherwise determined by the Council." The current press policy was adopted without a vote. 
The Council also unanimously accepted an amendment to its bylaws concerning the attendance of ex-officio members, Dean of Students James Roemer and Vice­President for Student Affairs Fr. Van Wolvlear. According to the original constitution these two members were to attend only every other meeting. The amendment changes their attendance to every other meeting and to those ''they have been invited to by the chairman." 
In discussion of the agenda of issues for the coming year, Fr. 
Richard Conyers proposed that the Council consider taking steps to give the CLC legislative powers. 
''A major loss was sustained when the SLC was disbanded. The students lost the only legislative body they had. Conyers added, "I think one of our primary goals should be the attainment of legisla­tive power through this body." 
Conyers statement was con­tended by Roemer who asserted that the SLC never actually had legislative powers and the problem was merely one of semantics. ''The SLC never was legislature in any real sense. Lettingthem(SLC members) think they were, created difficulties. 
One student member who had been a member of the SLC said that while the CLC may not differ from the SLC in terms of legislative power, it did lack a direct line of communication with the University President enjoyed by the former body. 
"SLC proposals had to go through Bro. Just to the top whether he agree!l with them or not. Now the CLC is strictly an advisory council to the office for student affairs," he stated. 
Later in the meeting a remark made by Wolvlear prompted dis­cussion concerning the amount of student representation on the Council. The Council approved the formation of an ad hoc committee by Chairman McKenna to seek ways to increase student input without changing the Council's make-up.

Earthquake hits Iran 
TEHRAN, Iran-A devastating earthquake that struck a farming region of northeast Iran Saturday killed more than 11,000 persons and destroyed entire cities and villages, the official Pars news agency reported yesterday. The quake, which U.S. seismologists , measured at 7.7 on the Richter scale was the most powerful in recent Iranian history. Officials said they feared the reported death toll would go much higher as word comes in from outlying villages.

A pastoral letter signed by all Polish bishops and read from church pulpits yesterday throughout the country also urged the government to allow the broadcasting of religious programs and exhorted the faithful to listen to Vatical Radio. The letjer was the strongest denunciation of censorship made by the church in years.

Dole to run? 
[AP]-Sen. Bob Dole says he will not run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 if former President Gerald Ford runs, but he might enter the race if Ronald Reagan chooses to run. "It would be the height of ingratitude to say, 'I tried it. I liked it. I'm going to run.' After all, he Ford picked me out of obscurity" to be his 1976 running mate, Dole said Saturday.

30 participate in slumber party 

by leslie Brinkley 

Wearing bath robes and toting stuffed animals, 30 Notre Dame women trudged over to Stepan Center Saturday night to participate in a campus-wide slumber party. 
The doors opened at 11:30 p.m., enabling the students to arrange blankets and pillows on the floor in front of a screen to see the mystery movie, "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" Popcorn and soda were served during the movie. 
The party was sponsored by Farley, Lewis, and Breen-Phillips halls along with some financial backing from Student Union. Beth Jones, Farley Social Commis­sioner, organized the event and called the evening a success. She said those who attended "had a great time, but I was disappointed that so few people turned up." 
Despite rumors of raids, a security guard was posted outside Stepan Center and no trouble was encoun­tered. Initially, the slumber party was planned to last all night, but all of the party-goers had wandered home by 3:30 a.m. for a comfort­able bed. 
Because of the small response, Jones was uncertain about finaliz­ing plans for a cmapus fashion show. The show is tentatively scheduled for November and would feature Notre Dame students as 
models. .

Begin, in a tribute to Carter, said "he worked harder than our fore­fathers did in building . the pyramids of Egypt." But before there is peace, Begin noted, Israel and Egypt have three months of negotiations ahead to conclude a peace treaty. Turning to Sadat, the Israeli prime minister said there was no point in recounting the "saga" of their differences during the negotiations.

years. 
Brooke,. 58 years old and a 
two-term incumbent, is being 
challenged by Avi Nelson, 36, a 
talk-show host whose campaign has 
been heavily financed by natidnal 
conservative organizations. 
Both candidates have avoided 
public mention of Brooke's stormy 
divorce proceedings. Earlier this 
summer, Brooke was cleared of 
possible perjury charges in connec­

Candidates in the Democratic senatorial primary are Howard Phillips, founder of the Washing­ton-based Conservative Caucus, Rep. Paul E. Tsongas, Massachu~ setts Secretary of State Paul Guzzi and state Rep. Elaine Noble, an avowed lesbian. 

Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis is opposed in the Demo­cratic gubernatorial primary by conservative Edward J. King, former director of the state port authority. 
In the Republican primary, Ed­ward F. King, no relation to the Democratic candidate, who spon­sored a proposed constitutional tax amendment modeled after Cali­fornia's Proposition 13, is running. against House Minority Leader John Rodes. 
Six of Washington State's seven congressmen are expected to win their primaries, with five Republi­cans and five Democrats vying for the seat occupied by retiring Rep. Lloyd Meeds. 
The Oklahoma senatorial pri­mary runoff pits Gov. David Boren against former Rep. Ed Edmonson for the Democratic nomination to the seat held by Republican Dewey Bartlett, who is retiring. Robert Kamm, former president of Okla­homa State University, will be the Republican candidate in the gene­ral election.

Dear Edltorz 
We, the inhabitants of the study lounges of Planner Hall, would like to express our opinion on the present housing situation. This is something that affects us directly, 
1 yet we have had no say in the matter, save through our rector:, Br. Peter Mahoney. 
At the time of this writing, there are fourteen freshmen being housed in the study lounges of Flanner. We are comfortable in our present environment and do not wish to leave it. We have become well acquainted with our roommates, as well as many other people living in Flanner. These friendships have become valuable to us as we have been able to help each other and have received help 
and information .from the upper­classmen we know in the hall. To move us out would force us to

In our opinion, we have been treated poorly by the Department of Student Housing. We have been told at one time we will be moving in a week, the next time we are told we'll be staying for the semester. It is very upsetting living in this state of limbo. Plans are made (decorating the room, buying refrigerators, etc.), then they are scrapped because of new infor­mation coming out of the Depart~ ment of Student Housing. 
We enjoy living in Planner Hall and at Notre Dame, but it is very trying on a freshman when the housing situation is unclear and no opinions are asked. We would appreciate a meeting with the Director of Student Housing at which time we could express our opinions and discuss the situation with those involved in making the

Dear Editor: 

Now 1know l've seenJt atl. The top stories in Friday's Ubse.rv!r concerned new demands for stu~ dent rights. An ad hoc oommlttee :which include$ hall presidef!ts, the SBP, the Student Union Director and· the Observer Editor-in-Chief has been formed to obtain legisla· · tive and veto powers for the CLC in matters relating to student affaiti. 
If one browses through back issues ofthe Observer fr<>m thelate 60's, it may be noted that a legislative committee was formed to deal with student matters. This committee was named the Student Life Council (SLC), and it was composed of eight Administrators, eight faculty members and eight students. 
In its early years, the SLC!s meetings, which were open to the public, were weU~attended. As tbe premierforum for student opinil)n, the SLC was largely responsil:!le for the changes in student sooal life that t:ame about at: thattime. .·

There are two basic criteria by which a modem university is judged: the size of its endowment and the amount of quality research it does. If both criteria reach a certain level, the institution is named as one of the nation's outstanding academic universi­ties. 
It is more difficult to produce quality research. To be distin­guished in research (whatever that means, 1 Nobel Prize every 5 years or a Fr. Neiuwland every 10 years) 
requires  a  faculty  which  has  re­ 
search  as  top  priority.  Such  a  
faculty  will  undoubtedly  do  the  

"teaching" they are required to do, but their major efforts will be in research. Popular research has money, glory and prestige. 
To a student, the most important component of a university is a good teacher. A good professor is ~someone who has his heart in teaching; is concerned about the progress of his students; is avail· able to his students; and is willing to help a student understand even the most seemingly trivial con· cepts. 
Where does quality teaching fit in the priority list of an "outstand­ing university?'' The answer is obvious . after research. Placing major emphasis on research is the worst injustice a university can level on its students. 
Indeed, the ideal of a university administration is to hire someone who is an excellent researcher and an equally excellent teacher; but this is rarely possible. During three years of undergradute study it has been my experience that the ex· 
cellent researcher (the one who trys to publish the most) is a poor teacher. Some people are, by 
nature, excellent teachers; and others, also by nature, are ex· cellent researchers. Those who can do both are extremely rare.

A student spends half of his time at this school standing. So why. during the highlight of the week, should we subject ourselves to more standing? I witnessed the same thing at the Springsteen concert that same evening. 
Now, I can understand students getting excited at a concert or a football game and standing up: I do it myself; but not through the whole thing. I'm sure that perhaps a few students enjoy standing; let's send them to West Point. 
As for the rest of us, let's sit down and have a good time, even without . our beer. I'll be at the Michigan game and if things remain the same, there will be ~me more

Desiring good researchers is not altogether bad. It is good for the image of the school; and it attracts many applicants. But, in this instance, what is right for the university is not right for the students. Emphasis on research, while adding to the university's image, detracts from the education of the majority of its students. 
A viable, but expensive, alterna­tive would be for a university to hire one faculty for their teaching qualities, and another for their research qualities. By hiring two faculties, it would enable each to devote their time doing what they do best. In this way the needs of the students are satisfied and the image of the school is also impro­ved. If this alternative is not possible the needs of the students should be met first. Students are the reason a university exists. 
The Campaign for Notre Dame will double Notre Dame's endow­ment, and meet the first criterion for a distinguished university. Dr. O'Meara, the new provost, con­stantly emphasizes the need for hiring more quality research faculty members and meeting the second criterion. The picture is quite clear. The character of Notre Dame, and most importantly, the character of Notre Dame's faculty is in the process of a marked change. The push for research over teaching is unquestionably the trend. Without the right quality and right quantity of research, any brilliant but untenured faculty member could be let go. 
A university is the "natural" home for research, but it must be in balance with teaching. Notre Dame may be heading toward an era when a student might ask a professor, ''Dr. Smith, will you explain Bohr's atomic theory a­gain?" , only to be answered by "talk to m~ next week when my 


President Samoza claims: ~ 




Venezuel~ supports insurgents 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua [AP]  President Anastasio Somoza's gov­ernment, claiming near-victory against rebels in the north, said yesterday that Venezuela had thrown its military support behind the insurgents, sending warplanes to back a rebel attack in the south. 
The Information Ministry State­ment said Venezuelan planes based in Costa Rica had provided support for a rebel attack on the key Nicaraguan post of Penas Blancas, on the Costa Rican border. 
Costa Rica quickly denied the Nicaraguan claim. There was no immediate comment reported from Venezuela. 
National guard headquarters in Managua, meanwhile, said its forces had completely retaken the northern city of Leon, the country's second-largest. "The communist faction which had taken the city" had been overpowered, a guard statement said. 
The guard said government troops also were fighting rebels in Chinan­dega and Esteli. The rebels, led by guerrilas of the left-leaning Sandin­ista National Liberation Front, launched a general uprising last weekend in an effort to drive the authoritarian Somoza from power. 
Associated Press correspondent Lew Wheaton reported from Leon that entire blocks of the city of 100,000 people lay in ruins after the battle.

"Somoza must go" a stunned Leon woman said. "Only a madman would do something like this. We are not Communists here. Just Common people." 
Adding to this Central American nation's troubles was Hurrican Greta, which moved into the north­east Nicaragua--eastern Honduras region Sunday and threatened to wreak wide-spread damage. 
The government statement said the attack on the southern town of Penas Blancas by left-leaning guer­rillas occurred at 4 a.m. The small town straddles the Pan American 
Highway, the only paved road connecting Managua and Costa Rica. 
Sources in Managua said the outpost was overrun by rebels and a large supply of heavy caliber automatic weapons and ammuni­tion captured. 
Carlos Gutierrez, an anti-Somoza  campus address and phone num­
opposition leader here, said the Sandinistas blew up a Pan Amer­ican Highway bridge over a small river near the border. He said the Sandinistas would hold the border strip for at least 72 hours, declare a ''free territory'' and ask for inter­national recognition of a provi­sional government. 
If Costa Rica recognizes the provisional government, diplomats
in Central America speculated, anti-Somoza forces could easily be reinforced in a fight northward along the Pan American Highway to Managua. 
The Venezuelan government has been sharply critical of Somoza and has called for international media­tion to end the conflict here.

As part of $400,000 renovation: 
LaFortune receives furniture 
by Tom Jac)lman 
Butcherblock tables and chairs were installed last week in the first floor lounge of LaFortune Student Center, completing a highly visible facet of the S400,000 LaFortune renovation project. The question of whether or not this will help bring about increased use of the Student 
Center is as yet unanswered. 
Student Body President Andy McKenna said yesterday that he feels it's "definitely a good change, and the atmosphere has changed considerably. If people want to relax, they can go upstairs to the ballroom (where the old sofas are not located)." The furniture change was made "to make it a bit more of a social area,'' McKenna said, adding that the new tables would provide a ''better food facility" after the renovation of the Huddle. 
Mike Roohan, student body vice­president, also approved of the changes. "The 'Airport Lounge' (a nickname for the previous set-up) was too spread out. The new furniture adds more close contact," he stated. Roohan felt the lounge will get more use "after the first barrage of tests, when student apathy sets in." He also highly commended Bro. Kiernan Ryan, assistant vice-president for Busi­ness Affairs and the overseer of the project, for doing an "excellent job." 
However, Roo han said he feels that more than just renovation is needed. "Basically, we need a new

building. Student centers on a lot of campuses offer a lot of things, and so does this one, but theirs were designed for that purpose. This was designed as a science building," Roohan said. 
He added that next year the student government hopes to spon­sor a LaFortune Night, with movies and activities taking place all over the building, as a means of arousing interest in the building. 
Moves to increase usage ofLaFor­tune began last year as students claimed that no one used the buiiding, and that the library was a better place to socialize than the student center. 
The management of_ LaFortune, however, released a statement over the summer which said, "Even though some say the LaFortune Student Center is not used much, we would like to have some people know the facts recorded during the 1977-78 school year." The state­ment pointed out that the ballroom was in use for 134 one-half hour to four hour periods, and the ampi­theatre for 107 periods. 
The lounge change was one of the final projects of the renovation, which will be completed by the Huddle renovation and the installa­tion of an elevator. All money for the project was donated by the LaFortune family. 
The Huddle will close one week before the Christmas break to undergo complete renovation over the holidays. McKenna said that the fast-food restaurant will be "more like a McDonald's-type place, with a 'Country Store' on the side serving various meats and cheeses.'' 
Since the Huddle will be closed during the week of final exame, arrangements are being made to keep the pay cafeteria open until midnight during that period. 
Use of the lounge seems to have increased noticeably during the mid-afternpon periods, but few people were in the lounge after dinner. Most people expressed indifference to the changes, though one said, "I don'td like it--it looks like Kubiak's." One person study­ing after dinner noted, "It seems more like a library than a lounge. I kind of liked those old sofas." 

Davis, Cerny to perform 
The Notre Dame Concert Series will present Notre Dame music faculty Deborah Davis, cello, and William Cerny, piano, in the complete cycle of the Beethoven cello sonatas, to be performed in two segments 8:15 p.m. Monday and 8:15 p.m. Wednesday. 
Both recitals, which are ope·n to the public without charge, are to be held in the Library Auditorium. Davis, who holds a Master of Music with the Performer's Certificate from Indiana University at Bloom­ington, is instructor of music at Notre Dame and principal cellist of the South Bend Symphony. 
Cerny, a graduate of Yale, is chair­man of the Notre Dame music department. Davis and Cerny, with tile addition of Assistant Professbr Adrian Bryttan, form the Notre Dame Piano Trio. 
Monday's program will comprise three sonatas from Beethoven's early and middle periods. 
Wednesday's program concludes the cycle with a performance of the opus 102 sonatas, written at the beginning of Beethoven's final period. 

PE department holdS Self-defense ClaSSeS 
Beginning Monday, Sept. 18, the Physical Education department will sponsor a series of six classes on women's self-defense. These classes, which will run from 6:30-8 
p.m. in the LaFortune ballroom, will be taught by Sgt. Joel Wolvos of the South Bend Police Depart­ment. 
In the first class, Sgt. Wolvos will discuss the psychological makeup of an attacker and methods to verbally dissuade him. Subsequent classes will concentrate on the six major holds that an attacker might use and ways to escape these. 
All ND-SMC students are invited to attend these classes, which will meet on Monday and Wednesday for the next three weeks. Comfort­

The present program of the Center offers therapy for any individual, marital, or group problem. Struzzo added that a training program for clergy and professionals in pastoral counseling skills will be established in the near future. 
The St. Joseph Valley Pastoral Counseling Center is affiliated with the Institute of Religion and Health in New York City. It is a non-profit organization, requiring the finan­cial support of the community. A fee is charged in accordance with the ability of the individual to pay.

to the book. He showed how DNA functions in living organisms, treating the subject through the various levels of biological struc­tures and their systems of com­munication. 
After a treatment of genetics on a chomosomal level, Bender ex­plained the molecular basis of the gene and its DNA components. In this discussion, he talked of Monod's award-winning research on genetic replication, relating it to the time-control nature of genetic control. 
After this introduction, Bender gave his critique of Monod's ideas. "No other science but biology has so shaken modern thought," Bender stated in regards to its theories of evolution. 
He said biological evolution is more like the creativity process than Russian roulette, pointing out the probabilities involved in genetic mutations. 
In tying in these views with those of Monod, Bender seemed in agreement with the author that with each intrident involving chance, there always follows an action of necessity.

"Besides the three for a radio show called "Speaking "We don't pretend to know captains, we had John Heisler from and informative show. 

"Sometimes we'll have a certain theme for the show. Last Wednes­day night, for example, we had a trivia show and gave away T-shirts to anyone who could stump the panel. We gave away 17 shirts. Like 1 said, we don't know every­thing.'' 
The show has been a regular part of Sunday evening programming on WSND for the past few years. However it really didn't catch on until last year when, featuring the !'!xpert commentary of former WSND sports director Ted "Wally" Robinson and the·dry wit of John "Ston" Stenson, the show finally started to develop an audience on campus. 
"It gets to be a habit," joked "the Ston", "kind of like fish every Friday in the dining halls." 
This year the panel of "experts" has been expanded to four people. Stauder is joined each week by his three associate sports directors and he feels the larger panel has increased the quality of the show. 
"Each man on the show has his own opinions and personality,'' Stauder said. "Lou Severino and Brian Beglane are very profes­sional -just what one would expect on a show like this. Frank LaGrotta is our spicy and con_troversial figure. He's totally unpredictable. As the show's host, I try to keep things moving and somewhat rational. But you never know what's going to happen next."

According to Stauder, most of the listeners have a good point to make when they call in. 
"That's what we like to hear," Stauder emphasized. "Someone with something to say. Sometimes a caller will belabor his point until he gets unreasonable and of course there are the prank calls. How­ever, neither has gotten to thepoint where it's a problem. 
"We could put the show on a time delay but we're confident that the character of Notre Dame people can keep the calls in good taste." 
What can we expect from the "fearsome foursome" this year? "We've got lots of surprises," smiled Stauder. "We've tenatively scheduled Coach Dan Devine for a Sunday show sometime during football season and we'll try to have as many players on as we can. 
We'd also like to schedule shows with Digger Phelps and Lefty Smith when basketball and hockey seasons get underway." 
"It's a great show," comments Pete Johnson of the Notre Dame football team. "Bob Golic and I were guests on one show last year and both of us had a great time." 
"Overall," commented Severino, "it gives the students a chance to question and converse with people they wouldn't ordi­narily talk to.''
