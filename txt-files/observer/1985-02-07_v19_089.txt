Contrary to popular opinion, student leaders doing a good job 
The name of the Notre Dame student body president 
is Rob Bertino. 
This is news to nearly half of the student population, according to a recent Ombudsman survey. The poll also indicated that a whopping 74 percent of the students have no idea who their student representative is. 
Why? 
Some people would say the apathy toward student government at Notre Dame is just a mirror of the na: tion's apathy toward politics in general. Some people would say student government is powerless and cannot accomplish anything. 
Some people should get a clue. 
Contrary to popular belief, those unknown student leaders have actually done a pretty good job. Despite basking in anonymity all year, they have made noticeable gains in many facets ofstudent life. 
For those students looking to escape the highway robbery of the bookstore, there is the Student Saver general store in LaFortune. Selling school supplies and health and beauty aids, Stu­
prominent project of the 
student leaders. 
But there are others. 
For campus clubs and or­ganizations, there is now a place to buy custom­designed jerseys without trekking into South Bend. It's the Notre Dame T-Shirt Shop, and it's new this year. 
And these leaders have been looking out for your safety as well. For those barflies -or, in fact, for anyone who drives at night ­there is the new Dry Driving Club. AU you have to do is promise to stay offthe hard stuffand drive your buddies home, and Senior Bar will give you all the Pepsi you can handle. It's a great program, and you can thank your student leaders for it. 
Even the students who can't stand dorm life anymore 
got a helping hand, in the form of a landlord's open 
house last week in LaFortune. 
The much-maligned Hall President's Council got in on the action, too. The Blow Off For Awhile Club is a good concept: fill those vacant hall party rooms with entertainment, food and students. It promotes socializ­ing with people from halls other than your own, thus helping to get rid of that "our dorms are like frater­nities" silliness. It's just too bad the HPC couldn't come up with a better name than BOFA. 
And for everyone who despises theme nights at the dining halls, Ombudsman sponsored a forum with Director of Food Services Bill Hickey. No one showed up, ofcourse, but that's a reflection ofthe student body,

None ofthis is to imply that our student leaders were perfect public servants this year. It would be nice, for instance, to see some .response to the recently proposed curriculum changes. 
But these leaders certainly haven't spent all their time sitting on their wallets. And if three-fourths of the students don't know the names of these leaders, some­thing is wrong.

don't look now, because it's almost election time again. Soon there will be a whole 
new batch of names and faces vying for your vote. And there will be a whole new bunch of ideas on how to improve student life. 
This time around, get with the program. Check out the candidates and their positions on the issues. You're not going to find leaders who will solve every campus problem. But, as shown this year, good student leaders can make a difference.

Imagine you are an outstanding engineering student who has just been invited to join a prestigious honor society. But should it cost 
SSO? 

This initiation fee has created con· fusion on campus concerning the engineering honor society, Tau Beta Pi, as prospective members have ex­pressed skepticism concerning the application of this fee. 
These impressions of the society, however, are false, according to senior Mike Connolly, student presi­dent of the Indiana Gamma Chapter of Notre Dame. 
"The main purpose of the organi­
zation." explained Connolly, "is to 
mark in a fitting manner those who 
have conferred honor upon their 
alma mater by exhibiting distin­
guished scholarship and exemplary 
character as undergraduates in engi· 
neering." 

"It is the national engineering 
honor society," remarked James 
Froula, executive director of Tau 
Beta . Pi, from the headquarters in 
Knoxville, Tenn. 

The organization derives its influ­ence not only from its large national membership, but also from its strin­gent entrance requirements. Al­though he would not specify the exact GPA requirement, Connolly said, "The required grade point is well above that of the dean's list. Only one-eighth of all juniors and one-fifth ofall seniors in engineering are invited to apply." 
"A prospective member must also complete some sort ofproject, such as writing a paper, helping out with an event, or doing jobs affiliated with Tau Beta Pi," he added. 
The current ninety-five members 
on campus were selected by Con­
nolly and a small staff on the basis of 
scholarship and exemplary charac­
ter. 

ConnoHy claims that the SSO fee should not deter prospective mem­bers. "When I first joined, I didn't want to pay it (the fee). However, all of the money is spent within the or­ganization for the benefit of the members." 
"If the student is not able to pay," he adds, "we will help them out. Last year we paid the initiation fees for five new members." 
Most of the money is channeHed to the national offices in Knoxville, where it is used for membership cer­tificates, four-year subscriptions to the quanerly magazine, The Bent, one-year subscriptions to the Tau Beta Pi newsletter, and copies ofthe society's constitution. 
In addition, Froula noted, "the new member receives a 'bent,' which is a sort of a ceremonial key that is gold-plated and bears the member's name." 
The remaining fraction of the fee is spent locally by the chapter on an initiation banquet for the new mem­bers and other chapter expenses. Unlike many other campus organiza­tions, the society receives no en­dowments or donations. 
Tau Beta Pi's purpose is to recognize the diligent efforts of en­gineering students, but Connolly ex­tends the organization into a beneficial, functioning agency for all those enrolled in the college ofengi­neering. He cites Tau Beta Pi's co­sponsorship of Engineering Week, engineering study breaks, tutoring services to engineering students, and industry plant tours as a few ex­amples of the society's activities. 
Connolly's primary concern is to create more participation among members. "Once accepted, you're a lifetime member, and it can only help to meet other engineers and learn about futures and keys to suc­cess in engineering careers. After all, that is the career toward which are members are headed."

Archbishop to speak on economics 
ByJOHN MENNELL 
AssistantNews Editor 
Archbishop Rembert Weakland, chairman of the Bishop's committee which wrote the recent pastoral let­ter on Catholic Social Teaching and the U.S. Economy will speak tonight Notre Dame's Center for Continuing Education. 
The lecture "The Church and Eco­nomics" will be delivered at 8 p.m. It is sponsored by the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Cat­holicism. 
A draft of the letter was released last November but will not be finalized until the bishops meet later this year. 
Reports in The Observer said the 120-page draft had strong language that surprised some experts and 
Jury says 
'no libel' 
ASSOCiated Press 
MIAMI -A federal jury denied Watergate burglar E. Howard Hunt S 1 million in damages yesterday, deciding that he was not libeled in an article by an ex-CIA agent sug­gesting Hunt was part of a conspir­acy to assassinate President John Kennedy. 
In a trial four years ago, Hunt was awarded S650,000 in damages. That verdict was overturned because ofa flawed instruction to the jury. 
This time a six-member jury ruled in favor of liberty Lobby, a right­wing Washington group that publishes The Spotlight tabloid, where the article appeared in 1978. 
The focus ofthe suit was an article written by former CIA agent Victor Marchetti and published seven years ago. The article contended that a 1966 CIA memo purported Hunt was in Dallas the day Kennedy was slain and suggested he had a role in the murder. 
Corrections 
Because of a reporting error, a story about student elections at Saint Mary's in yesterday's Observer was incorrect. Jeanne Heller is run­ning for vice president for student affairs, and Julie Harmon is running for vice president of academic af­fairs. 
Also, the Blow-Off For Awhile Club (BOFA) was last night at Pangborn. 
The person on the front page of yesterday's paper was incorrectly identified. The student pictured at the Hall Presidents' Council meeting is Stanford Hall President Gene Boes. The Observer regrets the er­
rors.

graduate students, is making busi­ness sacrifices by putting out many papers in areas where non-paying people are, such as LaFortune. 
Oliva's main argument was, "The Observer is a key communication guide for this University, and I think it (charging graduate and law stu­dents) would improve the quality of the paper." 
However, Father David Tyson, Vice President for Student Affairs, said he did an unofficial survey of graduate students last year when The Observer finances were in ques­tion and the paper was considering charging graduate students. Several graduate students contacted Tyson. 
Tyson said, "They were irate that the University would even consider such a thing."

sparked controversy about the bis­
hops' role in political affairs. 
Weakland, archbishop of Mil­
waukee since 1977, was involved in 
the framing of Vatican II and was 
elected Abbot Primate of the Inter­
national Benedictine Confederation. 
In the letter the bishop's call for an "experiment in economic democracy: the creation ofan order that guarantees the minimum condi­tions of human dignity in the eco­nomic sphere for every person." 
Some of the main points stressed in the document include: 
"The 
fact that more than 1 5 per­cent of our nation's population live below the poverty level." 

"The 
most urgent priority for U.S. domestic ecomomic policy is the 



and decent working conditions." 
The 
direction of United States foreign policy should be shifted from military programs to those that re-emphasize basic human needs. 

Finally, 
"a consumerist mentality which encourages immediate gratification mortgages our future. Both our cultural values and our tax structure need to be revised to dis­courage excessively high levels of consumption." 


Born in 1927, Weakland was or­dained in 1951. He served on the Council of Superiors General from 1968 to 1977. 
Currently he is a member of the Board of Directors of the Wisconsin Catholic Conference and chairman ofthe Bishop's ad hoc Committee on

SBP candidate debate slated to air on WVFI 
By MIKE MILLEN 
Senior StaffReporter 
WVFI will broadcast a debate be­tween Student Body Presidential candidates junior Bill Healy and junior Pat Browne tonight at 7. 
Sponsored by Ombudsman, the one-hour debate will include a panel of representatives from The Observer, Scholastic, and WVFI (AM 640). Questions will be accepted from the radio audience over the phone line ( 239-7605) and from those in the LaFortune studio. 
Browne, who is running with vice presidential candidate Joanie Cahill, also a junior, said the debate "is a good thing to find out where the candidates stand." Regarding strat­egy, he said he is "really strong in im­proving life on campus," adding, "We will concentrate on getting stu­dent government closer to the stu­dents." 
Healy, who has junior Duane Lawrence as his running mate, also thought the debate a good idea, saying, "We think it's a good forum to get out some of the issues." He added, "Student government needs to be restructured," and said that his 
focus will be on "social life and stu­dent government" itself.

Saint Mary's to host 1st harpsichord fest 
By BETH WHELPLEY 
News Staff 
Music will fill the ears of many in­terested students when the in­augural meeting of The Midwest Historical Keyboard Society takes place at Saint Mary's on February 21­23. 
Harpsichordists will be gathering in Moreau Hall from as far as Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky for this first meeting of its kind in the Mid· west, according to Clayton Hender­son, chairman of the Saint Mary's music department. 
The weekend will consist of three major recitals with public recep­tions afterward, and the presenta­tion of several papers on harpsichord music. It will also pro­vide a stage for several harpsichord builders to demonstrate tuning and maintenance ofthe instrUment. 
Looking over the events, Hender· son commented, "It really is a com­bination of performance, scholarly, and practical parts." 
Thursday's recital will feature Kenneth Drake from the University ofIllinois, and on Friday, Ed Parmen­tier of the University of Michigan will perform. A duet by Julane Rodgers and Annette Lunde will be played on Saturday afternoon. This performance will feature some Bach and Handel. "This is especially ap­propriate," said Henderson, "since Saturday will be Bach's 300th birthday." 

Although there has been a South­ern Historical Keyboard Society for over thirty years, there have been no formal meetings of harpsichordists or other keyboard instrument players in the Midwest. 

A friend of Henderson's, who realized the need for organization and was impressed with the facilities at Saint Mary's, requested the meeting be held on the Saint Mary's campus. 
Henderson encourages not only music majors, but all music lovers to attend. "I think for anyone inter· ested in music, especially of an ear­lier historical period, this would be very interesting. It is the first oppor­tunity to hear first-rate artists in this kind of music." 
All of the events, open to t:de entire campus, will be held in Moreau Hall. A full schedule of events will be available on Thursday from noon until five o'clock at the Saint Mary's music department.

Dems respond to Reagan speech, proclaim their party 'alive and well' 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Democratic leaders declared yesterday their party is "alive and well" and looking to the future, as the opposition party responded to President Reagan's State of the Union message in a 30­minute television show. 
The Democratic Party "knows how to change," party officeholders emphasized in the program, broad­cast nationally by two of the three commercial television networks. The third, ABC, opted for a regularly scheduled soap opera. 
The show focused on elected offi­cials talking about deficits, Social Se­curity, taxes and defense spending with 58 ordinary Americans in four discussion groups across the nation. 
"Our objective is not to disagree with our president and his party, al· though our differences are many,"

said Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the narrator of the show produced by the Democratic campaign com· mittees. "like all Americans, we must celebrate any success that builds a better future. We believe that Democrats should work with Republicans to insure that kind of future. 
"But tonight is the first opportu· nity for our Democratic Party to speak to America since the defeat of 1984," Clinton added, going on to say that "resounding" defeat by Reagan last November left an im­pression on the party. 

"We are listening and we do care," said Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd, R-W.Va. 
"This is a party that knows it has to 
change, a party that wants to reach 
out to all Americans, Democrats, 

Republicans and independents," 
said Clinton.

the response right after Reagan's 
speech to the joint session of 
Congress on Capitol· Hill, but ABC 
broadcast an episode of its prime­
time soap opera "Dynasty." ABC will 
air the response Friday night at 
l0:30p.m. 

As has been the case in the past few years, the Democratic "response" was taped before Reagan's speech and responded to it only in general terms. 
"We have had a very acceptable rate ofeconomic growth in the past year," House Majority Leader Jim Wright, 0-Texas, said in the show. But he went on to talk about a record number of bankruptcies, farm failures and bank collapses.

WASHINGTON -The military pension system, which provides a minimum ofhalfpay for hundreds of thousands ofservice personnel who retire as early as their late 30s, has been the target before of reformers inside and outside the Pentagon, but has resisted attempts to change it. 
Budget Director David Stockman is the latest critic, castigating the sys­tem as "a scandal ... an outrage." 
He told Congress on Tuesday that "institutional forces in the military are more concerned about protect· 
ing their retirement benefits than in addition to any salary he earns in a they are about protecting the secur-new career. ity ofthe American people." According to the Pentagon, a

was quick, but even some of Stock-man's strongest opponents conceded the pension system needs reform. 
"I do think we need to take a look at the pension system," said Sen. Sam Nunn, 0-Ga., at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. Nunn, one of the most widely respected defense experts in Congress, then blasted Stockman's comments. 
The military retirement system began after the Civil War, conceived as a method ofluring Union veterans out of the service. Over the years, it was also considered to be a prime lure for recruits, offsetting the relatively low pay and postings to

Terrorists attack Iranian buildings; Khomeini blames U.S. for actions 
Associated Press 
TEHERAN, Iran -Terrorists at­tacked a Teheran government build­ing and set fire to an Iranian bank in West Germany yesterday during celebrations of the sixth anniversary of Iran's Islamic revolution. Two groups opposed to Ayatollah Ruhol­lah Khomeini claimed responsibility and vowed to continue the violence. 
The official Iranian news agency, 
IRNA, said terrorists mounted a 
grenade attack on a government 
building in the Iranian capital. It 
blamed the United States. 
The agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, said "two United States mer­cenary agents" riding a motorcycyle hurled two grenades into the ac­counting office of the Mostazafin (Oppressed) Foundation in Teheran at 8:45a.m. 
One grenade exploded, killing the maintenance chief of the building and wounding two security guards, IRNA said. It said one attacker was shot and killed, another was wounded and a third was arrested. 
In a telex to the London bureau of The Associated Press, the leftist Iranian Mujahedeen Khalq claimed responsibility for the attack on what it called a center of "military suppression and torture." It said one of the Mujahedeen was killed. 
In Frankfurt, an arson fire at the 
building housing the Bank Melli Iran 
injured 14 people. Police estimated 
$1.5 million in damage to the build·· 

ing. 
A police statement said two men entered the lobby of the seven-story building, pulled an "incendiary device" from a bag, set it on fire and fled. The blaze quickly spread to other floors, forcing some employees to jump to adjoining roofs. 
A caller from the royalist Fedajin Royal Iranian Monarchy claimed re­sponsibility for the arson in tele­phone calls to the West German news agency DPA and a Frankfurter Rundschau, and warned of further attacks. 
Ali Safavi, a spokesman for the Mujahedeen told The Associated Press in a recent interview in New York that the group was involved in a "life and death struggle agaiunst Khomeini" and planned to attack government officials and facilities in the most extensive effort since 
1979. 
The timing of the announced of­fensive coincides with the 1 0-day celebrations that began in Iran last Friday to mark the anniversary ofthe victory of the revolution and Khomeini's return. 
The Fedajin group is little known, despite claiming an earlier attack on an Iran Air office in Frankfurt.

Bishop McManus urges response from students

Bishop William McManus Fort Wayne-South Bend 
guest column 
to speak out on the highly controversial paS­toral letter on the condition of the U.S. eco­nomy. All sorts ofexperts will be advising me. Because they are experts, they will come on strong for their particular positons which, even in economics, may be rather partisan. 
I would like to know what Notre Dame and St. Mary's students think about the U.S. eco­nomy. Ifyou speak up, I will listen attentively. While I would like to have all of you read the full text ofthe pastoral letter, I am not so naive or so optimistic to have confidence that you will have the time to plow through it, and it can be slow going because of its ponderous prose. I will be satisfied for now ifsome ofyou would give me your candid opinions on a few crucial issues which are as follows: 
First, do you think the bishops are "out of place," "over their depth" or messing around with business matters best left to business professionals" when they presume to lay 
down moral principles and apply them specif­
ically to economic matters; or, do you think 
the Church will not be taken seriously unless 
its leaders carry the gospel ofjesus Christ into 
the marketplace? 
Second, do you think economic decisions, 
often made at corporate headquarters, should 
be based on what they will do to people and 
for people (the bishops' position) or should 
they be governed by economic "laws," like 
supply and demand, profitability and risk? 
Third, do you agree or disagree with a pro­
posal for the federal government to create 
300,000 jobs for unemployed young people 
( 18 to 25 ), in something like the Civilian Con­
servation Corps of Roosevelt's time, even 
though this may mean an increase in federal 
taxes? 
Finally, do you believe that some poverty 
and unemployment, as high as six percent, are 
inevitable in a free enterprise economy? 
These questions are "leaders" to what your interest is in the moral dimensions of eco­nomic decision. I will be pleased to have your views on any aspect of the U.S. economy, not excluding investments in military hardware and our nation's responsibilities to human beings in the Third World. 
I would like to have your views before Feb. 1 5 because I will soon be getting to work on my amendments to the first draft of the bis­hops' pastoral letter. My address is: Box 390, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46801. 
P.O.BoxQ 
A vice is not a total necessity 
Dear Editor: 
As I write this response to Father Robert Griffin's "inward confession," I sit in a class­less joint, with my eyes burning from the smoke of obnoxious nearby inconsiderates. They presume to pollute my air (yes, my air) and make my food taste like an ash tray, all for the sake of a filthy nicotine addiction. As my contact lenses dry up from the acrid ambience caused by these self-centered individuals, I feel the urge to plead with them. 
"Excuse me, but would you mind not smoking? It irritates my eyes." 
"Yes, I would mind," a gruff voice replies, 
accompanied by a sneer and a reproachful 
look. 
Well, Father Griffin, I congratulate you on writing one of the most hypocritical articles I have ever witnessed betwixt these pages. I am deeply sorry that I fall into the category of "obnoxious stranger." Should my personal comfort be sacrificed at the expense ofa filthy few? If one cannot control himself in public, does it not follow that he should not go out in public? Knowing that smokers exist has no ill effect on me. Of course, when they puff their 
pollution in the proximity of my person, that is a different story. I maintain the right to breathe God's air asHe gave it to me, not as the Marlboro Man did. 
And so, Father Griffin, I offer my con­dolences for your unfortunate obsession. Priests who smoke are an amusing enigma to me, knowing that they are only "wholly" human when they carry a crucifix in one hand and a carton in the other. I also am sorry that 
you need a controlling vice (in accordance with canon law, ofcourse). Personally, I don't. Peter C. Grenier Notre Dame student 
Is interhall hockey a stage for immaturity? 
DearEditor: 
I am an interhall hockey player for Keenan Hall. We played the combined team of Howard-Cavanaugh last Monday. Keenan only had six players, and we had no realistic chance of winning. We were just out to have fun and play hockey. It turned out that our opponent's philosophy was quite the contrary. 
An H-C player jabbed his stick in ou goalie's chest for no apparent reason, and an­other player ran over our goalie with his fists out in front of him. Neil, our goalie, was defenseless at the time -on his knees, covering a puck. I proceeded to knock the player off Neil. I was given a single minor penalty and the H-C player a double minor, though he should have been ejected from the game. 
The H-C team also received several other unnecessary roughing penalties during the game, most of which were committed after they had a 6-0 lead. 
I do not mean to scorn every player on the team but, rather, those individual players who displayed their immaturity. 
Congratulations on a fine victory!

Hair today, gone tomorrow 
~ 


1
1he root of the problem is just that. 
A few roots declare war on 
your scalp, break off all contact 
and get stranded somewhere. It 
is not a happy scenerio for you 
or your hair. 
While it is not the most pleas­
ant situation to see more ofyour 
scalp peeping through each 
morning, it is not uncommon. By 
age 25, one-fourth of all men 
show some sign of baldness. The 
whole process starts with a v­
shaped hairline at the temples 
and a hairless spot on the top of the head. After a time, the two areas fuse and the victim has something in common with Don Rickles. 
Students do not realize how widespread this frightening situation is. It is not a condition that plagues only those beyond the age of 30. "My hairline was receding before I was born I think," claims a senior electrical engineering major who said, with little pride, that he was the fist person in his high school class to start losing his head of hair. 
The possibility oflosing hair makes it something people want to keep -preferably on their heads. Aware of this common fear ofhairloss, marketers have developed a complete list of restoration and preservation remedies. 
The first and easiest are the over-the-counter remedies. Unfortunately, according to a recent article in the New York Times, the Food and Drug Ad­ministration is considering a ban on all advertised non­prescription baldness cures 
because they simply don't work. 
The treatments are useless and 
harmless-except to the pocket 
book.
r:Jr. Aziz, is escorted by two guards as he is accused ofrape. 
John Mennell 
features staff. writer 
The second step would be to go to the doctor. There are many causes for temporary loss ofhair including such things as fever and exposure to radiation. Prescription drugs are available to stop or slow the rate ofhair loss. 
The most drastic, expensive, but effective treatment for hair loss is transplanting. Developed in the late '50s by Dr. Norman Orentriech, the process involves taking small tufts ofhair from places on the scalp where it is still growing and transplanting it to bald areas. This technique requires a great deal oftime because only small amounts can be transplanted in one session. 
If there seems to be less hair 
left each time you use a comb or 
brush, don't worry. You arc not 
alone in the world ofgrowing 
foreheads. Students are con­
cerned about hairloss occuring 
now as well as in the future. 
A sophomore business major who seems sensitive to the bald­ness question declares, ''I'm not bald! I'm just losing my hair." He admits to worrying about bald­ness down the road. 
Women are also aware of balding men. 
"I notice it," admits a Breen Phillips senior who is majoring in sociology. 
Two Farley juniors agree, "It's not that big of a deal." A Lewis Freshman comments, "I just don't care. If a guy is good looking it's not going to matter." 
A Badin sophomore has good news for those who are balding. "Sometimes, it gives them class," she says of a receding hairline. 
"It really doesn't make any dif­ference," the Badinite feels, "It's not a real turn-on or turn-off, it's just neutral." 
Many people realize the im­
portant part that heredity plays 
in determing whether or not 
they will go bald. A junior ac­
counting major says a skin top is 
in his future, "My dad is bald, it's 
inevitable." A spokesman for 
the Food and Drug Administra­
tion, Edward Nida, told the New 
York Times "How you lose or 
keep your hair depends on how 
wisely you choose your par­
ents," he said, "For the most 
part, it is hereditary." 
Other good indicators that 
one might be able to get a good 
tan on the scalp in the future are 
body hair and race. Caucasians 
are more susceptible to baldness 
than orientals, negroids or indi­
ans. Also, a man with a hairy 
body is more likely to bald than 
a relatively hairless man. 
While many students would 
not admit to having a receding 
hairline themselves, they did not 
mind pointing out the lack of 
hair on their roommates' heads. 
One sophomore explained 
that while he had no problem, 
his roommate did, "He plays 
with his hair and as a result has a 
receding hairline." A junior 
revealed that his roommate's 
mother had sent her son some 
shampoo that would supposedly 
prevent hairloss. 
Ifyou think you are immune 
to hairloss now, awareness of 
thinning -or disappearing hajr 
can only increase. By the time 
one has lived for halfa century, 
there is a 50 percent chance that 
baldness will begin to show. 
Just as there's no way to avoid or prevent the aging process, there's no easy way to get around the changes that go along with it. Losing hair has no obvious advantages but it could be viewed as a means ofcutting down on barber bills or conserv­ing on shampoo. Hair is so com­mon among the young. So, dare to be different -don't hide under a baseball cap. Buy some suckers and hold your head high. Rumor has it the Telly Savalas look is in. 
Shakatak, an irresistable jazz attack 
The sole purpose oflyrics in Shakatak's music seems to be to provide something for Saward to sing, and sing she does. Saward has a broad singing style and a fantastic range that allows her to use her voice almost as an instrument. If the song is fast-paced, then she sings out strongly and solidly. In the mellow, slower songs her voice is sensual and hypnotic. 
The album's greatest weakness is that it suffers from an acute case of "ifyou've heard one song, you've heard them all" syndrome. Its saving grace is deemed from the fact that the instrumental arrange­ment is clean and crisp and the songs well-mixed. This is an album that can be listened to while doing something else, such as enjoying a quiet candlelight dinner for two. 
The group is presently a big hit in Europe andJapan where they have been honored by gold albums and top ten singles. It should be a mat­ter of time before they enjoy much of the same in the U.S. 
Correction 
The name of the student resi­dent in Stepan Center was incor­rectly spelled in Tuesday's Observer. The correct spelling is Nick Molchan.

Record review 
T
ired oflistening to overplayed 
songs on the radio? Looking for 
some soft-core jazz-funk? Does 
music requiring little attention in 
return for enjoyment and relaxation 
after a day offrustrating classes 
interest you? Ifso, flipping on the 
new album by Shakatak may be just 
the thing you should do. 
Shakatak's sophisticated sound came together in 1979 when Tracks and another Earth, Wind and Fire­style band joined forces figuring that "two funk!> are better than one." The band's name was sugges­ted by someone at a jazz-funk im­port store in London called the Record Shack, hence the name 
Shakatak. Their music is classified as 
a combination ofpop, funk and jazz, without any of these elements overpowering the other. However, the group's current album, their third in the U.S. and fifth overall, leans toward the jazzy side. 
The album opens with "Down on the Street," an excitingly funky song that won't suffer from the airwave exploitation that plagues many groups who have hit it big. The song is danceable with its pulsating, exotic beat. The chorus is very catchy, any listener will be singing it after hearing the song only a few times. IfShakatak hits it big in the U.S., this tunc may well be the rea­son why. 

The second track, "Holding On," slows things down a bit. It contains a strong saxaphone solo. Jill Saward's sensuously solid voice complements the music and doesn't drown it. 1be result is a nearly mesmerizing sound. "Summer Sky" shows off Bill Sharpe's talent at the keyboard. Between Saward's repetition ofthe one four-line verse, Sharpe's piano riff steals the show. 
The song "Watching You" is a good demonstation of the band's versatility. Its tempo moves from one end ofthe jazz-funk spectrum to the other. The song opens slow and mellow with a faint beat in the background. During the choru ... ­faint beat becomes a wild jung beat and the song takes off. 
Lyrically, the album is sparse. It ain't no usepretendin', Three of the songs have lyrics con­Wben a love affair ts endin', sisting offour lines, and the fourth Thatyou can'taccept the partyou is an instrumental. What few lyrics play. there are, are not thought­'Cause when two peoplefall in provoking, but tend to be typical of love, love songs. A good example ofthis Andgo together band in glove, is found in "Don't Blame it on That's the hardest thing to throw Love": away.

that's the only thing you can do ­drill until it becomes habit, and he's done that well." 
With improved skills has come the confidence that Price lacked in his first two years with the Irish. 
"I've had a problem with my con­fidence ever since I've been here," Price says. "In the last few games, I've gained a lot ofconfidence. Right now, I'm just trying to keep my con­fidence up." 
And although the time on the bench was hard on him, Price feels he found out a great deal while spending time watching the team play. 
"I often thought about how I could contribute to the team in the best possible way," he says, "and I had a lot oftime to think while I was on the bench.

"I really analyzed the games and I said to myself, 'We really need a little enthusiasm, and we need some spurts when the fellows are down.' So I want to keep the fellows fired up. I try to have control of the game in my own special way. I just want to play with confidence and keep the fellows fired up." 
'I think he's just starting to find himself as a JUnior. He's starting to get more confidence, and with 11 games left, he's got to be o plus for us to be successful.' 
--Digger Phelps. 
As for the future, Price just wants to continue playing well, hopefully helping the team on to greater heights. 
"I just want to continue to play as hard as I can," he says, "and continue to help out the team in the best way I can. I want to improve as a player, so I want to improve things like my free-throw percentage and field goal 
percentage. I just hope we keep win­ning and make it to the NCAA tourn­ament." 
Phelps realizes that Price will be an important player as the Irish en­ter the final 1 1 games of their schedule. 
"Joseph is playing his role right 
now and just contributing where he 
can," says Phelps. "I think he's an ex­
cellent shooter, and when he's hot 
we just want to get him the balL 
"He's also been able to do some things defensively against bigger people. He did a really good job against Miguel of UClA. He can guard a big guard or a small forward. And he's also a very good zone player, and so from that standpoint he can contribute. 
"I think he's just starting to find himself as a junior. He's starting to get more confidence, and with 1 1 games left, he's got to be a plus for us to be successful." 
And after helping the Irish to vic­tory last night over LaSalle with six points on 3-6 shooting, Price looks forward to this weekend's matchup with Syracuse. 
"The Syracuse game is going to be a really exciting game," he says. "The game could be another step as far as possibly being ranked and get­ting into the NCAA's. I think ifwe do the things we have to do, then we can upset them. I'm just really looking forward to it." 
And Irish fans are looking forward to continued good play from Price.

timing ot the snowfall has been tre­mendous. It snowed nine inches the day everybody came back, so people were able to go out as soon as registration day. Finally, the interest has grown because the phys. ed. d~­partment has been offering classes m cross-country skiing. This is the fourth year they've done it, so every class here has had the chance to take them." 
"A Day at the Races" is the result of the popularity. The day will start at noon with an obstacle course that will feature head-to-head competi­tion. At approximately 12:45, there will be a two-mile individual race around the perimeter of the golf course. There will be both men's and women's divisions, a.."' well as a staggered start with skiers entering the course every 30 seconds. Finally, at about 1:30, there will be a sprint relay in which teams oftwo will race aginst the clock. 
For those who need equipment, skis will be made available, free of charge. Those who need equipment can reserve it when they register. The NVA will also provide hot choc­olate and prizes. 
Saturday's races are not the. only skiing events that the NYA is spon­soring this weekend, either. Tomor­row night there will be a "moonliter" for those who would like to experience night skiing. For 
$1, skiers can rent a pair ofskis from 7 to 10 p.m. There will also be free hot chocolate.

before flipping ilie ball to guard 
Scott Hicks under ilie basket for the 
easy layup. 
In less ilian 30 seconds, Rivers had 
captured the spotlight, ilie Irish had 
taken the lead at 17-16, and the 
crowd was on its feet. LaSalle never 
had the lead again. 
When Rivers returned following a hard fall on a fast break, the Irish were sitting atop a 29-22 lead, and aliliough ilie Explorers crept back to wiiliin iliree at 29-26, jumpers from Rivers and Barlow reinstated the seven-point margin at halftime, 33· 26. 
From then on it was catch-up ball for LaSalle, which was not good news for a team which likes to run a controlled, take-your-time offense, and which was even worse news for a team which was shooting under 40 percent and getting thrashed on the boards. 
"I don't think we did a bad job defensively," said Ervin. "But when you're trying to come from behind, you have to give some things up. 
"They just had superior rebound­ing. There were times when there were four or five blue shirts in there at once, and we just couldn't come up with it." 
In other words, everyiliing went wrong for the Explorers, especially in the first seven minutes of the second half. Rivers and Barlow came into the half the same way they went out of the first one, teaming on a relaxed alley-oop that put the Irish up, 41-32. On top of that, Dolan scored six of his eight points in that period, and Royal laid it in following a pass from Rivers. When Joseph Price started hitting from the outside, Notre Dame's lead was 47­34, and LaSalk never got closer than nine the rest of the way, despite a game-high 20 from Lewis. 
Barlow, Rivers and Royal tallied 18, 14 and 12 points, respectively, for the Irish. Rivers also handed out seven assists . 
..,Jvers is playing now as well as he .:an play," said Phelps. "Between the press, transition game and con­trolling the hoards, we really got them."

Go D 
ND/SMC ski teams to participate in regional meet in Caberfae Mts. 
ByTOMYOON 
Sports Writer 
This weekend the Notre 
Dame/Saint Mary's men's and wo­
men's ski teams, captained by John 
O'Donovan, Kateri Gaffney, and Ann 
Ratledge, will ski in the regional 
meet in the Caberfae Mountains. 
This meet will determine the teams 
that will go on to divisonals in 
February. 
Concerning the upcoming meet, O'Donovan says, "I believe that ifwe ski well this weekend, we have a strong chance to secure a bid to regionals." 
For the women's squad, Julie Currie said she believes that the team also has a chance to qualify for regionals if it performs well this weekend. 
The main reason for their expec­tations is that, for the first time in its history, the ski team has been able to train once every week at Swiss Val· ley. In previous years, a winter trip to Crested Butte, Colo., has been the extent of the skiers' training. 
Their training this year began on registration day of the second se­mester when they went to Swiss Val-

ley with 75-80 people to hold tryouts for the team. Only twenty skiers make the travelling team; ten men make up the men's team which has an A and B squad, whereas there are five women on each ofthe Notre Dame and Saint Mary's squads. The team's season consists of four weekend meets where they journey either to the Caberfae or Crystal Mountains. At the meets there are two events, the slalom and the giant slalom, and points are awarded ac· cording to the place the racer finishes. At the end of the meet, the team with the lowest score wins. 
The ski team relies 80 percent on fund-raising; they raise money by selling Notre Dame turtleneck sweaters and working at concession stands at Irish football games. Since the turtlenecks are their main income, each member must sell 5· 10 shirts instead of paying a mem­bership fee. Currie noted that the team is primarliy organized for the purpose of racing, but that there have recreational skiers in the club. 
The Notre Dame men's team, cap­tained by John O'Donovan, started out slowly but quickly rebounded when it placed sixth on jan. 19, and third the day after in a meet that con· sisted of ten teams. The following weekend, the team competed against fifteen teams, and finished third on Saturday and second on Sunday. In its meet last weekend, the team captured first place. 
"This year's team is very young," says O'Donovan. "We only have one senior in the top five, that's Mike Ol­sen, and even though the loss of Mike will be greatly felt next year, we do have promising skiers on the team. Chris Simonet and Mike Mur­ray, are quickly becoming freshman sensations. A key to the team's suc­cess has been the improvement of 
Tony Jordan, the number-two racer." 
The number-one skier is 
O'Donovan, and he is considered 
one of the strongest men's skiers, 
having received individual medals at 
several of the meets, which has 
helped the team throughout the 
season. 
The Notre Dame women's ski 
team, captained by Kateri Gaffney, 
has had an average season. During 
the weekend of jan. 19 and 20, the 
team finished third out of ten teams 
on both days. But during the next 
weekend, it slipped to fourth on Sat· 
urday and finished fifth out offifteen 
teams on Sunday. Last weekend, the 
team placed fifth out of ten teams. 
"We have strong skiers, but we haven't been real consistent and that has hurt us thoughout the season," notes Currie. "Our strongest skier, 
K.K. Meyer, who is only a freshman, won a third place medal on January 
26. Unlike the men's team, we have three seniors: Kateri Gaffney, Kathy Karenzer, and myself. Even though Kathy is a senior, it is her first year of competing on the team, and she has done very well. Our other skiers are Molly Steber, a sophomore, and Stephanie Eck, who is our first alter­nate on the team and has competed in some ofthe meets." 
The Saint Mary's team, captained by Ann Ratledge, has also had an average year. In its opening meet on jan. 19 and 20, it placed fifth and sixth out of ten teams; a week later, the team finished seventh and eighth out of fifteen team. The Saint Mary's team is led by Shelia Smig­gens, a junior, lisa Hamann, Marry Keough, Karen Brady, and Ratledge. 
Now that the season is coming to a close, the teams' future might see some skiers performing in the divisionals.

Joseph Price 
"Before the season started," says the 6-5 graduate of Marion High School in Marion, Ind., "I was going to be starting. But all these injuries kept holding me back." 
Although Price felt depressed a bit, he turned it all around last Mon­day against Providence when he scored 11 points in the Irish victory. Since then, he has played very solid basketball, and has helped the team to four straight wins. 
"It was hard not to keep from being down because of all the injur­ies that I bad," says Price. "I knew I was behind, but I knew it was just a matter of time before I got my chance. 
"The three games before the 
--~-----~-------'------­
matched LaSalle squad, 71-58, and improve their record to 13· 5 on the season. LaSalle draped to 13·9. 
"We just couldn't find a basket," said Ervin. "Coming in, we'd been shooting over 53 percent as a team, but tonight, we just couldn't do it. I can't remember a more frustrating game, shooting-wise." 
LaSalle connected on only 22 of its 56 attempts from the field for 39 percent. Guard Steve Black had come into the game as the Ex­plorers' third all-time leading scorer, averaging 19.3 points a game this season, and although he finished with 16 points, it was on six-for-18 shooting. 
"One of the keys going into the game was knowing that LaSalle was going to start three guards," said Notre Dame head coach Digger Phelps. "We started (Donald) Royal on (LaSalle gttard Steve) Black so that we could really pound the boards." 
And pound they did. Notre Dame almost completely dominated the 
UCLA game, I'd been playing really well, but I didn't know the UCLA game wasgoing to turn out so well. So now I've got my chance and I'm taking advantage ofit." 
Indeed, in the UCLA game last 
Sunday, Price turned in an outstand­
ing effort. He scored eight points 
and made several key steals, while at 
the same time helping to limit Bruin 
guard Nigel Miguel to seven points. 
"I just wanted to go out and play like I knew I could play," says Price. "Before the game, Coach told me to play with confidence, and to just play my game like I had against Indiana. That really relaxed me, be­
cause I wanted to win that game really badly. We hadn't beaten them in such a long time. 
"When I was a freshman, I had my first start against UCLA. I did pretty well in that game, but not half as well as I did this game. Sunday's win over UCLA is probably my greatest vic­tory vet." 
Head Coach Digger Phelps also feels Price has come around since his early-season troubles. 
"I thinkJoseph has had his ups and downs like any athlete," says Phelps. "No one is going to play super bas­ketball for 28 games. He played very well against Indiana, then he broke his nose and it set him back. 
"After the holidays, I thought he 
was in a slump. Then he just sort of 
came out ofit. We gave him the start 
in the Providence game because we 
knew they were going to play a 
matchup zone, and we just feel Price 
is a better zone player than Hick.'i. 
"He's started to get his confidence going again, and he's just been doing the job both offensively and defensively ever since." 
Mthought Price has made great strides since his arrival at Notre Dame, it has not come without a great deal of work. While at Marion High, he had not been called upon to handle the ball as often as he was asked to for the Irish. Ballhandling was an immediate problem. 
"I've had to really work hard here," he says. "In high school, I really didn't have to handle the ball much. It's been a total transition, be-boards, outrebounding the Ex­plorers, 45-26. The frontline trio of Royal, Ken Barlow and Jim Dolan collected a total of 27 rebounds alone. 
"They just weren't hitting their shots," Phelps said. "And we were controlling the defensive boards." 
It didn't seem like it was going to be quite that easy, though. LaSalle hurried to an 11-4 advantage on the strength of six points from 6-6 cen­ter Ralph Lewis, but Barlow added six points of his own for the Irish as they cut the deficit to 16-12. 
The almost-lethargic ACC crowd of 10,750 then came to life as the Irish proceeded to run off a string of seven straight points to take the lead. Following forward Tim Kempton's premiere to a round of warm student applause, it was Rivers who stole the show.

cause I had to learn how to handle the ball here. 
"I've also had to work on my shooting and my defense. I really think my defense is coming. With some more work, I think I have the potential to be a good defensive player" 
"I think his ballhandling and his passing have been problems," com­ments Phelps. "But he's been drilling and drilling on these things. I think

Cross-country skiing is becoming more popular among ND students 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Editor 
Basketball has been one of the 
most popular recreational activities 
at Notre Dame for quite some time. 
Hundreds ofstudents grab a ball and 
head out to the courts with their 
friends every day for the exercise 
and break from studies. 
Playing some hoops is not the only popular activity on campus, though. You may not see it by walking around most ofthe campus, but the boom of cross-country skiing has begun. More and more people who want to enjoy the benefits of aerobic exercise are fin­ding that skiing around the golf course or the many trails in South Bend is the activity that they are looking for. 
It is doubtful that cross-country skiing will ever surpass basketball in popularity, but the interest in the sport among students and staff has increased tremendously -so much, in fact, that the Non-Varsity Athletics Office has planned a number of events and clinics to appeal to the growing number ofskiers. 
The latest, and possibly biggest, event is the NVA's "A Day at the Races," which will be held on Satur­day from noon to approximately 2 or 3 p.m. on the golf course. Ex­pected to be a "celebration ofcross­country skiing," the event includes 
races for both experienced and in­experienced skiers. 
"The event is designed for people with lots of experience who are looking for competition," says Sally Derengoski, the NVA's coordinator of recreational activities, "but there will also be events for people with 
little  or  no  experience  who  just  
want to have fun."  
Interested  skiers  can  sign  up  

today and tomorrow in the NVA of­
fice, or they can register by calling ·the NVA at 239-61 00. 
Derengoski expects a good tur­nout for the event, which probably would not been the case in previous years. There has always been a small group of people who enjoyed the solitude and vigorous exercise that is part of cross-country skiing, but not until now has there ever been a large demand for ski rentals and clinics. The demand has made events such as "A Day at the Races" possible. 
The growth in popularity is best exemplified by the drastic increase in weekend ski rentals. In previous years, the NVA would rent out about four or five pairs each weekend. That number has increased about 1000 percent this year. 
"The rentals have bC"en in· credible," says Dcrengoski. "We've been sold out every weekend so far this semester. We've tried to go out of the way to make rentals possible by getting the word out and lower­ing prices. It's helped us get a lot of repeat business. It's also allowed us to sponsor a lot ofdifferent activities that appeal to cross-country skiers. We wouldn't be able to have so many activities if the sport wasn't so popular." 
The growth in the popularity of cross-country skiing can be attrib­uted primarily to the increased con­cern about fitness that has become part of society. Aerobic exercise classes have never been more popular, while jogging and bicycling have also seen a rise in popularity. 
Of all these aerobic activities, though, cross-country skiing is prob­ably the most demanding physically. While other activities focus on cer­tain parts of the body, usually the lower body, skiing involves both the upper and lower parts of the body. The fact that it is an activity per­formed in cold weather with heavy clothing also makes for a more vigorous activity. 
The increase in popularity at Notre Dame can be attributed to more than the fitness boom, though. Derengoski points to three things in particular that have helped the sport. 
"We've been able to get the word out about our programs, which has really helped," she says. "Also, the
