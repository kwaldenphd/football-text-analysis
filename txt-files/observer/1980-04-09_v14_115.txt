Khomeini urges 
resistance 
by the Associated Press 

Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini urged Iranians yesterday to rejoice in their final break with the ''world-devouring plunder'' America, and the Tehran gov­ernment began mobilizing the people for a ''holy war'' of belt-ti~htening and possible rationmg to grapple with econ­omic woes. 
President Abolhassan Bani­Sadr declared there was "no reason to worry" about the U.S. economic embargo against Iran, but added that Iranians would need an extra effort to resist thc-pressure. 
In a m~.:::.sage to the nation, 
Khomeini said President 
Carter's anti-Iran ac-tions would 
have no effect on the status of 
the 50 U.S. Embassy hostages, 
in their 157th day of captivity in 
the hands of young Moslem 
radicals. 
He said a decision on their 
fate still must await convening 
of the new Iranian Parliament, 
which may be months away. 
When Carter announced the 
break in U.S.-Iranian diplo­
matic relations and the virtual 
trade ban Monday, he said 
"other actions" might be taken 
if the hostages were not releas­
ed "promptly." 
U.S. officials were not ruling out a naval blockade of Iranian ports or other military action. 
The Carter administration also sent strong signals to U.S. allies yesterday that it expects some help in the economic offensive, but there were no signs ofimmediate cooperation. 
Bani-Sadr said in a Tehran radio interview the captive Americans were being treated

Bro. Leo V. Ryan, Dean of 
the College of Business 
Administration, will resign 
his post to accept a similar 
position at the University of 
DePaul's College of Com­
merce in Chicago, it was 
announced yesterday. 
He will assume his new 
position duties September 1. 
Ryan has been Dean of 
Notre Dame's Business Col­
lege since 1975. He earned 
his M.B.A. in Marketing in 
1954 at DePaul, and in 1976, 
was honored by that Univers­
ity as a distinguished 
alumnus. 
Prof. Timothy O'Meara, University provost, praised Ryan's work at Notre Dame, commenting, "We are ..,!1 aware of the things he has 'done for the business 
school." 




ND plans an increase in total tuition bill 
by Mary Fran Callahan Senior StaffReporter 
In an interview given over spring break Richard Conklin, director of Information Services, released a tentative figure regarding the pending tuition increase which would bring next year's total bill to $6490, up from this year's $5630. 
Conklin explained that the figure was arrived at by an estimate which the University must annually submit to the College Scholarship Service. The tentative figure results from a prospective 14 percent increase in tuition and a 17 percent increase in room and board. 
Though the increases are not definite until the Board of Trustees approves it (they meet May 2), Conklin explained that in 
d:e past the Board has approved increases which usually fall within $100 of the original estimate. 
Conklin attributed the increase to the inflationary economy coupled with what he called ''a generous increase in University. employees' salaries." "The University has seen it has been underpaying its employees when compared to local rates,'' Conklin said. 
Though Tom Bull, Director of Personnel, declined to use the word underpaid, he yesterday acknowledged, ''Notre Dame was not strong in comparison with South Bend business." 
When questioned if the University is in danger of losing its clerical and service employees, he replied, "We have had more turnover than we've liked." He further explained that the University must remain competitive "wage-wise" in order to recruit employees. 
Bull, however, explained that the University has been economizing all year in an effort to remove financial burden from students' shoulders. "We cut maid service from five days a week down to two," he said. 
Though the Campaign for Notre Dame has generated $160 · million thus far, Conklin cited the rising inflation rate as a "losing battle." He said the University continually attempts to increase its endowment fund since interest can be gained from_

Prof.  Yusaku  Furuhashi,'

Cabinet Room where they were joined by their advisers for an additional 20 · inutes. In the afternoon, the "'VO leaders and tllc~r advisers met again for a 
-second session lasting an hour and 25 minutes. A third round of talks was schedulc-d this morning. , Powell left open the possibil­ity that further summit talks will be held after lsraeli Prime Minister Men:,chem Begin comes here to see Carter next week. Diplomatic sources were skeptical, meanwhile, that agreement on an autonomy plan for the Palestinians could be wrapped up during the Sadat and Begin visits. All key issues, includin~ how much authority the Palestmians are to have, rr.main unresolved with the May 26 target date for an agreement only five weeks away. Carter's hope is that he can work out guidelint ~ for Egypt­ian and Israeli negotiatmg teams in his separate talks with Sadat and Bc:gm. Those teams, headed by Egyptian Prime Min­ister Mustapha Khalil and Israeli Interior Minister Joseph 
Burg, may meet here toward the end of the month. 
Gu.uantees for Israel's secur­ity were the likely focus of the sessions. At the same rime, Sadat was expected to push for creation ofa Palestinian legisla­tive council and a rollback of Israeli forces on the West Bank of the Jordan River and in Gaza. 
As a gesture to Israel, which is concerned that such moves could lead to establishment of a Palestinian stare that threatens its existence, Egyptian sources indicated Sadat would sug~est demilitarization of the ~erntor­ies for five years and a neutral peace-keeping unit or mixed Egyptian-Israeli patrol. 
Whatever is hammered out by Carter and Sadar in their two-day talks will be submitted to Begm when he calls. 
Then it would be up to the negotiating teams headed by Khalil and Burg to try to translate the principles into an autonomy settlement by the deadline. 
If key issues remain unre­solved, U.S. and Egyptian offic­ials said Carter rmght hold a three-way summit meeting with Sadat and Begin along the lines of the Camp David sessions of September 1978. Those talks produced the framework for a peace treaty between Egypt 
and  Israel  and  the  current  
negotiations  over  Palestinian  
autonomy.

Carter warn.s allies to cooperate 
WASHir--iGTON (AP)  The Carter administration, raising a­new the possihility of a block~ ade of the Persian Gulf, warned 
U.S. allies vesterday that their oil supplies. could be jeopardi~­ed unless the~· cooperate tn pressuring Iran to free its 50 American hosr.tges. 
The qu<:··{iOI. of new action against Iran aro<>e when White House press secretary J ody Powell was asked to assess the reaction of U.S. allies to Presi­dent Carter's announcement Monday of new sanctions,_ m­cluding the hreaktng of dtplo­mati( rehtious with the Tehran government. . _ _ 
''We will be awaltlng wt~h interest their respor.se tn thts matter,'' Powell ~aid. Then he acided: 
"To the extent that they su_Pport us in these efforts, the cnsis is more l;kely to be resolved without the necessity of additional actions which could involve additional risks for all concerned." 
HDCenter moves to Washington 
The Center for Human Development, located at the University for five years, will be moving to Washington, D.C., on the campus of The Catholic University of America. 
Founded in 1972 by Rev. 
.Vincent Dwyer, the Center was associated with Saint Mary's College in Winona, Minn., before coming to Notre Dame in 1975. Its principal focus has been the development of pro­grams to foster the spiritual renewal of Catholic priests. Joining forces with individual dioceses, the Center uses mod­ern assessment tools to discern the needs of priests, sponsors training programs for diocesan directors of continuing edw::a­twn and their teams, and establishes diocesan structures through which spiritual growth can be enhanced. The Center has worked with almost one­third of the country's 168 dioceses, and about one-sixth of the nation's 35,500 diocesan clergy have participated in its programs. 
University and Center offi­cials said the Center would be better able to meet its needs in the new location. The move is expected to take place in early 
July. 
Powell characterized his ref­erence to possible additional action as "a clear statement of policy.'' 
Asked if he could be more specific about additional ac­tions, Powell replied, "I could be but I'd rather not be at this point.·· 
However, it was understood that options for future action that are considered open by the administration include a naval Diockade of Iran's se~ m11tes or che rnin.i.ng of its oil ports. 
Either move would have a major (mpacr on U.S. allies who are heavily dependent on im­ports 0t Iranian oil. Powell's remarks came shortly after the State Department issued a warning to U.S. allies that their Iranian oil supplies could be placed in danger if they do not support the new sanctions. 
lranian olficials have strongly indicated they will cut off oil shipments to any country that joins in the U.S sanctions. 
The  public  warnings  were  
issued  as  American diplomats  
talked  to  officials  in  several  

dozen countries, asking them to impose trade sanctions of their own against Iran. 
The FBI shadowed Iranian diplomats as they made ar­rangements to leave the coun­try before a midnight deadline imposed by President Carter when he broke diplomatic re­lations with Iran on Monday. 
The State Department placed precise limits on travel for the 35 diplomats affected by Mon­day's expulsion order' allowing them to travel no more than two miles from home or work. 
Another 209 Iranian soldiers in military training courses were also required to leave. Officials said some Iranians had asked for political asylum, but as of mid-afternoon, no re­quests had been approved. They refused to give details. 
Carter announced the de­cision to break relations with Iran in a television address Monday. At the same time, he announced new economic sanc­tions in an effort to pressure the Iranian government to release the 50 Americans who have been held hostage since the 
U.S. Embassy in Tehran was overrun by militants on Nov. 4. 
... Tuition 
[continued from page 1] 
Conklin attempted to justify the increase when he comment­ed, "It (the University) simply has to keep pace. " 
Conklin further commented on the escalating tuition costs which students may have diffi­culty paying. "We are CC>'I· scious of the danger of pr!cir,g ourselves out of the mtdole class market, but there is 1 1 way we are going to shm ­change parents who are sen·i­ing their sons and daughters here to get a ftrst rate educa­tion," he said. 
He added that 66 l?ercent of the student body received some form of financial aid and called Notre Dame's tuition "still a bargain" when compared to "peer schools" such as the University of Chicago, Prince­ton and Stanford. 
The escalating costs, how­ever, have not deterred high school students from seeking admission. John Goldrick, director of Undergraduate Admission, yesterday said that the number of applicants has increased this year-despite a $10 raise in the application fee. 
Conklin speculated that the 

rising costs are sending 
mothers back to work to enable 
payment.

WASHINGTON (AP) -"We are sailing in a sea of diffi­culties. We have been in this sea for some time, but the shore is far away." 
In that way, Cuban President Fidel Castro candidly acknowl­edged last December that his 
revolution had fallen  on  hard  
times.  
At  the  time,  there  were  

reports of increased street cnme, worker absenteeism and black market activities. In ad­dition, pamphlets and posters denouncing the regime began to appear in Havana. There also has been a dramatic rise in the number of Cuban "boat people" arriving in the United States. 
But nothing has quite so dramatized popular disaffection · for the regime as has the appearance of thousands of Cubans on the grounds of the Peruvian embassy in recent days, seeking political a?ylum. 
the inundation of the 'embas­sy was touched off a week ago when a Cuban policeman was killed in a cross-fire while six Cubans seeking asylum were trying to crash their bus onto the embassy grounds. The refu­gees came in droves a few days later when the government withdrew its security guards from the embassy and announc-
Census Bureau experiences problems 
Some people didn't get any 
census forms at all. Other 
people got more than one. The 
lieutenant governor of Wiscon­
sin was left out. A 14-year-old 
dog in Rhode Island was includ­
ed. 
An Associated Press spot 
check one week after Census 
Day -April 1 -showed that the 
count is going smoothly in most 
places, but there are scattered 
problems. 
Several district offices of the 
Census Bureau say they are 
having trouble recruiting work­
ers for the follow-up visits that 
will begin Aprill6. Some-places 
report thousands · of people 
were missed in the initial 
mailing late last month. 
Nationwide, just over 53 per­
cent of the households in the 
country had returned their 
forms as of last Thursday 
afternoon, the Census Bureau 
said. In some areas, the return 
rate is running as high as 90 
percent. 
The town of Secretary, Md. ­
population 500 -was inadver­
tently ignored by the Census 
Bureau. "It was the talk of the 
town,'' said Geraldine Larri­
more, a local resident. 
Mayor Robert Peters said he was worried the town would lose the $4,000 it gets in federal revenue sharing money each year. Mike Mulrine, district director for the census office in Dover, Del., said the town was left out of the computer used for mailing addresses due to hu­man error. He promised to take care of the problem. 
Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Rus'5ell Olson said he was "really miffed" that he didn't get a form. Olson moved recently and his new home is at an address that apparently didn't exist when the last census was taken 10 years ago. "He will receive one at his new address," said Lois Sixel, manager of the census office in Madison. W.is. 
Ms. Sixel said letter earners had filled out slips for address­es -like Olson's-which weren't around 10 years ago and forms are being sent to all the missed people.

Castro faces hard titnes in Cuba 
ed that those seeking asylum would be allowed to leave. 
In truth, U.S. officials say, economic difficulties have spread throughout the Carib­bean over the past few years. And, as Castro tirelessly points out, Cuba, despite its difficul­ties, is well ahead of the rest of the Caribbean in health care and education. 
On the other hand, no Carib­bean country has received for­eign assistance on the scale that Cuba has be_en receiving from the Soviet Union, currently about $8 million a day. 
But Soviet aid has not offset a number of problems affecting the Cuban economy. In a speech to the Cuban National Assembly last winter, Castro noted that much of the coun­try's tobacco crop has been w1ped out by disease. In addi­tion, "plant rot" is threatening Cuba's vital sugar harvest. The 
U.S. economic embargo also is frequently blamed for Cuban economic troubles. 
Cuban officials admit, how­ever, that the::.e factors are not entirely to blame for Cuba'~, economic plight. Castro', brother, Raul, m an unusualh frank speech last fall, als;, criticized Cuba's workers fo1 "lack of discipline and controL irresponsibility, negligence and cronyism."

Barbara Bentley of Coventry, R.I., had a different problem. The form in her mailbox was addressed to George Bentley. George is her dog. 
Mrs. Bentley returned the form to the Coventry post office. Norman Plante, super­intendent of the mails, sent it back to the census takers in Warwick, R.I. "I don't know where they got their mailing lis,,'' Plante commented. 
Census forms sent to ufban areas, contain only a mailing address, but those sent to rural areas also list the name of-the recipient. Census officials said parts of Coventry are ruraL but no one could explain why the form Mrs. Bentley received was addressed to her· dog. 
Connie Smith of the regional census office for California and Hawaii said, ''There have been some problems. But consider­ing the enormity of the project, it seems we've done very well on it " 
She said the bureau still needs workers. "We have found in the past there is a big turnover. And many offices don't have enough people yet.'' Census officials SaJd last week that hiring remained a problem in several areas, but that re­c_ruiting efforts were con­nnumg.

Candidates look to Indiana 

INDIANAPOUS (AP) ­Ronald Reagan, ] ohn Ander­son,Jimmy Carter and Edward Kennedy will be household words in Indiana by the time the May 6 presidential primary rolls around.

nmary are j4 Republican dele­!ates and 80 Democratic dele­gates, numbers that place Indiana close to the middle in the number of delegates that can be won. 
States like California, Texas 
and New York provide sreater 
rewards to primary wmners, 
but states like New Hampshire 
or Wisconsin provide fewer 
delegates. 

The rules differ in each party contest on the way delegates will be apportioned among pri­mary winners. 
In the Democratic primary, any candidate winning more than 20 percent of the vote in all but two fo the state's 11 congressional districts will ~et delegates. In the 6th Distnct, the_ percentage is 25 percent, whtle a 17 percent win will pick up a delegate in the lst District.

delegates will be apportioned according to the statewide vote. 
The Democrats will apportion their at-large delegates accord­ing to the way congressional district delegates are appor­tioned. For example, a candi­dare winning 40 percent of the delegates on a con~ressional district basis also wdl get 40 percent of the statewide dele­gates. 
That means the Republican primary could be a winner-take­all contest if a candidate won a majority of the vote in each congressional district, while both Carter and Kennedy are expected to pick up Democratic delegates. 
Most candidates will be spending several days in Indiana before the May 6 contest. 
Reagan is coming to Indiana Tuesday, where he will speak to Terre Haute, and will visit Evansville and Lafayette the nexfweek. 
Chris Long, a spokesman for the Indiana Carter-Mondale campaign, said Vice-President Walter Mondale, Carter family members and Cabinet officials will represent the president in the state. She said no firm schedules have been drawn up yet.

Iranian television last night showed film of the-hostages as they were visited last Sunday by three American clergymen who presided at Easter services in the embassy. 
In the film the hostages appeared in generally good sptrits, although some seemed nervous, as they chatted with the visiting ministers. 
Khomeini told Iranians that Carter's break in relations was a "good omen" because it meant the United States has lost all hope ofcontrolling Iran. 
The ruling RevolutiOnary Council met in an extraordinary session yesterday with provin­cial governors general to dis­cuss steps that should be taken as a result of Carter's new sanctions. 
Council spokesman Hassan Habibi said they were consider­ing a "holy war" that might mean rationing of consumer goods, putting a lid on wages and clamping d'?wn on hoarde~s and others causmg shonages 10 domestically produced goods.

People in rural Wyoming counties were told to keep their forms, but many of them are mailing them in anyway. About a dozen people mailed 01 brought the forms to the Raw­lins Daily Times.

It seems that the last seven digits of the Census Bureau's toll-free, 800 telephone number are the same as Ms. Master-

"I've complained to everyone I can," Ms. Masterson said, adding that on top ofeverything else, she got the long census form instead of the short one.

LOS ANGELES --There is a lot of scandal going on in college athletic programs these days. The Pacific Athletic Con­ference, composed of the major West Coast schools, is under fire because evidence is build­

I believe the schools are taking a bad raJ>. Every college coach I've talked to has assured me that each student on his team has a faculty adviser, who counsels the athlete on his education and makes sure he keeps up his grades. I was even permitted to attend a session with an All­American running back and his adviser at Unbeaten State of Southern California. 
The adviser said, ''Light· ning, I've been studying your transcripts and you're doing quite well."

Republicans Ronald Reagan and George Bush, who have been takwg turns second­;:1essing President Carter's. Iranian policy, parted company ' yesterday on the president's call for a U.S. boycott of the Summer Olympics in Moscow. Bush accused Reagan of taking a ''wishy-washy position'' on the issue. 
Campaigning in Pennsyl­vania, Bush told the World Affairs Council: "I find it outrageous that this natin has not rallied behind our presi­dent. I'm appalled that my principal opponent for the Re­publican presidemial nomina­tion has taken a wishy-washy position on this issue."

Hammer said. "The Volleyball Committee had originally ex-peered to form about 128 teams 
of six to eight players each, but expanded to accomodate the 166 tefims that registered." 
Hammer attributes much of the increase in enthusiasm to changes in the sign-up proce­dure. This year, Mud Volley­ball teams and Bookstore Bas­ketball teams registered con­currently.

Carter has repeatedly ex­
horted U.S. athletes to back his 
boycott, but has stopped short 
of threatening any reprisals 
against those who fail to do so. 
While Bush and Reagan re­newed the dialogue on the Olympics, supporters of Rep. John Anderson were reported circulating petitions for an in­dependent presidential bid by the veteran Illinois congress­man. 
And in Pittsburgh, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy renewed his assault on Carter's treat­ment of the steel industry.

I_n voicing support for Carter's Olympic stand, Bush said, "Today, I am urging the president not only to stand firm but to -take additional action that will ensure the finality of his decision and put an end to the public debate over the participation of our athletes." 
In late January, Carter called for a U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics to be held in Moscow this July in reprisal for the Soviet military thrust into Afghanistan.

Notre Dame's First Chicano Film Festival, sponsored by the Mexican American Graduate Students and MECHA, will be held Wednesday through Sat­urday at 7 p.m. in the Library Auditorium. The public is invited to attend and then; is no charge for admission. 
A news documentary on Chicano farmworkers in the Midwest and the efforts of the predominantly Chicano Farm Labor Organizing Com­mittee (FLOC) to organize these workers in a ltnion will be shown 1hursday. This film. made in December 1979-by a

praying for a settlement. 
"I guess we'll just help out with the minor leagues,'' said Pirate coach Bob Skinner as he watched Vance Law, a young­ster in the Bucs' system, sign 
auto~raphs. 
Skmner named Law, son of former ditching star Vernon Law, an Dale Berra as two of the Pirates' best bets for the future. Coincidently, Berra is the son of former catching great Yogi. And you ran bet the younger Berra, an infielder by trade, is reminded often enough  his ~;>arentage. 
"Hey, Yog1," said Dave Roberts to the 23-year-old Berra during a game with the St. Louis Cardinals, "how many interviews did ya get today?" 
"Just two," came back Berra. 
"Well, if everybody knew my dad I might get a few, too!" smarted Roberts. 
Berra was not the only scapegoat of Pirate barbs, nor was Roberts the only tease. Dave Parker, MVP of the 1979 All-Star Game and a Golden Glove outfielder, received and dished out his fair share of abuse in the fun, yet produc­rive, Pirate camp. 
After smacking his second homerun in a 6-1 win over the Cards, Parker trotted out to his home turf in right field, 'con­veniently located near the bull­pen, only to be abused by his teammates. 
"OOOOOOie. He's a king," lashec;l out Craig Cacek. "Dialin' long distance, huh Dave?~' offered Steve Nicosia. "Awesome,"-burst everyone else in the bullpen. The slugg~r was~'t to be o~tdone by hls budd1_es, so t~e 
TV news station in Toledo, Ohio, describes the strug~,~;les of the first farmworker umon to arise in the Midwest and pro­vide:; multi-dimensional cover­age of the issues surrounding the FLOC organization. 
The FLOC documentary will be followed by The Unwanted, a film by ] ose Luis Ruiz that examines the economic and sociological implications of undocumented Mexican workers. 
Thursday night has been designated as a fundraiser for FLOC. Donations are encour­aged. 
nobody got hurt downtown, 
did they?'' 
Sor,le of the cage talk did center around the free agent mess with some not-so-nice comments coming from players. 
''I'm sick of this free agent ----," harpecl one Pirate. "Look at Regg1e Jackson. He doesn't even hit over 300 and he's getting bucks. That's just a million dollar mouth." 
Nowadays everybody wants to be in a commercial. Prior to a game with the Phillies catchers Ott and Nicosia were clowning around the batting cage when Ott sniffed, "Mmmmm, somebody smells good." 
The duo zeroed in on Observer photographer Lisa Gasiorek and the undeniable scent of Sweet Honesty. 
"Must be .your after shave," smarted Gasiorek. "You oughta do a commer­cia!,'' I cracked back. 
"Yeah, I can sure sing better than Ruse!" laughed Ott, just 10 feet away from the former Cincinnati switch-hitter. 
Little kids are now wise to the advertisement business. If just one more little tyke offered Parker or Willie Stargell a Coke I would have died. 
No amount of clowning around or hard work can give this story a happy ending. The Pirates, along with the 25 other major league teams. want that coveted 198(J WorldChampion­ship title, but before October, an awful lot of give-and-take needs to take place in negotia­tions.

Baseball season opens today 

There are no last-place teams <lO Opening Day and so Atlanta .and Toronto, a pair of perennial basement occupants, start the I 'J80 haseball season tf'..tay full ,f optimism. 
The Braves, who finished at rlw hottom of the National f.e:1gue West in 1979, help the 
1 ..·is ion champion Cincinnati 
:cds open the NL season in a 
·ay game. Tht·n Toronto, 
hich has never finished any­
·lace bur last in the American 
.eague East, gets the AL ,eason going with a night game :lt Seattle. 
Atlanta, which finisred a fat .!3 1/z games behind the Reds last season, will send veteran knuckleball ace Phil Niekro to the mound against Tom Seaver of the Reds. Niekro was 21-20 last season and celebrated his 41st birthda}' last week. Seaver, 3'\, finished 16-6 in 1979, winning 11 straight games. The usual Opening Day sellout ofmore than 52,000 fans will jam Riverfront Stadium for the contest. 
The Blue Jays, with 109 defeats in 1979, the most losses of any team, will use Dave Lemanczyk, 8-10, against Seattle's Mike Parrott, 14-12. A crowd of20,000 is expected at the Seattle Kingdome for that game. 
There are four more openers scheduled for the Nauonal League tomorrow with Chicago at New York and Pittsburgh at St. Louis in day games and Los Angeles at Houston and San Francisco at San Diego in night contests. Montreal plays at Philadelphia Friday night com­pleting the NL slate of openers. 
In the AL, Baltimore plays at Chicago and Boston is at Milwaukee in day games tomor­row with Minnesota at Oakland, New York at Texas and Detroit at Kansas City at night. The final AL opener is scheduled for Friday night in California where Cleveland plays the Angels. 

The Braves and Blue Jays both have undergone some restructuring, part of it com­pleted in a trade between the two teams. 
Atlanta acquired ex-New York Yankee first baseman Chris Chambliss and shortstop Luis Gomez in a deal which delivered outfielder Barry Bonnell and pitcher Joey McLaughlin to the Rlue Jays. The Braves also picked up pitcher Doyle Alexander and

In addition to McLaughlin and Bonnell, the Blue Jays carne up with pitcher Paul Mirabella and infielder Darnaso Garcie from the Yankees in the same trade in which they got Chambliss. 
Toronto also has a new manager, 64-year-old Bob 
A few of the current members of the team agree with their coach and with Digger. 
"I think the change is good because it shows progress,'' said junior guard Maggie Lally, who next year should become the first four year member of the women's team in its years as a varsity sport. "It will bring in better talent, and competition. It was inevitable that they would upgrade the program, and I'm glad to see it happening now.''

men and women should be working together. Now, the student body will be able to see both teams compete in one evening, which wtll mean a lot in terms of school spirit. 
I've contended for a long time that Notre Dame is first class,'' she added, ''and if some of her teams are big time, then all of them should be big time. This is !1 step in that direction, and I thmk that's a good sign."

Mattick, who has spent a lifetime in the scouting side of baseball. 
Today's games will be the first played since April 1 when the Players Association called an eight-day strike wiping out the final 92 games of the exhibition season. The regular season starts with a shadow hanging over the calendar be cause the players have pled~ed to walk out again on May 23 if a new contract with the owners is not signed by that date. 
...Petro 
went on to say that she didn't think that change would hurt the team mentally. 
"We feel pretty good when we play well, even when we lose. In the past, we've had a tendency to play well against the better teams so if we can maintain that, we should be able to get a lot of satisfaction out of the season, whether we have a winning or a losing record.'' 
One of Lally's teammates, freshman Shari Matvey, agreed that there will be satisfaction to be gotten out of next season, and is ready to start that season at any time. 
'Tm really excited about this change and I'm glad we're making the transition now," stated Matvey, who hails from Austintown, Ohio. "We're going to be big time now, and get all the publicity and ores­tige that goes with it, and I'm just really excited to be a part of all that.'' 
One of the areas which will be effected by the change im­mediately is that of scheduling. 
If the team is going to compete on a Division I level, it must play an excess of Division I schools. This past season, a total of four such schools were on the schedule, including Michigan, South Dakota, St. Louis, and Illinois-Chicago Cir­cle. The closest Petro's team came to beating any one of those schools was six-point loss to Michigan in overtime. 
All four schools have been scheduled again for next year, as well as Miami University of Ohio. Other names being thrown around as additions to next year's schedule are Mary­land, Virginia, and South Car­olina, all division one schools, (Maryland and South Carolina were in the AlA W national tournament's final four) and Dayton, Division II national chamfions this past year. 
Unti a new coach is officially named, a lot of problems will be left undecided, such as scheduling, allocation of schol­arships, and personnel to be involved in the program, but there is one thing for certain: the change is here. And not only is it sudden, like all the other changes made at this University, it shares another trait with those changes.

~J>orts

Change. At a university as nch in tradition as Notre Dame, that word isn't heard roo often. Coaches have a tendency to staj· around into the double-digits numbers of years. Administrators ar d professnrs don't come and go roo rapidly. Women have only heen a parr of this campus for 
·tghr years. Yes, things just don't chan~e 
'''' much around here. Year-m · md year-our, life just goes on. But every once in a while, you 
1~er rhe shocker. A pnest 
narneJ Hesburgh becomes Uni­
\ ers1ty president. Dan Devine 
replaces a iegend named Ara. 
Female co-eds invade a pre­
viously all-male campus. 

Shock seems to be a predomi­''anr reaction to changes at this university, because they occur -;o suddenly. Like this Title IX 1hing. Granted, it was only a matter of time, but the change, t·specially in the area of wom­en's basketball, has taken more . than a few people by surpnse. 
Just to recap something you've probably heard many rimes already, the program will cease to operate on the Divi­sion III level, and will next year become Division I. This will entitle the University to hand our up to 12 grants-in-aid to members of the women's team. 
'J'he allocation of these will be left up to the discretion of the coach. And speaking of the coach, a screenmg process will be set up to name one of those, hopefully by the middle of April, this in compliance with a federal regulation on the avail­ability of position in an athletic department. Current Coach Sharon Petro is one of those being considered. 
The man put in charge of overseeing all operation until such a time as a head coach is named, is Digger Phelps, coach of the men's team and chairman of the basketball department. 
According to Phelps, the change promises to be a bene­ficial one. 
"I think that it (the women 

Baseball 's villain strikes again 
competing on a division one 
lc:;vel) will be a ~reat opportu­
nity for the Uotver:;iry," said 
Phelps before break. "This is 
going to put us in a position 
where the women's team will 
eventually be able to compete 
on the same success level as 
the men already do. I think it's 
an excellent move. 

"Now of course, it's difficult to predict the immediate effect of the change in terms of what it will do to the team's record next year," he continued. '' Afterall, my first year with the men's ream, we lost to UCLA by 58 points. But there's no doubt in my mind that we can catch up to the rest of the field, and sooner than you might think." 
Petro, who just completed her third year as head coach of the women's team, did not expect such a drastic change, but agrees with Digger that the change should be a good one. 
''The philosophy of the pro­gram is gceat," she stated earlier. "I think that ideally, this is a great situation. The

Weather delays drills 
by Craig Cht;a/ Sports Wn.ter 

Notre Dame's annual spring drills, originally postponed two weeks in the hopes of better weather, were set back another day Tuesday when the second 
session was washed out ... the players instead worked out indoors ... several representa-­tives of NFL teams, including head coach Chuck Noll of the World Champion Pittsburgh Steelers, were on hand Tuesday to time some of the Notre Dame squad ... former Notre Dame All-America center Dave Huffman, now employed by the NFL's Minnesota Vikings, was in town to check up on the progress of his "little" brother Tim ... at 6-5 and 250 pounds, Tim goes by the otckname 
BRADENTON, Fla.--Once upon a time there was a thing called Spri~"g Trainmg. Then along Lame Srrike Two. Stnke Two, the villain of this smry, rw.l;ed ~nring Training exactly one week prior to thf' openin~ day of baseball. The villain 1s a crear Jre fabncated by stubborn owners, !>tubborn players, and of course, Marvin Miller, rhe player~· representative in the whole c:xr ravaganza. 
~;trike Two came as expected, but with some rarher unexpected connotations. The expected ~ oycott rc~ulted from stalemated negotiations berween the owners and players over -what el;;e-free agency. Players want the mandatory '>ix years wn:1 an initial club (which currently allows for fn·e agency eligibility) cut to four. The ownt:"rs refuse. Owners want compensation for the loss of a !'rt:"e agent. The players refuse 
So, with neit'Jer sidt:" willing to give an im~h the players deuded to hit the owners where ti. ' hurts the most (the pocket} by striking. The big question before the 26 player representatives who met in Dallas was not whether or not to strike, but when. Ske?tics said an immediate strike was imn!inent. others predicted the walkout for Memorial Day Weekend, the upswing date for ticket sales. The players ''Tiny,'' and should merit con­siderable 41l-America mention next fall as a senior offensive guard ...

Sports Editor· ingeniously (brainstormed by Miller, I'm sure) opted for a combination of the two: a walkout on spring training, showing the owners they mean business; followed by a brief O(>ening of baseball; and then the big boycott begmning on May 23. 

"We're not telling anyone our secrets," said Ed Ott, catcher for the World Champion Pittsburgh Pirates. 
fhe unexpected strike-play-strike theory of rht' .layers surprised everybody, because it was hustness-as-usual in camp up until the walk out. The Pirates, baseball's closest knit ­"family," abused, encouraged, and entertained fans, oppone:lts and one another in their short spring work out.

Irish Items ~-;-----------.....·
-,.:~ 
by BillMarquard 

Editor's Note: Today 's Insh Items zs the first ofa regular series by Bill Marquard which includes notes and bits of interest involving Notre Dame athletics. 
For the third straight year Notre Dame's basketball team 
drew the largest nation! television crowds on NBC. Once 
the ratings from this season's roster of nationally-televised 
regular games were tallied the Notre Dame/Maryland, 
Notre Dame/UCLA and Notre Dame/Marquette games 
finished 1-2-3 in the ratings derby. 
It was also estimated that the Notre DameI DePaul game 
beamed to about 90 percent of the country by Metromedia 
Communications Sports, was viewed by an estimated 20 
million people. That's three times the audience which NBC 
usually draws for ii:s Sunday national game .. .In the highly 
competitive Chicago market, for example, the Notre 
Dame/ DePaul game drew a 21 percent rating, meaning that 
21 of every 100 households in Chicago were tuned to that 
game. The teleca~: drew a 31 percent share, meaning 31 
out of every 100 TV sets turned on in Chicago were 
watching the Irish beat the Blue Demons. Such impressive 
off-the-court statistics should guarantee Notre Dame a lot of 
television exposure in the future and a big chunk of that 
prime television dollar. 

TO BOYCOTT OR... -Gene Oberst, who won a bronze 
medal in the javelin in the 1924 Olympics just weeks after 
graduating from Notre Dame, is another of the growing 
contingent that opposes an Olympic boycott this summer. 
'They are a place where athletes make friends. It can only help the cause of international relations,'' remarked the elder alumnus. 
RECRUITING REPORT--Today is the first day for 
seniors to sign national letters of intent for basketball. It 
should be the end of harassment for a lot of 18 year olds 
around the country and the end (or start) of ulcers for a lot 
of coaches. 

TRAVEL REPORT--The outlook is quite rosy for a lot of 
the Irish athletic teams this sprin~--wm or lose. Many of 
those suntanned complexions walkmg across campus belong 
to members of Irish teams who managed to migrate south 
last week. The tennis team played a week of exhibition 
matches in Mexico, the women's tennis team took refuge in San Antonio, the lacrosse team journeyed to Houston, the crew team practiced in J acksonvdle and the track team ran at Middle Tennessee State (which is still closer to Florida than South Bend). Even the baseball team made a mini-southern swing ... through Cincinnati. 
BASKET WEAVING The current turmoil about 
falsified college transcripts and grades has spread to the 
University of Southern California, where football coach John 
Rol)inson admitted that he was "naive" in handling 
classroom matt~rs with his plafers before. As part of an 
interview concerning the scanda Robinson told an Associat­
ed Press correspondent, ''If I find out that my tailback has 
missed class the week of the Notre Dame game--and I'm 
going to be supplied V\oith this kind of information--then he's 
not goin~ to play against Notre Dame." That might be 
easier said than done. 

NETWORK BACKGAMMON--Notre Dame's dream doubleheader slated for next November has fallen victim to network insomnia. As of a few months ago, Notre Dame was slated to play USC in football on November 29, the Saturday after Thanksgiving, in the Los Angeles Coliseum. Only hours after the cpnclusion of that game, the Irish were supP.osed to tip-off against UCLA in basketball at Pauley Pavdion. An Irish fan's and senior trip planner's dream, right? Not any more. ABC moved the USC game to December 6 to fill an otherwise uneventful weekend in college football, and since UCLA is playing football in the Mirage Bowl on that Saturday night the Notre Dame/UCLA showdown has been changed to Sunday afternoon, November 30, in anticipation of a possible television appearance. 
As if ABC had not rearranged our schedule enough, they moved the Purdue home game from September 27 to Sef ... mber 6, thus P.ushing the season opener ahead two weeks. Students wlll have their first home football game much sooner than usual in the school year with the 2:20 
p.m. EST game against the Boilermakers. Listed as the "principal game" of all ABC regionals that weekend, the Notre Dame ~arne aginst Purdue should reach a majority of the country smce ABC's other regional offerings are Wake Forest vs. Virginia Tech. and Tulane vs. Southern Mississippi. 
Notre Dame thus has three open weekends next year in what was originally a breakless schedule. The Irish will have off-weekends before three major games: September 13 before Michigan, September 27 before Michigan State and November 29 b(' ~ '"e USC. 
That should ~ .c.e summ-er practice a little longer and a little hotter.
