Annan set to speak at ND event 
Schedule permitting, U.N. secretary-general will address students, faculty on Nov. 12 
By MARY KATE MALONE News Editor 
United Nations Secretary­General Kofi Annan is sched­uled to be the keynote speak­er for a peace conference at Notre Dame Nov. 12-14, a MP.ndoza College of Business official said Monday. 
Annan has confirmed that he plans to attend, but given the nature of his job he can make no guarantees he will be there, said Father Oliver Williams, director of the Center for Ethics and 

Religious Studies in Business in the Mendoza College of Business. 
"It is like inviting the President of the United States," said Williams, who is the lead organizer of the peace conference titled "A Conference on Peace through Commerce: Partnerships as the New Paradigm." 
If Annan is able to come, he will speak Nov. 12. The loca­tion of his talk has not yet been determined, but would be in a larger venue like McKenna Hall to accommo­date a bigger audience, Williams said. 
The conference is being put on by the Center for Ethics and Religious Values in Business, the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, the United 
Nations Global Compact Office and the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. 
It will bring together stu­dents, professors, corpora­tions, non-government organ­izations and government leaders to discuss how com­merce can be a tool to build peace. 
Annan will speak to that, Williams said. 
"I think the wider theme [of the conference] is peace through commerce and how companies can work with Oxfam and Amnesty International to try to find ways to bring justice and peace to troubled lands," Williams said. 
University President Father John Jenkins wrote a letter to Annan last fall asking him to speak at the conference. Annan confirmed, but Williams was advised two weeks ago to prepare a back­up speaker in case Annan is needed in another part of the world during the conference. Williams. said Annan recently has been spending consider­able time in Lebanon, the Darfur region of Sudan and various Middle Eastern nations. 
Williams knows Annan through his work on the U.N.'s Foundation for the· Global Compact, a non-profit entity that helps fund the Global Compact-the world's la-rgest voluntary corporate citizenship initiative. Williams was appointed to one of three director positions last spring,

Service retnembers Sept. 11 victitns, soldiers 
5 years later, ROTC, students gather to pray 
By RYAN SYDLIK News Writer 
More than 40 civilians gath­ered with ROTC cadets, mid­shipmen and their officers in front of the Hesburgh Library reflecting pool Monday morn­ing for a brief but poignant ceremony in remembrance of those who died five years ago in the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The service began with an invocation by Basilica Rector Father Peter Rocca, who asked God to "protect in a special way, these young men and women, cadets and mid­shipmen, as they prepare to serve their country." 

Guest speaker of honor Gunnery Sgt. Ralph "Lefty" Guillette not only earned numerous medals and awards during his service in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, but also holds the distinction of being the oldest under­graduate student in the hist.o­ry of Notre Dame at the age of 75. 
"Today is not a day of cele­bration," he said. "Today is to honor and pay tribute to the fallen brothers and sisters that [died] on Sept. 11."

Cell phone reception still shaky 
New towers unable to accommodate football crowds last weekend 
ByJOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
Instead of calling friends and family to proclaim the news of a big win over Penn State, many Irish fans found themselves asking, "Can you hear me now?" when using their cell phones on campus Saturday. 
The campus cell phone antenna system may be powerful enough to handle 12,000 students, but it is too weak to support 80,000 foot­ball fans-something Notre Dame students and guests will have to deal with during the season's six remaining home games.

Police cite 41, arrest 5 at game 
Alcohol violations similar to last year 
By MADDIE HANNA News Writer 
Police arrested five people and cited at least 41 both before and during Saturday's football game against Penn State -a very similar count to last year's home opener against Michigan State. 
During the game, 13 people were removed from Notre Dame Stadium for "alcohol related violations," two were arrested and two were "transported by ambulance to the hospital due to intoxica­tion," Associate Director of Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) Phil Johnson said in an e-mail Monday. 
Officers outside the stadi­um, Johnson said, made three custodial arrests for public intoxication and issued 28 arrest tickets for "alcohol related offenses such [as] minor consuming and using a false 10." 
At the first home game of last season -the Sept. 1 7 Michigan State matchup ­police arrested four people and cited 46. 
Johnson did not say whether those arrested, cited or removed from the stadium on Saturday were Notre Dame or Saint Mary's stu­dents. He did not mention any marshmallow-related ejections from the stadium.

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 

Task force created to target student safety 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Writer 
Student safety, both on cam­pus and off, dominated discus­sion at the Campus Life Council 
(CLC) meeting Monday. 
Members unanimously voted to create an ad-hoc task force to address student safety con­cerns in light of recent violence against students while off cam­pus. Hall Presidents Council co­chair Katie Cordelli was unani­mously approved as the chair of the Student Safety task force. 
Student body president Lizzi Shappell said student safety has become a pressing con­
cern. "It's a hot issue among the student body," she said. 
The CLC discussed the topics the ad-hoc group could tackle this year. Alumni senator Danny Smith said the goal of the task force should be to address the prevention of vio­lence against students as quick­ly as possible. 
"We want to make off-cam­pus kids feel safe as well as on­campus kids," Smith said. 
Assistant Vke President for Student Affairs G. David Moss said the transition from Notre Dame's campus to an off-cam­

Your cinder block walls morph into an ultra-hlp comedy club (which you can barely see through your tears anyway because you're laughing so hard) all because a voice from your computer just blasted out the classic "WHOPPER-NO­ONIONS!" 
Right then you're not really sure if you're laughing because you are "that" guy/girl, or because you have been on the receiving end of said ignoramus' vocal explosions. 
But oh, ifDane Cook were actually here, now that would be awesome ... "I just have one question for you guys, what is a 'Domer'? 
"I mean I've heard of a dome. A nice semi-circular-esque shape, an inverted cup form, a sphere split in half. I know dome. 
''I'm not really sure how you be a dome though. Are you all half-rounded, cup-ish objects? Half-rolling, half-flop­ping around campus? Just waiting until one day you happen to flop your flat side down onto your other 'Domer' half and you guys form a sphere, and then you can go rolling happily through life together? 
"No more getting stuck, half-rolled on your backside like a flipped over tiny turtle, little legs flailing uselessly in the air! 
"Whew! Good thing the University gives you a little shove to get you rolling. Freshman year, you get here, and like you're not already a target for all the upper-classmen who scoff 'freshman' under their breath every time you do something stupid for like the first six months. 
"Like you're not feeling awkward enough, the school goes and packs you all into one little space together, to roll and flop around with each other in your little color coded T-shirts, so they know where to return you to ifyou should happen to get panicked when you can't get off your back, and you're just stuck there twitching and wrenching your lit­tle 'Domer' self until you finally just pass out from exhaustion. 
"You're not always so helpless though. During football season, you guys are maniacs. The offense is on the field and you're pretty quiet, normal fans, except for the frantic girly screams you hear every few minutes: 'Brady, I love you! Call me! Brady, you're soo hot!' 
"Hah, you think that's bad, then the defense gets on the field and you go nine levels of psychotic! Good little Catholic kids are transformed into beasts! 
"All you can hear is, 'Kill, kill, kill, kill! Rips his head off! Murder them!

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 



Leaders address 
dining hall issues 
By LIZ HARTER 
News Writer 
Executives addressed the din­ing hall's potentially premature closing time and theft possibili­ties at Monday's Board of Governance {BOG) meeting. 
For the second consecutive week; BOG revisited the prob­lematic issues of Dining Services putting away food before the dining hall's specified closing time at 7 p.m. and the lack of a secure storage area for students' backpacks. 
"The executive board [met] with Barry [Bowles], the direc­tor of Sodexho [and College Food Services]. He reinforced his previous statement that said that the doors [of the dining hall] will not close until 7 p.m.," student body president Susan Mcllduff said. 
Bowles reminded executives that anyone who does not make it to dinner before 7 p.m. always has the option of using a meal credit at the Dalloway's pasta bar open from 7:30 to 9 
p.m. Monday through Thursday, Mcllduff said. 
The executive board and Bowles also met to discuss stu­dents' ability to bring backpacks into the dining hall. 
"Last year Sodexho had to replace close to $24,000 in sil­verware, plates and other dish­es [due to theft]," Mcllduff said. 
If backpacks were allowed into the dining hall, this cost would most likely go up, she said. 
Theft was the primary reason BOG discussed the allowance of backpacks in the dining hall. 
As of last May, Bowles said, cameras were installed in the lobby that focused on the shelves where backpacks are stored. 
Saint Mary's Security, Sodexho and the Shaheen Bookstore would have access to those videos if a theft were to be reported, Mcllduff said. 
In other BOG News: 
+ This Thursday, the junior board will host the "Let Your Sister Pick Your Mister," dance from 8 to 11 p.m. in the Student ­Center. Tickets are $5 per per­son and the theme is retro, Junior Class president Colleen Kielty said. 
Campaigning for the first-year elections begins Thursday at noon. There are five tickets running for president and vice president, Elections commis­sioner Christin Molnar said.

Nevv professors advance bion1etrics 
Special to the Observer 
In the summer of 2001, Kevin W. Bowyer and Patrick J. Flynn joined Notre Dame's Computer Science and Engineering Department. 
Bowyer was hired from the University of South Florida to chair the department and Flynn came to Notre Dame from Ohio State. Acquainted with each other through previous research and professional collaborations, they planned to jointly pursue their research interests in the general area of computer vision. They secured funding from the National Science Foundation to establish their research laboratory within weeks of their arrival. While they initially envisioned future collabo­rations in the area of robot vision and medical image analysis, they also had plans to pursue joint work in biometrics.

phone calls late Monday after­noon asking for clarification. 
In addition, three students received "University citations for violation of University rules" and five people received no-trespass notices, Johnson said. 
Johnson did not explain which University rules were violated or why those students received University citations rather than police-issued arrest tickets. 
2001, focused and accelerated those plans and the result has been the emergence of a distinc­tive and prominent research pro­gram in biometrics 
A biometric is a stable and dis­tinctive physiological feature of a person that can be measured and used to identify them; such as a fingerprint. Bowyer and Flynn have been researching the feasibil­ity of image-based biometrics and multi-biometrics since 2001, including first-of-a-kind compar­isons of face photographs, face thermograms, 3-D face images, iris images, videos of human gait and even ear and hand shapes. 
"The thrust of our research is to evaluate the practicality, perform­ance and usefulness of these tech­nologies as a means of recognizing people," Bowyer said. 
Interest in biometrics technolo­gies and commercial efforts to cap­italize on that interest has grown 
Johnson did not specify what local police forces aided NDSP, how many officers were present, if they were plain­clothes or uniformed or-if pre­liminary breath tests (PBTs) were used. 
Last year, Indiana State Excise, South Bend and St. Joseph County police were present in addition to NDSP at home games. NDSP used a mix of plain-clothes and uni­formed officers, Johnson told The Observer last September, and administered PBTs "to help decide whether or not [people] need to be in custody for their safety." 
exponentially since 9-11. As a result, federal agencies examining the feasibility of these technologies are in need of teams that can define and execute "challenge problems" designed to assess bio­metric system performance on a level playing field to minimize bias­es. 
"Our group has established itself as an 'honest broker' in biometric system evaluations," Flynn said. "Our funding from the National Science Foundation and other agencies and companies supports both this evaluation work and our own basic research in advanced biometrics." 
In the five years since the 9-11 attacks, Bowyer and Flynn's research program has produced four master's theses, five doctoral dissertations, over 20 articles in peer-reviewed journals and approximately $3.5 million in research funding. 
"NDSP will continue to work with other area police offi­cials next weekend to help foster a family friendly envi­ronment in parking lots," Johnson said in the e-mail Monday. "Keep in mind that laws. regarding the use of alcohol will be enforced and you are responsible for your conduct. 
"Law enforcement officers will arrest underage drinkers on campus and at tailgate parties."

pus apartment or house is a transition from a safe environ­ment to a less secure one. He said students sometimes fail to realize this shift when they go off-campus. 
"This is one of the safest campuses in the country ... so we do have an unrealistic feel­ing of safety in this place that is not transferred outside of Notre Dame," Moss said. "We need to make people aware that when you live on West · LaSalle, it's not the same as living on campus." 
Breen-Phillips rector Rachel Kellogg said students tend to be clueless when it comes to staying safe off campus. 
"This sort of naivety, this 'everybody's nice here' thing, they just extend that to walk­ing home alone from Turtle Creek at [2 a.m.]," Kellogg said. 
Knott Hall rector Brother Jerome Meyer said the CLC should meet with Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) to dis­cuss ways to keep students secure. He warned against offending NDSP by telling them they are not doing a good job. 
Kellogg also said an attitude of respect is important when talking to both NDSP and the _ South Bend Police Department (SBPD). The CLC should not accuse the police forces of fail­ing to do their jobs, she said, but should present them with their concerns. 
Off-campus senator Mark Healy suggested the CLC work with NDSP and SBPD to encourage them to accept the fact that every weekend thou­sands of students will leave campus and enter South Bend. 
Faculty Senate representa­tive professor Kelly Jordan touched on police-student ten­sions raised by the recent raid at Turtle Creek Apartments. He said students need to com­promise as well and recognize that when they drink under­age, they are breaking the law. 
"The tone and tenor that I've seen in the South Bend Tribune and in The Observer is 'Why are the South Bend police targeting us as stu­dents?' But I haven't seen from the students 'Yes, we understand underage drinking is wrong,"' Jordan said. "I think that there's going to be a little give and take here that people have to be willing to exercise." 
Cordelli said the perception that all students who live off­campus are throwing huge parties is incorrect. She said the police should make keep­ing students safe a priority. 
Healy said the task force should encourage students to take a cab rather than walk home through South Bend at night. 
Members briefly discussed how to inform students about safety precautions or crime alerts. Judicial Council presi­dent Liz Kozlow said the task force should investigate cre­ative ways to disperse this information, since many stu­dents do not open the e-mail alerts. 
"The most important thing is to figure out how to access all students," Kozlow said. 
The task force plans to dis­cuss on-campus safety, espe­cially during football season when thousands of Notre Dame and opposing fans swarm to the campus. 
Some members of the coun­cil shared stories of Penn State fans invading dorm hallways and non-residents sleeping in dorm social spaces this past weekend. 
"Everyone's just so kind," said Welsh Family rector Candace Carson. "They let people in and they don't know who they are." 
In other CLC news: 
+Thre13 task forces and three task force chairs were unanimously approved. Smith will chair the Student Concerns task force, Student Body vice president Bill Andrichik will chair Conduct Awareness, and chief execu­tive officer Liz Brown will chair Student Voice and Input.

Latimer said cell phone carriers are capable of building a system powerful enough to handle the seven football Saturdays, but it would provide "over-coverage" for the other 358 days of the year. 
Verizon customer and freshman Nick LaSpina said he was not satis­fied with campus cell phone serv­ice. 
"My phone didn't work this weekend," he said. "I got zero bars, and it's not much better during tho week." 
Cingular's cell phone coverage improved at midnight last Friday, as the network went live with the initiation of its new stealth anten­nas on campu..'>.

Guillette said the cadets and midshipmen might face uncertainties in their future, but should remember to always set a good example and "show pride in being a leader and an officer." 
"Remember, only combat is a true test of performance," he said. "Be prepared for that moment." 
While serving in Korea, Guillette said he experienced his first true example of lead­
ing his original estimation of an October completion. 
To maximize coverage, Cingular positioned its new antennas at sites around campus, including DeBartolo I I all, Legends, Carroll Hall, Lewis Hall, the Hesburgh Library, the Joyce Center, the Bookstore and within the vicinity of Notre Dame Stadium. These anten­nas are exclusively used by cus­tomers on the Cingular network and were constructed and funded entirely by Cingular, Latimer said. 
Cingular customers reported that their service has improved since the antennas were activated and are pleased with the expandnd cov­erage, Latimnr said. He expects that the customers will especially notice the improvements this week without the extra on-campus use generated by fbotball fans.

Senior Tony Crafa said he has seen a notable improvement in Verizon's service. 
"In the past, I'd have to go out­side to make a call," he said. "Now I can call from my room. It's chop­py, but it works." 
There is still no firm timetable for the completion of the Verizon antenna system, Latimer said. He estimated completion between Oct. 7 and Oct. 21 -the two-week span between the Stanford and UCLA home football games. However, Verizon told the University there is a possibility that the towers may not be completed until after football season, Latimer said. 
Latimer said the University is not responsible for poor reception, since only the cell phone providers can increase their signal strength.

Rice leaves time for Iran to bargain 
HALIFAX, Nova Scotia-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice left the door open Monday for consideration of what may be a new overture from Iran to bargain with the West over the Iranians' disputed nuclear program. 
Still, she predicted U.N. sanctions would fol­low "if this does not work out." 
Iran has told European diplomats it may be willing to shelve its uranium enrichment pro­gram temporarily, perhaps for two months, during negotiations with the United States and other world powers over the future and scope of a nuclear program that Iran insists is peaceful. The Bush administration accuses Iran of hiding ambitions to build nuclear weapons. 
Rice said Iran has not put a formal offer on the table, but she did not reject the idea of beginning talks framed by a deadline. 
Pope Benedict visits birthplace 
MARKTL AM INN, Germany -Pope Benedict XVI spent a sentimental day in his Bavarian homecoming Monday, visiting the town where he was born, the church where he was baptized and his favorite pilgrimage site. 
He was also reunited with his 82-year-old brother, Georg, a retired priest and choir diwctor who prayed with Benedict before the font where he was baptized in tiny Marktl am Inn. 
Georg was waiting inside St. Oswald's Church when Benedict's motorcade rolled up for a brief, upbeat visit. The pope first waded into the enthusiastic crowd outside, shaking hands and blessing babies. 
After three or four minutes in the church with Georg, the pope came out and rode in his popemobile about 30 yards to the house where he was born.

SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -New charges were filed against a pastor on Monday amid the expansion of an investigation into allegations that leaders of two reclusive church communes sexually abused girls. 
George Otis Johnston, 63, was charged with nine counts of felony statutory sodomy on suspi­cion of molesting a girl from 1997 to 2004, start­ing when she was less than 12 years old. 
Johnston's lawyer, who previously has declined to talk to reporters, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment Monday. Johnston has pleaded not guilty to nine other charges of molesting a girl from his church from the time she was 8 years old until she was 16.

Of the 2007 budget request, about $8.5 million is expected to come from property taxes. 
Bush marks Sept. 11 anniversary 
President honors memory of nearly 3,000, calls war a 'struggle for civilization' 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON­President Bush, five years after the Sept. 11 attacks, said Monday the war against terror "is a strug­gle for civilization." He said defeat would surrender the Middle East to radical dic­tators with nuclear weapons. 
"We are fighting to main­tain the way of life enjoyed by free nations," Bush said in remarks prepared for a prime-time address from the Oval Office. Two months before November elections, the president attempted to spell out in graphic terms the stakes he sees in the unpopular war in Iraq and the broad­er war on terror. 
The address was coming at the end of a day in which Bush honored the memory of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks that rocked his presidency and thrust the United States into a costly and unfinished war against terror. 
"Our nation has endured trials, and we face a diffi­cult road ahead," he said. 

Before his address, Bush visited New York, Shanksville, Pa., and the Pentagon to pay respect to the victims of the attacks and show resolve in the struggle against Islamic Congress has approved will set the course for this with democratic leaders militants. $432 billion for Iraq and new century and deter­and reformers, offering a

IN BRIEF 
OPEC agrees to keep volume steady 

VIENNA, Austria -A wary OPEC said Monday it will keep pumping crude at current levels, while also making clear it would consider scaling back production ifoil prices keep plummeting. 
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -anxious to keep prices already at five-month lows from a free fall -pledged to "vigilantly monitor" the combination of rising inventories and easing political tensions that have pushPd crude down by almost $13 a barrel since midsummer. 
OPEC's output quota will remain at 28 million barrels a day, the 11-nation group said, acknowl­edging that supplies are "more than adequate" to satisfy world demand. Including Iraq, which is not bound by the quota system, OPEC" daily pro­duction is roughly 30 million barrels. 
But the group, which produces about 40 per­cent of the world's crude, is keeping its options open in case prices don't stabilize. OPEC President Edmund Daukoru, who is also Nigeria's oil minister, said he would consult with other members "should market conditions warrant" action before they meet again in December. 
Herley scandal shows need for expert 
NEW YORK -When Herley Industries Inc. released 'its proxy report earlier this year, it said that having no "financial experts" on its board's three-person audit committee was in the "best interest" of the company. Try telling that now to the defense contractor's battered shareholders. 
In recent months, the Lancaster, Pa.-based com­pany and its former chairman were indicted for fraud, its outside auditors quit and its stock slumped 30 percent. 
It sure sounds like those experts could have been a big help -possibly to avoid this mess in the first place, and certainly to aid the company in cleaning it up. 
The irony in all this was pointed out by account­ing expert Jack Ciesielski, who noted in a recent blog that "there's a reason why a financial expert b0longs on audit committees, and Herley has pro­vided an excellent example." 
It seems amazing that five years after the implo­sion of Enron set off a wave of accounting scan­dals across corporate America that some compa­nies still don't understand the importance _ and necessity -of packing their board with top-notch expertise. 

Congress wades into HP probe 
Hewlett-Packard Co. must turn over records related to possibly illegal investigations 
Associated Press 
SAN JOSE, Calif. -A 
Congressional committee on 
Monday asked Hewlett­
Packard Co. to turn over 
records related to the com­

"Old Glory lost today," said Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist lR-Tenn.) when the Senate rejected, for the fourth time, the Flag Desecration Amendment. The vote, 66-34, fell one short of the two­thirds needed to send it to the states for approval. 
The amendment states: "The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical dese­cration of the flag of the United States." Contrary to Frist, this amendment is an election-year scam. It could be Exhibit A on "Bow Not to Mess with the Constitution." 
The amendment was a response to Supreme Court decisions in Texas v. Johnson (1989) and U.S. v. Eichmq.nn (1990). In Johnson, the Court denied that "a State may foster its own view of the flag by prohibiting expressive conduct relating to it." In Eichmann, the Court struck down, on free speech grounds, a federal statute punishing flag desecration. Neither case prevents punishment of a breach of the peace involving flag desecra­tion. 
Both cases are dubious in their interpretation of the freedom of speech. The invalidation in Johnson of the flag laws of 48 states also illus­trates the rigidity created by the incorporation doctrine, the misinter­pretation of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of "due process of law" so as to bind every state and local government strictly and uniformly by the Court's inter­pretations of.the Bill of Rights. 
The amendment, however, is an imprudent response. It affirms the 

Charles Rice 
Right or Wrong? 
power of Congress only and with­draws from the states any power to 
protect the flag as a symbol of national unity. It concedes that Johnson and Eichmann have the same status, as "the supreme law of the land," as does the language of the Constitution itself. It was not until 1958, in Co.oper v. Aaron, that the Court first claimed that its rulings were the supreme law of the land. Cooper held that state officials were bound by those rulings. There is no comparable holding that Court inter­pretations of the Constitution are binding in every respect on the Congress and the Executive Branch of the federal government. The Court's rulings, of course, bind the parties to the case. Those rulings and, to some extent, the Court's opinions, are precedents for future cases in the Supreme Court and other courts. The judiciary, however, is only one of the three branches. The other two branches have a duty to interpret and apply the Constitution as it relates to 
their own actions. The amendment accepts the idea that a Supreme Court decision is on the same level as the Constitution itself, so that the only way to undo it is another amend­
ment. The amend.ment is also unclear as to whether it would give Congress power to criminalize a person's "physical desecration," in his home, of a flag he owns. 
The amendment disregards an alternate remedy provided in the Constitution itself. Congress has power to control the entire jurisdic­tion of the lower federal courts and the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Article III, Section 2 provides that the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction "with such exceptions, and under such regula­tions as the Congress shall make." Legal scholars debate it. But the 1869

case of Ex Parte McCardle, and other precedents and statements in later Supr~me Court opinions, indicate that Article III, Secti.on 2, means what it says. "As respects our appellate juris­diction," said Justice William 0. Douglas in 1968, "Congress may largely fashion it as Congress desires by reason of the express provisions of Section 2, Article III." If a federal statute were enacted depriving the lower federal courts and the Supreme Court of jurisdiction in cases involv­ing federal and state flag desecration statutes, the state courts could rule on such cases without fear of being overruled by the Supreme Court. 
A statute withdrawing Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction in flag cases would affirm that the constitu­tional checks and balances work. It would not overrule Texas v. Johnson or U.S. v. Eichmann. .It would not change the Constitution, as would an amendment. The jurisdiction of the Court could be restored whenever Congress so chose.. 
The State is not God, and the flag is not an object of religious veneration. But, Congress and the states ought to be held to have a sufficient interest to protect the flag, as the unique nation­al symbol, from public and contemp­tuous physical desecration even when that act is intended as political expression. The amendment, howev­er, is phony electoral posturing that would deny the rightful power of the states and ignore the remedy provid­ed by Article III, Section 2.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Where were you at? 
"Where are you at in the photo?" I asked the gentleman standing next to me as we both gazed into the new picture of the mass on South Quad five years ago, which now hangs in Coleman-Morse. It turns out my fellow reflector was also a fresh­man at the time, and even resided in the neighbor dorm to my beloved Dillon Hall. It turns out he and his "Big Dog" frosh section weren't but a whisper away from my roommate and I that awful day. 
Realizing the uncanny nature of our introduction, we did the methodical exchange of where we each "were at" during those ini­tial frightening moments Tuesday morning. During that day, rumors and unconfirmed reports ran rampant of death tolls in the hun­dreds of thousands. There was speculation of attacks in Los Angeles, attacks on Capitol Hill, imminent attacks on the Sears Tower -there was even a rumor going around of how Our Lady's University was a target. Those first few hours were a time of unfathomable fear. 
Nonetheless, in that hour of despair, our dorm came together as we prayed for the safety of one of our dormmate's older brother, who was trapped in one of the towers. It was during that abyss, that God's awesome grace-in the truest sense of the term ­revealed itself in a shower of unity, compassion and purpose during the South Quad Mass. Even in the midst of such tragedy, I attest there was not a finer hour of providence during my four-year blip at Notre Dame. 
Since that finest hour, my adult years have been marked by mili­tary intervention designed to keep our great nation safe and secure: our soldiers have certainly fought a just cause with valor and honor. Yet five years after Sept. 11, I am now convinced the "root cause of terror" (as the politicians in my city like to say) will never be eliminated until an overall strate­gy that includes the Church is developed by our country's lead­ers. 
In the 1980s, Pope· John Paul II, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan worked together to imple­ment such a strategy to chip away the strength of Soviet communism in Eastern Europe. The growth of the Church's influence within the civil society of the satellite states proved instrumental in countering the iron grip of radical commu­nism, thus enabling the internal reformations of 1987. 
Although certainly not wholly parallel, radical Islam will not be destroyed by bullets, missiles and predators alone: rather, the tree of jihad must be cut down, bit by bit, by spreading the compassion, love and justice of Christ through­out the world. The same love that compelled the Notre Dame family to come together on the quad that tragic day will also be needed to ensure Sept. 11 goes the same way of Pearl Harbor -never for­gotten, but now belonging in his­tory books, documentaries and photographs. 
Otherwise, if we lose sight of what must be done to eliminate the seeds of jihad, we as the Church, Americans and Domers will be forced to live under the shroud of fear the rest of our lives. Fortunately, with Notre Dame's example of unity that day, America has a template of what must be done to prevail. Fifty years from now, when we show our grandchildren around campus following an Irish victory, they will surely ask, "Where were you at that day?" As long as we remain united as Christians over these next years, we will be able to hold our heads up high and answer them where we stood.

Grad students not cheering 
The only thing worse than someone in the student section cheering for the opposing team is someone in the student section not cheering at all. Unfortunately, to my surprise, I found a lot of both in the graduate student section during last weekend's game. Don't get me wrong, graduate students can be as passionate, as loud and as energetic as any fan. But, for every one graduate student I saw cheering in the stadium last weekend, I could find two or more that were stone­cold silent. 
I know it's different being a graduate student, but it doesn't mean we have any less reason to cheer. In fact, most grad students (who aren't in the law or MBA program) have full ride scholarships along with a four-to five-figure salary paid for by Notre Dame. Isn't gratitude reason enough to cheer during the game? How hard can it be to make some noise or rat­tle your keys? J:Iow hard is it to go along with a cheer as simple as "We are NO?" 
This is the year that every Irish fan has to not only be seen but also be heard in the stadium. Graduate student or not, if all you can bring is your silent support, please consider showing your .support at home in front of the TV instead.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Pride in Notre Dame 
I was very impressed with the students, facuity, staff and alumni for showing the true spirit of the University as they rose to the occasion to treat Penn State guests with the utmost respect at the football game this past weekend. I would like to start by say­ing that I have always been impressed by the man­ner in which Notre Dame students, faculty and staff conduct themselves toward me, a transplant profes­sor who went to Purdue for my undergr.aduate degree. They are always very polite and respectful. But in the events surrounding major sporting events at other universities I have· seen all too many times where a rivalry evokes poor, unsportsmanlike behavior. This is my second year here at Notre Dame, and this weekend my husband's family, who are Penn State alumni, came to Notre Dame for the game. They enjoyed their visit very much and were treated impeccably by all the people that they encountered. 
It started with our walk to campus, during which a parking attendant welcomed them and gave them a campus map to help them get around campus more easily. It continued with two Notre Dame alumni stopping them to say hello outside the stadi­um, asking them where they were from and wishing them a good visit. Then a random man walking across campus said, "Good luck today." There was not even a hint of sarcasm. Finally, upon entering the stadium, the person collecting tickets greeted them with a "Welcome to Notre Dame." I enjoyed the outcome of the game very much, as I was the only person in my family cheering for Notre Dame that day, but I will say that I felt an incredible sense of pride in the manner in which the Notre Dame family treated their visitors. While I am a very proud Purdue alumnae, I am sorry to say that when I have brought guests with me to my alma mater, although they have not been treated badly, they have never been treated this well either.

The rural network of gossip and fear leaked the imaginary gas shortage to my mother, and she headed off to fill up her truck and grab supplies. 
Ten minutes after she left, my brother came into my bedroom and interrupted my news coma to tell me that a frantic neighbor had parked his truck in the middle of the street in front of our house. He had run over one of the pride of cats that lived in our front yard. 
I strolled to the mailbox, looked down and sighed. It was my moth­er's favorite cat-a cement-colored, spooky, warm fur ball we called Phantom. It used to walk the railing of the chain link fence and rub up against my mother while she pruned the trees in our front yard. 
"Lee, where's the shovel? We have to take care of this before Mom gets home." My brother went back inside. 
Our neighbor, a part-time para­medic, stood guilty in the middle of the street, trying to reconcile himself with reality. 
"Aren't you going to do anything 'to save it?" he asked. 
I looked the cat in the eye. It was still alive, though its back end was ground into the pavement. It was still friendly -confused, scared, dying, but as warm as ever. 
"What can I do?" I asked, and walked to the garage to get the shovel and a sack. 
When my mother got home, she did not care. The cat was in the woods behind our house and out of mind. 
The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau thought man was at his best, his most peaceful, when he was in a state of nature. That is, when we are most ignorant, we are most happy. A half-read copy of "The 9/11 Commission Report" sits on my bookshelf. Half-read mostly out of laziness, but out of ignorance, too. 
Five years after having our hearts shot out on national television, we are trying to reclaim that blissful naivete, the inconsequential selfish­ness of Americana this generation had before Sept. 11, 2001. The trash TV headlines, the preoccupation with celebrities still grasps rele­vance despite a half-decade of blockbuster tragedies that have made us numb to pain and the body count. 

We are socially depressed and picking new battles to push the hurt and noise to the side -and letting it fester away. While we look back, we do so through broken glasses to cast new blame or to exploit the hurt to a point we cannot feel it anymore. Collector's coins, overwrought movies, books attacking widows ­it's all the same. 
I have stood quiet, respectful at the place in New York City where there once stood the Twin Towers and wondered what they looked like. I have puttered around where hun­dreds died in the Pentagon, now a chapel with walls glossed up with holographs like the covers of comic books I bought when I was a kid. I have lost a friend in a deprecating war somehow intertwined in the death and horror of that day. 
Five years and a thousand miles away, I still have not taken it all in. I do not yet understand why the world had to change, just that it did. I wonder when that will make us smarter, make us better. 
This is our watershed. I hope we have not wasted it away.

DVD REVIEW 

Schneider scores a winner 
Now that football season has officially begun in both the col­lege and professional realms, it is the time of year where tele­visions should either be tuned in to pro­grams .such as "Lost" or else some form of footbalL As I watched various games over the week­end includ­ing the Ohio State-Texas con­test and the Bears' thrashing of the Green Bay Packers, several questions about sports televi­sion broadcasting came into my head. · 
During the stellar game between the Buckeyes and Longhorns, announcers made it very clear that viewers were watching "ESPN on ABC." This makes it seem like the moniker of cable network ESPN has become so popular that it now overshadows that of a broad­cast channel which is techni­cally its parent. 
Bear in mind that ABC invented the "Wide World of Sports" program, was a pio­neer in the sports broadcast industry and has brought us legendary sports anchors like Brent Musberger and Keith Jackson. In spite of these achievements, the ESPN brand has now permanently taken over ABC Sports and does not appear to want to relinquish its hold any time soon. 
This led me to wonder what might come next. With such an emphasis on corporate synergy and cross promotion, we could soon see program titles such as "Major League Baseball, brought to you by The Best Damn Sports Show Period on FOX." Or perhaps "Comcast Sports Net on NBC's presenta­tion of NASCAR" will be com­ing soon to a television near you. 
How far could cross promo­tion like this go without com­pletely inundating us with cor­porate media conglomerates? Hopefully, ESPN on ABC will be as far as television executives spread the cross pollination of

sports television. 
Another recurring problem with sports television is the annual re-tooling of logos, stats and information bars and ani­mations. With the exception of ESPN, each new sports season brings a new version of infor­mation bars on every network that try to flood your television with more stats, sound effects and advertisements, all while trying to be overly hip or cool. These increasingly complex graphics end up looking ridicu­lous and push aside the more vital information to emphasize the newest technological breakthroughs. 
The tendency of the new graphics to somehow end up looking worse and worse each year causes viewers to spend more time getting used to reading them than watching the game itself. Meanwhile, somewhere a television execu­tive is receiving a hefty bonus check for contributing his new graphics idea to the yearly pre­production meeting. 
Instead of wasting time and money on such shenanigans, a novel idea would be to spend said money, which could poten­tially be a big sum, on ensuring that every sports broadcast is in high-definition. Any extra money could go toward hiring quality sports anchors and analysts instead of B-list sports stars who have no clue what they're talking about. 
While both of these disap­pointing problems are easily remedied and done away with, somehow this will not end up happening in either case. The sports broadcasting world is one of perpetual change, and network executives seemingly feel no need to be shackled by the structures of tradition or "doing what works." 
Each passing year will con­tinue to bring ever more com­plicated graphics and more prolific instances of cross pro­motion in broadcasting. Now excuse me, I have to go try to understand the graphics on "ABC's Monday Night Football on ESPN, brought to you by GMC Trucks."

By ANALISE LIPARI Assistant Scene Editor 
Rob Schneider is a man on a mission. 
Given the prospect of either remaining Adam Sandler's side­kick for cinematic eternity, or finding leading roles, Schneider chose to boldly head into the revolutionary genre of ... dumb comedies. 
Despite his seemingly limited talents, calling to mind such classics as "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo," Schneider has, to his credit, filund in "The Benchwarmers" a simple, straightforward comedic style in his own vein. While the film may not headline at Sundance any­time soon, it proves to be what it expects of itself: a stupidly Iunny way to spend an hour and a half. 
The film opens with close friends Gus Matthews (Schneider). Richie Goodman (David Spade) and Clark Reedy (Jon Heder) finding themselves on· a local baseball diamond, defending the honor of a young, nerdy boy who needs their help again.'lt the evil legion of popular little League players. Gus, a for­mer athlete, and his two com­panions -who are anything but -decide to take up the cause of nerds everywhere and challenge the bullies. 
Gus and crew manage to beat the athletes at their own game, due to Gus' impressive pitching skill and Hichie and Clark's abili­ty to stand in one place for nine innings. The trio decides to con7 tinue this winning streak, finding themselves in a tournament-of­sorts with local childrnn's base­ball teams, encotmtering Craig Kilborn, Tim Meadows and a hilarious Jon Lovitz along the way. 
Pandering to the alleged sensi-


bilities of its intended audience 
of adolescent males, the film's 
humor is anything but mature. 
Flatulence, racial stereotypes 
and science-fiction enthusiasts 
are played for laughs, with a 
mixed bag of results. 

Occasionally bordering on bril­liance, however, is the character of Howie (Nick Swardson), who is the highlight of the film's joke repertoire. Hichie's younger brother, Howie is a notorious . agoraphobe, and his battles with the sadistic rays of the sun are hysterically epic. The sheer out­rageousness of most of the film's humorous situations keeps it 
from being too om.msive. 

I Ieder, clearly playing off of his 
"Napoleon Dynamite" persona, 
characterizes Clark perfectly as 
the sweetly inept, stereotypical 
nerd. Spade in turn continues to 
expand the breadth .of his acting 
portfolio by playing a slightly 
geekier version of "Dicky 
Hobert<;: Former Child Star," but 
his deadpan delivery is a consis­
tently funny aspect of the film. 


Tacking on a message of acceptance and understanding each other's differences seems eliche and unnecessary, but "The Benchwarmers" deems it essen­tial and does it with gusto, its grand finale taking place in a baseball stadium full of athletes and nerds alike. While this is where the film takes its clumsi­est turn, Schneider's everyman personality keeps it from descending too far down the drain. 
Overall, "The Benchwarmers" is an unassuming and silly com­edy. 
The recently released DVD contains several special features of interest. Howie's funniest sequences are immortalized in "Who's On Deck," a short mon­tage of the film's funnier moments. The DVD also has sev­eral other featurettes, including "Mr. October," which includes baseball great Heggie Jackson. It also includes both a director's commentary and a more ridicu­lous commentary featuring Heder and Spade. 
With "The Benchwarmers," Schneider began the long process of moving beyond Deuce Bigalow and into legitimate comedic cinema. In the mean­time, enjoying the film and its DVD are fun ways to spend a lazy afternoon.

In seventh grade, my teacher read several of Shakespeare's sonnets and I have been hooked ever since, I respected his cre­ativity and marveled at his mas­tery of the English lan­guage. The way he wrote prose, puns and poems struck me as some­thing that I could never do with any­where near as much flair. His level of tal­ent was something I will never hope to touch. 
More often than not, I find myself in awe of Shakespeare's. talents. However, I didn't fully grasp the level to which Shakespeare's abilities rose. After seeing a performance of Titus Andronicus at The Globe, the house that Shakespeare built, I now see even more so the significance his writing and plays have on theater. 
In a dimly lit corner of The Globe Theater, I and a dozen or so of my classmates watched as the bloody tragedy "Titus Andronicus" unfolded before us. The actors roved through the crowd and engaged the audi­ence. The action seemed to attack at every angle: from high in the rafters, under the stage and in the audience itself. The opening scene included a parade through the crowd, complete with drums, horns and singing. 
For just a moment, it was very easy to become lost in the play, to see yourself in Ancient Rome. 
Suddenly it came to me -this was Shakespeare's goal, what he really set out to do. Shakespeare once said "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players." On some levels, this was simply a metaphor for Shakespeare's idea of reality. 

Chris McGrady 
Scene Writer 

But furthermore, this was true on the level that Shakespeare made the world his stage. He did not limit the action to the wooden planks set before the audience, but rather brought the audience into the play itself. By engaging us so forcefully, that we had to feel for the actors. It wasn't a request so must as a necessity. 
So deep was the level of reali­ty felt by the audience that ten or so viewers fainted during the bloodiest scenes of the produc­tion. 
This is just one example of the brilliant realism and drama that Shakespeare's work is capable of portraying. When was the last time you saw an audience so moved by a play that mem­bers were actually fainting and having to be carried out on wheelchairs? It was a new experience for me, and one I will never forget. 
Largely regarded as one of his lesser works, 'Titus Andronicus" was the proverbial straw that broke this camel's back. I finally can see how Shakespeare's work set the standard for contemporary drama. 
Until I could sit in the seats at The Globe and see the play the way Shakespeare truly meant for it to be seen, I never quite grasped the level to which Shakespeare elevated theater. 
I had never imagined his uncanny ability to relate to the audience. To have the audience gasping in horror one second, laughing the next and sitting in tense silence soon thereafter, is something that truly only the "master of written word" can do. 
The lights came up, the actors bowed. 
Zealous applause erupted. 
I sat silent, still in awe, but a different kind of awe altogether, because now I think I under­stand.

'Manning Bowl' blurs line between sport, spectacle 
Last night was a big night for the NFL, as it was the opening salvo for the 2006 football sea­son. 2006 is Eli's year, which I said in 2005 and also in 2004. But real 
tllis time. Eli will finally step out of the shadow of his older brother 


and bring  
the Giants  Brian Doxtader  
to that  
elusive  
football Promised  Scene Editor  
Land, the  
Super  
Bowl.  

Accordingly, the biggest game this week was the Giants-Colts game, in which the Colts pre­vailed 26 -21. But for anyone who watched the game last night, you know that you were not watching New York play Indianapolis. You were watching Eli Manning play Peyton Manning. The event was dubbed "The Manning Bowl" and had been hyped long before the sea­. son began, for weeks, even 
months. 
When the game finally arrived, it delivered, but not necessarily in the way most expected. The Manning Bowl was more than a game, it was brother vs. brother, while Eli and Peyton's parents looked on. It became a story, a movie, with a plot fueled by the networks. 
We tend to think of sports as non-narratives, but there has to be some kind of hook, some kind of human interest to keep the viewers from flipping the chan­nel. Pretty much every sporting event has some sort of appeal to an audience outside of the game itself. 
Think about the big sports events of the past year. The Rose Bowl was less about two teams than it was about Texas, the dis­respected underdog, taking on behemoth USC and prevailing. 
Little-known George Mason's Cinderella run to the Final Four was broadcast in the same vein The 2005 Superbowl was a mis­sion to win one for the Bus. 
All of these events have some­thing in common -they are, essentially, about the people involved rather than the game itself. 
ABC wanted people to tune into the 2006 Orange Bowl not necessarily to see Florida State play against Penn State (though it was a great contest in its O\J\P right), they wanted people to see Joe Paterno and Bobby Bowden, the two winningest coaches in Division I-A football, square off. 
The networks thus create "sto­rylines" that broaden the sport­ing event's appeal for a wider audience. It isn't enough that a game be just a game anymore. 
It has to be about an under­dog, about an overachiever, about someone overcoming the odds, about David vs. Goliath, etc. 
Sometimes a 

We're not always watching the game and we're not even always watching things that relate to the game. Instead, we're seeing things, events or perspectives that relate to the storyline or to the plot, right down to the last moments of the thrilling climax. 
For me, these things are always distracting. The whole .Manning Bowl spectacle, high­lighting two men out of dozens on the gridiron, seemed contrary to the idea that football is a team sport. 
Human-interest stories are all well and good, but not at the expense of the game itself. They call these things "sporting events," but at the point when the "event" overshadows the "sporting," there's a problem. 
I didn't tune into the game to see Archie Manning in every other shot. I didn't tune in to see repeated commercials of a 10­year-old Eli Manning. I tuned into the game because I'm a

The whole presentation reflects the "storyline" the net­work picked for that particular event in every facet. Things we might not necessarily always notice, like what the camera chooses to show us, have a pro­found effect on our viewing experience. 
As it was with January's Fiesta Bowl, when every other shot seemed to be of Laura Quinn, so too it was in the Manning Bowl, when every other shot seemed to be of Archie, the Mannings' father. The commercials, espe­cially the one that featured the Mannings as children, appealed to the same sort of sensibility. 
times. That 

touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress was the kind of tough, tight, confident throw Eli seemed to have trou­ble making last year. 
The end of the game was thrilling and controversial. In fact, aside from the fact that the Giants lost, it was a nearly per­fect sporting event. 
That is, of course, when it was about the sporting and not the event.

AP Receiver Deion Branch holds the Vince Lombardi trophy after the Partiots defeated the Eagles in Feb. 2005. New England traded Branch to Seattle for a first-round draft pick Monday. 
Branch ends holdout, heads for Seattle 
Associated Press 

KIRKLAND, Wash. ­The New England Patriots ended the holdout of receiver Deion Branch on Monday by trading him to the Seattle Seahawks for a first-round draft pick. 
Seahawks general man­
. ager Tim Ruskell called Branch "a known com­modity," and added that a first-round pick "can be a crapshoot." Seattle expects to final· ize a new, multiyear con­tract with the MVP from the Super Bowl in 2000 in the next few days. "It's tremendous. I think he's a fine football player and a tremendous young 
man. You can't have too many of those guys," Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren said. 
Seattle now has four proven, NFL starting receivers for Pro Bowl quarterback Matt Hasselbeck and an offense that was sluggish in a 9-6 win in Detroit in its open­er on Sunday. 
"Our quarterback, he's in his prime of his career," Ruskell said. "We want to give him all the tools to work with. 
And, as Holmgren was quick to point out, "We still have the MVP of foot­ball on our team," 2005 league rushing leader Shaun Alexander. 

"We still have to figure out how to get all the peo­p!e on the field," a smiling Holmgren said. "That's the chess game for our coaches right now." 
Branch was entering the last season of the five· year contract he signed as a rookie. He held out of the mandatory minicamp in June and all of training camp. He has been sub­ject to a $14,000 fine for each day he held out from July 28, the start of train· ing camp. 
"It's been a long process," Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. "I think we tried hard to make it work out. I think Deion tried hard. We tried. It didn't work out and we've moved on." 
Branch was eligible for arbitration after this sea· son, but Belichick said the prospect of a potentially contentious arbitration process was not "that big a factor" in the Patriots' decision to trade Branch. 
In the 2005 Super Bowl, Branch had 11 catches for 13 3 yards against Philadelphia, helping the Patriots win their third championship in four years. Last season, he caught 78 passes for 998 yards and five touch­downs, all career highs. In four seasons, he has 213 receptions. for 2,744 yards and 14 touchdowns. 
IN BRIEF 

Juventus struagles in 
Italy's Bleague pray RIMINI, Italy -Talk about a change of scenery. 
Just more than two months ago, Alessandro Del Piero, Gianluigi ButTon and Mauro Camoranesi lifted the World Cup trophy before a packed sta· dium, with hundreds of millions watching around the world. 
They are a long, long way from that now. 
The three players for Italy's world champions belong to Juventus, the demoted powerhouse now facing provincial teams in backwater stadi­ums with fading paint. 
What's more, Juventus is not even winning. 
The one-time power, playing its first game in Italy's second division, was held to a 1·1 tie Saturday by a Rimini team reduced to 10 men. The result against a team that finished 17th in Serie B last season was a troubling omen for Juventus, which is trying to return to the top division after being banished for its involvement in Italy's game-fixing scandal. 
Hype surrounding Colts 
firsl game dies down 
INDIANAPOLIS -Now that the Manning Bowl is history, the Indianapolis Colts can finally start their "regular" season. 
As players and coaches quietly filed into the team's complex Monday, ma"ny including the usually unflappable Tony Dungy confirmed what most outsiders suspected: The hype leading up to Sunday's game was a distraction. 
This week, it's back to basics. 
''I'm doubtful that if it had been the '58 championship game,· it could have lived up to the hype it had," Dungy said. "But I'm proud of the team, I'm glad we got the win and I'm glad it's over." 
Several players echoed Dungy's sentiments Monday. 

Hornish caP.tures third IRL 
championsliip title JOLIET, ill. -Sam Hornish Jr. heard the question and smiled. 
He won the Indianapolis 500 for the first time in May, and wrapped up his third IRL series championship on Sunday. 
What's left to accomplish on the cir· cuit? 
"''m still three 500s behind Rick Mears, A.J. Foyt, Big AI (Unser)," Hornish said laughing. ''I've got a little bit more to do there." 
While Dan Wheldon beat Target Chip Ganassi teammate Scott Dixon by 0.1897 seconds tO> win the PEAK Antifreeze Indy 300 at Chicagoland Speedway, Hornish finished third, 0.2323 seconds behind. That gave him the championship, which was also Marlboro Team Penske owner Roger Penske's first in the IRL. 
"There's no question Sam proved to everyone in the racing community ... that he was a great driver," Penske said.

TENNIS 
Federer still unstoppable 
No. 1 tennis player meets with, compared to, Woods at Open 
Associated Press NEW YORK-Two sets. In the end, on paper, that's all that separated Roger Federer from a true Grand Slam this year. Two sets. And as he lived it up into the wee hours of Monday with his inner circle at a bistro in Manhattan's trendy Meatpacking District, celebrat­ing the U.S. Open title that gave him three major championships in 2006, Federer took a moment to ponder what could have been. "It hit me last night, you know, when I actually realized that I've been in all major finals in the same year: I was so close to winning a Grand Slam," Federer said Monday during a 20­minute interview with a small group of reporters at a Midtown hotel. "But I'm very happy with three, of course." As well he should be. Federer went 27-1 at tennis' four premier tournaments, win­ning the Australian Open and Wimbledon before his triumph at Flushing Meadows. The lone blemish? A four-set loss to No. 2 Rafael Nadal in the French Open final. Remarkable as his year was, it's worth considering that if Federer had won three sets instead of one on that 90-degree day in June, he would have become the flrst man since Rod Laver in 1969 to complete a cal­endar-year Grand Slam. "I knew that I had an opportu­nity. But it's so far-fetched that you don't want to put yourself under pressure. I'm never going to say openly, 'I'm going to go for the Grand Slam.' Because you have to first win the Australian Open, and then see what happens at the French," Federer said. "Before having won those two, no point in talk­ing about it." He has yet to conquer Roland Garros. But, still only 25, he's won Wimbledon the past four years, the U.S. Open the past three, and the Australian Open twice for a total of nine majors -five shy of Pete Sampras' record. It's a pursuit that merits as close attention as Tiger Woods' chase of Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 golf Grand Slam titles. Woods owns 12, although unlike Federer, he can boast of a career Grand Slam. Woods has done something else Federer hasn't: win four majors in a row. He did it from the 2000 U.S Open in June through the 2001 Masters in April. And Woods, too, knows what it's like to fall a tad short of a true Grand Slam: In 2005, he won two majors and fmished a total of four shots out in the other two. The two superstars met Sunday, chatting before and sharing champagne after Federer beat And)' Roddick 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 in the U.S. Open final. Woods and Federer began text-messaging a few months ago, but their schedules never allowed for a face-to-face con­versation. "I arrived in the States and everybody was again talking about us," Federer said Monday,

Chester Taylor, the Vikings' free agent signing from Baltimore, rushed 31 times for 88 yards and a touchdown, upstaging Clinton Portis' sur­prise return for Washington. Portis, who spent the week downplaying his chances for the game because of a shoul­der injury, entered the game late during the Redskins' first drive and finished with 39 yards on 10 carries. 
The loss subdued a Washington crowd that turned the stadium into a sea of flut­tering red, white and blue as they waved American flags to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Childress  has  vowed  to  

change the culture of a Vikings team that was belittled follow­ing last year's infamous "Love Boat" party involving several players. He made a statement before the game by deactivat­ing safety Dwight Smith, who was cited for indecent conduct two weeks ago. 
But the Vikings often looked like a team adjusting to a new system. Their mistakes includ­ed a mishandled extra point, several drops and untimely penalties, including a rough­ing-the-passer call on third down that kept a Redskins drive alive. 
Still, they were able to beat a Redskins team that unveiled a new offense designed by assis­tant coach Al Saunders. Saunders' arrival meant Gibbs wasn't calling plays for the first time in his head coaching career, and the attack relied heavily on laterals and screens, making for some odd stats. At halftime, a receiver, Santana Moss, led the team in rushing, while a running back, Ladell Betts, led the team in receptions. Receiver Antwaan Randle Ellined up in the back­field several times. 
The Vikings took the opening kickoff and marched 80 yards in 10 plays, converting on third-and-9 and third-and-7 and scoring on third-and-goal from 4. A 46-yard pass to Williamson set up Taylor's touchdown run three plays later, but the extra point was botched when holder Chris Kluwe fumbled the ball and was tackled attempting to run toward the end zone. 
Portis, recovering from a left shoulder that was partially dislocated on Aug. 13, played as a backup for the first time since Sept. 30, 2002, the fourth game of his rookie year with Denver. He took hits on the shoulder and kept on going, scoring the Redskins' only touchdown on a 5-yard pitch-sweep that put Washington ahead 10-6 in the second quarter.

"It was frustrating not to be able to be there and help them out," she said. "It's not only not playing-when you're hurt you feel you're not part of the team because you're out rehabbing and not at practice. And that hurt because I love this team." 
When she finally returned, it took five games for Krivacek to crack the starting lineup -just in time for a defensive MVP performance in the Big East tournament -as the Irish rolled off 12 straight wins before Krivacek's conditioning and Rapinoe caught up with her. 
Krivacck's hard work this off­season to prepare for another battle with Portland's sopho­more midfielder is typical of a · work ethic that has sparked her continuous improvement, according to her coach. 
"She's one of those players I can genuinely look back on her four-year career and say she got better every year," Waldrum said. "She's four years better, not just four years older." 
No one appreciates that improvement more than senior captain defender Kim Lorenzen, who has played behind Krivacek year-round since 2003, winning national champi­onships together in NCAA play for Notre Dame as well as in the summer Olympic Developmental Program as members of the Illinois ODP team. 
"She's gotten so much better and grounded this team," Lorenzen said. "She's really made a position for herself in the center mid and made a role where she's going to be really hard to replace." 
She is also expected to lead a team vying for its second national title in three years. 
"She's not a real vocal leader on the field," Waldrum said. "But she's very charismatic with the team. The team gravitates toward her. On and off the field, she's in the center of everything that going on." 
As a player, that role now seems limitless. Considering Waldrum's dissatisfaction with the defense thus far, could she even slip back to protect the net with Lorenzen? 
"She's certainly so key for us for all we do in the midfield, I'd hate to do that," Waldrum said. "Right now she's such an inte­gral part of making that flow for us in the midfield ... but there's no question she could do that for us if she needed to." 


Krivacek, .meanwhile, isn't interested in that idle specula­tion -or being pigeonholed as anything less than a complete midfielder. 
"I feel I'm strong defensively and helping out on the attack," she said. "Whether it's scoring or setting up other people I feel my game has grown. 
''I'm. a midfielder." Midfielder. No qualifications necessary. Not anymore.

on the team, and we spend a lot of time together," Quinn said. "He's a. veteran keeper, and he's been really helpful in teaching me a lot of things." 
·Keeping both keepers satisfied. is a challenge, and it helps to have a coach who can relate to what they're going through. During his 15-year playing career, Clark played goalkeeper in the Scottish Second Division, Scottish Premier League and North American Soccer League and was a member of three Scottish World Cup teams. 
"Being a keeper myself, I have an understanding of what it's like to be both the starter and the backup," Clark said. "As the back­up, you want to be supportive, but you also want to compete. It's a fine line." 

Determining which, if either, of the two keepers will start and who will come off the bench may be the biggest challenge of all. Including preseason games, Cahill has posted a record of 3-1-0, while the team stands at 2-1-1 with Quinn in goal. Quinn, with his 0.7 5 goals against average holds an edge over Cahill, who has allowed 1.25 goals a game. 
"Both Chris and I are capable of doing what we need to do in goal," Quinn said. "The team's comfortable with whoever's back there, and that's the bottom line." 
If history is any indication, Clark won't hesitate to maintain the rotation throughout the season. Back in 1990, when he was head coach at Dartmouth, Clark used a two-man keeper rotation to help the Big Green win the Ivy League title and advance all the way to the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament. 
"These types of decisions are often made for you," Clark said. "At Dartmouth, we planned on choosing one keeper, but we did­n't because they both merited 

· playing time. We'll make a deci­sion if and when the time comes, but if the decision was clear, it would have already been made."

allowed fewer goals than the team had games, finishing the year with a .95 goals against average. 
"Laura has definitely been a mainstay in the back for the past three seasons," Belles coach Caryn Mackenzie said. 
Mackenzie took the Saint Mary's job at the start of Heline's sophomore year and has never coached a game without the sturdy keeper in net. 
Prior to coming to Saint Mary's, Mackenzie coached at Riley High School in South Bend -the same school Heline attended. Although she never played under Mackenzie, the pair knew of one another and developed a good relationship almost immediately. 
Heline's work ethic and her dedication make it easy for any coach to enjoy having her on their team. The senior routinely stays after practice for extra shots and works especially hard on days before the team has a big game. 
"[Heline] is a good example for the underclassmen as well as the upperclassmen on the team," fel­low senior goalkeeper Nicole Leach said. 
That reputation is why Heline was named one of the team's three captains for her seclor sea­son. She has always been· a gifted athlete, but Mackenzie feels the real growth of her goalie has come in her leadership skills. 
"She has always been confi­dent, but not always enough to make her presence known to her teammates," Mackenzie said. "She has really embraced the role this year." 
Though it is never easy to sit behind the starter for four years, Leach said the competition between her and Heline was good for the team. 
"I think over the last four years Laura and I have helped each other improve," Leach said. 
"When we push each other at training I think it shows in the game." 
Heline · has also become increasingly more comfortable with her feet since arriving at Saint Mary's. Her aggressive style of play is very helpful to the Belles zone defense, and Mackenzie considers her an extra defender in the backfield. 
Heline is one of the few veter­ans on this year's club and will need to continue to help Saint Mary's improve this season. 
The Belles dropped their open­er 2-0 to Albion College last Wednesday. They will look to get back on top against Manchester before the North Central College tournament this weekend.

Lloyd Carr believes in his Michigan squad, but he's not naive. 
The Wolverines ran for 252 yards in Saturday's 41-17 home win over Central Michigan. That said, a productive ground game against Mid-American Conference (MAC) foe Central Michigan only tells him so much.
