At Last 
Godot will stop by the cam­pus of St. Mary's Sun. at 2:30 in O'Laughlin Auditorium. Written at first in French by the Irish­man Samuel Beckett, the English version of En Attendant Godot was first staged in the United States in 1956 when half a Miami audience left after the first act.

Reagan Forces Muster Little Support 

By P.J. SCHROEDER 
Tom Frericks, campus Camp­aign Manager for Ronald Reagan at the Mock Political Convention, said today that he believes the 
conservative viewpoint has been drowned out at Notre Dame by the liberal and pro-leftist ele­ments among the student body and the administration. 
"We've heard a lot about in­tellectual objectivity and acade­mic freedom around here; and I guess that's very true if you hap-

Watch ''The Students'' 
The Student Senate heard 
plans for a student television 
show Monday night from Holy 
Cross Hall junior Jim Geagan, a 
member of the show's editorial 
board. He said that the show is 
"evolving into a reality" and 
that WNDU is "enthusiastic" a­
bout it. 
There were two reasons given 
as a rationale for the show. The 
first is that the student popula­
tion is an important part of 
society and needs a mass com­

1munication outlet. The second is that students often receive a bad press, and there is a need to show the best as ects of student power. 
The format of the show will be panel discussion similar to WNDU's "The Professors." The panelists will consist of students chosen after application and in­terview, possibly some faculty members, and a student moder­ator from the editorial bo<~rd. 
The show has scheduled a pilot this April, and this will probably be a one hour show

pen to be a liberal." Frericks made this comment with regard to what he felt was the Student 
Union  Academic  Commission's  
failure  to  present the full spec­ 
trum  of  political  opinion  in  

speakers. "There has not been one responsible conservative speaker that I know of who has spoken on campus yet this year." Frericks said that school is being "sold out" by the administra­
tion when they accept grants from the "Liberalist and pro­Left" Ford Foundation which 
"has definitely made its influ­
ence felt on this campus." 
When asked to comment on the progress of the Reagan cam­paign, Frericks said that he was disappointed about two aspeots of the Mock Convention. "First, I have heard that certain delega­tions have been "stacked," and this appears to me to be true." Secondly, Frericks said that he felt the Scholastic and the Ob­server had failed to present ade­. quately the views of his candi­date "or even the Conservative 
war in Vietnam. To accept de­
ferments is, Rupert said, "let­
ting them put you where they 
want you." He also opposed 
flight to Canada because "people 
are making a nebulous choice. 
They are going to Canada in 
reaction to the draft, not because 
Canada is where they want to 
be." On the other hand, he said, 
non-cooperation is "a positive 
affirmation of belief in peace 
and brotherhood," even though 
imprisonment may result. 
The second speaker was Rick 
Boardman, a member of CADRE 
who plans to refuse his Army in­
duction scheduled for March 28 
and expects to be imprisoned as 
a result. He spoke of his experien­
ces in Italy where,· he said, "I 
found that the war was a very 
different thing outsi.de of the 
framework of American culture." 
St. Mary's 
Innovation 
The Crux is dead. SMCers 
found themselves with a new set 
of Student Government officers 
and a new newspaper yesterday. 
Although the newly elected offi­
cers will not take office until 
April l, the Innovator officially 
replaced the Crux yesterday as 
SMC's student newpaper. 
Junior Mike Farnum who had 
been previously named retiring 
editor Bev Pagorski's successor as 
Crux editor is editor-in-chief of 
the new publication. 
At first it was decided to con­
tinue with the Crux under new 
editorship, but late Wed. Farnum 
and her associate editors Betty 
Dickson, Nancy Carlin and Katie 
Garrity decided to completely 
revamp the St. Mary's paper 
somewhat along the lines of the 
Voice's transformation into the 
Observer. 

Yesterday's Volume I, Num­ber I had a new layout, a new type face, and was printed on different paper. 
Reception was generally warm at St. Mary's, and Notre Dame journalists were favorably imp­ressed with the feminine effort.

stand, in general." Frericks said that he would consider any kind of response to Reagan at the Convention to be a good show­ing, "But we don't expect to get the nomination on a campus like this." 
Dan Lungren, Campaign Man­ager for Richard Nixon said that he, too, has heard that certain delegations had been 'stacked' and cited the Florida and Texas delegations as examples of this. I have heard that both of these delegations are heavily pro Hat­field, and to me, this just doesn't make sense." Lungren said that he believed many of these dele-
Sex is Sex is Sex 
By PAT GAFNEY 
"Sexuality develops from birth as a long process of con­ditioning... it is not inborn in the child." -It is the "parents and society," not nature that de­termine the individual's sexual role. -To "this generation" be­longs the possibility of "esta­blishing a new family structure" based on freer "more meaningful relationships." These were prom­inent among the ideas offered to· an overflow crowd this Tuesday night in Washington Hall by Dr. Mary S. Calderone. Her lecture was entitled "Sex and Sexuality", the second of four in the 1968 Marriage Institute. 
Dr. Calderone, a 63 year old grandmother, has spoken and written extensively on sex edu­cation and related topics. She has edited Abortion in the United States and the Manual for Con­traceptive Practice, the first text­book of its kind. A daughter of the great photographer Edward Steichen, a graduate of Vassar, the University of Rochester med­ical school and Columbia Uni­versity's School of Public Health, she is a member of the family life committee of the National Council of Churches, and a Qua­ker by profession. For II years, she served as medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federa­tion of America. In July, 1964 she resigned to help establish the Sex Information and Education Council of the U.S. (SIECUS), whose objective is to do for sex what other voluntary agencies have done for tuberculosis, polio and mental illness. 
Her candid presentation of the problems posed by sex education pushes beyond the old dilemnas of the "biological" or the "mor­al" approach. She places the bur­den of responsibility squarely on the individual. Repeatedly she has stressed that it is up to young 
parents to re-evaluate assigned sexual roles, for they communi­cate their own attitudes "quite without words" to their children.

gates were recruited into their respective delegations by the 'well-orgainzed' anti-war conti­gent which has no interest in representing the actual opinions of each state but which is onlv candidate nominated by the Convention. Said Lungren, "Don't call it a Mock Conven­tion, call it a Peace Movement." 
Lungren, delegation chairman 
rt"cir the state of California, said 
that he expected his delegates to 
make a sincere attempt to repre­
sent the views of their state and not their own oersonal political opinion. 
As a pioneer in sex education 
in the U.S., Dr. Calderone views 
the myths of the popular press 
and prissy victorian sensibilities 
as great obstacles in her work. 
"People think sex education is 
when they tell their children how 
babies are born. That's not it. .. 
Sex is what it is to be a man or a 
woman. What that was before is 
not what it is today." 
Dr. Calderone made a prelim­inary distinction between "geni­tal maturity, the totality of the individual's expression of his self." However, she added, "this totality does not necessarily in­volve the genital." It is rather "a flowing out to all our relation­ships, at work, at school, or in any activity." 
Tht process of sexual matura­tion is inescapable, and it "begins in the cradle." "Sex is assigned because of the genitals given at birth." The determination of the child sexual role, or "sexualiza­tion begins immediately to be conveyed by the expectations of the mother, the father and later, society."

The name's the game over at Saint 

Mary's this week as the machine behind 
the College's !25th Jubilee Year goes into 
gear. Just think up an acceptable theme 
for the celebration, and $50 will be 
yours. 
Second semester seniors will do a lot 

 for $50, and coming up with a theme for the sake of God, Country and Saint Mary's is one of them. 
Thus the senior Rec 

rats (those girls who spend 
the wee morning hours ty­
ping and smoking their lives ·away in the Le Mans Hall recreation area) have been devoting considerable time to this little enterprise. 
Soon the entry box near the student post office will 


be filled with suggestions like: "Up from Stagnation," "A Century and a Quarter Without Any Order," "Reaction, not Action" (to paraphrase a certain illustrious sbp campaigner) and "Merger: The Planned Obsolescense of a Women's Finishing School." 
Still other students feel that a quick check of the college catalogue will yield more in the way of themes than a picking of their own minds. 
"The Beatific Vision Fulfilled," "Pre­dicated Upon the Judea-Christian Concept of Man," and "An Academy of Learning For the Education of Young Ladies ... Tudor-Gothic in Style" are some of the more esoteric gems. 
Of course, all this creativity has as its 

'basis the assumption that there will be a Saint Mary's College in need of a theme next year. There have been several joking comments that such will not be the case. However, these nasty thoughts have been laid to rest by our Board of Trustees which has tentatively slated $200,000 to meet the expenses of the Jubilee venture. 
Some question has been raised as to why the school is willing to make such a large financial outlay when faculty salaries are at a much-resented low. Pre­sumably the answer is that the Jubilee 
Year endeavor, complete with visiting professors and a contest to "create. com­munity," will result in more revenue as

I Just Don't Trust Them 
Experienced Seniors can tell our beloved Father Hesburgh that all his talk about a great Catholic University has tragically neglected the focusing agent of 
 all student activism and intellectual con­frontation: the hang-out for the 'in' people, the· leaders of the Budweiser generation. Harvard's status would crum­ble to the level of Bethel College without the near-by presence of Cronin's. And, of course, we have all heard the Yale men sing of the tables down at Mary's. 
Notre Dame men, too, have their place, and it is named simply, but elegant­ly, "Louie's." The brill­
iance of establishment re­sides not just in the com­pany and cuisine, but in the presence of a residence professor, Louie Rappoli. This gentleman is not listed in the Notre Dame faculty catalogue, but the quality of his wisdom and counsel 


is surpassed only by that 

clothed in Frank O'Malley's moving rhe­
toric. 

Now Louie has seen many generations of Notre Dame men come and go during his sedate observations of the fluctuating world scene. From the standpoint of an Italian restaurant, untainted by war, com­munism, and General DeGaulle, one is able to calmly ponder the complexities of various national problems, burdened only 
with the stains oftomatoe paste and not of prejudice. 
One night last week the balding philo­sopher emerged, large and smiling from the confines of his kitchen for the nightly chat with his boys. Everyone immediately makes room for his chair, for he is one of those people that you will fondly remem­ber twenty years from now, not only for his warmth but for his core common sense. He is fond of remarking that books often cloud issues that can be seen with the naked eye. 
Well it just so happens that this night the group is discussing the topic that can fill any conversation lapse: Vietnam. The subject is like a narcotic -everyone has heard most of the facts and arguments 
but few people substitute action for con­tinued talk. Louie had been strangely silent about the war most of the year, but with a few words he quickely sliced the confusio~: "We ought to get out. They're sending all you fellas to get killed, and I just don't trust them." 
Score again for the big Italian. You don't need books or newspapers to tell you that Vietnam has become a cancer pervading this country, causing confusion and distrust among all our countrymen. You don't need facts and figures to tell you that the reaction to the apathy char­acteristic of this country's approach to political problems for so many years has finally come: self-righteous and violent extremism. And it is not just Vietnam. It is the ''Kill Whitey" of black power militants and the preparation of tanks and machine guns to decorate city streets. 
Such political extremism characterized 
Germany before the rise of the Third Reich. And one can't help feeling that perhaps the American people are willing to give anyone power who promises to A-bomb Hanoi, Peking, and rioting slum areas -or to rid the nation miraculously of corrupt politicians in a quick purge. 
If i\ perhaps true that the American people have been cheated by their govern­ment and their President. It is perhaps true that corruption is so deep that the writers ofWhite House news releases could win the Pulitzer prize for fiction. But the answer is not yet the gun, but the ballot box.

Knock the Rock 
Nelson Rockefeller has been a good governor. There are a lot of good roads, better schools, and state scholarships which testify to that fact. But as a presidential hopeful, Rockefeller is suffering from a bad case of Scranton's disease. 
Scranton's disease, also known as hypercautious sublimation of the political ambition, is characterized by a great re­Junctance to say anything, a condition most fully apparent when the non-candi­date "takes a stand." The primary symp­toms to look for are vapid cliches followed by rhetorical utterance, carefully balanced conditional clauses which cancel each other out, and ultimately a firm commit-. ment to peace, brotherhood, the flag and apple pie. 
Scranton's disease pro­vides an excellent comple­ment to Merrick's syn-
potential contributors realize that the lt~rfl'r4~J drom, also known as quote-
place has a past worth celebrating and a future worth toasting. It takes money to make money, etc. 
Unfortunately, in a fit of isolationsim, 

the Jubilee team has limited theme en­
trants to SMC students and faculty. 
But those of you in the co-exchange pro­
gram apparently have a chance, and any

pulling. Like the Broadway producer who takes the word "great" out of a 
reviewer's description of a "great disaster," Rockefel­ler's liberal backers on cam­pus were able to make a 
pretty fair compromise peace candidate out of the Rock by patching together the right phrases from his interview with that great dove newspaper, the Chicago Tribune. 
It wasn't easy of course. They had to leave out a few phrases, notably "He said his original support of the United States commitment for the defense of South Viet Nam against communist aggression had not changed." It's also handy to leave out conditionals, so that Rocky (in the flyer put out by his campus sup­porters) says "there is a lack of a clear long term goal"' But in the Chicago Tri­bune interview from which this statement is freely translated, Rockefeller says, "And if there is a criticism of the Johnson administration, I would say it's in the lack ...etc." Ifyou want to make a non-candidate sound forceful, you just have to distort a little. 
There is also a slight difference between the last paragraph of the Tribune inter­view and the flyer "reprint." In both, Rockefeller says, "I think it's fair to say that all of us, as Americans, are pr.aying for an honorable peace in Viet Nam which can bring to an end a war that really is a tragedy for all Americans ... " The Rockefeller supporters end their flyer on that high and touching note. Unfortun­ately, the Tribune adds a phrase, " ... and yet one which we've gone into in good faith and with the highest principles." 
The recent hearing on the Gulf of Tonkin incident might cast some doubt on whether our principles were even second­highest, but in Rockefeller's case, it doesn't make much difference. He has kept his head down so long that he is no longer worth shooting at, and even the cleverest editor can only make a political corpse look good for a short while.

titute existence.  
We criticize, aching to .  
apply the academic know­ 
how recently acquired. But  
underlying all this seeming  
ferment and righteous in­ 
dignation is the realization  
that we are secure. Not much will happen  
if we pop off occasionally. It is highly  
unlikely that we will have to act on our  
existant principles. It's a soft life.  
We call for drastic renewal and reform  
on the part of our leaders. We cry out for  
correction of government policy in the  
cities, civil rights and Viet Nam. We be­ 
moan the wishy-washy actions of our  
politicians. What we don't realize is that  
we created them by our own evasive ap­ 
proach to national problems.  
Remember when civil rights was an im­ 
minent concern? There were marches, sit­ 
ins, song fests and all sorts of groovy  
gatherings. Masses moved. People felt to­ 
gether. Individuals were lost in the move­ 
ment which, sad to say, is what they  
wanted. Since mass response means mass  
consciousness, when it came down to in­ 
dividual responsibility, we all shrugged our  
shoulders and asked what more could we  
do. It was socially acceptable to go to  
Selma, Montgomery, and Washington, but  
it was certainly socially unacceptable to  
register voters, correct poor living condi­ 
tions and help the Negro in our own com­ 
munity. We then shifted the blame. The  
government won't give money to solve the  
problems of the Negro. The politicians  
won't listen, they have no compassion.  
That's a lie. It's not "them", it's WE. We  
won't write to plea for government funds.  I  
We won't work in our own communities  
for equal opportunity, jobs and housing.  
It's we. The we who vote and don't vote.  '  
The we who are latent racist~. The weak­ 
willed we who see our own rationaliza­ 
tions in our own elected officials.  
Another example is the current atti­ 
tude toward Viet Nam. The campus is a  
proverbial hotbed of dissent, criticism  
and resistance. It has become popular to  
be anti-war. It, too, is now socially ac­ 
ceptable. But the reaction is the same as  
that which plagued civil rights. When it  
comes down to action, we hedge, we ra­ 
tionalize, we join ROTC.  
I'm a bit tired of the American ap­ 
proach to foreign and domestic problems.  
I'm tired of hearing Bobby Kennedy con­ 
demn the war on page one, refuse to sup­ 
port Eugene McCarthy on page two, then  
back Lyndon all the way on page three.  
I'm tired of hearing future military offi­ 
cers say we are wrong in Viet Nam. I'm  
tired of committed seniors who condemn  
the war effort while joining the ROTC  
rush to feed the military machine.
