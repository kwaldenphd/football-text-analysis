Student goods stolen; suspect identified 
by Mark Rust Staff Reporter 
A Mishawaka suspect, foiled by his lack of imagination and the alertness of a janitor, is being sought in connection with the· theft of a University student's property from the Self-Lock Storage Com­pany in Mishawaka according to the Mishawaka Police-Detective Bureau. 
The name of the subject has not 

• been released. 
: The recovery of the goods and the identification of a suspect was made much easier for the police when it was discovered by a custodian Tuesday that a rented locker--adjacent to the one he was cleaning--held a number of boxes that fit the description of those stolen. 
" Evidently, the suspect broke the inside lock and simply hauled the property into his own rented locker directly across the aisle," Sgt. William Biron of the bureau said. 
Acting on a search warrant issued yesterday, the police in­spected the boxes, identified the contents, and took the name of their suspect from the rental register. 
Peter Rimkus, a junior Science major, told police Friday that every one of the 34 marked boxes that he had stored last spring had been taken over the summer. Most of the stolen property--includ­ing two refrigerators, two chests of drawers, trunks, bookcases and shelving--was recovered. All the items in the suspect's locker were identified by the police as belong­ing to Rimkus. 
According to the police, the 
whereabouts of the suspect are known and, upon issuance of an arrest warrant, "an arrest will be 
forthcoming."

Leaders ask for prayers 
Mideast summit under way 
CAMP DAVID, Md. [AP] Presi­dent Carter sat down with Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem Begin for the first big three talks at the Mideast summit yesterday and joined them in asking the world to pray for success. 
•'We ask people of all faiths to pray with us that peace and justice may result from these deliberations," the three leaders said in a state­ment issued by the White House less than two hours before their 3 
p.m. EDT meeting. 
White House spokesman Jody Powell said. the plea for prayer probably was Carter's idea. 
The meeting, at Carter's lodge, lasted an hour and 40 minutes. The three leaders gathered on a flag­stone patio with a panoramic view of this forested, 134 -acre presi­dential hideaway in the mountains of western Maryland. 
But there was no word afterward about what was said or whether any progress was made. 
It was the first meeting between the Egyptian president and the Israeli prime minister since Christ­mas at Ismailia, an Egyptian city on the Suez Canal, where they set up 
negotiations between their foreign ministers. The ministerial talks broke down in mid-January. 
Historians at the Library of Congress said it also marked the first time an American president had met with the chiefs of state of 
Israel and Egypt at the same time to try to settle the decades-old dispute between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East. 
After the meeting, President and Mrs. Carter took a hike around Camp David with Prime Minister and Mrs. Begin. The Israeli leader's wife arrived during the afternoon after attending a rela­tive's wedding in Toronto. 
While they were hiking, Sadat took a 45-minute motor tour around neighboring towns near the Penn­sylvania border. Mrs. Sadat was visiting an ill grandchild in Paris and had no plans to join her husband at the Camp David summit. 
President Sadat and Prime Minis­ter Begin spoke breifly to each · other as they encountered one 
another during early afternoon walks at this forested presidential retreat in the mountains of western Maryland. 
Powell called it a "chance encount­er" and said it happened at 12:15 p.m.. The spokesman said Begin and Sadat exchanged pleasantries for about two minutes and were joined by Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, who rode up on a bicycle. 
Vice-President Walter F. Mondale was summoned from Washington, 65 miles away, early yesterday. Carter had left Mondale in Wash­ington to tend to non-summit business, but the president had said he planned to include the vice president in important sessions. 
Carter, acting as middleman, set the stage for the three-way session by huddling separately first with Begin and then Sadat. 
Because of Carter-imposed se­crecy, there were no disclosures about the substance of the talks. 
"The style and tone has been quite informal," Powell said. 
The separate meetings were Carter's first steps at this historic summit to find solutions to the 30-year conflict in the Middle East between Arabs and Israelis. The task of narrowing their differences looked long and hard. The summit could last 10 days to two weeks. 
The private talk between Carter and Begin was Tuesday night. Begin made his way through the trees at this presidential retreat from his lodge to Aspen Lodge, where Carter is staying. Israeli sources, asking not to be identified, said the talk lasted J'tf1 hours. 
The president then saw Sadat yesterday morning, again without 
authorizing any announcement on the substance of the meeting. Before they were enveloped in secrecy, Sadat and Begin expres­sed sharply differing assessments of the goals of the summit. 
Clearly seeking a dramatic break­through -and countin on Carter to wring major concessions from 
Israel -Sadat declared in an arrival statement on Tuesday that "this is no time for maneuvers and worn­out ideas." 
Begin viewed summit goals in more modest terms, . saying the Israeli delegation "will make all endeav­ors possible to reach an agreement so that the peace process can continue and ultimately be crowned with peace treaties." 
Carter himself has expressed limit­ed expectations for the summit, saying "no one can ensure the degree of success which we might enjoy."

No new evidence revealed as Connaii.Y and wife testify 
Washington [AP] Former Texas Governor and Mrs. John Connally recounted yesterday the moments when President John F. Kennedy was cut down from behind by an assassin's bullet, and said they heard no firing from the front. 
A congressional hearing at which the Connallys testified produced gasps from spectators who were reminded of the shock of those 
frightening moments of American history, but no important · new evidence about the assassination surfaced. 
Giving no support to theories that two gunmen were firing in a conspiracy to assassinate the presi­dent, the Connallys said there were three shots and all came from behind them. 
Their testimony to the House assassinations committee support­ed the Warren Commission's con­clusion that acting alone, murdered the presi­dent in Dallas, firing three shots from a sixth-floor window to the rear of the president's car. 
Some investigators say that there may have been some firing from a grassy knoll in front of the motor­cade. 
''You heard none from the grassy knoll?" asked Rep. Samuel Devine, R-Ohio. ''No, sir,'' Connally replied, ''and I don't think any came from there." "We reacted to the shots," Mrs. Connally testified. "If one had come from the front we would have reacted to it." 
The Connallys were in Kennedy's car when the president was assas­sinated Nov. 22. l%.l. f'nnnAllv was wounded. 
They testified, as they have before. that Connally either was -or may have been -hit by a separate bullet. 
But they said it was one of three from behind. 
Mrs. Connally testified that she distinctly heard three shots and perceived that the first hit Kennedy the second hit her husband. and the third hit the president. 
Connally testified he i's not certain himself that he was hit with a separate bullet but said he is certain he was hit by the second shot which came from behind. 
''There has been a great deal of speculation that the president and I were hit with the same bullet." Connally said. "That may well be. But it wasn't the first shot." 
The amateur motion picture film of the assassination was shown in the hearing room -drawing a gasp from spectators when the president was hit -and then Mr. and Mrs. Connally were asked to give their own recollection. 
"I heard what I though was a rifle shot." Connally said. "I think it came from over my right shoulder. I looked at the president because I. frankly.. h~d the fear it might be an assas~nation. 
"I never made the full tum. I was hit. I was knocked over. Just doubled over. The force of the bullet drove my body over about double. I could see I was almost drenched with blood. 
"I only heard two shots. I did not hear the shot that hit me. I heard another shot, the third. It hit with a loud impact."

]apan to help restore site 
ATHENS, Greece-Greece has approved $270,000 in credits for the importation of titanium from Japan to help restore the 2,500-year-old Acropolis monuments, officials said Wednesday. Greece stopped all imports from Japan last June becau.,e the trade balance favored the Japanese. The decision to import the highly costly metal was seen as an attempt to get the Japanese to import more Greek goods. The metal, resistant to erosion and temperature changes, will be used to support the marble temples.

Ticket office prepares for scalpers 
by John McGrath 

Officials at the Athletic Ticket office are bracing for the annual bout with a perennial problem that accompianies Notre Dame football --ticket scalping. 
Mike Busick, ticket manager, says that the situation this year is no different, and that standard procedures will be followed. 
"If we know of any instance or get any proof that a person is charging an inflated price for tickets, we will revoke that person's priviledge of purchasing tickets in the future", Busick said. 
According to the ticket office manager, South Bend police, both uniformed and plain-clothes, will aid in the detection of potential scalpers at Saturday's game and 
SLF holds 
organizational 
meeting 

Any sophomore interested in helping with the Sophomore Liter­ary Festival should attend· an organizational meeting Monday Sept. 11 at 7 PM in the Grace Hall penthouse. 
The festival is an annual event 
which has, in the past, brought to campus such writers as Tennessee Williams, Edward· Albee, Kurt Vonnegut, Jorge Luis Borges, Ken 
throughout the season. In addition to South Bend police, campus security personnel will be stationed at the student gates. 
"The police are instructed to confiscate the tickets and to ask any scalpers to leave the university grounds", Busick said. "If we catch any student, (scalping) we will confiscate their I.D. as well as their ticket and turn the card over to the Dean of Students office for disciplinary action", the manager said. According to Busick, there are 
Graduate tests hold registration 
Students planning to take one or more of the admission tests requir­ed by graduate and professional schools are advised to register for the tests immediately. A disrupt­ion in mail service could prevent those who delay from being regist­ered for the early fall examinations. 
Registration Deadlines for the examinations are: 
Sept. 11 ;  Dental Admission Test (DAT),  
Sept. 14;  Law School Admission Test (LSAT)  
Sept. 21; Sept. 28.  Graduate Management Admission Test(GMAT) Graduate Record Examination (GRE),  

usually about a half-dozen scalpers caught each game. "As long as people are willing to pay, there is going to be scalping'', he said. 
Busick offered no consolation to those who might by cheated by scalpers, saying only "our best advise is not to pay the price, and they will eventually come down( to a more realistic figure.)"

ND looks into new check-out system 

by John Fenoll 
The University is currently in­vestigating the feasibility of a new computer check-out system, accor­ding to David E. Sparks, Director of University Libraries. 
The mini-computer would assist the libraries in keeping track of book loans, and would keep the bookshelves, which are now •in 'disarray', in better order, accordinl! to Sparks. 
Library administratorswere given a demonstration of the computer system in action at Western Michigan University and were im­pressed with its efficiency. The computer, which is manufactured by Computer Library Systems Inc. of Boston, would cost the Univer­sity an estimated $350,000, ex­cluding installation fees. 
Sparks is optimistic about the computer, but stated that the University must depend on "a gift from some alumnus" in order to invest in the new checkout system.

OBUD still unable to function I 
by Pat Mangan 

As of yet, the Ombudsman office has not been able to resume its services to the Notre Dame -Saint Mary's community. Normally, the Ombudsman Service (OBUD) is in operation seven to ten days after the beginning of the fall semester. This year however, OBUD was edged out of its former office to accomodate the unusually large cabinet of Student Body President Andy McKenna. Although moving has been an inconvenience, it is not 
OBUD's main problem since their new location is only a door away from their old office on the second floor of LaFortune. The real problem is that OBUD's new office is yet to be equipped with tele­phones. 
Tom Lux, Director of OBUD said, "It takes a least seven to ten days to gather and correct our information." Lux had expected to be in service by Tuesday, but since OBUD primarily supplies informat­ion to the community by telephone, it is at the moment severly handi­capped. 
Lux was surprised by the delay and had expected the phones to be installed by last Friday. He was not sure of exactly who or what was causing the hold up, but Director of Student Activities John Reid offer-

O'Meara urges research in faculty hiring criterion 
by Rob Powers 

University Provost 0. Timothy O'Meara says he will stress the criterion of research in the hiring of faculty. · 
•'The natural home of work of this sort is the University", O'Meara said, "since it is research which distinguishes a university from a college. To make it a university, distinguished research must be performed here. ' 
O'Meara explained that research includes not only laboratory work in the sciences, but also creativity on the part of the faculty in the liberal arts and business. 
O'Meara stated that research has gradually become one of the pri­mary considerations for admission to the faculty during the Hesburgh Administration, and since then, the faculty has become much more involved in research. 
While O'Meara described Notre Dame as a "First rate university" in the area of teaching, he added, "We are not yet distinguished in research. What we are doing should be of a higher order in the area of research." 
Clark Equipment funds series 
The first business lecture in a series funded by a $100,000 gift from-the Clark Equipment Co., Buchanan, Mi. will begin in April, 1979. 
Bro. Leo Ryan, dean of the College of Business, said, "We will have more details after the dinner on Oct. 5." At that time, fifteen members of the business faculty and fifteen senior officers of Clark Equipment will meet at the Center for Continuing Education to name a general chairman and appoint a committee for the lecture series. 
The $100,000 gift was announced May 6 at the time of the company's 75th anniversary. B.E. Phillips, president of Clark, presented the grant to University President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh as a memorial to the company's first president, Eugene Clark.

O'Meara said he will encourage the individual departments to more strongly emphasize research as a criterion for hiring faculty and determining tenure. · 
O'Meara added, however, that the total potential of a candidate, and not just his research back­ground, is the primary consider­ation when he is being reviewed for a position. "One must not only ask 'How good is this person?' "he said, "but 'How good will he become?' " 
Sister John Miriam Jones, Assist· ant Provost, explained that there are three qualifications necessary for admission to the faculty: the quality of the candidate's research, the candidate's ability as a teacher, and the candidate's ability to relate to his colleagues and students. 
Jones pointed to the problem of notable researchers in the univer­sities who have no teaching ability. ''There is a great vacuum for good teaching in the universities. Re­search can not be stressed over the ability to convey that knowledge to the student."

In U.S. Open
Walts' winning streak spoiled by McEnroe 
NEW YORK [AP] • John McEnroe ended the rampage of giant-killer Butch Walts Tuesday, defeating him 6-1, 6-2, 7-6, in the quarter-finals of the U.S. Open tennis championships. 
And second-._seeded Chris Evert put down teen-ager Tracy Austin 7-5, 6-1, while top-seeded Martina Navratilova easily beat 11th-seeded Virginia Ruzici of Romania 6-3, 6-2. 
In the lone night singles ntatch, fourth-seeded Vitas Gerulaitis was to play Johan Kriek of South Africa in another quarter-final. McEnroe, the 19-ye .. r-old who seeded 15th, 
• encountered little of the intensity that Walts had used in dumping defending champion Guillermo Vilas Monday night. 
Walts, who served spectacularly against Vilas, served well-74 percent of his first serves were good-but not nearly so emphatical­ly. He aced just six times, the same as McEnroe. 
But clearly the match wasn't decided on service. Walts never broke service, except for one point in the final-set tiebreaker. 
McEnroe was faster and more successful at the net, and virtually controlled the first two sets. 
Walts played a smarter game in the final set but couldn't get ahead. McEnroe won the tiebreaker 7-4. 
McEnroe, meanwhile, advances to the semifinal against the winner of a quarter-final match against the winner of the Jimmy Connors­Brian Gottfried quarter-final Thursday. 
This is the farthest the young New Yorker has ever made it in the Open, having fallen in the fourth round last year. His best showing ever, the one that spotlighted him as a rising star was his trip to the semifinals of Wimbledon in 1977, where he lost to Connors. 
He was upset in the ftrst round of Wimbledon this year by Erik van Dillen, a former U.S. Davis Cup player who had slipped nearly to obscurity. 
Austm, the 1.)-year-old fifth seed who was the other sensation at Wimbledon 1977, had her best showing ever against Evert -at 
least in the first game.  She plays  
very much  like  Evert,  with  two­ 
fisted  backhands  and  sweeping  

forehands. She also likes to stand back and rally. But she still isn't as strong as Evert, and the older woman did a better job of mixing her shots. 
Navratilova, who has lost only 16 games so far, never ROing to a third 

set, says it doesn't bother her that between Wendy Turnbull and
