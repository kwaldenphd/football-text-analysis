Super Tuesday vote to narrow field 
Twenty1our states to participate in largest number ofprimaries and caucuses ever held in one day 
By DAVIS RHORER, Jr. News Writer 
The remaining candidates competing for the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations will face their biggest hurdle yet in today's Super Tuesday primary and caucus elections. 
The previous primaries and caucuses this election season have sent delegates to numer­ous candidates on both sides of the political arena, failing to identify one "stand out" con­tender. With such close races, the elections today in 24 states could be a turning point for candidates seeking the nomi­nations. 
"This is the closest we've ever been to a national pri­mary" David Campbell, a Notre Dame political science professor, said Saturday. 
Notre Dame political science professor Peri Arnold echoed those sentiments. This year's Super Tuesday elections, so named because of the large number of primaries and cau­cuses held, marks the largest number of states ever to dis­tribute delegates in a single day in the approximately 30 years the United States has used the primary and caucus system, he said. 
"We haven't had an open race in a long time" Arnold said, referring to the absence of a "favorite choice" for the nomination in both the Democratic and Republican parties. Campbell said President George W. Bush's very low popularity level is a reason behind the current presidential race's competi­tiveness. 
"Winning early has not worked well [in this election]" Campbell said. 
He emphasized the potential shifts in popularity that have already forced some previous­ly well-known candidates out of the race. 
Arnold emphasized his sur­prise at the resiliency of the Republican Party, especially considering Bush's low popu­larity. 
"[This race] shouldn't be competitive," Arnold said. "All things would point to a victory for the opposition." 
While both Campbell and Arnold acknowledged the diverse group of candidates competing, Saint Mary's histo­ry professor Amanda Littauer

Protests held against Colombian kidnappings 
Delayed release oftwo hostages triggers worldwide marches; resentment builds against FARC 
By LIZ MILLER 
News Writer 
A protest against violence and kidnappings committed by a guerrilla group that began as a Colombian Facebook group in January expanded into a day of protest marches in over 100 cities worldwide Monday. Notre Dame's campus club Organizacion Latino Americana held a rosary in soli­darity with the marches Monday night in the Cavanaugh chapel. 
The largest guerrilla group in Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia IFARC), was established in 1964 by the Colombian Communist party. It is consider~d a terrorist group because of its kidnapping, narcotics trafficking and tradi­tional military action against the Colombian military. 
The Facebook group and worldwide protests were trig­gered in part by the delayed release of two political hostages, though popular sentiment against the kidnappings has been build­ing for decades. 
Organizacion Latino Americana (OLA) is trying to help students "become more aware of what's going on in Latin America," club president Carla Sanchez said. 
Club member Santiago Garces, a sophomore from Colombia who heard about the protest marches through Facebook, suggested the rosary service. 
"We have had 40 years of suf­fering and every story gets even worse," Garces said. ''I've heard people who were kidnapped tell their stories, there are no words." 
Garces lamented that class pre­

ACE hosts First Lady at Catholic school 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
First lady Laura Bush visit­ed a Washington, D.C., ele­mentary school partnered with the Notre Dame-affiliat­ed Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE) on Wednesday. 
Her visit to Holy Redeemer School took place during Catholic Schools Week, an annual celebration of Catholic schools and their contribu­tions to their communities and the nation. 
The ACE Magnificat Initiative has given Holy Redeemer School support and resources since it was nearly shut down two years ago, ACE Director for Education Outreach Aaron Wall said. 
The Magnificat Initiative partners the University and ACE with a Catholic school that is in danger of being closed down and gives schools the tools and resources to continue educating students, Wall said. These include training, marketing and finance expertise and funding. The partnership also makes ACE teachers and principles available to schools. 
Wall said the first lady's visit was an indication of ACE's success in Catholic schools nationwide. 
"Coming from an educator herself, it is great to [have Laura Bush] garner national attention for the ACE pro­gram," he said. "It gives us that recognition I feel we

OIT finds flaw-s with ENSsystem 
Students, staffmembers receive test notifications 
By JOSEPH McMAHON Assisstant News Editor 
The Office of Information Technology tested the Emergency Notification System Friday to mixed results, an OIT official said Monday. 
The office sent students and staff members e-mails, text message and voice mails at 2 
p.m. on Friday. There were some delays in the system, and some of the text messages failed to reach their intended destina­tion, said Jay Steed, executive assistant to the chief informa­tion officer at OIT. 
"We had successes and some opportunities that weren't per­fect," Steed said. "There's always room for improvement. We have some pretty high stan­dards for delivery of these mes­sages. That's why we do the testing, to make sure we can get all t?,e tweaks out of the sys­tem. 
Steed said the system will require improvements and he considers it a top priority to make the system flawless. 
OIT is still compiling data from the test and is not ready to release specific numbers, although Steed said the office has an idea where the major problems occurred.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Hey Skip, you're W"rong 
As a San Francisco 49ers fan, I didn't have a rooting interest in this year's NFL playoffs. Then Skip Bayless opened his mouth. 
Just after New England defeated the New York Giants 38-35 in Week 17, the loud­
mouth ESPN  Chris Hlne  
"analyst" went  
on TV and called out  Sports Editor  
Giants coach  

Tom Coughlin for playing his starters the entire game in an attempt to beat the then-undefeated Patriots. Bayless called Coughlin's decision one of the worst coaching decisions he's ever seen and said the Giants stood no chance in the playoffs because they were injured. lie said Coughlin missed an oppor­tunity to heal some of his players. 
Only Bayless didn't articulate his argument as calmly as I made him sound. Arms flailing, temper flar­ing, Bayless screamed that Coughlin was an idiot and had no chance to beat Tampa Bay in the first round, much less win the Super Bowl. Well, despite what Bayless would have you believe, Tom Coughlin knew his team pretty well. 
He knew if the Giants were going to make it through the best the NFC had to offer, and win the Super Bowl a few weeks later, they should see how they stack up against a team that was 1 7-0 and supposedly one of the best ever. And they almost won the game. 
So when the cantankerous Coughlin told his team in the locker room before every playoff game they could beat anyone, and they were the best team in football, they believed him. llis words weren't just hollow preaching that had no substance to back it up. When everyone in the locker room truly believes they are the best, that can overcome any injury. But Bayless failed to see that logic. Instead, Bayless decided he would usc air­time to slam Coughlin. Even after the Super Bowl, Bayless failed to admit he was wrong. How arrogant can one man get? 
Skip, you were wrong. Admit it. Congratulate Tom Coughlin, who clearly knows more about football than you do, and move on. It's peo­ple like Skip Bayless who give sports journalists a bad name and makes young people consider turn­ing away from the profession. He's confrontational just for the sake of being confrontational. He says peo­ple should be fired without even so much as an ounce of regard for their families, who just might be watching his program at home or who might hear about it later. And he criticizes in an unnecessarily over-the-top manner. It's one thing to be critical of someone, it's anoth­er thing to be just plain mean about it. 
I hope Bayless is able to keep his fa~ade of self-worth going the rest of his life, because if he ever catch­es a glimpse of what he has become, it will easily surpass the horror of having to admit he's wrong.

National group honors Hesburgh 
University president emeritus receives higher education award 
Special to The Observer 
The National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU) has selected University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh as the 2008 recipi­ent of the Henry Paley Memorial Award. 
Hesburgh will receive the award with prerecorded remarks from NAICU President David L. Warren at the association's annual meet­ing Tuesday at the Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill. University President Father John Jenkins will attend and accept the award on Hesburgh's behalf. 
Since 1985, the Paley Award has recognized an individual who, throughout his or her career, has unfailingly served the students and faculty of independent higher educa­tion. The recipient of the award has set an example for all who would seek to advance educational opportunity in the United States. The Paley Award is named for Henry Paley, president of the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities of New York from 1975 until 1984.

Prof nan1ed to political conunittee 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame political scientist Darren Davis has been appoint­ed to an ad hoc committee of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) to evaluate the New Hampshire primary polls. 
Polling taken the day before the New Hampshire primary indicated a 10-point lead for Sen. Barack Obama that turned into a 3-point deficit once results were tabulated. 
The AAPOR is the leading pro­fessional organization of public opinion and survey research professionals in the U.S., with members from academia, media, government, the non­profit sector and private indus­try. 
Drawing from the experience of the 1948 Committee on Analysis of Pre-election Polls and Forecasts, which incorrectly predicted the Truman-Dewey race, the AAPOR's ad hoc com­mittee will evaluate the method­ology of the pre-election primary polls and the way results are reported by the media and used to characterize the contests in pre-election press coverage. The committee will archive the data related to the 2008 primaries for future scholarly research and will evaluate how polls have been and can be optimally used in reporting. 

The committee also will review pre-election polls in the South Carolina and February 5 "Super Tuesday" primaries, which will provide additional evidence that may inform theories concerning the New Hampshire polls. 
A nationally recognized expert in public opinion, Davis special­izes in political psychology, polit­ical behavior, public opinion, research methods and racial politics.

T h e department also takes recommendations from sen­iors studying French for which movies to include. 
The festival is made pos­sible through a grant from FACE, French American Cultural Exchange, and a number of other founda­tions, Derakhshani said. 
In years past, the events have attracted between 50 and 60 viewers each night. 
"Saint Mary's students, faculty and staff, as well as people from the Notre Dame community, local high school students and local community people attend," Derakhshani said. 

Admission is free and open to the public. Each screening will begin at 7 p.m. 
The film ".Brodeuses" will play Tuesday. The film involves a teenager who is forced to move out of her home because she is preg­nant. In order to support herself, she begins working as an embroiderer with an older woman and gains a wealth of knowledge. 
The film "Delwende, leve­toi et marc he" will play Wednesday. This movie involves the emotional struggle of a teenage rape victim who does

The final film, "Les ami­ties malefiques," will play Friday. This film follows the lives of French college stu­dents who try to emulate another student, but find that they are better off by themselves.

The school's current teach­ing stall" includes ACE teacher Maggie Schroeder, who teach­es second grade and is in her second year of the ACE pro­gram, and Notre Dame gradu­ate Molly Walsh. The school's principal, Ben Ketcham, is also a Notre Damn alumnus and ACE graduate. 
IJoly Hndeemer School is in its first year of the five-year Magnilkat program. 
"It's only been f'ive to six months that we've been involved," Wall said. "This was a school that was ready to dose its doors. and it has made inennlible improve­ments. lloly Hednemer still has a long way to go. but rela­tive to what it was last year, it is excnlling." 
Wall said the most meaning­ful aspect of Bush's visit is its importance to the students. 
"The largnst impact is on the students at lloly Hedeemer, that someone like Mrs. Bush will take time out of their day Ito visit theml." Wall said. "The first lady offered to come, being that the school was in her back­yard. It was beautiful that she took her time."

Steed said the University needs to revise the system it uses to snnd text messages to students. 
"One of the things that we found Friday eVPning after the test is that there was an issue with text rnnssaging capabili­ties," Stend said. "Wn know that some of the text messages did not go out." 
orr is currently meeting with Connect-ED. the vendor responsible for delivering the nwssaging snrviens for emer­gnney voice mail, text mes­sages and e-mail to discuss possibln solutions. "Connect­ED is saying that a number of text messages did not get dnliven~d at all, and that had to do with a problem in their eomputnr eode," said Steed. 

Every person who volun­tnnred cell phone infor·mation should have received a text mnssage. Under the old sys­tem, students had to sign up for text messages, but Steed said the Connect-Ed "has sinee changed the model to auto­matically opt 1werybody in that has provided a enll phone number so that they would receive a text rrwssagn." 
If students do not wish to rneeive a text message, they can choose to opt out of the systnm on the orr Web site. 
There were also delays in Initiative. 

Wall said several ACE grad­uates and Notre Dame alumni participated in the week's events. 
Holy Redeemer School is one of three Magnificat schools nationwide. The other two are St. Adalbert in South Bend and St. Anne in Chicago, which both started the pro­gram In 2006. 
The first lady's visit also coincided with President Bush's State of the Union pro­posal to oll'er $300 million in Pell Grants for Kids to aid to low-income students. The president also proposed the White House Summit on Inner-City Children, which Bush said will unite educa­tors, business leaders and philanthropists to raise awareness about private schools. 
"!The proposal] ean only stand to impact us positively ... and to give more students an opportunity to be enrolled in K-12 education," Wall said. "It's very exciting for us knowing that attention is going to be put on Catholic education. It would give us an opportunity to share the spot­light and share with others the good work that we are doing."

the e-mail system, Steed said. 
"OIT is also working on the issues regarding sending out the emails to the Notre Dame community, because it was not as fast as we had hoped and planned for," he said. 
While orr hopes the system will someday be flawless, Steed said there always will be somo errors. 
"At any given point a num­ber of contacts won't be reached because of data-entry errors or a third-party e-mail account no longer exists," he said. "We always have a per­centage of contacts that won't be roaelmd." 
Steed said he has seen no significant increase in the amount of people who volun­teer their eell phone informa­tion, though he said orr plans to put out advertising on cam­pus urging students to provide that information. 
"We'd love to see 100 per­cent partieipations with regard to cell phones," he said. 
Moreover, although the University had planned only one test of the system this semester, Steed said that the results might require OIT to perform another assessment. 
"There's a steering commit­tee with Connect-ED and we will determine the next test date when we meet again next week," Steed said. "We had hoped that we would only have to test once this semester to try to make sure we didn't dilute the effectiveness of the system, but given some of the results we may look into hav­

vented Notre Dame students from 
attending the mareh in Chicago. 
"Part of the responsibility I have as a Colombian is to do well in school so that when I go back I can be a better person," he said. 
One Notre Dame graduate stu­dent, Hubert George, has had personal experience with the kid­napping threats in Colombia. 
George's family moved from their home in Barranquilla, Colombia, to Miami five years ago after receiving increasing num­bers of threats from the FAHC. 
In Colombia, George's father had been ,a neurologist and mayor of the coastal eity of Barranquilla from 1995 to 1997. 
"In all that period, you always have threats," George said. "l had my bodyguard wait for me after school. It's not comfortable to deal with." 
After his brief political involve­ment, George's father went back to his medical practice. He con­sidered running for oflice again, at whieh point the threats increased. 
"My father got seared whenever they mentioned his child," George said. "They wanted to speak to him about his political agenda. 
"These people, to get their goals, they do whatever they want, and kidnapping is one of the means that they use to put pressure on anyone they want. Kidnapping, and the way they treat hostages, is against humani­tarian law." 
George compared the barbed wire-surrounded FAHC hostage camps to the concentration eamps of World War II. 
In order to escape encountering members of FARC, George's fami­ly moved to the United States in March 2003, when he was 20 years old. 
The family arrived as tourists and was granted political asylum within three months. 
"It was a very, very, very hard experience for me," George said. "It's not easy to deal with this big changes." 
The move was also difficult for 

George's parents, who had estab­
lished careers in Colombia. After 
30 years of practicing in 
Colombia, where he had been 
president of the Colombian 
Neurological Association, 
George's father is trying to enter 
residency in the United States. 
"That's something I admire," George said. "My mother was a philosopher and a lawyer in Colombia, but here she has noth­ing to do." 
George's brother is currently living in Sweden, where he helped to organize the protest march in Stockholm. 
"This mareh is to let people know that Colombians am against FARC's actions, against kidnap­pings, and it is to ask IFARCl to release those civilians that are not related with the war and gov­ernment," George said. 
Scott Mainwaring, director of the Kellogg Institute, said FARC and other guerrilla groups were formed throughout Latin America in the aftermath of the Cuban Hnvolution in 1959. 
The formation of FAHC was "nothing all that unusual," he said. 
"What is remarkable is how durable this group has been and how powerful it has become," he said. 
Not until the 1980s, with the group involved in illegal drug running, did "you get a gradual intensification of what had been an almost irrelevant, low-seale conflict," Mainwaring said. "At one point it was a grotesquely misguided idealism. Today there is clearly a significant dose of opportunism, money making and cynicism as well." 
Mainwaring said there have been human rights violations by all the guerilla groups, but pres­sure from the United States has prompted the Colombian govern­ment to reduce state involvement in human rights abuses. 
Colombian President Alvaro 
Uribe has made "a great 

improvement in the security sys­
tem of his country," Mainwaring 
said. 
OLA member Garces said 

gu«;lrilla groups have focused 
recently on improving their inter­
national appearance. 

'That makes you siek," Garces said. "Obviously it's people who are not informed about what's going on. They are misled in believing these people are free­dom lighters." 
The groups may have some legitimacy behind their aims, but not their means, Garces said. 
"The reasons the guerilla groups are f<>rmed -social injus­tice -are things that need to bn combated, but what it has turned into is a business of death," he said. 
Both George and Garces emphasized the significance of a unified movement. 
"If a lot of people are doing a mareh, it will be very dear to everyone that they are terrorist<;," George said. "Maybe that's not dear." 
Garces said the protests are "the first time that Colombia as a whole stands up and daims we're not going to put up with this any­morn." 
He emphasized the importance of the protests for national well­being. 
"I think everyone in Colombia has been stained by the war and the guerilla," he said.

Children's home attacked in Kenya 
SUGOI, Kenya -Just a few hours after young­sters at a children's home in western Kenya fin­ished the soccer game, their fellow players turned on them. 
The attackers crept out of a cofli~e plantation, smeared with clay and armed with spears, machetes. bows and arrows. Then they burned and looted the home that served as the only refuge for 130 children with troubled pasts. One child heard an attacker mention President Mwai Kibaki, who is accused of stealing this country's Dnc. 27 election. 
The attack on the Sugoi-Munsingen Children's llome and School this weekend is one more example of the turmoil that has followed the dis­putml election. Prot£1sts quickly degenerated into clashes that killed more than 1,000 people. Much of the violence has pitted other ethnic groups against Kibaki's Kikuyu people, long resentPd for their dominance of business and politics. 
U.S. military accidentally kills civilians 
BAGHDAD-The U.S. military said Monday it accidentally killed nine Iraqi civilians during an opPration targeting al-Qaida in Iraq -the dead­liest known case of mistaken identity in recent months. 
In northern Iraq, Turkish warplanes on Monday bombed some 70 Kurdish rebel targets, the Turkish military said. It was the fifth aerial attack against Kurdish rebel bases there in two months. 
Also Monday, 15 suspected militants were killed in U.S. raids targeting a possible hideout for a senior al-Qaida in Iraq leader northeast of Baghdad, the military said. 
NATIONAL NEWS 
Boy Scout charged with mwdering family 
COCKEYSVILLE, Md. -Police say a 15-year-old Boy Scout charged with killing his parents and two younger brothers shot them as they slept, then returned a day later after spending time with friends to stage the discovery of their deaths. 
A judge denied bail for Nicholas Browning on Monday, though his attorney cited his strong aca­demic background and lack of a prior criminal record in seeking to have it set at $1 million instead. 
"I don't even think he's even been suspended from school," attorney Steve Silverman said. "Quite frankly, it's really quite shocking." 
Officials believe the teen had shot his father, mother, and brothers with one of his father's guns Friday, then tossed the handgun in some bushes and left. 


Nature-based recreation declining 
WASHINGTON -As people spend more time communing with their televisions and comput­ers, the impact is not just on their health, researchers say. Less time spent outdoors means less contact with nature and, eventually, less interest in conservation and parks. 
Camping, fishing and per capita visits to parks are all declining in a shift away from nature­based recreation, researchers report in Monday's online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
"Declining nature participation has crucial implications for current conservation efforts," wrote co-authors Oliver R. W. Pergams and Patricia A. Zaradic. "We think it probable than any major decline in the value placed on natural areas and experiences will greatly reduce the value people place on biodiversity conservation."

Ball State police officer acquitted 
INDIANAPOLIS -A federal jury on Monday found a former Ball State University police officer was not liable for the shooting death of a drunken student. 
Jurors in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis deliberated about three hours before returning the verdict in favor of Robert Duplain. 
Duplain testified that Michael McKinney, 21, of Bedford, charged at him and he fired in fear that McKinney could lunge for his gun. Duplain said he didn't know at the time in November 2003 that McKinney was a lost, drunken college student at the wrong address. 
The 24-year-old rookie officer had been sum­moned to a residence after the student began pounding on a stranger's back door.

Republicans, Democrats make last push toward unpredictable Super Tuesday 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Buoyed by cheering crowds and bolstered by more than $1.3 million a day in TV ads, Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton raced through the final hours of an unpre­dictable Super Tuesday campaign across 22 states. The Republican raee turned negative on the eve of the busiest day in pri­mary history. 
"We're going to hand the liberals in our party a little surprise," boasted Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, criticizing John McCain for his positions on tax cuts, gay marriage and immigra­tion and predicting an upset win in delegate-rich California. 
McCain struck back a few hours later Monday with a television ad that showed Romney in a 1994 debate against Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, saying he was "an independent during the time of Heagan­Bush. I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush." 

Outwardly, McCain pro­jected confidence, not only about wrapping up the nomination but about November's general elec­tion as well.

She questioned the media's emphasis on Hillary Clinton's sexuality and Barack Obama's race. 
"I think it is an empirical and political mistake to reduce the current rivalry between Clinton and Obama to 'sex ver­sus race'," Littaucr said Monday. 
Littauer focused on a recent survey eondueted by CNN where reporters asked black women in South Carolina whieh factor, race or sex, was a more important influence on their votes. 
"I would like to hear more from both candidatns about ... timn-tnstnd I>nmocratie issues" J.ittauer said, suggesting that undun emphasis was being placed on superficial qualitins rather than the real issues at hand, such as education, healthcare, welfare, immigra­tion and poverty. 
She echoed the angry senti­ments of some South Carolina women who stated that black women could vote based solely on issuns just as white men could. 

"Tho Obama-Clinton divide soems more determined by gn1wration than by race or sox," Littauer said, citing the captivation many younger vot­ers havn with Obama while older voters lend to trust Clinton's expertise.

"The Democrats are very closely tied in the margin of error," Arnold said, indicating that both Clinton and Obama still had good chances of win­ning the nomination after Tuesday. Arnold also recognized the proportional distribution of delegates in mos.t Democratic primaries, meaning both ean­didates could walk away from some states with support. He said there was a greater chance the Hepublican nomi­nee would be known, espe­cially due to John McCain's perceived popularity in the Western and larger states and the "winner takes all" delegate distribution policy adopted by Hepubliean pri­maries.  Marler, who took his first food poisoning case in 1993, during the Jack in the Box E. coli out­break in the Pacific Northwest that sickened hundreds and killed four children. "Bill was certainly at the right place at the right time entering the field of food safety litigation," says Caroline Smith DeWaal, who is in charge of food safety at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. "I see him in kind of a private attorney general role." Marler, 50, operates three dozen Web sites dedicated to food-borne illnesses. He is a tire­less blogger on all things food safety and appears in front of federal and state lawmakers and regulatory boards. The license plate on his wife's Volkswagen reads ECOLI. In all these cases, Marler has gone to trial just onee, winning a $4.6 million verdiet against a Washington state school district  which has about 1,000 active cases in all 50 states. The clients typically pay their lawyers 25 to 35 percent of their settlements. The targets of Marler's law­suits include the Topps Meat Co., which recalled 21.7 million pounds of its hamburger patties in September -the second­biggest U.S. beef recall ever -then went out of business. When Cargill Inc. recalled 840,000 pounds of beef patties the follow­ing month, it brought more law­suits by Marler.

IN BRIEF 
U.S. factories see rise in demand 
WASHINGTON -U.S. factories saw demand for their products rise in December by the largest amount in five months, a spot of wel­come news that failed to change the picture of an economy struggling to stay afloat. 
The Commerce Department reported Monday that orders placed with U.S. factories rose by 2.3 percent in December. That was an improvement from the 1. 7 percent gain posted in November and marked the biggest increase since July. 
The performance in December was slightly better than the 2 percent rise that economists were forecasting. 
Still, Richard Yamarone, economist at Argus Research likened the December uptick to "a candle in the hurricane." 
On Wall Street, stocks slid. The Dow Jones industrials lost 108.03 points to close at 12,635.16. 
Orders for "durable" -big-ticket goods, such as cars, that are expected to last at least three years -rose by 5 percent in December, up from a 0.5 percent advance in November. 
Bush's budget proposal creates deficit 
WASHINGTON-The record $3.1 trillion budg­et proposed by President Bush on Monday would produce eyepopping federal deficits, despite his attempts to impose politically wrenching curbs on Medicare and eliminate scores of popular domes­tic programs. 
The Pentagon would receive a $36 billion, 8 percent boost for the 2009 budget year beginning Oct. 1, even as programs aimed at the poor would be cut back or eliminated. Half of domestic Cabinet departments would see their budgets cut outright. 
Slumping revenues and the cost of an economic rescue package will combine to produce a huge jump in the deficit to $410 billion this year and $407 billion in 2009, the White House says, just shy of the record $413 billion set four years ago. 
But even those figures are optimistic since they depend on rosy economic forecasts and leave out the full costs of the war in lraq.shopping season. That was down sharply from a 1 percent gain in November. It was the weakest performance in this area since a similar 0.2 percent rise in June of last year. 


Yahoo to 'take time' reviewing bid 
Struggling Internet company considers unsolicited $41 billion offer from rival 
Associated Press 

SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp.'s $41 bil­lion takeover bid appears to have backed Yahoo Inc. into a corner, leaving the struggling Internet pio­neer with the unpleasant choice of selling to a detested rival or pursuing other agonizing alterna­tives likely to require the help of an even fiercer foe, Google Inc. 
At least that appeared to be the consensus emerg­ing among analysts Monday as Wall Street awaited Yahoo's response to last week's unsolicited offer from Microsoft. 
Yahoo says its board is going to take its time reviewing Microsoft's bid along with other options that could keep the Sunnyvale-based company independent. 
"At the end of the day, I don't think they are going to be able to turn down Microsoft," predicted tech­nology investment banker Peter Falvey of Revolution Partners, echoing a widely AP

Super Bowl sets viewer ratings record 
NEW YORK-The 97.5 million viewers who saw the New York Giants' last-minute win over the New England Patriots made it the most-watched Super Bowl ever and second biggest event in American television history. 
Only the "MASH" series finale in 1983, with 106 million viewers, was seen by more people, Nielsen Media Research said Monday. Sunday's game eclipsed the previous Super Bowl record of 94.08 million, set when Dallas defeated Pittsburgh in 1996. 
This year's game had almost all the ingredients Fox could have hoped for: a tight contest with a thrilling finish involving a team that was attempting to make history as the NFL's first unbeaten team since 1972. 
But the Giants ended New England's bid for perfection, 17-14. Throughout the game, the teams were never separated by more than a touchdown. 
"You might like your equation going in, but you still need some breaks going your way," said Ed Goren, Fox sports president. The closeness of the game probably added a couple million viewers to the telecast's average; the audience peaked at 105.7 million viewers between 9:30 and 10 p.m. EST ­during the fourth quarter. 
Giants quarterback Eli Manning won bragging rights over his broth­er: Last year's win by Peyton Manning's Indianapolis Colts was seen by 93.2 million people, now the third most popular Super Bowl. Manning was set to appear on David Letterman's "Late Show" on Monday, but travel delays in Arizona pushed his appearance back to Wednesday. 
An eye-popping 81 percent of all TV sets on in the Boston area Sunday were tuned in to the game. In New York, the audience share was 67 percent. 
There were signs even before game time that Fox could be headed for a record. The opportunity for a team to make history with football's first 19-0 record was a powerful draw. The Giants and Patriots also had a tight contest in late December that drew strong ratings. 
The Giants' underdog run had also captivated the nation's largest media market, making up for the only potential weakness in the event as a drawing card: the lack of geographi­cal diversity in the competing teams. 
There were past Super Bowls with higher ratings, topped by the 1982 game between San Francisco and Cincinnati (49.1 rating, 73 share). That indicates a larger percentage of homes with televisions were watching the game. But since the American population has increased, along with the number of people with TVs, the actual number of peo­ple watching this year was higher.

Aftp,r today, we might have a clear idea of which two candidates will be running f()r president in their respective parties. I hope we find, now or in the coming weeks, a strong candidate who can lead us out of Iraq, because this 
war is killing us. 
By "killing," I do not mean the dam­age the war does to our international image or the billions or tax dollars we spend on it. And I say "us" in reference 


to the military troops James Dechant 
from our own fami­
lies and communi­

tiP-s, too often rele­Foregone 
gated to an alien Conclusion sphere of society, too seldom conceived of as our neighbors and friends. What I mean is that soldiers from our own communities are killing themselves as a dirnd result of their time spent, at our government's behest, in Iraq or Afghanistan. 
Hecent statistics from the Army show that suicide rates among American sol­diers havn skyrocketnd in the past five years. Two thousand one hundred U.S. sol­diers tried to commit suicide in 2007, nearly six attempt<; every day. Back in 2002, before the Iraq War, there· were 350 suicide attempt<>-less than one a day. That six-fold increase over five years has given the Army it<> highest suicide rate among active soldiers since 1980, when such record keeping began. Traditionally, suicide rates are actually lower during periods of overseas deployment, which is part of what makes the rise so striking and unconscionable. 
There are soldiers our age -perhaps you know at least one -who go to Iraq and return to fmd their lives waiting to be resumed where they left ofl'. Only they, themselves, are irrevocably changed. Their egos splintered, their reflexes razor­sharp, their adrenaline systems unable to shut down, soldiers who faced combat find themselves experiencing hallucinations, 
sexual impotency and a loss of ability to 
communicate. They are haunted by 
depression and flashbacks and find even 
previously-stable relationships dif11cult to 
maintain. 

Failed personal relationships are the most common motive for military suicides. Troops are being sent back to Iraq for their second or third consecutive tour of duty {extended to 15 months by the Pentagon last year) with little rest in­between. Our· armed services thrust them back into the hell of combat, often f~tiling to diagnose their true aflliction: post-trau­matic stress disorder. Many times psyehia­trist<; diagnose soldiers with pre-existing personality disorders instead-meaning they were already troubled before their servicn and their involvement in the war had nothing to do with their eurnmt psy­chological condition. 
Several scandals havn bnen doeumented involving military offieers rnqmlsting such diagnoses, eommanders unwilling to sacri­fice pot1mtial troops with resources already stretched so thin. Ollicers also dis­courage seeking out eare in the first place, cultivating a machismo stigma against the "weakness" of psychological support. With time at home stint1~d and aid services unwilling or unable to help them cope with the horrors of war, is it any wonder troops have trouble sustaining relationships? 
Ever since soldiers began returning from combat, officials have lamented the severely under-equipped mental health services of the military. Some efforts have been made by commissions and Congress to improve the care given to returning sol­diers. President Bush highlighted the need to help our troops in his State of the Union address. Senator Jim Webb of Virginia introduced new legislation last Thursday aimed at improving the military's suicide prevention programs. 
Such calls for aid draw attention to the problem, but actual improvements require more than money. There is no corps of psychologists waiting in reserve to aid returning and active soldiers. Lowering the suicide rates will requirn a new stance 
on the way we treat soldiers -whieh 

might, I suggest, involve not going to war 
in the first place. 

Disputing the war's justifieation and debating the meril'> of continued military involvement, however, only addresses the military care issue obliquely. The suicide rates among troops will remain inextrica­bly tied to our involvement in Iraq, of course. but the problem has unfortunately become it<; own distinct crisis. 
Suicide rates among military members are still lower than oquivalent demograph­ics among civilians, yet more and more soldiers are turning to suicide. Our nation ignores this problem not just by prolong­ing the war in Iraq -though that is cer­tainly hurting-but by failing our troops in the earn we ofliw them. Put simply: Our highest authorities, civilian and military, have !~tiled our troops when they nnednd the eountry's help. We have sacrificed our values and rnorden~d our priorities. The nnnd to maintain military prnsenen has superseded eoneern filr the individual sol­dier. 
I want a candidate to emerge today who will make commitment to the mental health of' our troops a key platform issue. This needs to lw at the f(Jrelhmt of the elnction season. It gons beyond anti-war messages or sehemes to bring troops home. Even if the prnsident ended the war tomorrow, we would sen the effed.s on sol­diers for years. We need a dear plan to help those soldiers who gave so much, a path to recovery for our friends and rela­tives. 
We need more than a way out of Iraq ­we need a way forward for our troops.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Lent is upon us, and we have a mar­velous opportunity to improve how we approach the greatest problem that humanity has ever faced. 
According to climate experts, the world is on the brink of catastrophic climate destabilization if action is not taken immediately around the world to reverse the rate of carbon emis­sions which contribute to the green­house gases that promote climate change (see the reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; watch "wonderingmind42" on YouTube). Climate destabilization will bring about·more death and destruc­tion than we can imagine, hitting the poorest nations and peoples first, and profoundly affecting the survival of most if not all planetary life forms. Two of the major causes of green­house gases in the United States are animal feedlots (supporting our meat­eating habits) and coal-fired power plants, one of which Notre Dame has. 
Transpo trouble 
Many students rely on the Transpo trolley to get from Notre Dame to Saint Mary's College. Personally, I don't care how late it's running when it's transporting partying girls on weekends, but I rely on it for class, and I know many others do as well. I understand that inclement weather can cause delays, but in recent weeks the trolley has become completely unpredictable. It might stop at Regina Hall at 8:40a.m., or it might be there at 8:59 a.m.(as was the case this past week). Both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's are largely pedestrian campuses with notoriously inconven­ient parking. Since no pay service (other than a taxi) exists to transport students between campuses for class, I believe it is the responsibility of the schools to ensure that some semblance of a schedule is maintained. I'd be willing to pay 50 cents per ride if! knew the trolley would get me to class on time. I know many students, Saint Mary's and Notre Dame alike, who feel the same way. Come on, Transpo. Get it together. 
Kelsey Robertson sophomore Regina Hall Feb. 4 


Sports over kill 
This past Sunday evening, from about 6 to 10 p.m., I found myself in front of the TV watching the Super Bowl. Joining me were an estimated 105 million Americans who watched at least part of the game. With the U.S. population at about 300 million, that means that roughly 35 percent of Americans watched at least some of this event, plus millions more who heard or read about it. Football may be the most popular spectator sport in America, yet taken together with baseball, basketball, auto racing, soccer, hock­ey and a myriad of other sports, we get a clearer picture of a national obsession. One begins to wonder how much time the aver­age American spends watching, reading, talking or thinking about sports in a given week. And of course, Americans are equally crazed over playing sports, working out and staying in shape. I will say it now: There is nothing wrong with playing sports, exercising or watching a sporting event. Playing sports makes one healthier, builds teamwork and sharpens the mind. And watching sports is a cultural practice that builds camaraderie, creates unity and pro­vides excitement. And let's face it, playing and watching sports is really a whole lot of fun. 
But we're reminded of that ancient adage, "Everything in moder­ation." Sometimes when a good thing is pursued to excess, it becomes a bad thing. That is what I suspect may be occurring in the lives of millions of Americans who have made sports their No. 1 concern. Sports should be an important part of most people's lives, yet one would be hard-pressed to argue that it should be the primary priority. Perhaps all of us at Notre Dame and in America need to step back for a moment and assess what our values really are. It has been suggested that our priorities should include, "God, country, Notre Dame." To these, I humbly add family, friends and our professional and school commitments. Simply put, it has been shown too many times that whenever we invert these priorities, the results are disastrous. Sports are a lot of fun, but let's not make a sport out of life. 
Chris Spellman

A call to conserve 
The times encourage us to trivialize the effects that one person or institu­tion can have on the world. When problems are complex, multivaried and overwhelming, we can fall prey to the deadly sin of acedia-callousness, indifference and apathy towards moral and spiritual excellence. In set­ting its sights too low, acedia becomes a sin against charity. 
Adopting a deep commitment to the common good, we at Notre Dame would review our practices, changing those that contribute to climate change. We would do everything in our power to decrease our carbon footprint individually and as an insti­tution. Notre Dame would use some of its endowment funds to move the cam­pus towards use of wind power and carbon neutral energy; build bicycle paths for constituents to get to cam­pus; promote vegetarianism at least occasionally (to reduce those feedlot effects) and vigorously support educa­tiona! and research initiatives to meet carbon neutral goals. And we would act with urgency -the window of opportunity is quickly shrinking. Such moves require vision, courage and perseverance, not only of Notre Dame's leaders but of us all-stu­dents, faculty, staff, alumni. 
Concretely for all of us it means fig­uring out how to restructure our lives so that how we live uses less energy (e.g., walking instead of driving across campus to a meeting, eating less meat, turning off power switches when not in use, unplugging vampire appliances that use energy when plugged in). This is not an individualistic venture, it requires us to work together, encourage one another and even call each other to account. Together we must share the burdens of changing lifestyle on every level -individual, community, institutional. 
Lent offers us an opportunity to practice reducing our gluttonous con­sumption of the earth's limited resources. We can practice new habits that lessen the cost of our lives for those elsewhere who chop down their rainforests for us and poison them­selves and the earth for our floral bouquets. 

Now is the time for the whole of the Notre Dame community to individually and communally adopt policies and practices that fulf1ll our moral quest to bring about the greater good. Whether the Notre Dame community takes the heroic path of leadership is up to you -to us, and our passion for goodness. The call to discipleship has never been stronger. The cost of ace­dia has never been greater. Life on the planet is at stake.

By STEPHANIE DePREZ 
Scene Writer 

On Sunday night, years of hard work culminated in an epic smack down between the titans. 
Of commercials, that is. 

Once again, the greatest advertising campaigns came together for a battle royal with the prize being that ever-elu­sive trophy, the consumer. Some watch for the football. some for the half-time show, but most everyone can agree the Super Bowl just isn't super without a rally of all the best commercials the industry rulers can bring. 
Budweiser brought its best game, with a series of commercials involving the abnormal effects of its beer, and why the magical beer is no longer available. 
Car companies went head-to-head, as Audi, GMC and Hyundai came on to the field with a take-no-prisoners approach. The Hyundai Genesis went 
all-out, with the narration surrounding 
style shots of the car announcing, 
"We're not sure what the USA Today Ad 
Meter will think of this commercial 
tomorrow, but we're pretty sure 
Mercedes, BMW and Lexus aren't going 
to like it very much." (Apparently no 
one did. It came out number 43 of 55 in 
the USA today rankings. which were 
published Monday.) 

The ultimate goal of any TV ad is, of course, to get your attention. This. is accomplished in a number of ways, the most obvious one being comedy. This -year's ads certainly didn't lack laughs, but many other tricks were pulled out 
to grab viewers' interest. 

The most jarring ad had to be for 
Careerbuilder.com, and it involved a 
woman's heart popping out of her 
chest, walking up to her boss and hold­
ing up a sign reading, "I Quit." The odd 
beginning ended up being a call to 
"Follow Your Heart," as the throbbing 
and astonishingly anatomically-correct 
heart bounced out of the office and 
started walking away. 
The No. 1 USA Today pick was a sen­timental favorite. Hank the Clydesdale reigned supreme by not only success­fully training to be a Budweiser horse to the Rocky theme (with the help of a Dalmatian). but also by wining the hearts of football watchers everywhere. This ad came relatively early in the game, but came out on top as the best commercial of the Super Bowl. 
Second place went to the disturbingly oversized carrier pigeons for FedEx. 
A screaming squirrel that looked sus­piciously like one of at Notre Dame wailed as he clutched his acorn, and he and his panicked forest friends took third place for Bridgestone. 
Fourth place went to the mouse with a passion for Doritos. This delightful number was set to the eternal "Habanera" from Carmen. A man came home and set a trap for the mouse using a crumb from a_ Dorito. He sits down and bites into a handful of cheesy chips as a human sized-mouse breaks out of the wall and begins to punch him. Classic humor, really. 
Overall, this year's presentation was­n't bad. GMC Yukon takes home the tro­phy for lamest commercial, with its naked stencil-drawn headless man pushing a circle up an incline as the narrator muses on about dreaming. pushing, changing and all the deep questions that he can think of. (We still have no idea what this has to do with the car.) 
Gutsiest commercial had to be the one for godaddy.com, with Danica Patrick unzipping her shirt and a voice telling you to go to the Web site to see the rest (with viewer discretion advised). 
Other highlights include Will Ferrell selling Bud Light, men falling for an ugly woman because she smells like Planter's Peanuts, and parade floats duking it out for a giant Coke bottle.

Texas Tech coach Bobby Knight is congratulated by his son, Pat Knight, following his team's win over New Mexico State on Jan. 1. Knight resigned Monday as the winningest coach in major college basketball history with 902 career wins. 
Knightunexpectedly resigns frolll TexasTech 
Associated Press 

LUBBOCK, Texas -Bob Knight resigned Monday at Texas Tech, a stunning midseason move by the winningest men's coach in major college basketball. 
"He said he was tired and that it was best to go ahead and do it now," Texas Tech chancellor Kent Hance told The Associated Press. "I think Bob is through with coach­ing. I think he got to the point where it wasn't fun for him." 
Known as much for his fiery temper as his basket­ball brilliance, Knight gave no hint a change was com­ing. He will be replaced by his son, Pat, a Red Raiders assistant. 
The 6 7 -year-old Knight informed Texas Tech ath­letic director Gerald Myers of his decision in a meeting around noon, Hance said. Knight then called Hance and told him. 
"He thought about it Sunday all day and talked to his wife and decided 'This is something I want to do,"' Hance said. 
The Red Raiders beat Oklahoma State 67-60 on Saturday, giving Knight his 902nd victory. 
Knight was not available for comment Monday, said Randy Farley, a spokesman for the Texas Tech basketball program. 
The Lubbock Avalanche­Journal first reported the resignation. 
In September, Knight signed a three-year con­tract extension that runs through the 2011-12 sea­son. In 2005, Pat Knight was appointed his father's successor. 
Bob Knight has 902 career wins, more than any coach in the history of Division I men's basketball. Win No. 900 came last month against Texas A&M. 
Knight arrived at Texas Tech in March 2001, six months after being fired by Indiana for what school officials there called a "pattern of unacceptable behavior." 
In his first six years at Tech, he led the Red Raiders to five 20-win sea­sons, a first at the school. They are 12-8 this season. Texas Tech's next game is Wednesday night at Baylor. 
Knight passed former North Carolina coach Dean Smith as the winningest Division I coach Jan. 1, 2007, getting career win No. 880. To celebrate the milestone Knight chose "My Way" by Frank Sinatra, a mantra for how he navigated his personal and professional worlds. 
"Bob is kind of a funny guy. He always loved that song 'My Way,' and this is another example," Hance said. 

IN BRIEF Judge rules to let Vick keep
$20 million signing bonus 
MINNEAPOLIS -Jailed quar­terback Michael Vick can keep nearly $20 million in bonus money he received from the Atlanta Falcons following a rul­ing Monday by a federal judge. 
The Falcons sought to recover the bonuses after Vick pleaded guilty to federal charges in a dogfighting operation. The bonuses were paid from 2004­2007. 
A special master ruled in October that the Falcons were entitled to recover the bonuses. The Falcons argued that Vick used proceeds from a contract he signed in 2004 to finance his illicit activities. 
But U.S. District Judge David Doty of Minneapolis ruled that the Falcons' recovering the bonus money would violate the NFL col­lective bargaining agreement. 
Harkleroad, Davenport
lead U.S. to Fed Cup semis 
SAN DIEGO --Move over, Lindsay Davenport, and make room for another star on the U.S. Fed Cup team. 
Shaking off nerves, 22-year-old Fed Cup rookie Ashley Harkleroad rallied from a 4-1 deficit in the second set to beat Germany's Sabine Lisicki 6-4, 7­5 on a picture-perfect Southern California day to clinch the quarterfi­nal match on Monday. 
Harkleroad's victory followed Davenport's 6-1, 6-2 win over 19­year-old Julia Goerges in reverse sin­gles, sending the United States into a World Group road semifinal in April against defending Fed Cup champion Russia, which most likely will be led by Maria Sharapova. 
The United States finished 4-1 against Germany after Davenport and Lisa Raymond won the doubles 6-2, 6-0 over Tatjana Malek and Anna-Lena Groenefeld. 
Granderson signs five-year
deal to remain with Tigers 
DETROIT-The Detroit Tigers could have kept Curtis Granderson around for a while, retaining his tal­ents with one-year deals until he became eligible for free agency after the 2011 season. 
The Tigers, though, don't just wait around to make moves these days. 
Granderson and baseball's busiest team agreed Monday to a $30.25 million, five-year contract that includes a club option for 2013 that could make the deal worth up to $43.25 million. 
"The Tigers held all the chips and didn't have to do anything," Granderson said. ''I'm very happy with the way everything happened." 
Tigers president Dave Dombrowski is not known to give long-term deals to players before they are even eligible for arbitra­tion, but Granderson merited an exception.

SuPER BowL XLII 

Manning shines on biggest stage 

AP Giants quarterback Ell Manning, left, and defensive end Michael Strahan celebrate after beating the Patriots 17-14 on Sunday in Glendale, Ariz. 
Oft-criticized quarterback leads Giants to victory with a near-perfect, 83-yard TD drive 
Associated Press 
GLENDALE. Ariz. -Oh. well. 
nobody's pnrfeet. Except maybo 
Eli Manning. 
A masterful magician when 
the stakos were highest. 
Manning engineered one of the 
best drives in Super Bowl histo­
ry Sunday to holp the New York 
Giants squash the New England 
Patriots' run at history-making 
perfection with a 17-14 victory. 
In a game. and a finish. that showed precisely why the Super Bowl has become America's favorite spectacle. Manning led the Giants 83 yards in just more than two minutes. He capped it with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress with 35 sec­onds left. to win what easily could go down as the best Super Bowl ever. 
"An unbelievable game and an unbelievable feeling," Manning said. 
"The greatest victory in the history of this franchise, with­out a question," said owner .John Mara. 
It was a scintillating closing ehapter to a crazy week that soemed to have everything: the perfect team; the upstart underdogs; the cover boy quar­terbaek in Tom Brady; the kid brother in Manning. 
America loves an underdog, and the Giants, with their stir­ring vietory, etched themselves as one of the best this game ­or any sport -has ever seen. 
The star was Manning, the scruffy younger brother of Peyton, who won his own Supor Bowl last year, and sat in the corner of a skybox for this one, squirming and agonizing over every play. 
Now both Mannings have a championship and a Super Bowl MVP to their names and Brady -well, he's still got the looks, the supermodel girl­friend, Gisele Bundchen, and three Super Bowl titles of his own. 
With the loss. New England finishes 1 H-1. and the 1972 Miami Dolphins remain the only team to go undefeated from the start of the season through tho Super Bowl. 
Their coach, Don Shula, was on hand. roady to congratulate the Patriots. Instead. he figured to be sippingchampagne, con­
tinuing a tradition the Dolphins 
have enjoyed every year when 
the last undefeated team finally 
gets its first loss. 
"What a great football game 
this was," Shula said. "What I 
learned today was how tough it 
is to go undefeated." 

!lis Dolphins remain alone thanks to Manning, whose 13­yard game-winner came four plays after he escaped a. cadre of Patriots engulfing him, threw the ball up for grabs -how, exactly, did he do that? -and watched receiver David Tyree jump and somehow pin it between his hands and his hel­met for the 32-yard reception. 
That kept the drive going, and it will be Manning's mas­tery that everyone remembers -not Brady's coolly efficient 80-yard touchdown drive moments earlier. 

This game was such a back­and-forth stomach-turner that it seems a great bet to break the record for Super Bowl view­ership (94.08 million) and give the advertisers their money's worth on the $2.7 million they spent for each 30-second spot. 
It might even force the water­cooler conversation Monday to be about football, not commer­cials or halftime shows. 

For the record, Tom Petty did a four-song halftime set, clos­ing, appropriately, with "Runnin' Down A Dream." 
Some highlights on the com­mercial side included Shaquille O'Neal as a winning jockey in a big horse race, Richard Simmons barely avoiding being squished on the highway and Will Ferrell playing a -well ­not-so-lit pro basketball player who also likes beer. 
Funny as those were, the best show was on the field. 
It was a tight, taut defensive battle for three-plus quarters -yet anything but boring. 
Then it was taken over by two quarterbacks -one already a star. the other yearn­ing to escape the shadow his father, Archie, and big brother, Peyton have cast over the fami­ly, and the sport, for many years now. 
Earlier in the week, Eli said it was flattering being compared to Peyton because "he's at the top of his game, and I'm still trying to get my game up to his level." 
Patriots perfect no longer 
With New England's 19-0 dreams derailed, serious questions now arise 
Associated Press 
FOXBOHOUGH, Mass. -The only perfect thing about the Patriots was their record. 
Now they don't even have that. 
Dominant in the first half' of the season, they survived some close calls afterward. But that finally caught up with them in the Super Bowl and loft them facing an offseason of what-if's and what-will bes. 
What if' their offensive line studded with three Pro Bowl players had kept the team's most important player from being knocked down time after time in the most important game? 
Will Randy Moss and Asante Samuel leave'? 
Will Rodney Harrison, Tedy Bruschi and Junior Seau, the three oldest defensive starters, retire? 
And next time, will coach Bill Belichiek hang around until the end of the game instead of head­ing for the locker room with a second left and a security escort Tom Brady would have envied. 
The two-time Super Bowl MVP couldn't elude the steam­rolling pa..<;s rush of the New York Giants the way he does the paparazzi who stalk him on the streets of the city where the new Super Bowl champions will be honored at a victory parade Tuesday. 
Brady was sacked five times in Sunday's 17-14 loss, the most in his 92 games since the New York Jets did that in the third game of the 2003 season on Sept. 21, 2003. 
So the Patriots finished 18-1 and disappointed, not 19-0 and historic. That left the 1972 Miami Dolphins, who were 17-0, as the only NFL team to go unde­feated. 
Brady was a near unanimous choice for the league's MVP and was brilliant in the first eight games of the season. lie was not as good after that. 
His live worst passer ratings came in his last eight games, including the postseason. In the APC championship game against San Diego, he threw a season­high three interceptions. In the Super Bowl, he was uncharae­teristically inaccurate on some passes even when he had time to throw. 
''I'm sure we all could have done things better, but it's just part of competition," Brady said of the devastating defeat. 
New England won three Super Bowls in four seasons before falling short the next thme years -losing to Denver in a divisional playofl' game, to Indianapolis in last year's AFC championship game and to New York in the lat­est disappointment. 
After coming so dose la..<;t sea­son, the Patriots added receivers Moss, Wes Welker and Donte' Stallworth. They signed free agent Adalius Thomas for their aging group of linebackers. And they kept Samuel, designating the star cornerback a franchise player and signing him for one year after he held out for a long­term contract. 
The offense set several single­season records: 50 touchdown passes by Brady, 23 scoring catches by Moss and 589 total points. 
But the season began with off­field problems. 
Harrison, the hard-hitting safe­ty, was suspended for the first four games for violating the league's substance abuse policy. 
After the season-opening 38­14 win over the New York Jets, the NFL lined Beliehiek $500,000 and the team $250,000 and took away a first-round draft ehoice as punishment for videotaping Jets' coaehes on their sideline. 
That only lin~d up the Patriol'i. They were accused of' running up the score in some of their wins. 
But the Patriots shrugged oil' the critieism and kept focusing on the next oppommt. They won each of their first eight games by at lea..'it 17 poinl'i. 
Then the powerhouse that pulled away from opponents began letting them hang around. 
In their ninth game, they beat Indianapolis 24-20 on a touch­down with 3:15 left. In their 11th, they scored the go-ahead touchdown with 7:20 to go but needed two interceptions in the last four minutos to dineh the 31-2H win over Philadnlphia. 
The following week was the greatost of escapes. 
They trailed 24-20 at Baltimore and failed twice on fourth down in the la..'it two min­utes. But the first play wa..'i nulli­fied by a false start penalty against the Patriots and the sec­ond by a holding call against the Ravens. On the next play, Brady threw the winning 8-yard scor­ing pass to Jabar Gaffney with 44 seconds left. 
And, in the last regular-season game, the defense struggled in a 38-35 win over the Giant.<>. 
But how long could their good fortune hold out? 
Not long enough.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Vitale set to return to booth 
ESPN announcer will return Wednesday after Dec. 18 throat surgery 
Associated Press 
Say something. Anything. Just do the very thing that made him famous. 
But Dick Vitale couldn't. Tears welled up in his eyes as he imagined his beloved career crashing to an end. 
Then the doctor suggested he count to 10. And with the simplest of words, Vitale heard his own voice again for the first time in weeks. 
ESPN's hyperkinetic college basketball announcer will call his first game in more than two months Wednesday after recovering from throat sur­gery. It was the cruelest of ailments for the man who yelled his way to becoming a household name. His treat­ment? A ban on speaking. 
"There was a moment there I thought I'd never be behind a microphone again," Vitale said Monday on a conference call, sounding a bit subdued but very much like himself. 
Told he could return to the air in early February, Vitale checked the schedule and found some serendipitous timing: He could make his comeback on the biggest of stages, the Duke-North Carolina game. 
Vitale wasn't allowed to utter a word between his Dec. 18 surgery and a Jan. 13 doc­tor's appointment. And when he got the long-awaited go­ahead, he opened his mouth and nothing came out. 
"I guess I was afraid of what I was going to sound like," he said. ''I'd heard rumors that your voice may not sound similar." 
Viewers might not have noticed anything the last few years, but the 68-year-old Vitale conceded he was "bluffing" his way through games. 
''I'm going to tell you, every game I was a worried, nerv­ous wreck about what was coming out of my throat," he said. 
He was always hoarse; his throat was constantly sore. After many a game, he was on the phone with his boss at ESPN, Dan Steir, crying. 
"That's how really down I was," Vitale said. "I can't go to the game and just enjoy doing the game and be excit­ed about doing the game and not worried about my damn throat." 
He went to several physi­cians, who said his problem was caused by acid reflux. Vitale finally got an appoint­ment with Dr. Steven Zeitels of Massachusetts General Hospital, a specialist who has treated Julie Andrews and Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler. 
Zeitels found ulcers on his left vocal cord and said there was a chance they were can­cerous. 
"That word scares the life out of anyone," Vitale said. 
The news was good: No cancer. Not speaking wasn't so hard, Vitale insisted, which becomes more believable con­sidering complications from the surgery resulted in blad­der problems that distracted him from his original ailment. 
Vitale communicated by 
scribbling notes to his wife, who had to try to decipher his "horrendous" handwriting. 
"I went through so many pens, it was unbelievable," he said. 
Doctors told him it wasn't a coincidence that somebody who puts so much strain on his vocal cords developed problems. Vitale is working with a voice coach to learn to speak more from his diaphragm. ESPN will adjust his schedule so he won't call doubleheaders or games on back-to-hack days. 
Vitale is conscious of avoid­ing traps like talking loudly to try to be heard over the din at a noisy restaurant. His doc­tors will attend Saturday's Georgetown-Louisville game so they can use a device that measures exactly how much of a strain Vitale is putting on his vocal cords. 
But what's going to happen Wednesday if a player goes soaring in for a dunk in the final seconds to send the game to overtime? 
''I'm going to be myself," Vitale said. Himself with the volume turned down slightly. 
"I think I'm going to try to let the microphone do more work," he said. 
For anybody wondering how Vitale will sound Wednesday, he noted he never was as smooth as a play-by-play guy to begin with. 
"I've always been raspy," he said. "Heck, Rod Stewart's raspy, and he makes millions of dollars."

Clemens will face steroid deposition 



Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Not one of Roger Clemens' flat-out denials about using steroids or human growth hormone was delivered while he spoke under oath. Now he gets that chance. 
The seven-time Cy Young Award winner is scheduled to give a deposition to lawyers from a congressional committee behind closed doors Tuesday, one day after his former New York Yankees teammate and workout partner Andy Pettitte delivered sworn testimony for about 2 1/2 hours. 
Both pitchers' private inter­views with staff members from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are part of preparation for a Feb. 13 hearing. That public session is expected to focus on allegations made in the Mitchell Report by trainer Brian McNamee that he injected Clemens more than a dozen times with performance enhancers. 
The 45-year-old Clemens ranks eighth in major league history with 354 career wins. He put off retirement yet again in 2007, returning to the Yankees in June and going 6-6 with a 4.18 ERA. 
"Roger is not going to take the Fifth Amendment," one of Clemens' lawyers, Rusty Hardin, said in a statement e-mailed by spokesman Joe Householder. "He is going to answer the com­mittee's questions truthfully under oath." 
McNamee is to appear Thursday. One of his lawyers, Earl Ward, said no decision had been made on whether he would submit to a deposition or transcribed interview. It is a crime to lie to Congress, whether sworn to tell the truth or not, so the distinction between the two has more to do with the format of the question­ing and the confidentiality of the transcript. 
Pettitte, who chose to be deposed, did not take questions from reporters afterward as he walked from committee offices to an elevator in the Rayburn House Office Building. Wearing a pinstriped gray suit and bright striped tie, Pettitte was accom­panied by his wife and three lawyers. 
"At the committee's request, Andy Pettitte voluntarily met with representatives of the com­mittee this morning, and fully answered all of the inquiries made of him in a sworn deposi­tion," two of Pettitte's lawyers, Jay Reisinger and Thomas Farrell, said in a statement. "Out of respect for the sensitive nature of these proceedings, and out of deference to the com­mittee's request for confidential­ity, we, on behalf of Mr. Pettitte, will not comment on the nature or specifics of his testimony." 
Staff members for the com­mittee declined to comment. 
McNamee told former Senate majority leader George Mitchell he injected Pettitte with HGH. Pettitte lent credence to Mitchell's findings by acknowl­edging two days after the report was released in Decrmber that he did try HGH for two days in 2002 to help deal with an elbow injury. 
The committee announced Monday it will hold yet another hearing Feb. 12, entitled, "Myths and Facts about Human Growth Hormone, B-12, and Other Substances." The commit­tee said medical experts will testify about the effects of such substances. 
A former Yankees teammate of Pettitte and Clemens, Chuck Knoblauch, spoke to committee staff Friday. The day before, an employee of the sports agency ­that represents Clemens and Pettitte went to Capitol Hill to be interviewed. 
McNamee said he injected Clemens with HGH and steroids in 1998, 2000 and 2001. Clemens has repeatedly and vig­orously denied that, including in a recorded television interview and a live news conference ­as well as through his lawyers. Clemens did acknowledge he received injections from McNamee, but he said they were for vitamin B-12 and the painkiller lidocaine. 
When Mitchell testified at a committee hearing Jan. 15, he was asked whether he was still comfortable with McNamee's credibility. 
"We believe that the state­ments provided to us were truthful," Mitchell said. 
McNamee also said he acquired HGH from former New York Mets clubhouse employee Kirk Radomski for Knoblauch in 2001 -and McNamee said he injected Knoblauch with HGH. Radomski pleaded guilty in April to federal felony charges of distributing steroids and laundering money. He is sched­uled to be sentenced Friday, then speak to committee staff on Feb. 12.

Hawks rebound from slow start to top 76ers 
Magic's Turkoglu picks up triple-double in loss to Mavs; Heat suffer 32-point loss, their 19th in 20 games 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Just when it 
senmed Philadnlphia might have 
an nasy timn with Atlanta, Josh 
Smith gave tlw Hawks a Jill and 
gavn the 7(HH"S something to 
think about. 
Smith blocknd six shots in the 
sn1:ond quarlnr. giving t.lw 
llawks monwnturn that c.arrind 
tlwm to a 96-91 win over tho 
l'hilad1dphia 7(~trs on Monday 
night. 
lin had ·19 points. nine assists 
and ninn block.-;, and his big snr­
ond quarter lil'tnd thn Hawks 
from a misNabln start. 
"Josh chang~~s tlw gamn with 
his blocked shots," said 7hnrs 
c.oac.h Mauricn ChPPks. "When a 
guy has ninn blocked shots it 
l'hanges tlw game dramatically. 
Jo:ven whnn lw donsn"t block a 
shot he has guys thinking about 
it when thny shoot, and that can 
mess up your oll"!msivn rhythm." 
The 76nrs outseored the 
llawks 15-0 on fastbrnak points 
and outrebounded Atlanta 23-5 
to take a 32-14 lnad in the first 
quarter. Smith's sncond-quarter 
rojeetions lin~d up thn llawks, 
who outscored the 76m·s R2-59 
in the final thren periods. 
"Josh got rnally aggressive, just really mado his presence 1"1dt in the paint," said Hawks cnntnr AI llorford. "lin changed thn gamn for us eomplntely. lie was carrying us in the second quartor." 
Smith and the othm starters 
struggled whiln falling behind by 
20 in the first quarter. 
"I understand when I came 
back in I had to change the 
game on the defensive end," 
Smith said. 
"When you block a couple of shots, it makes them second­guess shots." 
Smith, second in the league with 3.2 blocks per game, matched team records with the six blocks in the second quarter and eight in the first half. 
"It felt great just to come over and help my teammates," Smith said. "Some of them turned into fast breaks." 
Added Hawks coach Mike Woodson: "He changed the whole game. It's a shame that we put that kind of pressure on him.... We just have to lock in and take the individual chal­lenge to guard the ball. That's what we weren't doing, and he was covering up a lot of our mistakes." 

Smith also had four steals and six rebounds in the game. Smith's career high is 10 blocked shots as a rookie against Dallas on Dec. 1R, 2004. 
Josh Childress scored 21 points and Joe Johnson added 1 R for the I Iawks. 
Atlanta led 91-8R before turn­ing the ball over on an ofl"ensive foul by Horford with 1:20 left. Philadelphia rookie Thaddeus Young, a Georgia Tech product making his i"irst return to Atlanta, missed on the other end, and. a basket by Horford pushed the llawks' lead to live. 
!!orford then blocked a shot by Andre Miller, who scored 29 points. 
"AI Ilorford makes a great block on Andre Miller at tho ond, which was huge," Woodson said. "lin held his own and made the block and secured the ball. That was pretty much the gamn right thern." 
The llawks set a season high with 14 blocks, inducting two by Horf'ord. 
Andre Iguodala's three-point play with 19.5 seconds to go cut Atlanta's lead to 94-91, but Smith answered with two free throws. 
lguodala had 22 points. Young added 11 and Willie Green had I0. Samuel Dalembcrt had nine points and I J rnbounds. 
Tho Uwrs' big narly lead did­n't last long. The llawks outscored tlw 76ers 30-18 in the sn1:ond quarter to trail only 50­44 at halftime. 
Tho qukk turnaround stunned tho 76nrs. "I wish I could tell you what happened." said Dalombert. "It was two games," Cheeks said. 
Johnson's 3-pointer with 4 seconds left in thn third put Atlanta in front 72-70 heading into tho final quarter. 
Tlw llawks led 87-79 in the fourth but the Sixers answered with two baskets by Miller and a 3-pointer by Iguodala to close the lead to R7-R6 with 3:45 left. 
A drive by Johnson with 1:53 Iell pushed Atlanta's lead to 91­RR. 
Mavericks 107, Magic 98 
Coming off their worst per­formance of the season, the Dallas Mavericks got some extra practice in before playing the Orlando Magie on Monday night. 
It paid oil" with a win in which Dallas led from tip to buzzer. 

"We didn't want to leave any­thing in the gym tonight," Mavericks coach Avery Johnson said. "That's why I brought 
them to the gym at the last  
minute  for  a  quick  
shootaround."

Dallas overcame Hedo Turkoglu's first career triple­double -13 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds -and 28 points from Dwight Howard. But Howard, the NBA's rebounding leader averaging 15, had only seven, and Orlando was outre­bounded 47-34. 
The Mavericks led by 13 at the end of the first quarter, and by as many as 19 in the first half. 
"We have to learn from this as a young group, coming to the last 25, 30 games before the playoffs," Turkoglu said. "Hopefully we'll try and be a stronger team." 
Orlando cut it to 83-80 on Rashard Lewis' 3-pointer with 
7:15 left, but the Magic went scoreless almost 5 minutes after that. Dallas rang off a 10-0 run to put the game away. 
The loss snaps a four-game winning streak for Orlando. The Mavericks, which had lost two straight, closed a four-game Eastern Conference road trip 2­2.

Women's hOckey ties Northwestern in home finale 
Special to the Observer 
Despite playing most of the final period down a player, Notre Dame still managed to hang on to a 2-2 tie against Northwestern. 
The Irish were called for three defensive penalties in the third period and played most of the period down one man. Playing a strong penalty kill throughout the game, Notre Dame still riddled the net with shots, including a frantic rush at the end of the game when the Irish hit the pipes twice. 
Notre Dame scored first in the middle of the opening peri­od with a heads-up play by first-year player Tess Ryan. 
Northwestern answered in the closing seconds of the first period when the Wildcats rifled home a point-blank shot. 
Irish senior Casey Bouskill ,deflected a shot from senior Kara Brennan for a goal in the second period, but the Wildcats again answered on a power-play goal. 
Sophomore Megan Aimola registered 28 saves in her first game in goal for the Irish. 
Irish captain Kara Brennan summed up the emotions at the conclusion of the club's home season. 
"It's been a great four years of hockey, and it's really hard to see it end," Brennan said. "We're all looking forward to going out with a win next weekend in Chicago." 

Notre Dame's final game will be on Feb. 9 against the Frozen Snappers -a club team from the northern sub­urbs of Chicago. 
Women's Water Polo 
Notre Dame made a splash in East Lansing this weekend, winning its season opener in a tournament held at Michigan State. 
The Irish beat Illinois 11-4 Friday in their first game. Cristina Romano and Bridget O'Neill led the scoring with three goals apiece and Kristen Harchut had two. 
Saturday the Irish secured a quick 14-1 win over Lindenwood, with goalkeeper­turned-field-player Betsy O'Neill scoring a total of six goals. Goalie Maggie Hyde was solid, allowing the only Lindenwood goal on a late fourth-quarter floater. 
The second contest of the day pitted the Irish against a different kind of opponent ­the Chicago Area Water Polo club, a team made up of tal­ented high school players. Notre Dame won 10-5 with Horner leading the Irish offense with four goals. Betsy O'Neill returned to the goal for this game and recorded ninP saves. 
In the tournament champi onship game Sunday, the Irish needed overtime to beat Michigan, 5-4. The low-scor­ing game favored Michigan's style of play, and with three minutes to go in the game the Irish trailed 4-2. 
A pair of quick goals by Horner and Durkin tied the game and forced sudden death. 
On a crucial man-up oppor­tunity, Kennifer skipped the winning shot by the Michigan goalie, ensuring the Irish vic­tory. 
Ultimate Frisbee 
Notre Dame's A-team advanced to the quarterfinals in the 22nd annual Mardi Gras tournament before falling to Texas 14-12. 
The A-team was seeded No. 15 out of the 60 men's teams competing in the tournament. In its first game of pool play Saturday, the team came out slow against Minnesota and lost, 11-7. Although Minnesota gave it plenty of opportunities, Notre Dame failed to capital­ize. This gave the team plenty to adjust before its next game against Georgia Tech. 
Against the Yellow Jackets, Notre Dame fixed the mistakes and pulled out an 11-10 victo­ry, its first of the season. The win set up a third game against Wisconsin B. which the Irish won 15-8 thanks to the handling of junior Thomas Rivas. 
In the final pool play game of lhe day, the Irish faced North ; exas to determine seeding going into bracket play on Sunday. Notre Dame beat North Texas 11-5 after a fast start. The Irish came out firing and jumped on the Mean Green early with great defense from grad student Steve Kurtz. 
The A-team opened with a 
solid 13-9 victory over Wisconsin-Whitewater in the round of 16. The win advanced Notre Dame to the quarterfinals against national power Texas. The Longhorns were also coming off of a tough battle in the round of 16 and were slow to start the game. 
Notre Dame capitalized and .took an 11-9 lead thanks to great cutting from sophomore Andrew Schroeder. Texas, however, went on a late run to clinch the win. 
The Irish B-team lost to Texas A&M Sunday despite strong play from Shea Bettwy. Notre Dame defeated Truman State but lost to Iowa State Saturday, 13-8. Although freshmen Patrick Kozak and Tom Banaziak displayed good cutting speed, the Irish lost to Memphis. They managed to beat Texas-Arlington 13-11 in Saturday's final game. 
Ski 
Joel Sharbrough took first in slalom and finished in the top three in the giant slalom. Freshman Justine Murnane led the women's squad with top three finishes in both events as well. The team will compete this coming weekend at Crystal Mountain, Mich.

but our conlidenee has grown and we've been making shots and that just grows," Ayers said. "Everyone just has eonli­dence in us." 
Ayers showed that eonlidence in Notre Dame's overtime win over Providence on Thursday. In overtime, Ayers stepped up and drilled a three from the top of the key to give Notre Dame a five-point lead on its way to victory. 
"lAyers! has been playing with a little bit of a chip on his shoulder, which is very scary for opponents when a talented guy like Ryan Ayers is playing with a ehip on his shoulder," llillesland said. "I think it was kind of the reaction the eoaeh was looking for with the move." 
llillesland netted 10 points against DePaul, ineluding an eleetrifying baseline slam, but hasn't limited his offensive potential to driving and seoring in the paint. Against Providence, llillesland attempt­ed, and drained, a eouple of mid-range jump shots. 
"We just know that we have to attaek and pick our spots when they're there and eer­tainly we're always talking to !coach Breyl about being aggressive with our selection, to keep attacking and take care of the ball," lliffesland said. "We know that we need to con­tribute and take pressure ofT of guys like (forward! Luke lllarangodyl. or if [guard! Kyle IMcAlarnoy'sl not having a good shooting night." 
Against Providence, McAlarney f"inished with only eight points, but llillesland and Ayers stepped in to give the Irish a shot in the arm, combin­ing for 17 points. In Notre Dame's two Big East losses to Georgetown and Marquette, the only other times opposing defenses held McAlarney to 10 points or less, Hillesland and Ayers tallied 10 points com­bined in the two games.

"They have fit in pretty well," Bayliss said. "You can't ignore them, they are very talented. Of our eight starters, four of them are freshmen. They have definite­ly established themselves." 
With their loss coming to the No. 1 Virginia on Jan. 22 at home, Bayliss still said the team is untested. 
"We will see how they han­dle it if the ranking falls," Bayliss said. "We'll see if' their perception changes."

But llillesland and Ayers' effectiveness isn't only meas­ured in points. The 6-foot-9 llillesland and the 6-foot-7 Ayers make for tough defend­ers, especially at the top of Notre Dame's 1-2-2 zone where they can use both their size and quickness to thwart shot attempts. 
Offensively, Hillesland can create mismatches against taller defenders with his ability to drive and dish, while Ayers has taken the ball to the hoop over the past few games more than he did earlier in the sea­son. 
"They're highly important," Irish guard Tory Jackson said. 
Roth, the Irish have a strong No. 1 doubles team in senior Sheeva Parbhu and junior Brett Helgeson. "They return as well as anyone in the coun­try," Bayliss said. "They sometimes break down at net, but have made great improve­ments. It will be interesting to see how the rest of the season plays out." 
Junior Santiago Montoya has also been a mainstay in the lineup for the first time this spring. Montoya has been playing with freshman Tyler Davis at No. 3 doubles. 
Bayliss said the team is deeper than last year. Montoya and sophomore Sean Corrigan traveled with the "They are two of the most important players in the Big East to me. They both play with two different styles, but they are two of the best players out there."

By KATE GRABAREK Sports Writer . 
On a team with six fresh­man, one has separated him­self from the pack. 
Freshman Stephnn Havens has distanced himself from the five other freshmen on this season's squad. Havens and Andrew lloth made up the No. 4 doubles team for the early part of this season. 
"The doubles have been playing really well." coach Bobby Bayliss said. "They make a lot of balls, and have responded well. I am pleased with them overall." 
Roth has been a pleasant surprise for the Irish this sea­son. lie battled eye injuries early in his career and has stepped into a leadership role, Bayliss said. 
"He has a determined work ethic," Bayliss said. "He is a lot more accountable on the court. lie has a big heart, and can do a lot of things. lie will make his opponents work. While Stephen is pretty placid on court, Both is more fiery." 
Aside from Havens, the rest of the freshmen have made their presence felt.

BYU presents chance to rebound 
By DAN MASTERTON 
Sports Writer 
Road-weary No. 12 Notre Dame begins its home sched­ule today against No. 54 Brigham Young after losing two or its first three matches on the road. Notre Dame (1-2) looks to win two in a row over the Cougars (2-4) after win­ning 5-2 last season in Provo, Utah. 
Notre Dame's 4-3 loss to Michigan last Thursday did not sit well with Irish coach Jay Louderback, but the team has had five days to recover and prepare for BYU. 
"We just didn't play well at Michigan," Louderback said. "Friday was so dose to the loss that everyone was still down. We had a better practice Saturday. I'm looking for [Monday] to be another good one to get everyone ready." 
In addition to the time off, coach Louderback is happy to be home. 
"It's been tough to beat us here. We definitely need to play at home," he said. "We had three in a row on the road to start. and I was hoping we'd be at least 2-1." 
Their match at Michigan helped prepare the Irish for BYU. 
"Playing at Michigan, their courts are faster, and they hit the ball fast and hard," Louderback said. "So playing BYU will be an advantage for us because these teams play similar." 

The Cougars' strength is their doubles play. Both the No. 1 team of Anastasia Surkova and Jennifer Miccoli and the No. 2 pair of Dolly Chang and Kristina Doerr are 4-0 for the dual season. 
"We lost the doubles point [to BYUJ last year, and they have the same team coming back," Louderback said. "They're tough and hit the ball big, so we'll work on doubles more lin practice on Monday I to get ready for them." 
Junior Kelcy Tefft leads the Irish, coming off a strong showing at Michigan. Louderback was pleased with her performance.
