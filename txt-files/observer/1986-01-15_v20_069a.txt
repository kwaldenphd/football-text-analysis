Parents sue Osbourne, point to lyrics 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -The parents of a teen-ager who shot himself to death 14 months ago have filed suit against singer Ozzy Osbourne, con­tending their son was influenced by song lyrics about suicide. 
John Daniel McCollum, 19, allegedly was listening to an Osbourne album titled "Speak to The Devil" when he shot himself Oct. 27, 1984, with his father's .22 caliber pistol. Two of the album's songs, "Suicide Solution" and "Paranoid" refer to suicide. 
"It is my opinion those songs had a direct correlation in John's death," attorney Thomas Anderson said at a news conference Monday. 
The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court last October on behalf of Jack McCollum and Geraldine Lugenbuehl, contends the young man followed the lyrics of "Suicide Solution," which say, "Where to hide, suicide is the way out. Don't you know what it's really about?" 
Anderson said Osbourne and CBS were sued "to teach them a lesson. It is our hope that the case­as a result of applying California law-will make parents aware of what's in these records." 
Osbourne, formerly with the group Black Sabbath, would not comment on the suit, said a spokesman at Jensen Communica­tions who refused to give his name. 
CBS Records Group would have no comment because the matter was in the courts, spokesman Robert Altshuler in New YOrk said Monday. 
Jack McCollum told reporters his son was drinking the night he died. 
"But I don't believe he had a pro­blem with alcohol," he said. "His suicide came as a total surprise." 
Lee Snellings, deputy Riverside County coroner, said an investiga­tion indicated the young man did not seem to have any problems, was well-liked and gave no indica­tion he would take his life.

Logan Center volunteers show understanding 
There is a group of students among the halls of Notre Dame that I consider super students. They may be well prepared for all their classes and get remarkably good 
' 
grades, but beyond this they are unique. 
They are unique because they volunteer their 
time at Logan Center. The students provide 
many developmentally disabled children and 
~ 
adults friendship which they might not have otherwise. The time and effort that the students put in should not be overlooked, but the appreciation and companionship that they show toward their handicapped friends should be applauded. 
Patrick Burgess 
guest column 

-------~-------­
· This program also involves the cooperation of Saint Mary's and Indiana University at South Bend, and has been working for a number of years. Rocky Blier, the great run-
r 
ning back for the Irish, was a member of the 
r 
r group when he was a student. In fact, his roommate, Dan Harshman, is now the ex­ecutive director of Logan. There have been a 
f great number of concerned students over the years who have been instrumental in the con­tinuing development of handicapped peo­ple's lives. These students are providing an invaluable 
r 
service for handicapped people. It takes a special person to give of himself or herself especially when the benefactor cannot let his appreciation be truly heard in conventional ways. It is a real pleasure for me to serve with such fine students. 
As a member of the volunteer group, it is very exciting for me to share time with han­dicapped people. Also as· a person with a handicap myself, 1 share a special feeling of happiness and joy that such a program ex­ists. It is for me a time of fun and compa­nionship with other people who do not have obvious handicaps. It is very important for handicapped people to have the ability to receive input from other people. This allows them to view others and the ways they relate to their environment. There is a whole range of concerns facing disabled people, from 
maintaining relationships to knowing how to relate to their jobs or school situations. They need to see how other members of society react in similar situations so that they can Jearn from their behavior. Handicapped people want to Jive a life that allows them the creativity to make a better tomorrow for themselves. The ke to unlocking that is be­ing involved with other people of different abilities and backgrounds. The students in­volved are instrumental in providing that aspect of learning for the handicapped. 
As a member of the volunteers, I find it hard to get across to some of the new volunteers that I am here to help, and not to receive services. Unfortunately there were some that did not listen. I find it very dif­ficult to communicate that in spite of my speech impairment, I have normal mental capacity. The same holds true for many mentally handicapped people. Many people assume mentally handicapped people cannot perform everyday tasks like making their beds or washing their clothes, when in fact they possess the ability to lead perfectly nor­mal lives. Many mentally impaired people can live alone or in a situation with some supervision, and have the ability to find gainful employment. Unfortunately, however, many people have been misinform­ed about handicapped people. I fell into the same boat when it came to misconceptions 

about mentally handicapped people. Even 
though I am physically impaired, I was not 
sure how I should react to mentally impaired 
people. I am glad for this opportunity to 
join the group; it was instrumental in dispell­
ing my fears about mentally handicapped 
people. 

Many people tend to apply certain values like productivity, beauty, wealth or even in­telligence to the handicapped and judge them 
. worthless by comparison. As a result, they 
view them as useless members of society. 
Because people have not had the opportunity to know handicapped people as maividuals, they make these crude assumptions. Many handicapped people are eager to show they indeed can succeed, once given the oppor­tunity. Whether that is in a personal rela­tionship, through college, or on the job, the forum does not matter. All that is asked is that people give disabled citizens a fair chance to achieve their individual ideal of the American Dream. 
The students of Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and iUSB have many things for which they should be proud. Very few college students are willing to accept and assist handicapped people. These students have provided a stimulus for growth and independence among handicapped people that supports and emphasizes the notion that handicapped 
people should be treated like everyone else. Participating in this volunteer program means that students have taken the calculated risk of being rejected by room­
mates and friends because of devotion to the people served. It takes strength to carry on in the face of apathy or even opposition. These students have made a difference and can take pride in what is being done. The community owes them thanks for everything that has been achieved through the faith and conviction that sees handicapped people ac­cepted in our society. They are truly .super students. 


Improper analogy made about apartheid system 
Despite the United States' historical battles with racism, it has ultimately failed to re­sond to appeals by the United Nations and other members of the world community for stronger action against the late South African government. Instead, there is a growing tendency to relate the apartheid system in South Africa to racial discrimina­tion practiced in the United States. 
Patrick Francis 
guest column 

Although there are some similarities between 
the two, the dehumanization of blacks and 
the recent resistance demonstrations, these 
similarities are superficial and do not ap­
proach the heart of the conflict in South 
Africa. 
I would like to present three ways in which 
the two situations differ and the dangers that 
arise from the failure to recognize the dif­
ferences. 
Without detracting from the seriousness of the crimes perpetrated on blacks in the 
Doonesbury 
United States, we must realize the severity of oppression varied between urban and rural areas, most certainly between northern and southern states, and in the phases of life it affected. Racial oppression under apartheid is universal, without variation throughout the geographical regions of the country. 
Secondly, in the United States, at least in principle, the federal government served as a higher authority and afforded the opportuni­ty to appeal segregationist activities. ' Although many of these activities were upheld through the doctrine of "states' rights," discriminatory practices were con­tradictory to the national Constitution and gradually fell down with the dismantling of the doctrine. 
In contrast, racial segregation is grounded in the constitution of South Africa and there is no method of recourse for opponents of apartheid. The relegation of blacks to "homelands," which would remove any last attempts by blacks to participate in the cen­tral political system in the land of their birth, is a manifesto expounded in the constitution. 
The third area of difference is in the com­position of the populations of the two coun­tries. Blacks were a minority in the United States and failed to pose a major challenge over white dominance here. Black claims to citizenship and voting rights did not threaten to reorder the way of life of the white elite. 

By comparison, any semblance of democratic participation in the South African government by the black majority (over 70 percent of the population) would destroy white domination and their privileg­ed lifestyles. This threat produces fear among white South Africans which calls for measures to ensure that blacks remain out­side the political structure. 
Failure to recognize the true nature of the conflict in South Africa can lead to wrong conclusions. President Botha insists no com­promise is possible on the issue of full black participation in the central power structure. Statements relating to the positive aspects of black authorities working in the townships fails to recognize these structures for what they really are -a mere creation and tool of the white regime to give a false legitimacy to the policy of separation. These authorities serve no legitimate representative purpose. 
The acceptance of this invalid relationship between past United States practices and the current situation in South Africa has Jed some to argue that the modifications of "pet­ty" apartheid, such as allowing interracial marriages, are a sign of serious reform pro­cesses initiated by the Botha government. Consequently, they call for "constructive engagement" with this "reformist" regime. In actuality, these modifications make no at­tempt to dismantle the abhorrent system of apartheid. 
Those who accept the analogy between the conditions in the United States and South Africa fail to realize that even if it were true, the struggle undertaken to dismantle our own forms of segregation did not progress through constructive engagement with segregationists. Economic pressures and courageous resistance were only a part of the struggle. It is unlikely to take any less to destroy apartheid in South Africa.

The Friars shot 61 percent from the field and 76 percent from the line, but that was not enough to overcome a 28-14 Irish rebounding edge, as Notre Dame wound up with a hard-fought 78-72 victory to improve its record to 8-1. 
"Providence had some incredible shooting, but we were able to take away their inside game with a zone in the second half," said Phelps. "We played very well the second half." 
The Friars came out hot, shooting nearly 70 percent (16-23) in the first half, but the Irish did not allow Providence even one of­fensive rebound in the first half, while they scored six times on second-shot efforts. 
"We knew only one or two teams have outrebounded Notre Dame the last couple of seasons, but we wanted to attack Notre Dame at the heart," said Friar head coach Rick Pitino. 
Unfortunately for them, the Friars could not keep the Notre Dame brawn off the boards, and the Irish took a 43-39 lead after one half on Donald Royal's layup off 
an  offensive  rebound  with  28  
seconds left.  
Free-throw shooting paved  the  

way for the Irish in the second half. 
Twice the Friars made strong runs at Notre Dame, taking a 45-43 lead with 18:03left, and trying the game at 55 with 11 :29 to go. Irish timeouts at both junctures helped them pull back ahead, although never by much. 
The Irish shot 15 for 19 from the charity stripe in the second half, with guard David Rivers leading the way with an 8-10 effort after going 2-2 in the first half. Rivers paced the Irish with 22 points (6-12 from the field, 10-12 from the line), five assists and four steals. 
Steve Wright made two free throws with 1:05 to go to pull the Friars with three at 72-69, but free throw shooting by Rivers kept the Irish ahead. 
Jim Dolan helped out greatly with seven rebounds and eight points in 24 minutes of action, while Donald Royal also pulled down seven caroms. 
Guard Harold Starks led the Friars with 18 points. -Eric Scheuermann 
ND 77, LaSalle 63 
PHILADELPHIA David Rivers scored 24 points to lead Notre Dame to a 77-63 victory over LaSalle on the first stop of a four­game road trip on Jan. 4. 
The Irish outrebounded the Ex­plorers 40-24, including 14-5 on the offensive boards, to aid in their seventh victory of the season. Chip Greenberg led the Explorers (6-6) with 25 points. 
The Irish got off to a quick start and held a 21-10 advantage with 
10:40 left in the first half on the strength of sharp outside shooting from Rivers and Ken Barlow. The Explorers refused to roll over. With 48 seconds remaining in the half. Explorer Rich Tarr hit a jumper in the lane and was fouled on the play by Irish center Tim Kempton. After converting the free throw, the Explorers trailed by a point. When Kempton missed the front end of a one-and-one, Eric Lee scored on a short jump shot to give LaSalle a 34-33 halftime lead. 
"We forced shots in the first half and didn't play well in the first half," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps, "But we didn't lose it. It was a good test to be down one at halftime and come back and win by 14." 
After trading baskets to open the second half, the Irish switched from a man-to-man to a match-up zone that the Explorers couldn't solve. When Rivers fed Barlow for an alley-oop to give Notre Dame an eight-point lead with a little more than eight minutes gone in the half, the rout was on. Barlow finished with 16 points, while Rivers had eight assists. 
"We didn't lose our composure," said Rivers. "We had a letdown of intensity and that was what we stressed at halftime, to keep up the intensity." ' 
A large reason the Irish kept their composure was the play of the four seniors. Those four, along with Rivers, stayed on the floor for the final 11 minutes as the Irish put the game away. 
"The four seniors played well," commented Phelps. "Their ex­perience let them beat LaSalle. I was pleased with Dolan (eight points, 11 rebounds). Dolan and Price (13 points, 2 rebounds) really did the job. 
On another note, this was freshman Mark Stevenson's first visit back to the P alestra, a court on which he had played while at Roman Catholic High School in Philadelphia. Stevenson played the first 13 minutes of the game and did not score. 
"Mark pressed in the first half," noted Phelps, "but he has played well for us. I've never brought a freshman back home and had him play well. I took Orlando Woolridge back to New Orleans, and he missed three dunks and had 
three  fouls  in  the  first  five  
minutes."

ND 80, Creighton 54 
The Notre Dame men's basket­ball team wrapped up 1985 on a winning note -and accomplished some revenge -with its 80-54 win over Creighton at the ACC on Dec. 
30. It was exactly one year after the Irish had dropped a 60-58 decision to the Bluejays in the Omaha Civic Auditorium to close out 1984. 
Ken Barlow led a balanced Notre Dame attack with 15 points, while guards Scott Hicks, Mark Steven­son and David Rivers netted 10

points apiece. Creighton forward Kenny Evans led all scorers with 25 points, while guard Reggie Morris added 21. 
Notre Dame led by just four at the half, 32-28, but blew the game open in the first 10 minutes of the second half by outscoring the Jays 
25-12 to take a 57-40 lead. Junior guard Scott Hicks scored all 10 of 
his  points in  that stretch  to  key  
Notre Dame's spurt.  
The  Irish  took  control  of the  

boards in the second half, en route to a 34-25 rebounding advantage. 
"We controlled the boards in the first half and in the second half we played with more intensity," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. "We had better shot selection and we just played our game. I was concerned after the layoff (the Irish had not played a game since Dec. 21), but overall I was pleased with our intensity. We did the things I felt we had to do to win." 
"We were very close in the first half, but we didn't connect in the second," said Creighton head coach Tony Barone. "We threw away the ball, but I thought we played pretty well. 
"The key points came from Rivers -he completely changed the game. He's excellent defensive­ly and he has a great ability in pass­ing. Shooting in his range he is very good. He's a bright player, ver -y quick with the ball and I love when a player is willing to give up the ball for his teammates."

ND 98, Valparaiso 54 
After a long layoff for final ex­ams, one might have expected the Notre Dame men's basketball team to be a little rusty in its Dec. 21 game against Valparaiso in the ACC. 
The Irish certainly put that no­tion to rest, however, punishing the Crusaders, 98-54. 
Notre Dame shot 68 percent from the field in the first half while holding the Crusaders to a dismal 29 percent, and led 45-17 at the half. 
The Irish jumped out to a 10-0 lead, with junior Donald Royal scoring four points, before Valparaiso could get anything go­ing. 
"After the layoff I didn't know how we would play today," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. "I wanted everyone to get playing

"I thought we responded very well to the layoff, and we forced them to take bad shots. The shooting in the first half was what impressed me most." 
"The combination of our inabili­ty to get good shots and their abili­ty to get some good shots and make them was the reason for us losing so badly today," said Valparaiso head coach Tom Smith. "Notre Dame shot well and intimidated us." 
Even before the first half ended, Phelps began to substitute freely, giving almost equal playing time to all of the Irish players. Captain Ken Barlow led the Irish with 14 points and eight rebounds, while freshman Mark Stevenson scored 12 and David Rivers scored 10. 
clip and SOL'P 
With the Irish substitutes playing a great deal in the second half of the contest, the Crusaders were able to stay with Notre Dame a bit more. Valparaiso shot 49 percent this half, but still lost the half by a 53-37 margin, making the final score 98-54. 
"We had to say the first half was over and come out the second half and play well," said Smith. "I thought we shot better in the se­cond half but because we played so poorly in the first half, it was too late." 
"In the second half we let up a bit, but that is only natural when we get a big lead," said Phelps. "And the other team hit their shots to get some confidence. We got in­to a good grove. Now we have to get our minds turned from academics and think basketball. I'm just glad we played so well."

Irish up record to 9-2 with 5-1 mark over holidays 
Holtz adds five new assistant coaches to his staff 
By LARRY BURKE 
Assistant Sports Editor 

Five new assistant football coaches joined Lou Holtz' staff during Christmas break, including former Pitt head coach Foge Fazio and holdover Mike StOck, an Irish assistant for nine years under two previous Notre Dame coaches. 
Fazio, who was named to the staff on Dec. 26, will serve as defensive coordinator, while Stock's specific duties will be an­nounced once the staff is complete. 
Other recent additions to the staff include former Stanford of­fensive line coach Tony Yelovich, former Minnesota offensive line coach George Stewart, and former Minnesota wide receiver coach Pete Cordelli. Terry Forbes, defensive coordinator and linebacker coach the last four years at Akron under

head coach Jim Dennison, joined Holtz' staff Dec. 16. Stock, Yelovich, Stewart and Cordelli will work with the Irish of-

fense, while Forbes will join Fazio's crew on the defensive side. Holtz figures to make one more addition on the defensive side before specific duties will be finalized for the en­tire staff. 
The way things are shaping up on the offensive side, Holtz may decide to handle the duties of of­fensive coordinator himself, while Stock would work the offensive backs and Cordelli would coach the wide receivers. Yelovich and Stewart figure to handle the offen­sive line coaching duties. Holtz also has Vinny Cerrato, the former Minnesota recruiting coordinator who was named to the staff on Dec. 9, to help out on the offensive side. 
Defensively, Holtz has veterans George Kelly and Joe Yohto, nam­ed to the staff early last month, to join Fazio and Forbes. Yonto figures to handle the defensive line, 
while  Kelly  works  with  the  
linebackers  and  Forbes  with  the  
secondary under Fazio.  

The 46-year-old Fazio compiled a 25-18-3 record in four years as the Panthers' head coach from 1982­
85. Pitt earned Cotton and Fiesta Bowl bids in his first two seasons. Fazio's 17 victories (9-3, 8-3-1) in his first two seasons matched the best two-year start in Pittsburgh history. 
Fazio took over the head job at Pitt following two separate stops as linebacker coach for the Panthers. He served four years in that post from 1969-72 under Carl DePas­qua, then returned to the job from 1977-81 under Jackie Sherrill, also serving as defensive coordinator

All in all, the time over Christmas break was well-spent for the Notre Dame basketball team. The Irish upped their record from 4-1 to 9-2 and their national rank­ing from 17th to 13th. 
But perhaps more importantly, every player did well enough scholastically to maintain his eligibility for the remainder of the season. 
The period was highlighted ·by victories in three of four road games, including a win over tradi­tional foe DePaul at the Rosemont Horizon. In addition, the Irish were able to extend their winning streak to seven games, their longest winning streak since the 1980-81 season. 
Notre Dame has yet to be re­bounded in a game this season, averaging nearly 12 more rebounds per game than its opponents. 
Sophomore guard David Rivers suffered a bruised knee against Providence on Jan. 7. Although he continues to wear a protective pad over the knee, in scoring each of the last four games, and notched a career-high 28 points Monday night against Brigham Young. 
Up next is always-tough UCLA Saturday at the ACC (2:30 p.m., NBC-TV). The Bruins are struggl­ing this season under second-year coach Walt Hazzard after winning the National Invitation Tourna­ment at the end of last year. 
Here is a complete rundown of the last six Irish games: 
BYU 80, ND 76 (OT) 
Just alongside the Brigham Young campus lies a mountain with the letter "Y" engraved in its side. But while the Notre Dame basket­ball team has climbed many moun­tains this season, the Irish were unable to get over a tough Brigham Young team Monday night. 
The seven-game winning streak of the Irish came to a rude end, 80­76 in overtime, in front of 20,913 came back and tied it. After we won the three on the road, it would have been sweet to get this one." 

Rivers scored a career-high 28 points, converting 16-of-18 free throw attempts. The Irish sophomore had a rough night from the field, however, hitting only 6­of-22 shots, and often was guilty of forcing things as BYU's zone col­lapsed on him every time he tried to penetrate. 
"Our execution wasn't there and I take full responsibility for that," Rivers said. "Their defense was packed in tightly. When the out­side shots weren't falling, I tried to create inside." 
Jeff Chatman, the Cougars' leading scorer with an 18.8 point average paced BYU with 21 points. Center Tom Gneiting added 18 points of his own to aid the BYU effort. 
Jim Dolan, Ken Barlow and Donald Royal all fouled out of the contest as the Irish totaled 29 fouls in the game. Notre Dame previous­ly had not fouled out a player this season until Joseph Price was sent to the bench with five fouls against DePaul last Saturday. 
-JeffBiumb 
ND 70, DePaul 54 
CHICAGO -It took all but 40 minutes for the Notre Dame basketball team to end the frustra­tion of six consecutive losses to DePaul, as the Irish pounded the Blue Demons 70-54Jast Saturday at the Rosemont Horizon. 
"Emotionally, we were just tired 
of losing to DePaul," said Irish 
coach Digger Phelps. "That, more 
than anything else, got us ready to 
play. I thought we played very 
well." 
And it would be hard to pinpoint 
any one player who spurred the 
Irish to the victory, their seventh 
straight, to mark the longest winn­
ing streak since two eight-game streaks during the 1980-81 season. 
This was a team effort all the way. 
lrutially, it was Joseph Price hit­ting from the outside for 10 first­half points. Then, it was Ken Barlow pumping in 16 points in the second half for a game total of 18. And, of course, throughout the contest it was David Rivers, inside and outside, for a game-high 24 points. 
But one doesn't necessarily have to score to contribute. Jim Dolan proved that in grand style, coming off the bench to haul in 11 re­bounds to go along with his four 
points.  
"Jimmy  really  keyed  the  
defense," Phelps added.  
The  fourth  Irish  senior,  Tim  

Kempton (Price, Barlow and Dolan are the other three), also chipped in with six rebounds and four assists as the group assured itself of at least one win over DePaul during their careers. 
The Irish game plan going in was to neutralize the Demons' inside game to force them outside, bank­ing on the fact that DePaul is not a good outside shooting team. That fact was supported when Notre Dame shut down DePaul in the middle and the Demons managed only 21-of-56 from the field. 
"Our guys were trying to push it in, but they usually found five guys in the paint," second-year DePaul coach Joey Meyer said. "But we thought if we could keep Notre Dame under 50 percent shooting, we could win, and we didn't do that (the Irish shot 59 percent from the floor.)" 
-JeffBiumb 


ND 78, Providence 72 
Irish head basketball coach Dig­ger Phelps and his team expected a tough game when they travelled to take on the Providence Friars on January seventh, and tough was what they got.

fans at the Marriott Center on the BYUcampus. 
After struggling with the host Cougars all night, the Irish ap­peared to have victory within their grasp in the closing seconds. David Rivers drove into heavy traffic in the final seconds with the score tied at 63, but was unable to get a shot off. Rivers thought he was fouled. 
Instead, he was called for traveling as regulation time expired. 
BYU took control of the over­time period, at one point pulling in front by six, to up its season record to 6-9. 
"We were flat from the beginn­ing," Irish coach Digger Phelps said. "I thought it was the sign of a great team, though, the way we
