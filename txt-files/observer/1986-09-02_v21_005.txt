Corby's assets sold to brothers 
MARILYN BENCHIK Copy Editor 
The assets of CTI, Inc., the parent corporation of Corby Tavern, are being sold to Thomas and Robert Przybylinski for $75,000, according to James Brad­ley, the attorney represent­ing the corporation. 
The ruling that allows CTI to sell these assets was determined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in South Bend on Friday. 
The sale of the assets was finalized in order to in­clude the sale of the Alco­hol and Beverage Permit. said Bradley. 
Before the Przybylinski brothers can set up the restaurant-tavern busi­ness, they need a variance that will allow them to by­pass a city ordinance which prohibits two alcohol es­tablishments to operate within 1000 feet of each other.

Environmentalist group plans to sue Pentagon in dispute 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -An environ­mental activist group is pre­paring to sue the Pentagon to stop defensive biological war­fare research while simulta­neously establishing a fund to encourage scientists to dis­close evidence of illegal ex­periments. 
The Foundation on Eco­nomic Trends, successful in a similar suit against the Army, also has distributed a position paper to officials from more than 55 foreign governments, suggesting ways to strengthen a 1972 in­ternational accord banning the pursuit of biological weapons. 
Delegates from more than I 00 countries are scheduled to meet in Geneva next week to review the 1972 accord. 
The postion paper disputes the recently outlined position of the Reagan administration on the 1972 Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention. The position of the adminis­tration is that the convention must be recognized as criti­cally deficient and unfixable. 
The Washington-based re­search organization has focused its studies in recent years on developments in bi­ological and genetic engi­neering. The group describes itself as a clearinghouse for public information on the po­litical, economic and environ­mental implications of such research. 
The lawsuit against the Pentagon, a copy of which was provided to reporters in advance of its filing in U.S. District Court today, seeks to stop all Defense Department research aimed at identifying potential defenses against bi­ological weapons. 
Under the 1972 agree­ment, the United States, So­viet Union and more than I00 other countries have agreed not to develop toxic biologi­cal agents for offensive pur­poses. But the accord does not prohibit defensive re­search. 
The foundation's suit asserts that the Defense De­partment has expanded de­fensive research to sucll a point that it now falls under the National Environmental Policy Act, meaning environ­mental impact studies must be performed. 
It requests both prelimi­nary anti permanent injunc­tions against continued re­search until environmental impact studies are con­ducted.

Field goal gives Terps 10-7win 
Associated Press 

PITTSBURGH · Dan Plocki kicked a 29-yard field goal with 2: I 0 to play and Maryland rode a dominating defense to a I 0-7 college football victory last night over Pittsburgh, ruining the debut of Pitt Coach Mike Gottfried. 
Pitt drove to the Maryland 38 in the final minute. But quarterback John Congemi, who completed 23 of 45 passes for 258 yards, was dropped for a nine-yard loss on a third down-play and threw a fourth-down incom­pletion to turn the ball back over to the Terps. 
The loss continued a string 
of frustration for Gottfried, 
who also failed to win in his 
first game in three previous 
coaching assignments. 

Congemi, contained for 
three-and-a-halfquarters by a 
big-play Maryland defense, 
rifled a 32-yard scoring pass 
to Reggie Williams on a 
second-and-15 play with 5: 12 
to go to rally Pitt to a 7-7 tie. 
Pitt had failed to score in 
the first half despite a 
thirteen-and-a-half-minute 
edge in time of possession, 
as junior kicker Mark Brasco 
missed field goal attempts of 
41, 29 and 53 yards. 

· Tommy Neal, who had 
given Maryland a 7-0 lead 
with a 1-yard scoring dive 
midway through the third 
quarter, had runs of 14 and 
five yards, and Dan Henning 
hit Ferrell Edmunds for 13 
yards and Azizuddin Abdur­
Ra'oof for 15 to set up Plocki's 
winning kick. 

Maryland's first score came 
after a turnover. 

Pitt running back Charles 
Gladman fumbled at the end 
of a 32-yard pass play when 
he was drilled by safety 
James Brown, and linebacker 
O'Brien Alston recovered at 
the Maryland 45. 

The officials had initially 
ruled that Gladman was down 
before fumbling, but 
reversed their ruling after a 
conference. 

Henning, playing his first 
game as a college quarter­
back. hooked up with Vernon 
Joines on a 24-yard comple­
tion on a third-and-6 play to 
the Pitt I. Neal leaped into the 
end zone two plays later, with 
2: 15 to play in the third quar­ter. 
Cubs eliminated inNLEast 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO -Denny Walling hit a two-run double and Jose Cruz had a solo homer to highlight a four-run sixth in­ning yesterday, leading the Houston Astros to a 6-4 victory over the Chicago Cubs. 
The loss eliminated the fifth-place Cubs from the Na­tional League East race. 
Billy Hatcher opened the sixth with a single, extending his hitting streak to I I games, and Craig Reynolds 
drew a walk off Ed Lynch, 4-4.

Roommates win NVA biathlon

Sports Writer 
Sophomores Tom Doyle and Chris Petillo, roommates at Grace Hall, teamed up to win the third annual Non Var­sity Athletics-sponsored biathlon Sunday morning at St.Joe Beach. 
Doyle doubted the two would have competed to­gether if they had not been roommates. 
Petillo swam half a mile across St.Joe Lake and back, and Doyle ran two miles around the beach in a time of 2 I :33, the best time for both two-person teams and indi­viduals. 
Senior Tom Doyle did both the swimming and the run­ning in 22:53, placing first in the individual competition and third overall. 
This was the first year NVA had allowed two-person teams to compete in the biathlon. A total of 21 individ­uals and four teams partici­pated.
