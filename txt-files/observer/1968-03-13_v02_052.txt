New Highrise Dorm Plans Unveiled Construction to Start in Late April 

By JOHN KREIS 
Plans for the two highrise new dorms for which ground will be broken in late April were discussed last night at a dinner meeting at the Halfway House. Attending were Vice President for Student Affairs Rev. Charles McCarragher CSC and Vice-Pres­ident for Business Affairs Rev. Jerome Wilson CSC, Student Bo­dy President-elect J. Richard Ros­sie, Student Hall Life Commis­sioner appointee Larry Landry and members of the New Dorm Study Committee headed by sen­ior Jim Barr. 
Father Wilson announced that the University has no intention of building off-campus apart­ments, and that the problems of housing graduate students on campus with respect to drinking and women's hours were never thoroughly considered. 
Fr. McCarragher said that "the committment to a residential university has been made by Notre Dame." He expressed the opinion that students who apply JPB to Notre Dame should realize this. Rossie questioned the feas­ibility of a total residential uni­versity in 20th century America

Wilson unveiled the floor plans of the new dorms stating that the two would hold 1076 stu­dents; with the completion of the third dorm 1500 students will be' housed there. Each dorm will have a small meditation chapel on the ground floor and none of the rooms which are air conditioned will be equ­ipped with sinks since it is be­lieved it will make the room a little cleaner. 
Jim Barr spoke about the cost of carpeting the dorms; he used Fisher hall as an example where he calculated it would cost $1500 per floor for a rug that will last 7-8 years. 
Revisions are being made from Rev. Michael Murphy's letter to Fr. Hesburgh dated Feb. 6, 1967 concerning the estimates of over­crowded conditions on campus. At that time Zahm was the most overcrowded followed by Dillon and Cavanaugh. 

Wanted: Scholastic Boss 
Applications for the position of editor-in-chief of the Schol­astic are being accepted by Rev. Charles McCarragher, CSC, vice­president for student affairs. 
Applications must be made in triplicate and should be re­ceived by Fr. McCarragher's of­fice by Mar. 25 and the new editor will be selected by a board consisting of Prof. Frank O'Malley, Rev. O'Neil, CSC, and retiring Scholastic editor Mike Mcinerney. The editorship is open to any undergraduate, and Fr. McCarragher has announced that next year's editor and as­sistant editors will re.ceive no stipend from the university. 


Two Jobs 
ND sociology professor Dr. John Kane has been appointed chairman of St. Mary's College's sociology department. Dr. Kane will continue his association with the Notre Dame department which he chaired from 1953 to 1963. A specialist in the area of the Family, Intergroup Relations and Deviant Behavior, Dr. Kane has published four books. 
Including an income state­ment and a balance sheet, Mur­phy has requested Godbout to prepare a prospectus of future financial expenditures of the class. Minton plans to use the entire $1200 surplus on hand right now in financing Senior Week activities. Senior prom needs will be taken care of by the monthly $450 received from the new Senior Bar. 
for various papers. 

Mrs. Mary J. Matz, advisor to the Crux, announced that four SMC juniors have been ap­pointed to a joint editorial board to head the paper. The four students are Mary Farnam, Betty Dickson, Nancy Carlin, and Kath­
leen Garrity. Farnam ·will act 
as editor-in-chief of the board. 
The other three girls will be 
associate editors. 

Two Notre Dame seniors have been named 1968 Danforth Gra­duate Fellows. Thomas Brislin, a Collegiate Scholar government major from Dallas, Pa., and Wil­liam Reishman, a theology major from Charleston, West Virginia, are among 125 of the nation's graduating college seniors receiv­ing Danforth Fellowships to pre­pare for caners in college in teaching. 
Named among the 400 Dan­forth nominees receiving Honor­able Mention were Dennis Gal­lagher, Robert Heineman, and Michael Ryan. Gallagher from Oswego, New York, and Ryan of Allentown, Pa. are English Majors, and Heineman is a gener­al program major from Conners­ville, Indiana.

Committee Hears Law on Parietals 
By TIM O'MEILIA 
The Student-Faculty Committee on 
Student Life learned Mon. that the state of Indiana. does indeed have a lascivious conduct law, but the question still re­mains whether or not the law applies to 
the University dqrmitories. 
The committee requested the opinions of two lawyers, Law School Professor Thomas L. Shaffer and University lawyer William N. Farabaugh on the question of whether parietal hours would violate any state laws. 
Student committeeman and Howard Hall President Gordon Hunt said "the law referred to boarding houses, hotels and homes which the owner knows are being used for prostituion or for im­moral purposes." Hunt said there was a problem as to whether the dorms can be classified in the same category as hotels, boarding houses, and brothels. 
He said he doubted whether the Uni­
versity could be included under the lav. 
since it does not knowingly allow pros­
titution or immoral behavior. 
Committee Chairman Rev. Charles I. McCarragher CSC, vice president for stu­ldent affairs said, "There is a lascivious 'conduct law but whether it could be applied to the University is another ques­tion." Fr. McCarragher also said the law was vague as to the "immoral con­duct" clause and the categorization of the University as a boarding house. The lawyers quoted several cases but "lawyers don't like hypothetical cases," and the question still remains open, according to 
I Fr. McCarragher. 

Hunt also said, "in the case of any 
trouble the University could be held responsible if the offended party could prove negligence as the situation is now." Dillon Hall President Vince Terlep said, "It would be more advantageous to have 
parietal  homs  in  the  event  of  a  suit  
because  the  University  would  be  less  
liable."  
Hunt  also  said  that  no  matter  who  

makes the rules or enforces them, the students or the Administration, if they are not enforced properly the University is responsible. 
The lawyers also said that it is uncon­stitutional for the guards to enter a student's room unless there is reasonable evidence that some University or state laws are being violated, according to Terlep. However Hunt said there was a question as to whether a guard has the right to enter a room if the student re­fuses him admittace. 
The bills passed by the General As­sembly are due to come before the committee at the next meeting. Hunt says that when the parietal hours bill comes up that the students will at­tempt to get a clarification of University President Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh's rationale. Hunt is particularly interested in determining if Fr. Hesburgh 's argument is primarily based on the moral conscience. 
Hunt says they hope to have a good argument to oppose the rationale when the bill is presented to the Board of Trustees in May. 
It was also determined at the meeting that the contract signed by the student on his application form for admittance to the University is not actually binding. 



DyCHRISWO§Eenate Passes Sherry's Judiciary Bill 
The Student Senate passed motions Monday night concern­ing a Student Judiciary and the "Charlie Brown incident", and heard reports from several stand­ing committees. 
Jon Sherry presented a bill which calls for "a student judi­ciary which shall enforce all rules and regulations which per­tain directly to the good order of the student community of this University". He said that at present the judicial system was "An organ of the administra­tion", and should be extended to include enforcement of stu­dent rules, as well as those of the University. 
A friendly amendment pro­posed by Sorin Senator Richard Storatz was accepted by Sherry. It called for the appointment of two campus senators and a stay senator to present the bill to Vice-President for Student Affairs Rev. Charles McCarragh­er, C.S.C. within 14 days. In the case of its rejection by Father McCarragher they would testify before the Senate giving Fr. Mc­Carragher's rationale for rejec­tion. 
The debate on the matter was mostly concerned with whether the bill should be reported back to committee. Jack Powers of the Student Affairs Committee said that the bill should be more specific, and moved that the bill be returned to committee for discussion among Sherry, com­mittee members, and adminis­tration figures. His motion was defeated by voice vote, and Sher­ry's original motion then passed easily. The Students appointed by SBVP Tom McKenna to see Father McCarragher were Sherry, Bob Rigney, and Tom Duffy. 



Mike Kelly of Breen-Phillips action against Charlie Brown, whose YCS sponsored speech in the Law Auditorium, Feb. 15, was broken up by police. Brown 

was arrested for not having his draft card in his possession. He was released after a night in the St. Joseph's County Jail. The police had been called to the auditorium by Dean O'Meara of the Law School, and had appar­ently misunderstood Father Mc­Carragher when they were trying to ascertain whether permission to use the auditorium had been given. 
The motion called the action 

"A high-handed attempt to stifle free speech and peaceful assem­bly on campus and an incredible discourtesy to a guest of the stu­dent body." A part of the mo­tion which called for "censure" of Dean O'Meara was strengthen­ed on a friendly ammendment of Richard Storatz to read "Con­demn". , 
The Senate heard a report on a planned student television show by Jim Geagan, and granted a request for $1 00 for the Ben­gal Bouts.

St. Mary's SBP Election Today 
Therese Ambrusko, candidate for Student Body President, and Sally Stroebel, candidate for Vice-President, are Badin Hall bookies' choices for election in 

 SMC's student body office race. Running on an undeclared ticket Ambrusko and Stroebel are welt known on campus through their work as officers for the Class of '69. During the 12-day campaign, they have spoken to small groups of students on every floor of the dorms on campus, a technique allowed this year through the lifting of campaign restrictions. 
Suzanne Smither, Ambrusko's opponent, has spoken on several floors, and has been the only can­didate to publish campaign litera­ture, a four-page flyer explaining her platform. Smither is not as well known as the other candi­dates because of her one year absence last year while studying in Anger, France. Her association with Student Government has been as president of the Free University.

worked as a senator this year. The candidacy of both she and Smi­ther has been disadvantaged by thier last minute declarations of candidacy. 
In order to vote students are required to attend speeches given by all of the major candidates in O'Laughlin Auditorium at 1 :00 pm today. The polls are open from 2 to 7 9m. The speeches 
remain the deciding factor for many students' votes. 
In  an  open  forum  Monday  
night  in  the  Social Center  stu­ 
dents  were  provided  an  oppor­ 

tunity to confront candidates on the issues. Sixty-five students and eight candidates showed up. 
Ambrusko and Stroebel have depended on small hall meetings to gather support. Their only lit­erature has been hundreds of orange and pink posters displayed around campus. Smither has used blue ribbons, posters, and her fly-er. 
St. Mary's election campaigns are held on a much smaller scale than Notre Dame's campaigns. Up to this year no candidate was allowed to spend more than five dollars on her campaign. Cam­paigns are run on a personal, friend-contact level. No St. Mary's 
Student Body President is made in a week. She is elected over a period of three years.

Editor: I really hate to gripe, but "in the best interests of journalistic accuracy" and for the benefit of your readers-especially those in Badin, Sarin and Fisher-! feel I must clarify some points con­cerning the STAY HALL story, printed on page 6 of Friday's issue. Contrary to the stay hall story printed Friday, absolutely no de­cisions have yet been made­either by the Student Govern­ment, Father McCarragher, the Administration, or the Hall Coun­cils-concerning the switch to Stay Hall this spring. The process which Mike Jor­dan's Stay Hall Committee will follow will be this: 
I) Accumulating reports from the Hall Councils as to the de­sires of the individual hall and a report on the physical capacity of the hall. 
2) Establishing a "quota" sys­tem for the distribution of next year's I ,500 incoming freshmen. 
3) Final publication of the minimum requirement quota for each hall in coordination with the Office of Student Accounts, based on points I and 2. 
The Stay Hall Committee will have the individual hall reports filed by next week. Until then, absolutely nothing can be done. 
The meeting with Father Mc­Carragher last Thursday was strictly for planning purposes and for gaining the necessary co­ordination between the Student Government and the Adminis­tration. 
One last point of clarification: neither the Stay Hall Committee nor myself expect any "trouble" with various halls on the stay hall plan. The plan has gained approval of the student commun­ity as a whole and it has the sup­port of student government and the administration. For any indi­vidual hall to attempt to block 
. the plan would be a slap in the face to the rest of the campus. We fully expect the plan to be adopted in a spirit of complete cooperation and understanding­on the part of all concerned. 
Sincerely, Mike McCauley 
The following letter was received in response to the current alum­nus magazine. 
Dear Sir: 
Lt. JAMES EMIL PAVLICEK, 
'65. Another life squandered in 
the Great American Adventure 
in Southeast Asia. I don't rem­
ember a PAVLICEK from my 
tour at Notre Dame, so I can't 
claim to mourn him. But maybe 
those who do remember him; 
who knew him; who liked him; 
who taught him; who loved him; 
maybe one of those who knew 
JAMES PAVLICEK will accept 
his death as a shock treatment, 
cut off his own daily anaesthetic 
shot of mindless patriotism, and 
begin to wonder what the car­
nage is really all about. Only then 
can it be said that JAMES PAV­
LICEK's death was not all in 
vain. 
I assume he was prepared to 
meet his death, trained to kill

After that title, the rest of the 
"review" is superfluous -"a

your unthinking, uncritical atti­
tude towards an institution so 
in need of a thorough examina­
tion. That irresponsible, shrugg­
ing attitude, especially on the 
campus of a major university, 
only contributes to the over­
development of our military mus­cle and encourages the kind of Administration thinking, now al­most a reflex, which jumps at military "solutions" as soon as our adolescent foreign policy fails diplomatically. 
With respect to the "review"

The second phase attempted to discover what made some children in the slums normal re­garding motivation to accept jobs and receive education.

ces of this action are bound to be severe -for most, army life would be softer and shorter. And the political consequences are vexingly problematic -I myself indulge in a profound and daily-justified pessimism about 
the resurrection of the national conscience. Personally and poli­tically, a bad bet, but in these times it's about all a decent young fellow can do for open­ers.

Dear Sirs, 
I cannot help but comment 
on Mr. Lungren's letter on Rich­
ard Nixon in Monday's Observer. 
It provides first of all an insight 
into the changing perspectives 
of Mr. Nixon and secondly an 
insight into the galloping para­
noia which seems to characterize 
the "forces" of the right on this' 
campus. 
I have a great deal of respect 
for Richard Nixon. He has had 
the courage to be in the arena, 
to fight for what he felt. to be 
right. In addition, Mr. Nixon is 
a man of enormous experience 
and sound judgement. His posi­tions reflect this, and hence re-· fleet a change in recent months on such subjects as Vietnam and the cities. The columnists Evans 

d N k tl t d th t N~ o~a .redcend yb repo~ e a _IXon IS 111 ee ~coi?111g con­v111ced that escalation IS not the answer and that the war cannot be won. As to the cities, Nixon has not given us the same "let's kill 'em" garbage coming out of the statehouse in Sacramento. He has sought to formulate pro­posals bringing private enterprise to bear on the ghettos. However we must remember,
' . 

as Mr. Lungren evtdently does not, that Richard Nixon was sounding the cliches about "law 
, . and or~er relatively ~e~ently, and takmg a hawk posthon on the war. He has changed subtly, and, I believe, honestly. He is still open to criticism, though, from those who doubt the change and those who recall the past. Men such as Mr. Lungren should 
not take violent opposition ev­
ery time someone points out the facts of life as to the "Old Nixon." 
Mr. Lungren's assaults on the veracity of Mr. Figel are another matter. I heard our campus Nix­on chairman also make some rather unpleasant cracks about the Observer Sunday night in the Library Auditorium. It seems obvious that Mr. Lungren, out­maneuvered in every aspect of the delegate and publicity strug­gle so far, is resorting to the old tactic of claiming there is some 
sort of plot against him. This will certainly alienate people dur­ing the convention, but that's Nixon's problem. What is clear, though, is that every time a story is run on McCarthy in this paper 
Dr. George Shuster cally studying narcotics, has col­
or LBJ pictured in the butl it beco~es part of a well-organized conspiracy of takeover. The Rea­gan people wouldn't even show up at delegates meeting Sunday 
"ght b "Ch k N d ~ ecause uc . au an, his people_ h_ave _take.n tt over or some stmtlar 111amty. I would suggest that Mr. tun­gren quit insulting Mr. Figel, that Reagan's backers quit spreading rumors, and that the campus conservatives get out of their 
sandbox. Come on, fellas, learn how to use a mimeo machine. T hi · O'Sh F" d

Editor: 
I have just finished reading 
Mr. Schwartz's article, "We Got 
No Trouble", and I must say I 
am highly incensed. 
Mr. Schwartz calls this refresh­ing piece of nonsycophantism "revolution in a sandbox." I have no idea of Mr. Schwartz's ideals, but it seems to me that he thinks a bit too much of himself and too little of what makes a socially­minded person tick.
