Thousands flee East Germany for the West 
Associated Press 
PASSAU, West Germany ­Crammed into sputtering sedans and cheering their new freedom, thousands of East Germans reached the West on Monday in a historic exodus permitted by the reform­minded Communist government in Hungary. 
More than 2,000 refugees had made the journey from Hungary to Austria and then West Germany by midmorning, with hundreds more streaming in later in the day. News re­ports said the total could top 10,000. 
"I decided on escaping 27 years ago, and today it worked. It's a feeling that's just tops, just wild," said a 40-year-old Leipzig man after crossing into West Germany at Passau. 
Single people, couples and families with children and ba­bies made the journey from Hungary to West Germany ­by bus, rickety sedans or mo­torcycle. 
"We did not really plan to come here, but when we heard about the opening of the (Hungarian-Austrian) border, we decided this was a chance," said 20-year-old Volkmar Windt, who crossed into West Germany on a small East German-made motorcycle along with his twin sister, Katrin. 
Many refugees were cheering and shouting as they reached Bavaria under the blaze of tele­vision lights, while their chil­dren played with teddy bears handed out by relief workers. Couples kissed in their cars. 
Some tumbled out of compact cars packed with people and jubilantly flashed victory signs

University receives grant for bioengineering center 
Special to the Observer 
A science initiative grant of $500,000 has been awarded to the University of Notre Dame's Center for Bioengineering and Pollution Control by the Kresge Foundation over the sum­mer. 
The grant was made on a challenge basis to aid the University in raising a per­manent endowment for the future maintenance and up­dating of the center's facili­ties. 
Full payment of the grant is contingent on the raising over the next two years of $2 million for the research center, according to Michael Kenahan, Notre Dame's di~ rector of foundation and corporation relations. 
The Kresge Foundation is an independent, private foundation created by the personal gifts of Sebastian Kresge and is .not affiliated with any corporation or or­ganization. The foundation's Science Initiative program was established last year to encourage institutions to improve or replace needed laboratory equipment. in­strumentation or facilities. 
The Center for Bioengineering and Pollution Control was established as a cooperative enterprise of the University's Co . .of Engineering. and S...· . e. Its multidisciplinary research and teaching make use ofre~ cently developed technologies to examine contemporary environmental problems.

ND faculty pay 'improving' 
By SANDRA WIEGAND News Staff 
The average compensation for Notre Dame faculty mem­bers is second highest in the nation after cost-of-living ad­justments, according to a re­cent article in the Journal of Higher Education. 
The article stated that the av­erage compensation in 1986-87 was $54,000 per faculty mem­ber. When adjusted for the local cost-of-living, the figure was $59,100. 
Vice President for Business Affairs ,James Lyphout, said that the university has simulta­neously been improving both the pay and the quality of pro­fessors at Notre Dame. 
"The two go hand in hand." he said. Lyphout said that Notre 
Dame is presently in the top quarter percentile for raw salaries, and predicted that the university will make every ef­fort to maintain this position. 
Full professors are the only faculty members included in the survey, according to Lyphout. 
Frank Bonello, Co-chair of the Benefits Committee, specu­lates that the inclusion of pro­fessors who are chairholders could distort the figures. Since chairholders can receive money from private citizens, their compensation is considerably more than that of other full professors. 
Both Lyphout and Bonello ac­knowledge the large part com­pensation plays in attracting high-caliber professors. 
"If you want a good lawyer, you buy him; if you want a highly qualified professor, you do the same." said Bonello. 
Lyphout said that salary in­creases at Notre Dame have been the result of the Provost's hard work. 
He said that the recent in­crease in salary for professors has played a primary role in in­creasing tuition, but also noted other factors, such as the in­stallation of computers and higher insurance costs. 
Schools included in the calcu­
lation  were  those  for  which  
American  Chamber  of  
Commerce  Researchers'  
Association  statistics  were  

available, said a recent South Bend Tribune article. The com­pensation listed in the Journal article came from the annual American Association of University Professors survey, and the cost-of-living factors are those used by the ACCRA. 

CHINA IN TURMOIL 
Chinese student aids in fight for democracy in homeland 
By KELLEY TUTHILL Senior Staff Reporter 
This is the second of a three­part series. 
A Chinese Notre Dame gradu­ate student left the University for Bejing two days after the crackdown and managed to re­turn to the United States two months later despite the Chinese government's new visa laws. 
Twenty-seven year old Xiao Qiang, a physics student who studied at Notre Dame for three years said he went to Bejing because he "couldn't sleep or eat" after the mas­sacre. 
Qiang , originally from Bejing, left Notre Dame Saturday to volunteer for the national Chinese solidarity 
group in Washington, D.C. Qiang said the group will be primarily lobbying in Congress. 
He says he is pro-democracy and as an undergraduate stu­dent in China he was a very ac­tive supporter of the cause. However, last spring when the Chinese students began democ­racy demonstrations in Bejing, Qiang watched from afar. 
"In the beginning of the pro­democracy demonstrations I tried not to watch," said Qiang. He said it was difficult to be so far away and not be able to support the students. 
Qiang said he saw many good things happening in China. "It was not just political, it was about humanity," said Qiang. He said the signs the students wore were touching ,such as "Man I'm hungry, but I can't eat" and "Love." 

To Qiang it was as if there was a big festival in Bejing, he said it seemed much more free and liberal than the norm in China. "It really moved me," he added. According to Qiang, life is generally depressing for the Chinese. 
After the massacre in Tiananman Square, Qiang said he was very depressed and could not study. "I thought to myself, if I can do something, anything, I'll do it." 
Qiang decided that he was going back to China. "With no hesitation, I wanted to be back with my people at the darkest and most dangerous time. I wanted to visit the families of those who had died and tell them how much we love them here (in the U.S.)." 
He said he wanted to carry the message himself by actually going to China and speaking to the people in person. "I knew I wouldn't change anything," he said. Qiang said he knew he could be killed or jailed, but he wanted to go anyway. 
"I tried to get a grollp of people to come with me," stated Qiang. "There was a group that was going prior to the mas­sacre, but they decided that there was no point in going, that it was too dangerous." 
Qiang said he used the ticket of one of the members of the group and traveled alone. "It was less dangerous alone and it was worth it just to let families know I cared." 

"I tried to plan the best route to China and asked friends for their advice," said Qiang. "I wanted to finish my trip with­out being jailed." Many people advised Qiang not to make the trip at all. 
Qiang did not call his family to tell them that he was making the trip, as he feared they would think it too dangerous. 
Taking almost nothing with him, Qiang left from Chicago on June 6. He flew first to Seattle, then to Hong Kong. He said he feared two different situations: 1.) that he would be stopped in customs or 2.) that he would be jailed once he got into China. He decided to buy a ticket from Hong Kong to Guang Zhou in­stead of trying to fly directly into Bejing. 
"There were only three people on the plane leaving for China, and all had Chinese names. All the foreigners were leaving and the airports (in China) were

One more reason not to get up so early 
WORLD BRIEFS 

Lothar Gottsche, a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Notre Dame, has received a fellowship from the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, West Germany. A native of Bonn, Gottsche will do research at the Max Planck Institute through the fall semester. Gottsche, who began graduate study at Notre Dame last fall, is pursuing a doctoral degree in mathematics under the direction of Andrew Sommese, professor of mathematics. His research project is entitled "The Topology of the Hilbert Scheme of Finite Length 0-Dimensional Sub Schemes of Smooth Projective Surfaces." 

NATIONAL BRIEFS 
Trump Castle Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, N.J. did not intentionally mislead gamblers with incorrect instructions in a roulette guide that has been distributed since 1986, state gaming officials said Monday. However, Robert Signore, of Ambler, Pa., says he lost $800 because of the faulty guide and has filed a law­suit in small claims court to recover the money.State documents show that both the state Division of Gaming Enforcement and the Casino Control Commission knew as early as September 1986 that the Trump Castle gaming guide was inaccurate. 
Billionaire publisher Malcolm Forbes took a weekend mo­torcycle trek down the Natchez Trace Parkway and stopped at a plantation home, and described the experience as a 400-mile "drive-in history lesson." Forbes said the trip was designed to generate publicity for the historic parkway, following a route once used by pioneers, traders and trappers headed from Nashville, Tenn., to the Mississippi River port of Natchez, Miss., and for a national park planned for Natchez. 
Alexander Haig, four-star general, failed presidential candidate, former secretary of state and one-time aide to Richard Nixon, now has made his debut on stage in Oceanside, California.On Sunday night, Haig and his wife, Pat, narrated Ogden Nash's verses that accompany Camille Saint-Saens' "Carnival of the Animals."The performance with the California Chamber Virtuosi ended a three-day music festival celebrating the fifth anniversary of Leisure Village Ocean Hills, a 1 ,200-unit re­tirement community. Haig is on its board of directors. 
All 2,200 high school freshmen in Norfolk, Va. will be guaranteed a chance to go to college if they maintain a C-plus av­erage under a plan announced Monday by a scholarship founda­tion. The students will be promised sufficient financial aid if they sign contracts also agreeing to keep a C average in college preparatory courses and a 90 percent attendance record.Parents must agree to an unspecified personal contribution to college costs, generally at least $700 annually, said Frank Batten, board chairman of the Tidewater Scholarship Foundation. 
Mayor Don Fraser of Minneapolis,saw an aide chasing a thief who had grabbed her purse, so the 65-year-old mayor fig­ured the only thing to do was join the chase.Wearing a suit and tie and leather shoes, the mayor bolted down office building steps Sunday, raced around the back of a house and headed up a side street.But Fraser wasn't quite fast enough. Witnesses said the thief hopped into a waiting car and was gone.Katie Fournier, whose purse was stolen, was impressed with Fraser's efforts. 

WEATHER 

Cooler 
Partly sunny and cool today. Highs in the upper 60s. Cloudy and cool tonight with a chance of light rain after midnight. Lows from 50 to 55. Cloudy and cooler tomorrow with a chance of light rain. 
7 a.m. was too early for fame, but that's when it struck me, for that is when my alarm went off last Friday. I wasn't too thrilled about the time, or even about getting up for that matter, but what I heard inspired me. It was a plea, a plea for anyone who was listening to WVFI at such an ungodly hour to call and admit it to the unbelieving d.j. (He obviously wasn't too fond of doing the "early-bird" show, I deduced from his more-than sarcastic re­marks.) 
Being 7 a.m., I had nothing better to do than call and prove to him that he did have a listener, an over-tired, and somewhat comatose listener, but a listener nonetheless. 
He was so thrilled. The exuberance in his voice ... well, it warmed the cockles of my heart. He proceeded to dedicate the next hour to me, a decision that would ruin my morning, and possibly my entire day. 
After announcing to the otherwise non­existent listening world that, "the next song is for our love goddess Monica," I knew I was in trouble. From that moment on, EVERY song he played was for the "love goddess." 
He changed his pleas for calls by adding the ever-clever, "Come on, call us up... Monica did." The madness of my simple phone-in had far outstretched the realm of reality when I heard his marriage proposal, and I shuddered at the ramifications of such publicity. (This wasn't exactly the way a freshman wants to get her name in circulation ... ) 
He asked me to call him back, again and again. With each call came a few more re­quests from my part to just play the music, and not name games. He was bored, and started calling me. I knew I'd made a mistake when I told him that I'd have the answering machine take the calls, because he was chomping at the bits for something catchy to use on the air. But, before I had a chance to analyze his intentions, "nature" called, and I had to make an exit to the bathroom. 


OF INTEREST 


It was a bad move, the worst, because as I re-entered my room, I heard MY voice being broadcast, via the machine, over the air. Of course, he left another goofy message, which sent me into an even bigger tizzy. 
This "Ode to Monica" had to end. For one thing, I was thinking seriously about going to my morning class, and dreading what would happen if he was left on the air, unsupervised by my keen ear. The gods must have decided that I'd had enough, because my fifteen minutes of Wharhol-ish torture came to end when my beloved d.j. closed his show, with a dedication 
and thanks to his "number one fan, Monica." 
Looking back I must admit that it was rather funny, and probably the result of my own doing. It couldn't have traumatized me too much, because just this morning I caught myself calling the station. Maybe it's one of those bizarre habits, calling up radio stations at to request music at ridiculous hours in the morn­ing. The guy on the air this morning seemed fond of my name, come to think of it. 
I must be either a glutton for punish­ment, or just really bored in the wee hours of the morning. Maybe I'm cursed, doomed to be a d.j.'s dream, and my own nightmare. But it doesn't really matter, because no one else is lis­tening anyway.

U.S. looks to Saudis for emergency oil reserves 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Bush administration is pursuing talks with Saudi Arabia on leasing Saudi crude oil for the 
U.S. emergency oil stockpile, a government source disclosed Monday. 
Such leases would be expected to amount to a U.S. option to 
buy  the  Saudi  crude  in  an  
emergency.  
Leasing  would  be  a  major  

shift from the Energy Department's policy of buying oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Mexico currently sup­plies all the oil for the U.S. stockpile under a contract ex­piring Nov. 30. 
The main reason for leasing

after crossing into West Germany. 
It was the greatest flood of East German refugees since 1961, the year the Berlin Wall halted the flow to the West. 
Hungary's action marks the first time a Warsaw Pact coun­try has aided an exodus of refugees from an allied com­munist nation. East German leader~ expressed outrage at the Hungarian government, and state news media accused it of "organized smuggling of hu­mans." In Moscow, the Soviet news 
agency  Tass  condemned  
Western  media  for  what  it  
called  a  "tendentious  cam-

very crowded," said Qiang. 
According to Qiang, Guang Zhou is a city in South China and only a one-half hour plane flight from Hong Kong. He said he did not know what would happen to him at customs. 
The agents asked him ques­tions and had him fill out some forms. He told them he was taking a vacation. "Now as I look back I know I was ner­vous, but I somehow got in," said Qiang. 
Qiang realizes now how un­prepared he was to go back to China. For example, he said his clothes were not appropriate for the area he was visiting. Also, his accent had changed after three years in the United States. Qiang said he did not have any Chinese money with 
him either.  
Qiang  stated  that  at  this  
point in his trip he  was  very  
tired  and  needed sleep.  The  

train stations were closed, as there was a strike, said Qiang. He did not want people to know he was back from the U.S., yet his only identification was a passport which would show that he had just returned. 
Although he was very ner­vous, Qiang said he decided he had to find a place to sleep. He rented a hotel room and was able to watch a television broadcast. "The only news I could get was a government video that showed the govern­ment's version of the events." 
The following day, after fi­nally getting a night's sleep, Qiang realized he had to get some Chinese currency. He con­sidered going to the black mar­ket, but he feared being ar­rested before traveling to Bejing. 
Qiang decided to try to con­tact and old friend at a nearby university. According to Qiang, contacts in China are what caused his trip to be a success. 
would be to reduce the cost of filling the oil reserve. The gov­ernment currently is paying Mexico a market-based price for the roughly 60,000 barrels a day. In mid-August the price was $17.17 a barrel. 
Congress earlier this year ordered the Energy Department to study leasing and to assess interest among foreign suppli­ers. Congress earlier ordered the department to work toward a 750-million barrel reserve. 
The stockpile currently holds 575 million barrels of crude, about 73 days worth of im­ports, in underground salt cav­erns in Louisiana and Texas. It was created by Congress in 1975 in response to the 1973 Arab oil embargo led by Saudi 
paign" to spur illegal East German emigration. Tass also said that foreign West German diplomatic missions illegally protect East German refugees 
and  supply  them  with  West  
German documents.  
Several  hundred  East  

Germans, seeking safe passage to the West, are now holed up in West Germany's embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia. 
It was not known how long the exodus of East Germans out of Hungary would last. News reports said the East Germans might restrict travel to Hungary in retaliation, but the government denied the re­ports. 
"I have this feeling that I have missed the last train to the West," a worried student in East Berlin told The Associated Press. 
Arabia. 
The interest of Saudi Arabia, 
No. 1 supplier of imported 
crude to the United States, was 
first expressed in a private 
meeting last Thursday between 
Saudi Oil Minister Hisham 
Nazer and Energy Secretary 
James Watkins, said the 
source, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. 
"They're very interested," the source said, adding that leasing was the first subject raised by Nazer in the meeting at Energy Department headquarters. 
No details of a possible leas­ing deal were discussed, and Watkins told Nazer the next step could be a meeting of the two sides' technical experts, the source said. 
Penny Adams, a department spokeswoman, confirmed that the leasing idea was discussed in the meeting, but she declined to say whether the Saudis ex­pressed interest. 
"From the point of view of the United States it's an ex­traordinary good deal," he said in a telephone interview. "I can't see anything wrong with 
James Akins, who served as 
U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1973 to 1976, said leasing appears to be a good move for the Bush administra­tion. 
it although I can't see any greater economic benefit for the Saudis." 
Leasing rather than buying additional oil could be cheape!, 
thus possibly allowing the ad­ministration to fill the reserve at a faster rate. Some critics have noted that because the na­tion is importing an increasing share of its daily crude re­quirements, the strategic re­serve's value as an emergency fallback is diminishing. 
At one point in 1985 the re­serve held the equivalent of 115 days worth of U.S. oil imports. Now it holds 73 days worth, even though the reserve itself has continued to grow.

Illinois premarital AIDS test law repealed 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO-Gov. James Thompson on Monday signed legislation repealing lllinois' controversial premarital AIDS­testing requirement, the only law of its kind in the nation. 
Thompson announced his de­cision at O'Hare International Airport as he prepared to leave on a two-week European trade mission. 
"That wasn't an easy decision for me because I still think the issue of AIDS is extraordi­
nary," Thompson said before 
boarding his flight for Milan, 
Italy. "We did experiment with 
the law and I think the legisla­
ture was right in repealing it." 
By law, Thompson had until 
Sept. 18 to sign or veto the re­
peal measure, approved in June 
by the General Assembly. But 
aides said the governor planned 
to clear his desk of legislation 
before leaving Monday. 
The repeal measure, effective immediately, also eliminates a long-standing requirement that prospective spouses be tested for syphilis. 
Even before it took effect in 
January 1988, the premarital 
AIDS testing requirement was 
debated by advocates of strict 
measures against AIDS and 
public-health experts who said 
it spent precious resources on a 
low-risk group. 
Thompson said state officials found the premarital AIDS tests turned up far fewer posi­tive results among couples than expected. 
"It's pretty clear people were going to neighboring states" to get married, Thompson said. "What we were doing was in fact alienating people." 
By Monday, about 250,000 people had been tested and 52 had tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus, said Tom Schafer, spokesman for the state Department of Public Health. 
The law required couples seeking a marriage license to show a doctor's certification that they had been tested for AIDS.

Friendship requires action when alcohol is abused 

How many times have you 

walked by somebody passed­
out at a party, shaking your 
head in disapproval or else with 
a mocking smile, never giving it 
more than that half thought? 
Many, I'm sure. I have. 
In general, we are unaware of 

how serious such cases may be. 
We know, of course, that people 
die by asphyxiation in their own 
vomit, that people's hearts stop 
beating because of an overdose 
of alcohol. that one's body can 
collapse in a drunken sleep. 
We hardly consider our friends likely candidates for that. We tend to take their case lightly and even to make it a laughing matter. But think about it: How would you like being told, the morning after you walked past him in the couch, that your friend was taken to the hospital, and his heart had stopped beating? 
Unfortunately, drunkenness is often a rite of passage in ours, and for that reason, most of us have at some time or another abused alcohol. Alcohol in moderation is not only not harmful, but it has an important place in any society. But the abuse of alcohol is dangerous. and we should not take it lightly. 
Alcoholism is a further aspect of the problem of alcohol abuse. It is not always easy to distinguish the heavy drinker from the alcoholic, especially in its early stages. But differently from the occasional heavy drinker, the alcoholic is victim of a disease. His drinking is no longer a matter of choice, even if he may tell himself it is. That is why the alcoholic needs help. 
There is a simple rule of thumb to identify the problem drinker or alcoholic: The alco­holic's drinking has become a problem which has begun to af­fect his life. 
The problem may be almost 
DOONESBURY 
imperceptible at the early 
stages. But if you find yourself 
getting drunk and getting into 
trouble and waking up the next 
morning feeling terrible about 
what you did last night and 
then doing it again... then you 
have a problem. It's that sim­
ple. If you notice this is happen­
ing to your roommate, chances 
are she needs to be told; and 
more often than not, she also 

needs to seek help. 
Many of us have seen the typ­

ical symptoms in our friends or 
acquaintances. Most of the time 
we choose to let things go. 
Most of us will deny there is a 
problem: the alcoholic because 
self-denial is part of the dis­
ease, the friends because deep 
down she doesn't want to get 
involved. 
But if your friend gets into a pattern of drinking, there is a problem. Don't ignore it, don't make jokes about it. By doing that you facilitate his drinking, and you become his accomplice. That is the worst thing you can do to your friend. 
We hear much criticism of the alcohol policy because it is im­practical, because it is too ex­treme, because it is counter­productive. Discussion is im­portant, but before we can dis­cuss it profitably, we need to become clearly aware of the problem it seeks to combat. Only after we have become more aware and only after our attitudes towards alcohol have begun to change will we be in a position to find a better way; not before.

LETTERS 
Student involvement damaged by distrust and disgust 
Dear Editor: 
How many times have we heard student government rep­resentatives ask for om' help and declare that our input is essential to the making of a "success fu I" year? Undoubtedly, we have heard this plea ad nauseum. Why is that so? Is it that students do not know about the "wonderful" opportunities available in the student gov­ernment offices? Possibly. Or,more probably, it is that the students choose not to get in­volved? 
I want to relate an incident that will support the latter claim. 
I was approached by an indi­vidual "collecting" names for the Michigan lottery. He wanted to know if I was entering the lottery because, if not, he wanted to enter my name. Curiously, as I glanced over the list of approximately 25 names he had already gathered, I asked him how he could execute this plan. Are there not rules about how many names one can present? What about student ID's? He informed me, rather flatly, that it is "Who -you know." He said he knew an in­dividual involved in the lottery (this individual's name and function were withheld from me) who would let him register as many people as he wanted, all rules and restrictions waived, with one condition: that any tickets won beyond the agreed on number of two would be turned over to the unnamed lottery official. 
I can not necessarily blame my friend because he was cre­ative and enterprising, although I by no means exon­erate him or condone his ac­tions; but I do have a problem with the lottery official. (There are obvious ethical implica­tions, and a popular argument to interject here would be the ramifications of this act in light of the honor code and its spirit, but these are not my inten­tions.) 
Is it any wonder students have a sincere distaste for stu­dent government? Can the pre­sent administration now under­stand that apparent apathy is actually a vote of distrust and disgust? Student government is necessary, and although the demands put on those officials are great and the thanks few, they are not above the "average" students on this campus. 
Maybe these incidents have a sizable impact on student in­volvement (they undoubtedly have a monumental impact on student perception of campus government) and are worthy of reflection by those who run student government. 
It is not too late to right the wrongs of the ticket lottery; and although this action will be met by open hostility from lot­tery winners (some legiti­mate?), it will go a long way in establishing credibility for stu­dent government. Don't start off the school year with a fum­bled Michigan lottery.

Off-campus students confront unexpected problems 
Dear Editor: 
Every year approximately 20 percent of Notre Dame students choose to move off campus for a variety of reasons ranging from a desire for more independence to expectations of hosting their own parties. 
Unfortunately, these students often encounter more problems than originally expected. They often have expectations of fun and freedom off-campus, but soon find that there is more to off-campus living than the ten-keg parties. Most students know of the potential good times that can be had at off-campus parties, but it is the students who host these parties who have to deal with the con­sequences that arise because of them. Off-campus students have to deal with neighbor rela­tions and other issues because they are no longer just a Notre Dame student but also a mem­ber of the local community. This entails a certain responsi­bility. 
In an attempt to help the off­campus student be better pre­pared for dealing with prob­lems off-campus, the Office of Student Affairs, in cooperation with the South Bend police de­partment, is sponsoring an in­formational meeting for all in­terested off-campus students tonight at 7:00 in Theodore's. The meeting will be a chance for students to ask questions and to learn the positions of both the South Bend police and 
the Office of Student Affairs concerning off-campus stu­dents. Representatives of both organizations will be on hand to share information and to answer any questions that stu­dents may have. Topics such as neighbor and police relations, security and tenant-landlord relations will be discussed. All students living off-campus are 
encouraged  not  to  miss  this  
opportunity.

Sanders heralded for feats in pro football and baseball 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Deion Sanders kept a date with his playbook after his exciting NFL debut with the Atlanta Falcons. 
Although Sanders returned a punt 68 yards for a touchdown just four days after his last game with baseball's New York Yankees, the Falcons lost their opener 31-21 to the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. 
Now Sanders, who signed a $4.5 million, four-year contract with the Falcons on Thursday, will get an opportunity to practice at cornerback for a full week before meeting the Dallas Cowboys. 
''I'm excited about my performance, but I'm gonna sleep with my playbook so I can learn the defense," said Sanders, an All-American cornerback at Florida State last season. 
Against the Rams, Sanders ran back his first punt 15 yards before his dazzling 68-yarder that had the crowd of 38,708 screaming. After that, the Rams decided to kick the ball away from Sanders or out of bounds. 
"I wasn't uptight. I wanted to get in there and make things happen," said Sanders, whose self-proclaimed nickname is "Prime Time." 
DeCicco declares fullback Spears ineligilbe for 1989 football season 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame's reserve sophomore fullback Kenny Spears has been declared aca­demically ineligible for the 1989 football season. 
According to academic advi­sor, extra work done by Spears at the completion of his sum­mer course was not accepted by 
He showed he was not shy. When he raced out onto the field for the first time to field a punt, he raised his arms and led the fans in cheering. He continued the practice each time, getting the crowd emotionally charged. 
On the TD scamper, Sanders fumbled the punt, recovered it, was hit twice, circled back to his own 20-yard line before turning the corner and was hit two more times before breaking free at the Rams' 40. 
"I caught the line drive and a couple of guys missed me, and when I got out in the open it was Prime Time," Sanders said. "I said to myself, 'Boy, what have you done?"' 
The return impressed the Rams. 
"Yes, we were kicking away from him," Los Angeles Coach John Robinson said. "He has such a big impact on the crowd. I didn't want him to do it again." 
Asked if the Rams were intimidated, punter Dale Hatcher said: "Sure we were. He's good. There's no doubt about it. It's amazing. A couple of days ago he was playing baseball, and here he is running back a punt for a touchdown."

Spears did not play as a freshman but was impressive in spring drills. He was moved from tailback to fullback in preseason practice and was ex­pected to boost the Irish depth at the position following the loss of Braxston Banks to a knee injury.

Belles' tennis stays undefeated 
By Heather Atkinson 
Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
The Saint Mary's Tennis Team began its season this past weekend in hopes of de­fending its second consecutive NAIA district championship. 
In a quadrangular meet with Wheaton College, University of Wisconsin and DePauw University, Saint Mary's was able to defeat all of its oppo­nents. 
On Friday, the Belles faced Wheaton College on the Notre Dame courts. They easily held back their competition with a score of 9-0. 
Returning lettermen, senior Jen Block, rallied from a deficit of 6-1 in a tiebreaker to win 1­6, 7-6, 10-8. 
Freshman Denise McDonald proved her ability to contribute to the championship team by coming back, having lost the first set, to win the next two with very consistent play, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.

On Saturday, Saint Mary's was again victorious, this time defeating University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee 7-2. 
The number one doubles team of Block and Sarah Mayer had a strong comeback to de­feat the UWM team 6-3,3-6, 7­5. 
In the singles competition, intense effort and dedication enabled Saint Mary's to defeat UWM single-handedly. Number­two player, Mayer, won 6-2, 6­
0. Number-three player ,McDonald, triumphed 6-2, 6-0. The number-five seed defeated her opponent with scores of 6­3,6-3. 
Sweeping their final victory for the meet, Saint Mary's easily defeated DePauw , 8-1 later that day. 
Another outstanding match was turned in by Block as she rallied from a loss in the sec­ond set to play an intense third set and win 6-4, 7-6, 11-9. 
Freshman Natalie Kloepfer came back from having lost her 
touted secondary live up to their press? 
"They can't worry about that," said Heater. "All they can do is worry about today and today is practice. They can strive to be more consistent. Last year if we had any success it was because we improved from the first game up to the twelfth game. We could be out­standing but we can't stop where we are."

Mayer and Kloepfer were both victorious in singles play.However, their teammates were unable to pull through. Block, McDonald and Ellen Mayer each played three sets, but could not get past the Evansville offensive. 
"All of the girls played very well, each giving 110 percent to the game," said coach Charlene Szajko. "The matches were much closer than the score books may indicate." 
Ellen Mayer was able to team up with Kloepfer as the number-three doubles, rallying from a first set loss to win the next two with scores of 6-4, 7­6,7-5.

SMC opens 1989 soccer season 
Belles post unblemished 3-0 record in earlygoing 
BY HEATHER ATKINSON Saint Mary's Sports Editor 

The Saint Mary's soccer team began what looks to be a successful season with its season opener last Wednesday at Western Michigan University. 
The Belles took an early lead, dominating the first half. Trish Troester made the first goal, which put the Belles ahead 1-0 at the half. 
Caroline Knoll rallied at the beginning of the second half to give Saint Mary's their second goal. 
Kelly Cook was able to contribute two of the 24 shots on goals made by Saint Mary's. 
Western Michigan was only able to score two goals on goalie Mary Barger, who had five goalie saves for the game. 
Anne Hartzel was able to score the final Saint Mary's point off of a corner kick allowing the Belles to defeat their competition with a final score of S-2. 
Rivalries 
continued from page 12 

Illinois Cycling Club: This game is an exception to the rules because the teams have met just once, an 18-2 Notre Dame victory in 1895. They will play the Irish under the condition that players from both teams must ride bicycles during the game. 
Chicago Physicians and Surgeons: This is the season­ending contest because Holtz feels the opponents can cure all of the wounds the Irish endure in the first five punishing games. The Irish lead the series 7-2 and won the last game 88­0. 
And the bowl opponent? Either Missouri Osteopaths, South Bend A.C. or Englewood High School in Chicago, whichever has the best-or maybe the worst-record.

"This is a great start for our first game," said Head Coach Tom Van Meter. "Even though we made mistakes, I felt that we overcame them and learned from these mistakes. I am extremely pleased with the team because of the support while we played." 
In the Saint Mary's College soccer tournament this past weekend, the Belles dominated both games, never allowing their competition to score. They shut out Bowling Green State University 2-0. 
Kathy Revane scored the first goal on an assist by Trish Troester. Caroline Knoll scored the second goal of the team's 25 shots on the goal. Goalie Mary Barger had another outstanding game with 12 saves. 
"It was a positive game for us," said player Kelly Cook. "The game was a stepping stone to show that we are playing up to our fullest potential as a team." 

On Sunday, Saint Mary's faced Indiana University at South Bend and once again controlled their competition with a final score of 4-0. 
Trish Troester-once again proved her importance on the team by scoring the first goal on an assist from Kelly Cook. 
Terese Martinov rallied to score a goal on a penalty kick to give the Belles a 2-0 advantage. 
Greer Gilliland assisted the third goal shot made by Kelly Fraleigh. Nancy Haske kicked in the final, winning point, one of 26 shots on the goal. !USB was able to only get off one shot on the Saint Mary's goal. 
"We are coming together as a whole team, " said player Martinov. "Offensively and defensively we dominated !USB the entire game. As a team, we feel we are improving drastically every game." 
The team will attempt to defend their perfect 3-0 record at Tri-State College on Wednesday, Sept.13.

Sailing, rowing, rugby clubs get off to a flying start 
The weather on Sunday was perfect for the Sailing Club to have its first major regatta of the year . Notre Dame hosted the 14-team Notre Dame Intersectional on Diamond Lake (Mich.). The competition included Big Ten schools Michigan, Wisconsin, Purdue, Iowa, and Michigan State. Marquette, Ohio Wesleyan, and out of district St. Mary's (Ma.) also com­peted in the event. The Irish finished eighth overall. 
Mike Kamradt Club Corner 
" It's a real challenge to host and sail well, but we feel it's a positive start," said club president Paige Cooper. The 
club  will  have  a  chance  to  improve  this  weekend  as  they  
send  teams  to  Kent  State,  Lake Forest College,  and  the  
University  of Iowa.  

The football game won't be the only Notre Dame vs.. Michigan battle this weekend. The Rugby Club will take on the Wolverines in Ann Arbor Saturday at 11:00 at Mitchell Field (next to North Campus). What better way to get pumped up for the football game than by watching another body crunching sport? The Rugby Club will take three sides to Michigan. 
After two weeks of two mile runs back and forth to the boathouse and six-to-ten miles of rowing a day, the Rowing Club will have its first regatta in Chicago this weekend. The team will compete against squads from University of Chicago, Northwestern, and Loyola. According to club president Brian Lapps, the outlook for this race and the season is promising.

Irish may face some new adversaries next fall 
The college football media guide-Notre Dame's in particular-has just about everything you would want to know, many things you couldn't care less to know and some things you wonder how anybody could know to begin with. 
First, some examples. Frank Leahy always called his players his "lads." The Four Horsemen rushed a total of 939 times for 5,188 yards. The New York Times Computer ranked Notre Dame 12th in 1980. 
Behind his back people say Chris Zorich is "fat as a cow." Rod Smith's nickname is "Professor Griff." Tim Grunhard's greatest moment was cliff diving in Arkansas. If Ned Bolcar was on a desert island, he would want "a full assortment of video tapes and a jar of lard and a fishing pole." The list could go on and on. 
My favorite section is the one with the results of every Irish game against every opponent. Some observations: 
Teams that have never beaten Notre Dame after playing at least three games include Alma (combined scores in four games of 196-0), American Medical College (combined scores of 362-0 in five games), Beloit, Boston College, California, DePauw, Drake and Franklin. 
Also, Haskell, Hillsdale, Kalamazoo (318-0 in seven games), Lake Forest, Marquette (three ties in six games), Minnesota, Ohio Medical University,

Ohio Northern, Olivet, Pennsylvania, Rice, Rose Poly, Rush Medical, St. Louis, St. Viator (116-7 in 1912), South Dakota and Tulane. 
On the flip side, the only teams Notre Dame has played and never beaten include Chicago (0-4), Florida State (0-1), Georgia, Indianapolis Artillery (0-1, an 18-0 loss in 1895) and Yale (0-1, a 28-0 loss in 1914). 
While looking at all of the lost rivalries, like Highland Views (82-0 win in 1896) and Coe (28-7 victory in 1927), the Notre Dame Athletic Department decided to do something unique for the 1990 schedule. 
Forget Michigan and Miami. The schedule for next year will bring back those rivalries of old. The Irish will play teams which they have played at least twice or teams which have beaten them at least once. The two teams must not have played in the past 40 years. With that in mind, here's the 1990 schedule (Dates and kickoff times to be announced by television). 
At Albion: It's always tough to open against Albion on the road, but Lou Holtz wants to see how the Irish react in a tough opener for a change. The last meeting was in 1898, a 60-0 victory for the Irish. 
Great Lakes: The game is already a general admission sellout at NotreDame Stadium, and some idiots over at Pangborn are already camping out for tickets. Great Lakes holds a 2-1-2 advantage in the series, winning the last contest 39-7 in 1945. 
Knox: This is the rubber game, with the series tied at 1-1. Notre Dame has the momentum after winning 22-4 in 1907. 
At Wabash: Wabash feels it has a distinct advantage going into this contest despite having dropped 10 of the 11 games in the series. Since their school is male only, the Wabash players say they can concentrate solely on football without the distractions of females. Irish players say the Wabash students must never have visited Notre Dame. 
Olivet: Notre Dame has won the past three games, but Olivet is threatening to bring its mascots­Popeye, Brutus and Sweet Pea.
