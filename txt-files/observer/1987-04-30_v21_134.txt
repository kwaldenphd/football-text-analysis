FDN says American slain in fight 
The Associated Press 
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras­An American engineer killed in northern Nicaragua was caught in a firefight between rebel fighters and Sandinista militia, the largest U.S.­supported Contra force said Wednesday. 
The account contradicted Nicaraguan statements that 27­year-old Benjamin Ernest Linder, of Portland, Ore., was singled out by the Contras and slain. 
The Nicaraguan Democratic Force, or FDN, said that it held the leftist government of Nicaragua responsible for the death of the first American to die in Nicaragua's civil war. Nicaragua said the U.S. gov­ernment was to blame for sup­porting the Contras. 
"The death of Linder was produced in the midst of a firefight between one of our patrols and a group of militia of the Sandinista army, which accompanied the U.S. citizen," the FDN said in a statement released in Tegucigalpa. 
Linder's body on Wednesday was in Matagalpa, a Nicaraguan provincial capital, where a ceremony was held in his honor. 
American colleagues of the Oregon engineer joined Sandi­nista officials in blaming the Reagan administration for his death. 
The Contras' statement said Linder was killed Tuesday near La Camaleona, located about 45 miles from the Honduran border. 


Board to consider divestment issue 
By MARK PANKOWSKI and JIM RILEY Staff Reporters 
One week after this Friday's 
planned protest against apar­
theid and racism, the Univer­
sity Board of Trustees will dis­
cuss whether to divest from 
companies doing business in 
South Africa. 
A recent request by the Rev. 
Leon Sullivan, however, has 
decreased the likelihood of the 
board's deciding to divest at 
next week's meeting. 
On May 7, 8 and 9, the trus­tees are ~cheduled to discuss the University's investment policy. 
''I hope the Board of Trustees will realize the situation (in South Africa) has deteriorated, and that the time has come to implement the policy (to divest)," said Margarita Rose, chairperson of the Anti­Apartheid Network. 
In November, the Board of Trustees decided it would com­pletely reassess Notre Dame's investment policy at its spring meeting. 
By then the trustees expected to know whether Sullivan would call for American col­leges and universities to divest. 
Earlier this month, however, Sullivan asked all colleges and universities that followed his principles to postpone any di­vestment decisions until after his press conference on June 1. 

At that press conference, Sul­livan said he will announce whether universities should divest their holdings from firms doing business in South Africa. 
"I think we'll want to wait until after June 1," said Father Oliver Williams, a member ol 
the Board's ad hoc committeE 
on South African investments. 
Williams stressed, however 
that this was his opinion an< 
not necessarily the board's. 

Sullivan will make his June 1 
announcement after travelling 
to South Mrica, where he'll 
meet with black union leaders 
to discuss what effect the 
withdrawal of American busi­
nesses would have on South 
Africa. 
In an effort to influence the trustees' decision, several groups are sponsoring a protest at 3:15p.m. Friday on the steps of the Administration Building. 
Rose said she hopes between 400 and 500 people show up at the protest, which will take place rain or shine. 
The rally is sponsored by stu­dent government, Anti­Apartheid Network, Black Cul­tural Arts Council, Women United for Justice and Peace, Notre Dame NAACP and the Peace Institute. 
Besides influencing the board's divestment decision, the protest is intended to focus attention on racism in the United States, she said. 
Notre Dame is not immune from the problem of racism, she said. 
"It's not been anything like cross burnings or lynchings," said Rose. She's heard, however, of cases where a black student has gone to a party, and unlike white stu­dents, has been asked to show an I.D. card to prove he's from Notre Dame. 
Rose also cited reports of

The perils of hall storage are not worth the hassle 
Yes, it's that time of year again. It's time for finals. For final parties. For finals parties. And moving out of those wonderful dorm rooms. The seniors are lucky enough to avoid the conse­quences of moving out and back into a building three months later. For the rest of us, summer means only one thing. 
Storage. (Screams, thunder and lightning, if this were TV) 
Have any of you underclassmen ever really seen, with your own eyes, what happens to all that stuff that four or five semi-drunk guys from your dorm, or from some other dorm if you're female, pick up and throw into a disreputable­looking rental truck'? "Sure, they put it in storage," you say. Sure, and nuclear bombs just spread radiation. 
Until last summer, I had several theories on where stored materials actually ended up. The coal pits to the north of Notre Dame always struck me as a likely spot for dorm storage. Or maybe when they say they're storing in a ware­house, they really mean an abandoned ware­house. One with rats. Hungry rats. 
Wait until the stuff comes back. If it does, it will most likely be dented, and possibly be snapped in half. 
I had seen the condition in which others had 

gotten their stuff back at the beginning of fresh­
man year, so I got together with a few guys in 
my section at the end of the year and we all 
split a small storage area. We rented our own 
truck and loaded our own stuff. It only took two 
trips, and it worked out to be only marginally 
cheaper than going through hall storage. 
But at least I got my things back in one piece. 
Contrast that with the absolutely monstrous 

pile of "stored" (read "thrown in a pile in a 
warehouse") goods we saw in the same place 
we stored our things. 
Standard ND boxes were stacked 18 boxes 

high. The bottom ones looked an inch or two 
shorter than they're supposed to. Hope there 
wasn't any glassware in those. 
Couches were piled only twelve high. The bot­

tom one had literally snapped in half. Instead 
of looking like an ''L'', the couch looked like an 
"I" on its side. Maybe it was a recliner. It is 
now. 
Carpets were kind of mixed in with the rest 

of the goods. They resembled spaghetti. I 
wonder what kind of molds grow in carpet. Did 
you ever wonder what those things were in the 
carpet when you unrolled it in the fall after 
storage? They sure weren't there in the spring, 

Mark Mclaughlin 


Projects Manager ·'· 
~­
Pt:>tRIER 

you thought. But is it really your carpet anyway? 
We saw half a bicycle sticking out of the top 'Jf the pile. We couldn't find the other half. Things did seem to have an alarming tendency to snap in half in this storage pile. 
I refuse to conjecture where the stereo speakers and other valuables were hidden. Per­haps they were buried underneath the couches to discourage thieves from taking them. 
By the way, I have it from a reliable source that many storage crews are provided free lunch and a case of beer besides. Hey, if you stored your furniture yourself, you could be en­joying that free case of beer and free lunch yourself. 
That was, of course, only one pile of dorm belongings I saw that fateful May afternoon. But it was enough to convince me never to send things to hall storage. Never ever ever. 
Personally, I don't know what I'm going to do with my stuff this year. Maybe I'll sell it all off and buy new stuff next year. I'll get all new furniture for my room and save myself a few bucks and the hassle of storage. But this solu­tion won't work for everyone, since if everyone sells off their furniture and carpets then no one will buy them. So you all keep sending your valuable furniture to hall storage. 
I'll take mine home to New Jersey. 
By the way, have a great summer and all that. I promise I won't say "I told you so" next fall.

Falwell says PTL will continue 
The Associated Press 
FORT MILL, S.C.-The Rev. Jerry Falwell took over as host of the "PTL club" television show Wednesday and assured donors the ministry would sur­vive, complying with "the rules and regulations of man as well as of God.'' 
Falwell characterized tur­moil in the ministry as God "cleaning house." 
PTL is trying to rebuild fol­lowing the resignation of Jim Bakker as its head and revela­tions shortly afterward of his sexual liaison with a church secretary in 1980. 
Disclosures about the mini­stry's finances, including pay­ment of $1.6 million in salary and bonuses to Bakker and his wife, Tammy, in 1986 have prompted the Internal Reve­nue Service and the South Carolina Tax Commission to challenge PTL's tax-exempt status and to seek millions of dollars in back taxes. 
The success of the $129 mil­lion ministry and Christian retreat, however, depends on donations, Falwell said. 
"Join us . . . to see to it this ministry never becomes just a page in history,'' he said during his first appearance as host of the program. 
Falwell said he would remain as host of the show until a per­manent replacement was found. But he said he did not know how long that would be. 
The syndicated talk-show, which features music and Christian entertainment, is the cornerstone of the ministry founded by Bakker and is its main fund-raiser. 
"I want to share heart-to­heart with you what happened here," Falwell, a fundamen­talist evangelist, said from his office in Lynchburg, Va. "I believe a sovereign God is cleaning house." 
The new PTL board chaired 
by Falwell agreed Tuesday to 
stop all payments to the Bak­
kers and to Jessica Hahn, a 
former church secretary who 
agreed to a settlement of 
$265,000 if she would remain 
quiet about the incident with 
Bakker. 
Bakker, a charismatic, turned the ministry over to Fal­well on March 19. The new board on Tuesday banished Bakker and his top aide, the Rev. Richard Dortch, from the PTL pulpit and agreed to inves­tigate allegations of homosexuality and wife-swapping at PTL. 
Falwell said Dortch would receive no remuneration, but he did not make clear whether that included severance pay. 
The majority of the board, with legal control of PTL's operations, ignored Bakker's plea to turn the ministry over to charismatics, with former 
U.S. interior Secretary James Watt as chairman. 
Church cracks down on national hoDiosexual group 
The Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Under a toughened Vatican policy, Roman Catholic efforts to curb organizational activi­ties of Catholic homosexuals are spreading in the United States. 
One after another, local chapters of the national group Dignity are being barred by diocesan bishops from meeting in Church facilities and priests told not to cooperate with the group. 
A few priests reportedly have resigned in protest, at least one of them publicly. 
"It's just appalling," said James Bussen of Chicago, national president of Dig­nity, an organization of about 5,000 gay and lesbian Catholics, with 110 chapters across the country. 
"We're disappointed in these diocesan decisions. We just wish the bishops would be brave and more steadfast in serving all people." 
Noting that a gradually in­creasing number of Ameri­can dioceses --eight so far ­have acted to prohibit worship services or meetings sponsored by Dig­nity in churches, Bussen said in a telephone inter­view, "It seems to be a domino effect so far. We're not sure why, or how to stop it." 
San Francisco's Arch­bishop John Quinn said the conflict with Dignity would be eased if it would "be more cooperative." 
"If they would not be at­tacking the moral teaching of the Church, we could all work together," he told the National Catholic Reporter.

The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Conserva­tive activist Carl "Spitz" Chan­nell pointed to former White House aide Oliver North as a fellow conspirator on Wednes­day as he pleaded guilty to the first criminal charge of the Iran-Contra affair. 
Channell was formally ac­cused of defrauding the govern­ment by telling contributors to his National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty that their gifts would be tax de­ductible even though the money actually was used to provide military aid to the U.S.­backed Contra rebels in Nicaragua. 
Channell pleaded guilty to a single count and agreed to cooperateinindependentcoun­sel Lawrence Walsh's investi­gation. 
Walsh's formal charge,

rebels along with two Nicaraguans Tuesday is carried aboard a Soviet-made helicopter by Nicaraguan government soldiers. 
known as a criminal informa­tion, said Channell was in­volved with a government offi­cial, but the charge did not identify that official. 
However, when Channell was asked in court by U.S. district Judge Stanley Harris to name the persons with whom he con­spired, he replied simply, "Col. North, an official of the Na­tional Security Council." 
When Walsh aide Michael Bromwich was asked later if a similar charge could be ex­pected soon against North, he said, "We're not prepared to do that at this time." 
At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to com­ment. "We're not investigating ourselves and I don't expect to elaborate on these kind of is­sues," Fitzwater said. 
Under the agreement Chan­nell entered into with Walsh, 


he was killed in an ambush.

A decision to divest at next 
week's trustees' meeting would 
be good for Notre Dame 
"because it would mean Notre 
Dame is taking the justice is­
sues in South Africa seriously,'' 
said Walshe. 

"Secondly, it would be im­portant because it would then be Notre Dame throwing its very considerable weight in Catholic circles behind the whole broader divestment issue and sanctions movement. 
"In other words, Notre Dame by itself is not going to change South Africa. Divestment by it­self is not going to change South Africa," he said. 
"But Notre Dame and the broader divestment move­ment, in cooperation with sanc­tions by Congress, in coopera­tion with black protests in South Africa . . . will bring the white regime to the negotiating table sooner rather than later.''

Walk into the periodical center, go to the farthest shelves, by the window. On the fourth row from the front, on the second shelf down you will find Fidelity magazine. 
Robert Hennig 
guest column 

What is surprising is that the library has chosen to include Fidelity maga­zine in the theology section instead of the fiction area. 
Jerry Walls, in his inciteful opinion of three types of Catholics in last week's Observer mentions his reading of Fidelity as a source of his education in "the ways of the Roman Catholic Church." 
Unfortunately, people such as E. Mi­chael Jones, editor of Fidelity, do not truly know what it means to be ''Cat­holic." 
In the past few months, Jones has seen fit to criticize Notre Dame Theol­ogy PrGfessor Father Richard McBrien (December), University President­Elect Father Edward Malloy (January), and the recent debate be­tween Father Dan Maguire of Mar­quette and Notre Dame Theology Pro­fessor James Burtchaell (March). 
Curiously, quotations from The Ob­server appear often in criticisms made by Jones. 
It is also interesting that Jones' Fidelity and other publications such as "The Wanderer" insist upon chastising dissenters in the United States. For it is in their vigilance to point out the non­Catholicity of dissenters that their own non-Catholicity becomes apparent. 
But how can people who follow every doctrinal statement and every papal encyclical to the letter not be Catholic? 
Simply by the attitude of their obedience. An air of self-righteousness wholely inappropriate with the Chris­tian witness is the main distinguishing feature I have found among the "guar­dians of the faithful." 
Some letters to Fidelity magazine it­self testify to this truth. In the February issue, an anonymous 
reader addresses the point: ''You are revealing little-known scandals seen in your brothers (and Mother Church), the frightening positions of so-called Catholic press; but I don't perceive the .flens dico ('I say it with tears') attitude (Phil. 3:18), and you don't seem to ask your readers to join in a crusade of prayer for the malaise you show so forcefully.'' 
The issue here is not whether their challenges have any merit or not it is in the manner they perform their chal­lenge. It's not what they're saying, it's how they say it. 
It is so easy to point out the errors in others, but a more difficult task is to do so humbly and more difficult still to not do it at all. 
I am not defending those dissenters that normally come under the wrath -Curren, Kueng, et al. -but nor am I condemning them. 
I wonder if the Catholic church can encompass both viewpoints. Can the church have two sons wno nate each other? 
I really don't know. 

But we should try to reach some degree of understanding.
Maybe some dissenters fall of short doctrinal fidelity (a point made by simply calling them dissenters), but those who are so quick to criticize dis­play no sense of Catholic spirituality. 
What would Jones say to Jesus? 
Jesus consistently violated those le­gal norms of the day, attacking those "knitpickers" who pondered the minutest question of the Law while ig­noring their own spiritual needs. 
I really can sympathize with Jones. Some positions taken in the name of "progress" in the Catholic church are neither progressive nor Catholic. 
But if Jones and his ilk have a com­plaint, they should make it with a shade of sorrow at having to speak against their brothers and sisters in Christ. Compassion seems-to be an appropriate word. 
Unfortunately, I just don't see that.

Respect for Memorial reason for reception 
Dear Editor: 
Perhaps the reason why Archdruid Mark McLaughlin and his hooded friends received such a poor welcome during An Tostal has nothing to do with conformity, but rather with respect. 
The Peace Memorial is a monument to more than 500 fallen sons of Notre Dame, the victims of three wars. It serves as a reminder that the price of war is too great -even for "hypocriti­cal" and "conforming" students -to pay once again. To use the Peace Memorial for torch-burning, play-acting Druid idiocy is inexcusable as well as sicken­ing. Five-hundred Notre Dame men ­enough to fill Sorin, St. Ed's and Howard Hall to capacity -have made the ultimate sacrifice. They deser~ed better than hooded jokesters playing games on a monument recognizing their lives, bravery, and dedication. 
And by the way Mr. Archdruid, if you think your reception at certain halls 
Doonesbury 
was inhospitable, just imagine what it would be like in front of 500 families missing their sons of Notre Dame.

War criminal subject too self-righteous 
Dear Editor: 
Am I alone in viewing the extradition of Karl Linnas as a nauseating display of self-righteousness? I see two super­powers move against a feeble, old man for alleged acts of terror during World War II, which, if true, hardly compare to the acts of inhumanity perpetrated by both the Soviets and the Americans. Yet these bloodstained Soviets and Americans judge a grandfather, who, as a 22 year old subordinate in a Nazi prison camp, may have supervised the execution of 100 or more prisoners. They send him to the gallows and call it justice. But who, I wonder, secures justice in the name of the 15 million people, including my grandfather, who were systematically killed in Soviet 
prison camps before, during and after the losing team. Unfortunately for him Linnas' supposed acts of barbarity? the winners decide what is and what is Who troops about with ritheous indigna­not a war crime.

New tax laws to change amount students pay 
Although April15 has come and gone, this story should interest those who are going to the working 
.,
,· world, going to school or going bananas trying to 
'' 
H find a job. That's right -it's never too late to start planning for your 1987 taxes. Despite all the hype about the new lower rates, some students won't benefit much from the new federal income tax rules. Remember all those zeros on the old tax tables for income up to $2,480? They are gone. Now single people are taxed from the first dollar up to $1,800 at 11 percent and at 15 percent up to $16,800. The new laws really sock it to continuing stu­dents. Last year, the personal exemption was $1,080, but this year's increase to $1,900 is not as rosy as it seems. A student who is dependent on his parents could earn as much as $3,560 without paying any income tax in 1986, but the same guy will pay $183 this year. For the ones who decide to don business suits this year, the situation is more complex. People with $22,000 jobs may earn only half of that this

year depending on when they start, putting them in lower brackets for 1987 than in 1988. 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's alumni will pay $2,677.50 on their first $17,850 and 28 percent after that in 1988. It's not as bad as it sounds because taxable income is figured after taking out the per­sonal exemption ($1,950 next year) and the stan­dard deduction. 
The standard deduction is new in this year's IRS booklet. Ifyou're not a dependent on your parents' return, you can take an extra $3,000 out of your 1988 income. 
Before you get too confused, we will pause for an example. 
Lucy the engineer got a great offer of $25,000 from Texas Instruments in Dallas. In 1988, her taxable income will be $20,050: 25,000 -1,950, (her personal exemption) -3,000 (the standard deduc­tion). Her tax, therefore, will be $2,677.50 plus a

portion of the amount of money she makes over $17,850: 2,677.50 ¢ ..28 (2,200), or $3,293.50. What does this mean? It means that Lucy's biweekly paycheck loses $127 to the feds. 
Of course, all the new hotshot businessmen will be looking for the itemized deductions their par­ents received. Chances are good, however, that graduates will not itemize deductions unless they incurred huge expenses for moving, interest, medicine, and charitable contributions. 
How huge? Itemizing won't save a taxpayer a cent unless these expenses exceed the standard deduction of $2,480 in 1987 and $3,000 in 1988. 
So, what can a graduating senior do to reduce the tax bite? First, try to shift income like capital gains to the year of graduation when a student will be in a lower tax bracket. 
Second, if you pay interest to companies like Master Card or GMAC and you qualify to itemize, you should remember that the consumer interest deduction is being phased out: 65 percent of it can be claimed in 1987, but only 40 percent in 1988 and none by 1991. If you want to buy things on credit, oo it now. 
First-time investor's guide to entering the bull market 
By SAM SIEWERT Business Writer 
The stock market is becom­ing an increasingly popular in­vestment alternative. Many stur.lents are using their job earnings to make money in today's vibrant bull market. 
l 
The realistic world of invest­ing, though, is often different I than the ideal conception a would-be investor may have of 
it.
I 
I 
But the investor will find that l investing in the market is not very difficult after all. The first step is to decide how 
i 
much to invest and what level I of risk will be acceptable.
r 
The funds you use in a high risk investment should be money you can afford to lose, although in reality even the worst investment won't be a complete loss. 
Because medium risk invest­ments are characteristically less dynamic, the investor must be willing to have his money invested for longer pe­riods of time. 
Finally, for low risk invest­ments, it may be best to open a certificate of deposit rather than enter the stock market. 
Say you have decided how much you want to invest and what level of risk is acceptable. Which stock should you buy? 
If you've been watching stock market favorites or have received a tip from friends or family, you may be set. 
Another way to find a win­ning stock is to do your own 
Don't waste your time keeping information on 
spending that has no tax consequences. deductibles include life insurance premiums, per­sonal automobiles and business suits. On the other 
hand, records of moving expenses and job-related travel can prove to be very valuable. 
Even educational expenses can be itemized. Ac­countants seeking to enhance their present posi­tions, for example, can cut taxes by claiming the expenses involved in taking the CPA exam or in getting an MBA. Sorry, law degrees are not de­ductible. 
One final piece of advice, don't forget to keep copies of your returns. 
Oh, but that's not all. Payroll stubs are full of details on other taxes. Social Security taxes, for example, will rise from 7.15 percent to 7.51 percent next year. ' Also, many graduates will be astounded by the 
chunk the states will grab. Not every place is a haven like India ta. New York's top rate of 14 per­cent on income i.s a far cry from the 3 percent 
that Hoosiers pay. This doesn't include the slice sales taxes or city income taxes take.

research. Your goal is to find a stock that is worth less than the other stocks in its industry. This means you must research the industry as a whole to de­termine if the price of stock "xyz" is below market value. After some time, the market will recognize the undervalued stock, and its price will jump, earning you a profit. 
Of course your other option is to seek the advice of a full-service broker who has cur­rent, detailed market research information available. 
Once you have gathered in­formation, the next step is to pick a stock broker to carry out your transactions. 
When trying to decide be­tween a full-service and a dis­count broker, you should con­sider the service you need and how much each type of broker costs. 

If you are interested simply in aquiring a security, you will probably want to deal with a discount broker. He will exe­cute only your orders to buy and sell. Ifyou need investment advice, however, and can af­ford the higher rates, then you should sign up with a full ser­vice broker. 
The rate differences between discount and full service brokers are not as great as in the past. Competition between the two types of brokers has caused prices to fall. 
After you set up an account with a broker you are ready to buy and sell stocks.

month of February. After Western Kentucky blew out Notre Dame in the opening round of the Coca-Cola NIT Classic, some wrote off the Irish for the season. As February began with the Carolina game, the Irish stood at 11-5, and not many gave them a chance to get past the No. 1 team country. 

But then the miraculous up­sets which have been a hal­lmark of Phelps tenure at Notre Dame began to happen. The Irish knocked off the top­ranked Tar Heels, but two weeks later, following two­straight road losses, the Irish were 13-7. They wouldn't lose again in the regular season. 
First the Blue Devils of Duke fell, followed by an upset of No. 4 DePaul. Phelps had primed his squad, and it responded. He said before the Duke game that freshman Joe Fredrick would be a factor and worked with him on his free-throw shooting. Sure enough, Fredrick came off the bench in overtime to hit a jumper and two free throws as the Irish pulled off another improbable upset. 

Before the DePaul game, Phelps guaranteed a classic, and it was. The Irish took it right to the Blue Demons and came out with a 73-62 win. 
In the NCAA's, the Irish beat Middle Tennessee St., 84-71, and Texas Christian, 58-57, in the East sub-regionals, but then fell to revenge-minded North Carolina, 74-68. Still, it was a superb season for a team that graduated four seniors the year before. 
"What I liked the most about this team was that it didn't know how to lose," said Phelps, whose record at Notre Dame stands at 325-146. "Whatever it took, this team did the things it had to rio to win. The kids 
never quit."

Krause Award nominees boast impressive campaigns 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
Several individuals have turned in outstanding perfor­mances for Notre Dame ath­letics this year. 
While only three can be honored with the Edward W. "Moose" Krause Award, pre­sented by The Observer sports staff to the outstanding male athlete, female athlete and coach, many more deserve spe­cial recognition for their achievements. 
Bruce 'Tiger' McCourt, a sophomore local from South Bend, tallied 16 goals and six assists for the Irish soccer team in its 13-7-2 season. He put the punch back into Notre Dame's offensive attack with five game-winners and two hat tricks during the season. 
The transfer from Holy Cross Junior College was among the

assist, the Irish won. 
Last fall, Steve Beuerlein turned in the best performance of his four years at the helm of the Notre Dame football of­fense. The senior quarterback from Fullerton, Calif., and four-year starter broke nearly every Irish passing record, in­cluding the most career pass­ing yards in the season-opener against Michigan and the all­time total offense mark, previ­ously held by Joe Theismann, against Navy. 

Beuerlein was one of the na­tion's leaders in passing effi­ciency, thanks in part to his 102 consecutive pass attempts without an interception mid­way through the season, includ­ing a career-high 39 attempts against eventual national champion Penn State. 
Beuerlein's favorite target, flanker Tim Brown, also had a stellar year on the gridiron for Notre Dame. The junior from Dallas, Tex., was among the nation's top five players in all­purpose yards per game for most of the season, averaging well over 150 a contest. 
Mary Kay Waller led the vol­leyball team with her powerful net play to a 33-7 record, its best season ever. The sophomore from Lawrence, Kan., ranked among the nation's top ten leaders in kill percentage and blocks per game for much of the season, and was named to the first-team North Star Con­ference squad. 
Corrine DiGiacomo, a senior captain from Rosemont, Pa., set the Notre Dame career scoring record in field hockey with a penalty shot goal against Southwest Missouri in Septem­ber. DiGiacomo missed the final nine games of the season with a knee injury, but tallied 15 goals and two assists to lead the Irish in scoring. 
Art Lambert coached the Notre Dame volleyball team to a an outstanding 33-7 record, a huge improvement from last year's 12-19 mark. Lambert's squad set several team records, perhaps the most im­pressive being their 17-game 
stretch  of  wins  midway  
through the season.  
Yves  Auriol,  in  only  his  

second year as mentor of the Notre Dame women's fencing team, coached the Irish to the first-ever National Champion­ship for a Notre Dame women's team. 
Under Auriol, a native of France, the women's fencing team has seen two consecutive undefeated seasons.

The Observer Thursday, April 30, 1987 -page 12 

Coach 
continued/rom page 12 
quotes. 
This is one writer who is going to miss those days. 'Mary D.' has resigned and decided to return to school at Northwes­tern lwhere she used to coach) to pursue a masters degree in business administration. 
There are probably a lot of coaches who refer to their players as their own children. But I wonder how many other coaches treated their players that way in every aspect of life. And the energetic DiStanis­lao's willingness to lend a bel­ping hand to each and every one of her players is only half the story. The numbers tell the other half pretty much for themselves. 
A career record of 204-109 over 12 years. When she took over the job at Notre Dame, the Irish program made a leap from AlAW Division III status to an NCAA Division I squad.

.l 
Since then, she has registered \ three 20-win seasons in seven 1 years and guided Notre Dame 
to a third-place finish at the 
Women's National Invitation 
Tournament in 1985-86 with a 
23-8 mark. Many thought the 
Irish should have received a 
bid to the NCAA Tournament 
that year. 
''The opportunity to go to Northwestern was more or less an offer I couldn't refuse," said the 36-year-old DiStanislao, who hopes one day to become an athletic director. ''The deci­sion has no bearing on how I feel about Notre Dame. I love this place and I always have. I feel very strongly about the job we've done, I feel we're in a good position to continue along a successful path, and it's a cinch to say I'm going to miss this place.'' 
The Irish were 6-15 and had just been trounced, 90-55, at the hands of Tennessee at one point in this past season. Three players had quit the team, leaving no seniors and no cap­tain. So what did DiStanialso do? She gave her players a choice. They could either go out in embarrassing fashion or they could start playing some basketball.

They chose the latter, win­ning the last six games of the season when they weren't given much of a chance, and finishing the campaign with a 12-15 record. 
Then, nine days ago and ex­actly seven years after she was named head coach for the Irish, DiStanislao decided to call it quits. While she told her story at a rather quiet press confer­ence, her players gathered to­gether with long faces. 
"It was definitely her who kept the team together in some hard times," said junior point guard Mary Gavin. "She's helped me from day one and we were all really upset that she wasn't going to be coaching next year. But we're also really happy for her because she's doing what she really wants to do. I think it's a good decision for her, no matter how much she'll be missed." 

As of yet no decision has been made as far as a replacement is concerned. The only thing anyone seems to know for sure is that DiStanislao is on her way to Northwestern. 
A couple of days ago the same reporter stopped by the basketball offices in the ACC just to say 'hello.' Or is it 'good­bye?' 
This time it was very differ­ent, however. The lobby was the same, but the similarities ended there. In the hallway were a number of large moving boxes. DiStanislao was not busy with a player in her office. In fact, she wasn't even in her office. Not much else was either. It's amazing what you can fit in moving boxes. 
DiStanislao was in Irish as­sistant coach Caren Truske's office with Truske and the other assistant coach, Bill Fen­nelly. They weren't talking hoops. They were sitting back, talking about the evening's WWF wrestling card. 
I had to laugh. I finally catch her at a time when she isn't busy, and I don't need an inter­view. Oh well. Maybe some other time. Hopefully some other time. 
But enough of these stories. Good luck Coach D. We'll miss you.
