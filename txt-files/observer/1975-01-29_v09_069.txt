Gives more power 

Radical SLC changes proposed 
by Mary Reher Staff Reporter 

Frustration due to SLC powerlessness sparked SBP Pat McLaughlin to propose radical changes in the SLC structure. 
The proposals unveiled at the SLC meeting last night involve giving the SLC power to override vetoes by the University President or the reduction of the mem· bership of the SLC to six. 
"Students have had no interest in the SLC for the past year and a half," stated McLaughling. "Also anything that is ever passed through the university can be passed without the SLC. Either we must make it worthwhile with the power to override a veto or cut it down in membership." 
Dr. Walter Nicgorski stated, "The veto proposal was not, I believe, a serious proposal and doesn't warrant a serious evaluation, because a number of those voting for it said they were doing so out of frustration. It is understandable because of a long period of time with no response on the sex ruling discussed last semester." 
Dr. Robert Ackerman said that if the purpose of the veto proposal was to show student frustration because they're not listened to or responded to, he feels there is a better vehicle to communicate this than using shock treatment. "The days of confrontation are over and that kind of confrontation is not practical," he said. 
"There is not a college that I am familiar with 

where the council has the power to override the 
president's veto," Ackerman said. 
Dr. Paul Conway said, "They were asking for something impossible to give. Even Fr. Hesburgh could not consent to that because his veto is subject to the veto of the Board of Trustees." 
"You cannot ask the SLC to give itself more power," Conway noted. "The best way would have been to petition someone else, such as the Board of Trustees or Fr. Hesburgh." 
Student Body Vice President Frank Flanagan ob· 

served, "The veto proposal, which probably would 
never have had a chance of passing, would change the 
purpose of the SLC to a legislative body while the 
proposal to reduce the number of members would 
retain it as an advisory body. 

Dr. Robert Ackerman: "There is not a college that I am familiar with where the council has the power to override the president's veto." 
"By presenting these proposals, the students showed that the SLC is not working and tried to bring up two possible changes," he said. "The first proposal was important for impact's sake." 
Ackerman noted, "The discussion Monday was helpful; no one could go away from that discussion and forget about it. Hopefully itwillhelp people get in touch with their frustrations after investing a great deal of time and effort without response." 
He also noted that the SLC does not organize itself as well as it could and that the people are not as dedicated as they might be. 
Fr. David Schlaver, director of student affairs, said "Everything we have done over the seven years of the SLC had been approved and we are not talking about constant confrontation. Even though this particular issue may be vetoes, it does not mean the President does not recognize the body's importance and the role we can play. 
"I would hope that the SLC can retain its identity and become the strong advisory board it used to be," Schlaver added. 
Regarding the reduction of the number of SLC members, Conway said, "I think perhaps it would be a good thing but I think a group of six is a little small and puts alot of power into the hands of a few people. It does not give the perspective of a large group of people. Maybe there should be six members from each group; students, faculty, and adminstration." 
Conway also noted that as the council stands now it is large enough to provide members of committees itself. With a reduction of SLC members, however, the committees would have to be staffed by people not involved in the SLC. 
"I am not opposed to a member reduction right now," stated Fr. Terry Lally, "if it would solve the problems, but I don't think it would." 
The biggest problem is non-interest and non­involvement, Lally said, and he doesn't think you can get involvement using a small number of people. 

Nicgorski said, "I do not think the size of the council has been shown to be the cause of any of its apparent shortcomings. Rather, I think the frustrations are due to a number of other factors such as lack of willingness to work on committees, lack of student interest. and those on the council no longer feel they are leading concerned students." 
"Perhaps we couldtry a small council on a tem­porary basis," stated Schlaver, "Maybe until the end of the semester to see how it would work. My hope is that we are a little more reflective and we may be open to evaluating it. It would be up to the Trustees to change the SLC because they wer e responsible for setting it up." 
Flanagan said, "If we had not spent so much time on the first proposal we probably could have put the second proposal through yesterday. As committee chairman, I was trying to avoid setting up committees to investigate the SLC future because it seems as though we have been putting things into committees and getting delayed." 
Brian Hegarty noted that the second proposal would be decided on soon but, if approved, it probably will not take effect until the end of the semester. 

Both Nicgorski and Conway feel the chances for a member reduction are good, considering the favorable straw vote on Monday. 
McLaughlin noted that the students are trying to make the SLC better and more effective and are open to any ideas to make it work better.

Mangen said that Governor Otis Bowen is coming to St. Joseph College on February 13th, when a forum will be set up to discuss with the governor his views on the subject of alcohol. "We're looking forward to that," stated Mangen.

Being a state school, Purdue University's reaction was sharply defined. "Basically, we had to adhere to the state laws of Indiana," stated Dr. William Grier, assistant Dean of Students. "Our basic policy is no alcohol in any undergraduate dormitory or campus building, but exceptions have been made in the case of married, or graduate dorms and the Union Hotel, which is the campus student center. Once again, only those of legal age can have the alcohol." 
Student Body President John Glunt concurred, saying that "there has been no effort to change anything." "The University seems to be sitting bac\{, waiting to see what happens."

The HPC finalized plans for the North Quad Mardi Gras party at a meeting last night in the basement of Keenan Hall. A discussion of plans for this semester also highlighted the meeting. 
"The HPC has spent a lot of time with Dan Sullivan, Mardi Gras Chairman, to investigate and correct future Mardi Gras problems," HPC Chairman Bob Howl said. 
The North Quad will be sponsoring a party Saturday night, Feb. 1, in the North Dining Hall to kick off the Mardi Gras celebration. All residents of the North Quad, excluding St. Ed's and Cavanaugh Halls, will be admitted free with their meal cards. Guests will pay one dollar to attend the festival. 
The HPC has engaged Eaton Rock, a band from Chicago, to provide music for the party. "Compared to previous years, it is the best band we have ever ·had," Grace Hall President Tom Porter noted. 
Bob Howl explained the HPC priorities for this semester. 

"We are planning our strategy on the school calendar issue and on the housing problem," Howl added. 
Several members of the HPC also commented on the proposed change in the role of the Student Life Council. 
"The SLC cannot decide on major issues. They have too many committees," Cavanaugh President Tom Hogan stated. 
"The SLC is made up of faculty members, ad­ministrators and students and is there to represent the Notre Dame community. For this reason, I agree with Pat McLaughlin that the SLC should have more power," Hogan noted. 
Dillon Hall President Elton Johnson noted that the HPCis currently the "most influential body that is organizing to get more done," He agreed that the SLC should be given more power. 
Fisher Hall President Rich Morton commented on the widely-publicized Flanner expulsions. "It is indeed

Carpeting ends controversy at SMC dining hall 
The controversy over the issue of carpet installation in the SMC Dining Hall has apparently ended. Work on installing the carpet was due to be completed today. 
Opposition to carpeting the dining hall surfaced in October when Patrice Rooney sponsored a petition questioning the prac­ticality and advisability of the carpet. Rooney suggested that funds allocated for the carpet would be better spent on expanding the school's sports program and improvoing educational facilities. 
The petition arrived at the Student Affairs Office too late, however. as the carpet for the dining hall, as well as new car­peting for the residence halls, had already been ordered. 
Stevie Wernig, Assistant to the V -P for S.A., said that the car­peting was suggested by a student and was discussed by the Ad. Hoc. Committee on Student Lifestyles of the Board of Regents. A student member of the committee, however, stated she did not recall the subject of dining hall carpeting specifically being discussed. 
Legislative Commissioner Joanne Garrett stated, "At first, I viewed the carpeting with prejudice, thinking spaghetti sauce would be ground into it at every turn. Now I can only hope it'll work out since it is installed." 
Saga Manager Charles Flaim stated that carpeting has been an asset in every school cafeteria in which he has worked. He listed saving on the cost of cleaning and noise reduction as the carpet's primary virtues. 
SMC Law Society elects new officers 
by Teresa Kerley Staff Reporter 

January 26th marked the first anniversary of the St. Mary's Law Society. The first set of officers retired having seen the society grow from just a handful of students to its present membership of forty-eight. 
Looking back on its initial year, outgoing President Marikaye Flyke, ('75) noted that with the help of faculty advisor Dr. Deanna Sokolowski, the foundation of the society had been set and is now well organized. Flyke pointed out that the program has expanded to include guest speakers, representing many phases of the law: an excellent series of LSAT prep sessions run by Dr. Donald Miller of the SMC Math depart­mPnt and Dr. Myron Sokolowski, a South Bend patent attorney; and an extremely successful Law Day panel discussion which included several lawyers and state officials. 
Flyke emphasized that part of the reason for the society's rapid growth was that it did not curry just to those immediately in­terested in law careers, but also welcomed those simply seeking to explore whether or not their majors might lead to this field in the future. 
The new President Mozelle De Long. ('76 l is a sociology major working on an internship with the F:lkhart Probation and Parole Adult Team. 
DeLong sees her role as that of continuing the existing programs and introducing new areas in an pffort to give everyone a more well-rounded exposure to the rlifferent aspects of law.

These plans include bringing in nationally known speakers, par­ticipating in short term intern projects in the South Bend area, involvement in community ac­tivities and a solid Law Day presentation this spring. It was decided that to defray the expenses this will entail, a fifty-cent dues would be charged per semester. 
The other new officers are: Jan Schlitz '77, vice-president; Teresa Kerley '76 secretary-treasurer; and Marsha Blythe '77, publicity chairwoman. 
Even with the great response the society has enjoyed, new mem­bers, in any major are always wtlcomed, Kerley noted. 
So in this second year, with the support of all involved, the society is confident that it can continue to provide a much needed service for St. Mary's students she added.

Mardi Gras bussing continues 
by Maureen Flynn Staff Reporter 

Saturday, February 1, will witness the opening of the Mardi Gras activities for 1975. The raffle, the booths, the gambling--all the traditional trappings of past festivals will once more be in evidence. 
And, as in past years, women from various Midwest colleges have been invited to attend the celebration. On Saturday morning the buses will again arrive and their passengers will disembark, to board the buses again on Sunday and return to their respective schools. 
The attendance of Midwest college women at last year's Mardi Gras festivities was followed by the famous "cattle-drive" con­troversy. The resentment of some Notre Dame women to the "shipping in" of "outsiders", and the decision of Student Affairs to terminate that practice left serious doubts as to whether or not any of the women's colllges would be invited this year. 
Nevertheless approximately 350 women from Xavier, Madonna, St. John's, Rosary, Mt. Mary, St. Mary-of-the-Woods, Alverno, Mundelein, and Mercy colleges will be present this weekend at invitation of Zahm, Grace, Keenan and Stanford residence halls. 
All those involved in the matter, 
however, are anxious that the 
women's presence not be in­
terpreted as a slight to the women 

On Feb. 2 
SHARE reopens student center 
Realizing the need for a more totally involved community, a group of St. Mary's and Notre Dame students have organized a new student counselling service and information center called 
S.H.A.R.E. <Student Help and Hesource Endeavor).
SHARE is totally directed and operated by students; confidential peer counselling is provided by trained student volunteers. A listening center and an outreach program are the two distinct facets. 
The walk-in listening center is for students who want to discuss a problem or who want to talk about just anything. "Listeners" who have completed the SHARE training sessions are there to listen and to suggest alternative courses of action. 
All information is kept in the strictest of confidence. Those who don't wish to talk face-to-face can call the hotline at 4311. 
The center is located in room 15, in the basement of Holy Cross Hall at St. Mary's. Beginning February 2, SHARE will reopen for second semester, from 8:00 to 12:00 from Sunday through Thursday, and from 8:00 to 2:00 on Friday and Saturday nights. Both Notre Dame and St. Mary's students are en­couraged to take advantage of this service. 
SHARE volunteers have com­pleted training in such areas as 

sensitivity, munication  listening skills,  and com­crisis in­ 
tervention,  human  sexuality,  

drugs, alcohol, academic and social adjustments, and referrals. 
Training is provided byprofessional counsellors, health service personnel, and volunteers 

of keeping alumnae represen­tatives well informed and up to date about the college. "It's a lot different than it was ten and twenty years ago," said Davis. Also of major concern will be problems encountered by clubs regarding memberships and communications. 
Meetings will be held through the week with the administration, student government officials and representatives from the ad-
of Notre Dame. 
"If the situation were reversed," said Keenan Hall president Biff King, "and a bunch of other men were being shipped in, I'd probably feel slighted, like we were inferior or something. I believe, though, that this thing will phase out in a few years." 
King pointed out that no specific activities or direct plans have been made for the visitors, as in years past. 
"The other girls are sidelight to the Notre Dame girls," remarked Dave Yates, who helped the women's colleges with hotel reservations and schedules. "There's no need for competition. The other colleges have always come at Mardi Gras, but this is the last official year of it. It's being gradually phased out." 
Yates noted that whereas over 900 women had customarily been invited before co-education at Notre Dame, last year's guests numbered less than 600 and this year's less than 350. 
"We refused some colleges' requests to attend this year," said Yates. "Those that are coming are the traditional schools that have always come in the past." 
Commenting on attitudes similar to those which surfaced during last year's controversy, Farley Hall president Donna Crowley stated, "It creates a bad atmosphere and puts a damper on Mardi Gras. It subdues things . We want to avoid that this year."

alumna.' Freshmen now complain of limiting curfew hours during first semester. In the late fifties all girls had to be in the dorm by ten and lights had to be out by mid­night. 
Opinions about the parietal system were offered by alumnae. Some were in favor of more liberal hours and controls. "If they're going to have parietals, they should be more open. I don't think it's really necessary to have all dorm entrances locked either," advanced one alumna. 
The problem of uninvited out­siders wandering into the dorms was cited. "The girls should be made aware and campus security should. be on the watch for that," said one alumna. 
In spite of all the changes though, it was generally agreed that the spirit is still here, and that 
is what means the most. As one sentimental alumna observed, "I can walk down the same halls that I did fifteen years ago and feel the same spirit as when I was a student. It's changed a lot, but it's still St. Mary's."

the glorious oblivion 
by tim o'reiley 
Venice is a one and only city, which the residents know better than anyone else. When the city's political power was broken in the sixteenth century, they gradually developed tourism, which exploited the uniqueness of Venice, and compensated for the trade lost with the power. 
After spending so much time in Germanic countries, just being in Italy is notably different. It is the difference between beer and wine. Northern Italians are impeccably tailored, enjoy a long cup of cappucino in the bars, and seek what bits of Ia vita dolce that they can find. Even the language seems smoother and more expressive<especially since Italians talk a lot with their hands.) 
Venice carries this one step further. The main part of Venice stands on what seems like two islands, but is really many islands bridged together. The twisted maze of canals and streets that developed is so bizarre. that even maps do little good. To tnake things harder, the Grand Canal snakes between the two islands and is spanned by only three bridges, so finding a way to cross the canal by foot is no certain thing. 
Despite these hazards, the city is a pedestrian pardise. The narrowness and irrationality of the streets, coupled with the canals, puts the car off limits here. It is _ to stroll around and see what it was like centuries ago. In fact, cars seem rude and out-of-place when leaving the dreamlike foot and boat world of Venice. 
The dream is being threatened, however, since the whole city is sinking at an alarming rate. The weight of the buildings and the onslaught of the Adriatic have been at work for many years, yet remedies for the sinking have yet to pass the paper stage. In the meantime, bell towers tilt, floors warp and water laps over door steps that used to be dry. 


In this criSIS, the Venetians hold the fate of the city whose beauty they love to extoll. Restoration projects of numerousbuildings are underway, but these have only a cosmetic effect. If the necessary, radical surgery is not per­formed, Venice will slide into oblivion, while admiring itself with a gold-framed mirror. 
Picture: docked gondolas 
The dream that stirs every Venetian, two gondolas at every dock. A lot of these still cruise the green, and sometimes stinking canals, but only the taxis are still propelled by pole. The rest have motors, and are used for business,since the canals are the real streets of Venice. 
Picture: narrow street 
These are the "other streets" of Venice, obviously too narrow to handle anything but foot traffic. Fortunately, the apart­ments here on Calle de la Madonna, like all the other residences, have inner courtyards. 
Here the residents hang out their clothes, shout across to their neighbors, and put their trash on the front doorstep for the garbage wagon in the morning. For the 20th century, power lines were added on the wall. 
Picture: Piazza San Marco 
Flooded by people. pigeons, and water, the Basilisca and Piazza San Marco remain the center of Venice. When the high tide comes bubbling through the bricks, the people head for the elevated planks, and the pigeons for higher perches. When the tide is out, both people and pigeons come down to entertain each other. The Basilica, in the background, is so covered with Byzantine mosaics and bric-brac, that it is the sort of thing loved or hated with a passion. Though this is the largest, church squares provide the only open space in Venice. 
Picture: buildings along Grand Canal Along the eastern end of the Grand Canal, these are some of the buildings where Venice's great trade was conducted. The architecture poses a mixture of the far eastern influence with the Renaissance. Also, this is the scene of the annual gondola race, one of the most festive events on the Venitian calender. 


medieval themes in a rock s~tting 
by kathy skiba and bill murray 
At 8:15 on November 14 over the ACC public address system it was announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Gryphon." Less than three hours later, the group that had preceded Yes was backstage amidst the remains of a pre~oncert chicken and wine feast, the second stop on a 30 concert tour completed. 
Bass guitarist Malcolm Bennett and equipment manager David Williams, known as "Willie" to the bandmembers, were discussing the effort that goes behind Gryphon's first concert tour outside England. 
Bennett talked about the concept of a warm-up group. "Often, we come out to the audience cold. They have no idea we're going to appear," he cited. "An audience generally expects a lesser rock group for the warmup, but we give them something different. Straight away, we have the ad­vantage." This advantage was quite evident earlier that evening as Gryphon played four compositions, each accentuated by the unique sound of their medieval themes, which seemed to catch the audience by surprise. Instead of boring them with second-rate renditions of-rock songs, Gryphon captured their attention with a new and different sound. 
Gryphon's music is a combination of classical and medieval themes in a modern rock setting. This unique blend is the result of the musical endeavors of five musicians from London: David Oberle (percussion), (}raeme Taylor <guitar), Richard Harvey <keyboards, wind instruments), Brian Gulland <bassoon, crumhornl, and Bennett. 
Each has some background in classical music. This influence was cultivated when they worked as classical musicians in London. The medieval flavor may be credited to Richard Harvey who previously was a member of Musica Resserata, a professional medieval music company. 
Gryphon's relationship with Yes began after several professional contacts, ac­cording to Bennett. Resultantly, Yes heard Gryphon perform, liked what they heard and signed them to perform on their 1974 Winter Tour. Both groups now work under the same manager, Brian Lane. "All their people have been very helpful to us," Willie commented. Grypho~. however, is well aware that the "big-brother" image can be dangerous after a point, and Gryphon is definitely setting out on their own. They have already cut two albums in England, each of which is heavily flavored with their medieval sound. Their third album, "Red Queen to Gryphon Three" was recently released on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Bennett told how the group is going about increasing their commercial success in Britain. "Melody Maker (an English music weekly) likes us and gave us good reviews on our last album,'' he said. Now Gryphon is hoping that good reviews of their American tour will get back to England and step up record sales. Eventually they hope to be as popular in America as they are becoming in England. 
Comparing their Notre Dame appearance to the previous night's show in Madison, 
Wisconsin,  Bennett  was  "very  pleased"  
with the performance.  
"Last  night  we  could  tell  that  a  few  

<technical) things had gone wrong. The spirit was there last night, but tonight it was better. It takes about five days on _a tour to get the equipment, that is, the lighting and sound system, working well." 
The style of music which Gryphon plays requires a great deal of equipment and a high degree of efficiency. 
"We work with a lot of equipment that goes in front of Yes," commented Williams. Again, he made mention of the fact that the Yl.'s crew gave them assistance. "We work with a relatively low budget, and all of the Yes crew has been willing to lend a hand." 
When asked about the rigors of a tour that has 30 shows in 34 days, Bennett maintained that it is "just a matter of surviving." Being their first trip outside of Britain, the ex­perience seemed to make them a bit more apprehensive. "It's really freaky to imagine what it's going to be like," Bennett remarked. "We'll return to England around Christmas time and then take a little time to relax." 
Today Gryphon is back in England, their pace a bit slower than that of the recently 
completed  American tour,  they  are  con­ 
templating  their  next  venture  of  their  
musical development.

Speakers for the 1975 Sophomore Literary Festival will include novelists James T. Farrell, James Purdy, and Tillie Olsen and poets Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Robert Bly, John Logan, Joseph Brodsky and Michael Ryan. 
Contrary to earlier reports, Anthony Burgess will not be in attendance. The festival will last from March 2 to March 8. 
Festival Chairman Chris Mahon said the festival will be more encompassing this year, adapting itself to larger crowds while hoping to involve not only the "literary enthusiasts" but those less serious about literary pursuits. 
The theme forthefestival will be "Reflections" and its goal is "to increase the awareness that literature is more than just print," Mahon noted. 
"The festival offers the chance for the individual student to per­sonally experience and confront if he wishes that basic heart of literature--the writer; and although it may not lend itself 
InPIRG supports "Bill of Rights" for consumers 
by Fred Herbst Starr Reporter 

The Indiana Public Interest Research Group<InPIRG> at Notre Dame began to circulate petitions Monday in support of its utility Consumer "Bill of Rights". The 
proposed "Bill of Rights" would provide basic legal protection for utility consumers in Indiana. 
The petitions which urge the Public Service Commission and the Governor to adopt lnPIRG's proposed rules and regulations, will be presented to the Public Service Commission during a public hearing, February 4. 
InPIRGspokesman Joe Shickich noted," Anyone who has ever moved to a new town and tried to get a telephone installed or elec­tricity turned on or water turned on already knows why a 'Bill of Hights'is needed for utility con­sumers. The utility will un­doubtedly ask the consumer for a deposit -and if he or she is a student. or new in town or lives in a 'bad' neighborhood, the chances are great that the consumer will be asked for an exorbitant deposit, plus the first month's bill in ad­vance." 
The most important points the InPIRG proposal asks for are: no deposits for most consumers, 7 percent interest on the deposits which are collected, 30 days in which to pay bills, 10 days notice to any disconnects and a basic appeal right in case the consumer disagrees with what the utility says he or she owes. 
Shickich said, "The Public Service Commission is currently reviewing their rules. I think we have a pretty good chance at getting our proposals adopted." 
Similar petitions are being circulated at Indiana University, Purdue University at Indianapolis, Indiana University at Bloomington, at Valparaiso University and at Earlham College at Richnond.
