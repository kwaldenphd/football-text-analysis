Compromiseconstitution passed 
h~· .Jim ErlPt' Starr Hl'portpr 

Th(' Hall Presidents Council last night over­\rh!'lmingly approved a compromise constitution pn•senled by Paul Tobin. spokesman for the special, lin··nwmlwr <·onslitulional committee appointed by Ih<" Ill'(' last \\'Pek. 
This new eonstitution. Tobin explained, provides fpr ;1 :-;tudenl Association J<'orum comprised of a Student .\~sociation Chairman !appointed by the members of Ill<' Foruml. a Student Association Administrative llir('dor ((')pl'tcd by the student body), the individual lt;ill (H"<•si<knts. and one representative for every 300 nff l'ampus students. 
:\l'eordin~ to tht• new constitution, the Student .\,.;soeiat ion n1airman would: (1) serve as chief t'x<·eul i\'e officer and official spokesman for the./ Fnrum: 12l st•rve as chairman of all meetings of llw l,.on1m: Cll appoint the Judicial Board, repn•sen-' l;llil'es to the university-wide committees, an·d eom­n•tltePs of tlw Forum: 14) appoint a comtrollerAto tnanag(' tlw finances of the Student Association . .with ;1pprn\'al of two-thirds of the Forum nH·mlwrs. 
Tlw Sludl·nt Asso~iation Administrative Director would scn•t• as the chief administrative officer of the :-;tudent Association and appoint administrative assistants and otht•r persons necessary for the ef­fieic<•nt operation of student services. 
\\'hen asked how the new constitution would affect llw pn•sent role of the HPC. Tobin said "The hall pn•st•idt•nls will still be primarily concern~d with hall lift• •P;ollc•·s. t•nly now they will be in a ·position to control the student government bu(jget and ap­pointnwnts." 

Tlw only provision of the new constitution over which <·nntnH'ersy appeared was the appointment of the Slndent Association Chairman. 
Kim l\1agnottta. president of Badin Hall, argued that llw Chairman should be elected by the student body. "The studt•nts need someone to look up to,". she n•aso1wd. "They also need a single person at whom ilw~· ean focus their problems." 
Sut• Anderson. one of the four Walsh Hall executive hoard members. pointed out that the Forum would probably function more smoothly with a chairman 
appointl'd by and from its own members. "A person \rho has been active as a hall president and knows how I hl' IIPC opl'ra tes will be more efficient chairman than sonwmw who comt•s in cold," she said. 
Con Him·dan. vice-president of Morrissey Hall. t·xplaitwd that the Forum would actually be more representative of the student body if its spokesman \\'en• appointed rather than elected. 
Ill' n•asoned that ''a chairman appointed by the hall pn•sidents. Pach of whom represents the opinions of the peoplt• in his own hall. would better represent the t·ntin• student body than a winner of a general election· ~·xpn•ssing his own opinions." 
( lnly five of the twenty hall presidents present at last night's meeting did not approve the new constitution aftl'r all the arguments \l'l'J'{' aired. Commenting on this display of solidarity, HPC chairman Fred Baranowske said. "Tonight we showed that we are n•ady to accept the responsibilities of student govern­nH·nt a II still remain the most representative body on 
<·ampus." 

Thl' new constitution will be presented before the individual hall councils this week for ratification. 
"Pending approval of this constituion." saic. Baranowski. "lhe election for Student Association :\dministrative Director and appointment of tht Sludent Association Chairman will be held as soon ab possiblP.

Mr _ Edward Hanrahan is the fdrmer state's Attorney of Chicago, and a graduate of Notre Dame. 
The fifth nominee is Colonel

"Of the thirty nominated these are the only five that responded positively to the letter sent out by the Senior Class Fellow com­
•nittee, asking if they could be on campus at this time and that could do it for a nominal fee," said Hunt. 
Hunt added that other people who had been nominated such as Rose Kennedy, John Chancellor, Boward K. Smith, and Henry Kissinger could not make it to Notre Dame. 
"The rest of the nominees simply did not respond to our letter. "Hunt said. He stressed that a big tur­.nout is necessary at the voting to )nsure that next years Senior Class .Fellow award could be given. 
"The election is Thursday in the halls and at the Off-Campus office fro 11 ::~o to 1:30 and from 4:30 to (;: :~o. Only seniors are eligible to vote." Hunt concluded.

"In a previous Observer ar­ticle," Krull stated, "Jim promised to 'explode the myth of Student Union being composed of an elite caste,' but he has done just the opposite." 
"His top three appointments in Student Union itself are personal friends, and two of them have no previous Student Union ex­perience." 
Rybarczyk replied, "I feel that these men are qualified for their positions and each has done a fine job for me so far." 
Krull's third charge is that Rybarczyk has attempted a takeover of Social Commission. As evidence, he refers to recent ap­pointments within the Social Commission being made by Rybarczyk rather than by the new Social Commissioner, Mary Anne Gillespie. 
In addition, Krull quotes Rybarczyk as telling members of the ticket staff that "when I'm Student Union Director, I think I'll 
appoint myself Social Com­missioner." 
Krull maintained that when Rybarczyk informed him of his appointments, he referred to the new Social Commissioner as "only a figurehead," and that he <Rybarczyk) would "keep all tht! power." 
Rybarczyk countered, "I have a 
working arrangement with her <Gillespie) about Social Com­mission appointments. When she is trained for the job, I'll give her free reign." 
In concluding his position, Krull stated, "I hop that enough new people will come to work in the individual commissions to offset the 'caste' that seemingly exists there now." 
Rybarczyk refused to comment further on the allegations stating "I don't feel there are any charg~ to be answered, but I'm happy that I'm getting kickback because it creates interest in the Student Union."

The Senior Fellow 
In lh<' past two years, Daniel Berrigan :rnd William Kuntsler have been awarded 
lilt• Notn' Dame Senior Fellow Award ;11ul their elections to this honor was .r,<fi<'a live of something very prevelant at !'\ •lr<' Da nl<'. 
Tilt• Senior Fellow over these past two \ •··a rs has served as the last stronghold of 111l' lilwral wing on campus. Thus, the 
• ll'<'tion of two "radical" figures was to l!lt'n an accomplishment...giving heed to :Jw wndct that Notre Dame really is a 'ilwra I, progressive university in some ;rrl'as. In a way, it was a collegiate attempt to keep up with the:.Tones'. 
Notre Dame has never presented the Sl'nior f<,<'llow Award to one of its own, hut this vear it should. Father Robert 
1: rifrin ~xemplifies what the award " t•a ns. c;r·ifis nota nationalfigure. He's never " ade the headlines in The New York Timt's. Glory in a material sense has 't'VN rome Grif's way~ All he's ever dorw is say Mass for the winos and street 
people of New York. He's brought Christ 111 to the lives of little children at his ur­<"hin n ass. Grif's been the chief con­r<'ssor, confidant, and soul searcher of <·nuntl<'ss Domers·. He, a man of in­<"rl'dihl<' strength and possesses the in­sight and foresight that many a man 'l'lish<'s. Yl't, he's human and most in portantly, he realizes it. 
Grif's a n·an of the people. He is no ht•ro, no person to ever find himself in a spotlight and that should be the essence of th<' S<'nior Fellow Award. The award is on<' that recognizes a man's contribution to tlw world around him. It honors those who best have served the humanity of this world. 
c; rif's world is limited. The ones that hl' has served are either found on this Can· pus or in his inner city parish that he practices at during the summer. But he has served those worlds better than can lw asked of any man. 
This is the essence of the Senior Fellow and this is why it should go to Fr. Robert c; !'iffin.

Elkin explains philosophy of lit 
by Madene Zloza ~enior Reporter 

Saying that "literature has nothing to do with other's lives, only the author's," novelist Stanley Elkin explained his philosophy of literature yesterday afternoon to a crowd of 200 in the Library Auditorium. 
Describing his presentation as an "ideal rather than a program for my own work," Elkin expanded his theory on literature by strE:'ssing the importance of the n•al rather than the fantasies of lhl' imagination.

Stallworth propGOSeS''ClQSS fund-raising projects 
by Mary Janca Staff Reporter 

Proposing that each class set up a fund-raising project which will provide a student service that the <'ollege cannot supply now because of a money shortage, Monica Lavaugn Sl <111worth announced her candidacy for Student Affairs Commissioner last night. 
"If we could set up a system where students could look back and say, 'Our class did this,' they 
would  feel  a  sense  of  ac­ 
complishment.  Student  
Government  would  mean  

something to them because it then would affect them personally,'' she added. 
Fund-raising projects could inelude social activities such as movies. dances, and hay-rides, she continued. 
A particularstudenlneed which could be met through these projects, Stallworth explained, is a lwttt>ring of the health servies, so

Imagination is a critical facility if it recognizes what is real. If it is used as an alternative to what is out there to create crazy things then you get a kind of chaos." 
Entitled "Literature and the ll<'art Attack," Elkin's half-hour lecture took the form of an autobiographical story that ended with Elkin realizing that he "had been an amateur to life, and was finally humbled by the real." 
Elkin related the experiences of his hospital stay, including detailed descriptions of his doctor, roommate and nurses.

private room in order to "give my 
heart attack its proper respect." 
While moving, Elkin watched his possessions being removed and tried to convince the nurses that the roommate, a "blackened, disease-darkened old gnome," should be brought along along as part of his due. 
While a verbal confrontation was taking place between Elkin and the nurses. a heart patient in the next room was receiving a telephone message informing her of her brother's death. It was at this point that Elkin said he realized the importance of the reality of life and there the story concluded. 
Answering a series of questions about literature and fiction writing, Elkin revealed his own opinions concerning his craft. 
"Young writers put too much weight on their own experiences. Their emotions are not yet mature ~nd they therefore dwell on phony Issues," said Elkin. "Readers may not recognize their subjects as valid."

Regarding his audience, Elkin defined a good reader as "someone who doesn't play someone else's gig. Literature does open up the pores of sensitivity but you shouldn't try to identify with all the t•haracters." 
''I have no notion of my audience's imagination, and I disagree with Gwendolyn Brooks' ide.a that authors shou1d try to wnte for a certain audience " Elkin continued. "I write the best I can and let the reader do whatever he wants." 
"Literature is importantto the artist. but doesn't improve your life." said the Washington University professor. "People can't be forced to read and no one is required to take my courses "
