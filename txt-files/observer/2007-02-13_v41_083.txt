Gas leak causes seven evacuations 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Associate News Editor 
Students, faculty and staff were evacuated from seven buildings Monday afternoon as the smell of gas filtered through the air from a leak near the Hesburgh Library. 
The gas leak occurred at 
1:40 p.m. on St. Joseph's Drive near the Library when a crew on the road repairing a broken water line struck a 4­inch gas line with a backhoe. The gas moved in a south­western direction and at approximately 2 p.m., Stepan Chemistry Hall, O'Shaughnessy Hall, Nieuwland Science Hall, the Radiation Laboratory, Malloy 
Hall, the Riley Hall of Arts and 
Design and Decio Hall were all 
evacuated. 
The water line break was 
discovered Monday morning, ·said Director of Utilities Paul Kempf. After lunchtime, a crew arrived to fix the break and while they were attempt­
ing to fix it, hit a gas line. 
"The gas main was not 
where it was purported to 
be," Kempf said, according to 
the preparatory evaluation the 
crew made of the area. When 
the gas line was punctured,

Election results in run-off for two tickets 
With what she described as two strong platforms, Brown said she was not surprised by the results. 
"I think Maris and I were expecting a run-off," she 
said. "We had  some  pretty  
strong tickets."  
A total of 3,492  votes  

were cast Monday, which was not quite up to Kozlow's expectations. 
"I think we were hoping [voting turnout! would be a little bit higher," she said. 
Allowing students to vote online and at various vot­ing stations around cam­pus, however, was an effective way to encourage participation, she said. 
"We tried hard to encourage voting," Kozlow said. "We had some great results."

Athletics topic for Malloy 
Former president appears on Web cast 
By MARCELA BERRIOS 
Assistant News Editor 
University President Emeritus Father Edward Malloy flew to the University of Virginia Friday to partici­pate in a forum on college athletics, drawing from his experiences at Notre Dame to discuss racial integration in recent decades. the academic integrity of student athletes and the roles of the news media and the federal gov­ernment in shaping the future of athletic programs. 
The "Intercollegiate Athletics: Their Role, their Status, their Future" discus­sion, hosted by the Miller Center of Public Affairs, was cybercast live and might be aired by the PBS affiliates that regularly televise the centers' trademark forums. 
Malloy said in an interview with The Observer Monday that the Miller Center studies American prPsidencies and . public policy issues -and that its interest in intercolle­giate athletics, though seem­ingly unrelated to the center's field. is actually warranted. 
"It was appropriate for a center focused on the American presidency and public policy to talk about intercollegiate athletics

The student body election results were revealed Monday night, but with no ticket obtaining a majority of the votes, frontrunners Brown-Braun and Smith­
Weiss will proceed to a  
run-off  election  on  
Thursday.  

Judicial Council presi­dent Liz Kozlow announced that Liz Brown and Maris Braun received 45.8 per­cent of student votes and Danny Smith and Ashley Weiss received 38.3 per­cent. Since candidates need to obtain a "50 per­cent plus one majority," the top two tickets will compete in a run-off for the position on Thursday, Kozlow said.

Notre Dame unveiled plans last week for a $69.4 million engineering building to be built on land occupied by the University Club, so for man­ager Debbie Colley -along with more than 40 employ­ees, members and a board of directors -the news means preparing to say goodbye. 
University officials notified the privately owned Club and its board of directors in a Jan. 9 letter they would need to vacate the building by Aug. 31 to make room for the new Stinson-Remick Engineering Hall.

Coatimundi taken away from owner 
RIVERSIDE, Calif. -An exotic animal with a long snout, bear-like claws and a tail like a raccoon scared the heck out of some narcotics investiga­tors searching a home for drugs. 
Riverside County sher­iff's investigators said the "strange looking," "sloth­like" animal emerged from its hiding place in the Lakeland Village home on Saturday. 
It was eventually identi­fied as a coatimundi, usu­ally found in the forests of Central and South America. 
Possessing a coatimundi is illegal in California without a license, and fish and game ofncial Kyle Chang said the animal's owner, 29-year-old Norman James Vollan, will have to give it up to a zoo or to someone with an exotic animal license. In the meantime, the animal was taken to an undis­closed animal sanctuary.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Group considers new wage hikes 
By LIZ HARTER 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's senior Chelsea Gulling visited the Board of Governance (BOG) to discuss the living wage campaign and how it pertains to Saint Mary's hourly wage workers Monday night. 
The issue of increasing the hourly wage at Saint Mary's will be discussed at the February Board of Trustees meeting. Gulling wanted to present her research to BOG so it could endorse the increase. 
"In 2006, Saint Joseph's County did a survey of wages and figured out where people fall in the continuum," Gulling said. "Hourly wage workers are in the lowest twenty per­cent." 
If the Board of Trustees were to vote to implement a plan to raise wages over a three-year period, it would put Saint Mary's workers in the 40th percentile and employees who have worked at Saint Mary's for 25 years would be in a higher percentile. 
Gulling did not know details of Saint Mary's wage plans or the specifics of the Board of Trustees vote. 
"Basically, just to summa­rize, we're looking for student support," student body presi­dent Susan Mcllduff said. 
The group voted to table the issue until further information is gathered on the subject. 
BOG also voted to award a $500 co-sponsorship to the Saint Mary's theater depart­ment to help finance its upcoming trip to New York City.

Reporter talks about Iraq vvar, Katrina 
Sarah Childress advises students on findi_ng journalism internships 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 
When Sarah Childress began her freshman year at Notre Dame, she had no plans to pur­sue journalism. But she started writing for Scholastic, and since graduating in 2003, Childress has covered both the war in Iraq and Hurricane Katrina for Newsweek magazine. 
Childress returned to campus Monday to speak to journalism students about her experiences and gave advice about breaking into the profession. 
As a national affairs reporter for Newsweek, Childress described her job as "exciting," because she can walk into work Monday morning and be assigned a story that may take her to another state the next day. 
Besides traveling across the country, Childress completed several reporting stints in Iraq -an opportunity she said she never thought she'd receive. 
· "I had always really wanted to go cover the war, but it just seemed like something that would be impossible for a reporter so young and with less experience," Childress said. 
But when Newsweek needed more correspondents, Childress volunteered for the assignment. 
A year passed before she actu­ally went to Iraq, Childress said, because she had to undergo preparations to enter the war­torn country, including a week-long training camp on surviving hostile environments. 
Newsweek is the only news organization that has a house in Iraq's green zone, Childress said, but "it is so dangerous right now that you don't leave the house." 
That confinement, she said, makes reporting "very frustrat­ing." 
Most of the interviewing has to be done by Newsweek's Iraqi staff members because many Iraqis are afraid to talk to Westerners. To get its reporting done, the Newsweek team gives its Iraqi staffers a list of ques­tions and sends them off -a difficult process, Childress said, since they aren't trained journal­ists. 
Staff members often fail to ask follow-up questions and are not persistent in contacting sources. To make up for this, Childress said she has to provide a very specific list of questions for the interviewers. 
Childress was most surprised by the real -and random ­dangers that she saw in Iraq. 
"I was really surprised by how bad it actually is," Childress said. "You know the risk. You know the danger when you go over there, but it's impossible to actually understand until you're over there. It's kind of the ran­domness of the violence. War isn't constant attacks. It's a little more intermittent." 
Childress also left· New York for New Orleans to report on Hurricane Katrina. 
"The assignment was just sort of go and cover it. They didn't give us instructions," she said. "My job was to cover the people. Who was left? What was hap­pening to them? How were they surviving?" 
Without strict guidelines, "you kind of make it up as you go along," Childress said. "You find somewhere to start, pick up that thread, and you just follow that thread wherever it takes you." 
During the question and answer portion of Childress' talk, students asked about jour­nalism internships and the jour­nalism profession. 
"The hardest thing about get­ting into the business is getting your foot in the door," Childress said. 
Childress called her local paper several times to pursue an internship when she was in col­lege. "You really do need to be persistent. Take advantage of any contact that you have," said Childress, explaining that many journalism jobs are not posted on job boards. 
'The best thing you can do is get exposure to other journalists and talk to them," she said. 
While some may fear job cuts in the news and media profes­sion, Childress said the news will always be necessary. 
"People are always going to need a reliable news source," she said. "They need good, tal­ented journalists who are ethi­cal."

There were no injuries as a result of the incident. Notre Dame Associate Vice President for News and Information Don Wycliff said the gas was "not harmful" to anyone, but people were being evacuated from nearby buildings as a precautionary measure. 
"This is natural gas, like you would use in your home. Outside, there are no harm­ful effects from breathing it, as long as we keep a safe distance away from the rup­ture. There have been no complaints of ill effects as of yet," he said. 
Fire alarms were turned on to evacuate people from the buildings, including Stepan Chemistry llall, where graduate student Brian Wilson was at the time of the leak. 
"People went outside, but when the alarms stopped, we went back in," Wilson said. "Then we smelled the gas. and left the building again." 
Faculty, staff and students who were in the buildings when they were evacuated were allowed to n~-enter later in the afternoon to obtain items they had left behind. As of approximately 5 p.m., the seven buildings were available for use. 
The buildings are expected to be fully re-open today. There should be no odor of gas remaining in the build­ings, Kempf said. When tho gas leak was occurring, the fans in the building were quickly turned off so outside air would not circulate in. 
NIPSCO went through each building after the leak was contained and tested the air for traces of gas, Kempf said. Only Stepan Chemistry hall had very low traces at the time.

because periodically Congress, and in rare cases the White House, have intervened to insti­tute reforms when things aren't going in the right direction," he said. 
He offered the 1906 creation of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the urging of President Theodore Hoosevelt as an illus­tration of the role the federal government has played in intercollegiate athletics in the past. 
Roosevelt was concerned by the levels of violence, serious injuries and deaths related to football in a given year and threatened to ban the sport if regulations and supervision were not immediately estab­lished, Malloy said. 
"If things in intercollegiate athletics don't go well, presi­dents and people in Congress get interested." 
He also noted throughout his lifetjme the changing landscape of intercollegiate athletics in light of the gradual integration of women's programs and racial minorities over the last decades. 
A former Notre Dame basket­ball player, Malloy recalled there was only one African-University of Mississippi, Robert Khayat, was the other guest speaker. 
"I spoke at Robert [Khayat'sl ini;tuguration and we were on the NCAA foundation board for many years," Malloy said. "When we each heard the other one was the second speaker we both agreed to do it." 
He said their experiences as former student athletes and leaders of their respective uni­versities added weight to their arguments. 
"When you're an insider you don't buy into the totally romanticized view that some people have about athletics or the utterly cynical view that other people have," he said. "You understand the pluses and the minuses because you've been through it yourself." 
Some of those minuses include the scrutiny that young student athletes undergo under the lens of the rapidly prolifer­ating sports media, Malloy said. 
In recent years, specialty magazines and publications, 
T.V. stations and the Internet's chat rooms, blogs and Web sites have tracked student ath­letes and made them household names. 
"This is a huge change in the reality of intercollegiate athlet­ics because when student ath­letes come to Notre Dame, if you read all these materials, you know so much about them

and the opportu­nities for women," Malloy said. "And they both still need work done to be fully implemented." 
He said he accepted the cen­ter's invitation to participate in the forum because he thought it was important to discuss these changes and the future of collegiate athletics, as they are an auxiliary unit of the univer­sity and affect the way people relate to the institution. 
However, he was also driven to Virginia after he found out his friend and Chancellor of the 
proper discipli­
nary treatment given to student athletes in the spotlight, Malloy only said that athletes should be subjected to the same rules and yardsticks as non-athletes. 
He declined to comment on the recent controversy sur­rounding former Irish point guard Kyle McAlarney, saying he spoke at the forum about intercollegiate athletics in gen­eral and didn't address specific Notre Dame issues. 
McAlarney's suspension fol­lowing his arrest in December for possession of marijuana was considered excessive by some critics -a result, they said, that was directly related ' to the basketball player's celebrity. 
However, disciplinary issues are not the only ones where student athletes are known to receive special considerations -to the advancement or detri­ment of the athlete's career. 
During the forum, Malloy also raised the question of academic integrity for student athletes ­a cause supported by NCAA President Myles Brand. 
He said Brand's steps to guarantee every member insti­tution in the NCAA protects the impartiality of its athletes' aca­demics have echoed Notre Dame's own decision to demand from every student ­athletes and non-athletes alike -the same academic perform­ance. 
Former NCAA .president and Notre Dame athletic coordina­tor Gene Corrigan attended the forum, among 150 Virginia stu­dent athletes, students, faculty members and outside specta­tors.

"If the storm hits as predicted we know there will be problems but every resource state gov­ernmPnt ha<> is ready to go," Gov. Mitch Daniels said in a prepared statement. 

Layoffs at Chrysler imminent 
Employees fear company's restructuring effort to cut 10,000 workers 
Associated Press 

DETROIT -Chrysler workers have taken to can­ing it the "Valentine's Day massacre." 
They are referring to Wednesday's restructuring announcement from Chrysler, one that some analysts say could cost 10,000 production workers their jobs. 
As workers await the news, rumors fly: Two plants to be shut down; buy­out or early retirement offers similar to what Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. did to reduce their hourly work forces; llat-out layoffs. 
"We hear they're going to call it the Valentine's Day massacre," said Steve Laube on Monday, as he and other laid-off workers reported to "jobs bank" duty, for which they'll get most of their pay to perform community service work or sometimes just hang around the union haiJ. 
At 49, Laube has eight years in as an electrician at DaimlerChrysler AG's Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit, but he's so low on the seniority list that he was laid off Jan. 1 due to slumping demand for the plant's Jeep Cherokees and Commanders.

surrounding community, said Paul Conway, a retired finance professor and the Club's cur­rent president. 
"We consider that building to be a part of Notre Dame," he said, calling the Club a perfect example of Notre Dame cul­ture. 
While Executive Vice President John Affleck-Graves stressed the necessity of the building plans, he acknowl­edged the difficulty of asking the University Club to relocate.

mission. Fulfilling an aca­demic need is more important than preserving a social space, which can be relocated, he said. 
Affleck-Graves said officials worked extensively with facul­ty and the dean of the Engineering School to find alternative sites for the new building, but none were appro­priate. 
University officials have pro­posed the Club relocate to Greenfield's International Cafe inside the Hesburgh Center. Notre Dame leases the current building to the Club, which operates independently of the University. 
But Colley said the proposal to move to Greenfield's is not feasible, given the size of the cafe and the different purpos­es each establishment serves. 
"We were hoping for the Club to continue at another location, if that was a work­able deal with the University, but the one that they've offered us isn't very work­able," she said. "We feel that they want to get rid of us." 
Conway said the suggested proposal had too many finan­cial stumbling blocks for the Club to handle. 
"We would go out of business in a short time [if we accept­ed]." he said. 
Affleck-Graves said the University has discussed sev­eral options with the Club, in 
addition to the proposal to move to Greenfield's. He did not dis­close the other options, but said the Club must first make a deci­sion how to proceed. 
The board of directors is currently working on a 

counter proposal to present to University officials, "to see if there is any possibility in [the University] changing their terms," Colley said. 
"We can't imagine that the University of Notre Dame wouldn't have a University Club," she said. 
Club employees -as well as employees of Greenfield's ­did not find out about the relo­cation proposal until it was printed in the South Bend Tribune, Colley said. 
"They kind of got a slap in the face, as well as us," said Vicki Lodyga, office manager at the Club for 14 years and one of the Club's 33 full-time employees. 
Many of the Club employees -some who have worked

The entranceways are shoveled by hand and then the walkways are done using the College's three plows -two ride-on plows and one that's pushed, he said. 
Every entrance has its own container of de-icer, which is used as needed, but in sub-zero tempera­tures the de-icers don't work very well, Kubacki said. The crew also juggles between being environmen­tally conscious and being as safe as possible, he said. 
After spending the day working on campus, the crew comes back in the evening around 8 p.m. or later to work on the side­walks, especially for late night events, he said. They also always have at least one person working on Sunday. 
Judith Johns, the execu­tive director of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, said the sisters also hire a grounds crew to take care of the roadways and the parking lots. They arrive at various times, often around 2 and sometimes 4 a.m. to work on the main roadways and parking lots, she said. Johns also said that there is a priority list of what gets done first.

Malloy appointed a committee to determine the future of the Club, according to documents on the Club's Web site. Af!leck­Graves was named chair of the committee. The Club's mem­bers were notified of the University's intent to move the Club at that time. 
In response, the Club formed the Committee for the Future of the University Club. The group produced a report stat­ing the Club should remain "as it is, where it is," Conway said. 
This committee gathered more than 400 signatures to petition against the relocation of the Club, including the sig­nature of University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh. 
In 2006, the Club was informed that they would need to vacate by June 2008. The board and Club employees were surprised when they received the Jan.. 9 letter that moved the demolition date up to Aug. 2007, Colley said. 
Conway said he is optimistic the Club will continue, even while a decision on new loca­tion is "still up in the air." 
The Club was founded in 1958. The current building was donated by former Indiana governor Hobert Gore and designed by Robert Schultz, a former architect with the School of Architecture. It serves faculty, staff, alumni and community members who pay a member­ship fee to gain access to the Club.

With sub-zero tempera­tures and heavy snow accu­mulation this winter, walk­ing or driving around Saint Mary's campus has been particularly dangerous.

"I have to leave 15 min­utes early so I don't fall in heels outside," she said. 
Senior Ayslinn McGovern said she has to travel at a slower pace to avoid slip­ping on the snow and ice. 
"It's dangerous to walk more than briskly," she said. "The steps are horri­ble because those are cov­ered with ice."

IN BRIEF 
Bush advocates free-trade agreements 
WASHINGTON -Free-trade policies that make it easier for U.S. companies to sell their products are important to the economy's vitality, President Bush said Monday as he projected a year of goo<} -though somewhat slower-economic growth. 
Bush, in his annual economic report to Congress, made a, fresh pitch for breaking down trade barriers and energizing global trade talks. He also called on Congress to extend his authority to negotiate free-trade deals, a request likely to face an uphill battle in the Democratic-controlled Congress. 
"This authority is essential to completing good trade agreements," Bush wrote in the introduction to the report. "The Congress must renew it if we are to improve our com­petitiveness in the global economy." 
With the United States racking up record trade deficits and facing intense competition from rapidly growing China and India, global trade tensions have intensified. 
Democrats blame Bush's free-trade policies for contributing to the trade deficit, costing 
U.S. jobs and exposing U.S. workers to urifair competition from low-wage countries. 

House acts to install solar panels 
WASHINGTON -Thirty years ago, Rep. Jim Oberstar testified in favor of legislation to install solar panels at federal buildings. Now, as chairman of the House Transportation Committee, he's able to make it happen-at least on a small scale. 
On Monday, the House approved Oberstar's bill to create a solar energy sys­tem at the Energy Department building, with the hope that the project could serve as . a model for all federal buildings. 
"What better symbol than the Department of Energy .itself, to operate on renewable energy?" Oberstar, D-Minn., asked in an interview. "Let's showcase this project. Let's show definitively this works." 
Oberstar's new bill directs the General Service Administration to spend $30 million to install solar panels on the south wall of the Energy Department headquarters.

"The whole house was a

describing how water had

"There was a lot of damage

Allstate disputes the

For anyone who has been in a rela­tionship, the words "we need to talk" bring with them the possibility of argu­ments, insults, honest conversations and sometimes a reconciliation that can sustain the relation­ship well into the future. Uttering those dreaded four words is unpleasant, but it has to be done in order to move forward. 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's have enjoyed a special 

and often close rela-Forward the tionship over the Revolution 
years. After all, Notre Dame was only 13 when Saint Mary's showed up across the street, and their young love strengthened as each school educated one half of a growing community. Many of us have parents from both schools, and we have all heard the legendary stories about students from both schools sneaking through the tunnels to get home after parietals. Notre Dame provided men with a Holy Cross educa­tion and Saint Mary's provided women with the same, and the relationship was one of mutual benefit, respect and affection. 
By the late 1960s, many of Notre Dame's all-male peer universities began to go co-ed or merge with associated all-female universities. Notre Dame began to see the benefits of combining with Saint Mary's, and in May 1971, University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh proposed a merger. A few departments began the merger process and a number of Saint Mary's students enrolled at Notre Dame and graduated with Notre Dame degrees. 
However, in a 2002 Observer article, Hesburgh said, "I said to the sisters, 'You know, sisters, we're using all the metaphors of marriage, and I get the. impression you're in favor of the mar­riage, but two things are missing. Number one, you don't want to take our 

EDITORIAL CARTOON 
name, and numbPr two, you don't want to live with us. That's not marriage."' In 1971, frustrated with a lack of progress, Notre Dame broke off the merger. In 1972, Notre Dame went co­educational unilaterally and the historic first class of women enrolled at the University. 
It has been more than 30 years since Notre Dame and Saint Mary's broke off their ephemeral engagement. Though the phrase was not in usage at the time, the best term to describe the current relationship is "friends with benefits." Unfortunately for the Notre Dame com­munity, the vast majority of those bene­fits go to Saint Mary's. Saint Mary's stu­dents receive the ability to take classes at a top-20 undergraduate institution, access to job recruiters who come to Notre Dame, Notre Dame student sec­tion football tickets (which are often better than those of actual Notre Dame students) and participation in nearly all of NotrP Dame's larger and more organized student organizations, including the University of Notre Dame Marching Band, student managers and the chnerleading squad. In exchange, Notre Dame students get to take excel­lent education classes, occasionally use O'Laughlin Auditorium arid go on the Semester Around the World. 
In October 2005, Saint Mary's student body president Kellye Mitros wrote a letter to The Observer entitled "Separate and Proud," extolling the continued independence of Saint Mary's. The theme was continued with this year's campaign for Saint Mary's student body president, as the Davis­Kennedy ticket "recognize[d] the need to maintain the College's deeply rooted tradition in the sometimes-uncertain future of Saint Mary's identity," accord­ing to the Observer endorsement. 
I'm happy that Saint Mary's students are proud of their school, but in reality they aren't separate at all. Nothing exemplifies this fact to me more than a quote from Saint Mary's student Lauren Sheldon in an Observer article after the Army game last fall. "At my first Notre Dame game before I was a student, I would watch them in fascination. Then when I got to be a part of that, it was amazing. I'll always remember when the leprechaun threw a Rice Krispie treat at me and when we gave James Aldridge push-ups last year when he was in the recruiting section." This sen­timent is not a fluke: In a 2005 Letter to the Editor, Saint Mary's student Christine Herdman wrote, "That's what I love about those boys that make up our Notre Dame Football team." Students from a school whose leaders constantly assert their independence and separate identity also enthusiasti­cally take part in Notre Dame activities that define our identity, and even claim that identity as their own. If that is not hypocritical, it is at least problematic. 
If Saint Mary's wants to be part of Notre Dame, it should merge with the University, have equal standards for admission and tuition and contribute its fair share. I( Saint Mary's says it is independent and proud of it, it should­n't turn around and take advantage of Notre Dame's greater resources. Saint Mary's effective rejection of Notre Dame's otTer ruined its "engagement" with Notre Dame 30 years ago and the College continues to display its indeci­siveness through its students' words and deeds. Notre Dame now fulfills the mission of providing a Holy Cross edu­cation to both men and women, and Saint Mary's should choose whether it wants to be "separate and proud" or a part of Notre Dame. Unfortunately, it didn't do that in 1971 and it won't now. Why should they buy the cow when they can get the milk for free?

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Students urged to attend hockey playoffs 
To the Notre Dame community, on behalf of the Notre Dame hockey team, I would like to thank you for your help in energizing Irish hockey this season. Your support, combined with the hard work of our players, has helped us earn a first round bye in the CCHA playoffs, a goal we set at the beginning of the year. 
Our fans have a lot to do with our suc­cess this season. The atmosphere that you have created in the Joyce Center has carried us to a 9-0-2 league record at home. The Notre Dame hockey band has been phenomenal and the cheering of JACCO's WACCOs in section 6 has made our rink a feared place for opposing teams. As a result, the second round of the CCHA playoffs will be played at the Joyce Center March 9-11 and although we don't know our opponent, we know we will need our fans to be louder than ever. 
I realize that many of you have been looking forward to that weekend because of spring break and the oppor­tunity to leave campus for a few days. Your classmates on the hockey team and I are asking you to hold off on leaving so quickly! The team has appreciated and thrived on your efforts all season long and they need you now more than ever. The hockey band will be there so please join them, wear gold and be loud! We would love to see a sea of gold cheering us on during this important playoff weekend. As with all of the games this season, admission is free to all Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross stu­dents with their ID as long as seats are available. As always, I'm sure there will be some great prizes and I can assure you there will be some great hockey. 
In closing, this weekend we head to Alaska in pursuit of Notre Dame's first­ever regular season conference champi­onship. Upon our return, we look for­ward to seeing you for our last home regular season series (including Senior Night on Feb. 24) versus Ferris State, and then again at our CCHA playoff games in March on our "Road to the Joe" and beyond. Go Irish!

Alternative Valentine's plans worthwhile 
It is that time of year again, people. Valentine's Day, which I'm convinced was devised by a consortium of greedy choco­late and flower companies, is nearly upon us. 
Conventional wisdom Chris states that it is not a Mueller good feeling to be sin­
[Jaily

gle on Valentine's Day. 
Collegian
I disagree. 
For me, Wednesday of this week is simply "the day before my dad's birthday," and that is the way I like it. 
However, just because V-Day is a funda­mentally stupid holiday that probably yields as many hurt feelings as it does happy nights doesn't mean that it serves no purpose. 
This year, I suggest that all single guys and girls, instead of awkwardly calling last weekend's booty call in hopes of a date, try something novel for a change. Find that girl or guy who has always been there for you, because there certainly is one, and take them out. Maybe you've always wanted to date this person, and things just never worked out, or maybe you've only liked them "as a friend" or vice versa, but they probably deserve a nice night out. It's the least you can do after dragging your sorry rear end to them after making another bad life choice. 
I've always felt that V-Day would be better spent enjoying the company of someone you can have a coherent conver­sation with as opposed to someone you find about as interesting as a cement block. 
Yet, in spite of the fact that I suspect many people share my feelings, people still go to the ends of the earth to please their dates, only to fmd that they don't really like them so much when they aren't drunker than Mel Gibson at traffic school. 
Also, don't think that because I'm sug­gesting you take out a good friend for the night means you can skimp on them because your company is already gift enough. 
When you're sitting down tonight trying to flesh out some plans for Wednesday, remember the girl or guy who you can pass out next to, the one you like more sober than drunk, the one you would step in front of traffic for. Think of the person who makes you smile when you think about them, the person whose good looks are matched by their intelligence and sense of humor, the person who lights up your world when they come into your orbit, even ifyou never show it. 
If you want this day to mean something for once, and you aren't already taken, make sure the person you're out with is the one who gets you where it counts, romantically or not-the heart.

EDITORIAL CARTOON 


By BRIAN DOXTADER Scene Ediror 

The European Theater tends to domi­nate cinema, but there are a handful of films that explore the Pacific Theater as well. Here are a few of the most memo­rable and most recent to grace the screen. 
lwoJima 

1. "Flags of Our Fathers/Letters From Iwo Jima" (2006): Like "Tara! Tara! Tara!," Eastwood's pair of films explore both sides of the conflict, with the American perspective in "Fathers" and the Japanese perspective in "Letters." "Letters" is considered the stronger pic­ture, despite its "art-film" sensibilities, and has been nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. 

Burma 

2. "The Bridge on the River Kwai" (1957): David Lean's classic Best Picture winner follows a Japanese POW camp that forces British soldiers to build a bridge in Burma. Highlighted by a bravu­ra performance from Alec Guinness, it explores the descent into madness that accompanies war. 

Midway 

3. "Midway" (1976): A star-studded cast led by Henry Fonda and Charlton Heston highlights this film about the Battle of Midway. Produced in the vein of "Tora! Tara! Tara!" it heavily features both sides of the conflict, though the soap opera dra­matics tended to diffuse some of its impact. 

Guadalcanal 

4. "The Thin Red Line" (1998): Terrance Malick's ethereal meditation on war and nature is set against the backdrop of the Allied invasion of Guadalcanal. It received a mixed critical and commercial recep­tion, partially due to the overwhelming popularity of Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Hyan," which was released around the same time. 

Saipan 

5. "Windtalkers" (2002): Directed by John Woo and starring Nicholas Cage, "Windtalkers" follows Najavo soldiers whose native language became a code used by the Allies. Less realistic than other modern war films, it was also con­sidered less effective. 

Hawaii 

6. "From Here to Eternity" (1954)t'Tora! Tara! Tara!" (1970)/"Pearl Harbor" (2001 ): All three of these films explore the attack on Pearl Harbor in different ways, 
· with varying emphasis on the battle itself. "From Here to Eternity" is a classic, with strong performances, especially from Montgomery Clift and Frank Sinatra. "Tara! Tara! Tara!" was a joint project between American and Japanese studios, which produced a complex, but inconsis­tent film. 
Japan 
7. "Grave of the Fireflies" {1988): A tragic look at the civilian side of the war, this moving anime, directed by Isao Takahata, follows two children struggling to survive alone in Japan during the wan­ing days of World War II. Despite being animated, it is considered a classic, with mature approaches to adult themes. 
Shanghai 
8. "Empire of the Sun" (1987): Steven Spielberg's coming-of-age story is about a spoiled British boy (Christian Bale) living in Shanghai, who eventually becomes sep­arated from his parents and winds up as a prisoner in a Japanese camp. Not a Spielberg classic, it is still a very good film, anchored by a surprisingly mature performance from a young Bale.

Eastwood's latest effort is an Academy favorite 
By ERIN McGINN Assistant Scene Editor 
Editor's Note: This is the second in a five-part series on the 2007 Oscar nominees for Best Picture. 
In a rare filmmaking move, Clint Eastwood decided to make two movies centered around the battle at Iwo Jima during the second World War. "Flags of our Fathers" has an American point of view, while the companion film, "Letters from Iwo Jima" is from the perspective of Japanese soldiers. Although the two films are centered on the same battle, they each have a decidedly different focus and agenda. 
The first film, "Flags of our Fathers" portrays not only the American side of the battle of Iwo Jima, but the stories of the three sur­viving flag-raisers in the famous "pho­tograph. After the photograph was published, and subsequently revital­ized support for the war effort, Marines Franklin Sousley (Joseph Cross) and Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and Navy medic John "Doc" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) are pulled from their units and sent back to the United States to help raise funds for the war effort. The film is told in a series of interviews and flashbacks to both their time in battle and during the subsequent fundraising. 
The film is based on the book by James Bradley (the son of "Doc" Bradley) and Hon Powers. Screenwriter Paul Haggis ("Crash") chose to structure the film around flashbacks, as opposed to the linear storyline that the book followed. He and Eastwood decided this structure would better allow for parallels to be drawn to the current war in Iraq as well as wartime hypocrisy and the manipulated propaganda. 
The second film, "Letters from Iwo Jima," is based on the book "Picture Letters from Commander in Chief" by General Tadamichi Kuribayashi. The film follows various soldiers, includ­ing infantry soldier Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) and General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) as they prepare for and subsequently fight in the battle to protect Iwo Jima. As they realize that they are outmanned and ill-prepared to fight, they begin to question why they are fighting and what they believe their own priorities are. 
"Letters from Iwo Jima" is a nomi­nee for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and has garnered nomina­tions for director Eastwood and Original Screenplay. 
Although the films can be watched independently of each other without any loss of understanding, they do serve as complimentary works. 

Several scenes directly correlate with each other, and seeing one film deep­ens the level of understanding that comes from those scenes when the perspectives of both sides are taken into account. They also bring to light different aspects of war, and by focus­ing on the same battle these issues are brought to greater clarity. "Flags of our Fathers" questions the motives of propaganda and perception and the consequences of those actions, while "Letters from Iwo Jima" concentra­tions on decisions that are made in the situation of battle. 
Both films serve to question the greater motivations behind war, as well as individual belief systems. In both films the characters make diffi­cult decisions where they must choose to follow what they believe is impor­tant, regardless of what their govern­ment or others are saying. Even out­side of the context of war, these are increasingly valuable questions to ask and are not only timeless, but timely with the current state of affairs in our world. ·

Trashy tabloid would be a welcome addition 
Britain's The Sun is a daily newspa­per with the world's highest circula­tion and more than three million copies sold a day. 
This is for good reason, given its focus on sex, celebrities, sports, sex, politics and sensa­tional crime. People 
Bob Costa 
in Britain are unashamed about reading tabloid Scene Writer 
newspapers -in fact, most people read little else. All of the top papers in the country are what Americans would consider just a notch above the National Enquirer. 
Reading The Sun every morning over my healthy full English breakfast of eggs, beans, bacon, sausage, toast and Guinness, I've come to the con­clusion that we need a tabloid at Notre Dame. Please -Scholastic's "The Gipper" is anonymous, usually obscure and lacking photos. 
I know, I know. A tabloid would never fit in at Notre Dame. That's what Facebook is for, right? But since Domers seem to love trawling photo albums and wall posts every night for hours, I think they'd enjoy reading a scandalous newspaper at the dining hall next to their flank steak and stir­fry as much as any Brit. 
Contrary to our commercials, we're not all smiley geeks from some sub­urb of Chicago interested only in God and our studies. I've seen many stu­dents browse the latest on Britney and Kevin at Meijer, and dining hall conversations rarely focus on class ­much more on the previous Friday and Saturday (and Thursday). 
I love The Observer, but no one is 
really that interested in what hap­pened at the latest Student Senate meeting anyway. 
We want the juicy stuff: who is hooking up with who at TC, detailed coverage of quad snowball fights, tips for using Wikipedia on papers and the latest exploits of a certain football player. 
Forget AP stories as well -we'll have columns on Anna Nicole-Smith, JT and Scarlett, and whether University President Father John Jenkins is preparing to adopt a baby with Madonna and the Pitts after his recent trip to,Uganda. 
Forget seemg racy photos of the tramp troika starring Lindsey Lohan, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears jump­ing out of cars in LA in next to noth­ing. 
Under the Dome, we could feature our most noble triumvirate of Jenkins and former University Presidents Father Ted Hesburgh and Father Edward Malloy sneaking into Rocco's for a quiet dinner. Just imag­ine the banner headline -"Popped Collars: JJ, Ted and Monk spotted at spaghetti Yalta!"· It would almost be too much for the boys over in Corby. 
The Notre Dame Enquirer could cover Jimmy Clausen the way The Sun covers David Beckham. The big race would be to see what girl became his Posh. 
The initial time someone spotted Jim Caviezel (star of the Passion of the Christ} it would be "tres cool," as Notre Dame Angers program alums would say. But eventually, students would get tired of this D-list actor showing up all the time on campus wearing the Rudy jacket. The head­line? "Students: Why is Jesus still 

here?" 

Let's also please leave out paparazzi photos of Charlie Weis at the beach. I think we'd all agree some things are better left unpublished. 
For revenue, we could have the Bookstore advertise its fair and hon­est prices. Nothing prepared me bet­ter for the horrible British exchange rate than shopping at our Bookstore. 
In Britain, every day a nice girl who lost her clothes is featured on Page 3 of The Sun. With our tab, we could have a new girl every day modeling the staple of every girl's wardrobe on campus -her favorite North Face fleece. Nothing too sexy, of course. It is Notre Dame. 
As you can tell by now, Notre Dame really is need of a tabloid to truly encompass our sometimes crazy stu­dent life beyond placid Student Activities stories and banal coverage of "that diplomat guy who spoke to your class. Something that is funny, inane and trashy. 
Wait, we have the Irish Hover. Never mind.

SAN DIEGO -Chargers coach Marty Schotten­heimer was fired Monday night in a shocking move by team president Dean Spanos, who cited a "dys­functional situation" between the coach and general manager A.J. Smith. 
Less than a month after San Diego's NFL-best 14-2 season was wrecked in a home playoff loss to New England, Spanos cited the exodus of both coordina­tors and other assistants in firing Schottenheimer. The coach had a year left on his contract and will be owed more than $3 mil-
IN BRIEF 

Time Warner reaches deal to 
sell Braves to Uberty Media 
NEW YORK -Time Warner Inc. reached a deal to sell the Atlanta Braves to Liberty Media Corp. after more than a year of negotiations, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. 
The agreement, which must still be approved by Major League Baseball owners, would involve Time Warner transferring the Braves, a group of craft magazines and $1 billion in cash to Liberty in exchange for about 60 million shares of Time Warner, the Journal reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the deal. 
Based on the closing price of Time Warner's stock Monday, the market value of those shares would be about $1.27 billion. 
Liberty Media spokesman John Orr and Time Warner spokesman Ed Adler declined to comment on the report, which the Journal posted on its Web site Monday. 
lion. 

"When I decided to move ahead . with Marty Schottenheimer in mid­January, I did so with the expectation that the core of his fine coaching staff would remain intact," Spanos said in a statement. "Unfortunately, that did not prove to be the case, and the process of dealing with these coaching changes convinced me that we sim­ply could not move forward with such dysfunction between our head coach and general manager. 
"In short, this entire process over the last month convinced me beyond any doubt that I had to act to change this 
untenable situation and create an environment." The firing was first reported by ESPN. 
Schottenheimer didn't immediately return mes­sages left on his office and cell phones. 
Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips was hired as head coach of the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday, fol­lowing offensive coordina­tor Cam Cameron and two other assistants out of town for better jobs. 
Although Schottenheimer said last week that change was inevitable, Smith sounded concerned, say­ing, "Bo~h in the same year -Wow.

Underdof.( Yates Racing takes 
top pole piaces at Daytona 
·DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -It seemed certain at times last season that Robert Yates Racing was going to close its doors. 
The once-proud NASCAR team had hit rock bottom, and owners Robert and Doug Yates couldn't stand coming to the race track any­more. 
But that seemed ages ago on Sunday after David Gilliland and Ricky Rudd put Yates cars on the front row for the Daytona 500. 
"Robert has got a little bit of a bounce in his step again because he has a program that is working, it is clicking," Rudd said. 
It was far from working last sea­son, when Yates lost his drivers, a sponsor and both of his crew chiefs in a tumultuous year that featured the team collapsing to the point that Yates was convinced he was dying. 
·Chudzinski became Cleveland's offensive coor­dinator, and linebackers coach Greg Manusky was hired as San Francisco's defensive coordinator. 
Running backs coach Clarence Shelman, who's never been a coordinator, was promoted to replace Cameron. Shelman accept­ed only a one-year contract due to what had been Schottenheimer's lame­duck status. . 
Three days after the 24­21 playoff loss to New England, Schottenheimer declined the team's offer of a $4.5 million, one-year extension through 2008, which came with a club­option $1 million buyout. 

Man convicted of hitting
Warriors' Jackson with car 
INDIANAPOLIS -A man who hit former Indiana Pacers guard Stephen Jackson with a car during a fight outside a strip club last fall was convicted Monday in a ruling by a judge. 
Dean Willford waived his right to a jury trial, allowing Marion Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford to ren­der a verdict. She found the 23-year­old man guilty of felony battery and failure to stop at a scene of an acci­dent, a misdemeanor. 
He will be sentenced Feb. 28. He faces two to eight years in prison for the felony and up to a year for the misdemeanor.' 
Jackson, who now plays for Golden State, left the courtroom to catch a flight to Denver, where the Warriors play Monday night. 
"I leave everything in God's hands and continue to work on playing bas­ketball," he said.

Duke unranked after recent skid 
Associated Press 
Duke's Top 25 streak is over. 
Saddled by its first four-game losing skid in 11 years, Duke fell out of The Associated Press poll Monday for the first time since the end of the 1995-96 season. The Blue Devils had been in the media poll for 200 straight weeks -the second longest streak behind UCLA. 
The Bruins' run lasted 221 weeks, from the 1966-67 pre­season poll to Jan. 8, 1980. North Carolina is third all-time with 172 straight weeks from the 1990-91 preseason poll to Jan. 17, 2000. 
"If you do it for a long period of time, it means you've been good that long," Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said of his team's streak that began in the 1996-97 preseason poll. "We never bring it up. It's a nice stat thing." 
UCLA and Memphis are now tied for the longest active streak at 34 straight weeks in the Top 25. 
Duke was No. 8 two weeks ago before losing in the final seconds to Virginia and Florida State. The Blue Devils lost to then-No. 5 North Carolina 79~73 on Wednesday and fell 72-60 at Maryland on Sunday for their first four-game losing streak since Jan. 3-13, 1996. 
"We travel a narrow road between winning and losing," Krzyzewski said. "We were in a position to win, you have to make sure the kids know that. They are doing a lot of things to put themselves in a position to 
win." 
Duke received 150 points, falling just eight short of No. 25 Alabama. 
The Blue Devils will try to end their slide Wednesday against Atlantic Coast Conference leader Boston College. The Eagles (18-6, 9-2) are finally back in the poll at No. 21 after falling out in week 3. 
Florida remained a unani­mous No. 1 for the second straight week, garnering all 72 first place votes. 
Florida beat Georgia 71-61 on Wednesday and won at then­No. 20 Kentucky 64-61 on Saturday in front of a raucous 

record crowd of 24,465. It was 
the Gators' fifth straight victory 
over their rivals. 
It had been 20 years since the Wildcats, college basketball's winningest program, lost five straight games to an opponent. Tennessee was the last to do it from 1975-77. 
UCLA fell to fifth after splitting games this past week. The Bruins beat then-No. 19 Southern California 70-65 on Wednesday, but lost to West Virginia by the same score Saturday. 
The Bruins had to fly across the country and play an early afternoon game. UCLA found itself down by 19 early in the second half before clawing back. 
"I was really pleased with the way we fought back," UCLA coach Ben Howland said. "Obviously it's a long way to come to get beat." 
With UCLA's loss, Ohio State moved up to No. 2 -its highest ranking since 1991. 
Wisconsin and North Carolina also gained a spot, moving up to No. 3 and No.4, respectively. 
Texas A&M was No. 6, fol­lowed by Pittsburgh, Kansas, Memphis and Washington State. 
The Cougars (21-4, 10-3 Pac­'10) moved up four spots after beating then-No. 25 Stanford and California. Washington State is only a half-game behind first-place UCLA as the Cougars chase their first league title. 

Nevada was No. 11, followed by Marquette, Butler, Georgetown, Oregon, Southern Illinois, Air Force, Oklahoma State, Arizona and Kentucky. 
Georgetown made the biggest jump, moving up eight spots to No. 14 after convincing wins over Louisville and then-No. 11 Marquette. The Hoyas have won seven straight. 
~·we're getting better, and our guys definitely have a eomfort level with how we want to skin the cat, so to say," said Georgetown coach John Thompson III after Saturday's win over Marquette. "We're more poised. A lot of times early in the season teams would make a run, and we'd stand around looking starry eyed." 
Oregon fell two spots after splitting games with Arizona State and then-No. 24 Arizona. Southern Illinois moved up five spots to No. 16. 
Boston College was followed by Southern California, West VIrginia, Indiana and Alabama. 
Besides Duke, Vanderbilt and Stanford also dropped out of the rankings.

Andy Reid takes leave from Eagles 
Coach takes time to address sons' problems 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Andy Heid is facing a crisis far tougher than a quarterback controversy or a disruptive player. 
The Philadelphia Eagles coach will leave the team for a month to deal with develop­ments that have rocked his family the past two weeks _ one son tested positive for 
heroin,  another  was  
arraigned  on  drug  and  
weapons charges.  

The team said the leave will last until mid-March.

if he needed to be here for a visit of a free agent," Eagles president Joe Banner said Monday. "He will retain final say over whatever we do." 
Reid, who is also the team's head of football operations, will miss the NFL scouting combine and the start of free agency. Teams may begin vol­untary offseason workouts March 19. Reid plans to attend the NFL owners' meet­ings in Arizona in late March, and will be back for the NFL draft April 28-29. 
The Eagles have 11 unre­stricted free agents, notably wide receiver Donte' Stallworth and backup quar­terback Jeff Garcia. 
"Before any of this had hap­pened, we had finalized our own plans as to what we're going to do and not do with our own guys," Banner said. "We'd also put together our preliminary plan for the non­Eagle players that we could be interested in." 
General manager Tom Heckert and the team's assis­tant coaches will handle the interviewing of playE)rs at the scouting combine in Indianapolis, though Reid might be able to meet with some players at another time. 
Garrett Heid, 23, tested positive for heroin after he caused a traff'ic accident Jan. 30, police said. No charges have been filed, but prosecu­tors are looking at the case. Police have said he could be charged with driving under the influence of a controlled 
substance, a mis­
demeanor. 
firearm without a 

license as well as misdemeanor charges of lying to authorities, simple assault, making terroristic threats and possession of a controlled substance. · 
Asked if this leave could lead to a longer one, Banner said: "No. I don't know if he's coming back on (March) 13th or the 17th or the 18th. That's why that's a little bit vague, but he will be return­ing in and around that time frame." 
Reid has led the Eagles to the playoffs six times, includ­ing four trips to the NFC championship game and one Super Bowl, in eight seasons as head coach. He's dealt with several challenges the past two seasons from the Terrell Owens' soap opera and a series of key injuries in 
2005 to losing five-time Pro Bowl quarterback Donovan McNabb in Week 11 this past season. 
Despite McNabb's injury, the Eagles won their final five games behind Garcia, fin­ished 10-6 to capture their fifth NFC East title in six years and reached the second round of the playoffs. Many considered it Reid's best coaching job in Philadelphia. Players credited his steady approach for helping them overcome a difficult midsea­son stretch and the season­ending injuries to McNabb and star defensive end Jevon Kearse. 
"People deal with circum­stances in life of all different kinds, some more serious, some less serious, some more preoccupied and less so, and are still able to carry on with their careers and their pro­fessions," Banner said. "I think that's the kind of guy that Andy is, that he'll both be able to have his priorities in the right place, do what he needs to do, do the right thing, and also be able to return as the head coach and do the same quality job he's always done."

Pound denounces IOC's reprimand 
WADA head says he's not responsible to group for comments 
Associated Press 
LONDON -The head of the World Anti-Doping Agency said Monday the International Olympic Committee was wrong to reprimand him for criticizing Lance Armstrong last year. 
"This has nothing to do with either the IOC ethics commission or the IOC board," Dick Pound told The Associated Press by tele­phone from Montreal. "Anything I do or say in relation to doping is done in my capacity with 
report filed by Armstrong's lawyer. 
"The executive board approved a recommendation of the ethics committee to remind Dick Pound to take care regarding his public declarations. He should be a bit careful concerning his declara­tions," IOC spokeswoman Emannuelle Moreau said. 
Pound said he felt the IOC mis­understood his role. 
"I don't do anything in relation to doping for the IOC," he said. "All I've ever said is, 'Lance, if the analysis was right ... there may be a case to answer to."' 
Pound also said he will discuss the matter with the IOC. 
'Til tell them with the greatest 
of respect, 'I think

"All I've ever said is,
''I'm responsi­said. "People are ble to WADA, not 'Lance, ifthe going to wonder if the IOC," he analysis was right ... the IOC is serious added. or not."

"Everything I've Armstrong said
to answer to.,,
done has been in he appreciated accordance with some of Pound's instructions or Dick Pound efforts to clean up approval from 
World Anti-Doping Agency sports, but he 
WADA." 
The IOC chas­tised Pound last week for com­ments about the seven-time Tour de France winner, suggesting he should be "a bit careful" with his words. 
A frequent critic of cycling's doping record, Pound criticized a Dutch report last year that cleared the seven-time Tour de France winner of doping allega­tions. Pound said the report was prepared by a lawyer with no expertise in doping control and that WADA was considering legal action against him. 
Armstrong then sent an eight­page letter to IOC president Jacques Rogge and the executive board last June 9 accusing Pound -a senior IOC member from Canada-of "reprehensi­ble and indefensible" conduct. Armstrong asked that Pound be forced to step down as chairman of the doping agency. 
The IOC said it reviewed the 

thought the IOC had also sent Pound an important message. 
"It's been a long process," Armstrong said. "Considering the IOC rarely does something like this, it's a significant gesture and I appreciate it. I hope he learns his lesson." 
The French sports newspaper L'Equipe rep·orted in August 2004 that six of Armstrong's urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO. There was no reliable test for EPO at that time, but urine samples were preserved and analyzed later when improved testing technology was developed. 
The International Cycling Union then appointed Emile Vrijman to investigate the han­dling of the samples by a French anti-doping lab. His report released on May 31 exonerated Armstrong "completely" of any doping infractions.

Cardinals crush No.7 Panthers 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH -A young Louisville team has improved steadily all season and is in posi­tion for a first-round bye in the Big East tournament. Still, coach Rick Pitino couldn't believe what he was hearing about the Cardinals. 
Nothing. No buzz. No hype ­at least until now. 
David Padgett and Derrick Caracter neutralized Aaron Gray inside while Louisville's 2-3 zone defense was taking away No. 7 Pittsburgh's outside shooting, and the Cardinals dominated both halves to rout the Panthers 66-53 Monday night. 
The Panthers (22-4, 10-2 in Big East) sustained their worst loss since moving into the Petersen Events Center in 2002, where they had been 78-7. Their worst previous defeat there was 73-64 to Connecticut on Feb. 26, 2005. They hadn't lost by double figures at home since an 81-67 defeat to Georgetown on Feb. 5, 2001. 
This one was never close, a stunningly easy romp for Louisville (18-8, 8-4) that tight­ened the Big East race. The Cardinals raced to a 13-2 lead that they increased to 33-14 late in the first half, partly because conference-leading Pitt had more turnovers than points for most of the half. 
Pitt ended with 19 turnovers, 15 before halftime, as its Big East lead over Georgetown slipped to a half game. The No. 14 Hoyas beat No. 23 West VIrginia 71-53 on Monday. 
"I didn't recognize that team," coach Jamie Dixon said, refer­ring to how sluggishly his team played at the start. "Some of the turnovers we were committing, I didn't recognize." 
What Pitino didn't recognize was the lack of attention for his Cardinals, who need to win only twice more to get to 20 wins. 
"We had to play Pitt, or some­one like Pitt, because everybody is talking about signature wins and not paying attention to us," Pitino said. "We think that when we go to DePaul confident in this team and this coaching staff. I don't foresee this happening again." 
So much for comparative scores. Louisville lost to Dayton and Massachusetts, teams that Pitt easily beat. 
"How we played is not indica­

tive of this team," Gray said. "But we're going to get past it. Maybe it's something we 
and South Florida and win in the fashion we  "I didn ,t recognize that team.,,  needed to show us how good we aren't."

watched TV, I realized I should-n't coach or play anymore because we don't even get mentioned. The writers don't even mention us for the NCAAs." 
Pitino told his team there was only one way to get that recogni­tion. 
"I told the guys that if you want to dance (in the NCAAs), you've just had Christmas come early because you have to play Pitt _ and you have to beat them," Pitino said. "And that's the hard part because they are a great team." 
The 6-foot-11 Padgett and 6-8 Caracter, effective together in the same game for the first time since early in the season, were too much for the 7 -foot Gray to handle by himself inside. Gray drew his fourth foul with 14:06 remaining as Caracter scored inside to make it 42-27, and Gray wasn't a factor again. 
"It was just a bad day. It's going to happen sometime," Gray said. "Maybe it's better it happened now rather than down the road. The true test is how we respond to this _ not what hap­pened out there. I'm still very 
Padgett, who 
sprained a foot 

Saturday against South Florida and was question­able to start, had 16 points and four blocked shots. 
Caracter, a highly recruited freshman just off a six-game sus­pension for violating various team rules, played his second strong game in a row with eight points and four rebounds. He· had 16 points and 10 rebounds in substantial playing time Saturday after Padgett was hurt. 
Pitt was similarly sloppy for much of its 74-68 victory Saturday over Providence, its fifth consecutive win and 12th in 13 games, but Gray bailed them out with 22 points and seven rebounds. He couldn't do so this time, finishing with 12 points and 10 rebounds, and Pitt had no success shooting long 3-point­ers over Louisville's effective zone. 
Pitt came into the game shoot­ing a Big East-best 42.6 percent from 3-point range, but missed its first 13 shots from beyond the arc until Ronald Ramon hit one with about seven minutes remaining.

Union asks for decision reversal 

Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO-The Major League Baseball Players Association asked a federal appeals court late Monday to revisit its December decision to allow investigators probing steroids in sports to use the names and urine samples of 
If the December decision sur­vives, the players who tested positive could be called before a grand jury and asked how they obtained their steroids.

The 2-1 deci­sion in December by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco over­turned three lower court deci­sions and could help authorities pinpoint the source of steroids in baseball.

The testing was part of base­ball's effort to determinP whether a stricter drug-testing policy was needed. Because 5 percent or more of the tests [or steroids came back positivP, it automatically triggered the start of testing with penalties in 2004.

Arrington released from Giants 
Associated Press 
EAST HUTIIERFOHD, N.J.­The New York Giants released linebacker LaVar Arrington and two other starters Monday in the first major shako-up under new general manager Jerry Heese. 
Nnw York also cut linebacker Carlos 1\mmons and of'fensivn tackle Lu kn Pntitgout. both of whom were slownd by injuries ovnr thn last two snasons. 
The rnlnase of Arrington endnd a brief and unsatisfying tnnure with the <;iants for the former Pro Bowler. who was signnd last ynar for $49 million over seven ynars hut suff<'n~d an Arhillns injury against Dallas on Oct. 23 and playnd in only six gamns. 
"LaVar's situation is unfortu­natn bncausn lw was just start­ing to really becomn a factor in our defense at the time of his injury," Hoose said. 
Heese, who last month rnplacod the retired Ernie Accorsi, snrv1~d notice that lw will not stand pat with a team that won tho NFC East in 2005 but was humiliated in a first­round playoff loss to Carolina, then squoaked into the playof'fs last season with an 8-8 n~eonl and again lost in the first round. 
"These are eli !Tie ult de ci­sions," Giants head r~oach Tom Coughlin said. "But as Jerry and I lookod at tlw roster, thny are decisions we felt we had to make as wo start to compose our tHam for tho upcoming soason." 
Combined with the retire­ment of running back Tiki Barber, the Giants now havn additional salary-cap space to pursuH free agnnts this of'fsea­son. Emmons had two years remaining on a five-year con­tract worth $16.5 million and was to make $2 million this year, and Petitgout had two years lof't on his contract and was due $5 million for 2007. 


Arrington, whose contract was fillPd with incPntivPs, was schedulPd to make $900,000 next season. 
Petitgout started 106 games at tackle and guard over eight seasons for thP Giants, but broke his leg against Chicago on Nov. 12 and missed thP Giants' finaJ seven games. lie became expendable when guard David Diehl switched to left tacklP and played well in his absence. 

Dumping Petitgout's contract could give the Giants a better shot at re-signing free-agent center Sh<tun O'Hara. 
Emmons, acquired from PhiladPlphia in 2004, played in 36 games in three seasons but missed a total of 11 games in the last two sPasons with a pectoral injury.

Happy Birthday: It's what you do to help others that will get you ahead this year. Your actions will impress even your most critical observer. This isn't a year to make drastic changes but it is one to stabilize your current position, to solidify important relationships and to form good connections with people who can assist you when you need help. Your numbers are 11, 15, 19, 21, 33,37 
ARIES (March 21-April19): You could use a vacation or a change of scenery. If you can't afford to take a trip, switch your routine a bit. Talking to people with experience could lead you to a new hobby, vocation or circle of friends. ***** TAURUS (April20-May 20): Someone may try to convince you to spend money or invest in something that will benefit him or her. Be strong and use your own will power to make more money or to improve your health. Now is not the time to be wishy-washy.*** GEMINI (May 21-June 20): You can please some but you can't please everyone. With that in mind, make choices that help you fulfill your own goals. A partnership may tum sour if either one of you is trying to take advantage. *** CANCER (June 21-July 22): Don't trust someone to do a job for you. If you put in extra effort and go it alone, you will be the one to advance. A romantic opportunity is present but don't get involved with this person if it will affect your financial future. 
*** 

LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Don't be fooled by someone who wants you to invest in 
his or her future. You can do far better looking out for your own interests. Networking 
and socializing with people on the same path will give you some great ideas. ***** 
VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Take things one step at a time. Someone may try to 
ruin your plans. If you want al) honest answer, ask precise questions. Your own 
relationship may be on shaky ground if you have neglected your responsibilities. ** 
LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): You should be able to make things happen if you aren't 
lazy, trying to get others to do things for you. Put in an all-out effort. A meeting with 
someone you consider to be knowledgeable will give you some new financial ideas. 
**** 

SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): You'll have the discipline to pull off a deal that you've been wanting to launch for some time now. Don't let anyone stand in your way. Emotional matters must not be allowed to interfere in your progress. *** SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Reevaluate your motives and go about your business with integrity: Being underhanded will only come back to haunt you. A love connection is likely to cause you upset. Don't exaggerate. *** CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Not everything will be out in the open. Don't get taken for a ride by someone painting a good sob story. Do your research and make your decision based on what's feasible. Anger will not solve any problems. *** AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): You can affect people's decisions if you paint an honest picture of what you are trying to do. Someone you love may not be in total agreement with you. Listen to what this person has to say--it may be valid. **** PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Stay calm and don't let emotional issues cloud what you know you must do. A problem with overindulgence will lead to arguments or, even worse, breakups. Look at things realistically: It can't always be the other person's fault.** .

The Irish recovered from a three-game losing streak on the road by winning their last three home games, including Sunday's victory over DePaul. They will try to put an end to their away­game troubles tonight at Villanova. 
Notre Dame's offense will be led by guard Charel Allen, who this week was named Big East Player of the Week for her play against Louisville and DePaul. Allen averaged 23 points and 10 rebounds per game in those two games while shooting 51.5 per­cent from field-goal range. Against DePaul, Allen dropped 25 points and grabbed 13 rebounds in the team's 78-70 win.
