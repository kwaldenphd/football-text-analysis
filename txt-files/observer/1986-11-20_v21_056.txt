Network disappointed by decision of trustees 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI Assistant News Editor 
The Notre Dame Anti­Aparthied Network is disap­pointed by the Board of Trus­tees' failure at its recent meeting to divest from South African companies, but the group said it is determined to keep up the fight. 
"We were really disap­pointed,'' said Margarita Rose, spokesperson for the group. "Particularly since they didn't even take a vote on it. It seemed to take a back seat," she said. 
Last Friday, the Board decided not to take any action on the University's investment policy until May of 1987, when it will completely reassess the policy, according to Richard Conklin, assistant vice presi­dent for University relations. 
Conklin said "There was never a formal vote taken" by the Board. The report of the Board of Trustees Ad Hoc Com­mittee on South African Invest­ment was received by the Board, and then the Board moved on to other business, ac­cording to Conklin. 
While the Network awaits the Board's May meeting, Rose said they will continue the fight against aparthied. She said the Network will sponsor a concert 
on Saturday, September 22 to 
benefit  the  Bishop  Tutu  
Refugee Fund.  
The  fund,  run  by  Tutu's  

daughter Naomi and her hus­band in the United States, pro­vides medical and educational supplies for South African refugees who have left South Africa "because of their politi­cal views," Rose said. 
Rose also said the Network will be coordinating efforts with other college anti­aparthied groups for an upcom­ing rally in Indianapolis. 
Rose said she thinks the Uni­versity will divest from com­panies doing business in South Africa in May, "based on what Bishop Sullivan said," because the University has been follow­~ng what he said. 
In May of 1985, Sullivan said if all statutory aparthied were not eliminated from South Africa by May 1987, all com­panies should leave South Africa and an economic em­bargo should be undertaken, according to Father Oliver Wil­liams, member of the ad hoc committee and professor of management. 
The University's current in­vestment policy, which it has subscribed to since 1984, calls

Reagan accepts sole responsibility for deal with Iran 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Reagan said Wednesday night the controversial decision to sell arms to Iran was "mine and mine alone,'' and said two other American hostages in Lebanon would have been freed "if there had not been so much publicity" about the ship­ments. 
At a news conference thoroughly dominated by ques­tions surrounding the long­secret Iranian arms ship­ments, the president said he had made the right decision despite the furor that it provoked. "I don't think a mis­take has been made," he said. 
At his first news conference in nearly three months, Reagan said Secretary of State George Shultz will stay in his Cabinet post, despite his scarcely disguised opposition to the arms sale. "He has made it plain he would stay as long as I want him, and I want him," the president said. 
Defending his arms deal, Reagan said, "I was not break­ing any law" in authorizing the arms sale or ordering top aides not to provide Congress with immediate information. 
Reagan thus moved to quell a controversy that has not only spawned criticism in Congress but also threatened his own credibility as president. A poll taken after Reagan's nation­ally televised speech last week on the arms shipments re­ported that only 14 percent of those surveyed thought he was essentially telling the truth when he said he was not trading weapons for American hostages. 
Some critics remained un­persuaded. 
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., in­coming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said, "I counted at least seven contradictions from what I have been told by his top aides.

Involvement in South Bend key to student work on United Way 
By MARIA DOTI News Staff 

Giving Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students a chance to involve themselves in the South Bend community is the primary goal of both campuses' United Way cam­paigns, according to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's Chairmen John Seidensticker and Sarah Cook. 
"The (Notre Dame) cam­paign runs from Nov.3 
through Nov. 26," said Seidensticker. "Our goal for the students is $10,000. Father Hesburgh figured with 5,000 students, we could each give the price of a couple of beers," he said. 
According to Seidensticker, Saint Mary's campaign is sep­arate from Notre Dame's. "We haven't planned any ac­tivities together," he said. 
"The Saint Mary's cam­paign lasted from October 27 to November 14," said Sarah Cook, Saint Mary's student body vice president. "We didn't have the turn-out we hoped for. We were expecting $1,800, and we ended with $1,077." 
Both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's have a variety of campus and dorm activities planned. "We're really count­ing on the dorms this year," Seidensticker said.

Kodak to pull out of South Africa 
Associated Press 

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -Eastman Kodak, citing a weak economy made worse by apartheid, said Wednesday it will withdraw from South Africa and prohibit its sub­sidiaries from supplying prod­ucts to this country. 
The photographic equipment manufacturer is the seventh American company to an­nounce recently that it is leaving South Africa and the first of them to halt sales of its products. 
Kodak employs 466 people at five sales and service facilities in South Africa. Ian Guthrie, director of employee informa­tion at the company headquarters in Rochester, N.Y., said 130 are black, 130 of mixed race, about 20 Asian and the rest white. 
Colby Chandler, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement: "our South African business has been af­fected negatively by weakness in the South African economy. We also have no doubt that the system of apartheid has played a major role in the economy's under-performance." 
His statement promised employees "a generous separation package" and re­employment counseling. 
Atex Inc., a Kodak computer­making subsidiary based in Massachusetts, also an­nounced it will pull out, according to a Johannesburg spokesman quoted by the South African Press Association. 
Three major South African newspaper chains use Atex computer systems: the Argus Group, South African Associ­ated Newspapers, and Nasionale Pers. 
Neither the Kodak statement nor company spokesman

Say Aahh. Students at Texas Tech can treat themselves at the school's Cold Clinic. The clinic, which is a part of student health services, has booths in which a student can take his temperature and use a tongue depressor to ex­amine his throat. If students are sick, they can see a doctor on the premises. -The Observer 
Studying is a real headache, especially for some Uni­versity of Texas students who buy class notes from a campus note-taking service. The service switched its paper stock to red paper with black letters to curb photocopying, but it's giving students headaches and sore eyes--and some are photocopying and re-selling the notes anyway. -The Observer

Take a trip out to a mall to see society's diversity 
Go to the mall and see the people. 
I've often thought that every student here should be required to make a trip to a shopping mall once every week or two to watch, for just a little while, the citizens of the real world. 
They are not like us. 

On campus, we are awfully alike. We've been told how homogeneous we are--we dress pretty much alike, do the same things, and sound pretty much the same when we talk (with a few Bostonian exceptions) . 
But the fact that we are so much alike is not the issue. The problem is that we are so differ­ent from the rest of the world. 
Malls are a pretty good place to observe others because malls attract all kinds of people. Perhaps it is the variety of items people can purchase at a mall that results in such a diverse conglomeration of people being there. You see people in the most bizzare modes of dress. You see handicapped people. You may see people who are richer than you, but you will especially see people who are less well off than you are. 
During the last break, I was driving through a suburb near Cleveland. It's a lower middle class neighborhood, mostly a "bedroom com­
· munity" for blue collar workers from steel and 
automotive plants. 

As I drove down the main road in town, I watched students walking toward the local high school. They sported leather jackets, long hair, and cigarettes. 
They didn't seem concerned about Louie, Louie, the militarism of a fountain, or a Vatican crackdown on theologians. Whether or not to go to church on Sunday may be one of the bigger theological decisions they have to face, and militarism is probably considered something that could lead to a secure job. 
On our campuses, teenage pregnancy and drug abuse are interesting issues to ponder. But these high school students have pregnant friends and friends in drug abuse programs. 
Egads, you say, these are our future leaders. No, don't worry, they probably won't be leaders. You are going to be the leaders. But these high school students and the residents of suburbs such as this one make up the bulk of the population of our society. We may not be living with these people now, but we can't forget to consider them. 
It is these people who make up the real world. 
Summer jobs, if mundane enough, can also awaken one to conditions in the real world. When I worked in a discount store and at a bank, I knew that I had better opportunities

awaiting me after college graduation. But the other employees didn't. One of my co-workers at the discount store had started working in the automotives department after high school and had been there for eight years. He had no ambi­tions toward promotion or a job change. 
I had to wonder if someone could keep stack­ing oil filters all of his life. Is there no ambition in people like him, or has their ambition been stifled by a lack of opportunity? 
When working at the bank, I thought nothing of going out to lunch at Arby's and dropping $2.50-$3 for some food. The other tellers thought this was terribly extravagant. Their budgets dictated bag lunches. 
One recent campus speaker accused us of writing off a generation of people. He cited all the blue collar workers who have lost their jobs because of corporate takeovers and plant closings such as the General Motors plant shut­downs. He said these people's chances of ever getting jobs again are dubious because there just aren't that many blue-collar jobs anymore. 
Today, we have the luxury of distancing our­selves from the problems of the rest of the people in our society. We are safe here on campus. But we cannot neglect these people and their problems. We'd best not lose touch with the rest of the people in our society. 
We should go out now and see the people. Soon, we'll have to go out into the real world and live with them.

Saint Mary's to honor day of world hunger 

By ALISON PIVONKA 
News Staff 
In conjunction with a nation­wide "Fast for a World Har­vest" sponsored by Oxfam America, students at Saint Mary's will be participating today in a day of world hunger awareness. 
With the cooperation of SAGA food services, which makes a donation for every stu­dent who participates, the pro­gram includes both a fast and a series of lectures and films on global poverty. 
Cindy Taylor, coordinator of the World Hunger Coalition at Saint Mary's, hopes that the ex­perience of being hungry for one day, in addition to the edu­cational aspect of the event, will move students to action to alleviate international poverty. 
"Hopefully," she said, "it will teach students as Chris­tians a more global outlook on world hunger. It's something much of the world experiences every day of their lives," Taylor said. 
The event, which began last night with Professor Jennifer Warlick's lecture, "The Fer­mentation of Poverty," con­tinues today with a series of presentations in Stapleton Lounge. 
The fast will end at 9:00p.m. with a Eucharistic liturgy fol­lowed by a meal of soup and bread in the College Clubhouse. 
According to Sister Mary Turgi, assistant director of campus ministry, Saint Mary's involvement with Oxfam America dates back to 1980. Turgi, who had conducted fasts with the organization at Wes­leyan University, brought the event to Saint Mary's with the help of the Campus ministry team. 
She said, "We didn't get any money from SAGA that year, because we were late with our organizing. 
"Still, 600 people fasted," said Turgi. "That was a real statement on their part." 
Since its first year at Saint Mary's, the event has grown. On a national level, Oxfam America is in its 17th year. The 12th annual fast, held in 1985, involved over one million people in 2,500 organizations and raised over $700,000. 
Oxfam America is a non­profit, international agency based in Boston. 
This Year's Fast for a World Harvest focuses on South Africa and the Philippines.

Campaign 
continuedfrompage 1 
The Notre Dame dorm activ­ities for this year include the annual door-to-door collec­tions, film festivals, basketball tournaments, and raffles. 
The already completed campus events included Senior Bar Night on Nov.l4 and a "Lock-up" run by Security on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
Yet to come are a 5K Turkey Trot on Sunday, with T -shirts presented to the first 100 entries. Also, the Hall Presi­dents' Council will sponsor an aerob-athon featuring Notre Dame Student Body President Mike Switek and Student Body Vice President Don Montanaro on Nov.22. Proceeds from the interhall championship foot­ball game ("Charity Bowl") and the movie "Casablanca" were also contributed. 
Saint Mary's had several ac­tivities planned for their cam­paign, including three movies during the week of Nov. 9: "The Way We Were" on Nov.9, "Rebel Without A Cause" on Nov.ll, and "Grease" on Nov.13. "It was a pretty good turn-out... the people who went knew it was for the United Way, and that helps to increase awareness," said Cook. Sta­tions were set up in the dining hall as well as posters and flyers in the residence halls containing information about the campaign. Coordinators of the Saint Mary's campaign felt "students would be more likely to give if they knew what they were really giving to." 
Last year there was contro­versy over what organizations would benefit from the proceeds. Planned Parenthood was believed to have been one of last year's recipients. Stu­dents on both campuses disap­proved of this because of its promotion of abortion. "The St. Joseph's County United Way does not give their proceeds to Planned Parenthood," said Mike Switek, Notre Dame's student body president. "Thirty-seven local agencies will receive assistance, includ­ing the Logan Center, Big Bro­ther/Big Sister, Red Cross, YMCA, YWCA, Good Will, and The Salvation Army," added Seidensticker. 
The United Way has proven to be a worthy cause to both the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities.

Study: Tar, nicotine intake tripled by smokers who try cutting down 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Smokers who cut back tend to compensate by smoking more intensely, tri­pling the tar and nicotine they inhale from each cigarette and undercuttiqg their efforts to improve their health, a study has found. 
"Our advice is that if they can, the best thing to do is quit entirely," said Dr. Peyton Jacob III, a co-author of the study. "The next best thing is to cut down the number of cigarettes and if they could, switch to an ultra-low-yield brand." 
In addition, he said, they should concentrate on avoiding puffing more deeply, more of­ten or smoking each cigarette down to the butt. 
The study suggests that by smoking more intensely, people are able to satisfy their nicotine craving with far fewer cigarettes than they ordinarily smoke. This explains why people trying to stop smoking often are able to cut back but fail to kick the habit. 
"Our findings do not contra­dict the proposition that smoking fewer cigarettes per day poses less risk to health than smoking more cigarettes," the researchers wrote. "However, the magni­tude of the benefit from reduced exposure to toxins was much less than expected." 
They also cautioned that their data do not apply all smokers who are trying to quit. Some of them may consciously restrain the intensity of their puffing. 
"However," they added, "our data are relevent to patients who are asked by their physicians to smoke fewer cigarettes." 
They said such people could easily cut back from two packs to 15 cigarettes a day but only slightly reduce their intake of the toxins in tobacco smoke. 

The study was directed by Dr. Neal Benowitz of San Fran­cisco General Hospital Medical Center. It was published in Thursday's New England Jour­nal of Medicine. 
Smoking is a major cause of cancer, lung disease and heart trouble. The American Cancer Society estimates that 320,000 Americans die prematurely each year from diseases linked to smoking. 
For the study, researchers hospitalized 13 paid volunteers who smoked. When they could have as many cigarettes as they wanted, they smoked 37 cigarettes a day. The research­ers measured their intake of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide when they were lim­ited to 15, 10 or five cigarettes

a day. 

When they could have 15 or 10 cigarettes a day, there was only a small drop in their ex­posure to these smoke toxins. At five cigarettes, they took in about half as much each day as when they could have 37, while the amount of toxins they inhaled from each cigarette tripled. 
At the American Cancer So­ciety, Dr. Lawrence Garfinkel noted that the study was con­ducted under carefully con­trolled laboratory conditions, not the way people actually smoke and live. 
"Even if it's true," he said of the finding, "it's still good advice to cut down in the amount that you smoke, be­cause you are taking in less toxins. While the magnitude of the benefit is much less than expected, it's still of benefit to cut down."

Reagan 
continuedfrom page 1 
.. . We have a strong foreign policy that's in serious disar­ray." 
When a questioner asked whether the president had been forced on the defensive, Reagan bristled and said, "I don't feel I have anything to defend about. 
"The decision for the opera­tion is mine and mine alone," he said al a session so con­sumed with the Iranian issue that his summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbac­hev didn't come up until its midpoint. 
"I have to believe there is 
reason for optimism," about a 
possible future superpower 
summit, the president said. 
"We are waiting for them to 
give us a date ... " 
Reagan strode into the White House East Room determined to address the Iranian issue head-on. In an opening state­ment, he promised to provide key members of Congress with all information about what he said were the two sales he au­thorized. 
But in response to a question, he said there may still be in­formation he cannot divulge in public, and at one point denied any Israeli participation in the arms shipments . 
But in an unusual written statement of clarification issued shortly after the news conference ended, Reagan ac­knowledged that despite his in­itial denials, "there was a third country involved in our secret project with Iran." 
Senior administration offi­
cials earlier had identified that 
country as Israel and said the 
United States condoned an Is­
raeli shipment of arms to Iran 
about the time American 
hostage Benjamin Weir was 
released and before the U.S. 
arms sales began. 
"But taking this into ac­count," Reagan said in his statement, "all of the ship­ments of the token amounts of defensive arms and parts that I have authorized or condoned, taken in total, could be placed aboard a single cargo aircraft. Any other shipments by third countries were not authorized by the U.S. government." 
Reagan conceded that the shipments amounted to a waiver of his policy of retaining an arms embargo against Iran, but said the exception was jus­tified by the potential rewards. 
He also said the shipments of what he described as defensive arms did not provide Iranians with an inducement to seize ad­ditional American hostages. He said the Iranian govern­ment holds no hostages, al­though he added that that country's leaders "can per­suade or pressure" the group holding hostages in Beirut. 
Reagan quoted Abraham Lincoln as saying that if an ac­tion proved correct, all the criticism didn't matter. If it were wrong, "10 angels swear­ing I was right won't make it right." 
Three American hostages were released in Beirut at times that coincided with the arms shipments, Reagan ac­knowledged, as he had in a televised speech last week. But the president again said he had not been trading arms for hostages.

Programs for seafood inspection inadequate, says nutrition group 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A nutrition group, saying the health benefits of eating fish are being offset by the risk of contamina­tion, launched a quest on Wed­nesday to set up a new federal inspection program for seafood. 
"This is a public health scan­dal in the making that requires first-rate legislative attention immediately," said Ellen Haas, director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a non-profit advocacy group. 
A study released by the group said that Americans, attracted to fish in growing numbers be­cause it is a healthy source of protein, are at the same time at increasing risk from bac­terial, viral and toxic contami­nation because it is among the least regulated foods. 
"We advise consumers to eat fish only with caution--to avoid raw fish ... to avoid fish from known contaminated waters and to be careful with species with known patterns of prob-

lems," Haas told a news con­ference. 
Spokesmen for the fisheries industry, while saying they also favor a stepped-up inspec­tion program for their prod­ucts, called the Public Voice warnings overblown. 
"Americans eat 350 to 400 million pounds of seafood a year," said Roy Martin, sci­ence director for the National Fisheries Institute. "Where are the people dropping over? We don't have a great big prob­lem. We do have a perception problem.'' 
Richard Gutting, the in­stitute's lobbyist, said the in­dustry is awaiting the outcome of a two-year, $350,000 federal effort to design an improved in­spection and sampling pro­gram. 
He said other nations, notably Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Japan, have im­proved their inspection sys­tems and used the improve­ments as a marketing tool to sell more seafood. More than 60 percent of seafood consumed in the United States is im-

ported, he said. 

Public Voice said in a 44-page study that while exact figures are unavailable, it is estimated that thousands of Americans become ill each year from eating seafood contaminated with bacteria or viruses, and many others are at long-term risk from consumption of prod­ucts that contain toxic chemi­cals. 
The report said the federal government should assume re­spor;tsibility for setting uniform national standards for fish and seafood and set up an inspec­tion program to make sure those standards are met, much like the Agriculture Depart­ment program governing meat and poultry. 
The existing government in­spection program is handled primarily by the National Marine Fisheries Service, an arm of the Commerce Depart­ment. But that inspection is en­tirely voluntary and is intended more to promote · sales of seafood than to protect consu­mers, Public Voice said. 
Bombing injures 35 in department store 
Associated Press 
MANILA, Philippines -A bomb hidden in a shopping bag blew up Wednesday in a depart­ment store packed with Christmas shoppers, injuring about 35 people. A few hours earlier a prominent friend of Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile was shot to death in an ambush. 
President Corazon Aquino said on television that the es­calating violence was directed at her. She vowed to retaliate once she knows "which forces are with me." 
Police said a homemade time bomb exploded at a ground­floor counter in the Shoemart Department Store about 7: 20 
p.m. No group claimed respon­sibility, and police reported no arrests. 
Hospital sources said about 
· 35 people were treated for cuts and bruises, but no one was seriously injured. A half hour before the blast, an unknown assailant tossed a grenade into the crowded bal­cony of a movie theater two blocks from the department store, but the device did not ex­plode. Earlier Wednesday, David Puzon, 65, a right-wing busines­sman and friend of Enrile, was killed along with his driver and a factory manager by a band of gunmen dressed as women 10 miles northeast of Manila. Two senior police officers were killed in separate ambushes. 
Puzon's slaying followed last week's killing of Rolando Olalia, a leftist whose death his supporters blamed on "fascist elements" whom they said

No arrests were reported in 
any of the cases, but the mili­
tary command blamed the 
Communist New People's 
Army rebels in the Puzon 
slayings. 
A series of shootings and ex­plosions around Manila since mid-October has fueled fears of ·a military coup by dissidents linked to Enrile, who has criticized negotiations between Aquino's representatives and the Communist insurgents. 
The Communist-led National 
Democratic Front broke off the 
talks after Olalia's assassina­
tion, but government 
negotiators said the president 
told them Wednesday to reach 
a cease-fire this month in the 
17-year-old insurgency. 
During her televised inter­
view, taped Wednesday before 
the department store bombing, 
Aquino said she was uncertain 
who was behind the escalating 
violence. 
"There are so many who could have done this," she said. "But clearly I am involved. It also was directed against me." 
"I am convinced there is a 
time to do battle, but I want to 
be good and ready, to know 
which forces are with me," she 
said. "When I fight, I want to 
be sure I will win." 
In the Puzon slaying, gun­
men sprayed the busines­
sman's car with automatic fire, 
killing him and one of his fac­
tory managers.

Money spent on defense should serve social needs 
Did you know that the U.S. Depart­ment of Housing and Urban Develo­ment in the 50 years since 1930 spent about $26 billion on housing assistance for low-income families and that $26 bil­lion is approximately equal to what tax subsidies -primarily for homeowners through mortgage interest and prop­erty tax deduction-cost the government in 1980 alone. 
Jurgen Brauer 
peace and justice 
Are you aware that the proposed 20 Trident II submarines to be deployed as of 1989 carry 3,840 nuclear warheads and cost the American taxpayer the amount of $100 billion? 
Did you know that President Reagan has proposed to spend roughly $2 tril­lion (neither billions, nor millions, but trillions) on the Pentagon within the next five years? That comes to about $3 million per day since the time of Jesus. 

Did you know that the cost of two 400 M-1 tanks releases enough money to subsidize the cost of prescription medicine for 7.5 million senior citizens in this country? 
And I don't care just what you believe about the need for America to" be strong" as long as you are willing to give us at least the money equivalent for this single B-1 bomber, i.e., a mere $500 million, out of the 100 planned ones, to provide immunization and basic health supplies for 50 million children in Asia, Africa and Latin America. 
These and many other astounding facts are collected in a small, impres­sive and exceptionally well­documented 40 page booklet entitled "The Women's Budget," published last year. Women still under the sway of men, women who earn but 60 percent of every man's dollar in this country -such women have the courage and sense to present to this country's male "leaders" an alternative federal budget. Their proposal is strikingly simple: cut the federal defense budget in half. The roughly $150 billion left for defense, they argue, is more than enough to secure our legitimate defense needs. The other half is to be used to revive social programs to assist those in need here and elsewhere in the world. 
Take the last example I cited above. Does this country really need exactly 100 B-1 bombers? Couldn't it do with 99? What do you think? The money for a single saved bomber provides for im­munization and basic health supplies for 50 million children in the less developed countries. 
Take another example. To increase funding for child care (Title 20 and Head Start) at $2 billion; to improve elderly dependent care and support ser­vices (Older Americans Act) at $500 million; to increase funding for 1600 rape crisis centers and battered women shelters at $200 million; to improve ser­vices to displaced homemakers at $300 million; to expand legal services to wo­men at $300 million; to improve civil rights enforcement at another $200 mil­lion and to increase funding for the Wo­
men's Bureau at the U.S. Department 
of Labor at $10 million; all this sums 
to $3.51 billion or four days of U.S. mil­
itary spending. 
Of course, closer to home, we have a 
war memorial constructed for $500,000. 
Enough to fund almost 100 Notre Dame 
graduate students for four years 
(tuition and stipend). 
The recent Reagan-Gorbachev encounter in Iceland was simultane­ously termed a failure and a success. It was termed a failure because no arms-reduction agreements were made. It was termed a success for Reagan because he didn't give in to Gorbachev's demands, and a success for Gorbachev because he didn't renege on his demands. What a world has this become? We begin to call failure suc­cess. Will we, in due course, call our nuclear destruction creation? 
Let's follow the wotnen's lead. Cut 
military spending and begin living in­
stead of dying.

were old too, their faces chipped and snarling around the girth of the mighty sun temple. We climbed to the top and marveled at the altitude, the view, the precise and brilliant architecture. In the village, we shaped and baked tor­tillas and drank juices steeped from flowers. 

And we read. We read Paulo Freire and Bonino and Robert Evans who says, "If the world were a village of 100 persons ... 6 of the 100 would be Americans and would have over one­third the village's entire income, would produce 16 percent of the village's food supply and consume most of it them­selves, except what they store for fu­ture use or even destroy to raise its value in the village market. Over half of the remaining 94 would be hungry most of the time and would consider the six to be enormously wealthy, dis­proportionately well-fed, with three of them on a diet."

Northeast neighbors enjoyed seniors' party 
Dear Editor: 
The northeast neighbors wish to publicly thank the senior classes of Notre Dame and St. Mary's for the very enjoyable Block Party last Friday af­ternoon, Nov. 14, and to thank espe­cially co-chairpersons, Therese Kraemer and Meg McGlinn. 
It is nice to get together with stu­dents, many of whom have given ser­vice to the northeast area by tutoring students, helping make out income taxes for the elderly, painting houses

and doing many other chores for el­derly and handicapped neighbors. 
We enjoyed meeting with members of the Class of '87 and look forward to the seventh Annual Block Party next fall.

disproportionately so. The truth taught us lessons we had to allow ourselves to learn. And it hurt. 
But it was worth it. The Program in Global Community introduced us to people and ideas and experiences that were honest. And then we sat together and talked and reflected. Freire says that this is what learning is really about. That intead of just reading what somebody says about liberation theol­ogy, you go to a Base Christian Com­munity meeting and listen to the people. We were lucky enough to have that chance. 
Adela told us: "If you study and live what's real, then you will know what's important. But if you just study, you'll be like my priest who just thinks he's important. 
It's hard to remember the elevation of Cuernavaca, the population of Mexico City, or how many times larger Nicaragua is than El Salvador. What's hard to forget is the onion children tug­ging our arms in the market, the ten­sion in the streets of Honduras, the senora's exhausted endurance and her gentle smile. 
If you would like to live simply, to be challenged in habit and in attitude, to learn from the poor themselves, we'd love to tell you more--like our funky language school, and its individual at­tention, or about the two weeks we spent in a village, or the two weeks we spent in Central America. We'll tell you that the food was really good. And that we even got used to the beans.

Irish record does not indicate performance 

"We choked again!" says one fan. "It always happens to us. Can't we ever beat someone good?" 
These were just some of the reactions I heard while I stood in astonishment as Penn State held off a determined Irish team 24-19last Saturday at Notre Dame Stadium. The 1986 home football season had just ended with a heart­breaking loss. For all of the seniors on the football team, it was a chance to leave the historic Notre Dame stadium with a win over third-ranked Penn State. Well, let me tell you one thing. You played your hearts out. In my mind, not only are the seniors winners, but the whole team is, too. I'm only a freshman now, but that is just one more reason why I'm happy to be part of this university. You fought to the end and never gave up. That is what Notre Dame is all about.

guest column 
As a fan in the stands, I have heard criticism here and there about this fine football team. Let's get rid of the horse­puckey and get to the facts. This team is not one which always chokes and doesn't have the ability to beat anyone. This is a team full of God-given talent and determination. Notre Dame came into this season with college football's hardest schedule. Nine games have been completed and the Irish have come out with a 4-5 record. Let's look back at the past games and see why ­this team deserves more credit than it has gotten. 
Game £1-ln Lou Holtz's debut as head 
coach, the Irish play a great game but 
fall one point short to Michigan, ::!4-23. They outgained Michigan in yards, first downs, etc. only to have mistakes and a missed field goal deprive them of a victory. 
Game £2 -The Irish play well enough to win, but one touchdown interception for Michigan State and another inter­ception at the end of the game seals the win for M.S.U., 20-15. Once again, the Irish outgain the opponents in several key categories. 
Game £3 -No problem here. Notre Dame thrashes Purdue, 41-9. 
Game £4 -The Irish travel down to Alabama only to lose to a great Ala­bama team, 28-10. This is one game in which the opponents rightfully deserve the win. 
Game £5 -The Irish return home only to run into a Pittsburgh team that plays one of its better games of the year. A missed field goal on the game's final play enables Pittsburgh to squeak out a 10-9 win. 
Game £6,7,8 -Notre Dame plays su­
perb football in easily defeating Air 
Force 31-3, Navy 33-14, and S.M.U. 61­
29. 
Game £9 -Notre Dame and Penn State 
play one of the best games of the year. 
Penn State prevails 24-19, although the Irish again show they are a team with which to be reckoned. They outgain the Nittany Lions by more than 100 yards and 13 first downs. Yet, they come up short again. 
To summarize the past nine games, the Irish have played well enough to win and are not at all a bad team. In my estimation, the 4-5 record is quite deceiving. When I went home for fall break, four of my friends said in similar words that Notre Dame could have 

legitimately been 5-1 at the time. Make 
that 8-1 now. In my opinion, only Ala­
bama really handled us. You may dis­
agree with me, but this Irish team is a 
darn good one! 
One more thing, it's really too bad 
that the bowl committees will probably 
overlook us. Just the other day, I looked 
at some of the bowl projections in the Chicago Tribune. I'll tell you one thing, there are teams that will receive a bowl bid which Notre Dame can beat. So let's _stand behind the Irish football team and give them our full support. They need that Irish pride when they encounter 
Louisiana State and U.S.C. 
As regards Coach Paterno: think again, Joe. This campus has mystique. Never have I seen an atmosphere anywhere as special as that at Notre Dame. It was my dream to come here, and it's everything I've anticipated and more! 
As for Coach Lou Holtz and the foot­ball team, thanks for a fine 1986 home football season. It was a pleasure to watch the team play and be part of the faithful Notre Dame community. Good luck this Saturday!

Notre Dame experience is a good opportunity 
It was a gray, nowhere afternoon not too long ago. Actually, the cold chilled, the wind wailed, and the sky was busy deciding between rain or snow and in the meantime offering samples of both. 
I sat lifeless on the couch, hypnotized by the lights of my roommate's equalizer as they soared and fell, and then repeated the act ---ceaselessly. U93 was celebrating their one-millionth playing of "I Can't Fight This Feeling Anymore," though, if I'm not mistaken, this was the extended dance-mix ver­sion. Pity I didn't have a blank cassette available at the moment.

guest column 
Demented thoughts began to clutter my mind like Diet Cokes and Saltines on a Lyonite's lunch tray. What exactly is beef salad, and is the dining hall's as good as homemade? Is it still Time Magazine even if a half-naked femme fatale doesn't appear on the People page? Is "The Flintstones" filmed before a live studio audience? 
Deeper contemplation ensued. What if Marx's printer had committed a typo: "Workers of the world, untie!"? Consider the confusion among the proletariat, not to mention the histori­cal repercussions: 1986 would see mil­lions of capitalist Russians running late from their analyst appointment to the aerobics class in velcro Reeboks. A utopian state to be sure, but alas, I digress from my story. 
I started to wax nostalgic (never once stopping to wane) and being in that type of mood I tuned the receiver to Sunny 101, because I almost wanted to hear a Carpenters tune. Show me a band that plays weddings and I'll show you a pianist who plays "We've Only Just Begun." Let us return to my waxing. 
My mind lapsed back in time two years, this time of year, this same dreary weather. A lowly freshman, in both status and demeanor, sat despon­dent in the third-floor weight room, willing that the weights he was bench­ing would somehow find a way off of his chest. Alone except for a certain golf couch, I looked up and out the win­dows to stare upon two shivering chip­munks holding an "Open window, please" sign; or was it "Need 2 tick­ets"? My visage must have mirrored their distraught faces. 
Coach O'Sullivan, one of those who makes the Notre Dame family the type you enjoy being included in (he'd be the uncle who sneaks you the beer at cousin Gussie's wedding when you're twelve), had apparently noticed my plight, both immediate and within. Life under the dome, my dream since I was old enough to watch an Irish-USC game (during my first, my parents had to strap me to the bed as, in a foaming rage, I'd chanted, "Anthony Davis is the anti-Christ! "), had not materialized as planned. 

Noel O'Sullivan helped me with the weight, then sauntered up to the rain­splashed window and peered onto the golf course. The chipmunks had skipped town. 
"Beauty-full Notre Dame," he an­nounced to no one in particular. "Isn't it beauty-full?" he announced again, this time to me. 
"Yes, coach." It wasn't or didn't seem to be at least, but what would you have said? 
"Are you a freshman, son?" 
That visible, eh? "Yes, coach." 
"Aren't you glad you chose Notre Dame?" 
A white lie, but with emotion, "Sure, coach!" I knew I wasn't supposed to, but how could I explain that it just didn't feel that way? Adjustment was difficult. For example, I red-shirted SYR's freshman year, a victim of Proposition 47.5, the HTH Rule. Social zero. 
Coach O'Sullivan, however, opened my eyes. I began to give Notre Dame and the greater St. Joe Valley a fair 
chance. The two years since that day have been chock-full, and I do mean chock-full, of memories, and devoid of any major regrets. Ifyou have a sudden urge to recite "The Road Not Taken" right about now, hey, by all means, feel free. 
Life off of US-31 is not perfect. Since I'm from Phoenix, I chuckle at those who lay out when the temperature dips below the average organic chemistry grade. If K-Mart had been an airport, it would be Michiana Regional. Why do they put mushrooms on EVERY­THING? And sure, there are those days of ceaseless study when you can't wait to escape the library to go to dinner, when the most intriguing question you're asked is, "What's up?" or " How's calc looking?" 
But all in all life here is good, very good. I'll spare you the endless list of those "Notre Dame moments" we all experience, since I'm not in a particu­larly touchie-feelie mood at present. You can now or will someday be able to recall enough of your own. 
This author had no intention of creat­ing the obligatory, semi-annual "Isn't Notre Dame Just Swell?" (say it once more, with feeling) editorial, but if my thoughts are interpreted in that man­ner, so be it. Time passes too quickly here, when you stand back and think about it ; if the most agonizing scene you've witnessed in the past week is the bathroom on Sunday morning, then consider, of all places you could be, how lucky you are to be here. Thanks, coach.

NIT/86-87 Preview The Observer Phelps looks at career 
'It's never been a job' 

By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 

When the Coca-Cola NIT Classic tips off Friday night, Digger Phelps will begin his 16th season as coach of the Irish and his 17th year as a head coach. 
Phelps was destined to coach at Notre Dame. In 1965 while he was still a high school coach at St. Gabriel's in Hazleton, Pa., Phelps wrote Irish football coach Ara Parseghian and said "My dream is to coach at Notre Dame. I love the essence of Notre Dame." Just six years later, Phelps' dream was realized. 
Now 15 years and 300 wins later, Phelps is gearing up for another season. In the first of a two-part interview, Phelps talks of how he's dealt with the pressures of coaching and some of the problems confronting the game today. 
Q: After 15 years at Notre Dame, do you still feel the same way you did when you first got here and in the letter to Ara? 
A: When we had press day during break, a couple of the guys started out by saying, 'well now it's 16 years.' It hit me then that it's 16 years, but it doesn't seem that it's 16 years. It has never been a job. It's always been someth­ing I want to do. I still enjoy doing it, probably because of, hopefully, a word called maturity. I enjoy all aspects of it -the public relations, the media, the recruiting and the coaching. It's just something I enjoy doing, and I can still see myself doing it for a few more years. 
Q: Will there ever be a point where you'll say, 'this is It; I've had enough?' 
A: Oh, I can see when. I'm 45, probably when I'm 55. I can't see doing it for another 10. I think that as I look at it now, it's just something that's hard to explain. Time blocks go by. It could be recruiting season so you go out for six weeks in the fall and get things lined up with juniors and seniors for what you're trying to do to have a good team two years from now. You get back, and then you have meetings with your coaches -you get involved with the coming season. You just isolate those things, and I've learned to do that. I've learned probably to put my priorities in place but, at the same time, allow myself to get in, get out of it -do the things I like to do and still enjoy coaching. Especially like now, because recruiting's over with, and you don't worry about it in season. Now, it's just getting tapes, looking at opponents, coming up with strategy and getting things to work -taking this team and getting it to grow as the year goes on. I think this team's going to get better be­cause when you lose four good seniors, you've got to replace that. The only way you can do that is with game experience. You can practice all you want and drill all you want but until they really get out there and see how it feels, so things go that way. 
I<'or me it's a challenge, and it's interesting -it's always been that way. I mean every part of your life that you're here other things come into your life. Like I've been walking the dog. We've got a new dog, a chocolate labrador retriever, and I walk him around the lake when I have time and when the weather's OK. It gets my head going at seven or eight in the morning. But that's also been from that standpoint you tan think better, your head's clearer and you just put things in perspective that way. But when it comes time to do the work that you've got to do, you get those priorities done. Yet I also think I've been able to enjoy other things that are important to me. Like my wife and I went to France this summer for 10 days. We went to Brittany and Normandy and really en­joyed it. When you go to Normandy and you see all those Americans who buried there, it's just (Phelps' voice trails off). And that gives you the balance. I think you have to do that to survive. I've learned to let basketball not con­trol me versus me controlling basketball. 
Now I've seen former players come back who are successful, and that's when you feel good as a coach. Because everyone that's gone out and no matter what walk of life they've chosen, they're successful people. Then you know you've taught them more than just basketball, and they've carried it with them. I came here as young coach, I was around 29, and you don't see much of that because you've got young kids, young players. Now these guys are in their mid­thirties, and they're all starting to develop their careers to be successful. 
Q: How has the game itself changed in the last 15 years? 
A: As for the game itself and the type of kids, I think we really have found good people to represent Notre Dame in basketball. We've never had any scandals. We've never had anybody in the situations where we've had a Lenny Bias situation. They all graduate. The seven guys we've got in the NBA are all good people. From that standpoint, this place has

Guide to the '86 Coca-Cola NIT Classic 

By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
As if Western Kentucky does not amount to enough of an obstacle be­tween Notre Dame and a ticket to Madison Square Garden for the Coca-Cola NIT Classic Final Four, an impressive list of schools rounds out the 16-team field. 
Here's a brief look at some of the teams who are vying for a bite at the Big Apple next weekend: 
Arizona (last season, 23-9): Lute Ol­sen and the Wildcats were supposed to have an off-season last year, but instead won the school's first Pac-10 championship. This year Arizona is getting a little more respect, as evidenced by its hold on 19th spot in the AP preseason poll. Returning are 6-6 junior Craig McMillan (11.8 ppg.), and 6-8 sophomores Sean El­liott (15.6 ppg.) and Anthony Cook at forwards. Tom Tolbert, a junior­college transfer at 6-9, will have to make an impact in the middle to free up some quick outside players. 
Bradley (32-3): The 1986-87 season will be a crossroads for Stan Albeck, an NBA transfer from the Hawks' helm. Albeck has the Missouri Val­ley Conference's best player in 6-3 junior Hersey Hawkins (18.7 ppg.), but somehow will have to com­pensate for the loss of Valley player­of-the-year Jim Les and dominating center Mike Williams. A lot will ride on the play of 5-11 sophomore An­thony Manuel and 6-9 freshman Luke Jackson if the NCAA probation­plagued Braves are to salvage a suc­cessful campaign. 
BYU (18-14): Last season, a less­than-spectacular Cougar squad up­set the Irish with some steady play. This season, expect BYU to be solid once again. Six returning players who can be tabbed legitimate full­timers -including two who are com­ing off two-vear Mormon missions ­
four starters (which amounted to 67 percent of his points and 61 percent of his rebounds) to graduation and should anchor Ladell Andersen's squad with plenty of depth. Look for 6-6 Jeff Chatman (17.5 ppg.) and his almost-unstoppable jumper to fill the nets in Provo. 
Cleveland State (29-4): The Vikings might even be better than they were last year, when they took the NCAA tournament by storm. Kenny "Mouse" McFadden, one of the best (if not the best) freshman guards in the country, is back as one of four returning starters. Three-year starters Clinton Ransey (14.5 ppg.) and Eric Mudd (12.2 ppg.) are also back to try duplicating last season's performance. 
Howard (19-10): Four first-stringers return to the team which has finished second and lost an NCAA bid to North Carolina A&T for the past five years. Quick guard Fred Hill (12.7 ppg.) might be able to power the Bisons past A&T this season, but don't look for too many surprises from Howard right off the bat in the NIT. 
LSU (26-12): The Tigers are cer­tainly entering 86-87 as a team with a big question mark behind its name. A Final Four squad in the 1986 NCAA tournament, LSU has lost three of its best players-including John Wil­liams, who decided to try his luck in the NBA. Dale Brown returns only Anthony Wilson (9.6 ppg.) and Ricky Blanton (6.3 ppg.) at starting posi­tions, and will need a load of recruits to come through if he expects to even breathe the same air as last year. 

Memphis State (28-6) : The once­mighty Tigers are now an underdog. An NCAA probation ruling only adds insult to injury, as Dana Kirk lost the NBA. Junior guard Dwight Boyd 
(9.3 ppg.) is the only one who will not need to be replaced. Although, Vincent Askew has returned to Tiger town. 
Michigan (28-5): The recruiting class that turned Michigan's basket­ball program around has graduated, and a third straight Big Ten cham­pionship will be a difficult feat for Bill Frieder this year. Still, the Wol­verines should be tough to beat with backcourt standouts Antione Joubert (who will probably switch to forward at 6-5), Gary Grant and Garde Thompson. Highly-touted freshman center Terry Mills, 6-9, will sit out, a Proposition 48 victim. 
Oklahoma (26-9): Two legitimate all-America candidates in 6-5 senior Choo Kennedy (21 ppg., 8.5 rpg.) and 6-3 senior Tim McAlister (18.2 ppg.) will lead a powerful Sooner offense, along with 6-7 David Johnson (14.3 ppg.), to another strong finish. Coach Billy Tubbs enters the season after another fine year of recruiting, and his troops sit in the number-five slot in the AP preseason poll. The Sooners are undoubtedly a favorite in the NIT. 
TCU (22-9): Texas Christian won its first Southwest Conference title since 1971 last year, and look to be even better entering the 86-87 season. Four starting players return for Head Coach Jim Killingsworth, in­cluding Carl Lott, a 6-4 senior who averaged 15.8 ppg. at point guard, and 6-5 senior Carven Holcombe 
(12.7 ppg.). A strong bench and some good speed will make the Horned Frogs a team to watch. 
Temple (25-6): One of the most ex­perienced backcourts in the nation and a dominating big man might just be the formula for success for Owls' head coach Don Chaney. The back­court consists of 6-4 senior Nate Blackwell (13.1 ppg.) and 6-2 junior Howard Evans (12.1 ppg.), while 6-9 center Tim Perry (11.6ppg., 9.5rpg.) is considered one of the country's top big men by many. Only three new­comers will dress for a team that knows how to win. 
UNLV (33-5): Saying that Jerry Tarkanian's Rebels are favored to take the Coca-Cola NIT would not be doing them justice. Fifth-ranked UNLV might have the top player on the West Coast in 6-8 senior forward Armon Gilliam (15.7 ppg., 8.5 rpg.), to replace last year's top pick by the Washington Bullets, Anthony Jones. 
Freddie Banks (17.6 ppg.) and Mark Wade (7.5 apg.) return as starters in the backcourt, and a solid contin­gent of forwards could push Gilliam to the center slot. In any case, the Rebels look to be runnin' away from a lot of teams this season, beginning in the Coca-Cola Classic. 
Villanova (23-14): Rollie Massimino always seems to be right there at the end, no matter how low the so-called experts pick his Cats to finish. This year, Villanova will rely on some youth to win its share of games in the always-tough Big East. Tom Gries, a 7-2 freshman who averaged better than 24 ppg. in high school and the tallest player in Villanova his­tory, will be the key man in the paint, while the top returnee is 6-4 Harold Jensen (11.8 ppg.), whose sharpshooting helped cop the NCAA crown in 1985. 
Virginia (19-11): The entire starting lineup -including four seniors and junior Mel Kennedy -was supposed to return to a Cavalier team which obtained an NCAA berth last season. But dominating center Olden 
Polynice was suspended from the team in the spring, and his status is uncertain. Without Polynice, Vir­ginia is not nearly as strong in the frontcourt, although its experience should be good for something. A small recruiting class could hurt the Cavs' chances, but enough talent is there, especially in senior forwards Tom Sheehey and Drew Kennedy. 
Western Kentucky (23-8): For Notre Dame fans, this is the team to worry about first and foremost -and it should be. New Head Coach Murray Arnold takes over a team which many rank among the top-20 preseason schools. Strength in the middle will be abundant, in the forms of 6-9 Kennard Johnson (12.2 ppg., 
5.5 rpg.), 6-10 Tellis Frank ( 10.2 ppg., ppg., 6.7 rpg.)-all returning seniors. Also returning is 6-6 senior Bryan Asberry and a number of juniors 
with playing experience. The Irish will have their hands full.

The Team 


1986-87 Irish blend youth, speed 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 

The 1986-87 Notre Dame men's basket­ball team will be a team in transition on and off the court. Gone are four seniors--Ken Barlow, Jim Dolan, Tim Kempton and Joseph Price--who last year led the Irish to a 23-5 record and a No. 10 ranking before losing to Arkansas-Little Rock in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Gone is the bulky front line which led the country in rebounding differential and handing out the punishment under the boards. 
In their place stands a team with only two seniors, but four freshmen--Joe Fredrick, Jamere Jackson, Tony Jack­son and Scott Paddock. What the Irish lack in bulk, they should make up for with speed. Which means the transition game with David Rivers should be that much more exciting. 
But with all the youth (the Irish will start two players who averaged less than nine minutes of playing time last season), comes a lot of questions. 
"I think basketball is played on the boards," said Notre Dame basketball coach Digger Phelps, "and that's one of the questions we have to have an­swered. That fact is that right now in the frontline we're playing (Donald) Royal, (Sean) Connor and (Gary) Voce. That's the bulk that we're going to miss inside. That's one of our concerns--how well can we rebound." 
Another of Phelps' questions concerns whether or not his young inside players can avoid foul trouble and play post defense. If not, a pressing team is on order. All of this has Phelps working hard to get his squad prepared for a veteran Western Kentucky team. 
Guards When discussing the Notre Dame bas­ketball team, you've got to begin with David Rivers. The preseason all­America candidate gave his coach and fans a horrible scare when he was in­volved in an auto accident at the begin­ning of the school year. Rivers has come back ahead of schedule, but he won't start against the Hilltoppers. Any questions about his physical shape were answered in last Sunday's practice when Rivers set a screen on Scott Pad­dock. Paddock came away from the col­lision with chipped teeth while Rivers came away fine. 
16.7 average and handed out 138 assists. Phelps described Rivers to the coach of the Yugoslavian team Sibenik as "our Patrick Ewing." It may be a hard comparison to live up to, but Rivers is the dominating presence on the Irish squad. 
Backing up Rivers at the point and starting Friday will be senior co­captain Scott Hicks. Hicks averaged 5.4 points in 15.5 minutes of play. Sopho­more Michael Smith (1.4 ppg.) rounds out the point position. 
Sophomore Mark Stevenson had the

geance, finishing with a 10.9 scoring average. He's Notre Dame's leading re­turning rebounder with a 4.9 average. Phelps has compared him to former Irish great Orlando Woolridge, but Phelps says the addition of an outside shot has made Royal a better player.

The Irish seemed on the verge of taking command after 
, those matches, as 134-pound sophomore captain Jerry Durso won, 7-4, and a 13-1 triumph by 142-pound Pat Boyd put Notre Dame ahead, 10-5. Winning three straight matches, though, the Falcons stormed back and regained the lead. "They won all the close matches," said McCann. "We were intimidated by them and that scares me. If we're in­timidated by them, what's going to happen later in the season when we have our toug­hest competition?" An impressive 24-9 win by sophomore Chris Geneser in the 177-pound category closed the gap, but Air Force held on to the lead, as Irish senior Dave Helmer tied, 6-6, in the 190­pound match. Without a heavyweight, the Irish had to forfeit that competition, ac­counting for the 23-18 final score. "It hurt us having people in­jured," said McCann. "Geneser and Helmer were out of their weight class, and we haven't been pushing as hard as we'd like because we've got so many people hurt, but that's no excuse. "They had more desire than we did. We've got to go out and dominate, and we went out and didn't." Notre Dame will compete this weekend in the St.Louis Open, an open tournament with no team scores. The tourna­ment will include wrestlers from Oklahoma, Missouri, 

Minnesota, Western Illinois, competition," said McCann. and several other schools. "Durso won and Boyd was

Aaron blasts MVP choice 
Associated Press Henry Aaron, a former National League Most Valu­able Player, yesterday called the selection of a pitcher, Boston's Roger Clemens, as the American League's MVP,"a joke." Aaron, who won the MVP in 1957 while playing for the 
Milwaukee Braves, said, "Everyday players cannot win the Cy Young award, and pitchers should not be able to win the MVP award. The pitchers have their own MVP award, and it's the Cy Young. I feel very strongly about that."

Linebacker Mike Stone breaker 
Freshman makes name for himself 
By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
With minor bowl hopes still fresh on the minds of the Notre Dame football team, the Irish definitely do not intend to simply play out the string in their final two games. And one player who figures to see action in both of them is counting on helping keep the Irish in post­season play this year and in each of his next three seasons. 
His name is Mike Stonebreaker, and yes, his name indicates the style of play he has adopted in his freshman year at inside linebacker for Notre Dame. 
According to defensive co­ordinator Foge Fazio, Stonebreaker, a 6-1, 216-pound native of River Ridge, Louisiana, is an extraordinary talent who can only get better. 
"When I saw Mike on film when he played in Louisiana," said Fazio, "I knew we had a very special young man on our hands. He was outstanding in high school, and he's made the adjustment to college ball very well. I can't tell you how much he's improved and gained con­fidence over the course of the year." 

One of the few problems of recruiting a great player is that there are several methods and techniques that might have been effective for the player in high school that need to be com­pletely revamped to suit the caliber of college play. But as Fazio explains, the coaching staff didn't even need to worry much about that with Stonebreaker. 
"Usually," said Fazio, "a linebacker coming right out of high school has difficulty pick­ing up the man coming out of the backfield and taking on his pass coverage. Well, this is probably the area in which Mike most excels. He breaks on the release of the ball ex­tremely well and if the ball is caught in front of him he will rarely miss the tackle. His tackling form is beautiful and his natural instincts on the field take him to the ball quickly so

he can get in position to make the hit." 
Fazio also realizes that while Stonebreaker possesses great athletic ability, he seldom overruns plays or blows his as­signments because of his calm demeanor on the playing field. 
''Mike is an extremely coach­able player," Fazio noted of Stonebreaker, whose father Steve had an eight-year NFL career. "Although you wouldn't know it from the way he hits, he is truly a student of the game. He reads formations and handles the pressures of playing very well. 
"Mike is an extremely heady player and he'll definitely play more in the next two weeks. I'm sure that he'll play a vital role in the Notre Dame defen­sive scheme for the next few years." 
Stonebreaker, who has com­piled 16 tackles, one intercep­tion and two broken-up passes during limited playing time in nine games, sees his contribu­tion this year as a good start for his career at Notre Dame. 
"I'm happy with the way I've played so far," said Stonebreaker. "I am really glad I got the chance to play, because I felt that coming out of high school I could make an immediate impact here, and I feel that I have at least shown that I can play in college." 
Mike got the nod at inside linebacker when Irish captain Mike Kovaleski went down in the first quarter against SMU. All Stonebreaker did was lead his team with tackles (10) and intercept a pass in the third quarter. He had come off the bench the previous week to reg­ister another team-leading six tackles against Navy. In addi­tion to these contributions, Stonebreaker has been an inte­gral member of the Notre Dame kickoff team for most of the year. 
Amidst the talk of his early success with the Irish, however, Stonebreaker speaks little of himself and would rather discuss the team and the coaches, especially Fazio, whom Mike says has been in­strumental in his development at linebacker this year. 
"Coach Fazio is just a super coach," said Stone breaker, "and he's helped me out a lot with some of my techniques. All in all, I think I've progressed pretty well, and I think the team has played ex­tremely well this year, a lot better than our record shows. The morale of the team is good, but I'm sure we all know that we've just got to put it all to­gether to win the close ones." 
Watching a young player like Stonebreaker emerge as a con­fident hitter and leader makes glances toward the future in­evitable, and that future looks the brightest for those who will be around to realize it. 

...
Stone breaker doesn't think it too likely that the next few Irish squads will be in a position to simply play out the string. 

"I'm excited for the next few years," said Stonebreaker. "The team looks young, and it looks talented. There's nothing that I want more than to meet the high expectations that I brought here."

Schmidt gets NL MVP for third time in career 

-
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Mike Schmidt, the slugging third baseman of the Philadelphia Phillies, yes­terday was named the National League's Most Valuable Player and became only the third in his league to win the honor three times. 
Schmidt, who was the MVP in 1980 and 1981, joined Hall of Famers Stan Musial of the St. Louis Cardinals and Roy Cam­panella of the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers as three-time NL MVPs. Musial won the award in 1943, '46 and '48 while Campanella won in 1951,'53 and '55. 
Four American Leaguers won the award three times-­Jimmy Foxx, who played for several teams, and former New York Yankees Joe DiMag­gio, Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle. 
Schmidt won easily in the balloting by the Baseball Writ­ers' Association of America, drawing 15 first-place votes, five for second-place and four for third, totalling 287 points. 
Glenn Davis of the Houston Astros, finished second with 231 points, polling six first-place votes. Gary Carter of the World Champion New York Mets had one first-place vote and finished third with 181 points while his teammate Keith Her­nandez was fourth and drew the other two first-place votes. Hernandez had 179 points. 
Others drawing some back­ing in the voting included Dave Parker of the Cincinnati Reds, Tim Raines of the Montreal Ex­pos, Kevin Bass of Houston and Von Hayes of the Phillies. But Schmidt, Davis and Carter were the only players named on all 24 ballots. 
Two members of the baseball writers' group in each league city voted for the MVP before the postseason games. In the BBWAA point system, first place is worth 14 points, second 9 points, third 8 points and so on down to 1. 
Schmidt hit .290 with league­leading totals of 37 home runs and 119 runs batted in in 1986 as the Phillies finished a dis­tant second, 20 games behind the Mets in the NL East. He was tied for second in runs scored with 97 and led the league with a .547 slugging percentage. 
It was the eighth consecutive year Schmidt hit 30 or more home runs and the 12th time in

He is the first National League MVP from a team that did not win its division since Dale Murphy of the Atlanta Braves gained the honor in 1982.

Suffering what it could only hope was a temporary case of first-game jitters, the Notre Dame wrestling team was up­set by the Air Force Academy, 23-18, in its first dual meet of the year last night at the ACC Pit. 
"We didn't go out there with any confidence at all. They wanted it more than we did," said Irish head coach Fran McCann. "We didn't wrestle like a Notre Dame team." 

The first two matches, more than any, symbolized how the meet would progress. In the 118-pound match, freshman Andy Radenbaugh, fresh off a win in the Michigan State invi­tational, jumped out to a 6-2 lead against freshman op­ponent Ted Nelson in the first two periods. Nelson came back in the third period, and defeated Radenbaugh 11-8 with five points in the closing seconds. 
"He (Radenbaugh) made a freshman mistake. He got a lead and tried to sit on it. You can't do that in college," said McCann. "He was ahead by four with 10 seconds left and lost. We can't lose matches like that." 
In the second match of the evening, 126-pound Irish senior Greg Fleming led 4-0 after two periods, but had to escape with a 7-7 tie when Air Force fresh­man Frank Nicholson rallied in the final period. Air Force used the last two minutes to its ad­vantage throughout the meet.

... while 12,193 Hulkamaniacs turn out to see WWF all-star cast 
By RICK RIETBROCK Sports Writer 
There is a strange disease that has wreaked havoc throughout much of the United States. Last night it hit Notre Dame. Itis called Hulkamania. 
Sufferers have been known to wear odd headbands, with the name of this disease on it rather than things like "Rozelle" or "Taco Bell." 
There were a lot of sufferers at the ACC last night but few seemed to be in any discomfort. In fact, there were 12,193 suf­ferers of this malaise gathered together, comprising the second largest crowd in ACC history. The only show to garner more fans was a Kenny Rogers show in March of 1980. What can this Rogers guy have that the WWF cannot provide? 

The night began innocently enough, with Butch "The Nat­ural" Reed defeating Tito San­tana with a little help from his friend, "The Doctor of Style," Slick, who tripped Santana when he came off the ropes. Just a little good clean fun, even considering Slick's nastiness. 
But not everything else was so cut and dried, and some things got downright confus­ing. 
Manager Jimmy "The Mouth of the South" Hart and his tag team, "The Hart Foundation," consisting of Bret "The Hit Man" Hart and Jim "The An­vil" Neidhart, defeated the World Tag Team Champion British Bulldogs. But it was only a joke. That's a non-title match in wrestling terms. 
Despite losing to The Hart Foundation, the Bulldogs' mas­cot, "Mathilda," an English Bulldog, chased Jimmy Hart up to the top rope before the match. Hart eventually was able to come down after the fiesty dog was restrained. 
Randy "Macho Man" Savage came out and the fans didn't know whether to boo and hiss him, or cheer his lovely manager Elizabeth. 
Then there were the ques­tions surrounding Hercules Hernandez -why has he

ND icers head north 
By GREG ANDRES Sports Writer 
Bags packed and ready to go, the Notre Dame hockey team will take a 1-3 record to St. Paul, Minn., this weekend to face the Tommies of St. Thomas. 
If all goes well, the Irish will return home back on the winning track with an even record of 3-3. 
Notre Dame head coach Lefty Smith is well aware, however, of the caliber of competition that lies ahead. The Tommies went 15-1 last year to capture the Minnesota Intercollegiate Conference title. The Irish split with the Tommies in the ACC last November, winning the first game 5-3 only to be whipped 10-3 the following night. 
Although the end of last season meant the graduation of 12 lettermen to the St. Thomas program, a solid corps of 10 returning lettermen will be counted on to pick up the slack.
