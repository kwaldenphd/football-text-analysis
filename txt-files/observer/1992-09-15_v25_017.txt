THE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER SERVING NOTRE DAME AND SAINT MARY'S 
Professors analyze Clinton's address 
By BECKY BARNES Assistant News Editor 
Democratic presidential can­didate Gov. Bill Clinton used his speech at Notre Dame Friday to initiate discussion of moral is­sues in a way that would appeal to Catholic voters, according to two Notre Dame professors. 
Clinton "clearly wanted to re­shape the discussion of values, offer his perspective on the subject and use Notre Dame as the place to begin that new dis­cussion,~ said Robert Schmuhl, acting chairman of the Ameri­can studies department. 
"This was a speech for Catholics across the country us­ing Notre Dame as a platform for it," said David Leege, gov­ernment professor. 
In previous speeches, Clinton has focused largely on eco­nomic issues. This speech was an attempt to "place his eco­nomic program in a context consistent with Catholic moral philosophy," Leege said. 
Many blue collar workers are ethnic Catholics, and Leege ex­pects to see Clinton appealing to these voters in the future with visits to obviously Catholic settings such as social service agencies and universities. He called the speech the kick-off of Clinton's "Catholic campaign" and compared it to Bush's "evangelical campaign." 
Clinton's speech also made an appeal to "Reagan Democrats," democrats who began voting republican during the Reagan years, said Schmuhl. Many of these "Reagan Democrats" are Catholic, and Clinton sees them as a vital constituency, he said. 
Leege called the speech an "appeal to the same Catholic values that stress that virtue is found in community service." Clinton mentioned several pro­grams of Notre Dame's Center for Social Concerns (CSC) and described his plan to provide college loans that students would repay by performing community service. 
Father Don McNeill, director of the esc. said that he sent the Clinton campaign information about the Center and the work it does prior to the governor's visit because Clinton "wanted to understand (the mission of the CSC) better."

Senate reviews statement 
By KENYA JOHNSON News Writer 
A subcommittee of the Mis­sions, Opportunity, and Chal­lenges of the Colloquy for the Year 2000 presented the Mis­sion Statement of the University of Notre Dame to the Student Senate last night. 
Before writing the document, the group researched mission statements of other universities. said Kathleen Maas Weigert, Academic Coordinator of the Center for Social Concerns and member of the committee. 
The length of the statement was questioned by many sena­tors. "Frankly, students are not going to read through something this long," said Se­nator Tylor Farmer. 
Farmer also said the docu­ment tends to be redundant. 
Similarly, Senator Rich Dele­van thought the document re­flected that it was compiled by a group. "This is a committee document. It is not written by a single mind, and it reads that way. It seems to have trouble in its length cohering as a sin­gle clear statement as to where the university is going." 
Although some agreed, Stu­dent Vice President Molly O'Neill did not. "I think one of the problems before was that there was never· a clear, official mission statement. I applaud the committee on its specifica­tion because it leaves little room for interpretation. If having a coherent, clarified document means more pages, than I'd rather it be long," said O'Neill. 
Weigert also explained that the committee realizes students will not be reading the mission statement everyday. "We know that after one reading it will probably be shelved away. Our hopes are that the mission statement will be a guide for the students here. It is not only a document, but a creed that should be lived out by stu­dents," said Weigert. 
Other concerns expressed were the stress on a "research university" and the lack of emphasis on acceptance of student individuality.

71 students receive citations 
BY JULIE BARRETT Assistant News Editor 
Seventy-one students, pre­dominantly from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and area high schools, were cited Friday night at Turtle Creek and Campus View Apartments for con­tributing to the delinquency of minors and minors in con­sumption, according to Sgt. Charlie Feirrell of the St. Joseph County Police. 
Officers were called to Turtle Creek Apartments by a private security firm working at the complex to assist a female ju­venile who had passed out from alcohol intoxication, according to police reports. 
Once there, officers saw hun­dreds of young people openly drinking beer in the parking lots and surrounding area, Feirrell said. 
"The place was a madhouse," he said. "Even Ray Charles could have seen that party." 
According to Feirrell, more officers arrived at the scene and began raiding parties, making close to 35 arrests and confiscating several kegs of beer. Several people were taken to the county jail. 
Officers proceeded to Campus View Apartments around 1 a.m. where they ticketed more students for underage drinking and furnishing alcohol to mi­nors, confiscated kegs and false IDs, and disbanded parties. 
Feirrell explained that the raids are "an exercise in pre­ventive police work" to protect students and prevent them from drinking and driving or from rendering themselves defenseless to others who may take advantage of their condi­tion. 
He added that police must also respond to citizens' com­plaints about the parties. 
"If students don't cooperate with the police, then we won't cooperate with them," Feirrel said. "Rather than write tick­ets, we'll incarcerate them if that's what is needed to get our point across about underage drinking and disorderly con­duct." 
Notre Dame students Michael Wulfe and William Watson were cited for contributing to the delinquency of miriors, a class C misdemeanor which carries up to one year in prison and a maximum fine of$1,500. 
Students cited for minor con­sumption of alcohol were Ti­mothy Gilroy of Carroll Hall; Raymond Cummings and Robert Leonard of Dillon Hall; Megan Blake and Julie Hurley of Farley Hall; Michael Regan of Fisher Hall; and Brian Casey, Shawn Donovan. Greg Kar­czewski, Dennis Macklin, John Minson and James Rooney of Planner Hall. 
Also cited were Joseph Cron­ley and Chad Gardner of Grace Hall; Mamie Diskin of Howard Hall; Jill Harris and Barbara Rasch of Knott Hall; John Paulsen of Morrissey Hall; Katherine Bessiere, Jennifer Brooks and Mary Colnillo of Pasquerilla East; and Tony Buf­fomante, Brendon Heatherman, Joseph McQuade, Sean Sullivan and Timothy Walsh of St. Edward's Hall. 
Also cited were Christopher Corbett, Frank Flynn and Kevin Monahan of Stanford Hall; George Dailey, Sean Druvan, Jeffrey Haynes, Robert O'Neil of Zahm; Benjamin Horan, Michael Mulhall and Connor Murphy of Turtle Creek. 
Saint Mary's students cited were Mary Kamra of Holy Cross Hall and Mary Nicknish of LeMans Hall. 

Kauai takes steps towards normalacy after devastation of hurricane 
LIHUE, Hawaii (AP) -Troops helped keep order in neigh­borhoods devastated by Hurri­cane Iniki and officials tended to more than 7,000 people in shelters as Kauai took its first halting steps toward normality. 
Federal officials said 10,000 homes were badly damaged when Hawaii's worst storm this century blasted across the re­sort island Friday. Most of the island's 70 hotels sustained se­rious damage. 
"Wherever you look, it's heartbreak alley," said Fred Allen, who said he rode out the hurricane in his bed with a bottle of gin. "This was one hell of a storm." 
Limited phone service was restored, giving the island's 52,000 residents their first link to the outside world since the storm hit. Water was restored to about half the island, includ­ing Lihue, the largest town. But it may take more than a week to get Lihue's power plant running, officials said. 
"We're getting some things done, but every time we fix one problem another one arises," said Kauai Mayor JoAnn Yukimura. 
Crews continued the daunting task of cleaning up utility poles, trees and pieces of buildings that gave way under Iniki's sustained wind of 130 mph and gusts to 160 mph. 
The hurricane was blamed for at least three deaths, including one 80 miles southeast on Oahu, and 98 injuries. 

The Coast Guard searched between Kauai and Niihau, a small neighboring island, for two people reported aboard a sailboat that sank as Iniki hit. A 50-year-old Kauai man who also was on the boat was res­cued Saturday after clinging to an ice chest for 21 hours. 
Federal disaster officials, criticized for slow response to Hurricane Andrew, directed a round-the-clock airlift of sup­plies. More than 600 National Guard troops were on the is­land, aided by members of the other armed services. 
The USS Belleau Wood, an amphibious assault ship, was en route to Kauai with 27 five-ton trucks, many Humvees, 10 field kitchens, field showers and about 300 troops, the Navy said. 
"We're here to help as much as possible and to give people a sense that they can rebuild their lives," said Patricia Saiki, chief of the U.S. Small Business Administration and a former congresswoman from Hawaii. "It's important for people to regain some normalcy." 
Motorists waited in lines two blocks long for gas, and people lined up outside grocery stores. Those without water service bled water heaters and hot tubs for drinking water. 
Paul Lucas, a roofing contrac­tor, said the people of Kauai are survivors. 
"People know each other here. It's like family. There are a lot of homeless but they are being taken care of," Lucas said. 
One shingle-stripped rooftop had the spray-painted words, "We're OK." A spray-painted sign in front of a church de­clared, "Pray!" 
Oahu escaped the worst of the storm, with an estimated $2.5 million damage to 163 private buildings. Niihau, a privately held island 25 miles west of Kauai, sustained only minor damage, said Roy Price, direc­

Three killed in Serbian fire 
SARAJEVO. Bosnia-Herze­govina (AP) -Mortar shells slammed into downtown streets Monday despite U.N. supervision of the heavy Serb weaponry ringing Sarajevo. At least three people were killed and 32 wounded. 
Meanwhile, the leader of Serb rebels in Bosnia joined the beleaguered republic's presi­dent in threatening to boycott peace talks this week in Geneva. 
Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serb rebels who have seized some two-thirds of Bosnian territory, warned that he would boycott the Geneva talks if the international com­munity imposed a total flight ban on Serbian military flights in Bosnian airspace. 
Karadzic's warning came after Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Muslim president, also threat­ened to stay away from Geneva because of continuing Serb at­tacks by artillery, tanks and warplanes. 
Bosnian government defense officials blamed Serb gunners in the hills for shelling Sarajevo, where residents had ventured onto the streets after a three­day lull in fighting. 
The officials claimed some of the rounds came from 120mm mortars, which Serb forces were to have placed under U.N. monitoring as of Saturday. 
There was no immediate in­dependent confirmation of who was responsible for the shelling. Serb leaders and some U.N.

Vesna Boban-Samarzic was on her way to work when she was felled by a mortar round, taking shrapnel in both legs. 
"I felt the pain and rolled un­der a parked car," she said as she arrived at the downtown military hospital. "Then ... an­other explosion and more pain." 
At least three people died en route to the military hospital, doctors said. Health officials said 32 wounded people arrived 
· at three main Sarajevo hospitals in a 90-minute time span. More than 10,000 people have been killed since Bosnia's majority Muslims and Croats voted on Feb. 29 for indepen­dence from Yugoslavia, spark­ing rebellion by the republic's Serbs. European Community foreign ministers agreed Saturday to support a U.S. proposal to im­pose a "no-fly" zone over Bosnia, following the suspected downing of an Italian relief plane to Sarajevo Sept. 3 that killed all four crew members. A statement by the govern­ment of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb Republic said that if Serb planes were completely grounded, Karadzic would "completely withdraw from the talks," because that "would disrupt the strategic balance in Bosnia-Herzegovina."

Karadzic. in a fax over the weekend to the the British news agency Press Association, said he supported a flight ban that would protect humanitarian planes. Those flights had been flying specific corridors. 
Izetbegovic charged that warplanes were backing addi­tional tanks brought into Bosnia by the Yugoslav army to step up attacks on Bosnian towns. 
"The towns of Sarajevo, Jajce, Gorazde, Gradacac, Bosanski Brod, Mostar, Bihac and many others in Bosnia-Herzegovina are under constant attack with enormous damage and casualties among the civilian population," Radio Bosnia­Herzegovina quoted Iz{ltbegovic as saying Sunday. 
"Under such circumstances negotiations in Geneva or any other location would be of no use," he said. 
The U.N.-sponsored talks were scheduled to begin Friday. All other attempts for a peace pact among the three warring factions have failed. 
The Serbian rebel air force is estimated to have about 50 fixed-wing aircraft and heli­copters based at Banja Luka in northwestern Bosnia. The planes were left behind by the departing Yugoslav military in June, and have repeatedly been used to attack Bosnian government positions. 
Government troops and their Croatian allies have no air force and their air defenses are con­sidered rudimentary. 
Keeling to speak at Saint Mary's on AIDS prevention 
By NICOLE MCGRATH 
News Writer 
Dr. Richard Keeling, current chair of the American College Health Association's task force on HIV infection and AIDS, will speak on "Sex, Alcohol and Self-Esteem: Finding Safety" Wednesday at Saint Mary's College. 
Keeling will speak twice, first at 3 p.m. in Carroll Auditorium, Madeleva Hall and again at 7 
p.m. in O'Laughlin Auditorium. 
According to Saint Mary's Health Director Gloria Chelminiak, Keeling's talk will focus on students' relationships with each other. 
"We want to spread our mes­sage. not through fear. but through an understanding that women and men should feel free to ask questions concern­ing any aspect of their rela­tions. of the counseling and health services department," Chelminiak said. 
"The real work of preventing the HIV disease starts in con­necting ourselves together in a caring community," said Keel­ing in the Sept. 2 issue of "The Chronicle of Higher Education." 
When AIDS awareness was first brought to students, edu­cators tried a technical way of explaining the disease, but stu­dents were slow to respond, Chelminiak said. 
Now a new aspect of "social

change" is being advocated by Keeling and many other pro­fessionals. 
"If we change some behav­iors, we can slow the disease by reaching out to everyone," Chelminiak said. "However, changing those attitudes will be a long process." 
Keeling spoke at Notre Dame three years ago, but few stu­dents attended the speech. More recently, as celebrities like Magic Johnson have been diagnosed HIV positive, young people are beginning to take a second look, said Chelminiak. 
The use of condoms, although forbidden by Catholicism, has been offered as a means of preventing AIDS. "I am an advocate of discussing your relationships and will answer questions about contraceptives, but I will not promote their use, said Chelminiak. "Contraceptives are not the answer to HIV pre­vention." 
Chelminiak hopes that Keel­ing's talks will trigger discus­sion. 
"I want young people to open up to each other and develop their relationships," she said. 
The programs are sponsored by the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame health services depart­ment. Local hospitals, high schools and middle schools have been invited to the dis­cussions as well as students and faculty.

Public reaction to Clinton's speech has incorporated "both sides of the story," according to Dennis Moore, director of Uni­versity Public Relations. 
Because Clinton is pro-choice, Moore said he has received some telephone calls saying the University "had no business allowing him to speak here," but the reaction has not been as severe as when pro-choice Senator Daniel Patrick Moyni­han received last year's Laetare Medal.

Iraqi Kurdish villagers India's population growing fast 

caught in Turks' conflict 
ORAH, Iraq (AP) -Tens of thousands of Iraqi Kurdish vil­lagers have been caught in the fight between Turkey and the Turkish Kurdish rebels who have sought sanctuary in northern Iraq. 
Turkish forces have shelled Kurdish villages suspected of harboring rebels of the Turkish Kurdish Labor Party, or PKK. Since August 1984, the PKK has been waging a separatist war in southeastern Turkey, which is home to half of the country's 12 million Kurds. 
Turkish officials believe two­thirds of the estimated 10,000 Turkish guerrillas are deployed outside the country's borders, mostly in Iraq. They are sus­pected of receiving arms from Baghdad. 
The rebels' forays into Turkey prompt punitive air raids and shelling by Turkey. 
The raids are supposedly against Turkish rebel bases in Iraq. 
But they have also pounded the homes Iraqi Kurds are trying to rebuild in villages destroyed by Saddam Hussein's army. 
Kurdish officials have esti­mated the death toll at more than 60 in about 40 raids since last year. 
In Orah, a Kurdish village on the Turkish border, 50 miles east of Zakho, an elderly Iraqi Kurd sought shelter from the sun under a canopy of dried branches. 
For nearly two months, he said, Turkish shells have rained down on the valley at dusk from a ridge on the border a half­mile away. 
"We send the women and children behind that rock," he said, pointing to a large boulder at the edge of tomato fields. 
Several tents had small shrapnel holes. About 50 yards away, an unexploded 120mm shell was half buried in the base of a tree. 
Orah is among some 4,000 
_ villages systematically leveled 
by the Iraqis over the past two 
decades. Now their homes are 
under fire again. 

Since being rescued by an al­
lied coalition force after Sad­
dam's army crushed their re­
bellion last year, about 750 
Iraqi Kurds have returned to 
rebuild their houses destroyed 
first in 1976 and again in 1988. 

Faisal Ramadan, a villager in 
traditional khaki tunic, baggy 
pants, checkered turban and a 
colorful sash on his waist, led 
an unsuccessful peace mission 
on Aug. 23. 

"We walked up the mountain 
with a white flag. An officer 
came with some soldiers and 
we told him that there were no 
guerrillas in the village. He 
promised to stop firing, but 
shells keep coming," he said. 

Some Iraqi Kurdish guerrillas 
said there had been at least two 
PKK camps nearby, at Haftanin 
and Nazhdur about 30 miles 
northeast of Zakho. 

Abdurrahman Omar, a local 
Iraqi guerrilla commander, said 
20 villages had come under 
attack in the region where the 
borders of Turkey, Iraq and 
Iran meet. Kemal Fouad, a 
Kurdish official, said PKK 
guerrillas hold 40 to 50 villages 
in the area and have barred 
Iraqi Kurds from returning. 

Earlier this month, Massoud 
Barzani, a Iraqi Kurdish guer­
rilla leader, announced his 
forces would oust the Turkish 
Kurdish rebels from northern 
Iraq -by force if necessary. 

"Everything has its limits and 
we are not able any more to 
endure what the PKK is doing. 
Either we must leave the area 
for the PKK, or they must leave 
it for us," Barzani said. 

Barzani, who earlier had met 
with Turkish officials in Ankara, 
apparently made the pledge in 
return for a Turkish promise to 
refrain from further military 
strikes in Iraq. 

But the attacks have already 
caused much suffering. 

Correction 
An article in Monday's Observer misquoted a portion of Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Clinton's Friday speech at Notre Dame. The quotation should have read, "We know in this room, at least, our supporters can win the cheering contest. I would hope that in this great university, we could also prevail in the civility contest." The Observer regrets the error.

NEW DELHI, India (AP) ­Population experts today criti­cized India's birth-control policy for its focus on sterilization and said the country's mushrooming population may become the world's largest in the 21st century. 
India was one of the first Third World countries to un­derstand the need to check its growth, and has had a family planning program since 1951. 
But stifling government bu­reaucracy and central planning has hampered implementation, said a study released today by the Washington-based Popula­tion Crisis Committee. 
India's estimated population of 883 million is growing about 2 percent annually, compared with the U.S. growth rate of 0.8 percent and 1.5 percent in China, which has about 1.2 bil­lion people. 
At those rates, the report said, India's population will surpass China's in the early decades of the next century. 
Although the average number of births for Indian women has fallen from six to four, the committee said India's goal of reaching two births per woman by the end of the century was unrealistic. 

The average today is 2.5 in China and 2 in the United States. 
India has stressed female sterilization because it is easier to monitor than temporary contraception methods. Also, many rural Indian women are illiterate and do not understand how to use birth control de­vices. 
Beginning 17 years ago, the government broadened its sterilization program, offering compensation to women who underwent the operation and bonuses to state officials for meeting targets. 
Widespread resentment eventually led to demonstra­tions and riots against family planning. 
It was one reason for Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's fall from power in 1977. Many politicians responded by playing down the importance of contraception. 
In recent years, the policy shifted toward other contra­ception methods, says the 60­page report. 
But sterilization targets re­main, and the field staff re­sponsible for carrying out the policy believe "that their ca­reers depend on meeting these targets," it says. 
"In some states, local-level administrators receive sub­stantial rewards for achieving specific numbers of steriliza­tions," the report continues. Those that don't meet their quotas "are threatened with stoppage of salaries and finan­cial penalties." 
Younger women who don't want to be sterilized often are unaware of other options. As a result, only 45 percent of Indian couples use contraception, far below the 72 percent of China and 7 4 percent in the United States, said the committee.

Bush defends his environmental plans: "rational and reasonable"

ELECTION '92 
SAN DIEGO, Calif. (AP) ­President Bush said today his environmental policies are "rational and reasonable" and accused Democrat Bill Clinton of promoting "the old command and control mentality" toward protecting natural resources. 
Speaking to 200 land devel­opers and land owners at the Penasquitos Canyon Ranch nature preserve here, Bush promised that his environmen­tal approach would strike a bal­ance between protecting re­sources and preserving jobs. 
"A strong economy and a clean environment not only can but must go hand in hand," he said. He added: "Extremism on either side is no virtue." 
The president said Clinton has had a poor record on envi­ronmental protection in Arkansas and suggested he would pursue extremist policies if he got to the White house. 
Clinton and the Democrats favor ''a philosophy that will not only cost jobs but impede ... 
environmental progress," Bush said. 
''I'll certainly match my envi­ronmental record against my opponent's," the president said. 
Responding, Clinton spokeswoman Avis Lavelle cited a 1. 3 3 million drop in manufacturing jobs nationwide over the last four years. At the same time, she said, the ad­ministration's Council on Com­petitiveness, headed by Vice President Quayle, has fought a number of environmental regu­lations. 
"This environmental presi­dent has given nothing but lip service to the environment and nothing but lip service to job creation," she said. 
The San Diego developers are concerned lest the federal gov­ernment add the gnatcatcher bird to the list of species threat­ened by land development and requiring special efforts to pre­vent its extinction. 
The gnatcatcher was pro­posed for the list of endangered species in 1991. Developers contend that listing of bird as endangered would harm the Southern California economy. 
The Interior Department in­tends to make a formal an­nouncement on the gnatcatcher this week, department spokesman Steven Goldstein said Sunday, although he sug­gested the department might call for further study, thus putting off a final decision on whether it should be added to the endangered list. 
Campaign aides concede that Bush's environmental stance is unpopular in many regions of the country, but the president is pressing the issue as a way of illustrating a broader theme closer to Americans' hearts: protecting jobs. 
Bush contends his approach strikes a proper balance be­tween protecting natural re­sources and putting jobs at risk by limiting commercial devel­opment.

Democrats' wives reject stereotypes 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Hillary Clinton and tipper Gore asked women on Monday to reject what they charged was a Re­publican campaign based on diversionary personal attacks and sexual stereotypes. 
"These next weeks we're go­ing to need your help," Mrs. Clinton told about 2,500 people -mostly working women -at a luncheon fund-raiser. 
"Fear and insecurity and anxiety and negativism will be abroad in the land," said the wife of the Democratic presi­dential nominee. 
"There will be much pointing of fingers. There will be much diversion and distraction and denial," she said. "It will not in any way make a difference ... to the homeless children in the shelters, to the families we met on the bus trips. But it'll fill the airwaves and fill the newspaper columns." 
Mrs. Gore, in introducing Mrs. Clinton, called her "a woman who has withstood a lot of unfair diversionary criticism because (Republicans) don't want to talk about their eco­nomic record and what they haven't done for families." 
"So they do what happens to women in this country," said the wife of Bill Clinton's run­ning mate, Sen. Al Gore. "We know it well. They stereotype us. They put us in a box. But it's not going to work this time."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Art controversy stirs faculty at both campuses 
Sculptures did not get a fair hearing 
Dear Editor: 
It would be irresponsible as an academic department to a!­low the comments made by Anna Marie Tabor about Marcia Kaplan's exhibition in Monday's issue of The Observer to stand without correction. They do a great disservice to the issues at hand. 
In Ms. Tabor's "Inside Col­umn," an obvious lack of infor­mation is distressing. 
Dr. Bruno Schlesinger, while a fine and learned colleague is not a Saint Mary's professor nor a faculty member of the Art De­partment. 
In her column Ms. Tabor suggests that more thoughtful placement for Marcia Kaplan's artworks might have alleviated the negative reception. 
These comments overlook a primary intent of the work. As the artist mentioned in her re­cent lecture on campus, these works were created to be ex­hibited in an outdoor content. This was in fact agreed to in contractual arrangements with the college prior to the exhibi­tion. 
This exterior setting played a critical role in the definition and exposition of Ms. Kaplan's aesthetic and expressive intent. 
With insensitivity to the artist's mode and the manner of expression A.M. Tabor suggests that Ms. Kaplan should have been invited to discuss her work prior to the exhibftion, ostensibly to alleviate the adverse reaction. Her state­ment reveals a fundamental lack of understanding of the creative process and experi­ence. 
To discuss, describe and de­fine these works prior to their installation or even shortly thereafter defeats the point and would be an injustice to the artist, the work and the audi­ence. 
By their nature these works pose fundamental questions of meaning to their audience, questions of interpretation which the artists seeks to have us address individually without a predefined interpretation. 
Ms. Tabor wrongly suggests that the answer precede the question. -a particularly inap­propriate solution in an envi­ronment which should, in its ideal, seek these answers through reasoned discourse. 
In the conclusion of her commentary, Ms. Tabor states that poor judgment and plan­ning were the cause of lost op­portunities in this exhibition. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
The simple fact is that reac­tionary intolerance is to blame here. In an institution where "Reasoned, if occasionally pas­sionate, discourse" should be the rule. 
Ms. Kaplan's work hardly got a fair hearing.

Assistant Professors Sept. 10, 1992 Dear Editor: 


By this letter we would like to show our support for our col­leagues in the Art Department at Saint Mary's College and those individuals who serve on the Moreau Gallery Board. 
By bringing quality exhibi­tions of the work of contempo­rary artists to the campus, they have enhanced the cultural life of the entire community. 
We are saddened and dis­turbed by the recent vandalism to the sculpture of Marcia Ka­plan, because such behavior indicates a closed-minded and intolerant attitude that is totally inappropriate in an academic environment. 
It is our hope that this inci­dent will not curtail future ex­hibitions of outdoor sculpture offered under the "Sculpture on the Grounds" program.

Film Critic 
In more than 140 years of competition, the United States has lost the America's Cup only once. 
"Wind" is the dramatic, fictional account of an upstart group of American challengers whose drive to win the back sailing's top prize plunges them into a world where money, power, love and ambition are inextricably intertwined. 
Carroll Ballard's ("Black Stallion") latest endeavor traces the insatiable desire of Will Parker (Matthew Modine) to regain the treasured Cup which was lost due to his blunder two years earlier. 
The loss has destroyed him both mentally and physically-his only hope for self rejuvenation is to avenge his loss and to restore sailing's most prestigious honor to the American people. Parker and his band of maritime bad boys are the rabble-rousers of

The film's first shortcoming is its choice of subject matter. A cinematic work depicting the "zany" world of America's Cup racing is not going to cause as much of an emotional stir as the Bobby Fischer/Borris Spasky chess match over in Yugoslavia-each will have its audience, but no one really cares. 
However, I figured that perhaps the film would have an interesting portrayal of the developing relationship between Will Parker and his

Good guys wear black, but the White Sox looked like the bad guys to Yankee fans in New York last night.

Cadaret rings Sox's Bell 
NEW YORK (AP) -Leave it to George Bell to stir up a sleepy September game. 
The Chicago White Sox beat the New York Yankees 8-6 Monday night in a game inter­rupted by a bench-clearing in­cident in the eighth inning. 
Bell, Chicago's designated hitter, thought reliever Greg Cadaret was throwing at him and took a few steps toward the mound. The benches and bullpens emptied. 
Yankees batting coach Frank Howard, who stands 6-foot-8, walked to the plate and chal­lenged Bell, but the player was held off by teammates and order was restored by the um­pires. 
"Nobody respects George Bell more than me," Howard said. "In reality I should have kept my mouth shut. As a coach you're here to help stop those things." 
"I didn't think there was go­ing to be a fight," said White Sox manager Gene Lamont. "The pitch looked like it was behind him, but I don't think George was trying to intimidate the pitcher." 
After Bell got back into the batter's box, someone in the stands threw a ball that barely missed him. 
In the sixth inning, Bell swung at a 3-0 pitch while be­ing intentionally walked and drew some boos from the crowd. 
"I have no comment," Bell said. 
Wilson Alvarez (5-3) gave up five hits and four runs in six innings to get the victory. Roberto Hernandez, the fourth Chicago pitcher, got the last four outs for his ninth save. 
Lance Johnson, Frank Thomas and Dale Sveum drove in two runs each for the White Sox. Sveum homered in the sixth to give the White Sox a 7­4lead. 
With the scored tied 4-4 in the fifth, Johnson hit a two-run triple with two out off rookie Bob Wickman (3-1). Wickman was an emergency starter for the Yankees in place of Scott Sanderson, who was scratched just before the game started because of a pulled muscle in his upper right back. 
Wickman failed in his attempt to become the first Yankees pitcher to win his first four ma­jor league decisions since Whitey Ford did it in 1950. Ford started his career 9-0.

Sherrill axes bull Mississippi State coach makes demonstration to motivate team 
STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) ­Mississippi State coach Jackie Sherrill says he allowed a bull to be castrated in front of his football team prior to a Sept. 5 victory over the Texas Longhorns as an educational and motivational experience. 
"The whole story came when I asked our players what a steer was and none of them knew what a steer was," Sherrill said Sunday. "People say (the Texas mascot) is a longhorn steer. Is that a bull, or is he a steer?" 
Sherrill said the castration was performed in front of the team for two reasons, with ed­ucation "probably the biggest reason." 
Sherrill said motivation was another reason in the week leading up to the Texas game. Asked how the demonstration would motivate his team, the coach said, "That's every­body's different perception." 
Mississippi State, currently 1-1 and ranked No. 24, defeated Texas 28-10. 
University President Donald Zacharias said Sunday he had talked briefly with Sherrill and athletic director Larry Templeton about matter. "I don't have any comment at this time," Zacharias said. 
John Harkness, associate dean of Mississippi State's vet­erinary medicine school, ques­tioned the appropriateness of the castration on the practice field. 
"It's my personal opinion that to do that procedure in that context causes me concern," Harkness said. "As a veterinarian concerned with the treatment of animals at Mississippi State, I think it was out of place." 
The incident came to light after a complaint was filed last week with the Animal Rescue League. 
The calfs owner performed the castration and Sherrill said there was nothing inhumane about it because, "they were going to perform the castration anyway. A guy from the vet school, his assumptions and his comments are not valid. We didn't do anything inhumane to an animal. 
"The calf is standing in living color today going about his business. Let me put it this way: I don't think that calf was embarrassed. 
"I don't think that anybody can make a comment about what went on if you were not present. The people that have made the comments are not the people who were there. It's like me giving an opinion about what's going on in a laboratory. I'm not there." 
Harkness said he had not called the procedure inhu­mane, but felt it was performed in an inappropriate context.

Houston blanks Giants on four hitter 
HOUSTON (AP) -Willie Blair held San Francisco to an infield single over six innings to lead the Houston Astros to a 5-0 victory over the Giants on Monday night. 
Blair (5-6) was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the sixth after striking out seven and walking two. It was Blair's first win as a starter this season in five starts. Xavier Hernandez allowed three hits over the last three innings for his seventh save. 
San francisco rookie Kevin Rogers (0-1) gave up four runs on six hits in five-plus innings. He struck out five and walked one. 
The Giants' only hit off Blair came when Darren Lewis beat out a slow roller to lead off the fourth. Lewis' roller was fielded by third baseman Ken Caminiti, whose throw barely missed getting Lewis. 
Houston took a 1-0 lead in the fourth when Jeff Bagwell hit his 14th home run of the season. 
The Astros increased their lead to 4-0 in the sixth after a single by Steve Finley, a walk to Caminiti, and a single by Bagwell loaded the bases. Pete Incaviglia singled to score Finley and bring in reliever Mike Jackson. 
Jackson walked pinch-hitter Luis Gonzalez to score Caminiti, and Bagwe[l scored on a sacri­fice fly by Casey Candaele. 
The Astros added a run in the seventh when Craig Biggio doubled and scored on a single by Caminiti. 
Phillies 6, Expos 2 PHILADELPHIA -Philadelphia damaged Montreal's NL East title hopes Monday night as rookie Braulio Castillo's first major league homer, a three­run shot, led the Phillies to a 6­2 victory over the Expos. 
Montreal began the game three games behind first-place Pittsburgh, which played at St. Louis after losing two of three to the Phillies over the weekend while the Expos swept the New York Mets in Montreal. 
Expos starter Brian Barnes 
(6-6) had a perfect game and a 2-0 lead until the bottom of the fifth when Dave Hollins opened with an infield single and Darren Daulton walked. Castillo, who entered the game in the second inning after Stan Javier left due to tightness in his back, then homered to left field. 
The Phi!Iies added a run in the six-th when John Kruk dou­bled with two outs and went to third on a wild pitch. Hollins walked and Daulton lined a run-scoring single to center for his NL-leading lOOth RBI. Daulton is the first Philadelphia player to drive in 100 runs since Mike Schmidt (133) and Juan Samuel (100) in 1987 and the first left-handed batter to do it since Bill White drove in 103 in 1966. 
Philadelphia's Tommy Greene (3-1), making his second start since coming off the disabled list, allowed two runs on seven hits in six innings to earn the victory. He struck' out three and walked one.

Oakland pulls away in West 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -For now, the Oakland Athletics simply have winning on their mind. 
Next on the list are the Minnesota Twins, whose season hangs in the balance as they prepared-for a three-game series, which began Monday night, against the the A's. It's the final matchup between the AL West's top teams, with the A's holding a six-game lead. 
A sweep by the A's would drop their magic number for clinching the division from 14 to 6 by Wednesday night. 
"That's the best advantage of playing your way into first place," A's manager Tony La Russa said. "You don't have to think about anybody else. All you have to do is keep win­ning." 
The /\s had a chance to keep winning over the weekend with a four-game series against the Seattle Mariners. They swept all four games, providing the Twins with a unique dilemma: Sweep, or fade away. 
"This club's not looking ahead," La Russa said. "We're concentrating on the games we're playing, and that's a re­ally good sign." 
The A's have marched to the top, not with one spectacular run, but with a series of steady winning streaks. The A's have won five straight games at least six different times this season. 
Currently, they're on a  six­ 
game winning streak.  
"You  think  about  it:  
'Minnesota's  coming  in;  

Minnesota's coming in,"' relief ace Dennis Eckersley said. "But what you're really thinking about is, 'We've got a chance to win it. Right now."' 
The pressure is on the Twins. 
"We win all three games. I would say that's a nine-game lead, and that would be real good," Mark McGwire said. He was in the starting lineup Sunday for the first time in 23 days after going on the disabled list with a rib cage injury. 
McGwire said the his return for the Twins was just a coinci­dence. 
"When I first injured it, and we looked at the schedule, the Minnesota series was the one where I'd be back, anyway," McGwire said. "So it's no sur­prise. The injury I had was a three-week injury."

Bosio shuts out Boston 
BOSTON (AP) -Chris Bosio tied a Brewers' record by win­ning his eighth consecutive de­cision, pitching four-hit ball for eight innings Monday night to lead Milwaukee over the Boston Red Sox 6-0. 
Milwaukee's first four batters all singled off Danny Darwin {8-8), giving the Brewers a 2-0 lead. Greg Vaughn added a sacrifice fly in the first and a two-run homer in the sixth. 
Bosio {14-5) is unbeaten in 12 starts since July 9. He struck out three, walked none, didn't give up an extra-base hit and didn't allow a runner past first. He threw just 71 pitches -52 for strikes -as he matched the club record for consecutive victories shared by Mike Caldwell, Pete Vuckovich .. and Moose Haas. 
Dwayne Henry finished with a perfect ninth. Robin Yount had three hits, raising his ca­reer total to 3,004. Milwaukee, which began the day trailing AL East leader Toronto by six games. won its third straight. Last-place Boston lost for the fifth time in six games. 
Darwin gave up all six runs and 10 hits in seven innings, struck out four and walked

Trudeau, Indianapolis ailing 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -Jack Trudeau remained hospitalized Monday with a severely bruised back, leaving coach Ted Marchibroda with one healthy quarterback and probably two days to decide what to do next. 
With starter Jeff George still out with a thumb· injury, the Colts waived Mark Herrmann last week to make room for Trudeau, a preseason holdout. But Trudeau lasted only one quarter on Sunday, and third­stringer Tom Tupa finished up in the Colts' 20-10 loss to Houston. 
Indianapolis (1-1) plays on Sunday at Buffalo (2-0). the team Marchibroda served as offensive coordinator before coming to the Colts in January. 
There's a chance the Colts will try to sign another quar­terback -possibly even Herrmann -but the longer they wait, the fewer options they'll have, especially since George has not progressed as quickly as he thought he would. 
'Til have to wait to see how Jeff and Jack are. It's· a gamble, naturally," Marchibroda said. ''I'll have to make a decision on Wednesday. I haven't even looked (at who is available), to be honest. I wouldn't even venture a guess. 
"I talked to Jack this morning and he sounded like he was better, but I'm not sure the doctors are as optimistic as he is," Marchibroda said. ''I'm probably going to wait until Wednesday to see how he is, but he sounded confident." 
Herrmann, waived a day after he quarterbacked the Colts to their first season-open­ing victory in nine years, was on the way to Phoenix for a look by the Cardinals, who lost Timm Rosenbach with a sepa­rated right shoulder on Sunday. 
Sunday night, Herrmann said he hadn't heard from the Colts and wasn't sure what he would do if they asked him to return. 
''I'd have to get some kind of guarantee," he told The Indianapolis News. ''I'd hate to come back for one game and then be gone again." 
Trudeau, who fumbled and then recovered the ball for a 12-yard loss on the first play of the game, hit 4 of 5 passes for 36 yards. He was hit from be­hind by Houston linebacker AI Smith as he scrambled for a 1­yard gain to the Oilers' 20 on the fir~t play of the second quarter. Dean Biasucci kicked a 37 -yard field goal on the next play, the Colts' only scoring until Tupa hit Anthony Johnson with a 3-yard TD pass with 6 seconds left in the game. 
Tupa was 10 for 20 with 128 yards and was intercepted once. 
Marchibroda said the game film showed Trudeau had not been "speared," an illegal hit by the defender's helmet. 
"It was a legitimate hit," he said. 
"Overall, it's hard to beat a team like Houston when you're playing with your third quar­terback," Marchibroda said. "We had the opportunity to make some big plays but didn't. They controlled the game and we never made a big play offensively or defensively." 
The Oilers' Warren Moon was 29 of 39 for 361 yards and two touchdown.

GAME POINT 


For Irish in the polls, ties are not even 
"It shouldn't hurt us that bad." 
That was the prevailing thought in the minds of Rick Mirer and the vast majority of the Notre Dame campus after Saturday's stalemate with Michigan. 
After all, the Irish played a tie game with an evenly-matched team, and even showed some spunk with a 10-point fourth-quarter comeback. They did this without the services of their All­American linebacker and best defensive player. 
Most, including Mirer, thought there would be no chance we would be dropped behind the South's Worst Conference champ Texas A&M, and there was certainly no way they would let Michigan leapfrog us, after starting three spots ahead of the Wolverines and playing to a deadlock. 
This thought was wrong. Dead wrong. As in dead national championship hopes, at least for now. 
The national media and coaches have turned the polls into an avenue for exacting revenge on Notre Dame for our supposed "Holier than thou" attitude. The media has always had a love-hate relationship with Notre Dame football over the years, being that they know stories about Notre Dame always attract attention, but most would love to see our noses rubbed in the dirt. 
And that's exactly what they did this week, taking Coach Holtz's play calling in the final 65 seconds of the game and using it to happily nail the Irish's national championship hopes to the wall. They have labeled us the Tying Irish, and it was reported in yesterday's Chicago Tribune that three Associated Press voters, after hearing Mirer's optimism about the tie's impact on the polls, snuck a look at each other as if to say something like, "Guess again Rick." 
We have also all been informed that tie is now a three-letter word, and it is spelled L-0-U. Does this sound like ob­jective reporting, especially from someone who has a stake in the vote for this year's national champion? 
Granted, Holtz's decisions were probably the worst since he put names on the back of our uniforms. Everyone will agree that if the Irish would have instilled the same one-minute drill they successfully employed against Tennessee last year, they would have had a better chance to win the game. But the issue is that if Notre Dame would have driven and still been unable to score, would the writers have dropped us four spots? 
I think the answer is no, and that means the writers have penalized the Notre Dame football program and possibly cost the seniors their shot at a national championship because of two plays, and the philosophy behind them, when they had no direct impact on the outcome of a classic game. 
Holtz has admitted he is not sure he made the right decision, but he did not realize that it may have cost him a chance at his second national champi­onship. It is vengeful, indescribable, and downright unfair.

Men, women golfers tee off 
By DAVE STUMM

Both the men's and women's golf teams gave the school something to cheer about this weekend as each of them started out impressive in their respective tournaments. 
The men's golf team started off the fall season on the right foot Sunday, as they stormed to a second place finish out of fifteen teams at the Indiana Intercollegiates at the University of Purdue. The Irish finished just eight shots behind tournament winner Ball State. 
Senior co-captain Chris Dayton fired a two-round total of 144, tied for second and one shot out of first place. His counterpart, senior Joe Dennen, shot a 150 and finished tied for tenth. 
Sophomores Mike Chaney and Cole Hanson tied for twelfth with 151 's each. Chris O'Connell rounded out the scoring, coming in with a 155. 
The team's next competition is Thursday at the Cincinnati Invitational, as they hope to capitalize on this strong season opening showing. 
At the Illinois State Redbird Invitational this weekend, the women's team finished a satisfying ninth out of nineteen teams. The team showed a definite improvement over last year, when they finished in eleventh place against the same field. 
Junior Alicia Murray led the team with a three­round 240 (81-77-82). Senior captain Kathy Phares struggled with a 247, weighted by putting trouble. 
Trouble on the greens was the story of the weekend for the Irish, as most of the team had problems with the course's tough greens. Coach Tom Hanlon felt this really kept the team down. "We did not putt well, but we're getting better and better each time we go out." 
Hanlon was satisfied, but not completely happy. "We're more capable than this, and we'll show it next weekend." 
The women prepare this week for the Ferris State Invitational, looking to keep up their gradual improvement.

Last season, the Belles took the Cougars in three games 15-9, 15-9, 15­

"This is a game where we have to guard against beating ourselves and getting too lax," stated Schroeder-Biek. 
#23 vs. Valpo

The Notre Dame men's soccer team has a plan. 
And if they stick to that plan, they will likely chalk up their 22nd consecutive win over Valparaiso tonight at Alumni Field. 
The Crusaders have never beaten the Irish in the 15-year old series, although they gave them quite a scare last season. 
Brendan Dillman rescued Notre Dame with a goal late in the game to give them a 1-0 win. 
'They played us tough last year," Notre Dame coach Mike Berticelli said. "We can't sit back against a team that is or­ganized and will play good defense or we could very well lose." 
Not likely. 

As they showed Friday night against Illinois-Chicago, the Irish can be a very dangerous team. 
In the 7-0 win, five different players scored, and the defense held UIC's explosive offense to just four shots on goal. 
But the burden of being the favorite can be even heavier than the burden of being the underdog. 
"The key to a game that you're expected to win is to go in with a plan and stick to it," Berticelli said. 
Some players who will have key roles in that plan include forwards Jean Joseph, Tim Oates and Bill Lanza, all of whom are expected to lead the Irish offense this season. 
Senior captain Mario Tricoci anchors the defense, along with senior Kevin Pendergast and junior Mike Palmer. Pendergast and Palmer are in their first season on the defense, after shifting from midfield during the preseason and both have proven to be valuable assets on the back line. 
With that kind of talent on both sides of the ball, Valparaiso doesn't appear to pose much of a threat for the Irish, but they have to execute the plan. 
"We need to stick to our tactical plan," Berticelli said. "We have to keep converting our scoring opportunities and keep constant pressure on their de­fense."
