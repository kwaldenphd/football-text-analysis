New directive 
limits Stepanuse 
By TOMJACKMAN 
and BOB VONDERHEIDE 
News Staff 

All futurt· Polish Weddings, Irish 
Wakes and movie showings in 
Stepan Center have been per­
manently cancelled by the Univer­sity, as a result of two letters sent to Student Union Director Bill Lawler la.~t week. 
The letters, one by Dean of Stu­dents James Roemer and one by Director of Student Activities James McDonnell, were spurred by what McDonnell termed "numerous repons of drunkenness and illness" as a result of the Student Union­sponsored "Polish Wedding." The annual event, held in Stepan Center dring Welcome Week, featured non­alcoholic refreshments and live 
music, but McDonnell's letter 
charges that "most of the 900-plus 
students brought alcohol into 
Stepan Center." 

The "Irish Wake," a similar pany­
type event sponsored by Student 
Union, is held annually during the 
An Tostal festival in April. Feature­
length films arc shown occasionally 
In Stepan Center also, in a more in­
formal atmosphere than those shown in other campus buildings. 
McDonnell said in his letter that his attention to the matter was drawn Initially by the posters advcnising the Polish Wedding, whkh said "BYOB," and featured a beer can. 
Lawler, in an earlier letter, apologizt·d to the administration and accepted full responsibility for the advenising, claiming he wa.~ un­aware of Dulac's prohibition of al­cohol promotion on campus. 
However, it was the event itself 
whkh inspired Roemer and McDon­
nell to take action. McDonnell 
wrote, "never have I received 
reports to this extent concerning 
any event." He also observed that 
"we sec similar trends (of BYOB) in 
LaFortune at the Nazz and Chautau­
qua." 
Dean Roemer, whose letter was shoner than McDonnell's, stated that "as of now, this tradition is ended." He added that "none of these alcohol rules are new. Alcohol is never allowed in Stepan Center." 
The sanctions also include a stipulation that all future advenising must state that alcohol is not per­mitted, and this must also be stated on admission tickets. "On-site security will have to be increased," McDonnell wrote, "and procedures instituted to ensure that alcohol is not carried into Stepan." 
Lawler was unavailable for com­
ment last night. 
McDonnell suggested that "perhaps it would be better holding events in the ACC, dining hall, Engineering Auditorium, and Wash­ington Hall -locations in which we have not experienced the alcohol 
problems associated with a Stepan event." 
Two other major student­sponsored activities held in Stepan Center -the Collegiate Jazz Fes­tival and the Country Rock Jam ­were not cancelled by the ad­ministration. but McDonnell has in­structed that the new sanctions apply to these events as well.

Roemer toughens 
stand on alcohol abuse

~Jew.~ Staff 
Dean of Students James Roemer, 
in Issuing his annual alcohol 
dirt•ctivc banning kegs of beer on 
campus, included a new, specific 
fint· of S I 00 for all students having a 
keg on University grounds. 
A S I 00 fine is also the penalty for carrying alcohol on campus-owned grounds, or for drinking alcohol inside the football stadium, accord­ing to the dire<.·tive. 
Roemer, by spelling out the specific fines, sees the directive as an indication ofa "tougher stand" on al­cohol abuse at Notre Dame. 
"An awful lot ofpeople here abuse 
alcohol," Roemer said. "As part ofan 
educational institution. there's no 
way wt· can look the other way. We 
want to deal with the problem in a 
strong, dfcctivc way." 
Before tht· changes were made, 
Roemer consulted Student Body 
President Don \lurday, Judicial 
Coordinator Carol Silva, and Hall 
Presidents' Council President Mike 
Martin for their reactions. 
Murday feels the keg fine is far too 
high and that it will not deter al­
cohol abuse. "You can get drunk just 
as well off tans a.~ off kegs," he said, 
adding that kegs are more economi­
cal and easier to clean.

Donor contributes $5 million for complex 
ByJOE LUBBEN 
News Staff 

A grant of so; million by an anonymous donor will enable the Uni­versity to build a new faculty office complex on the southeast quad­rangle behind O'Shaughnessy Hall. 
The long-awaited building will house the offices ofthe faculty in the College of Ans and Letters that are presently located in the basement of the Memorial Library. 
The anonymous grant will provide most of the funding for the project, which will not only alleviate the present cramped condition offaculty offices, hut also create room for expansion of the University Library collection in the area now used by the profesors. 
According to Donald Dedrick, director of the physical plant, the 
building is in a "schematic planning stage." He explained, "right now 
we're deciding what type offacilities we will have, without doing any 
actual designing." It will be at least a year, he said, before bids are 
t~ken for the actual construction. However. Dedrick predicted "it's going to be an exciting building." 
Improvement on the present situation of the faculty offices for Arts and Letters is definitely needed. according to acting Dean Robert Burns. "The offices are cramped," Burns said. "We simply don't have adequate office space." 
He added that "the faculty are like moles living underground there (in the library basement)." The new facility will have windows for natural light in all the offices, according to Burns. "This building will be a welcome improvement." 
While the faculty and students will have a better environment in which to meet, the Memo.rial Library will he gaining a fair amount of space from the vacated offices in its basement. Though ht· said it is still to early to make definite plans for utilizing that space, Director oftht• Libraries Robert Miller speculated that "any space opened up would be used primarily for expansion ofour collection." 
However, Miller explained that much remodeling would have to ht· done before the areas could be utilized. Miller estimated that it would he at least three years before such a project would be completed.

Solidarity's powerfulWarsaw branch proposed free 
elections in Poland yesterday in a draft resolution that put the inde­
pendent union on a new collision course with the communist regime. 
The delegates to the union's first national congress tried to sidestep another challenge to the government -a measure that would remove wording from the union charter acknowledging the leading role ofthe Communist Party. But the congress faced a procedural fight over the issue, and Gdansk delegate Lech Sobieszek worked furiously to put it back on the meeting's already packed agenda_ Meanwhile, the Polish Communist Party paper, Trybuna Ludu, said the support Solidarity expressed for free union activists throughout the Soviet bloc was "an 
attempt to interfere in the socio-political life of friendly ­(communist)-countries." "In plain language, the message is a call 
for changes in the existing social structures in other countries of realistic socialism, a call for creation ofsimilar organisms as. Solidarity, 
and a readiness to cooperate in such changes," the paper said. -AP 
Balking at any return to the "old ways of Nixon," Democratic congressional leaders assailed yesterday a drive by Presi­dent Reagan's supporters to reinstate executive authori,ty to withhold money Congress had voted to spend. Speaking to reporters upon Congress' return from a month-long recess, House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., D-Mass., said Reagan's "pie in the sky" economic predic­tions are falling apart. Meanwhile, Senate Democratic Leader Robert 
C. Byrd of West Virginia, said he saw an administration in disarray. House Republican Leader Robert H. Michel of Jllinois and Senate Majority Leader Howard H. BakerJr., R-Tenn., met with Reagan at the 
White House Tuesday to propose legislation that would give Reagan limited authority to impound -namely, not spend -appropriated funds. Richard M. Nixon repeatedly impounded federal funds when he was president. An anguished Democratic Congress enacted legislation which barred that practice in 1974. -AP 
Primary elections in the nation's largest city were ap­parently doomed yesterday when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to interfere with a voting rights ruling that barred today's scheduled vote. After hearing oral arguments in his chambers, Jusice Thurgood Marshall discussed the ca_~e with other justices by telephone, then issued a two-sentence ruling denying a stay. Tom Goldstein, a spokes­man for the mayor, said Corporation Counsel Allen Schwartz "has called the mayor and told him there'll be no citywide election tomor­row." Goldstein said, "There are options that can be pursued tomor­row," but he would not elaborate, saying only that "we will have further announcements tomorrow as options become clear." Schwartz, the city's top lawyer, had sought the stay from Marshall after failing to win reconsideration from the special three-judge panel that issued the ruling Tuesday. The ruling left campaigns in chaos and 
voters in confusion. -AP 
Tavern owner Ramona Desich testified yesterday that Ralph DeMeyer, at the time a candidate for St. Joseph County sheriff, offered to allow her to operate a house ofprostitution in exchange for campaign finanacing. DeMeyer later was elected, and remains in 



office. Mrs. Desich said the deal was offered during a meeting in February 1978 involving herself, DeMeyer and Edwin Hayden at Hayden's home in Mishawaka. Hayden, who was an organizer of DeMeyer's campaign, is an unindicted co-conspirator in the charge that accuses the sheriff of extorting money from Mrs. Desich from 1978-80 in exchange for protection of Mrs. Desich' prostitution operations. DeMeyer was indicted by a federal grand jury late last spr_ing. -AP 
Eighteen thousand Hoosiers wmtose welfare 
benefits Oct. 1, according to the head of the Indiana Department of Public Welfare, under new guidelines adopted by Congress. Robert F. Smith, the department's acting administrator, said federal, state and local expenditures for welfare in Indiana will dip about $20 million a year because ofthe changes. Smith said the new procedure involves a formula used to calculate eligibility for Assistance to Families with Dependent· Children and the related Medicaid. A more complicated system will be replaced by setting a maximum of 150 percent of the state standard of need for recipients which is based on size of family, said Marion N. Steffy, director ofpublic assistance. When a person gets a lump sum payment, such as an insurance settlement, she said, the money will be considered in determining AFDC eligiblity for that month. Also the amount that exceeds the monthly allowance for 
income will be used to judge continued ineligiblity, she said. -AP 
.Forty-six Chinese scientists say they believe 
they have found a rarity in the modem world -a pollution free spot. China's official Xinhua news agency said the conclusion followed ex­amination ofthousands ofanimal, plant, soil and water samples on the 8,182-foot Fanjing mountain in south China's Guizhou province. The secluded mountain in subtropical northeastern Guizhou usually is shrouded in clouds. Gray and gold-haired monkeys, as ancient and rare as China's prized Pandas, inhabit the mountain, the report said. It said most of the forest on Fanjing mountain still is virgin timber, and some of the medicinal and other plants there date back to anywhere from 2 million to 70 million years ago. -AP

Reagan assures U.S. support 


WASHINGTON (AP)-President Reagan, moving to allay Israel's con­cerns about U.S. arms deals with her Arab foes, assured Prime Minister Mcnachem Begin yesterday of un­flagging American support because "We know Israelis live in constant peril." 
Neither leader mentioned public­ly the pending !8.; billion package of U.S. arms to Saudi Arabia, which may face a threatened congressional veto next month, as they exchanged tributes in an elaborate welcoming ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. 
When the two men met privately, Begin outlined "quietly and without the slightest bit of rancor" his op­

position to the Saudi sale but did not ask Reagan to withdraw it, according to a senior ll.S. official who asked not

Still, that test on Capitol hill looms as extremely close, by all accounts, and the administration hoped Begin would indeed muffle his heretofore vehement opposition to the Saudi deal. In exchange, Reagan was ex­pected to offer even closer military links between Israel and the United States -including, possibly, intel­ligence gathered by American satellites. 
But Reagan left no doubt Arab countries have roles in his strategy to protect the Persian Gulf oilfields against Soviet encroachment. 
"Working with all our friends in the Middle East we seck to reinforce the security of the entire region," Reagan said in his public remarks. 
And yet, he said, "the security of Israel is a principal objective of this administration." 
"We know Israelis Jive in constant peril," Reagan declared at the ceremony under sunny skies. "But

Begin, who Is on his 12th visit to the United States, has assailed the Saudi arms sale as "endangering very seriously the security of Israel." It would give 62 American F-1 5s the Saudis arc buying the range to reach Israeli territory. Also included in the deal are five modern radar planes which operate as a far-seeing flyin~ot command post. 

In his speech, Begin stressed Is­rael's vulnerability. He said It had to fight five wars "out of necessity to defend our people and to save its ex· istencc and sustain our indepen­dence."

A rough draft, which the three stu­dent leaders examined, dictated that "other sanctions" would have been possible also for having kegs or for carrying alcohol. Murday said that Roemer struck that phrase from the directive altogether at the three stu­dents' request attempting to ·'eliminate any vagueness in the 
policy. 
Actually, a directive dated Sept. 4 
erroneously includes the "other 
sanctions" phrase on the keg fine, 
but a corrected directive dated 
today outlines just the SIOO fine.

Amnesia victim rediscovers wife 


By SHARON COHEN 
Associated Press Writer 
CHICAGO (AP) -When Larry Krusinski leaves the hospital for the first time in a year, he will go home to a wife he can't remember marry­ing, but a woman who cared so deeply for him that he fell in love with her twice. 
Krusinski is suffering from am­nesia -the aftermath of head in­juries suffered in a car accident that almost killed him. ' 
After 12 months in a hospital room, Krusinski will return home Saturday to join his wife, Jane, who ha~ twice inspired his love. 
The ordeal began one evening in September 1980 when Krusinski's car sma'ihed into a tree. Krusinski, thtn 2H, arrived at the hospital in a coma A priest gave him last rites. Doctors were not certain he would survive. 
But his wife was. 
TH URSDAYJ1im1li!i1!Mmi!!iim: 

:r;~::FOCUS 
"The one thing I remember was touching him for the first time there." she said. "I thought if I touched him, he'd be OK. God, he was still alive. 
"I remember people asking me if I was prepared if he would die," said Mrs. Krusinski. a 25-year-old beautician. "I just didn't think ofit. It was like a dream standing there." 
For I 0 anxious days, Mrs. Krusinski waited for signs that would give her hope. His eyes opened. His hands started moving. 
But wh<:n ht· looked into her eyes 
he saw a stranger. He didn't 
recognize the woman he had 
marrkd three years earlier. 
"I didn't rc:alize I wasn't going to 
bt· remembered," she said. "I kept 
trying to show him pi<:tures. He 
didn't rt·member them. He really 
Jidn't know what ht· looked like. He 
hadn't seen a mirror." 
The pa'it wa'i not a total blank. "He remembers his family and most of my family," she said. "fk could recall when he was a little kid just likt• yesterday. He recognized col­lege friends and stories they told. He t•vt·n remembered our first date when we went and played bingo." 
Program offers awards 
The Youthgrants Program of the 
National Enc'owment for the 
Humanities will once again offer a 
limited number <11 awards to young 
pt·ople in thdr teens and twenties to 
pursue non-credit, out-of-the­
classroom research projt•cts in the 
humanities. The deadline for receipt 
of cmpkted application forms is 
November 16, and funded projects 
begin the following May. 
lip to 7S grants will be awarded, 
offering as much as S2SOO for in­
dividuals and a few group grants up 
to J10,000 ( S I 5,000, for exception­
al media projects). Youthgrants are 
intended primarily for those be­
tween I H and 25 who have not yet 
completed academic or professional 
training but can demonstrate the 
ability to design and perform out­
standing humanities research and 
translate that into an end product to 
share with others. 
If you are interested in the 
program, a copy of the guidelines 
should be available for review at the 
Placement Office. 


But the memory of their home and their days together was wiped out. 
Still, Mrs. Krusinski wasn't frightened. She visited him almost every day, bringing him pizzas, tel­ling him funny stories and saying again and again that she loved him. "I was trying to bring his memory back," she said. 
Throughout the long days of waiting, she said, "He was real honest. He didn't remember me. But he really seemed to like me. He trusted me right away." 
And then one special day, after she told her husband she loved him, he repeated the words to her. 
"I think he fell in love with me all over again. He doesn't remember that he ever loved me before."

Don't drink, drive 
To enjoy a night out with friends at the local bar may sound like fun, but the thought of who's going to drive when it's time to leave is not. 
Alcohol-related driving accidents (one-half of highway fatalities) kill 25,000 people each year, with many of the victims simply innocent motorists who happen to collide with someone not responsible enough to realize the effects of alcohol on driving. Even with a high body tolerance to alcohol, the substance, a depressant, slowly creeps into one's system, dul­ling reflexes and judgement and creating a dangerous situation behind the wheel. 
In 1979, 4 7,000 individuals from 18-24 were arrested for driving while intoxicated, with the overall amounts totaling 977,300 males and 94,400 females arrested for the charge according to the Statistical Abstract of the United States. 
Millions of dollars are spent each year on various drinking-driver programs, but a 1979 study done by the federal Comptroller General's Office indicates that attitude is the problem. "Before any significant reduction in alcohol-related traffic accidents will occur, a long term con­tinuous educational commitment must be made. Governments, education­al institutions. and the general public need to work togetjler to change attitudes about drinking and driving," the report states. 
Society's accceptance and use of alcohol-too. much alcohol-is a large obstacle to solving the drinking-driver problem. The CGO report also cites a 1977 Gall up poll that reported 7 I percent of American adults indi­cated themselves as "drinkers" as opposed to "abstainers." Per capita consumption of alcohol has been increasing steadily over the past 20 years, weaving alcohol into almost every leisure setting-whether it be an ath­letic event, social gathering of friends and organizations, or the weekly ritual of "happy hour." Drinking, according to the CGO report, "is often associated with positive concepts in our society, such as maturity, glamour, and good times." 
Drinking and driving is unacceptable at all times. The Observer recently 
endorsed a keg proposal tor campus residence halls. We also endorse 
responsibility. Injury to yourself. or worse, to someone else, due to 
negligence is inexcusa~le. 
Whenever you drink, don't drive-ever. 
P.O. Box Q 
ND-SMC gays seek support 
Dear Editor: 
Over the last 12 years the Gay Stu­dents of Notre Dame-Saint Mary's College (GSND-SMC) have been meeting the needs of gay students in the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's com­munity. Continuing in this tradition 
we wish to inform gay students that there is an existing group of students willing to provide mutual support. 
It might help people to better un­derstand this group by stating some of the things we are not. We are not a JXllitical group concerned with wielding power within the University or anywhere else. We are not a group 
ND alum offers help 
Jear Editor: 
I read your editorial, "Whither o­. crime," (Sept. 2) with mu(.:h inter­est. As a landlord of many Notre Dame students and a former Domer myself (Class of 1981 ), I am very concerned with the crime situation. I have tried to be active in solutions to a very real problem. Last year, as a 
senior at ND, I met much resistance from all sides-administration, city and students. In spite of this. limited success was achieved, even in the 
face of apathy. As in past years, I would like to of freaks or whackos but a group ot 
normal, well-balanced, intelligent 
human beings indistinguishable on 
the whole from anyone else on campus. In fact, most people probably have gay friends without ever suspecting they are gay. Fur­ther, we are not interested in "recruiting" people to our ranks, but we are concerned with helping people who are questioning their sexuality in the generally repressive atmosphere here at ND-SMC. 
If you are a gay student, think you may be gay, or are just interested in finding out what being gay is all abou feel free to call the Gay Student Hotline at 283-6282 between 9 and 
II p.m. on Thursday nights, or write ND P.O. Box 206. Confidentiality is guaranteed. 
Gay Students of Notre Dame-Saint Mary's College 
offer whatever I can -to whom it may concern -my availability and concern with the safety of my "tenants," many of whom have become friends. The article made a few good points. However, my stu­dents arc not in this alone. They never have been and never will as long as I hac a say in it. Granted. people aren't beating a path to help them. Nonetheless, I am willing to do whatever I can-as a landlord or otherwise-to help improve things. The "status quo" is no more accept­able to me than it is to the ND stu­
dents living in any of my homes. 
Again, for whatever it is worth, I 
offer my help. Give me a call (234­
7968) or stop by any evening at 525 
NaJXJleon St. I welcome the chance 
to accomplish more improvements.

Thursday, September 10, 1981 -page 7 

If you desired, Thursday last. to take your news from evening televi­sion, and relied on CBS, you would have come upon the story of the South African incursion into Angola as follows: 
Dan Rather: "South Africa's in­cursion into Angola evoked con­demnations from governments arond the world -with one major excep­tion. The only vote supporting South 
Africa's right to participate in the dis­
cussion on the future of Namibia 
(was the United States) . . . Its lone 
support for the South Africans has 
evoked some comments." 
(Camera to Julian Bond, black ac­
tivist in Atlanta.) 
Bond: "This nation is a blot on the 
conscience of the world. For the 
United States to~ in alliance with it 
lowers us to a level that no president 
previously has ever done.'' 
(Camera to Andrew Young, for­
mer U.S. ambassador to the U.N., 
now running for mayor of Atlanta.) 
Young: "(The acti t on by the 
United States) will cost American 
corporations billions as black 
Africans take their business else­
where. Supporting racist South 
Africa in Angola, (we are) thereby 
sanctioning the slaughter of blacks 
by 4.5 million whites in a continent 
of 450 million blacks.'· 
(Camera to Donald McHenry, for­
mer U.S. ambassador to the U.N.) 
McHenry: "The U.S. risks being 
identified as a country which will do 
nothing unless we are opposing the 
Cubans and the Soviets ... we would 
go to the help of the devil.'' 
(Camera to an assistant to Dan 
Rather.) 
Assistant: "Black leaders arc 
planning to express protest . . . If 
South Africa is permitted to invade 
Angola without any protest, who is to 
say that Zimbabwe won't be next?" 
Had enough? There is no way in which that question can be negatively answered -because there is no more. I mean, that is CBS's entire treatment of the entire incident. three black leaders telling us that South Africa is a racist country, and that the United States, by voting for South Africa, is derivatively pro-racist. 

What happened? 
In 1975 the Cubans, directed by the Soviet Union, landed a detach­ment of troops in Angola. Their goal was, of course, to communize An­gola. To take advantage of a) the departure of the Portuguese, and b) the confusion in Washington over the 
loss of Saigon, to do to Angola what 
the communists were simultaneously 
doing to Mozambique and would 
later do to Ethiopia, i.e .• establish 
communist dictatorships aimed at 
About the Author: William F. Buckley, Jr., one of the most con­troversial public figures in America, is the editor of National Review, host of television's "Firing Line," na­tionally syndicated in over 300 newspapers around the country. and the author ofnumerous hooks. Buck­ley's career has taken him from Yale to the United Nations into politics and journalism, where he has become something of an institution. His column will run every Thursday in The Observer. 
bringing convulsion to non-communist African states. 
The United States was enjoined by such as Senators Church, Cooper and Javits from resisting the colonization of Angola by Cuba. However. anti­totalitarian forces, notably cham­pioned by Jonas Savimbi, have ever since continued to resist the central communist tyranny. 
South Africa; which has been run­ning Namibia (South West Africa) ever since World War I, not­withstanding that the old mandate has been revoked by the United Na­tions, is unwilling to tum Namibia over to the South West African Peoples Organization (SW APO) be­cause this movement, quite simply 
put, is an arm of the Soviet Union. 
SW APO has engaged in concerted 
acts of terrorism against Namibia 
from its guerrilla bases in Angola. 
Williom F. Buckley 
On the Right 
The South Africans announced that this must end and struck the guerrilla bases in Angola; and, having struck them, pulled out. 
The United Nations, led by such exemplars of freedom and justice as the Soviet Union and China, drew up a resolution condemning South Africa and a second resolution ban­ning South Africa from participating in any of the conferences that would determine the future of Namibia. With the exception of Great Britain, which abstained, other countries took what one must these days call the "Mitterrand Line." 
The United States, through Am­bassador Kirkpatrick and Charles Lichenstein, voted No in a carefully worded statement which said a) we don't approve of violence; b) we don't approve of apartheid; hut c) this isn't a pure and simple case of South Africa attacking a peaceful Angola, but one of a series of violent actions and counteractions, precipitated by Angola, not South Africa; and d) the issue hefore the U.N. is the action against Angola, not the domestic 
JXllicics of South Africans, as to which the U.S. is fully on the record. And finally, c) there would not seem to he much JXlint in discussing the future of Namibia, which is governed hy South Africa, without the par­ticipation in those discussions of South Africa. 
This is a complicated world, but it 
really isn't so complicated that CBS News should leave us feeling that we would get a clearer account of what is going on by reading the comic strips than by listening to three U.S. black leaders who find nothing to criticize in the Cuban totalitarization of An­gola, and who seek to frighten us into good behavior by the awful specter of a black African boycott of American industry.

As far as the NCAA soccer world is concerned. the game couldn't have been less important. But for the Notre Dame soccer team. an entire season mar be built around the lessons ofone meaningless exhibition gamt· last sprin~ in Fort Wayne. lnd 
The contest featured a young, revamped Irish lineup against the defending national runner-ups from Indiana University. For the pao;t three years, Head Coach Rich Hunter and his Notre Dame pro~am have bet;n markmg their progress as a team by the results of their annual autumn matchupt~ against two or three of tht· Top 10 teams in the nation (i.e. Indiana, St. Louis, Penn State). Last April. however, Hunter decided to stick In­diana onto the end of Notre Dame's mne-game spring schedule to get a preview of what his squad will be up against this fall. 
For the first time in his coaching tenure, Hunter found out his band ofnon-scholarship ballplayers could throw one hell ofa scare into a premier national power like Indiana. Eighty minutes went by that April after­noon with Notre Dame and Indiana even at I· I on the scoreboard, until the Hoosiers finally broke free for two goals in the last ten minutes and a ~-1 victory. 
Five months later, Rich Hunter and his band of no­names sit patiently, awaiting the arrival ofSt. Louis Uni­versity -the fifth-ranked team in the nation, a school with all kinds ofscholarships, and the closest thin~ to a UCLA basketball-like legend offered by Division I soc­cer-for a showdown Sunday ( 3 p.m.) on Alumni Field.

"I think ahout that Indiana game a lot. I knou• we ....... can play with those guys." Co-captain Sami Kahalc. playing the best ball of his career this fall. expects the Irish to show the Billikens a whole nt·w dimension in :'>lotrc r>ame soe<·er. 
"We'rt· gomg to take ~ontrol of the tempo right away by controlling the ball and pas!>ing it slowly -not just trymg to get rid of it," says tht· senior striker who rates a<; Notre Dame's fourth all-time leading scort·r. "If we keep our cool and aren't intimidated and just play under control. we can stay with them.

"We're having a little trouble getting 
organized. However, I feel that once 
the season gets underway, we'll be 
all right." 
Scheduled to start at the outside 
haltback positions are sophomore 
Joe Holterman and junior Brad 
McCurrie. Holterman proved he can 
do the job when he assumed the 
starting role last year. Other ful­
lbacks who may see action this fall 
are Kevin Coughlan, Roer Brown 
and Phil Sweester. 
An added dimension this fall will 
be a fourth fullback, commonlv 
called a sweeper or "last man." Thi,s 
spot will be filled by sophomore Ted 
Schwartz. He will be playing behind 
Stein and will play a crucial role in · the team's fortunes. 
Probably the most important posi­
tion on a soccer team is the 
goalkeeper. The Irish are not lacking 
in this aspect ofdefense. SeniorJohn Milligan will get the starting nod. "John is everything anyone could ask in a goalkeeper," asserts Hunter. "He's tough, quick, and has im­proved in his ability to control the 
goal area." Backing up Milligan will be junior Gerard McCarthy. He has also shown that he can do the job, having compiled an impressive 1.03 goals against average in 1 7 games in 1980. 
It all adds up to what should be an interesting campaign for Hunter and his squad. This may he the heginmng of a new era for the soccer team As Hunter puts it, "beating a team like St. Louis or Indiana would be similar to Notre Dame's football team win­ning its first big game. I feel we have the capabilities to pull offan upset of that magnitude, and I think the players deserve it. The attitude is 
I00 percent better this year as opposed to last year, and I think that may carry the team over an Indiana or St. Louis." 

Lacrosse tryouts end; team looks to season 
By PETER BOGAARD 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team ended its tryouts yesteday, with prospects looking better then ever for a successful season. Coach Rich O'Leary has done a fine job stimulat­ing interest in the program, which saw 19 freshmen attend the tryouts held Monday through Wednesday. 
Playing in the Varsity Division of the Midwest Lacrosse Association, the stickmen ended last year with an impressive first-year record of 6-6. 
With 13 returning lettermen and an outstanding crop of freshmen, the team looks to win their division, dethroning last year's champs, Ohio State. 
The squad is led by senior co­captains Dave Lewis and \tike Lynch. Both hail from Delbarton High School in Morristown, New 
jersey, as do four other members of the team. The freshmen are ex­pected to give a big lift on the attack and in the midfield. Coach O'Leary stated, "We are relying on the fresh­men for some solid production.

McEnroe, Austin advance in Open 
By BOB GREENE 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Defending cham­pion John McEnroe shook off a first­set loss and rallied to beat Ramesh Krishnan of India, 6-7, 7-6, 6-4, 6-2, yesterday, advancing into the semi­finals of the U.S. Open Tennis Cham­pionships. 
Moving into the women's semifinals were third-seeded Tracy Austin, No.4 Martina Navratilova and No.ll Barbara Potter. Austin trounced No.6 Sylvia Hanika ofWest 
.... Germany, 6-4, 6-3; Navratilova stopped Anne Smith 7-5, 6-4, and Potter eliminated amateur Barbara Gerken 7-5, 7-5. In a men's fourth-round match 
which was postponed Tuesday night by rain, No.8 Eliot Teltscher out­lasted No.l4 Brian Gottfried, 6-4, 6­0,5-7, 1-6,6-3. 
Krishnan, son of a former Indian Davis Cup star and the 1979 Wimbledon junior champion, took the first set from the top-seeded McEnroe, winning a tiebreaker 12­
10. The smooth-stroking Krishnan kept McEnroe at bay with perfectly placed ground strokes and a delicate touch at the net. 
The two traded service breaks in the ninth and 1Oth games of the second set before McEnroe squeezed out a 7-4 tiebreaker, :win­ning the final two points on Krish-

Sailors relax, enjoy life 
A certain AMF-Voit commercial emphasizes a point on the definition and art of relaxation. 
While one may think that he is relaxing with a good brisk sit within the confines offour walls with the boob­tube blaring away, he doesn't realize that true relaxa· tion could stem from participation in recreational activities. 
Senior Jerry Daus, president of the Notre Dame 
Sailing Club, along with at least 120 other members of 
the club realize the distinction quite well. 
"There is an idea ofbeing when you go out sailing on a quiet, peaceful afternoon with the sun shining down on you and the wind blowing behind you," explains Daus. "It's really relaxing and it can relieve so many of the tensions that you can build up so easily. "It sure is better than just sitting around in a room for an hour." 
While Daus' praises ofthe sport make him sound like a co-producerofa Christopher Cross album, his feelings obviously are shared widely around the campus as stu­dent participation in sailing makes it one of the most popular activities on campus. 
Basically, the popularity is derived for two reasons ­the first often being overlooked. 
"There is absolutely no experience necessary for joining the club," points out Daus. "We had about 30 people alone on Activities Night who thought you had to have at least some background on sailing. We have a fine novice program which will provide the ex­perience." 
A second reason for it's popularity is because the 
program is one of the more laid-back operations at the 
University. 
"There is no committment that a person has to make 
once he joins the club," says Daus. "It's what the person 
wants to get out of the club that matters. We're mostly out to rela:"< and have soine fun at St. Joseph Lake. On Wednesdays and Thursdays we'll run some races, but it's not a requirement to take part in them. 
The races usually take 15 minutes, and are run aU-day on Saturdays and half-days on Sunday -obviously for­the"gung-ho's" ofsailing as Daus says. 
"We have about 10 orIS people wh9 really compete 
hard," he concludes, "but this is something that most 
anyone can definetly enjoy on their own free time." 
And that's what relaxation is all about. 
"The only thing you have to do to join the club is to

pay a 52 5 fee. The great part though is that for the rest of the year you can check out a sail-boat at our lake with­out charge since you're a member. In contrast, someone else may have to pay S30 for just an hour to go sailing." 
One should not get the impression, however, that competition is minimal. 
With a past that produced some all-Americans and 
Top 10 national-rankings, a tradit.ion has been .built 
where the Irish have been regarded as one ofthe better 
teams from the Midwest region -a trait that often leads 
to demanding schedules. 
Last weekend's showing at Yale for instance resulted 
in a disappointing 14th place finish out of the 18 teams 
that competed. 

"The result really wasn't that disappointing since we competed against some of the top schools in the nation that had lots· of .all-Americans," maintains Daus. "We have some regattas coming up now (every weekend for the rest ofthe semester) in which we're pretty optomis­tic about doing quite well." 
Among them is the one which the dub will host Sep­tember 19-20 at Eagle Lake in Michigan, one of the largest regattas in the Midwest. 
The regattas themselves consist ofonly four or six of the members from the team competing in the two divi­sions of the race. A skipper and the crew make up the people who race the boat, with the c:rew usually being a female. 
Notre Dame's A-Division representative consists of the fine senior duo ofSkipper (and race crew captain) Phil Reynolds and crew Carol Silva, while the B­Division alternates sophomores ).II. Kuppe and Chris Hussey along with Daus. Other top performers include senior SkipperJay Kiley, and two outstanding freshman, Bob Hannon and Tom Fink, who have competed in Na­tional Amateur Sailing Regattas.
