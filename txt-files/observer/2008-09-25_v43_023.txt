Forum urges decisive action on sustainability 
Panelists discuss 
U.S. energy situation 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
The United States has the responsibility to do something to make its energy situation more sustainable, panelists at the Notre Dame Forum on Sustainable Energy said Wednesday. 
"We're stuck right now and we're really not doing anything," General Electric chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt said. "And as everybody in this room knows, to do something you have to do something." 
The discussion of what exactly must be done to improve America's energy situation ranged from individuals taking small per­sonal steps to ge~vernment<; work­ing to develop an energy policy. Each panelist echoed lmmelt's theme that action is a necessity.

Editor's Note: This is the second installment of a multi­part series examining sus­tainability at Notre Dame. 
University President Fr. John Jenkins has declared sustainability a major goal for the University, but at this point, energy generation and consumption on campus "is not a strong point," Office of Sustainability Director Jim Mazurek said. 
The Sustainability office recently calculated the University's carbon footprint, Mazurek said. 
The footprint that results from energy generation emis­sions at the University power plant is currently 172,647

SMC starts Weight Watchers program 
By KELLY DAVIS . News Writer 
"Stop dieting. Start living," is 
the Weight Watchers slogan, 
according to the weight loss 
plan's Web site. Saint Mary's 
senior Kelly Gasior, who start­
ed a Weight Watchers group 
on the College's campus this 
year, said 22 Saint Mary's stu­
dents, staff and professors 
hope to do just that. 
Gasior worked with Saint 
Mary's Director of Women's 
Health Catherine DeCleene to 
start an "At Work" program. 

The program lasts for 17 weeks, with breaks for aca­demic year recesses, so they will meet until the end of February, Gasior said. 
DeCleene told The Observer that other students had con­tacted her over the summer about starting the program on campus. She said Weight Watchers "is a tried and true program which has proven itself in the long run."

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 

Saint Mary's explores gender violence issue 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's College will examine the issue of gender violence through a symposium next Wednesday and Thursday, Women's Issues commissioner Becky Faunce said Wednesday at the Board of Governance (BOG) meeting. 
Several organizations and departments on campus will come together to present a movie Wednesday at 5 p.m. on gender violence in the Vander Vennet Theatre. The following day, a panel session will be held from 5 p.m. to 7, Faunce said. 
Professor Luzrnila Carnacho­Platero, an assistant professor of Spani'ih at Saint Mary's, organized the speakers for the panel, which includes two Saint Mary's profes­sors, a professor from Ohio State University and a speaker from the YWCA. 
"They will be talking about all diflerent forms of violence against women," Faunce said. 
Saint Mary's is continuing its Theology on Fire lecture series from last year, Missions commis­sioner Sarah King said. 
The lecture, "What Does it Mean to 'Vote Catholic?'" will take place next Wednesday at 8 p.m. in the Student Center Lounge. Political science professor Amy Cavender will speak. 
"Please come show your support, especially considering the school's value of justice this year," King said. Saint Mary's wants its stu­dents to be informed by the time the Election Day arrives in November, King said. Saint Mary's Campus Ministry is sponsoring the lecture series. 
Sodexho, Saint Mary's food serv­ices, is trying to bring a little piece of horne to the dining hall. Food services will be accepting students' family recipes and choosing one a month, Student Services commis­sioner Catherine Meadors said: Detailed plans for the event are preliminary, but students will receive a chefs coat from Sodexho iftheir recipe is chosen. 
Spes Unica, the new academic building on campus, will begin serving lunch from 12:30 p.m. to 2 during the week, Meadors said. It will have a make-your-own deli bar that students can charge as a meal on their plan. 
There will be a Salsa Night next Thursday from 8 p.m. to midnight in the Student Center Lounge, Student Diversity Board president Adriana Rodriguez said. For the first hour there will someone there to help teach people how to salsa correctly. 
Hall Council elections will be held today until 11:59 p.m., Resident Hall Association president Maura Clougherty said. Students can go on PRISM to vote for each resi­dence hall council. 



Philosophy prof talks love 
O'Connor dissects human love in 'Ancient Wisdom, Modern Love' 
Associated Press 
The English novelist and theologian Charles Williams offered what he called a "maxim" for any love affair: "Play and pray; but on the whole do not pray when you are playing and do not play when you are praying. We cannot yet manage such sirn ultaneities." 
It's difficult not to share this exasperation when trying to think seriously and carefully about something as disorderly and turbulent as whatever it is that goes on between lovers. 
So David O'Connor, associate professor of philosophy at Notre Dame, certainly has his work cut out for him. Three afternoons a week, in a fluo­rescent-lit Nieuwland Hall classroom, he stands before some 200 students enrolled in Philosophy 20214-01, leads a prayer invoking the enlighten­ment of the Holy Spirit, and begins to speak about passion­ate romance, erotic love, and simple friendship. 
O'Connor has been teaching the increasingly popular course, "Ancient Wisdom and Modern Love," for a dozen years now. Because his con­sideration of human love attempts to meld philosophical analysis and literary imagina­tion, his lectures require no less preparation from his stu­dents than from himself. The course reading list, for instance, includes Shelley's translation of Plato's "Symposium" (which O'Connor has edited); Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello"; the papal encyclical "Humanae Vitae"; selections from Horner, Sappho and William Butler Yeats; and short stories by Andre Dubus. A half-dozen films are assigned as well. 
During the fall of 2006 "Ancient Wisdom and Modern Love" was videotaped for inclusion in the online Open Courseware Initiative, in which Notre Dame is a part­ner, and now it has begun to attract attention far beyond the Notre Dame campus. In, of all places, the September edition of "0: The Oprah Magazine," O'Connor received notice a movie star might envy for the novelty and depth of his lectures. "David O'Connor rethinks common assumptions about love, sex, and mar­riage," the Oprah reviewer wrote, "and convinces his stu­dents that philosophy can make us better, more discern­ing lovers-that we can fall madl.r in love without going mad. 
In an introductory lecture sandwiched between a view­ing of Atom Egoyan's film "Exotica" and an embarkation into Plato's "Symposium," O'Connor reads from Homer's hymn to the god Dionysus and Sappho's hymn to Aphrodite to provide a sample of the atmosphere of that ancient drinking party. 
"You'll need to appreciate this atmosphere, because Plato .doesn't shout," he warns his students. "Read the 'Symposium' as if your life depended upon it...which it might. Read Plato as you would read a love letter, as you would listen to the voice of a lover, listening even more for what's not there than for what is there." 
A concurrent associate pro­fessor of classics, O'Connor is at pains to share the nuances often lost in translation of poetry and song from ancient Greek to modern English. 
"It can be frustrating," he says. "You lose so much in the explanation, much as when you have to explain a joke. Once you explain it, it isn't funny anymore." 
That frustration moves him to blurt a daunting recom­mendation: "I really wish you'd all just learn Greek," he tells his startled undergradu­ate listeners. "You'd all be much happier people, and it doesn't cost any more to learn Greek than not to learn it." 
Whether or not O'Connor is able to persuade his students to imitate his own mastery of a difficult ancient language, he is undoubtedly exhorting them to an equally challeng­ing ambition.

"Keep your stuff in your car out of sight," llechlinski said. "Put your self in the shoes of the bad guy. Walk around the car, look in the windows and see if there is anything that would entice you to break in." 
llechlinski said that he has seen cases where people broke into cars for items such as cell phone chargers, half-empty packs of ciga­rettes and spare change in cup holders and bags. 
Both llechlinski and Shibata advised students to keep track of the model and brand number listed on their property. 
Hechlinski advised students not to leave boxes for new TVs, stereo equipment, com­puters or other expensive items in front of their garbage cans outside. These boxes should be broken down and put into garbage cans or bags.

Mace someone else," Shibata said. 
Hechlinski said this hap­pens because wind carries the Mace, and a lot of times it comes back to the person using the Mace for defense. 
Hechlinski said that stu­dents should not give money to people who come to their doors. 
"If you give them money, they're going to come back and tell their buddies about it," he said. Instead, Hechlinski said that students can call SBPD to help with people who come to their doors. 
If students have parties, it is safe to always know the people in attendance. 
"If you're having a party at your house, make sure you know everybody who is there," Shibata said. "Some people come with the sole purpose of blending in and looking at what you have." 
In order to reduce the risk of crimes against property while students are away on breaks, students can call and tell SBPD that they will be gone and SBPD can check on the residence, Shibata said. She also said that NDSP can

their alarm systems and be sure to always keep doors locked, even if people are home inside the house, llechlinski said. 
Shibata suggested that stu­dents find a creative way to make sure residents never leave doors unlocked. 
"Maybe whoever leaves the door unlocked has to buy pizza," Shibata said. 
Shibata advised students who bike to and from campus to never stop for anyone. 
"If somebody asks for help, ride on by and call us," she said. "People will use that as a ploy to take advantage of you." 
Having a dog is another effective crime prevention tool, Shibata said. 
Students should get to know their neighbors, when it is safe to do so, if possible. 
"Once you have relation­ships with neighbors, they are more likely to call if they see something when you're gone," Shibata said. 
When walking off-campus, it is important to stay alert. 
"Make eye contact with people. Let them know you see them," Shibata said. 
NDSP's Hape Aggression Defense classes offer "practi­cal" and "easy" methods of defense against an attacker, Shibata said. 
Shibata eneouraged stu­dents to use the buddy sys­tem and to always make sure somebody knows where they are and when they are expected to return home. 
"Look out for each other. Look out for your friends, your neighbors," Shibata said. 

If students choose to carry Mace, Shibata said, they should be aware of how to operate it. 
"Hemember that you will Mace yourself whenever you offer tips for 
preventing 
incidents. 
"We're never blaming the victim ... as we talk about things you can do. You never deserve to be victimized," Shibata said. 
llechlinski listed crime sta­tistics from South Bend dur­ing the meeting. 
"Crimes against persons are down. Crimes against property are up," said Ilechlinski, citing erime sta­tistics comparing the same fall time frame in 2007 and 2008. 
If students have ongoing problems in their neighbor­hoods, Hechlinski said to contact the SBPD shift com­mander who works during the time that incidents typi­cally occur. 
Hechlinski emphasized the importance of students reporting crimes in order to keep SBDP informed about problems in the community. lie said that if an incident is not reported, than police do not know about the problem. 
"A lot of people, things happen to them, they don't report it," he said. "If you're not reporting it, we don't know what is going on." 

Both Shibata and llechlinski encouraged stu­dents to program the SBPD's number into their cell phones in order to directly reach SBPD in the case of emergen­cies or to report suspicious behavior. The number is 574­235-9361. 
Shibata invited students to contact NDSP with any ideas or to discuss any topics that interest or concern students. 
"Let us know, we want to work with you. We want to help you. That's why we're here," Shibata said.

Ten killed in Fmnish school shooting 
KAUHAJOKI, Finland -Police released details Wednesday about the victims of a school massacre in western Finland, saying eight women and two men were killed by the 22-year­old gunman. 
They also confirmed the shooter was Matti Saari, a student at the school who was ques­tioned by police a day before Tuesday's rampage about YouTube clips showing him firing a hand­gun. Saari was released Monday because police said they found no reason to keep him in cus­tody. 
The National Bureau of Investigation said all the women were students, while one of the men was a teacher and the other a student. The bureau said Saari also wounded an additional female student before shooting himself in the head. 
Georgian schools cancel classes 
TBILISI, Georgia -Before Georgia's war with Russia, the parents of Salome Lomadze, a lively 3-year-old with curly dark hair, were planning to walk her up the street to school every morning, starting this month. 
But Salome is one of 50,000 Georgian children, government officials say, who won't be attending classes this fall because their schools -mostly kindergartens ­now shelter tens of thousands of people who !led the fighting. 
Abroad, Russia's crushing defeat of Georgia's military in August severely dam­aged relations between Moscow and the West. In Georgia, a struggling Caucasus Mountains nation of 4.4 million, it has cre­ated a slow-motion humanitarian crisis, with repercussions far beyond the former battlegrounds.

Obama wants to keep plmmed debate 
NEW YORK -The economic crisis and raw politics threatened to derail the first presidential debate as John McCain challenged Barack Obama to delay the Friday forum and join forces to help Washington fix the financial mess. Obama rebuffed his GOP rival, saying the next president needs to "deal with more than one thing at once." 
The White House rivals maneuvered to claim th,e leadership role in resolving the economic turmoil that has overshadowed their campaign six weeks before Election Day. Obama said he would proceed with his debate preparations while consulting with bailout negotiators and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. McCain said he would stop all advertising, fundraising and other campaign events to return to Washington and work for a bipartisan solution. 

Stroke sufferers benefit from medicine 
LOS ANGELES -Stroke sufferers can still benefit from clot-busting medicine even if they receive it an hour or so beyond the current three-hour window after symp­toms start, an important new study sug­gests. 
The finding could potentially extend treatment to thousands more people each year and prevent many from being left dis­abled. However, it does not change long­standing advice that stroke victims seek immediate help if they feel sudden numb­ness or weakness in the face, arm or leg.

Sex offenders cannot enter town parks 
INDIANAPOUS -A convicted sex offender has lost again in his bid to overturn a town ordinance that bans him from Plainfield's parks. 
The Indiana Court of Appeals on Wednesday upheld the 2002 ordinance banning people on the state's sex and violent offender registry from the town's parks. The American Ovil Liberties Union of Indiana filed a lawsuit in 2005 challenging the ordi­nance on behalf of a man known in court docu­ments as John Doe. The ACLU argued Doe has com­pleted his punishment including probation and that banning him from the park effectively adds more punishment and violates the state constitution. 


Bush: Fast action to save markets 
President invites McCain, Obama, congressional leaders to White House meeting 
Associated Press  
WASHINGTON -President

Americans and lawmakers

fmancial rescue plan that fail­ 
ing to act fast risks wiping out  
retirement savings, rising fore­

His dire warning came not

extraordinary invitations to  
presidential candidates Barack  
Obama and John McCain, one  
of whom will inherit the mess in  
four months, as well as key  
congressional leaders to a  
White House meeting on  
Thursday to work on a compro­

"Without immediate action by  
Congress, American could slip  
into a financial panic and a dis­ 
tressing scenario would  
unfold," Bush said in a 12­ 
minute prime-time address  
from the White House East  
Room that he hoped would help  
rescue his tough-sell bailout  
package.  
Bush explicitly endorsed sev­

been demanded in recent days

metric tons of carbon dioxide 
equivalent. 
The University's construe­
lion projects have increased 
energy consumption, 
Mazurek said, but Notre 
Dame typically uses more 
energy than what's consid­
ered average. 
"We are generally eonsid­
ered to be higher users of 
energy per square foot than 
our peers," he said. 
Direetor of' Utilities Paul 
Kempf agreed. 
"Based on previous bench­
marking efforts of peer insti­
tutions, we have found that 
our energy usage is slightly 
above ..avera~e for our peer 
group, he said. 
For example, the University 
consumes nearly 153,000­
megawatt hours in one year, 
enough electricity to power 
15,000 residnntial homes, 
according to data from the 
Utilities Department. 
The University has been 
collecting data from all areas 
on campus. For example, 
Notre Dame consumed nearly 
900 million gallons of water 
in the most reeent 11seal yflar, 
according to the same data. 
Facilities Opflrations data 
shows that <JVflr thfl past six 
months the University eom­
munity threw away nearly 
2,200 tons of non-reeyclable 
waste, which primarily went 
to land1111s. 
Faeilities Opflrations reports using 89.1 million feet of toilet paper per year, OlT reports that there are 25,702 technological devices (ranging from computers to handheld devicfls) eonneeted to the Notre Dame network, and Food Services reports handling 287.5 tons of food waste from meal trays in one year. 
Notre Dame's Office of Sustainability is using these numbers to focus its efforts. 
Mazurek said his office has idt~ntified seven "core areas" to work on sustainability issuos: energy, waste redue­tion, design and construction, procurement, transportation, food services and water. 
The Off'iee of Sustainability will continue to compile base­line data like the carbon foot­print that will help to quanti­fy the University's onviron­mnntal impact. That data will help give a better sense of "whore the University stands," Mazunlk said. 
Energy generation and use 
While highor than usual nnergy consumption is cause for eonenrn, Kempf said Notre Dame's methods of on­earn pus nnergy gennration arn relalivPiy efficient and environnwntally friendly. 
In rise a I ynar 2007-08, the University power plant gener­ated approximately 52 per­ennt of thn ehlctrieity used on campus using a process called eo-generation, Kempf said. 
"This proeess begins with lhn pmd uelion of steam that is thnn used to drive ... g<m­nrators to produce electriei­ty," hn said. The exhaust slnam is used to heat campus in winter or produce chilled water in summer. Coal, oil and natural gas fuel the gen­eration proenss. 
This proeess has a cycle nf'l'i eie n ey of nearly 60 per­cent, Kempf said, whnrnas typical generation mnthods havn cycle efTiciencies of appmximatnly 30 percent. 

The Observer + CAMPUS NEWS Thursday, September 25, 2008 
"This increased effieieney 
not only is of eeonomic bene­
Ill, but also provides an envi­
ronmental benefit as it 
requires less fuel" which 
leads to decreased emissions, 
he said. 

The remaining portion of 
electricity used on eampus is 
purehased from the loeal 
electric company, Kempf said. 
Water usage 
Of the 900 million gallons of 
water Notre Dame used in the 
most recent fiseal year, near­
ly 400 million gallons end up 
as sewage, Kempf said. The 
rest, he said, goes primarily 
to sprinkler heads on quads 
aeross campus. 
"In general, the balance, or 500 million gallons of water, Iis I principally attributable to irrigation," Kempf said. Irrigation systems eonsume the largest portion of total water eonsumption, and this portion continues to grow as irrigation "has inereased as the developed areas of eam­pus have also grown." 
"We would estimate that ... irrigation consumption is roughly two million gallons per day, during the half year irrigation oeeurs," Kempf said. 
While irrigation has increased over time, water consumption that ends in sewage has remained rela­tively stable, with only slight decreases. 
"Water eonservation teeh­niques for toilets, sinks and showers have provided some improvement," Kempf said. 
Waste and recycling 
Between January and June, the University disposed of nearly 3,000 tons of waste, according to Faeilities Operations data. That's near­ly 16 tons of waste per day, of which an average of about 75 percent, or almost 12 tons per day, goes to landfills. 
But nearly 25 pereent of that waste was reeyeled, and Pat O'llara, Facilities Operations Central Heceiving manager, said that percent­age will probably increase in the coming months. 
"We pick up reeyeling throughout campus on a daily basis, and it's just grown by leaps and bound's since stu­dents have returned I this semester!," O'Hara said. 
Just this week, O'Hara said, a seeond eompacter that was previously used for non-recy­dable waste was converted to handle reeyclables. He said he expeets other compacters to follow suit as reeycling continues to grow. 
Starting with a student-led initiative in the 1990s, recy­cling proeesses on eampus now use single-stream recy­eling, meaning that reey­dables need not be separat­ed. 
O'Hara said the University made the switch to single­stream after Waste Management,, the contractor that handles waste disposal, was able to accommodate the 
single stream process. 
After personally visiting the reeyeling eenter outside Chicago, O'Hara said he was impressed with the machines used to separate reeyelables. He said this assured him that reeycled goods were properly sorted and recyeled and the majority of waste should and could be reeyded. 
"The bottom line is, if you're in doubt, recycle it," O'Hara said. 
Assessing the total impact, setting strategic targets 
In addition to the data col­leeted on waste, water and energy, the Offiee of Sustainability is gathering 

and processing data from the other core areas of procure­ment, design and construe­tion, transportation, and food services. 
After compiling a erodible set of baseline data, Mazurek said, the Ol'fice of Sustainability will develop a set of quantifiable perform­anee targets to work towards. 
Mazurek said he is commit­ted to "getting people on board" with the sustainability goals he sets. He said there's no turning baek now. 
"Not being sustainabln is not an option," Mazurek said.

The Giving Voice to Values (GVV) course allows students the opportunity to develop a "toolkit" of specific steps toward ethical decision making and personal response to ethical challenges. Building on the BAET 20300 course, the GW elective explores the "post decision-making" stage. Thus, after one determines the right course of action, how does he/she act on it within a given context? The course will explore case studies and "scripts"-through individual and role-playing exercises, students will practice ethical decision making. Students will design their own scenarios and plans to teach ethical action. The course also includes the study of individuals who've contributed to society-what were their specific choices and actions? What were their paths to leadership? Includes a focus on relevant applications-entry level positions after graduation, job and other experiences students have already encountered or will soon encounter, and other practical contexts. Cases developed by the students may be included in a "Notre Dame Collection" of published Giving Voice to Values cases, part of an initiative of several top business schools incorporating this cutting-edge curriculum. Adapted in consultation with Mary Gentile (The Aspen Institute; formerly of Harvard Business School). 
BAET 30500: Globalization & Corporate Responsibilities of Large & Small Companies (Georges Enderle)­
Exciting new course with real-world application -Course dates: 11/7-1'1/11 This elective course builds on the course "Introduction to Business Ethics" and focuses on the ethical responsibilities of large and small companies in the global context. Because globalization is mainly driven by powerful multinational corporations, we conduct several case studies of MNCs and investigate their roles and 
responsibilities. We also pay attention to the challenges posed by globalization to small enterprises (for instance, Grameen Bank) that make up the vast majority of companies and ask about their responsibilities. For a deeper understanding of corporate responsibility, we develop a consistent framework that ranges from the high level of 
principles down to the operational level. Specifically, we discuss the United Nations Global Compact with its ten principles and the Global Reporting Initiative with its metric of economic, social, and environmental performances. 
Finally, we explore ethical responsibility from an investor's perspective with the help of the UNEP Principles for 
Responsible Investment that consider environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues. The course will use chapter 10 and 12 of the DesJardins's book "An Introduction to Business Ethics" (third edition, 2008) and a course packet posted on the I drive.

IN BRIEF 

Spending bill includes budget, aid 
WASHINGTON -The House passed a $630 billion-plus spending bill Wednesday that wraps together a record Pentagon budget with aid for automakers and natu­ral disaster victims, and increased health care funding for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
The year-end budget measure also would lift a quarter-century ban on oil drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The legislation, which senators are expected to approve and send to President Bush for his signature, is flying under the political radar compared with the White House's contentious plan to bail out Wall Street. 
The spending bill, which passed 370-58, is fueled by a need to keep the govern­ment running past the Oct. 1 start of the new budget year. Passage also was greased by 2,322 pet projects totaling $6.6 billion. 
House vote increases AMf exemption 
WASHINGTON -The House took steps Wednesday to rein in the alternative mini­mum tax, carrying out what has become an annual ritual to protect millions of people from getting squeezed by the unwanted tax.The House voted 393-30 to increase the AMT exemption in 2008, saving more than 20 million taxpayers from getting hit with a tax increase averaging about $2,000. 
The House separately approved, 419-4, some $8 billion worth of tax relief for disas­ter victims. 
The votes came a day after the Senate similarly adjusted the AMT as part of a major tax package that included disaster relief, extension of business and individual tax breaks that have expired or will soon expire, and tax incentives for renewable energy investment. 
The House is preparing a third bill to address the energy and tax break extension issues. Both the disaster and energy bills differ from the Senate measure, and it will be a challenge for lawmakers to come up with a compromise in the last few days of this session of Congress. 


Goldman starts capital-raising program 
Plan includes investment from Warren Buffett, common stock offering 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Goldman 
Sachs Group Inc., seeking to 
improve not only its balance 
sheet but its standing with 
investors, has undertaken a 
huge capital-raising program 
that includes an investment 
of at least $5 billion from 
Warren Buffett and a com­
mon stock offering for anoth­
er $5 billion. 
Just a week earlier, 
Goldman looked to be on 
precarious ground as its 
stock price plunged in 
response to fears that it 
could not survive as an inde­

But the company contended 
Wednesday that the current 
crisis in the financial mar­
kets, which sent Lehman 
Brothers Holdings Inc. into 
bankruptcy court and Merrill 
Lynch & Co. into a sale to 
Bank of America Corp., was­
n't the catalyst for the deals. 
"Although we felt we were 
under no pressure to raise 
capital, we've always said if 
an opportunity arose, we 
would look at it," Goldman 
spokesman Lucas van Praag 
said. Raising capital "gives 
us greater firepower and 
greater flexibility," he said. 
Goldman said Wednesday 
it was raising $5 billion 
through a common stock 
offering, doubling the 
amount it announced just the 
night before. Goldman priced

Once former convicts become grnen collar workers, Carter said thfly "become alive to the world again." 
"They know that they have trav­eled from societal burden to envi­ronmental heroes," she said. 
In her opening remarks, Carter c:onnocted the mission of environ­mental justice to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. What Martin Luthnr King, Jr. "saw lin his dream! wa.<; a !uturn that was grnen for us all, my friends," Carter said. 
Much like the dvil righl<> move­ment of tim 1960s, the nnw move­mc~nt for sustainable nnergy is about challenging America, she said. and challenging America takes efli1c:tive leadership. 
"I think you need l11adership to enundate a national mwq.,ry poli­c:y,'' Hitter said.

It's time li>r Ameriea to step up

"Aren't we tirc~d of building trib­
utes to all of our collective failurns 
and don't we want to build monu­
ments to hope and possibility'!" 
she asked. 
The current absence of an ener­
h'Y policy is an American failure, 
lmmnlt said, and this failure has 
consequences. 
"The worst of all is wn have no 
1merhry policy, no call to arms and 
that people are afraid," he said. 
"People have a lot to be afraid 
about." 
What thn country nneds is lor a 
leader to step up and provide an 
enerhry policy, lmmelt said. "Hight 
now we havn a vacuum and that 
makes people afraid," he said. 
But the energy policy that 
lmmelt suggested would not limit 
development to certain technolo­
gies. 
"Let freedom reign,'' he said. "I 
wouldn't specify. Then the cntre­
pnmeurial capital will do things 
we've never seen before." 
Americans can solve this prob­
lem, Cartnr said. 
"It's not like this is the first time 
America has gone through a cri­
sis, guys," she said. referencing 
World War II. "We nend to call on 
the great resources we have, 
!including thel American people, 
and "expect them to rise to the 
challenge and the occa.<;ion." 
For Americans to take action, 
Ritter said we need to view energy 
use as something that has an 
impact. 
"We need to think about it in 
terms of scarcity," he said. "We 
need to make a case to the people 
of this country that we have some­
thing at stake." 
Ritter said he thinks the 
younger generations need to take 
ownership of the energy problem. 
He said one night he woke up and 
thought, "My children aren't 
thinking about climate change 
right now, they're out clubbing." 
"This is your problem and it's my problem," he said. "You need to understand you're part uf the solution too." 
The enerhry problem is some­thing that transcends individuals' backgrounds. While Cartnr spoke about the issue very emotionally, lmmelt said that the closest he ever came to spending time out­doors was on the golf course. 
Ritter was a prosecutor running for governor when he realized that "the state of Colorado wasn't doing anything we should be," he said. 
"We stood by and watched." 
lie decided to make energy reform a central component of his campaign, and has found that "people were yearning for this to happen," he told The Observer after the forum. 
No matter what perspective the panelists brought to the energy issue, however, they agreed that the issue should be a pP.rsonal one for students. 
"It's your world,'' Moniz said. 
lmmelt said students can bring any perspective to the energy issue and be able to sec that their action is necessary. 
"Think about this in terms of what's in your heart and what's in your hnad," he said. "If you study what's going on, you'll come to a conclusion that this is what's important." 
Notre Dame's Energy Use 
Forum moderator Anne Thompson, the chief environmen­tal all'airs correspondent f(>r NBC News (NBC News is a division of NBC Universal, which is a sub­sidiary of lmmelt's General Elnctriel announced at thn conclu­ty two years ago, received a B-in the sanw study rnleasnd today. The University's students received an A for their involvement in the issue. 
"It's a great acknowledgement of what we've done," Long said about the grade aftf1r the forum. "But we're doing a helluva lot more than that. We don't think we need to use report cards to evaluate our programs." 
Executive Vice President John Nlleck-Graves said the analysis for the grade is flawed. I le said that of the nine amas graded, Notre Dame reeeived poor marks in "shareholder engagement" and "endowment transparency." lie explained he did­n't think these two areas should be included, because, "to me, that's not an environmental issue." Aflleck-Graves praised the students who have taken leadership on ener­gy issues on campus. "They should be an inspiration to everybody," he said.

Residents return to Galveston after hurricane 
Texans return to island after two weeks to find no drinking water, scarce electricity, no medical care or sewer service 
Associated Press 
CAI.VESTON -'Jim days after llurrieane Ike, this devastated beach town reope1H~d to resi­dents Wednesday with stern warnings about what still lurks on the island -rotting cattle ean:asses. snakns and swarms of mosquitoes-and what isn't tlwn~: drinking wat1~r. reliabln nlndricity, medical rare or snwnr service. 
Arter spending hours in traflk that barked up for l 0 miles, some residents found their homes in ruins. 
"I wasn't pn~parnd for this," taxi driver Patricia Davis said as she swaltnd away mosquitoes and survey1~d the rPmains of her apartment. which had its nntrancP block1~d by collapsed walls, wn~ckPd furniture and sodden clothing. 
City ollidals hoped most of the 45,000 msidents who fled before the Sept. 13 storm would stay away until morn repairs could bn made. 
"We didn't promise paradise when you came back here. We've got a lot of work to do. You've got a lot of work to do," City Manager Steve LeBlanc said Wednesday. 
The city has limited drinking watnr. f1~w working sewers, lim­ited nlectrieity and minimal medical facilities. Offieials extended the disaster declara­tion for 90 days. 
What Galveston does have is ripening in the tropical heat: Hatting food in piles of debris where houses once stood, mil­lions of mosquitoes and an abundance of snakes. The car­casses of cattle that drowned during the storm are too badly decomposed to be moved; they'll rot in the tields just outside the eity limits. 
People were warned not to rnturn without tetanus shots ­or rat bait. 
"Being here today kind of gives me some dosure," said Anita Arredondo, who found a pile of rubble where her two­story home once stood. "I have not bmm sleeping well, worried about what we could save and what we couldn't." 
Ken llolman said he wished city leaders had allowed resi­dents to return sooner because it might have allowed him to save more of his mother's belongings from the house she lived in for 56 years. The home was inundated by 4 feet of water. 
"Just the fact it took us this long to get in here, that kind of hurts," he said. 
The city has opened a shelter for 100 newly homeless resi­dents, and ollicials hoped to set up more shelters on the main­land for residents whose homes are uninhabitable, LeBlanc said. 
The city and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are considering a plan to allow residents to live in FEMA trailers in their driveways or near their houses during repairs. But LeBlanc noted he would want all trailers removed from the island before the start of the 2009 hur­ricane season. 
But progress was slow: The island's three electrical inspec­tors and two plumbing inspec­tors were ordered to inspect every flooded property before allowing residents to turn on the gas or flip an electrical switch. LeBlanc asked other cities to send more inspectors. 
"It's not a healthy and safe place to be at this time," said Mark Guidry, county health director. 
At Huby Holman's house, where water lines stained the walls four feet above the floor, daughters Sharon and Ann wore bright yellow gloves and white masks as they carried away buckets of debris, including prized books. 
The carpet inside Holman's home was so soggy, it soaked through everyone's shoes. The air inside the house was so choked with mold and mildew, a visit could only last a few min­utes at a time. 
Diane and Eddie Howard found that one of their homes, which they had bought only three weeks ago, was destroyed by a fire after the storm. 
The other home, which they are trying to sell, was flooded by 8 feet of water, ruining the first floor but sparing many of their personal belongings on the sec­ond and third floors. 
"I've been through all kinds of hurricanes," said Eddie lloward, who was born on the island 77 years ago. "This is the worst one." 
At least 62 deaths, 27 of them in Texas, were blamed on the Category 2 hurricane and its remnants. The body of a woman who apparently drowned was uncovered in a debris tield north of Galveston. 
Nearly 50 residents are still missing, LeBlanc said. 
Roughly 45,000 of the city's 57,000 residents lled Galveston Island, about 50 miles southeast of Houston, along with hundreds of thousands more from other sections of the Texas coast. 

Residents of the island's most severely damaged area, on the island's west end, were allowed to visit their homes but not per­mitted to stay. 
Gov. Hick Perry toured dam­aged areas Wednesday and announced a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development rental assistance program to help hurricane vic­tims.

Russia en1erges in nuclear programdispute 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The U.S. has found an emboldened Russia wielding enormous leverage at a critical stage in disputes over the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs, a once-prom­ising partnership with Moscow in doubt. 
After a month of bitter exchanges over Russia's war with Georgia, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice came face-to­face Wednesday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and discovered Moscow's coop­eration on Iran and North Korea may no longer be a sure thing. 
The atmosphere was awk­ward, but not chilly, for the high­est-level contact between the two nations since Russia invaded Georgia in August in a dispute over a separatist border region, according to a senior U.S. official who was present. 
"There was not shouting, table pounding or histrionics," said Daniel Fried, the top American diplomat for Europe. But neither Rice nor Lavrov were able to agree on anything beyond gen­eral statements of support for the Iran and North Korea efforts. 
"This was a polite, thorough exchange of views where the disagreements were quite clear," Fried told reporters. Rice out­lined the U.S: position on Russia's war with Georgia while Lavrov repeated Moscow's defense of its military action, he said. 
Fried said the United States was unconvinced by Lavrov's arguments and that problems Russia is facing because of its invasion of Georgia "cannot just be wished away." 
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Lavrov said it was not "rocky," adding that both sides had agreed to be pragmatic regarding issues that divided them, such as the brief conflict over Georgia in August. 
"We agreed that we must not make this situation a rock on which everything else would hit," Lavrov told an audience at the Council on Foreign relations. 
While Rice did not expect to sway Lavrov on Georgia, she was seeking Russia's support on Iran and North Korea less than a week after she raised the stakes by publicly denouncing Russia's growing authoritarianism and aggression. 
With Iran nearing the ability to 
arm a nuclear warhead and 
North Korea moving to restart a 
disabled atomic reactor. the 
United States needs Russia more 
than ever in the international 
efforts to eliminate the threats. 
But Russia on Tuesday scuttled high-level talks on imposing new sanctions on Iran that had been set for Thursday between the foreign ministers of the five per­manent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany. Even sanctions opponent China had agreed to the meeting. 
U.S. officials, including Rice, have sought to downplay the move, saying the time wasn't right for the session. But they had previously said such a gath­ering would be useful and neces­sary to get fourth U.N. Security Council sanctions resolution on Iran. 
At their meeting, Rice and Lavrov "agreed that there would come a time for another P5-plus­one foreign ministers meeting" but did not say when that might be, according to Fried who used the formal name lor tiie grouP­
ing. 

Fried acknowledged the group was still "grappling with the issue of how to proceed in the wake of recent developments" including Iran's continued defi­ance of demands to stop repro­cessing uranium and how to maintain at least the appearance of unity. 
"We did not discuss any sanc­tions," Lavrov said. 
Rice and Lavrov made similar commitments on North Korea, which earlier Wednesday expelled inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency from its main reactor and plans within a week to reac­tivate the facility.

really does make being green look so 
fresh and stylish. The crowning show, 
however, is "Alter Eco." Adrian Grenier, of Ent.ourage fame, introduces a few of his friends who arc building a fully 
green house in L.A.. They then spend 
the majority of the show helping other 
high-end designers "green up" the operation. 
To their credit, the folks on this show are green machines; they do everything possible to make everything some form of "all-natural" or "environmentally friendly." Popularizing the movement in this way, through television programs and pop culture trends, paints "green­ness" as requiring us to drop our way of life to reach eco-friendly nirvana. This is not only inefficient, and a waste of resources -but fairly disheartening to those who feel they are making an effort to do their part. 
The truth is, it is easy bein' green. While there are three primary channels through which action can be taken (personaVconsumer, government and markets), an average person really only has full control over the first: personal or consumer use. Today, however, even taking control over your personal envi­ronmental footprint can seem daunting. Thousands of new products line the 
shelves advertising how each is better 
for the environment than its competi­
tor. There are detergents that are 
chemical free, paper that is 50 percent 
recycled, and cars that advertise they 
can travel a million miles per gallon. 
Recently, Terrachoice, an environ­mentally friendly marketing firm, released a report entitled "The Six Sins of Greenwashing." In it, they concluded that 99.9 percent of consumer products bearing an environmentaVgreen mar­keting claim were false or misleading. This isn't very reassuring to those hop­ing to save the world one bottle of $8 organic/chemical-free/nontoxie/made of wholesome grain laundry detergent at a time. 
My advice: Take all of that, throw it out the window and stick to the basics. Hather, work on and fine-tune your basics. These are the practices that have been espoused by bland public service announcements since you were five years old. Unfortunately, in the flood of personal household solar pan­els and gutter rain barrels, their rela­tive importance seems to have dimin­ished. So to remind us all, here is the short list: 
1. 
Recycle your cans and paper. Currently, paper makes up a full one third of solid waste generated. Over 55 percent of paper is still dumped into landfills rather than recycled. On cam­pus, with bins in all classroom build­ings and in each dorm, there is no rea­son any paper should end up in the trash can. Additionally, only one in four aluminum cans are recycled. That is about eight cans out of a case of Natty. I know this one is harder, but do your best to save the cans and recycle them. 

2. 
Be conscious of your main energy uses. You are probably expecting me to say don't watch TV, leave the lights ofT until you can't possibly see anything outside or go back to typewriters. Actually, the best way to immediately reduce your energy uses is to simply unplug your electronic device chargers when you aren't using them. Only five percent of energy used by a cell phone charger actually charges the phone. 


The other 95 percent is wasted out into the air whHe it remains plugged in. The same goes for your laptop charger: unplug it. The easiest way to do this is to simply plug all of your chargers into one power strip and when something isn't charging, simply flip the switch. 
3. Finally, when the market works out the energy problem (which it eventually will). make the right choice. For the next couple of years, it will be more expensive to use alternative energy than conventional energy. llowevcr, drastically cheaper alternative sources are at our doorstep. A Nevada compa­ny, Ausra, expects to be able to handle base loads for up to 30 percent of the entire southwest United States within ten years at a price very dose to cur­rent kilowatt per hour rates. All you have to do, when the time comes, is choose to pay an extra pnnny or two per unit. 
That's all. Over the course of a month, this may only amount to ten bucks. More importantly, it will spur further investment and push profitabili­ty thereby adding economic incentive for big business to use and create clean energy even more. Aftor all, oil would have never spread so quiekly through­out the world had it not been for Nelson Rockefeller and Standard Oil. 
Now, let me put a personal disclaimer in for myself. In no way do I think it is wrong or unhelpful for a person to go above and beyond in following the three basic tenets. However, the cost efToctivencss and returns on one indi­vidual's environmental obsession is far less helpful than inspiring more and more people to do the basics correctly. So let's not go overboard and frighten people away from making the little changes that can have a large efTect; just keep reminding people to unplug chargers and recycle their tests.

To know you is to love you. Really! 
Do you ever havn recurring night­mares? Some situation you fear that you may not evnn think about in the midst of busy days, but that rears up again while your unsuspecting brain has let its guard 
down in your  
sleep? Even now,  Kate Barrett  
nearly 20 years  
after the last exam  
of my educational  Faithpoint  
career, periodically  
I still have ·a dream  

in which I show up for a final only to realize that I had somehow neglected to attend the class most of the semester, and am therefore spectacularly unpre­pared, guaranteed to reveal my stupidity to the professor in a most dramatic fash­ion. 
Many people, even those whom society would consider highly educated, respect­ed and successful in their fields, confess to dreams in which they are discover"ed to be a fraud, clothed in the appearance of professional capability, but under­n~ath ignorant and unworthy of the trust others have placed in them. 
This Sunday's gospel is a perfect opportunity for each of us to ask our­selves if the person we show to the world genuinely represents our true self, or if we're just "getting by" on appear­ances. Do we sign up for or join a group that we think will make us look good, but then neglect to contribute or partici­pate in a meaningful way? Do we select our classes, or study and prepare for our chosen vocation or career in such a way that we truly become qualified and com­petent, or does our vision stop at the short-term, just aiming for the best grades we can get on the next test? 

The chief priests and elders, repre­senting the well-respected, powerful religious establishment of Jesus' day, must have thought that Jesus himself was their worst nightmare, especially when he came telling parables such as the one we will hear on Sunday. He describes a man and his two sons. The father orders both sons to go out and work in the vineyard. One initially says "no," but then experiences a change of heart and goes out to work. The other says "yes," but fails to follow through on his commitment. Though the leaders can see that the father would much prefer the conversion of the first son to the empty promises of the second, they can­not (or will not) make the connection to their own willingness merely to settle for "talking the talk." Finally, as if he hadn't 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Forum_ tim_e conflicting 
I want to compliment the University for organizing an excellent forum on the issue of Energy, one of the defining issues of this gen­eration. 
I have a problem, however, with the timing of this and past fora. They should occur in the early evening and not interfere with class lectures. Students and faculty should attend this forum and in order to do so, either a faculty member must cancel their lecture or a student must skip the lecture. 
Either way, the message being sent by the Administration is that there are certain things which take precedent over lecture. This opens the door to many possibilities. 
Perhaps a student believes spending time with family members warrants leaving campus a day earlier for Fall Break. Perhaps a faculty member believes attending a seminar important to their research warrants canceling their lecture which occurs at the same time as the seminar. 
The Administration is setting a bad example to students and fac­ulty by timing these fora during lecture periods.

No need to rearrange 
Patrick McHugh's thought that the Indiana State Police (ISP) should ignore underage drinking until all the felonies are solved is just another manifestation of the old "oh, it's just alcohol" philoso­phy ("Rearrang-ing priorities," Sept. 24). 

McHugh is absolutely right that the protection of life and property should be the primary focus of the State Police, but it is disconcert­-ing that he doesn't see that this certainly includes situations like this. 
Let's remember that the ISP were called into this situation because the party was disturbing other residents of the neighborhood, so these students did it to themselves, and were not the victims of some random. act by the police. 
In addition, people who drink in off-campus situations often become people who drive after drinking. As someone who lost his mother-in-law because of a drunk driver, I applaud the ISP respond­ing to this situation in an appropriate fashion. 
Underage drinking is in fact a serious problem when statistics clearly prove that drunk driving is the leading cause of death for those under 21, and further show that those under 21 are responsi­ble for half of all drunk driving fatalities. So, just maybe, we should be thanking the ISP for doing their duty and protecting all of us (including any potential underage drinker-drivers from themselves).

irritated them enough already, Jesus gives the chief priests and scribes a dis­tasteful list of society's lowest sinners who, with a true conversion of heart, will enter the kingdom of heaven ahead of them. 
As often happens in the gospels, we can actually find more comfort and hope in Jesus' words if we can recognize our own sinfulness. We aren't necessarily supposed to put ourselves in the shoes of the chief priests and scribes or of the tax collectors and prostitutes. Surely we each have SQme characteristics of both. Our task is to listen for the ways God speaks to us -as the father spoke to the two sons in the gospel story -and. as much as we can, respond with a genuine "yes." Whenever we've just flat out said "no" to who God asks us to be; that is, whenever we've sinned, we can believe that Jesus still waits for us, ready towel­come us when we have a change of heart. 
On the other hand, we can also listen for the ways God speaks to us when we respond with an insincere "yes," as the second son does in the gospel. It is oh so easy to do-we might want to impress someone; we might want to fit in to a group; we might want to land a good grade, a better job or a more substan­tial-looking resume. The scribes and the chief priests seemingly couldn't even recognize that doing all the "right" things with empty intentions left them with hearts less open to God than even the outcasts of society who had turned away from their sins and toward God in honest recognition of their need. 
We are so blessed. We have friends to pray with; opportunities for Mass, recon­ciliation and retreats; and examples all around us on campus of fellow students, faculty and staff who have committed themselves in faith to service of others. Together we can explore how we will say "yes" to God more sincerely, and how the "no" of our own sinfulness can itself become an opportunity to return our hearts to God's love. Then the person we show to the rest of the world will become just the very person our God knows so intimately and loves so well.

Don't underestitnate Palin 
In his Tuesday column "Country Second," Brendan McPhillips writes about Sarah Palin as if she was actually just a hockey mom and not the governor of the largest state in the US. 
It's true that Palin is largely unknown outside of Alaska and there are other politicians who have more experience than her, particularly in foreign policy, and would be more qualified vice­presidents based on their political resumes. It is only reasonable to have doubts about someone who is in their forties and has held a significant political office for only two years. 
But Obama is also in his forties, has only spent four years in the U.S. Senate (two of which he spent running for president), and has no sub­stantial foreign policy record. At the Democratic National Convention, Bill Clinton supported O!Jama by noting that the Republicans said he didn't have the experience, especially in foreign policy, to be president. But I think most Democrats agree that didn't stop Clinton from having a successful eight years in office. 
So, isn't saying that McCain "shamelessly sac­rificed the best interests of the American people, putting country second, not first, by choosing Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate" just a little bit unfair? 
Also, I don't think any current undergraduate anywhere is "more qualified for the vice presi­dency then Sarah Palin." In her campaign for governor, Sarah defeated the incumbent Frank Murkowski over.whelmingly in the primary and then defeated the former two-term governor Tony Knowles in the general election. Her approval rating as governor has remained at 80 to 90 percent, the highest approval rating of any United States governor. 
Palin has surprised a lot of people with her skills and perceptiveness as a politician, particu­larly those who have underestimated her, and she will continue to do so.

A solution to the Palin problem_ 
When I read the article written by Brendan McPhillips on Sen. John McCain's selection of Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candi­date ("Country second," Sept. 23) I most certainly agreed with him. Palin, like Pedro, lacks political experience. This hurts McCain in his race against Sen. Barack Obama, who is much more qualified to run our great nation. 
He's been in the U.S. Senate for nearly four years, which is far superior to ... a little longer than ... Palin's two years as a governor. 
And he's done so much for the country too! He's ... uh ... supported the Secure Fence Act! And don't forget the revolutionary Coburn­Obama Transparency Act! 
Oh, and I almost forgot how Obama won his first political seat "in the Illinois Senate: by default. How smart of him to disqualify the other five candidates, including the heavily-favored incumbent, on fundraising technicalities. I always figured that if I ever wanted to get elected in a democratic system, I too would eliminate any and all competition as well, no matter what it took. 
No worries, children. 1 have given this some thought, and I believe I have a solution to our problem. We are going to need to take action to keep Palin from sneaking into "the second most powerful office in the country, ifnot the world," as McPhillips so eloquently puts it. Fortunately, 
i 

our solution is McPhillips himself! 
Your subtlety did not slip by me unnoticed, sir. You said so yourself in your article: "I am more qualified for the vice presidency than Sarah Palin is." So what are we waiting for? Call up McCain! Let him know we have an even better running mate for him! 
Nevermind the fact that McPhillips has never governed a state, or held any sort of national office. We already know he is confident that he can do a better job. I can think of no better per­son to be in what could be the world's second­highest spot. 
Alright, let's sum this up. Crisis: "History will write off John McCain's decision to offer the vice presidency to Sarah Palin, as the single most irresponsible decision a presidential candidate has made in the modern era." Solution: History will praise John McCain's decision to offer Brendan McPhillips the vice presidency over Palin as the single greatest turn of events ever constructed by a presidential candidate in the modern era. Crisis averted. 
Good work, boys. Let's go home.

"In my mind. thny're going to be back. I have no reason to think dil'f'nrnntly," Hyan said in a hastily gathered postgame meeting. "I don't anticipate a change."

"Hon has done a good job. I think he kept the ballclub playing for him under bad conditions in April, and I think it played hard for him all year," Hyan said. "With a young club, that's the thing that you look for, if the team quits on a manager. And this team didn't do that."

Associated Press 

EAST RUTHERFORD, 
N.J. -A yearlong ankle injury could not keep Plaxico Burress out of the New York Giants' lineup last season. The lack of a telephone call this week apparently is going to cost him a game and more than $235,000. 
Less than a month after handing the man who caught the winning pass in the Super Bowl a new $35 million contract, the Giants on Wednesday sus­pended Burress for a game for missing a prac­tice and not calling to explain his absence. 
Burress' agent insisted the nine-year veteran had an undisclosed family emergency on Monday and will appeal the ban to the NFL Players Association. 
"We have had success here because of the team concept," Giants coach Tom Coughlin said in dis­cussing the suspension, which was handed down during a bye week for the Giants (3-0). "And the team concept means basi­cally that everyone is accountable and responsi­ble and that we don't let the other guys down. And that is what we are trying to do." 
As part of the suspen­sion, Burress will not be allowed to practice until after the Oct. 5 game against the Seattle Seahawks. That means he will miss two weekly pay­checks, totaling $235,294.12 of his $2 mil­lion annual base salary. 
The Giants refused to say why Burress was sus­pended, but agent Drew Rosenhaus claimed Burress had a family emergency that has now been resolved. 
Rosenhaus said Burress spoke with Giants director of player development Charles Way on Monday evening, but he added there was "miscommuni­cation" between the player and the team. 
When asked specifically why Burress did not tele­phone the team or answer repeated telephone calls Monday to discuss the absence, Rosenhaus avoid­ed answering the question. 
Burress has had other problems with the Giants since signing as a free agent in 2005. He was benched for the opening quarter against San Diego early in 2005 for being late for a meeting. He said his wife was pregnant and he went with her for a test. 
Coughlin and general manager Jerry Reese informed Burress of the suspension Wednesday morning before the team held practice. 

IN BRIEF Sore shoulder sidelines 
Pettitte for season 
TORONTO-New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte is done for the season because of a sore left shoulder. 
"It's giving me a little trouble," Pettitte said. "I've thrown enough innings. There's not any sense in going out and continuing to kill myself now, to push myself through anything." 
Pettitte had an MRI exam on his shoulder earlier this month, revealing no major damage. He won his last start on Sunday night, beating Baltimore in the final game at Yankee Stadium. 
The 36-year-old Pettitte went 14­14 in 33 starts and threw 204 innings. His 4.54 ERA was his highest since 1999, when it was 4.70. 
New York was eliminated from postseason contention Tuesday night when Boston beat Cleveland 5-4. 
Tigers reliever Jones 
announces retirement 
DETROIT -Tigers reliever Todd Jones is retiring, he announced in his own column in the Sporting News. 
"So this is it," he wrote in the lat­est issue of the magazine. "If you're a Tigers fan, I'll never stress you out again. If you're not a Tigers fan, you'll never have me as your ace in the hole, convinced I'll blow a lead against your team." 
The 40-year-old Jones went on the disabled list in late July with an injured right shoulder. He was acti­vated for one game in mid-August, gave up five unearned runs, and went back on the DL. 
Jones was 4-1 with 18 saves in 21 chances this year and a 4.97 ERA: 
Jones has 319 career saves with Detroit, Houston, Minnesota, Colorado, Boston, Cincinnati, Philadelphia and Florida. He's 14th on the all-time list and his 235 saves for Detroit are a team record. 
Packers Harris has 
"serious" spleen injury 
GREEN BAY, Wis. -Cornerback Al Harris has a "serious" spleen injury that requires a cautious approach, but he hasn't been ruled out for the rest of the season, Packers coach Mike McCarthy said Wednesday. 
''I'm hopeful he'll be back," McCarthy said. "The time frame just hasn't been established." 
Harris was injured in the first quarter of Green Bay's loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night. The injury is believed to be a rup­tured spleen, which sidelined then­Tampa Bay quarterback Chris Simms for the rest of the season in 2006. 
Harris, one of the Packers' top defensive players, won't be able to do any significant physical activity for at least a week and will not play in Sunday's game at Tampa Bay. 
Harris left Sunday night's game in the first quarter after he collided with Packers linebacker A.J. Hawk.

NFL 

Lions fire President Millen 

Associated Press 
ALLEN PAHK. Mich. -Matt 
Millnn insisted he would stick 
with the tough job of turning the 
I>ntroit Lions into a winner 
instead of returning to the 
broadcast booth to make easy 
mmwy. 
So the Lions got rid of him. 
Finally. 
The Lions fired Millen seven­plus years after the acclaimed TV analyst and Super Howl-win­ning linebacker took over as team president for one of the NFL's mediocre franchises and made it the worst. 
"1 have relieved Matt Millen of his duties niTective immediate­ly." Lions owner William Clay Ford said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. 
Mnssages seeking comment worn lfll't on Millon's cell phone. 
Millen's tnams won a league­low 31 games since he took over in 200 I, but his boss refused to get rid of him until now. 
Bill Ford, son of the team owner, said Monday he would lim Millen if he had the authori­ty. 
Dntroit was routed in nach of its first three games this season, falling behind 21-0 twiee and 21-:{ once en route to lopsided lossns going into its bye week. 
"I am vnry disappointed with where wn are as a team after our start this season," Ford added in his statmnent. "Our soln focus now is preparing for our next gamn against Chicago." 
Thn 0-3 reeord dropped Millen to ;{ 1-H4 overall. giving the Lions at least 10 more losses than any othnr NFL tnam since 2001. one of the worst stretches in league history. They gaw1 up a lnagun-high 25.:{ points and ranked 30th with 18.3 points a ganw undnr Millnn, according to STA'I"S. 
Aft11r winning just live games in his first two seasons. Mill!m bristled wlwn a roporter told him sonw pPople were alrnady predicting he would eventually walk away to get paid stress­frne millions as a broadcaster again. 
"Those pP.ople don't know me 
that well." Millen said in a 2003 
interview with The Associated 
Press. "I can't not finish some­
thing that I started. That bugs 
me. I've got to get this finished. 
"This gray hair shows how much I care. Look at me. I look like Kris Kringle!" 
The Lions' front office will now be led by executive vice president Torn Lewand, who will report to the owner on business issues, and new general manag­er Martin Mayhew, who will report to the owner on football matters. 
"These decisions are for the duration of the 2008 season," Ford's statement said. "Once the season is over, we will undergo a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of our entire football operation and put together a plan that we believe will trans­form this tfmrn into a winner." 
William Clay Ford also has been the target of criticism because since his first full sea­son in 1964, the Lions have won only one playoff game. lie has hired and retained people to lead the franchise, such as Russ Thomas and Millen, who weren't able to build a consis­tent winner. 
In a rare interview late in the 2003 season, the owner said he hadn't considered firing Millen. 
"I want him. I don't nned any more rnason than that." he said. 
The tipping point might have been public comments made by the owner's son. Lions vice chairman Bill Ford said Millen should leave the team, and the Ford Motor Co. executive chair­man said if he had the authority, he would make moves. 
"I think the fans deserve bet­tor," BiII Ford told reporters. "And if it were in my authority, which it's not. I'd make some significant changes." 
I lis father finally agreed that Millen had to go. 
Drivers of vehicles whizzing past the Allen Park facility beeped their horns and gleefully yelled out about the end of the Millen era. 
Eddie Gates drove through the team's parking lot in his mini­van as his girlfriend, Sue Stanton, held a sign, "Millen Must Go To Get a Super Bowl," out the window. 

"I've been a season-ticket holder for 28 years and because they fired Matt Millen, I'm going to renew," said Gates. "This is the happiest day of my life." 
The Fords -father and son -were thrilled when they lured Millen out of the broadcast booth to run their hapless fran­chise. 
''I'm willing to stake my repu­tation on Matt's success," Hill Ford said after Millen was intro­duced at a news conference in January 2001. 
Millen was the team's first general manager since Thomas left in 1989. The Lions allowed their coaches -Wayne Fontes, Bobby Hoss and Gary Moeller ­to run the football operation after Thomas resigned. 
"We've been pretty much stuck on dead center for quite a few years," William Clay Ford said when Millen was hired. "Matt offers us an opportunity to move ahead." 
Coach Hod Marinelli will be left with the task of salvaging something from the final 13 games of the season. But he and the players haven't inspired much confidence with an NFC­worst 10-25 record since 2006. 
Ultimately, the Lions are left with Millen's mess that led to a pitiful era that compares only to Tampa Bay's 12 straight double­digit loss seasons from 1983-94. 
This offseason was productive and the practices were great, Millen and Marinelli insisted, but that didn't make a differ­ence on Sundays. 
The Lions are winless, and 1­10 dating to last season. The latest Joss at San Francisco dropped Marinelli to 3-15 on the road and dropped the Lions to 8-60 as visitors with Millen in charge. 
The former Penn State stand­out was an NFL linebacker from 1980-91 with the Raiders, San 
Francisco  49ers  and  
Washington Redskins. He  won  
the Super Bowl four times.  

FoxSports.corn was the first to report Millen's departurll.

things. 
"Good teams don't need omens, bad teams are looking for them," Hall of Farner Mike Schmidt said in an e-mail Wednesday. 
More on him later, by the way. 
So either the Chicago White Sox or Minnesota will win the AL Central, the loser is out. Same goes for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona in the NL West. 
The Mets still hope it's their season, a year after one of the biggest collapses in history. Having blown anoth­er late division lead to Philadelphia, they're trying to fend off Milwaukee for the wild card. 
And that's where that little grounder came into play. 
It definitely didn't look like the Mets' night Tuesday, when they fell behind early against the NL Central cham­pion Chicago Cubs. Needing a big hit, they got it in the most unlikely way. 
Or, as Cubs manager Lou Piniella called it, "a magic bat trick." 
Mets pitcher Johan Santana hit a hopper up the middle that looked to be a certain out. But his black maple bat shattered, and the barrel went skipping past the pitch­er's mound. As shortstop Ronny Cedeno got ready to field the ball, it somehow glanced off the tumbling, broken piece of wood. The ball deflected off Cedeno's glove and went for an infield single. 
"It should count for two hits," Santana said. "I was just lucky." 
·. lli ~i1l·:d r:ti~ ;:1~ l!· 
No one could recall seeing quite such a play and, no surprise, it keyed a fifth­inning rally that led to a vic­tory. 
"A fickle, funny game," Mets third baseman David Wright said. 
Older Cubs fans didn't find it so whimsical. They still remember all too well anoth­er night at Shea Stadium. 
Back in September 1969, the hard-luck Cubs brought a narrow lead into New York. Then in the first inning, with Tom Seaver pitching against them, Chicago saw something more scary: a black cat skit­tered onto the field and stared up close at several players in the dugout. 
Later, a few of the Cubs admitted it kind of spooked them to see that slinky feline. Within a matter of days, the Cubs fell out of first place and the Mets were on their way to an improbable World Series championship. 
The Phillies got a boost earlier this month when Schmidt e-mailed a note to manager Charlie Manuel 
Associated Press 
A black cat slinking across the field. A surprise note from a former star. An inno­cent ground ball that takes an incredible hop. 
Sure, a big bop from Manny Ramirez, Ryan Howard or Evan Longoria can help a team make the playoffs. But oh, those little omens can really push a team toward October. 
"Sometimes you hope fate falls in your favor," Milwaukee center fielder Mike Cameron said after a late comeback. "Baseball's a funny game. It builds charac­ter. It'll bring you joy. It'll bring you a lot, a lot of anger sometimes." 
No such worries at Wrigley Field and Fenway Park ­stadium workers can begin putting up the decorative bunting. Also ready is devil­ish Tropicana Field, where the Tampa Bay Rays have sold out the first two postsea­son games in team history. 
With less than a week left, races remain. Time to make a 
'small' and 

'big' things result, tough at-bats, lots of walks, stay up the middle with men on base, whatever it takes to 'keep the line moving' on offense, 27 outs on defense, the Mets know you're better than they are," Schmidt wrote. 
And then, in a poke at the Phils' rivals, he added: "They remember last year. You guys are never out of a game. Welcome the challenge that confronts you this weekend. You are the stars. Good luck." 
Given their druthers, the players would rather control their destiny. 
"Broken-bat contact in clutch situations is usually an out. One time is luck. Next time, sit down," Schmidt wrote Wednesday. "Omen is over." 
"The omen you are refer­ring to is driven by hindsight, after a victory," he said. "It wasn't an omen until the game was over and the team won." 
The Dodgers won Tuesday night, getting a big home run from Nomar Garciaparra to beat San Diego. 
"You want it to he in your hands," Garciaparra said. 
Garciaparra also had a message for his young team­mates in their first pennant chase. 
"Enjoy it. Don't take it for granted because you may never have this opportunity again. There's a lot of people in this clubhouse that have gone a lot of years and never been in the playoffs," he said. .

OLYMPIC GYMNASTICS 
Chinese investigation to include 2000 squad 
Associa1ed Press 
China's gold medal gymnasts arcn't tlw only ones whose ages arc getting a closer look. 
Th1~ investigation into the eli­gibility of the Chinese women's team in Beijing has been expandnd to include members of the 2000 squad, which won the bronze medal in Sydney, The Assodatnd Press has learned. 
International gymnastics offi­eials are exio!mining whether Yang Yun and Dong Fangxiao, in partieular, were old enough to compete. 
"If we had a look at all the articles that came before, dur­ing and after the games, there were always rumors about the ages of China's athletes in Sydney," Andre Gueisbuhler, secretary general of the International Gymnastics Federation. told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
"We did not have another ehoiee," hn said. "If' wn want to remain ITedible, then wo have to look into things." 
No otlwr Chinese toams are being investigated, Gueisbuhler said. 
"At this moment in time, we just havn concerns about 2000 and 2008," he said. 
The investigation is ongoing, a month al'tor the Beijing Games ended, and there is no timetable f'or whnn it will be finished. 
"It's a work in progress," said Emmanuelle Moreau, spokes­woman for the International Olympic Committee. "Until the work has been completed, there is nothing we can say." 
Yang's age has long been an issue for debate. 
In a .June 2007 interview that aired on state broadcaster China Central Television, Yang said she was 14 at the Sydney Gamns. 
Gymnastics rules require ath­letes to bo 16 during an Olympic yoar in order to compete. 
"At the time I was only 14," she said in the interview, done in Chinese. "I thought that if I railed this time, I'll do it again next time. There's still hope." 
That interview, which has been widely reported, contra­dicts lwr official birthdate, whieh is listed as Dee. 2, 1984 and made her eligible for Sydney. 
Dong's birthdate is listed as .Jan. 20, 1983, making her 17 at the timo of the Sydney Games. ller blog, however, includes a rnfonmee to being born in 1985. 
Yang is now engaged to Olympic all-around champion Yang Wei. Dong was a national technical official at the Beijing Olympics, serving as the secre­tary on vault. She was not part of any judging panel. 
Kui Yuanyuan, Ling Jie, Liu Xuan and Huang Mandan were the other members of China's 2000 squad. 
Age falsification has been a problem in gymnastics since the 1980s, after the minimum age was raised from 14 to 15 in an ell'ort to protect young athletes, whose bodies are still develop­ing, from serious injuries. Younger gymnasts are also thought to have an advantage because they are more flexible and are likely to have an easier time doing the tough skills the sport requires. They also aren't as likely to have a fear of fail­ure. 
The minimum age was raised to its current 16 in 1997. 
There were questions about the ages of China's Beijing squad months before the games, with media reports and online records suggesting several of the )..,'}'mnasts on the six-woman squad might be as young as 14. 
In Aug-ust, The Associated Press found registration lists previously posted on the Web site of the General Administration of Sport of China that showed He Kexin and Yang Yilin were too young to com­pete. A Nov. 3 story by the Chinese government's news agency, Xinhua, suggested He was only 14. 
But Chinese officials insisted -repeatedly and heatedly ­that all of its gymnasts were old enough, and they had not cheat­ed their way to their first Olympic team gold. The FIG and IOC hoped the matter had been put to rest before the games, when the IOC said it had checked all of the girls' pass­ports and found them to be valid. 
The controversy never went away, though, and the IOC announced three days before the games ended that it had asked the FIG to investigate one more time. 
China turned over birth cer­tificates, passports, ID cards and family residence permits tor He, Yang, Jiang Yuyuan, Deng Linlin and Li Shanshan. 
"The international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books, entries in schools and things like that," IOC president Jacques Hogge said on the final day of the games. "They have received the documents, and at first sight it seems to be OK."

Colston has led New Orleans in receiving each of the previous two sea­sons and Shockey is a former Pro Bowl player who was the Saints' second leading receiver through the first three games this season. 
Imagine how coach Sean Payton and Brees must have salivated at the though of Colston and Shockey on the field together, stretching defenses already preoccupied by Reggie Bush's versatility as both a running and receiv­ing threat. 
Then Colston tore liga­ments in his left thumb on opening day, sidelining him up to six weeks, and now Shockey is sidelined for a month or longer with a 
more action 
is Robert 
Meachem. If 
there was ever a time for him to prove he deserved to be the Saints' first-round draft choice in 2007, now would be it. 
Meachem couldn't get on the field during his rookie season. He finally made his regular season debut in Washington two weeks ago. His first NFL catch was a 19­yard touchdown. 
In Denver, he beat single coverage and hauled in a deep throw from Brees for a 74-yard gain that set up a touchdown. 
Meachem, who now has three catches for 105 yards in his young career, said he doesn't see any need to change his approach this week. 

"At receiver, that's proba­bly one of the cockiest posi­tions on any team," he said. "We have to step up, but all our goals are high anyway. :.. We're going to make our plays. We're going to dive. We're going to do everything in our power to make sure Drew's happy." 
Patten said he hoped to be ready by Sunday, calling his status day-to-day. Meanwhile, Terrance Copper, a special teams regular who has started sporadically since 2006, was limited in Wednesday's practice because of a hamstring pull that sidelined him for the Denver game. 
If they are unable to play, the Saints remaining healthy receivers would be Devery Henderson, Lance Moore and Meachem. The Saints also could activate Skyler Green or Joe West from the practice squad, but would have to temporarily termi­nate a veteran player's con­tract to make room. At tight end, the Saints will rely on Billy Miller, who was tem­porarily released during Week 2, then brought back last week. He caught two passes for 41 yards in Denver. 
Payton conceded that los­ing two top receivers pres­ents "a lot of challenges." Yet, he also noted that most of the receivers who remain have been effective when given a chance. 
· "Robert's been able to get more snaps. lie's done a good job. He made a big play for us last week," Payton said.

CYCLING 
Lance looking to prove he's clean 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK Lanee Armstrong is chasing an eighth Tour de Franee title and an elu­sive feat: persuading evnryone he's dean. 
As Armstrong reunites with his elose friend and Astana team director .Johan Bruyneel, the man behind his y1dlow jor­soys, he's also adding a new mmnber to his support group. Anti-doping expert Don Catlin has beon hired to test Armstrong anytime, anywhere -and to post the resulb online for the world to see. 
"I think it's the first time an athlnte can actually be totally validated on tho chanen he's successful," Armstrong said Wodnesday. "In my opinion, Don Catlin is 1myond rnproac:h." 
Armstrong nwealed details of' his comeback two weeks after saying hn would encl a three­yoar rntiromont. He'll ride for Astana and will eompete in the Tour Down Under in Adelaido, Australia, in January. 
The setting was the Clinton Clobal Initiative, the annual meeting of' f(mner Pn~sidnnt Bill Clinton's foundation. Armstrong held a news conl'ernnce to talk cyding after announcing a new worldwide campaign to light cancer before an audience of political and 1:orporate leaders. 

As he deseribed his 200CJ Tour plans, the 37-year-old Armstrong sometimes made it sound as though this was more a publicity move to raise aware­ness about the fight against cancer than a legitimate shot at winning an eighth title. 
"I think we're sure we'll have sueeess with the movement, bm:auso we need it," he said in an interview with The A'isociated Press, "but I'm not surn I'll be the fastest cyclist in the world." 
A'itana was banned from this year's Tour because of past doping violations. But Pat Md)uaid, the leader of cyding's governing body, said he believed the team would be allowed to return in 2009. 
The Amaury Group, which owns the company that organiz­es the Tour, has confirmed in writing to UCI that Ar.;tana is on il'i list of teams "that they say arn guaranteed to ride to the Tour de France in 2009 and 2010," he told the AP. 
Tour director Christian 
Prudhomme didn't respond to 
messages. 

The makeup of the 2009 A'itana team is unclear. Alberto Contador, the 2007 Tour de France champ, suggested in AS newspaper Tuesday that the two elite riders couldn't coexist on the same team. 
In a statement released by Astana on Wednesday, Contador was conciliatory but didn't commit to remaining on the team. 
"Hight now people are looking to make up controversy, but honestly I have no ill will towards Lance," he said. "I identify with his passion for the sport. lie has certainly been a role model for me and others throughout the world, and I imagine having him on Team Astana will only motivate me further." 
Contador, sih'Ilnd with Ar.;tana through 2010, won the Spanish Vuelta on Sunday. Combined with his 2008 Giro d'ltalia title, he became just the fifth cydist to win the thrne highest-rngard­ed Tours. 
"I think there's room for all of us on that team," Armstrong said. 
Another Astana rider, American Levi LPipheimer, is a former Armstrong teammate with U.S. Postal Service. 
"lie will make everyone on the team bntter, and that is a good thing," Leipheimer said from the eyding world champi­onships in VarnSI\ Italy. 
Armstrong also hopes to improve the next g1meration of cyclists, starting an under-23 team that will indude 18-year­old Taylor Phinney. Phinney, the son of 1984 Olympic medalists Connie Carpenter-Phinney and Davis Phinney, linished seventh at the Beijing Games in the indi­vidual pursuit. Axel Merekx, son of cyeling great Eddy Merckx, will lead the develop­ment tnam. 
Armstrong, the greatest rider of his generation, is counting on Catlin to help eement his legacy. Catlin will be paid by Astana, but McQuaid had no problem with that. 
"I would have every faith that the results that he will lind will be correct and transparent," McQuaid said in a telephone interview. "lie wouldn't suffer

fools, and he wouldn't be a man that would be involved in any­thing unethical or incorrect." 
Catlin oversaw testing for anabolic agents at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and ran the country's first anti-doping lab at UClA for 25 years. He now runs Anti-Doping Hesearch, a non­prolit organization he foundBd to rBsearch performance­enhancing drugs, uncovflr new drugs being used illegally and dBvelop tBsts to detect them. 
Armstrong said he didn't know what kinds of teslr.; Catlin would use. 
Catlin did not immediately return messages and emails left by The AssociatBd Press. 
"I think this will be the most advanced anti-doping program in the world," Armstrong said. ''I'm going to talk about it today; beyond today, I'm not going to tell you how clean I am, and I'm not going to insinuate how dirty the others are. 
''I'm going to ride my bike, I'm going to spread this mes­sage (about the fight against eancer) around the world, and Don Catlin can tell you if I'm clean or not." 
Kazakh Cycling Federation deputy chief Nikolai Proskurin said Armstrong agreed to ride for the Kazakhstan-based team for free the first year and has signed up to take part in five races. Armstrong wouldn't rule out competing beyond 2009, but for now that's all he's commit­ted to. 
His goals for his charitable work are clearer. Armstrong plans to hold a global summit on cancer in Paris after the Tour. He hopes to draw nearly a dozen world leaders, including the next U.S. president. His schedule in the months leading up to the Tour will be influ­encBd by the campaign to expand his foundation's light against cancer to underservcd parlr.; of the world.

PGA TouR 
RyderCup casts shadovv over FedEx Cup finale 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Chad Campbell 
tipp1~d over a small bucket of 
balls Wednnsday and hit 5-irons 
across the pond on the practice 
grnen at East Lake, norw quite 
as trun as tlw onn hn struck live 
days ago at Valhalla that 
earrwd a crucial point in the 
Hyder Cup. 
Campbell, the last player to 
qualify for the 30-man field at 
the Tour Championship, will be 
tlw first to tee ofT Thursday. 
lle'll understand if his game 
doesn't arrive until sometime 
later in the week. 
"It's going to take a few days," 
he said. "I think once the tour­
nament gets going, I'll be good 
to go. But everybody is a little 
bit worn out. There are some 
guys hern who arn fresh. I just 
don't think you can name any of 
tlwm who were at the Hyder 
Cup." 
Ten Americans who were 
spraying each olhnr with cham­
pagne on Sunday are trying to 
remind thnmsnlves that this, 
too, is a big week. The Tour 
Championship features a $7 
million purse. and for many 
players, their final PCA Tour 
event of the year. 
The only two missing at East 
Lake from the U.S. team are 
.I.B. llolmcs and Boo Weflkley. 
Sergio Gareia is the only Hyder 
Cup player from Europe who 
qualified for the Tour 
Championship. 
"It is different," said Hunter Mahan, who made his Hyder Cup debut going unbeaten in live matches. "It's weird going through that and then having to come to such a big event like this. We get a couple days to kind of fall back to earth and just back to the grind a little bit, so it should be good. It may take a round or two to actually get back into the flow of playing tournament golf again." 
The Hyder Cup is only one component that has taken the sizzle out of the FedEx Cup finale. 
A new points system during the PGA Tour Playoffs brought the kind of volatility the tour wanted. but it knocked out sev­
~ral players that otherwise would have had a right to be at East Lake. 
Padraig Harrington missed the cut in his first two playoff events. and for that he becomes the first PGA Tour member to win two majors in one year and still not qualify for the Tour Championship. Also missing is Adam Scott and Geoff Ogilvy, along with the Weekley, who might be the most popular man in golf these days for his antics and shotmaking during the Hyder Cup. 
As for the drama over who wins the FedEx Cup and the $10 mill ion prize? 
They could have started engraving Vijay Singh's name on the trophy two weeks ago. lie won the first two playoff events, and now only has to eomplnte four rounds at East Lake to capture the FcdEx Cup. Riveting stun·. 
"It's nice to know that all you need to do is finish thn round," Singh said. "It's been kind of strange in a way that your frionds and your family and your trainer keep saying, 'Don't over exercise. We'll have to just keep it nice and easy this week.' 
Gets in your head a little bit." 
It's hard to blame the tour for 
someone as talented as Singh 
winning two straight tourna­
ment, just as Tiger Woods won 
two straight events last year to 
take the drama out of the final 
wei1k. 
"Honestly, if you look back 
and think about it, every system 
could have provided a very 
exciting finish," Jim Furyk said. 
"You just had a player ... Tiger 
Woods goes out and wins twice 
and finishes second. You had a 
player that separated himself. 
This year, even though the sys­
tem was totally different, it 
could have provided a really 
exciting finish. It did not." 
Furyk at least is motivated by 
trying to pick up his first victory 
of the year, a goal that applies 
to 15 other players in the field, 
such as Steve Stricker, Ben 
Curtis, Mahan, Campbell and 
Trevor lmmelman. 
Even someone like Singh, who 
won the Tour Championship in 
2002, wants to finish off the 
smtson with another win. 
"This is a big event for us," he 
said. "Two years ago, three 
years ago, this was one of the 
major events on tour. That's the 
way I still look at it." 
But his comment was telling. 
Is the Tour Championship no 
longer one of the big events on 
the PGA Tour? It sure doesn't 
seem like one now, with one 
guy assured of the FedEx Cup 
simply by showing up, a field 
that includes first-timers Kevin 
Sutherland and Ken Duke, and 
a bunch of Americans suffering 
from Ryder Cup hangover. 
What once was considered 
golf's version of the All-Star 
game has all the atmosphere of 
a corporate outing. 
And just imagine if the Americans had lost the Ryder Cup. 
Two years ago, a World Golf Championship was held in London a week after the Ryder Cup. Furyk recalls being angry about losing, and after taking a day off. getting back to work to fix what was wrong. 
"Any time I've had a close call or lost in a playoff, it's usually about a day or two and then I get back to work," he said. "After you have a big win on tour. it's a little bit of a hang­over the next week, and emo­tionally, it's tough to get up and get ready." 
The tour brought this prob­lem on itself, and for that, 10 Americans are thankful. 
Remember, the Tour Championship was supposed to be the week before the Hyder Cup, but PGA Tour commission­er Tim Finchem agreed to move it back two weeks so the Americans (and some Europeans) would be fresh for the event that doesn't pay a dime. 
Finchem said he expects a good week and big crowd, and it helps that Saturday's round will be played early, so as not to conflict with the NBC broadcast of Notre Dame football. Thankfully, Georgia plays Alabama on Saturday night. 
In the meantime, he said changes to the FedEx Cup appear imminent. 
"We've got to have a climactic finish," Finch em said. "It's going to build to a finish."

Badin. 
"Farley's win was very impres­sive on Sunday," Bullfrog captain and quarterback Katie Hose llaekney said. "But we're looking to prevent big plays from their ofl'nnsn and senior sa((lty Kelsey Young will play a big part in doing that." 
Hose is also very confident in thn Bullfrogs' wide receiver corps. 

"We havn great receivers in Carli Fernandez, Hyan Cooney .-and Courtney Haines," she said . 
Despitn both Fernandez and Cooney being freshman, Hose expects thnrn to be an integral part of the passing game and continue to have an impact throughout the season. Fernandez caught a touchdown pass in Badin's 6-6 tie with Breen-J>hillips in their previous game. 
With their last game nnding in a stalmnate. llackney was eager to linally put a game in the win column. 
"After the Lie on Sunday, we're . looking to go out and get our first win of the snm;on." she said. 
Walsh vs. Pangborn 
Both Pangborn and Walsh will bn looking to rebound from shutout losses when the two meet tonight at IJ. 
Both teams anl young and their inexperience played a key role in each tnam's respective losses last wnek. 
Pangborn lost 14-0 to Welsh Family. but the coaches seemed phlased with the ell'ort, Pspecially on the delimsive side of the ball. MiddlP linobacker Andrea HagsdalH led the defimsive push, slowing the vaunted Welsh Family ommse. 
"The defense was solid and carried us last week," Phoxes coach Hyan Bell said. "Welsh Family has one of the best ofl'ens­es in the league and we were able to contain thHm" 
lie also mentioned that while defensive coordinator Mike Perry was pleased with results of last week's game, he wants to see morn emotion. 
"Perry is looking to cnmte a Sergio Brown, 'Crank me up' type of intensity on the defensive side of the ball," Bell said. 
I>Pspite the defensive effort, the Phoxes failed to seore any poinl<>, making the ofTense this week's prime fiJ1:us. 
"We have been working on get­ting the offense on the same page," Bllll said. "We have to be able to take advantage of the opportunities we are given." 
Like their opponent<>, the Wild Women will be looking to put last week's loss behind them. 
Walsh lost to Farley 26-0 but showed encoura~-,>ing signs on the ollensive side of the ball. Despite failing to score, sophomore quar­terback Amy Longneeker was able to move the ball down the field and lind the open reeeiver effectively. Longnecker and the rest of the oiTense will work on completing their drives and fmd­ing a way to put poinl<; up on the scoreboard. 
The Wild Women also hope to see improvement in their fresh­man athletes, many of whom got their first game experienee in the loss last weekend. With some game experienee the Wild Women hope to look more aggressive and physical on the field.

"I think I need to play a little bit more consistently," she said. "I've had some really good matches and also some match­es where I didn't play up to my potential." 
Kaelin also pointed out that the message of consistency translates to her team's play as well. The Irish have shown that they can play with anyone in the country, like when they took No. 4 California to live sets. But they also have let a few match­es get away, such as Sunday,

The junior gar rwrnd the starting keeper spot for the 2008 snason and has proved slw deserved it, leading top­ranked Notre Dame to six shutouts and allowing only two goals in its so far unde­feated season. 
Lysander played behind goalkeeper Lauren Karas, who graduatnd last spring, as a freshman and sophomore, and rather then letting her nerves take over, she's stepped up and into the start­ing position.

Irish may have Bright future 
In snvnn ganrns so far this season, senior forward Bright Dike has seored four goals ­not bad for someone who did­n't play a rninutP last season.

At 6-foot-1 and 200 lbs. of solid muscle, Dike is a physi­cal presenee defenses aren't accustomed to seeing. Hunning after balls, he 
reminds you of Vinee Young -hn doesn't look like he's running that hard, yet he's faster than everybody else on the field. 
Whnn othnr defenders try and body him for the ball, they seem to just bounce off. Many of the fouls called on Dike are not really actual infringements but rather ref­erees' dislwlief that one play­or is that mueh stronger than the eompetition. 
"It's like running into a 
brick wall," Irish coach Bobby Clark said of Dike. "You ran 't push him around, so that causes defenders a lot of problems." 

Although Dike is tied for the team lead in goals, the Irish offense has been a pleasantly balanced attack so far this season with a variety or players making significant contributions. 
Midfielders Dave Donahue and Michael Thomas share the team lead in goals with Dike at four, and eight play­ers have· found their way onto the score sheet. 
Still, don't expect Thomas and Donahue to be at the top of. the scornr's chart at the end of thn year. Thomas' role is more of an attacking play­makPr while Donahue looks to get wide and serve balls

Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's placed two golfers in the top four overall but took seeond by two strokes to Olivet in Wednesday's second­place finish at the MIAA Jamboree at Thornapple Pointn Golf Club in Grand Hapids, Mich. 
Sophomore Hosie O'Connor shot a 78 to tie for first in the individual standings. Freshman Jackie Dill posted a earner-best 80 to elaim a fourth-placn finish overall. Senior Perri llamma recorded the Belles' third bPst score with an 86. 
Saint Mary's was once again plagued by its inability to post top-quality rounds from its fourth and fifth golfers. Freshman Natalie Matuszak, who has been a major contribu­tor so far this season, battled through a tough day to eard an 87, and fellow freshman Christine Brown roundod out tlw Belles' scoring live with a 90. 
With one Jamboree and a two­round championship yet to be played, the Belles find tlwm­selves with 41-stroke dnficit behind reigning champion Olivet. 
The Bnlles will compete in the fourth MIAA .Jamboree, hosted by Adrian College Sept. 30, before playing for the MIAA Championship Oet. 10.
