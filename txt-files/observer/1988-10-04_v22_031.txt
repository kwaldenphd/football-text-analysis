Hiler, Ward to debate at ND 
By REGIS COCCIA 
MARK MCLAUGHLIN Senior Staff Reporters 
Notre Dame will host a debate Oct. 27 between Indiana 3rd Congressional District can­didates Rep. John Hiler and Tom Ward, Student Body Vice President Mike Paese said Monday. 
A panel of five or six students and a faculty moderator will question each candidate during the debate, said John Hamill, student political concerns com­misioner. Panelists have not been chosen yet, Paese said. 
"We want to focus issues on students: financial aid, grants, and also some national issues," said Mike Keegan, student ex­ecutive coordinator of political, cultural, and social concerns. 
The one-hour debate will be held in either the Monogram Room or the Concourse of the JACC, said Paese. About 100 in­ivtations are being sent to fac­ulty, administration officials and student leaders, he added. 
General seating would prob­ably be on a "first come, first served" basis but had not been finalized as yet, Paese said. Student Body President Tom Doyle said about 400 seats would be open to students. 
The debate at Notre Dame will be the third of four debates between the Republican Hiler and Democrat Ward, a Notre Dame graduate, said Hamill. A televised debate between the candidates is scheduled for Oct. 17, but the Notre Dame debate will not be televised. 
Hiler Campaign Manager 
Chris Nicholas and Ward Cam­
paign Manager Mike Marshall 
met Monday with Paese, 
Keegan and Hamill to discuss 
the debate. 
"I would say they were very easy to work with," said Keegan. "I was really im­pressed." 
Student government plans to provide information on each candidate to voting students from now until the election. 
"We're going to provide the forum and we're going to pro­vide the information," he added. "We just want to make sure people ... are interested in learning about the candi­dates before they vote." 
"We really wanted this to be something generated by the students," said Hamill. "We wanted it to be a student­oriented program, run by stu­dents, set up by students." 
Paese said several student organizations are co­sponsoring the debate. 
The debate will consist of two-minute opening state­ments by each candidate. In a format similar to the recent Presidential debates, each can­didate will have two minutes to answer questions from the panel and one minute for a rebuttal. Two-minute closing statements will also be alloted. 
The debate was brought to Notre Dame largely because of to the recent voter registration drive, run by Keegan and Hamill, which registered over 2,200 voters at Notre Dame and 
Saint Mary's. "That was the impetus that brought the can­didates here," said Hamill.

Shuttle touches down safely 
Associated Press 
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif.-The shuttle Dis­covery returned to a star­spangled welcome from more than 400,000 people Monday after a post-Challenger shakedown mission that NASA called "an absolutely stunning success." 
"Discovery, welcome back," Mission Control told com­mander Frederick Hauck as he guided the ship to a picture­perfect landing after a four­day, 1.6-million mile mission. 
"A great ending  to  the  new  
beginning''  of  the  manned  
space program.  

The national anthem was playing as the white ship leveled out and rolled to a stop on the center line painted on the hard-packed sand of this desert air base. It was precisely on time, at 9:37a.m. PDT. 
The crowd cheered and waved American flags for the successful completion of a mis­sion that ended a 32-month per­iod in which no manned Amer­ican ship went into space. 
"This is a banner day for all of us," said NASA administra­tor James Fletcher. "An ab­solutely stunning success," said Shuttle Chief Richard Tru­ly. 
But Truly balked at a ques­tion that implied that with the new success, the trauma of the Challenger explosion had been overcome. 
"Even when we've flown a few flights, we are not going to forget the Challenger acci­dent," he said. "For the people who work in the program, that's going to be on their

Hesburgh speaks on former presidents 
By JULIE FLANAGAN News Staff 
University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh spoke about the role of U.S. presidential leadership in changing the nation last eve­ning in St. Edward's Hall's Forum. 
"If you want to understand the history of the United States, a good place to begin is with the presidency," said Res­burgh. 
Hesburgh shared how he has personally known and worked with presidents beginning with President Eisenhower. At that time, Hesburgh said, "U.S. had apartheid as bad as, if not worse, than South Mrica today." In 1957, Hesburgh was working toward changing this as a member of the Civil Rights Commission. Hesburgh said the findings and suggestions of the commission, "changed the face of America." 
Hesburgh continued close contact with the adminstration of Kennedy. He labeled Ken­nedy "everyone's hero ... but very young, very inexperi­enced." Hesburgh continued, "because of the political situa­tion he was not what I would call a strong leader for human rights." According to Res­burgh, "a horrible recital of in­dignities to blacks continued." 
The major turning point to this situation was the Universal Civil Rights Act of 1964, said Hesburgh. "That bill in one night revolutionized the face of America in regard to civil rights." Before the bill, there were only six elected black of­ficials, now there are more than 6000 said Hesburgh. Res­burgh was an instrumental force in suggesting the content

Indiana death row inmate D. H. Fleenor's appeal was rejected Monday by the Supreme Court. The justices let stand rulings that D.H. Fleenor was properly sentenced in the shootings of his mother-in-law and her husband. His appeal did not challenge the murder convictions. Fleenor shot Nyla and Bill Harlow at their Madison, Ind., home on Dec. 12, 1982. Prosecutors said he blamed the Harlows for breaking up his marriage to Sandy Sedam Fleenor. Fleenor committed the murders in the presence of his estranged wife and three children, his wife's son and Har­low's two grandchildren. -Associated Press

INSIDE COLUMN 
Officials wrongly attacked for views on abortion 
Of late we residents of the Notre Dame com­munity have been quite inhospitable on the Viewpoint page. 
Dr. Theodore Cooper, the Chief Executive Of­ficer of the Upjohn Corporation, visited to deliver a talk on proper public policy options in response to the AIDS quandary and was lam­basted for his company's involvement with prostaglandins, drugs used, among other things, to induce miscarriage. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens visited to dedicate the new courtroom at the Notre Dame Law School and was abused for his pro-choice posi­tion in the landmark case Roe vs. Wade of 1973. 
The issue at hand is not the abortion question. I am an adamant anti-abortionist and would much enjoy convincing Dr. Cooper and Justice Stevens that their ways are erroneous. The issue is the myopic vision with which debate has been approached. 
To object to the visits of these two gentlemen is to focus one's deliberative energy wrongly on one singular issue and then draw one's con­clusions solely from this one issue. I ask that a bit more prudence be applied by those who make such objections. 
Consider for a moment Dr. Cooper and Justice Stevens. I do not know the specifics of either gentleman's character and accomplishments. However, each stands today in a position of considerable importance, and to reach such positions, I think it fair to say both must be relatively intelligent and reasonable. (Indeed, I pray thi:; is so of Justice Stevens). I think it highly unlikely either has whimsically developed his views on abortion. Each has, as have all responsible individuals, carefully weighed the many complex aspects of this agonizing issue and developed a coherent stance. 
The crux of the problem is to recognize that, important as it is, the abortion issue is but one of many. The nuclear arms race, capital punish­ment, the strangling Third World debt, apar­theid in South Africa are equally perplexing problems which also divide rational people. Why, I ask, were Dr. Cooper and Justice Stevens not grilled on their views on these issues as well? Surely they have developed positions on these just as they have done with abortion. One cannot argue that abortion is in some way more "moral" a problem; all these issues are equally weighty and merit similar consideration. In the

name of consistency, if we're going to question their views on abortion we must question them on much more than that. Draw up question­naires for any prospective guest speaker, sub­mit them to lie detector tests, bring out the leeches --and remember, if she weighs more than a duck she's a witch. 
Enough sarcasm. This extreme is obviously unwarranted --but so is the other which has been so endemic of late. Moderation must be the rule. Individuals should not be judged on every important issue: such an approach is un­doable because no two people agree on what constitutes "important", undesirable because difference of opinion is a necessary and healthy gadfly. Nor should individuals be judged on one single issue: such an approach is undesirable because one stance does not an individual make. 
Thus I hope in the future we will greet our guest speakers on campus with a more accom­modating mindframe. Judge them, but not too hastily.

Court to debate church and state 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Su­preme Court began a new term Monday and set the stage for an important church-state ruling in a Pittsburgh dispute over religious displays. 
The justices issued orders in some 1,000 cases as they returned to the bench after a three-month summer recess. They agreed to grant full review in 20 of them. 
Most significantly, the court said it will decide whether dis­plays of a Christmas nativity scene and a menorah, sym­bolizing the Jewish holiday of Chanukah, should be allowed at 
two government buildings in Pittsburgh. 

Although such disputes are not new to the court, the case offers Justice Anthony Ken­nedy his first opportunity to consider how high a wall the Constitution requires between 
government and religion. Many experts believe the court may be poised to make 

dramatic changes in the con-road workers.

Because of high dining hall quality standards, already prepared leftovers may not be reused. This results in huge amounts of edible but unusable food. 
To combat this waste, Mack­ett, together with students Mi­chael Lieberth, Tom Kelly, and Katharyn Barron, contacted Bill Hickey, director of Univer­sity Food Services, and got the stitutional tests applied in cer­tain freedom-of-religion cases. 
The court Monday also agreed to consider, for the second time in two years, the authority of states to deny un­employment benefits to people who refuse to work on their Sabbath. 
Illinois officials refused to pay benefits to a man whose refusal to work was not based on the doctrine of any estab­lished religious body but on his personal Christian belief. 
Despite his 12 years as a federal appeals court judge before becoming a justice last February, Kennedy's views on the politically volatile issue of religious freedom largely are 
unknown. In a separate action, the jus­
tices said they will decide whe­ther a railroad routinely may require its employees to take drug tests. 
At issue is whether the im­position of such tests must be negotiated as part of the collec­tive bargaining process with the unions that represent rail­

Foodshare prevents waste 
By CINDY PETRITES News Staff 
They said it couldn't be done, but last year second year Notre Dame law student Katharyn Barron started Foodshare, a group formed by Notre Dame students to prevent food waste in the dining halls. 
The project involves collect­ing prepared but unserved lef­tovers from the dining halls every night and distributing them to local charities in South Bend. 
"It's one way for students to partake in solving the hunger problem. We hear about starvation in Ethiopia all the time, but so much is here at our own back door," said Lisa Mackett, a Knott Hall sopho­more who joined Barron and 63

other Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students in their ef­forts. 
Every night four students in the group pick up the boxed lef­tovers, pans, and foodwarmers and distribute enough food for 50 to 75 meals to local agencies. Currently Foodshare serves the Hope Rescue Mission and Ko-Op 65. 
Foodshare is also looking for­ward to serving the downtown Center for the Homeless which will soon be open, said Father Michael Heppen, Foodshare's faculty advisor. 
The project was the initiative of several individuals. Mackett remembers working in the dining hall her freshman year and being amazed at the 
amount of food going to waste every night.

Cooperation between stu­

dents and the University Food 
Services was "better than ex­
pected," according to Hickey. 
"The young people involved 

in Foodshare have been ex­
tremely sensitive in working 
with the demands and needs of 
Food Services," he said. "They 
have done a really fine job." 
Ever since their initial suc­

cessful run on March 22, 1988, 
the program has operated at 
full force, continuing even 
throughout the summer. 
"Even from the beginning it 
has been so easy," Mackett 
said. 
"The only problem is that sometimes the people are un­familiar with the kind of food we're bringing them. Some of them have never even heard of linguini," she said. 
Foodshare sees itself as con­tributing not just to the people who directly benefit from the food but also to the Notre Dame campus as a whole. 
"We are so proud that our students are getting involved in the mainstream, dispelling the 'distant' image of Notre Dame in South Bend, and working to solve hunger one person at a time," Mackett said.

Bangladesh flood victims cry for help 
1,000 people at Notre Dame College, Dhaka, but also the continual boat trips to isolated villages to provide stranded people with food, medicine, and water purification supplies. 
Any funds sent to the Center to aid Bangladeshi flood victims will be trans­ferred immediately to Dhaka and dis­tributed in their entirety to those who are most in need. If you are able, please send a generous contribution to: 
Holy Cross Mission Center 
Bangladesh Flood Relief 
Post Office Box 543 
Notre Dame, Indiana 46556 
In the months to come, more than 1,400 families nationwide who have sup­ported the work of Holy Cross in Bangladesh for decades will help us to do what we can to alleviate the famine and disease sure to come in the wake of the floods. But your help is needed now. 
The sacrifice you make today can make a difference tomorrow in Dhaka or one of the needy villages, because the money will be placed at the poeple's disposal within days. Contributions are tax deductible and will be acknowl­edged. 
Father Richard V. Warner, C.S.C., is Counselor to the President and also serves as Associate Director ofthe Holy Cross Mission Center. 
The people of Bangladesh have suf­fered a lot during their seventeen years of independence. Unfortunately, most of what we know about the country and its people is as a result of the seemingly endless string of disasters that they ex­perience. 
Richard V. Warner 

guest column 
The Bangladesh of today is the result of a short but bloody war with Pakistan. In a period of nine months as many as three million people died, many of them slaughtered by troops sent to pu,t down a revolt in what was then East Pakis­tan. More deaths were avoided only when India finally intervened to end the war in 1971. The first few days of the newly independent nation were marked not only by a struggle to recover from the loss of many educated people ex­ecuted during the war, but also by the need to overcome the effects of a tidal wave which caused widespread death and destruction in 1970. 
Bangladesh is currently suffering some of the most severe flooding in its recent history. News reports from Bangladesh have indicated that more than two thirds of the country was un­der severe stress as a result. Once again, these hard working and long suf­fering people have come face to face 
Nine million tons of stored food have been destroyed by the effects of the water. The next rice crop will not be har­vested for nine months. 
with misery. While the total loss of life­-now estimated at over 1,500--and damage to crops, dwellings, and lives­tock may not be known for several more weeks, there is an immediate need for relief on a significant scale for what the Information Minister of Bangladesh has called "a situation which is beyond description or definition." 
Flood waters still cover most of the land, although the waters crested on Sept. 7. More than 40 percent of the capital city of Dhaka, populated by two million people, is still seriously af­fected. Fifty of the 64 districts of the country are still under water, and more than 12 million have been washed away. A recent article in The New York Times dramatically described the plight of people ''wading through water search­ing for shelter." Nine million tons of stored food have been destroyed by the effects of the water. The next rice crop will not be harvested for five months. 
Flooding during the monsoon season in Bangladesh is expected and is nec­essary for a good crop of rice. During a normal rainy season approximately 40 percent of the country, which is the size of the state of Wisconsin and has a population of 110 million people, is under water that gradually rises and assists the cultivation of the main staple. As a result of the present situa­tion, almost 70 percent of the country is flooded, and the waters have reached the highest levels recorded this cen­tury. 
While it will be essential in the months to come for the countries of the world to assist the Bangladeshi govern­ment in abating the long term results of the flood, our immediate individual response is important. 
For more than 130 years, priests, Brothers, and Sisters of the Congrega­tion of the Holy Cross have worked in Bangladesh. During that time more than a score of them have died at early ages from shipwreck, disease and vio­lence. The most recent death is that of Father William Evans, a Holy Cross priest killed during the war for inde­pendence and a man who is considered a martyr by Christians and Moslems alike. The Holy Cross Mission Center, located at Notre Dame, serves as a sup­port office for the work of these men and women, many of whom are now Bangladeshi Holy Cross religious. 
The Center has already sent a signif­icant contribution to assist the first ef­forts at relief. A recent letter from one of the Brothers describes not only the work of housing and feeding almost

Crime Stoppers at Notre Dame 
Dear Editor: 

Crime Stoppers International was formed in 1976 as "an imaginative and effective program which involves citizens in meaningful efforts to protect all members of society." Today, the University of Notre Dame has become the first to offer a Campus Crime Stop­pers Program. 
Notre Dame Crime Stoppers is an af­filiate of South Bend Crime Stoppers and therefore part of a national organi­zation to promote community involve­ment in solving crimes. This is accom­plished through a system which publicizes a "Crime of the Week" and a telephone hotline to encourage citizens to give information concerning specific crimes. The callers are as­signed code numbers to insure their anonymity and receive rewards if the tips lead to the arrest of a criminal. 
The Campus Crime of the Week can be seen courtesy of The Observer, to whom we shall be eternally grateful for their support--without the support of the media a program like ours would never succeed. Anyone wishing to report any information regarding that crime or any other can call the South Bend Crime Stoppers Hotline (288-STOP); they will be assigned a secret code num­ber and the information will be passed along to Notre Dame Security. 
Garry Trudeau 
Like other programs, ours is led by an Executive Board of Directors. The Board at Notre Dame includes: Ann­Marie Walker (president), Joe Lacher (vice-President), Robin Pedtke (secretary) , John Horning (treasurer) , Eric Emerson, Pat Cooke, Molly Jason, Victor Krebs (Graduate Student Union), Professor Dennis Moran, Bro­ther Bonaventure Scully, Jim Roemer (Director of Notre Dame Community Relations), and Phil Johnson (Assistant 
Director of Security). Anyone wishing to serve on the Board or as a member of a committee for publicity, fundrais­ing or education should contact one of the Board members. 
Campus crime has become an in­creasingly significant problem at col­leges and universities across the country. A recent issue of USA Today reported that there are an "estimated 500,000 thefts and as many as 20,000 vi­olent crimes--from homocide to rape assault--occur yearly on campuses." 
Programs like ours will hopefully begin througliout the country. In order for this to happen, however, we must first prove a worthy example. I urge each of you to become aware of this new campus organization. This is our chance to show the nation that Notre Dame is truly a place for traditions. To do so it will take a total community effort to successfully establish Notre Dame Crime Stoppers.

he S-word. Everybody wants it. Some people have it. For some it comes naturally; others have to work at it. It's not unique to men or women, young or old. Everybody can have it. 
Tweeds, a catalogue featuring clothes with "casual American comfort combined with European satisfaction," defined the S-word well: style is "the image expressed by those comfortable with themselves." 
But how, exactly, is this comfortable-with-self image expressed? "For many," as the Tweeds catalogue says, "personal style is creatively reflected in the body's closest environment--the clothing they wear." 
MARY BERGER

Back in the Highlife 
I 

My roommate and I were in Chicago this weekend and noticed that a lot of people strolling the streets of the Windy City have style. While sitting at an outdoor cafe in the early evening, we studied the passersby and tried to determine what it is about someone that makes them stylish. We now present our conclusions. 
First of all, there are a few styleless moves that we think should be 
avoided at all costs. Style presents itself from head to toe and the 
following just scream "incomplete style." 
For a woman dressed in a nice suit or dress, the stlye faux pas is the 
running or walking shoes and tennis socks she wears when out of the 
office. Understandably she may do a lot of walking, but a comfortable 
pair of flats are just as easy to find as athletic shoes, and they can just 
as easily slip into a bag or desk drawer. For a man who is dressed in a 
suit or nice slacks, the eyesore is the white tube socks he wears with 
his loafers. 

A few years ago it was stylish to be scruffy, but now the "Don 
Johnson look" is out. A natural man has style, but that means a 
well-scrubbed face and well-kept hair. The wet look with a five o'clock 
shadow just does not bring out the Jane in many women. 
The natural look is key for women too. Because style is a 
comfortable-with-self feeling, stylish women don't need lots of liner to 
catch someone's eye, nor do they need blotches of pink blush to have a 
natural glow. Grooming for the stylish is simply the enhancement of the 
beauty they naturally have. 

As for clothing, people with style don't wear outfits. They have 
wardrobes of mix-and-match clothes. They have many accessories 
which they use often and in uniquely personal ways. Women drape and 
tie scarves, they perk up an ensemble with panty hose, and they dance 
the night away in pumps, flats or slingbacks. 
Men tie one on with traditional cravats, bow ties or ascots; they 
pound the pavement in wingtips, loafers or bucks. And socks, when they 
aren't white, can be one of the greatest male outlets for stylish 
expression. Whether they be solid, with paisleys, stripes, dots or 
argyles, men with style often have hot sox. 
Now we arrive at one of the sweetest senses of style: cologne and perfume. In any store, there is a plethora of scents for men and women to choose from. Most of us have our own personal favorites, those we love to wear ourselves, and those we love to catch a wiff of on someone else. You know the kind of cologne we speak of when we say it enhances someone's style--one that will turn a man or woman's head, melt his or her heart, and make him or her want to nibble on your neck. 
On that note, we now conclude our style symposium. Style is not only the comfortable and confident expression of self, but it is the celebra­tion of self. Men and women with style express their beliefs in the clothes they wear and the way in which they wear them. 
We all wear clothes, but those with style seem to enjoy it more. They may be funky one day and conservative the next, but they are always themselves. They swing through life with styles all their own.

Founded in 1888 by Father Edward Sorin, Sorin College was the first college dormitory to feature private rooms. Since its founding, it has gar­nered a wealth of tradition and un­dergone several face lifts to reach its present state. 
The distinctive front porch of Sorln College Is a relaxing resting place on a nice day for Screaming Otters. 
Sorin originally housed the law school, the law library and its osten­tatious dean, "Colonel" William Hoynes. Hoynes was responsible for one of Sorin's most distinctive physi­cal features, the front porch. Erected in 1905 to prevent mischievous resi­dents from dumping water on people leaving the dorm, the porch has served as the site of pep rallies, tal­ent shows and concerts. 
Sorin's porch was also the sight of the dorm's 1969 "secession" from the University. Protesting residents declared themselves an independent college and posted a "Sorin College" placard on the porch. The placard hangs above the porch today, and 
Another architectural distinction of Sorin, the turrets, have housed some of the most famous Notre Dame foot­ball heroes. "Horseman" Harry Stuhldreher, quarterback of the 1924 National Championship team, lived in one. The basement turret, named the "Captain's Corner," has housed team captains such as Jim Lynch, Rocky Bleier, Larry Dinardo, and Tom Cle­ments. Current tri-captain Andy Heck ­continues this tradition of housmg football captains. 
Sorin was the home of heroes and heroic efforts. Legends such as Knute Rockne, George Gipp, Gus Dorais and Frank Leahy all made their home there. In addition, the "Notre Dame Victory March" was composed by residents John and Michael Shea during the 1908 football season. Sorin was the home to even more heroes, all of whose feats are documented and displayed in the recently opened Sorin Centennial Room. 
Today, the most prominent resident of Sorin College is University Presi­

dent Father Edward "Monk" Malloy. Monk organizes one of Sorin's more famous traditions, the pick-up basket­ball games affectionately known as "Monk Hoops." Each Monday and Wednesday night, Sorinites migrate to Moreau Seminary to play often fiercely competitive basketball games until after midnight. 
One of the dorm's lesser known traditions is the Sunday night laundry drop. Each Monday night from 10 until morning, Sorinites journey to the heights of the third floor to at­tempt "the drop." The goal of the contest is to drop the laundry bundle onto the narrow landing between the basement and first floor. Those who successfully execute "the drop" are rewarded by the respect of their peers. 
In celebration of the Sorin Centen­nial last year, Sorin College started another tradition. A graduation cere­mony was held last spring for graduating Sorinites, who received diplomas to commemerate their four years in Sorin. , 
The Sorin experiment seems to have payed off. Sorin remains one of the most respected and popular 
-dorms on campus, with perhaps the richest history of any.

ND performs well in weekend regatta 
The Sailing Club competed in a seventeen-team regatta last weekend at the University of Michigan. The Irish placed well in highly competitive regatta, taking an eighth­place finish in the "A" Division and a seventh-place finish in the "B" Division. 
Greg Scheckenbach 
Club Corner 
The"A" Division boat was raced by Pete Wall and Watts Hugens, while the "B" Division boat was captained by Patti Losinske and Tom Seffions. Both teams were pleased with their performance at the regatta even though they did not place higher. 
The club will attend a regatta at Purdue University this weekend. 
The Water Polo Club took 14 players to Hope College in Michigan last Friday to compete in its first match of the 
season. 
The attending teams included Hope College, Michigan, and Michigan State. Notre Dame beat Hope and Michigan, but lost to Michigan State in a tight battle. 
The club participated in this match without any practice because of the closure of Rolf's Aquatic Center. They will begin practice after Fall break if the pool is reopened. 
Water Polo Club President Jay Blount is planning to hold a major meet at Notre Dame later in the spring. He hopes to attract some major teams in order to strengthen the reputation of the club.

The Men's Volleyball Club has begun practice for the upcoming season. 
Coach Bill Anderson practices the team three times a week in the Joyce ACC Pit. The Irish will possibly make a trip to Canada later in the semester.

Suba vital to success of ND soccer program 
By BARB MORAN Sports Writer 

When Sylvia Kathleen Suba was a little girl, she, being the baby of the family, always wanted to tag along with her older siblings. 
Her constant cries of "Me too! Me too!" prompted her fa­ther to nickname her "Mimi" --the name by which she is still known. 
Though the nickname sticks to this day, sophomore Mimi Suba no longer is a follower, but rather has emerged as a leader on the Notte Dame wo­men's soccer team. 
Suba and the rest of the team will be displaying their skills tonight against Indiana Uni­versity of South Bend. It was in the season-opening 5-l vic­tory over IUSB that Mimi scored the first goal ever by the Notre Dame women's soccer team, which is in its first year of varsity competition. 
"Scoring that goal· made all the hard work worthwhile," said the St. Louis resident, who 
ACHA 
continued from page 16 

back. The Irish, coming off a best-ever 27-4-2 campaign last season, are awarding hockey scholarships for the first time in five years. Dearborn, cur­rently an NAIA school, also of­fers hockey scholarships and is attempting to receive NCAA Division I affiliation. 
Meanwhile, Kent State, which had a hard time compet­ing with its league rivals last season, won't even get the chance this year. 
Lake Forest failed to defeat either Notre Dame or Dear­born in nine tries last season. With both these teams upgrad­ing their programs, the Foresters won't find the going much easier in the near future. The Division III school won five league games last season only because it played Kent State five times. With the Golden Flashes now on a mandatory hiatus, those free victories are over. 
"The conference served its 
purpose very well for the 
schools involved," said Irish 
coach Ric Schafer. "Now 
things have changed. We have 
our sights set on a higher level 
in Division I." 

Notre Dame can reach that 
higher level by upgrading its 
schedule. This year's list of op­
ponents already is stronger 
than any the Irish have faced 
in years, with schools like Mic­
higan and Boston College 
replacing the Daytons and Vil­
lanovas that dotted last 
season's schedule. 

Last year, Notre Dame was ranked among the national in­dependents because the NCAA did not officially recognize the ACHA as a conference. If the Irish could become a true inde­pendent, it could allow Schafer more freedom in scheduling more opponents of a higher caliber. 
"I don't think we need to be 
a part of any league," said 
Schafer. "I've been getting 
phone calls from just about 
every team in the country wan­
ting to play Notre Dame now 
that they know we're coming 
back." 
rates the moment right up there with the time her high school basketball team won the Missouri state championship. "I couldn't have scored unless the other people passed me the ball. It's the defense that gets the ball to me. I just kick it in." Suba's soccer career started 
at an early age, as she began 
team play when she was just 
seven years old. Despite many 
successful years of athletics, 
she never dreamed of playing sports in college, especially at Notre Dame. 
"I never thought I would make the team," said the Far­ley Hall resident, "but I played Inter hall soccer last year, and that made me realize how much I wanted to play var­sity." 
Even though playing a var­sity sport cuts down on both so­cial life and studying time, Mimi has never regretted making the committment. 
"It's not like a job or some­thing you're forced to do," she explained, "It's a lot of fun. You just have to love the sport." 
Scheduling will become more important during the 1989-90 season, when an NCAA rule goes into effect that states an independent must have a min­imum of 20 games against Divi­sion I opponents to be consid­ered for the NCAA tournament. 
The demise of the ACHA also would probably benefit the Dearborn program. The Wolves had the toughest non­conference schedule of the four ACHA teams last season. Dear­born also won the regular­season ACHA title and defeated Notre Dame in three of the teams' five meetings. 
"They've improved dramati­cally," said Schafer, who had faced Dearborn in previous years when he coached Alaska­Fairbanks. "As they're getting better, they're finding it easier to schedule CCHA teams and other good teams." 
As things currently stand, 
three teams remain in the 
ACHA. It would be in the best 
interest of at least two of those 
teams for the conference to dis­
solve. The only solution seems 
fairly obvious.

Last-second FG lifts Saints 
Associated Press 

NEW ORLEANS -Morten An­dersen's 49-yard field goal as time ran out Monday night gave the New Orleans Saints a 20-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. 
Andersen's winning kick came after Roger Ruzek --who earlier had missed a 39-yard field goal that hit the upright -­connected from 39 with 24 seconds to go to tie it 17-17. The Cowboys went 43 yards on eight plays to set up the kick. 
But Mel Gray returned the ensuing kickoff 39 yards to his 
42. Bobby Hebert hit Brett Per­riman with a 26-yard comple­tion to the 32, setting up Ander­sen's kick. 
Hebert threw two early touchdown passes and Ander­sen kicked a 27-yard third­quarter field goal for the Saints, only to see Steve Pel­luer and Herschel Walker lead Dallas back. 
The win, the fourth straight after an opening game loss for New Orleans, was only its second ever in 13 meetings with Dallas and its first since Oct. 17, 1971. It moved the Saints into a te for first in the NFC

Buddy Leo scored on a 45-yard run to lead Holy Cross to its first win in two years. 
"It was a triumphant victory and a huge morale booster," said Holy Cross captain Pete Roberson. 
Defensive lineman Andy Pafaf also helped the cause with a safety. 
Alumni 6, Stanford 0: With the help of a successful game­ending goal-line stand, Alumni handed Stanford its first loss of the season. 
Pete Partin caught a 40 yard touchdown pass from quarter­back John Neirs for the Alumni points. Alumni remains unde­feated at 2-0, while Stanford falls to 2-1. 
Fisher 0, Pangborn 0: In a game that is always a big rivalry between both squads, the teams ended in a scoreless tie. 
"Both defenses played well but neither team could get anything going offensively," said Fisher captain Jim Twecek. ''Itwas a real physical game." 
Off-Campus 10, Morrissey 0: 
Brendon Max scored on a 12­yard bootleg and Tim Healy kicked a 41-yard field goal to improve the Crime to 1-2. Mor­rissey slips to 0-2-1.

a screaming cross right at 
Koontz, who again mishandled 
the ball. Senior Randy Morris 
was left with an open net, which 
he was more than happy to fill. 
"That wasn't what I wanted 
to see," said Grace of the 
Detroit game. "We get these vi­
sions of how outstanding we are 
(and then we let up)." 

The weekend certainly didn't 
help the Irish in the tourney 
chase. Akron, which the Irish 
take on next weekend, jumped 
all the way from sixth in the 
regional poll to second. 

"The shutouts better start

"or we'll be in trouble." 
Colts better than record 
Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS -Despite their record, the Indianapolis Colts are playing better football in some areas than they were a year ago, Coach Ron Meyer said Monday. 
"It's just not registering in wins," Meyer said one day after the Colts' record dropped to 1-4 with a 21-17 loss to New England. "There's a lot of reasons for that: three quarterbacks in five games, third-down conversions, shoddy tackling." 
The Colts started veteran Gary Hogeboom in their opening loss to Houston, then switched to third-year quar­terback Jack Trudeau, who injured his knee against Cleveland in the third week. 
Rookie Chris Chandler led the team to its victory over Miami and its loss Sunday to New England, and the offense sputtered both times. On Sunday, the Colts converted just one of 12 third-down opportunities, bringing the season count to 11 of 53 (21 percent). 
West with San Francisco and the Los Angeles Rams. 
But it wasn't easy. 
After Andersen's field goal with 3: 45 left in the third period put the Saints ahead, they thwarted Dallas twice. The first time came on an intercep­tion. the second when Ruzek's 39-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright with 2:24 left. 
But Ruzek nailed his next try. 

New Orleans jumped to a 14-0 lead in the first 19 minutes as Hebert threw touchdown passes of seven yards to Lon­zell Hill and 17 to Perriman. 
But Dallas came back with two TD passes from Pelluer to Kelvin Martin, the first for 13 yards midway through the second quarter, the second for 14 midway through the third. 
Belles remain unbeaten following weekend wins 
By HEATHER ATKINSON Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's tennis team remained undefeated with triumphs over Taylor University and St. Francis at Joliet last weekend. The Belles improved their season record to 16-0. 
On the road Friday, the Belles defeated Taylor 8-1. 
"They (Taylor) are one of the stronger teams we play," said head coach Deb Laverie. "They are greatly improved this year with their freshmen, so we were really happy to beat them." 
The Belles won the majority of the matches in straight sets. Outstanding performances were turned in by Jen Block, who won 6-2, 6-4, and Ellen Mayer, who recovered from her loss in the second set to conquer her opponent 6-4, 5-7, 6-2. 
The highlight of the matches occured with the number-one doubles team as Block teamed with Marie Koscielski. The duo won the first set 6-3, but was defeated 1-6 in the second. 
The third set shifted back and forth between games frequently. Block and Kos­cielski were trailing 5-4 in the third with their oppo­nents serving for match point. They broke their op­ponent's serve and forced the match into a tie-breaker. They rallied from behind in 
the tie-breaker to win the set 
and the match 7-6. 

At home against St. Francis Saturday, the Belles won 9-0. Saint Mary's dominated all of the singles and doubles matches with several of the players losing only one or two games. 
"There is always one team from Illinois to go to nation­als and St. Francis is usually fairly good competition for us," said Laverie. "To beat them so handily shows how strong we are at the national level. I feel we are the best team in the Midwest at this point."
