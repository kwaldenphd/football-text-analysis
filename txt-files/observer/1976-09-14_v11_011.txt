Sen. Mondale's talk stirs mixed opinions 
I 
by Mark Friedan PoUtical Reporter 
Members of the Notre Dame community entered Friday's spee­ch by Democratic Vice Presidential nominee, Senator Walter Mondale, with very low expectations of hearing a major policy statement. Although the members of the audience stressed different issues than Senator M6ndale, they seem­ed to like what they heard, and despite claims of not having made a choice, seemingly embraced the Carter-Mondale ticket. 
Senior Candy Fankovelgia found it, "disappointing that the Senator

avoided mention of abortion or the 
ERA, but it se911ed to be a very 
good crowd rea~tion." 
Others also expressed interest in the Carter-Mondale abortion posit­ion, but only . from a personal viewpoint. No ori~ spoken to felt it was an issue to base a campaign upon. St. Mary's freshman, Janet Moriarty~ commented, "A bortion really has no place in a national campaign. I think Carter has a very rational position, the position Ford has taken is simply a cop-out." 
The issue of the economy, and 
more specifically, the need for jobs 
was the major concern of the 
audience. John Thompson, 75, or 
rural Granger spoke of this, "I've 
watched elections for a number of 
years and the Democrats always 
seem to do us more good. I'm 
retired from Ball Band in Mishaw­
aka now and I would like to see 
inflation controlled also.'' ' 
St. Mary's Freshman Ann Dum­
as echoed these thoughts, but 
added a concern for a return of 
honesty in government and a 
reduction of bureaucratic red-tape. 
"Carter showed what he could do 
in Georgia, I see no reason why he 
couldn't continue to cut red-tape in 
the White House." 
Mondale Issues Coordinator Ste­, ve Engleberg summed up the mood 
of the crowd and the campaign 
from the Mondale perspective, 
when he said, "The purpose of this 
campaign is to return America to a 
decent and just society." 
On Friday the crowd in Stepan 
Center seemed to agree with the 
candidate on what needed to be

done; that they believe the Carter­Mondale team can perform the task is still up in the air. · 


Ozone shield threatened 
(continued from page 1) academy report said. "The impact on industry of a ban on uses of F-11 of F-12 in most types of spray cans would be appreciable.'' Against a background of a possible, although very small cha­nge in world climate, however, the industry impact does not loom large," it said. Less than one percent of the ozone layer has been depleted by fluorocarbons so far, the academy said, and it will be 40 to SO years at present fluorocarbon releases bef­ore half the maximum damage of about seven percent ozone depleti­on occurs. But once the ozone layer is significantly damaged, it added, repair will take much longer. Drs. Mario J. Molina and Frank 
S. Rowland of the University of California said in 1974 computer studies showed fluorocarbons tur­ned into chlorine that destroys ozone. 
Commenting yesterday on the academy's report, they said, "It's just very reassuring for us to find out that they think the problem is 
serious enough to do something about.''

Molina said he saw no need for panic and believes that the ozone layer can be restored by the turn of the century if tight regulations are put into effect to 1978. 
Serious Concern 

The academy report expressed "serious concern" the damage to the ozone shield could raise Earth's surface temperatures and change the cycle of rainfall and evaporatio­n. 
"Such changes could lead initia­lly to a general shift of the earth's climatic belts, and ultimately to a significant melting of polar ice and a worldwide increase in sea level, the report said. Damage to the ozone layer could lead, "perhaps in a century or two, to climatic change in drastic proportions," it said. 
In terms of huma health·, the academy said increased ultraviolet radiation resulting from a thinned ozone shield could increase the incidence of malignant melanoma, a type of skin cancer that kills one third of its victims and basal and squamous-cell skin cancers which are more frequent but less serious, although they cause medical expe­nse and sometimes disfigurment.

says there are almost 300,000 new cases of basal and squamous-cell skin cancer cases each year and almost 9,000 new cases of melano­ma cancers. 
A member of the academy panel, Dr. Thomas B. Fitzpatrick of Harvard Medical Schoo1, said the incidence of melanoma is rising five to 10 percent annually. 
The United States accounts for somewhat less than half the worl­d's fluorocarbon consumption the report said, and it will have to take the lead in reducing fluorocarbon pollution just as it took the lead in pioneering the uses of fluorocarbo­ns in aerosol sprays, refridgeration systems and in the manufacture of plastic foams.

Senatorial candidate Lugar states views 
by Katie Kerwin Staff Reporter 
Republican Senatorial candidate Richard Lugar outlined his position on major issues ranging from the defense budget to employment at a press conference last Friday in South Bend. 
Lugar spoke to a Riley High School government class, answer­ing questions from students and representatives of the news media. 

The candidate began by announ­cing his support for televised coverage of Congressional debates. 
"There can no longer be any justification for hiding the delibera­tions and decision-making of the legislative branch from public vi­ew,"Lugar declard. 
He added that similar legislation has been buried in the past and pledged to try to resurrect the proposal as a senator next year. Lugar cited first-hand observation of the governmental process by citizens as an advantage of TV debate coverage. 
"It would allow people to see what goes on on the floor of the Senate and the House, to notice who attends sessions and to ob­serve the quality of the debates. Improved attendance would pro­bably be another positive result.'' Lugar added. He stressed, how­ever, that coverage should· be selective. "Day-in, day-out cover­age would not be interesting to the viewer." 
Lugar opposes busing to ·achieve 
Voter registration through on-campus sources will be availab­le until Saturday, September 18, 1976. Students who wish to register after Saturday will have to go to the County City Building in downtown South Bend. 
Registration facilities will be present at the North and South Dining Halls tonight and tomorrow evening. If the turnout is good, the registration may continue until Friday, Sept. 17, 1976. 
Deputies eligible to register vot­racial balance, saying it leads to "a weakening of the fabric of educa­tion in cities where it is employed." 

He would favor an amendment in cities where it is employed." He would favor an amendment bann­ing busing. "I don't think there is a solution through the Federal government for attaining integra­tion." Lugar would prefer a voluntary program. He said that, having two sons in city public schools, he is particularly close to this issue. 
Lugar also said that he is against abortion and would support a constitutional amendment banning it. 
It is in the best interests of our foreign policy that Iran should be well-armed, Lugar asserted, and therefore he approves of sending arms to Iran. 
If we don't sell to them, he noted, they would probably just purchase the arms elsewhere. Armaments is a "burgeoning in­dustry which keeps hundred!) of thousands of Americans employ­ed," Lugar declared. 
Regarding the investigations of police corruption during his term as mayor of Indianapolis, Lugar said, "I think we did a good job cleaning out those who ought to be cleaned out. . .. 1 think it's a continuing problem and a very serious prob­lem. I took it very seriously then and I do now." He went on to say that after all the investigations there were only two police officers indicted. 
Voter registration held 
ers include Mary Giel, secretary in the Campus Ministry office room 103 of the Main Library and Paul Faldutio, 213 Morrissey. An estimated 1000 Notre Dame stude­nts have been registered so far this year. 
Students have until October 2, 1976 to register at the voter Registr· ation office in the County City Building, located on the corner of Lafayette and Jefferson. The office is open 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
Lugar opposes the Humphrey­Hawkins bill because he doesn't believe the federal government is capable of hiring the number of people the bill proposes. "I am convinced it would cause such an inflationary spiral in our economy that private industry would go into a server recession." 
He added later, "My feelings were that the Humphrey-Hawkins bill is not in fact, a measure for putting very many people on the payroll. It's a very expensive measure and I would gather, primarily, a debating tool as op­posed to a serious proposal." 
"I believe that the $104 billion proposed for federal defense this year is an appropriate sum of 'money," Lugar stated. "It's not a question of taking it away from welfare or food stamps, it's a question of Congress determining how much money is necessary to begin with to defend this country." 
If we lose our supplies of imported natural resources, Lugar cont­inued, the national economy will suffer too. 
Lugar does not favor the Senate bill for divestiture of oil companies because, 'I am inclined -to believe that substantial competition exists in the oil industry and I'm not inclined to believe the divestiture bill would lead to anymore." He favors development of renewable energy sources, such as solar and tidal energy and a gradual deregu­
1lation of oil and natural gas prices. Without federal price controls on gas and oil, solar and tidal energy would be more competitive econo­mically. Promotion of world trade has a 
· direct effect on job security in Indiana, Lugar noted. O­ver 300,000 people are directly involved in world trad, and elimina­tion of exports from income flow in Indiana would affect all or most of these people. Exports are a "substantial part of the dynamic growth of our economy and our best hope of maintaining close to full employment," he said. Lugar will face his opponent, Senator Vance Hartke, in a televis­ed debate on Oct. 13.

Regular re gistration for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) closed as of Thurs. Sept. 9. Students wishing to take the test can still submit an application until Thurs. Sept. 16, according to Dr. Grande, campus representative for the Educational Testing Service which will administer the LSAT. A late registration fee will be requir­ed in addition to the regular test fee of $13.00. 
Applications for the test are available in Dr. Grande's office in the Freshman Year building and in Dean Waddick's office in O'Shaug­nessy. The completed form will then be sent to the Educational Testing service. 
It is also possible to register, Dr. Grande noted, as a walk-in candid­ate on the test date. In this case a $10.00 additional fee is required. Whether the student is able to take the test will depend on the availab­ility of sufficient test supplies. 
Students taking the LSAT are requested to report at Stepan Center, by 8:30 on Sat., Oct. 9. Dr. Grande estimates that approximat­ely 275-300 students will take the test if this year follows the trend of

Although I am loathe to disagree with my good friend and articulate colleague, Professor Martin, I was 1 startled by his unequivocal con­·demnation of Crossroads Park in Friday's Observer. A Piazza

Nevertheless, the Park does repre­sent an attempt at an outdoor amenityherefor which many of us are grateful. And I am deeply appreciative of those students who worked so hard (I watched them in

iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiipe er or 
On Friday, September 10, the Gay Community of Notre Dame applied for official University re~o­gnition. This group has, in the past, maintained a low profile on 
d h t d 'th t 
assts· ta nee from the Unt'verst'ty· 
Why has this 'step been taken? The group has not been politically oriented, and has not participated in the banner-waving of many gay liberation organizations. There is 
h .. d' I" 
no evidence that sue ra tea activity shall be undertaken. The reasons for desiring a University charter, perhaps fall under one simple motivation: the·group is of the University, that is composed of members of the academic commun­
tty, and should therefore be recog­nized by the University. 
For most campus organizations obtaining University recognition is a fairly simple procedure. The 
f h G C 't 
application ° t e ay ommum Y is without pre.cedence; and the University will not accept it immed­iately. As a Catholic university, and as a Christian community, the issue deserves careful considera­tion, . and the gay students are 
ffi .
assured that University o tela1s are 
Recognition from the administra­tion is but one facet of the Gay Community's plans for the coming 
ear. A very important encounter
Y lt'es between G.C.N.D. and the student body as a whole. The 
students have been made aware of the organization in the past, and have known it to be anonymous and 
secrett've. The group feels that this 1·s a phase that must end, and university recognition is the essen: tial step that will allow G.C.N.D. to assume an open role in the activit­
ies of Notre Dame. What does the Gay Community of Notre Dame have to offer the 
University? The focus of the group 
is largely educational. The partici-\ 
. pation of the gay students in student activities does not make the statement "gay is good"; more correctly, it acknowledges that 
members of society, a good many of them, are homosexual, and that they must be neither outcast nor isolated from society as a whole. 
It would be impossible for any person to go through their lifetime without dealing with the issue in ­
some context. Nearly every field of academics is touched by homosex­uality in one way or another; sociology, in questions of society and family; theology, in examina­tions of morality; literature and 
history, in the examination of literary and historical personages; and the list continues. It is only practical and sensible for a univers­ity to deal with homosexuality as an issue and homosexuals as members 
of its community. 
The Gay Community of Notre Dame would like to hold open meetings on campus; to invite 
1 educators to speak on homosexual­ity as it relates to their field, be it Marxist theory or moral philoso­
phy.

A Reporter's Life on the Campaign Trail 
Editor's note: Kenneili Reich, a senior poUtlcal reporter for the ws Angeles Times, foUowed the Walter Mondale campaign to South Bend last Friday. He discussed his life on the campaign trail with Executive Editor Gregg Bangs, Features Editor Tim O'ReUey, and Senior Staff Reporter Pat Cole. 
Observer: Could you teD us your past experience In journalism? Reich: I've worked for the ws Angeles Times since 1965, and before that I worked for Life magazine for 2 years, mainly on civil rights stories, and 1Y2 years before that with UPI. Observer: How long have you been covering politics for the times? Reich: Since 1966. I went to work for the Times in 1965 as a suburban section reporter out in West Los Angeles, and I came down to the main city room in 1967. Then in the fall of '67, George Wallace came to town to solicit signatures to get on the California ballot in 1968, and I was assigned to cover that for a month. From that, I was assigned to cover the McCarthy campaign in 1968. I followed his campaign from New Hampshire to the Democratic Convention. So that's how I got into it. 
I covered the Mayor's race in Los Angeles in 1969, and I went South for the Times in 1970. I covered a good deal Of Southern politics there. Then, in 1972, I became a full-time political writer. But actually, my background in political writing goes back to 1962, when I covered the Nixon gubernatorial campaign for UPI. Observer: What, from your experience, have been the best run cBDlpaigns? For instance, the Carter organization Is always highly touted. Reich: I think Carter's staff is given more than its due. It has not grown gracefully. It was a good staff when he had a few people he could trust, but as they've added to the staff, I think they've lost efficiency rather than gained it. They necessarily had to grow larger, but it is not as sensitive a staff now as earlier. I think that part of the problem that any campaign had, that like Carter's had small beginnings, is that the people who have been there from the start are so anxious to guard their own position against newcomers, that they don't broa~­en themselves like they might have. I think they wasted a lot of time this summer when they should have been working hard on Carter's weakenesses, and they could have done it. 
If you were to ask me the most effective campaign I've ever seen, I don't know. I could tell you about the most exciting or impassioned campaign but I would really hesitate to reach a judgement on the most effective. I would be tempted to say the Nixon campaign in 1972, but of course they engaged in all sorts of criminal activities, so maybe that's why they were so efficient. 
The most interesting campaigns I've covered have been three: one being the race for mayor of L.A. between Sam Yorty and Tom Bradley in 1969, in which Yorty waged a very racist campaign, second, the race between Albert Brewer and George Wallace for the Democratic nomination in 1970, and third, the Florida primary this past year, where Carter beat Wallace. I think in all three, there was real issues, they vigorously and ably fought on both sides, and turnout was good in all three races. I think that problems tend to take care of themselves if real issues are under debate, and if there is a meaningful choice, I think the people will turn out in large numbers, but you can't expect, with two candidates who don't stand for very much, to have a very good turnout. Observer: What kind of schedule do you keep during the course of a cBDlpaign? Reich: Of course, when you are travelling with a candidate, you are beholden to his s~hedule. Some candidates campaign more hours than others. Carter has great stamina, and I remember one day in Florida when we left at 7:00 am, then didn't arrive until 1:00 am the ·following morning. Nobody had any food. When we problem for ilie candidates? Reich: Yes, it is for some more than others. I thought, for instance, that one of Birch Bayh's major problems was his lack of stamina, or any ability to know how to pace himself. He'd come into Los Angeles, and one of the most difficult things a candidate has to do is to cross time zones in a jet, and he'd arrive at midnight (3:00 am in the east), and then have to get up for an early breakfast. So, it wasn't too surprising that he wasn't in the best mood. 
In fact, he deteriorated, physically and every other way during the course of the campaign. Observer:, How much Influence does the Washington bureau have over the content of your stories? Reich: I must confess, that I'm not too fond of Washington D.C. I've never wanted to go to Washington myself, and I've always preferred living in Los Angel­es. We have a large Washington bureau that does many good things, but I've seldom been to Washington in this or any year. Observer: Do most papers have a reporte1· cover a candidate all the way through the cBDlpailgn, or are writers switched from candidate to candidate as you have been. Is this switching poUcy new? Reich: No, we've done this several times in the past. This year, I've covered Carter from January through March, Reagan in April and May, Carter in June, July and. August. Now, someone else is on Carter, and I'm on a two-week trip through the mid-west and Texas, and will file a number of stories on the political mood of these two regions..The plan now is for me to go back 
by Gregg Bangs and Tim O'ReUey 
In the interview surrounding this article, Kenneth Reieh describes· his life as a political reporter for the ws An~eles Times. Besides showing an enotU"mous amount of knowledge of the current political scene, he also expressed genuine interest in the opinions of the people he talked with at Notre Dame, no matter how closely they followed. politics. 
However, at Senator Mondale's speech, he looked disinterested, if not downright bored. Why would a man wh~se' career depends on politics be that way? After spending just one morning covering Sen. Mondale's visit, we could sympathize. 
Not that the day was boring; on the contrary, it was quite interesting and enlightening. However, th!'!re are certain aspects of the campaign routine that could drive a reporter to a state of disinterest. 
The first item was breakfast, if you could call it that. For a mere $25 a plate loy_al 
to Carter in October. So what we have here 

, is not a constant accompaniment of a candidate, though an emphasis on one. Observer: After the election, how wiD th.e Times allocate Its. coverage? 
Reich: The Washington bureau will cover most of the national politics until the next election, while we have a four-man bureau in Sacramento that will cover the state affairs, and I will cover the Mayor's race in L.A. (April '77). 
I have kind of a four-year cycle. The first part of the year follo'Ying the presidential election, I cover the Mayor's race in L.A., which sometimes lead to a runoff, so it sometimes lasts five or six months rather than three or· four. Then I cover the mid-term elections and governors race and then the presidential race. In between them, I do some investigative reporting of one sort or another. During '73-'74 there was a great deal of Watergate reporting, since a lot of the people lived in California, and returned there when they were fired or resigned. It gave me a lot to do, a lot of San Clemente stories. All of Nixon's tax pres~iures. He does not always have to be in a good mood like the candidate is expected to be in. He has not got his phone ringilrtg night and day when he finds hims·elf resting. .Some reporters have it harder than others. I think this year in parti,~ular, the TV reporters merit the high salaries that they receive by the simple being-on-the-scenes reporting that they do. This summer in Plains, Ga., the newspaper people would have to write one story a day, if that, and had a pretty relaxing summer. But the TV reporters had bosses in New York that were anxious to get anything they could. So they would have to go to Plains at 7:00 am, on the off-chance that Carter would go to one of his farms or something. It varies, but I don't think it is a particularly hard life by and large. There are certainly things that can happen unexpectedly. If the President much more inconstant. They shift people around because of ratings. I got to know a woman reporter when I was in Plains, Judy Woodruff of NBC,.she was transferred off of Carter after doing months of work, I think, simply because she didn't dress well enough, not because of anything being wrong with her thought processes. Observer: Bow great Is ilie danger of "pack journalism" presenting a distorted view of the candidates to the readers? Kelch: I think there is pack journalism to this extent: when ·something comes up such as Carter and the abortion issue, where the candidate is somewhat jostled about, then the reporters all write about that, on an issue where there is a great flurry of interest. I think the saving grace is that even when they are all writing about the same topic, they generally write some differ!'!nt things. There are some serious 

is shot in Dallas, reporters are certainly differences among reporters and what they 
going to have a rough time, working day and night. At conventions, it is the same thing, you need your stamina then.· But othe1wise, I think that the rigors are often exaggerated. 
Hunter Thompson is by no beams a typical reporter. Typical reporters stay with a candidate for a month or more. Thompson would come in for five days, take a powder, write a peice, so I would hesitate to take him too seriously. Rather than being physically demanding, it is a glamorous assignment that most people 
· would enjoy doing. Obs~:rver: Do you have a family back In L.A.'? Reich: Yes. Obs~·rver: But doesn't being on the road!

Evaluation: 




What's so exciting? 
South Bend Democrats could feast on a shot glass of orange juice, two flavorful, fruity danishes that were the size of triscui.ts (butter graciously included), and coffee that hit your stomach harder than South Dining Hall donuts. Even more startling, few people, save starving report­ers bothered to eat this mouse-size meal. Perhaps the people who skipped the meal were veterans of the fund-raising circuit and had eaten breakfast at home, knowing exactly what wa:> in store for them when they t~ntered the Monogram Room. No matter to the three Observer reporters who ate the equivalent often untouched place-set­
tings of food. 
Next came what everybody was waiting 
for: s:peeches that were more stale than 
the coffee. After the usual overdone 
introductions, Sen. Mondale rattled off the 
usual line of "original" jokes. They were 
all right at the time, but after hearing them 
all over again a mere two hours later, th:;v

the time, like some national reporters in Washington, it would severely hurt my family life, and in many such cases it has led to divorce. In my case, I do :this only one out of every four years. The other thret~ I'm around town. Even when I'm covering state politics, you can take-off from L.A. in the morning, anyplace in the stat(:, and be back by nighttime. This year, I've done several things to soften on my wife and family. When I was assigned to Plains, they came in June for a week and in August for 2 weeks. It cost quite a bit of money, but it was worth it. I also got my wife full-time help to free her from constantly being around the house since we havt: two small children. So there are 
problems in that area. 
On the question of the rubber chicken 
dinl1lers; reporters working for major 
newspapers or TV stations have liberal think about something. Pack JOurnalism 
does exist, but not as much as some people 
say. There is no conspiracy among 
reporters, along the Spiro Agnew lines. 
Observer: The book, IBoys on the Bus. portrays editors as being conservative in , accepting stories that say things different 
from other newspapers. How much do ·your editors control your stories? 
Reich: Well, we do have discussions with 
the editors. For today, I talked to my 
editors, and told them that we should not 
emphasize the foreign policy story since he 
has said it all before. Rather, I would 
accentuate his appeal to voters not to vote 
on the basis of accent or religion, and he 
agreed with me. If UPI came up with an 
arresting that I didn't, I suppose they 
wo~daskmewhy. Butonmynewspape~ 
at least, there is not very stringent editorial control. Observer: A recent article In TV Guide indicated that third party candidates are probably not getting the covenge they deserve. Do you agree? Reich: No. If you take the percentage of vote that these people are going to get, we ought to spend our time on those candidates who stand a reasonable chance of getting elected. Some, like Lester Maddox, are off on ego-trips, and other minor candidates are not going to affect the outcome. I think, for example, Eugene McCarthy has gotten coverage. far out of proportion with the vote he is going to achieve in the election. I am not one who believes in wasting time on these people, except in the few instances, such as socialist Norman Thomas, who have no hope of winning, but are trying to raise serious issues. Observer: I seems Uke there Is a love-hate relationship between the press and the American people. After the revelations of Watergate, It seems Uke the people are a bit more skeptical about the press. 
Reich: I think there has always been skepticism about the press. People ought to realize that it is written with point of view, it is a subjective process of what to write and what not to write. People should read an artide and decide whether they agree with it or not. But I think the public sympathy for the press has increased since Watergate broke. Observer: Many people charge that the press tries to manipulate pubUc opinion. Bow much do you work over the wording of an article? Reich: Most of my articles are written rather quickly because of deadline pres­sures. Sometimes, I think the next day that I would say something differently. But I think the capacity of the press to minipulate public opinion is easily exag­gerated. · Take a look at the marvellous cynicism that people in a country with a controlled press view the newspapers. And I think that cynicism is as valid in a free society as in a controlled one. It has happened, but I don't think it is a major problem. 
Observer: Many countries, especially in Western Europe, look lipon our elecdons as somewhat like circuses.Do you have any suggesdons for inllprovement? 
arrived at the DuPont Hotel in Miami, all the restaurants were closed, and Carter simply said, "They'll be serving breakfast in the morning." 
When you are on your own, like I am now, I just got off the Mondale campaign, then you sort of set your own schedule, according to what there is to do. I try to take a day off once a week, because I find that if you do work all the time, you do get stale, you're not as effective as if you rest one day a week. Observer; Do you think staleness Is also a accountants lived in L.A., and there was a constant stream of things to be written about. But I don't think too far ahead about these things, I don't know what I'll be doing in the latter part of '77. Observer: People, such as Bunter Thomp­son, describe the reporter's life as being alniost as tiring as that of a pro basketbmll player's. HIt's true, how do you keep yotu stamina up? Kelch: I don't think it is as tiring for the reporter as it is for the candidate. In the first place, the reporter is under far fewer expense accounts and seldom eat chicken, 
unless they like it. Observer: Have · you ever thought of switching from print to TV? Kekh: I've done a little TV when I've been invited to appear as a guest on discussion programs, but it does not appeal to me as mu<:h as newspaper work. I kind of like the permanency of print, and it's· the way I prefer to express myself. I've never given mu<:h serious consideration to a TV job. 
I don't envy the TV people. It's a much better paid than newspaper work, but it is Reich: The elections could be shortened up .some, with the conventions in the last two weeks of August, for instance. It does go on too long to really hold people's attention, and unfortunately the key decisions are ~ade when not too many people care. The turnout in the very important, early primaries are cast some­times by only a minority of the people, so things could be shortened. But in a country as diverse as the United States, I don't know how you could restrict the process otherwise.

Faculty boasts quality and quantity 
Fifteen academic administrative appointments, some of them anno­unced previously, have been made by the University of Notre Dame's Office of the Provost for the 1976-1977 academic year. Rev. James T. Burtchaell, C.S.C., also announced 99 faculty appointments.

PASADENA* Calif. AP · Scientists tried desperately yesterday to unj­am a mechanical arm on the viking 2 robot that was delaying the experiment most likely· to show whether there is life on Mars. 
Three biology experiments abo­ard the lander were properly cranking away, meanwhile, appar­antly having received their regimen of Martain soil, scientists said.

Similar difficulties developed w­ith Viking 1's sampler arm when it first scratched the surface of Chry­se, 4,600 miles away. As it was pulling back to deliver its second soil sample, it jammed. Scientists ordered the arm to extend itself again and it came back properly.
