Senators discuss assaults  
By MARY KATE MALONE News Editor Chief executive assistant Liz Brown led a lengthy discussion on the best way to decimate informa­tion about sexual assault resources at the Student Senate meeting Wednesday. Brown asked senators for their input on the issue before she meets with Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Bill Kirk on Friday to discuss sexual assault information and resources on campus. Breen-Phillips senator Maris Braun said bathroom posters about sexual assault are not ade­quate enough. The light blue, laminated signs are supposed to be in every resi­dence hall batlrroom, but accord­ing to senators who surveyed their respective dorms. the posters are not widespread. "I think posters are helpful, but in the heat of the moment I don't know ifyou'll have all your mental facilities together enough to do Step One, Step Two," Braun said, referring to the poster's step-by­step advice for students who havn just been sexually a<;saulted. "We might want to look at other avenues," she said. But exactly what those avenues should be was debatable.

Abroad pricing policy to change 

The International Studies Office encourages students to study abroad now more than ever with the coming new price policies. 
Fee adjustment allows for more participation 
By JOE PIARULLI 
News Writer 

Over 50 percent of Notre Dame undergraduate stu­dents spend part of their col­lege careers far away from South Bend -between 900 and 1,000 students choose to take part in one of the University's more than 40 international study programs annually. 
As a response to the contin­uously increasing student demand for study abroad pro­grams, a new study abroad pricing policy will go into effect in the fall of 2007.

SMC dance marathon w-ins national aw-ard 
Dancers raise funds for Riley's Hospital 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 
When 190 Saint Mary's stu­dents sacrificed sleep last April 20 to benefit Riley's Hospital for Children they had no idea what a difference they would make. 
After months of planning and fundraising, the first annual, dance marathon not only raised $21,047.42, but was also named Best New Marathon at the Children's Miracle Network Dance Marathon Leadership Conference 2006, which was held in Cincinnati July 14-16. 
In order to win the award, someone at the school or a peer 
school had to nominate the marathon, said Pauline Kistka, eo-president of the dance marathon. 
Competing against approxi­mately 80 other schools, the Saint Mary's dance marathon tied with Loras College in Iowa as the nation's best new marathon. 
The College dance marathon organizers were pleased with themselves and their fellow stu­dents, Kistka said, and proud to get Saint Mary's recognized. 
Riley's Hospital for Children uses donations from nationwide dance marathons towards the care of children who cannot afford necessary medical care, making the College's large dona­tion great aid to their mission.

Selling out a IIclassic'' 
The last time it happened was 1996. There on the television screen was a Dirt Devil vacuum cleaner. 
Dancing with it was screen legend Fred Astaire. My favorite male star and fellow tap dancer was being used posthu­Cassie Belek mously to sell a vac­uum cleaner.

Scene Editor 
outrageousness of the image did little to respect the legacy of the star and instead made the ad laughable. 
Astaire deserved so much more. 

Now, imagine my horror and disgust 10 years later when Astaire's late great co­star in "Funny Face" is being similarly exploited. 
I am, of course, speaking of Audrey Hepburn -my all-time favorite female star. 
Audrey Hepburn, a Hollywood icon of enormous talent, grace and beauty who devoted the end of her life to saving the lives of children through UNICEF, is being used to sell black pants for Gap. 
The commercial features the dance from her movie with Astaire set against AC/DC's "Back in Black." 
Upon seeing the ad, I was left speechless for the first time since last year's USC game. 
What many do not realize is how impor­tant that dance was to Audrey. 
As a child growing up in Europe, her one great love was ballet. After getting a late start on her passion in England, she had to postpone her dreams of becoming a prima ballerina when WWII broke out and her mother took her back home to Holland. 
The combination of severe malnutrition from the war and not enough training led her to abandon her dancing dreams and pursue modeling and acting instead. 
However, her first love would always be dance. 
"Funny Face" was an opportunity for Audrey to display her true passion and to release years of pent up energy. 
Not only was she to dance with the great Fred Astaire, but she was to have a dance solo in which she could be as free and uninhibited as her own spirit. It was a dream come true and for that it was per­haps her favorite film. 
Audrey, like so many other actors, hated watching her own movies. I can only imagine her horror at seeing such a shin­ing moment and personal victory dis­played three times an hour to pawn black pants to consumers in America. 
Yes, Audrey remains a fashion icon, but as a fashion icon she was devoted to cer­tain designers. Givenchy was her first favored designer, and later in life she remained faithful to Ralph Lauren. If any­one should have use of her image, it should be these two designers who were her intimate friends as well. 
Is Audrey rolling around in her grave? Perhaps I do not know for sure. But I do believe that the Gap commercial cheapens her iconic image and legacy. 
Just like Astaire, Audrey deserves more than being known to young people as "that girl doing the crazy dance in the Gap commercials." 
Finally, her dance in "Funny Face" deserves to be remembered as the person­al achievement it was, and not as a ploy to sell fairly priced pants to young girls who know nothing of her beautiful life.

Panda bites man and man bites panda back at zoo 
BEIJING -A drunken Chinese migrant worker jumped into a panda enclo­sure at the Beijing Zoo, was bitten by the bear and retal­iated by chomping down on the animal's back, state media said Wednesday.

Abroad 
continued from page 1 
Douthwaite, Assistant Provost for the Office of International Studies (OIS), students should see the new pricing program as a benefit. 
"The main thing is that we believe we will be able to send more students abroad," she said. "We've been having to turn away qualified appli­cants in the past." 
As part of the new pricing policy, students will now receive round-trip airfare for their destinations -which include over 20 countries worldwide -a benefit that, according to Douthwaite, vir­tually no other university supplies. 
Another main change to the study abroad pricing is an international study fee of $600 added on to the usual costs, which are equivalent to Notre Dame tuition, room, board and on-campus fees. 
"It's basically a way to even out the expenses of airfare around the world," Douthwaite said of the inter­national study fee. "There are places where it's maybe less than $600 to fly, but there are also places where it's at least three times $600 to fly." 
The Washington D.C. pro­gram is an exception to the fee, but airfare is not includ­ed in that study package. 
The other notable change is the elimination of facilitat­ed programs. In the past, some programs had been under the direction of other institutions, and did not always conform to Notre Dame budget pricing. The Santiago program, for exam­ple, had worked through the University of Wisconsin­Milwaukee, but now the pro­gram is better designed for Notre Dame students. 
"With the changes we've been able to make some quality improvements to some of the programs," Douthwaite said. 
According to Douthwaite, the OIS hopes to send 20 more "full time equivalents" abroad as a result of the new policy. In other words, 20 more students would be able to spend a full academic year abroad, or 40 students would be able to spend one semes­ter abroad. There will almost certainly be some mix between the two, making it impossible to foresee exactly how many more people will be able to go abroad as part of the new policy. 
"Sending more students is our first priority," Douthwaite said. 
One difficulty the OIS com­bats each year is the lack of application balance for fall versus spring semester. The overwhelming number of requests to study in spring is a problem OIS is working to solve. 
"If everyone applies to go in the spring we won't be able to send more students abroad," Douthwaite said. "We need to have consistency both semesters." 
Under the new policy, stu­dents will still receive Notre Dame credits and grades for courses they take abroad. 
Sophomore Brett Wilps, who hopes to study in Rome next year, said he sees the new policy as encouraging. 
"If they can enable more students to go abroad, that's definitely a positive," he said. "Obviously these programs are very popular so I'm glad to see that the University is supporting their growth." 
Wilps said the coverage of airfare more than makes up for the international study fee. 
"Six-hundred dollars seems more than· reasonable for round-trip tickets to Rome," he said. "If prices were always like that I think I'd go on more vacations."

"It's never too late to get that information ... there's no harm in doing it twice," Smith said. 
Smith also suggested placing posters in LaFortune, Coleman­Morse or Debartolo classroom building.

+ Senators unanimously approved a resolution calling for improvements to "technological deficiencies" that were reported in 17 of the University's 27 residence halls. 
Based on responses from hall councils and hall presidents, the Residence Life committee found problems with wireless Internet, cell phone reception and cable tele­vision in several residence halls. 
According to the survey, wireless Internet has encountered the most problems-with 16 dorms report­ing nonexistent, weak or inconsis­tent wireless signals. 
The resolution called for an addi­tional cell phone tower on the northeast side of campus, where cell phone service is the most unre­liable, Knapp said. The resolution also recommended "the installation of additional routers to compliment the current network" in halls such as Sorin, Siegfried, Zahm and Breen-Phillips, where wireless Internet was reportedly weakest. 
"If [OIT has] a better way of doing it, that's fine," Knapp said. "We just want the problems fixed."

Center

with Disabilities, located behind the Main Building next to St. Michael's laundry. The Javon and Vita Bea family underwrote the center and named it in memory of their daughter Sara, who died in 2003 after battling multiple dis­abilities throughout her life. 
The new space features eight testing rooms (two with com­puters and one with a video magnifier), a reception area, a social area and an oftice for the director. Scott Howland. Considering Howland was pre­viously wedged into the Alliance for Catholic Education's office in Badin Hall, where disabled students often sat seven or eight to a room to take tests, the new center is a "huge improvement," he said. 
''I'm thrilled with the new off1ce here. It adds so much," Howland said. "It's created a space students with disabilities can call their own." 
Or at least a room to call their own while they take a test. Test-taking accommoda­tions account for the majority of services offered by the cen­ter. Others include large print books, student readers/writ­ers/note-takers/lab assistants (about 35-40 students work at the Center, Howland said), sign­language interpreters, stenog­raphers and books on tape or CD. 
The variety of services reflects the different disabilities at Notre Dame. While about two-thirds of the 200 students using the Center have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or another learning disability, other disabilities range from visual or hearing impairments to physical dis­abilities like cerebral palsy to psychological issues that impact students academically. 
The majority of professors are understanding about stu­dents' different learning styles, Howland said, and First Year of Studies Advisor Mel Tardy agreed. 
"I have not found a faculty member who is not willing to be accommodating to the extent that they are able to do so and be fair," Tardy said, who is the FYS liaison to the Office for Students with Disabilities. 
"Before the office, having a disability here was a part-time job," he said. "Our mission is to meet students' needs so they can as much as possible be a college student." 
"Before the office" refers to before 1995, the year Howland was hired. Prior to that, the University had relied on its associate provost to provide services for disabled students. Associate Provost Father Timothy Scully decided to change that policy, Howland said. 
"[Scully] thought the University should have a per­son dedicated to students full time," Howland said. 
Along came Howland, who holds a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling from Bowling Green State University. While he is currently looking for a part-time administrative assistant, Howland has essen­tially run a one-man show since he was hired. Junior Jim Lockwood, who is visually­impaired, said he wouldn't take Howland's job "for anything in the world." 
"At times, it can be challeng­ing because so many things are going on at once," Howland said. "But ... I stilJ·get the opportunity to work directly and see them succeed and do well." 
Class of 1998 valedictorian Tim Cordes, who is blind, felt the effects of Howland's work when Howland arrived during his sophomore year. 
''I've got to give Scott tons of credit. Since showing up in '95, he's done a great job with the resources he has," Cordes said. ''I'm pleased to see he has more space and more opportunity to continue the good work he's been doing." 
Cordes called the center a "great asset" to the Notre Dame community of studnnts with disabilities. 
"I think it'll give them a place to sort of help build a commu­nity within themselves," he said. "And, it can snrve as a model for the rest of the Notre Dame students to see what's going on there, to learn from students and see how they're just like everybody else -they just have different challenges." 
Challenges that might be dif­ficult for not only the students with disabilities themselves, but for those around them, as well -and that's what students gathered to discuss Tuesday night. 
"I wish that I had known about you earlier" 
Just as a new location for dis­abled students is opening its doors, a group of students is opening the dialogue on dis­abilities at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
The newly-official student group Perspectives, which pro­vides a forum for students with disabilities and anyone inter­ested in discussing the topic, held its first meeting Tuesday in the social space of the Sara Bea Learning Center for Students with Disabilities. 
The group's purpose, accord­ing to its president Leslie Penko, has multiple levels: first, to provide a resouree for stu­dents with disabilities or those interested in learning about disabilities; second, to inerease awareness about disabled stu­dents and their needs in the community; and third, to edu­cate disabled students about how to deal with their disabili­ties on a daily basis. 
The first level is the reason Tardy founded the elub, he said. After listening to a discus­sion during Disability Awareness Month last spring, he found communication was lacking among students with disabilities. 
"It was obvious that people were talking to each other say­ing, 'I didn't know there was somebody else here who had the same situation as me. I wish that I had known about you earlier,"' he said. " ... The reason why [the club] is excit­ing is because there are over 200 people who use the [Office for Students with Disabilities] office, but most don't know each other." 
As it turned out, Tardy said, students weren't the only ones feeling isolated. 
"I had a lot of positive feed­back from faculty and adminis­trators who said they have a disability," Tardy said. "They said, 'I wish there was a group like this for us, as well."' 
Once they've found each other, the idea is for students with disabilities to share what's worked for them -ideally bal­ancing the scale between dis­abled students and their class­mates. 
"By learning different short­cuts," Penko said, "it really helps you get to the same level as your peers." 
Perspectives' second mission is to increasn awarnness and educate the community about students with disabilities. 
When Cordes arrived on earn­pus, there was no center, and there was no Scott Howland. 
"It seP.med like in many ways, faculty and folks wantnd to help. but they didn't necessarily know what to do," he said. "It was a learning process for all of us." 
Even faculty members who have taught students with dis­abilities might encounter a dis­ability they've never snnn, Tardy said. They might not under­stand. for example, how long a studPnt takes just to cumpl11te a homework assignment, he said. 
Understanding is just what Pnrspnetives hopes to accom­plish -while tlwy have differ­ent challengBs, disabled stu­dents are just like thnir peers, Pnnko said. 
"We all eat at the dining hall together and go to parties and do everything socially that other students would do," she said. 
But the social life at college can present problnms for stu­dents with disabilities, Tardy noted -like a student who age student just one, and has to refuse his friends' invitation to go out. 
"A lot of people don't appreci­ate that -people say you are being antisocial, but they either don't know they have a disabili­ty or they don't understand the full scope of what that means," he said. "This group will create more awareness about how much work is involved in stay­ing on top of elasses. being involved and having a disabili­ty." 
Penko said understanding will unite those with disabilities, and t.hose without. 
"Educating st.udPnts and other faculty as to how accommoda­tions can be made and how to treat students with disabilities like that ... that can really bridge that gap," she said. 
"Educating so they aren't afraid anymore" 
The final goal of Perspectives is to increase awareness among disabled students themselves. 
People ean be shy about hav­ing a disability for a numb11r of rnasons, Pnnko said. Some had dil'ficult experiences in grade recently and "are still process­ing the fact." 

"So they don't come forward and try to talk to other people, because they're still processing that themselves," he said. "That's why this club is going to be really helpful, to make people more comfortable opening up ... and finding out people are going through a lot of the same things they are." 
As much as Perspective aims to educate th1~ community, edu­eating students with disabilities -some of whom "are actually ashamed of their disabilities," Penko said -about interacting with the community is anotlwr primary goal. 
"We want to educate students with disabilities about how to be open and honest ... so they aren't afraid anymore," she said. "If we educate everyone, disability won't be as taboo, and people won't be ashamed. 
It'll help students with dis­abilities realize they're unique, but it's okay to be diiierent, and people will be understanding."

Six inmates escape from Texas jail 
LA VILLA, Texas -A former police officer about to face trial on drug charges and five alleged members of a violent drug gang over­powered a guard and cut through at least four fences to escape from a federal detention cen­ter near the Mexican border, officials said Wednesday. 
The six inmates, including a former Mt~Allen police officer and the alleged members of Haza Unida, fled the privately run facility late Tuesday, officials said. 
Investigators determined that the inmates overpowered a guard with a homemade knife, locked him in a room, made their way through several exit doors and used "some sort of wire cutter" to breach the fences, Hidalgo County Sherill" Lupe Trevino said in a statement. He said no alarm sounded and the guard was not hurt.

Chavez equates Bush to the devil 
Venezuelan leader charges U.S. with imposing own version ofdemocracy in Iraq 
Associated Press 
UNITED NATIONS Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called President Bush "the devil" in a speech to the United Nations on Wednesday, making the sign of the cross in a dramatic ges­ture and accusing him of "talking as if he owned the world." · 
The tiery speech by the leftist leader, one of Bush's staunchest critics abroad, was harsher in tone than that of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who sparred with Bush the previous day over Tehran's disputed nuclear program but avoided any personal insults. 
"Yesterday, the devil came here," Chavez said, refel'ring to Bush's address before the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday. "Right here. Hight here. And it smells of sulfur still today, this table that I am now stand­ing in front of."

tions, he said. 
Capt. Phil Trent, public informa­tion officer for the South Bend Police Department. said when offi­cers go to off-campus residences·, they want to speak to whoever is responsible -"that's primarily why they're there." SBPD officers enter off-campuses residences on a "ca<;e-by-case basis," he said. 
"Usually these things happen on weekends when we're busy with normal city activity," he said. "The officer wants to get in there, solve the problem and get out-whatev­er is most expedient." · 
Monterrosa said police have the right to ask for identification at any time. though force should only be necessary when the individual is resistant. 
"A lot of these cases are arrestable offenses -minor in consumption, minor in possession, public intoxication -and it's with­in the police officer's discretion to use handcuffs," he said. "Ifthe indi­vidual is cooperative or not that drunk, then in those situations the police will just give them a cita­tion." 
Leone said probable cause requires an individual to take a breathalyzer test "on the spot" when in a drinking environment, such as a party or tailgate. 
'That's been challenged and con­tested and everything else," she said. "You have to cooperate with the administrative process of the breathalyzer test because, at this point, that is the rule. It seems like an inherent admission of guilt, but the courts don't see it that way." 
Trent said SBPD officers adminis­ter breathalyzer tests when an individual "appears underage" or if he or she "appears to be under a level of intoxication where they are a danger to themselves." 
Leone said even students who are not drinking are still subject to take a breathalyzer test and com­ply with police officers while at off­campus parties or tailgates. There is a chance they can also receive citations for being part of a public nuisance, she said. 
Students of legal drinking age at off-campus parties or tailgates can only receive a misdemeanor charge for serving alcohol to a minor if the officer sees them com­nutting the act, Monterrosa said. 
The explanation provided by Indiana State Law, however, is somewhat grayer. According to the law. an individual who is 21 or older can receive an infraction if he or she "encourages, aids, or induces a minor to possess or use an alcoholic beverage." 
Trent said he would not give a citation for inducing unless he per­sonally saw an individual furnish alcohol to a minor or if he was cer­tain the individual was conducting the party. Police ntight learn who is responsible for the event thiough an online posting, he said. 
Monterrosa said some students feel like they are "stuck between a rock and a hard place" or "in a Catch-22" when dealing with the police. Bad things happen when students fail to cooperate, he said. 
"They key to this is not to be bel­ligerent with the police, not to say, "IIey, I'm a Notre Dame student, you can't do this to me," Monterrosa said. · 
Leone said students who think they are being targeted fail to rec­ognize that elected officials are under a lot of pressure to maintain a "good residential quality oflife" in South Bend. 
"I sense the attitude is, 'Oh. we're being picked on,"' she said. "You're hef!') to have a good time and relax but drinking has gotten to be a major problem. Don't have the atti­tude that it's a Gestapo kind of thing. 
"The police arc not there to pick on you. They're there because they have the laws to protect neighbor­hoods and, if someone calL<; in, the police officers have to respond." 

Student body president Lizzi Shappell said students must learn how to become full members of the South Bend community -from being better neighbors to following local laws and learning their right'>. It is important for students to understand the responsibilities that come with those rights without using them to "evade the law," she said. . 
"If students are aware of their rights as members of this commu-· nity, they should al<>o be aware of the expectations of them a<> mem­bers of this community," she said. 
Leone said otT-campus student<; should remember that they live within residential communities. 
''I'd recommend to keep it indoors and keep it low-key," she said. "It's not the fun way to go to school, but it's the responsible way to go to school." 
Both Leone and Monterrosa said students who receive citations or are arrested for offenses should always seck legal aid. 
"If the charge is a mbdemnanor, students can hire eouncil," Monterrosa said. "If they can't afford that, then they should ask for a publie defender. Under no cir­cumstanees should student<; try to handle it on their own." 
Monterrosa said there aro oppor­tunities for individuals to resolve cases without pleading guilty. 
"If it's a mi'idemeanor, it goes on your reeord forever, so you want to make sure you avoid that first eon­vietion -or any conviction," he said. 
Monterrosa said one way stu­dents can avoid eonvic_tion is through the St. Joseph County pre­trial diversion program. Established by the Prosecutor's Offiee, the program seeks to work with individuals with little or no criminal background who have been charged with a misdemeanor. 
Cases of those aeeepted into the pro~-,rram "will be dismiss<~d after a period of onP year -mPaning, no eonviction -as long as the requirements and eonditions of [thel specific agreement have been fulfillPd," according to the St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office Website. 
The program costs $315, whieh indudes a $170 user fee and $145 in court eosts. Monterrosa said the program is generally available to individuals if they are first-time offenders. Some erin1es, like OWl and marijuana possession, do not fall within the statutes of the pre­trial diversion program, he said. 

"One advice i<> that it's not auto­matie and it does depend on the cireumstanees," Leone said. "Sometimes you wind up with two. three or four charges based on one incident. ... [But] nine times out of 10 they'll allow the individual to have a pre-trial diversion." 
Leone said the pre-trial diversion program is valuable to students who worry about the ramifications of being charged with a misde­meanor. The program does not "hamper pre-med or pre-law stu­dent<;," she said.

IN BRIEF 


Tax incentives decrease for Hybrids 
WASHINGTON -Tax incentives for environ­mentally concerned drivers shopping for cer­tain energy-efficient hybrids will soon start disappearing like autumn leaves. 
The Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday its tax collectors have been told that Toyota Motor Corp. this summer hit the legal production limit -60,000 vehicles ­that Congress imposed on vehicles eligible for a tax credit. 
The announcement means that federal tax credits for Toyota and Lexus hybrid vehicles will be cut in half beginning in October, the IRS said. 
The $3,150 credit for the popular Toyota Prius, the largest hybrid tax credit available, will shrink to $1,575 on Oct 1. 
Credits for other hybrids manufactured by Toyota, including certain Camry, Highlander and Lexus vehicles, will shrink to between $775 to $1,300. 

Boeing awarded $80 million contract 
WASHINGTON -Boeing Co. will be awarded an $80 million government contract to provide new high-tech ways to catch illegal immigrants trying to cross U.S. land borders, officials said Wednesday. 
The contract is the first part of a multibillion­dollar Homeland Security Department plan to help secure the Mexican and Canadian borders. The final bill's total is unknown, a department official said, because it hinges largely on whether Congress will approve spending about $1 billion to build a fence on the Mexican bor­der. Until then, the contract will be given to Boeing in phases, the department official said. 
The Boeing contract was expected to be announced Thursday, according to a congres­sional aide and an official of the agency who spoke on condition of anonymity because the department had not yet made its announce­ment. 
Homeland Security Department spokesman .Jarrod Agen would not comment. "Legally we are restricted from discussing details of the contract until the award is officially announced," Agen said Wednesday. 
Boeing spokesman Dan Beck also declined to comment pending a formal announcement from the government. 


Economic talks begin in China 
U.S. Treasury Secretary and Chinese Vice Premier discuss trade relations 
Associated Press 
BEIJING -The United States and China are launching a new high-level economic dialogue meant to repair relations soured by trade tensions, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and a Chinese leader said Wednesday. 
The strategic dialogue will deal with long-range and big-picture issues that affect the U.S. and China, Paulson and Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi said in announcing the arrangement on the first day of Paulson's visit to Beijing. 
Relations between the countries, once buoyed by robust trade, have deterio­rated in recent years as China's trade surplus rock­ets ever higher and critics in Washington have accused Beijing of keeping the cur­rency undervalued to make Chinese exports cheaper. Washington also wants Chinese help in restarting suspended world trade talks. 
Neither Paulson nor Wu said whether the currency or the trade imbalance would be addressed in the dialogue. But Paulson sug­gested that it should put eco­nomic relations in a new perspective. 

"As global economic lead­ers, we share responsibility to maintain open markets at Though making his first many interests we share, competitors "wholly under­home and promote free and trip as treasury secretary, and I've also learned that mines China's stated aim of fair trade in all countries," Paulson has visited China some of the tensions that creating a 'level playing Paulson told reporters in dozens of times as chairman exist are also important and field' for news media in Beijing's Great Hall of the of the investment bank that it's very important that China," the American People.

So, we lost last weekend. Bummer. There are other things that are bum­mers, too. In fact, some of these bum­mers also occur in the football stadi­um, but they have little to do with foot­ball. Like when a bunch of drunken guys, celebrating in raucous Dionysian manner, stumble into the student section and do their best to make sure the words most closely associated with the Notre Dame student sec­tion are "drunk," "stupid" and "annoying." 
Thankfully, there is somebody who stands bravely against the smashed stupidity of these game-spoiling drunkards. More than one somebody. I'm referring, of course, to the Notre Dame Stadium ushers. 
I know some students have a less­than-amicable view of these stadium attendants. They see the ushers as harbingers of terror, roaming around the stadium with sinister intent, ready to swoop down and strike furious vengeance on any helpless student who just wants to partake in a few pre-game, during-the-game and post­game festivities. Titans of terror. Golden-coated curtailers of freedom. Big Brother, watching your every move. These yellow-jacketed storm troopers of doom represent the hypocrisy of this University's fascist regime. Or conversely, some of Our Lady's loyal sons and daughters think· those bumbling old bearded men are bitter, sad fools whose sole enjoyment left is to hang around the football sta­dium and catch a free viewing of the game. Heck, they probably even went to Boston College. 
Not so, my friends, not so. Well, I can't say for sure about the Boston 

James Dechant 
Foregone Conclusion 

College part, but I can assure you the rest of that caricature is more grotesquely inaccurate than the aver­age Notre Dame student was ham­mered after last weekend's loss. It turns out these ushers are anything but sinister, sad, bitter or vengeful. In reality, these dedicated men and women are one of the primary reasons a game at Notre Dame Stadium is a unique experience. 
Even before the Stadium ever opens, these faithful shepherds are helpful sources of information, poster-boy (and girl) advocates for the University, dedicated to their jobs. We (hopefully) don't have to ask directions to the Stadium, but for thousands of visitors to campus, the ushers are always there to sagely guide them to the sacred grounds of Notre Dame foot­ball. You can see them every home football Saturday before the game, grabbing a hot dog or steak sandwich on the way to the Stadium (and sup­porting student groups, I might add). They'll be happy to give directions, lend a hand, and even join in the spon­taneous student cheers across campus. 
And that's hours before kickoff. When game time actually nears, these ushers are swarming all over the place, guiding frail old alumni, con­fused visiting fans and disoriented stu­dents to their appropriate sections. Supposedly, Notre Dame has about twice as many ushers as most other college stadiums. This dedication to providing a good time translates into an enjoyable experience for all fans and students at the games. Any time some idiot in the stands breaks open a beer can over his head, tries to drunk­enly crawl over the railing to a closer tunnel exit, or shouts violent ethnic slurs at opposing teams' fans, an usher is somewhere nearby to help defuse the situation and remind everybody to keep calm and enjoy the game. 
These ushers do not abuse their authority or try to "ruin the fun." I have never seen an usher in any way 
overstep his or her bounds or go after 
a student with malignant intent. They 
are always there to hand out high­
fives and a "Go Irish!" on your way to 
sit down, to protect kids from their 
bumbling drunken selves when they 
try to do push-ups and to kindly 
remove inebriated imbeciles from the 
stands -for which I am thankful. 
And how do we repay these dedicat­ed men and women'? By leaving dirty beer cans in the stands, feeling clever when we sneak out over a railing, and whining when our God-given marsh­mallow throwing privileges are called into question (let's not bring up that dispute again). Not all students are like this, by any means, but more of this goes on than the ushers really deserve. 
The next time you're in the Stadium, make a point to thank your usher for all his or her service, because we are the ones that benefit from their hard work. Some of them do it for a week­end job. Some do it because they love Notre Dame football. Some do it because they enjoy the dedicated fans and the experience or helping them out. Almost all of them enjoy being around the energetic crowd sections of a game. No matter what their reasons, none of them are the hell-bent author­ity demons students sometimes make them out to be. All of them are helpful, informative, and just fun to spend a game with. They are all valuable mem­bers of the Notre Dame community and the Notre Dame experience.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The unpopular topic of overpopulation 
As a counter-response to the bevy of attacks on Liz Coffey's Sept. 14 column "Big families equals big trou­ble." I wish to correct the numerous conceptual and factual inaccuracies put forth as rebuttal to her funda­mentally sound, if somewhat overstated argument. 
Tim Wymore makes the assertion that "while natural resources are finite, our ability to manipulate them with ever-increasing efficiency is not." I would point out that the concept of a system with a continually increas­ing efficiency of output is dependent upon the theoreti­cally finite limit to efficiency and that continual opti­mization steps become probabilistically more and more infrequent as that limit is approached. This nuance aside, in terms of sustainability the question remains: · can humanity limit its energetic consumption on a daily basis to the energetic input in terms of primary solar radiance for that day? 
We are currently consuming bio-solar energy stored over the millennia as fossil fuels far above any sustain­able level and in the process liberating vast quantities of sequestered carbon into the atmosphere and con­tributing to anthropogenic global climate changes. Additionally, Wymore's reference to the "tremendous improvements in farming techniques" needs to be high­ly qualified. With the advent of the Haber-Bosch process for the fixation of nitrogen in 1908, Malthus' predictions for the time-course of resource limitation and population crisis turned out to be inaccurate, although not altogether un-instructive. The application of industrial fertilizer has led to significantly higher crop yields and enabled the population explosion but it has also resulted in profound global nutrient pollution, such as the annual hypoxic "dead zone" the size of Texas in the Gulf of Mexico. This is a direct result of irresponsible farming practices in the Mississippi Basin in the strained effort to feed such a burgeoning popula­tion. When Wymore makes the claim that the human population has never been better fed, he is certainly speaking in terms of percentages and not in terms of actual numbers of those underfed, a claim ironically penned on a day coincident with the University's forum on world health issues. 
Gardener's claim that a reduced population growth in North American and Europe is tantamount to a "civi­lizational suicide" of the West is absurd. If only it were true then perhaps the at times unrealistic standard of living set by American families wishing to live in gated communities of gigantic houses over an hour's com­mute by SUV away from their work would not be a global standard for emulation. Maintaining a zero pop­ulation growth at the already high current population is truly the only responsible action. Given the pre-repro­duction age mortality rate, this translates into a replacement rate of 2.3 offspring for every couple. 
Certainly Falvey is correct when he states that the danger of human extinction is not imminent, highlight­ing an over-dramatization in Coffey's article; however, responding to a misunderstood statement of hers (I'm sure that Coffey supports the concept of large adopted families) with an emotionally charged insult of his own is unproductive at best. 
The conceptually suspect yet pervasively held ideal of an ever-expanding economy is one of the primary moti­vators for a growing population. On the supply side it keeps labor costs down, which from the perspective of the American laborer has led to unremitting outsourc­ing of jobs to Asia. As an ironic example of this, China has recently relaxed its population control measures in order to lower rising labor costs which are due to their aging population bubble. Additionally, as a population continually grows, so does its consumption capacity and thereby its demand for goods. One way to look at the increase in the American per capita consumption is to recognize that perhaps the largest concrete American exportis the dollar, as evinced by the trillions of U.S. dollars currently held by the Asian Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China. Broadly, this dynamic is driven by aspirations for the accumulation of private wealth more than an interest in the public good or a sustainable global economy and population. 
If anyone is confused as to the impacts of the growing human population and its sustainability, I refer them to the writings of Paul R. Ehrlich, the Nobel Prize-winning ecologist from Stanford University who lectured on campus last semester on the topic of human over-popu­lation, or to the writings of Edward 0. Wilson, the famous biologist from Harvard, such as 'The Future of Life.' These highly regarded scientists use concrete sci­entific data to ~how that a large portion of the chal­lenges facing our planet and the people that live on it can be drawn back to the fundamental issues of over­population and poor resource management. The topic of over-population is never an easy topic to broach, yet this comes in part from its imperative. I would ask, at what point do we expect to reach a steady state of pop­ulation, production and consumption in which an acceptable standard of living for all can include a har­monic preservation of the planet's irreplaceable natural resources? The first step is dispelling uninformed opin­ions and misinformation.

Support the team, or hold out for a win? 
Stayingfor. the 
Alma Mater 
isn't enough 
There has been much discussion about the enthusiasm (or lack there oO of the senior section in last Saturday's game against Michigan. Being .a senior myself, I was in that section and I have to say that I agree with the fact that the level of enthusiasm was greatly disappointing. While I'll admit that the vast majority of seniors stayed until the end to sing the Alma Mater and this displayed awesome "school spirit," there is no doubt in my mind that the senior section was upstaged by the sophomores and freshmen. It was lackluster; the seniors may have been present but they weren't making any noise! 
One only has to look as far back as two weeks to the Georgia Tech game to understand that home field advantage can be a major factor in a game if the fans enthusiastically support their team. Georgia Tech, an unranked team, had national championship contenders thinking twice about how good they were; this was because their fans and their team had us undoubtedly rattled. Now, think back to last Saturday where the sup­port, in general was disappointing; in my opinion this was largely (but not solely) due to the lack of senior leadership. 
When people say that Notre Dame Stadium is not an intimidating place to play football, it aggravates me but I have to agree with them. On Saturday I felt ashamed to be a senior. I wanted to go to the sophomore section ­all I heard was background chatter criticizing the team; no support and no noise. 
Seniors, on Sept. 30 against Purdue, ifyou're not going to turn up and make some noise then please sell your ticket to someone who will-you might as well watch it on TV. Feel free, if you want, to sing the Alma Mater at the end of the game with the people you're watching it with at home.

Football is about victories 

Over the last few days, several students have written to The Observer expressing their disap­p.ointment in the student section's behavior at the Michigan game. We share this disappointment. We are disappointed that the student section blindly cheers on the football team regardless of what is happening on the field. We were some of the sen­iors that left early and are some of the most fer­vent Notre Dame fans in the world.. We could no longer stand to watch our beloved squad being dragged all over the field. We follow our team all year, give 100 percent at every home game and travel to several away games to cheer our team "onward to victory". We don't simply go to have fun, hear the band play and partake in tradition. Winning is what football is all about. Winning is fun. And winning, at Notre Dame is tradition. We wear "The Shirt" proudly with "TRADITION" across our chests. There are a few coaches miss­ing from the back of that shirt -Gerry Faust, Bob Davie and Ty Willingham -coaches who did not uphold the tradition of winning. 
Notre Dame is the nation's most followed foot­ball team not because of golden helmets or a great fight song, but because we have traditionally been the best team in the land. Whenever we lose as badly as we did Saturday, we violate that tradi­tion. We have all witnessed some "untraditionally" bad losses throughout our time at Notre Dame. We were all at the 37-0 Florida State thrashing fresh­man year. We all walked out early. Not a single one of us regrets doing so. We were embarrassed that the tradition of Notre Dame Football was not upheld on the field. We were embarrassed on Saturday, and we know the players felt the same way. 
The way we love Notre Dame Football is very similar to the way many of our parents love us. If one of us were ever to come home with a report card littered with Fs, our pa.rents would not applaud our failures and do a jig around the house. We will not stay and cheer with smiling faces during a beat-down. We need to remember that 80,000 people pack N·otre Dame Stadium every week to watch their team win. Winning is what football is all about. Ask Charlie Weis.

CD REVIEWS 
Lostprophets mesh genres.in 'Transmission' 
By ANALISE LIPARI 
Assistant Scene Editor 
In their latest release, Welsh rockers Lostprophets have evolved their sound from heavy metal to referential alterna­tive. "Liberation Transmission," the band's third studio album, calls to mind shades of Duran Duran, the Clash, and even Fall Out Boy in it's most accessible release yet. · 
Consisting of Ian Watkins, Jamie Oliver, Lee Gaze, Mike Lewis and Stuart Richardson, Lostprophets have made a conscious effort in their latest release to get back to their roots. 
"From our parents, we grew up on pop music, but we were also into Metallica and Megadeth, and when you're 19 years old all you want to do is play heavy stuff, and that's easier to do as well," Watkins said in a recent interview with MTV.com. 
"But this time we decided to strip some of the stuff down and let the songs really stand out. It's not all about thrashy riffs anymore, it's about taking elements from the stuff "Ye listened to growing up and using that to make better songs," Watkins continued. 
Already having debuted at No. 1 in the UK, "Liberation Transmission" was released on Sept. 11 in the United States and debuted at No. 33 on the Billboard charts. 
The opening track, "Everyday Combat," is among the most metal­sounding of the songs, and acts as a bridge for their older fans into their developing sound. With strong vocals, heavy percussion and a repetitive chorus, "Combat" harkens back to their earlier days in a way that leaves room for the changes to come. 
Beginning with the second track, "A Town Called Hypocrisy," Lostprophets · demonstrate their new musicology. Calling to mind thoughts of the brand of punk found in bands like The Clash, "Hypocrisy" blends the sensibilities of more modern emo-type rockers like Fall Out Boy with an appreciation for glossier acts like Franz Ferdinand, leav­ing both old and new fans of the Welsh band with little to fault. 
This trend in musical blending and less metal, a little more pop, and in a way that stays true to the essence of their sound. 


Other standout tracks include "Can't Stop, Cotta Date With Hate," whose hook and lyrics are so addictive that they war­rant multiple listens immediately, "Everybody's Screaming!!!," a solid rock track with hints of the Arctic Monkeys blended with smoother vocals, and "4:AM Forever," a subtle reflection in the vein of an Incubus-type sound. 
"Always All Ways," the album's flnal track, represents the sum of their musi­cal evolution, as it's the most glaringly difl"erent from "Everyday Combat." It's as though the band has tracked their evolu­tion through the progress of the album, and closing on "Always All Ways" lends the band both a speculative ballad and a unique finale. 
There are occasional moments where their genre-bending gets somewhat messy. While the band is generally suc­cessful in finding a hybrid between the metal of their past and the pop-alterna­tive of their future, occasional metal moments on certain tracks seem a bit out of place. Finding fault with these moments, however, is more nitpicking than a real criticism. 
On the whole, their sound is strong and consistently unique in their history.

Hopeful Nevertheless struggles on debut album 
By MARTY SCHROEDER 
Assistant Scene Editor 
There was a train of cookie cutter pop-punk that stormed through the highways of musicdom in the early 2000s -Nevertheless missed the train and hopped on the midnight bus. 
If only they had never gotten on. 
Their debut album, "Live Like We're Alive," is perfect example of post-pop­punk rock, which is to say, not very good. The lyrics are chock full of emo­tion to the point of bored tears, the guitars want to crunch but the veneer of the production is like a delicious cake with horrible frosting -bringing complete ruination to something that could have been good. 
The singer attempts to move through a range that he doesn't come close to possessing. With only a few tracks which come close to something decent, this album is a death knell for a band just getting off the ground. 
From Chattanooga, Tenn., Nevertheless claims that the purpose of their band is hope. On their website, 
frontman Josh Pearson says, "These aren't just songs to soothe breakup sores or feed the fires of crushes; they are also songs to mend deeper wounds." 
He is referring here to the spiritual side of Nevertheless' lyrics. Taking a note from such bands as Helient K and some early MxPx, Nevertheless includes references to their faith in God and how they bring that to the rest of their lives. This is all well and good. Many people immediately discredit a band that has religious overtones in their lyrics, but it can be done well. 
The ska band Five Iron Frenzy was a perfect example of how religion and alternative music can meld into a very entertaining, thought provoking and cohesive whole. However, Nevertheless has none of these qualities. The lyrics are simple, there is very little diversity in their sound, and the excessive lay­ers of polish they put on this album saps out any innate creativity the members of this quintet have. 
One of the problems with this album arises from the song writing. Kevin Kadish, who has written with and/or 


for Rob Thomas and Jason Mraz,Nevertheless 
helped write sev­eral of the tracks. Live Like We're Alive When bands bring in people to help Flicker Records write the lyrics, the slope becomes very slippery. Instead of the lyrics they want, many of the songs
Recommended tracks: 'The Real/ 'Losing Innocence/ sound like poppy flotsam and jet-
and 'Live LikeWe're Alive' 
sam that needs 

sifting through to flnd where the band is in this album. 
All this aside, there are a eouple of tr.acks that show signs of potential for its second album. The first track, "The Real," is one of the songs where any semblance or punk comes through. This isn't to say it is a punk song-it isn't, but the guitars are allowed to run free a bit more than in the rest of the tracks giving it a bit more of the dynamism that the other tracks lack. 
"Lover" is probably the worst track merely because it tries too hard to be deep and meaningful. The lyrics mean well -but St. Paul did it better 2000 years ago -and the music is bloated. A piano is used which the song could do without, while Pearson's vocals are too "little boy" sounding with no emo­tional rawness. 

On their website, the band elaims that the key word for this album is hope. However, the hope they're talk­ing about is not the same kind most people will have when they listen to this album -hope that the next one is better. 
Nevertheless needs to head back to the drawing board, strip down their music and then they might have some­thing that resembles real emotion and music.

Chipotle comes to town, with free burritos 

Restaurant praised for its all-around sophistication 
Photo courtesy of chipotle Chipotle founder Steve Ells wanted to create a franchise where the focus was not only fast food, but also fresh ingredients and an inviting atmosphere. 
By MARTY SCHROEDER 
Assistant Scene Edimr 
Everyone knows about Chipotle and everyone knows that one is gging t(l open on Main St. this Friday. However, not every­one may know that the founder, Steve Ells, is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and New York University. The beginnings of Chipotle are the stuff that dreams are made of ....,--fast-food dreams anyway. Offering high quality food in a hip environment quickly and inexpensively, Chipotle has raised the bar in terms of what American fast food should be. 
Chipotle first opened it<> doors in Denver, Col. in 1993. This may not have been the first restaurant to market the idea, but it was the first to open to floodgate on the concept "quick gourmet." 
Ells, a classically trained chef, shifted the focus of fast food from lightening speed to fresh ingredients -nothing frozen or processed, food made in front of the cus­tomer and a simple, yet highly modifiable, menu. The effort to bring freshness to the world at large in the· form of a huge burrito is paying off in spades. By 2003, Ells had gone from one restaurant to over 450 in 21 states. 
Focusing on sophistication, a discerning taste and environmental awareness, Ells has tapped into the American conscious­ness. The restauran_ts themselves, while no two are the same, focus on what has been called "cantina moderne." Burnished steel, wood, unadorned light fixtures and general cleanliness are the marks of the Chipotle restaurants. This is not the Taco Bell that was built in two days and is never cleaned -this is a restaurant that takes pride in the food it serves and how it is served to the customer. 
Not only is the interior of the store detailed and unique, but the sources through which Chipotle obtains their meat products is focused on an attitude that takes the environment very seriously. Eyery batch of carnitas pork is from a small fami­ly farm, which practices humane animal husbandry and farming techniques not harmful to the environment. There are now more than 220 family farms allowing their porcine livestock to roam, root and follow natural instincts while eating a vege­tarian diet of grains and grasses. Sows are allowed to make pens themselves and no hormones or antibiotics are used. Also, their waste is reused to fertilize crops instead of becoming environmental toxins. 
In response to this, environmental groups, such as the Animal Welfare Institute based in Washington, D.C., has given credibility to methods used by the farms, which supply Chipotle its pork. Alongside its pork, Chipotle has been trying to do the same with its chicken and beef. Over half of the chicken and a third of the beef comes from naturally raised environ­ments and Chipotle is trying to get those numbers higher. 
All this talk about meat has left out a sig­nificant portion of America -vegetarians. Chipotle has an answer for this. Ells recog­nized that many restaurants would tout a By SEAN SWEANY 
Assistant Scene Editor 
The choices are simple. Fajita or burri­to? Black beans or pinto? Chicken, steak or carnitas? Hot, medium or mild salsa? Sour cream, cheese or lettuce? Perhaps a splash of guacamole for extra flavor? 
The result is delicious. A personalized, mouthwatering Chipotle creation made from fresh ingredients right in front of your eyes. For those who have enjoyed Chipotle food before, a description and thoughts of such a meal may cause a rumbling in the stomach. For ·others who have not experienced the joy of a Chipotle meal, this may sound like unnecessary hype and praise for such a seemingly simple thing as a burrito. 
With the opening of South Bend's first Chipotle, however, the uninitiated need remain that way no longer. Access to what the company itself calls,. "A com­plete, four-course meal in a handy tor­tilla carrying pouch" is now available to all who can ferry themselves out to Grape Road. 
The success of Chipotle took some by surprise, but has most certainly not gone unnoticed. Conceived as a more casual fast-food establishment than a McDonalds or Burger King, Chipotle has enjoyed wild success in its meteoric rise as a prominent restaurant chain. Other competitors including Wendy's and other smaller corporations have launched com­peting chains like Qdoba and Baja Fresh to capitalize on the Chipotle phenome­non. 
The secret to Chipotle's success, how­ever, is quite simple. As soon as diners walk in the door, they know that they will receive fresh, quality food with no frills, obnoxious advertising or grotesque pic­tures of clowns or other cartoon charac­ters everywhere. Rather, the setting is trendy and varied, eclectic music tracks set a mood conducive to relaxation and peaceful dining. 
The food itself is the true gem of the restaurant and the one-pound Jmrritos make a perfect meal for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Many people like senior Tim Wyne feel the key to Chipotle lies in one thing. 
"The guacamole," Wyne said. "You can tell it's not been in the store for months like other Mexican restaurants." 
Chipotle's guacamole is famous and hand made several times daily at each Chipotle location. 
While the guacamole is excellent, the attention and care that Chipotle employ­ees lavish on the other ingredients such as marinated chicken and slow roasted pork are equally as good. Various types of salsa -from mild to very hot -gar­nish each creation with a mouth-water­ing, eye-watering taste that gives one the "symphony orchestra in your mouth" feeling after every bite. It is this great taste present in every menu item that keeps customers coming back for more. 
Notre Dame students have been eager­ly awaiting the grand opening of the South Bend Chipotle, especially since free burritos are being given away today. Senior Irish swimmer Julia Quinn said, "My teammates and I are immediately going to Chipotle after practice today." Students hoping for a free burrito can expect long lines considering the popu­larity of the restaurant chain among the girl's swim team and many other people at Notre Dame. 
Sophomore Anthony Ashley has never been to a Chipotle. However, upon hear­ing about the restaurant and today's giveaways indicated he would like to give Chipotle a try. ' 
"Free burritos and spicy goodness sounds good to me," Ashley said. 
As the Chipotle craze sweeps campus, others who have not experienced the sensation will no doubt be joining the bandwagon along with Ashley. 
This is perhaps one of the key charac­teristics that Chipotle imparts to its cus­tomers. The sense of belonging to a select "club" of people who have had the pleasure of enjoying a Chipotle burrito at least once is a special feeling and allows people to share their experience with others. Thankfully, this club is not exclu­sive, but rather welcomes all who are willing to give their taste buds a workout. And for today, at least, membership is free.

certain dish as vegetarian when in fact it contained hidden animal products. Chipotle does not include any hidden ingredients and, as said before, the product is made in front of the consumer. The tortillas are made with vegetable oil instead of lard and the rice and beans have no animal prod­ucts used during their preparation. Take these three ingredients and add a vegetari­an salsa for a wholesome and filling vege­tarian meal. · 
The Chipotle opening soon will be a wel­come addition to the South Bend area. It brings high quality food without leaving a large dent in your wallet. Customers can also sleep soundly knowing that the food they get was prepared without hidden ingredients and, for the most part, pro­cured from places where environmentally sound farming is practiced. Sophistication, great tastes and social consciousness are the trademarks of this new brand of American fast food.

Rocket wins No. 348 in last home start this year 
Wigginton's two-run homer in the eighth lifts Tampa Bay over Baltimore to end Rays' nine-game losing streak 
Associated Press 
HOUSTON -The Houston Astros' fans gave Roger Clemens a warm send-off after the Rocket delivered one more performance to remember. 
Clemens pitched six scoreless innings in his final home start of the season for win No. 348 to lead the Houston Astros to a 7-2 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday. 
The 44-year-old Clemens will have two more scheduled starts this season -and possibly for­ever -at Philadelphia on Monday and at Atlanta on Sept. 30. 
Clemens won't say what he'll do beyond that. 
"It's definitely a challenge physically and mentally every year," he said. "If I commit to come back and play, I want to be able to perform. 
"I don't know what tomorrow brings -but if this is it, I've really enjoyed it." 
The seven-time Cy Young win­ner is sure about one thing -if he ever starts to feel like he can no longer dominate, that's when he'll retire for good. 
"I can't handle being aver­age," said Clemens, who low­ered his 2006 ERA to 2.37. "I guess there's a time when you know and I thought that was three years ago. But I had to come back and really challenge myself to get it done." 
Luke Scott had a three-run triple and a solo homer and Craig Biggio hit a three-run homer as the Astros won for just the third time in 10 games, a slide that has left them with fading hopes in the wild-card race. The Astros were 6 1/2 games behind the wild-card leaders coming into the game. 
. Clemens (7-5) struck out six and allowed three hits with three walks. He did not yield an earned run for the fourth time this season and allowed fewer than three for the 15th time in 17 starts. 
Before he threw his first pitch, catcher Brad Ausmus met him at the mound and thanked him for a memorable 2 1/2 sea­sons with the Astros. 
"I personally hope that it isn't it," Ausmus said, "but catching Roger has been a highlight of my career. He's the ultimately prepared professional and cer­tainly a first-ballot Hall of Farner." 
Clemens walked out for the seventh, but Astros manager Phil Garner came out before he threw a pitch and replaced him with Russ Springer. 
The fans stood for a roaring ovation and Clemens tipped his ­cap as he walked off the field. 
"He wasn't going to pitch any­more," Garner said, "but the way things played out, every­thing came together for that moment. The fans' reaction was unbelievable and Roger's reac­tion to that was just as special." 
The cheering continued and Clemens came out for a curtain call, shirt untucked, pumping his fist in the air before disap­pearing into the dugout. 
"That's what it's been about since I've been home," he said. "Obviously, winning and making 
it enjoyable for our fans at home." 
Reds starter Bronson Arroyo (14-10) lost for first time in five starts, giving up seven hits and striking out four in 5 1-3 innings. 
The Reds have also slipped from view in the wild-card race, entering the day five behind the leader. 
San Francisco 7, Colorado 4 

Barry Bonds' pinch hit, run­scoring single in the eighth broke a tie game and helped San Francisco snap a four-game losing streak during a win over the Colorado Rockies on Wednesday. 
The Giants entered Wednesday's contest trailing San Diego by five games in the NL West and Los Angeles by 4 1/2 games in the wild-card race. They had lost six of their last eight. 
The Giants entered the eighth trailing 3-2, but scored five times on six hits off four differ­ent Colorado pitchers. 
Ray Durham's double scored Todd Linden to tie the game and Bonds' single brought home pinch-runner Fred Lewis. Durham was thrown out at the plate on the play by Brad Hawpe. 
Todd Greene followed with a two-run triple off the wall and then scored on Moises Alou's double. 
Brian Wilson (2-3) got the win and Manuel Corpas, who hadn't given up a run in his last eight outings, took the loss. Corpas (1-2) gave up three runs with-out recording an out. 


Mike Stanton worked the ninth the ninth for his eighth sa.ve in 10 chances with the Giants, getting a double play with two on base to end it. 
Jason Schmidt, who skipped his start last Friday due to tightness in his lower back, tied a season-high with seven walks. He was pulled after walking 
J.D. Closser following Hawpe's triple. Brad Hennessey got Clint Barmes to ground out to end the inning. 
Colorado added a run in the bottom of the eighth after Cory Sullivan drove in Jeff Salazar with a double. 

Tampa Bay 4, Baltimore 2 
Ty Wigginton helped Tampa Bay snap a season-high, nine­game losing streak Wednesday, hitting a tiebreaking two-run homer in the eighth inning in the Devil Hays' win over the Baltimore Orioles. 
Greg Norton drew a one-out walk off Hodrigo Lopez (9-17) before Wigginton made it 4-2 with his 21st homer -the 16th that has either tied a game or put Tampa Bay ahead. 
Seth McClung (6-12) pitched 1 1-3 innings for the win. 
Chris Gomez pulled the· Orioles even at 2 in the top of the eighth with an RBI single off Jae Seo. The Tampa Bay starter, who allowed two runs and seven hits in 7 2-3 innings, is 0­1 with seven no decisions in eight starts since July 29. 
Wigginton and Jorge Cantu opened the seventh with singles off Hayden Penn, who had gave up one run and one hit through six innings. After Kevin Witt struck out, Dioner Navarro sin­gled to load the bases. 
Tomas Perez, mired in a 9­for-62 slide, popped out for the second out. 
Baldelli then gave the Devil Rays a 2-1 lead on an infield single that werit off the glove of a diving Gomez at third. Lopez, the major league loss leader, replaced Penn and got an inning-ending grounder from Delmon Young to keep Baltimore within one run. 
Penn gave up two runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings. He had allowed 22 runs and 24 hits over 7 1-3 innings in his previ­ous three starts this season. Th~ right-hander's longest out­ing during that stretch was 3 2­3 innings. 
Carl Crawford got the Devil Rays' first hit, a homer with one out in the fourth that tied it at 
1. Corey Patterson tripled and scored on David Newhan's sa.c­rifice fly to put the Orioles up 1­0 in the third.

Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH -A second man charged in a shooting that wounded five Duquesne University basketball play­ers turned himself in Wednesday, police said . 
William Holmes, 18, of the Pittsburgh suburb of Penn Hills, was to be arraigned on charges of attempted homicide, aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy and weapons-related offens­es. 
Holmes is the third person arrested in Sunday's shoot­ing after a dance at the pri­vate, Roman Catholic uni­versity. Two of the wounded players remained hospital­ized. 

The other 18-year-old accused of shooting the players, Brandon Baynes, was jailed Tuesday on simi­lar charges. Neither of the teens is a Duquesne student. 
Baynes and Holmes crashed a campus dance sponsored by the Black Student Union where they encountered the basketball players, acconling to police. They and two friends got into the dance with help from a student who is active with the union, police said. 
The student, Brittany Jones, 19, was arrested Monday on charges of reck­less endangerment, carrying a firearm without a license and criminal conspiracy. She was arraigned and 
IN BRIEF 
Embattled referee takes 
year off after blowing call 
WALNUT CREEK, Calif. -The instant replay oflicial whose failure to overturn a bad call helped Oregon beat Oklahoma has been granted a leave of absence for the remainder of the football season by the Pac-1 0. 
The league announced Wednesday that official Gordon Riese, who has already been suspended for a game by the Pac-1 0, requested a leave of absence. 
Because Pac-1 0 replay officials work in crews, replay assistant Roger Judd also will not work any more games this season. 
"Gordon Riese had a distinguished 28-year career as a Pac-10 official and, with the exception of Saturday, had done a fine job as a replay offi­cial," Pac-1 0 commissioner Tom Hansen said. "He is an individual with impeccable ofliciating credentials and unquestioned integrity. We look for­ward to his return next season." 
posted bond Tuesday morn­ing. On Wednesday, Duquesne announced she had been suspended for multiple violations of the student code. 
The shootings took place shortly after the dance ended when, according to Associated Press interviews with two players, several non-students apparently became upset when Jones began flirting with one of the players. 
Attorney Giuseppe G.C. Rosselli, whose firm repre­sents Holmes, said the shooting was "just a bad sit­uation every way around." 
"When it's all said and done, our client will be found not guilty," he said. 

Red Raiders coach questions 
players' hearts, desire 
DES MOINES -Texas Tech coach Mike Leach ripped into his players fol­lowing a 12-3 loss at TCU last week, blaming the defeat on what he said were "prima donnas" who have gone "soft." 
Texas Tech, which scored at least 50 points five times last season, didn't score a touchdown for the first time in six years. What has Leach most concerned is that many of the players who he said didn't put forth the effort needed against the Horned Frogs were veterans. 
Leach said he has a handful of players who think they're better than they are. He didn't single anyone out -but changes could be imminent. 
The Red Raiders, who dropped out of the Top 25, host Southeast Louisiana Saturday. 
"We had guys sauntering around like prima donnas, and the guys that were the worst were our older guys," Leach said. 
Duquesne President Charles J. Dougherty said he hoped the second arrest would put the university on "the road back to normalcy and back to the safety and security that we have known for years on our campus." 
The team was encouraged that junior forward Sam Ashaolu, the most severely injured player, appeared to be gaining strength. 
Ashaolu, 23, remained in critical condition with one bullet and fragments of another in his head. He has squeezed teammates' hands during their frequent hospi­tal visits, and he seemed to respond to their words of encouragement. 

Hoosiers hope to improve
outdated athletic facilities 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -Indiana University trustees will vote this week on a proposed $55 million project aimed at making the Hoosiers' athletic facilities competi­tive with others in the Big Ten Conference. 
Athletic director Rick Greenspan presented plans and architectural renderings Wednesday to the univer­sity's Board of Trustees. The board will vote on the project Friday. 
If approved, the project would include a new basketball practice facility, improvements to IU's football stadium and a new baseball and softball complex. 
IU president Adam Herbert said such improvements are long over­due. 
"Our athletic facilities are probably the worst in the Big Ten," he said. "It's simply my view that we must correct this fundamental deficiency."

Rose plans to sell apology baseballs 
Ex-Cincinnati coach will auction off 30 signed balls online 
Associated Press 

CINCINNATI -For the right price, Pete Rose is willing to write on a baseball that he's sorry. 
The hits king unveiled his lat­est marketing venture Wednesday on his Web site. For 
$299, plus $4.99 shipping and han­dling, fans can order a baseball inscribed ''I'm sorry I bet on baseball" along with Rose's auto­graph. 
The offering came two days after an auction house confirmed that 30 baseballs 
inscribed the same way would be available for bid next April. 
"Now you can get the baseball collectible everyone's talking about -Pete Rose's personal apology for betting on baseball, newly inscribed on an actual baseball-at a fantastic price," the Web site says. 
Rose's business agent, Warren Greene, didn't return a phone call to discuss the hit king's change of heart. 
On Monday, Greene told The Associated Press that Rose had inscribed baseballs with the apology for some of his collector friends about a year ago. Greene said that Rose never intended for the balls to be sold publicly. 
One of the collectors gave 30 of the balls to a friend, Barry Halper, according to Greene. 
. Halper, a limited partner in the New York Yankees, died last December, and his family is sell­ing his sports memorabilia through Robert Edward Auctions. The collection includes the 30 apology baseballs. 
"Now you can get the baseball collectible everyone is talking about." 
Warren Greene business agent 
The New York Daily News first reported the auc­tion on Monday. 
Greene later told the AP that if some of the balls were going to be made available at auction, Rose might consider signing more of them. 
Field of Dreams 

stores also are selling the base­balls at stores nationwide. Rose also offered to inscribe ''I'm sorry" on baseballs during his autograph appearances at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. 
Rose accepted a lifetime ban for gambling in 1989, but denied for nearly 15 years that he bet on baseball. He finally acknowledged in his latest auto­biography, published in January 2004, that he made baseball wagers while he managed the Cincinnati Reds.

Injuries plague Louisville stars 
Cardinals will struggle to stay unbeaten with back-up backfield 
Associated Press 

LOUISVILLE -In 1994, Nebraska was undefeated and No. 2 in the country when the Cornhuskers' national title hopes took a potentially dev­astating blow. 
Star quarterback Tommie Frazier was sidelined with a blood clot in his leg halfway through the season. The Huskers didn't just survive without Frazier, they went on to win it all. 
Now, Louisville, unbeaten and No. 8, is facing a similar challenge. The Cardinals have already lost star tailback Michael Bush for the year with a broken leg and fellow Heisman hopeful, quarterback Brian Brohm, for at least a month with a hand injury. 
So far, Louisville's been unfazed -at least on the field -by the injuries. When Bush went down early in the second half against Kentucky in the season opener, the Cardinals rolled along to a 59-28 victo­ry. Beating Temple with Bush's backups was no prob­lem. 
Then came Miami, when Brohm went down early in the second half. 
Hunter Cantwell replaced Brohm and Louisville posted its biggest win in years -31­7. 
But can the Cardinals keep it up? 
"We need to just keep going," Cardinals coach Bobby Petrino told reporters this week. "I think the depth that we've been working at and the recruiting and you know, the ability to play a lot of play­ers in games last year and in the first two games this year helped us a lot. We've got guys that are very confident." 
Nebraska and coach Tom Osborne were four games into the season, when Frazier was hospitalized with a clot behind his right knee. 
Clinton Childs, one of sever­al talented running backs on that team, said the team's confidence didn't waver when Frazier went down. 
"To be honest, we understood 
line, said Nebraska ran the same simple running play about 40 times and the Wildcats couldn't stop it. 
"We just took it upon our­selves to get this thing done no matter who was playing quarterback," said Wilks, now a firefighter in Portland, Ore. 
Even with the victory in Manhattan, Kan., Nebraska slipped to No. 3. It was the last time that season the 'Huskers went backward. 
With Berringer directing the offense, Nebraska completed 
an undefeated 
regular season 
that included a 
24-7 win over 

what type of "We need to just No. 2 Colorado. team we had," Frazier
keep going. " 
said Childs, who returned in the now coaches at Orange Bowl Omaha North Bobby Petrino against Miami, High School. Louisville coach helping Nebraska 
"We had really, really good team chemistry, it was something coach Osborne instilled in us." 
Brook Berringer stepped in for Frazier and Nebraska won the next two games by a com­bined 74-35. 
Then Berringer got hurt, suffering a partially collapsed lung against Oklahoma State. The 'Huskers turned to third­stringer Matt Turman to start. Berringer played the second half of that 17-6 victory, domi­nated by safety Mike Minter, linebacker Ed Stewart and the Blackshirt defense and the 'Huskers offensive line. 
Joel Wilks, a guard on that 
beat the 
Hurricanes 24-17 

for the first of 
two straight national championships. 
Ultimately, the Cornhuskers were able to overcome the loss of their star -and his backup -because of their depth, a powerful offensive line that made anybody behind it look good and a smothering defense. 
Louisville has shown good depth. 
Cantwell is no Brohm, but he's got the full confidence of his coach. Petrino didn't go conservative with Cantwell at the helm, and don't expect him to anytime soon.

IOC calls for change in Beijing 
Chinese government pressured to bolster human rights laws 
Associated Press 
BEIJING -China has failed to live up to promises its lead­ers made to improve human rights for the 2008 Olympics, Amnesty International said in a report urging the International Olympic Committee to ensure that the Chinese comply. 
The report, released Thursday, catalogs a broad range of persistent human 
rights abuses, from the wide­spread use of the death penal­ty and the extraction of organs from executed prison­ers for trans­plants, to the persecution of civil rights activists and new methods to rein in the media and cen­
sor the Internet. The report also said Beijing is forcing peo­ple from homes to make way for Olympic-related construc­tion projects. 
"Serious human rights viola­tions continue to be reported across the country, fueling instability and discontent," the London-based group's report said. "Grass-roots human rights activists continue to be detained and imprisoned, and official controls over the media and the Internet are growing tighter." 
Amnesty International called on the Chinese government to enact reforms. It also urged the IOC and the Olympics "to put pressure on Chinese authorities" to release political prisoners, take steps toward ending the death penalty and repeal restrictions on the free flow of information. 
China's foreign ministry did­n't immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The IOC said that with nearly two years to go it was too early to take China to task and that the Olympic governing body 
"By allowing Beijing to host the games you will help the development of human rights. " 
Liu Jingmin Vice President Beijing bid committee 
was not a political pressure group. 
"It's premature to say that China has failed to live up to its pledges to hold a success­ful Games," IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said. "We don't work by putting pressure. That's not our methodol­ogy." 
Though many of 

the ills cited by the group have been endemic for years in China, the report underscores an uncomfortable contradic­tion: While the world was promised that a Beijing Games would bolster respect for human rights, the Communist leadership appears to be dig­ging in its heels. 
Over the past three years, Chinese leaders have mounted the most sustained clampdown on dissent since the quelling of the Tiananmen Square democ­racy movement in 1989. Aside from political and religious dissidents, the government has taken steps to intimidate new groups, such as activist lawyers and scholars, while aggressively scouring the Internet for political essayists and firing and detaining reporters and editors. 
The suppression campaign stands in contrast to China's continued buildup of a vibrant econom~ and a dynamic socie­ty with a burgeoning middle class -changes Beijing hopes to showcase at the Olympics. 
In bidding for the games in 2001, Chinese leaders prom­ised IOC members that the Olympics would lead to an improved climate for human rights and media freedoms. 
"By allowing Beijing to host the games you will help the development of human rights," Amnesty International quoted Liu Jingmin, a vice president of the Beijing bid committee and now a senior official in charge of preparations for the games, as saying in 2001. 
IOC members also have said they, expect Beijing to keep its word. 
Beijing's effort to build state-· of-the-art venues and trans­portation facilities and remake run-down neighborhoods has contributed to civil rights abuses, the Amnesty International report said. It cited the cases of Ye Guozhu and Qi Zhiyong, Beijing resi­dents subjected to forced evic­tions as the city undergoes an Olympic makeover

Thomas benched for marijuana use

GAINESVILLE, Fla. -Florida defensive tackle Marcus Thomas was suspended indefi­nitely Wednesday for a second violation of the school's sub­stance-abuse policy, leaving the fifth-ranked Gators without their top pass rusher.

review. It's under evaluation, and I'll comment when it's appropri­ate. There's no timetable. Nothing is set in stone." 
Thomas spent part of Wednesday in meetings with school officials to appeal the suspension he received earlier this week for marijuana use, his mother said. Sheila Mote said her son tested positive twice for marijuana between the middle of July and the end of August. She believes both results are from the same drug use. 
Mote said her son ingested 
marijuana at a party this sum­mer. When he returned to cam­pus in July, he failed a first drug test, which prompted school officials to suspend him for the season opener. 
A second test, which Mote said came three to four weeks after the first, also came back positive. According to the school's drug policy, Thomas could be suspended for 50 per­cent of the season. 
School officials denied reports that Thomas already had been suspended five games. 
Thomas has the right to appeal any suspension to athlet­
ic director Jeremy 
Foley. Athletes are

which handed down the original suspension, about whether to change the conditions of the punishment. 
"I just have to learn more about it," Meyer said. 
Thomas is a three-year starter who has 138 career tackles and 13 sacks. Without him, the Gators will move defensive end Ray McDonald to tackle and insert sophomore Derrick Harvey into the starting lineup. 
'Tie's definitely a big player," linebacker Brandon Siler said.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL-GOLD LEAGUE 
Football fever takes center stage tonight 
PW and Pangborn gear up for 8 p.m. rematch at Riehle 
By MATT HOPKE and JOHN 
TIERNEY 
Sports Writers 

 
Forget the "Feve". All the Thursday night dancing will be on the gridiron tonight at Riehle West Field as Pangborn battles Pasquerilla West at 8 p.m. in a rematch of last year's champi­onship game. 
The intensity for the replay of PW's 13-0 championship victory heated up after both the Phoxes and the defending champion Purple Weasels put up strong wins in their opening games. 
Pasquerilla West put on a show last weekend, destroying the Babes of Breen-Phillips 20­
0. The offensive explosion was due in large part to captain Mo Spring's two touchdown recep­tions. 
"We came out strong last week but we weren't perfect," Spring said. "We hope to contin­ue to improve every week." 
Pangborn also posted a win in its season opener, beating Farley's Finest 6-0. Most teams spend the first week working out the kinks, but the Phoxes have a roster full of juniors and seniors that know about bi"g game experience. 
"We played pretty well last week, and we've been practic­ing a lot so we feel pretty good about the game against PW," Pangborn captain Katie Hiemersma said. "We're return­ing most of our players from 
last year, so we're pretty excited 

I 
I. about the rematch." A win tonight would put either team at the top of the Gold League with a 2-0 record. The added bonus for Pangborn would be some revenge for the shutout they suffered in the Stadium last season. 
"I think we're going to beat them," Riemersma said. "We're definitely good enough to beat them." 
Howard vs. Breen-Phillips 
Howard and Breen-Phillips enter tonight's 9 p.m. matchup at Riehle West Field on two opposite paths, with BP looking to rebound after a shutout loss Sunday and Howard looking to keep its momentum going after a shutout win. 
Howard defeated Lewis 6-0 Sunday·on a first-half touch­down pass from Sheena Ketchum to Megan Savage. While the Duck offense was sti­fled most of the game, the big­play capability it showed early on was enough. Howard held on to the lead and the victory thanks to dominating defensive play. 
Meanwhile, BP lost 20-0 to defending lnterhall champions Pasquerilla West. The BP ofTense looked good in spots and moved the ball efficiently, but was unable to make the big plays needed to score. The offense improved in the game's waning moments, while the defense forced a turnover ofT an interception in the second half. 
The Ducks plan to stick to their defensive game plan from Sunday, but hope that their ofTense will pick up more of the load. Offensively, Howard wants to get off to another fast start against BP. 

"Getting the touchdown in the first half was huge, and we would like to do the same on Thursday," Ducks· captain Catherine Krug said. 
However, Krug also empha­sized· Howard's need to bP more consistent oiTensively. 
"The plan is to not bn content with just one touchdown. Wf1 found out some things that worked offensively, and some that didn't," she said. "So we plan on building on that to cre­ate a more consistent attaek." 
While on the surfacP, BP's loss to PW appears potentially crip­pling, the fact that the Babes played well in the seeond half to the defending champions and early favorites should be encouraging. 
BP can still rebound to make the Gold League playoffs if it wins Thursday. 
A win for Howard, mean­while, will put the Ducks at 2-0 and headed toward a playoff spot. 
McGlinn vs. Lewis 
Tho McGlinn Shamrocks will open their season against the Chicks of Lewis tonight at 7 p.m. on Riehle West Field. 
Though the contest will be McGlinn's opener, captain Madeline Boyer remains conn­dent. 
"We're not too worried that they have played a game and we haven't," Boyer said. "We just need to put into play every­thing we practiced." 
Lewis {0-1) suffered a close loss to Howard in a game where one score was the difference. The 6-0 shutout only gives the Chicks more incentive to come out firing on all cylinders tonight, said captain Mia De La Rosa. 
"We played OK in our first game. We just came out on the short end," De La Rosa said. "We tried our best in practice to fix the problems." 
Foremost among the Chicks' troubles is putting points on the board. Despite generating a couple lengthy drives, Lewis fin­ished its first game without a score something the Shamrock defense loves to hear. 
"We have a really good defense," Boyer said. "From what I heard, Lewis didn't score last week. Our goal is to make sure they don't score again." 
One major issue Lewis and McGlinn will try to sort out is what to do with a boatload of freshmen, as both captains are quick to admit that their teams are short on experience.

"You feel like with 24 shots you should maybe get a little more out of it, but that's life," he said. 
To be fair, Lady Luck was defi­nitely not on Notre Dame's side during many of Wednesday's 24 shots. In the 65th minute, for­ward Joseph Lapira fired a laser that Northern Illinois goalkeeper Joe Zimka had no chance of reaching, only to watch it dang off the crossbar and rieochet back into play. At the same time, in the 32nd minute, Lapira had an open look on goal, but mis-hit the ball and let it dribble out for a goal kick. While Lapira was clearly not the only Irish player to misplay a ball during the 110­minute-match, the play exempli­at the exact midpoint of the regu­hold their confidence."

defense for the team's continued success. 
"Our attack has been more balanced this year. We have quite a few players that can put the ball down," Schroeder-Biek said. "And our back court has done a nice job keeping the ball alive for the offense." 
Setter Amanda David was one of those players, making several key plays to keep the Belles afloat. 
Senior outside hitter Kristen Playko posted her 11th double­double of the year with a 15-kill, 22-dig performance. Freshman outside hitter Lorna Slupczysnki also had a double-double, her seventh of the season, with 13 kills and 10 digs. Sophomore middle back Cathy Kurczak

has the most possessions or the most shots that wins, it's the team that takes their chances." 
Notre Dame almost found itself' on the wrong side of the scoreboard in the first over­time despite controlling the pace. Northern Illinois senior Justin McGrane put a low cross in from the end-line where teammate Marcus McCarty's touch took him past his defender. Only a rel'lex save from Irish senior goalkeeper Chris Cahill kept McGrane's shot from giving the Huskies the victory. 
"Cahill made a very good save lon McGranel," Clark said. "If that shot goes in, we lose a game that we dominat­ed, and that's happened to us a couple of times already this 
season." Notre Dame had its share of chances in overtime as well. 
Its best opportunity came in the 105th minute when Lapira threaded a through ball to fellow forward Justin McGeeney. Northern Illinois sophomore keeper Joe Zimka came sliding out to clear the ball, which went straight to the feet of Lapira. Lapira shot the ball toward the empty net, but Huskies defender Josh Karsten came flying back to clear the ball off the line. 
Although the Irish cn~ated chances in regulation time, they were hindered by Northern Illinois's 4-5-1 for­mations, which allowed the Huskies to put most of their players back on defense and counter-attack. 
"[Their formation! forced us to keep working the ball and to be patient," Clark said. "You ended up with 21 

players in one half of the field. There wasn't a lot of space." 
With the tie, Notre Dame's record stands at 4-3-2 for the season and 2-2-0 in Big East play. The Irish will next take on Pittsburgh at home on Saturday night, and despite his team's goose egg on Wednesday, Clark is opti­mistic that the scoring will come. 
"We're making chances, but we're not finishing them off," Clark said. "We're very much at the forming stages right now." 
Notes: 

+ Wednesday night was the fourth consecutive start for senior goalkeeper Chris Cahill. After the game, Clark confirmed that Cahill earned the starting job for now.

Empty net syndrome 
Irish play to scoreless draw after two overtimes 
.._ 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sporrs Writer 

Junior Joseph Lapira was inches away from giving the Irish a hard­fought victory over Northern Illinois Wednesday night at Alumni Field. But the Huskies' most important defender was their crossbar, which stopped Lapira's shot and pre­served the double-overtime, 0-0 tie. 
In the 86th minute, Lapira received a pass outside the 18-yard line, pushed the ball past his defender and unleashed a shot that had the keeper beat. The ball rico­cheted back off the iron, as the Irish missed their best chance to wrestle away victory. 
Notre Dame's lack of scoring was certainly not because of a lack of opportunities. Notre Dame outshot Northern Illinois 24 to 7, (15 to 4 shots on goal) in the second half and two overtimes. The Irish also held the edge in corner kicks by· a 10-to-3 margin. 
"We had some very good chances that we didn't take," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "If you watch soccer, it's not always the team that

Team hopes to improve upon recent showing 
By FRAN TOLAN Sporrs Writer 

Heading into the Gopher Invitational in Wayzata, Minn.. last weekend, Irish coach Jim Kubinski said he did not know what to expect. lie didn't get exactly what he wanted as the Irish finished ninth in a 12-team lield. 
In light of Notre Dame's strug­gles, the Irish are looking for new contributors to rescue the team's performance from the proverbial woods -including those newest to the team. 
Notre Dame's four freshmen make up more of the squad than any other class. 
Newcomers Doug Fortner, Olavo Batista Filho, Carl Santos­Ocampo and Kyle Willis were forced to compete for their roles almost as soon as they stepped onto campus. This intrasquad struggle was new to some of them. 
"Ever since about sophomore year of high school, it was always a given that we'd be playing," said Willis, from Lake Forest, Ill. "Now, there's such a high level or play within the team." 
Despite the intense atmos­phere in practices and quali­fiers, the freshmen have quickly gelled with each other and the rest of the team. 
"We definitely all root for each other," Fortner said. "It's really competitive but we are still real­ly good friends off the course." · 
The encouragement he got · from his teammates may have· affected him positively at the Gopher Invite. As the only fresh­man chosen to represent Notre Dame at the event, Fortner made a hole-in-one on his way to firing a team-best round of 71 Saturday.
