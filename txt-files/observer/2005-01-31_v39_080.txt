Notvvorthy of a stortning 
It's diflicult to keep my emotions sep­arate while sitting on press row. I am a student reporter, and those two roles are very dift'erent. But I feel I do a good job keeping my emotions in check when having to report on 
Notre Dame sporL'i. 
But Sunday after the final horn sounded in Notre Dame's win over Connecticut, I became disap­pointed to be a Notre Dame stu­


dent. Matt Lozar 
That disappoint­ment stemmed from a portion of Editor in Chief the student body storming the court. 
Storming the court should come in games where the country goes, "Wow, that's an unbeliev­able win for that program." Yes, I know that's a weak definition, but there's a feeling when a student body should do it. 
The two Michigan wins in football had solid storming the court cases. Those were two wins that defined the season, the first one more than the second. 
As did the men's basketball win in 2003 over No. 4 PitL<Jburgh at the Joyce Center, and the win over Connecticut exactly one year later. 
As for the studenl'i that didn't storm the court, they did the right thing. 
Look at the members of the team. They didn't wait around on the court for the students to come down. They did some celebration while walking to the locker room, but no way did any of them expect or feel they deserved to be mobbed. Most of them were gone by the time the students made it to the court. They expected to win this game. 
After their loss on Sunday, the Huskies have as many losses as the Irish. This wasn't the No.1 team in the country. This wasn't the same defend­ing national champion from April-the two best players from that team are now in the NBA. 
This was a five-loss Connecticut team, ranked No. 19 in the country, losing a tough road game. The Irish have as many overall and conference losses as the Huskies. 
This was a good conference win. It could possibly be the defining win that sends the Irish to the NCAA tourna­ment. 
But it wasn't worthy of storming the court. 
And please, please, please, don't storm the court ifthe Irish beat Boston College. 
Yes, that could be the Golden Eagles' first loss. It could be a top-S team and the Big East's leader falling at the Joyce Center. That has all of the ingredients one would think about when storming the court. 
As a senior who saw the football team lose four times in four years, my hatred toward Boston College is more than any school. But storming the court only legitimizes them into being on the same level a<; us, which is their only goal in life. 
And that would be worse than any­thing.

Colllps give students unique edge 
Saint Mary's senior requirement lauded as beneficial to students 
Hy MEG CASSIDY AND 
ANGELA SAOUD 
News Wrirer and Sainr Mary's Ediwr 
Saint Mary's is a unique col­lt~gn in many ways -it's all wonwn, vnry small and based on Catholic foundations. But to any Saint Mary's senior stu­dent, it is the senior comp that sots this school apart from the rost slw rt~jnctnd. 
Thn Collegn's requirenwnt for thn Snnior Comprnhonsivn l'rojnet is rare in that all dt~partments, regardless of mw's major, rPquire it. 
Political science professor Teresa Marcy said when she was a student at tho Collngo in I 951J, comps wen1 not a new rnquirnmnnt. 
"My understanding is that this has always b11nn a Collnge requirnment," Mar<~y said. "The comprnlwnsivn has dnfi­nitt>ly changed owr thn years." 
Man~y said when she was a student, thorn wnrn two parts to thn comp -a several hour essay exam preparnd by the department and the GHE exam in thn student's an1a of study. 
She also said some major changes had bnnn made to thn eomp bnforn slw started work­ing in aeadnmic administration in I1J7X. 
"For one, llw (;BE's have bt~nn replaced by an llrulnrgraduatt~ Hneord Exam (lJHE)," Marcy said. "The sec­ond change was the rnplace­1111' n t of tho depart rn nn t a I exam for sonw majors by a projnct of some sort ­research projnct, production of a play -something appropri­ate to tlw particular major." 
t\ftnr a time, there were nven morn changes to the co 111 p. Ma r<~ y s a i d . 0 n n involvPd tlw elimination of tho UBI:, beeausn some dtlpart­nwnts had lodged complaints that it was inappropriate for t h n c u r r i nr lu rn t h n y w tH n teaching. 
t\l'tnr tlwse changes, depart­ments had sole responsibility for organizing and administer­ing their eomps. 
"Thnre is quito a hit of varia­tion across departments, but thn comprtdwnsivns to mn stwm very appropriate for thn rliiTtH'Pnt majors," Marcy said. "Tiwy used to be very umwen, in torrns of difl'iculty, but I think this situation has improwd over tho ynars." 
Assistant Dnan of' t\eadnmie t\ffairs Nancy Nekvasil said slw thinks the stringnnt proj­nct makns Saint Mary's stand out from the crowd of similar schools. 
"I think Saint Mary's is unusual arross the nnrntry for 
requiring a senior comprehen­sive." Nnkvasil said. 
She acknowlndgod whilo many schools have other rigor­tHIS senior graduation requiro­monts, Saint Mary's is unique becauso it requires a compre­lwnsivo project "across tho board for every discipline and in ovory department." 
The specil'ic rnquirements for the t:omps vary drastically betweon departments. The business department does group projects, where each group profiles and analyzes a eompany during the course of a snmestnr. The theater majors naeh direct a play. Math and science majors do major rosoarch or prol.onged experi­ments, on which they write a papor and give a presentation. Biology majors begin their cornps during spring semester junior year. For education majors, their comp is centered on their semester of studont toaehing. Finally, art majors' cornps are presented in the form of a gallery show where they

Snnior Kathnrine Moran has a bit of a difTorent perspeetive, because as a humanistic stud-
ins major, she is in the midst of a three-week comp intensive. 
The humanistie studies eomp consists of a large thesis paper -eithnr creative or analytical in content -tlutt incorporates important aspects of every­thing one has read and learned in tho program. 
"It shows seniors how much we've learned here," Moran said. 
Even though the comp process is overwhelming at times, Moran said she appreci­ates how it encourages dose interactions with the profes­sors in her department. 
"They really challenge us to dig deeper, and I don't think you'd be able to have that per­sonal asset in a larger school," Moran said. 
t\nd despite the long hours and bouts of complaining among students, Marey said in her .time, she never saw a seri­ous proposal to remove comps as a requirement. 
"They eontributc to the inte­

Hoberts said though the process provides signif'icant stress, it has its benefits. 
"The process is proactive for transitioning into one's carenr· bocausn both the process and the final product help one foeus their ereativo thinking on onn dimension of their major in a way that they will them be able to concretely show it to someone else," he said. 
"I don't think that the stu­dents always recognize how important and beneficial it is until afterwards," Nekvasil said. "But the result is very impressivo to potential employers and in applying to graduate schools." 
Moran seemed to be in agreement with that statement as she glanced at the pile of books nnxt to her. 
"I know I'll be glad I did it in 
the  end,  but  the  next  two  
weeks  are going to be  - I'll

Notre Dame: Fixing Hubble a 'no brainer' 
Special to the Observer 
The Ilubblf1 Space Telescope's future is in l'ur­ther doubt amid recent reports that Nt\St\'s 2006 budget will not indude a mis­
sion to repair tho aging instrument. Instead. the reports quotn unnamed White House oflieials as saying thn budget earmarks funds to decommission llubble. 
"White Ilouse to scrap Hubble? I hope not," Peter Garnavich, a Notre Dame astrophysicist, said in reac­tion to tho news roports. "NASi\ has just dosed its 14th round of seienee proposals for the Ilubble. Despite the faet that Hubble may not be work­ing next year. thousands of astronomers from around the world submitted ideas for the usn of the telescope. Nearly all the proposals, ineluding minn to study distant super­novae, ean not be done by any other telescope in the world, mainly bncausn Hubble is not of this world." 
The 14-year old tcleseopn is expected to fail in the next two or three year·s unloss it receives new batteries and gyroscopes. The debate on how to rnpair llubble bngan a ynar ago when Nt\St\ admin­istrator Sean O'Konfe dneidnd using shuttln astronauts to serviee the obsnrvatory was too risky in light of tlw Spaen Shuttln Columbia disaster. llowevnr, a massive public outery prompted O'Keofn to announen in August that NASA would pursun a mission to repair thn tnleseopn using robots. 1\aeh option would eost at least $1 billion. The controvnrsy dnnperwd in December, wlwn an influen­tial eomrnitten of thn U.S. National Aeademins' National Hosoareh Couneil rneom­mnnded that Nt\St\ launch a manned llubbln rescue mis­sion as soon as possible, but O'Keefe hold firm. 
"IIubble is the most produe­tive scinntif'ie mission NASA has over launched," (iarnavich said. "Sevnral national sdenen organizations have rocomnwnded that every efTort be made to keep llubbl11 working. .Just this month tho American .Astronomical Socinty joinnd this list." 
The media reports havn suggested rising costs, assod­ated in part with returning the space shuttlns to f'light, may foren Nt\St\ to focus on a robotic mission to safnly dn­orbit llubbln by sending it splashing into an oenan. President Bush is thought to favor invnstrnnnt in manrwd spaen missions instnad of rnpairing tho llubhle.

ues. In launching a multi­faceted Internet campaign, the Dave Baron-Lizzi Shappell ticket has capital­ized on the incalculable ver­satility of the web. 
"We are using technology to mobilize people through TheFacebook[.coml. AIM profiles, our online website and campaign e-mail updates," Baron said. 
TheFacebook.com has exploded into a campus-wide obsession since its debut this fall. The electronic database allows college students to create a profile, connect with other students and join spe­cific interest groups. 
Joining the ranks among some the site's more popular listings -"NO Squirrel Fans," "Irish Drinking Society" and "Anti-Guy Who Participates in Class Too Much" -are a slew of groups devoted to the indi­vidual tickets. 
Along with Baron and Shappell, the Mark Healy­Bob Costa, Alec White-Erik Powers, Will Marra-Pete Harig and James Leito­Jordan Bongiovanni tickets have initiated groups on the TheFacebook.com in an effort to exploit the free space frequented by thou­sands of students everyday. 
Freshman Matt Decker noted both pros and cons to utilizing TheFacebook.com. 
"TheFacebook[.com] is somewhat effective because of how many students use 
the Web site, but since it's very informal, and seen as a 'time waster' for those who use it might risk losing cred­ibility," Decker said. 
Though the Craig Brede­Vijay Ramanan ticket is the only one without a group listing on TheFacebook.com, they joined their competition in launching an interactive campaign Web site. 
"We are going to make it very clear that we are a seri­ous ticket with a high respect and capability for these jobs, and I think that is evident in our Web site," Ramanan said. 
While each differs in style and pres­entation, they all

"We are starting a word-of­mouth campaign to convey our message," Baron said. "With point people and sec­ondary people in every dorm, we can reach most people and get our vision out on campus." 
Leito and Bongiovanni agreed face-to-face interac­tion is an advantageous method to garner votes. According to the ticket's Web site, both candidates will be available to speak with stu­dents at popular campus sites twice a week during scheduled times.

dents,"

Aside from efforts imple­mented to reach students via the Internet, the campaigns are also relying on classic techniques like fliers and face-to-face interaction to attract potential voters. 
In addition to traditional posters and dorm visits, the Baron-Shappell ticket emp­hasizes the importance of human contact during a campaign season. 
paign tech­
nique is the tried-and-true style of physi­cally conversing with the candidates. 
"There really is no substi­tute for meeting the people who will vote for you and making a personal connec­tion," Brutto said. "Although new media campai.gning allows candidates to connect to more people than ever before, the technique is very impersonal and not as effec­tive as more traditional methods of campaigning." 
Other students, like Decker, cite the various advantages new m~dia out­lets can offer to candidates 
and voters alike. 

"The use of Web sites makes it much easier to inform students about the individual campaigns, as for many of us it's difficult to make time in our schedules to go to speeches," Decker said. "Web sites allow the candidates to reach a large 
-number of people easily and make it easier for students to follow the different cam­paigns on their own time." Hegardless of the advan­tages and disadvantages of the campaigning techniques, the six tickets are dedicated to getting their message out to .the study body by all means possible. "We plan on doing any­thing and everything we can to get to students," Healy said. For the White-Powers tick­et, this means turning to more unconventional modes of campaigning. "We challenge the other tickets to a pentathlon," White said. "Events will include dodge ball, a water balloon duel, an Iron Chef competition, retaking the SAT's and a Quarter Dog eat­ing contest." Not to be outdone, Marra and Harig are also integrat­ing their own form of origi­nality to reach students. "First, we're going to start off with a flying V, followed by a triple deke to a wrister through the l'ive-hole, and then cap off the W with a shrimp on the barbie," Marra said.

Patent for key Merck drug invalidated 
Osteoporosis drug sold to more than 3 million people to be taken off market 
Associated Press 

THENTON, N.J.-A fed­eral court invalidated the patnnt on Friday for Merek &. Co.'s sncond-largest sell­ing drug, the blockbuster osteoporosis treatment Fosarnax, in a dncision that offers millions of patients hope for a cheap­er version sooner, but darkens the company's already clouded outlook. 
The company also was hit with news that the fed­eral Securities and Exchange Commission is starting a formal inquiry into its handling of arthri­tis blockbuster Vioxx, which it withdrew from the market last year after studies showed it incrnasnd the risk of heart attacks and strokes. 
Merr.k's shares tumbled in heavy trading. 
The U.S. Court of' Appeals for the Federal Cireuit in Washington, D.C., Invalidated the patent for the oncll-a-wnek ver­sion of Fosamax, which dominatns the market for osteoporosis drugs. More than 3 million people in the United States af'nicted with the brittle-bone dis­ease take Fosamax. 
Under the ruling, generic competition could begin as soon as early 2008, instead of 2018. The main patent for the daily 5 milligram and 10 milligram versions of the drug already was set to expire in February 2008. 
Fosamax is the No. 2 drug for Whitehouse Station, N..I.-based Merck. It reported sales of $3.16 billion for Fosamax last year, more than 90 percent of which were for the 35 mg and 70 mg once-a­week versions, according to company spokesman Tony Plohoros. 
. Each version costs about $80 for a month's supply. 
"Merck disagrees with the opinion of the court of appeals and is considering its options, ineluding a request for reconsideration by the court of appeals," Plohoros said. 
The court's ruling was a blow to Merck, whieh far.es a dearth of new drugs to offer, slumping sales from major drugs losing patent protection, and lost rev­enues and a slew of law­suits over its withdrawal of arthritis blockbuster Vioxx. 
Merck shares closed down $3.16, or 10 percent, to $28.02 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. Nearly 57 million shares were traded, or roughly six times normal daily volume for Merck . 
"It's a big deal," said Barbara Hyan, a managing director at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. "Merck obviously has a lot of issues faeing it, including the withdrawal of' Vioxx from the market and the loss of the Zocor patnnts in the middle of 2006." 

Zocor, for high choles­terol, is Merck's biggest drug, with $5.2 billion in sales last year. 
"The profit impar.t could be very severe," Hyan said of the Fosamax patent loss. 
Merr.k in 2003 lost two major products in late­stage trials that could have eventually replaced Zocor, said pharmaceuticals ana­lyst Albert Hauch of A. G. Edwards &. Sons Inc. 
"How are you going to replace those revenues'! That's what people are worried about," Hauch said. 
Pharmaceuticals analyst Tim Anderson of Prudential Financial pre­dieted the Fosamax deci­sion will leavn Merck with f'lat earnings in 2008. A once-monthly osteoporosis treatment callnd Boniva, produced by Switzerland's Hoehn Group, is dun out in several months and is "an underapprneiatod thwat," lw added. 
The appeals eou rt's 2-1 decision on Fosamax reversed an August 200:1 ruling by the U.S. District Court in Dnlaware, which had upheld the patnnt. · 
The oncn-a-week patent had lHHHl challenged by generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. of North Wales, Pa., one of the country's largest generic drugmakers, with about 170 medicines on tho market.

Heating oil prices not likely to change 
Associated Press 

VIENNA -A kHy OPEC committee recommended Saturday that the oil cartel keep its current output quota unchanged, its prnsident said, signal­ing that oil producers believe current prices near $50 a barrel are not too high. 
Kuwait's oil minister Sheik Ahmad Fahd al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who heads the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said the recom­mendation to keep the quota at 27 million barrels a day was made by the group's Ministerial Monitoring Committne. That quota was set at the December meeting in Cairo, Egypt. 
However, the group currently pro­duces about 29.6 million barrels a day. 
"We believe that we (will) continuo with the ceiling, but at .the same time (need) to comply with the decision we made in Egypt," he said, adding that some cuts had already been made. 
The 10 members of the group sub­ject to quotas are overproducing by some 500,000 barrels daily, al-Sabah said. Iraq is not subject to the quota. 
The full group will meet Sunday to dedde whether to adopt the commit­tee's recommendation, something it does not necessarily have to do. The eommittHe 's task is to take stock of conditions affecting the oil markets and oll'er policy recommendations to the full group. 
"I think the consensus is that we're not going to decrease," Algerian Oil Minister Chakib Khelil said. 
The decision could heighten U.S. consumer concern about heating oil prices this wintnr, although one ana­lyst said prices lik1~ly will remain sta­ble for now. 
The 11 members did say, though, that cuts could b1~ made at the cartnl's next meeting in Iran in March. 
Iranian Oil MinistPr Bijan Namdar Zangeneh said members should focus on improving compliance with the existing output target.. 
"One idna is that we have oversup­ply in tho markot and an increasn in the level of' stocks," which would be an argument for cutting produetion, he said.

Diversity Awareness. It's a catch­phrase on campus and in our coun­try's politics, but what does it really mean? Most fundamentally, diversity awareness means realizing that other students are different (in race, color, or creed) than you are. Moreover, it 
means realizing that one's actions should avoid mar­ginalizing anyone, in the majority or minority. 
That sounds great -who wouldn't agree that the entire Notre Dame student body should be unified? The trick is figur­ing out how best to achieve this universal goal. The Senate Diversity Committee has faced this difficult question in its attempt to make Notre Dame a better community. 
We have all seen mis­takes made during attempts to change the sta­tus quo. Many stereotypes about the majority groups on campus have been made in the name of diver­sity awareness, demonizing them as rich, white and intolerant Catholics who could never understand anyone different. Likewise, the good-faith efforts of minority groups have been reduced to the actions of an angry

few who need to "give it up." The truth, as always, lies somewhere in the middle. 
Diversity at Notre Dame must move beyond tolerance and towards rela­tionships. An increasingly diverse stu­
dent body serves no purpose if the different groups within that body do not intertwine. The purpose of diversity is to learn about one another and, in the process, learn about ourselves. So this 
message goes to all groups and stu­dents alike. 
To the majority: leave your corn­fort zone and go meet new and different people. They exist, we 
assure you. This is a rare time in your life where you have 
access to people in your same position that could offer so many new things. We are all the same age, all students, all going through 
the same experiences. However, some of us come from different places and bring different perspectives. It is this opportunity to see life from per­spectives other than your own that make college a rich and rewarding experience. 
To the minority: There is no point in leaving horne and going somewhere

new if you are not willing to take in the experience. Joining a small group of people that are the same as you and sheltering yourself off from the rest gives you no potential to grow. 
Understandably, it is at first com­fortable to face a change with people that can uniquely relate to you. But what is the use of never relating to anyone else? In the end, we are all privileged to be here and we should all take advantage of the opportuni­ties offered. Even if the Office of Admissions did all it could to ensure that each new class is more diverse than the last, its efforts would be worthless unless the kid from Panama gets to know the kid from Panama City Beach, Fla. 
It's Diversity Week at Notre Dame. Notre Dame can be a place where we will be able to openly discuss issues of religion, race and sexuality. We hope to dissolve social stratifications that limit students to sitting at certain tables in the dining halls. Conversations about coach Tyrone Willingham's firing or gay rights shouldn't begin and end with T-shirt designs. We must all realize that someone that disagrees with you is not necessarily ignorant; increased communication will enhance our uni­versity's social and intellectual expe­riences. Please join us in a step toward establishing a closer Notre Dame community.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Monologues are art, not propoganda 
I onjoynd l'otor Wick's Jan. 27 column investi­gating campus roal:lions to tho "Vagina Monologuos." But I was surprised by his daim that if' Eve Ensler worn "a bntlnr artist shn would havo d1ostm a fi~rmatthat allowed her to acknowlodgo disstmting voices." It semns a rnis­roading of' tho play's purpose and llw purpos1~ of' art in gennral. 
Enslor's play is dosigned to be deliberately provocativo, likn Ann Coulter's books or Michanl Moon~·s films. i\ll three take extrome positions in ord1w to push tho boundaries of' publie dis­courso. Thny lake five steps to the left or right so that tho gerwral public may someday lake orw stop. Thorn is a word for cnmtive endnav­ors that advance a particular political agtmda to tlw 1~xdusion of' all other concerns-propagan­da. 
·But make no mistake: Enslnr's play is art. not propaganda. Its wit and compassion for its charat:tnrs nlnvatn it ahovo the levo.l of' mere polemic. Tlwy lond tht~ play a depth and lm~adth of' spirit that that may allow it to res­onaln with audinnens in 2050. By contrast, both "Fahmnhnit IJ-11" and "Treason" are so cir­eumscribed by their agendas as to be artless. 
Would the Vagina Monologues be better art if. as Wick suggests, they ineluded dissent'? Perhaps. But it's difficult to imagine how it could b1~ integrated into tho play. The resulting "dialogue" would seem to bn like the ones that Notm Dame has regarding abortion and homo­sexuality -two diametrically opposed sides scrnaming invective at ono another, eaeh locked into an ideology that forbids compromise. Put Coulter and Moore in a room and see if' they come out agrneing or dead. 
As a centrist-, someone who says, "There's nothing vulgar about saying 'vagina,"' but blushes as he says it, I, liko Wiek, woleomo voic­os that provide evnnhandnd insight into multiple sides of' eontroversial issuns. But I do not daim. as Wick senms to, that a work of' art ought to give tho opposition equal airtime. After all, that is the purpose of a newspaper editorial page, not the theater. 
Tom Miller graduate student Jan. 29 

Play doesn't protect won1en 
Violnnen against wonwn, like many things in our world, is something that not only eontributos to the bn~akdown of' sodety, it also is just sad. A'l is our Catholic mission here at Notm Dame, wn must wad1 out and protect all in soeiety who are dofimsnlnss -batternd women, victims of abor­tion, tlw poor and tho list goes on. 
Ilowevnr, I think those involved with the Vagina Monologues lictil in this mission. I was absolutdy appalled at tho nature of Karla Bell and Molly Savage's letter on Jan. 27. llow does this production holp stop women's violence'? If anything, it makes a woman's anatomy into something to be joked about, dishonored and lrivializnd. I bdieve this type of aetivity would promote violence against women more than pro­lt~et against it. Why do people in tho world muti­lato thnsn wom1m and their bodies'? The answer is that tlw wonwn arn seen as lesser, as not worth di1-,rnity and respect. 
Trust me, ladins, by talking about your God­givnn bodies in such a vulgar way, you do not promoln dignity li>r yourselvns-you destroy it. 
I Juring early World War II, tho Nazis would nxneutn individuals by shooting them with guns into a pit of bodies. Ilowever, they later ehanged methods. Not only wore bullets bneoming too eostly, but thfl executioners wore having trouble killing so many people, especially ones who spoke German. This was because the Nazis saw the people they were kiiling almost as equals. To hurt someone, a person must see the other as inferior. Otherwise, the task beeomes more dilli­eult. 
The same applies to this ease. Women who are abused, raped, prostituted and murdered are seen as less than human beings by their victimiz­ers. We ought to promote things that go against this trend, not support it. 
Even if some aspects of this production really do aim at goals of stopping violence, one cannot ignore tho glaring ways in which this message is brought aeross. The body of a woman is sacred, and we should treat it that way, not only in our actions but also in our words.

Lecture series disappoints 
As a Catholic and a pro-life feminist, I was plnasnd to sen that two Notre Dame students, Christina Dohan and Anamaria Seaperlanda­Buiz, had organized a series of on-campus talks entitled "The Maria Goretti Project: 1\mpownring Women to End Violence." As we all know, violenec against women is an issue of great eoncern, especially for eollegn-agn women, who are most often the vktims of sex­ual assault, and for pregnant women, as homi­eide was the number one cause of' death for pregnant women in tho U.S. last year. 
When I atltmded the series, however, I was disappointed to find that violence against wonwn was only minimally discussed. On the other hand. the importance of' stay-at-home mothering was giwn top billing two nights in a row. I wondnrnd, as I sat in the audience, if thorn wasn't some ulterior motive behind tho series, something not on the posters, some­thing about tho new feminism of Pope John Paul II. The voeation of motherhood is a fine and worthy topic for eollegn women to discuss, most of' us will bn mothers, still, I felt a bit dncnivnd as the series was advertised as being about violence against women, when in fact its seope was much more broad. 
Finally I think the choice of' St. Maria Goretti was an unfortunate one. Maria Goretti was an eleven year-old when she was stabbed to death by her would-be rapist for refusing to submit her virginity to him. She reportedly shouted, "No it's a sin! I will not do it!" Canonized in 1950 for prnscrving her purity at the eost of her life and for forgiving the perpe­trator, Maria is the patroness of women, purity and victims of rape. Maria's struggle, however harrowing, seems to suggest that a woman's holiness consists entirely in the extent to which she resists the sometimes violent advances of men. This, I think, is the kind of outdated thinking that has left so many women who have been sexually assaulted blaming themselves, and believing that they are responsible for their "sin."

U.S. president should stay American 

how nonsensical it is to allow foreigners some Will Gardner olliees but not all. Sorry, folks, this isn't tlw mayor of Cross Plains we're talking about, it's tho presi­Texas n~ch dent of' the United States. l fniversity 
Whoever holds this oflice represents our eountry l lniversity to the world, he or she is the embodiment of' what Daily we are all about. In my eyes, for someone to fit tho aforementioned criteria, he or she has to be a natural-born U.S. eiti­zen. 
This is no dig against foreigners by any means. I have the utmost respect and admiration for people with enough guts to leave their country and seek a better life. After all, improving the quality of life for you and your descendants is something for which most aspire. I firmly believe these people who legally enter our country positively contribute to society. They are strong-minded, hard-working individu­als. 
However, I am still strongly opposed allowing them a chance to run for president. American-born citizens have a natural, innate patriot­ism that runs in their blood. It's something that eannot b9 taught or learned. · 
I am willing to bet an Ameriean-born person would die for this country. Would someone born elsewhere feel the same'? Some would, but there would be others who would have to think about it <ir deeline. 
When you are speaking of tho oflice of the president of the United States, that person must bleed red, white and blue. 
Here's another scenario. Let's say foreigners are allownd lo run for president, and someone from France gets elected. He's a grnat, upstanding individual with great ideas for this country's futuro. I low do you think he would reaet if. during his term, we had to go to war against France, his homnland, a place wherP many of his rnlativns still reside'? 
Would he be able to do it'? It would be an obstade this man would have to overcome. There are enough hurdles to leap ovnr already. It would be foolish to add another one. 
Now, while this is purely hypothetical, it eould come to pass if' a for­eigner were elected. 
For all you conspiracy theorists out there: What if a vehemently anti-American migrated here with the purpose of running the Unitnd States into the ground'? Don't think for a second there wouldn't bo someone out there with this notion. If people are willing to attach bombs to their bodies and blow themselves up, this would be a walk in the park. 
I know the chances of these two scenarios aetually taking place aro at best minute, but still, we eannot allow the possibility. 
What it all comes down to is the fact that the president should bn the epitome of American. Would the leader of an organization likn tho NAACP be Hispanic, Caucasian or Asian'? No, bneause he simply can­not grasp the hardships or ideals of blacks. lie can sympathize with them and even lend a helping hand, but unless you are born with that understanding, you never can relate truly. 
It's my main fear that one day we will eleet someone president who doesn't understand or realize what it is to bn an American. That, or maybe I'm petrified that one day, I will be stuek ehoosing bntwenn Sen. Hillary Clinton and the Terminator.

CONCERT REVIEW 

The Chieftains impress at the PAC 
World-renowned Irish group entertains with ease

Scene Writer 
An incredible week has arrived at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center. 
Not only did we have the pleasure of a dynamite per­formance Sunday from the Chieftains, regarded by many as the centerpiece of t~;aditional Irish music, but also Thursday evening marks the arrival of perhaps the most famous orchestra in the world. 
"I think it's incredible that we're able to get groups with the notoriety of the Chieftains," said Notre Dame student Bridget O'Brien. "As a senior, I'm really excited to see all this happening now instead of next year." 
But it really is happening here? At Notre Dame? Was everyone headed to Chicago and ran out of gas? 
Whatever the circumstances, it is a musically historic week at Notre Dame, and the Chieftains kicked it off with an electric performance. In their show, they included numerous special guests and even the inclusion of a local group for the encore. 
The band started the evening with two up-tempo Irish ballads, beginning the program with a great deal of ener­gy. The ballads featured a solo on bagpipes and Irish tap dance by the Canadian brothers Jon (whom also doubled as a fiddler) and Nathan Pilatzke. The brothers were astounding, as were traditional Irish dancers Cara Butler and Danny Golden. A group of younger Irish dancers from the World Academy also made an appearance in the show's second half. It was surprising to see such so much time distributed to dancing, but there were certainly no complaint<> about it. 

The musical guest artists also demonstrated a standard of excellence. Spanish musician Carlos Nunez, who has collaborated with the Chieftains since 1990, performed on the Gaita (a Spanish version of the bagpipes), recorder, whistle, and bombard (a double-reed wind instrument, similar in appearance to an oboe). Nunez's music felt mystical and even curious. It seemed as if he were diving into elaborate improvisational phrases that did not stray far from the melody, and yet still felt too complicated to actually have been written out. 
This perspective goes for much of the Chieftains' music as well; everyone performed the concert from memory, but it seemed unlikely that every note played was planned in advance. The Chieftains are very connected with the rhythmic and formulaic aspects of their music. However they make sure to allow for just enough room for melodic variation, so that they do not become sepa­rated from the heart of the music. 
But just playing beautiful music is more than enough, as evidenced by guest artist Triana Marshall on the Irish harp. She did nothing complicated. She played her solos sweetly and harmoniously, and she sounded dazzling. 
After a finale that featured all of the musicians in a great jam session, the Chieftains brought out local Irish group Kennedy's Kitchen. One could feel the excitement on stage, with the fusion of two fme groups -one with worldly connections, the other playing in their own back­yard-resulting in Irish music. 
Paddy Moloney, the frontman for the Chieftains, endeared himself to the audience as the night went on. He cited the group's incredible history, which includes eighteen Grammy nominations and six Grammy awards. "We would've won seven Grammys for 'Down the Old Plank Road," he added, "but those Dixie Chicks were in the way." 
Moloney was also very grateful to the PAC for the con­cert opportunity, noting towards the end of the concert, "We really enjoyed coming here. It's a fantastic theater, fantastic sound." 
The audience gave the Chieftains a warm reception all night. "It's been good to hear traditional Irish music," said student Mike Cloughesy. 
Chieftains fan John Brady gave the concert rave reviews. "It was fabulous," he said. "We saw [the Chieftains] in Chicago five years ago, and we liked them even better here."

Riley and Reekers feature student art -­
Art majors and selections for 'The Juggler' displayed on campus 




By MARIA SMITH Scene Editor 

It's not often you can walk into an nxhibit and are abln to say you know the m·tist. The current displays of Notre Dame undergraduate and graduate prints and photographs in Riley hall and Hflckers may let you do exactly that. The exhibits arn a chance to see some of the best work from student<; who spnnd the majority of their time inside Riley llall working hard as urt and dnsi1-,>11 majors. 
Riley 

Time is running out to catch the work of stu­dnnt photographers in Hiley I fall. The Annual Undergraduate Photo Major Exhibition, set up in the gallery in the front hallway on the west­em side of the building, will be taken down thL<> week. The exhibition is one of two displays of student work presented annually in the Hiley gallery, which is usually reserved for displays by professional artists. 
At the end of the semester the gallery is also used to display ti1e work of student<> graduating after earning their bachelor's degree. The Hiley exhibit is one of the first chances many student<> have to display their work in a gallery setting, and it gives them a chance to learn how to frame and hang their work professionally. Graduate student Sheila Talbitzer Reynolds, who was in charge of organizing this year's exhibit and choosing the prints, was impressed by the quality and variety of the submi<>sions. 
"The show is incredible this time," she said. 

The exhibit represent<> the work of 14 photo majors, each of whom submitted up to iliree dif:· ferent prints for Reynolds to choose. This year tho department will also present juror's award<> for two photos chosen by professors and gradu­ate students from tim department. The awards will be prcsentod at the gallery reception, which will tako place on Tuesday from 6 to 8 p.m. on the second floor of Riley. 
Reekers 

Most students probably remember picking up "The Juggler" in ti1e dining halls; but until this semester, few have had a chm1ce to see any of the actual pieces or art featured in "The Juggler." 
The magazine, which comes out once a semester, is intended to give students a chance to see some of the best new art being created by ).,Tfaduatn and undcrbrraduate students. 
The magazine put<> out a call for submissions once a semester and tile editors choose particu­larly impressive pieces for publication. The new exhibit in Reekers will fr1ature the original finn art prints and photographs featured in this semester's issue of "The Juggler," which is sehedulnd to come out next wonk. 
KThe oxhibit is both a way to promote the magazine itself and to give the artists them­selves a venue for showing their work out<>ide it," Juggler editor Mary Prcdergast said. "Whilo tho magazinn is dedicated to making the cam­pus aware or thn art that's bning madn here, it's obviously much better to sec the work in pnr­son." 
Exhibition organizer and Thn Observer's asso­ciate photo editor Chuy Benitez is currently completing tho nxhibit and plans to bn finished by Friday. 
Studnnt<> can already see most of tho piints on display in Beckers. The display does not have a scheduled ending date, but Benitez hopes Heckers will become a permannnt gallnry for <u1 rnaturnd in "The Juggler," with a new display every semester in conjunction with the maga­zine. 
Both ti1n Reekers and B.ilny exhibits m·e free, conveninntiy located and open to all. 
So tho next time you walk by, stop in a take a look around for work created by your own frinnds and da<>smatns.

Associated Press CHICAGO -Sammy Sosa was once as popular a fixture at Wrigley Field as the ivy-covered brick walls and the ancient scoreboard hanging over the center field bleachers. Fans flocked to the neighborhood ball park to watch one of his majes­tic home runs, while other congre­gated in the streets to try and retrieve one of them. Now he's on his way out of Chicago. A trade to the Baltimore Orioles for Jerry Hairston and two prospects is expected to reach Commissioner Bud Selig's desk Monday for approval. From there, Sosa would need to pass a physical and the deal could be announced Wednesday or Thursday. 
IN BRIEF 
Williams overcomes injury 
to win Australian Open 
MELBOURNE, Australia -Serena Williams was losing and in pain, wincing on almost every swing. Her shots lacked their usual zing. Her hopes for a seventh Grand Slam appeared to be doomed. 
Then, with a little help from the trainer, the woman who calls herself the toughest fighter in tennis started getting her power back. And it was top-ranked Lindsay Davenport who was in big trouble. 
Williams rallied for a 2-6, 6-3. 6-0 victory in the Australian Open final on Saturday for her first Grand Slam title in 18 months. 
She also extended her winning streak here to 14 matches. 
Injuries had played a part in Williams' fall from the top spot in women's tennis, and it looked like her health would fail her again Saturday. 
"I said: 'This is not happening again,"' she said. 
The once smiling slugger and the team he played for since 1992 are parting company. And not on happy terms. 
"Sammy has been great for base­ball and really great for the city of Chicago, and I'm sorry to see it end this way," Cubs manager Dusty Baker told the Chicago Tribune. 
"It's really not what his legacy should be. 
Sosa endeared many with his self­styled quirks -a home run hop, blowing kisses in rapid succession after retuning to the dugout, tapping his heart and racing to right field like a sprinter before each game to salute the fans in the bleachers. 
Sosa feasted on the adulation from the fans, especially at Wrigley Field. They stayed with him even after he used a corked bat in 2003. But last 
Safin defeats Hewitt to win 
Australian Open 
MELBOURNE, Australia -Marat Safin finally won the Australian Open, overpowering Lleyton Hewitt 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 on Sunday night for his first title in the Gland Slam event after two runner-up finishes in the last three years. 
The fourth-seeded Russian over­came a slow start to win his second Grand Slam title and end Hewitt's bid to become the first Australian cham­pion since Mark Edmondson won the 1976 at Kooyong. 
Safin, also the 2000 U.S. Open win­ner, ended top-ranked Roger Federer's 26-match winning streak in the semifinals Thursday before push­ing aside the pesky Hewitt in the first night championship match in Grand Slam history. Leonard overtakes falteringOglivie to win Hope 
LA QUINTA, Calif. -Justin Leonard shot a S-under 67 Sunday to overtake the faltering Joe Ogilvie and season, it began to turn as he strug­gled at the plate and the boos began to ring out from the frustrated home fans. 
He batted just .253 -his lowest average since 1997 -and in 126 games finished with 35 homers and 80 RBis. 
Sosa, who often referred to him­self as a gladiator, seemed to be sur­prised that people forgot what he had accomplished: 574 homers, including three separate seasons of at least 60, and -until last year when he had a back injury -nine straight 1 00-RBI seasons. 
Others thought the showmanship got old. And it was no secret that his boom box that often sent out loud music throughout the clubhouse was not always popular with his team­mates. 
win the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. 
Leonard finished the 90-hole tour­nament at 28-under 332, three shots in front of Ogilvie and Tim Clark of South Africa. 
Ogilvie, still winless in his six years on the tour, had a closing 73. Clark shot 69. 
Coming off his worst year since joining the tour full-time in 1995, for­mer British Open champion Leonard rolled in six birdie putts and had just one bogey in the final round at PGA West's Palmer Course. 
He began the day three shots behind the front-running Ogilvie, who had been tied for the lead or alone at the top since the opening round of the five-day event. 
Defending champion Phil Mickelson. who also won the title in 2002, shot himself out of contention when he hit into the water on the par-4 No. 13 and took a double bogey. 
His 71 left him tied for 12th at 21 under.

The sheM numbers of the other teams seemed to be tho biggest factor in the outcome of tho meet. Calvin has a women's team made up of 22 swimmers and Albion has 29 swimmers on the team. 
With a Saint Mary's roster comprised of only 14 swim­mers, the Belles eould not keep up with the depth of their oppo­rwnts.

Brey issues challenge, team responds with win 
It wasn't when the little lep­rechaun sitting on the rim pre­vented Marcus Williams' layup from tying the game that told Mike Brey the Irish would come out victorious Sunday after­noon. 
It was when the where-has­that-been-all­season dunk came from the suddenly dominant Torin Francis 

a eouple min­utes earlier Sports Writer that told Brey the Irish would get the much-needed win. 
"It's almost like we were thinking we're going to get this one today," Brey said. "You're in this business long enough and the games and there's a flow to them. You're thinking that's a heck of an exclamation point." 
That's the impact play the Irish have been waiting to get in the magnitude of a game they have been waiting to win all season. Out of nowhere 
After two disappointing road losses and the missml opportu­nity against Syraeuse three weeks prior to Sunday, no one expected this type of perform­ance out of the Irish. 
So where did it come from? 
It came from a challenge by their coach. 
One heck of a challenge. 
"I challenged their manhood [on] Wednesday night after the game at Villanova and the last two days, and I'm going to chal­lenge it ItodayI." Brey dead­panned after the game Sunday. "It's funny, we all know when that's challenged, especially us males, we react. · 

"I thought they reacted well." 
Brey's challenge triggered something in his players. 

It triggered something in Dennis Latimore to be the type of player many expected to see after he transferred from Arizona. 
It triggered something in Chris Quinn to drive to the bas­ket and be, as Brey said, a two guard in the Big East that peo­ple should have trouble guard­ing. 
It triggered desperation in the minds of the players in the lock­er room. 
"Our backs were against the wall," Irish co-captain Jordan Cornette said. "I don't know if we realized that more now. I wish we had realized that the whole time, but it's go time and everybody realizes that. 
"We weren't coming out of here today with a loss." 

Until being faced with their postseason options hanging in the balance, the Irish didn't play with any sense of urgency. 
And finding that urgency resulted in their best win of the season. 
Think back to after the Irish made a good offensive play Sunday, backpedaling down court, Chris Thomas would call out defenses and not be cele­brating with the rest of the crowd. 
Recall the noise of the scor­er's table echoing throughout the Joyce Center after Brey kicked it midway through the second half when the Irish fell behind 58-52. 
The Irish wanted and needed this game.They wanted it more than Connecticut. Jim Calhoun acknowledged after the game that the Irish made more plays down the stretch necessary to win such a big-time game. 
For the first time· all season, they refused to lose. And they didn't.

Carroll won the 200-yard at mtennant@nd.edu 
What's it all mean? 
On paper, it's a win -a very good win -for the NCAA tour­nament resume. It gets the Irish to 5-3 at the halfway portion of the Big East schedule. In this conference, that's no small feat. 
In the locker room, it does even more. 
It tells the backcourt making double-digit 3-pointers isn't mandatory to win, even against one of the better frontcourts in the country. 
It gives them confidence going into the next three gamlls against three more ranked teams. 
Now Brey's job is to knep the confidence from going too high. With this veteran team, that shouldn't be hard. 
Yes, the loeker room was upbeat after the game, but Brey's postgame press confer­ence was low-key. 
That's because Brey knows it's only one game. And he knows what's coming up in the next three games. 
In the Big East, that's the only way to take it. Every game is extremely valuable and getting too high or too low after each one will do more harm than good by March. 
That's why Brey's mood didn't hit those extremes during the past three games. 
"I wasn't suicidal after Georgetown and Villanova," Brey said. ''I'm going to go home, have dinner and be thankful we're 5-3." 
Before going home, Brey might want to stop at the Grotto on the way. 
And light a candle for that lit­tle leprechaun.

This weekend, Notre Damn prowd il'> nwtlln, falling into the se1:oml s1:mmrio. 
Swimming with passion, the No. 21 Irish erased any lingering doubts following their heart­breaking loss to No. 14 Northwestnrn last Saturday. Posting throe solid vil:torios on tlw road. Notre Damn (9-2) swept past both ClnvPland State (X-3) and Canisius (0-10) on Friday and St. Bonaventure (6-4) on Saturday. 
"Wn wanted it to bn Ia statn­mmrt swim)," !wad coach Tim Welsh said. "Wn talkod al't.nr fin­ishing our meet last wonk about how tho rnst of our season was on tho road and tho I Big EastI ( :tmrnpionships were on the road. In the Championships, we race at night and the following morning so we wantnd to be ahlfl to race well one night and then again the li1llowing morning." 
Tho Irish sot linrr Heilly Center Pool records on route to a 150-87 victory against St. Bonaventure on Saturday afternoon. Finishing lirst in all 11 swimming Pvents and both diving competitions, Notre Damn showed li~w si),'llS of fatiguo al't.or its Friday dual-meet. 
.Junior Doug Bauman, junior Patrick Davis and f'rnshman Jay VandenBerg set individual pool rneords in tho 200-yard back­stroke (1 minute, 51.()2 sm:onds), tlw 500-yard fwestyle (4:3H.HO) and thn 1,000-yard frenstyln (1):23.51 ). Thn 400-yard medley relay team of Bauman, junior Tyler c;renda, sophomore Tim Kegelman and senior Frank Frakowski rounded out the Irish quartd of pool rm:ords, with a timl' of :J:26.52. 
"What's intornsling is tho sym­nwtrical-ness of it all." Welsh said. "Northwostorn sot four pool records against us on Saturday and l.hnn we went out and set four pool rncords against St. Bonaventure this Saturday." 
Tlw Irish propelled thmnselves to a quick start, leading 29-6 al't.er two 1wenl'i. Notn~ Damn won the 400 medley relay by morn than six semnds in thn first raco of the mo1~t. broaking the pool reeord. 
"The 'got a good start and irH:roasn your load' philosophy works nvnry time but it's just hard to do," Welsh said. 
The margin would only widen from there. Sophomore Louis Cavadini and senior David Moisan took tho two top spots in the 200­yard freestyle race with times of I :44.H7 and 1 :45.9H, respoctivoly. 
Saturday's competition wasn't the only source for individual Irish accolades. Sophomore Ted Brown (9:22.HH) and Davis 
(9:25.02) also posted the two fastest unshavp,d 1,000-yard frnestyln times in Irish history during Friday's meet at Cleveland Statn. 
En route to their 137-101 victo­ry against Cleveland State and a 172-53 win against Canisius, the Irish again got ofl' to a quick start. Tho tnam won seven of the first nino raens to set the pace early. 
Aftnr sweeping through the weekend's meets, the Irish also dinchnd their eighth winning sea­son in the last 1 0 yp,ars. 
"Obviously, a winning record is where we start from and we'd like to do that every yoar," Welsh said. "Our focus this year has been really on getting ready for the Championships. If we race well along the way, a winning rncord is what comes with it." 
Notre Dame only has one more regular-season meet ahead.-a road moot at Oakland University in Hoehestor, Mich. Beyond that mont, the Big East Championships loom. 
And with all the success the Irish havn achievnd this season, they'll be hungry to make one final statnment on tho season. 
"Tho nxcitement mounts," Welsh said. "We are in a count­down until the start of the Big East Championship. And yet the meet Saturday at Oakland is an important preparation rnop,t !br us. We think that thorn's plenty to got done to make sure we're as ready as possible for our Big East <:hampionship run."

Irish lose 2 straight to Falcons 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN 
Sports W1·irer 
Tho look on Morgan Coy's face midway through the third pnriod of Saturday night's game against Bowling Green said it 
all. 

The Irish goalie looked dis­mayed while leaning ovnr the team bench, watching Notre · Dame finish out a 6-2 loss, tlwir eighth eonseeutive defeat dating 
back to Jan. 7. 
For the Irish, it has been a 
season of frustration, a seem­
ingly endless amount of losing, 
whieh again came to light this 
weekond as the Irish dropped 
both games to Bowling Grnon in 
a home-and-home series. 
Friday night's game started 
out with the Falcons getting 
three·quick goals in the first 
12:46 of the first pP-riod. 

Taylor Christie scored for Bowling Green at H:33, putting a rebound past Irish goaltender David Brown. 
Just over three minutes later, Hyan Minnabarriet scored at 

11:42 on the power play for the Faleons, after a Brett Pilkinhrton shot dellected oiT Brown right to Minnabarriet who was in per­fect position for the put back. 
Things did not improve for 

Notrp, Dame. 
About a minute later, at 

12:46, Steve Brudzewski scored 
on a one-timer from James 
Unger, who was situated behind 
the net. 
Irish right wing Michael Bartlett scored midway through the second period at 10:23 to cut the Bowling Green load to 3­
1. But another Minnabarriet goal early in the third period at 
5:23 put the game out of roach. 
Saturday night, both teams 

traveled to the Joyce Cnnter to 
play the second of two games, 
but the only thing that changed 
for the Irish was the arena and 
the final score in the loss. 
Once again, the Irish quickly 

found themselves down early in 
the game. 
James Unger started the scor­

ing at 13:30, when he took the 
puck from the left side, beat an 
Irish defender and found him­
sell' with an open net to give 
Bowling Green a 1-0 lead. 
Bowling Grof1n quiekly added on another goal at 14:10, when Alex Foster found Mike Falk in front of the net with another look at an open goalmouth. 
"At that point we had given up two scoring chancp,s and two goals," Irish coach Dave Poulin said. 
"We showed them tape this morning of the game Ion FridayJ and it was eerily like last night's game whnro we played very well for a lot of the game, and wo had our chancp,s again tonight. 
"We have to bury our chances early in the game before it's out of hand." 
Unfortunately for the Irish, things did get out of hand. 
Early in the second period, Falk scored his second goal of the game at 2:20 whnn Jonathon Matsumato found thf1 Bowling Green forward in front of the crease with another open look. 
The scoring continued for Bowling Groen when they tacked on two more goals at 
9:17 and 9:27 in tho second period by Minnabarriet and Derek Whitmore, pushing the score to 5-0 -and prompting Poulin to pull goalie Morgan Coy from the game. 
Minnabarriet's goal carne on a 5-on-3, a play Poulin identified as the turning point in a game, which was still very much in reach. 
"The call to put us two men short ... the interpretation was a directive on the NCAA video, and it didn't lit the description to me at all," Poulin said. "And then I watchPd it on video, and it cJp,arly didn't." 

Jason Paige was whistled for hitting the goalie, despite Poulin's contention that Sigalet was never toudwd. 
Matt Amado put the Irish on the board at 19:14 for tho Irish aftnr a Bowling Grcnn turnover left tho Irish forward with the puck in the slot. Amado boat Sigalet liu· the tirst Irish goal of the night 
Bowli'ng Groen and Notre Dame traded third period goals, as Ben Geelan seorod on a onn­timer from Minnabarrint for the Falcons at 6::n, and Mark Van Guilder scored on the power play from in front of the net at 
15:09 for the Irish. 

Following tho ganw, Poulin had an optimistic view about the way in which the Irish played in the losses. 
"You 'ro going to look at this weekend and say we got swept 4-1 and h-2, and I'm going to look at it and say you start to play woll bdoro you win and unfortunatnly wo playod bnttnr this wenknnd than wo'vo had," he said. 
Notn~ Damn will have to rogroup l'or a pair of' homo games next wonkcnd against Nebraska-Clrnaha. 
Of' tho eight remaining gamos for the Irish, six of' them arn home -ono of' those homo matehos sehedulod to be play1~d in Fort Wayne against Michigan.

Fencers 
continued from page 20 
that time, including the duals with Penn State and Northwestern. coach Janusz Bednarski did not mind finishing out the day Sunday without one of his top fencers. 
"We need to give the backup fencers some experience," he said. 
While the women were able to avenge their sole defeat, the No. 4 ranked men's team was unable to beat the Buckeyes in their sec­ond try, losing by an identical 16­11 score. Despite another strong effort in the epee, where the Irish, led by senior Michael Sobieraj and sophomore Aaron Adjemian, dominated the Buckeyes 7-2, the team could not niuster much of an attack in the other two weapons. The Irish attack was especially frustrated in the sabre, where Ohio State, led by two-time defending cham­pion Adam Crompton, swept the Irish 9-0. 

"I expected the loss. The result is not showing the intensity of the bouts; lots of bouts were 5-4," Bednarski said, adding "however, we should not lose 9-0." 
The loss was not the only one for the Irish men, as No. 2 Penn State bettered them 15-12 on Saturday. The defeat was again characterized by an opponent's domination in one weapon ­this time in the foil. The foils, who are struggling without All­American Derek Snyder who will miss the season recovering from hand surgery, managed to win only two matches against the Nittany Lions. Led by an unde­feated Soberiaj, the epeeists highlighted a 42-3 day by win­ning six of nine. 
The women, on the other hand upheld their perfect record, defeating No. 3 Penn State 16-11 on Saturday. Kryczalo, Ament, Zagunis, and sophomore sabre Valerie Providenza led the charge against the Nittany Lions, with all of them going undefeat­ed. The match featured a rematch of the 2004 sabre title bout, as defending champ Providenza again defeated Sophia Hiss, this time by a score of 5-4. 
"The women's team really did a great job," Bednarski said. 
The Irish faced little other competition, as both the men's and women's teams rolled through the rest of the field. Despite its No. 6 ranking, Northwestern, who only fields a women's team, proved to be no match, as the Irish easily defeat­ed them 20-7. The women and men triumphed over Michigan by scores of 25-2 and 24-3, respec­tively, and both squads had iden­tical scores against Wisconsin, Cal-State Fullerton and Michigan State by respective scores of 27­0, 25-2 and 24-3. 
Bednarski was pleased with Saturday's results. 
"We beat Penn State in women's, lost minimally in men, and overall we beat them," he

from long range but outscored Connecticut (12-5, 4-3) 38-20 in the paint Sunday to come away with a much-needed 78-74 win at the Joyce Center. 
"This is the team we said we were going to be at the begin­ning of the season," Chris Thomas said. 
Notre Dame connected on 6­of-23 3-point attempts, but the team shot 42.6 percent overall and made of 14-of-20 free throws, all of which came in the second half'. 
Torin Francis led the Irish with 19 points, grabbing seven rebounds and limiting Connecticut center Josh Boone -who averages 14.8 points and 
9.6 rebounds-to six points and two rebounds. 

"We really battled physically today," coach Mike Brey said. ''I'm really proud of our front­line. I think they responded in the Villanova game, especially Torin, but to do what they did on the backboard and scoring inside was a key to the game Itoday]." 
The Irish had 36 rebounds to the IIuskies' 41, a formidable showing considering Connect­icut leads the nation in rebound­ing. 
Thomas reinforced his belief in the importance of an established inside game. 
"We just want to make an effort to get our big [guys] touch­es, get them confident," he said. "So many teams have been going inside against us, so we want to be able to counter that with our big [guys] having confidence on the offensive end as well." 
Francis, Dennis Latimore (12 points, nine rebounds) and Hiek Cornett (six points, one rebound) gave Notre Dame its first consis­tent inside-out offensive sets of the season. Francis, however, was the star against one of the nation's top frontcourts in Boone, Charlie Villanueva and freshman Rudy Gay. 
"The perimeter has confidence in me," Francis said. "They are giving me the ball down low. They know I'll make the right decision if I get doubled, I'll kick it out. If I don't, I' II take it up strong." 
Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun did not elect to double­team Francis often, and in the waning stages of the game it cost the Huskies. 
With 2:44 remaining in the game and Connecticut up 74-72, Francis took a baseline pass from Thomas and flushed the said. "[Saturday] was a pretty good day." 

The Irish continued their· suc­cess on Sunday. Other than the men's loss to Ohio State, both teams cruised through the rest of the teams, topping Cleveland State, Detroit, Lawrence, Wayne State and Chicago without diffi­culty. 
ball down over Villanueva for the basket and the foul. The Irish center missed the foul shot out of the TV timeout, but the Huskies did not score the rest of the way. 
Connecticut's defeat was sealed with 15 seconds remain­ing. Husky sophomore point guard Marcus Williams (1 0 points, 16 assists) stripped Notre Dame's Chris Quinn but missed the layup to tie the game. 
Thomas made two foul shots to extend the lead to four and end the ballgame. 
Following a jumper by Connecticut guard Denham Brown (9-of-15, 20 points) with 
5:07 to go, Thomas scored or assisted on every Notre Dame basket to close out the game. His 3-point shot to answer Brown's jumper gave the Irish momen­tum and helped them hold Connecticut scoreless for the final 3:09 of the game. 
"This team doesn't need my scoring," Thomas said. "It needs my confidence. It needs my play­making ability. And that's what I did. I saw the opportunity there and I put in the dagger." 
The Irish win snapped a two­game losing streak after Notre Dame dropped consecutive Big East contests to Georgetown (55­
54} and Villanova (65-60} this past week. 
"We've kind of been all over the board with different people stopping up at different times of the season," Thomas said. "But right now we have to ride what's working for us, and we're con­trolling tempo." 
Notre Dame played a quicker tempo Sunday, going into the half' with Connecticut up 41-39.

had lost at home in a regular season Big East game since a Feb. 27, 1993 contest against Georgetown. 
"We're extremely excited and proud of our emlrt tonight," Duffy said. "We've never come into Storrs and beaten them on their home court. It was a total team etfort." 
Notre Dame All-American Jacqueline Batteast logged 37 min­utes, but was mostly ineffective thanks to having the stomach flu. She fini<>hed the game just 3-of-17 from the field for nine points. 
Despite Batteast's struggles, the Irish still got payback on their biggest conference rival. 
"I thought we were more aggres­sive and not intimidated, and I just felt we played our game and did what they did to us," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. 
Notre Dame forced 16 first-half turnovers and converted those pos­session changes into 17 points. Extending their 2-:~ zone defense and using a full-court press at times, the Irish continuously pres­sured Connecticut's point guards and intercepted numerous sloppy cross-court passes. 
"I thought they took a lot of time off the clock. and we were able to get some deflections which led to steals," McGraw said. 
Notre Dame took command of the game late in the first half by sprinting off a 1 0-0 run that helped give the Irish a 34-24 hall'time advantage. 
But Connecticut came roaring back in the second half, cutting the lead down to two at 38-36 on a Jessica Moore layup with just more than 16 minutes left. The Irish bat­tled to stay in front, and extended their lead back to seven when Charel Allen drained a field goal with 10:58 remaining. Allen ended the game with 11 points on 5-of-6 shooting. 

With 4:36 left, Ann Strother, who finished the game with 25 point'> and seven 3-pointers, drilled a 3­pointer to trim Notre Dame's lead to just one at 52-51. On the ensu­ing Irish possession, Batteast near­ly lost the ball out of bounds before firing a pass to Allen in the comer of the court. With the shot clock winding down, the freshman swi<;hed a 3-pointer, putting Notre Dame back up by four. 
Notre Dame extended its lead to five on a LaVere layup before Strother hit another 3-pointer to make the score 61-59. The Huskies quickly fouled Duffy, who came into the game as the fourth-best free throw shooter in the nation at 
91.6 percent. The junior calmly sank both shots and all but ended Connecticut's hopes for a come­back. 
"This whole season I've just had a great amount of confidence at the free throw line," DuffY said. "It was so loud with the fans and everything. We needed two points, and I just stepped up and there were absolutely no nerves whatso­ever." 
The win puts the Irish at 19-3 and 6-2 in Big East play and drops Connecticut to 13-5 overall and 6-1 in the conference.

By ANN LOUGHERY Sports Writer 
Contrary to popular belief, his­tory does not always repeat itself. 
Case in point -Notre Dame made history of its own Sunday afternoon, besting Wake Forest 5-2 after falling 7-0 last year. The No. 21 Irish (3-1} swept doubles and claimed four of the six sin­gles matches en route to their victory over the No. 30 Demon Deacons (3-1). 
And captain Sarah Jane 
Connelly said revenge couldn't be any sweeter. 
"That was one of the worst matehes we played all last year, so it was definitely satisfying to win this year," the senior said. 
At No. 3, Sarah Jane Connelly and junior Kiki Stastny jump­·started the Irish efl'ort, walking off the court with an 8-1 win over Blakeley Offutt and Alisha Talbot. The duo is 13-4 on the season and 3-1 this spring. Freshman Brook Buck and junior Lauren
